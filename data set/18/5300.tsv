2011-04-29T10:03:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: i was so overjoyed when I found it in synaptic ... hehe ... I should probably read more of the docs on the release ...
2011-04-29T10:04:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: no probs ... I also found out how to make the sidebar launchers smaller
2011-04-29T10:04:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: sorry ... dunno about tooltip ...
2011-04-29T10:05:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: Unity lacks a GUI interface for editing the dash and sidebar ... but I am hoping it will come soon
2011-04-29T10:05:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: oh ... I haven't paid any attention to that ... :P
2011-04-29T10:07:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: ah, I see what you mean ... I will have to check that out when I get home ... (at the office atm ...)
2011-04-29T10:07:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: from what I am seeing here (on the net) it's supposed to have it ...
2011-04-29T10:09:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: mmk?
2011-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: gotcha ...
2011-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: why are you not running 11.04?
2011-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	histo	zetheroo1	many people may not switch
2011-04-29T10:11:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: yeah, I have had mixed feelings about it too
2011-04-29T10:11:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: though one could always upgrade and just use the classic session instead ...
2011-04-29T10:12:00.000Z	zetheroo1	histo	mostly due to Unity right!?
2011-04-29T10:12:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: definitely the smart route
2011-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	histo	zetheroo1	well you don't have to use unity on 11.04 but I still run 10.04 on my servers etc...
2011-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	zetheroo1		 tanath: so your really holding out on this one
2011-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	zetheroo1	histo	I hear you
