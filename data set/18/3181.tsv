2009-12-26T11:43:00.000Z	APERSON	datz	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2009-12-26T11:44:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	I did check, didn't see any 64 :(
2009-12-26T11:44:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	I guess I must have the 505
2009-12-26T11:44:00.000Z	APERSON	datz	that'll tell you what model you have
2009-12-26T11:45:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	the 506 has EM64T
2009-12-26T11:45:00.000Z	APERSON	datz	cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"

2009-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	APERSON	datz	nope, no 64 :/
2009-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	ah, that would explain the failed installs
2009-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	APERSON	datz	do you have a particular reason for wanting x64?
2009-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	All this time I thought I had the 506
2009-12-26T11:48:00.000Z	APERSON		!paste
2009-12-26T11:48:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	not really, going to do a fresh install, thought I'd go for 64 bit this time
2009-12-26T11:48:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	seems to run well on my other system
2009-12-26T11:48:00.000Z	datz		but that is a quad core
2009-12-26T11:49:00.000Z	APERSON	datz	it runs well on my end as well, but I have 4GB of ram to use and I do lots of media encoding
2009-12-26T11:50:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	yea, only 2GB on the P4 system, would be fine I bet.  4GB DDR2 on new sys too. :)
2009-12-26T11:50:00.000Z	datz	APERSON	well, looks like P4's have only one or two models with 64bit support
