2007-11-30T21:09:00.000Z	foso		i switched to xgl and it messed up my graphics, how do i revert to whatever i had before?
2007-11-30T21:10:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	sudo apt-get remove xserver-xgl shouold help you
2007-11-30T21:11:00.000Z	foso	Optyx	i did that last night, it says its not installed, a smarter friend said he thinks im using the wrong drivers now
2007-11-30T21:12:00.000Z	foso		it says its not installed anymore, i think it took it out last night
2007-11-30T21:12:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-11-30T21:14:00.000Z	foso	Optyx	do i want to use framebuffer device interface?
2007-11-30T21:15:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	it might not hurt to enable it
2007-11-30T21:15:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	what kind of graphics card are you using?
2007-11-30T21:15:00.000Z	foso		optyx: ati radeon mobility 9000igp
2007-11-30T21:16:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	you have to use the xorg drivers the ati binaries suck they don't support the 9000igp I have that card in my laptop
2007-11-30T21:16:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	it sucks
2007-11-30T21:17:00.000Z	foso		that sounds like what my buddy said last night
2007-11-30T21:17:00.000Z	foso		optyx: what can i do to make it work? i was running compiz with all sorts of things working great
2007-11-30T21:17:00.000Z	foso		optyx: should i close the xserver configuration program?
2007-11-30T21:18:00.000Z	Optyx		Foso: no finish it and use the fbdev driver
2007-11-30T21:19:00.000Z	foso		optyx: do i want the framebuffer thing?
2007-11-30T21:19:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	Its mainly a fluke when you get compiz to work on the 9000igp
2007-11-30T21:19:00.000Z	Optyx	foso	yes
