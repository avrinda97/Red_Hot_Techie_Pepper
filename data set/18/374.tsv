2012-03-15T18:27:00.000Z	compdoc	fwolve	there was some news about the new Ubuntu coming out will fix some of that
2012-03-15T18:32:00.000Z	compdoc	fwolve	from the upcoming Ubuntu 12.04:   pm-utils now has two new scripts to power down USB and various PCI devices in battery mode. A number of desktop packages were fixed to wake up less often. Both of these reduces power consumption and thus battery lifetime.
2012-03-15T18:35:00.000Z	fwolve	compdoc	i c about the power saving, how about the graphic card? since my laptop use 2 graphic card.
