2005-03-11T17:17:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	use sudo to do it.
2005-03-11T17:17:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-03-11T17:17:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	, thanks again.
2005-03-11T17:20:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	ok i've completed the steps but what do i do now? :P I still haven't got vlc.
2005-03-11T17:20:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install
2005-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	no it says alot of stuff about dependencies
2005-03-11T17:23:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	okay, try "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" first.
2005-03-11T17:23:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	that will install a large number of packages probably.
2005-03-11T17:24:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	ok i'll give it a shoot
2005-03-11T17:25:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	it said no packages were installed.
2005-03-11T17:25:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	okay, I'm confused as to why you're getting dependancy problems. can you paste the output of "sudo apt-get install vlc" into rafb.net/paste for me?

2005-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	hmm. there's definately something wrong. you didn't comment out the 'normal' repositories when you uncommented the universe ones did you?
2005-03-11T17:29:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	no here's the two i commented out:
2005-03-11T17:35:00.000Z	FEL	Jerub	 thanks for your help but im off to winxp for a while :P
2005-03-11T17:38:00.000Z	Jerub	FEL	just verify you have a total of 2 'deb' lines and 2 'deb-src' lines in your sources.list
