2009-06-30T09:23:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	i've noticed on 9.04 when you ssh in the motd will tell you if X number of updates are available
2009-06-30T09:23:00.000Z	dpreacher		bastidrazor...so its important that the motd be never touched...
2009-06-30T09:24:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	yes and no.. when you log in just run apt-get or aptitude. that is how i do it. regardless of being told an update is available
2009-06-30T09:25:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	mine is customized but i didn't really pay any attention to the update message since i ran apt-get every day
2009-06-30T09:25:00.000Z	dpreacher		so aptitude which am more comfortable with...run without params...would show that ncurses interface...so is there anything in there that can start download of the 'critical' updates bastidrazor.
2009-06-30T09:26:00.000Z	dpreacher		you just ran apt-get everyday...means whats the exact command? apt-get itself? bastidrazor?
2009-06-30T09:27:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	i prefer apt-get when running manually .. i have a script that runs aptitude --safe-upgrade
2009-06-30T09:27:00.000Z	dpreacher		how often do you run the aptitude script? can you share it? bastidrazor
2009-06-30T09:27:00.000Z	dpreacher		prime minister
2009-06-30T09:28:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	every few days.  it is actually an alias.
2009-06-30T09:37:00.000Z	dpreacher	bastidrazor	alias aptitude=aptitude --safe-upgrade...something similar. but won't it then upgrade even larger packages just because an update is there and its safe to get it. do the gui tools for such updates also get major updates?
2009-06-30T09:39:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	aptitude will upgrade just the same as synaptic.
2009-06-30T09:39:00.000Z	dpreacher		great i'll give it a try. thanks bastidrazor :)
2009-06-30T09:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	good luck
2009-06-30T09:40:00.000Z	dpreacher		is there a way to do dry-run of aptitude --safe-upgrade bastidrazor...to see what updates will get downloaded...so i could choose if needed...
2009-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	bastidrazor	dpreacher	add a -P to the syntax.. aptitude --safe-upgrade -P  ... that will give you a prompt
2009-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	dpreacher		cool
2009-06-30T10:31:00.000Z	dpreacher	bastidrazor	what would you suggest to use, to create a system snapshot before doing a aptitude safe-upgrade. i guess using safe-upgrade is safety already, but in case a rollback is needed. is it possible to rollback packages? how?
