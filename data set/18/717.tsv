2011-11-23T03:44:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	soreau	I think everyone got that thats a joke ;)
2011-11-23T03:45:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	In the official support channel, it's not
2011-12-18T03:52:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	file-roller?
2011-12-18T03:58:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	It's just a frontend gui to most of the cli archive utilities
2011-12-18T03:59:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	There's gzip, tar, unzip, unrar etc
2011-12-18T04:00:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	soreau	yeah I know its just a GUI to the cli, but Id like a gui in which many options can be set (like compression level)
2011-12-18T04:01:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	If you want the most control, you're probably best off using the cli tools directly
2011-12-18T04:02:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	Not that I'm aware of. That doesn't mean there isn't one, you could do a google search or ask on the forums
2011-12-18T04:05:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	soreau	is there a way to get it in the repositories?
2011-12-18T04:05:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	pardon?
2011-12-18T04:05:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	soreau	<MeQuerSat> I know Peazip has all those options, but unfortunately its not in the repositories :(
2011-12-18T04:06:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	You can try the deb here http://www.peazip.org/peazip-linux.html
2011-12-18T04:07:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	If the software works, why do you need to update?
2011-12-18T04:08:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	You probably only need to check for an update if you upgrade ubuntu
2011-12-18T04:09:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	This is a pointless conversation since we don't even support packages that aren't in the official repos
2011-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	You already answered that question: It's not in the repos
2011-12-18T04:11:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	soreau	how do I get it in...?
2011-12-18T04:11:00.000Z	soreau	MeQuerSat	You can file a bug report
