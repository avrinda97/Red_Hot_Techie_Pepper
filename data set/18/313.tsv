2012-10-19T11:16:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	yeah just add stuff to /etc/issue.d iirc
2012-10-19T11:17:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	strangely, i dont have /etc/issu.d
2012-10-19T11:17:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	yeah its not that
2012-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	/etc/update-motd.d
2012-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	but that info only appear after i login to machine
2012-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	hm?
2012-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	i hope to configure the dynamic info show on the terminal :)
2012-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	hm? http://screencloud.net/v/sleQ is what mine looks like
2012-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	that is before you login to server?
2012-10-19T11:40:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	..... when do you want this message to be? I swear your original question was edit ssh motd
2012-10-19T11:47:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	i want it to be in the terminal when the computer bootup (before the user login
2012-10-19T11:47:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	oh. I thought you meant ssh
2012-10-19T11:47:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	so disable X or just switch to tty1 by default
2012-10-19T11:48:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1836985 see post #6
2012-10-19T11:58:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	i am running on tty, what i mean is, for system information display such as what landscape have. would it be possible to make it appear although the user no login?
2012-10-19T11:59:00.000Z	md_5	qkit	no, security reasons
2012-10-19T11:59:00.000Z	qkit	md_5	ok, thanks for the help :)
