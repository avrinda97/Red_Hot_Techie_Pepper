2009-11-01T19:34:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	really.. what happens when you put a cd in?
2009-11-01T19:36:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	what kind of cd?
2009-11-01T19:36:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	all cds?
2009-11-01T19:39:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	what do you get from dmesg from your cdrom?
2009-11-01T19:43:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	that is all you get from dmesg?
2009-11-01T19:44:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	how about dmesg | grep sr0 ?
2009-11-01T19:44:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	or dmesg | grep sr
2009-11-01T19:45:00.000Z	zaoul1	newbie12345	dmesg | tail -f     and then put in a cd
