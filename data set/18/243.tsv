2012-07-02T09:38:00.000Z	LiquidEdge		I have sound everywhere but in Chromium.  Thoughts?
2012-07-02T09:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*    wait 10 seconds then reboot
2012-07-02T09:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	do other browsers have sound?
2012-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	don't you think you should try others...
2012-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	LiquidEdge	ActionParsnip	my life is on Chrome, need to get that to work.
2012-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	it's to TEST
2012-07-02T09:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	qis this in flash items? like youtube?
2012-07-02T09:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	then why didn't you say that?
2012-07-02T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	i bet if you play a streaming avi in your browser it plays
2012-07-02T09:48:00.000Z	LiquidEdge	ActionParsnip	makes sense.  How do I get the flash stuff to play?
2012-07-02T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	can you give a pastebin of the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'
2012-07-02T09:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	you can use http://pastie.org   (or similar)
2012-07-02T09:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	if you copy and paste it as one command, its easier for you and you won't butcher the command
2012-07-02T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	is your web connection slow?
2012-07-02T09:53:00.000Z	LiquidEdge	ActionParsnip	no.  Just setting up a lot.  Doing it now.
2012-07-02T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	gotcha
2012-07-02T10:10:00.000Z	LiquidEdge	ActionParsnip	Can you give me that command again?  Something died on my machine.  And a little bit inside me.
2012-07-02T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LiquidEdge	lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'
