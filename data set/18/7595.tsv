2010-04-14T05:33:00.000Z	soreau	kermit	Why do you need to downgrade it?
2010-04-14T05:34:00.000Z	kermit	soreau	because i liked it better than the newer versions
2010-04-14T05:34:00.000Z	soreau	kermit	Did you check synaptic already?
2010-04-14T05:37:00.000Z	kermit	soreau	the version i liked isnt listed in synaptic
2010-04-14T05:37:00.000Z	soreau	kermit	Then you'll need to get the deb from an earlier repo or build it from source
2010-04-14T05:38:00.000Z	kermit	soreau	how do i get it from an earlier repo?

2010-04-14T05:39:00.000Z	soreau	kermit	Ok sec
2010-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	soreau	kermit	Does /var/cache/apt/archives/ have the deb package version you're wanting?
2010-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	kermit	soreau	no, i guess i shouldnt have cleaned it.
2010-04-14T05:45:00.000Z	soreau	kermit	I can't seem to find a deb package of that version of firefox, but you can search if you want at packages.ubuntu.com
