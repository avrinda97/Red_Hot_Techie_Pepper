2011-07-12T18:02:00.000Z	Kaoloi		Im new to linux, I'd like to know whether every trackpad can enable two-finger scrolling?
2011-07-12T18:03:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	do this "sudo apt-get install  gpointing-device-settings"
2011-07-12T18:04:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	then open "pointing devices" u can enable it over there
2011-07-12T18:07:00.000Z	Kaoloi	xgt001	I have installed pointing devices and enabled 'vertical scrolling when dragging with two fingers' but its not working
2011-07-12T18:07:00.000Z	Kaoloi	xgt001	do i have to enable it under system settings > mouse ?
2011-07-12T18:08:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	yes try to enable in "mouse" as well
2011-07-12T18:10:00.000Z	Kaoloi	xgt001	its still not working I try restarting. thanks
2011-07-12T18:14:00.000Z	Kaoloi	xgt001	is there something else i can do?
2011-07-12T18:15:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	sad ... try disablin it in pointing devices and enable only in mouse and vice versa
2011-07-12T18:16:00.000Z	Kaoloi	xgt001	no success :( i guess i wont be able to do it on my laptop then.. thanks anyway

2011-07-12T18:20:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	u want to expand the partition size for ubuntu?
2011-07-12T18:22:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	u could try gparted, or gnome disk utility, but i never tried repartitioning myself....in fact it looks its easier to do in Gparted, however, u "may" loose ur files
2011-07-12T18:24:00.000Z	xgt001	Kaoloi	in linux , :)
2011-07-12T18:25:00.000Z	Kaoloi	xgt001	i have a partition right now its called sda1, ntfs, label:recovery, size:13.84GiB, Used: 13.01GiB, flags: diag <<<< It should be the one ubuntu is installed right?
