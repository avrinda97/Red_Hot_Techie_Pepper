2009-02-01T12:55:00.000Z	jordan_		i can't believe dell i hope everything still works
2009-02-01T12:56:00.000Z	jordan_		no, but why not make it 64bit
2009-02-01T12:56:00.000Z	jordan_		does hardy come with 64 bit?
2009-02-01T12:57:00.000Z	jordan_		ok so I need to reinstall and wipe out everything?
2009-02-01T12:58:00.000Z	jordan_		theres a dell rescue dvd image
2009-02-01T12:58:00.000Z	jordan_		not sure
2009-02-01T12:59:00.000Z	jordan_		i already made the dell rescue dvd image
2009-02-01T13:00:00.000Z	jordan_		i just got it today so i don't need to back up either
2009-02-01T13:01:00.000Z	jordan_		i'm worried there were drivers packaged that i will need
2009-02-01T13:02:00.000Z	jordan_		anyway is using 32bit os on 64bit processor wasting half the processor?
2009-02-01T13:02:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	um.... no
2009-02-01T13:06:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	yes Gnea is right, 32 won't quite recognize 4 GBs 64 recognizes something like 16 or 32GB I think (but I wouldn't swear to it) ...... it has to do with addressing I believe but again, I'm not 100% sure
2009-02-01T13:09:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	no, it's not that simple
2009-02-01T13:12:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	exactly, they're just "showing off" that it's 64bit
2009-02-01T13:13:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	also all intel processors since core 2 have been 64bit I  believe
2009-02-01T13:15:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	also I was COMPLETELY Ã¼ber wrong earlier, 64 bit supports up to 16 Exabytes
2009-02-01T13:18:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	yeah sorry about that, it's late and I don't think terribly well when it's late :D
2009-02-01T13:19:00.000Z	Trevski13	jordan_	yeah, the easiest (in my opinion) would be to just put the CD in and when you go to choose the location make sure to check the "format partition" check box
