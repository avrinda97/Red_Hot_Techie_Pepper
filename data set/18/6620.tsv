2008-05-05T13:29:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: system tools>gconf editor>apps>nautilus>desktop>check icons visable
2008-05-05T13:30:00.000Z	laeg	zvacet	where is system tools please?
2008-05-05T13:31:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: under apps in upper left corner if you don´t see it go to system>preferences>main menu and check it there
2008-05-05T13:32:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: or just type in terminal gconf-editor
2008-05-05T13:32:00.000Z	laeg	zvacet	i had to add it to the menu - is gconf the same as system tools > configuration editor?
2008-05-05T13:33:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	:yes
2008-05-05T13:33:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: read message above
2008-05-05T13:35:00.000Z	laeg	zvacet	ya i know, i wanted it to work the way you said originally though ;) in nautilus > desktop the only option with a check beside it it 'system volumes' but i'm looking at the computer icon on my desktop - isn't that odd? that worked nicely anyway - ty :)
2008-05-05T13:37:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: everyone you check will be on your desktop
2008-05-05T13:37:00.000Z	laeg	zvacet	ya but my computer icon was there already, and it's not checked!
2008-05-05T13:38:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: ?
2008-05-05T13:39:00.000Z	laeg	zvacet	the computer icon has been on my desktop for a few days, i added it another way but couldn't figure out how to add the rest
2008-05-05T13:40:00.000Z	zvacet	laeg	: did you tried like I suggested it is very strange if doesn´t work
2008-05-05T13:41:00.000Z	laeg	zvacet	no my friend, it _does_ work ty i'm just wondering how my computer icon is on the desktop already when it's unchecked in nautilus > desktop > computer_icon_visible (and it is still unchecked and still visible)
