2007-04-08T10:16:00.000Z	shawnr		anyone have any i dead why my system keeps locking up? it completely freezes, what log file is best to start looking in?
2007-04-08T10:17:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	could it be a hardware problem?
2007-04-08T10:18:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	i've been trying to narrow it down when the whole thing started, i think its when someone from this room helped me setup my wifi
2007-04-08T10:19:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	im surprised i've gone this long without freezing up
2007-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	have you tried without wifi for a while to see if it is related?
2007-04-08T10:21:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	the guy who helped me had me use fwcutter, i noticed that system was trying to load ndiswrapper even though i uninstalled it
2007-04-08T10:22:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	could that be it you think? I removed it from modprob.d
2007-04-08T10:22:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	you could try blacklisting it, it could be but it is more likely a bug in the wireless driver imo
2007-04-08T10:23:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	is there a log file for it?
2007-04-08T10:24:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	if you're getting a kernel panic then the log will not get written because the systems halts before it can
2007-04-08T10:25:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	however you can check if ndiswrapper is loaded with lsmod
2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	yea... it is. i will blacklist it and restart
2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	shawnr	lilphil	thanks... i'll be back
2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	ok. youre sure you arnt suposed to be using ndiswrapper though right?
2007-04-08T10:28:00.000Z	lilphil	shawnr	change /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove splash (or is it quiet... one of the two)
