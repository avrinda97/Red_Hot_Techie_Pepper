2006-08-24T10:39:00.000Z	Warbo		Great. I decide to give up on the Wifi, and now X doesn't work (it doesn't seem to be the update bug either)
2006-08-24T10:41:00.000Z	Warbo		What does it mean when Xorg cannot find "bitmap" and "pcidata"
2006-08-24T10:42:00.000Z	Warbo		!cli
2006-08-24T10:43:00.000Z	Warbo		Glad I started such a deep debate, but can I get some help with Xorg please? I am feeling very awkward in ircII
2006-08-24T10:45:00.000Z	Warbo		screaminIke: You mean gnome-system-monitor
2006-08-24T10:46:00.000Z	Warbo		!grub
2006-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	Warbo		I'd like some more eyecandy for my CLI though
2006-08-24T10:49:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	try this for eyecandy an the cli     echo -e "\33] P0006600\33] P7FF9900"
2006-08-24T10:50:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	echo -e "\33] R" to change it back
2006-08-24T10:50:00.000Z	Warbo	w30	I don't want to break my terminal since I haven't got any graphics (besides, your text has now gone off screen)
2006-08-24T10:50:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	try this for eyecandy an the cli     echo -e "\33] P0006600\33] P7FF9900"

2006-08-24T10:51:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	gpm but you have to reboot after synaptic installs it
2006-10-03T16:53:00.000Z	Warbo	w30	Dapper
2006-10-03T16:46:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	what's the group name of your /var/log/cups/error_log file?
2006-10-03T16:52:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	what distro version are you using?
2006-10-03T16:54:00.000Z	w30	Warbo	ok me too, thanks
