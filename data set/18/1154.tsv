2011-05-14T15:02:00.000Z	eleruin		Does anyone know how to configure cups-pdf on ubuntu 10.10 ? It only prints blank pdf pages.
2011-05-14T15:03:00.000Z	eleruin		Howto's on the internet are bit outdated i guess
2011-05-14T15:03:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	how did you install cups-pdf? that may help us
2011-05-14T15:03:00.000Z	eleruin		apt-get install cups-pdf
2011-05-14T15:04:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	give me a moment to check something
2011-05-14T15:05:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	do you have aptitude installed?
2011-05-14T15:05:00.000Z	eleruin		yes
2011-05-14T15:06:00.000Z	dcg		if you run aptitude and search for cups-pdf, then press enter on it. this will open more info about that package. please check that all depends and suggests are installed.
2011-05-14T15:11:00.000Z	eleruin		dependencies are : cups, cups-client, ghostscript, libc6, libpaper-utils. I got all installed.
2011-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	that is strange then, perhaps you need to try printing to pdf from some other programs, in case it is a compatibility issue. for that matter it could be a good idea to try viewing from different programs/computers too
2011-05-14T15:24:00.000Z	eleruin		Ok, i'm sorry, cups-pdf works with another program. The problem is maybe compatibility with GIMP or with A1 paper size ?
2011-05-14T15:27:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	strange I have used it from gimp before, but you may have hit a bug related to storing massive images in a PDF.
2011-05-14T15:28:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	PDF's are not really designed to hold giant binary lumps, while they can do so they were really designed to allow primarily textual information to be represented, images was an extension
2011-05-14T15:29:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	try creating a smaller image and printing that from gimp.
2011-05-14T15:42:00.000Z	eleruin		dcl : I've got the same problem with A4 and A5
2011-05-14T15:44:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	almost didn't spot that message, I am dcg not dcl !!!! try a small image, but create it from scratch and just use a couple of colours. don't shrink something that you already have.
2011-05-14T15:49:00.000Z	eleruin	dcg	: I'm sorry. I tried to print an image that's entirely black and I still get the same blank page. Same issue with the default "Print to File".
2011-05-14T15:51:00.000Z	dcg	eleruin	that is strange, I wonder if it is not actually a problem with cups-pdf but a missing dependancy for gimp
