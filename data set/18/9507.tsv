2007-03-28T05:51:00.000Z	Frog29		hi, can someone help me mount a drive on the livecd..... i'm sorta new to linux :)
2007-03-28T05:52:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	mkdir /mnt/thingy && mount -t ext2|3 /dev/hdx /mnt/thingy
2007-03-28T05:53:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	it depends what filesystem is on the partition you wanna mount
2007-03-28T05:53:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- so would this work? mount /dev/sda3 -t ext3 /mnt/old
2007-03-28T05:54:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	lokks OK
2007-03-28T05:55:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- a path name is not a dricetory?
2007-03-28T05:56:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	do a fdisk -l /dev/sda
2007-03-28T05:57:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	then perhaps you don't have a /dev/sda
2007-03-28T05:57:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	try sdb ?
2007-03-28T05:58:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- no dice
2007-03-28T05:58:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	what makes you think you have a /dev/sdx in your machine?
2007-03-28T05:59:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- i did when i installed ubuntu.....
2007-03-28T05:59:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- and i checked hda as well, it jsut doens't do anything, remember thsi is a live cd
2007-03-28T05:59:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- am i doing something wrong with the /dev/
2007-03-28T06:01:00.000Z	Frog29	harpette	- is there any way to just see every drive form the livecd?
2007-03-28T06:01:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	live CD or not, it should detect all your drives in your system, but not mount them indeed.
2007-03-28T06:04:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	then do a sudo "parted /dev/sda print", it'll show you which filesystems are ob which partitions
2007-03-28T06:05:00.000Z	harpette	Frog29	cool
