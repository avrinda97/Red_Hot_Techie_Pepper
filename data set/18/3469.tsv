2009-09-26T11:53:00.000Z	Dasda		what is a splash screen guys?
2009-09-26T11:53:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	it can refer to many things
2009-11-01T00:43:00.000Z	Dasda	jrib	to use that command i would have to first navigate to the locating dir in terminal right?
2009-11-01T00:44:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	well you can just give the path, something like: mount /foo/bar/blah /some/other/foo
2009-11-01T00:45:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	yes, there is a nautilus script (I do not know its name offhand though)
2009-11-01T00:56:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	what do you want to do with it?
2009-11-01T00:56:00.000Z	Dasda	jrib	upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10
2009-11-01T00:56:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	is this the alternate cd?
2009-11-01T00:57:00.000Z	Dasda	jrib	ubuntu-9.10-desktop-i386
2009-11-01T00:57:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	you can't use that disk to upgrade.
2009-11-01T01:12:00.000Z	Dasda	jrib	same thing. I have alternate cd mounted but its not autobooting
2009-11-01T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	it wouldn't.  Just use apt-cdrom yourself
2009-11-01T01:13:00.000Z	Dasda	jrib	what do I type in terminal to boot it?
2009-11-01T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	you don't boot it, you add it as a repository
2009-11-01T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	ubottu's link should explain this
2009-11-01T01:16:00.000Z	Dasda	jrib	this did it gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
2009-11-01T01:16:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	good
2009-12-02T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	Dasda	no
