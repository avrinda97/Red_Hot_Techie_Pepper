2007-03-17T06:01:00.000Z	Jewbilee		Hey, I just installed ubuntu on an external hardrive.  Both the / and swap partitions are on the external harddrive.  My intent was to be able to run windows on my laptop, and when the external is with me, be able to boot ubuntu if wanted.  If my external is unplugged or turned off though, I get a GRUB error.  Error 21
2007-03-17T06:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	grub (the boot loader) is looking for its configuration file, which lives in the ubuntu partition. It can't find it and thus can't load.
2007-03-17T06:02:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	well, i wasnt even expecting grub to load unless i booted from my external drive
2007-03-17T06:03:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	i should be booting from my internall HDD and that only has windows installed
2007-03-17T06:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	You can solve this by making a small (100mb) partition on your main hard drive and installing grub to that. Or else use a different boot loader of some sort.
2007-03-17T06:03:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	is it possible that my boot order has been switched?
2007-03-17T06:03:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	and its trying to boot from the external
2007-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	grub is installed to the master boot loader of the internal hard drive. For the effect you want to achieve, you'd need to install grub to the boot record of the external hard drive and then configure the bios to boot from the external hard drive first.
2007-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	what i want to be able to do is when the laptop is turned on, have it go straight to windows, unless i press f12 to boot specifically from the external
2007-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	What does f12 do?
2007-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	f12 on my main startup page is my "boot from" menu
2007-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	Is that from the bios or from software?
2007-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	itll let me choose interal, external, cdrom, blah blah you know
2007-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	bios
2007-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	Then I would put the windows boot loader back onto the internal hard drive's MBR and put grub on the external drive.
2007-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	i dont know what you mean
2007-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jewbilee	Boot ubuntu. Run sudo grub-install /dev/<secondary drive here>. Then, restore windows' boot manager for your internal drive (you'd have to google or ask around about how to do that, I've never gone the other way down that road =))
2007-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	Jewbilee	arrenlex	thanks, ill ask around
