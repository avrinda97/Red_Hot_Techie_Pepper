2006-04-25T09:44:00.000Z	harisund		Does anybody have an experience of their mouse cursor turning black after a screensaver starts?
2006-04-25T09:46:00.000Z	harisund		aha ! amphi I have a strong feeling you are right. Any idea how I can change that?
2006-04-25T09:48:00.000Z	harisund		But you are right, come to think of it, it does change to default x cursor
2006-04-25T09:49:00.000Z	harisund		Does anybody use gkrellm? Or any equivalent of that perhaps?
2006-04-25T09:49:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	I do
2006-04-25T09:50:00.000Z	harisund	rukuartic	How's it?
2006-04-25T09:50:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	It works well :P Fairly customizable.
2006-04-25T09:50:00.000Z	harisund	rukuartic	thanks .. have you intsalled some of the plugins?
2006-04-25T09:50:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	Using the WIFI one.
2006-04-25T09:50:00.000Z	harisund	rukuartic	Ah must come in handy
2006-04-25T09:51:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	Yep. I run a small server, and I monitor CPU usage/memory with it
2006-04-25T09:51:00.000Z	harisund	rukuartic	you run a small server, and on that machine you run gkrellm, is that what you are saying?
2006-04-25T09:52:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	There's too parts. The daemon and the monitor. The daemon runs always in the BG, logs data. The monitor can be turned on whenever. But its cool because I could be on another linux box, and monitor it with the monitoring program
2006-04-25T09:52:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	The server runs the gkrellm daemon, so I can connect mydns.com:XXXX (can't remember the port)
2006-04-25T09:52:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	You better believe it rofl
2006-04-25T09:53:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	Should be in repos
2006-04-25T09:58:00.000Z	rukuartic	harisund	What exactily does getty do?
2006-04-25T09:58:00.000Z	harisund	rukuartic	A getty is (I think) a log in terminal.
