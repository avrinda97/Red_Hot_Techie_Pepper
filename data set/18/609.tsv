2011-12-01T18:07:00.000Z	inad922_		as I read gnome terminal looks for that when starting and I wold like to set it to bash instead of tcsh

2011-12-01T18:08:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	inad922_	you can buy mine, lol I have never been so unsatisfied with a smartphone in my life until I bought this iPhone4
2011-12-01T18:10:00.000Z	inad922_	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	You don't like it?
2011-12-01T18:10:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	inad922_	not at all... I miss the days when Treo was the king!
2011-12-01T18:10:00.000Z	inad922_	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	lol I used cheap nokia phones before. I was more satisfied with them too.
2011-12-01T18:12:00.000Z	inad922_	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	Palm is totally dead btw?
2011-12-01T18:13:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	inad922_	might as well be dead.... they screwed themselves with the release of the last treo; it was a horrible piece of junk compared to all their previous smartphones
2011-12-01T18:14:00.000Z	inad922_	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	Why what did they mess up? I haven't really used any Palm products so I can't really compare.
2011-12-01T18:14:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	inad922_	everything, lol... it was such a total letdown that I moved to the iPhone.... should've went to a BB though
2011-12-01T18:15:00.000Z	inad922_	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	Yeah BB seems to be a good choice. Android is flawed too btw. At least for me it just doesn't cut it.
2011-12-01T18:16:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	inad922_	give androids a few years; they are still premature and wet behind the ears...
2011-12-01T18:18:00.000Z	inad922_	Dj_FlyBy[ms]	Yeah maybe it's true. But somehow they just need to tame the background processes or let the user somehow renice them or something because they are making it slow a lot of times. On other news Intents is a big invention. It's better than dbus imho.
