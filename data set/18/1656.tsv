2011-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	Auriga		Q: Do we all get the compiz -- replace issue, or is it just me?
2011-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	works fine here
2011-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	You never have to replace your GUI?
2011-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	how do you mean by gui....?
2011-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	Sorry not the gui, just the window buttons.
2011-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	oh, the window decorator?
2011-03-22T10:18:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	Yeah basically.
2011-03-22T10:19:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	I think you have never had the issue, it's a little odd to explain what happens.
2011-03-22T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	there is emerald which you can apply themes to very easily
2011-03-22T10:19:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	I'm not talking about themes.
2011-03-22T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	"changing the buttons" sounds a LOT like theming, wouldn't you say. Try giving details and we may be able to help
2011-03-22T10:21:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	It's not changing the buttons, it's when the buttons dissapear, & you are not able to move the window. Nor close it, or minimize, you have to replace them with compiz - -replace. Not the same at all.
2011-03-22T10:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	you should have said THAT first, rather than "You never have to replace your GUI?"  which is absolutely nothing to do with your issue
2011-03-22T10:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	compiz isn't even a GUI, its a window manager
2011-03-22T10:23:00.000Z	Auriga	ActionParsnip	That is exactly what I  said at first. I wasn't talking about theming, I said the compiz - - replace issue...
2011-03-22T10:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	I suggest you use the startup items manager and add a new item to run:  compiz --replace     and it will be fine
2011-03-22T10:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	fyi, you CAN move windows without window decorators, if you hold ALT you can drag an application window from any place in the app
2011-06-20T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Auriga	i'm sure millions do
