2012-02-05T17:40:00.000Z	Mautz		Hey there! Got some trouble with booting from MARVELL raid after updating the BIOS; Ubuntu doesn't find the raid drive, which I used to boot from. Windows 7 does, so I think the raid itself is still ok. fdisk on live-system won't show the disk either. Could someone help me out please?
2012-02-05T17:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	you'll find that common with all fakeraid devices
2012-02-05T17:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	using fakeraid is something I'd try to avoid at all costs
2012-02-05T17:43:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	but it worked until this update; any idea how to fix this?
2012-02-05T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	I suspect the support/inbuilt driver will have changed between kernels and that device is no longer usable
2012-02-05T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	again - fake raid is the devil
2012-02-05T17:44:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	so i have to downgrade my bios again and hope, that I will show up agian?
2012-02-05T17:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	I just wouldn't use it at all, and swap to software raid
2012-02-05T17:46:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	can I use the software-raid from linux and windows? doesn't it slow down the system?
2012-02-05T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	software raid is not cross-platform, so your windows disk won't see it
2012-02-05T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	in terms of performance there is no difference between software raid and fake raid, they both use the machines cpu (that's why it's called fake raid)
2012-02-05T17:48:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	so best would be to use a raid-controller?!
2012-02-05T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	a hardware raid controller is good, software raid if you only need Linux support, fakeraid (for me) never
2012-02-05T17:52:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	got an idea, how much a raid-controller should be?
2012-02-05T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	$400 is the average, look up LSI and 3ware
2012-02-05T17:55:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	ok, thank you for your help! I'll try to recover my data using the old bios and then delete the fakeraid.
2012-02-05T17:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Mautz	not the help you where looking for I know, but it will serve you well in the long run
2012-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	Mautz	ikonia	well, i the end i learned a bit, so it was worth it ;)
