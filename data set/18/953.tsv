2011-07-23T20:08:00.000Z	idlemind324		at&t's modem only assigns 1 ip per mac address
2011-07-23T20:08:00.000Z	idlemind324		easy way around it is create a linux router and use virtual nic's
2011-07-23T20:08:00.000Z	idlemind324		i could use openwrt but i need a router that is supported and i fail =/
2011-07-23T20:09:00.000Z	idlemind324		ps does anyone know why empathy window grows when you fill up the line install of scrolling. it's kind of annoying
2011-07-23T20:09:00.000Z	edbian	idlemind324	The ISP gives an cheap static IP to the modem.  The modem gives the IP to the router.  The router does NAT.  Any normal router does NAT.  What is the issue here?  Why is dd-wrt necessary?
2011-07-23T20:10:00.000Z	idlemind324	edbian	yes i have 5 usable external ip's
2011-07-23T20:10:00.000Z	idlemind324	edbian	at&t doesn't allow you to tell your inside interface hey here is my subnet listen on all them
2011-07-23T20:10:00.000Z	edbian	idlemind324	Oh that sucks
2011-07-23T20:11:00.000Z	edbian	idlemind324	port forward?
2011-07-23T20:11:00.000Z	idlemind324	edbian	their modem basically controls the ip's so you configure a "dmz" pass through and you can send some or all traffic to 1 of your internal pc's for 1 address
2011-07-23T20:12:00.000Z	idlemind324	edbian	it's pretty silly but leave it up to a large isp to do some foolishness
2011-07-23T20:12:00.000Z	edbian	idlemind324	That sucks
