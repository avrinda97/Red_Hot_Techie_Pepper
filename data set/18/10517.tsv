2007-01-03T14:28:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	what camera and you just using the camera itself intot he computer?
2007-01-03T14:30:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	depends if the camera acts like a storage device some don't
2007-01-03T14:30:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	It found the device and the log says "usb 1-1.3: configuration #1 chosen from 2 choices"
2007-01-03T14:33:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	does mount say anything for a device that wasn't mounted before
2007-01-03T14:34:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	not sure what you mean...it mounts my mp3 player with no problem
2007-01-03T14:35:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	if you type mount in a terminal pastebin what you see
2007-01-03T14:35:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	I expect it to install a new device, then mount it
2007-01-03T14:35:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	should be /dev/sda1 if it didn't automount
2007-01-03T14:36:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	it might have automounted and you didn't know
2007-01-03T14:36:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	it did not automount and there is no /dev/sd*
2007-01-03T14:37:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	when I do "ls /dev/ |grep sd" it returns ptysd and ttysd, I don't think either of them is my camera device
2007-01-03T14:39:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	what is the exact model of your camera?
2007-01-03T14:39:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	SVP Digi-Shot
2007-01-03T14:41:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	hmm can't find anything about that camera at all in Linux
2007-01-03T14:42:00.000Z	EDinNY	kitche	it seems that other people have problems with cameras on edgdy
2007-01-03T14:44:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	all I get when I search for your camera in linux is one page and it's a shop
2007-08-03T10:37:00.000Z	kitche	EDinNY	/boot does though
