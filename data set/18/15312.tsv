2005-04-12T06:34:00.000Z	Dalk		glxgears: Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual.
2005-04-12T06:34:00.000Z	Dalk		How can I fix this please?
2005-04-12T06:35:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	I had the same problems in the last days
2005-04-12T06:35:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	running nvidia drivers?
2005-04-12T06:35:00.000Z	Dalk		Yeah
2005-04-12T06:35:00.000Z	Dalk		I was trying to enable direct rendering
2005-04-12T06:35:00.000Z	PacoBCN		sure you have them loaded?
2005-04-12T06:35:00.000Z	Dalk		did a few ln -fs 'es and i got these errors
2005-04-12T06:36:00.000Z	Dalk	PacoBCN	What did you do to fix?
2005-04-12T06:36:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	for some reason at every reboot my xorg.conf deleted the nvidia load and put nv again
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	honestly? waiting developers to update their packages
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	and it worked
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	Dalk		So... should I reinstall my drivers?
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	also there was no restricted modules for 686 kernel
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	at the end they seem to have fixed it all
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	PacoBCN		well, try enabling them again
2005-04-12T06:37:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Dalk	I guess you have already done it, right?
