2008-06-26T21:53:00.000Z	ntolo		when you run apt-get install ,where is the program installed ?
2008-06-26T21:53:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	it depends on the package. Find out with 'dpkg -L packagename' where the various files go
2008-06-26T21:53:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	what did you install?
2008-06-26T21:55:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	and you're looking for a way to start it?
2008-06-26T21:55:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	how come you had to install firefox -- it comes with Ubuntu by default...
2008-06-26T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	not really
2008-06-26T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	what's the problem?
2008-06-26T22:01:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	it's on the default path. Open a terminal and enter 'firefox'
2008-06-26T22:03:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	how did you install it?
2008-06-26T22:04:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	can you do a 'sudo apt-get -f install' and put any errors on http://paste.ubuntu.com
2008-06-26T22:07:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	I asked  you to run 'sudo apt-get -f install'  (nothing else)
2008-06-26T22:09:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	does 'sudo apt-get -f install' report  any errors?
2008-06-26T22:11:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	what exactly do you get from 'firefox' in the terminal? (Use pastebin if there's a lot)
2008-06-26T22:12:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	that's not the output from 'firefox'
2008-06-26T22:15:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	do you get a file listing from 'dpkg -L firefox'?
2008-06-26T22:16:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	do you get any output from 'which firefox'?
2008-06-26T22:18:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	try a 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install firefox'
2008-06-26T22:31:00.000Z	soundray	ntolo	from the menu bar, open Help-About
