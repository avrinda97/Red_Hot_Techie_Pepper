2012-01-10T08:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	that is because you have chosen that file to extract?
2012-01-10T08:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	you are chosing to unpack one file, when you should be unpacking the folder
2012-01-10T08:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	dont
2012-01-10T08:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	paste it
2012-01-10T08:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	you pasted the .rar file?
2012-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	since its not your first rodeo lets hit the finer points, you got a rar, within it is a folder, the folder may extract as a 'hidden folder' .xxxxx type, you wont see it on desktop, you will seee it with nautilus if you enter the 'desktop' folder and have the 'let me see hidden folders and files option clicked, there you go 'sport'
2012-01-10T08:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	btw sport , start with the nick you are talking to, like at the rodeo
2012-01-10T08:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	pleasegawd	if you are looking at the folder than the issue is resolved, its unpacked, what you get is what is was packed
