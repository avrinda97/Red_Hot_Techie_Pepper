2011-05-05T01:02:00.000Z	CQ		anyone know how to get the sbs module loaded for lm-sensors, or what it is exactly? I have the same problem as http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1537746
2011-05-05T01:03:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	sudo modprobe sbs
2011-05-05T01:04:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	injects modules into the kernel.  Think of it as 'turning a drive ron'
2011-05-05T01:05:00.000Z	CQ	edbian	doesn't do anthing, modprobe -l doesnt show it, locate doesn't show it...
2011-05-05T01:05:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	If it returns without giving an error that means it was inserted successfully.  Try running sudo sensors-detect
2011-05-05T01:06:00.000Z	CQ	edbian	but modprobe -l should show it, shouldn't it??
2011-05-05T01:06:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	Yeah it should.  Try lsmod | grep sbs
2011-05-05T01:06:00.000Z	CQ	edbian	nope, shows nothing
2011-05-05T01:06:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	strange.
2011-05-05T01:07:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	Does sudo sensors-detect work any differently?
2011-05-05T01:07:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	What is the ultimate goal here?
2011-05-05T01:07:00.000Z	CQ	edbian	get gkrellm to show all the sensors that are in the computer ...
2011-05-05T01:08:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	Ignoring this sbs error what functionality are you getting out of gkrellm ?
2011-05-05T01:09:00.000Z	CQ	edbian	shows quite a few sensors that the sensors command shows as well
2011-05-05T01:09:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	I'm not sure what sbs does.  What the error pertains to.  Perhaps it makes no difference having it installed or not.  I can't offer any more advice :(
2011-05-05T01:10:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	In short, if I were you I'd be in here asking people :P
2011-05-05T01:10:00.000Z	CQ	edbian	ok, thanks all the same... there's no answer in #linux-sensors which is the lm-sensors channel here
2011-05-05T01:10:00.000Z	edbian	CQ	Most channels are not as active as this one.  wait a while
