2010-05-22T23:59:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	no dude there are GUIs for all those you mentioned
2010-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	What?
2010-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	yes
2010-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	Example please?
2010-05-23T00:01:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	That's for MySQL, and it is not a GUI app
2010-05-23T00:01:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	actually you can just use webmin and it will allow you to use a web GUI for all those you just mentioned
2010-05-23T00:01:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	Even webmin is not a "GUI app" ...
2010-05-23T00:02:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	http://www.webmin.com/
2010-05-23T00:02:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	dude do you have to use a CLI NO, so yes it is a GUI
2010-05-23T00:03:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	anything that you can point and click is a GUI, either desktop or web
2010-05-23T00:03:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	You point and click in your browser. This is the GUI app in this case
2010-05-23T00:03:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	a GUI is a GUI as long as you can point and click
2010-05-23T00:04:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	This is not the point. yosi1234 wants to know which GUI tools need to run on the server.
2010-05-23T00:04:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	the issue with most of these guys in here is that they see the CLI as a faster mor efficient way to do things and is more secure
2010-05-23T00:05:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	OK webmin is one such tool from there he can control everything through a GUI
2010-05-23T00:05:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	And I say, none of the apps mentioned needs a VNC like GUI to be run *on the server+
2010-05-23T00:07:00.000Z	vlt	reya2276	This is not about commands vs point and click. This is about running X apps on the server (and the need to)
2010-05-23T00:09:00.000Z	reya2276	vlt	dude what are you talking about, he likes GUIs and if you know of tools which he can use instead of a CLI then let him know, I got no arguments on whatever you were trying to say just pointing out that there are tools out there which allow you control those apps through a GUI
