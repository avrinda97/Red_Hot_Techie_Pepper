2012-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	Church		i wonder when (if?) ubuntu will introduce software raid & lvm in base installer. i find it hard to believe if that will overcomplicate installer much if moved under some 'advanced disk layout' that common joes won't be touching
2012-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	escott	Church	more likely they just switch to btrfs
2012-03-18T04:50:00.000Z	Church	escott	can btrfs support functionality of md raid/lvm like mirroring, pvmove, lvextend, striping?
2012-03-18T04:51:00.000Z	escott	Church	its all in the plan, they way it does raid is a bitter different than mdraid (its not a pure raid but if you ask for mirroring then it ensures it has two copies on different disks, but the on disk layout is not mirrored) in many ways its better because the disks need not be the same size
2012-03-18T04:51:00.000Z	Church	escott	they need not be same size with md raid too
2012-03-18T04:53:00.000Z	escott	Church	btrfs can do raid 1 mirroring across different disk sizes. i thought that was impossible in mdadm
2012-03-18T04:54:00.000Z	Church	escott	but you can make partitions of same sizes and mirror those.
2012-03-18T04:55:00.000Z	escott	Church	as im saying btrfs is more flexible. take X random drives and put them together, add them all to the same btrfs volume and say you want Y mirrors and every file will be mirrored on at least Y disks (if that is possible)
2012-03-18T04:55:00.000Z	Church	escott	for flexibility there is lvm.
2012-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	escott	Church	then use LVM, your question was "are they likely to have lvm/mdadm in the default installer" and the answer is "no, they are more likely to just switch to btrfs and then all that is unnecessary"
2012-03-18T04:57:00.000Z	Church	escott	i just always disliked having to use different installer or dropping down to CLI with ubuntu, when there for years been very usuable lvm gui configuring in redhat based installers
2012-03-18T04:58:00.000Z	escott	Church	redhat has a different target audience
2012-06-07T05:51:00.000Z	Church	escott	when i needed redirection to work IIRC i used sudo sh -c "comand | command2 > whatever"
2012-06-07T05:52:00.000Z	escott	Church	which is fine for interactive usage. just dont put it in a script
2012-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	escott	Church	you can also use tee which avoids running command and command2 as root. unpriv | unpriv | sudo tee -a filename so only "tee" runs priviliged
2012-06-07T05:56:00.000Z	Church	escott	imho you overblow issue a bit. there are many many ways to gain privileges with abusing sudo and in stuff that is run by it by eg. shellescaping. it's just that i usually use sudo for giving some extra permissions instead of root account for some dumb developers that have little skills/clue to abuse it, as in using sudo in role "some security is better then none or all"
2012-06-07T05:58:00.000Z	escott	Church	i have no idea what you are talking about. im not talking about any security issue.
2012-06-07T05:58:00.000Z	escott	Church	im talking about putting an interactive program into a non-interactive script
