2009-05-26T02:17:00.000Z	Teundusia		I'm having major issues installing Ubuntu Studio, and was led here thanks to there being no one on their support IRC. Can anyone help? Through private chat preferably...
2009-05-26T02:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	What do you need help with?
2009-05-26T02:20:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	Every time I try to install (I've burnt it to disc and everything) Ubuntu Studio, I get an error. It says something along the lines of "unable to mount the disc image" and nothing I do appears to change that
2009-05-26T02:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	which installer did you download?
2009-05-26T02:23:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	The i386 one here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/9.04/release/
2009-05-26T02:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	Hmm.  Alright, did you verify the MD5 of the file you downloaded?  And when does it give you the mount error?
2009-05-26T02:27:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	I have no clue what an MD5 is, and the strange thing is before and after trying to install Ubuntu Studio, I've had no problem downloading and burning standard Ubuntu and Windows XP discs. I get the error after putting in my keyboard layout. Third option out of all the ones the installing part of the installer gives I believe
2009-05-26T02:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	ALright.  Try the "Verify Disc Integrity" option at the boot menu.  Alternatively, you know you can easily move a regular Ubuntu install to Ubuntu Studio, right?  That is something we can do if we can't get this to work.
2009-05-26T02:28:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	When I do verify option, I get the same error
2009-05-26T02:29:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	The reason I'm trying to install Ubuntu Studio via disc is because when I did the upgrade, half of the programs it should have came with didn't come with it, and when I tried to add them, they didn't work.
2009-05-26T02:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	How did you do the upgrade?
2009-05-26T02:30:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	I followed a tutorial with various console commands
2009-05-26T02:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	Which tutorial?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/UpgradingFromHardy  should work.  They don't seem to have an updated one, but that should still be accurate for Jaunty
2009-05-26T02:33:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	I believe that is exactly what I used
2009-05-26T02:34:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	Yet, according to Wikipedia anyway, I should have gotten Synfig as a built in program, but I didn't. When I tried to put the program on myself, it wouldn't load. The video editing program did not load either, and neither did Blender
2009-05-26T02:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	Alright.  You'll have to ask #ubuntustudio, Its obviously wonky
2009-05-26T02:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Teundusia	there must be something else you're missing, or have to do or something
2009-05-26T02:37:00.000Z	Teundusia	Flannel	Alright. Thanks.
