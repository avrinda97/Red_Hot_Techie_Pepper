2009-04-07T11:16:00.000Z	austin987		my script has, e.g., "OS=`uname -o` || OS=`uname -s`" to determine the OS it's on
2009-04-07T11:16:00.000Z	austin987		the script is used on Ubuntu/*BSD/Solaris
2009-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	austin987		but the '||' confuses Ubuntu (but only recently?)
2009-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	are you sure it's the || that is causing trouble? I thought that was pretty basic
2009-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	austin987	Slart	"daily.sh: 1: Syntax error: "||" unexpected"
2009-04-07T11:18:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	can you pastebin the 10 or so lines around that line?
2009-04-07T11:19:00.000Z	austin987	Slart	http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn-history/r424/trunk/build_script/daily.sh
2009-04-07T11:20:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	I just tried a small test here using dash and || works fine as far as I can tell
2009-04-07T11:20:00.000Z	austin987	Slart	hmm. thanks. Not sure what the problem is then...
2009-04-07T11:21:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	you wrote this script yourself?
2009-04-07T11:21:00.000Z	austin987	Slart	yes
2009-04-07T11:22:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	one thing to check would be if the assignment really returns some kind of error code
2009-04-07T11:23:00.000Z	austin987	Slart	good idea, sec
2009-04-07T11:24:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	I just ran a small script with the offending line and the one after that.. works nicely here.. no errors
2009-04-07T11:24:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	it works no matter if I run it as "bash test.sh" "dash test.sh" or "sh test.sh"
2009-04-07T11:30:00.000Z	austin987	Slart	you were right
2009-04-07T11:30:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	ahh... tricky
2009-04-07T11:32:00.000Z	Slart	austin987	you're welcome
