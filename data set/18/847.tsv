2011-09-29T02:31:00.000Z	abjjdks832		I think linux has some workarounds to use > 4gB RAM in 32bit systems
2011-09-29T02:31:00.000Z	abjjdks832		"better" is highly subjective
2011-09-29T02:33:00.000Z	abjjdks832		last time I tried to get flash working on 64bit it was a nightmare
2011-09-29T02:34:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	ah ive had flash working fine
2011-09-29T03:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	yes you can do, but if ubuntu is a clean install anyway.. if it was me id just install from xubuntu livecd
2011-09-29T03:06:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	compile anything with make -j30
2011-09-29T03:07:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	if its just to test for a crash then f@h is a waste of time
2011-09-29T03:29:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	and then it freezes :)
2011-09-29T03:34:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	j30 just maxes your cpu
2011-09-29T03:37:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	no its j1 or j2
2011-09-29T03:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	but if you have dual core general rule is j4, quad is j5 etc
2011-09-29T03:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	j3 *
2011-09-29T03:41:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	lol @ load average
2011-09-29T03:44:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	the only way youll tell is normal real usage
2011-09-29T03:58:00.000Z	Gentoo64	abjjdks832	theres no harm, at all, in enabling and using it
