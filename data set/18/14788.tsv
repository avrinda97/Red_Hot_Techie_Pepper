2005-06-21T12:20:00.000Z	Trixsey		I still cant load perl plugins
2005-06-21T12:20:00.000Z	Trixsey		maybe something is wrong with my perl plugin?
2005-06-21T12:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		it consists of a bunch of IRC::command "/server ...."; and IRC::command "/join #..."
2005-06-21T12:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		synd,you know?
2005-06-21T12:22:00.000Z	Trixsey		still doesnt work :(
2005-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		I want to be able to auto-run commands on load
2005-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		thats all
2005-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		im not gonna manually type like 30 commands each time I load X-Chat
2005-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		seems like a waste of time
2005-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		when I can make a script that does that shit for me
2005-06-21T12:24:00.000Z	justin	Trixsey	uh, try LOOKING in the xchat preferences, it can connect to servers and join channels for you without any stupid plugins
2005-06-21T12:25:00.000Z	Trixsey	justin	I need to join like 20 channels.. and then I need a ton of ident commands and stuff
2005-06-21T12:25:00.000Z	justin	Trixsey	http://www.xchat.org/files/screenshots/xchat_screen_2.png
2005-06-21T12:25:00.000Z	Trixsey	justin	ok? I see a server list?
2005-06-21T12:26:00.000Z	justin	Trixsey	edit?
2005-06-21T12:27:00.000Z	Trixsey	justin	where do I run ident and invite commands for instance?
2005-06-21T12:27:00.000Z	justin	Trixsey	that's a different story. irssi makes that easy, dunno about xchat
2005-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	Trixsey	justin	it'd be easy if they wrote a proper API, not just a few commands
