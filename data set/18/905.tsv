2012-08-06T08:40:00.000Z	bfig		hello, i'm having trouble with alsa and my mic. i believe the computer cries at the fact that i have hdmi output too, so it appears as if i had two cards. any ideas about what could be going on?
2012-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	bfig		i don't have gnome-alsaconfig
2012-08-06T08:42:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	hmmm
2012-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	i think you can run gnome-alsaconfig and disable the other one
2012-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	there are ways to disable hdmi i just don't remember how... have to mess with some /etc files google disabling hdmi 12.04 or something like that
2012-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	install it with apt-get
2012-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	bfig	aaas	but the thing is this, i dont' know if this is the problem. do you have an intuition that it is?
2012-08-06T08:42:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	i know i've had problems with that before too, but i'm not certain either
2012-08-06T08:43:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	but if you don't use hdmi you can disable it to make sure
2012-08-06T08:43:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	in dealing with these problems if you don't have any log errors or errors to help you along the way the only real thing you can do is try things to get more info
2012-08-06T08:44:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	if you disable hdmi and it works great, if not at least you know it's not that
2012-08-06T08:44:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	your monitor doesn' have a builtin mic does it?
2012-08-06T08:46:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	ah, what makes you think it's hdmi then, do you have something plugged into hdmi?
2012-08-06T08:48:00.000Z	bfig	aaas	well, it doesn't show anything... and i have hdmi sound whenever i connect the hdmi port...
2012-08-06T08:49:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	ah it was gnome-alsamixer if you want to disable hdmi (i think it will let you disable)
2012-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	are you running debian or ubuntu?
2012-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	i can *try* and help
2012-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	aaas	bfig	ill msg you
