2009-03-01T06:28:00.000Z	nbenton		Ok, so I'm having my ubuntu server running an ftp server
2009-03-01T06:28:00.000Z	nbenton		and have created a user, who's home directory is /var/www/
2009-03-01T06:28:00.000Z	nbenton		when I upload files via ftp, I have to manually chmod everything
2009-03-01T06:28:00.000Z	nbenton		for exmaple, I have to chmod index.html for it to be viewed publicly.
2009-03-01T06:29:00.000Z	nbenton		How can I set up the server so that I don't have to manually chmod every little file?
2009-03-01T06:30:00.000Z	nbenton		I don't think it has to do with the ftp dameon, I think it has something to do with the chmodding of the /var/www/ folder, no?
2009-03-01T06:30:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	tell us the problem you're having, first.
2009-03-01T06:31:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	what WERE the permissions on index.html?
2009-03-01T06:32:00.000Z	nbenton	Huufarted	xxx
2009-03-01T06:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	xxx?  It needs to be 644...
2009-03-01T06:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	that's your problem
2009-03-01T06:33:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	it is not a script so it should not be executable.  And with no read nobody can read it.  How did it get to 111 permissions?
2009-03-01T06:34:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	how did they get to ---x--x--x?
2009-03-01T06:34:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	did you save the files directly on the server or did you FTP them to the server?
2009-03-01T06:34:00.000Z	nbenton	Huufarted	it just happens when I upload it via ftp through the user account I created to be assigned to /var/www/ as their home directory
2009-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	nbenton	Huufarted	ftped them
2009-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	Huufarted	nbenton	edit /etc/vsftpd.conf and look for the umask setting.  I recommend 022
2009-03-01T07:07:00.000Z	nbenton	Huufarted	your suggestion worked.
