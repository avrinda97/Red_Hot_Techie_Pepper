2010-01-03T14:33:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	i half suspect i'd throw together my own varient of ubuntu if i get a netbook ;p. UNR looks kinda toyish, and i think something like openbox and the bare necesities would be nice
2010-01-03T14:35:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	I've used "full desktop" Ubuntus on my netbooks, but find the UNR interface to be preferrable on small screens because it is, essentially, just a giant "tasty menu".
2010-01-03T14:36:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	I don't usually see my desktop so... i think i'd want something like this ;p https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1111219/Lobotomy%20screenshots/stuff.png (guake, openbox, swiftfox... when everything is closed, its a blank screen unless you rightclick to get the menu open) ;p
2010-01-03T14:38:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	I don't think I would feel efficient with that sort of interface.
2010-01-03T14:38:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	its a non interface ;p
2010-01-03T15:16:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	Pentium M 1.4. no hard drive. 256 mb disk. i used to run kubuntu on it before the hard drive died ;p
2010-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	I'm talking current hardware only. I'm not counting the old 386-33 that I compiled my first linux kernel for me.
2010-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	oh, is current. I just run it off a flashdrive now ;p
2010-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	iirc the livecd uses gparted right?
2010-01-03T15:20:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	yes, but it seems to not be as full-featured. Or maybe it just has a more noob-friendly interface.
2010-01-03T15:41:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	they really need to have ethernet cabling standard in houses, like power ;p
2010-01-03T15:41:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	I agree!
2010-01-03T15:42:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	I ought to invest in a nice -n router, if I could only pick one to buy, since 1/2 of the networkable appliances in the house already have -n cards in them.
2010-01-03T15:43:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	well allegedly the fiber internet modems come with an AP. if they do, i can convert my DDWRT to a bridge.
2010-01-03T15:47:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	Both of my wireless routers reliably run dd-wrt and are rock solid for me. One handles the house, the other one bridges the main signal into a throttled -b free net for the cul-de-sac. Mostly so I can sit on the lawn in the summer.
2010-01-03T15:48:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	i have a WRT54GL (which is what i recommend to people) and a di 524 (which i got free from a client who hated it)
2010-01-03T15:50:00.000Z	AK_Dave	faileas	I like the WRT54G series. I have 2 of them myself. I'm considering adding a 610. Its a 610 or a 400.
2010-01-03T15:50:00.000Z	faileas	AK_Dave	i hope they have a ipv6 capable version though. It would save me some headache ;p
