2008-01-18T04:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	Please dont repeat quite so often..  If someone knows they will answer... Posting every 30 seconds will just get you ignored by most users
2008-01-18T04:51:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks. Ie trying for so long and this is my first time here
2008-08-06T01:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	It is often better to tell us what you are trying to install manually or from unsupported repos
2009-01-07T20:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	How was it installed?
2009-01-07T20:10:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	apt-get install package
2009-01-07T20:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	apt-get remove package ...   Hopefully you have not modified your sources.list
2009-01-07T20:13:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	My problem is that I changed the code of a game, but it is not working as desired so I want to install the original again. What do you mean with "Hopefully you have not modified the source list"?
2009-01-07T20:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	What game
2009-01-07T20:14:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	xgalaga, I originarily installed it via apt-get.
2009-01-07T20:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	 Use synaptic to purge - remove it then reinstall
2009-01-07T20:27:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	It does not work, even though I removed xgalaga with synanptic and installed with apt-get, I still have the version I installed from source code.
2009-01-07T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	That was the first question I asked you.. How was it installed..
2009-01-07T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	You said with apt-get..  Now you say from source
2009-01-07T20:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcelo	Sorry.. dont have time to help you
2009-01-07T20:31:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	Sorry, I installed it first with apt-get then I downloaded the source with apt-get source, changed the source run make and make install.
2009-01-07T20:37:00.000Z	marcelo	Jack_Sparrow	I installed it first with apt-get then I downloaded the source with apt-get source, changed the source run make and make install.
