2009-11-04T10:15:00.000Z	Barridus		can anyone get me sorted on the syntax of using umount to unmount a network resource that's mounted to (at least according to nautilus) ~/.gvfs/media on 10.0.0.10  ?  i don't understand the docs D:
2009-11-04T10:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	If you mount it via gvfs ( nautilus ) you need to unmount it via gvfs
2009-11-04T10:18:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	does that mean i can't use a terminal command, but must use nautilus?
2009-11-04T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	There is probably a way to do it via ther terminal but I don't know what that is
2009-11-04T10:18:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	me neither XD
2009-11-04T10:20:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	the issue i have is that a home backup script yanks the contents of a 2tb network share if i forget to unmount it first.  i'd like to be able to have a umount command or equivalent in the script as a safety net
2009-11-04T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	You should make your script stay within a single file system
2009-11-04T10:21:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	it runs a series of rsync commands
2009-11-04T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	rsync can stay within a file system
2009-11-04T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	It can also exclude directories
2009-11-04T10:22:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	but doesn't gvfs fuse throw that off?
2009-11-04T10:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	No, .gvfs is another filesystem
2009-11-04T10:22:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	yeah i tried to exclude ~/.gvfs but it didn't seem to work, i must not understand what i'm reading on doc sites
2009-11-04T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	--one-file-system for rsync
2009-11-04T10:26:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	ok i'll try that now and see, thanks
2009-11-04T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	np
2009-11-04T10:29:00.000Z	Barridus	Jordan_U	wow that was great!  don't know how i overlooked that flag (if it was in the docs i read anyways).  thanks, you just saved me a ton of grief
2009-11-04T10:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Barridus	np, it was in the ( very long ) man page, I had the advantage of knowing what to look for :)
