2007-12-18T07:22:00.000Z	RoDoX		on Ubuntu? how????
2007-12-18T07:23:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	sudo apt-get install deluge gtk-gnutella
2007-12-18T07:23:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	that will get you Gnutella and torrent clients
2007-12-18T07:26:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	Azureus and Frostwire require complete JVMs, as well as some Linux-fu to get them where they need to be stored and permissions set
2007-12-18T07:26:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	if you're a new Linux user, Java apps are not your best bet
2007-12-18T07:27:00.000Z	RoDoX	mneptok	agreed...but i got every java-lib required, i am sure
2007-12-18T07:27:00.000Z	RoDoX	mneptok	i think this is a bug
2007-12-18T07:28:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	why not just use a native Linux Gnutella client?
2007-12-18T07:28:00.000Z	RoDoX	mneptok	native? on ubuntu? you must be talking about bittorrent
2007-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	no, i'm talking about Gnutella
2007-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	sudo apt-get install gtk-gnutella
2007-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	RoDoX	mneptok	is it that simple-to-use or is it gonna ask me some port-to-open config?
2007-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	it's as simple as Frostwire
2007-12-18T07:30:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	just different. so expect to spend a little time learning how it works.
2007-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	RoDoX	mneptok	sudo apt-get install deluge gtk-gnutella - are you sure its "deluge"?
2007-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	Deluge is a native BitTorrent client
2007-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	RoDoX	mneptok	got it..duuh
2007-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	mneptok	RoDoX	i *thought* it was in the repos. i guess i'm a bit early. :/
