2008-10-31T08:34:00.000Z	asdfma1		is it possible to cancel a package download part way through, while still installing the packages that were already downloaded, as long as their deps were downloaded too?
2008-10-31T08:36:00.000Z	asdfma1		bummer
2008-10-31T08:36:00.000Z	asdfma1		it has taken all day to get this far, but there are still 2 more hours to go in downloading time
2008-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	asdfma1		nice
2008-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	asdfma1		unattended, bullgard4?
2008-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	asdfma1		oh neato
2008-10-31T08:38:00.000Z	asdfma1		is it possible to have it find faster downloads?  it averages at 60kB/s
2008-10-31T08:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	everyone and their dog is attempting to download/upgrade Ubuntu at this minute...
2008-10-31T08:39:00.000Z	asdfma1	Madpilot	why is that?
2008-10-31T08:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	um... because the new shiny just came out and everyone wants it?
2008-10-31T08:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	away from release times, the Ubuntu repositories are pretty fast. At release time, not so much.
2008-10-31T08:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	today
2008-10-31T08:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	not set up for that
2008-10-31T08:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	apt-torrent would be kind of cool, though.
2008-10-31T08:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	you can do an upgrade in place
2008-10-31T08:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	no, it's the GUI that manages updates & upgrades
2008-10-31T08:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	asdfma1	System->About Ubuntu will give you a version number/name
