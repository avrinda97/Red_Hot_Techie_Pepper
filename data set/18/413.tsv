2012-05-08T23:01:00.000Z	wormmd		Bigger problem: apparently GRUB is no longer installed, though I know it has to be because I just booted from it a few hours ago. grub --version tells me that grub isn't installed.
2012-05-08T23:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	grub2 doesn't have a "grub" command. Try "grub-install --version".
2012-05-08T23:02:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	roger, brb
2012-05-08T23:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	And whatever you do, do *not* apt-get install grub (as that will remove grub2 and install grub legacy).
2012-05-08T23:03:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	1.99-2ubuntu-3
2012-05-08T23:03:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	Or something similar.
2012-05-08T23:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	Looks good.
2012-05-08T23:03:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	does grub2 no longer have a grub.conf or menu.lst?
2012-05-08T23:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	Change grub2 settings in /etc/default/grub, then update the /boot/grub/grub.cfg by running "sudo update-grub".
2012-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	I found the /etc/default/grub file, tried sudo grub-mkconfig or some such instead of sudo update-grub.
2012-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	"sudo update-grub" is the same as "sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg".
2012-05-08T23:06:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	I'm at a remote location so I don't want to muck with it and restart yet, but I'll check it out later this afternoon.
2012-05-08T23:06:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	I didn't pass an output file argument earlier, I wonder where that conf file got written...
2012-05-08T23:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	To stdout :)
2012-05-08T23:06:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	Oops :)
2012-05-08T23:07:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	Well, my office is unlocked at the remote location, I might go over the documentation REALLY WELL and just have someone go in and fix it if it breaks :)
2012-05-08T23:09:00.000Z	wormmd	Jordan_U	speaking of which, thanks for the help :)
2012-05-08T23:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wormmd	You're welcome :)
