2011-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	Giles		At the login screen I have options "ubuntu, ubuntu classic, ubuntu classic (no effects), custom"
2011-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	milen8204	Giles	I think you have to install drivers for your video card
2011-04-30T13:49:00.000Z	Giles	milen8204	I removed the nvidia-current package, because it usually causes problems with my non nvidia card...
2011-04-30T13:49:00.000Z	milen8204	Giles	I had a problems whit ubuntu starting when I updated to 11.04

2011-04-30T13:50:00.000Z	milen8204	Giles	and then I updated nvidia drives and the Unity started.\
2011-04-30T13:50:00.000Z	Giles	milen8204	so where did the "desktop effects" tab go in the classic desktop...
2011-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	milen8204	Giles	it works whit a notice for me I have chose classic desctop
2011-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	Giles	milen8204	yes, the first time I logged in it said that my hardware doesn't support unity.
