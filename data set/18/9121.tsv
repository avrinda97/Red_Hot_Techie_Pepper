2010-07-01T09:45:00.000Z	anathematic		I'm trying to fcsk something on ubuntu cd atm however it keeps saying device or resource is busy
2010-07-01T09:45:00.000Z	anathematic		I'm pretty sure it's not mounted at all - any recommendations?
2010-07-01T09:45:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	fsck? on a CD?
2010-07-01T09:45:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	what are you going to do if it finds filesystem errors?
2010-07-01T09:45:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 fsck the harddrive from ubuntu cd
2010-07-01T09:46:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	have you turned off swap?
2010-07-01T09:46:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	and what is the command you are using?
2010-07-01T09:46:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 I don't know, is there a way I can check? :-)
2010-07-01T09:46:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 sudo fsck /dev/sad
2010-07-01T09:46:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	you cannot fsck devices. only partitions
2010-07-01T09:47:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 well that would explain a bit
2010-07-01T09:47:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	sudo fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1 (or fsck.ext3 and /dev/sda2 or somesuch)
2010-07-01T09:47:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 how do I get a list of the partitions on the drive to access?
2010-07-01T09:47:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	ls /dev/sd*
2010-07-01T09:48:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 this won't delete any data wil it? :-)
2010-07-01T09:48:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	depends. if there are bad issues that need to be fixed, it may.
2010-07-01T10:20:00.000Z	mneptok	anathematic	is sda1 indeed ext3?
2010-07-01T10:20:00.000Z	anathematic	mneptok	 I assume so - I didn't set it up but it woudln't be anything other than default
