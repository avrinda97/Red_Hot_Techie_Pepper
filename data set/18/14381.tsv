2005-08-31T13:34:00.000Z	lJlolel		can i just apt-get install lilo and that will replace grub?
2005-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	lJlolel	You should apt-get remove grub first.
2005-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	lJlolel	But be afraid of mucking too much with the boot process.
2005-08-31T13:41:00.000Z	lJlolel	paulproteus	yea, i am a bit afraid, any major tips?
2005-08-31T13:43:00.000Z	paulproteus	lJlolel	Well, why stop using GRUB?
2005-08-31T13:44:00.000Z	lJlolel	paulproteus	grub wasnt loading my XP drive (lilo did ona  previous ubuntu install)
2005-08-31T13:44:00.000Z	paulproteus	lJlolel	Well, you could try configuring grub. :)
