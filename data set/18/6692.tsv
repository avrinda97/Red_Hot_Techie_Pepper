2008-04-10T04:20:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]	lewench	does it go down either way?
2008-04-10T04:20:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		Like if you turn your volume up or down?
2008-04-10T04:20:00.000Z	lewench	TeamColtra[NADC]	No, only the mic goes down. I was wondering if there is a configuration for this
2008-04-10T04:20:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		Wapko, thats what i am asking, is how I do that. :)
2008-04-10T04:21:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		Lewench, so instead of controlling your speaker  volume, it controlls your mic volume?
2008-04-10T04:21:00.000Z	lewench	TeamColtra[NADC]	Yes
2008-04-10T04:21:00.000Z	lewench		weird i know TeamColtra[NADC]
2008-04-10T04:22:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]	lewench	after you figure out... tell me, because controlling my mic volume is more important to me then speaker volume, and that would come in handy
2008-04-10T04:22:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		:) I *WISH* I had your error ;)
2008-04-10T04:22:00.000Z	lewench	TeamColtra[NADC]	hahaha ok
2008-04-10T04:22:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		Wapko, wow i wish i wasn't stupid >.<

2008-04-10T04:24:00.000Z	lewench		In this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD7QraljRfM after the drags a window and places is somewhere else there is like a ripple effect on the sides. Anyone know what that option is ???
2008-04-10T04:24:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		Lewench, Assuming you're using GNOME, you need to go into System>Preferences>Sound. At the bottom of that window there's a list. The mic will be selected. Change that to your speaker's channel (you may have to experiment to find the one. Names vary from card to card)
2008-04-10T04:24:00.000Z	lewench	TeamColtra[NADC]	Thanks a bunch!!!! now you know how to do it as well :-p
