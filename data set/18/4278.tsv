2010-08-06T17:21:00.000Z	xavieran		I'm trying to scan with my HP laserjet 3030 ... Ubuntu sees it, and I can print with it quite happily, but the scanning doesn't seem to work
2010-08-06T17:23:00.000Z	parapanghelescu	xavieran	> check the documentation of your scanner ....if the manufacturer does not provide a linux version for the scanner driver ....you will not be able to use-it ...
2010-08-06T17:25:00.000Z	xavieran	parapanghelescu	^^^
2010-08-06T17:27:00.000Z	parapanghelescu	xavieran	> i had the same issue at some point .....with Samsung SCX4300 .....apart from HPLIP driver which is a generic one , the device manufacturer should also provide a specific driver for linux in order to use the scanner option
2010-08-06T17:27:00.000Z	xavieran	parapanghelescu	Ok, I will google that then :)
2010-08-06T17:39:00.000Z	xavieran	parapanghelescu	That sounds fine, I've only got a few pages to scan ... and I use pdfsam to merge...
2010-08-06T17:40:00.000Z	parapanghelescu	xavieran	> pdfsam > is this any good > thanks for the tip bro'
2010-08-06T17:42:00.000Z	xavieran	parapanghelescu	It's a java app. Really useful for spiltting and merging pdf files... I have a phone that has a limmit to the size of pdfs, so I split them up with this app :)
2010-08-06T17:42:00.000Z	xavieran	parapanghelescu	apt-get install pdfsam
2010-08-06T17:42:00.000Z	xavieran	parapanghelescu	should do the job
2010-08-06T17:43:00.000Z	parapanghelescu	xavieran	> thanks I'll give it a try ....
