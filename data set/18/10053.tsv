2008-07-10T04:36:00.000Z	kkathman	unop	- lol reboot the ipod ??
2008-07-10T04:36:00.000Z	unop	kkathman	press Menu and the center button, and hold down for about 4 seconds
2008-07-10T04:37:00.000Z	unop	kkathman	that's how i reboot my ipod classic -- should work on the newer nanos and probably other ipods too
2008-07-10T04:39:00.000Z	kkathman	unop	 well I keep getting that No battery power remains - please hook the ipod to power - maybe thats part of the problem
2008-07-10T04:39:00.000Z	unop	kkathman	errm, that could very well be the problem -- charge it up for a bit, if you have an external power suplly
2008-07-10T04:41:00.000Z	kkathman	unop	, WallO  thanks - am charging it right now...will try again later... your help is much appreciated!
