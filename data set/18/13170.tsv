2010-09-07T02:38:00.000Z	donkeyy		but in a live udb you can save things right?
2010-09-07T02:38:00.000Z	flixil	donkeyy	you can save on the hard drive or if it was enabled on the usb itself

2010-09-07T02:39:00.000Z	donkeyy	mobasher	is it posible to enable it on the usb, so it will boot from the usb and pretty much run like the hardrive?
2010-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	donkeyy		or sorry flixil
2010-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	donkeyy		Yes it boots from the USB
2010-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	donkeyy		but its in LIVE Mode
2010-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	flixil	donkeyy	the app that you used to create (burn) the live usb should be able to enable space in it for documents and stuff
