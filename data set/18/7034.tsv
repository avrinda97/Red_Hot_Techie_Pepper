2008-03-14T18:54:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		OK my new problem. I have a hdd. how can i format it to NTFS from the ubuntu live dvd?
2008-03-14T18:55:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	why would you format it to NTFS ??
2008-03-14T18:55:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	Because i want to be able to access it from windows when i install windows
2008-03-14T18:55:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	format it to ext3 and dont use windows
2008-03-14T19:00:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	That's exactloy what i'm trying to do atm :P
2008-03-14T19:00:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	what ? move to linux ?
2008-03-14T19:00:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	No, format 2 1TB drives to NTFS from linux
2008-03-14T19:00:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?????
2008-03-14T19:01:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	So i can dual boot windows and linux and have my files readable in both OS's
2008-03-14T19:01:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	why do you need windows ?
2008-03-14T19:01:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	cause it's better than linux *initiate flame war here*
2008-03-14T19:02:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	well if that is what you think then go ahead and do it
2008-03-14T19:02:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	Heh, the reaosn is because i'm a Windows user converting to linux. I'm still not confident enough to use it 100% of the time
2008-03-14T19:02:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	but I can tell you I've been using PCs for about 19 years now and this has been the best move I ever made
2008-03-14T19:03:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	thats the problem. you dont want to learn :D
2008-05-14T16:34:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	in /etc/X11/
2008-05-14T16:35:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	mad_max02	Is that the file with the screen resolution stuff in it? I'm about to try to use the screen resolution thing and on gutsy it used to completely prawn my system
2008-05-14T16:35:00.000Z	mad_max02	Flynsarmy	yeah thats the one. Do a sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf in terminal
