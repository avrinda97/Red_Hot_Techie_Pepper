2010-12-22T22:09:00.000Z	spencer	alabala	a few things, 1 can you type the name of whoever you're responding to in front of your response. Are you sure your BIOS is set to boot from a CD?
2010-12-22T22:10:00.000Z	alabala	spencer	it`s all ok ... at start i see the unbuntu logo .. i see some dots ... a colored backgroud .. dots movin` ... then on my lcd i get the message no signal .. and stays like that
2010-12-22T22:10:00.000Z	spencer		hi coregrl, how can we help you?
2010-12-22T22:11:00.000Z	spencer	alabala	so on your only screen you see that the computer isn't sending any input. Is the computer still on? does the HDD rev up or down?
2010-12-22T22:12:00.000Z	alabala	spencer	the dvd rom sounds like ... it`s spinning .. but after a while stops spinning
2010-12-22T22:13:00.000Z	spencer		 alabala does the screen flicker and then shut off, like there's an error message? also, how much time do you give it?
2010-12-22T22:13:00.000Z	alabala	spencer	 no errors on screen, no flickering ... just like there`s no video imout .. i w8ted around 5 mins
2010-12-22T22:14:00.000Z	alabala	spencer	meanwhile there`s no signal on display the dvd still spins
2010-12-22T22:16:00.000Z	spencer	alabala	hmm... I'm thinking
2010-12-22T22:16:00.000Z	spencer	alabala	mind if I PM?
