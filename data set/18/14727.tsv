2005-07-07T15:11:00.000Z	qos		hey guys, is there anyone how can help my installing a bootsplash?
2005-07-07T06:22:00.000Z	qos		how can i make sure, that firefox only uses eth0 for data transfers?
2005-07-07T06:24:00.000Z	qos		i have 2 network interfaces, i can access the internet with both interfaces, but i want that firefox only uses ONE of them
2005-07-07T06:24:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	qos	: i think you should look into route
2005-07-07T06:24:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	qos	: but thats a very complicated question
2005-07-07T06:24:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		what do you use the other interface for?
2005-07-07T06:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		yeh route and iptables
2005-07-07T06:25:00.000Z	qos		damn, i hoped it can be solved like "firefox -i eth0"
2005-07-07T06:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		iptables might just be easier but you might need the route patch on iptables
2005-07-07T06:25:00.000Z	qos		both are connections to the internet, both with an own ip
2005-07-07T06:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	qos	: ask in the freenode firefox channel, ther might be something like that
2005-07-07T06:26:00.000Z	qos		hmm, i also wants to set the interface for other programms, like irc clients or instant messengers ...
2005-07-07T06:27:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	qos	: i got an idea, set squid up on your boxen to use eth0 and make squid the firefox proxy for all protocalls
2005-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	qos	: the question is, eth0 is for what, eth1 is for what?
2005-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	qos		egg, why do you think i am asking?
2005-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		since it might be easier to route add default gw ip_of_eth0 eth0
2005-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		and then to match what you want on eth1 only
2005-07-07T06:29:00.000Z	qos	lsuactiafner	: i dont know what to route exactly. imagine i want to make sure gaim only uses eth0
