2006-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	wrong ..
2006-06-08T05:20:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	Wow. WINE keeps suprising me!
2006-06-08T05:21:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	I find that there is little WINE can't run with some patience (like extracting CAB files manually, for instance) but I find stuff like FlashMX trial is just too slow to be usable (that is not being picky, it is SLOW)
2006-06-11T16:06:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	I found a script somewhere that when you right click on an iso, it says "mount ISO image"
2006-06-11T16:09:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	The best way for user-level mounting would be to somehow tell gnome-vulume-manager about the image
2006-06-11T16:11:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	I am unfamiliar with gnome-volume-manager, but being that I am very often on the command line and still wanting things to work .. [without X] 
2006-06-11T16:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	sudo apt-get install beneath-a-steel-sky
2006-06-11T16:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	Have you played Trigger?
2006-06-11T16:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	nope
2006-06-11T16:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	sounds like Kobo Deluxe
2006-06-11T16:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	I mean, the name reminded me of Kobo (a space shooter I love)
2006-06-11T16:31:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	Don't know that one. Trigger is a rally game where you have to drive into loads of rings in order
2006-06-11T16:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	I have played frozen bubble so much now that it is far too annoying to do the first levels again
2006-06-11T16:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	Have you played Crack Attack? It is great for multiplayer
2006-06-11T16:33:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	nope, haven't heard of that one
2006-06-11T16:34:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Warbo	oh !  I just remembered I wanted to try out Scorch 3D.  I used to love Scorched Earth for DOS (by Wendel Hicken), and saw screenshots of the 3D one some fan made, looked neat
2006-06-11T16:36:00.000Z	Warbo	Samus_Aran	They use that old arcade tactic which fools players "Do you want to continue?" which lets you carry on at whatever level, but your score goes back to zero and it is much harder to get a highscore because you have missed out all of the easy levels
