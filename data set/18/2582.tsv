2010-05-13T20:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	abuayyoub	roger . i like the song of course, and i like some world war ii type of battleground games. so i use it as my nick in those games, and here obviously :-)
2010-05-13T20:29:00.000Z	abuayyoub	onetinsoldier	 I am trying to set up my mic for Skype, but for some reason it's not working. Alsamixer showed mic was muted. unmuted but still nothing. Any suggestions? Says it's using pulseaudio not sure if that has to be unmuted as well... The mic is built in on my lappy BTW
2010-05-13T20:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	abuayyoub	don't know. don't know about mic settings.. sorry
2010-05-13T20:30:00.000Z	abuayyoub	onetinsoldier	in skype settings it says for microphone its PulseAudio Server (local)
