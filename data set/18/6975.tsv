2008-02-25T23:41:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin		 does anybody know why whwn i run a fullscreen application, x server restart and apppears login screen?
2008-02-25T23:41:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	one application in particular, or any application that can be maximised?
2008-02-25T23:42:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	graft: no particular application, every app which use fullscreen mode (such a game, a space explorer...)
2008-02-25T23:43:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	any clues at the end of /var/log/xorg.log?
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	no, there's no any archive called xorg.con in this directory
2008-02-25T23:46:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	xorg.log, in /var/log/
2008-02-25T23:50:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	check this: http://pastebin.com/m4a2a55e
2008-02-25T23:51:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	line 808 looks like you might have found a bug to me
2008-02-25T23:52:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	hahaha, the second bug I found, xdxd
2008-02-25T23:53:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	and now what? report on launchpad or in x webpage?
2008-02-25T23:53:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	dunno what ubuntu standard is, I only had ubuntu for 3 days (gentoo nut)
2008-02-25T23:54:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	ok, but it's a bug or not?
2008-02-25T23:55:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	its a bug, undefined symbol is an error in the source
2008-02-25T23:55:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	ok, will you report this?
2008-02-25T23:56:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	as I said, I have no clue about ubuntu bug reporting, since its your bug, you need to do it
2008-02-25T23:56:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	dont worry about it, worst that happens is they tell you its not a bug and close it
2008-02-25T23:57:00.000Z	chocolatewithmin	Squawk	ok, only a thing, if a report this, should I copy entire log?
2008-02-25T23:57:00.000Z	Squawk	chocolatewithmin	I dunno, there will be a help page associated with the bug report, see what it says
