2008-10-20T04:37:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	gwkalrod	Seems so easy this way. The film came on I clicked play and it's playing. Is it recording it anywhere while its playing?
2008-10-20T04:40:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	gwkalrod	Is this the customize box: It says vd:///dev/scd0 what does this mean?
2008-10-20T04:50:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	gwkalrod	I looked in the directory and nothing is there? Should it be there already after 2 minutes?
2008-10-20T04:58:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	gwkalrod	Slowly getting there thks, but a few hiccups. I am selecting a directory OK as you said but can't find anywhere click OK, I have to use the X at the top right of the page. Cant find OK at the open disc menu either?
2008-10-20T05:00:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	gwkalrod	Thks a lot. Can I burn it to DVD with VLC?
2008-10-20T05:02:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	gwkalrod	OK I could try k3b or Gnomebaker perhaps. Would I click DAta DVD??
