2012-09-23T06:05:00.000Z	rgenito		yes, trying to mount an aes256 disk image

2012-09-23T06:09:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	do you have loop-aes-utils installed?
2012-09-23T06:09:00.000Z	rgenito		no i do not... but now i shall install it....
2012-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	rgenito		i wish there was a way to automatically create a directory when mounting to a new directory that doesn't exist.... is there a way?
2012-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	rgenito	ring2	awesome btw... that helped. but now i get "password must be at least 20 characters" @_@
2012-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	i think, you always have to create the directory first. i could be wrong
2012-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	sorry, i don't know about the password error
2012-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	rgenito	ring2	ah ok...that's what i figured. anyhoo, i'm still unable to mount... need to dig deeper. ty for that suggestion
2012-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	is your password >20 characters?
2012-09-23T06:17:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	as i read, loop-aes really requires at least 20 characters. doesn't seem to have a workaround :(
2012-09-23T06:18:00.000Z	rgenito	ring2	damn, that sucks... because my password is not 20 characters :(
2012-09-23T06:19:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	if you find a workaround, let me know .)
2012-09-23T06:19:00.000Z	rgenito	ring2	do you also have encrypted dmg's? :)
2012-09-23T06:19:00.000Z	rgenito		if i find a work around... i'm gunna post it online too haha
2012-09-23T06:20:00.000Z	ring2	rgenito	no, i don't. i'm just curious :)
