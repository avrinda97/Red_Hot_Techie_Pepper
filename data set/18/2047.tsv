2010-09-06T20:35:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	Hi
2010-09-06T20:38:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	which type of menu do you want? Do you have something in mind?
2010-09-06T20:39:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	I am trying to recall a nice menu, but I don 't remember its name yet
2010-09-06T20:40:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	do you have the name of those desktops?
2010-09-06T20:41:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	sure
2010-09-06T20:41:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	ok
2010-09-06T20:45:00.000Z	dreux	cedriczg	this one http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/xl_Monochrome?content=91399
2010-09-06T20:47:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	well, that's actually a drop down menu look
2010-09-06T20:47:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	a theme
2010-09-06T20:48:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	I thought you wanted a menu that would not be the common drop down for applications
2010-09-06T20:51:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	One way to install that theme would be to download the theme package. Then go to system > appearence > click on install on theme tab. And select the package you downloaded
2010-09-06T21:09:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	no issues. did you get to see my suggestion?
2010-09-06T21:11:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	what went wrong?
2010-09-06T21:13:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	so you downloaded the theme already?
2010-09-06T21:15:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	and you get the error once you try to install the package through the appearence interface, right?
2010-09-06T21:22:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	oh, ok. I see. I didn 't know you were trying that
2010-09-06T21:28:00.000Z	cedriczg	dreux	your welcome. Have a good lunch. Bye
