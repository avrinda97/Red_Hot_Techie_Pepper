2007-09-19T09:12:00.000Z	stefg	ziga_	please don do that again. Rather check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf if the v4l module gets loaded
2007-09-19T09:17:00.000Z	ziga_	stefg	I copy and paste the v4l-conf report, did you see it
2007-09-19T09:23:00.000Z	stefg	ziga_	what kind of video card do you have ?
2007-09-19T09:24:00.000Z	ziga_	stefg	ati 9600 pro
2007-09-19T09:24:00.000Z	stefg	ziga_	then it's likely that the 'xv' doesn't work
2007-09-19T09:26:00.000Z	stefg	ziga_	what does glxinfo | grep direct tell ?
2007-09-19T09:28:00.000Z	ziga_	stefg	I will post that here, because that's only 2 lines
2007-09-19T09:28:00.000Z	stefg	ziga_	hmm.... so that might be ATI related trouble. I'm no good at troubleshooting ATI
