2011-07-18T03:58:00.000Z	minus_		Hi! I started recording a video from my webcam with mencoder. I accidentaly turned it off with ctrl-z instead of ctrl-c. This resulted in mencoder not "unloading?" the webcam. So the webcam is now stuck and mencoder says that its busy.
2011-07-18T03:59:00.000Z	minus_		I tried to rmmod the driver. But it reported that it was in use.
2011-07-18T03:59:00.000Z	minus_		Is there a way to undo this without a reboot?
2011-07-18T03:59:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	type "fg"
2011-07-18T03:59:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	ctl-z suspended process in background

2011-07-18T04:03:00.000Z	minus_	yagoo	Is there a way to put programs in the background wihtout suspending them?
2011-07-18T04:04:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	if u typed ctl-z, you can type "bg %#" (# as for the number from the jobs list)
2011-07-18T04:04:00.000Z	minus_	yagoo	I actually looked in top to see if mencoder was stuck in something. But I guess I didn't look hard enough :P
2011-07-18T04:04:00.000Z	minus_	yagoo	th0r: I'll try that out.
2011-07-18T04:05:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	i believe u can type "bg <command>" as well...
2011-07-18T04:05:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	no.. "help" is a bash-only builtin for referencing its builtins
2011-07-18T04:07:00.000Z	minus_	yagoo	3653 rows. Now that is something :D
2011-07-18T04:08:00.000Z	minus_	yagoo	too bad mplayer had 6758 rows :P
2011-07-18T04:08:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	/usr/share/doc/packagename is also locations where there can be examples for example -- (mencoder package is it?-- /usr/share/doc/mencoder)
2011-07-18T04:20:00.000Z	yagoo	minus_	i think he was trolling
