2010-04-15T22:18:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	it's ok
2010-04-15T22:08:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	perhaps some rewording...
2010-04-15T22:08:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	I can help
2010-04-15T22:09:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	there's a live disk called Gparted
2010-04-15T22:11:00.000Z	schweegi	millertimek1a2m3	yes, i know ..i must start from it. but how can i put the windows installation completly to the second drive without a reinstall of it? i don't like to install ubuntu again because lucid lynx are there in 14 days..
2010-04-15T22:13:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	well, you could do a ghost image of the windows partition, and then intsall that image at the location where you want windows
2010-04-15T22:14:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	I mean grub-restore
2010-04-15T22:14:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	yes what Losha said is most likely true...
2010-04-15T22:15:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	i mean, if you relocate windows you ahve to think about what kind of change you will need to do on youmbr
2010-04-15T22:16:00.000Z	schweegi	millertimek1a2m3	yes.. the MBR should be at the first drive i think because its the primary disc where GRUB is located. the second drive which is smaller than the first is completly for windows, the first completly for ubuntu
2010-04-15T22:16:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	man I'm sorry I don't know what you're talking about
2010-04-15T22:17:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	I will definitely help you the best i can, but I don't feel that I fully understand everything that you're trying to do
2010-04-15T22:17:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	and I don't want to give advice that is bad
2010-04-15T22:17:00.000Z	schweegi	millertimek1a2m3	i know that my english is not the best.. sorry
2010-04-15T22:19:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	the best thing to do to keep yourself from having to retell the story on the server
2010-04-15T22:19:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	is make a post, and when you ask you question here, give a link to the post
2010-04-15T22:19:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	schweegi	you could either make your post at ubuntuforums or on a pastebin.com or something
2010-04-15T22:20:00.000Z	schweegi	millertimek1a2m3	okay
