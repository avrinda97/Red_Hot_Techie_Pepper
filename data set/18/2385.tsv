2010-05-30T13:12:00.000Z	Semperfi30		Hello
2010-05-30T13:13:00.000Z	Semperfi30		Is this the right place to come for Ubuntu Support? Or is there a specific Support channel
2010-05-30T13:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 'official ubuntu support channel' is here.
2010-05-30T13:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 you should at least state the issue first
2010-05-30T13:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 its configurable :) you can set it to rember the last if you wanted
2010-05-30T13:24:00.000Z	Semperfi30	Dr_Willis	I think the dude made it that way for me then
2010-05-30T13:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 very possible
2010-05-30T13:24:00.000Z	Semperfi30	Dr_Willis	Which makes things pretty convenient, I like the Grub loader a hell of alot better than what was there before. I guess windows boot manager
2010-05-30T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 how come you dont have admin rights now?
2010-05-30T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 upgrading would download some 600mb of stuff..
2010-05-30T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 for all you know a clean install might fix that.
2010-05-30T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 sounds like youmay need to try some different ubuntu mirrors
2010-05-30T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 ubuntu uses cd's by default
2010-05-30T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 or a bootable flash drife is handy also.
2010-05-30T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 it fits on 1 cd.
2010-05-30T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 if you got an old cd thats that old smaller size..then you are out of luck
2010-05-30T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 use unetbootin to make a bootable flash drive. its a handy tool.
2010-05-30T13:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Semperfi30	 you have to BOOT from the flash drive.. i doubt if the library will want you to do that
