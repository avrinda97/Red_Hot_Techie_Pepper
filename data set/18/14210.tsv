2007-06-30T08:25:00.000Z	riddlebox		hrmm, I installed apache and php5, but when I click on a test php file I have firefox wants me to download the file instead of viewing it
2007-06-30T08:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	Check the wiki page on a LAMP setup.
2007-06-30T08:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	I think you haven't got the apache-php5 module, or something
2007-06-30T08:26:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	 ok thanks
2007-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	I have everything installed that the wiki says to install and it is still wanting me to download the file?
2007-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	Sorry, who are you and what problem are you having?
2007-06-30T08:40:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	I asked a question a few minutes ago about php and apache, when I go to my test php file, firefox wants to download the file not view it
2007-06-30T08:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	Restart apache.
2007-06-30T08:41:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	I have tried that as well
2007-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	I got it working, I cleared the cache in firefox and refreshed and it started to work
2007-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php4 && sudo a2enmod php5 && sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2007-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	php4 should be php5
2007-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	I got it working, I cleared the cache in firefox and refreshed and it started to work
2007-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	Goodo :)
2007-10-29T03:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	mv *.conf *.sample ?
2007-10-29T03:55:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	can you use wildcards like that?
2007-10-29T03:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	riddlebox	Yep
2007-10-29T03:56:00.000Z	riddlebox	Stormx2	I just tried and it didnt work
