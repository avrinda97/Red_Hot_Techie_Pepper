2009-05-07T03:33:00.000Z	mibzzer15		error 21, booting ubuntu and windows
2009-05-07T03:34:00.000Z	ikonia	mibzzer15	ok - that means the partition that the options in /boot/grub/menu.lst are pointing at the wrong partitions
2009-05-07T03:34:00.000Z	mibzzer15	ikonia	okey dokey, what can i do to fix?
2009-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	ikonia	mibzzer15	you need to boot either boot a livecd and mount /boot from your install to play with menu.lust and change the partitions to the correct options (you'll find them in device.map in your boot/grub directory)
2009-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	ikonia	mibzzer15	or you'll need to edit the grub menu directly - which is more complex
2009-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	ikonia	mibzzer15	do you get the grub menu ?
2009-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	mibzzer15	ikonia	i am a noob to this, so it there a manual or something that says what i can do?
2009-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	ikonia		!grub > mibzzer15
