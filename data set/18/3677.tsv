2009-09-15T03:58:00.000Z	scott_ino2		anyone know why i get permission denied (using sudo) when i do echo min_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy
2009-09-15T03:58:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	let me try the command
2009-09-15T03:59:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	ty
2009-09-15T04:00:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	make sure you don't keep that permanant on yoru box, wouldn't want you breaking things
2009-09-15T04:00:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	didn't work for me either.  You probably need to be logged in as root to do it
2009-09-15T04:01:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	probably, like you said, to keep users from breaking the system
2009-09-15T04:01:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	impossible?
2009-09-15T04:01:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	well.. not impossible
2009-09-15T04:02:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	i'll just have to put it in acpi/acd.d instead i suppose
2009-09-15T04:02:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	thankfully permission was denied for me :)
2009-09-15T04:03:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	well i figured you kinda knew what you were getting yourself into ;-)
2009-09-15T04:05:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	I figured it probably wouldn't work for me either :)
2009-09-15T04:05:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	I've been running with my battery removed
2009-09-15T04:05:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	yeah im just gonna break down and buy solid state and get a new battery since it's under warranty
2009-09-15T04:06:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	I was thinking of getting solid state, but I don't really need it, and don't have money to spend on things that I don't really need
2009-09-15T04:08:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	the prices have come down a lot though... maybe soon
2009-09-26T01:47:00.000Z	seidos	scott_ino2	open firmware?  where?
2009-09-26T01:47:00.000Z	scott_ino2	seidos	google dd-wrt, tomato firmware
