2007-02-24T17:14:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		an update, I made the assumption i was getting this busybox error due to my SATA drive... probablly wrong so i am now testing an IDE drive
2007-02-24T17:16:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		ayri feekon
2007-02-24T17:18:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		has anyone been able to install ubuntu on a SATA drive and using dual DVI video card?
2007-02-24T17:18:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	Same here; with dual monitors.
2007-02-24T17:24:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	You are having a problem with the matrox.
2007-02-24T17:25:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	Oh. That's interesting.
2007-02-24T17:29:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	Are only running the 1 SATA drive? http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=474493
2007-02-24T17:29:00.000Z	bigjohntoday	gyaresu	yes only one but now i switched to IDE to see if that would work
2007-02-24T17:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	I reckon it will...
2007-02-24T17:32:00.000Z	bigjohntoday	gyaresu	I can install main OS on IDE and use the SATA as a mounted secondary storage drive right, shouldn't have any problems doing that should I?
2007-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	Should be able to use the SATA... Maybe it's a kernel problem.
2007-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	bigjohntoday	gyaresu	honestly as long as I can use something as for the OS and get this system up and running I wouldn't mind using 250g's for storage..... but if it does not work as well then i will be uterlly stumped!
2007-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	You can only try then. Have you tried a LiveCD to see if it can boot up and access the drive? Might help figure out what's missing.
2007-02-24T17:39:00.000Z	bigjohntoday	gyaresu	well it still didn't load now i am attempting to go into recovery mode
2007-02-24T17:39:00.000Z	bigjohntoday	gyaresu	I get a kernal panic, what do you think may be causing this?
2007-02-24T17:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	LiveCD? I'd give it a try.
2007-02-24T17:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	bigjohntoday	It can't find the primary drive I reckon...
