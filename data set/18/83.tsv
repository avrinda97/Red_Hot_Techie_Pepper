2012-09-29T00:08:00.000Z	Respite212		wilee: I still don't understand. I have 2 hard drives. sda and sdb. I was wondering if or how would I be able to install programs such as games to sdb instead of installing it to sda.
2012-09-29T00:09:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	you can, you just have to mount the partitions/directories correctly or set links
2012-09-29T00:09:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	(using suitable filesystems of course)
2012-09-29T00:09:00.000Z	Respite212	rumpe1	No clue on how to do that.
2012-09-29T00:10:00.000Z	Respite212		wilee: huh?
2012-09-29T00:10:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	first try to understand, how mounting works. It's not very complicated. The system is structured in a way, that it even allows mounting network drives. Mounting a partition means just, that it will appear in a directory somewhere you like.
2012-09-29T00:11:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	like the system partition will always be mounted in the /-Directory
2012-09-29T00:11:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	I recommend you read some tutorials about fstab
2012-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	Respite212	rumpe1	Ok here's the question, how do I mount my sdb drive to my /home which is in my sda drive?
2012-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	and how the directories are structured on linux: "man hier" in terminal
2012-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	manually: sudo mount /dev/sda1 (?) /home
2012-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	you can't mount a drive like sda, you only can mount filesystems like sda1, sda2, ...
2012-09-29T00:16:00.000Z	Respite212		ok, so in order for me to mount my sdb1 to /home I got to do  -> sudo mount /dev/sdb1 (?) /home    ?
2012-09-29T00:16:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	no, usually something like that is done using fstab, so it gets mounted automatically
2012-09-29T00:17:00.000Z	Respite212	rumpe1	Err.. where can I get fstab?
2012-09-29T00:17:00.000Z	rumpe1	Respite212	because /home also contains profiles for desktops so that would only make sense, if you are in a cli-only mode
2012-09-29T00:25:00.000Z	Respite212	rumpe1	when I try to sudo fdisk -l , it tells me to use Gparted.
