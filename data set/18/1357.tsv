2012-02-18T13:11:00.000Z	apt-getter		For better explanation, I have an array of 3 numbers on each line of a file. I want to process the numbers to create 3 separate files, one conatining the 1st number of each line, the other one containing the 2nd number of each line and the 3rd one containing the 3rd number of each line. Thanks.
2012-02-18T13:13:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	awk '{print $1}' fruit.txt > first.txt
2012-02-18T13:13:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	awk '{print $2}' fruit.txt > second.txt
2012-02-18T13:13:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	 etc.  I'm sure you could do a looping construct if you wanted
2012-02-18T13:39:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	the virus stuff is off-topic.  as per your accelerometer data, does your existing code successfully assemble the data into one file?
2012-02-18T13:40:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	so then instead of outputting it straight to a file, run it through some pipes to awk like I mentioned before.
2012-02-18T13:41:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	it's not critical that you do, but go ahead
2012-02-18T13:43:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	that's not going to work for columns 2 and 3.  if you ditch everything from the first "&&" onwards, do you get the first file correctly?
2012-02-18T13:47:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	okay.  can you send me the output you get when you redirect everything to one file?  I want to take a look at how it is formatted so I can run awk on it
2012-02-18T13:52:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	thanks.  I'll post back in a few
2012-02-18T13:55:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	kindly let me know if this is effective at producing only the x-coordinates
2012-02-18T14:01:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	just a minute; I want to test out the solution I'm using
2012-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	you are using ordinary bash, right?  nothing funny?

2012-02-18T14:05:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	yes.
2012-02-18T14:06:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	assuming the coordinates it gives are in the order (x,y,z)
2012-02-18T14:07:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	can you confirm or disconfirm that your accelerometer data is ending up where you want it?
2012-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	brightspark	apt-getter	glad to help.  Goodnight
