2011-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		Yea, its a #freenode thing
2011-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		pretty much
2011-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		<rhcp[linux]> Hey guys, question. Any of you ever have this issue? When you leave 11.04 up awhile (desktop) the unity (hide/unhide) bar goes under the apps open? and it wont show unless you move the app to the right?
2011-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		too lazy to re-type
2011-10-03T05:30:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		or are you on 10.X?
2011-10-03T05:30:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		ah
2011-10-03T05:30:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]		I tried gnome3 (it didnt like my nvidia)
2011-10-03T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	you have the dodge hide setting enabled in ccsm
2011-10-03T05:31:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]	ActionParsnip	where is that? I never touched it
2011-10-03T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	in ccsm, unity plugin settings
2011-10-03T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	press SuperL and type: ccsm
2011-10-03T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	don't run ccsm as root, it will set roots compiz settings which you don't want. run it as your user to change your user
2011-10-03T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	I guess so, sure
2011-10-03T05:36:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]	ActionParsnip	I see the doge thing in the settings on the plugin
2011-10-03T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	ok, change that and it will hide in the style you choose
2011-10-03T05:37:00.000Z	rhcp[linux]	ActionParsnip	I know how it works.
2011-10-03T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	have a play, see which setting you prefer
2011-10-03T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhcp[linux]	is there a 'unity is always ontop of everything' setting
