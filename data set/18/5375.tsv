2011-03-27T20:06:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	you dont need to, it gets updated
2011-03-27T20:06:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ruan	how?
2011-03-27T20:07:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	when you use the PPA, firefox 3 gets updated to firefox 4
2011-03-27T20:07:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ruan	really?
2011-03-27T20:07:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	yes, i did it myself
2011-03-27T20:07:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ruan	ok
2011-03-27T20:07:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ruan	how do I fix the top bar symlink?
2011-03-27T20:09:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	it worked for me without a fix
2011-03-27T20:10:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	otherwise you can just recreate the shortcut
2011-03-27T20:10:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	by dragging it from applications > internet
2011-03-27T20:28:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	/usr/lib/firefox i believe
2011-03-27T20:28:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ruan	thanks
2011-03-27T21:52:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	it should work with existing addons
2011-03-27T21:53:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ruan	then I didn't install firefox to the correct location, it should be installed to /usr/lib/firefox?
2011-03-27T21:53:00.000Z	ruan	THE_GFR|WORK	addons are in the firefox profile
