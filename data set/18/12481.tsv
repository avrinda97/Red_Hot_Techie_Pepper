2006-06-25T08:21:00.000Z	moses		ok
2006-06-25T08:21:00.000Z	neutrinomass	moses	Freeze ? Log the user out, shut down the systme, what do you want ?
2006-06-25T08:22:00.000Z	moses	neutrinomass	freeze.. like a server on an internet shop.. i will unfreeze it once the customer says he is gonna extend his credit
2006-06-25T08:23:00.000Z	neutrinomass	moses	OK, lock screen maybe ?
2006-06-25T08:23:00.000Z	moses	neutrinomass	exactly!
2006-06-25T08:23:00.000Z	neutrinomass	moses	I don't know of a way to "freeze" ...
2006-06-25T08:24:00.000Z	moses	neutrinomass	lock screen then.. and when he extends time credit then to unlock screen again
2006-06-25T08:24:00.000Z	neutrinomass	moses	Hm... maybe you could try editing the user's .bashrc
2006-06-25T08:25:00.000Z	neutrinomass	moses	Though sorry, I'm not experienced with internet cafe administration. Instead of the hack that I am proposing, you might want to search for administration tools as Jowi suggested ...
