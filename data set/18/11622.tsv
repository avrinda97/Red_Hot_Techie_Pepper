2006-07-03T14:42:00.000Z	myahya_		hi, I am new here, I need help on devekoping gnome apps in ubuntu
2006-07-03T14:42:00.000Z	myahya_		anyone?
2006-07-03T14:44:00.000Z	myahya_		I am building myself. i installed all packages but when comiling under gcc header files are not found
2006-07-03T14:45:00.000Z	myahya_		it is already installed but it is not working
2006-07-03T14:47:00.000Z	myahya_		build-essential is already installed
2006-07-03T14:48:00.000Z	Knome	myahya_	see if this yields any files 'sudo apt-get build-dep gcc'
2006-07-03T14:49:00.000Z	myahya_		this is my code
2006-07-03T14:50:00.000Z	myahya_		#include <gnome.h> void main(){}
2006-07-03T14:55:00.000Z	myahya_		about my gnome dev problem: none of the proposed solutions have worked! gnome.h still cannot be found by gcc
2006-07-03T14:57:00.000Z	Knome	myahya_	'gnome.h' isn't a standard C library.
2006-07-03T14:57:00.000Z	myahya_		but I installed all gnome development packages
2006-07-03T14:59:00.000Z	Knome		here are the standard C libraries: stdio.h, ctype.h, string.h, math.h, stdlib.h, assert.h, stdarg.h, setjmp.h, signal.h, time.h, limits.h and float.h
2006-07-03T15:00:00.000Z	myahya_		I realize that. But even after installing the gnome development packages, the gnome header file cannot be found. should I pass any arguments to gcc when compiling
2006-07-03T15:02:00.000Z	myahya_		I got libgtk2.0-dev
2006-07-03T15:03:00.000Z	myahya_		I also installed libgnome-dev which is supposed to install all libraries for me
2006-07-03T15:06:00.000Z	myahya_		Subhuman/Knome??
2006-07-03T15:06:00.000Z	Knome		to specify a non-standard library location myahya_ use the -L {DIRNAME} or -I {DIRNAME}
2006-07-03T15:07:00.000Z	myahya_	Knome	I can't find gnome.h using locate
