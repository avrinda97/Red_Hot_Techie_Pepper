2011-02-24T23:22:00.000Z	Anabasis		Looking...
2011-02-24T23:24:00.000Z	Anabasis		Okay I have found it...
2011-02-24T23:24:00.000Z	Anabasis		Not what I was expecting...
2011-02-24T23:25:00.000Z	Anabasis		Where is the Linux equivalent of 'program files'?
2011-02-24T23:26:00.000Z	Anabasis		Somewhere in Home?
2011-02-24T23:26:00.000Z	Anabasis		Lol okay...
2011-02-24T23:27:00.000Z	Anabasis		Ikonia, what would be a good or standard procedure for installation from .tars in the future? In that would it be best to move the tart home & untar there?
2011-02-24T23:28:00.000Z	Anabasis		Didn't know that Maco, thank you.
2011-02-24T23:28:00.000Z	Anabasis		Maco that is what you generally do?
2011-02-24T23:29:00.000Z	Anabasis		Ikonia why is that your advise?
2011-02-24T23:29:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	because uninstalling what's been installed from tarballs is annoying
2011-02-24T23:15:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	is there an autogen file and a configure.in?
2011-02-24T23:15:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	"./configure && make && sudo make install" isn't universal
2011-02-24T23:16:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	or maybe there's a CMakeLists.txt? or a setup.py? or scons?
2011-02-24T23:28:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	home or /tmp
2011-02-24T23:28:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	but keeping in mind that /tmp is emptied on reboot
2011-02-24T23:28:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	as far as how to install from them... it varies project to project. with experience you'll learn how different build systems work
2011-02-24T23:29:00.000Z	maco	Anabasis	oh and that too... since you might replace something you already have with a newer incompatible version....
