2006-09-27T15:28:00.000Z	gansinho		hello, I'm trying to conect a pocket pc to my pc, and trying to know if it is recognized, following a how to in the forum I tryed to use the command "ls /dev" and watch for any changes between when the device is and isn't connected, but nothing changes here, any idea of what problem it is?
2006-09-27T15:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	try doing dmesg|tail to see if anything got picked up.
2006-09-27T15:31:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	(look for pocket-pc-related events)
2006-09-27T15:31:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	thanks! I'll try
2006-09-27T15:35:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	there are no pocket pc related events in dmesg|tail
2006-09-27T15:36:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	is it usb? if so, were there any usb-related events?
2006-09-27T15:36:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	it  is usb (is a pretty new ppc )
2006-09-27T15:37:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	I'll paste in pastebin the result ok?
2006-09-27T15:37:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	kk
2006-09-27T15:40:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	 http://paste.ubuntubrasil.org/742 (the other pastebin (in english is laggin)
2006-09-27T15:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	weird. and you say that you'd already checked for a new device in /dev?
2006-09-27T15:43:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	I did the commands : ls /dev > /tmp/before  then ls /dev > /tmp/after  then diff /tmp/before /tmp/after
2006-09-27T15:43:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	 but nothing shows up =//
2006-09-27T15:44:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	ok...i'm really sorry but that's about all i've got. you should perhaps do a search on http://www.ubuntuforums.org for pocket-pc or something...if you can't find anything, posting there will get you some attention :-)
2006-09-27T15:44:00.000Z	ladydoor	gansinho	good luck
2006-09-27T15:45:00.000Z	gansinho	ladydoor	thanks (for the time you spent/sorry bad english)a lot anyway
