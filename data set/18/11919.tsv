2006-06-09T16:17:00.000Z	gavagai		i would just look on the web but i can't access ubuntu wiki from my console browser for some reason... so if anyone knows how to dist upgrade from the command line that would be awesome
2006-06-09T16:18:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	use nano to change all references in /etc/apt/sources.lst from breezy to dapper, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2006-06-09T16:18:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	er, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-06-09T16:25:00.000Z	gavagai	nickrud	thanks.  when i change the references do i find them on the net, or literally just change every "breezy" to "dapper"?
2006-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	repeat the dist-upgrade
2006-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	gavagai	nickrud	thanks
2006-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	it's possible that was a trasitory error. I do love apt-get.
2006-06-09T08:23:00.000Z	gavagai	nickrud	you would not worry?  it was the final output, not an error message in the middle
2006-06-09T08:24:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	when I am in doubt about my package state, I do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. A few years has taught me to trust that line.
2006-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	can't even be done, apt watches for that
2006-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	gavagai	nickrud	that sounds a bit risky!
2006-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	yes
2006-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	groups <admin user> are all the normal groups for a user. You will need to add any other new user to the groups on that list
2006-06-09T10:24:00.000Z	gavagai	nickrud	does that give them sudo access?
2006-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	sudo adduser <new user> admin    adds your new user to the admin group. All members of the admin group have sudo privileges.
2006-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	no, because they don't have the privileges unless you add them to the admin group.
2006-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	gavagai	nickrud	right but wasn't adding them to that group the answer to give them sound?
2006-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	gavagai	no. adding them to the audio group gives them sound usage: sudo adduser <new user> audio
