2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	amias	farous	ext3 is very stable , have you checked your disk for bad blocks ? any fs will fail if there are badblocks on the disk
2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	amias	farous	it says /usr/lib/openoffice/program/javaldx: error while loading shared libraries: libjvmfwk.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	farous	amias	will do yet that is a new harddisk and pretty reliable
2006-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	amias	farous	 perfection doesn't exist , new disks can have bad sectors , good admins pre-test all disk before use
2006-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	farous	amias	you got it then install the missing lib
2006-06-26T05:18:00.000Z	farous	amias	i did test the harddisk
2006-06-26T05:19:00.000Z	farous	amias	had to look up its name and had to symbol. link the lib for it to work again
2006-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	amias	farous	you tried badblocks ?
2006-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	amias	farous	helps to know if hardware is playing up
2006-06-26T05:22:00.000Z	farous	amias	give me a min and tell me where to look
2006-06-26T05:34:00.000Z	farous	amias	do you happen to use aptitude
2006-06-26T05:35:00.000Z	amias	farous	nope dpkg --force all --purge then apt-get install
2006-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	farous	amias	ok. i ment sometimes regular use of aptitude result in those wierd removal of packages
2006-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	amias	farous	i think using dpkg --force all can do that too ;-)
2006-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	farous	amias	:)
2006-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	amias	farous	and dodgy hard disks
