2011-09-29T09:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 a samba share?
2011-09-29T09:23:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	I missed the beginning of this discussion, but my understanding is that using a VM to access a physical drive/partition as a VMDK is perfectly safe if you know what you're doing
2011-09-29T09:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 thats a big if. ;)
2011-09-29T09:27:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	fair enough.  I just didn't want it portrayed as a kind of taboo, as I think it's actually a really powerful feature of the software
2011-09-29T09:30:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	oh yeah, big time.  Maybe you could answer this for me, if I want to run Win7 from a VMDK while using Ubuntu as my principle system is it safe to access data (e.g. my music) on a shared data partition (probably NTFS) while both OSs are running?
2011-09-29T09:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 treat a vbox machine as you would a real one. ;) use its networking features
2011-09-29T09:58:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	ahh, my apologies then
2011-10-29T00:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 theres really no tutorial needed.. i install to my usb same as if it was a internal hard drive
2011-10-29T00:11:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	really? Sweet! :)
2011-10-29T00:14:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	That's exactly what I want.  I've been having trouble with a persistan USB install and from what I've gathered, I might be able to get around some of that by formatting ext4 instead of fat32
2011-10-29T00:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 a persistant install saves to a file that is formated to ext2 i recall.. but theres other issues ive seen with persistant live setups.
2011-12-12T11:33:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	warnings? and which trick?  I
2011-12-12T11:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 using vbox to boot/access a real physical disk
2011-12-12T11:35:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	I've read the section of the ducumentation before, but at the time it was a bit over my head, and there was a 4.xx version of VBox that broke this utility and I wasn't particualrly satisfied with what I had heard on the forums for it.  And more importantly, what warnings would you add?
2011-12-12T11:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 last i read the manual they basically said using vbox to access a real physical drive could result in data loss.. i think they even had it in big bold letters.. it was not advised to use that feature
2011-12-12T11:37:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	dr_willis	now I remember why I didn't try it before! lol
2011-12-12T11:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	 ive only used it i special rescue cases ;)
2011-12-12T11:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	JokesOnYou77	vbox has a share feature.  for shareing a directory. ;)
