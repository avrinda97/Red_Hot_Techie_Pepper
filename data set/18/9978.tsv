2007-01-25T11:21:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	great, what's the problem then?
2007-01-25T11:21:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	what model is it?
2007-01-25T11:21:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	usb? or a pci-card?
2007-01-25T11:22:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	if you try to write lspci in the terminal, what does it say?
2007-01-25T11:23:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	stop right there! :)
2007-01-25T11:23:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	I'll narrow it down a little...
2007-01-25T11:24:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	It lists all the devices that you have inside the computer. Can you see the card in there?
2007-01-25T11:25:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	Could that be the one?
2007-01-25T11:25:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	There is also some device called intel pro wireless 2200 BG.
2007-01-25T11:26:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	Yeah, it's a bummer. There really is slim support from the companies. but that does not mean that device can not be used outside windows
2007-01-25T11:26:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	Try poningru's deb file
2007-01-25T11:27:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	Lets see
2007-01-25T11:28:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	the last link there. called .deb file.
2007-01-25T11:28:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	that's a package. You can install it with gdebi program
2007-01-25T11:28:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	by double clicking.
2007-01-25T11:29:00.000Z	mustaukko	alejandrojz	swell, great.
