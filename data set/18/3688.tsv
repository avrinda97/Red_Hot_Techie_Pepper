2009-08-18T17:13:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	mine doesn't, is the problem.
2009-08-18T17:14:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	lsusb output?
2009-08-18T17:16:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	http://paste.ubuntu.com/255087/
2009-08-18T17:16:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	is chicony the device then
2009-08-18T17:16:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	no, I actually have no idea what that is. Nothing else is plugged into any USB port and the output is the same when I unplug the device.
2009-08-18T17:17:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	sounds like its not detecting it.  what version ubuntu ?
2009-08-18T17:17:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	yeah, I didn't think it was. 9.04.
2009-08-18T17:17:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	is it powered by AC or usb?
2009-08-18T17:18:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	it has an AC power jack but it comes on fine just from USB.
2009-08-18T17:18:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	I personally have a liteon usb lightscribe, usb powered and its awesome :)
2009-08-18T17:18:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	tried in other ports?  aside from that, Im not much help
2009-08-18T17:18:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	it's kind of recognising it now - lsusb shows Genesys Logic, Inc. USB 2.0 IDE Adapter
2009-08-18T17:19:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	I think I get what's going on. It's an internal drive that I took from an old laptop and put into a USB adaptor. it seems to recognising the adaptor but not the drive.
2009-08-18T17:20:00.000Z	deany	xzanxor	do you have windows you can test it on
2009-08-18T17:20:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	good idea. I'll give that a try.
2009-08-18T17:21:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	cheers! I'll be back later if I haven't had any success.
2009-08-18T17:21:00.000Z	xzanxor	deany	thanks : )
