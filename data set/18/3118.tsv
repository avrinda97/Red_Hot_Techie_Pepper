2011-01-31T09:25:00.000Z	tehbaut		is there any way to get details on which files are being processed when copying in nautilus?
2011-01-31T09:25:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	usually it displays that info as it copies (file operations)
2011-01-31T09:26:00.000Z	tehbaut	Blue11	I thought so too, but all I see is "copying 2,500 files (in "Some Folder") to "Some Other Folder"
2011-01-31T09:27:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	it should so the progress as it copies (at least it does in mine)
2011-01-31T09:28:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	there is no dropdown.  it will show another window that says file operations...and will show the progress of the copy...
2011-01-31T09:28:00.000Z	tehbaut	Blue11	yeah, I see the progress "2.0 GB of 20.0 GB --- approximately 90 hours left (59.3 KB/sec)" but no listing of which file is being processed
2011-01-31T09:28:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	that's pretty slow, what are you copying from to?
2011-01-31T09:29:00.000Z	tehbaut	Blue11	a hard drive with some bad blocks... it's excruciatingly slow
2011-01-31T09:29:00.000Z	tehbaut	Blue11	that's why I was hoping to see which files it's getting stuck on
2011-01-31T09:29:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	is it windows or linux?  have you run fsck?
2011-01-31T09:30:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	have never used a mac...dunno...
2011-01-31T09:43:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	i think dd does that, but not sure.
2011-01-31T09:44:00.000Z	tehbaut	Blue11	dd doesn't support error retry... only error skipping
2011-01-31T09:44:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	true that
2011-01-31T09:45:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	i think testdisk -- gosh don;t remember
2011-01-31T09:46:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	i'd use that with extreme caution though
2011-01-31T09:52:00.000Z	tehbaut	Blue11	looks like testdisk doesn't support copying on a file/directory level... it's more of a "recover deleted files" solution
2011-01-31T09:53:00.000Z	Blue11	tehbaut	yeah it is more a file recovery tool.  but I hadn't seen it in years...
