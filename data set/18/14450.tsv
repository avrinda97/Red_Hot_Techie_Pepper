2006-03-15T08:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Try deleting your ~/.openoffice.org2 directory.
2006-03-15T08:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Reinstall? Isn't it already been installed?
2006-03-15T08:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Well, what happens when you try to run OOo?
2006-03-15T08:44:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Not a great solution.
2006-03-15T08:45:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	So, as a user, what happens when you run oowriter2?
2006-03-15T08:46:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Define "Doesn't work".
2006-03-15T08:47:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	What does: ls ~/.openoffice.org2 -lah say?
2006-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	There ya go.
2006-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	delete the entire ~/.openoffice.org2 directory
2006-03-15T08:51:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Can you verify that those directories are actually deleted?
2006-03-15T08:52:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	"ls -lah ~/.openoffice.org2/"
2006-03-15T08:52:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	Also check that oowriter and related programs are not running, then start oowriter2 again as a user, NOT as root.
2006-03-15T08:53:00.000Z	Arafangion	kzc	And be aware that using su and sudo, will generally NOT update the environment variables, so things that look for HOME and other variables, will be using yours.
