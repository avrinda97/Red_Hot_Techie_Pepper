2004-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	benh		hi !
2004-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	benh		do ubuntu/ppc has a recent glibc  by now or still the old crap ?
2004-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	benh		that is, does it have NPTL/TLS support
2004-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	daniels	benh	we haven't done a large update
2004-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	daniels	benh	which version does one need to get nptl on ppc?
2004-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	benh	daniels	not sure exactly when it started
2004-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	benh	daniels	but if you update glibc, then I'd suggest sync with what fc has, something really recent
2005-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	daniels	benh	what's broken about it?
2005-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	daniels	benh	err ... we don't have draglock and shit like that
2005-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	benh	daniels	it's a USB HID device (not ADB anymore)
2005-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	daniels	benh	dunno who said that :)
2005-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	benh	daniels	last I've hard reports, the kernel HID refused to play with it at all
2005-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	daniels	benh	oh, interesting.  in that case, it's just going to come under /dev/input/mice, isn't it?
2005-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	benh	daniels	so it just didn't work _at all_
2005-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	daniels	benh	oh, OK.  well, we're pulling from -bk in some aspects
2005-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	daniels	benh	so if it works upstream, it works for us.  we don't have any custom patches that I know of.
2005-03-19T06:14:00.000Z	daniels	benh	ah cool
2005-03-19T06:14:00.000Z	daniels	benh	well, if you need anything to be done for ubuntu, courier it down to me :)
