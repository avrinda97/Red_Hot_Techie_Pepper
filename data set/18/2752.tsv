2010-05-31T23:44:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	Lol, :) Anything to say to me, friend?
2010-06-01T00:04:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	Actually, for programming, the best is Geany, which is an editor
2010-06-01T00:04:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	I mean, editor + ide. Also, for general purposes, Gedit is nice.
2010-06-01T00:04:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 just readin about it;)
2010-06-01T00:04:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	Jedit is nice, but for being made in Java, it is a bit slow. (As Java is interpreted_
2010-06-01T00:05:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 ye thats why im kinda afraid of it...
2010-06-01T00:06:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	No problem. If you take my view, use Geany for Programming + Editing, and Gedit for general editing. Also, Kate is a bit slow in GNOME, for Klibs are to be loaded.
2010-06-01T00:07:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 i need smth with a good syntax autodetection
2010-06-01T00:08:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 notepad++ is extremely good in that
2010-06-01T00:09:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	Ah, Geany is the good replacement for Notepad++, :D And it not only detects Syntaxes, but even compiles, builds and executes programmes, :)
2010-06-01T00:09:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 im gonna try it out then;)
2010-06-01T00:09:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	Sure, :) Just use this in terminal: sudo apt-get install geany (It is small, and great)
2010-06-01T00:10:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 i know how to install stuff;)
2010-06-01T00:10:00.000Z	rocket16	n8w	Oh, sorry, :( Just thought of providing the command, nevermind friend, :)
2010-06-01T00:11:00.000Z	n8w	rocket16	 bein appreciated:)
