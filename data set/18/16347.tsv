2004-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	Solkaris		anyone have a clue how to change the default icon for a MIME type in 2.8 .. old dialog is gone and new one doesn't seem to support it
2004-10-24T14:37:00.000Z	Solkaris		blah .. there is a perfectly decent icon to use 
2004-10-24T14:37:00.000Z	|trey|	Solkaris	right click, properties. click on the picture...
2004-10-24T14:37:00.000Z	|trey|	Solkaris	people seemed to be refering to the icon  :/
2004-10-24T14:38:00.000Z	Solkaris	|trey|	again that doesn't change the default icon for that MIME type
2004-10-24T14:39:00.000Z	|trey|	Solkaris	never occured to me to care about a picture so much  :/
2004-10-24T14:46:00.000Z	|trey|	Solkaris	I don't know that much about GNOME internals, and the people that do appear to be busy...
2004-10-24T14:47:00.000Z	Solkaris	|trey|	thanks for trying to help =)
