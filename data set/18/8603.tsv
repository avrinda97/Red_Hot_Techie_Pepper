2007-07-28T11:50:00.000Z	JBandP		ive struck out on everything in ubuntu tonight. i'd like to get at least one thing running :)
2007-07-28T11:50:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	alright ill try
2007-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	oh yuck samba ;D
2007-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	if it helps, it's easier to share it on the windows side and access from ubuntu
2007-07-28T11:52:00.000Z	JBandP	xtknight	i noticed that too.  but it's kind of crappy that way since i want to throw this ubuntu machine in a closest and acess via VNC or something.
2007-07-28T11:52:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	hm what do you mean?
2007-07-28T11:53:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	try lietu's suggestions

2007-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	it's at the bottom itll be obvious (theres a line for each bit depth)

2007-07-28T12:22:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	i'll probably be impaled for saying it, but chown it to yourself
2007-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	xtknight	JBandP	or chmod it, allow write permissions?
