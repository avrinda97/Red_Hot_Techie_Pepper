You might want to uninstall it with the Hardware Drivers tool, and see if the open source driver will show you the correct resolution.  You can also download and install the newer driver from Nvidia's site, or try modifying xorg.conf.  If you're new to Linux and Ubuntu though, I 
2010-01-20T18:44:00.000Z	Yfrwlf		So if I cannot see a program that is eating up lots of memory on my computer, I've been rootkitted, or is there any way to have memory leaks outside a process? =P

2010-01-20T18:48:00.000Z	Yfrwlf		1.5GBs of RAM used and continuing to count down. =P
2010-01-20T18:48:00.000Z	iflema	Yfrwlf	there is used, buffered ,cached and free.... note the cached and buffered.
2010-01-20T18:48:00.000Z	Yfrwlf		er up
2010-01-20T18:49:00.000Z	Yfrwlf	iflema	both cached and buffers from the program "free" are steadily increasing.
2010-01-20T18:50:00.000Z	iflema	Yfrwlf	this is ok.... some of this activity is for Qos.
2010-01-20T18:52:00.000Z	iflema	Yfrwlf	basically if your free ram is insufficient for what your doing..... get more!
2010-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	Yfrwlf	iflema	when I boot up, I'm only using about 300-400MBs.  System monitor now shows 1.5GBs.  I eventually rebooted a few days ago, because it eventually started into using swap space, which is horribly slow.  MorphyNOR: k, done, still confused. ^^
2010-01-20T18:54:00.000Z	Yfrwlf	iflema	1.6GBs used and steadily continuing.  Luckily I have 4GBs of RAM, but still.
2010-01-20T18:55:00.000Z	iflema	Yfrwlf	so you boot and touch nothing and it climbs until it crashes....
2010-01-20T18:55:00.000Z	Yfrwlf	iflema	No, I have not yet tried to see which program specifically is causing this "leak" or whatever it is.
2010-01-20T18:55:00.000Z	iflema	Yfrwlf	if its swapping its filled the 4gig
2010-01-20T18:58:00.000Z	Yfrwlf	iflema	Yes I know, it did, and that's my next step though is to start a program and wait to see if it causes the "leak".
2010-01-20T18:58:00.000Z	iflema	Yfrwlf	have you added apps from foreign repos/foreign source code.
2010-01-20T18:59:00.000Z	Yfrwlf	iflema	Yes, so I will test and see if I can find out which program causes the leaking, I was just hoping that I was missing some way of seeing the process which is leaking, but apparently I'm blind to it.
