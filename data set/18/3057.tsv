2010-08-28T21:43:00.000Z	Maletor		How can I enable HDMI sound through my NVIDIA GTX 460? It is not in system=>prefs=>sound. Refer http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1560288&highlight=hdmi+sound+gtx+460
2010-08-28T21:44:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	try - http://www.mandladventures.com/2008/11/03/ubuntu-810-hdmi-sound-configuration/
2010-08-28T21:46:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	My System=>Preferences=>Sound does not have an option to choose HDMI
2010-08-28T21:46:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	Plus, this is a NVIDIA Card
2010-08-28T21:46:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	what type of sound card?
2010-08-28T21:47:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	NVIDIA GTX 460
2010-08-28T21:48:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	maybe this? - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=967023
2010-08-28T21:52:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	does not come up in aplay -l
2010-08-28T21:53:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	oh ok. Hmm, not sure ... I'll keep pokin around
2010-08-28T21:59:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	You know what it might be? ALSA is out of date and doesn't have support for the GTX 460
2010-08-28T21:59:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	ah, good catch. update?
2010-08-28T22:07:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	what's the plan of action? just wait until alsa supports this? i far as I can tell they do not but I can't find a list anywhere
2010-08-28T22:08:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	yeah that might be your only option. Unless you pick up a card a bit older with support
2010-08-28T22:08:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	well i can still do spdif
2010-08-28T22:09:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	true...
2010-08-28T22:09:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	i will just have to wait for hdmi out which will include bitstreaming. you think it would be easy to pass unmolested audio through a card to a receiver.
2010-08-28T22:09:00.000Z	Maletor	hiku	i can barely find anything on this online
2010-08-28T22:09:00.000Z	hiku	Maletor	good question. I've never tried that before but I would think it should be fine
