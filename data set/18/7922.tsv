2007-10-26T01:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	is it a LCD?

2007-10-26T01:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	hit the 'auto' button.
2007-10-26T01:27:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	nothing, i made a full detailed post @ http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=589939
2007-10-26T01:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	'fuzzy' is automatic for refresh rate issues.
2007-10-26T01:27:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	yeah didn't work though
2007-10-26T01:28:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	all resolutions work fine, except this one (the highest)
2007-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	and i tried everything in the monitor it self and go nothing, and attempted changing / modifying the vertical + horizontal sync in xorg.conf
2007-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	maybe its a limitation of the driver under linux.
2007-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	it worked perfectly under feisty
2007-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	ask me in 10 days when my new laptop comes in that does high res.
2007-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	ah, could be regression issue. Have you filed a bug in lp?
2007-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	running gutsy now, ally my other computers work perfectly
2007-10-26T01:30:00.000Z	ahmadnassri	fyrestrtr	waiting on some responses on the forum first, didn't find any related bugs
2007-10-26T01:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ahmadnassri	don't be shy about filing bugs.
