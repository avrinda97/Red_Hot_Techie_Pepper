2011-01-07T16:43:00.000Z	roger21		where does the PATH varible is set for the users, it is not /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc and the /etc/envirment file doesn't match, any idea ?
2011-01-07T16:44:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	user specific or system-wide ?
2011-01-07T16:44:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	system wide
2011-01-07T16:45:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	the user does not modify his path, and i can't find where it is set up
2011-01-07T16:55:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	i dunno. should be /etc/bashrc if using bash.
2011-01-07T16:55:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	/etc/bashrc does source stuff in /etc/profile.d
2011-01-07T16:56:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	/etc/bashrc does source stuff in /etc/profile.d
2011-01-07T16:59:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	i got nothing in /etc/profile.d and nothing in /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc
2011-01-07T17:00:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	hmm. does the user have ~/.bash_profile ?
2011-01-07T17:01:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	sure the user have evrything but he doesn't modify the path (except adding ~/bin)
2011-01-07T17:02:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	so you sure that all the user's ~/.bash* files don't have any other export PATH ?
2011-01-07T17:03:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	i greped it, there is nothing else than the thing about the local bin
2011-01-07T17:05:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	yeah, but the problem with greping just ~/.bash* is that the bash files themselves can source other files. if you try removing/renaming all the user's ~/.bash* files, and then have him 'su - <user_id>', and then "echo $PATH" he'll have nothing. that would prove that one of the ~/.bash* files are calling another file somewhere.
2011-01-07T17:07:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	i'll try that
2011-01-07T17:08:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	yep he get another path, i must check those startup scripts deeper
2011-01-07T17:11:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	yeah. if using bash, the order is after login: call ~/.bash_profile -> ~/.bashrc. and ~/.bashrc sources stuff in /etc/bashrc. there's a lot of calls made in /etc/bashrc ...
2011-01-07T17:17:00.000Z	roger21	mvanle	sadly enougth it is /etc/bash_cpompletion that screw things up anyway thanks for your help
2011-01-07T17:18:00.000Z	mvanle	roger21	sweet.
