2009-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	you connected to this channel, so what's the problem connecting other channels?
2009-01-22T02:59:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	still not sure what your problem is??
2009-01-22T03:01:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	connecting to a server is not "installing" is it?
2009-01-22T03:02:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	go to Xchat (menu) > network list
2009-01-22T03:05:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	when you are talking to anyone in particular, please use there nick to start your line. Type the first 2 letters of the nick and hit <tab>
2009-01-22T03:09:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	or get a cup of coffee first and relax :)
2009-01-22T03:11:00.000Z	oCean_	spook__	you see my pm? Probably started another tab on your left hand (of xchat window)
