2006-12-11T13:00:00.000Z	semboy	LjL	okei when i type the command -> sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh i just get command not found
2006-12-11T13:02:00.000Z	LjL	semboy	now, at least that's saying something. does "apt-cache policy libdvdread3" show it as installed?
2006-12-11T13:03:00.000Z	LjL	semboy	do "dpkg -L libdvdread3 | grep install-css", what does that show, if anything?
2006-12-11T13:04:00.000Z	LjL	semboy	then type "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh", without that "examples" part
2006-12-11T13:05:00.000Z	semboy	LjL	thanks! :)
