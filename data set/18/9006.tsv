2007-06-09T14:13:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	do you see anything in System -> Admin -> System log ?
2007-06-09T14:13:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	if there's nothing there, take a look at the output of dmesg ( Alt+F2, type 'gnome-terminal' and press enter, then type 'dmesg' and press enter)
2007-06-09T14:18:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	 I get a failed optcode message, that drive is not ready for command, and a status error.
2007-06-09T14:19:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	could you perhaps put the message up on the pastebin ?
2007-06-09T14:20:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24901/
2007-06-09T14:21:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	do you know if hda is your cd-rom ?
2007-06-09T14:22:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	How would I figure that out?  Though that sounds about right.
2007-06-09T14:23:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	what does 'ls -l /dev/cdrom' say ? (should have a -> hda if hda is the cdrom)
2007-06-09T14:23:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	It says hda. :)
2007-06-09T14:24:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	i'd guess a bad cd in that case
2007-06-09T14:24:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	My drive is empty.
2007-06-09T14:24:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	I get this message all the time no matter what's in there.
2007-06-09T14:27:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	hrm.  not sure.  there's a related bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/46288
2007-06-09T14:27:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	though no solution is given
2007-06-09T14:28:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	Oh man, this is annoying.  Is there a way to suppress error messages?
2007-06-09T14:29:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	i don't know, sorry.  do you get these messages in gnome dialog boxes?
2007-06-09T14:29:00.000Z	Erich85	roryy	Yessir.
2007-06-09T14:31:00.000Z	roryy	Erich85	sorry, i can't find anything about suppressing error messages.  Doesn't mean it can't be done --- maybe someone else knows.
