2011-08-19T00:49:00.000Z	stealz_		My system randomly freezes when I start flash videos (might be on reload of a page, or after the 5th video I watch or whatever. Keys are not responding and mouse wont do anything either. Does anyone have a recommendation? Maybe one of the open source flash plugins?

2011-08-19T00:58:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	try touching the heat sink
2011-08-19T00:51:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	I installed a new graphics card, not sure if it was before or after ubuntu install, but i am using updated proprietary drivers
2011-08-19T00:51:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	nvidia or AMD? I've had no problems with my intel or nvidia cards, it might be an AMD problem
2011-08-19T00:52:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	nvidia
2011-08-19T00:52:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	and I have a intel CPU
2011-08-19T00:52:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	are you using compiz?
2011-08-19T00:52:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	yes
2011-08-19T00:53:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	do you have more than 4GB of ram and use 32bit ubuntu?
2011-08-19T00:53:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	8GB and 64bit ubuntu
2011-08-19T00:54:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	my desktop is running 64bit ubuntu with 4GB and an nvidia 210 card, no problems, but I'm not running compiz
2011-08-19T00:56:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	is your graphics card overheating?
2011-08-19T00:57:00.000Z	MohShami	stealz_	I used to get lockups when the fan on my old card stopped working
2011-08-19T00:57:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	I highly doubt it, it has a fan on it and my computer casing is open. I never have those freezes under Windows
2011-08-19T00:57:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	I had that on my old card, too
2011-08-19T00:57:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	, but I doubt thats the issue
2011-08-19T00:59:00.000Z	stealz_	MohShami	it feels warm, but I doubt thats the reason, the system will run immediately after it crashes, it didnt do that when I used to have crashes due to overheat
