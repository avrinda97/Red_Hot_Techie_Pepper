2007-04-15T09:29:00.000Z	computer13137		 In someone's opinion,which file system is superior?  Ext3 or ReiserFS?
2007-04-15T09:30:00.000Z	computer13137		 I've been told Ext3 has problems with saved files bloating up and wasting space.
2007-04-15T09:30:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	it depends on your work load
2007-04-15T09:30:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	ext3 is boring and safe, nothing exciting, reiser is more complicated and doesn't survive disk errors that well
2007-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	no. you've misunderstood
2007-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	not sure which issue :-). files removed in unix have their reserved space freed. on ext3 like on any other
2007-04-15T09:32:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	maybe you mean wasted space for files less than block size (so you end up wasting some space for small files on average)
2007-04-15T09:32:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	well, that's reiser for you
2007-04-15T09:33:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	depends on what you value, like I said
2007-04-15T09:33:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	personally? I use ext3 cause I can fix it manually when it breaks
2007-04-15T09:33:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	but I'm not a typical user.
2007-04-15T09:33:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	maybe you misunderstood "your other linux guy".
2007-04-15T09:35:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	if you have the url around I'd be interested in seeing it
2007-04-15T09:35:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	it's not major
2007-04-15T09:35:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	it's probably broken then, journal recovery isn't supposed to take much longer than couple of minutes
2007-04-15T09:36:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	normally takes some 3-15 seconds depending on the size/speed of the system
2007-04-15T09:36:00.000Z	czr	computer13137	1) I don't know who/what "bash" is (other than the shell), 2) I already answered your question
