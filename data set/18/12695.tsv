2006-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	hobojoe		but it errors out saying can't find linux-restricted-modules-2.6.16-ck3
2006-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	hobojoe		This is Dapper btw.
2006-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	hobojoe		I originally followed the Breazy nvidia install using the method #2
2006-05-25T15:03:00.000Z	hobojoe		same problem, Can't find package
2006-05-25T15:03:00.000Z	hobojoe		I followed the second method for breezy which required making your own headers for the driver.
2006-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	hobojoe		But now with dapper, all methods require the restricted modules in the repo. I don't have any precompiled kernels installed. So i was wondering Do i need to use one ?
2006-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	hobojoe		OR can i get it working with dapper and this kernel, Because the same method (using the nvidia installer) doesn't work with dapper and 2.6.16
2006-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	you are not required to use the restricted modules to install nvidia in dapper
2006-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	hobojoe	DBO	then how do i DO it? Because the How-to only lists methods with it.
2006-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	I am running the nvidia drivers and I used the installer.  Though it takes some symlinking.  Let me see if I can get you the proper instructions
2006-05-25T15:06:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Dapper
2006-05-25T15:07:00.000Z	hobojoe	DBO	I tryed doing this sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc linux-headers-`uname -r` but It complained it didnt have my linux-header-2.6.16-ck3
2006-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	it wont because there are no linux headers for 2.6.16 in repo
2006-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	hobojoe	DBO	I've already installed the manually
2006-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	then skip that step
2006-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	did you try the instructions that the site I gave you gives you?
2006-05-25T15:10:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	did you extract the pkg.run file and do the install that way?
2006-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	DBO	hobojoe	please follow the instructions at the site I gave you (minus getting the headers)
