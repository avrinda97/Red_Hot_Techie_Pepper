2010-06-27T03:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Uboy	what's up?
2010-06-27T03:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Uboy	You follow that link while booting, and then you can reset the password.  Is this your account? or someone else's account?
2010-06-27T03:18:00.000Z	Uboy	Flannel	this is only account that created during installing Ubuntu, after following that ways, my commands with sudo prefix can work? and the password i use for that way use here?
2010-06-27T03:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Uboy	The password you set up for that account is the password you'll use from that account to use sudo.  You said you need to set that password (I presume because you've forgotten it).  That page will explain how to set it, but you'll need to reboot.
2010-06-27T03:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Uboy	sounds good
