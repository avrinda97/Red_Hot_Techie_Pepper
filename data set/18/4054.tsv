2010-06-07T04:05:00.000Z	destroth		Hey how can I create an exception to block all incoming from a certain IP 67.135.105.39
2010-06-07T04:06:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	On just that computer?
2010-06-07T04:07:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	add the following to /etc/hosts.deny
2010-06-07T04:07:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	ALL: 67.135.105.39
2010-06-07T04:10:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Should take effect immidiately
2010-06-07T04:13:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Packets will still flow but now your computer ignores them before they reach applications
2010-06-07T04:14:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Perhaps you need an iptables rule?
2010-06-07T04:17:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	sudo iptables -A INPUT -source 67.135.105.39 DROP
2010-06-07T04:17:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Should do it.
2010-06-07T04:20:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	sudo iptables -A INPUT -source 67.135.105.39 -j DROP
2010-06-07T04:20:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	whoops  double - in front of source
2010-06-07T04:20:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	sudo iptables -A INPUT --source 67.135.105.39 -j DROP
2010-06-07T04:22:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Did it help?
2010-06-07T04:24:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Your computer is completely ingnoring them.  A network is like a big black room.  You can't stop other people from yelling your name.  You can only ignore them or go to a different room.
2010-06-07T04:24:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Are these coming from the internet?
2010-06-07T04:25:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Do you have a router?
2010-06-07T04:25:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Do you have ports forwarded from that router to your machine?  Is your machine running any services?
2010-06-07T04:26:00.000Z	edbian	destroth	Describe your LAN.  Do you have any services running on your computer? Is your router port forwarding?
