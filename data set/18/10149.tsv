2007-01-13T15:27:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		Hi everyone :)
2007-01-13T15:27:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		Just need a  little help pretty quick if possible.
2007-01-13T15:28:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		I'm setting up my wireless and I just need to change the mac adress to point to our AP using iwconfig.
2007-01-13T15:28:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		I'm in as root and I've had no trouble changing other properties such as ESSID, Channel etc
2007-01-13T15:29:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		Unfortunately, whenever I try and go to change the MAC address it comes up telling me that i have no permission
2007-01-13T15:30:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		anyone got any idea and how to give myself permission to change this?
2007-01-13T15:30:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		yes, i ran SU
2007-01-13T15:31:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		entered my password and such but it just wont let me change this, normaly i just had to restart terminal when it wouldnt let me do something
2007-01-13T15:31:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin		but this time it's being particularly stubborn :(
2007-01-13T15:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	You can't change your MAC address
2007-01-13T15:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	Do you mean the bssid?
2007-01-13T15:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	sudo iwconfig eth1 ap 00:00:00:00:00 does not work?
2007-01-13T15:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	then change wlan0, it was just an example
2007-01-13T15:36:00.000Z	Sir_Penguin	Amaranth	sudo iwconfig wlan0 ap 00:00:00:00:00:00 doesn't work :(
2007-01-13T15:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	permission error?
2007-01-13T15:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	the hardware (or driver) won't let you change it
2007-01-13T15:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	Why do you need a specific AP?
2007-01-13T15:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	Sir_Penguin	You're supposed to fill in an essid and it'll associate with a router with that name on it's own
