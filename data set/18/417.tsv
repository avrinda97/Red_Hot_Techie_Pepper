2012-03-15T11:49:00.000Z	tMH	CFHowlett	- I need to put some far site to test with ping results written to the file and take a look day after if there were ping reply faults.
2012-03-15T11:50:00.000Z	tMH	CFHowlett	- so I need the ping the can put timestamp - 2012/03/15 11:46:53.859 on each ping reply _AND_ tell me when the site is not pinging: 2012/03/15 11:46:53.859 : 77.246.*.* request timed out
2012-03-15T11:50:00.000Z	tMH	CFHowlett	- fping for win32 is the best ping console utility, but it's a win32 one ;(

2012-03-15T11:51:00.000Z	CFHowlett	tMH	  understood.  sorry, the only ping test I ever do is google - which has ALWAYS answered.
