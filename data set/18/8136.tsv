2007-12-23T13:14:00.000Z	leftyfb	bazhang	: we already tried helping him in EFnet, he doesn't want help. Only argues
2007-12-23T13:14:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	thanks for the heads up
2007-12-23T13:16:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	just ignore; and please keep the place family-friendly :}
2007-12-23T13:16:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	my apologies
2008-05-02T08:30:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	you checked truecrypt?
2008-05-02T08:31:00.000Z	leftyfb	bazhang	truecrypt doesn't create full linux filesystems, only containers which need to be mounted manually. You cannot mount truecrypt containers using grub
2008-08-30T20:41:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	for what
2008-08-30T20:41:00.000Z	leftyfb	bazhang	Fresh install of ubuntu 8.10 with all updates including from proposed on a Dell XPS 410. Nvidia GeForce 7900 GS. I've tried the normal restricted drivers (nvidia-glx-new), tried envy and even tried version 177 which isn't released yet. It refuses to boot properly (beyond 800x600).
2008-08-30T20:41:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	intrepid?
2008-08-30T20:41:00.000Z	leftyfb	bazhang	try reading my post
2008-08-30T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	8.10 is intrepid
2008-08-30T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	install nvidia-settings
2008-08-30T20:44:00.000Z	leftyfb	bazhang	i'll try that after going back to the normal restricted drivers .. gotta get rid of envy. although i'm not sure it will help. It's not just a question of resolution, but of the driver not working. I get the "bulletproof" mode at boot. cwill747 no need, I know the basic troubleshooting for video/nvidia issues.
2012-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	no he's gone.
2012-10-08T21:09:00.000Z	bazhang	leftyfb	its the officially supported method. to get from the repos. lets not argue about this any further
