2009-11-16T10:31:00.000Z	Nautilus		i'm stumped but this should be easy. I can see the ext3 drive I want in my file browser, but doing an 'Open' does nothing. I see the partition I want in dev/disk/by-id but clicking there just says it doesnt have a suitable application for the filetype
2009-11-16T10:32:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	sudo mount -t ext /dev/whatyouwantmounted /where/you/want/mounted
2009-11-16T10:32:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	sorry, correction, sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/whatyouwantmounted /where/you/want/mounted
2009-11-16T10:33:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	is there a GUI way?
2009-11-16T10:34:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	none that comes to mind if the partition you want mounted doens't show up in the places menu.  Maybe open "computer" and see if it's there.  If it is, try double-clicking.
2009-11-16T10:35:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	Oh I think I got too deep into dev/disk/by-id. now I see the sda and sdb in /dev
2009-11-16T10:36:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	ok.
2009-11-16T10:38:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	I right click on sda1, but no option to mount it
2009-11-16T10:40:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	does the partition show up in Places -> Computer?
2009-11-16T10:41:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	yes it's there now, I did a reboot and wiggled power wire, inspected etc
2009-11-16T10:41:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	try double-clicking that
2009-11-16T10:41:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	have done that and right-click Opened, nothing happens
2009-11-16T10:45:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	cmd line way, is this right?:  sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /myoldhd
2009-11-16T10:46:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	if you want to mount the drive to the folder /myoldhd , then yes.
2009-11-16T10:47:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	this'll be just fine to copy my files off
2009-11-16T10:47:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	ok
2009-11-16T10:48:00.000Z	Nautilus	jbuncher	mount: mount point myoldhd does not exist
2009-11-16T10:48:00.000Z	jbuncher	Nautilus	you need to create the folder first before trying to mount a drive to it.
