2007-09-18T14:27:00.000Z	Knight_On_White		hello all, i would like to know what is the best way to copy data from HDD to HDD under Ubuntu 7.04 ? and make a data compares later ? (does ubuntu have software like norton commander on xp systems?)
2007-09-18T14:28:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	no need for norton command
2007-09-18T14:28:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	you can do a disk dump
2007-09-18T14:29:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	There are plenty of ways to do it what are you trying to accomplish exactly?
2007-09-18T14:30:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	a bit for bit copy?
2007-09-18T14:32:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	like a back up?  Do you want it compressed?
2007-09-18T14:32:00.000Z	Knight_On_White	h1st0	: yes
2007-09-18T14:33:00.000Z	Knight_On_White	h1st0	yes
2007-09-18T14:33:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	something like partimage may be what you are looking for.
2007-09-18T14:33:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	it creates a copy of the entire partition making it easy to restore.

2007-09-18T14:34:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	He has a link to other backup options.  But in linux if you just backup your /home or put it on a seperate partition you are pretty safe.
2007-09-18T14:36:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	there is also tar you can just make a tgz of your entire disk heres a hwoto http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=81311
2007-09-18T14:36:00.000Z	Knight_On_White	h1st0	i have an HDD with alot of databases (300gb), and i would like to copy all the databases to other HDD - so i was thinking of make an archive of all the databases directly to the new HDD
2007-09-18T14:38:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	then look at that howto for tar that I posted.  That will probably be your best bet.  You an create a compressed file of them.
2007-09-18T14:39:00.000Z	h1st0	Knight_On_White	you can just adapt it to your needs as you are not backing up /  but wherever your databases are.
