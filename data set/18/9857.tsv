2007-02-13T07:53:00.000Z	carlhume		I'm trying to find the line to add to my apt sources to be able to install java-package - anyone know?
2007-02-13T07:54:00.000Z	bruenig	carlhume	what is java-package
2007-02-13T07:54:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	I'm following the how-to on www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-76735.html
2007-02-13T07:55:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	I'm guessing it's the deb that contains make-jpkg ...
2007-02-13T07:59:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	Any guesses?
2007-02-13T07:59:00.000Z	bruenig	carlhume	is that java for 64 bit?
2007-02-13T07:59:00.000Z	bruenig	carlhume	or your initial question was about adding repo lines right?
2007-02-13T07:59:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	yes
2007-02-13T07:59:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	yes
2007-02-13T08:00:00.000Z	bruenig	carlhume	well /etc/apt/sources.list is where you would add it
2007-02-13T08:00:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	yes
2007-02-13T08:00:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	I can't find what repo I need to add...
2007-02-13T08:01:00.000Z	bruenig	carlhume	that howto is really old, year and a half, it is probably obselete
2007-02-13T08:02:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	hrm - well then, back to the drawing board
2007-02-13T08:02:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	thx
2007-02-13T08:03:00.000Z	bruenig	carlhume	do you need just the plugin, because I know some howtos for that
2007-02-13T08:03:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	No - I need the SDK
2007-02-13T08:04:00.000Z	carlhume	bruenig	I just found the java6 jdk in Multiverse - maybe I'll give it a whirl
