2007-03-31T12:02:00.000Z	vil		hey all
2007-03-31T12:02:00.000Z	vil		I have a questio about ubuntu remote desktop
2007-03-31T12:03:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	 ask away
2007-03-31T12:04:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	I assume you're using rdesktop ...if you try man rdesktop there's a setting in there for size... I think
2007-03-31T12:05:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	oh... vnc  ummm.. I dunno :-(
2007-03-31T12:05:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	I am using vncviewer and there doesn't seem to be a paramter for that
2007-03-31T12:06:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	I used it once... I thought you'd have a basic question... sorry,  :-(
2007-03-31T12:06:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	thanks anyway ;)
2007-03-31T12:08:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	why are you sick of eclipse?
2007-03-31T12:09:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	I was trying to get qt to work on it... and I finally did... but it's still not perfect
2007-03-31T12:09:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	 and I can't get the QtClipse plugin to work at all :-(
2007-03-31T12:10:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	I play with the eclipse package from time to time, if I can help with any particular problem, let me know
2007-03-31T12:11:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	as in the .deb package?
2007-03-31T12:11:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	right .deb
2007-03-31T12:13:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	Eclipse from the .debs works perfectly, as does the CDT plugin :-)   just... every time I have to use qmake I have to do it from the command line
2007-03-31T12:13:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	any exceptions or other logs?
2007-03-31T12:14:00.000Z	hendrixski	vil	no it's not a bugs problem.. It's a learning curve issue :-(
2007-03-31T12:15:00.000Z	vil	hendrixski	lol, now we found it
