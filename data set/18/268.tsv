2012-05-12T23:07:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		hi friends
2012-05-12T23:07:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		i just updated to 12.04
2012-05-12T23:07:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		i am surprised that it was pretty painless
2012-05-12T23:08:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		was preparing for tons of breakage
2012-05-12T23:10:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		so I have this issue (which i think is by design and not an issue). when i boot my ubuntu box and ssh in aplay -L shows only one device called default
2012-05-12T23:10:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		once i log in through the display manager it shows all my devices
2012-05-12T23:10:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		how can i get it to show all my devices just by having the pc boot
2012-05-12T23:11:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		i use my crontab as an alarm clock and the computer is headless
2012-05-12T23:12:00.000Z	psusi	totemuh1oats	how many devices do you have?
2012-05-12T23:23:00.000Z	totemuh1oats	psusi	quite a few because I have onboard sound and a graphics card with hdmi, it usually produces multiple devices for every card, playback / recording / devices for multple channels
2012-05-12T23:24:00.000Z	totemuh1oats	psusi	i only need to access the one i actually use, but basically any audio player will fail because the devices aren't accessible unless i login through the window manager
2012-05-12T23:33:00.000Z	psusi	totemuh1oats	hrm... I thought aplay still worked directly with the alsa kernel driver, it it looks like it now goes through pulseaudio, which I think normally is only started when you log in... you'd need to get it running as a system wide daemon instead of per session
2012-05-12T23:34:00.000Z	totemuh1oats	psusi	yea i had a suspicion that was it, but I can't seem to figure out how. i changed daemoniz = no to daemonize = yes in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf
2012-05-12T23:34:00.000Z	totemuh1oats		but it didn't work
2012-05-12T23:35:00.000Z	psusi	totemuh1oats	I still don't really understand pulseaudio either
2012-05-12T23:35:00.000Z	totemuh1oats	psusi	could i just remove pulse? or will it break things?
2012-05-12T23:35:00.000Z	psusi		total-clueless, maybe tru running pulseaudio --start?
2012-05-12T23:36:00.000Z	totemuh1oats	psusi	well thanks anyway, i will have to continue to look into it
