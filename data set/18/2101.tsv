2010-08-22T14:35:00.000Z	nsaw		Is there a tool which is able to recursive shrink all pictures in a directory (including subdirs). (Filesize)
2010-08-22T14:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	you can use shelll tools + convert of mogrify from imagemagik
2010-08-22T14:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	shrink == resize?
2010-08-22T14:37:00.000Z	nsaw	erUSUL	yes i want all picturs to a size of 100kb
2010-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	but how do you plan to do it? resizing them to say, half its high and width ?
2010-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	changing the image format?
2010-08-22T14:39:00.000Z	nsaw	erUSUL	that is exactly my problem, my target is to reduce the filesize. I tried it with convert -geometry but not all pictures have the same resolution
2010-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	nsaw		so I shrink pictures again  which are already small .
2010-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	convert/mogrify -resize 50% ?
2010-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	what format are the pictures? jpeg ?
2010-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	nsaw		jpg
2010-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	nsaw		yes
2010-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	nsaw		i have some pics in raw format too but they are not important yes
2010-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	nsaw		yet
2010-08-22T14:42:00.000Z	nsaw		i know that some websites are ables to shink pictures to a predefined filesize, but i dont know the algorythm behind that
2010-08-22T14:43:00.000Z	nsaw		therefor i thought that there are maybe tools which can do that
2010-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	nsaw	i do not know either...
