2012-10-25T19:35:00.000Z	fluitfries		can someone help with a reliable terminal command to make a mountable readonly image (iso) of a directory on a usb filesystem?
2012-10-25T19:35:00.000Z	fluitfries		*from the usb filesystem.
2012-10-25T19:35:00.000Z	blackshirt	fluitfries	what you mean ?
2012-10-25T19:36:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	well i'm having trouble with tar on this directory, so i wanted to try something else.
2012-10-25T19:36:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	meanwhile all the other dirs worked fine with tar
2012-10-25T19:36:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	no, i need to CREATE the ISO from the dir on the usb
2012-10-25T19:37:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	i was able to use tar on the rest of the dirs from that usb, but this one gives errors.
2012-10-25T19:38:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	lol, it's 80 gigs.
2012-11-15T04:31:00.000Z	blackshirt	fluitfries	sure
2012-11-15T04:32:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	i am upgrading virtualbox but the 4.2 version warns that it breaks the 4.1 version.  so i'm guessing i need to uninstall first?
2012-11-15T04:32:00.000Z	blackshirt	fluitfries	you can use apt-get to purge/remove/uninstall installed packages
2012-11-15T04:33:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	oh, i didn't realize apt worked with .deb packages
2012-11-15T04:34:00.000Z	blackshirt	fluitfries	i don't mean with .deb packages ....
2012-11-15T04:34:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	virtualbox comes via .deb packages from their website.
2012-11-15T04:34:00.000Z	blackshirt	fluitfries	if your .deb packages has been installed, you can manage it with apt
2012-11-15T04:34:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	the version in the repositories is not the same version, it has limitations
2012-11-15T04:35:00.000Z	fluitfries	blackshirt	ok, i'll try to remove 4.1 with apt, thank you
2012-11-15T04:35:00.000Z	blackshirt	fluitfries	you should do it carefully when you using third party repository
