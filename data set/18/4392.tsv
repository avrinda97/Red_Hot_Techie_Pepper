2010-10-23T04:02:00.000Z	Rob235		so is it a bad idea to use my home folder from 10.04 with 10.10?
2010-10-23T04:03:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	yes - although you could see what happens after you make a copy of your home directory
2010-10-23T04:03:00.000Z	Rob235		what do you mean
2010-10-23T04:03:00.000Z	Rob235		the size of it?
2010-10-23T04:04:00.000Z	Rob235		is that the only reason its bad?
2010-10-23T04:04:00.000Z	Rob235		cause i have it on a separate partition
2010-10-23T04:04:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	copy your /media/<olddriveuuid>/home/Rob235 directory to  /home/Rob235
2010-10-23T04:05:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	then see how long it takes for the excretion to hit the dyson airblade
2010-10-23T04:05:00.000Z	Rob235	graingert	i have my home folder on a separate partition, it only takes a sec
2010-10-23T04:05:00.000Z	Rob235		to set up
2010-10-23T04:05:00.000Z	Rob235		im just wondering if i'll have any bad files or something
2010-10-23T04:06:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	 you may do - it's an idea to make a backup first
2010-10-23T04:06:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	make a dd backup of your /home fs
2010-10-23T04:06:00.000Z	Rob235	graingert	 thats a big backup hah
2010-10-23T04:06:00.000Z	Rob235		i dont see why id need it but ok
2010-10-23T04:07:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	you can get rid of most of your big files from the backup then :p - videos won't break it so don't copy those
2010-10-23T04:07:00.000Z	graingert	Rob235	you'll need to not use dd for that
2010-10-23T04:07:00.000Z	Rob235	graingert	i have a 30gb virtualbox hard drive file in my home dir for mac os x
