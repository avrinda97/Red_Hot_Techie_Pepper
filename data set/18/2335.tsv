2010-06-27T09:38:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		how do I get part name?
2010-06-27T09:40:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		Well my issue is I am trying to install mythubuntu and I got an IO error.  The error said it could be the CD or the hard drive, but since I pulled this PC off a shelf its been sitting on for like a year I wanted to make sure the hard drive was okay before I go wasting disks
2010-06-27T09:42:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		I dont think it finished tho
2010-06-27T09:42:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		it was 48 % thru, than I got the IO error than I went to get a drink and the installer was gone
2010-06-27T09:43:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		high- think 20x
2010-06-27T09:43:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		is there a way to do an integrity check on the disk?
2010-06-27T09:45:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		Ya - Mythbuntu to be exact
2010-06-27T09:46:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	When you boot there should be a boot and verify option
2010-06-27T09:43:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	What speed did you burn the disc at
2010-06-27T09:43:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	Try to reburn the image on a disc that supports 2.4x and burn it that slow
2010-06-27T09:45:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	What kind of disc?
2010-06-27T09:45:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	Ubuntu install disc?
2010-06-27T09:46:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	But like I said, try reburning the ISO at 2.4x
2010-06-27T09:46:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	Generally a slower burn speed results in less chance of the disc failing
2010-06-27T09:47:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	For future advice, NEVER burn an ISO image at full write speed.
2010-06-27T09:47:00.000Z	soadkombucha	UbuntuLily	Ahh alright
