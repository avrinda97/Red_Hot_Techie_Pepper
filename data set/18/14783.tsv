2005-06-14T12:07:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	computer science
2005-06-14T12:07:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	on one side, they can use a langauge fully(features, etc), but lack much in self though
2005-06-14T12:11:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	who are you though? are you better than the CS students you talk about?
2005-06-14T12:14:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	+ students are only as good as their teachwers... almost,...
2005-06-14T12:15:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	well these are grads earning thier doctors, can't they make a simple matlab script? :P its like, "damn you useless idiots"
2005-06-14T12:15:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	they want my friend to write _everything_ and they ask really stupid questions
2005-06-14T12:15:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	yes! many times
2005-06-14T12:16:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	well, something is wrong, please investigate;):)
2005-06-14T12:17:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	please encourage asking questions, and communication, otherwise it will not work
2005-06-14T12:20:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	very good idea.
2005-06-14T12:21:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	it might help.
2005-06-14T12:21:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	you will determine even that, if they are reading, and tryig to understand, they can ask subquestions
2005-06-14T12:22:00.000Z	tsume	dab1	well, I'd get ticked off too if I were asked by a long time unix admin what the command ls was for? ;)
2005-06-14T12:23:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	no math, or ever heard of matlab in 4th year.
2005-06-14T12:27:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	man.
2005-06-14T12:28:00.000Z	dab1	tsume	hire Razor-X.
