2007-12-07T12:31:00.000Z	scottux		anyone here familiar with NAS usage under linux?
2007-12-07T12:32:00.000Z	scottux		doesn't anyone know enough about NAS usage enough to want to help me?
2007-12-07T12:32:00.000Z	scottux		please?
2007-12-07T12:33:00.000Z	thor	scottux	no one has any idea what your problem is...so how can we know if we can help?
2007-12-07T12:35:00.000Z	thor	scottux	you can see the ip address of the server by opening a terminal and typing 'ifconfig' at the prompt
2007-12-07T12:35:00.000Z	thor	scottux	but you should really set a static ip address for an NAS server
2007-12-07T12:36:00.000Z	scottux	thor	I don't exactly know how to do so...any pointers?
2007-12-07T12:41:00.000Z	thor	scottux	are you running ifconfig on the server?
2007-12-07T12:44:00.000Z	thor	scottux	do you have the docs on the drive? There should be a way to address the box to configure it...maybe via a web interface?
2007-12-07T12:44:00.000Z	scottux	thor	yes, web interface is the usual method, but typically that's accessed via windows machine at address \\mybookworld\
2007-12-07T12:45:00.000Z	scottux	thor	and I can't manage to get there from linux
2007-12-07T12:46:00.000Z	thor	scottux	if that is what you are using in windows it should work in linux...assuming you are on the same network
2007-12-07T12:46:00.000Z	scottux	thor	I am. The same computer even.
2007-12-07T12:46:00.000Z	thor	scottux	if nothing else, you should be able to ping mybookworld and find the address
2007-12-07T12:46:00.000Z	scottux	thor	i"ll give that a shot
2007-12-07T12:47:00.000Z	scottux	thor	simply "ping mybookworld" in terminal?
2007-12-07T12:48:00.000Z	thor	scottux	 right....it should return the ip address
