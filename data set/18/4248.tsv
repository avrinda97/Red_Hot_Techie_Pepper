2009-05-13T06:21:00.000Z	meoblast001		does anyone know how to make a Kodak EasyShare C813 work with Ubuntu?
2009-05-13T06:21:00.000Z	meoblast001		looks like i'll be wasting yet another night
2009-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	meoblast001		if i can't figure this out soon, i'll just tell my mom she can get XP because obviously none of her stuff is working
2009-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	meoblast001		nor anyone else who i convert to ubuntu
2009-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	the1corrupted	meoblast001	Why does it have to be kodak?
2009-05-13T06:23:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	because i don't have the physical capabilities to turn it into a nother brand
2009-05-13T06:23:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	i don't do magic
2009-05-13T06:24:00.000Z	the1corrupted	meoblast001	Yeah, there are many ways of getting photos off cameras.  One is to get a MicroSD reader and physically pull the card out of the camera.
2009-05-13T06:24:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	do they give those away like the AOL discs?
2009-05-13T06:25:00.000Z	the1corrupted	meoblast001	Go look at your local Wal-Mart.  They're sure to have one or two laying around.  Just ask for a photo card reader.
2009-05-13T06:25:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	should i ask them if i can have it for free?
2009-05-13T06:25:00.000Z	the1corrupted	meoblast001	o.o  It's not gonna be free, but it's gonna cost less than $20
2009-05-13T06:25:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	well... in a moneyless society, everything would be free
2009-05-13T06:26:00.000Z	the1corrupted	meoblast001	No, in a moneyless society, things would actually cost a whole lot more.  Just not money.
2009-05-13T06:27:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	well.. this conversation isn't changing the fact that this camera won't work
2009-05-13T06:27:00.000Z	the1corrupted	meoblast001	Well, I'll tell you right now, a microSD reader is cheaper than a $100 XP license.
2009-05-13T06:27:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	no one i know likes Ubuntu except for my sister and she's starting to not like it
2009-05-13T06:28:00.000Z	meoblast001	the1corrupted	i can't keep up with the demands of people and the fuckups of all the companies that aren't supporting major operating systems
