2006-07-20T12:03:00.000Z	fuoco		hi, i have a question: can ubuntu remove (uninstall) packages that are no longer needed, as in dependencies that are not needed anymore etc.. ?
2006-07-20T12:03:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	yes, you can use deborphan for that
2006-07-20T12:03:00.000Z	fuoco	bimberi	but it's not something that's done automatically ?
2006-07-20T12:04:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	only if you use aptitude for package management.  apt-get and synaptic don't remove obsolete dependencies automatically
2006-07-20T12:07:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	only if you use aptitude for installation and removal
2006-07-20T12:07:00.000Z	fuoco	bimberi	isn't that the default on ubuntu ?
2006-07-20T12:08:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	well no, it's one of many front-ends to apt, Synaptic and apt-get are more popular
2006-07-20T12:08:00.000Z	fuoco	bimberi	i thought synaptic uses aptitude
2006-07-20T12:08:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	not afaik
2006-07-20T12:10:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	Ubuntu is pretty good (i have a mac mini) but it's the only Linux distro i've tried
2006-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	if it's feasible it's generally the best way.  However the upgrade is usually fine.
2006-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	fuoco	bimberi	any special reason for that ? :)
2006-07-20T12:15:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	well with a fresh install you are always starting from a known state
2006-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	no, if it installed without any force- options it should be fine
2006-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	fuoco	bimberi	ok thanks. i assume the only down side then is that i won't get updates for that package ?
2006-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	no, unless it appears in your repositories later :)
2006-10-05T08:22:00.000Z	fuoco	bimberi	that was my next question, what happens if it appears in the repo later ?
2006-10-05T08:22:00.000Z	bimberi	fuoco	if it's a later version in the repo it will offer to upgrade
