2009-05-09T17:10:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		i just installed 9.04 from 8.04.2 and kept my /home partition.  i changed my user name, so i was wondering if there was an easy way to just copy everything from my previous user folder to my new one
2009-05-09T17:10:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		can i just rename the folder?
2009-05-09T17:11:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		can i do it as root?
2009-05-09T17:11:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		or sudo
2009-05-09T17:12:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		why not nautilus
2009-05-09T17:12:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		i mean, its just a directory, right
2009-05-09T17:13:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		so what should i do?
2009-05-09T17:13:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		copy everything individually?
2009-05-09T17:14:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		:)
2009-05-09T17:14:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	I dont know if I'm missing something those other people are saying will mess up but should be no problem to copy home over as root and then chown it to your new username
2009-05-09T17:14:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	I've copied over home many times before
2009-05-09T17:14:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim	mabus	it's not just the /home, but from two different usernames
2009-05-09T17:16:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	basically yep
2009-05-09T17:16:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	chown -R newusername (capital)
2009-05-09T17:17:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	might want to just back up both directories anyway
2009-05-09T17:18:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim	mabus	i don't belive in back ups!
2009-05-09T17:19:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	then you shouldnt be doing things like this
2009-05-09T17:22:00.000Z	mabus	giacomo_carissim	I dont think thats the mission statement for ubuntu at all, probably something like the opposite.
