2011-05-01T04:15:00.000Z	Solnse		I hope somebody can point me in the right direction, since upgrading to Ubuntu 11, it hangs on loading, the last thing I see is "checking battery state..." and it just hangs there. I think it has to do with my graphics driver because I can load into failsafe graphics mode, and I also see [fail]  on starting load fallback graphics devices. Can somebody help please?

2011-05-01T04:16:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	use the Catalystic Control Center to configure it, not the option "Monitors"
2011-05-01T04:19:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	I'm sorry I don't understand... where do I find the catalyst control?
2011-05-01T04:19:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	under Applications check Catalystic
2011-05-01T04:20:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	I get an initialization error when trying to open the Catalyst Control Center: No ATI graphics driver is installed, or the ATI driver is not functioning properly
2011-05-01T04:21:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	disable the proprietary driver, reboot, enable it again
2011-05-01T04:21:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	do you know of a walk-through page for that?
2011-05-01T04:23:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	type in a terminal -> sudo /usr/bin/jockey-gtk and tell me if is anything loaded or disabled
2011-05-01T04:24:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	no proprietary drivers are in use on this system
2011-05-01T04:24:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	and nothing in there to be enabled?
2011-05-01T04:24:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	however I can choose to activate ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver on this window
2011-05-01T04:25:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	activate it
2011-05-01T04:25:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	it's downloading and installing. thank you... so when I reboot all should be good?
2011-05-01T04:26:00.000Z	lcb	Solnse	if not good DO NOT USE "Monitors" but the Catalystic Control Center
2011-05-01T04:26:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	ok.
2011-05-01T04:26:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	rebooting to try. thanks again.
2011-05-01T04:34:00.000Z	Solnse	lcb	thank you very much, now in Ubuntu 11 for the first time. will have fun learning the new GUI
