2008-06-21T02:18:00.000Z	apophis		Compiz is evil when direct rendering is used :OP
2008-06-21T02:18:00.000Z	apophis		compiz is already quite usable, but fails with direct rendering :)
2008-06-21T02:18:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	how can you use it then? I thought Compiz needed direct rendering. I know I can't use it.
2008-06-21T02:19:00.000Z	apophis	vocx	I mean if other software directly draws to the framebuffer, compiz does aswell, which means both application draw and dont know from each other! this gives flickering
2008-06-21T02:20:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	ah, but there is no way to use compiz with only software rendering right?
2008-06-21T02:21:00.000Z	apophis	vocx	well in principal it should be possible ;) but you dont want it (1 frame per 10 seconds) so its probably never been tried
2008-06-21T02:21:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	I know
2008-06-21T02:27:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	Turkey can't possibly defeat Germany, no way
2008-06-21T02:27:00.000Z	apophis	vocx	But I dont want Germany in a final :P
2008-06-21T02:27:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	no other way around it
2008-06-22T02:31:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	you kidding? Now I don't see how anybody can stop Germany!
2008-06-22T02:32:00.000Z	apophis	vocx	I havent said anything about germany today ;) however I am surprised about the russians
2008-06-22T02:35:00.000Z	vocx	apophis	now is the time for Spain to show they can win this stuff.
2008-06-22T02:35:00.000Z	apophis	vocx	spain, italy... wheres the difference
