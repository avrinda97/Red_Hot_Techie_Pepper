2007-08-29T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	how are you mounting your fat32?
2007-08-29T05:42:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	I mounted it when I did the install in a folder called /windows
2007-08-29T05:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	could you put the contents of /etc/fstab on a pastebin somewhere?
2007-08-29T05:43:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	I'm kind of new to this, how would I do that?
2007-08-29T05:46:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35483/
2007-08-29T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	that's odd, that's what it should be. Try touch /windows/testfile , see if the file gets created
2007-08-29T05:50:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	I can make "testfile" in the directory, but when I try to save an openoffice file it can't do it.
2007-08-29T05:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	and you're doing both as the same user?
2007-08-29T05:52:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	I don't think so. I think I did a sudo earlier so probably all my terminal commands are running with sudo permissions?
2007-08-29T05:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	no, you have to explictly sudo each and every command you want sudo to apply to
2007-08-29T05:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	unless you did a sudo -i or sudo -s?
2007-08-29T05:53:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	No. I didn't do that. The FAQ said to avoid doing that.
2007-08-29T05:53:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	I definately ran the command as <username>@computer
2007-08-29T05:53:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	Could open office be different? I've had trouble with all GUI applications actually.
2007-08-29T05:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	I don't have a clue, then. If you can touch a file, but open office can't write there, try writing to your home and copying as a short term fix. But the underlying issue, again, I don't have a clue
2007-08-29T05:55:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	All right. Thanks for your help.
2007-08-29T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Ray_at_UW	meant to ask: which UW?
2007-08-29T06:05:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	nickrud	I figured out my problem. I should chmod things. >.> I'm dumb.
