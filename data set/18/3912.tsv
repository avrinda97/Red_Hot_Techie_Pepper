2009-07-20T14:59:00.000Z	richardcavell		I use grsync
2009-07-20T15:01:00.000Z	richardcavell		that's brave
2009-07-20T15:01:00.000Z	richardcavell		I've been using computers for long enough that I know you make backups
2009-07-20T15:02:00.000Z	richardcavell		Anyone here know of remote desktop software that's better than the Ubuntu built in one?
2009-07-20T15:03:00.000Z	richardcavell		even over high bandwidth connection
2009-07-20T15:03:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	try NX
2009-07-20T15:04:00.000Z	richardcavell	deany	it requires installation on both client and server?
2009-07-20T15:04:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	i find ubuntus (vnc) works well, but try FreeNX , yes client and server
2009-07-20T15:04:00.000Z	richardcavell	deany	what package am I looking at?
2009-07-20T15:04:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	there is a guide if you google
2009-07-20T15:05:00.000Z	richardcavell	deany	okay.  It's not in the repos
2009-07-20T15:07:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	thought about ssh and X forwarding?
2009-07-20T15:08:00.000Z	richardcavell	deany	I'd like to do something like that I think
2009-07-20T15:08:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	remote use the app and not the whole desktop,
2009-07-20T15:08:00.000Z	richardcavell	deany	If remote desktop is unusable then it might as well not exist
2009-07-20T15:09:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	Ive used it over slow links and it works fine for me...  but either try NX server or ssh X forwarding.
2009-07-20T15:13:00.000Z	deany	richardcavell	nx relies on ssh anyway... so you`ll need that setup to use mx
2009-07-20T15:13:00.000Z	richardcavell	deany	my ssh server is working beautifully
