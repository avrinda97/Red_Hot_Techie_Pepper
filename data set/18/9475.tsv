2007-04-02T14:42:00.000Z	LjL	Jumbola	there's nothing too bad there. the WINE repository cannot be contacted - i guess it's just down right now - and there's another repository that doesn't really exist anymore, just remove it. the rest of the warnings is merely about GPG keys. you can ignore it or (better) follow the instructions at the beginning of your new sources.list to add the keys
2007-04-02T14:43:00.000Z	Jumbola	LjL	sir you want to say better i delete those ?
2007-04-02T14:43:00.000Z	LjL	Jumbola	i mean the media.blutkind.org repositories. they don't seem to exist anymore - yes, you can delete them. or let them stay, they won't do any harm aside from those warnings.
2007-04-02T14:44:00.000Z	Jumbola	LjL	Okie Sir thanks
