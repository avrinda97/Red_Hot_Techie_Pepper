2009-07-30T17:16:00.000Z	abbazabba		just installed ntfsprogs
2009-07-30T17:16:00.000Z	abbazabba		lets see
2009-07-30T17:18:00.000Z	abbazabba		before i throw all my info on this ntfs partition, both windows and linux could write/read/delete and everything off off ntfs partitions right?
2009-07-30T17:20:00.000Z	abbazabba		whats the average size for a swap partition?
2009-07-30T17:21:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	double your ram, unless you have plenty of.
2009-07-30T17:21:00.000Z	abbazabba	oldude67	i have 4gigs right now
2009-07-30T17:21:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	32 bit or 64 bit os?
2009-07-30T17:22:00.000Z	abbazabba	oldude67	64
2009-07-30T17:22:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	sorry i would give it some room..its new.
2009-07-30T17:22:00.000Z	abbazabba	oldude67	so you say a gig?
2009-07-30T17:24:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	how much hard drive space do you have?
2009-07-30T17:24:00.000Z	abbazabba	oldude67	500gb
2009-07-30T17:25:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	1 gig would do fine
2009-07-30T17:26:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	rule of thumb, always double your ram...
2009-07-30T17:27:00.000Z	abbazabba	oldude67	8 gigs! after that i could only double it once more ;D
2009-07-30T17:27:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	but in your case 1 gig should do.
2009-07-30T17:28:00.000Z	oldude67	abbazabba	8 is more then enough....unless you want to run all of linux at once.
