2006-10-15T05:33:00.000Z	seamus7		Anyone know if these two are exactly the same thing:  J2SE  and  JRE v.5 upd.8  ... if not what's the difference? (I'm picking add-ons for my Ubuntu installation)
2006-10-15T05:34:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	JRE is just the runtime enviroment and J2SE has the SDK also
2006-10-15T05:35:00.000Z	seamus7	kitche	do I likely need both as listed here as add-ons: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#Add-On_Applications
2006-10-15T05:36:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	you can it doesn't matter really though
2006-12-08T09:17:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	the one from sun's site does include a plugin if you have all your configs setup right
2006-12-08T09:21:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	the ubuntu packages is update 9
2006-12-08T09:22:00.000Z	seamus7	kitche	I used Automatix2 for the first time ... I had previously avoided it... and it seemed to install JRE update 8 .... I had thought it would install update 10
2006-12-08T09:22:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	well automatix is a bad thing to use anyways :P
2006-12-08T09:23:00.000Z	seamus7	kitche	I had heard that but thought I'd give it a try since its being actively developed
2006-12-08T09:24:00.000Z	seamus7	kitche	I generall use synaptic but i just installed edgy on my new laptop as a dual boot with winxp and was a bit tired so I opted for Automatix2
2006-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	ubuntu packages are known to work
2006-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	seamus7	kitche	gotcha thx everyone
2006-12-28T09:52:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	do this chroot /mp /bin/bash
2007-02-22T12:02:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	vfat is good also for a go between if you wish
2007-07-24T16:07:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	either /usr/local/ or /home/username/
2007-07-24T16:11:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	don't worry about /sbin/ you shouldn't touch /sbin/ at all on a running system
2007-07-24T16:31:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	chmod +x <bin>
2007-07-24T16:32:00.000Z	kitche	seamus7	no
