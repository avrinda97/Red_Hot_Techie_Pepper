2006-06-13T08:34:00.000Z	lonegeek		what are alternatives to gstreamer audio output
2006-06-13T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	xine, install totem-xine and libxine-extracodecs, and the w32codecs
2006-06-13T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	w32codecs, see below
2006-06-13T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud		!w32codecs
2006-06-13T08:36:00.000Z	lonegeek	nickrud	thats not what i need! xine is a sepeparate player ..which i already have...when in programs i want another option for playback engines
2006-06-13T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	totem can use either gstreamer or xine as the backend. You don't need to use the xine player, use totem-xine
2006-06-13T08:37:00.000Z	lonegeek	nickrud	i have that...but xine doesnt show up as a engine in banshee
2006-06-13T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	unless we're talking at cross purposes here
2006-06-13T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	ah, banshee. As best I can tell, banshee only uses gstreamer
2006-06-13T08:38:00.000Z	lonegeek	nickrud	that sucks because it over ampliys audio...
2006-06-13T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	strike that:  banshee only uses gstreamer
2006-06-13T08:38:00.000Z	lonegeek		amplifys
2006-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	gstreamer is supposed to be totally customizable, but looking for howtos? priceless
2006-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	lonegeek	nickrud	well in banshee and vlc...if i put volume to max...its too much volume and everything is garbled
2006-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	as an ex-bench tech, never put any control over 80%.
2006-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	lonegeek	look elsewhere for more amplification
2006-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	lonegeek	nickrud	well in banshee its about around 20 percent with master at 100percent and thats usually fine...for most stuff
2006-06-13T08:41:00.000Z	lonegeek	nickrud	it over amplifys
