2012-02-23T20:04:00.000Z	G__81_		hi i am using Ubuntu 11.10 and using the Unity interface. I have few problems. I am not able to change the boot order in Ubuntu. I tried the ways specified in the Ubuntu forums but it still stays @ Linux by default
2012-02-23T20:04:00.000Z	G__81_		can someone help me out
2012-02-23T20:04:00.000Z	tjkent	G__81_	elaborate
2012-02-23T20:05:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	What i did was i edited the grub.cfg and changed the GRUB_DEFAULT to saved and then i did sudo grub-set-default 5
2012-02-23T20:06:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	it still stays @ Linux by default. Startup Manager application does not change the order either
2012-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	?
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	tjkent	G__81_	ok walk me through this
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	yeah sure
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	tjkent	G__81_	you turn on your computer
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	tjkent	G__81_	grub loads
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	yes
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	tjkent	G__81_	you have the menu there
2012-02-23T20:10:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	the highlighted one is the first entry by default, even after i change the boot order. I got to press down arrow key to get to Windows if i have to boot it
2012-02-23T20:13:00.000Z	G__81_	tjkent	so thats the problem
2012-02-23T20:13:00.000Z	tjkent	G__81_	did you go to /boot/grub/menu.lst and change default
