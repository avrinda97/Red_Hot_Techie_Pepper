2010-05-09T00:01:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	you're in it !
2010-05-09T00:01:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	(there's also #ubuntu-server, but this one works too)
2010-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	from home to where?
2010-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	example?
2010-06-07T00:43:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	for us to help you, you need to answer questions
2010-06-07T00:43:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	what is a specific example of a directory you cannot copy?
2010-06-07T00:44:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	what is « ls -ld /home/user/test »
2010-06-07T00:45:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	that's not what I asked you to run.
2010-06-07T00:45:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	what is « ls -ld /home/user/test »?
2010-06-07T00:46:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	when I asked for an example, I meant an actual directory, so that this confusion wouldn't happen now.
2010-06-07T00:46:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	let's start over.
2010-06-07T00:47:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	good.  Can you verify that right clicking on ~/Temporary does not offer you the option to "copy"?
2010-06-07T00:48:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	press "reload" in nautilus
2010-06-07T00:49:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	that's pretty strange.  Can you verify you can copy the directory through a terminal?
2010-06-07T00:53:00.000Z	webroasters	jrib	it must have been that I had tried to create a new folder that never got created, because I tried to make a folder and everything went to hell for a sec, and then it all came back up. now i'm able to copy, etc.
2010-06-07T00:58:00.000Z	webroasters	jrib	thanks for your help, it must have been user error, as it is normally
2010-06-07T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	webroasters	no problem!
