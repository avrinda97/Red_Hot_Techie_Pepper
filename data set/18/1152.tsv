2012-05-06T02:34:00.000Z	Krenair		Hi. I've been having some weird trouble recently.
2012-05-06T02:34:00.000Z	Krenair		Every now and again my screen flashes and the whole UI stops responding. Only my cursor works.
2012-05-06T02:34:00.000Z	Krenair		This is with Ubuntu 11.04 with the classic desktop
2012-05-06T02:35:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	Radeon card?
2012-05-06T02:35:00.000Z	Krenair	stefg	no
2012-05-06T02:36:00.000Z	Krenair	stefg	NVidia GeForce GTS 250, IIRC
2012-05-06T02:37:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	ok... the fglrx driver sometimes does things like that, but with the nvidia driver you should be fine
2012-05-06T02:44:00.000Z	Krenair	stefg	might 'CPU0: Core temperature above threshold' messages in syslog have something to do with it?
2012-05-06T02:46:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	that's worth investigating
2012-05-06T02:48:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	i think that indicates a problem. So if the problem suddenly appeared, without any related software changes it's time for a hardware check
2012-05-06T02:50:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	check that your CPU fan is running, and still sitting tightly on top your CPU.
2012-05-06T02:52:00.000Z	Krenair	stefg	Truth be told I'm not sure how long I've been having this issue for.
2012-05-06T02:53:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	overheated CPU can cause weird symptoms... everything from flashing screens to sudden earthquakes
2012-05-06T02:58:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	I'd get a new pack of heat transfer paste, clean the box and all heat spreaders and reinstall the CPU fan for good measure. heat paste tends to get crumbly after a while
2012-05-06T02:59:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	installing a CPU temp monitor to keep an eye on it won't hurt too much
2012-05-06T03:01:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	can you ctrl-alt-f1 to a tty?
2012-05-06T03:02:00.000Z	Krenair	stefg	Next time it happens I'll do that. Thanks for the advice
2012-05-06T03:05:00.000Z	stefg	Krenair	although it's not pretty the box seems reasonably clean. But vacuum cleaning the CPU fan (when box is switched off) would help
