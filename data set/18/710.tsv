2011-10-15T20:15:00.000Z	john32		i actually think it's kind of nice lol, just came back from KDE takes some getting used to
2011-10-15T20:17:00.000Z	john32		oh LjL yeah i only came back to it just then
2011-10-15T20:17:00.000Z	john32		gnome 2 sucks lol i left it because it's crap
2011-10-15T20:17:00.000Z	john32		how different is ubuntu's default to the gnome 3 default
2011-10-15T20:18:00.000Z	john32		or use your package manager program
2011-10-15T20:19:00.000Z	john32		that's upstream
2011-10-15T20:21:00.000Z	john32		not to mention gnome2 probably has bugs that will never get fixed as it's unsupported
2011-10-15T20:21:00.000Z	john32		just go with the flow :) or try lxde it's quite similar to old gnome2 but a lot faster
2011-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	john32		aka lubuntu
2011-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	john32		you can in unity by clicking pin to panel if that's what you're asking
2011-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	dark_eye	john32	Gnome2 distros fixes themselves those
2011-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	john32	dark_eye	and they're a lot smaller with a lot less resources so none of the big distros are gonna stick with gnome 2
2011-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	john32		its like tying to find a distro that ships with kde3
2011-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	dark_eye	john32	it's not, you can easily find gnome2 distros
2011-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	dark_eye	john32	Ever heard RHEL, Scientific Linux, CentOS, Fuduntu?
2011-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	john32	dark_eye	ones that are just gnome 2 because they haven't upgraded yet lol
2011-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	john32	dark_eye	centos will most certainly go to gnome 3 in future releases as will rhel
2011-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	dark_eye	john32	upgrade? You mean downgrade?
