2007-04-25T11:56:00.000Z	imbecile		 :/ I have an exe file I want to run with wine on my desktop (its an installer) how do I do this?
2007-04-25T11:42:00.000Z	imbecile		what do i open .bin files with?
2007-04-25T11:43:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	just run it
2007-04-25T11:43:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	./program.bin
2007-04-25T11:43:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	chmod +x program.bin if it doesn't work
2007-04-25T11:43:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	that makes the program executable
2007-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	imbecile	Enselic__	 cool thanks, yeah it wanted to open with virus scanner rather than file roller
2007-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	what kind of .bin is it? where did you get it from?
2007-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	imbecile	Enselic__	 its legit.. google earth
2007-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	if you downloaded from google then you should be safe. I don't know of any virus programs for Linux ^^
2007-04-25T11:48:00.000Z	imbecile	Enselic__	 I saw some guy with a skimask on the corner of astalivista and a cracker website handing them out ;P
2007-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	imbecile	Enselic__	 si all i would do is go the directory and type "chmod +x GoogleEarthLinux.bin" ?
2007-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	nope, that will only make the file executable
2007-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	when it is, you run it with ./Google....bin
2007-04-25T11:53:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	you must prefix with ./ because UNIX needs you to run stuff by telling directory paths
2007-04-25T11:53:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	(. is the current directory)
2007-04-25T11:54:00.000Z	imbecile	Enselic__	 you are a good teacher..  most people just give quick answers.. u actually explain them.. thanks for teaching me how to fish
2007-04-25T11:55:00.000Z	Enselic__	imbecile	np, I learn better by explaining :)
