2007-05-22T13:47:00.000Z	pjman		My USB hard drive is getting I/O errors on a fresh Feisty install. The USB drive works fine under the LiveCD. Does anyone have any ideas?
2007-05-22T13:47:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	 check the forum for your exact error msg
2007-05-22T13:48:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	I don't know what you mean by check the forum... I have a thread opened but no one has replied. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=449562
2007-05-22T13:49:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	 use the search feature to search for the error msg for otther ppl with the same problem and the replys they got with the fixes they tried
2007-05-22T13:51:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	is this a common problem? I have searched the forum to no avail.
2007-05-22T13:52:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	 you'Ve hardlybeen gone 5 minustes you can'T have searched that much,  try searching for usb i/o problemes or other possible keywords,  show some initiative
2007-05-22T13:54:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	I've been working on this problem for going on three weeks now. I've been on this IRC channel multiple times over the past two weeks. No one has a clue to my problem. I keep checking back every couple of days hoping someone will have some ideas.
2007-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	that was the best I could do for you sorry  maybe there is a problem with your disk istelf, try it on a different computer
2007-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	Thanks for taking a look. The drive itself is fine. It works fine under Windows and Ubuntu Feisty Live CD. Something is different between the way Ubuntu handles USB drives from the Live CD and a full installation.
2007-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	 I assume you have tried restarting the comp?  how do other usb mass storage devices do ?
2007-05-22T13:58:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	Yes, I have tired restarting the computer. You need to restart to use the Live CD :-) My USB memory stick works fine on this machine.
2007-05-22T13:59:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	I've narrowed it down to software. The hard drive is fine. It works fine when I boot up with the Live CD. Something is different from the Live CD and the actual install - I just don't know what
2007-05-22T14:00:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	 I wouldnT' think so
2007-05-22T14:00:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	either would I...
2007-08-23T08:33:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	 pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2007-08-23T08:34:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	there is no "menu.lst" as I'm trying to create it using the grub utility
2007-08-23T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo	pjman	then you better ask in #grub
2007-08-23T08:35:00.000Z	pjman	Pelo	thx, I'll try that
