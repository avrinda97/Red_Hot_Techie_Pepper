2012-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	after 10.10 there is 11.04 -> 11.10 -> 12.04 (current Long term support version)
2012-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	why are you telling me this?
2012-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	read the line after that line - it was a wrong nick-usage
2012-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	ah no biggie, lol
2012-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	gnome 3 the shell?
2012-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	yep
2012-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	It uses mutter.
2012-10-05T10:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	YOu can restart it with alt-f2 r if needed.
2012-10-05T10:21:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	yep i know that keycombo - whyever it isnt offering the alt-f2 dialog anymore (talking about a virtual install here)
2012-10-05T10:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	Virtual should run the same, is it the gnome fall back
2012-10-05T10:23:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	anyway - executing gnome-shell --replace doesnt change it
2012-10-05T10:23:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	so i doubt alt+f2 -> r would help ;)
2012-10-05T10:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	This vbox it does use its own drivers so that may be the problem, but I have run it in vbox with no problems.
2012-10-05T10:24:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	its vmware in my case
2012-10-05T10:24:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	and it worked before the last updates ..but anyway ignore it. gonna find some other ways to continue testing
2012-10-05T10:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	Ah well you might ask them #vmware
2012-10-05T10:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fidel	This 12.10?
2012-10-05T10:25:00.000Z	fidel	wilee-nilee	yep -> #ubuntu+1 ?
