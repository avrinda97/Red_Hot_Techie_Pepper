2010-05-20T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	ok partitions
2010-05-20T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	so a Windows parttion  for which version? and a partition that has data on it?
2010-05-20T02:02:00.000Z	eddvrs	sebsebseb	yes- I've XP installed on the first 30GiB, then an 80(ish)GiB partition. Both have data, but first is completely full...
2010-05-20T02:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	the XP partition is full?
2010-05-20T02:04:00.000Z	eddvrs	sebsebseb	yes.
2010-05-20T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	so full that, XP won't work?
2010-05-20T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	have you got an external hard disk or something like that, to back up data to?  If not you should have one really
2010-05-20T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	since hard disks can just fail
2010-05-20T02:06:00.000Z	eddvrs	sebsebseb	I do have another internal HDD that i use for important documents.
2010-05-20T02:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	using gparted to re size XP partitions or other partitions,  will probably go rather fine indeed, but a slight chance of data loss even so I guess, altough never happended to me
2010-05-20T02:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	and I have done this kind of stuff a lot
2010-05-20T02:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	it's Vista where you would want to let it resize itself first, so you don't get  data loss, but Gparted is fine for re sizing XP
2010-05-20T02:08:00.000Z	eddvrs	sebsebseb	OK. Thanks. I was thinking- defrag first, shrink the second part, then move it. then enlarge the first partition? anything else?
2010-05-20T02:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	you can defrag first, but you probably won't get data loss by resiznig it if you don't.  however then again your XP partition is rather full. and so when it comes to resizing XP  you can only make it bigger I guess, when you have unalloacted space
2010-05-20T02:12:00.000Z	eddvrs	sebsebseb	Thanks for your time mate. *I'm going in*
2010-05-20T02:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	going in?
2010-05-20T02:14:00.000Z	eddvrs	sebsebseb	going to give it a go- see how I get on.
2010-05-20T02:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	eddvrs	ok good luck
