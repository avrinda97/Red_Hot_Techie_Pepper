2009-03-06T11:31:00.000Z	KyleGP		Hi all
2009-03-06T11:31:00.000Z	KyleGP		Im new to ubuntu, been posting on the forums, wondering if anyone can help me out with a few things
2009-03-06T11:32:00.000Z	KyleGP		Okay, so Metacity is ubuntus default. Emerald is a window themer, what exactly is GTK?
2009-03-06T11:33:00.000Z	KyleGP		and GTK runs using Compiz?
2009-03-06T11:33:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	emerald is a decorator for compiz (a window manager), gtk-window-decorator is the default decorator for compiz (which uses the same theme as the metacity window managger)
2009-03-06T11:33:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	gtk-window-decorator has gtk in its name not because it uses gtk themes, but because it uses the gtk toolkit
2009-03-06T11:34:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	you want metacity themes
2009-03-06T11:34:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	oh, the panel is just a gtk app, so it's themed like any other application
2009-03-06T11:37:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	they're just gtk apps like any other on your gnome system
2009-03-06T11:38:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	some gtk themes such as murrine special-case the panel so that they can apply a different background to it
2009-03-06T11:40:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	yes, they changed their gtk theme too
2009-03-06T11:40:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	notice that the "controls" inside the apps, like scrollbars match it too

2009-03-06T11:43:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	if it doesn't do it automatically, yeah
2009-03-06T11:44:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	you probably want both of them
2009-03-06T11:44:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	gtk is the window contents, emerald is your window borders
2009-03-06T11:45:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	because it's just an window without borders :)
2009-03-06T11:47:00.000Z	crdlb	KyleGP	metacity themes are also for the window border, but only when you're not using emerald
