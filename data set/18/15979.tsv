2005-04-19T07:46:00.000Z	wezzer		but rhytmbox says "segmentation faul" everytime I try to play mp3-file
2005-04-19T07:47:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	run 'sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad'
2005-04-19T07:47:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	If that does not succeed, check ubuntuguide.org for how to add repositories, and then try again.
2005-04-19T07:48:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	run 'sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad'
2005-04-19T07:48:00.000Z	wezzer	ericf	thanks
2005-04-19T07:54:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	Does it happen with a specific mp3, or all of them?
2005-04-19T07:54:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	did you just install hoary from a cd?
2005-04-19T07:55:00.000Z	wezzer	ericf	nope, I upgraded from warty
2005-04-19T07:55:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	Did you do an apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2005-04-19T07:55:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	weird
2005-04-19T07:57:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	I would make sure that everything is upgraded well, and then I wouldn't know...
2005-04-19T07:58:00.000Z	wezzer	ericf	updatenotifier just found some new packages
2005-04-19T07:58:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	dont use it now, it does not do a dist-upgrade
2005-04-19T07:59:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	open a terminal, get root with 'sudo -s', then run 'apt-get update', then 'apt-get dist-upgrade'
2005-04-19T08:07:00.000Z	wezzer	ericf	now it works!
2005-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	ericf	wezzer	Good job.
