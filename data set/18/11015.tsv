2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	JackONeill		NO no your missing the point - out of the two I said... which one performs better?
2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	JackONeill		That biast basing on the manufacturer or the actual qualities?
2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	JackONeill		Yeah like I thought, none of you have any idea
2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	JackONeill		Useless!
2006-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	JackONeill		Jack_Sparrow... THATS NOT THE QUESTION!
2006-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	JackONeill		Jeez
2006-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	JackONeill		I'm not saying... Linux or Windows.... OR! Nvidia or ATI
2006-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	JackONeill		Would a Nvidia 6200 256mb be better than an Ati Radeon 9500 128mb ?
2006-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	JackONeill		THAT is what I asked
2006-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	wols_	JackONeill	it is. you cannot divide the driver from the hardware in graphiccards
2006-09-26T06:00:00.000Z	wols_	JackONeill	and you are TOTALLY OFF TOPIC in here. this is NOT #hardware
2006-09-26T06:00:00.000Z	wols_	JackONeill	if you ask in here you will get Linux (to be specific Ubuntu) answers. none other
2006-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	wols_	JackONeill	so maybe check where you are before asking next time, k?
2006-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	JackONeill	wols_	- Well after I have decided on the better card comes the linux issue - or I wouldnt be here
2006-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	wols_	JackONeill	please watch your language
2006-09-26T06:18:00.000Z	wols_	JackONeill	please don't advocate illegal behaviour
2006-09-26T06:18:00.000Z	JackONeill	wols_	- No I am being honest... don't be such a dictator
