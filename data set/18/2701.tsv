2010-03-27T06:13:00.000Z	puff		I just got a bluetooth headset, WEP870.  It's paired now, how do I tell amarok to play the audio over it?
2010-03-27T06:14:00.000Z	puff		Yeah.
2010-03-27T06:14:00.000Z	ceno	puff	right click on the speaker next to the clock, sound preferences
2010-03-27T06:21:00.000Z	ceno	puff	is your bluetooth listed under the Hardware tab?
2010-03-27T06:21:00.000Z	puff	ceno	I don't see it there.
2010-03-27T06:22:00.000Z	ceno	puff	well i never used bluetooth. I thought that when you said it was paired, you meant it was working already
2010-03-27T06:22:00.000Z	puff	ceno	The bluetooth control shows it, but I don't see anything in the sound preferences that is clearly the device.
2010-03-27T06:23:00.000Z	puff	ceno	In the bluetooth control panel it shows up as WEP870.
2010-03-27T06:24:00.000Z	ceno	puff	that's good I guess, but I guess pulseaudio isn't really recognizing it. It's not listed under the output tab in sound preferences too, right?
2010-03-27T06:24:00.000Z	puff	ceno	Not that I can see... unless it's being listed as something else.
2010-03-27T06:25:00.000Z	ceno	puff	hm... do you have more than one option?
2010-03-27T06:27:00.000Z	puff	ceno	Yeah, the dropdown defaults to Intel ICH6 (alsa Mixer), also has "Analog Devices AD1981B (OSS Mixer)", "Playback: ALSA PCM on front:0 (Intel ICH6) via DMA (PulseAudio Mixer)" and two capture options.
2010-03-27T06:27:00.000Z	ceno	puff	are you running ubuntu 9.10?
2010-03-27T06:28:00.000Z	puff	ceno	No, intrepid.  I really need to upgrade, but I'm stuck in a catch-22.
2010-03-27T06:28:00.000Z	ceno	puff	oooohhhh
2010-03-27T06:28:00.000Z	puff	ceno	I need to resize partitions before upgrading, I need to backup before resizing, I need to find the power supply for my portable drive before I can backup...
2010-03-27T06:30:00.000Z	ceno	puff	if you were running ubuntu 9.10 you'd see something like this and ur life would be easier: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/167159/sound_preferences.png
2010-03-27T06:31:00.000Z	ceno	puff	in intrepid I don't know how to help you at all, sorry
