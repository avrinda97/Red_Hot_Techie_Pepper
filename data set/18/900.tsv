2011-09-13T18:17:00.000Z	martian		Is there a way to alias one dns for another, so I could have my client system recognize 'home' to be the same as 'blahblah.dyndns.org'?
2011-09-13T18:18:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	add an entry to /etc/hosts
2011-09-13T18:21:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	you want to be able to ssh to your machine from any other client?
2011-09-13T18:22:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	I have a dyndns set up which works fine. I can ssh to my home system at ease. I just thought it would be _nice_ to be able to alias a longer dns to a shorter one
2011-09-13T18:23:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	you want to be able to type 'ssh home' at any other client instead of (say) 'ssh home.mydyndns.org'?
2011-09-13T18:24:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	right, but if I simply alias 'home' to my actual home IP in hosts, it won't work if my home IP changes
2011-09-13T18:26:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	well, i'd just go with a bash alias...
2011-09-13T18:27:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	yeah, but then other services (http, mail, etc) wouldn't work... ya know, I suppose the simplest solution would be to just set up a hosts entry and just deal with the IP change every few months :)
2011-09-13T18:34:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	Bored, and found this. There's a bash script half way down: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/637994/can-i-use-the-etc-hosts-file-to-configure-an-alias
2011-09-13T18:39:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	wow, that's nifty. Thanks!
2011-09-13T18:39:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	np. Looks better than a manual edit :)
2011-09-13T18:40:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	yeah, that would likely become a nuisance... or I could just be less lazy about typing =D
2011-09-13T18:40:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	auomation is good. Prevents those 'why has this suddenly stopped working!' moments...
2011-09-13T18:41:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	very true. What's funny is when a year down the line you can't for the life of you remember WHY it works
2011-09-13T18:42:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	indeed. Anyway - I hope it helps
2011-09-13T18:46:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	would a hard link instead of a ln -s make any difference?
2011-09-13T18:47:00.000Z	martian	somsip_	well, I guess this is one of those things that in my few years of being a mediocre linux user I have always just accepted and moved past: whenever I try to hard link a directory, I am told "ln: `/var/www': hard link not allowed for directory"
2011-09-13T18:48:00.000Z	somsip_	martian	can't say I've used them myself, but I get the feeling there might be some advantage in this situation. Maybe worthy of more research?
