2005-10-20T10:29:00.000Z	rapha		Hi all!
2005-10-20T10:30:00.000Z	rapha		How do I get the pid of a program I'm starting in a shell script?
2005-10-20T10:30:00.000Z	honey	rapha	echo $$
2005-10-20T10:32:00.000Z	rapha	honey	I assume something like "gedit & / pid=$$"?
2005-10-20T10:32:00.000Z	honey	rapha	ah no. $$ is the *current* process, i.e. the script
2005-10-20T10:33:00.000Z	rapha	honey	ah okay. Nah, I need the pid of the program I just started
2005-10-20T10:33:00.000Z	honey	rapha	try pidof?
2005-10-20T10:33:00.000Z	honey	rapha	there *might* be a shell variable for last child process, but i don't know it
2005-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	rapha	honey	there are more than one of it.
2005-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	honey	rapha	latest? :)
2005-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	honey	rapha	that isn't reliable :)
2005-10-20T10:36:00.000Z	rapha	honey	as a matter of fact, that always gets the first, not the last :)
2005-10-20T10:36:00.000Z	honey	rapha	s/head/tail/ :)
2005-10-20T10:39:00.000Z	rapha	honey	with pgrep it works
2005-10-20T10:39:00.000Z	honey	rapha	it works better? it should still find two... but i wouldn't rely on latest pid, they wrap
2005-10-20T10:40:00.000Z	rapha	honey	pgrep blah | sort -nr | head -n 1
2005-10-20T10:40:00.000Z	honey	rapha	as above :)
2005-10-20T10:40:00.000Z	rapha	honey	ya :-) ... interested in a nautilus script to display MD5 sum of selected files?
