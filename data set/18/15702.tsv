2005-02-15T06:06:00.000Z	socketbind		coyote linux for instance
2005-02-15T06:06:00.000Z	socketbind		it is a little floppy distro
2005-02-15T06:07:00.000Z	socketbind		put it in /usr/java scoon!
2005-02-15T06:07:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	not for me.  I have my "non-deb" stuff in /opt
2005-02-15T06:08:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	why MUST it go there ?
2005-02-15T06:09:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	what do you mean by not work properly ?
2005-02-15T06:09:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	still kinda vague.  anyway, i bet your problem is with gdm.
2005-02-15T06:11:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	gdm sets your PATH for you.
2005-02-15T06:11:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	so if you wanted to set up you CLASSPATH, you need something like .xsession or .xinitrc.
2005-02-15T06:11:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	yes and they only get read when you fire up a terminal.
2005-02-15T06:13:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	do you do any java programming ?
2005-02-15T06:14:00.000Z	socketbind	scoon	yes
2005-02-15T06:14:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	ever use java-gnome ?
2005-02-15T06:14:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/bin/view
2005-02-15T06:15:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	check that out and try to run one of the very trivial examples using either eclipse or netbeans.
2005-02-15T06:15:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	you when then discover what gdm has to do with java.
2005-02-15T06:16:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	ok.  never mind then.  swing is ok.  but the stuff that java-gnome is doing is pretty sweet.  and interesting as well.
2005-02-15T06:17:00.000Z	scoon	socketbind	mine works.  but it just illustrates what gdm has to do w/ java.
