2005-11-10T08:52:00.000Z	stevejesus		anyone*
2005-11-10T08:53:00.000Z	holycow	stevejesus	not me working great on a good number of nvidia enabled boxxen
2005-11-10T08:58:00.000Z	holycow	stevejesus	just ask your question, if someone knows they will answer
2005-11-10T09:17:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 you mean from the one i installed from the repo?
2005-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	holycow	stevejesus	no if you use the nvidia installer to remove nvidias drivers you just delete them
2005-11-10T09:19:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 oh, well i am about to do just the opposite:)  any suggestions?  the ones from the repo are not doing to well for me
2005-11-10T09:20:00.000Z	holycow	stevejesus	so when do you get performance issues?
2005-11-10T09:20:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 whenever anything is using opengl.  regardless of whether its a game of a screensaver.
2005-11-10T09:22:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 well, i do have a few older geforce cards lying around that would work.  however, this one had worked just fine in hoary.  i doubt its the card
2005-11-10T09:23:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 also works fine in xp:(
2005-11-10T09:24:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 well, i have the ones installed from repo via apt.  if you know how i can remove them properly i will gladly install them by hand.
2005-11-10T09:25:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 remove the drivers that i installed via apt.  i believe it was "nvidia-glx"
2005-11-10T09:26:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 i missed it, what was the command?
2005-11-10T09:26:00.000Z	holycow	stevejesus	why not use package manager then
2005-11-10T09:26:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 please bear with me.  i am new to apt.  i have migrated from rpm based distros
2005-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 i really dont want to wait for synaptic to load.  a quick command with proper flags would be great
2005-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	stevejesus	holycow	 thank you!
