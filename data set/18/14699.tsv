2005-06-25T07:10:00.000Z	Jamey		I have just installed Ubuntu (5.0.4) on my main machine. It has a 15in Samsung TFT; when the login prompt is supposed to appear, I get a garbled screen with the cursor clearly visible. Any ideas? Many thanks
2005-06-25T07:11:00.000Z	Jamey		try "apt-cache search mysql"
2005-06-25T07:11:00.000Z	Jamey		ciancil0, I'll try that thanks
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z	Jamey		try doing an "apt-cache search voice", onkarshinde
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z	Jamey		onkarshinde
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z	Jamey		or do a searhc in the package manager
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z	Jamey		*search
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z	Jamey		ciancil0: I've still got the same problem. It shows a garbled screen which I can only presume is the login GUI (I heard the sound effect, so it probably is)
2005-06-25T07:15:00.000Z	Jamey		I am having problems: after a normal install of Ubuntu 5.0.4, my TFT display is garbled when it reaches the logon GUI. I think it may be something to do with the resolution and/or refresh rate. Anybody?
2005-06-25T07:16:00.000Z	Jamey		Can somebody please reply to me? Thanks
