2006-09-30T14:37:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	it can be all sorts of things - bad mouse bad motherboard, the usb infrastructure can fall apart at times try the mouse in a different port it might help
2006-09-30T14:38:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	usb is not some kind of magic but it can feel like it sometimes
2006-09-30T14:39:00.000Z	eyedol	ompaul	my mouse is very new bought a couples of days ago
2006-09-30T14:39:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	means nothing really, now have you used other ports already?
2006-09-30T14:40:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	try a different mouse - if it works then it is the mouse?
2006-09-30T14:41:00.000Z	eyedol	ompaul	it does the same with every mouse I use, couldn't it be a video card driver issue?
2006-09-30T14:42:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	you suspect a video card that is a bit random is it not?
2006-09-30T14:43:00.000Z	eyedol	ompaul	is there a way to get running again with I have to reboot?
2006-09-30T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	does your on machine mouse work?
2006-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	as in synaptic mouse pad
2006-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	eyedol	ompaul	yep that works even if the usb mouse breaks
2006-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	I suggest you consult this web page, help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions and try some of the options, can you use a proper ps2 connection on the laptop?
2006-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	ompaul	eyedol	vis the ps2 if you can it is usually the best way to deal with mice issues
