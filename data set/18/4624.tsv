2010-09-30T05:02:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	you said you have a problem with your nvidia driver
2010-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	what model card do you have
2010-09-30T05:19:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	no it appears a 9800 isnt legacy, i thought it would be, but that driver lsits it as supported still
2010-09-30T05:20:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	not sure, its still not a good idea to try the unpackaged driver though
2010-09-30T05:22:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	yeah stick with that, and upgrade to 10.10 if you need some of the features or must have the newer nvidia driver
2010-09-30T05:23:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	dunno updated software and drivers :)
2010-09-30T05:25:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	i doubt it
2010-09-30T05:25:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	it will require a backport of the newer driver to 10.04
2010-09-30T05:26:00.000Z	acicula	kurt_	well its not stupidly complicated, but it may require software not rpesent on your sytem, or may be altogether incompatible with your Xserver, etc
