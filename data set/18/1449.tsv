2011-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	skiwithpete		hi, in 10.04 is there a way to boot to command prompt?
2011-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	skiwithpete		I've changed xinitrc and now I only get flickering
2011-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	skiwithpete		can't even ctrl+alt + Fkeys
2011-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	skiwithpete		just keeps flicking back
2011-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	skiwithpete		is there a way to boot to command prompt?
2011-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	skiwithpete		eh?
2011-04-07T15:38:00.000Z	skiwithpete		i know what I have to do, I just can't get to a prompt...
2011-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	skiwithpete		anyone?
2011-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	skiwithpete		need a prompt, x keeps flashing because of failed xinitrc
2011-04-07T15:41:00.000Z	skiwithpete		here's how I'll solve it:  I'll put a liveCD in and boot to that - then I'll change xinitrc - unless there's a way I can boot to prompt...
2011-04-07T15:42:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	skiwithpete	boot into recovery mode
2011-04-07T15:42:00.000Z	skiwithpete		how?
2011-04-07T15:42:00.000Z	skiwithpete	nunuyabiz	how - 10.04
2011-04-07T15:43:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	skiwithpete	I don't remember but in previous versions you hit esc and you get the grub menu.... I'll google it just a moment
2011-04-07T15:45:00.000Z	nunuyabiz		does someone remember how to get to the grub menu in 10.04...... in previous versions it was hit the esc key
2011-04-07T15:46:00.000Z	skiwithpete		not anymore
2011-04-07T15:47:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	skiwithpete	did you get that
2011-04-07T15:48:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	skiwithpete	when you are in the grub menu, arrow down to the recovery mode and hit enter then make the proer selection. you may want to select drop down to root
