2007-09-20T15:06:00.000Z	sotec_prod		haha, ok jerbear. real 'observationalist' of you. what an ignorant statement
2007-09-20T15:07:00.000Z	sotec_prod		I have worked in production many times. i am well aware of the ramifications of high throughput of product to meet a demand.
2007-09-20T15:08:00.000Z	sotec_prod		lol
2007-09-20T15:09:00.000Z	sotec_prod		again, not relevant to this discussion.
2007-09-20T15:09:00.000Z	sotec_prod		production is production, not matter the product.
2007-09-20T15:09:00.000Z	sotec_prod		no*
2007-09-20T15:11:00.000Z	sotec_prod		well, after working many different types of production lines, including industrial fryolators, business cards, restaurants, etc. there are plenty of common denominators. i don't need to ask you what your credentials are, because they are irrelevant to this discussion.
2007-09-20T15:13:00.000Z	sotec_prod		one word: PRODUCTION
2007-09-20T15:13:00.000Z	sotec_prod		two words: HIGH DEMAND
2007-09-20T15:14:00.000Z	sotec_prod		haha
2007-09-20T15:14:00.000Z	hmhowie	sotec_prod	jerbear and whoever else it may concern. can you continue this one in another chatroom?
2007-09-20T15:14:00.000Z	sotec_prod	jerbear	i agree to disagree
2007-09-20T15:15:00.000Z	hmhowie		|pastebin | KG1987
2007-09-20T15:15:00.000Z	sotec_prod		well, this has been quite fun, but i see that the internet chats haven't changed much. *ducks from the flying ego's*
2007-09-20T15:16:00.000Z	sotec_prod		ok, seriously, i'm done now.
2007-09-20T15:16:00.000Z	sotec_prod		i don't read blogs, i read articles.
2007-09-20T15:16:00.000Z	sotec_prod		So, does anyone have a positive review or opinion of the new Gutsy?
2007-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	hmhowie	sotec_prod	jerbear:please! enough!
