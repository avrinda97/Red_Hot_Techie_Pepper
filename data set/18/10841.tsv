2006-10-19T16:39:00.000Z	Isaacariah		right, im annoyed
2006-10-19T16:39:00.000Z	Isaacariah		whenever i take my eth0 down or up with ifconfig, it NEVER works
2006-10-19T16:39:00.000Z	Isaacariah		i have to go System>Admin>Network and do it from there
2006-10-19T16:39:00.000Z	Isaacariah		can someone please tell me why
2006-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	Isaacariah		wired
2006-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	Isaacariah		the ONLY way i can get it to work is by changing to a different profile in System>Administration>Networking
2006-10-19T16:41:00.000Z	Isaacariah		but when i bring the device back up i get nothing
2006-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	Isaacariah		no worries
2006-10-19T16:43:00.000Z	fluvvell	Isaacariah	I've seen ethernet cards which claim to be able to change the mac address, but I've never seen a utility to do it.
2006-10-19T16:43:00.000Z	Isaacariah	fluvvell	ifconfig does it
2006-10-19T16:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	Isaacariah	really? with which particular option?
2006-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	fluvvell	Isaacariah	you maybe right according to http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/changemac
2006-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	Isaacariah	fluvvell	I am right, technically, its in the ifconfig man page
2006-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	fluvvell	Isaacariah	yes but a little cryptic there.
2006-10-19T16:49:00.000Z	fluvvell	Isaacariah	and requires hardware and driver support.  I believe some nics are hard coded to a mac address
2006-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	Isaacariah	fluvvell	would that explain why when I try and change mine I get nothing?
2006-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	fluvvell	Isaacariah	what nic are you using?
