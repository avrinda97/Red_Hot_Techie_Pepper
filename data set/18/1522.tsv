2011-02-12T06:43:00.000Z	Starminn		Launching avast! Antivirus after I tried updating it, I'm getting this message: "An error occured in avast! engine: Invalid argument" -- any tips/suggestions?
2011-02-12T06:43:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	"tried" updating it? Do you mean to imply the update was unsuccessful?
2011-02-12T06:45:00.000Z	Starminn	computer13137	:) Well I can't say either way. I hit the button to, "Update the database" (I assume in reference to the known viruses, etc.) and after that it's been giving me this dialog upon launch of the application.
2011-02-12T06:46:00.000Z	Starminn		So I can't say if it was/wasn't succesfful -- only that it 'broke' it.
2011-02-12T06:47:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	have you tried reinstalling it? That would definitely fix the issue...it sounds like something got corrupt somewhere. I don't use Avast.
2011-02-12T06:48:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	if you can reproduce the problem on a fresh reinstall there maybe something wrong with the package.
2011-02-12T06:48:00.000Z	computer13137		I wasn't aware avast supported linux natively...
2011-02-12T06:48:00.000Z	Starminn	computer13137	Shame.. I was hoping to acvoid that. *shrug* Ah well. I'll reinstall. :) (Yeah, there's a Linux version)
2011-02-12T06:49:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	not saying it's the only solution but I don't use Avast myself. And it would definitely be easier.
2011-02-12T06:49:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	you're more than welcome to ask for other solutions. Just putting my two cents out there so at least somebody answers your question. :p
2011-02-12T06:49:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	why Avast on Linux anyway..?  I'm not too worried about linux viruses myself...
2011-02-12T06:50:00.000Z	Starminn	computer13137	Agreed. Reinstall is almost always easier. Just out of curiousity, what is your suggestion of Anti-Virus? (I really use it for Windows -> Linux -> Windows)
2011-02-12T06:50:00.000Z	Starminn	computer13137	Ditto. I use it so I don't contribute to Windows viruses. :)
2011-02-12T06:50:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	I usually use VirusTotal.com because I typically just want to scan a file\archive every now and then.
2011-02-12T06:50:00.000Z	computer13137	Starminn	but you have to upload the file to that.
2011-02-12T06:50:00.000Z	computer13137		Then they scan it with like 42 different AVs
2011-02-12T06:51:00.000Z	computer13137		If you only need it infrequently that would be fine.
2011-02-12T06:52:00.000Z	Starminn	computer13137	Ah, that's handy. :) Thanks for that. Well, I'll see you. :)
