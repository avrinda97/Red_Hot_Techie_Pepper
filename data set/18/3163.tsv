2011-07-28T08:30:00.000Z	mgj	blade	you make it sound like win7 has a horrible UI
2011-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	blade	mgj	i would not say that it just dont work for me..... i'm not big on a 900 meg service pack
2011-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	mgj	blade	what does a 900mb service pack have to do with UI?
2011-07-28T08:32:00.000Z	blade	mgj	not so much the UI that i dont like .... just you can not install the service pack and have a dual boot.....
2011-07-28T08:33:00.000Z	mgj	blade	i dont care, we were talking about UI
2011-07-28T08:33:00.000Z	mgj	blade	service packs and dual boot has _NOTHING_ to do with UI
2011-07-28T08:33:00.000Z	blade	mgj	dont take my statement as win-bashing i just like gnome better.... that was my point
2011-07-28T08:34:00.000Z	blade	mgj	and again i will say ...... I JUST LIKE GENOME BETTER.... sorry for stating my opinion ...
2011-07-28T08:34:00.000Z	mgj	blade	and my point was that "reminds you of win7" is a good thing. Win7 has a good UI. Its still horrible as an OS in many ways, but its UI works
2011-07-28T08:35:00.000Z	mgj	blade	dont martyr
2011-07-28T08:36:00.000Z	mgj	blade	can i ask if you are an American?
2011-07-28T08:37:00.000Z	blade	mgj	 the UI may "work" but that dont mean i have to like it....
2011-07-28T08:37:00.000Z	mgj	blade	ofcourse
2011-07-28T08:38:00.000Z	mgj	blade	but seeing how you jump the martyr wagon at the first sight of someone even slightly disagreeing with you (not really)...... lets stop talking about this
2011-07-28T08:38:00.000Z	blade	mgj	just a thought but if we are going to keep at this should we not take it to off topic?
2011-07-28T08:39:00.000Z	blade	mgj	lol agreed
2011-07-28T08:39:00.000Z	mgj	blade	IM JUST STATING MY OPINION OKAY!
2011-07-28T08:40:00.000Z	blade	mgj	okay
