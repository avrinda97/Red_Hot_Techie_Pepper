2007-09-24T12:50:00.000Z	magnetron		Hi. When i try to drag files from file roller and try to drop them on the desktop or in a folder, nothing happens. What's wrong?
2007-09-24T12:51:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	use the extract option
2007-09-24T12:51:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	so there is no drag-and-drop support in file roller?
2007-11-30T21:35:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	i know about wine
2007-11-30T21:36:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	are you using the winehq repo? instructions on the link i gave you
2007-11-30T21:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	no, im not even using ubuntu, i didnt need help btw
2007-12-12T02:48:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	ty
2008-02-13T00:19:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	those links say nothing about encoding video.
2008-02-13T00:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	not sure exactly, there are a few video editing programs out there, but im not really sure what theyre called, sorry for the bad factoid, i figured it would get you started at least
2008-02-13T00:21:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	i am trying to encode mpeg-4 files with ffmpeg, but somehow ubuntu removed the AAC support in it. so now i cannot convert videos to watch with my smartphone.
2008-02-13T00:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	sudo apt-get install faac     maybe help you?
2008-02-13T00:23:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	tried it, didn't help. ffmpeg says aac is a "unsupported format" even when the man page says ffmpeg supports aac
2008-02-13T00:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	if i remember correctly, ffmpeg has to be compiled with aac support, apparently the ubuntu package of it wasnt compiled in such a fashion
2008-02-13T00:24:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	that sux. should i contact the package maintainer?
2008-02-13T00:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	have you added the medibuntu repositories? its possible the ffmpeg package in there has aac support
2008-02-13T00:24:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	nice idea. thx, i'll try it
2008-02-13T00:33:00.000Z	magnetron	MasterShrek	adding the medibuntu repo upgraded ffmpeg to a version that supports mpeg4. thank you! I'm glad there are no software patents in Europe.
2008-02-13T00:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	magnetron	cheers :)
