2007-05-26T13:05:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	I have a 2.8ghz Celeron that was terrible with Ubuntu, runs fine with Xubuntu
2007-05-26T13:05:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	hmmm you must know something I don't maybe its that its a celeron laptop
2007-05-26T13:05:00.000Z	Znuff	zbrown	no idea :)
2007-05-26T13:05:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	Feisty?
2007-05-26T13:05:00.000Z	Znuff	zbrown	edgy

2007-05-26T13:06:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	can you do a cat /proc/cpuinfo and pastebin it for me?
2007-05-26T13:06:00.000Z	Znuff	zbrown	I'm not on that computer now. It's my home computer. And like I said, it's a Celeron @ 1.7Ghz
2007-05-26T13:06:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	hrm, well i want to compare some of the flags mainly, not interested in the speed etc./
2007-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	I did a feisty install on my dad's laptop with the 2.8 ghz Celreon w/ 1 gig of ram and it was UNBEARABLE in terms of speed
2007-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	Znuff	zbrown	SpeedStep maybe? Slow HDDs, etc.
2007-05-26T13:08:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	its got a 7200 rpm hdd in it
2007-05-26T13:08:00.000Z	zbrown	Znuff	and speedstep shouldn't have been an issue
2007-05-26T13:08:00.000Z	Znuff	zbrown	then I have no idea...
2007-05-26T13:09:00.000Z	Znuff	zbrown	I've actually run Xubuntu on a Celeron @ 900 Mhz with 256MB ram. And I upgraded from ubuntu to xubuntu ;)
