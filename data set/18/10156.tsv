2007-01-12T07:44:00.000Z	phixnay		is this a valid line for Grub?
2007-01-12T07:44:00.000Z	phixnay		kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet splash boot: noapic no1apic init=/sbin/bootchartd
2007-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	all grub sees is the kernel [path to kernel]  [options] , whereh [options]  are passed to the kernel itself.  So yes, that's valid for grub, no it may not be valid for the kernel.
2007-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	phixnay	Flannel	ok. I'll try it, and if not, I still have the one that works
2007-05-06T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	yes
2007-05-06T06:17:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	sudo lets you specificy exactly what they can and can't do.
2007-05-06T06:17:00.000Z	phixnay	Flannel	nice, how do I do that?
2007-05-06T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	you'll be editing sudoers (`sudo visudo` is the command to edit that).  Uh, there are examples all over the web (I'm not too familiar with the process), and I'm looking for a good one.
2007-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/sudo-guide.xml  in conjuction with http://ftp.debian.org/doc/sudo/examples/sudoers  might be a good place to start.  Basically all you'll be doing is specifying that [these users]  can run [thesecomamnds] , where thesecommands would be apt-get, and synaptic, or whatever.
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	http://www.debianadmin.com/providing-root-privileges-for-users-using-sudo.html#more-123  has a more simple example
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	phixnay	Flannel	ok, great. thanks for telling me all this
2007-05-06T06:25:00.000Z	phixnay	Flannel	alright, since normal sudo refers to root, would I create a user with synaptic privileges called "midlvl" and then have everybody do "sudo midlvl synaptic?
2007-05-06T06:33:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	yeah.  Sudo isn't an "all or nothing" thing like root is.  It just defaults that way.  Uh, well, first (in the second debain link, debian administration), you'd alias the users (just like at the top of the example), ... actually, that example (the short one) is... exactly what yo want
2007-07-22T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	that first link has a bunch of alternative methods, depending on what you have at your disposal
2007-09-14T10:14:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	#ubuntu+1 for gutsy questions, thanks.
2007-09-14T10:14:00.000Z	phixnay	Flannel	since I don't have gutsy yet, I think it's a feisty question
2007-09-14T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	phixnay	no, it's a gutsy question.  You'll need to make sure you have feisty-proposed enabled, and some other stuff, I dont know the details.  (Its a development version question because that upgrade isn't official yet)
2007-09-14T10:16:00.000Z	phixnay	Flannel	ok, I see what you meen
