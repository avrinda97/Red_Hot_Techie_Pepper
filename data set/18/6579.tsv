2008-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	gunpuncher	CVirus	0%
2008-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	lots of friends say it's really slow
2008-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	gunpuncher	CVirus	slow in what respect
2008-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	slow as in windows vista .. lol
2008-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	even with special effects disabled
2008-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	cpu spikes happen all the time and some laptops over heat
2008-04-28T15:33:00.000Z	gunpuncher	CVirus	I'm still waiting for the explanation of why your friends think 8.04 is slow
2008-04-28T15:34:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	will ask my friends first
2008-04-28T15:35:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	a couple of days
2008-04-28T15:36:00.000Z	gunpuncher	CVirus	so you would repeat the opinion of people who have used unix for a couple of days?
2008-04-28T15:37:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	I'm talking about 8.04
2008-04-28T15:37:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	I used ubuntu myself for over a year
2008-04-28T15:37:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	can't deny the fact that binary distros suck big time .... anyways
2008-04-28T15:37:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	I'm recommending ubuntu for all my friends
2008-04-28T15:38:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	and suddenly 2-3 of them started complaining about hardy ... which is weird
2008-04-28T15:38:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	true
2008-04-28T15:39:00.000Z	CVirus	gunpuncher	is that something new added to hardy ?
