2008-08-16T01:30:00.000Z	daemon3		Whenever I open a text file from a network in gedit, gedit randomly crashes.  Does anyone else have this problem? Or are you guys traditionalists with the command line?
2008-08-16T01:31:00.000Z	daemon3		:)
2008-08-16T01:31:00.000Z	deeperror	daemon3	anything in the logs? try running it from command line?
2008-08-16T01:32:00.000Z	daemon3		It will take a while beofore it crashes.
2008-08-16T01:32:00.000Z	daemon3		But it is annoying.
2008-08-16T01:32:00.000Z	deeperror	daemon3	or try from command line   'gedit filename.txt'
2008-08-16T01:32:00.000Z	deeperror		see if that outputs anything
2008-08-16T01:34:00.000Z	daemon3		I can't run gedit with the command line.
2008-08-16T01:34:00.000Z	daemon3		The server I'm using doesn't have a GUI.
2008-08-16T01:35:00.000Z	daemon3		I KNOW ALL ABOUT THOSE!
2008-08-16T01:35:00.000Z	daemon3		The problem was gedit crashing occasionally when I opened a file on a server, Flannel and Mecha25
2008-08-16T01:36:00.000Z	daemon3		gedit: command not found.
2008-08-16T01:36:00.000Z	daemon3		That's because the server is a terminal-based server.
2008-08-16T01:36:00.000Z	daemon3		No GUI.
2008-08-16T01:36:00.000Z	deeperror	daemon3	then how does gedit crash when you try to use it?
2008-08-16T01:37:00.000Z	daemon3		THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, Flannel.
2008-08-16T01:37:00.000Z	daemon3		Sorry for "yelling."
2008-08-16T01:37:00.000Z	daemon3	deeperror	I don't know what I do.  It just randomly crashes.
