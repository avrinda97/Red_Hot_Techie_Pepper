2010-06-30T02:26:00.000Z	daniel		hey guys I have problem I cant start my firefox just from terminal why?
2010-06-30T02:26:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	how are you trying to launch firefox outside of the terminal? can you try /usr/bin/firefox ?
2010-06-30T02:39:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	please tell me how to write in my terminal , then can I fix it :)
2010-06-30T02:28:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	Im tried the 2 ways alt f2 + ctrl
2010-06-30T02:29:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	have you used the full path? /usr/bin/firefox ? instead of just firefox?
2010-06-30T02:29:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	no will I try that?.
2010-06-30T02:33:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	oh.. when you're launching firefox in terminal.. you're doing it as root? does it launch as your normal user?
2010-06-30T02:35:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	can you launch firefox in a terminal as YOUR user?
2010-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	NO
2010-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	what does it give you when you type firefox in a terminal window?
2010-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	it gives me nothing nothing happens
2010-06-30T02:36:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	I must do sudo bash first then can I write firefox
2010-06-30T02:37:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	seems like the issue is with your .mozilla (and your account)
2010-06-30T02:37:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	have you tried to mv ~/.mozilla ~/mozillaold and reopen mozilla?
2010-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	reinstalling firefox will not do anything to ~/.mozilla
2010-06-30T02:42:00.000Z	daniel	benkevan	thanks it worked.!
2010-06-30T02:42:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	no problem
2010-06-30T02:42:00.000Z	benkevan	daniel	you'll be missing your history and bookmarks..
