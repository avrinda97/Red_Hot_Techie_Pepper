2008-02-14T01:05:00.000Z	ScorpKing		i'm trying to mount a nfs disk from a livecd with sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.1:/home/data /mnt/ but i get "wrong fs type or bad option". what am i doing wrong?
2008-02-14T01:07:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	try sudo mount 192.168.2.1/home/data /mnt (although you may need to create a mount point in /mnt as well and mount as /mnt/mountpoint
2008-02-14T01:08:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	sorry, forgot the : after the "192.168.2.1:"

2008-02-14T01:09:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	thanks. not working but will keep trying
2008-02-14T01:09:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	if you're on gutsy here's the correct link https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/server/C/network-file-system.html
2008-02-14T01:10:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	i mount using fstab (i know you're on the livecd) but my command is server:/media/removable /media/Backup nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr 0 0
2008-02-14T01:12:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	yeah, i've done it a lot of times before but not sure what's going on today. i'll try fstab then
2008-02-14T01:13:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	just a thought try "sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart", also does the machine you're trying to mount have a restiction on what ip address/hostname can connect via nfs?
2008-02-14T01:15:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	with you using the livecd, maybe the hostname/ip isn't an allowed one
2008-02-14T01:15:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	nope. that's not it. it will say permission denied in that case
2008-02-14T01:18:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	this is what i'm trying - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DDtoNFS - i created that page btw
2008-02-14T01:20:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	i see you're installing portmap, do you also need the nfs-kernel-server?
2008-02-14T01:21:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	portmap is only to speed things up. you only need nfs-kernel-server on the server afaik. booting a 7.04 cd now
2008-02-14T01:24:00.000Z	dgjones	ScorpKing	not sure what to suggest, i'll have a think anyway
2008-02-14T01:25:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	thanks anyway. i think there are some things not loaded on the 7.10 disk. will let you know ;)
2008-02-14T01:31:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	it works on the 7.04 disk and there's no nfs packages installed. weird
2008-02-14T01:39:00.000Z	ScorpKing	dgjones	i'm done. thanks for the suggestions :)
