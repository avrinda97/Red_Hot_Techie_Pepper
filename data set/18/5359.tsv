2009-02-03T14:04:00.000Z	Out_Cold		well i offline all the time now Elecktra
2009-02-03T14:06:00.000Z	Out_Cold		so i'm trying to figure out why i can't set up my wifi when starting without gui.... i can't seem to ifup eth1 due to "device not configured" or some similar garbage..
2009-02-03T14:06:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	is this an ethernet connection?
2009-02-03T14:07:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ziroday	no... but i don't seem to have a wlan connection
2009-02-03T14:07:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ziroday	yet i'm not connected with a ethernet..
2009-02-03T14:07:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	sorry, what exactly are you trying to do?
2009-02-03T14:08:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ziroday	when i boot up without a gui, i can't seem to get my wifi going.... i try ifup wlan0, ifup eth0/1 but no avail
2009-02-03T14:09:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	how come you're booting without a GUI?
2009-02-03T14:09:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	right, well wifi isn't the easiest thing to setup from the command line :). Ethernet is easier.
2009-02-03T14:10:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ziroday	yea i figured so... it's been a daunting task so far... i can switch to CLI after i have logged into a gui, but w/o is a huge pain.
2009-02-03T14:12:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	nothing like that exists AFAIK
2009-02-03T14:13:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	does the wifi network have encryption on it?
2009-02-03T14:14:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	okay, well you will have to edit /etc/network/interfaces
2009-02-03T14:15:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	see http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
2009-02-03T14:16:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	I can tell you know, its not simple
2009-02-03T14:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ziroday	after doing some more digging, i believe this is more along my lines... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=12045
2009-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	that will work too, its just less in depth then the article I gave you before :)
2009-02-03T14:41:00.000Z	ziroday	Out_Cold	you can also do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
