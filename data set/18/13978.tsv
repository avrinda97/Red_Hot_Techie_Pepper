2005-10-16T13:26:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	i've always used reiserfs in debian and ubuntu, and without problems
2005-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	I use ReiserFS on my laptop too (see above line)
2005-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	yes i read that :p
2005-10-16T13:28:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	Now that Reiser4 is out, is it any good ?
2005-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	don't know, but i would not recommend taking any risk losing all your stuff
2005-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	What's so special about XFS ?
2005-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	i even use reiserfs on LVM and RAID etc, nice is that you can resize partitions on-the-fly
2005-10-16T13:30:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/extendlv.html :) and XFS can handle really laaaarge filesystems
2005-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	I just need a desktop, not a server... And I need something stable AT LEAST as NTFS (yeah, you can laugh!) My windows works with NTFS...
2005-10-16T13:32:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	yes i know, i can recommend reiserfs, but i never used ext3 much, so im not an expert to tell differences
2005-10-16T13:34:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	I have ReiserFS on my laptop and I use Beagle, and it works, But some people say it works much slower then EXT3... I wasn't able to use EXT3 on my laptop because INODES didn't like each other and kept fighting.. it was installed, and after you finished setting all your stuff and reboot (FS was clean) all INODES starting to go bezerk.... (maybe because it's a old Hard drive, but NTFS didn't make these problems)...
2005-10-16T13:39:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	http://kerneltrap.org/node/5654 (search for 'slow' :) ) v4 is faster, but it's unlikely you would experience difference on a workatstion
2005-10-16T13:40:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	Yeah, but I understand Beagle works diffrently, so that's why it works slow with ReiserFS (evenm though I got it to work on my old laptop)
2005-10-16T13:44:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	This Hans Reiser is a smart guy (reading the interview)
2005-10-16T14:01:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	If I choose ReiserFS from the Breezy Installer, what version will I get ? 4 or 3 ?
2005-10-16T14:02:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	Is ResierFS managable to upgrade ? 3.6 to 4 ? like EXT2 to EXT3 ?
2005-10-16T14:02:00.000Z	Knorrie	LaserLine	i dont know
2005-10-16T14:03:00.000Z	LaserLine	Knorrie	From the interview you sent me, I didn't understand if Beagle is suppoed to work faster or slower the EXT3 (I know the XTTR is available for ReiserFS 3 in hoary)
