2006-08-05T10:20:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	are you wiping out the entire drive
2006-08-05T10:20:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	aujordanh	yes
2006-08-05T10:20:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	 delete all of the partitions repartition it how you like it, then write your changes
2006-08-05T10:21:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	you delete a partition, it turns it into free space, you delete two and they are combined as free space
2006-08-05T10:21:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	aujordanh	gotcha
2006-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	whats the problem??
2006-08-05T10:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	aujordanh	 i have a drive i took from another machine. i put it in a linux machine and i'm trying to format it but it doesnt show up in fdisk just in Disk Manager (as /dev/hdb)
2006-08-05T10:31:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	is the drive mounted?
2006-08-05T10:31:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	aujordanh	no.
2006-08-05T10:32:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	aujordanh	 can i format a drive without mounting it, or mount a unformatted drive?
2006-08-05T10:33:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	no, yes
2006-08-05T10:33:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	aujordanh	 how do i mount it?
2006-08-05T10:33:00.000Z	aujordanh	nicholaspaul	it has to be mounted to manipulate it (I think, we are about at the extent of my knowledge)
