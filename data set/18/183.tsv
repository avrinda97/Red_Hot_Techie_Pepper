2012-06-28T21:35:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	Sounds like your camera is not supported properly.

2012-06-28T21:37:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	Would need to know the exact make and model of your camera.

2012-06-28T21:42:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	That was for you.. A QuickCam? I need a model dude. Not just a brand.

2012-06-28T21:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	lsusb | |grep Logitech   And paste me the one line referencing your camera, please.
2012-06-28T21:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	Ahhh, that sounds more like a bug in Skype,.
2012-06-28T21:48:00.000Z	SocialEvil	Psi-Jack	Bus 005 Device 002: ID 046d:092f Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Express Plus
2012-06-28T21:49:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	That's a pretty old camera, yes. Supported back in 7.04-7.04, and no longer really maintained, so may not be perfect.
2012-06-28T21:49:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	So, either the camera, or Skype is not working properly.
2012-06-28T21:50:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	Based on your changes in Skype, I'd point my finger there.
2012-06-28T21:53:00.000Z	SocialEvil	Psi-Jack	 so its my skype fault not my camera?
2012-06-28T22:11:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	SocialEvil	That'd be my first guess, yes.
