2010-09-21T15:52:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	I recommend you read up on the basics here: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide
2010-09-21T15:53:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	An important thing to know is that [ is NOT shell syntax, it's a regular command.
2010-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	TrI30T		well maedox I need to figure out if something is done, like compressing the folder before I move it, checking the prerequisits will result in a true statement even while it's still compressing and the move command will execute anyways
2010-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	TrI30T		or at least I assume the move command will execute, I don't know exactly how bash runs each line
2010-09-21T16:00:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	Also, there's no point in checking if a process is running if you are just gonna kill it anyway.  man pkill
2010-09-21T16:01:00.000Z	TrI30T		well, I rewrote that bit so it's java ServerLauncher, which is the actual name
2010-09-21T16:02:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	This has in-depth discussion of why you shouldn't use ps in scripts; among other things.  http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessManagement
2010-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	TrI30T		It's a bit complicated though, and this is something else I wanted to ask, when I run java ServerLauncher I can issue server commands from that session, I usually use a screen so that I can detach and logout without leaving the putty terminal up all the time, If there's a way, I'd like to set it up so that the script issues a "stop" command to the java program to make sure the server shuts down the way it's supposed to as opposed to just ki
2010-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	TrI30T		lling it
2010-09-21T16:05:00.000Z	TrI30T		and then I could use a while loop to make sure the script doesn't continue until the process is dead
2010-09-21T16:06:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	See that process management page.
2010-09-21T16:14:00.000Z	TrI30T		ok geirha, I've skimmed through that page, lots of good stuff and it actually answers a good deal of the questions I had, but I'm still wondering about that java process, is there a way that I can bring it back from the background, echo "stop" and then continue with the script?
2010-09-21T16:16:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	If you start it from the script itself, you can have some control over it.
2010-09-21T16:17:00.000Z	TrI30T		I don't follow
2010-09-21T16:19:00.000Z	TrI30T		I can't explain it very well but when I run java ServerLauncher, I get a readout of what people are doing on the server and I can issue commands like "list" and "stop" and whatnot, by using the stop there it saves all the data on the server before shutting down, which is much preferable to just killing the process
2010-09-21T16:20:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	exec 3> >(java program); ...do some stuf...; echo "stop" >&3
2010-09-21T16:21:00.000Z	TrI30T	geirha	what exactly does 3> > and >&3 do?
2010-09-21T16:22:00.000Z	geirha	TrI30T	I'm leaving soon. I recommend you head over to #bash and ask there.
