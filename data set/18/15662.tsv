2005-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	you won't need to compile seti as it's not available as source afaik - it's not free software - it's distributed in a binary only variant I beleive
2005-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	having linux binaries is not the same as compiling....who knows what == binaries...
2005-04-11T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	they certainly have linux binaries available for different architectures but if you're wondering why it's not in ubuntu's main repositories or debians it's because of the license.
2005-04-11T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	why don't you look on their site, it takes 3 seconds :P running seti is as challenging as downloading the .tar, untarring it and then running the file
2005-04-11T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	what's your CPU arch?
2005-04-11T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	ftp://alien.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/setiathome-3.08.i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar <-- wget that
2005-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	nope - just type "wget ftp://alien.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/setiathome-3.08.i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar"
2005-04-11T06:24:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	if your CPU is that speed then gnome 2.10 must really crawl! you should probably take a look at a lightweight alternative designed for low speed systems - such as blackbox, fluxbox, icewm and more
2005-04-11T06:25:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	whichever dir you ran the command from
2005-04-11T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	seriously, I find gnome a bit slow with a p4 3.2ghz and 1.5gb of ram :) I've installed it on some slower PCs and I will prob switch them away
2005-04-11T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	well, if you tar -xvf the file it'll make the setiathome dir
2005-04-11T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	yup
2005-04-11T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	where ever you want - though the home dir is the most usual choice
2005-04-11T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	erm?
2005-04-11T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	where is the dir now?
2005-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	did you not untar the file? and want to move the dir rather than the file?
2005-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	to be clear when we say home dir we mean *your* home dir, e.g. /home/<your user name>
2005-04-11T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	black_nightmare	really not sure what you mean? of course put it inside your home dir, isn't that what you've been trying to do?
