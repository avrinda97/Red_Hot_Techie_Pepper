2010-10-01T07:36:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		i'm using an ati mobile 5870, with fglrx; my mouse doesn't respond with the trackpad or when i set it to use keyboard keys, wut do
2010-10-01T07:37:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	do you have a spare external mouse to plugin for temporary use?
2010-10-01T07:37:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	dlorag	not an option
2010-10-01T07:38:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	I would suggest doing ctrl + alt + f1 then logging in and doing sudo su then apt-get update followed by apt-get upgrade to make sure your system is up to date then type reboot
2010-10-01T07:38:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		it is
2010-10-01T07:38:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		freshly installed, aswell
2010-10-01T07:39:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	fresh install is out of date by time its first burned always updates rolling out you sure?
2010-10-01T07:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	dlorag	it is up to date
2010-10-01T07:39:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	and you rebooted to make sure all the new modules or kernel are loaded properly?
2010-10-01T07:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	dlorag	yes
2010-10-01T07:40:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	is there a touchpad on/off button?
2010-10-01T07:41:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	dlorag	no
2010-10-01T07:42:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	dlorag	when i used the open source drivers, it worked well, but the resolution was way off; when i used recent fglrx drivers, the resolution was fine but the mouse was too responsive and i couldn't tap to click; with ubuntu's current fglrx drivers, my mouse doesn't work (with keyboard mouse or trackpad)
2010-10-01T07:42:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	in /var/log there is a xorg output there and you can try dmesg to see if you find any errors when loading up your touchpad
2010-10-01T07:43:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	dlorag	i'll try that, brb
2010-10-01T07:43:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	I'm not sure if lshw lists such information about peripherals but perhaps there is a suitable ls based option
2010-10-01T07:44:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	it would be good to know what the system is recognizing the device as
2010-10-01T07:44:00.000Z	dlorag	D3RGPS31	pastebin all the info you get there should help to narrow things down
