2006-08-13T16:03:00.000Z	JohnnyG		I have been trying for four hours to get madwifi installed so that my wifi works in Ubuntu. I'm a newbie and the documents seem to go in circles. Can one install madwifi via synapse?
2006-08-13T16:03:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	madwifi is in linux-restricted-modules
2006-08-13T16:09:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	no, it just means ubotu isn't as omniscient as we expected it to be. activate multiverse repos, search for linux-restricted-modules and install the package that fits your kernel.
2006-08-13T07:59:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	madwifi drivers didn't work?
2006-08-13T08:01:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	well, i am using a pcmcia "Atheros Communications, Inc. AR5212 802.11abg NIC (rev 01)" right now
2006-08-13T08:03:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	did you look at dmesg?
2006-08-13T08:04:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	run 'dmesg', see if anything suspicious comes up, or just pastebin it
2006-08-13T08:06:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	'dmesg > dmesg.log'
2006-08-13T08:07:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	'cd ~', and dmesg, not dmesf
2006-08-13T08:13:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	hm, strange. is it an internal pci card?
2006-08-13T08:16:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	http://madwifi.org/ticket/263
2006-08-13T08:17:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	nvm, i'm too slow =)
2006-08-13T08:20:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	MrRio: ndiswrapper is probably the best way currently, or you would have to recompile madwifi at least
2006-08-13T08:22:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	usually most drivers for the same chipset work, but it's safest and easiest to get the correct drivers
2006-08-13T09:15:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	a simple reboot might be worth a try, madwifi drivers are likely still loaded and could be interfering, add 'blacklist ath_pci' to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2006-08-13T09:18:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	and make sure the device id in 'lspci -n' matches the driver's id in /etc/ndiswrapper/blah/<id>.conf or so
2006-08-13T09:22:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	check with lsmod if ndiswrapper is loaded, if it is, have a look at dmesg, if it doesn't say anything exciting your windows driver probably doesn't have the correct device id
2006-08-13T09:29:00.000Z	void^	JohnnyG	congratulations :P
