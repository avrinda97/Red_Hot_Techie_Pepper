2009-05-26T15:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	dapper ? you can not install a more recent version of ubuntu
2009-05-26T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	:| then your only option is to use envyng or installing the *.run from nvidia site
2009-05-26T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	or contact aLUG or LoCo team near you and ask for cd's. also you can ask for them in shipit.ubuntu.com
2009-05-26T15:28:00.000Z	jag_	erUSUL	Why do evrybody warn aganst envy ?? and IF i get from Nvidia website , what is best way to EXIT xserver? Cos I remember getting an "EXIT X BEFORE INSTALL" previously?
2009-05-26T15:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	envy used to be a very bad program on dapper ages
2009-05-26T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-05-26T15:33:00.000Z	jag_	erUSUL	Thanx , I requested a cd be shipped . . .

2009-05-26T15:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	envy uses the nvidia driver but does everything automatically or trys to
2009-05-26T15:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	i recommend the nvidia driver becouse at least you see what is going on
2009-05-26T15:37:00.000Z	jag_	erUSUL	that sounds the better option . . Thnx . . there is no x64 isues i need to know about are there??
2009-05-26T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	jag_	dunno i did not use 64 bits back when in dapper (switched in gutsy)
