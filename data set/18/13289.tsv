2006-10-22T12:37:00.000Z	fangorious	cyber	xchat-gnome takes a lot of usefull stuff out of the UI
2006-10-22T12:37:00.000Z	fangorious	cyber	i always just go back to plain xchat
2006-10-22T12:43:00.000Z	fangorious	cyber	just curious, but are you specifically looking for a command-line irc client, or just something better than xchat-gnome?
2006-10-22T12:45:00.000Z	cyber	fangorious	there wasnt a defult irc client & i wanted a good one
2006-10-22T12:46:00.000Z	fangorious	cyber	i lend my vote to plain xhcat (apt-get install xchat)
