2008-08-08T11:03:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	you cannot use it. the initrd alone will kill you. ubuntu won't really run on 32MB either
2008-08-08T11:04:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	look into damnsmallinux or such
2008-08-08T11:05:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	what network chip?
2008-08-08T11:05:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	those aren't network chips but manufacturer. exact chip please
2008-08-08T11:07:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	lspci? or is it pcmcia?
2008-08-08T11:09:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	use lspcmcia
2008-08-08T11:17:00.000Z	wols_	swp0743	OT
