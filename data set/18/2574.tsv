2010-10-03T23:47:00.000Z	abstrakt		mkaay, I have no idea what you just said, lol
2010-10-03T23:48:00.000Z	abstrakt		gah, mkenya
2010-10-03T23:48:00.000Z	abstrakt		^
2010-10-03T23:50:00.000Z	abstrakt		ok maybe someone else... know how to get rhythmbox to play mp3s?
2010-10-03T23:50:00.000Z	Ken8521	abstrakt	did you install the codecs?
2010-10-03T23:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	abstrakt	do you have the codecs installed to play mp3's?.. do they work in other applications
2010-10-03T23:53:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	yup I installed w64codecs and rhtyhmbox-plugins and ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-10-03T23:53:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	I'm listening to internet radio right now through "Movie Player" whatever that aliases to on the backend, gnome-movie-player I dunno
2010-10-03T23:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	abstrakt	can you listent o mp3's w/ any other app?.. or is it only rhythmbox that won't play them
2010-10-03T23:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	totem works
2010-10-03T23:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	so yes I can listen to them in other apps, like totem
2010-10-03T23:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	this is really kind of strange to me, it seems like it should be working from what I know and based on what I've read
2010-10-03T23:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	abstrakt	not really sure on that one, i have 32bit, and it works fine in rhythmbox.
2010-10-03T23:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	I followed the instructions on restricted formats
2010-10-03T23:55:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	yeh, k I have 64 bit I guess, can't remember why I choose that one, cuz I thought I had chosen 32, maybe I'll chalk it up to having 64bit
2010-10-03T23:55:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	wouldn't surprise me
2010-10-03T23:56:00.000Z	Ken8521	abstrakt	maybe... 64bit support is sometimes a little shaky compared to 32bit.. thats why i stick w/ it (plus, i don't really need 64bit funcationality)
2010-10-03T23:56:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ken8521	yeah for what I'm doing I saw a significant performance boost actually, now that I remember, on 64 bit vs 32 bit
