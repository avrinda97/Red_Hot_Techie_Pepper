2009-12-29T07:24:00.000Z	tos_		does ubuntu have a way to load balance multiple internet connections, 1 wired, 1 usb, 1 wireless?
2009-12-29T07:24:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	advanced routing
2009-12-29T07:25:00.000Z	tos_		sync3times; have you used it?
2009-12-29T07:25:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	only some test cases to bandwidth limit a connection.   Its not what you would call...friendly.   Not at first glance
2009-12-29T07:26:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	you have 3 connections to the internet?
2009-12-29T07:26:00.000Z	tos_		im wanting to use my cellphone inet, dsl, and a nearby wifi on a server for incoming and only use the dsl for outgoing
2009-12-29T07:26:00.000Z	tos_		yes.
2009-12-29T07:27:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	hmm
2009-12-29T07:28:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	 sounds unlikely
2009-12-29T07:28:00.000Z	tos_		Tor?
2009-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	tos_		yeah i want to make the ubuntu a router itself
2009-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	tos_		to handle that
2009-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	tos_		jill, yea i have 300 its working fine...
2009-12-29T07:30:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	so if a packet comes in on cellphone, you want the reply to go out on DSL?
2009-12-29T07:35:00.000Z	tos_		the routing is so complicated... so if i get a ip of 75.1.75.1 from isp for DSL modem... my router is assigned 10.0.0.1, using DMZ it gives my Ubuntu-server the public ip of 75.1.75.1, and my isp assignes me a block of ips  76.199.50.102-109 or whatever, can i make the ubuntu virtually manage all of those ip's? or just one?
2009-12-29T07:37:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	 you could use aliases an have ubuntu respond to all of those addresses.
2009-12-29T07:38:00.000Z	tos_	sync3times	how would you set up an alias for them?
2009-12-29T07:39:00.000Z	sync3times	tos_	  ifconfig eth0:1 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX     ifconfig eth0:2 XXX.XXX.XXX.YYY
