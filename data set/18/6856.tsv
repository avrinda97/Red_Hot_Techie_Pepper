2008-04-09T07:28:00.000Z	ltcabral		please someone help me to open port 5432 for a tcp connection to myself :(
2008-04-09T07:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	just start a program that listens on that port if you're connecting from localhost
2008-04-09T07:32:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	start a program that listens on port 5432
2008-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	when i open my application and use nmap in another terminal it shows the port 5432 in the list of opened ports, but the server application stops running and gives me an error message
2008-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	what was the error?
2008-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	i tested in another place and it worked well, so the problem is with my computer
2008-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	Invalid argument
2008-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	was this from the server or the client?
2008-04-09T07:37:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	server...
2008-04-09T07:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	it might be a server bug
2008-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	but worked perfectly in other place
2008-04-13T07:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	##C
2008-04-13T07:42:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	#c is a redirect to ##c
2008-04-13T11:21:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	kill the process that's using the socket that already bound it
2008-04-13T11:24:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	tried... even restarting computer and connection didnt work
2008-04-13T11:24:00.000Z	Starnestommy	ltcabral	try changing the port
2008-04-13T11:34:00.000Z	ltcabral	Starnestommy	changing the port allows the client to connect to the server, but the server wont receive any message from the client. That was not happening before either
