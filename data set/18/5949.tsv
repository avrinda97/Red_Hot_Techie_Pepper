2009-03-18T16:13:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	hard to imaging why looking at boot.ini would help fstab
2009-03-18T16:14:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	I'd imagine it's up to them to determine if it's important in the scheme of things.
2009-03-18T16:14:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	ahh.. looks like there talking wubi installs..
2009-03-18T16:15:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	that makes sense.
2009-03-18T16:39:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	multiple keyboards on the same PC?
2009-03-18T17:50:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	is this on nvidia?
2009-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	Intel
2009-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	in that case you'll want to search out commands for xrandr or randr ..
2009-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	thanks.
2009-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	np
2009-03-18T17:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	when I attempt to install xrandr, it says it's been replaced by x11-xserver-utils.  Does that sound right to you?
2009-03-18T17:58:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	no.. randr or xrandr is the system that pretty much controls video now in the backend.. that's why xorg.conf looks so empty.  there are commands to set one monitor right or left of "whatever"
2009-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	so it's already installed by default.
2009-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	yes.. but you have to use the terminal to get things done with it.
2009-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	that's fine by me...
2009-04-23T21:34:00.000Z	Huufarted	scunizi	thanks for that clarification on what server has.  :)
2009-04-23T21:34:00.000Z	scunizi	Huufarted	np.. :)
