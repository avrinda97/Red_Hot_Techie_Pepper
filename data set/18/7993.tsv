2007-10-30T16:27:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	right now I'm using exaile.
2007-10-30T16:22:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	you lose all your settings.
2007-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	I can't find .amarok folder.
2007-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	press ctrl-h to view hidden files.
2007-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	is there a way to erase all amarok settings?
2007-10-30T16:25:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	you could always uninstall, then install again.
2007-10-30T16:26:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	I tried that several times. But when i reinstall, amarok settings havent changed, still loads its old song database on 1st run
2007-10-30T16:26:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	try using "sudo aptitude purge amarok". Should get rid of settings for you.
2007-10-30T16:27:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	you definitely did "purge"?
2007-10-30T16:30:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	It worked! Thanks! Is there a difference between 'sudo apt-get purge amarok' and 'sudo aptitude purge amarok'?
2007-10-30T16:31:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	yes - i don't think apt-get can purge. Aptitude is like it's big brother....
2007-10-30T16:31:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	Doh! Ok, now I know:) hehe
2007-10-30T16:31:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	you can run "aptitude" on its own to get a terminal-based version of synaptic...
2007-10-30T16:34:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	I think I figured it, amarok's mysql lite db didnt get completely purged. anyway to do this?
2007-10-30T16:35:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	try doing "sudo updatedb" (takes a little while. Let it run). Then do "locate amarok".
2007-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	i don't know... the locate command would just try and find any file with "amarok" in the title...
2007-10-30T16:37:00.000Z	shearn89	greencookie	i think mysql is an extra package - not part of the kernel.
2007-10-30T16:38:00.000Z	greencookie	shearn89	I tried using MySQL but it asked me for a usn/password and other information
