2010-09-16T09:43:00.000Z	aionys		Does anyone in here know if there is a standalone app with the same or at least similar functionality to the clip in the WindowMaker GUI?
2010-09-16T09:44:00.000Z	abhijit	aionys	what you want to do?
2010-09-16T09:45:00.000Z	aionys		I want to use the WindowMaker GUI, instead of GNOME, KDE, etc., but with compositing support.
2010-09-16T09:46:00.000Z	aionys		The WindowMaker GUI is based on NextSTEP, and consists of a dock (which is easy to get, like GNOME-Do's Docky), and a clip (which I can't find).
2010-09-16T09:48:00.000Z	aionys		The clip is basically the same thing as a dock, in that you can attach launchers and dockapps to it, but you can also hide the things attached, and the clip is per workspace, unlike the dock, which shows the same thing on all workspaces.
2010-09-16T09:52:00.000Z	aionys		So, no one knows?
2010-09-16T09:53:00.000Z	abhijit	aionys	if you want dock then try cairo dock
2010-09-16T09:53:00.000Z	aionys		No. CLIP\
2010-09-16T09:53:00.000Z	abhijit		dunno.

2010-09-16T09:55:00.000Z	aionys	abhijit	The clip is basically the same thing as a dock, in that you can attach launchers and dockapps to it, but you can also hide the things attached, and the clip is per workspace, unlike the dock, which shows the same thing on all workspaces.
2010-09-16T09:56:00.000Z	abhijit	aionys	have you tried cairo dock? i remember something cairo does the same give it a try
2010-09-16T09:56:00.000Z	aionys		I'll look, but I doubt it's anything like a clip.
2010-09-16T09:57:00.000Z	abhijit	aionys	give a try if you dont like you can uninsatll it.
