2007-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		yo, i just added a samba share, do i have to manually set up a username and password to access it from another computer?
2007-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	i do believe so yes
2007-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	Toma-		!samba
2007-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		zcat[1] : yeah, its a wireless network which i think my neighbours have accidentally used
2007-05-01T11:26:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		do i just want smbpassword -a [my local username] ?
2007-05-01T11:26:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	yep
2007-05-01T11:27:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Toma-	it doesnt bother me, but why doesnt ubuntu if not give you a gui way of doing it, at least tell you something still has to be done?
2007-05-01T11:27:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	file a bug!
2007-05-01T11:27:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		nah, its like that song, "i filed a bug and the bug won"
2007-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	well the problem will continue to exist :(
2007-05-01T11:43:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Toma-	the bug was filed in 2005! : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/+bug/24184
2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	damn! :S
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Toma-	could be fixed for gutsy though???: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SimpleSambaIntegrationSpec
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	would be nice. see my blueprint here on the bigger problem :) https://blueprints.launchpad.net/launchpad/+spec/launchpad-voting-system
2007-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Toma-	the even bigger problem here is that people don't file bugs. i'm sure they would if they already had a launchpad account, but they just don't sign up. i imagine even LESS people would sign up for the voting
2007-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	having a voting system would give people an incentive to file bugs and get things they want passed
2007-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	Toma-	jacquesmerde	for instance, id vote for your samba bug. not long ago i had to LAN with a bunch of windows users and when i couldnt get a samba share working easy, they all bagged me out
2007-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Toma-	aahhh, hurt pride. the great motivation for technological improvement
