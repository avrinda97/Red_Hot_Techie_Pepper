2012-05-03T10:50:00.000Z	ghil		her...rather weirdly, unity 3D isn't showing anymore. I was trying Gnome-shell, which was really really slow (there's something wrong that's for sure) and when I tried to get back to Unity, the dash and the top bar wouldn't show.
2012-05-03T10:50:00.000Z	ghil		but unity 2d works really well.
2012-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	ghil		I have an Asus G60jx, so it's rather up to date. Unity 3D was working perfectly before.
2012-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	ghil		12.04
2012-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	ghil		oh no, fresh install of 12.04
2012-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	ghil		nvidia with up to date xorg/drivers.
2012-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	ghil		I'm on 302.07
2012-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	ghil		I'm one more than the current.
2012-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	ghil		and it was working fine all day, until I tried Gnome-shell.
2012-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	ghil		yeah I'll try that.
2012-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	ubuntoo	ghil	 is 12.04 super stable or just normal? I want to know as i am also planning to switch to 12.04
2012-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	ghil		that's what I'm thinking.
2012-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	ghil	ubuntoo	so far, it's rock solid.
2012-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	ghil		the oldest distro still active you mean?
2012-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	ghil		or a derivative of linux?
2012-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	ubuntoo	ghil	 Have you tried 11.10? If yes, which is more stable?
2012-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	ghil		12.04 so far ubuntoo.
2012-05-03T10:58:00.000Z	ubuntoo	ghil	 thanx
