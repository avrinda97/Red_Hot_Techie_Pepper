2011-04-04T01:53:00.000Z	Space_Cadet		Hello room :) I am running an update on a new Ubtunu 10.10 install and it keeps hanging at configuring linux-image-2.6.35-22-generic. In the update box it says Generating grub.cfg..............it has been that way for 30 minutes. Suggestions please?
2011-04-04T01:54:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	It can take a whole for that portion to finish,
2011-04-04T01:54:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	whole=while
2011-04-04T01:55:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	Is this an 64bit install or 32bit?
2011-04-04T01:57:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	is the computer still responsive to key presses (like cpas lock turning on and off)
2011-04-04T01:59:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	something must have gone wrong during the update... I'm not sure what to do at that point
2011-04-04T01:59:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	killing the update could have unfortunate consequences
2011-04-04T01:59:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	This isn't a WUBI install is it?
2011-04-04T02:00:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	you can try to kill it and restart it... worst case when it boots you will have to boot into the previous kernel
2011-04-04T02:02:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	are you running the update in terminal or graphical?
2011-04-04T02:03:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	that one I'm not sure... you could check out your process manager to see if you can spot it ther
2011-04-04T02:05:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	thanks,  i usually run all my updates in the Command line
2011-04-04T02:11:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	It is possible, the update manager runs the dpkg configuartion which checks to see fi the settings file has been modified from it's original installed version
2011-04-04T02:12:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	I doubt nvidia drivers would cause a problem
2011-04-04T02:27:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	pragmaticenigma	How do I boot to CLI?
2011-04-04T02:28:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	pragmaticenigma	boot to it.......going to update my system before editing grub with nomodeset
2011-04-04T02:29:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	there really isn't a good way to do that... unlike other distros, you may not have networking when booting to CLI
2011-04-04T02:30:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Space_Cadet	you can try booting to recovery mode
