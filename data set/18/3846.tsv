2009-09-25T16:59:00.000Z	Maleko		hi..can anyone give me a command to recursively delete all NON HIDDEN files and folder
2009-09-25T17:00:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	find . ! -name '.*'     # If that looks right, add -delete at the end
2009-09-25T17:01:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	Oh and you might want -type f to only target files
2009-09-25T17:02:00.000Z	Maleko	geirha	like this? find . -type f -name ! '.*'
2009-09-25T17:03:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	find . -type f ! -name '.*'   make sure you try on a test tree/copy first
2009-09-25T17:08:00.000Z	Maleko	geirha	yea that works so next i just do this? find . -type f ! -name '.*' -delete ? or -exec rm -f {} \;
2009-09-25T17:09:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	Yes. the -exec is the portable way, while -delete is specific to GNU find (which ubuntu has)
2009-09-25T17:11:00.000Z	Maleko	geirha	ah okay. thanks so much :)
2009-09-25T17:11:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	yw
2009-09-25T17:16:00.000Z	Maleko	geirha	sorry, any idea why it refuses to delete folders? i have specified -rf with rm
2009-09-25T17:17:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	The parent directories have probably been deleted first.
2009-09-25T17:18:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	Oh, and your find only targets files
2009-09-25T17:21:00.000Z	Maleko	geirha	so i need to add -type df ?
2009-09-25T17:21:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	If I understood what you wanted to do correctly, you risk removing hidden files if you do rm -rf
2009-09-25T17:23:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	Maybe you rather want find . -depth -type d ! -name ".*" -exec echo rmdir {} \;
2009-09-25T17:23:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	rmdir will only remove a directory if it is empty
2009-09-25T17:24:00.000Z	Maleko	geirha	thats a safer solution i guess. thanks again
2009-12-31T18:05:00.000Z	geirha	Maleko	Or in other words, you restore from backup.
