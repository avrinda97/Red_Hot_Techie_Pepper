2009-05-22T15:06:00.000Z	mellys		my video card is nvidia mx400 64mb
2009-05-22T15:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	well, as you know, thats an ancient card..d o you have an option in system/admin/hardware drivers for that card?
2009-05-22T15:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	theres no nvidia driver there?
2009-05-22T15:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	then I would activate it.
2009-05-22T15:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	if thats the driver it recommends, then it should work fine... then you can do the 3d crap if thats what you're wanting.
2009-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	you have a slow connection?
2009-05-22T15:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	its in the repositories.. its like compiz-config-settings-mgr or something like that
2009-05-22T15:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	well, its not gonna run compiz very well.. how much ram does it have?
2009-05-22T15:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	you'd be silly to try and run compiz with any dazzling effects on that PC.
2009-05-22T15:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mellys	now how would i know that just from that statement?
