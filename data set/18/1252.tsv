2012-03-13T06:25:00.000Z	roasted		Question - is there a way I can set my Ubuntu desktop to automatically turn on at a certain time?
2012-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	look into WOL or wakeonlan
2012-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	but doesn't that require a router that supports WOL?
2012-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	then you can setup and automatic script on another computer on the same network to send the packet to wake the computer at the appropriate time
2012-03-13T06:28:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	only a BIOS that supports WOL all routers do.
2012-03-13T06:28:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	ALL routers support WOL???
2012-03-13T06:28:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	I thought only specific routers supported WOL
2012-03-13T06:28:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	WOL is just a normal network packet...
2012-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	oh..
2012-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	is the computer you are trying to wake realtively modern?
2012-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	sort of. pentium dual core, etc.
2012-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	it's a file server for my parents. I began to question if it needs to run 247. I started to think, what if I just set it to run the entire day on sunday or something and have it auto shut down for the rest of the week. Then saturday night, fire back up so it's online for the automatic backup to kick over to it.
2012-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	you'll haveto look through the bios for the feature
2012-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	I'm just trying to be smart with what they need vs electricity savings.
2012-03-13T06:32:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	their data doesn't change enough to warrant 247365 uptime, so meh.
2012-03-13T06:32:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	at the same token I wonder if a pentium dual core is eating enough energy for it to even be a concern when idle.
2012-03-13T06:34:00.000Z	roasted	hydrox24	I wonder, if a computer is in suspend mode if it would be able to wake up vs being completely turned off.
2012-03-13T06:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	roasted	look at if the BIOS has an auto ON feature, even old ones have that feature.
