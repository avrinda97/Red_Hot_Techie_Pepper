2011-12-18T00:04:00.000Z	nb-ben		that is done by a script of some sort normally
2011-12-18T00:04:00.000Z	nb-ben		usually, ./configure
2011-12-18T00:06:00.000Z	nb-ben		i can't recall, hold on -- ill tell you exactly which file to edit
2011-12-18T00:07:00.000Z	nb-ben		hmm I see
2011-12-18T00:08:00.000Z	nb-ben		libraries to /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib

2011-12-18T00:08:00.000Z	nb-ben		no, why will it be tarred
2011-12-18T00:09:00.000Z	nb-ben		how do you install a source as a tree?
2011-12-18T00:09:00.000Z	nb-ben		it's like drinking coffee as butter
2011-12-18T00:11:00.000Z	nb-ben		you only get the compiled binaries
2011-12-18T00:11:00.000Z	schnuffle	nb-ben	wrong you can grab the sources with apt-get source
2011-12-18T00:12:00.000Z	schnuffle	nb-ben	wrong again it downloads it to the actual dir
2011-12-18T00:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	nb-ben	actual dir = actual directory
2011-12-18T00:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	nb-ben	the directory your're in for the moment
2011-12-18T00:16:00.000Z	schnuffle	nb-ben	how would you call it?
2011-12-18T00:16:00.000Z	nb-ben	schnuffle	current working directory
2011-12-18T00:16:00.000Z	nb-ben	schnuffle	current directory, the directory you're at, your workdir
2011-12-18T00:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	nb-ben	damned of course :) I knew there was a word but couldn't remember "current"
