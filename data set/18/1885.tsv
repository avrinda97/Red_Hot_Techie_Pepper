2011-01-11T06:19:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	i'd hardly agree w/ that... most people who use ubuntu couldn't be a hacker if they were spotted the "hacke"
2011-01-15T21:43:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	no, it still would be, don't fool yourself..lol
2011-01-20T03:40:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	if kde was like a linux virus, it would be virtually nonexentient and very easy to get rid of!
2011-01-20T03:41:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	i guess thats a matter of opinion.. :)
2011-01-28T03:43:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	what is the wireless device on the pc?
2011-01-28T03:45:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	it's a tp-link tl-wn727N usb adapter
2011-01-28T03:46:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	and you said linux-compat-wireless, is already installed?
2011-01-28T03:47:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	yes, but it doesn't seem to have it for the newest kernel, 2.6.32-28
2011-01-28T03:49:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	2.6.32-28? .. hmm, i've got 2.6.37, 2.6.35-22, etc.
2011-01-28T03:50:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	I need this package: linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.34-2.6.32-28-generic  and I can't seem to find it.
2011-01-28T03:51:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	probably because youre not connected to the internet
2011-01-28T03:52:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-10.04/ubuntu-proposed-main-i386/linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic_2.6.32.28.31_i386.deb.html
2011-01-28T03:52:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	I'm guessning I did as it shows linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.34-2.6.32-26-generic and linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.34-2.6.32-27-generic, just not linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.34-2.6.32-28-generic.
2011-01-28T03:53:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	that name/version, does not look right...
2011-01-28T03:54:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	http://pkgs.org/package/linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.34-2.6.32-27-generic
2011-01-28T04:15:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	I still can't find it, any suggestions?  I've tried a web search, searching synaptic, etc. and I still can't find linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.34-2.6.32-28-generic
2011-01-28T04:15:00.000Z	KM0201	NixGeek	not really sure to be honest, i figured that was the package you needed.
2011-01-28T04:16:00.000Z	NixGeek	KM0201	nope, i need the one for the newer kernel.  this is really wierd, mabey ndiswrapper will work..
