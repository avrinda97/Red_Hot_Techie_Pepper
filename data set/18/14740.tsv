2005-06-23T15:59:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	actually if you check the forums, I just backported zSNES 1.4.2 for Hoary
2005-06-24T16:00:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	here you go: http://sethkinast.com/ubuntu/hoary/backports/zsnes_1.420-0ubuntu1~5.04ubp1_i386.deb
2005-06-24T16:00:00.000Z	Chetic	seth_k	that's awesome.. thanks!
2005-06-24T16:00:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	wait, are you wanting for 64-bit?
2005-06-24T16:00:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	I just now scrolled up and read
2005-06-24T16:01:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	zSNES is in x86 assembly, so doesn't work with 64-bit :(
2005-06-24T16:01:00.000Z	Chetic	seth_k	ever? it won't ever work?
2005-06-24T16:01:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	no, not unless someone ports it to x64, which won't happen. try snes9x :/
2005-06-24T16:09:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	that command didn't work? (with no -x)
2005-06-24T16:09:00.000Z	Chetic	seth_k	nope
2005-06-24T16:10:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure the lines with deb-src are uncommented, especially the one with multiverse
2005-06-24T16:10:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	snes9x is in multiverse
2005-06-24T16:10:00.000Z	Chetic	seth_k	they're all uncommented
2005-06-24T16:10:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	so you have:
2005-06-24T16:12:00.000Z	Chetic	seth_k	yeah I have the multiverse with sources
2005-06-24T16:13:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	the only thing I can think then is that apt has decided that you can't build snes9x on an x64 system, maybe for the same reason as zSNES
2005-06-24T16:13:00.000Z	Chetic	seth_k	ok.. so basically SNES emulation isn't possible on a 64-bit machine running Ubuntu now.. that's great
2005-06-24T16:15:00.000Z	seth_k	Chetic	I think you're gonna have to somehow get a 32-bit environment set up inside your 64-bit. or do what zyth suggested and try it through wine?
