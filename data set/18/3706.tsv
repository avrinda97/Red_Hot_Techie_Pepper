2009-08-25T13:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	please take this to the appropriate channel
2009-08-25T13:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	we cannot answer you here, but the people in #debian can
2009-08-25T13:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	that issue is specific to debian
2009-08-25T13:10:00.000Z	dehqan	lstarnes	is not idoneous to debian
2009-09-28T02:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	you need -r
2009-09-28T02:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	both
2009-09-28T02:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	-r and -v are separate options
2009-09-28T02:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	if you need verbose output, keep -v
2009-09-28T02:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	-r is used for recursive copying
2009-09-28T02:36:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	I think rsync may do what you're asking for
2009-09-28T02:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	are there already files in /media/disk-2?
2009-09-28T02:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	cp and rsync are separate
2009-09-28T02:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	they are NOT the same thing
2009-09-28T02:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	dehqan	you should not use root as your user account
