2006-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	Surfer		I tried 2 drivers 8139cp and 8139too ...
2006-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	bbrazil	Surfer	that's a vbery well supported chipset. What was the problem?
2006-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	bbrazil	Surfer	then you just need to configure it
2006-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	bbrazil	Surfer	add teh line 'iface eth0 inet dhcp' to /etc/network/interfaces
2006-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	bbrazil	Surfer	then ifup eth0
