2008-12-29T05:22:00.000Z	freq18hz		Hi, I could use some help with synamptic package manager
2008-12-29T05:22:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	What's your question?
2008-12-29T05:23:00.000Z	freq18hz	Flannel	im noticing that tons of things I am looking for are not coming up, irssi, tons of others, yet I can find them with apt-get
2008-12-29T05:24:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	They use the same cache.  Try hitting 'reload' (although, if theyre showing up in apt, youve likely already reloaded)
2008-12-29T05:25:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	How are you searching?
2008-12-29T05:25:00.000Z	freq18hz	Flannel	I have hit reload, and it still does not come up.  I have all the respositories checked in Software Sources
2008-12-29T05:25:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	You're just starting to type irssi with all of them listed?
2008-12-29T05:26:00.000Z	freq18hz	Flannel	I dont understand your question
2008-12-29T05:27:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	On the left thing, view "all" packages, then click back into the package listing, and type 'irs'
2008-12-29T05:27:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	It should skip to the packages beginning with those letters
2008-12-29T05:28:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	And what do you see?  What is surrounding where irssi should be?
2008-12-29T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	Alright, try just using the "search" dialog
2008-12-29T05:33:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	Um, tdl
2008-12-29T05:36:00.000Z	freq18hz	Flannel	any ideas on that one?
2008-12-29T05:38:00.000Z	freq18hz	Flannel	any clue why Im having problems with windows being longer than my vertical resolution
2008-12-29T05:38:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	Nope
2008-12-29T05:39:00.000Z	freq18hz	Flannel	did you catch what I said above?
2008-12-29T05:39:00.000Z	Flannel	freq18hz	I did.
