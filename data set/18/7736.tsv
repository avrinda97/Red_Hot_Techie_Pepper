2008-10-16T07:15:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere		guys what is  /etc/rc.local
2008-10-16T07:15:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere		?
2008-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere		I need to make my ubuntu box a Socks 5 Proxy using the CLI
2008-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	the comments at the top of /etc/rc.local tell you what it is.  It's a way to run things on startup as root
2008-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	depending on what you want exactly, you could just use ssh (-D)
2008-10-16T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	yes...
2008-10-16T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	see the -D option in 'man ssh'.  Pass -D when you connect.
2008-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere	jrib	how do i make that happen automatically on boot up?
2008-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	not with ssh
2008-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere	jrib	how could i do socks 5 to start on bootup?
2008-10-16T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	you just have the option of creating a local port when you ssh somewhere that acts as a socks proxy
2008-10-16T07:19:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere	jrib	can you walk me through it?
2008-10-16T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	I don't know.  Did you try: apt-cache search socks proxy
2008-10-16T07:20:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	that should give you a place to start
2008-10-16T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	I told you how to do that already
2008-10-16T07:28:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere	jrib	I looked but there was so many packages to choose from
2008-10-16T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	MiddleOfNowhere	pick one, google it, read documentation.  Then go on to the next one.  Then make a decision.  There were about a dozen when I searched and not all were actual proxies
2008-10-16T07:29:00.000Z	MiddleOfNowhere	jrib	thanks
