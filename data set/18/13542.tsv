2005-11-06T07:49:00.000Z	Delvien		What is artsd under Processes?
2005-11-06T07:49:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	KDE sound system
2005-11-06T07:50:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	I'm not sure it should use that much...
2005-11-06T07:51:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Try disabling it and using alsa or OSS, but they are not shared resource systems
2005-11-06T07:53:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Then that's it. It should be using 32 bits and god knows what else
2005-11-06T07:55:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Probably it's locked because some application is using arts
2005-11-06T08:03:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	KDE eats 300MB in my system always
2005-11-06T08:05:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Check your configuration. KDE has lots of resources hacks
2005-11-06T08:06:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	kcontrol
2005-11-06T08:08:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	They are options in different stuff, from Look & Feel to directory listing
2005-11-06T08:08:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Just look around to find things which might work
2005-11-06T08:09:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Anyway, if resources are such a worry, move to Enlightenment, BlackBox or the likes. They're much more beatiful and less greedy
2005-11-06T08:10:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	? Konqueror is perfectly useable from enlightenment, if you activate KDE compatibility
2005-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Galeon works perfectly
2005-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	Another Window Manager
2005-11-06T08:12:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	It's like GNome or KDE, but much lighterm and different style (no task bar, but IconBox, clicking in the desktop to get the applications menu...)
2005-11-06T08:14:00.000Z	EloraHRanma	Delvien	That's because you haven't seen Enlightenment =)
2005-11-06T08:15:00.000Z	Delvien	EloraHRanma	aye prolly :P but im not up to a big move like that
