2010-08-08T07:54:00.000Z	sikilpaake		is there a way to be able to launch gparted from terminal without doing a sudo?
2010-08-08T07:55:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	gksu
2010-08-08T07:55:00.000Z	sikilpaake	psycho_oreos	gksu? hmm..
2010-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	it'll ask your password as you normally would in sudo but without terminal
2010-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	if you want to not make sudo ask for password, you need to edit sudoers file and append NOPASSWD
2010-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	sikilpaake	psycho_oreos	thanks, dude... this is what i'm trying to do ---> ssh -X -C -c blowfish verbatim@192.168.1.103 "gksu gnome"
2010-08-08T07:57:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	hmm ok no worries
2010-08-08T07:57:00.000Z	sikilpaake	psycho_oreos	i just need sudo to not ask password for gparted, though
2010-08-08T07:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	which is what I said, edit the sudoers file.. you need to execute via visudo
2010-08-08T07:58:00.000Z	sikilpaake	psycho_oreos	but what do i add there, though?
2010-08-08T07:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	NOPASSWD.. there are some examples of that scattered all over the net
2010-08-08T07:59:00.000Z	sikilpaake	psycho_oreos	werd, thanks a lot
2010-08-08T07:59:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sikilpaake	no worries
2010-08-08T08:14:00.000Z	sikilpaake	psycho_oreos	dude... much thanks to you
