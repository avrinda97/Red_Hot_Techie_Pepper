2005-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	XIII		hi, how could i clean up my dev from cached downloaded packages?
2005-08-31T10:06:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	remove the stuff in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2005-08-31T10:06:00.000Z	XIII	kirtis	all of them?
2005-08-31T10:07:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	actually probably better to do what the other guy said.
2005-08-31T10:08:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	put an sudo in front
2005-08-31T10:09:00.000Z	XIII	kirtis	i always log as root in the terminal
2005-08-31T10:09:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	yea i just noticed that.
2005-08-31T10:09:00.000Z	XIII	kirtis	i can't run realplayer
2005-08-31T10:10:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	what happens when you run it from a terminal?
2005-08-31T10:10:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	okay, but do you get an error..?
2005-08-31T10:11:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	well that just means that's not what the executable is called.. how'd you install it?
2005-08-31T10:12:00.000Z	XIII	kirtis	i installed it by rpm
2005-08-31T10:12:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	deFrysk was right, the command is realplay
2005-08-31T10:13:00.000Z	XIII	kirtis	even realplay doesn't work
2005-08-31T10:14:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	well i never use realplayer, maybe try typing real at a command prompt and hit tab twice to see what the possiblities are.
2005-08-31T10:15:00.000Z	XIII	kirtis	ok
2005-08-31T10:16:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	well maybe it didn't install anywhere in your path.. look for it in /opt maybe.
2005-08-31T10:16:00.000Z	kirtis	XIII	actually yea the longterm solution is what deFrysk says.
