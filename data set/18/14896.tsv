2005-09-13T16:09:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- ksudo user-admin in a termianl - first time: enter pw, dialog closes, return to $ prompt.  try again - no dialog, get "er may not run gksudo on localhost" on term.  (sttdout/err)
2005-09-13T16:10:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	does "sudo user-admin" work?
2005-09-13T16:11:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- oh crap.  i forgot that my user isn't in suduers yet.  damm preseed install.  I keep meaning to fix that...
2005-09-13T16:12:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- so yes, sudo works as expected.  look like gksudo is dropping some chars or something and not reporting problems quite right
2005-09-13T16:12:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	ah, ok :-) well, then your bug report should be that gksudo doesn't print a meaningful error message
2005-09-13T16:12:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	right; bug report appreciated :-) against gksudo
2005-09-13T16:13:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- glad we met in devle or this wouldhave been one misleading bugzilla.  (may want to get m to reconsider where bug reports are discussed)
2005-09-13T16:13:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	oh, discussing and reassigning in bz is fine, too
2005-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- it has in the past, but I just got shooed out ;)
2005-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	in general, I consider a small message "Can someone please help me with a bug in #u" on #u-d just fine
2005-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	CarlFK		er.. in bz?
2005-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- got it
2005-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	bz = bugzilla, sorry
2005-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- i try to keep my interaction with bz to a minimum
2005-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- maybe somone should make #u-bz
2005-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- for Brazil ;)
2005-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	pitti	CarlFK	wouldn't help, a person can only read a limited number of channels
2005-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	CarlFK	pitti	- goo dpoint
