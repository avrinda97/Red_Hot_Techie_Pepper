2004-11-25T06:37:00.000Z	kapputu		a question for you guys
2004-11-25T06:37:00.000Z	kapputu		how does one get back to programming in C, C++ after programming in Perl, Java?
2004-11-25T06:38:00.000Z	Nefarous	kapputu	odd question, easiest answer is to just use them all as much as possible, I'm rusty on my perl, but I program in C/C++/Java daily ...
2004-11-25T06:39:00.000Z	kapputu		no, every time I try to program in C, C++ these days, I feel frustrated and start thinking how easy this is in perl or java
2004-11-25T06:39:00.000Z	Nefarous	kapputu	do you use STL for C++?
2004-11-25T06:39:00.000Z	kapputu		especially I have started to hate pointers
2004-11-25T06:39:00.000Z	kapputu		no I haven't got down to serious coding in C++ yet but will start soon
2004-11-25T06:40:00.000Z	kapputu		I started by learning C and C++ but
2004-11-25T06:40:00.000Z	kapputu		yeah me too
2004-11-25T06:40:00.000Z	Nefarous	kapputu	STL makes C++ a little easier, especially when you are used to just having a library/class for everything under the sun in Java/Perl.
2004-11-25T06:40:00.000Z	kapputu		ic
2004-11-25T06:40:00.000Z	kapputu		yeah I kinda have an idea of what STL is
2004-11-25T06:41:00.000Z	kapputu		but I'm struggling to get back
2004-11-25T06:41:00.000Z	kapputu		all the more since I'm working as a Perl developer
2004-11-25T06:41:00.000Z	Nefarous	kapputu	for perl I just keep a book nearby :)
2004-11-25T06:41:00.000Z	kapputu	ogra	what's python's connection to Ubuntu
2004-11-25T06:41:00.000Z	kapputu		when I was installing, I found that a lot of python libraries got installed
2004-11-25T06:42:00.000Z	Nefarous	kapputu	do you find yourself choosing the language or being forced to use one or the other? (I guess this is all offtopic here)
