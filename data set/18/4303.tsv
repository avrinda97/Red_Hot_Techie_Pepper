2009-10-02T22:52:00.000Z	Petein		hi.i was wondering whether ubuntu has a power manager which lets you maintain your pc for better performance or for longer battery life(by making your machine a bit slower). is that safe??
2009-10-02T22:53:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	yes. And yes, it's safe.
2009-10-02T22:53:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	how?
2009-10-02T22:53:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	where can i setup it for best battery life?
2009-10-02T22:53:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	if you're talking about battery power then I assume you have Ubuntu installed on a laptop. Correct?
2009-10-02T22:54:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	yes its on a laptop
2009-10-02T22:54:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	then look in your system tray. You should see a battery icon.
2009-10-02T22:54:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	yeah i know but nowhere it says about battery life
2009-10-02T22:55:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	right-click the battery. You will open a window that allows some basic power management settings.
2009-10-02T22:55:00.000Z	xiong		General advice: When clicking something doesn't do what you want or expect, try right-clicking.
2009-10-02T22:57:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	ok then. right click >preferences. then?
2009-10-02T22:58:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	another thing you might want to do is install a CPU monitor into a panel. Right-click in the panel, choose add, choose CPU Scaling. You'll find that CPU frequency has a large effect on battery life. The other major factors are drive use and backlight.
2009-10-02T22:58:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	you see what you get under Preferences?
2009-10-02T22:58:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	I don't know if that's what you expected but that's power management.
2009-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	i did that with the cpu. i hope it will be ok
2009-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	i put it to power save
2009-10-02T23:00:00.000Z	xiong	Petein	I don't see the risk factor. Of all the things you can do to save power, the riskiest are pretty much unavoidable: Suspend, Hibernate, or Shut Down.
2009-10-02T23:00:00.000Z	Petein	xiong	so i put the cpu frequency to the lowest it had = 1.2 GHz , can i do smth else?
