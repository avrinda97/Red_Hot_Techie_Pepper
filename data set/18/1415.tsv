2011-10-16T22:17:00.000Z	ivanBliminse		Hi everyone.. I just got finished installing 11.10 on a new laptop, and when it asked me during installing to set up a wireless network i didn't.  Now there is no wireless, and when I click "enable wireless" it doesn't work
2011-10-16T22:17:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	iwconfig   #What does that say?
2011-10-16T22:18:00.000Z	ivanBliminse	usr13	it says - no wireless extensions for lo and eth0, wlan0 says a lot
2011-10-16T22:19:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	Do you have more than one wireless device?
2011-10-16T22:20:00.000Z	ivanBliminse	usr13	what do you mean?  other wireless devices connected to the network? cell phones and what not..
2011-10-16T22:23:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid linksys ; sudo dhclient wlan0  #Where linksys is essid of your wireless router / AP
2011-10-16T22:23:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	Are you connected via wired connection right now?
2011-10-16T22:24:00.000Z	ivanBliminse	usr13	no, wired connection.. i didn't really get whatever your other message was... do you want me to type that into tutorial
2011-10-16T22:24:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	(I was talking about the PC you are working on when I asked if it had more than one wireless device).
2011-10-16T22:25:00.000Z	ivanBliminse	usr13	oh, no
2011-10-16T22:25:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	Do this:  iwconfig | pastebinit  #And send resulting URL here
2011-10-16T22:26:00.000Z	usr13	ivanBliminse	(If pastebinit has not been installed, you will be  asked to do so.)
