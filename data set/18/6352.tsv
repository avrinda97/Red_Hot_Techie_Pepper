2008-10-26T02:42:00.000Z	perillux		I want to install windows on a separate partition.  I currently have only ubuntu.  So I'm wondering, will the windows installation give me the option of creating a separate partition?  Or should I create one before I attempt to install?
2008-10-26T02:42:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	You should create one yourself.
2008-10-26T02:43:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	A user-friendly tool for the task is gparted.
2008-10-26T02:43:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: how do I do that?  could you either explain it, or link me to something that will explain it?
2008-10-26T02:44:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	Type "sudo apt-get install gparted" in a terminal.
2008-10-26T02:46:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	Be aware that Windows doesn't like to be on anything other than the first partition.
2008-10-26T02:47:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: so windows will automatically install to the first partition without askin?
2008-10-26T02:47:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	It should ask, but it won't really give you much choice.
2008-10-26T02:55:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: so how do I actually create a new partition.  I assume I have to first resize my current one but the resize button is grayed out.
2008-10-26T02:55:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	That brings up an issue that I forgot: you can't make changes to a drive that is in use.
2008-10-26T02:56:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	You will have to do it from the Live CD, or something else.
2008-10-26T02:56:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: so could I just right click the partition and choose the unmount option?
2008-10-26T02:56:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	No, because Ubuntu is running off it right now.
2008-10-26T02:57:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: ya, other than swap..
2008-10-26T02:58:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	I always forget about swap. ^^;
2008-10-26T02:58:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: ok thanks for all your help, gonna get started :)
2008-10-26T03:00:00.000Z	perillux	Strife89	fukas: 1 last question.  It should work just fine if I use a gutsy liveCD to do the partition, even though I'm on intrepid   right?
2008-10-26T03:02:00.000Z	Strife89	perillux	It should work.
