2010-01-15T03:17:00.000Z	MHz128		After installing openbox, and changing the theme with "obconf", nothing is happening! how do I apply these settings?
2010-01-15T03:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	they are applied
2010-01-15T03:17:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	I've changed the window theme, nothing changed...
2010-01-15T03:18:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	are you using ONLY openbox or gnome with openbox?
2010-01-15T03:18:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	gnome/openbox
2010-01-15T03:18:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	then i can't help sorry
2010-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	ok, how do I change the openbox desktop background? is there a taskbar application? or somethhing similar?
2010-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	you can use a program like nitrogen or feh to change the wallpaper. there is no taskbar application by default either.
2010-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	is there a third party taskbar app i can install?
2010-01-15T03:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	there are many
2010-01-15T03:23:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	where can I find a list of common/popular openbox apps to use?
2010-01-15T03:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	dunno. lxpanel, gnome-panel, tint2 are some popular ones
2010-01-15T03:24:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	gnome-panel is docking my openbox windows... :P
2010-01-15T03:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	i misread what you said, i thought you were asking for panels. there are no "openbox apps" - you can use any apps
2010-01-15T03:26:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	no worries. Gnome-panel is great. But how do I make it dock the windows? they are minimizing to 'nowhere' hehehe
2010-01-15T03:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	MHz128	do you have the applet added for windows  being docked to it?
2010-01-15T03:27:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	weird. I ran it from terminal, nothing happened. ran it from gnome-do, and now its fine :p
2010-01-15T03:29:00.000Z	MHz128	blakkheim	thanks for the advice!
