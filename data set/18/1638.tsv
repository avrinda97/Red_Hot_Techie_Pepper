2011-01-03T05:28:00.000Z	rez410		How can I get the keyring password to login automatically?
2011-01-03T05:29:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	what's the point of it then?
2011-01-03T05:30:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	well I want to be able to ssh into the box without having a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. As of now it logs in but asks for the keyring password so it can connect to my wirless network.
2011-01-03T05:31:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	so right now when it reboots i have to enter that in at the box itself before i can ssh
2011-01-03T05:31:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	you can put the password in /etc/network/interfaces
2011-01-03T05:32:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	and get rid of Network Manager
2011-01-03T05:32:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	ok then it will login automatically?
2011-01-03T05:32:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	yes. You have to specify the SSid and password. Not to mention that you can put all that in rc.local
2011-01-03T05:32:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	as an ifconfig command
2011-01-03T05:33:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	but /etc/network/interfaces is there for that particular reason
2011-01-03T05:33:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	how do I get rid of network manager?
2011-01-03T05:33:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	uninstall it
2011-01-03T05:34:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	ok I thought you meant something different
2011-01-03T05:34:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	better yet purge it.
2011-01-03T05:34:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	the package is called network-manager
2011-01-03T05:36:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	what is the format for the interfaces file?
2011-01-03T05:36:00.000Z	s5s	rez410	man interfaces
2011-01-03T06:13:00.000Z	rez410	s5s	so i removed network-manager and edited my /etc/network/interfaces file but it isnt connecting automatically.
