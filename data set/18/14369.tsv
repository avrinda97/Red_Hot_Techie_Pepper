2005-08-09T07:23:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	basically works out of the box
2005-08-09T07:24:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	you don't need to do anything special to get it wo work. it should just work [tm] 
2005-08-09T07:25:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	so does it work then?
2005-08-09T07:25:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	ah ok
2005-08-09T07:26:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	better try the "via" driver first
2005-08-09T07:27:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	ok, that's too old. get hoary :)
2005-08-09T07:28:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	order or download the CD
2005-08-09T07:32:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	you'll probably download less stuff
2005-08-09T07:34:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	yeah
2005-08-09T07:34:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	like said, it *should* :)
2005-08-09T10:56:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	/etc/lsb-release
2005-08-09T11:15:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	uh, try to "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and select the "via" driver... also make sure your monitor timings are OK
2005-08-09T11:16:00.000Z	gregg_	palandia	yeah
2005-08-10T08:41:00.000Z	palandia	gregg_	told me about a via driver in hoary for xorg, but when i dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg i connot select via driver i does not appear as an option
