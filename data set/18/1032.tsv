2011-06-27T03:16:00.000Z	Chheap		Should xubuntu run on compiz by default?
2011-06-27T03:17:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	 compiz should run well on xfce
2011-06-27T03:17:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	Just did a fresh install on notebook and i cant figure howto turn it on. (worked on ubuntu)
2011-06-27T03:18:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	 ok open a terminal    compiz --replace  ccp & disown
2011-06-27T03:19:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	  also be sure you installed  compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-06-27T03:19:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	yeah seems its not even installed.
2011-06-27T03:20:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	 ah ok
2011-06-27T03:30:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	  there is a way to get compiz installed completely with a script
2011-06-27T03:30:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	 could it be that this happened because i used the alternative install disc
2011-06-27T03:30:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	 unlikely
2011-06-27T03:31:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	 however   you may want to try the minimal install cd  next time
2011-06-27T03:31:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	 on that you can choose  xubuntu,, kubuntu ..gnome and other options
2011-06-27T03:31:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	No i had to use alternative install to get the encryption lvm
2011-06-27T03:32:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	  you can do that with  minimal as well
2011-06-27T03:32:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	 yeah gotta try next time. I just hate reinstalling this
2011-06-27T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	Chheap	  in terminal   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-06-27T03:35:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	 everything seems to be ok
2011-06-27T03:35:00.000Z	Chheap	coz_	still i feel like i miss some settings on appearance and keyboard
