2010-11-27T02:48:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	you can enable your CD as one of the repositories, and install the package from the CD if it's included in it.
2010-11-27T02:48:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	using synaptic.
2010-11-27T02:49:00.000Z	ubuntu	a_bug	oh, so I can stick in 10.10 CD, enable as repo, and ry installing that way?
2010-11-27T02:49:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	yes
2010-11-27T02:50:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	or if you can do without it, it's ok
2010-11-27T02:50:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	like using wpa_supplicant for wireless, etc
2010-11-27T02:51:00.000Z	ubuntu	a_bug	well, I'm wired...for some reason, internet not working, and appened after I uninstalled network manager :-(
2010-11-27T02:51:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	what kind of a connection do you have ?
2010-11-27T02:52:00.000Z	ubuntu	a_bug	it is a wired ethernet connection...RJ-45 cable to cable model or whatever it is called...the connection is working fine, I'm onthe connection right now from 8.10 LiveCD
2010-11-27T02:53:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	what happens when you plug in the connection on your non-live cd installation ?
2010-11-27T02:53:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	you can use ifconfig to list the available interfaces
2010-11-27T02:53:00.000Z	ubuntu	a_bug	ahhhh, I'll try hat, I remember that from when I used gentoo
2010-11-27T02:53:00.000Z	a_bug	ubuntu	and then configure them to use IPs, or if you have a DHCP server, run dhclient to get the IP for you
