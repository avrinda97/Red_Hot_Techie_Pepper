2007-01-21T14:20:00.000Z	atlantia		sorry spammed it a hair
2007-01-21T14:21:00.000Z	Flannel	atlantia	because all thosepackages depend on that.   Most of them are meta packages though,
2007-01-21T14:21:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	i just wanna reinstall the alsa packages
2007-01-21T14:21:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	not uninstall gnome-desktop
2007-01-21T14:22:00.000Z	Flannel	atlantia	"ubuntu-desktop" is a meta package, however, you can reinstall it after removnig your sound stuff, and it'll most likely put all te stuff you just removed back in
2007-01-21T14:22:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	will have to do install gdm ubuntu-desktop afterwards i guess
2007-01-21T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	atlantia	and, you won't lose your GUI while doing it either, for that matter.
2007-01-21T14:23:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	main issue is 1.) when i try to select ALSA as my playback device in sound, i get "cannot conect to sound server, but I can select the card itself and it works. I am trying to get sound working for WOW
2007-01-21T14:23:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	heh yeah
2007-01-21T14:24:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	brb reboot
2007-01-21T14:28:00.000Z	atlantia	Flannel	let me ask you this, am i supposed to be able to select ESD or ALSA as my sound device in the sound settings?
