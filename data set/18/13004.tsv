2007-06-28T14:43:00.000Z	babo		so basically I've switched a little dropdown menu on my GNOME desktop, and by doing so I've completely totalled my ubuntu system. Noone on here can help me and noone replies to my forum post ? That's great.
2007-06-28T14:43:00.000Z	babo		so I guess ubuntu isn't ready for the big time afterall ...
2007-06-28T14:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	for wifi the best shot is networkmanager
2007-06-28T14:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	you've tried it yet?
2007-06-28T14:45:00.000Z	babo	Myrtti	networkmanager ?
2007-06-28T14:46:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	NetworkManager or network-manager
2007-06-28T14:46:00.000Z	babo	Myrtti	it's installed by default right ?
2007-06-28T14:46:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	if I remember correctly
2007-06-28T14:47:00.000Z	babo	Myrtti	I might have been using it already. In fact, I think it may have been the source of the problem :-(
2007-06-28T14:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	but you need the applet to get it working 100% and disable /etc/network/interfaces all devices except local loppback
2007-06-28T14:48:00.000Z	babo	Myrtti	disable /etc/network/interfaces ? I'm not sure I like the sound of that ...
2007-06-28T14:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	that enables roaming
2007-06-28T14:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	not to disable the whole file
2007-06-28T14:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	just the lines that try to configure other devices than loopback
2007-06-28T14:48:00.000Z	babo	Myrtti	yeah, now I remember. enabling roaming was where my problems began ... :-(
2007-06-28T14:49:00.000Z	babo	Myrtti	what happens when you enable roaming ? it takes all the other interfaces off-line ?
2007-06-28T14:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	well yes and no
2007-06-28T14:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	babo	you need to have all the bits and pieces working as well
