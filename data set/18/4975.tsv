2010-08-10T11:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	try samba
2010-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	it could be as easy as right click in nautilus the dir you want to share
2010-08-10T17:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	 I have a samba config that works for me but has like no security
2010-08-10T17:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	 and heres a sample samba config found at /etc/samba/smb.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com/475886/
2010-08-10T17:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	 aren't you happy with my example?
2010-08-10T17:08:00.000Z	garry	sacarlson	what i do with that paste it to smb.comf file
2010-08-10T17:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	modify the files to fit your envirnment
2010-08-10T17:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	garry	just use the global part and use some gui tool to setup the other part like nautilus with right click and select share
