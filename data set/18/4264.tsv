2009-06-04T05:40:00.000Z	freakabcd		hi all
2009-06-04T05:40:00.000Z	freakabcd		How do i get single user mode going on laptop with jaunty?
2009-06-04T05:40:00.000Z	freakabcd		the recovery mode is asking for the root passwd with was never set!
2009-06-04T05:42:00.000Z	freakabcd		now i need to go back to my previous xorg.conf file. the only possible way seems i reboot with the live disc screw around with etc/shadow to set myself a root passwd or just do restoring file from the live session
2009-06-04T05:42:00.000Z	freakabcd		this is a bit insane don't you think?
2009-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	freakabcd		and it obviously doesn;t work with my user passwd
2009-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	fccf	freakabcd	... look in /etc/X11/ for xorg.conf.1 or xorg.conf.biglongstrechofnumgers
2009-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	fccf	freakabcd	those are backups
2009-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	freakabcd	fccf	did you also *not* read what i said?
2009-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	freakabcd		there is no display or even console
2009-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	freakabcd		Xorg locks up my machine completely
2009-06-04T05:44:00.000Z	freakabcd		mattsqz: please stop saying that i need to use sudo or be in the admin group etc.
2009-06-04T05:44:00.000Z	freakabcd		please!!
2009-06-04T05:44:00.000Z	freakabcd		ok, now that is out of the way.
2009-06-04T05:44:00.000Z	fccf	freakabcd	... sudo does not require a pw on the live disk
2009-06-04T05:45:00.000Z	freakabcd	fccf	i'm not bound to have the live disc with me always
2009-06-04T05:45:00.000Z	freakabcd		and also the' recovery mode' is supposed to allow you to fix the system without access to the live disc
2009-06-04T05:46:00.000Z	freakabcd	fccf	as is the case right now. i don;t have the live disc with me
