2007-09-03T11:28:00.000Z	ebenton		is there a link to what version of nvidia binary drivers will be supported in Gusty?
2007-09-03T11:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	100.14.11 is the current version
2007-09-03T11:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	Those are the latest linux drivers and I doubt they'll be upgraded even if there are new drivers released
2007-09-03T11:29:00.000Z	ebenton	PriceChild	is that also true for Fiesty?
2007-09-03T11:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	no, in feisty it is 9755

2007-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	ebenton	PriceChild	thanks for the info - time to make a decision.
2007-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	feisty
2007-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	please do not use gutsy until its release in october
2007-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	ebenton	PriceChild	would you suggest performing a manual install of the binary drivers then?
2007-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	no
2007-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	what card do you have?
2007-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	ebenton		nvidia 8600gts
2007-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	yes
2007-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	that's the only way you'll get 3d accel in feisty... but its not supported by ubuntu
2007-09-03T11:32:00.000Z	ebenton	PriceChild	yes what? for the manual install?
2007-09-03T11:32:00.000Z	PriceChild	ebenton	you won't be able to get 3d acceleration on feisty without manually installing the drivers yourself
2007-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	ebenton	PriceChild	again thanks
