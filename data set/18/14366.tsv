2005-09-12T05:03:00.000Z	Gorgonzola		stupid question: is the proper Firefox icon included with Ubuntu... i want to use that on my Gnome bar instead of the Globe icon
2005-09-12T05:03:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	no, the Mozilla people won't let ubuntu include it
2005-09-12T05:04:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	they're very protective of their trademark
2005-09-12T05:05:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	is there anywhere to d/l the icon? alot of the screenshots i've seen of linux im sure include the firefox icon on shortcuts
2005-09-12T05:05:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	lots of distributions are not nearly as careful about this sort of thing as Debian and Ubuntu
2005-09-12T05:06:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	I'm sure it's on the firefox website somewhere
2005-09-12T05:06:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	good point :)
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	power down. swap cards. power up.
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	is it that easy?
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	yes
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	is it because they both use the same nvidia drivers?
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	yes
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	sweet! thanks
2005-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	if they used different drivers, there'd be an extra step
2005-09-20T16:38:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	for my learning... what step would that be?
2005-09-20T16:38:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, pick the correct driver
2005-09-20T16:39:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	bob2	oh, yes i should have figured that out myself, thanks again :)
2005-09-20T16:39:00.000Z	bob2	Gorgonzola	np
