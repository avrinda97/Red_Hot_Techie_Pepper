2010-04-13T08:29:00.000Z	hanasaki		I am trying to play a DVD and the sound is skipping.  how can it be fixed?  happens with all DVD's . they play fine in a dvd player
2010-04-13T08:30:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	what are you using to play them?
2010-04-13T08:30:00.000Z	hanasaki	darolu	 tried mplayer and vlc
2010-04-13T08:31:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	run mplayer from a terminal (command line) see what is the problem with the audio; try different audio options and see if some of them works for you
2010-04-13T08:31:00.000Z	hanasaki	darolu	 how do I run it from the cmd line
2010-04-13T08:33:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	mplayer dvd:// -dvd-device
2010-04-13T08:33:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	to find what your dvd device is use "dmesg |grep -i dvd"
2010-04-13T08:37:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	read this link to learn about mplayer usage, browse through chapters to learn how to change the audio options, etc. I'm pretty sure mplayer will make it work for you, it has never failed me :)

2010-04-13T08:38:00.000Z	hanasaki	darolu	what link?
2010-04-13T08:38:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/dvd.html
2010-04-13T08:38:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	sorry forgot to paste it :p anyways, it's weird it prints that error, is your drive a dvd-rom one? does Ubuntu recognizes as one?
2010-04-13T08:39:00.000Z	hanasaki	darolu	 yes
2010-04-13T08:40:00.000Z	hanasaki	darolu	 mplayer dvd://dev/cdrom0 <= won't play.. right click and play works but the sound is off
2010-04-13T08:41:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	try mplayer dvd:// -dvd-device /dev/dvd
2010-04-13T08:41:00.000Z	darolu	hanasaki	although the error you pasted early is very weird; I haven't seen it before
2010-04-13T08:42:00.000Z	hanasaki	darolu	 I am gonna get a job in destructive testing lol
