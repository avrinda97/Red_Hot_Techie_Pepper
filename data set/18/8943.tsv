2010-01-08T09:06:00.000Z	osirisx11		[xorg] how do i blow away my xorg.conf and get a shiny new one?
2010-01-08T09:07:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	in a terminal type: sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup    ..then restart X
2010-01-08T09:07:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	that's it? i just move it and it will be auto regened? even with a binary driver selected?
2010-01-08T09:08:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	someone else told me sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-01-08T09:08:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	if one doesn't exist one will be created; on versions befor 9.10
2010-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	i have 9.10
2010-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	that too would create a new one but why get rid of the old one without making a back up.
2010-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	thanks!
2010-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	since you're on 9.10 you will not get a new xorg.conf but things will be auto detected.
2010-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	one more thing.. how do i restart x? i can delete the file (i already backed it up before)
2010-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	so i SHOULDNT RM my xorg.conf?
2010-01-08T09:11:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	make backups rather than deleting. much safer.. sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart  .will restart X ..if you're using gnome
2010-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	sudo service gdm restart is the preferred method on 9.10 and beyond.
2010-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	thanks but you did not answer my question. i already did make backups.. but you say things will be autodetected but it won't create a new xorg.conf?
2010-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	with 9.10 i do not believe so. xorg.conf is depreciated from 9.10 on.  things are autodetected and run. although an xorg.conf can be used to specify things you want.
2010-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	osirisx11	bastid_raZor	OHHHHHHHHHHH thanks... i didn't know that... okay so my plan is to rm my xorg.conf (already backed up), restart X, then try to install latest nvidia binary 195.30
2010-01-08T09:14:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	osirisx11	that should do fine.
