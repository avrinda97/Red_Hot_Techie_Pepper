2006-04-25T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	ban on who, for what?
2006-04-25T11:21:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	ban on me, no reason at all
2006-04-25T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	here? unlikely to be "for no reason at all"...

2006-04-25T11:22:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	my last chat there was about network manager
2006-04-25T11:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	sorry, I don't have ops for #ubuntu+1, afaik...
2006-04-25T11:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	actually, I do have ops there - just a minute
2006-04-25T11:23:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	thanks
2006-04-25T11:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	I can't see any ban in place at #ubuntu+1 that would keep you out - try again
2006-04-25T11:25:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	* Impossible de rejoindre #ubuntu+1 (Vous tes banni).
2006-04-25T11:26:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	anything on abo.wanadoo.fr ?
2006-04-25T11:26:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	many lusers on this ISP...
2006-04-25T11:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	nope, not on +1
2006-04-25T11:26:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	well, i still can't join anyhow
2006-04-25T11:27:00.000Z	chiwawa_42	Madpilot	thanks for trying anyway, i hope it'll be dropped soon
2006-04-25T11:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	chiwawa_42	yeah, the banlist for +1 is very short, and there's nothing I can see that would keep you out
