2007-12-04T21:43:00.000Z	krim	Marcusklaas	It might be your graphics card that sucks. I used to have an ATI Radeon 9800 and since ATI used to have worthless drivers (hopefully that'll change soon) the GUI felt really slow, now that I have an internal intel graphics card with free drivers everything is fast and smooth.
2007-12-04T21:44:00.000Z	Marcusklaas		no i just mean .. when you drag a window you can see the trail of white behind it
2007-12-04T21:44:00.000Z	krim	Marcusklaas	Yup, I know what you mean
2007-12-04T21:45:00.000Z	krim	Marcusklaas	Is it really slow when you select a big area on the desktop too?
