2005-12-16T06:20:00.000Z	psi		My Breezy install hangs while loading the "ide-generic" module. any ideas?
2005-12-16T06:20:00.000Z	psi		it's during the hardware detection
2005-12-16T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	psi	is it a SATA system?
2005-12-16T06:21:00.000Z	psi	soundray	yes
2005-12-16T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	psi	SATA support is a bit patchy in places. Do you know which chipset you have?
2005-12-16T06:22:00.000Z	psi	soundray	no, not really. i run debian on this machine, though.
2005-12-16T06:23:00.000Z	soundray	psi	well. it's possible that SATA isn't the problem then.
2005-12-16T06:24:00.000Z	psi	soundray	and, iirc, i've run earlier versions of ubuntu
2005-12-16T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	psi	when I installed, I had to use noapic as a kernel boot parameter. That one often helps when booting recent machines.
2005-12-16T06:26:00.000Z	psi	soundray	ah, i'll give it shot
2005-12-16T06:30:00.000Z	psi	soundray	does that mean typing "linux noapic" at the boot prompt? it didn't make a difference
2005-12-16T06:30:00.000Z	soundray	psi	yes.
2005-12-16T06:30:00.000Z	soundray	psi	nolapic is another one you can try.
2005-12-16T06:31:00.000Z	soundray	psi	another weird problem I had fixed itself when I set the BIOS to re-read the configuration.
2005-12-16T06:32:00.000Z	soundray	psi	sorry can't remember the exact name of the option.
2005-12-16T06:32:00.000Z	soundray	psi	something about ESD configuration I think.
2005-12-16T06:33:00.000Z	soundray	psi	but you can probably tell I'm fishing in the dark...
2005-12-16T06:34:00.000Z	psi	soundray	no luck with nolapic either. thanks anyway. i'll dig around some more.
