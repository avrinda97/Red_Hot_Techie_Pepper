2010-12-23T01:31:00.000Z	vladikoff		this might be a strange question, but did anyone manage to read the PS3 HDD in ubuntu?
2010-12-23T01:32:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	do you know the filesystem ?
2010-12-23T01:37:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	i think they call it IFS, (by IBM), trying to confirm...
2010-12-23T01:37:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	or EXT3
2010-12-23T01:38:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	ifs never heard of it. ext3 would be easy
2010-12-23T01:39:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	should i use gparted?
2010-12-23T01:39:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	do you want to repartition it?
2010-12-23T01:40:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	i just want read-only access
2010-12-23T01:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	u may use gparted to find out about the filesystem type
2010-12-23T01:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	but it won't mount it for you afaik
2010-12-23T01:41:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	says 37gb unallocated
2010-12-23T01:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	how big is it?
2010-12-23T01:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	how big is it in total?
2010-12-23T01:42:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	37-40gb
2010-12-23T01:42:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	the size is right, but 'unallocated' is wrong i guess
2010-12-23T01:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	use fdisk -l  maybe it will tell you more
2010-12-23T01:51:00.000Z	vladikoff	sam-_-	thanks!
2010-12-23T01:52:00.000Z	sam-_-	vladikoff	it could also use a partition table that even fdisk won't understand. in that case you need to google
