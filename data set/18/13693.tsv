2006-11-25T06:19:00.000Z	sn9	super	no card has ever worked better than the aironet 350 under linux
2006-11-25T06:20:00.000Z	sn9	super	you don't install a driver; you just plug the thing in
2006-11-25T06:21:00.000Z	sn9	super	you set all the wireless settings before trying to enable the card, right?

2006-11-25T08:35:00.000Z	sn9	super	were you trying to create a network, or log onto one?
2006-11-25T08:36:00.000Z	sn9	super	then you could have set the network name to the word "any"
2006-11-25T08:36:00.000Z	sn9	super	but yeah, a blank means no network at all
2006-11-25T08:37:00.000Z	sn9	super	whatever one you entered it will autojoin next time anyway
2006-11-25T08:38:00.000Z	sn9	super	if "any" was what you entered, it will autojoin whatever one it sees first every time
