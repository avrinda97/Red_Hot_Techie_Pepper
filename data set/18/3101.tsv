2010-06-11T11:13:00.000Z	Lint01	no-name	use VM intead of WIne
2010-06-11T11:13:00.000Z	no-name	Lint01	which one is best for games?
2010-06-11T11:14:00.000Z	Lint01		or just install Windows for your games, it's unlikely the Wine will catch up anytime soon
2010-06-11T11:14:00.000Z	Lint01	no-name	I'd try vmware; because openbox has no 3d support despite all the lies in docs
2010-06-11T11:15:00.000Z	no-name	Lint01	you mean virtualbox?
2010-06-11T11:15:00.000Z	Lint01		yeap
2010-06-11T11:15:00.000Z	no-name		oh
2010-06-11T11:15:00.000Z	no-name		someone told me he could run crysis in virtualbox
2010-06-11T11:15:00.000Z	no-name		must have been a lie :P
2010-06-11T11:16:00.000Z	no-name		I tried to change the VRAM in vmware workstation 7 today
2010-06-11T11:16:00.000Z	no-name		i used an option that you add to the vmx to change it and it wouldn't boot after that
2010-06-11T11:16:00.000Z	no-name		set it to 128mb, then 64mb, no-go
2010-06-11T11:17:00.000Z	no-name		even after I got rid of the line in the vmx file it wouldn't boot, strangely enough
2010-06-11T11:17:00.000Z	no-name	Lint01	do you know how to change the amount of RAM for the vmware graphics card?
