2006-04-14T15:22:00.000Z	nickrud	ubd	log out, then press ctl alt f1 , you can log in there
2006-04-14T15:24:00.000Z	nickrud	ubd	graft pointed out that you truly need to kill the x server, after logging in at ctl-alt-f1 , type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop

2006-04-15T16:38:00.000Z	nickrud	ubd	I'll say only that that's the keyboard configuration. xkb is a black art to me
