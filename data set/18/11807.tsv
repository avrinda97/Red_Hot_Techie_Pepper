2008-11-15T02:38:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	tried hitting reload in nautilus?
2008-11-15T02:38:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	no change
2009-07-17T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	there should be no need to mess with those files manually, you'll just confuse the package manager and then later it won't do what you expect.  Try what bazhang said as that should work
2009-07-17T06:31:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	it should work but it doesn't
2009-07-17T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	really?  What did you do exactly?
2009-07-17T06:32:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	i set system preferences preferred applications to firefox-3.5
2009-07-17T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	that's not the last thing bazhang said
2009-07-17T06:33:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	well, that's great but i'm tired of right clicking.  it doesn't remember my previous setting
2009-07-17T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	read what ubottu said more closely.  Hint: "Properties"
2009-07-17T06:34:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	alright, sorry.  thanks for the help
2009-07-17T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	no need to apologize, glad it worked for you!
2010-05-02T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	this channel is for ubuntu support
2010-05-02T07:07:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	i've asked for support
2010-05-02T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	the last couple of comments I've seen just seem to be sarcastic quips, take that elsewhere please
2010-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	peepsalot	jrib	sorry, this is just the most frustrating thing to not be able to even boot a rescue cd.  i can't get anywhere now
2010-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	peepsalot	I understand, just take it easy, focus on providing details (in a single line) about your problem.  That's the best way to get help
