2006-04-26T10:52:00.000Z	HymnToLife		Cassidy123> ext resizing is a bit of a hassle, I don't think Parted can do it
2006-04-26T10:53:00.000Z	HymnToLife		i don't remeber, search in Synaptic

2006-04-26T10:57:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	when i use it i get "sudo: unable to lookup zidolap via gethostbyname()"
2006-04-26T10:58:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	not unless it tried to configure it by itself when i chose to fix it when the installation was done..
2006-04-26T10:59:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	not since the installation was complete, no
2006-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	i get an error: "Couldn't find the internett-adress for zidolap. This will disable GNOME to work properly. This can be fixed by adding zidolap to /etc/hosts."
2006-04-26T11:05:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	not that i'm sure what i'm supposed to place in "/etc/hosts", what worries me most is that i'm unable to edit it since sudo doesn't work
2006-04-26T11:07:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	ah, there we go.. don't know what i'm supposed to place in /etc/hosts, do you? :)
2006-04-26T11:08:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	oki :)
2006-04-26T11:10:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	ok, so the missing part was probably the "my_hostname" after "127.0.0.1 localhost" :)
2006-04-26T11:16:00.000Z	zido	HymnToLife	works great now, thanks alot :D
