2012-06-12T18:30:00.000Z	Jonii_		Now X.org crashed
2012-06-12T18:30:00.000Z	Jonii_		The weird thing is, I can't actually experience any instability
2012-06-12T18:31:00.000Z	Jonii_		The only reason I know that X.org crashed is the window popping up and explaining that it's what happened
2012-06-12T18:32:00.000Z	Jonii_		There's no sign of redrawing anything, no slowing down, no graphics tearing, no part of system becoming unstable, no visible bugs, no features lacking, no options disappearing, no programs I can see crashing
2012-06-12T18:33:00.000Z	Jonii_		I'm kinda curious to know how that can be the case. I mean, X.org crashed. It's supposed to handle... Well, everything
2012-06-12T18:35:00.000Z	Jonii_		Then lots of technobabble about specifics of that crash
2012-06-12T18:36:00.000Z	Jonii_		What I don't get is, how come all the problems this crash causes to me is this windows popping up
2012-06-12T18:38:00.000Z	Jonii_		Few days earlier I was listening to music, and I got similar report, the only difference was that it was some low-level sound device controller that had crashed. My music played on uninterrupted
2012-06-12T18:39:00.000Z	mneptok	Jonii_	that's called "failing elegantly" and is something to which programmer's aspire.
2012-06-12T18:40:00.000Z	Jonii_	mneptok	well, yeah, if that's the case, it's extremely cool, but I'm still worried a bit about these constant crashes all around my system
2012-06-12T18:40:00.000Z	Jonii_		Again, these happens 2-4 times/boot
2012-06-12T18:40:00.000Z	mneptok	Jonii_	try a live CD? and a Live session of something like Xubuntu or Kubuntu? see wha'ppens?
2012-06-12T18:41:00.000Z	Jonii_	mneptok	I could try that, though I'd have no idea how to use the data gathered that way to decide what to do next
2012-06-12T18:42:00.000Z	mneptok	Jonii_	the critical fata is "does this happen on Xubuntu where there is no Unity, there is no 3D compositing, and things are generally less complex?"
2012-06-12T18:42:00.000Z	Jonii_		There is a possibility that my memory controller is bust. I suspended my system before applying a required patch that makes the system not-bust-memory-controller-when-going-suspend
2012-06-12T18:43:00.000Z	Jonii_	mneptok	that sounds sensible. Though I'm unsure if Xubuntu has identical way of telling user that something just crashed?
2012-06-12T18:43:00.000Z	Jonii_		All I have to go on with is that "Ubuntu has encountered an internal error" window that pops up, that behavior needs to be in place in Xubuntu also
2012-06-12T18:44:00.000Z	mneptok	Jonii_	apport exists in Xubuntu, also.
