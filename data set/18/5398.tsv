2008-11-01T05:18:00.000Z	J-_		Is there going to be any better support for the GM965 chipset in hardy? Supposedly it was getting better per release. In glxgears I'm only getting 550 FPS whereas in Hardy I was getting over 1000 FPS. Can anyone suggest something?
2008-11-01T05:18:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	you mean Intrepid?
2008-11-01T05:19:00.000Z	J-_	JFo	 Yeah, I'll repeat myself. 550 FPS in Intrepid, 1000 FPS in Hardy. Benchmarking with glxgears.
2008-11-01T05:23:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	I see several bugs on it, but I am still digging to see when the milestone is
2008-11-01T05:24:00.000Z	J-_	JFo	 Cool, thanks. Do you think such milestones will overcome soon?
2008-11-01T05:24:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	no idea. I'll let you know what I find
2008-11-01T05:26:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	I found a bug on it freezing in #d apps
2008-11-01T05:28:00.000Z	J-_	JFo	 So, in other words--Intrepid will stay how I'm experiencing it? Let me pastebin my lspci
2008-11-01T05:28:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	ok

2008-11-01T05:31:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	ok, looks like your hardware isn't included in this bug. I'll add it
2008-11-01T05:31:00.000Z	J-_	JFo	Sounds good. :)
2008-11-01T05:35:00.000Z	J-_	JFo	 Is there anything else you want me to check out to be more specific about the bugs? And, will bug fixes be implemented in Intrepid?
2008-11-01T05:35:00.000Z	JFo	J-_	I can't think of anything, I included the information from the pastebin to the bug
2008-11-01T05:36:00.000Z	J-_	JFo	 Cool, thanks a lot.
