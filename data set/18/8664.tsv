2007-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	daddydoc		anyone know how to access your linux samba drive from windows?
2007-07-15T10:52:00.000Z	daddydoc		I can find the linux machine in my mshome neighborhood folder in my windowsxp machine
2007-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	daddydoc		but I cant access the linux box
2007-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	daddydoc		it keeps asking for a login and password
2007-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	daddydoc		ok
2007-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	daddydoc		sudo something?
2007-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	daddydoc		I did in windows, so maybe it is permissions in linux
2007-07-15T10:54:00.000Z	daddydoc		do I use the chown command in linux for a particular folder?
2007-07-15T10:55:00.000Z	daddydoc		I have shared a couple of linux folders already
2007-07-15T10:56:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	did you use the Shared Folders applet in "System..Adminitration...Shared Folders"?
2007-07-15T10:57:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	so the share properties for "Share through" is "Windows networks"
2007-07-15T10:58:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	path?
2007-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	and tell us what the first column has
2007-07-15T11:04:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	so I'm assuming you're using username 'daddydoc' and your linux password?
2007-07-15T11:06:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	i mean when you try to connect from the windows machines...you're connecting with username 'daddydoc' nd password the same as your linux password
2007-07-15T11:08:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	well it doestn look like a permissions issue
2007-07-15T11:09:00.000Z	dantalizing	daddydoc	thought you were trying to move files to linux
