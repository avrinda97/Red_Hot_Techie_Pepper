2008-11-14T08:38:00.000Z	Odditie_		Can anyone help me out? I'm trying to install Gnome-ppp on my Ubuntu machine, problem is it has no internet connection. I downloaded Gnome-ppp on my windows machine and transferred it over to my other machine, but i'm have a stupid moment and cant figure out how to install it
2008-11-14T08:39:00.000Z	Falstius	Odditie_	sudo dpkg -i ... ?
2008-11-14T08:40:00.000Z	Odditie_		Thank you Falstius, its been a little while since I had to get into this and I was having a dumb moment
2008-11-14T08:49:00.000Z	Odditie_		ok Darkbishop, I have the package "unzipped" but still lost on how to use the install or install-sh on it...I'm being a complete noob right now
2008-11-14T08:52:00.000Z	Odditie_		I just get an error saying no target
2008-11-14T09:03:00.000Z	Odditie_		Ok darkbishop, I have figured out a little more. I know I need to do a ./configure, then make, install etc. Problem is the ./configure ends quickly saying it cannot create executables
2008-11-14T09:07:00.000Z	Odditie_		darkbishop, make doesn't work either
2008-11-14T09:08:00.000Z	Odditie_		no targets specified and no makefile
2008-11-14T09:08:00.000Z	Odditie_		gnome-ppp
2008-11-14T09:08:00.000Z	Odditie_		it would be easier if I had an internet connection on that computer, but thats why i'm trying to install that, lol
2008-11-14T09:09:00.000Z	Falstius	Odditie_	you're trying to compile gnome-ppp from source?  Why not just install the ubuntu deb file?  You would need to install build-essentials and more to do the compilation.
2008-11-14T09:10:00.000Z	Odditie_		well my problem is my only connection here is through a USB modem, which it doesn't pick up as a modem. I was hoping gnome-ppp will detect it
2008-11-14T09:11:00.000Z	Odditie_		I just downloaded the tar.gz from the net and was trying to install it through that...I may have the wrong file to be attempting this
2008-11-14T09:11:00.000Z	Falstius	Odditie_	you can download the deb package and copy that to your machine.
2008-11-14T09:12:00.000Z	Falstius	Odditie_	try gcc -v, does it say command not found?
2008-11-14T09:12:00.000Z	Odditie_		I'm just trying to get the computer to detect the modem. I already have the drivers and everything to run it on the computer, just the computer doesn't detect the modem
2008-11-14T09:13:00.000Z	Odditie_	Falstius	gcc popped up a bunch of things
2008-11-14T09:13:00.000Z	Falstius	Odditie_	okay, I was afraid you were trying to compile without it installed :)
