2011-09-28T23:10:00.000Z	taza		How would I allow all users to update system?
2011-09-28T23:10:00.000Z	taza		Just update system, not do anything else admin-related
2011-09-28T23:10:00.000Z	usr13	taza	Include them in admin group
2011-09-28T23:11:00.000Z	taza	usr13	No, that's a bad idea
2011-09-28T23:11:00.000Z	usr13	taza	What?  Allowing them to update the system?  Or...?
2011-09-28T23:12:00.000Z	usr13	taza	So what do you suggest?
2011-09-28T23:12:00.000Z	taza	usr13	I don't *know*, but I know that idea is a bad one too.
2011-09-28T23:13:00.000Z	usr13	taza	Well, I guess it depends on what you consider good or bad.  Why don't YOU just do the updates?
2011-09-28T23:13:00.000Z	taza	usr13	Would you stop asking me questions about why and help with the how?
2011-09-28T23:14:00.000Z	usr13	taza	I suppose you could use  a cron job to do it once in a while.  Set up some sort of schedule?
2011-09-28T23:14:00.000Z	usr13	taza	What version of Ubuntu is it?
2011-09-28T23:14:00.000Z	taza	usr13	11.04
2011-09-28T23:15:00.000Z	usr13	taza	Is a cron job acceptable?
2011-09-28T23:16:00.000Z	taza	usr13	*sigh* No.
2011-09-28T23:17:00.000Z	usr13	taza	Well, if you werent opposed to giving some details about the system, we could probably give you more specific advise.   Why is it you can't do it from time to time.  You could use teamviewer and have them call you once a month or so and you could do it.
