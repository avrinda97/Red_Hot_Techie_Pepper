2005-04-17T06:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	is there some install procedure within windows to add a network printer ?
2005-04-17T06:36:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	it doesn't ask for your printers cd disk ?
2005-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	QMario	LinuxJones	are still there?
2005-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	yeah but windows needs to load the driver to format the data for your model of printer
2005-04-17T06:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	can you add it manually and set it as a netowrk printer (I haven't run windows in like 5 years, going from memory :D)
2005-04-17T06:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	so you can't add a network printer somewhere in the control panel ?
2005-04-17T06:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	this might help if your using cups >> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NetworkPrintingFromWin2000
2005-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	have you looked at >> www.ubuntuguide.org there is a whole section on getting Samba up and running and there are resources on the wiki

2005-09-28T12:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	long time no see :)
2005-09-29T09:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	QMario	ctrl + alt + up arrow
