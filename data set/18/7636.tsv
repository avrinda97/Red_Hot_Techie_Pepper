2007-12-06T13:31:00.000Z	wasme		anyone have ANY idea what's going on here: I have an nvidia video card, and I was running fiesty with no problems, although I did have to install the drivers from nvidia's site rather than from ubuntu. I just upgraded to gutsy, and had a hell of a time trying to get it to work, but eventually I figured out this much: I have nvidia-glx-new installed, and when I first boot up ubuntu can't find my video card and kicks me into low graphics

2007-12-06T13:32:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	nvidia.com drivers hosed your system after the kernel upgrade
2007-12-06T13:38:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	so, uh, why would it work after removing the module and restarting X? Doesn't X just reload the same module anyway?
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	what driver is your xorg.conf using?
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	nvidia
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	installing the PROPER ubuntu nvidia resttricted drivers should fix it again
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	I did that already
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	I removed everything I could find nvidia related and reinstalled nvidia-glx-new over again.
2007-12-06T13:40:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	then show us the xorg log from when it doesn't work properly on bootup
2007-12-06T13:40:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	not nvidia-glx. ALL of the drivers. glx AND kernel module
2007-12-06T13:41:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	uh, the only drivers installed are nvidia-glx-new and restricted, which automaticly got removed when I removed nvidia-glx-new
2007-12-06T13:41:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	dpkg -l |grep nvidia
2007-12-06T13:42:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	just nvidia-glx-new and nvidia-kernel-common
2007-12-06T13:42:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	I told you what you need. if you want to ignore it: your choice. good day
2007-12-06T13:44:00.000Z	wasme	wols_	and as I said I already did that. It didn't help. But I can see you've concluded I'm not listening, so I guess I should conclude I won't get any help here.
2007-12-06T13:44:00.000Z	wols_	wasme	as you just said you did NOT. no kernel module. now go away until you can answer the questions posed to you
