2009-01-11T05:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	Uplink	I believe raylu's right. Flash is closed-sourced. I don't think you'll find something that runs natively on linux. Maybe you could try running Macromedia software under Wine?
2009-01-11T05:36:00.000Z	Uplink	tiyowan	yea i heard macromedia runs fine under wine
2009-01-11T05:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	Uplink	If you could hang on, I'll dig up the relevant link for Wine.
