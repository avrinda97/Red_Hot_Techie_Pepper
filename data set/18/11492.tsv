2006-12-09T09:55:00.000Z	dfcarney		How does one enter 'expert mode' when installing Ubuntu?
2006-12-09T09:55:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	dfcarney	there is none. though, there is an alternate cli install cd for advanced installs
2006-12-09T09:56:00.000Z	dfcarney	nolimitsoya	thanks also.
2006-12-09T11:07:00.000Z	dfcarney	nolimitsoya	it seems as if the version of glib2 packaged with Dapper is 2.0
2006-12-09T11:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	dfcarney	im using edgy
2006-12-09T11:08:00.000Z	dfcarney	nolimitsoya	yeah, but i'm willing to bet that Edgy uses 2.0 also :)
2006-12-09T11:09:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	dfcarney	how do i check?
2006-12-09T11:09:00.000Z	dfcarney	nolimitsoya	i'm trying to look into that myself right now :)

2006-12-16T10:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	dfcarney	ubuntu has all the tools, but they arent configured
