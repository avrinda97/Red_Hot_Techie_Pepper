2008-12-07T16:54:00.000Z	mrwes		cannon: sudo apt-get install open-server sshfs
2008-12-07T16:55:00.000Z	mrwes		ahh..my bad
2008-12-07T16:57:00.000Z	mrwes		hrmm
2008-12-07T16:58:00.000Z	mrwes		ciao amigo mio
2008-12-07T16:58:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	yes. The one with >90% market share as well.
2008-12-07T16:59:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	I didn't realize that, I installed openssh, didn't realize I could ssh without it
2008-12-07T16:59:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	client is available by default, openssh-server is like the first thing I install on all hosts anyway as it is rather useful :)
2008-12-07T17:08:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	so the best way to go from a linux box to windows is via samba?
2008-12-07T17:09:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	huh? Well, that's the only protocol those will have enabled more-or-less by default...
2008-12-07T17:10:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	is there anyway to make openssh connect on bootup/startup?
2008-12-07T17:11:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	sure, but what exactly would you like to do with it?
2008-12-07T17:11:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	just so I don't have to manually connect, say my laptop to the desktop
2008-12-07T17:12:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	umm... talking about sshfs showing the dirs as mounted folders?
2008-12-07T17:13:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	, yah...they show when I connect manually, but is there a way to make that happen on boot up or startup
2008-12-07T17:13:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	think so... or you can remove password prompts by using (unencrypted) private keys
2008-12-07T17:14:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	and I edited the config file so I can just connect to Bill's desktop and added it as a bookmark. Guess that's easy enough
2008-12-07T17:15:00.000Z	nonix4	mrwes	if you ssh-keygen a keypair and press enter when it asks for a passphrase, you can copy the public key to the destination host and then access it without typing a password
2008-12-07T17:16:00.000Z	mrwes	nonix4	ahh...ok I got it
