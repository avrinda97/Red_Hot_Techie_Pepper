2008-05-15T21:46:00.000Z	Zombocom		and vlt do you have grub installed
2008-05-15T21:47:00.000Z	Zombocom		I seriously need help guys
2008-05-15T21:47:00.000Z	Zombocom		the package list is broken
2008-05-15T21:47:00.000Z	Zombocom		like synaptic updated the list of packages to nothing
2008-05-15T21:48:00.000Z	Zombocom		ah vlt there is a chance when editing the ntfs partition that it gets damaged
2008-05-15T21:48:00.000Z	Kl4m	Zombocom	did you filter the package list?
2008-05-15T21:48:00.000Z	Zombocom	Kl4m	no clue what that means
2008-05-15T21:49:00.000Z	Kl4m	Zombocom	in synaptic there are buttons bottom left to filter the packages by state
2008-05-15T21:51:00.000Z	Zombocom	Kl4m	douye: this is the error message I recieve when trying to update the package list: http://pastebin.ca/1019187
2008-05-15T21:53:00.000Z	Kl4m	Zombocom	Maybe synaptic/apt uses a proxy. Check the network tab in preferences if you want to connect directly
2008-05-15T21:54:00.000Z	Zombocom	Kl4m	it says direct connection, I can take a screenshot and everything
2008-05-15T21:55:00.000Z	Zombocom	Kl4m	this happened last time I tried to install anon-proxy too
2008-05-15T21:55:00.000Z	Zombocom	Kl4m	anon-proxy changes some setting somewhere where I don't know where it is to direct apt through localhost, then the program just doesn't work, I just tried uninstalling it to restore the original settings but nothing was fixed and I think I'm in a worse situation as a result
2008-05-15T21:59:00.000Z	Kl4m	Zombocom	would you have a file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d related to your whatever proxy?
2008-05-15T22:00:00.000Z	Zombocom	Kl4m	I don't see anything with the word proxy in it in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d
