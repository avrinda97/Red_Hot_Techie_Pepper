2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		anybody here know of any bugs with ubuntu and ext3?
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		I'm trying to mount this ext3 drive
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		but it won't give me read/write
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		and I can't change permissions
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		despite being root
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		well, I'm root, and it won't let me change pemissions
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		it puts me as root
2005-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	godzuki		I know how to be root.
2005-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	godzuki		a -R
2005-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	use sudo, the root account is disabled in ubuntu (and enabling it causes problems, too)
2005-12-30T13:03:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	please read the /topic (and dont paste in here)
2005-12-30T13:27:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	both steps are unnecessary, the installing user gets sudo privs automatically, there is no root account by default
2005-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	in kde, you dont use sudo for gui things, you use kdesu
2005-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	godzuki	johndarkhorse	I'm just trying to chmod and chown
2005-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	opening gui things using sudo leads to your permissions being mangled
2005-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	godzuki	johndarkhorse	it's totally hosed
2005-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	use gksudo in gnome and kdesu in kde to open gui things as superuser
2005-12-30T16:12:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	godzuki	please don't advise that
