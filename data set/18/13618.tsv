2010-08-17T05:22:00.000Z	C_Okie		Is OS made so it works well with partiioning unlike windows where systems files ( DLL hell - my fucking opengl drivers , DX SDL apps etc) and docs and settings arer stored
2010-08-17T05:22:00.000Z	C_Okie		It has a /home dir
2010-08-17T05:23:00.000Z	C_Okie		sorry

2010-08-17T05:24:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	?
2010-08-17T05:25:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	I dont use windows
2010-08-17T05:25:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	but no, linux doesnt suffer from it. and neither does a properly managed windows system
2010-08-17T05:25:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	now stop trolling and run along
2010-08-17T05:27:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	if you keep installing stuff, sure, you will use more space
2010-08-17T05:27:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	linux doesnt store dlls in applications directories like windows though. it has a sensible naming scheme for shared libraries
2010-08-17T05:29:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	eh ?
2010-08-17T05:29:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	user files have nothing to do with OS files
2010-08-17T05:31:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	you can have anything on any partition in linux
2010-08-17T05:32:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	you can simply mount or create symbolic links to point at different directories if you want to move things onto a different partition
2010-08-17T05:34:00.000Z	linxeh	C_Okie	you can mount filesystems this way in Windows too btw (in recent versions anyway)
