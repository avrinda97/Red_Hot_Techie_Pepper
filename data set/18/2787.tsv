2010-05-20T14:45:00.000Z	madjoe		hi, is there ann app, or a script I could use to backup all of my files and settings on Karmic before I replace it with Lucid?
2010-05-20T14:46:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	dd
2010-05-20T14:46:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	dd?
2010-05-20T14:47:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	dd will backup one hard drive to an identical drive.  That is the best backup, but there are lots of options short of that.
2010-05-20T14:48:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	the only catch is, I'm using wubi on Karmic and would like to delete all and install Lucid on a dedicated partition with options from Karmic and my files as well... will dd help me in that case?
2010-05-20T14:48:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	not really
2010-05-20T14:50:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	you could tar and gzip your home directory on the wubi install.  Install Karmic on the partition with the same user name and restore the tar and gzipped home directory.  Then upgrade it to Lucid.
2010-05-20T14:52:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	I have a friend who said he's not so keen to upgrade his system, he prefers a clean installation... well, I don't know what to think now... do you think it's ok to upgrade to Lucid? is there any difference with a clean installation at all?
2010-05-20T14:54:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	There are differences, but not huge ones.  I normally do fresh installs, but I upgraded a karmic machine to Lucid two days ago.  It got an error or two during the upgrade, but everything works.  Ubuntu is one of the best Linux distros about handling upgrades.
2010-05-20T14:57:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	you probably only need your home directory and maybe a little more.
2010-05-20T14:57:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	yeah, I have lots of stuff in /var/www/ the apache2 and stuff... I changed some system fonts, and some less important things
2010-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	some of that stuff changes between releases and you are better off just reapplying the changes.  I depends on what it is.  I think the /var/www should be ok.  Apache did not change much between these releases, I think.
2010-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	oh, another question... since I have a dual boot now, 1) Win XP on C: and 2) Ubuntu Karmic on D:, can I format C: and install Ubuntu Lucid instead of Win XP? Will my Karmic still work with wubi? I guess not...
2010-05-20T15:00:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	So, Windows would be gone from the machine now.  Wubi is a windows program that boots a windows file as a linux filesystem.  It needs Windows.
2010-05-20T15:00:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	that's what I thought... thanks
2010-05-20T15:01:00.000Z	Severian	madjoe	Your current problem is why I almost always try to talk people out of using wubi.
2010-05-20T15:02:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	that was my first use of Linux, and I needed a test drive
2010-05-20T15:05:00.000Z	madjoe	Severian	after 5 months of use, now it became my primary OS, so I would like to stick with it... I don't mind doing the setup all again with the fresh install of Lucid, as long as my old data are saved... I played with Karmic and probably made a lot of crap and unnecessary installations, but with Lucid I'll know exactly what to do and how to do it.. I think. :)
