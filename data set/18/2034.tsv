2011-12-23T07:19:00.000Z	lduros		hello, i install open-ssh on an ubuntu laptop using wireless. the local address is 192.168.1.110, but when I try ssh 192.168.1.110 I get: No route to host from another laptop
2011-12-23T07:19:00.000Z	lduros		is there anything to do for this to work when using wireless?
2011-12-23T07:20:00.000Z	lduros		I should mention I can't find the laptop when running nmap -sP 192.168.1.* -- but I check ifconfig from the laptop (ssh server) and it is 114
2011-12-23T07:20:00.000Z	lduros		110 sorry
2011-12-23T07:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	lduros	 Can the other machines ping the linux box?  can it ping them? Can it ssh to itself?
2011-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	it can ssh to itself, I cannot ping it from my other latop. it says Destination Host Unreachable
2011-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	lduros	 sounding almost like some firewall on the pc, or router.
2011-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	would there be some firewall with ubuntu when using wireless?
2011-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	i've used some computers here using ethernet for ssh servers and it worked fine
2011-12-23T07:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	lduros	 if you set one up, there shouldent be any rules by default.
2011-12-23T07:22:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	right, so I wouldn't think there is anything preventing that, except maybe the router
2011-12-23T07:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	lduros	 whats the other pc you are sshing from? window?linux?
2011-12-23T07:23:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	debian to be more precise
2011-12-23T07:23:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	nope
2011-12-23T07:24:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	ok thanks:-) it's some kind of linksys router, i"ll have to check the model
2011-12-23T07:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	lduros	 my router has a 'guest' wireless network and a normal network feature also.
2011-12-23T07:28:00.000Z	lduros	dr_willis	plugged the ubuntu laptop (ssh server) to ethernet, and now I can see it using nmap with the other laptop
2011-12-23T07:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	lduros	 on my wirleess router - the windows config tool has some settings i cant find in the routers web interface... which is VERY annoying.,.,
