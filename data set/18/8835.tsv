2009-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I stand corrected
2009-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	rabidweezle		^_^
2009-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	rabidweezle		hey, someone wanna help me on this samba sharing to an xp laptop? I got the workgroup setup, now it's complaining about permissions on the windows side
2009-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	rabidweezle		yeah
2009-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	rabidweezle		read that
2009-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I got it on the right workgroup now
2009-02-19T12:13:00.000Z	rabidweezle		other way around, I'm sharing to a windows xp, not from
2009-02-19T12:13:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I can get the windows share easy
2009-02-19T12:13:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I can see the share on the network under network neighborhood, but it tells me something about permissions
2009-02-19T12:14:00.000Z	rabidweezle		network places rather
2009-02-19T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	rabidweezle	yeah, check those URLs that ubottu just pointed out, lots of good reading there and it can help you - #samba too
2009-09-18T06:26:00.000Z	Gnea	rabidweezle	if it's gnome-based, I try to avoid it :)
2009-09-18T06:26:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Gnea	Actually, that was very usefull
2009-09-18T06:26:00.000Z	Gnea	rabidweezle	what was? the gnome-ppp?
2009-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Gnea	I use kubuntu, and kde4 doesn't work on my ppp connection, according to ubottu there, knetworkmanager blocks it
2009-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	Gnea	rabidweezle	that's weird. permission issue perhaps?
2009-09-18T06:28:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Gnea	dunno, I just need to kill KNetworkManager it looks according to the bot
2009-09-18T06:31:00.000Z	Gnea	rabidweezle	not sure on that one
