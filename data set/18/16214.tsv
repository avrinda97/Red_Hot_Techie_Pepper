2004-10-31T09:30:00.000Z	sertmann		he
2004-10-31T09:30:00.000Z	sertmann		:)
2004-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	sertmann		they're not sorted alphabetically even though i set the directory to do that...
2004-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	sertmann		and all other files are
2004-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	sertmann		nani=
2004-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	sertmann		mmm
2004-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	sertmann		and after
2004-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	sertmann		yeah
2004-10-31T09:32:00.000Z	sertmann		but, im pretty sure the rest of my files are not acting like that... i'll have to check....
2004-10-31T09:33:00.000Z	sertmann		if that's the explanation.... then, damn that's annoying...
2004-10-31T09:34:00.000Z	scotth	sertmann	how does ls sort them?
2004-10-31T09:35:00.000Z	sertmann	scotth	unu momento
2004-10-31T09:37:00.000Z	sertmann	scotth	ls messes up too
2004-10-31T09:39:00.000Z	scotth	sertmann	its probably something wrong with the c library, most likely a locales problem... ie the locales not being set properly... so I would say its not a gnome problem, kinda an ubuntu problem
2004-10-31T09:39:00.000Z	sertmann	scotth	isn't converting mp3 to ogg utterly pointless?
2004-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	scotth	sertmann	yes, but if you start with ogg your a lot better off... atleast in my opinion
2004-10-31T09:43:00.000Z	scotth	sertmann	possibly
2004-10-31T09:44:00.000Z	sertmann	scotth	now how would i go about changing chartset in console?
