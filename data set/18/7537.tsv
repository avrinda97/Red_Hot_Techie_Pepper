2008-04-25T16:06:00.000Z	amerio	obnibolongo	so disabling VP6 would make my wireless work?
2008-04-25T16:07:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	I don't know, I though you'd asked how to disable IPv6, I told you how, I didn't know what was leading to it, sorry
2008-04-25T16:09:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	well, which wireless card do you have?
2008-04-25T16:10:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	ouch...
2008-04-25T16:10:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	don't know, I had problems with an atheros a while ago, checking which one was
2008-04-25T16:12:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	first of all, let me warn you, I told you that thing about IPv6 by mistake, I suppose I used the tab completion with the wrong nick ^^but anyway, I'll try to help you
2008-04-25T16:13:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	wait a minute or so
2008-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	you had it working before how? ndiswrapper?
2008-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	which driver?
2008-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	out-of-the-box?
2008-04-25T16:20:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	well... use forums or google for it, it's the best I can say you... Use http://www.savagehamsters.com/?p=55 for a quickstart
2008-04-25T16:22:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	can't tell you without having messed with that Atheros in particular more... Which I haven't :) (a firend of mine had that wireless card and I gave up trying to make it work on 7.10 :P)
2008-04-25T16:22:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	Google, Forums, and you'll find something. The page I told you had windows drivers which worked well with ndiswrapper :)
2008-04-25T16:22:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	good luck :)
2008-04-25T16:23:00.000Z	obnibolongo	amerio	:)
