2009-06-20T03:14:00.000Z	mattis		I just installed sun-java6-jre but I have no 'java' on my path. Any ideas?
2009-06-20T03:14:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	What are you trying to do?
2009-06-20T03:15:00.000Z	mattis	usr13	I want to run a jar file, java -jar 'somejarfile.jar'
2009-06-20T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	/usr/bin/java -jar 'somefile.jar'
2009-06-20T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	which java
2009-06-20T03:17:00.000Z	mattis	usr13	that's the problem, there's no java on the path.
2009-06-20T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	Why is that a problem?
2009-06-20T03:18:00.000Z	mattis	usr13	because I installed the package 'sun-java6-jre' and would expect it to be on the path
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	mattis	usr13	there is no java binary in /usr/bin
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	I think you can just add to path:  PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	which java
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	which sun-java6-jre
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	mattis	usr13	which java shows a blank line
2009-06-20T03:21:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	But I think it is just java
2009-06-20T03:21:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	/usr/bin/java -jar 'somefile.jar'
2009-06-20T03:22:00.000Z	mattis	usr13	thanks for your help, but I don't think you understand the problem. I have installed the package 'sun-java6-jre' which should place the 'java' binary in /usr/bin/java. It's not there.
2009-06-20T03:22:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	THen it is improperly installed.
2009-06-20T03:22:00.000Z	usr13	mattis	Or the install is incomplete.
