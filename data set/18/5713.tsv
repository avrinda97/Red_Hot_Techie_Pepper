2008-10-16T05:49:00.000Z	blak		I just felt 22 updates seemed lik ea lot and i know the linux headers and image etc. is ver important.. didnt want to have some error in my update lists or something... seemed like i just downloaded those when i installed ubuntu recently
2008-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	blak		is it going to be chaos when Intrepid is officially released, or is it pretty much working great for people by now?
2008-10-16T05:53:00.000Z	blak		So this linux-restricted-modules update of 18.6 MB .. why is there so much extra being added exactly? seems like a lot
2008-10-16T05:54:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	its not being added, its being reinstalled
2008-10-16T05:55:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	ah ok, so if it has installed in package manager it is meaning reinstalled with minor chnages making it proper... and then the updates are also uninstalling and getting replaced with their minor chnages?
2008-10-16T05:56:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	yeah, its not like windows, where only the changes are downloaded yet.  In the linux world, things just get reinstalled.  There are hopes that that changes one day...  but so far, no one has implemented that
2008-10-16T05:57:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	thanks so much for that info, i was really confused by that... so everything is always uninstalld and fresh new install of updated files or it is just installed first time with latest
2008-10-16T05:58:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	I dont follow
2008-10-16T05:59:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	have you ever edited menu.lst manually?  If so, I would back it up before having it replaced
2008-10-16T06:02:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	thank you so much for your help on all these issues!
2008-10-16T06:03:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	np
2008-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	so is it normal now that this wants me to restart?
2008-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	this update i guess that occured to proper in the past day or so?
2008-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	yes
2008-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	ok thanks, rebootin i guess then :P thank you and good night :P
2008-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	oh yea, this is because it effects the kernel right... nothing else ever requires reboot right?
2008-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	blak	incorrect, other things can trigger the request for a reboot.  But, I don't know much about which really need a reboot, and which don't.  I generally just reboot
2008-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	blak	danbh_intrepid	oh ok thanks then, and goodnight for real this time :P
