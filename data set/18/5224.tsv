2008-11-26T23:33:00.000Z	azharcs		Hi, Can anyone tell me a good virtualization software for Ubuntu 8.04, I am currently thinking of installing VirtualBox, Can someone tell me, should i go with Xen or VMware or VirtualBox is good enough.
2008-11-26T23:33:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	what do you want to accomplish with the vm?
2008-11-26T23:34:00.000Z	azharcs	snuitje	Just cross platform testing as well need to install softwares like Autocad and Photoshop CS3
2008-11-26T23:35:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	those are very demanding apps, i can recommend using either qemu with kvm support of you have the right cpu, or vmware
2008-11-26T23:35:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	xen _could_ work as well with kvm, it has been used to boot windows, but i guess qemu and vmware are easier :)
2008-11-26T23:36:00.000Z	azharcs	snuitje	: Do you recommend not to install VirtualBox.
2008-11-26T23:37:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	well i don't really like virtualbox that much, vmware has more features and performs well
2008-11-26T23:38:00.000Z	azharcs	snuitje	: Isn't vmware a paid software.
2008-11-26T23:38:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	vmware-server, vmware-esx and vmware-player aren't
2008-11-26T23:38:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	vmware-workstation and vmware-virtualcenter can be renewed every 30 days by requesting a new trial key ^^
2008-11-26T23:39:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	http://www.easyvmx.com/ this can get you a vm for vmware player
2008-11-26T23:40:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	lsilogic scsi performs best, but for winxp you'll need a driver disk, it's all in the guest os install guide, google it you'll find lots of info ;)
2008-11-26T23:41:00.000Z	azharcs	snuitje	: Thanks, will read all the info, hope it is easy. Does it work in AMD_64 as well
2008-11-26T23:41:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	yes, and you can get a 64 bit vm, with smp too iirc
2008-11-26T23:45:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	btw i meant to tell you about vmware forum, scheize
2008-11-26T23:45:00.000Z	azharcs	snuitje	: you mean vmwareforum.org
2008-11-26T23:49:00.000Z	snuitje	azharcs	you could try that, or vmtn, which you can find here http://communities.vmware.com/home.jspa
2008-11-26T23:50:00.000Z	azharcs	snuitje	Thanks will check it out
