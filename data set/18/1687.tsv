2010-12-23T23:58:00.000Z	Tukano		good evening, any idea how to fix boot, if you have 2 main partitions, windows and ubuntu, to get windows partition to work again?
2010-12-23T23:59:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	in which order did you install Windows and Ubuntu?
2010-12-23T23:59:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	windows 7 first
2010-12-24T00:00:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	then do like Sandifordd said.  You should have an entry to boot into Windows when you boot.  Aren't you getting that?
2010-12-24T00:01:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	In menu i got: ubuntu, memory test, and windows 7 (loader) (on dev/sda1)
2010-12-24T00:02:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	I get back to the same grub
2010-12-24T00:03:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	if you have enough time I would do it all over again.. instaling Windows first then Ubuntu.  Install grub ob the MBR not on a partition.
2010-12-24T00:03:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	any chance to fix it somehow? I can see all disks from ubuntu
2010-12-24T00:05:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	personally I don't have experience with Win 7 (yet).  But you could boot with Win 7 disk and let it fix the system for you.  But it will definitely mess up your MBR.
2010-12-24T00:05:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	I suppose you could then use Ubuntu disk afterwards to reinstall Grub.
2010-12-24T00:06:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	I think i installed grub on windows 7 boot partition :s
2010-12-24T00:06:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	yes, I agree.  Win 7 boot disk should be able to fix that bit.
2010-12-24T00:07:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	no way to edit boot somehow and get it to work?
2010-12-24T00:08:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	your MBR is fine since you get grub to stage 1 but when you select the menu option for Win 7 it tries to pass on control for booting to Windows' loader which has been overwritten (I think)
2010-12-24T00:09:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	and that's not something you can correct by any config file edit
2010-12-24T00:09:00.000Z	Tukano	zms	gonna try to fix it
2010-12-24T00:10:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	first fixing Win 7 by a boot disk, and then fixing MBR by a Ubuntu disk is the only way I see short of reinstalling both Win 7 and Ubuntu.
2010-12-24T00:11:00.000Z	zms	Tukano	you could try and get a second opinion from someone like Sandifordd...
