2005-06-10T16:23:00.000Z	hussam		where do I obtain the app gmake from?
2005-06-10T16:24:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	"GNU Make" :)
2005-06-10T16:24:00.000Z	hussam	toresbe	so I apt-get what?
2005-06-10T16:25:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	You should get that, and all other nessecary utilities to compile, with the package "build-essential"
2005-06-10T16:26:00.000Z	hussam	toresbe	I already have "build-essential" but it has make. Is that the same as gmake?
2005-06-10T16:26:00.000Z	toresbe		yep
2005-06-10T16:27:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	"gmake" is used to differentiate between different makes on systems who has them
2005-06-10T16:27:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	ie BSD
2005-06-10T16:27:00.000Z	hussam	toresbe	here http://www.mozilla.org/build/make-build.html , it says gmake. so I should run "make" instead of "gmake"?
2005-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	toresbe		uhm
2005-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	toresbe		why are you building mozilla?!
2005-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	hussam	toresbe	for fun :)
2005-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	oh dear, a masochist ;)
2005-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	toresbe		but yes, "make" is the word.
2005-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	hussam	toresbe	ok thanks :)
2005-06-10T16:29:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	no problem :)
2005-06-10T16:29:00.000Z	toresbe	hussam	have fun...er, looking at... endless lines of gcc output... :P
2005-06-10T16:29:00.000Z	hussam	toresbe	indeed lol
