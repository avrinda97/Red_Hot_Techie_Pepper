2008-07-13T01:10:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx		Only thingi can do is Wubi lol
2008-07-13T01:11:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx		I did and i installed it into my external hard drive, but when i go to boot up, i select ubuntu, then it fails and brings me to a command line
2008-07-13T01:13:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx		 i installed ubuntu from wubi into my external hard drive, but when i go to boot up, i select ubuntu, then it fails and brings me to a command line, how do i boot from my external hard drive?
2008-07-13T01:14:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	what kind of command line... becuase if it brings you to a command line it sounds like booting succeeded to me
2008-07-13T01:19:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	yes?
2008-07-13T01:19:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	no, this is a fast channel, if you don't see my name I won't hear you
2008-07-13T01:19:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	see = say
2008-07-13T01:21:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	ok, well you didn't mention an error message before. What file can it not find. And again, please say my name if you are talking to me (with every message) or I will likely miss it.
2008-07-13T01:22:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	sunc	ill have to reboot ill be back in like 5 minutes lol...........
2008-07-13T01:27:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	well that would make it exceedingly hard to boot from it I suppose
2008-07-13T01:27:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	sunc	exactly..
2008-07-13T01:30:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	sunc	al i did was install ubuntu from wubi, i expect i would have to move some files to make iot boot right?
2008-07-13T01:30:00.000Z	sunc	xxschwartzxx	no idea
2008-07-13T01:30:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	sunc	yay im so happy...
