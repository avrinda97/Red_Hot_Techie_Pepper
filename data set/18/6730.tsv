2008-05-02T10:46:00.000Z	ebaad		Hi I just installed the new version of ubuntu and when in terminal window I enter sudo it says that unable to resolve host......any ideas
2008-05-02T10:47:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	I've heard of that error before.
2008-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sudo/+bug/32906  It's a bug scheduled to be fixed...
2008-05-02T10:49:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	can't sudo due to bug 32906
2008-05-02T10:52:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	you still there?
2008-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	It looks like you need to add 127.0.0.1 your-computer-name into /etc/hosts
2008-05-02T10:56:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	Can you access the terminal?
2008-05-02T10:58:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	absolutely confirm that typing 'sudo nano' does it not let you enter your password due to the hostname problem.
2008-05-02T10:59:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	Let's try a few other oddball methods, even though none of them should work, apparently they worked for the bug testers at some point.
2008-05-02T11:00:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	start aptitude from the terminal.  It recognises mouse input, use that to go to Actions -> Become root
2008-05-02T11:01:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	any luck from aptitude?
2008-05-02T11:05:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	are you running kubuntu?
2008-05-02T11:06:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	You still have the root console open, right?
2008-05-02T11:08:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	just enter the command nano      All the commands are with ^ being Ctrl
2008-05-02T11:09:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	one sec
2008-05-02T11:13:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	sounds like it
2008-05-02T11:17:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	You'll need to make the edits anyways in the recovery console
2008-05-02T11:17:00.000Z	patifa	ebaad	Did the hostname command not work?
