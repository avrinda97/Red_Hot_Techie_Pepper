2008-08-14T11:11:00.000Z	lostogre	Phipho	what technology does it use to make the connection? DSL, T1, etc.
2008-08-14T11:13:00.000Z	lostogre	Phipho	if it is DSL, there is no good way to get max speed from your connection. It is a limitation of the technology itself.
2008-08-14T11:14:00.000Z	Phipho	lostogre	nothing other choice for tune my speed
2008-08-14T11:15:00.000Z	lostogre	Phipho	Without knowing all of the details of you situation there is no way to know for sure, but I don't think so.
