2008-02-17T03:52:00.000Z	smayes3	iKap	have you opened up System Monitor and checked for a program eating up your resources ... force quit it
2008-02-17T03:53:00.000Z	iKap	smayes3	when i add any type of app to the panel the icon doesnt show up.. they are invisible.
2008-02-17T03:53:00.000Z	smayes3	iKap	make sure you don't have the entire panel taken up by the Windows applet
2008-02-17T03:54:00.000Z	iKap	smayes3	gnome-panel is tkaing up 9.0mb in system monitor
2008-02-17T03:55:00.000Z	iKap	smayes3	can i just add a new panel and not worry about this?
2008-02-17T03:56:00.000Z	smayes3	iKap	there's a way of restarting the gnome-panel ... very simple ... but I can't remember ... have you tried deleting the panels then readding them
2008-02-17T03:56:00.000Z	iKap	smayes3	i removed the icons on panel and readded but icons dont show up.. nor do the ones already there go away..  is there a way to just create a new panel?
2008-02-17T03:57:00.000Z	smayes3	iKap	right click on panel and choose delet panel or new panel
2008-02-17T03:59:00.000Z	iKap	smayes3	how do i add the network thing back on.. the thing that shows wireless connections avail.. and how im connected.. etc.
2008-02-17T04:00:00.000Z	smayes3	iKap	right click on a panel and choose "Add to Panel" ... you'll find all the panel applets there ... you're looking for notification area applet
2008-02-17T04:00:00.000Z	iKap	smayes3	yeah i got it, but iti still wont show the network thing.
2008-02-17T04:03:00.000Z	smayes3	iKap	try running this in a terminal: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
