2007-11-27T11:11:00.000Z	terrorxs		can someone please freakin help me, ive asked my question like 6 times now.
2007-11-27T11:12:00.000Z	terrorxs		if nobody knows this, then this distro is definately sol.
2007-11-27T11:12:00.000Z	terrorxs		all I did was mess up the config of xwindows. how do I revert it back to the defaults?
2007-11-27T11:12:00.000Z	terrorxs		thats all I have been asking.
2007-11-27T11:13:00.000Z	terrorxs		well, I didnt know where xorg.conf was until it was messed up. nor did I think xwin would crash on a simple thing like extending my desktop to a second monitor
2007-11-27T11:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	terrorxs	you're out of luck when you go messing with system files as root without making backups or knowing what you're doing.
2007-11-27T11:15:00.000Z	terrorxs		I have patience, but I would thing after asking my question for the past hour someone would help. :(
2007-11-27T11:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		(Drama on IRC doesn't help, either)
2007-11-27T11:15:00.000Z	terrorxs	BHSPitMonkey	did you read my problem. I wasnt messing with system files, i was in the display setting on xwin.
2007-11-27T11:15:00.000Z	terrorxs		ugh.
2007-11-27T11:16:00.000Z	terrorxs		!FixRes
2007-11-27T11:16:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	terrorxs	no, I just joined a couple minutes ago.  Ubuntu doesn't ship with a settings applet by that name.
2007-11-27T11:17:00.000Z	terrorxs		If you dont understand my question, or anybodies for the matter, it would be helpful to me, to ask me to rephrase it. :( instead of feeling ignored.
2007-11-27T11:18:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	terrorxs	do note that the people in here who answer questions are volunteering their spare time to do so.  Please consider that while choosing how to approach getting help in here.
2007-11-27T11:18:00.000Z	terrorxs		that answer didnt fix it. But I figure I'll give it another hour on my own. if not, back to windows for me.
2007-11-27T11:20:00.000Z	terrorxs		amason, I do thank you for your help. I just get frustrated when I get ignored for an hour, then it takes me to show im a bit peeved to get a response from people.
2007-11-27T11:20:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		Again, being a drama queen doesn't help.  Most of us really don't care what you choose to use, so threatening to leave is neither reputable nor effective.
2007-11-27T11:22:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	terrorxs	there are 1118 nicks in this channel as of writing.  Very few of them are advanced, long-time linux users.  What exactly is your threshold for being "ignored"?
