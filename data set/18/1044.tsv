2011-06-20T20:01:00.000Z	mosmo	dr_willis	I can't seem to enter the GRUB settings on boot, neither with pressing shift nor ESC
2011-06-20T20:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 ive had quirky desktop systems taht grub would not properly work with a USB keyboard. but would with a PS2 keyvoard..  there  a legacy-usb setting the bios that might fix that.
2011-06-20T20:04:00.000Z	mosmo	dr_willis	I'm trying to manually edit the grub.cfg with nano now
2011-06-20T20:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 thats one way.. not a great way.. but a way
2011-06-20T20:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 replace 'quiet splash' with 'text'
2011-06-20T20:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 the proper way is edit the /etc/default/grub then rerun update-grub
2011-06-20T20:08:00.000Z	mosmo	dr_willis	I see, thanks - I'm trying if it works and then I'll do it the proper way
2011-06-20T20:12:00.000Z	mosmo	dr_willis	Stuff went wrong apparently
2011-06-20T20:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 that means grub is sending info that the monitor cant handle.
2011-06-20T20:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 i have to tell grub to use a 640x480 res screen here for this monitor.. heres my grub.cfg

2011-06-20T20:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 that makes it even easier....
2011-06-20T20:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 edit /etc/default/grub and uncomment the 640x480 line, uncomment the 'make a sound beep' line also so you can hear it beep so you know it booted if it dosent work. :) and run update-grub
2011-06-20T20:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 sounds like   the framebuffer/plymouth stuff is causing problems  once again.
2011-06-20T20:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 enable the text menu for grub. and  remove the 'quiet splash'  words in the /etc/default/grub
2011-06-20T20:27:00.000Z	mosmo	dr_willis	I did as you said and edited the /default/grub file
2011-06-20T20:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 dont forget to run update-grub after editing..
2011-06-20T20:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	mosmo	 in /etc/default/grub --->    GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480   and   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text" is about as low-tech/should alwasy work.. as you can get...
