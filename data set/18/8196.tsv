2007-09-26T07:45:00.000Z	kwilliam		Is there a channel specifically for partitioning trouble?  I'm having all sorts of troubles.
2007-09-26T07:46:00.000Z	kwilliam		I'm getting a "The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 filesystem. " error from fsck.
2007-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	kwilliam		How do I fix the partition so I can boot my computer again?  Any ideas?
2007-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	kennobaka	kwilliam	`fsck -r $drive` is repair mode
2007-09-26T07:48:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	that didn't help.
2007-09-26T07:48:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	still error about super block.
2007-09-26T07:48:00.000Z	kennobaka		I'm not sure the magic options to make it restore from another block (or if that's just a ufs thing)
2007-09-26T07:49:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	Well, I need to restore it somehow.
2007-09-26T07:49:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	I can mount the partitions, but I can't boot for some reason.
2007-09-26T07:50:00.000Z	kennobaka		is the partition marked as bootable?
2007-09-26T07:50:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	I don't know.  Gparted hangs every time I try to run it.
2007-09-26T07:50:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	Is there another way to find out beside gparted?
2007-09-26T07:50:00.000Z	kennobaka	kwilliam	tried using parted?
2007-09-26T07:51:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	no, but I'll give that a shot.  (I didn't know about it)
2007-09-26T07:53:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	No, it doesn't appear to have a boot flag, for one thing.
2007-09-26T07:55:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	Alright, I've set the boot flag, but that won't fix the superblock problem will it?
2007-09-26T07:55:00.000Z	kennobaka	kwilliam	I doubt it, but if there were a superblock error, I don't think it would let you mount
2007-09-26T07:56:00.000Z	kwilliam	kennobaka	hmm, maybe it's a false alarm, or a wrong command or something.
