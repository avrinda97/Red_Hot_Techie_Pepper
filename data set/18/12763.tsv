2006-03-28T14:20:00.000Z	schnable		hi, i need to install ubuntu on a rackmont machine that has no cdrom or floppy. it currently has freebsd on it.  any suggestions?
2006-03-28T14:21:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	couple options: debootsrap from existing linux, network boot, hmm...
2006-03-28T14:22:00.000Z	schnable	oskude	what do you mean by debootstrap? is that where i download vmlinuz from the installer and set my loader to load it?
2006-03-28T14:24:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	i only did this once (debootstrapped a suse to debian) and i followed a howto from net, so i dont know how "compatible" that is with ubuntu
2006-03-28T14:25:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	but in all it was just making the partitions, debootstrapping the root partition, install grub and reboot (IIRC)
2006-03-28T14:26:00.000Z	schnable	oskude	sure, that makes sense, but i dont know how freebsds bootloader works
2006-03-28T14:26:00.000Z	schnable		is my problem
2006-03-28T14:26:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	well, it will/could be replaced
2006-03-28T14:27:00.000Z	schnable	oskude	do i need to set up a special server to  do a netboot install?
2006-03-28T14:27:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	yes (but i never (yet) done that)
2006-03-28T14:27:00.000Z	schnable	oskude	what is it called exactly, so i can serch the wiki
2006-03-28T14:28:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	the debian tutorial that i used, had all that you needed (script, debootstrap, etc) in one nice tar, so it was very easy
2006-03-28T14:29:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	hmm, netboot, maybe (i remember something about "tftp")
2006-03-28T14:29:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	and your NIC must support network boot !
2006-03-28T14:30:00.000Z	schnable	oskude	thanks fro the help, im going to try netinstall or usb stick installl
2006-03-28T14:31:00.000Z	oskude	schnable	both must be supported my your bios/nic
