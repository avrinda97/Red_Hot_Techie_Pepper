2008-12-03T23:01:00.000Z	inordkuo		hi all. quick question. can heavy disk i/o cause a system freeze or is it more likely a faulty hard drive?
2008-12-03T23:03:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	well, were you doing something that produced a great deal of disk i/o?
2008-12-03T23:04:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	heh heh, yeah if you're encoding and writing on a single disk, you might have some i/o waiting going on :-)
2008-12-03T23:04:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	generally not, but how long did you leave the system running? are you sure it was locked?
2008-12-03T23:18:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	sorry i didn't see your response to my question. i've left the system on for a few hours and everything stays frozen. can't ping from another machine. mouse doesn't move. keyboard is unresponsive etc. it's most definitely locked up.
2008-12-03T23:18:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	hmm. anything deposited in the system logs before the thing dies?
2008-12-03T23:20:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	but other than that no errors that tell me anything. the drive is formatted as jfs and is separate from the operating system.
2008-12-03T23:22:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	what precisely is the machine doing when it dies? or is it random?
2008-12-03T23:23:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	it is recording 4 video streams and running a mencoder process
2008-12-03T23:24:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	how much memory is this machine packing?
2008-12-03T23:24:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	1gb ram, 2gb swap, the hd i am recording to is 200gb
2008-12-03T23:25:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	how long does it take the machine to crash under this load? also, does it respond to "alt-sysrq" commands?
2008-12-03T23:25:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	i've run top while testing the machine and when it locks up i don't see significant swap or cpu usage
2008-12-03T23:26:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	i can run 4 recordings simultatneously, but as soon as i start the mencoder process, it locks up.
2008-12-03T23:26:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	does the machine spend a lot of time in i/o wait? (the "wa" index in top)
2008-12-03T23:27:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	i did not know about that. i will have to look next time i can test it.  what is "alt-sysrq"?
2008-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	sipior	inordkuo	unfortunately, i have to be going. i would say that you might try a smaller number of streams, and see if the problem persists. the computer may simply be trying unsuccessfully t o deal with the load. best of luck sorting things out!
2008-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	inordkuo	sipior	thank you
