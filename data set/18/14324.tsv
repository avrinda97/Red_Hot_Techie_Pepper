2005-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	rickity		anyone ever use "dd" to clone a drive?
2005-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	Unununium	rickity	yes, a floppy
2005-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	rickity		I have two drives that are presumably identical
2005-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	rickity		make /model /capacity
2005-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	Unununium		snackamp?
2005-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	rickity		can i just dd /dev/src /dev/backup?
2005-08-22T08:57:00.000Z	Unununium	rickity	why not use cp?
2005-08-22T08:57:00.000Z	Unununium		Wait, that won't work for "special" files (dev nodes, etc.)
2005-08-22T08:57:00.000Z	rickity	Unununium	cuz I want a verbatim clone ..down to the partition table
2005-08-22T08:57:00.000Z	rickity	Unununium	zero recovery effort
2005-08-22T08:57:00.000Z	Unununium	rickity	Yes, you can do it, but are you sure the disks have the same capacity?
2005-08-22T08:58:00.000Z	rickity	Unununium	yes..they do...wut I don't understand is how does dd handle things like bad blocks? ..or is that so low level its not a concern for "dd"?
2005-08-22T08:58:00.000Z	Unununium	rickity	you have bad blocks??
2005-08-22T08:58:00.000Z	rickity	Unununium	don't most disks?
2005-08-22T08:58:00.000Z	rickity	Unununium	they just get masked out
2005-08-22T08:59:00.000Z	Unununium	rickity	Well, if the hard disk hardware masks 'em, you won't know about it
2005-08-22T08:59:00.000Z	Unununium		So long as the OS doesn't have any trouble, dd will work for you
2005-08-22T08:59:00.000Z	rickity	Unununium	true...but i'm not sure at what level that's occurring...
