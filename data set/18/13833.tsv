2006-04-14T08:37:00.000Z	CosmoDad		I have a SVCD directory (with the EXT, MPEG2 directories, etc) which in sum is larger than 700 megs. How'd burn that onto a CD-R under Ubuntu?
2006-04-14T08:38:00.000Z	Toma-	CosmoDad	use k3b and enable overburn
2006-04-14T08:39:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	and I can assume it will not wreck my CD-RW drive?
2006-04-14T08:39:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	the directory is 743 MB in total
2006-04-14T08:39:00.000Z	Toma-	CosmoDad	have you got a 800mb cd?
2006-04-14T08:40:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	yeah I guess, it's a standard CD-R suited for 700 MB of payload data
2006-04-14T08:40:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	so I guess that's a 800mb cd including error correction and stuff?
2006-04-14T08:40:00.000Z	Toma-	CosmoDad	ahh. so its a 700mb cd?
2006-04-14T08:41:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	yes
2006-04-14T08:41:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	the label says 700 MB
2006-04-14T08:41:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	so will it still work with that?
2006-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	I know this has something to do with the 700/800 MB difference in error correction, I just never tried burning this under Linux
2006-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	but I'll try overburning
2006-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	Toma-	CosmoDad	error correcting is a gimme in most modern brning apps
2006-04-14T08:45:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	what I mean is that if you fully use a 700 MB CD-R, the burning software will add roughly 100 MB of error correction redundancy
2006-04-14T08:45:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	this redundancy is obviously already contained in my 743 megs directory
2006-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Toma-	so I have to tell the burning software: don't add error correction, it's already been done
2006-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	Toma-	CosmoDad	yep
