2007-02-11T14:33:00.000Z	CharlieChester		in "defaults" file. But symlinks still get access forbidden.
2007-02-11T14:34:00.000Z	CharlieChester		sorry
2007-02-11T14:35:00.000Z	CharlieChester		problem is that I find a difficulty in matching docs with actual files. I am not a db admin. Which config file should be updated to allow symlinks?
2007-02-11T14:35:00.000Z	CharlieChester		there appears to be a lot of config files and I dont know which have precedence.
2007-02-11T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	CharlieChester	they all do different things, none of which override each other, so none have preference.
2007-02-11T14:36:00.000Z	CharlieChester	Flannel	thanks. But which is right file for adding followsymlinks in apache2 on linux?
2007-02-11T14:37:00.000Z	Flannel	CharlieChester	er... you're editing the correct one in sites-enabled and/or sites-available, have you restarted apache?
2007-02-11T14:39:00.000Z	CharlieChester	Flannel	yes
2007-02-11T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	CharlieChester	theyre both the same file
2007-02-11T14:44:00.000Z	Flannel	CharlieChester	I haven't dabbled in apache configs in a while.  you might try asking in #apache, as there must be some other config that disables symlinks, but I can't remember it
2007-02-11T14:45:00.000Z	CharlieChester	Flannel	thanks anyway. funny thing was that I thought I was in apache. Something wierd with erc here :). CIao for now,
2007-02-11T14:45:00.000Z	Flannel	CharlieChester	oh, it could be a permission issue, I suppose
