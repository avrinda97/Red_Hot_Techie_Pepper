2009-06-29T12:33:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	So, I'm in luck. I want to try ubuntu, and I have that extra partition you  mentioned. It's a dell/compaq/hp...
2009-06-29T12:36:00.000Z	Rub	qe2eqe	no understand your question
2009-06-29T12:36:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	I plugged in a joypad, and it's not working in my game, 'the ur-quan masters'
2009-06-29T12:38:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	it's the only game I have that I can test the game pad on. How do I even know if the game pad is broken or not?
2009-06-29T12:45:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	no problem. You should paste things like that to pastebin.com. The answer I was looking for was 'cat /dev/input/js0' , and see if the the not working was a result of the software or configuration.
2009-06-29T12:45:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	I'm no good at asking questions I know the answers to
2009-06-29T12:49:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	Good luck.
2009-06-29T12:50:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	I remember an article about argentina doing something special at the government level with open source software.... and I know brazil is onto it. Just fuel for the fire.
2009-06-29T12:53:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	there is a site called pastebin.com you should learn about. It's under the umbrella of IRC etiquette.
2009-06-29T12:56:00.000Z	qe2eqe	Rub	you're welcome. Buenos Nachos. Hasta la queso.
