2008-05-30T15:14:00.000Z	hopelessguy		hi, i need help with my graphic cards driver
2008-05-30T15:15:00.000Z	hopelessguy		lspci says this is my graphig card:
2008-05-30T15:15:00.000Z	hopelessguy		lspci says this is my graphig card: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 661/741/760 PCI/AGP or 662/761Gx PCIE VGA Display Adapter
2008-05-30T15:15:00.000Z	hopelessguy		is it posible to get any drivers for that?
2008-05-30T15:16:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	probably already installed as xserver-xorg-video-sys
2008-05-30T15:16:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	no they are not, compiz says "no whitelisted driver found" and i can't change better resolution
2008-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	try X -configure and see what it makes?
2008-05-30T15:19:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	X -configure?
2008-05-30T15:19:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	my problem is resolution and compiz yes..
2008-05-30T15:26:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	i see your problem. your machine has a lack of self-confidence due to its hostname
2008-05-30T15:27:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	:o what to do? :f
2008-05-30T15:28:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	you're running as root, that may be wrong
2008-05-30T15:32:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	kwin-kde4?
2008-05-30T15:33:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	unknown as you're in kde. i use gnome
2008-05-30T15:33:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	aptitude install ubuntu-desktop and try it out; if it works at least you do know it's kde at fault and not compiz/your card
2008-05-30T15:38:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	i have tried with ubuntu, last time this morning "Desktop effects could not be enabled" :s
2008-05-30T15:38:00.000Z	rrrachel	hopelessguy	then maybe the card just can't do it
2008-05-30T15:38:00.000Z	hopelessguy	rrrachel	or i just haven't found right drivers for it if kubuntu/ubuntu doesn't include them
