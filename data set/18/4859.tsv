2009-01-26T01:24:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	wb
2009-01-26T01:24:00.000Z	danishjordan1	lackS	Thanks
2009-01-26T01:27:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	Linux has no beast -- it just doesn't treat its users like idiots ;-)
2009-01-26T01:28:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	Use whatever you like -- it's /your/ choic
2009-01-26T01:28:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	+e
2009-01-26T01:28:00.000Z	danishjordan1	lackS	it's nie to have an unbiased opinion for once ;)
2009-01-26T01:30:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	Oh, thanks. I don't want to force people into using linux. I want to force people into using what fits them best. If it's Microsoft, go for it.
2009-01-26T01:30:00.000Z	danishjordan1	lackS	For me It's dual boot.
2009-01-26T01:31:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	Me too... Frugalware (exotic distro) and XP, but I'm firing up XP every five or six weeks only
2009-01-26T01:31:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	My antivirus software is always screaming at me if I start it up :-)
2009-01-26T01:32:00.000Z	danishjordan1	lackS	I'm gonna keep ubuntu on this laptop, and dual boot XP or vista and ubuntu on my desktop
2009-01-26T01:33:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	Ok, good setup. I'm also using Ubuntu on my laptop, it just fits it quite well
2009-01-26T01:34:00.000Z	danishjordan1	lackS	This laptop has never started up so fast, I'm not gonna lie. When it had XP on it, the people using it were inexperienced. I swear it was on a botnet. Also, is there a way to see what hardware is on the laptop? Like a ubuntu version of belarc advisor? whats the terminal command?
2009-01-26T01:35:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	Go look up these things: command lspci, files /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/meminfo
2009-01-26T01:35:00.000Z	lackS	danishjordan1	I'll go smoking, brb
2009-01-26T01:47:00.000Z	danishjordan1	lackS	Are you here?
