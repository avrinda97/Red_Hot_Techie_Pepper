2007-10-13T09:23:00.000Z	saftle		hey, was just asking if with the new ubuntu 7.10 RC if they made it so ATI x1650 cards can support beryl without having to go into xgl? would love to figure out a way to have 3D acceleration running with my beryl cube. thx for the help
2007-10-13T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	no. Still xgl
2007-10-13T09:28:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	I sent you a pm, not sure if that's allowed here, sorry if it isn't.
2007-10-13T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	didn't get it (you need to be registered)
2007-10-13T09:30:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	anyway to go around it temporarily? was reading a tutorial where it would have two terminals in one, and bypass the xgl problem, but it load the game (was using neverball as an example) and would just crash after a little bit.
2007-10-13T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	not sure about that, I've played with more than on xserver but not xgl/standard
2007-10-13T09:35:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	thx for your input
2007-10-13T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	out of curiosity (might want to play a game or two myself) what's the link you are using?
2007-10-13T09:37:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	one sec, let me grab tutorial link, how do I messages directly to you that are in red? or does it just do that when you have "name:" first.
2007-10-13T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	name anywhere in the line

2007-10-13T09:45:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	blindside has left the building, :P
2007-10-13T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	and your howto, I'd change that display=:93 to display=:0 , like blindside had :)
2007-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	tried that and it still crashed the prog, :(
2007-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	know any other display settings i can try?
2007-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	nickrud	saftle	that's an old howto, it may need updates.or have updates deeper in. Don't have the inclination to read it all right now, but I've bookmarked it for later
2007-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	kk
2007-10-13T09:49:00.000Z	saftle	nickrud	know any other display=:? that I can use, not too familiar with that command, so I'm not sure what it does.
