2011-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	mikebeecham		hi there....can someone help me with a problem. If I run glxgears I am getting a steady 60fps. However, every flash website / youtube video lags very very badly
2011-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	celthunder	mikebeecham	turn off vsync what's glxgears show then
2011-06-08T23:50:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	is that in nvidia options?
2011-06-08T23:51:00.000Z	celthunder	mikebeecham	probably either that or in your xorg.conf if you have one
2011-06-08T23:51:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	sorry mate, bear with me...is that "sync to vblank"? If so...should I turn off all of them? there's a few?
2011-06-08T23:54:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	I disabled all 'sync to vblank' now I get around 2879.659 fps...but flash websites are still really laggy
2011-06-08T23:55:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	...and the gears keep stopping!
2011-06-08T23:55:00.000Z	celthunder	mikebeecham	what graphics card/driveer do you have
2011-06-08T23:55:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	nvidia 7600gt
2011-06-08T23:55:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	the driver is the standard linux driver...HOWEVER
2011-06-08T23:59:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	after disabling "sync to vblank", should I be logging out and in again?
2011-06-09T00:03:00.000Z	celthunder	mikebeecham	no logging out/in shouldn't matter...and how taxed is your video card atm?
2011-06-09T00:03:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	how can I tell mate?
2011-06-09T00:05:00.000Z	celthunder	mikebeecham	undecim i said that you can ad it it just won't mount automatically if it's not htere
2011-06-09T00:06:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	you're multitasking...I understand :D
2011-06-09T00:07:00.000Z	mikebeecham	celthunder	mate...you linked me to windows applications?
2011-06-09T00:08:00.000Z	celthunder	mikebeecham	i just googled video test
