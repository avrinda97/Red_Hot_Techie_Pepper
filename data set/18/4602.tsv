2009-03-27T23:11:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7		How do i specify the mount option for sshfs in fstab? Normally i'd add them to the mount command with -o, but in fstab i'm unsure where to put them. Do they go where the other options go as well, such as user?
2009-03-27T23:12:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS
2009-03-27T23:15:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	although the page is very useful, it does not hold the info i need i'm afraid. The folders i'm mounting are not empty as a fall back principle, thus i need to add the nonempty option to sshfs. I'm not sure where to add it, since it's not a default mounting option.
2009-03-27T23:17:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	ok. But options to mount go in the 4th field of fstab line.
2009-03-27T23:18:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	even those for sshfs? hmm ok
2009-03-27T23:18:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	well, not totally sure in this case, but you could try I guess?
2009-03-27T23:18:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	yeah i guess
2009-03-28T19:36:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	Esvandiary alec - I really would NOT recommend the force option. Mounting an uncleanly unmounted drive using force option, just "ignores" the errors in the journal
2009-03-28T19:37:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	my main reason for still recommending it, is that windows will always say it's uncleanly unmounted even after having written all the data.
2009-03-28T19:38:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	also note that since he wrote the UUID and everythign else write, this will only affect his NTFS drive. So far i have not yet heard nor read about an NTFS drive being damaged in any way with the force option.
2009-03-28T19:38:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	If your data is important to you, I really would not use the force option. Use the "safely remove external media" thingy in windows
2009-03-28T19:39:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	and i would like to ask a question in return. How would you mount a drive if you have no windows available to you?
2009-03-28T19:39:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	then i would not use ntfs in the first place to be honest.
2009-03-28T19:39:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	Ok, then you'll have to mount it forced. But my question in return, why use NTFS if you don't have windows :)
2009-03-28T19:40:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	that question would not be asked to me but to alec.
2009-03-28T19:42:00.000Z	oCean_	s3r3n1t7	Hm, yes. I'll just drop the argueing. It's just I don't like forced mounts.
2009-03-28T19:42:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	oCean_	i value your input. Thank you.
