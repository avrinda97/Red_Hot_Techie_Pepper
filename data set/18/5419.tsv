2008-10-30T08:40:00.000Z	Xpistos		How do I change my network name in hardy
2008-10-30T08:41:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	change it in /etc/hostname
2008-10-30T08:42:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	that is for the computer name not the network I am trying to join
2008-10-30T08:43:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	what are you running now?
2008-10-30T08:44:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	Hardy and this is for my Hardy server
2008-10-30T08:45:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	are you talking about the domain?
2008-10-30T08:47:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	When I try to check my network/windows network/ ... it should have only my network "Olympus" and it has that and "workgroup"
2008-10-30T08:47:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	workgroup is probably some windows system running on the same network.
2008-10-30T08:48:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	My ubuntu server is the only one listed under "Workgroup"
2008-10-30T08:49:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	guess I don't understand the problem
2008-10-30T08:50:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	not a major issue. Right Now I am having more problems getting the folders to share since it keeps telling me I don't have permissions, but I am the admin??? Oh well
2008-10-30T08:50:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	are you doing command line shares with sudo? or GUI?
2008-10-30T08:51:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	GUI
2008-10-30T08:51:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	Still feeling my way through the terminal
2008-10-30T08:52:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	I'm from the terminal days
2008-10-30T08:53:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	I would love to be able to do it from the command line. Let me ask you this. If my system has updates and I want to run the updates, what is the command line for it
2008-10-30T08:54:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Xpistos	sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-10-30T08:54:00.000Z	Xpistos	Serraphyn	Thank you sir!
