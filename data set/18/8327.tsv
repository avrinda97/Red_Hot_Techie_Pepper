2007-09-04T08:15:00.000Z	Frosteh		Seriously if anyone can  help me out, I'd really appreciate it
2007-09-04T08:16:00.000Z	ari_stress	Frosteh	what's the problem?
2007-09-04T08:17:00.000Z	Frosteh		i have an SDSL router in bridge mode, and I enter the settings from our ISP into an Ububtu 7.04 box which is connected to it, and I can't seem to reach the outside world, only other devices attached to the router
2007-09-04T08:17:00.000Z	Frosteh		yet the exact same settings work in windows XP
2007-09-04T08:18:00.000Z	Frosteh		STP?
2007-09-04T08:18:00.000Z	ari_stress	Frosteh	it could be the default gateway setting
2007-09-04T08:18:00.000Z	Frosteh		It's a Zyxel SDSL router which is set to bridge mode, using RFC1483 encapsulation
2007-09-04T08:18:00.000Z	Frosteh		I've set the default gateway to what it should be
2007-09-04T08:19:00.000Z	Frosteh		and the IP's, and the DNS, and the netmask
2007-09-04T08:20:00.000Z	ari_stress	Frosteh	check the gateway setting using route -n
2007-09-04T08:24:00.000Z	Frosteh	ari_stress	it's defo set correctly
