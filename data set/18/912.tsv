2011-10-17T19:19:00.000Z	hatchetjack		how do I get my traditional style gnome back?
2011-10-17T19:20:00.000Z	hatchetjack		right
2011-10-17T19:20:00.000Z	hatchetjack		and unity sucks and has to go
2011-10-17T19:20:00.000Z	auronandace	hatchetjack	good thing i usae xfce then
2011-10-17T19:20:00.000Z	hatchetjack		hhmmmm
2011-10-17T19:21:00.000Z	hatchetjack		I like gnome better then kde but maybe kde is not as bad as unity
2011-10-17T19:24:00.000Z	hatchetjack		why did ubuntu think up unity anyways?
2011-10-17T19:24:00.000Z	hatchetjack		other desktop GUI's not good enough or something?
2011-10-17T19:31:00.000Z	hatchetjack		okay somewhat classic gnome back
2011-10-17T19:31:00.000Z	hatchetjack		apparently I am not good enough to administer my own computer now though?
2011-10-17T19:32:00.000Z	hatchetjack		or so ubuntu's higher powers feel?
2011-10-17T19:33:00.000Z	auronandace	hatchetjack	if you are using unity blame ubuntu, if you are using gnome 3 blame the gnome devs
2011-10-17T19:34:00.000Z	hatchetjack	auronandace	actually I still blame ubuntu.
2011-10-17T19:34:00.000Z	hatchetjack	auronandace	I am trying to get away from unity and back to some normality with gnome.
2011-10-17T19:34:00.000Z	hatchetjack	auronandace	it's ubuntu's fault
2011-10-17T19:35:00.000Z	hatchetjack		I have gnome back but no system menu options and apparently aptituce install gnome-system-tools has no effect
2011-10-17T19:35:00.000Z	auronandace	hatchetjack	unity exists because ubuntu devs didn't agree with the way gnome3 was going
2011-10-17T19:36:00.000Z	hatchetjack	auronandace	just not sure why unity is being forced on me
