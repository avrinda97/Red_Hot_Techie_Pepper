2005-01-18T13:34:00.000Z	kosmonautti		And why is hotplug subsystem randomly hanging my system during boot?
2005-01-18T13:34:00.000Z	kosmonautti		Sometimes it boots and then stops working..
2005-01-18T13:34:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	maybe it doesn't like everything you hot plug into it?
2005-01-22T09:22:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	lets guess!
2005-01-22T09:22:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	what is a CMOS?
2005-01-22T09:23:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	ohh c'mon, you gotta know that!
2005-01-22T09:23:00.000Z	kosmonautti	neofeed	Yeah I know what it means when the problem is real, but when it comes to this that it only happens after flashing?
2005-01-22T09:24:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	okay I tell you: CMOS stands for Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor.
2005-01-22T09:24:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	now what does that tell us? Not much. But this: In computing the term CMOS is often used to mean the non-volatile memory that stores motherboard BIOS information. This was called the CMOS RAM or just the CMOS because it usually used a low-power CMOS memory chip, powered by a small battery. The term remains common but has become a misnomer as nearly all modern computer components except the "CMOS memory" are constructed in CMOS tec
2005-01-22T09:25:00.000Z	kosmonautti	neofeed	:D
2005-01-22T09:25:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	so THIS actually tells us all about your problem. Don't tell me you don't get it by now...
2005-01-22T09:26:00.000Z	kosmonautti	neofeed	For example, some Intel boards give a same kind of an error after flashing a new bios, and Intel claims that it is just because there is a change between bios revisions. I think it's the same thing with this ASUS board.
2005-01-22T09:27:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	you should, by all I told you so far know why!
2005-01-22T09:28:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	does your bios have a 'reset configuration' option, if so. run it and try again.
2005-01-22T09:30:00.000Z	kosmonautti	neofeed	Though the message claims the problem to be in bios, it isn't there. It has something to do with linux kernels which have this bug, but version 2.6.10 should fix this. Though, I do must install it from sources if I want it for Warty?
2005-01-22T09:31:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	go to ftp.ubuntu.org and download the modutils and kernel and you should be set..
2005-01-22T09:31:00.000Z	neofeed	kosmonautti	no need to upgrade to hoary
2005-01-22T09:31:00.000Z	kosmonautti	neofeed	ok, thanks
