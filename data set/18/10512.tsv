2008-05-18T00:48:00.000Z	scientus		use avahi shane2peru
2008-05-18T00:49:00.000Z	scientus		or it might also show up as a windows share shane2peru
2008-05-18T00:49:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	avahi?  is that  program, or cli?
2008-05-18T00:49:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	it is hooked up directly to the network.
2008-05-18T00:49:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	via network cable
2008-05-18T00:50:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	ok, will man avahi explain it to me?
2008-05-18T00:52:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	I'm not sure I'm understandning this avahi thing
2008-05-18T00:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	ok, and that will assign an ip to my printer?
2008-05-18T00:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	ok, will check into it
2008-05-18T00:59:00.000Z	shane2peru	scientus	there doesn't seem to be an avahi gui front end, I found a libavahi-ui0 which talks about a gtk, but I don't see anything about running gui
