2005-04-15T13:53:00.000Z	scizzo	whiskers	in menus and so on...
2005-04-15T13:54:00.000Z	scizzo	whiskers	then why would you want to change the looks of GIMP?
2005-04-15T13:55:00.000Z	whiskers	scizzo	but uh...i really don't know the difference .
2005-04-15T14:16:00.000Z	scizzo	whiskers	I really do think you should look at www.gimp.org and www.gimpguru.org
2005-04-15T14:17:00.000Z	scizzo	whiskers	gimpguru has some really good information and tutorials about Photos and using GIMP to do what you want with photos
2005-04-15T14:17:00.000Z	scizzo	whiskers	gimp.org has the general information about GIMP and contains a lot of good basic tutorials
2005-04-15T14:20:00.000Z	whiskers	scizzo	well..i am not a graphics artist...i don't even know how to use microsoft paint or even inkscape
2005-04-15T14:20:00.000Z	scizzo	whiskers	well the best place to start is to learn from tutorials
2005-04-15T14:20:00.000Z	whiskers	scizzo	i just wanted to see why people pay $700 for free programs
