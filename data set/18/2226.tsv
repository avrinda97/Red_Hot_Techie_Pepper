2010-10-30T02:14:00.000Z	ray9na		Hi. non-savvy person in need of a little hand-holding. I'm still using 9.04, but I plan to upgrade, which is why I'm doing what I'm doing (in the name of backing up). How do I navigate to a hidden folder/file?
2010-10-30T02:16:00.000Z	ray9na		okay, and what's the command to list folders/files? ls ?
2010-10-30T02:18:00.000Z	ray9na		so ls lists then? okay
2010-10-30T02:18:00.000Z	ray9na		thanks. i think that's what i need to know
2010-10-30T02:20:00.000Z	ray9na		what's list all files, including hidden? ls -a ?
2010-10-30T02:20:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	yeah
2011-04-06T19:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	you should use gksudo instead of sudo in that instance
2011-04-06T19:17:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	try 'sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude upgrade' in the terminal, see what that does
2011-04-06T19:17:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	it might be that these updates are being held back for some odd reason
2011-04-06T19:21:00.000Z	ray9na	tensorpudding	I run both commands together? 'sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude upgrade'
2011-04-06T19:22:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	when you have the semicolon in there, it makes two commands on one line, you don't have to do it that way though
2011-04-06T19:23:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	aptitude update does what the "checking for updates" does, essentially
2011-04-06T19:24:00.000Z	ray9na	tensorpudding	and the upgrade?
2011-04-06T19:24:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	it installs the updates
2011-04-06T19:24:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	that part might end up installing the updates that you couldn't install before, or (more likely) will tell you why you can't in detail
2011-04-06T19:26:00.000Z	ray9na	tensorpudding	"The 'upgrade' command is deprecated; use 'safe-upgrade' instead."
2011-04-06T19:32:00.000Z	ray9na	tensorpudding	The following packages have been kept back: libavformat52{a} libpostproc51{a} libswscale0{a}  The following packages will be REMOVED: linux-headers-2.6.32-21{u} linux-headers-2.6.32-21-generic{u}
2011-04-06T19:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ray9na	that means that in its wisdom apt has decided you can't install the updates yet for some reason, also that it wants to remove some old kernels
