2007-01-15T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Rocket_37	just reading?
2007-01-15T07:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Rocket_37	you can run WoW on linux
2007-01-15T07:35:00.000Z	Rocket_37	Flannel	!?
2007-01-15T07:35:00.000Z	Rocket_37	Flannel	there's a Linux installer?
2007-01-15T07:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Rocket_37	no, but that doesn't mean it's not doable
2007-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Rocket_37	wine isn't an emulator
2007-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	Rocket_37	Flannel	what is it?
2007-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Rocket_37	it's a compatability layer.  Basically, your program says "call this windows API call" and wine says "you really mean /this/ API call"
2007-01-15T07:38:00.000Z	Rocket_37	Flannel	Wow. No pun intended.
