2011-05-22T02:11:00.000Z	Glycan		For the third time: Can some one please help me?
2011-05-22T02:11:00.000Z	Glycan		Ubuntu boots into a logo slightly to the right, plays the login sound, gives you a mouse, and does nothing
2011-05-22T02:12:00.000Z	Glycan		I had Ubuntu before that, replaced broken windows bootloader with grub, and got this. It worked befoer this.
2011-05-22T02:12:00.000Z	Glycan		Sigh.
2011-05-22T02:13:00.000Z	escott	Glycan	can you login to classic
2011-05-22T02:13:00.000Z	Glycan		Huh?
2011-05-22T02:14:00.000Z	escott		!classic | Glycan
2011-05-22T02:14:00.000Z	Glycan		I only have 4 ops on grub: Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.38-8-generic, sam ething but recovery mode, memtest, some other memtest.
2011-05-22T02:15:00.000Z	Glycan		No, it doesn't boot at all.
2011-05-22T02:15:00.000Z	escott	Glycan	i thought you were saying X wasn't working what about recovery mode
2011-05-22T02:15:00.000Z	Glycan		Well, it sort of works.
2011-05-22T02:15:00.000Z	Glycan		I asume it works, since it doesn't raise any errors and It no difrent from anythign I've seen before (e.g. nothign)
2011-05-22T02:16:00.000Z	Glycan	escott	PM?
2011-05-22T02:17:00.000Z	escott	Glycan	nothing?
2011-05-22T02:17:00.000Z	Glycan		I don't have any experiance with recover mode, so I don't know if it works or not.
2011-05-22T02:17:00.000Z	Glycan		Wait.
2011-05-22T02:18:00.000Z	Glycan		What's X?
2011-05-22T02:19:00.000Z	escott	Glycan	when you boot recovery mode what happens
