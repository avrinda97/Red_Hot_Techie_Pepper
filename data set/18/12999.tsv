2006-07-28T14:43:00.000Z	J-_		how do i format my NTFS external hard drive to fat32?
2006-07-28T14:45:00.000Z	J-_		k cool thanks, will the 300gb hdd be supported with fat32?
2006-07-28T14:46:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	are you using windowsXP with it? or what?
2006-07-28T14:48:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	anyway, yes, 300GB is fine for FAT, unless youre using an older version of windows
2006-07-28T14:52:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	FAT32 will be fine
2006-07-28T15:19:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	no
2006-07-28T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	just run gparted, and format it.
2006-10-14T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	you have build-essential yet?
2006-10-14T11:24:00.000Z	J-_	Flannel	yes i do
2006-10-15T15:51:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	That 'howto' is really poor
2006-10-15T15:46:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	you don't
2006-10-15T15:46:00.000Z	J-_	Flannel	what would be the purpose?
2006-10-15T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	THAT howto is better.  coupled with one of the mail server howtos, you'll be setup.  But yeah, that howto forge one gets away from the ubuntu way of doing some stuff
2006-10-15T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	read the ubuntu howto, it tells you everything you need
2007-03-29T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	docvegan, use the ubuntu wiki (help.ubuntu.com) over ubuntuguide.  Not everything u-g recommends is safe.
2007-03-29T13:26:00.000Z	J-_	Flannel	k, I just recommended it because it's helped me a lot in the past.
2008-05-01T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	J-_	no, theyre the same in this case (a lot of times theyre not)
2008-05-01T13:42:00.000Z	J-_	Flannel	K, cool. =)
