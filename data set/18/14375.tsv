2005-08-11T10:41:00.000Z	seife	Dr_Willis	what u mean i need a new HD?
2005-08-11T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 its proberly easier and safer to put linux on its own hard drive (2nd one would be fine)
2005-08-11T10:39:00.000Z	seife	Dr_Willis	but i have files in there
2005-08-11T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 i STRONGLY suggest you back them up. :P just in case
2005-08-11T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 and you will then need to resize the existing partions to make some free unallocated space
2005-08-11T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 actually you need to create a NONparittion :P lol -
2005-08-11T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 a section of hte hd that i NOT used. not in a drive letter.. ect..
2005-08-11T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 no.. it can work.. you just need tobe carefull
2005-08-11T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 i accidently deleted some junk off my 2nd hd with the ubuntu installer once.. so it pays to be very carefull
2005-08-11T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 i used a live cd with parted  (or qt_parted) or the other variants to resize the existing windows partions. making the last part of the hd. to be UNALLOCATED.
2005-08-11T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 yep..
2005-08-11T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 could just stick with the live cd's
2005-08-24T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 use a different irc client like xchat please.. :P
2005-08-24T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	seife	 put them both in..  and install ubunto the 2nd one. and just dual boot.
2005-08-24T09:59:00.000Z	seife	Dr_Willis	i have two HDs.
