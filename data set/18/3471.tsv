2010-01-01T20:32:00.000Z	akos_		Hello! I have just installed 9.10, but I have been having this issue beforehand. When my computer boots (it's set to automatically log in, i don't want no password to be asked for), it asks for my account password to access the default keyring which is needed to connect to my wifi network... Can't access to the default keyring be granted by default to the network manager?
2010-01-01T20:33:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	put in a blank password
2010-01-01T20:34:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	mhall119, i have to enter it on every reboot... where can I change settings for the keyring, to try what chogydan said?
2010-01-01T20:34:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	Apps > Access> Passwords...
2010-01-01T20:35:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	then right click, and change password
2010-01-01T20:35:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	ah got it... it was in systems -> preferences -> keyrings last time i checked :)
2010-01-01T20:35:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	no, what I just said actually.  That one does something different
2010-01-01T20:36:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	it actually took me a long time to figure out there were two password things!  very confusing...
2010-01-01T20:36:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	thanks for your help, let me reboot and check what happens :)
2010-01-01T20:41:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	hmm that didn't work, nothing happened... also when I try changing the password, it asks for the old password... I can enter ANYTHING there, it doesn't say that it's incorrect...
2010-01-01T20:42:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	then maybe try the directions in that blog post
2010-01-01T20:43:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	hmm ok... it's wierd though.. and there is a "login" keyring why doesn't network manager store it's key there?.... this is beyond me...
2010-01-01T20:43:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	oh yeah, are you doing it to the "default" keyring?
2010-01-01T20:43:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	yeah... that's what it wants to unlock
2010-01-01T20:43:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	to get the pass for the wifi
2010-01-01T20:44:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	so, when you entered a blank password, it doesnt give a warning about unsafe storage?
2010-01-01T20:44:00.000Z	akos_	ChogyDan	if i enter a blank pass, it gives the warning, but if I enter a wrong password as the old password, it doesn't really care about it
2010-01-01T20:45:00.000Z	ChogyDan	akos_	yeah, I dunno.  I entered a blank password, and the next time I logged in it worked
