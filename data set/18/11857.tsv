2010-08-16T16:42:00.000Z	anodesni	manuel__	change "/" into the path to the device
2010-08-16T16:42:00.000Z	manuel__		yes thanks that helped
2010-08-16T16:42:00.000Z	manuel__		grr it did not delete the stuff
2010-08-16T16:43:00.000Z	anodesni	manuel__	just repartition it if there is nothing on the drive
2010-08-16T16:43:00.000Z	manuel__		as it is a hidden part of the hdd is there a way to make it visibale and format it with fdisk?
2010-08-16T16:44:00.000Z	manuel__	anodesni	there is but it is mounted as sr1 and emulates a cd drive
2010-08-16T16:44:00.000Z	anodesni	manuel__	 I mean on the other partition, the actual file storage
