2008-05-17T21:27:00.000Z	amenado		mworth-> good that you are updated, its the vmsplice am referring to..
2008-05-17T21:28:00.000Z	amenado		clintchanc1-> can you paste the command and the result in pastebin? i have not used wicd..so i am not well versed with it.
2008-05-17T21:29:00.000Z	amenado		clintchanc1-> am not a gui person, i use mostly cli, so what ever your gui can do to retrieve info, i can do likewise..
2008-05-17T21:30:00.000Z	amenado		clintchanc1-> maybee..dont know what you got..

2008-05-17T21:34:00.000Z	amenado		Tailsfan-> what is the problem?
2008-05-17T21:35:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	The Grub error I get is Error 17
2008-05-17T21:37:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	I did a fresh install and chose for it to use the whole disk (guided), the grub error as far as I can tell is a side effect of the installer not actually completing, I have ran the installer 8 times now and it always crashes at the same point right near the end, however the live CD works fine on the system with no issues
2008-05-17T21:39:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	it mentions at the bottom "Firewire CD-ROM driver spb2" and then as it's there the machine cuts out
2008-05-17T21:40:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	: No firewire devices are conncted to my machine at all
2008-05-17T21:41:00.000Z	amenado	sbohan	lets do this,  boot using the liveCD and then lets peek around on your installed system.. open a terminal on liveCD and type  fdisk -l
2008-05-17T21:42:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	will go quiet while it loads
2008-05-17T21:43:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	where is the pastebin you use?
2008-05-17T21:44:00.000Z	sbohan	amenado	I will switch to using the ubuntu machine in question now!
