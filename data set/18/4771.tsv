2009-02-12T08:12:00.000Z	Joeseph		with the latest update to Firefox, I can no longer enter in an address into the address bar, or the search bar and go to that page: it gives me an error.    Is this common?
2009-02-12T08:13:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	what's the error?
2009-02-12T08:14:00.000Z	Joeseph	mzz	The error is "ASSERT: Search: _installLocation: enghine has no file!"  and then it gives me a stack Trace, which I don't think will be relevant.
2009-02-12T08:14:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	got any extensions?
2009-02-12T08:14:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	oh, and did you restart the browser completely after installing the upgrade?
2009-02-12T08:15:00.000Z	Joeseph	mzz	    I exed it out and then opened it up again....   I have a few, yes...
2009-02-12T08:15:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	does it still fail with those off (or use the firefox safe mode)? Also consider pastebinning the stack trace
2009-02-12T08:16:00.000Z	Joeseph	mzz	ah.... the clever little "downloads" box was hiding on another desktop of mine.... ha..... it'll probably work now.
2009-05-02T03:15:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	MarkJones: err, does fglrx still support that card? If that's what I think it is it won't
2009-05-02T03:15:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	roughly how old is that card?
2009-05-02T03:15:00.000Z	Joeseph	mzz	   I'm not really sure.  I got this laptop in a junk pile...
2009-05-02T03:16:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	pretty sure you want the opensource radeon driver for that one, and that the closed-source fglrx driver from ati.amd.com doesn't even support it anymore
2009-05-02T03:17:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	I just saw a random fglrx recommendation, I try to correct those if they're wrong :)
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	if the same video (same resolution, etc) plays when played from different hardware (not from a physical dvd) I can't see how the video driver's the problem
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	otoh I think you mentioned "vlc logs me out" earlier? how's that?
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	mzz	Joeseph	if that means the X server crashes that could be the driver's fault
2009-05-02T03:20:00.000Z	Joeseph	mzz	I believe the X server crashed.  It closed all my open programs and brought me back to my login screen.
2009-05-02T03:22:00.000Z	Joeseph	mzz	 My X server crashed when I used dual monitors too....  Don't know exactly why..
