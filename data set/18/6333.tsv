2008-05-27T17:52:00.000Z	cosmodad		what's an "untrusted package" with respect to installing Ubuntu packages using aptitude?
2008-05-27T17:53:00.000Z	cosmodad		?
2008-05-27T17:54:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	it might mean that you are missing a gpg key
2008-05-27T17:55:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	check the webpage of the repo for more info on how to add one
2008-05-27T17:55:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	shouldn't all official packages utter this warning then?
2008-05-27T17:55:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	I haven't seen this warning for the last 25+ packages I installed, and suddenly here it is. Doesn't seem logical to me.
2008-05-27T17:57:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	that could be because not all packages come from the same section
2008-05-27T17:57:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	or the same repo for that matter, assuming you have multiple repos enabled
2008-05-27T17:59:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	I have no clue why but doing apt-get update helped.
2008-05-27T17:59:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	although there was only a single non-official repo in my sources.list, but it is totally unrelated (VirtualBox)
2008-05-27T18:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	it would have updated the gpg key...some repos change their keys at times...you key might have been old
2008-05-27T18:00:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	still, if that was true, I'd have been required to ack the key, wouldn't IÃŸ
2008-05-27T18:00:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	?
2008-05-27T18:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	hmmm...not sure of that
2008-05-27T18:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	since you are updating, rather than adding
2008-05-27T18:03:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	nevermind -- I'm not too much of an gnupg expert to assess the circumstances either.
2008-05-27T18:03:00.000Z	cosmodad	anirudh0	Good Thing is, it works now.
2008-05-27T18:04:00.000Z	anirudh0	cosmodad	no expert on gpg either...but thats usually the case
