2008-03-20T02:45:00.000Z	kitche	itaku	umm maybe xmms or audacious if you mean a "client"
2008-03-20T02:46:00.000Z	itaku	kitche	no i mean a broadcaster
2008-03-20T02:47:00.000Z	kitche	itaku	that's what I meant that's why "client" was in quotes
2008-03-20T02:47:00.000Z	kitche	itaku	you need a client to be able to be a DJ
