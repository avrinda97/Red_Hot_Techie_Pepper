2009-07-10T20:30:00.000Z	azlon		i have a question about ICS. I am using Firestarter like the link from !ics says, but when I enable my eth0 my internet drops. my internet is coming from wlan0... how can i tell ubuntu that my internet is on wlan0?
2009-07-10T20:31:00.000Z	azlon		hrmm
2009-07-10T20:32:00.000Z	azlon		well even if i dont install firestarter (im running from a live cd for now) my internet drops when i plug in the eth0 cable
2009-07-10T20:32:00.000Z	azlon		hold on, im going to exit firestarter, then do ifconfig eth0 up
2009-07-10T20:34:00.000Z	azlon		can you still see me?
2009-07-10T20:34:00.000Z	azlon		can you see me?
2009-07-10T20:35:00.000Z	azlon		hrmm... wonder if it is a ip subnet conflict
2009-07-10T20:35:00.000Z	azlon		maybe im stupid, brb
2009-07-10T20:37:00.000Z	azlon		my wlan ip is 192.168.0.2 and my eth0 ip is 192.168.1.100... this is a different subnet and will not cause conflicts, correct?
2009-07-10T20:38:00.000Z	itswhatev	azlon	that depends on how many bits in the netmask :O
2009-07-10T20:38:00.000Z	azlon	itswhatev	ok, what do i need to do to check that?
2009-07-10T20:39:00.000Z	itswhatev	azlon	verify you've got 255.255.255.0 when you run ifconfig on those interfaces
2009-07-10T20:39:00.000Z	itswhatev		if it's 255.255.0.0 then they are on the same subnet
2009-07-10T20:40:00.000Z	azlon	itswhatev	ok, both are 255.255.255.0, that means i need to change one right? othewise there will be a conflict?
2009-07-10T20:41:00.000Z	itswhatev		no, they can use the same netmask, that's just how the subnet is defined.. so both are on their own subnet and won't talk to each other without a gateway
2009-07-10T20:41:00.000Z	itswhatev	azlon	above
2009-07-10T20:42:00.000Z	azlon	itswhatev	got it... so that isnt the problem... wonder why in internet drops everytime i enable (or plug in a lan cable) to my eth0
2009-07-10T20:43:00.000Z	itswhatev	azlon	hm that i do not know.. if i had that problem i'd try to configure network through the console and take nm-applet out of the mix
