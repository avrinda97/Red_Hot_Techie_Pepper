2009-10-29T21:48:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	last I checked the safest way was to download it from adobe's page ... aptitude will install the 32 bit version with a wrapper, but that hangs mozilla up all the time
2009-10-29T21:49:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	Does that work...for x64?
2009-10-29T21:49:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	adobe has a 64 bit version for download
2009-10-29T21:50:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
2009-10-29T21:50:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	it's in alpha, but works great
2009-10-29T21:50:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	Last time I downloaded the .deb package it was just i386
2009-10-29T21:51:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	Oh, different link. Thanks.
2009-10-29T21:51:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	that's why you have to download it from that URL, it's the labs, alpha software not yet released
2009-10-29T21:51:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	Got it--thanks.
2009-10-29T21:52:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	err...what do I do with the .so file?
2009-10-29T21:52:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	copy it to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2009-10-29T21:53:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	and create a symlink to usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2009-10-29T21:53:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	what's a "symlink"?
2009-10-29T21:53:00.000Z	bigjocker	RobLikesBrunch	er ... create a symlink to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2009-10-29T21:55:00.000Z	RobLikesBrunch	bigjocker	I just moved it into plugins and it works perfectly. Thanks.
