2012-09-18T07:34:00.000Z	Diazo		Howdy all, does anybody in here know how I can diagnose network lag I'm getting in Ubuntu?
2012-09-18T07:35:00.000Z	Diazo		I'm using a wireless connection with Wicd installed.
2012-09-18T07:35:00.000Z	Diazo		It just happened about four days ago.
2012-09-18T07:35:00.000Z	Diazo		Everything else worked flawlessly.
2012-09-18T07:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	did you have a kernel, or wireless related, update for days ago?
2012-09-18T07:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	flash is a poor example of audio/video troubles?
2012-09-18T07:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	flash is a poor example or network troubles.
2012-09-18T07:37:00.000Z	Diazo	zykotick9	Nope, no kernel update and I remember having a Linux Network Firmware driver about a week or two ago. But doubt that affected it.
2012-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	Diazo	zykotick9	Indeed but when I also try to downloading some stuff I get about 1Mbps instead of the 3.2Mbps I normally get.
2012-09-18T07:40:00.000Z	Diazo	zykotick9	The default network-manager is highly unstable and continuously disconnects me from the Internet.
2012-09-18T07:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	i actually use wicd on my netbook, i'm NOT bad mouthing it!
2012-09-18T07:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	i don't use "N-M" anywhere
2012-09-18T07:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	network-manager
2012-09-18T07:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	fyi though, wicd is basically considered "deprecated" by ubuntu's upstream, debian.
2012-09-18T07:42:00.000Z	Diazo	zykotick9	As long as it works right. :P
2012-09-18T07:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	Diazo	too bad i can't suggest you point /etc/apt/apt.conf to your apt-cacher (or apt-cacher-ng) server.  'cause i assume you don't have one (or you wouldn't be asking).  sorry i have no idea on you USC issue, good luck.
2012-09-18T07:52:00.000Z	Diazo	zykotick9	No problem seems a mystery to me.
2012-09-18T12:59:00.000Z	Diazo	zykotick9	and jmstick I tried power cycling the router/cable modem it seemed to revert my 1Mbps back to the 3.2Mbps I was currently getting so I'm good now. :)
