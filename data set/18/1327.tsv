2011-04-26T12:07:00.000Z	freaky[t]		hi all, i got a question. I did apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and now the boot splash and grub background is blue and it says booting kubuntu but i want it back to ubuntu how do i do that?
2011-04-26T12:09:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	you can do it more easily than that:
2011-04-26T12:09:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	just do sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2011-04-26T12:09:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	that will give you a question "Make GDM default?" Say Yes
2011-04-26T12:09:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	gdm is allready the manager i have at login screen
2011-04-26T12:10:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	i mean the bootup screen
2011-04-26T12:10:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	the package for that is plymouth-theme-kubuntu-logo (on natty), there should be an equivalent package in older ubuntus, removing it will return you to the default bootsplash
2011-04-26T12:11:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	do 'apt-cache search kubuntu|grep boot' to find it
2011-04-26T12:12:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	thank you
2011-04-26T12:12:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	you're welcome, did you identify a package for the kubuntu boot splash on your system?
2011-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	 i did
2011-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	 i didsudo apt-get install --reinstall plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text
2011-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	that should do it too.
2011-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	you're on natty?
2011-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	ok thank you very much :D
2011-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	freaky[t]	spirals	yes
2011-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	spirals	freaky[t]	k feel free to pm me if it doesnt work, i'm on natty/kubuntu as well
