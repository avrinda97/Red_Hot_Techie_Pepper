2008-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	sparr		why is #ubuntu+1 closed?
2008-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	because ubuntu 8.04 is out and the next version is not in testing stage yet
2008-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	so do we discuss intrepid in here?
2008-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	yes, that
2008-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	with #ubuntu+1 closed, i assume this is the place for intrepid discussion
2008-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	no it's not discussed here I would worry about it until the public beta is out
2008-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	i worry about it the day new packages go into it.  its already in my sources
2008-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	intrepid is not even avaible for download so wait until the annoucement of the public beta release then ubuntu+1 will be open again
2008-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	ubuntu+1 will be open months before the public beta, like always
2008-05-02T23:42:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	still it's long way off so just check back to see if the room is opened ok
2008-05-02T23:42:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	"check back" is not an answer.  i want to discuss intrepid today.
2008-05-02T23:43:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	until ubuntu+1 is opened there is no discussion
2008-05-02T23:43:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	i disagree
2008-05-02T23:44:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	this room is for support of hardy or older
2008-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	| !intrepid
2008-05-02T23:47:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	fail
2008-05-02T23:47:00.000Z	Shadow420	sparr	|!intrepid
2008-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	sparr	Shadow420	was that supposed to tell me something that I didn't already know?
