2005-05-25T05:08:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	possible I expect but not advisable
2005-05-25T05:08:00.000Z	BockBilbo	kestas	i know... but just wondering if i could do that instead of reinstalling
2005-05-25T05:12:00.000Z	BockBilbo	kestas	but
2005-05-25T05:13:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	nope fraid not
2005-05-25T05:13:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	how would it know which are dependencies it should remove and which arent?
2005-05-25T05:15:00.000Z	BockBilbo	kestas	isnt there a dependency tree? i guess that if you remove the package in the root of the tree it will remove the whole tree
2005-05-25T05:15:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	the tree goes all the way down to libc
2005-05-25T05:15:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	and libc is needed by everything
2005-05-25T05:17:00.000Z	BockBilbo	kestas	i remember removing kde when i used debian, and someone told me in the kde channel to remove an specific packages... i did the apt-get remove kdepkg and asked me if i wanted to remove like 200 packages
2005-05-25T05:17:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	what gentoo does is keeps a list of all the packages you installed yourself
2005-05-25T05:17:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	then you can remove a package you installed, and it will remove all the dependencies which you didnt explicitly install
2005-05-25T05:18:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	debian could use something like that ,but it has a few drawbacks
2005-05-25T05:18:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	but what if you were using k3b, which uses qt and possibly other kde packages?
2005-05-25T05:19:00.000Z	BockBilbo	kestas	true...
2005-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	its pretty complicated
2005-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	BockBilbo	kestas	what do you mean?
2005-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	an AMD processor is a complicated thing
2005-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	kestas	BockBilbo	you need to know microchip physics
