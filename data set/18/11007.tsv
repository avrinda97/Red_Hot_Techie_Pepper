2007-06-08T09:17:00.000Z	fog_proxy		Hi all. I have a bash script which I want it start at the ubuntu(feisty) boot time, how to do that?
2007-06-08T09:17:00.000Z	fog_proxy		I have tried to add the script at '/etc/rc.local', but seems not work
2007-06-08T09:18:00.000Z	wols	fog_proxy	edit /etc/rc.local
2007-06-08T09:18:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	I tried that, add the script(e.g. vlanstart.sh) in /etc/rc.local, but seems not work
2007-06-08T09:18:00.000Z	wols	fog_proxy	is your rc.local exectuable?
2007-06-08T09:19:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	yes
2007-06-08T09:20:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	How to check if the rc.local is executed at the boot time?
2007-06-08T09:20:00.000Z	wols	fog_proxy	it gets called by /etc/init.d/rc.local. check if /etc/rc2.d has a symlink back to that rc.local file
2007-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	yes, there is. https://account.qq.com/cgi-bin/showMain
2007-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	sorry, S99rc.local -> ../init.d/rc.local
2007-06-08T09:24:00.000Z	wols	fog_proxy	so it gets started/run
2007-06-08T09:24:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	started/run?
2007-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	I don't know if the rc.local run at the boot time, how to verify?
2007-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	wols	fog_proxy	put a "touch /home/fog_proxy/filename. if that filename is created, rc.local is run
2007-06-08T09:27:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	ahha, good idea, thx
2007-06-08T09:37:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	I add the touch command at rc.local, but not work. I think rc.local did not executed, but I don't know why
2007-06-08T09:38:00.000Z	wols	fog_proxy	add the touch to /etc/init.d/rc.local
2007-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	fog_proxy	wols	I have tried. init.d/rc.local is working, but /etc/rc.local not
