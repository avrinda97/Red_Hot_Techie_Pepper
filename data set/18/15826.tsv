2005-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	what version of ubuntu are you running (please don't repeat yourself)
2005-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	it is hard for us to guess what is wrong with your system; what have you changed since it last worked?
2005-10-13T16:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	normal system updates (synaptic or apt-get etc); to compile your own kernel, see the kernelhowto on the wiki (wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelHowto)
2005-10-13T05:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	linux-686
2005-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	use synaptic (much easier) or 'sudo apt-get install linux-686'
2005-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	I wouldn't upgrade my kernel unless I had a good reason too
2005-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	i doubt upgrading the kernel will help; the same sound drivers will be used in both
2005-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	then wait for breezy
2005-10-13T05:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	what you are doing will install a -686 version of the 2.6.10 kernel
2005-10-13T05:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	breezy will be out this Friday
2005-10-13T05:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	you can get a preview release now, but i'd recommend waiting
2005-10-13T05:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	commodore	you can use synaptic to update
