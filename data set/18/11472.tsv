2010-03-08T06:33:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		So if I want to reinstall Ubuntu over Windows can I just delete windows with rm -rf / -no-preserve-root ?
2010-03-08T06:34:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		How do i do that in XP?
2010-03-08T06:34:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		oh
2010-03-08T06:35:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		I haven't used Linux since Corel Linux. so I forgot a bit.
2010-03-08T06:35:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		So is there a Linux like Corel Linux?
2010-03-08T06:35:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		I really liked it
2010-03-08T06:36:00.000Z	CultOfTheGlenda		Oh it died in 1999
2010-03-08T06:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	Corel Linux  stopped being made years ago
2010-03-08T06:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	the command you gave would delete / in a Linux distro and result in it being rather well messed up.
2010-03-08T06:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	you can delete WIndows using the Ubuntu installer,  or  the gparted partition editor on the CD
2010-03-08T06:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	Unix/Linux is better than Windows for commands
2010-03-08T06:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	right
2010-03-08T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	people tend to just use the default in Ubuntu
2010-03-08T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	also useually more advanced Desktop Linux users don't use Ubuntu at all,  because they are using other distro/s instead,  or  they use other distros and Ubuntu
2010-03-08T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	many commands are  for loads of distro's some commands like sudo apt-get install programname are only for  Debian and Debian based distros such as Ubuntu
2010-03-08T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	or well distros based on Ubuntu,  well other distros don't tend to use sudo
2010-03-08T06:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	maybe you want a re cap on commands or something so
2010-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	CultOfTheGlenda	also you seem like the kind of person that will want to know about http://www.distrowatch.com if you don't already know about it
