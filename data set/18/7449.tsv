2008-01-14T10:19:00.000Z	Jangari		hey, if imacs run on intel chips now, can a pc run osX?
2008-01-14T10:19:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	I don't think so
2008-02-06T06:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	#bash ?
2008-02-06T08:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	using sudo?
2008-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	s = sticky
2008-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	files in that directory can only be deleted or moved by the directory's owner, root, or the file's owber
2008-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	it's explained in man chmod"
2008-06-01T07:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	you need to manually edit it
2008-06-01T07:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	it could be an installer bug
2008-06-01T07:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	ls /boot
2008-06-01T07:12:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	remove the packages for those old kernels
2008-06-01T07:13:00.000Z	Jangari	Starnestommy	using synaptic, i guess
2008-06-02T05:43:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	you need to fix /etc/hosts in recovery mode
2008-06-02T05:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	replace "127.0.1.1 BLAH" with "127.0.1.1 OUTPUT-OF-hostname-COMAMND"
2008-06-02T05:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	it should just be cimputername.
2008-06-02T05:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	er, computername.  The domain should be filled in automatically when it is needed
2008-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	because you need root permissions to edit /etc/hosts
2008-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Jangari	go into recovery mode.  That has root access upon logging in without using sudo
