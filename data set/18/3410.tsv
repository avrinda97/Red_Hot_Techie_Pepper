2010-07-03T04:42:00.000Z	nerdy_kid		i dont think apt-get is auto updating like I have it set to do in synaptic, how can i fix this?  I did a ground up install so i might be missing a few packages. thanks!
2010-07-03T04:44:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	i think it does this via the Update Manager (system->administration->update manager->Settings)
2010-07-03T04:45:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	yeah under "software sources", i have that set to "daily" but i dont think it works.
2010-07-03T04:46:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	you just want the upgrades to automatically install?
2010-07-03T04:47:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	no just notify me
2010-07-03T04:47:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	yeah, then where i said under Update Manager
2010-07-03T04:48:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	right i have that set
2010-07-03T04:49:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	and it doesn't pop up from time to time with the new updates?
2010-07-03T04:50:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	no; i have another pc though and it works fine.
2010-07-03T04:51:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	yeah, not sure.  the packages are 'update-manager*' and 'update-notifier*'
2010-07-03T04:52:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	and 'update-inetd'
2010-07-03T04:54:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	hmm i dont have a /etc/inetd.conf, i think im supposed to have that?
2010-07-03T04:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	i do, but it's empty
2010-07-03T04:59:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1152521 same issue
2010-07-03T05:03:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	not sure, short of trying to reinstall the packages i listed
2010-07-03T05:04:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	im also missing the "dist upgrade" part of software sources...strange!  ok well thanks! :)
2010-07-03T05:06:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	codebrainz	ah i found it, missing the update notifier package, i had all the update manager packages though :) thanks!
2010-07-03T05:06:00.000Z	codebrainz	nerdy_kid	good stuff!
