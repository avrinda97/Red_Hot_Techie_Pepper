2008-12-04T01:15:00.000Z	dnyy		Would running a LAMP setup, but only using it to test personal stuff, hog much memory?
2008-12-04T01:16:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	depends a bit on what kind of stuff you intend to test.. but the basic apps won't use a lot of memory
2008-12-04T01:17:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	I run lamp and some more stuff on a via mini-itx board with 512 MB memory.. it currently only uses about 100 MB for just running
2008-12-04T01:17:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	Mainly small things like sweetcron, and maybe wordpress.  The only person seeing it will be me.  I guess my main question is, if nobody is going to it and it's just there ideling, will it take much memory?
2008-12-04T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	nah.. I don't think so
2008-12-04T01:18:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	Ah, alirght then.  I just did another fresh install, and want to keep it running as fast as I can. I too only have 512MB ram. :<
2008-12-04T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	you can shut down the gui if you're not using it.. that saves quite a bit of memory
2008-12-04T01:19:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	I didn't know there was a GUI? :x
2008-12-04T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	ah.. you're running it on a ubuntu server install?
2008-12-04T01:19:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	Ubuntu desktop, but installing apache/mysql/etc manually
2008-12-04T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	I just use the regular desktop ubuntu.. so I shut down gnome when I don't use it
2008-12-04T01:20:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	Aah, I gotcha, I thought you meant a GUI for a LAMP setup :p
2008-12-04T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	ah.. nah.. I meant gnome and X
2008-12-04T01:20:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	Does ctrl+alt+f1 "shut down" gnome, or just disable it until you bring it back? ;o
2008-12-04T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	I usually access it using ssh so I just run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2008-12-04T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	ah.. ctrl+alt+f1 just "hides" it.. it's still running
2008-12-04T01:22:00.000Z	Slart	dnyy	if you're worrying about memory footprint you might want to take a look at xubuntu.. it's a bit leaner
2008-12-04T01:23:00.000Z	dnyy	Slart	I'll look into it, then.  I can barely run songbird and firefox without my laptop wanting to crash.
