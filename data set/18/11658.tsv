2007-05-20T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	spi	you get "sensors-detect" and "sensors".  You run sensors-detect first
2007-05-20T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	spi	lm-sensors
2007-05-20T06:21:00.000Z	spi	jrib	tx you very much
2007-05-20T06:31:00.000Z	spi	jrib	I installed lm-sensors,but I can't find executable files to it, where I have to see?
2007-05-20T06:33:00.000Z	spi	jrib	Ok tx you
2007-05-20T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	spi	there are some gui frontends too, but i don't about them.  xsensors and ksensors
2007-05-20T06:34:00.000Z	spi	jrib	ok I'm looking about them, tx
2007-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	spi	jrib	hmm I tried to start sensors-detect and sensors but seem that I need to mount additional modules....
2007-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	spi	yeah, sensors-detect should tell you what you need and print it out
2007-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	spi	jrib	I have to mount these modules with modprobe?
2007-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	spi	yeah, this time.  In the future you just add it to the file it tells you to
2007-05-20T06:50:00.000Z	spi	jrib	Ok, It shows me which modules has to be installed but named with long description.... and no with its real module name
2007-05-20T06:51:00.000Z	spi	jrib	I can look them on internet? what about this?
2007-05-20T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	spi	the last thing the sensors-detect script should output is some stuff to add to /etc/modules.  That should contain the name of the modules
2007-05-20T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	spi	maybe this helps https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto
2007-05-20T06:53:00.000Z	spi	jrib	ok
2007-05-20T07:10:00.000Z	spi	jrib	Ok well done, I'm watching my device temperatures!! thanks you!
2007-05-20T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	spi	great
