2008-05-16T21:27:00.000Z	Bodsda		This is gonna sound proper stupid. How do you open a file in vim?
2008-05-16T21:27:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	vim <file>
2008-05-16T21:28:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	Lardarse, is there any way to do this after vim is already open?
2008-05-16T21:28:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	that still works. or try ":args <file>" in vim proper
2009-06-29T22:38:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	sure, you can have two X Window sessions running. have a look at "Xnest" (there might even be a menu entry for this by default)
2009-06-29T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	you need to specify display :1.0 with the -display switch, most likely.
2009-06-29T22:46:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	i ran   startx --display :1.0   from tty6 and got the same xserver error
2009-06-29T22:47:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	"man startx"
2009-06-29T22:48:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	I cant find anything relevant in there
2009-06-29T22:48:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	have a look in "man xinit", should cover the options there.
2009-06-29T22:49:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	or try installing xnest
2009-06-29T22:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	same error with xinit, looking at xnest now
2009-06-29T22:50:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	what precise command line did you use for startx/xinit?
2009-06-29T22:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	xnest opens in a window on the current xserver
2009-06-29T22:50:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	sure does.
2009-06-29T22:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	xinit -display :1   and :1.0
2009-06-29T22:51:00.000Z	sipior	Bodsda	there are examples given in the two man pages. have you tried them?
2009-06-29T22:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	sipior	all sorted, cheers dude
