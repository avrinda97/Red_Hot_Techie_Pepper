2007-12-01T12:19:00.000Z	gRnt		Hi everyone I've got a slightly newbish question :)
2007-12-01T12:19:00.000Z	gRnt		I've installed my first ever linux distro today (ubuntu) vut given I didn't have a machine I am running it through VMWare.
2007-12-01T12:20:00.000Z	gRnt		All afternoon all ive been able to manage to do is update my sources.list to my local ISP's, I then decided to try out running an ap to see if it worked
2007-12-01T12:20:00.000Z	gRnt		so I went to install xhat
2007-12-01T12:20:00.000Z	gRnt		xchat**
2007-12-01T12:21:00.000Z	gRnt		when I run it I get the error "(xchat:4228): Gtk-warning **: cannot open display:
2007-12-01T12:21:00.000Z	gRnt		is that a vmware issue because the app is gui based or did I stuff something up?
2007-12-01T12:22:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	xchat runs though?
2007-12-01T12:26:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	are you running a graphical desktop? what did you install?
2007-12-01T12:27:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	you of course need to be running X to run gui programs, otherwise there is no display, yes
2007-12-01T12:28:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	not sure why you used server instead of desktop then, but you can install ubuntu-desktop package if you want
2007-12-01T12:28:00.000Z	gRnt	astro76	was just recommened by friends to run server so I did. what do you mean I will need to be running X to run gui programs?
2007-12-01T12:37:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	because you are running ubuntu server with no x installed
2007-12-01T12:37:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	install ubuntu-desktop
2007-12-01T12:38:00.000Z	gRnt	astro76	what do you mean I have no x installed?
2007-12-01T12:41:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	do you want a command-line only server, or a desktop system? if the latter, you might want to install regular Ubuntu in the first place, or as I said now you could install the ubuntu-desktop package from the server install
2007-12-01T12:43:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	hehe, well defeats the purpose of running it as a server... but if it's intended as a desktop...
2007-12-01T12:43:00.000Z	astro76	gRnt	they said that because graphical desktop introduces security risks unnecessary in a server
