2009-03-30T19:56:00.000Z	NoobGuest		I have found an old package with drivers from intel for my old dells onboard video.  I do not understand how to properly execute the install.sh file contained within it. Any takers?
2009-03-30T19:56:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	./install.sh
2009-03-30T19:56:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	what do you mean by that? type install.sh from terminal?
2009-03-30T19:57:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	from the folder that contains the install.sh file in a terminal type './install.sh' and it should work, yes.
2009-03-30T19:57:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	I see what you meant
2009-03-30T19:58:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	im on it. Why is that syntax necessary?
2009-03-30T19:59:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	in linux the current working path is not included in the search path so you have to specify ./ (current working dir) so machine finds the install.sh file
2009-03-30T19:59:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	is that way for install.sh and other ????.sh scripts as well as configure adn such
2009-03-30T19:59:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	Ah, thanks I had read about that before.  I am coming from windows/ms-dos background and that is a very weird idea from that perspective. Thanks!
2009-03-30T20:00:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	this is a major breakthrough for me lol.
2009-03-30T20:00:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	yes I used linux for a year befor someone spelled it out for me :)
2009-03-30T20:00:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	it was a major break thru for me too...
2009-03-30T20:00:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	haha.. im glad to be ahead of a year :P.
2009-03-30T20:02:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	hm thanks!

2009-03-30T20:11:00.000Z	NoobGuest	dougl	if you get a chance I sent you a pm
2009-03-30T20:12:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	is best to ask in the channel, cuz then the people smarter than me can check my answer so...
2009-03-30T20:12:00.000Z	dougl	NoobGuest	"Im taking you up: when I went to run the install.sh for these old linux graphics drivers I was given this: The DRI drivers can not be installed without the latest kernel modules.Installation will be aborted. See the dri.log file for information on" => install your kernel sources and try again... I think
