2012-11-27T02:04:00.000Z	memetic		The system is running in low graphics mode.  I can't ctrl+alt+f1 to get to a command prompt, and can only ssh in.  I can't run Xorg -configure.  What do I do?
2012-11-27T02:05:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	ctrl+alt+f2 then?
2012-11-27T02:09:00.000Z	memetic	heoyea	I did that and can kill X, but when I run Xorg -configure it errors out about number of detected displays.
2012-11-27T02:10:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	try reinstalling ur graphic drivers?
2012-11-27T02:12:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	maybe check ur xorg.conf file
2012-11-27T02:13:00.000Z	memetic	heoyea	device driver is 'nvidia'
2012-11-27T02:14:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	ur on 12.10?
2012-11-27T02:14:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	this happen cuz u updated the drivers?
2012-11-27T02:15:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	yea i heard it broke
2012-11-27T02:15:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	think theres a fix i heard about
2012-11-27T02:17:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	think u need to install the headers also
2012-11-27T02:17:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic
2012-11-27T02:18:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	actually, sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current, then sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic, then reboot and install the drivers from the software center
2012-11-27T02:19:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	in the future just do a fresh install
2012-11-27T02:20:00.000Z	memetic	heoyea	I might do a fresh install anyway.  I did all that before coming here :\
2012-11-27T02:20:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	if u make like 2 partition, / and /home , fresh install is best
2012-11-27T02:28:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	if is on a parition thats not gonna be formatted then is safe
2012-11-27T02:32:00.000Z	heoyea	memetic	i usually have like 5 paritions, install a distro on each, if one fails i can use another
