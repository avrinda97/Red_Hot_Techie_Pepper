2009-03-31T15:09:00.000Z	lockd	techouse	wants 2000 euros to do what with the app?
2009-03-31T15:09:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	just for the plain installation
2009-03-31T15:09:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	the app itself is a language database
2009-03-31T15:10:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	all the apps are opensource
2009-03-31T15:10:00.000Z	lockd	techouse	so, you want to know how to install it?
2009-03-31T15:10:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	no i want an evaluation of the costs :D
2009-03-31T15:11:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	which inclusdes installing apps that are in the ubuntu repos and compiling framenet
2009-03-31T15:11:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	imho, wi wouldn't give the woman more than 500 eur :P
2009-03-31T15:11:00.000Z	lockd	techouse	what do you mean an evaluation of the costs? someone coming 'all the way from Germany' isn't charging much for that
2009-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	well.....for those things....like 150 eur for adding a user to the mysql database...
2009-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	lockd	techouse	plus, it doesn't look like FrameNet is free, at all
2009-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	it's free, but limited
2009-03-31T15:13:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	anyway, if you got 10 min i could send you the xls to your email or something
2009-03-31T15:13:00.000Z	lockd	techouse	limited in which way? data, or functionality?
2009-03-31T15:14:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	people - you have to ask the devel to get a license, but it's free
2009-03-31T15:14:00.000Z	lockd	techouse	so if you have the license, why do you still need to pay? can't you install it all yourself?
2009-03-31T15:16:00.000Z	techouse	lockd	it's complicated.... wait until you see my email
