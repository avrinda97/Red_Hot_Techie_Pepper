2009-11-07T16:31:00.000Z	Valmon		Hello everyone!
2009-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	Valmon		I'm stacked with new gdm configuration.
2009-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	Valmon		I can't start gdm without X
2009-11-07T16:34:00.000Z	Valmon		I'm trying setup configuration xinetd<->vnc<->gdm
2009-11-07T16:34:00.000Z	Valmon		It works fine with 9.04
2009-11-07T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Valmon	 GDM has undergone radical changes in 9.10
2009-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	Do you think, there is way to setup new gdm withou X?
2009-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Valmon	  that dosent make much sence..  but im not sure what you are trying to do
2009-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	vnc as X server.
2009-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	vnc+gdm
2009-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Valmon	 you could make vncserver run gdm  or at last ive done so ages ago..
2009-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Valmon	 i tend to just ssh in, start vncserver as the user i want to connect as.
2009-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	 Yeah, that's what I try to do )
2009-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Valmon	 using gdm + vncserver you lose the 'persistant' running feature of vnc
2009-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	 well. xinetd<->vnc<->gdm was persistent congiguration on jaunty.
2009-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	 Anyway, thanks. I will search.
2009-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Valmon	 i mean where you could close/exit vncviwer then to to a 2nd box and reconnect to the still running desktop
2009-11-07T16:49:00.000Z	Valmon	Dr_Willis	 Yes, it works that way on januty
