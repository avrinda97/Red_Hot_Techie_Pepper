2008-07-09T15:40:00.000Z	jeeves__		can anyone recomend a good site planning tool?
2008-07-09T15:40:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	as in?
2008-07-09T15:41:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	I'm trying to plan out the menu systems for my new Joomla site, and I want to get a graphical tool that I can send the rest of the idoits on my dev team so we're all working from the same page.
2008-07-09T15:41:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	aha joomla, so ytou want , a flow chart of your website?
2008-07-09T15:43:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	yea.  I'm currently running PHPbb, and it dosn't have a lot of the features I'm looking for (maybe Joomla isn't the one I need, so I'll also take sudgestions.  Bonus points on if I can admin it from a desktop app).  And yes, I'd like to map it out so I'm not getting lost
2008-07-09T15:46:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	well I'm a joomla user myself, but don't have a 'flow chart' of it.
2008-07-09T15:46:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	what's the main purpose of the webpage?
2008-07-09T15:48:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	ok, check out www.tessawhite.ca/site/ for the PHPbb mess, and then check out www.tessawhite.ca/main/ for the Joomla mess.  I'd like to get something that I can keep track of all of my e-mails from the elected officals, and to add some stats (ie. how long it takes them to get back to me, etc), as well, I'll end up making users for each offical so people can directly e-mail them from the site.
2008-07-09T15:49:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	I'd apericate any help you can offer to add the "flash" to the site.  I'll worry about the "bitch work" to put up the content, but I'm TOTTALY lost as how it works
2008-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	did you get to see what I'm talking about?
2008-07-09T15:51:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	i'm looking at page nw
2008-07-09T15:51:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	what you're looking for is someone who makes a site and you just update it all?
2008-07-09T15:52:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	did you see the general idea of what I'm working on?  I'm trying to prove that the elected officals are NOT doing their job.  Then when I get the media involved, and the public starts to hit the site, they can graphically see how long it takes them to reply, etc
2008-07-09T15:52:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	but I also want them to be able to read ALL of the content on there with highlights on the newest stuff, etc
2008-07-09T15:53:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	and possibly to set up accounts for each offical and let the public click on the user and when they send a message on the site, it'll actully get e-mailed to the officall's real e-mail (but the e-mailing process will remain transparent to the end user)
2008-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	is what I'm looking for a dooable thing?
2008-07-14T13:02:00.000Z	jeeves__	microwaver	good, you're here!!  I said hi to you in #joomla, but you took off
2008-07-14T13:02:00.000Z	microwaver	jeeves__	aha :) I was relogging ;)
