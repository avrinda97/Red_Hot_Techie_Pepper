2005-12-14T17:41:00.000Z	j-linux		Since I can't see the computer (Dell Latitude D810) before I buy it and I am going to be running Ubuntu on it -- I am wondering how the UXGA display looks when the resolution is reduced.  Fuzzy or not?  I don't care to much how it looks under Windows.  I'm wondering if the resolution will be to small for me to read, although I've heard the display looks great.
2005-12-14T17:42:00.000Z	j-linux		BluDevil: why not?  I'm down to either ThinkPad or Dell but Dell is easier to buy.
2005-12-14T17:42:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	don't reduce resolution, increae fontsize...
2005-12-14T17:42:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	why is that?
2005-12-14T17:43:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	because they ship crap and make it expensive
2005-12-14T17:46:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	then what do you recommend that will run Ubuntu/Linux and has a good at-home service plan?
2005-12-14T17:46:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	no hardware vendor does at-home service for linux
2005-12-14T17:47:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	 they said they would send someone to my house with parts if it breaks.
2005-12-30T08:11:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	rm -f /hpme/neil/.ICEauthority
2005-12-30T08:12:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	what is that?
2005-12-30T08:12:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	something that was meant for voidfx :)
2006-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	no surprise...
2006-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	edit /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-03-17T14:39:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	automatix is a virus
2006-03-17T14:40:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	a virus?
2006-03-17T14:40:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	what does it do?
2006-03-17T14:40:00.000Z	j-linux	Seveas	is it malicious software?
2006-03-17T15:11:00.000Z	Seveas	j-linux	how surprising ;)
