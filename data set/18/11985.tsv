2007-06-27T16:11:00.000Z	stefg	CyberMad	on cli that would involve to alias the rm -command with a small script that puts a 'really do it?' confirmation prompt before the actual action (Ugh, how annoying)
2007-06-27T16:12:00.000Z	CyberMad	stefg	hehe, how about GUI?
2007-06-27T16:13:00.000Z	stefg	CyberMad	did the invention of the trashbin pass unnoticed by you ?
