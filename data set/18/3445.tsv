2009-10-02T22:45:00.000Z	mezquitale		this is a joke!  Everytime I print a file the file name appears on top!  Ubuntu is now useless, I can't print a resume, legal paper, nothing that I intend to use in a professional setting!!
2009-10-02T22:46:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	what are you printing it with...
2009-10-02T22:47:00.000Z	mezquitale	chrgtr	i am using an hp laserjet 2100 and everytime I print I see the file name on top, I tried it with text editor and ABI word
2009-10-02T22:49:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	It might be a setting in abi word and text editor..
2009-10-02T22:49:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	Have you tried printing a pdf
2009-10-02T22:49:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	or saving a file as a pdf
2009-10-02T22:50:00.000Z	mezquitale	chrgtr	thanks for the tip but it should work with any application, i'll try installing openoffice which I didnt want to do but now I will be forced to, i will have to use redmond for the moment being
2009-10-02T22:50:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	i still dont know if it will work yet though?
2009-10-02T22:51:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	save it as a pdf and check if it has the file name on top
2009-10-02T22:52:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	its probably just a small setting somewhere no big deal
2009-10-02T22:52:00.000Z	mezquitale	chrgtr	i am not attempting to find a way to print it, i am attempting to find a way to get rid of a problem, this didnt happen before
2009-10-02T22:52:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	yeah..
2009-10-02T22:53:00.000Z	mezquitale	chrgtr	it's not a big deal but now I cant print and I have to fax a document in the next 15 minutes, ubuntu is useless for practical business
2009-10-02T22:53:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	its not ubuntu, its probably just abi word...
2009-10-02T22:54:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	is there a page setup somewhere
2009-10-02T22:54:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	I dont actualy have abiword so im in the dark
2009-10-02T22:54:00.000Z	mezquitale	chrgtr	i tried with text editor, or maybe it's CUPS??? either way printing a letter should not be this complicated
2009-10-02T22:55:00.000Z	chrgtr	mezquitale	a text editor would print the filename by default
