2008-06-17T06:44:00.000Z	Dbproguy		If I partition my hard drive with a gentoo system rescue cd or somethin like that is it possible I could lose any information?
2008-06-17T06:44:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	Why would you want to do that? =)
2008-06-17T06:46:00.000Z	Dbproguy	EvilDennisR	I'm partitioning my hard drive so I can dual-boot ubuntu and xp
2008-06-17T06:46:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	...so why would you use a gentoo cd =)
2008-06-17T06:47:00.000Z	Dbproguy	EvilDennisR	I don't know, I was told that it has something to partition my drive with
2008-06-17T06:47:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	so does the ubuntu live cd..
2008-06-17T06:50:00.000Z	Dbproguy	EvilDennisR	Well with the ubuntu live cd, is there a chance I might lose data?
2008-06-17T06:51:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	Why would you lose data?? Just don't install ubuntu again!
2008-06-17T06:51:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	Use the gparted program
2008-06-17T06:51:00.000Z	Dbproguy	EvilDennisR	I'm just trying to figure out if I should back up all my personal files before I partition my drive.
2008-06-17T06:52:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	Whats on the drive right now
2008-06-17T06:52:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	ubuntu already, or winblowz already
2008-06-17T06:52:00.000Z	Dbproguy	EvilDennisR	WinXP and all my personal files
2008-06-17T06:53:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	Yeah, you're fine. Resize the partition with gparted, install ubuntu
2008-06-17T06:53:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	The installer will actually do the resize for you
2008-06-17T06:53:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	So you don't have to load the live cd, you can just do a complete install
2008-06-17T06:54:00.000Z	Dbproguy	EvilDennisR	I'm on an HP system, and I did that before then the stupid HP Recovery thing came up and stopped me then redid my hard drive so I lost all my data
2008-06-17T06:54:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Dbproguy	Well tell the HP recovery thing to F-off if that happens again. See if you can turn it off in the bios or something
