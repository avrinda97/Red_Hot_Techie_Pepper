2006-09-03T16:44:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	You've doomed your PC.
2006-09-03T16:45:00.000Z	calistos_28	DJAdmiral	seriously, do you know what's going on? will i need to reinstall Google Earth or Ubuntu can't handle it?
2006-09-03T16:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	Installing software through Automatix is considered suicide
2006-09-03T16:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	What you should have done is downloaded and installed Google Earth from Google's website itself
2006-09-03T16:46:00.000Z	calistos_28	DJAdmiral	actually a lot of people recommended me this way of installation
2006-09-03T16:47:00.000Z	calistos_28	DJAdmiral	oks, it seems that maybe you have reason
2006-09-03T16:51:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	plus it messes up your sources.list file. It means bad juju!
2006-09-03T16:52:00.000Z	calistos_28	DJAdmiral	the source.lists file is not a problem since it only holds 4 respositories
2006-09-03T16:52:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	but it changes the URLS of those repos like nutsy
2006-09-03T16:52:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	more like nazi than nutsy
2006-09-03T16:53:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	anytime.
2006-09-03T16:53:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	If i'm not here then at least 800 other people are.
2006-09-03T16:57:00.000Z	calistos_28	DJAdmiral	do you know how can i find the googleearth package in synaptic? I try to look for 'google', 'earth', 'googleearth' and nothing happens. Is that the result of what you were telling me about the bypass of synaptics?
2006-09-03T16:57:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	you won't find it in the repos
2006-09-03T16:58:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	you will need to get it from google earth's website itself
2006-09-03T16:58:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	Either the beta or the stable will have a linux version
2006-09-03T05:01:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	calistos_28	there's no worry. the installer is pretty easy.
