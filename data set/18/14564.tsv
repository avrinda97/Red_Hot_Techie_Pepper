2005-07-23T15:40:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> do you know how to enable icons on desktop ?
2005-07-23T15:41:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oliwer	start up nautilus
2005-07-23T15:41:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	: yes ! and maybe other (shortcuts)
2005-07-23T15:42:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> i don't have nautilus (i have kubuntu :(
2005-07-23T15:42:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oliwer	you have UbuntuX if you have XFCE
2005-07-23T15:44:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> hum... i've a kubuntu and i installed xfce later. What do you mean by "ubuntuX" ?
2005-07-23T15:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oliwer	it is a joke ubuntux is ubuntu with xfce like kubuntu is ubuntu with kde
2005-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> I would be happy if ubuntuX could exist ;)  I'm gonna launch the project lol
2005-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oliwer	good luck we tried long time ago but hey we didnt try too hard
2005-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> what was the main problem ?
2005-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oliwer	not enough ppl we knew using xfce so we didnt really get up an going enough to try for the official stand
2005-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> i was wondering : can we use something else than KDM or GDM ?
2005-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oliwer	look in kynaptic for alternatives
2005-07-23T15:57:00.000Z	oliwer	hybrid_goth	> after searching, i think that XDM coupled with xbanner would be the best choice for an ubuntuX. Did you ever tried xdm ?
