2006-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 is it NTFS?
2006-06-27T12:16:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 is it mounted rw or ro?
2006-06-27T12:24:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 system->administration->disks  does that help at all?
2006-06-27T12:24:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 you may need to edit /etc/fstab to mount the drive rw instead of ro  (read/write vs read only)
2006-06-27T12:25:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 you may also need to add a 'user' flag to the mount options
2006-06-27T12:26:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 try changing nouser to user
2006-06-27T12:30:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 did it work with user instead of nouser?

2006-06-27T12:40:00.000Z	wastrel	please	 get rid of all those flags and just use 'defaults' maybe.
