2010-10-04T13:48:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	your machine needs to be publicly accessible on the internet and you need to point the domain to your IP in the registrar DNS management web interface
2010-10-04T13:49:00.000Z	Zeu5	ilovefairuz	machine is publicly accessible. yes. Point domain to your IP in registrar DNS management web interface. i dont understand how that works please advise
2010-10-04T13:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	when you 'sign in' to your account to be able to manage the domain, mostly there's an option to manage the DNS records for your domain, you need to add an "A" (address) record to your domain that contains your static ip address
2010-10-04T13:54:00.000Z	Zeu5	ilovefairuz	yup just did that
2010-10-04T13:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	you don't need to change the name servers if all you need is to point the domain to your machine
2010-10-04T13:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	and beware that DNS changes take some time to propagate
2010-10-04T13:55:00.000Z	Zeu5	ilovefairuz	then do i need to do anything over at the servers?
2010-10-04T13:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	just to get it working, no you don't
2010-10-04T13:56:00.000Z	Zeu5	ilovefairuz	so i just wait? roughly how long will it take?
2010-10-04T13:57:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	could be anything from few minutes to few hours, use this command to verify the ip: dig yourdomain.com
2010-10-04T13:59:00.000Z	Zeu5	ilovefairuz	okie so later on, when the DNS changes are propagated
2010-10-04T14:01:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	there are interfaces that you can use to manage "virtual hosts" on your machine like webmin
2010-10-04T14:02:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Zeu5	but by default, when you access yourdomain.com it will be point to /var/www
