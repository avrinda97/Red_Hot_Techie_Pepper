2007-07-10T06:47:00.000Z	shirish		guys I am on a friends laptop & he has a usb mouse. I installed it yesterday & it worked but today it isn't. I restarted the system twice but the same result. Anybody has any ideas?
2007-07-10T06:47:00.000Z	caseofthemondays	shirish	 is the mouse listed in the fsusb list ?
2007-07-10T06:49:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	nope, it just shows 5 buses, device 1ID 0000:0000

2007-07-10T06:54:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	there is also a printer involved, but that's another story altogether

2007-07-10T06:55:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	ok cool :)

2007-07-10T07:00:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	any idea?
2007-07-10T07:00:00.000Z	caseofthemondays	shirish	it really looks like the system isnt detecting the mouse ... and you have some serious problem with that broadcom network card ..
2007-07-10T07:00:00.000Z	caseofthemondays	shirish	 do you have another usb mouse you can try ?
2007-07-10T07:01:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	that I know about, the broadcom network card
2007-07-10T07:01:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	not atm no
2007-07-10T07:02:00.000Z	caseofthemondays	shirish	it really looks like a hardware issue, or something wrong in the usb automouting system.  if a reboot doesnt fix it I would lead to a hardware problem.  without getting my hands on it I can't be a lot more help.  sorry
2007-07-10T07:02:00.000Z	shirish	caseofthemondays	issue solved, the other usb port seems to have an issue, taking out the printer & using that port for the mouse works
