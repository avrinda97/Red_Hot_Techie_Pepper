2005-04-30T14:26:00.000Z	kakalto		ahh
2005-04-30T14:26:00.000Z	kakalto		under Windows, they got the right idea (from konq) about integrating explorer, internet, etc.
2005-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	kakalto		yeah
2005-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	kakalto		I find kde easier than gnome
2005-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	kakalto		maybe because everything points to the Control Panel
2005-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	kakalto		instead of just every setting all over the place
2005-04-30T14:29:00.000Z	kakalto		but because of some file in my home dir, gnome won't run
2005-04-30T14:29:00.000Z	kakalto		I wiped everything except for my home dir, and installed hoary from start
2005-04-30T14:31:00.000Z	kakalto		ahk.
2005-04-30T14:31:00.000Z	kakalto		I messed around with XFCE, and the next thing I knew was that GNOME wouldn't load
2005-04-30T14:32:00.000Z	Pirkei	kakalto	- how would you change all instances of warty to hoary in the CLI?
2005-04-30T14:33:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	what's CLI?
2005-04-30T14:34:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	you wouldn't
2005-04-30T14:34:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	I said in the repositories, which are in /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-04-30T14:42:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	of course it is :D
2005-04-30T15:02:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	I heard so, yeah
2005-04-30T15:19:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	got k3b?
2005-04-30T15:19:00.000Z	kakalto	Pirkei	k3b is a really good cd/dvd burning program
