2008-01-21T02:15:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	My ubuntu unstall
2008-01-21T02:18:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	any ideas? :-/
2008-01-21T02:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	don't even know what the prob is.
2008-01-21T02:20:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	I guess it got lost in all the chatter so you didn't see it: I've reinstalled twice now, and still the system hangs at "* Running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)                                  [ OK ]" on boot up
2008-01-21T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	have you tried disableing apci?
2008-01-21T02:21:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	I'm not sure what that is or how to disable it
2008-01-21T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	it has to be done on the bootline, an truthfully, i'm not sure how to do it, i imagine LJL does
2008-01-21T02:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	can you get to a command prompt if you boot in safe mode?
2008-01-21T02:23:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	I didn't even know ubuntu had a safe mode, how do I get there?
2008-01-21T02:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	when you reboot, you'll see your grub menu(if you don't, hit esc till you do), you have 2 options, 1 is regular, 1 is recovery mode..
2008-01-21T02:24:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	I can get to the recovery console via the install CD
2008-01-21T02:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	but can you do it from your grub menu was the question..
2008-01-21T02:25:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	no, I cannot see my grub menu, this is on a box three thousand miles away, it goes by in the blink of an eye
2008-01-21T02:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	well, if you hit Esc(It should give you a 2sec countdown), you'll see two menu options, the first one is the main one, the second one is recovery mode.
2008-01-21T02:26:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	ok got it
2008-01-21T02:28:00.000Z	KrisWood	IndyGunFreak	ok I'm at a prompt in recovery mode :D
2008-01-21T02:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	KrisWood	ok, so youre system is installed, now, you're probably gonna have to edit your /boot/menu.lst to turn off apci... now to do that though, i don't know, like i said, ask LjL, i'm guessing she knows.
