2007-09-08T14:49:00.000Z	ipx1		Hello -- sorry for bothering everyone here, but I would like to know if anyone has been successful in getting a linksys PCMCIA card (WPC54GS) to work with the latest version of this distro.  I have tried to do it via the website (went through NDISWRAPPER) etc -- so I want to know if anyone here has done it.
2007-09-08T14:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	i have a PCMCIA card that works with ndiswrapper
2007-09-08T14:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	Linksys, forgot wut model tho
2007-09-08T14:50:00.000Z	ipx1		scguy310:  is your card WPC54GS ?
2007-09-08T14:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	lemme see
2007-09-08T14:51:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	WPC54G v1.2
2007-09-08T14:51:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	ndiswrapper works 4 me
2007-09-08T14:52:00.000Z	ipx1	scguy318	(sorry didn't look at screen up close): I attempted to load ndiswrapper and it didn't work.  If you don't mind, what steps did you take?
2007-09-08T14:53:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	i followed the steps on that Ubuntu Wiki ndiswrapper guide
2007-09-08T14:53:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	you have to remember to blacklist the alternate driver module
2007-09-08T14:54:00.000Z	ipx1	scguy318	?
2007-09-08T14:54:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	i added blacklist bcm43xx to the end of my /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-09-08T14:55:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	because ndiswrapper -l as alternate driver that conflicts with ndiswrapper
2007-09-08T14:55:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	shows it
2007-09-08T14:55:00.000Z	ipx1	scguy318	 ok I will give that a shot.
2007-09-08T14:55:00.000Z	ipx1	scguy318	 thanks.
2007-09-08T14:56:00.000Z	scguy318	ipx1	to check if your wireless card driver has loaded properly, ndiswrapper -l
2007-09-08T14:56:00.000Z	ipx1	scguy318	 ok -- checking now....
