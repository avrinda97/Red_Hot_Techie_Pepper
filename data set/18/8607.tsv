2007-07-24T15:20:00.000Z	quaal2		hello does anyone know how to completely remove a program? i am trying to remove vmware that i installed from the default sources.list
2007-07-24T15:20:00.000Z	quaal2		i'm getting an error when trying to install from the updated sources.list
2007-07-24T15:20:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	use aptitude to purge it
2007-07-24T15:20:00.000Z	quaal2	jonatan	h1st0 i did sudo apt-get remove --purge vmware-player
2007-07-24T15:20:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	aptitude remove <package> will remove it but leave teh configuration files, use purge if you want to remoe those as well
2007-07-24T15:21:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	oh, ok, usually aptitude is a bit better at removing stuff than apt-get because it handles dependancies a bit differently
2007-07-24T15:22:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	I strongly recomend using aptitude rather than apt-get for package management. especially is you are not uite sure what you are doing
2007-07-24T15:23:00.000Z	quaal2	jonatan	i am pretty used to apt-get
2007-07-24T15:23:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	it works okish for installing stuff, but aptitude is better when you remove it
2007-07-24T15:23:00.000Z	quaal2	jonatan	ok i'll keep that in mind
2007-07-24T15:24:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	basically when aptitude installs dependancies it marks them as automatically installed, so it will clean up after itself when you remove the stuff that needs it
2007-07-24T15:24:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	I'm afraid I can't help you with vmware don't have much experiencewith it
2007-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	most likely what has happened is that some dependancies or configuration files have been left over
2007-07-24T15:27:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	run aptitude in graphical mode and search through for packages that contain "vm-ware" and make sure they are uninstalled
2007-07-24T15:27:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	you may also want to check the support forums for vm-ware
2007-07-24T15:30:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	unfortunately I'm on a windoze box at the moment so it is hard for me to check what youc an do , but you coudl try apt-get autoremove
2007-07-24T15:30:00.000Z	quaal2	jonatan	yea i've tried that one too
2007-07-24T15:31:00.000Z	jonatan	quaal2	in that case I'd suggest you try a forum specific to vm-ware , maybe they know what coudl cause that error message
