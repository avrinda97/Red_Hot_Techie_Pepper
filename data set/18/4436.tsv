2009-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	he switched from ati to nvidia
2009-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	what is ckw's prob?  ATI ?
2009-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	ahh, good move! :)  I hate ati. :)
2009-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	he's got no video now...
2009-10-01T08:44:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	i stopped buying ati cards years ago
2009-10-01T08:44:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	I never knew and got stuck with one in my laptop, last one I will ever own
2009-10-01T09:20:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	it would depend on his settings in the Bios
2009-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	he is a complete computer noob
2009-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	what is his issue?
2009-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	a lot of cpu usage
2009-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	could be sys monitor bug, but I doubt it, I always use sys monitor, and never have a prob
2009-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	hm, has he tried 'top' ??
2009-10-01T09:34:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	he had a hard time finding the terminal, and couldn't copy and paste commands
2009-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	i almost hate to say try another distro, but Mint is top notch for beginners
2009-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	I think it is something else eating cpu, but we didn't get far
2009-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	gotta run, catch you all later
2009-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	jjrev	he has an older ati card, my hunch is ati probs
2009-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	jjrev	shane2peru	thanks, i'll have a go at it
