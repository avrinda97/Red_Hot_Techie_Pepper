2005-04-20T13:42:00.000Z	gurum0232		any Asian here running ubuntu? (with Asian language support fully enabled)?
2005-04-20T13:44:00.000Z	gurum0232		I am running scim, but I can't get the short cut to work... :(
2005-04-20T13:45:00.000Z	gurum0232		hmm. special way?
2005-04-20T13:45:00.000Z	gurum0232		oh... do I have to modify .xsession?
2005-04-20T13:46:00.000Z	gurum0232		hmm.. and that'll enable me to use "shift + space" to change input methods? thanks.. :)
2005-04-20T13:48:00.000Z	gurum0232		ah.. love live synapic.. so cool.
2005-04-20T13:48:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	oddly enough, i rarely use synaptic
2005-04-20T13:51:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	"trying out" since debian 0.9?
2005-04-20T13:59:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	that's not necessarily true.. linux is just great with 9500, 9700, and 9800.. but for some reason, they seem to have forgotten that the 9600 exists
2005-04-20T14:00:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	that's a yes and no situation
2005-04-20T14:29:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	vmware in... windows?
2005-04-20T14:38:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	if he's an fps gamer, then yes, he needs the 15hz
2005-04-20T14:41:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	because watching tv is very different from fps gaming
2005-04-20T14:42:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	splendid! care to donate me a $50 17" monitor?
2005-04-20T14:42:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	that's not fps gaming
2005-04-20T14:42:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	hehe.. ok then just donate the $50 and i'll find the monitor :-p
2005-04-20T14:45:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	... radiation.. daughters.. you are nutty
2005-04-20T14:48:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	gurum0232	mmmmmm.. wetwire
