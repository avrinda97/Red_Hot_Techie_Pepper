2012-06-23T03:16:00.000Z	schnuffle	r3dLunchb0x_	so you have two nics on the same switch?
2012-06-23T03:16:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x_	schnuffle	yeah, 2 different servers.
2012-06-23T03:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	r3dLunchb0x_	okay so two server each with a nic on the same switch and what is the problem?
2012-06-23T03:18:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x_		not getting a ping response, server1 IP 192.168.1.19, server2 IP 192.168.1.30...routes are setup according to the nic's usign those IP's

2012-06-23T03:19:00.000Z	schnuffle	r3dLunchb0x_	 paste /etc/network/interfaces
2012-06-23T03:19:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x_	schnuffle	done on the command line as this will be temporary....want the ifconfig -a?
2012-06-23T03:19:00.000Z	schnuffle		!paste
2012-06-23T03:21:00.000Z	schnuffle		yep
2012-06-23T03:23:00.000Z	schnuffle	r3dLunchb0x_	does one of the servers has more nics
2012-06-23T03:24:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x_	schnuffle	both servers have multiple nics
2012-06-23T03:24:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x_	schnuffle	these nics have never been used before
2012-06-23T03:24:00.000Z	schnuffle	r3dLunchb0x_	aha, but each server has only one active, the one connected to the switch?
2012-06-23T03:25:00.000Z	schnuffle		I'm off for 10 minutes
2012-06-23T03:25:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x_	schnuffle	no the eth0 on both hosts are active and have different IP's and are connected to a different switch which I have no access too
