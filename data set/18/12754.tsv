2006-09-12T13:30:00.000Z	kditty		how do i chmod a drive to gain write access?
2006-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	cdubya	kditty	are you wanting to just have certain folders with write access or the whole drive?
2006-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	kditty	cdubya	the whole drive, its installed and sys/administration/disks shows the drive, but i cant write to it, and its not mounted
2006-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	cdubya	kditty	what filesystem is it?
2006-09-12T13:34:00.000Z	kditty		under disks it says ext3, but if i fdisk, it says ntfs cdubya
2006-09-12T13:35:00.000Z	cdubya		!ntfs > kditty
2006-09-12T13:35:00.000Z	kditty		!ntfs
2006-09-12T13:36:00.000Z	kditty	cdubya	i formated the drive to be ext3 so that i can write to it. i dont have windows anymore
2006-09-12T13:36:00.000Z	cdubya	kditty	if it's ntfs, you won't be able to write to it....but you can mount and read......
2006-09-12T13:36:00.000Z	cdubya	kditty	ah
2006-09-12T13:36:00.000Z	cdubya	kditty	so you just want to mount that?
2006-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	kditty		cdub, yes... and be able to write to the drive
2006-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	cdubya		!mount
2006-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	cdubya		err
2006-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	kditty	cdubya	for some reason its working now, after i hit enable under 'disks'
2006-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	cdubya	kditty	kewl.
2006-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	kditty		thanks for the help man
