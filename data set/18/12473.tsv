2006-04-17T08:18:00.000Z	bluemermaid		So, yeah, does anyont know what I can do about the Failed to find mountpoint for device /dev/hdd in /etc/fstab message?
2006-04-17T08:19:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	does the mount point exist? like if it is trynig to mount to /media/dvd, does that folder exsit?
2006-04-17T08:20:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	yes... It worked fine just fine yesterday.
2006-04-17T08:20:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	so the folder is there?
2006-04-17T08:21:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	Yes, it's there.
2006-04-17T08:21:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	pastebin your fstab file please
2006-04-17T08:22:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12062
2006-04-17T08:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	and you are sure /media/cdrom1 exists?
2006-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	Yes. I looked in the /media/ folder and it's there.
2006-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	can you think of any sort of hint on what you might have done?
2006-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	the only thing I can imagine is enabling the DMA or whatever, the guide on the wiki.
2006-04-17T08:26:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	try turning it off.. not sure why that would matter but maybe
2006-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	Huh, well... It's working now.
2006-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	turned of dma?
2006-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	yeah
2006-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	NickGarvey	bluemermaid	not sure why that happened..
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	bluemermaid	NickGarvey	and strangely, it isn't being all jerky like it was without the DMA last night >.>
