2011-05-26T09:56:00.000Z	chandler12304		first time here ... can anybody help me
2011-05-26T09:58:00.000Z	chandler12304		I am totally new to linux. I've just istalled natty N. from a CD. The screen is almost (and I mean almost) black. Using a flashlight I can make out symbols and "ubuntu"
2011-05-26T09:59:00.000Z	chandler12304		yes its a new laptop
2011-05-26T10:01:00.000Z	chandler12304		what would a backlight key look like? I booted it from a CD, the moment I punched "install" it went black
2011-05-26T10:03:00.000Z	chandler12304		yes it is a laptop
2011-05-26T10:05:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	try fn and the left right arrow keys.
2011-05-26T10:16:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	you get the grub menu correct?
2011-05-26T10:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	do y9u have a external monitor you can plug in?
2011-05-26T10:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	your problem is unusual it did have no screen back-light to begin with but yet you installed anyway. Have you any other live cd"s of other distros to confirm the screen works?
2011-05-26T10:29:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	to see grub you need the flashlight correct?
2011-05-26T10:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	whenI  asked you earlier you said no, chose the recovery line and boot at the gui choose the faixsafe x boot
2011-05-26T10:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	hit boot at the gui that comes up choose the safe boot 4th or 5th line down.
2011-05-26T10:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	it is a safe graphics it may get you in, to look for a graphics driver
2011-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	correct but you have a back light right?
2011-05-26T10:36:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	I would try another live cd this is going nowhere it has not worked since you booted the install cd
2011-05-26T10:40:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	you could try upadating by choosing the command rootnet line in that recovery gui and running sudo apt-get update &&  sudo aptget upgrade.    then reboot and see if you have a back light.
2011-05-26T10:41:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	you have to be plugged in wuth ether net to updtae
2011-05-26T10:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	chandler12304	the command is sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
