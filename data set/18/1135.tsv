2011-08-11T17:05:00.000Z	tightwork		so is --reinstall install deprecated?
2011-08-11T17:06:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	why?  man page in 11.04 seems ok with it
2011-08-11T17:07:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	nvm, pebcak
2011-08-11T17:17:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	how did you install django?
2011-08-11T17:18:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	 apt-get  install python-django
2011-08-11T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	apt would never enter /usr/local/.  Do you have some custom python install maybe?
2011-08-11T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	what do you have in /usr/local/?
2011-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	what's in bin and lib?
2011-08-11T17:22:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	 http://dpaste.com/592012/
2011-08-11T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	well these are not from apt and are the the likely cause of your current woes
2011-08-11T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	run "hash -r"
2011-08-11T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	you should not have /usr/local/bin/python
2011-08-11T17:59:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	indeed, just as you said before.
2011-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	yes! hash -r worked! thanks  everything looks back to normal and can import django.. you rock
2011-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	what happend there btw?
2011-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	no problem.  New terminal would have worked too ;)
2011-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	tightwork	jrib	i thought it was a term problem, tried source /etc/profile... different stuffs..
2011-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	tightwork	when you typed "python" bash remembered python was in /usr/local/bin/python so tried that again
