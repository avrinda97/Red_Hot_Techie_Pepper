2005-02-12T09:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	Croccifixio	 you can run a cli irc client (like irssi) under screen, and then attach to that from your x session i guess
2005-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Croccifixio	 i do connect to another non-gui box, where i have irssi running under screen
2005-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Croccifixio	 if you run it on the non-gui box, you can connect from that gui box, if you like
2005-02-12T09:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	Croccifixio	 make it so that gdm doesn't start
