2010-08-07T22:58:00.000Z	Sandje		hello, anybody  can tell me if you mount /mnt and /mnt/boot you get the same things but in /mnt/boot you should see the kernel for example config-2.6.31-10-generic but i dont have it
2010-08-07T23:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	well you mounted some partition that should have /mnt/boot in it but it's not there?
2010-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	maybe I need the whole command you gave it
2010-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	sounds good
2010-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	but /dev/sdb6 has windows?
2010-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	opps ok sorry missed that above
2010-08-07T23:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	ok you ls /mnt and don't see the /mnt/boot dir
2010-08-07T23:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 ok from what I see seems your system files are ok but the grub2 is mest up
2010-08-07T23:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 do you have a ubuntu live cd boot disk?
2010-08-07T23:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 can you boot your live ubuntu cd?
2010-08-07T23:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 ok well I see a problem that I'm not used to playing with your ubuntu is not on your sda drive
2010-08-07T23:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 it's not imposible to configure grub to boot from there
2010-08-07T23:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 what version of ubuntu are we booting
2010-08-07T23:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 it must be lucid
2010-08-07T23:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 I asume you didn't override and make it boot with the old grub and now uses grub2
2010-08-07T23:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 well I think you can just boot the live cd and reinstall grub
2010-08-07T23:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 oh your running on it now
2010-08-07T23:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	Sandje	 no problem I'll go private see my private mesage
