2006-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	vinboy		happy dapper day
2006-06-01T11:04:00.000Z	vinboy		should I get a p4 or amd64?
2006-06-01T11:04:00.000Z	vinboy		i don't do much gaming
2006-06-01T11:04:00.000Z	vinboy		ok
2006-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	Saj	vinboy	amd64 is better....get x2 though
2006-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	vinboy		sounds good to me
2006-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	vinboy	Saj	x2 is expensive :(
2006-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	vinboy		ic
2006-06-01T11:06:00.000Z	vinboy		ok i prolly go check out the x2 then, thanks guys
2006-06-01T11:06:00.000Z	Saj	vinboy	i know but 1 3200 x2 is wquivilant of 2 3200 64s...
2006-06-01T11:06:00.000Z	vinboy		by the way, do u guys run 64bit ubuntu? if not, what is the gain of getting an amd64 cpu?
2006-06-01T11:07:00.000Z	vinboy	Saj	wow, tat sound amazing!
2006-06-01T11:07:00.000Z	Saj		64bit cpu is a difrent asepct of the thing
2006-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	Saj	vinboy	you see the the chip actualy works 32bit, every single part of it, but every bufer has 32 bits extra and if there is something above 32 bits that particuler buffer thingi switches to 64bit....so its basicly two things in one..the amd core is clocked slower, this is better because it makes less heat and thus is more overclockable, the other advantage is the memory controller which is on the chip, this optimises the ram and thus makes the system mroe e
2006-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	Saj		fficient and faster.
2006-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	Saj		eta = 7hrs aprox then:D
2006-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	vinboy		thanks Saj
2006-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	Saj	vinboy	pleasure
