2005-09-05T14:58:00.000Z	lucaz		I'm looking for a comic book reader like cdisplay, do you know one?
2005-09-05T14:59:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	"comix.sourceforge.net"
2005-09-05T15:00:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	if you search sourceforge for "comic book archive", you'll get a lot of choices
2005-09-05T15:00:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	really? you found on in the repos?
2005-09-05T15:00:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	I'll take a look..
2005-09-05T15:01:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	I didnt ...
2005-09-05T15:01:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	me neither, but was hopin
2005-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	anyway, sourceforge has all kinds of cbr, cbz and cbt viewers
2005-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	 yeah, but I didnt want to install by a tar ball...
2005-09-05T15:03:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	installing from source is not that diffecult, and allows you (in some cases) to custom make your program
2005-09-05T15:03:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	none of the comic viewers are hard to compile at all
2005-09-05T15:04:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	I know, but what about the dependencies?
2005-09-05T15:04:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	use "checkinstall" instead of "make install" and you'll be doin yourself a favor
2005-09-05T15:04:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	ok..
2005-09-05T15:04:00.000Z	nalioth_wrkn	lucaz	comix.sourceforge.net depends on gtk, pygtk and some other simple thing (that i think is already on your box)
2005-09-05T15:05:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	why I cant extract the rar comic file?
2005-09-05T15:11:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	I installed comix, but can't make it work..
2005-09-05T15:11:00.000Z	lucaz	nalioth_wrkn	output 'unrar: invalid archive 'x': Bad address'
