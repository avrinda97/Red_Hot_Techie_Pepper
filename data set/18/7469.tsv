2008-01-05T01:32:00.000Z	boivie		Does anybody know why I can't get sound out of an MPEG4 file? It is supposed to have Audio Codec    : AAC 44100Hz stereo 128Kbps. I have tried two ubuntu installations, and Totem, Xine, VLC and MPlayer. The same story everywhere, video is fine, but no audio.
2008-01-05T01:32:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	install libfaad
2008-01-05T01:33:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	I have libfaad2-0 installed.
2008-01-05T01:34:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	does vlc play it?
2008-01-05T01:34:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	every player plays the movie, but all are silent.
2008-01-05T01:35:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	i dont mean to pry, but other sounds work right?
2008-01-05T01:35:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	sound is fine when I play other movies.
2008-01-05T01:36:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	vlc should work
2008-01-05T01:37:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	it might be the file that is corrupted then?
2008-01-05T01:38:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	try another one, but doubt it
2008-01-05T01:38:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	I only have one file of that type. Yet. :(
2008-01-05T01:39:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	so you get no sound with vlc?
2008-01-05T01:39:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	with that mp4-file I get no sound in vlc, that is correct.
2008-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	sudo aptitude install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad|ugly|etc
2008-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	oh are you sure it has sound?
2008-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	I'm pretty sure, It's from a TV-program.
2008-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	khermans	boivie	try to use faad to convert it
2008-01-05T02:05:00.000Z	boivie	khermans	Now I found out that it actually was no sound in that file. :( Sorry for bothering you, and thanks for your help anyway.
