2005-04-08T08:30:00.000Z	black_nightmare	crimsun	in general: creative sb16 pnp isa card > I'm trying to get it loaded so I can see the card in ubuntu yet
2005-04-08T08:30:00.000Z	crimsun	black_nightmare	what sound card?
2005-04-08T08:30:00.000Z	crimsun	black_nightmare	sudo modprobe snd-sb16 isapnp=0

2005-04-08T08:34:00.000Z	black_nightmare	crimsun	once (under 98se anyhow that is) it was not even picking up the usb hub for no reason at bootup...so....I was like peering at back of computer going "huhhhh???" and decidely yank the usb cable out then plug it back in and immedately windows went into 'detecting new hardwares..' dialog for a second there
2005-04-08T08:34:00.000Z	crimsun	black_nightmare	otherwise I need lspnp -v information
2005-04-08T08:37:00.000Z	black_nightmare	crimsun	- its just that if 98se picked it up with no problem it has to be PnP-abled .... or am I actually very wrong? :p
2005-04-08T08:38:00.000Z	crimsun	black_nightmare	you're actually very wrong.
2005-04-08T08:41:00.000Z	black_nightmare	crimsun	here we are and mine's CT2230 just for the info anyhow http://www.rk86.com/th99/i/C-D/53581.htm
