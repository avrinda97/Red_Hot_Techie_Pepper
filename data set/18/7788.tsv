2009-06-16T02:04:00.000Z	polpak		Anyone know if there's any configuration changes needed to connect to a remote server (not linux) from an ubuntu workstation using XDMCP ?
2009-06-16T02:04:00.000Z	polpak		I'm just getting a black screen when I connect
2009-06-16T02:04:00.000Z	polpak		Or, barring that, just an explaination of the protocol/connection proceedure would be good
2009-06-16T02:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	If you really want to do that, then read the man page for gdm.conf,  enable the XDMCP chooser, and set AllowAdd=true
2009-06-16T02:08:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	th0r: It's connecting to a OpenVMS system, and I don't administrate it, so I can't switch to X-forwarding over ssh =(
2009-06-16T02:08:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	What does AllowAdd=true do?
2009-06-16T02:09:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	It lets your users enter a host name for the remote XDMCP host.
2009-06-16T02:09:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	Or you can create an ini [section] for pre-defined hosts.
2009-06-16T02:10:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	oh. Well XDMCP chooser is coming up fine, and the host is listed there already.. But when attempting to connect it does not give me the hosts login prompt. Just shows me a blank x server with a cursor and sits there.
2009-06-16T02:10:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	What is the remote host running?  Many systems will require appropriate hosts.allow or hosts.deny entries.
2009-06-16T02:11:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	OpenVMS. And it's not a security setting afaict, because these workstations worked fine using a very old version of fedora to connect
2009-06-16T02:12:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	Check the X11 versions.  You may need to do things like disable extensions on the Linux side to connect to an old system.
2009-06-16T02:12:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	unless something needs to be configured on the workstation to allow the xdm on the OpenVMS machine to talk to the ubuntu machine.
2009-06-16T02:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	You should also confirm that a direct DISPLAY= X11 session works properly.
2009-06-16T02:14:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	For example,  run `xhost +`,  telnet into the OpenVMS server,  set DISPLAY=mylinuxcomputer:0.0, and run xterm or some other simple program.
2009-06-16T02:15:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	ok, yeah
2009-06-16T02:15:00.000Z	dajhorn	polpak	If a direct X11 connection doesn't work, then XDMCP won't work.
2009-06-16T02:15:00.000Z	polpak	dajhorn	yep
