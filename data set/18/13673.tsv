2006-02-26T17:00:00.000Z	axisys		i want to take those images and put it together to create a new diagram
2006-02-26T17:00:00.000Z	axisys		but dia does not allow import images
2006-02-26T17:01:00.000Z	axisys		oodraw2?
2006-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	axisys		anyone know of a good calendar app that I can use with my work imap/exchange server ... or some app to fetch the calendar? i am keep missing my schedule meetings
2006-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	I use evolution (with kalarm too)
2006-02-26T09:53:00.000Z	axisys	Xenguy	how do u like it?
2006-02-26T09:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	that's a LookOut'ish email app
2006-02-26T09:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	it's buggy but it's good enough, will probably get better, and it's all I have right now :-)
2006-02-26T09:53:00.000Z	axisys		so when u have a schedule meeting in calendar does it pop up in time?
2006-02-26T09:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	I just find it slow too, so it takes patience, but it does the job
2006-02-26T09:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	the pop-up doesn't work for me ATM, so I use kalarm each day to set pop-up alarms
2006-02-26T09:54:00.000Z	axisys		for email i am using mutt to read the exchange imap files.. just the calendar functionality is missing
2006-02-26T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	I just wanted something that could do Exchange on linux - evolution is one option that works
2006-02-26T09:56:00.000Z	axisys		anyone else have a solution for exchange calendar? i will check out kalarm that Xenguy uses
2006-02-26T09:57:00.000Z	axisys		!exchange
2006-02-26T09:57:00.000Z	Xenguy	axisys	I just assume that the evolution pop-ups will be fixed eventually
2006-02-26T09:57:00.000Z	axisys		!calendar
2006-02-26T09:57:00.000Z	axisys	Xenguy	i am sure soon it will
