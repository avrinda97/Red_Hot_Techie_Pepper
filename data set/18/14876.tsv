2005-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	Nomikos		is there a page somewhere that explains how to upgrade to breezy via apt-get?
2005-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	Nomikos		can't find any :-(
2005-10-19T05:51:00.000Z	Nomikos		was upgrading via apt-get but lost network, so for a lot of packages it shows timeout errors now.. will it fetch those later?
2005-10-19T05:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	it will carry on from where it got to, don't worry.
2005-10-19T05:53:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	try using "ftp://" instead of "http://" in your /etc/apt/sources.list - that can help if the web server is overloaded
2005-10-19T05:53:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	is was my router that went down :-.
2005-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	but filed for future reference :)
2005-10-19T06:34:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	yes
2005-10-19T06:34:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	it will resume
2005-10-19T06:34:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	this apt-get thing is scarily intelligent..
2005-10-19T06:42:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	sorry, i try to ask as little as possible but keep coming back.. *how* do i add the cd to that file?
2005-10-19T06:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	now you're asking!  maybe you put "deb       file:/media/iso/ubuntu/              breezy          main restricted" in /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2005-10-19T06:45:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	i'll try that, thanks. did you get that online somewhere?
2005-10-19T06:46:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	if so, where and i'll write it down :)
2005-10-19T06:46:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	no.  I got that from my own sources.list, which I got when I installed hoary.  I've since replaced 'hoary' with 'breezy' and commented that CD line out...
2005-10-19T06:46:00.000Z	dooglus	Nomikos	hence the '?' at the end of my suggestion...  but it looks like it should work, don't you think?
2005-10-19T06:46:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	ok, thanks. i'll backup the file next time i change it..
2005-10-19T06:47:00.000Z	Nomikos	dooglus	aye it does
