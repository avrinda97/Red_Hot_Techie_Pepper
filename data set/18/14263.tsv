2005-08-30T08:18:00.000Z	dbee		Why does this connection string in scripts give me a can't stat source package list "http://seavas.ubuntulinux.nl/ ubuntu universe" ... pls help !
2005-08-30T08:20:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	probably 'cos you spelt seveas wrong. :)
2005-08-30T08:22:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	ya, sorry about that ... I miss spelt it on the irc only though ... the real connection string is ok
2005-08-30T08:23:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	why not ask the man himself?  (this is the 1st i've heard of Seveas having his own repo!) :)
2005-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	what instructions are you following anyway? the wiki for java points to this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JavaPackageBuildNewVersions
2005-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	that's probably a good idea, he was on here earlier and I would have thought that he'd mention if his server was down ... on the otherhand though he may not have known himself
2005-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	i can't see any mention of a seveas repo in that
2005-08-30T08:27:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	I've been surfing the net most of the day, I got the instructions from here actually ... about 2hrs ago
2005-08-30T08:27:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	define 'here'. :)
2005-08-30T08:27:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	here as in #ubuntu irc
2005-08-30T08:28:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	maybe i should've asked "who"? :)
2005-08-30T08:29:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	I wanted to use a repository if possible because I'm having a bit of trouble with the development tools .. namely the make program that is there - but isn't actually there at all ... I'm a bit of a unix newbie !
2005-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	seavas himself was posting here a while ago, I presume that it was the man himself
2005-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	i would assume so
2005-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	for make, you can install build-essential
2005-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	but if you want to install java, i'd just follow the wiki
2005-08-30T08:32:00.000Z	dbee	brenner	ya, I installed build-essential but I still have a make problem somewhere ... anyway I think you are right, I'll try the wiki method ... thanks and all the best
2005-08-30T08:33:00.000Z	brenner	dbee	hopefully your future experiences with linux aren't as frustrating :)
