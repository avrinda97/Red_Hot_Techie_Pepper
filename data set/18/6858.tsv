2008-03-12T18:58:00.000Z	kthakore		what is the best supported video card on ubuntu (preferably some of the newer ones)?
2008-03-12T18:59:00.000Z	Jaapjan2	kthakore	It depends on who you ask. I'd say Nvidia if you want halfway decent 3d performance too.
2008-03-12T19:00:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	how about the nvidia 8600 XFX gt?
2008-03-12T19:00:00.000Z	Jaapjan2		Should work fine.
2008-03-12T19:00:00.000Z	Jaapjan2		With the driver from Envy or the restricted driver.
2008-03-12T19:00:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	no stupid ati crap?
2008-03-12T19:00:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	no stupid ati -like crap?
2008-03-12T19:01:00.000Z	Jaapjan2	kthakore	I have an ati card. But I have had trouble with it since .. well .. a long time.
2008-03-12T19:01:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	are there any benchmarks for different nvidia cards on ubuntu?
2008-03-12T19:02:00.000Z	Jaapjan2	kthakore	Generally you can use the windows benchmarks and simply subtract x% in performance. The relative performance should be the same since they're unified drivers, mostly.
2008-03-12T19:03:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	x% ?
2008-03-12T19:03:00.000Z	Jaapjan2	kthakore	Yes, x percent. Unknown amount.
2008-03-12T19:03:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	10-20% or more like 80-- 90%?
2008-03-12T19:05:00.000Z	Jaapjan2	kthakore	No no! Don't quote me but I'd say 10-20%
2008-03-12T19:05:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	oh thats fine
2008-03-12T19:05:00.000Z	kthakore	Jaapjan2	I get that much back in my mem and CPU performance so its an okay trade
2008-03-12T19:06:00.000Z	kthakore		Jgon
2008-03-12T19:06:00.000Z	Jaapjan2	kthakore	Righto.
