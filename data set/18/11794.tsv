2008-08-03T00:00:00.000Z	Toaster`		question about static IPs.  I'm setting my IP via /etc/network/interfaces (http://pastebin.com/d36f20721) but when usb0 comes up I don't have an IPv4 assigned.  The same setup works properly on my desktop, but this is on my laptop and is causing me grief.  Any ideas?
2008-08-03T00:01:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	have you got an 'auto usb0' line in interfaces?
2008-08-03T00:01:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	up == yup
2008-08-03T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	so you plug the usb device in, but it fails to get the static IP?
2008-08-03T00:04:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	correct
2008-08-03T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	nothing helpful in /var/log/syslog relating to the plug-in event?
2008-08-03T00:06:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	usb0 comes up, but no inet or gateway.  It seems to get a inet6 addr though.  odd
2008-08-03T00:07:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	did you pastebin all of /etc/network/interfaces ?
2008-08-03T00:07:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	the only things left out are the two lo lines
2008-08-03T00:09:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	this is the same setup I have on my desktop, which is why I'm confused as to the problem
2008-08-03T00:09:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	there must be a tiny inconspicuous difference...
2008-08-03T00:10:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	perhaps udev rules capture the device and take precedence over what's in interfaces. I don't understand udev well, but I'd have a look there
2008-08-03T00:11:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	maybe, but both systems are 8.04, so udev should be the same
2008-08-03T00:18:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	solved it
2008-08-03T00:18:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	what was it?
2008-08-03T00:19:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	/etc/network/interfaces was correct, other then I had a tab character instead of spaces for one of the lines
2008-08-03T00:19:00.000Z	soundray	Toaster`	wow, that's worth a bug report. It should treat any whitespace the same
2008-08-03T00:19:00.000Z	Toaster`	soundray	yeah, seems foolish
