2006-12-16T07:03:00.000Z	DARKGuy		hey, quick question: after installing samba, what was the command to make smbmount useable by all users or something like that?
2006-12-16T07:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 you can specify a mount point under /etc/fstab, then all users can mount it... if that's what you're referring to
2006-12-16T07:04:00.000Z	DARKGuy	SilentDis	Uh, nope, and I couldn't understand that either x_x I mean it was something with chown or set the userID or something like that oO
2006-12-16T07:04:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 when I want users to be able to mount partitions, i drop a single line into the /etc/fstab, and they can mount/unmount it at will.
2006-12-16T07:05:00.000Z	DARKGuy	SilentDis	but this is samba, you know, network filesystems :/
2006-12-16T07:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 you can do it with samba filesystems, once samba is installed :)
2006-12-16T07:05:00.000Z	DARKGuy	SilentDis	Oh cool, didn't know that, yay for flexibility :D
2006-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	DARKGuy	SilentDis	thanks for the tip :P
2006-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 do you want it 'always' mounted, or a choice by the user?
2006-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	SilentDis		fozzie:  yikes.  then, yes, i'm surpprised you're pulling 800fps out of glxgears lol
2006-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	DARKGuy	SilentDis	as a choice would be good, I'm using fluxbox and LinNeighborhood, I just don't want to run into problems when I try to mount a shared folder in an XP machine with stuff saying "smbmount must be setuid root" and stuff like that
2006-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 what command do you do, right now, to mount that smb share?
2006-12-16T07:08:00.000Z	DARKGuy	SilentDis	none, I use LinNeighborhood, the samba commandline stuff confuses me to no end
2006-12-16T07:08:00.000Z	SilentDis		fozzie:  I'm surprized it's pushing 800fps.  I would expect lower.  hate to say it, but ATI is hell on wheels under windows, and just poor under linux :(
2006-12-16T07:08:00.000Z	SilentDis		!hello | carutsu
2006-12-16T07:09:00.000Z	SilentDis		fozzie:  i think you're at about the limit that linux can push that card (IE, it's all setup right)
2006-12-16T07:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 you'll have to get your hands a bit dirty to get that mount point in there, i'm sorry to say.
2006-12-16T07:10:00.000Z	SilentDis	DARKGuy	 one main thing I've learned about linux:  you set it up once through a lengthly setup process, and it works forever PERIOD.  hehe
