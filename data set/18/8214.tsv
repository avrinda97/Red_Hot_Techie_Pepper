2007-09-23T13:15:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again		I am experiencing slight problems installing Ubuntu...
2007-09-23T13:15:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again		I have operational discs, but my CD drive refuses to read them, even if it itself has burned them -_-'
2007-09-23T13:16:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again		The discs I have work on another computer but not on the computer where I want to install :/
2007-09-23T13:17:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again		Is it possible to boot Ubuntu from a USB stick?
2007-09-23T13:18:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again		I have a USB memory large enough and my BIOS seems to support some USB boot options
2007-09-23T13:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	Yes
2007-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
2007-09-23T13:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	Oh, I thought you wanted to install Ubuntu *from* USB, not too
2007-09-23T13:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	And I was thinking pen drive not full USB hard drive with a lot of space
2007-09-23T13:22:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again	Jordan_U	So was that what you meant... or what you did not mean? o_O
2007-09-23T13:26:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again	Jordan_U	Or could it be possible that I install Ubuntu on the USB stick with the other computer that can read the CDs and then install it to the actual system by booting from the USB stick?
2007-09-23T13:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	Yes, that is why I gave you the link to the installing on a pen drive, it's easier than installing full Ubuntu on a USB drive and will have the Installer with it since it is basically just a dump of the LiveCD to a pen drive ( or any other USB drive )
2007-09-23T13:29:00.000Z	Frustrated_Again	Jordan_U	But that guide appears to be involving some 1337 h4xor L1nux stuff. I have only Windows computers in my house right now.
2007-09-23T13:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	There are windows instructions on the same page
2007-09-23T13:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	Last time I tried ( admittedly a few years ago ) it takes "1337 h4xor" stuff to install to a USB drive normally also
2007-09-23T13:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	No it does not
2007-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	You tried the windows instructions?
2007-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frustrated_Again	At the bottom of the page
