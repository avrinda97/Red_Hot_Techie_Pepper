2011-10-17T07:35:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		lol. ubiquity created the filesystem (erasing current system) but then failed. now there's no os.
2011-10-17T07:36:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	which CD image? and is the CD good?
2011-10-17T07:36:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	yes, I did md5sum
2011-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	which CD image?
2011-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	it's the 10.04 desktop x86_64
2011-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	sorry, 11.04
2011-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	Try 11.10, and maybe even try x86 if you have 4GB of RAM or less
2011-10-17T07:38:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	I was on 11.10, but I couldn't get pulseaudio to work, and nautilus kept crashing
2011-10-17T07:38:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	I'm downloading the iso now, so we'll see. I don't have a lot of other options
2011-10-17T07:39:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	Okay. You might want to enable proposed this time then.
2011-10-17T07:40:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	I had proposed enabled
2011-10-17T07:40:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	pulseaudio hasn't started since I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10.
2011-10-17T07:41:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	Does 10.04 work?
2011-10-17T07:42:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	I uninstalled all pulse stuff and reinstalled, then I tried uninstalling all of the gnome stuff (had xfce running) and reinstalling, but on reboot, plymouth kept failing
2011-10-17T07:42:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	I don't think I have the iso.
2011-10-17T07:43:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	try the alternate installer then
2011-10-17T07:43:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	GTRsdk	can't. I need live for dmraid
2011-10-17T07:43:00.000Z	GTRsdk	Seven_Six_Two	How much RAM?
