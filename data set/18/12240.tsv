2011-07-26T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	cjhard	ask the guys in #gentoo for gentoo help
2011-07-26T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	cjhard	my logs show you as never being in #gentoo
2011-07-26T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	cjhard	so I suggest you go to #gentoo and ask for help
2011-07-26T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	cjhard	the channel is #gentoo on Freenode
2011-07-26T19:28:00.000Z	ikonia	cjhard	it's called "ubuntu" and "gentoo" please stop changing the names
