2007-12-12T20:56:00.000Z	Whitor		wired network works fine
2007-12-12T20:56:00.000Z	Whitor		switches perfectly
2007-12-12T20:57:00.000Z	Whitor		Yes, I think so
2007-12-12T20:58:00.000Z	Whitor		Administration...
2007-12-12T20:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	Run "iwevent" in a terminal window and try connecting to a wireless network, see if there is any output
2007-12-12T20:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	What "systems" do you mean exactly?
2007-12-12T20:54:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	I didn't type 'systems' ... ???
2007-12-12T20:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	Sorry, services. I mean at what level? Do you want to restart network-manager? reload the kernel modules for your card?
2007-12-12T20:56:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	oh, I'm not sure... both maybe... I know that my card locks onto an SSID on reboot... but won't while the system is already up... so I'd like to restart that section of the OS...
2007-12-12T20:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	Are you using network-manager?
2007-12-12T20:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	( the little applet at the top right of the screen )
2007-12-12T20:57:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	I'm using System -> Adminis -> Network
2007-12-12T20:59:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	ok
2007-12-12T21:00:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	It just says waiting for wireless events from interfaces...
2007-12-12T21:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	What if you run "sudo iwconfig <interface> essid <essid>" where <interface> is something like eth1 or ath0
2007-12-12T21:04:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	could <interface> be wlan0 ?
2007-12-12T21:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Whitor	Yes
2012-06-09T00:01:00.000Z	Whitor	Jordan_U	no idea what <package> this would be... I'm reporting it here. I have my workaround... Just wanted to let others know. Do with it what you will.
