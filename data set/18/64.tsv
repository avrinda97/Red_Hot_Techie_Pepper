2012-10-25T04:58:00.000Z	codephobic		and I'm moving rather than copying
2012-10-25T04:58:00.000Z	codephobic		ok, I just cancelled the transfer, there's 900 that have transferred, hopefully the rest haven't been messed up
2012-10-25T04:59:00.000Z	codephobic		oh
2012-10-25T04:59:00.000Z	codephobic		not good
2012-10-25T05:00:00.000Z	codephobic		well, guess it's time to find out... 4000 - 900 ... hopefully 3100 left.
2012-10-25T05:01:00.000Z	codephobic		is there an upper limit to the number of files and folders nautilus can cope with, within any given folder?
2012-10-25T05:01:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	I haven't been paying attention to what you're doing, but if it's a simple move, it *shouldn't* delete anything that it hasn't already copied over.
2012-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	codephobic	PatrickDickey	that's what I was thinking (hoping) but... given that these are archived articles and stuff I've collected over 10+ years ... I wanted to be sure.
2012-10-25T05:03:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	where are you copying to and from?
2012-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	codephobic	PatrickDickey	I was copying from an old hd Documents (windows xp) folder over to my NAS' documents folder
2012-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	Nautilus was probably bogging down, because it's doing all of the processing on your computer.
2012-10-25T05:06:00.000Z	codephobic	PatrickDickey	I wasn't expecting it to take so long ... and eat so much memory... my ram usage shot up to 5GB+ (of 8GB physical ram)
2012-10-25T05:22:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	http://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/PowerTOP PowerTOP is what I was thinking of. If I remember right, it will allow you to disable the processes from inside of it.
2012-10-25T05:26:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	when you close the terminal, it will kill any processes that are running (nautilus in this case). So you'll want to leave the terminal open while you're doing whatever you need in nautilus.
2012-10-25T05:26:00.000Z	codephobic	PatrickDickey	I ran it via alt+F2
2012-10-25T05:27:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	if everything is alright, my suggestion is to start the move when you get ready for bed (or to leave for a while). That way it's not affecting anything that you're doing.
2012-10-25T05:27:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	codephobic	Alt+F2 is the equivalent of Start --> Run... in Windows.
2012-10-25T05:28:00.000Z	codephobic	PatrickDickey	I'll do that. I'm just surprised that it was an issue ... I didn't think linux would have problems with it, I could have done it in my Windows 7...
