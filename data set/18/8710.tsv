2007-07-17T06:58:00.000Z	JBH		I have an IPod video, and I've tried using both gtkpod and Amarok to play music (most imported from .mp3s to the IPod).  However, I get an error that the files can't be played.  Is there a codecs I can get that supports playing music from the IPod?
2007-07-17T06:59:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	Can you play mp3's from your harddisk?
2007-07-17T07:00:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	then you should not need additional codes. Does your ipod show up as a device in amarok?
2007-07-17T07:02:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	are you sure the files are not in the m4a format?
2007-07-17T07:03:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	what did you use to copy the files onto the ipod?
2007-07-17T07:06:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	It should not have converted the files if they were originally in mp3 format. Can you copy mp3's from your HD to the ipod?
2007-07-17T07:08:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	most strange. Usually when amarok cannot play a file it has to do with unsupported formats and/or codecs not installed. In your case, this does not seem to be the problem, right?
2007-07-17T07:09:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	Nope. If it's mp3 and your ipod is correctly detected in amarok, there should be no problem
2007-07-17T07:10:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	when you first tried to play mp3 in amarok, did it ask if you wanted to install additional codecs?
2007-07-17T07:12:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	see my subsequent question about installing additional codecs when first playing mp3's in amarok
2007-07-17T07:13:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	which distro are you running?
2007-07-17T07:15:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	- just a sec
2007-07-17T07:16:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	do you have libxine1-ffmpeg installed?
2007-07-17T07:17:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	and does it work now?
2007-07-17T07:18:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	it installs all the necessary codecs for a range of audio and video formats
2007-07-17T07:19:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	if playing mp3's from your ipod does not work after installing libxine1-ffmpeg, it is not a codecs problem
2007-07-17T07:22:00.000Z	skollie	JBH	goota go. good luck.
