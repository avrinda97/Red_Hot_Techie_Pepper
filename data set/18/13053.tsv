2006-07-03T16:49:00.000Z	mwe		and that's quite a few
2006-07-03T16:49:00.000Z	mwe		50 or so
2006-07-03T16:50:00.000Z	mwe		good for you. I don't wanna buy that just for using ie when I can just dl ies4linux
2006-07-03T16:51:00.000Z	mwe		I don't _want_ to use IE either. I have to for my web bank
2006-07-03T16:52:00.000Z	mwe		the bank is good. just not their web bank
2006-07-03T16:52:00.000Z	mwe		I'm not gonna switch bank because of that
2006-07-03T16:53:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	when you try firefox with your web bank pages, what sort of errors are there?
2006-07-03T16:54:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	what fails if you don't use MSIE?
2006-07-03T16:58:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	I company I worked for last year had a timesheet web site that said Internet Explorer was needed
2006-07-03T16:59:00.000Z	mwe	jamesstansell	yes?
2006-07-03T16:59:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	when I used the user-agent extension to tell it Firefox was Internet Explorer all the pages worked fine
2006-07-03T05:00:00.000Z	mwe	jamesstansell	well it needs to run some activex scripts I believe
2006-07-03T05:01:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	if it really uses activex, I don't think the Firefox activex plugin works on LInux.  I've never tried MSIE on wine, so I don't know whether ActiveX works there or not
2006-07-03T05:02:00.000Z	mwe	jamesstansell	it does. I'm using it
2006-07-03T05:02:00.000Z	mwe	jamesstansell	I use IE in wine just for the bank
2006-07-03T05:02:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	cool
2006-07-03T05:03:00.000Z	mwe	jamesstansell	it would be way cooler if they were not so lame to provide an IE only solution though
2006-07-03T05:04:00.000Z	jamesstansell	mwe	be sure to let them know that you'd like to see a change
