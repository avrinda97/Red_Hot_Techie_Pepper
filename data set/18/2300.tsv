2010-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	hello_kitty		I made a hello world C program following a tutorial.  When I try to run it by typing ./myprogram I get an error: "cannot execute binary file"  do I need to provide a path to whatever runs binary files, or something....??
2010-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	did you compile it?
2010-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	yes, I caompiled helloworld.c to "myprogram"
2010-06-22T00:27:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	what was the file extension for the program u made and compiled?
2010-06-22T00:28:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	no extension.   I just tried this:  sudo ./myprogram and received an error ./hw: 1: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")     <-- Does this mean it is running...?
2010-06-22T00:28:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	i mean, trying to run, and the program itself has the error  (rather htan not running at all)
2010-06-22T00:29:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	i guess i should also mention that "myprogram" is actually called "hw"
2010-06-22T00:30:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	it sounds like the program its self might have a error
2010-06-22T00:30:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	okay! that's good news  (well, relative to it not being able to run anything)  I'll go tinker with it.  Thanks.
2010-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	im not sure if thats it but it sounds like that could be the problem
2010-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	I pasted my error and the line of code, if that gives any hints: http://pastie.org/1014104
2010-06-22T00:51:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	im going to compile and run it to see if its ur ubuntu box or the program
2010-06-22T00:52:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	I found the error
2010-06-22T00:52:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	the -c compile flag is only if its multiple files
2010-06-22T00:59:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	i just looked irc and saw what you said and yay its fixed! i gcc helloworld.c -o hw then sudo ./hw and it worked
2010-06-22T01:00:00.000Z	hello_kitty	sabuntu	do you happen to know a good way to get shell scripts to produce an output? maybe to get them to write to file if they error?
2010-06-22T01:02:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	im not really good with any type of programing except for some c and perl, so no.
2010-06-22T02:45:00.000Z	sabuntu	hello_kitty	sudo is running a command as root like sudo apt-get
