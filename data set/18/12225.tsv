2008-09-08T17:49:00.000Z	ricc101		Hi can anyone help me on how to install drivers via the terminal?
2008-09-08T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	what drivers ?
2008-09-08T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	there should be documentation with the drivers on what to do / how to use them
2008-09-08T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	what command are you trying to do, and what error
2008-09-08T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	your just doing ./ ???
2008-09-08T17:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	./installer
2008-09-08T17:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	what command does the docs tell you to run
2008-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	it doesn't matter
2008-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	you can make a directory where ever you want
2008-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	you "make" the directory you want
2008-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	then put the files in it
2008-09-08T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	use sudo
2008-09-08T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	follow the instructions with the installer
2008-09-08T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	what part is not working now
2008-09-08T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	show me "ls -la installer"
2008-09-08T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	so if you do "sudo ./installer" what happens ?
2008-09-08T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	install the package "build-essential"
2008-09-08T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ricc101	then you need to get support from the people who make the driver
