2007-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	Chetwin		Same result
2007-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	Chetwin		I run nvidia-xconfig
2007-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	Chetwin		Then restart
2007-03-09T07:12:00.000Z	Chetwin		X wont start
2007-03-09T07:12:00.000Z	Chetwin		With automatix it was working fine on my last install
2007-03-09T07:12:00.000Z	Chetwin		Now that automatix's server is down I can not reinstall it properly
2007-03-09T07:13:00.000Z	Chetwin		So frustrated
2007-03-09T07:13:00.000Z	Chetwin		NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9755-pkg1.run Yes
2007-03-09T07:14:00.000Z	Chetwin		So I'm screwed
2007-03-09T07:14:00.000Z	Chetwin		Awesome
2007-03-09T07:15:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	no, you're not. you just might have to do some manual fun
2007-03-09T07:15:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	you tried installing the driver manually from the nvidia site?
2007-03-09T07:16:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	and now x won't start?
2007-03-19T14:50:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	it only checks the filesystem, not the hardware
2007-03-19T14:50:00.000Z	Chetwin	preaction	How can I check the hardware?
2007-03-19T14:52:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	normally one asks on IRC before private messages
2007-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	do you have SMART enabled in your BIOS?
2007-03-19T14:56:00.000Z	preaction	Chetwin	sudo apt-get install smartmontools <- look up how to use them on google?
