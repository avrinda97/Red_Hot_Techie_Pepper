2009-08-15T07:19:00.000Z	mdg		hello!  Anyone here familiar with an app to playback audio with foot pedal control?
2009-08-15T07:20:00.000Z	mdg		MeRodent: you are trying to install ubuntu to a flash drive or from a flash drive?
2009-08-15T07:21:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	from a flash drive. Trying to set the flash drive up so I can load ubuntu server onto my Revo when I get it.
2009-08-15T07:21:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	do you want a flash drive like a live cd?
2009-08-15T07:21:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	yep.
2009-08-15T07:21:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	I setup my flash drive with unetbootin, ran it live and clicked the "install" icon
2009-08-15T07:22:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	you said ubuntu server version?
2009-08-15T07:23:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	yes. I want to run the netbox as a server - 8.04LTS. Which I'll be able to do from the ISO as long as I can boot off the USB stick.
2009-08-15T07:24:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	have you determined if you computer can boot from a USB stick? How old is it?
2009-08-15T07:25:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	the Revo is an atom 1.6Ghz (processor) powered mini desktop.
2009-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	I would suggest setting up your USB flash drive by using unetbooting - its so easy
2009-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	just looking at the wiki now and it looks like what I'm after.
2009-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	you can use the .iso you already downloaded
2009-08-15T07:27:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	Just a shame that the ubunut help file misses out on such a small detail as to where to get the files.
2009-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	which files - the .iso or unetbootin?
2009-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	not netbootin, the USB memory stick help files in the ubuntu docs.
2009-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	mdg	MeRodent	oh
2009-08-15T07:37:00.000Z	MeRodent	mdg	thanks mate. looks like it's done the trick. :)
