2008-07-09T08:51:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		Ubuntu's help for network stuff says ifup is supposed to do stuff. but ifup eth1 says Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1.
2008-07-09T08:51:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	a "second" network connection? If you have both an ethernet card and an ethernet port on your motherboard, I recommend disabling the mobo port in your BIOS, because Linus may be trying to connect the wrong one
2008-07-09T08:52:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	spoontastic	so I have to disconnect from the internet when I setup my router? :S
2008-07-09T08:54:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	depending on your service provider, PPPoE may be handled completely within the modem, allowing you to treat the connection as if it was cable or fiber
2008-07-09T08:54:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	in other words, you can ignore PPPoE considerations -- depending on how your ISP handles the protocol
2008-07-09T08:55:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	spoontastic	no. it doesn't. I have to do it via software or the router. I need to set up the router because it keeps logging me out of websites every few minutes.
2008-07-09T08:56:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	in that case, it appears that your issue would be with the router, technically, instead of being an Ubuntu support issue
2008-07-09T08:57:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	spoontastic	I can't connect to the router in Ubuntu though.
2008-07-09T08:57:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	I see, then it is an Ubuntu issue :)
2008-07-09T08:58:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	as I mentioned before, if you have an Ethernet card, I recommend plugging the cable into it (of you haven't already), disabling the motherboard-based Ethernet port (if there is one) and seeing what happens
2008-07-09T08:59:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	spoontastic	why specifically use the card instead of the onboard one?
2008-07-09T09:00:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	only because it's easier to disable the mobo port in the BIOS, instead of physically removing the Ethernet card
2008-07-09T09:01:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	if you have two active ports, disabling one makes troubleshooting easier -- although you can just try the other port and see if that works
2008-07-09T09:02:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	unplug the cable from one Ethernet port and stick in the other
2008-07-09T09:03:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	also, many routers are set up at 192.168.0.1, instead of 192.168.1.1
2008-07-09T09:51:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	have you looked at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=82879?
2008-07-09T09:53:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	spoontastic	I HAD pppoe working before. it's working again now. are there some commands you have to use to enable and disable pppoe? I think it mentioned them when I ran pppoeconf, but if I run that again, I'm sure I'll get disconnected from here.
2008-07-09T09:54:00.000Z	spoontastic	Chaotic_Descent	I don't know offhand, sorry
