2007-07-31T08:39:00.000Z	Dr_Link		It completely ignores the ubuntu livecd bootloader and goes to Windows' bootloader.
2007-07-31T08:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		...how would I set this, and is it permanent until it's unset?
2007-07-31T08:41:00.000Z	sapuro	Dr_Link	when  u put the cd in, restart ur computer and keep pressing F12, that should take u to the multi-boot menu
2007-07-31T08:42:00.000Z	sapuro	Dr_Link	hardware restart.completely restart the computer, if it doesnt work, shut it down and then turn it back on, and keep pressing F12
2007-07-31T10:07:00.000Z	sapuro	Dr_Link	hey r u still here?
2007-07-31T10:08:00.000Z	sapuro	Dr_Link	did u manage to get the F12 to the multi-boot options?

2007-07-31T14:47:00.000Z	sapuro	Dr_Link	just because i got desktop effects, doesnt necessarily means that ur system will be really slow :o. I got it enabled in this laptop, and it runs perfectly fast
