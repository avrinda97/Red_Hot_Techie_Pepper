2011-09-03T04:34:00.000Z	sublim21		got a quick question.  im running ubuntu on a netbook. and i got a little panel uptop.  i've somehow moved one of the icons
2011-09-03T04:34:00.000Z	sublim21		and i don't know how to move it back
2011-09-03T04:36:00.000Z	sublim21		i don't have the option to move
2011-09-03T04:37:00.000Z	sublim21		D:
2011-09-03T04:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	sublim21	how did you move it to begin with and what is the icon?
2011-09-03T04:39:00.000Z	sublim21	urlin2u	im not sure how i moved it.  i was trying to get the hdmi to work earlier and my focus wasn't on my netbooks screen
2011-09-03T04:39:00.000Z	sublim21		and the application is jupiter
2011-09-03T04:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	sublim21	is it off try restarting it, or is it somewhere else now?
2011-09-03T04:41:00.000Z	sublim21	urlin2u	i've tried turning it off and on.  it goes back to the same spot.
2011-09-03T04:42:00.000Z	sublim21	urlin2u	nevermind.  i just moved it.  i had to right click NEXT to it, not on it.
2011-09-03T04:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	sublim21	it helps if you give like this information on X desktop I had Jupiter here and now it is here, so at the least this isn't 20 questions.
2011-09-03T04:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	sublim21	cool
2011-09-03T04:44:00.000Z	sublim21	urlin2u	im confused by previous statement
2011-09-03T04:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	sublim21	give a better description, but the very first respnse was the answer. :D
2011-09-03T04:45:00.000Z	sublim21	urlin2u	yes.  couldn't agree more.  stating your problem clearly is of utmost importance.  thanks for the help.  its just odd the little lightening icon takes more space than is obvious
2011-09-03T04:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	sublim21	it's not always easy on your end that's for sure.:D
2011-09-03T04:46:00.000Z	sublim21	urlin2u	true.
