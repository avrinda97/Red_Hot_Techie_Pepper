2006-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	Healot	perezidentt	does the device connected and power on right now?
2006-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	it doesnt have a power button, just plug it in and go
2006-03-27T07:10:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	yes
2006-03-27T07:12:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	so what do I do?
2006-03-27T07:13:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	Yes, it says nothing detected
2006-03-27T07:14:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	xsane scans and doesnt find anything
2006-03-27T07:14:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	well i dident get the install cd with it, but on windows i searched for the driver and downloaded a scanning program
2006-03-27T07:14:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	It works fine on windows
2006-03-27T07:15:00.000Z	Healot	perezidentt	sorry to say this, not supported by sane
2006-03-27T07:16:00.000Z	Healot	perezidentt	run "sane-find-scanner -v -v"
2006-03-27T07:17:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	so what would you recomend doing from here? Is there anyway I can use wine to get it to work?
2006-03-27T07:19:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	do you think if I run that windows scanning program in wine I can get it to work?
2006-03-27T07:22:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	Can I PM you about this to clear the chan abit?
2006-03-27T07:24:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	Did you get my pm?
2006-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	perezidentt	Healot	Can you PM me instead first?
