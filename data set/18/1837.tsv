2010-10-24T11:56:00.000Z	spinningcompass	dudedude	I hear you. However, I did install 10.10 on a Toshiba NB305 (a netbook).
2010-10-24T11:56:00.000Z	dudedude		but there was some kind of a tackle with that piece of software you use to install ubuntu

2010-10-24T11:58:00.000Z	dudedude		so let me reask peoplez on this channel, anyone here got ubuntu installed on a non cdrom netbook?
2010-10-24T11:58:00.000Z	dudedude		i am talking about the new unr release of course
2010-10-24T12:00:00.000Z	spinningcompass	dudedude	No, netbooks tend not to have CD-ROM drives. They do, however, have USB ports, and there are CD-ROM drives that come with USB sockets. :)
2010-10-24T12:03:00.000Z	dudedude	spinningcompass	ill stick to my windows 7 then :o
