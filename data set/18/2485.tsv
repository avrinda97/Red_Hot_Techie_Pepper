2010-05-05T14:16:00.000Z	Gal		Hi every one, I was just wondering if there was any news about the ati proprietary drivers and ubuntu 10.04??
2010-05-05T14:18:00.000Z	wesguin	Gal	I saw a web page yesterday that showed a fix for it... something about fixing the splash
2010-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	Gal	wesguin	fixing the splash? don't know what this is...
2010-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	wesguin	Gal	well its the new one ubuntu switched to
2010-05-05T14:20:00.000Z	Gal	wesguin	ok, so from Radeon to Splash?
2010-05-05T14:23:00.000Z	wesguin	Gal	oh I found it but all it does is fix the ugly splash screen when you install the graphics driver
2010-05-05T14:23:00.000Z	Gal	wesguin	I don't have any problem with that
2010-05-05T14:24:00.000Z	wesguin	Gal	it was awful on my son's toshiba satellite so I disabled the ati radeon driver
2010-05-05T14:24:00.000Z	wesguin	Gal	plus the driver just didn't seen to be working right
2010-05-05T14:25:00.000Z	wesguin	Gal	all the apps worked fine tho
