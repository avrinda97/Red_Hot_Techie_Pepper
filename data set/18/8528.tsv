2007-08-06T12:05:00.000Z	ryphix		I'm having a problem where linux won't boot if the IDE cable is plugged into my CD-ROM drive?  Is it common?
2007-08-06T12:06:00.000Z	hwilde	ryphix	you probably have primary/secondary master/slave conflicts on the cable so it is not recognizing yoru harddrive

2007-08-06T12:07:00.000Z	ryphix	hwilde	i have two hard drive and on a seperate cable i have the cd rom
2007-08-06T12:07:00.000Z	hwilde	ryphix	when they are all plugged in does the bios recognize all the devices
2007-08-06T12:08:00.000Z	ryphix		yes
2007-08-06T12:08:00.000Z	ryphix		windows boots fine

2007-08-06T12:08:00.000Z	hwilde	ryphix	grub probably needs the hda/hdb/hdc/hdd specification corrected.  when you plugin the cdrom it is probably changing the order of the drives
2007-08-06T12:08:00.000Z	ryphix		I haven't lost grub
2007-08-06T12:09:00.000Z	ryphix		okay, ill look into that
2007-08-06T12:09:00.000Z	ryphix		thanks
2007-08-06T12:10:00.000Z	hwilde	ryphix	primary master should be hda, primary slave hdb, secondar master hdc, secondary slave hdd.  this has to be specific in grub and could be changing with the cdrom connected
2007-08-06T12:10:00.000Z	ryphix		not even the live cd will boot when the cd rom is plugged in
2007-08-06T12:10:00.000Z	ryphix		i get an ata2 error
2007-08-06T12:12:00.000Z	ryphix	hwilde	/bin/sh/:can't access tty job control turned off
2007-08-06T12:13:00.000Z	hwilde	ryphix	that is odd...
