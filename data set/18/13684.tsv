2005-11-26T09:18:00.000Z	Ron_o		Mplayer or Xine or Kaffeine.
2005-11-26T09:18:00.000Z	Ron_o		I get the same thing with VLC.
2005-11-26T09:20:00.000Z	Ron_o		ubuto, I tried w32 codecs and the only thing I got playing was MPG..
2005-11-26T09:20:00.000Z	Ron_o		I d/l any codec pacakage I could find on Synaptic in order to play WMV files.
2005-11-26T09:20:00.000Z	coz	Ron_o	whats the problem
2005-11-26T09:20:00.000Z	Ron_o		hehe.. :)
2005-11-26T09:20:00.000Z	Ron_o	coz	if I really knew I could solve it. :)
2005-11-26T09:21:00.000Z	Ron_o		oskdude, not only that but the only player I get working at all is Mplayer.
2005-11-26T09:21:00.000Z	Ron_o		kaffeine, Totem et al. doesn't recognize any of my codecs.
2005-11-26T09:21:00.000Z	coz		totem-xine is better if you have all the added libs etc
2005-11-26T09:21:00.000Z	coz	Ron_o	if it is totem-gstreamer it won't
2005-11-26T09:22:00.000Z	coz		you need totem-xine
2005-11-26T09:22:00.000Z	Ron_o		what I don't understand is why the others don't even recognize one of my codecs..
2005-11-26T09:22:00.000Z	coz		I have vlc, totem -xine I play all movies. avi etc
2005-11-26T09:22:00.000Z	coz		no problems
