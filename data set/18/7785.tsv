2007-11-17T00:59:00.000Z	rajman		hi i've checked all over the forum and google and i can't seem to resolve this problem. i had a microSD with an adaptor, and I switched off the physical lock on the adapter (there isnt one on the little microSD), and i even fiddled with /etc/fstab to mount it with rw option. but as soon as its inserted, its automounted ro, and if i try to mount it manually i get: block device /dev/mmcblk0p1 is write-protected, mounting read-only
