2008-04-11T13:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	you want "usermod -aG group username"
2008-04-11T13:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	but adduser user group is easier.
2008-04-11T13:49:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	1 user can done all thing is easier ^.^
2008-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	don't forget the -a
2008-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	and without the $s
2008-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	will mess home ?
2008-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	no, that won't.
2008-04-11T13:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	look, just use useradd
2008-04-11T13:53:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	 what is the differenece ?
2008-04-11T13:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	with usermod -G, you may inadvertently remove yourself from a group
2008-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	so the best way is add new user ?
2008-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	no
2008-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	"adduser user group" adds "user" to the group "group"
2008-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	so which is the best way ?
2008-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	that's what you want, isn't it?
2008-04-11T13:56:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	 yup
2008-04-11T13:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	CK_MY	usermod can do it too, but I prefer using adduser because you can't mess it up
2008-04-11T13:57:00.000Z	CK_MY	Chousuke	thanks
