2010-05-05T19:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	cool :-)
2010-05-05T19:36:00.000Z	valentin_	onetinsoldier	 ther are kernels listed from ubuntu 8... in menu list and your command only lists the newer ones
2010-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	valentin_	onetinsoldier	these newer ones i want to keep, but remove the old ones from the system
2010-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	you you have older kernels still installed, just change the 2.6.32 to 2.6.31 for example
2010-05-05T19:38:00.000Z	valentin_		ok onetinsoldier  and then pipe the list into aptitude remove ?
2010-05-05T19:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	roger... run the following command --> dpkg -l '*2.6.32*' | grep '^ii' && dpkg -l '*2.6.31*' | grep '^ii' && dpkg -l '*2.6.30*' | grep '^ii' ect, ect
2010-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	well, you'd need to make a little script i think to pipe into aptitude remove
2010-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	i have one i got from #debian years ago. want to see it?
2010-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	valentin_	onetinsoldier	of course :-)
2010-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	ok, hang on a minute
2010-05-05T19:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	dang, i'd have to figure out how to customize this script to do what you want. i might be to rusty to figure it out right now
2010-05-05T19:46:00.000Z	valentin_	onetinsoldier	dont bother. ill manage ;-) thanx anyway ;-)
2010-05-05T19:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	valentin_	ok, roger. good luck
