2006-03-05T13:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	I know what you mean, but don't know how to do it.  Maybe check with nautilus channels/mailing list?
2006-03-05T13:22:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	thanks
2006-03-16T12:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	sudo apt-get remove ...
2006-03-16T12:46:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	tritium thanks
2006-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	locate or find, depending what you're doing.
2006-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	i want to find a file with x in its filename
2006-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	All files with an x?  Can you narrow that down at all?
2006-03-17T06:53:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	"blah"
2006-03-17T06:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	Oh, got it.  'locate blah'.
2006-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	You can cut down the list too if necessary.  Say you know it's in your home directory somewhere, 'locate blah | grep /home/yourusername'.
2006-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	thanks
2006-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	what is grep?
2006-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	If you lose a file the same day you get it though, you'll have to run 'sudo updatedb' to tell locate it's there in the first place.
2006-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	Yeah, man it.  Basically searches and returns.
2006-03-17T06:55:00.000Z	mikebot	tonyyarusso	BlueEagle, okay, thanks a lot
2006-04-18T14:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mikebot	xfrisk, not sure how good it is.
