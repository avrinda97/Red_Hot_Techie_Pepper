2007-08-31T14:23:00.000Z	edulix		hi
2007-08-31T14:23:00.000Z	edulix		wouldn't it be a wonderful idea if for ubuntu+2 all IM clients installed and configured OTR (encrpytion plugin) by default?
2007-08-31T14:24:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	all IM clients?  no
2007-08-31T14:24:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	the ones which are supported
2007-08-31T14:24:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	I've tested pidgin and kopete, but mirandaim for example also supports it
2007-08-31T14:25:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	yeah, but I don't want a bunch of IM clients installed by default
2007-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	that's not what I say. I say that the ones installed ship otr activated by default
2007-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	yeah, I can see that
2007-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	for example: ubuntu ships with pidgin right? then, install pidgin-otr. at the moment I think it's not even in the reps
2007-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	no, it doesn't ship with pidgne
2007-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	and the same with kubuntu/kopete
2007-08-31T14:27:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	well, that's the old name of pidgin xd
2007-08-31T14:27:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	the version Ubuntu ships with is not the same as the released Pidgin 2.0
2007-08-31T14:29:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	uhm, I didn't notice that, maybe because I use more kopete hehe
2007-08-31T14:29:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	hehe, well, for the gaim/pidgin release it's like that
2007-08-31T14:30:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	anyway I think that ubuntu+2 could have security/privacy as the next big thing. easy firewall configuration, easy gpg emails, easy otr for IM, etc. wouldn't it be coo? ;)
2007-08-31T14:31:00.000Z	dweez	edulix	sort of
2007-08-31T14:32:00.000Z	edulix	dweez	and also something for cyphering volumes, like truecrypt (I've tested the forcefield gnome gui, and it still needs some work but it's good)
