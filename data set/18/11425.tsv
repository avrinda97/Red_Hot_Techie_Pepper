2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	Vlet		So when one installs google earth, it wants to create a folder ~/.google-earth/ but if I want to install it for all users, where should that folder go? /usr/local/bin /usr/bin ... ?
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	that's probably just user specific settings.  If you used the package at medibuntu, the program itself should be available to all users
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	ahh, no; I was just using google's installer, and no, it actually installs the binaries into ~/.google-earth/ .. use settings get stored in ~/.googleearth/
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	I'll try the package - nice to keep things kosher ;)
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	yeah, that's probably the easiest way
2007-08-30T08:21:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	yes, since the live cd has a blank pass; no, I don't know how offhand
2007-08-31T11:41:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	man gedit  suggests using --new-window
2007-08-31T11:41:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	Thanks :)
2007-10-25T18:50:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	what's the difference between invoke-rc.d and calling /etc/inti.d/gdm ?
2007-10-25T18:51:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	none in this case (that I know of)
2008-03-20T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	create it in /etc/skel/
2008-03-20T17:42:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	genii: thankya :)
2008-11-07T00:45:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	that's just the name of the architecture
2008-11-07T00:46:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	Gnea: oh well, ya learn something every day :) thanks
2008-11-07T00:47:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	Gnea: Do you know if there is a way to see a list of all packages installed along with their arch? I'm having trouble getting gd (php5-gd package) working, and I suspect it is because there is a 32 bit binary in the works somewhere
2009-03-07T01:39:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	use su
2009-03-07T01:39:00.000Z	jrib	Vlet	and /etc/rc.local
2009-03-07T01:39:00.000Z	Vlet	jrib	ahh yeah, thankya!
