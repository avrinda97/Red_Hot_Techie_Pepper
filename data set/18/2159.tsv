2010-08-04T02:26:00.000Z	urzik		hi
2010-08-04T02:26:00.000Z	urzik		can anyone tell me the default font setting in ubuntu?
2010-08-04T02:27:00.000Z	urzik		i'am not on it right now but i'd like to make fonts look like in ubuntu
2010-08-04T02:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding	urzik	look like them how?
2010-08-04T02:29:00.000Z	urzik	tensorpudding	could you please make 2 screens of the fonts tab in appearance preferences - fonts tab itself and of the details tab
2010-08-04T02:31:00.000Z	urzik	tensorpudding	like this - http://s54.radikal.ru/i146/1008/de/914b9ee29c84.png
2010-08-04T02:32:00.000Z	urzik	tensorpudding	i'd be really grateful to you for that
2010-08-04T02:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	urzik	you mean, you want to know the default hinting and smoothing settings for ubuntu?
2010-08-04T02:33:00.000Z	urzik	tensorpudding	right )
2010-08-04T02:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding		it depends on the machine
2010-08-04T02:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding		i don't think subpixel smoothing is used if it knows that you're on a CRT
2010-08-04T02:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding		If you have an LCD screen definitely use subpixel smoothing
2010-08-04T02:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding		really if you have a sane linux the defaults will be find
2010-08-04T02:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding		fine*
2010-08-04T02:37:00.000Z	urzik	tensorpudding	i'm on an lcd. not sure how sane opensuse is on this machinhe, but i never liked its the default setting. so i;d like to try to change them so that i could work calm )
2010-08-04T02:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	urzik	tune down the hinting
2010-08-04T02:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding		full hinting is too harsh
2010-08-04T02:41:00.000Z	urzik	tensorpudding	ok. going to install ubuntu on a virtual machine. thanks anyway. just hate the default settings i have right now
