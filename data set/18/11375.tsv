2006-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	Megaqwerty		Does anyone know how I can import all my mail and settings into evolution? (I'm using Thunderbird)
2006-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	 there is an import option in evolution,  under files
2006-11-02T07:58:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	Yes, but that won't work seeing as Thunderbird isn't an older version of Evolution
2006-11-02T07:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	 when I tried to import my old stuff,   evolution searched for info from several clients, including thunderbird
2006-11-02T08:00:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	Huh, it didn't find Thunderbird for me.
2006-11-02T08:03:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	nope. Can't figure it out.
2006-11-02T08:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	 try searching the ubuntu forum for an answer
2006-11-02T08:03:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	okay.
2006-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	lol
2007-05-26T08:48:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	noplease  I was just butting in, I have more then enough on my plate
2007-10-03T15:18:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	 do you have a specific issue ?
2007-10-03T15:19:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	no, I'm looking to buy a new laptop, and figured I'd make sure I could actually install Ubuntu on a Macbook if I chose to go that route.
2008-11-01T01:48:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	Right-Click on Applications and choose "Edit Menus"
2008-11-01T01:49:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	that only brings up the alacarte menu manager
2008-11-01T01:49:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	right, and from there you can edit the menu to your heart's content
2008-11-01T01:51:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	, I'm not talking about the menu , I'm talking about the wheelchair access icon in the notification area on the right side of the top panel,  it's for special access features . like magnifihying glass and such  , I uninstalled all I could think of but the icon still starts up and I can't figure out what application it is for
2008-11-01T01:52:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Pelo	ah, it might be "Visual Assistance" which you can disable in System>Preferences>Sessions
2008-11-01T01:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Megaqwerty	already done which is why I'm so puzzled
