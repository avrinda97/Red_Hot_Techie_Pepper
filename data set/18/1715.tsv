2010-12-19T13:28:00.000Z	Weazel		is there an 'easy' way to change file type icons ? (ex: change a folder icon inside a specific theme)
2010-12-19T13:29:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	right click the folder and go to properties.  you can click the icon in the window that pops up and change it from there
2010-12-19T13:30:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	 but it will only work for that specific Icon,  not for all folders or file types
2010-12-19T13:30:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	then gksudo nautilus /usr/share/icons/
2010-12-19T13:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	your most likely going to have to go to the humanity directory
2010-12-19T13:32:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	thanks, but thats exactly what i'm trying to avoid, changing each one manually
2010-12-19T13:33:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	sorry don't know what to tell you then
2010-12-19T13:33:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	that's how you do it
2010-12-19T13:34:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	i understand, but thats too complicated for  something that should be simple like how windows implemented it, but oh well, u win some....
2010-12-19T13:36:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	well windows might be the os for you...i don't mean that in a mean way either
2010-12-19T13:38:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	if i weigh Microsoft's evil/probs/bugs/impotantancy  vs the freedom of linux,  then i'll stick to manual... (just wanted to know if there is a gui like filetypes thingie thats all)
2010-12-19T13:39:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	if u would see how my desktop looks like right now, u'll know why i wanted somthing like that :D its so beautiful its killing any Mac or windows or whatnot
2010-12-19T13:39:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	i haven't seen a app for that.  I manually innertwine my icons themes together and that's how i do it
2010-12-19T13:40:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	take a screenshot and post it on www.imageshack.us
2010-12-19T13:52:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	sry totally missed ur request--- >  http://img17.imageshack.us/g/desktop1u.png/
2010-12-19T13:54:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Weazel	i gots to say i like the setup
2010-12-19T13:55:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	thanks :D, many things intertwined to create all of that, got a bit lazy with the icons, since i need to change the icons manually every single place from small to big ^_^ thats why i asked
2010-12-19T13:55:00.000Z	Weazel	Us3r_Unfriendly	oh well i guess its time to get back to work now
