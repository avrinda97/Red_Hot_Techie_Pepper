2007-02-21T17:04:00.000Z	WaZ		then installing kdm
2007-02-21T17:05:00.000Z	WaZ		why not have both angela?
2007-02-21T17:05:00.000Z	WaZ		you short on HD space?
2007-02-21T17:06:00.000Z	WaZ		you cant recompile the kernel with binary drivers anyways
2007-02-21T17:06:00.000Z	WaZ		to unload past drivers
2007-02-21T17:08:00.000Z	WaZ		lol
2007-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	WaZ		anyways, lets not argue here
2007-02-21T17:10:00.000Z	WaZ		anyways, babo, no need to recompile, lets keep it to this
2007-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	WaZ		yeah babo, i remember having to recompile to make binary drivers work, lets not fight over this
2007-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	WaZ		(but it was the open source part that had to be intergrated to the kernel)
2007-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	Ferret	WaZ	Yes, that's likely.
2007-02-21T17:30:00.000Z	Ferret	WaZ	Things like that tend to break when the main OS gets updated.  Also, if they're such useful things to have configured, surely the ordinary default ubuntu should be that way?  Then if there are common programs that shouldn't be put in base or desktop (beccause of bloat) there can just be a list of neat pcakages instead of a whole website of instructions ;)
2007-02-21T17:31:00.000Z	WaZ	Ferret	okay, ill stop installing easyubuntu when installing computers for friends then :D
2007-02-21T17:32:00.000Z	Ferret	WaZ	If it works, it probably saves time, but eh.  Wouldn't rely on it completely. ;p
2007-02-21T17:44:00.000Z	Ferret	WaZ	That's what I was going to say, and then I realised that in my client I can do things like that really easily. c.c
2007-02-21T17:44:00.000Z	WaZ	Ferret	you have an evil client :D
2007-02-21T17:45:00.000Z	Ferret	WaZ	Yeah, irssi. :(
2007-02-21T17:45:00.000Z	WaZ	Ferret	nxurses are so 1998!
