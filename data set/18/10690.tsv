2008-08-02T01:41:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	ath0 is the ap
2008-08-02T01:42:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	do you have an ap running?
2008-09-30T02:48:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab
2008-09-30T03:07:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	*automount*, not static mount
2008-09-30T03:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	Editing fstab is HOW you manage automounting.
2008-09-30T03:09:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	wrong, the mount points explicitely set of plugged-in media are stored somewhere else to...
2008-09-30T03:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	Yes, but if you add fstab entries, I do believe those take precedence.
2008-09-30T03:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	Besides, I interpret your question as having a flash drive plugged in all the time, and therefore allowing it to mount on boot, correct?
2008-09-30T03:12:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	but i don't want to fill up the systems fstab with user-specific devices....
2008-09-30T03:12:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	no, a usb drive
2008-09-30T03:13:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	yeah, they're equivalent terms.........I think there might be separate articles for what you want to do. Let's see here...
2008-09-30T03:15:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	the main issue is actually that i can't mount newly created partitions on a usb disk...
2008-09-30T03:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	So you want to autmount in what way?
2008-09-30T03:16:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	...the fat32 partition on it when it was fresh from the shop was no problem...
2008-09-30T03:17:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	...but then i've reformatted with ext3 and no user writable automounts any longer! :(
2008-09-30T03:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	deever	Well, I'm afraid I don't really understand what you're getting at, because every tutorial out there uses fstab for automounting. So I may not be of any further help.
2008-09-30T03:20:00.000Z	deever	bobertdos	np, thank you! :)
