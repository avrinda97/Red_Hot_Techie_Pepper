2009-09-14T02:13:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	what are the dependancies?
2009-09-14T02:13:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	been a while since I installed it.
2009-09-14T02:14:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	sudo apt-get -f
2009-09-14T02:17:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	try removing the repo, update, install vlc from repo and then add the repo and do a dist-upgrade?
2009-09-14T02:17:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	I had no trouble
2009-09-14T02:18:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	I just removed the old one, and added repo and installed new one.  still, it should get the deps regardless of where the main package is from

2009-09-14T02:25:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	looks like its still trying to use the ppa
2009-09-14T02:26:00.000Z	ruhaan	duffydack	anyway to fix it?
2009-09-14T02:26:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	remove it completely (autoremove --purge vlc) remove the ppa, apt-get update and install vlc again
2009-09-14T02:27:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	what version of ubuntu you using?
2009-09-14T02:28:00.000Z	ruhaan	duffydack	9.04
2009-09-14T02:28:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	any backports or anything enabled?
2009-09-14T02:29:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	well remove it completely, and do a find ~ -iname "*vlc*" and remove whatever is there for it.
2009-09-14T02:30:00.000Z	duffydack	ruhaan	then re-add the repo , update and install it.. I dont see what could stop it
2009-09-14T02:31:00.000Z	ruhaan	duffydack	weirdly i installed from synpatic and it worked thanks anyway :)
