2005-10-01T12:13:00.000Z	linner		I mean REALLY off
2005-10-01T12:15:00.000Z	AstralJava	linner	Are minutes also off, or just hours? Are you utilizing a dual boot machine, and if so, is the other OS a Windows?
2005-10-01T12:24:00.000Z	AstralJava	linner	What happens when you right-click on the clock and choose Adjust date & time ?

2005-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	AstralJava	linner	How about System - Administration - Time and date?
2005-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	linner	AstralJava	 click on the time and date and click "adjust time date", hear the sound and no window
