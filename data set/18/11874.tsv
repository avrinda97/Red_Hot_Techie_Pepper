2007-08-03T10:45:00.000Z	iratik		Is there any way to provide network authentication based on one machine's /etc/password & /etc/shadow file ?
2007-08-03T10:46:00.000Z	iratik		got a link?
2007-08-03T10:48:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	if your dealing with more than say 20 users, I'd highly recommend setting up ldap
2007-08-03T10:48:00.000Z	iratik	disasm	what are the disadvantages of NIS compared to OpenLDAP?
2007-08-03T10:50:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	ldap is much easier to work with. Because it directory based, there is a logical structure to it. nis basically uses a bunch of unix config files over a network. I find perl scripting is rather simple to do with ldap for setting up new users, autofs mounts, new computers, mail accounts, mail aliases, etc...
2007-08-03T10:51:00.000Z	iratik	disasm	is there a gui interface for managing an OpenLDAP server?
2007-08-03T10:51:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	yeah, gq for gnome, and some other one for kde
2007-08-03T10:52:00.000Z	iratik	disasm	any web-based admin system for openldap?
2007-08-03T10:52:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	I believe there is, we don't have one setup on the network here though
2007-08-03T10:52:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	check webmin
2007-08-03T10:53:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	i see ldaptor-webui and ldap-account-manager with a quick apt-cache search
2007-08-03T10:55:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	well, you can setup a samba server as a PDC that authenticates using pam to ldap (and I use kerberos here for password auth), I don't have any details, because I'm waiting on a budget to get approved to replace the window domain server with a linux server
2007-08-03T10:55:00.000Z	iratik	disasm	How did you convince that argument. .. i'm fighting the opposite argument
2007-08-03T10:55:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	we
2007-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	we're in the process of getting rid of our NIS server ;-) just can't get the stupid solaris 8 machines to play nice with ldap server, but dropping solaris support in next summer
2007-08-03T10:57:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	because I work in a small dept. where the department head listens to the sysadmin and my opinion
2007-08-03T11:11:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	where were we? had a faculty member come in asking about svn+ssh
2007-08-03T11:12:00.000Z	disasm	iratik	centrifuge?
