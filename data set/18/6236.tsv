2008-06-28T13:41:00.000Z	SliMM_		hello
2008-06-28T13:41:00.000Z	SliMM_		how can i find information about the hardware in my computer?
2008-06-28T13:41:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	SliMM_	dmidecode or lshw
2008-06-28T13:42:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	there was some application in gutsy, is it gone?
2008-06-28T13:42:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	SliMM_	yeah. It sucked anyway so it's one thing I'm not terribly bothered to see go
2008-06-28T13:43:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	i have some small driver problems also
2008-06-28T13:45:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	can I, at least, fully disable it?
2008-06-28T13:45:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	or make it work properly
2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	SliMM_	no idea, only wifi hardware I've really messed with under ubuntu has been desktop PCI stuff (so no switch)
2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	by switch i mean "button"
2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	thanks, i'll try the forums
2008-06-28T13:47:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	SliMM_	yeah, I'm familiar with them on laptops but I haven't really messed around too much with Ubuntu on lappies
2008-06-28T13:47:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	after i install hwinfo and check the details
2008-06-28T13:47:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	works great for me
2008-06-28T13:48:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	besides, it's unexpensive :P
2008-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	SliMM_	you probably want the amd64 ubuntu (yes, even if you have a Core 2)
2008-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	won't it work awful?
2008-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	SliMM_	LSD|Ninja	and I do have core 2 duo
