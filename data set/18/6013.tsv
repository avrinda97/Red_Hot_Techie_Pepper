2008-08-04T02:02:00.000Z	moDumass		comp seems good this mornign, and i am happy
2008-08-04T02:02:00.000Z	moDumass		any idea how to get a wacom tablet to act as more than a tracking pad?
2008-08-04T02:02:00.000Z	moDumass		touch pad
2008-08-04T02:02:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	moDumass	what do you mean? I've done several tablet configs
2008-08-04T02:03:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	I have a wacom Intuos3 and i cant get it to act as more than a touch pad, IE the pointer only moves if i drag the stylus
2008-08-04T02:03:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	moDumass	what feature are you wanting to use?
2008-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	Id like to use all the features, in Win it acted as a drawing tablet, IE the tablet recognised the pointers position when it was just above the tablet
2008-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	but in Ubuntu its as if i have to draw small lines to move the pointer
2008-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	moDumass	well there's a lot of features, most have to be configured in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-08-04T02:07:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	yeh ive had to reboot about 30 times trying to get my xorg.conf to work after initial install
2008-08-04T02:07:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	i have installed wacom tools
2008-08-04T02:07:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	moDumass	ubuntu actually has really good wacom support.. i've even been able to get rotation to work on a touchscreen and actually have the stylus oriented correctly
2008-08-04T02:07:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	and ive done prob 5 or 6 walkthroughs re setting it up
2008-08-04T02:08:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	oh, no doubt that there is a way, i just cant find it
2008-08-04T02:08:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	moDumass	ok well give me a feature you want. hold down = right click? double-tap=something? what do you want?
2008-08-04T02:10:00.000Z	moDumass	Eyes`Only	may i PM you?
2008-08-04T02:10:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	moDumass	sure
