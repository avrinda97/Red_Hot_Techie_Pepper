2009-12-05T20:07:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jrib	i wikipedia'ed the irc thing, i understand what it did now
2009-12-05T20:18:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	upgrade what to what?
2009-12-05T20:19:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	if 9.04 is working for you then you don't need to upgrade
2009-12-05T20:19:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jrib	im not upgrading until its fixed
2009-12-05T20:20:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	until what is fixed?  9.10 has been released.  That means it only gets security and "big bug" updates
2009-12-05T22:13:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	you should probably just ask your real question but it's ~/.mozilla/
2010-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	what are you trying to accomplish?
2010-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	erm, it's non-trivial if you haven't done it before.  Grab the source package, apply the patch (man patch), rebuild the package, install, maintain
2010-09-05T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	does it happen with a fresh new user?
2010-09-05T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	run it from a terminal
2010-09-05T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	I have to go.  You should run it from a terminal and pastebin output
2010-10-05T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	what's wrong with gnome calc?
2010-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	erm, it seems to work both ways here?
2010-10-05T07:42:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	or did you mean the opposite of what you said?  It only works one way actually (type numbers, then +/-)
2010-10-05T07:42:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jrib	what i have to do for math is '-12 / (-3)'
2010-10-05T07:43:00.000Z	jrib	CkhiKuzad	-12/-3  seems to work ok, press the minus sign
