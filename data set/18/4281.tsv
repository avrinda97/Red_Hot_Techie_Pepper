2009-05-05T10:52:00.000Z	aspidites		i wanted so much to like gentoo too.
2009-05-05T10:52:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	interesting. i'm using ubuntu and gentoo on two machines
2009-05-05T10:53:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	some people have better luck than others, i guess. also, it could be that when i tried gentoo the iwlwifi drivers weren't stable yet. try installing source-based packages without an internet connection (didn't have access to ethernet at the time)
2009-05-05T10:53:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	that, and the current nvidia drivers weren't working out for me
2009-05-05T11:01:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	ah. those might have been problems but i'm running it on a headless machine without sound, graphics, or wireless support :P
2009-05-05T11:01:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	and i use xmonad :D
2009-05-05T11:02:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	xmonad was sexy, but i just can't get a hang of haskell. the whole functional programming thing is far over my head. i'll stick to python/ruby/c++, thanks
2009-05-05T11:03:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	ah. but i have a friend who knows a bit and another who uses it, so we help each other with configs
2009-05-05T11:03:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	lucky
2009-05-05T11:21:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	emacs users commonly bind ctrl to capslock
2009-05-05T11:21:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	lol. i do that for vi/m too.
2009-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	to be fair, only recently though
2009-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	hrm? vim users more commonly bind esc to capslock
2009-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	nah, i use capslock + ] for my escape
2009-05-05T11:23:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	plus, ctrl is needed for buffer management and a lot of other ide functions i use
2009-05-05T11:26:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	yup. no documentation.
2009-05-05T11:27:00.000Z	raylu	aspidites	in development for 4 years, got it working, can't configure it because there's no damn documentation
2009-05-05T11:27:00.000Z	aspidites	raylu	gotta love open source projects huh?
