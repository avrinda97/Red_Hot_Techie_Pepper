2008-03-20T01:52:00.000Z	eighty		errr... i have apache2 installed... but i can't access my machine from another computer. what should i check?
2008-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	eighty		i also have ssh-server installed, and i can't access that either. :|
2008-03-20T01:54:00.000Z	eighty		in general, if you can't remotely access a machine (port 80, 22), what could be the problem?
2008-03-20T01:54:00.000Z	eighty		i'm stumped. :(
2008-03-20T01:55:00.000Z	Lamego	eighty	in general or the services are not running, or you are behind a router and need to configure port forwarding, or you dont have network connectivity between your client and server systems
2008-03-20T01:55:00.000Z	eighty	Lamego	network connectivity is confirmed. services are running. and there's no router.
2008-03-20T01:56:00.000Z	Lamego	eighty	can you ping the server ?
2008-03-20T01:56:00.000Z	eighty	Lamego	yep.
2008-03-20T01:56:00.000Z	eighty		well... i can't ping the server from another server, sorry
2008-03-20T01:56:00.000Z	Lamego	eighty	then you have a network config or connection problem
2008-03-20T01:57:00.000Z	eighty	Lamego	should i look in /etc/network/interfaces?
2008-03-20T01:57:00.000Z	Lamego	eighty	yes, make sure your interfaces are properly configured
2008-03-20T01:57:00.000Z	eighty		it must be a network config problem.
2008-03-20T01:59:00.000Z	eighty	Lamego	see any probs with this interface config? http://rafb.net/p/UYizcE94.html
2008-03-20T02:00:00.000Z	Lamego	eighty	I can't help you understanding your own networking config, it depends on your own network settings :(
2008-03-20T02:00:00.000Z	eighty	Lamego	my settings are static ip with netmask and gateway. no firewalls. no routers. are there other configs to check? :}
2008-03-20T02:01:00.000Z	eighty		sorry... i'm such a network wannbie.
2008-03-20T02:02:00.000Z	Lamego	eighty	you just need to make sure both servers have IPs from the same subnet, same netmask, same gateway
