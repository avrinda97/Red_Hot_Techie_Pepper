2009-08-31T08:04:00.000Z	miguelonnnn		please 1 question, why can't i remove a . or .. hardlink at a folder? I know i'm not supposed to, i know i shouldn't to, but hey, i'm logged as root, it's a simple hardlink as any other, why system won't let me remove it?
2009-08-31T08:04:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	?
2009-08-31T08:04:00.000Z	miguelonnnn		hi xmnt
2009-08-31T08:04:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	hey
2009-08-31T08:05:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	you can't remove the . and .. those are references to the parent folder and the folder you're currently in
2009-08-31T08:06:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	i think thats what you're talking about
2009-08-31T08:07:00.000Z	miguelonnnn		yeah i'm talking about that. I tried too with rm -f as somebody said but won't let me "." and ".." may not be removed
2009-08-31T08:07:00.000Z	miguelonnnn	xmnt	, what do you mean by references? aren't them just hardlinks? files with the same inode as the actual /users/home/thefolder ?
2009-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about but if you mean the '. and ..' that appear when you ls -la from a directory then really no, they are not hardlinks
2009-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	miguelonnnn	xmnt	sry
2009-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	miguelonnnn		i was searching on the web xmnt  i didnt read
2009-08-31T08:13:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	n/p
2009-08-31T08:13:00.000Z	miguelonnnn	xmnt	 you say they aren't hardlinks? i read that long ago. I read that . and .. are hardlinks, so copying . is the same as copying /users/home/folder
2009-08-31T08:13:00.000Z	miguelonnnn		then what they are? references? what are references? xmnt
2009-08-31T08:14:00.000Z	xmnt	miguelonnnn	a hardlink is the physical location of a file or dir ... so /home/user/folder   is a hardlink ... if your in the folder dir then . is a reference to the /home/user/folder (btw I'm not sure if reference is the correct term)
2009-08-31T08:16:00.000Z	miguelonnnn	xmnt	look i read some weeks ago
2009-08-31T08:19:00.000Z	miguelonnnn	xmnt	 that there are softlinks (ln -s) and hardlinks (ln). Hardlinks are files which point to the inode of the referencing file, so editing them will edit the file. They are like synchronised copies of the same file. While softlinks are what we see in windows, direct access icons pointing to a file.
