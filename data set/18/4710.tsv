2009-12-01T15:33:00.000Z	jozefk		what is the way for starting daemons automatically in Ubuntu?
2009-12-01T15:33:00.000Z	jozefk		where are the sshd, httpd and other stuff lokated in ubuntu?
2009-12-01T15:34:00.000Z	jozefk		located* :)
2009-12-01T15:34:00.000Z	q0_0p	jozefk	i dont remember maybe /etc ? config files?
2009-12-01T15:35:00.000Z	jozefk		maybe etc? then how to start them automatically?
2009-12-01T15:36:00.000Z	jozefk		in some other distros they are inside /etc/rc.d/
2009-12-01T15:36:00.000Z	jozefk		and there is /etc/rc.di can't do it manually with vim?
2009-12-01T15:37:00.000Z	jozefk		init.d ok thanks. that's what I needed. what is the config file for init.d?
2009-12-01T15:38:00.000Z	jozefk		upstart system v inittab .. don't know any of that. i just want to start sshd and httpd and cron daemons during boot of system
2009-12-01T15:39:00.000Z	jozefk		that's all and so simple
2009-12-01T15:39:00.000Z	jozefk		but with ubuntu it's not simple
2009-12-01T15:39:00.000Z	jozefk		i see.
2009-12-01T15:40:00.000Z	jozefk		i was hopping maybe they will start by themselves after installation :) but not sure if that was the case
2009-12-01T15:40:00.000Z	jozefk		all of them? cron, sshd, httpd?
2009-12-01T15:41:00.000Z	jozefk		and they start after each reboot right?
2009-12-01T15:41:00.000Z	jozefk		update-rc.d is it a file? can i edit that in vim?
2009-12-01T15:43:00.000Z	jozefk	erUSUL	then I can do #sudo update-rc.d httpd defaults as well right?
2009-12-01T15:43:00.000Z	q0_0p	jozefk	chkconfig --list
