2009-11-04T06:06:00.000Z	gregd		hello, I am working on setting up the firefly media server (mt-daapd) to broadcast music off of my external hard drive.  I read something, and being a complete newbie to ubuntu have no idea what it means: Note that because the files are stored in the database by inode, these must be in the same physical filesystem.  Does anyone know what this means?
2009-11-04T06:08:00.000Z	usser	gregd	filesystems in linux has whats known as superblock that contains links to data files each link is unique within filesystems, but links are not unique on different filesystems/partitions. ie /dev/sda1 may have links named '1' '2' '3', they are unique but at the same time /dev/sda2 may also have a link named '1'
2009-11-04T06:09:00.000Z	usser	gregd	what they are saying is "we made a really bad design decision and picked inode which is non-unique as the key field"
2009-11-04T06:10:00.000Z	usser	gregd	in short all the files that you plan on putting in the database must be on the same partition
2009-11-04T06:10:00.000Z	gregd	usser	does that mean all the files have to be on the same partition as the ubuntu install?
2009-11-04T06:11:00.000Z	usser	gregd	no, but they must be all on one partition, ie you cant have 1 file on /dev/sda1 and another on /dev/sda2
2009-11-04T06:15:00.000Z	gregd	usser	oh ok.  So, here's what I am having trouble with then.  I can get the field to work when I point it to my desktop.  But, I put in this to get my music:  /media/MYDOCS/music/   (MYDOCS being the name of the external hard drive), and it is not finding it.  Is there something I'm doing wrong?
2009-11-04T06:16:00.000Z	usser	gregd	clean the database before you go with /media/mydocs, it probably has records from your ~/Desktop still which clash.
2009-11-04T06:17:00.000Z	gregd	usser	I'm sorry I don't think I understand
2009-11-04T06:17:00.000Z	usser	gregd	how did you setup database?
2009-11-04T06:18:00.000Z	usser	gregd	are you using mysql?
2009-11-04T06:18:00.000Z	gregd	usser	I am going through the .conf file pointing it to the place where my music is and the program is compiling the database from the directory
2009-11-04T06:19:00.000Z	usser	gregd	try recreating the database like from scratch if it allows it
2009-11-04T06:19:00.000Z	gregd	usser	so I put music on my desktop and on the reboot it worked just fine, but it is not finding the external hard drive for some reason.
2009-11-04T06:21:00.000Z	gregd	usser	so there isn't anything that you can see that is wrong with a directory like /media/MYDOCS/music/?  that should work just fine?
2009-11-04T06:21:00.000Z	usser	gregd	i dont know, as i said it'd try dropping the database that it uses, failing that, just put it on / partition
2009-11-04T06:22:00.000Z	usser	gregd	no it seems fine,
2009-11-04T06:22:00.000Z	gregd	usser	thank you for your help, I appreciate it.  Have a good day.
