2007-07-28T08:46:00.000Z	HelpMe		Dofus_v1_19_0.zip is what the thing is called thats on my desktop now
2007-07-28T08:47:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	you should understand, ubuntu is not windows, you cannot directly use windows applications, or windows games on it... wine MIGHT be able to run those for you tho
2007-07-28T08:47:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	if it's a .exe file, it's NOT for linux
2007-07-28T08:49:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	and what files did you get OUT of it?
2007-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	dofus homepage says you extract it to any folder, and then you should have some executable file in there
2007-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	open the folder you extracted to with the file browser/whatever, and try locating it
2007-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	HelpMe	lietu	 ok
2007-07-28T10:00:00.000Z	HelpMe	lietu	 i'm just new to this stuff
2007-07-28T10:00:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	what part of the detailed instructions escapes you?
2007-07-28T10:02:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	the instructions say: extract the .zip, open up a terminal, type cd directory-you-extracted-to, type chmod 755 el.x86.linux.bin, type ./el.x86.linux.bin, open el.ini in your favorite text editor and change "datadir" to the directory you extracted to
2007-07-28T10:03:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	then you aren't doing what I said
2007-07-28T10:04:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	you also aren't telling me when you got that error
2007-07-28T10:06:00.000Z	HelpMe	lietu	  when i put the first thing in the termanal
2007-07-28T10:07:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	I assumed you blindly typed in "cd directory-you-extracted-to" instead of actually READING what I typed and realizing that I meant you type in the folder name you extracted to, instead of "directory-you-extracted-to"
2007-07-28T10:08:00.000Z	HelpMe	lietu	  right, ok, I extracted it into Luke. so what do i put?
2007-07-28T10:09:00.000Z	HelpMe	lietu	 wait, no, desktop
2007-07-28T10:09:00.000Z	lietu	HelpMe	I've got other things to do right now, either try and figure it out by yourself, it really shouldn't require too much brainpower to figure out what the Desktop/foldername is supposed to be, especially as you should see the name on the desktop.. if you can't manage that, ask someone else, I'm off
