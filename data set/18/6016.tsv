2009-05-30T12:06:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	  this is strange...for some reason the system is dropping the driver for the dvd  or its being stopped by something  at least it sounds that way/// you could check in some of the logs to see what is going on but I am not real good at problem solving dvd players
2009-05-30T12:08:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	which log to look at though? im not good with sifting thru logs.. what titles should I look thru?
2009-05-30T12:08:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	 good question I am searching now but which specific model of laptop is this?
2009-05-30T12:08:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	ASUS, with an LG drive if that helps
2009-05-30T12:09:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	  I will try to search this   no guarantees  :)  hold on
2009-05-30T12:10:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	np mate, I appreciate the help.. although my contacts are drying up something fierce
2009-05-30T12:12:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	  does this only happen when trying to burn with brasero?
2009-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	no, it happens when Im ripping a CD or DVD to an ISO with Brasero or any other application, not usually when burning
2009-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	  ok but you have tried other applications for this as well?
2009-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	yes
2009-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	 ok hold on
2009-05-30T12:16:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	its unusable right now.. if you have some command to run to try and reuse it or some other test lol, I can troubleshoot it now.. When I restart it works again
2009-05-30T12:17:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	  out of curiosity the dvds you are trying to rip when this happens i asume the region code is  for your region??  just a  thought
2009-05-30T12:18:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	yes, they are.. Some are personal DVD backups of just personal data and not encrypted or copyrighted
2009-05-30T12:19:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	ok it was just a though thinking the dvd player itself may be set to a different region code
2009-05-30T12:19:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	 I am coming up with nothing guy  sorry  I am going to suggest  #linux  also  if you havent tried there
2009-05-30T12:20:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	coz_	thanks for trying
2009-05-30T12:20:00.000Z	coz_	WIGGMPk	 no problem just give #linux channel a shot  a couple times  in case  someone is not there right now
