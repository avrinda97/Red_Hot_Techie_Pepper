2007-02-20T11:24:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	yes i am
2007-02-20T11:25:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	not using wine et al... but other wine apps do flicker as well or it is just IE?
2007-02-20T11:26:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	uTorrent flickers a lil..but not as much as IE does
2007-02-20T11:26:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	but IE uses a big window and I guess uTorrent does not....
2007-02-20T11:27:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	yes youre right, i thought there might be a way to fix the flicker though
2007-02-20T11:27:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	you are using beryl?
2007-02-20T11:27:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	no im not
2007-02-20T11:28:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	ok, there is a wine related option at beryl. I cannot help you... sorry
2007-02-20T11:28:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	thanks its alright, i guess ill have to deal with it
2007-02-20T11:29:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	perhaps it would be a good idea to go to wine channel and ask if wine requires some X11 setup to avoid flicker
2007-02-20T11:29:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	thats a good idea, thanks
2007-02-20T11:30:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	as user of xmgr, I require  Option "BackingStore" "true" under "Device" at xorg.conf
2007-02-20T11:30:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	it flickers otherwise since it relies the Xserver can back-store
2007-02-20T11:31:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	such option is not fully supported at xorg, but I have not experience any trouble
2007-02-20T11:32:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	thanks for the input dude, ill check some of those things out..see what i can come up with
2007-02-20T11:32:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	np
2007-02-20T11:32:00.000Z	guillem101	mindstate	I hate flickering!!!!!!
2007-02-20T11:32:00.000Z	mindstate	guillem101	as do i :p
