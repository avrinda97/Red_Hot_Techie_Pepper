2006-05-28T10:10:00.000Z	swim		SOS anyone please?
2006-05-28T10:11:00.000Z	StucKman	swim	what filesystem does that partition have?
2006-05-28T10:12:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	fat32 (vfat in ftsab)
2006-05-28T10:12:00.000Z	StucKman	swim	and I assume you have permissions in that party to create dirs...
2006-05-28T10:12:00.000Z	StucKman	swim	I /think/ it's the colon
2006-05-28T10:12:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	indeed I do, as I said, I have no problems with mkdir in that partition, but I cannot mv or cp into it
2006-05-28T10:13:00.000Z	StucKman	swim	tri touching a file called `: in that partition
2006-05-28T10:14:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	Im not sure how you mean, could you give me an example please?
2006-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	>
2006-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	swim		?
2006-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	StucKman	swim	touch Windows/music/:
2006-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	swim		ok thanks
2006-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	StucKman	swim	I think the colon is the problem
2006-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	touch: cannot touch `Windows/music/:': No such file or directory
2006-05-28T10:19:00.000Z	swim		oh sorry
2006-05-28T10:19:00.000Z	swim		wait
2006-05-28T10:19:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	yah it says no such file or directory
2006-05-28T10:26:00.000Z	swim	StucKman	something else odd... I can move files into the partiton, just not an entire directory
