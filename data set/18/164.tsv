2012-08-28T18:12:00.000Z	ganster		dreamweaver for ubuntu
2012-08-28T18:12:00.000Z	ganster		anyone who knows dreamweaver for ubuntu
2012-08-28T18:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	you don't get dreamweaver for linux
2012-08-28T18:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	it might work in wine
2012-08-28T18:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	tbh dreamweaver is a nuisance anyway
2012-08-28T18:13:00.000Z	ganster	gordonjcp	i don like  wine isn't  working fine with ubuntu
2012-08-28T18:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	having done quite a bit of backend work on websites, I find the best way to deal with dreamweaver sites is to delete them completely and start from scratch ;-)
2012-08-28T18:15:00.000Z	ganster	gordonjcp	 why from the scratch is more preferable than dreamweaver
2012-08-28T18:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	because dreamweaver produces horrible unusable code
2012-08-28T18:17:00.000Z	ganster	gordonjcp	but dreamweaver comes from the scratch
2012-08-28T18:18:00.000Z	ganster	gordonjcp	all i know dreamweaver its just   simplifies the work
2012-08-28T18:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	not really
2012-08-28T18:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	it gives you really horrible HTML code that doesn't render properly and cannot be maintained
2012-08-28T18:20:00.000Z	ganster	gordonjcp	if  i make the  with dreamweaver then after i make throughly  looking at the code  for the site  i made the will it also be horrible
2012-08-28T20:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	if you have a machine you can't boot install media on, take its drive out, put the drive into a machine you *can* boot install media on, install there, then swap it back
2012-08-28T20:25:00.000Z	ganster	gordonjcp	LiDaR u mean that if one drive havent OS and the other one have how can u shift the files on other works fine
2012-08-28T20:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ganster	I don't understand that
