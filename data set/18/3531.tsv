2009-09-19T12:35:00.000Z	StapleAttack	Jeruvy	at this point i have a logitech cam that ubuntu seems to know is there, as one of the volume control options is "cam" but none of the programs i use, like that recording program has cam available as a recording option
2009-09-19T12:41:00.000Z	Jeruvy	StapleAttack	usually it's 'unmuting' that solves it too :)
