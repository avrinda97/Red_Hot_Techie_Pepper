2009-04-23T09:06:00.000Z	bwm		am I in the right channel for wifi help?
2009-04-23T09:07:00.000Z	bwm		hmmm.... I'm thinking it is
2009-04-23T09:07:00.000Z	bwm		it worked before in 7.X
2009-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	Your paste doesn't give any information about  your wifi hardware or installed kernel modules. Do 'lspci -vvnn'
2009-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	bwm	AK_Dave	see http://pastebin.com/m54e7dbec
2009-04-23T09:11:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	You have an Intel 3945ABG. It has good linux support. It should have loaded automatically.
2009-04-23T09:12:00.000Z	bwm	AK_Dave	- I went to the Dell support website - they mentioned that the wifi LED needed to be patched - I did that
2009-04-23T09:13:00.000Z	bwm	AK_Dave	but the LED light still does not come on
2009-04-23T09:14:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	Your paste didn't include what modules you're using. lspci -vvnn should be more verbose than that.
2009-04-23T09:15:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	I think your kernel module is 'iwlwifi' and should be listed in lsmod
2009-04-23T09:17:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	Oh, wait. You have the ethernet cable plugged in, right?
2009-04-23T09:17:00.000Z	bwm	AK_Dave	yep, otherwise I would not be IRC
2009-04-23T09:18:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	And thats why your wireless isn't connecting to your router.
2009-04-23T09:18:00.000Z	bwm	AK_Dave	ts from the machine, maybe should have mentioned that
2009-04-23T09:25:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	But iwlwifi should have been loaded and enabled from the start. Should have been you just L-click the nm-applet icon, click your network name, and connect.
2009-04-23T09:35:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	They are planned.
2009-04-23T09:36:00.000Z	bwm	AK_Dave	cool!
2009-04-23T09:37:00.000Z	AK_Dave	bwm	9.10 is planned for Oct of this year. Karmic Koala ??
