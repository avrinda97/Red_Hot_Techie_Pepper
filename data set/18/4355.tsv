2009-08-26T14:52:00.000Z	hawodi		hello all. Something weird is happening to my ubuntu installation. After rebooting, my system no longer displays the GDM login screen. It just shows a brown screen with the mouse pointer just displaying. After about 30-40 seconds interval, it will try to refresh the screen. Right now, am using a live cd to browse.
