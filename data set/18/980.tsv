2011-08-22T03:09:00.000Z	Aple		Hey guys, I'm trying to call an application via terminal (Sublime Text to be exact). What would be the best way to do that? Sublime Text is in /opt/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe
2011-08-22T03:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	.exe - are you calling this with wine?
2011-08-22T03:11:00.000Z	Aple	zykotick9	No, I was just trying to add it to terminal.
2011-08-22T03:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	but .exe is a windows program
2011-08-22T03:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	mono then?
2011-08-22T03:12:00.000Z	Aple	zykotick9	I'm not sure what mono is, but I can double click it and it will launch Sublime.
2011-08-22T03:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	"file /opt/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe"
2011-08-22T03:14:00.000Z	Aple	zykotick9	I'll have to type that in every time I want to launch sublime from the command line?
2011-08-22T03:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	no, that will tell you/me what that file is
2011-08-22T03:15:00.000Z	Aple	zykotick9	It said no such file or dir
2011-08-22T03:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	ok change to the directory then "cd /opt/Sublime\ Text" then "file sublime_text.exe" or did you just make that path up?
2011-08-22T03:17:00.000Z	Aple	zykotick9	I ran it w/o the .exe and it returned: /opt/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped
2011-08-22T03:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	so it's NOT an .exe - that makes more sense
2011-08-22T03:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	so what do you want to do with it?  man a menu entry?
2011-08-22T03:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	not exactly - the problem is you'd have to be in the same directory as index.html - just add the /opt/Sublime\ Text\ 2 to your PATH - .bashrc can be used for this.
2011-08-22T03:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	you won't need the \ when you add it to your PATH (i don't think)
2011-08-22T03:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	you edit the .bashrc, it's not a command
2011-08-22T03:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	Aple	looks like Dr_Willis found that in .profile not .bashrc
