2009-09-15T13:12:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	i mean physical disks, not network shares
2009-09-15T13:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	i found that via websearching, let me have another go
2009-09-15T13:13:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	i googled 15 hours yesterday :( i need someone who just had that experience
2009-09-15T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	could try a different search engine
2009-09-15T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	^
2009-09-15T13:15:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	yes, but it is for network mounting, no?
2009-09-15T13:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1354   I wouldnt know, readthe guide. It may clarify
2009-09-15T13:16:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	yeah, its over network
2009-09-15T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	oh so you mean the local disks in a system?
2009-09-15T13:17:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	yees :)
2009-09-15T13:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	what file system does it use?
2009-09-15T13:18:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	keyword: NSS, Netware 386
2009-09-15T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	i think if you install the network servers but target local disks it may just be silly enough to work
2009-09-15T13:19:00.000Z	AlHafoudh	ActionParsnip1	how do you mean
2009-09-15T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	AlHafoudh	well the guide is talking about network shares over a network. rather than target remote shares, point the mount commands (or fstab) to the local partitions. It may just work
