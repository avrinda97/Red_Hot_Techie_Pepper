2006-05-30T11:10:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	not really dude
2006-05-30T11:10:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	just feel in the assisty type mood atm, that's all :)
2006-05-30T11:11:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	you can make your PC run very slow by firing up a 4 VM's... That'll give you something to work on.  :)
2006-05-30T11:11:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	shouldn't be a problem on a Dual Core Opteron :)
2006-05-30T11:11:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	hell yeah buddy...  :)
2006-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	I'll be joining you in a few days with one of the new AM2's
2006-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	I have a Dual Core 165 Opty ;)
2006-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	nice...  I'll be firing up a X2 4000+ come Thursday.
2006-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	you should fire up some VM's :)
2006-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	or games, that'd do the job :P
2006-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	you could run Windows in its proper place: as a child to Linux...
2006-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	there's a reason I came to Ubuntu, to get away from windows ;)
2006-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	I wish...  I gotta support it..
2006-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	nutterpc	drumline_	so do I, so I feel your pain dude
2006-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	drumline_	nutterpc	however, with the newer processor, I'll be able to make Linux the base...   which is cool.
