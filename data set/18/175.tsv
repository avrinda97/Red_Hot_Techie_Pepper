2012-07-05T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	that info was for other things though. the answer to what you asked is, you CANNOT install two things at the same time.
2012-07-05T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	obviously some people ask. why don't you ask a specific question?
2012-07-05T19:26:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	i've no idea what you mean by "train"
2012-07-05T19:29:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	there is also a fine channel #supybot
2012-07-05T19:35:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	it will install SQLite. you can find that out by doing "apt-cache show supybot", you will see that in the "Depends:" line there is python-sqlite
2012-07-05T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	uh... in what documentation? i've created some bots, like the FloodBots here
2012-07-05T19:38:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	ah yes, but that is hardly "creating bots". you can submit new factoids too, but let's take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
2012-07-05T23:06:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	it's certainly possible, but it's well beyond the scope of #ubuntu
2012-07-05T23:07:00.000Z	gogli	LjL	: can i make my bot ?
2012-07-06T14:37:00.000Z	gogli	LjL	 : i want to start a application or script after 15 minuter from startup .How can i do this
2012-07-06T14:46:00.000Z	LjL	gogli	cron can run stuff at reboot. but i don't think it can run it n minutes *after* reboot. so you would need to combine cron with a timer script.
