2010-08-07T19:45:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	lol... info like _what_ card would be useful
2010-08-07T19:45:00.000Z	Notepad	neurochrome	the realteck dont work either :/
2010-08-07T19:46:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	you really want to provide people with the outputs of the following commands :  sudo lshw && lspci -vv && lsmod && lsusb
2010-08-07T19:49:00.000Z	Notepad	neurochrome	its to long not all the info fits in the terminal but here it is http://pastebin.com/zqmibkm0
2010-08-07T19:49:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	do the entire command but add > ~/Desktop/output.txt to the end
2010-08-07T19:50:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	then open the file on the desktop and paste the contents
2010-08-07T19:53:00.000Z	Notepad	neurochrome	i dotn get a output.txt on the Desktop and I do sudo lshw && lspci -vv && lsmod && lsusb ~/Desktop/output.txt
2010-08-07T19:54:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	you missed the  > it should be sudo lshw && lspci -vv && lsmod && lsusb > ~/Desktop/output.txt
2010-08-07T19:55:00.000Z	Notepad	neurochrome	this was all i got http://pastebin.com/Lx5C7P99
2010-08-07T19:57:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	doh! sudo lshw > ~/Desktop/output.txt && lspci -vv >> ~/Desktop/output.txt  && lsmod >> ~/Desktop/output.txt  && lsusb >> ~/Desktop/output.txt
2010-08-07T19:59:00.000Z	Notepad	neurochrome	here you go and sorry that im so much trouble, I realy appriciate the help http://pastebin.com/P51srASF
2010-08-07T20:03:00.000Z	neurochrome	Notepad	I have to go, but my first advice would be to turn off the onboard soundcard in the bios and try again, also post on ubuntuforums the problem and also the same content as you just pastbined
