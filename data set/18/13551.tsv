2005-11-06T07:11:00.000Z	crafteh		is there a way to have my num lock activated whenever I log into X?
2005-11-06T07:12:00.000Z	bolrod	crafteh	yes
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	crafteh	bolrod	apt-get install numlockx ?
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	crafteh	bolrod	just found that
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bolrod		erh
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bolrod		I cant remember
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	crafteh		It looks like it should
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bolrod		somewhere .. hidden in a config file
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bolrod		you can set it to activate numlock on boot
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bolrod		it could be grub
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bolrod		not sure
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	crafteh	bolrod	I'm going to logoff/logon and see if this worked... I'll let you know
2005-11-06T07:14:00.000Z	crafteh	bolrod	this seemed to work ... numlockx package for future reference :)
2005-11-06T07:14:00.000Z	bolrod		hmm
2005-11-06T07:14:00.000Z	bolrod		not really
2005-11-06T07:14:00.000Z	bolrod		because you can put it in some config file
2005-11-06T07:15:00.000Z	bolrod		why install a package for it
2005-11-06T07:15:00.000Z	crafteh	bolrod	me? ... cause I don't know what config to change :D
