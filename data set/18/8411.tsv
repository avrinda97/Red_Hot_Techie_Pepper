2007-08-23T07:38:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		good morning everyone
2007-08-23T07:39:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		I am at school and all i have to say is ssh and irssi is a wonderfull thing
2007-08-23T07:40:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		and i also have on server running 22 and another on port 115
2007-08-23T07:40:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		just for backup
2007-08-23T07:42:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		does anyone have good tips on getting a static ip from comcast?
2007-08-23T07:42:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		or getting a reverse dns
2007-08-23T07:42:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		that would be nice too
2007-08-23T07:43:00.000Z	ostannard	Mclovin_School	dyndns.com will give you a domain name that is automatically updated to your IP address by software
2007-08-23T07:44:00.000Z	Mclovin_School	ostannard	i know lol but i want a reverse dns
2007-08-23T07:45:00.000Z	ostannard	Mclovin_School	what do you need rdns for?
2007-08-23T07:46:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		mainly so that i can be mclovin@roflsox.net
2007-08-23T07:47:00.000Z	ostannard	Mclovin_School	you need normal dns for that, and dynamic dns if the IP of your server will change
2007-08-23T07:48:00.000Z	Mclovin_School	ostannard	no, i need a reverse dns set up on my isp side in order to make my ip provided by my isp to also point to roflsox.net
2007-08-23T07:49:00.000Z	ostannard		dns turns roflsox.net into the IP address of your server so that an email can be sent
2007-08-23T07:49:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		!google shoutcast linux
2007-08-23T07:49:00.000Z	Mclovin_School		right but for ident it reaches for ip not roflsox
2007-08-23T07:50:00.000Z	ostannard		rdns turns an ip address into a domain name, computers can only contact each other with ip addresses
2007-08-23T07:51:00.000Z	ostannard	Mclovin_School	you need to buy the domain roflsox.com and set it to point to your IP address
