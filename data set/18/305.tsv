2012-09-17T03:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	i agree with Dr_willis's statment.  using the nvidia.com drive on ubuntu, is a poor choice.  (could, but probably isn't, required though).
2012-10-05T03:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	yup, that sounds like my suggestion.
2012-10-05T03:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	did you leave the session open?  you need too, inorder to add "more" to a cd.
2012-10-05T03:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	there is another option, making a cdrw more like a floppy disk, but i don't know ANYTHING about that!  i know it involves "formatting" the cdrw...
2012-10-05T03:49:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	I didn't see any option to leave the session open.
2012-10-05T03:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	it's no a typical option!  it mean most players can't use the cd until it's closed.
2012-10-05T03:50:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	er what?
2012-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	if you closed the session the sao/dap isn't gonna help... just sayin'
2012-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	ok
2012-10-05T03:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	sessionatonce/diskatonce - i'm familiar with tac (trackatonce) and dao (diskatonce).
2012-10-05T03:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	you could copy the cdrw contents to your HD, add the files you want.  clear the cdrw and copy it back, with an open session, if you want to add more files.
2012-10-05T03:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	fyi, you still can't update files, only add new.
2012-10-05T03:55:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	er copy the files from the disc to the hard drive add the additional files and then blank and burn them all on to the disc again-is that what you said?
2012-10-05T03:56:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	ha ha ha I wouldn't sell many cd burning programs if that's all they could do! ha ha ha
2012-10-05T03:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	sell free software or propritary software?
2012-10-05T03:57:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	I want to be able to add and remove files from my burned cd or dvd as is possible with say Nero.
2012-10-05T03:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightsparks	best of luck.  i won't see your posts further.  enjoy ubuntu.
2012-10-05T03:58:00.000Z	brightsparks	zykotick9	thank you
