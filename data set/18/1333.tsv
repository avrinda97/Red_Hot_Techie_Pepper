2011-05-02T22:48:00.000Z	jwmto		I'm having sound problems on an IMAC running natty.  Can anyone help or direct me to a better room to seek help?
2011-05-02T22:49:00.000Z	jwmto		yes: the headphone jack doesnt seem to be recognized
2011-05-02T22:49:00.000Z	jwmto		the other dimension of the problem is that in trying to fix it last month I changed the naming of the computer in I don't know what file
2011-05-02T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwmto	in BOTH /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname
2011-05-02T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwmto	open both for editing using sudo and then change both files,
2011-05-02T22:51:00.000Z	jwmto	ActionParsnip	 thanks.  gimme a second
2011-05-02T22:53:00.000Z	jwmto	ActionParsnip	which two files  in BOTH /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname ?
2011-05-02T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwmto	yes, change both if you want to change hostname of a system. If you change one then try to run sudo, it will fail and you will need to drop to root recovery mode to edit the other
2011-05-02T22:55:00.000Z	jwmto	ActionParsnip	it's not the hostname that is the problem
2011-05-02T22:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwmto	whats the issue?
