2012-06-09T01:12:00.000Z	damms005		Pls how can I know the exact block that represent a byte or kb for the -size in 'find' command
2012-06-09T01:14:00.000Z	damms005		Pls how can I know the exact block to represent 10kb for the -size in 'find' command
2012-06-09T01:16:00.000Z	damms005		I guess noone's got a clue about my quest
2012-06-09T01:17:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	you could also try in ##linux
2012-06-09T16:32:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	why so many?
2012-06-09T16:33:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	what is your end goal?
2012-06-09T16:35:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	you can only have 4 primary partitions, if you have windows then you only need the one ntfs for windows, the rest could be logical partitions
2012-06-09T16:36:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	wubi is awful, it isn't meant to be used as a long term solution, it is more of a try before you dive in deal
2012-06-09T16:36:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	even then a vm would be better than wubi
2012-06-09T16:37:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	better to start over fresh
2012-06-09T16:38:00.000Z	damms005	auronandace	what of my installed apps? I have so much pimped my present ubuntu
2012-06-09T16:38:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	i can't help you migrate
2012-06-09T16:39:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	that is highly inadvisable
2012-06-09T16:40:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	what unknown partitions, they are all ntfs
2012-06-09T16:43:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	you'd need to delete the partitions you don't need/want
2012-06-09T16:43:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	seriously, back up what you need first
2012-06-09T16:44:00.000Z	damms005	auronandace	like deleting sda2 and sda4?
2012-06-09T16:48:00.000Z	auronandace	damms005	you need to figure out what partition has what on it and back up what you need
