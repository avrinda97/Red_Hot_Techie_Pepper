2007-09-04T11:16:00.000Z	zodium		sure, it's a porno i got from my buddy xD
2007-09-04T11:17:00.000Z	zodium		it's a wmw actually so that might be true
2007-09-04T11:17:00.000Z	zodium		let's see if i can run an xvid
2007-09-04T11:17:00.000Z	RoboticTao	zodium	Do you have win32codecs installed?
2007-09-04T11:17:00.000Z	zodium		robotictao: yeah i do
2007-09-04T11:17:00.000Z	zodium		robotictao: previously the videos ran, but very laggily or with a lot of artifacts or both
2007-09-04T11:18:00.000Z	RoboticTao	zodium	Get some different pr0n. Or make your friend reencode it :)
2007-09-04T11:18:00.000Z	zodium	RoboticTao	it's not one movie, it's all the movies
2007-09-04T11:19:00.000Z	zodium	RoboticTao	i just used that one for testing
2007-09-04T11:19:00.000Z	RoboticTao	zodium	That sucks. I would suggest making sure you have all the gstreamer plugins too.
2007-09-04T11:19:00.000Z	zodium	RoboticTao	yeah i'm tired of booting into windows just to watch movies
2007-09-04T11:20:00.000Z	RoboticTao		 Laggyware: I see your been to xbins too. j/k
2007-09-04T11:21:00.000Z	RoboticTao		!botsnack
2007-09-04T11:25:00.000Z	RoboticTao	zodium	If you are still there. Try running this command. You may be missing the gstreamer plugins      sudo apt-get install  gstreamer0.8-plugins  gstreamer0.8-plugins-multiverse  gstreamer0.8-ffmpeg
