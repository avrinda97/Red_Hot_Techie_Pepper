2010-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	Rad-		he's the one everyone goes to for help
2010-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	Rad-		@ elky he says i have to figure out how to autologin as root
2010-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	Rad-		he won't tell me how.
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	Rad-		Okay can anyone tell me WHY no one will tell me how to autologin as root?
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	Rad-		@ nothingspecial can you tell me why no one will tell me?
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	Rad-		Why is it stupid?
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	Rad-		My computer isn't going to explode =\
2010-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	Rad-		I just want to do cool things!
2010-11-05T03:29:00.000Z	Rad-		Then how would I run cool things?
2010-11-05T03:29:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	sudo
2010-11-05T03:29:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	No it does not, but it let's you run cool stuff.
2010-11-05T03:31:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	Yeah, pretty much.
2010-11-05T03:33:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	You can, but in that case you should disable the root account again when done. I think you can use sudo to do the exact same thing without enabling root though.
2010-11-05T03:35:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	In the terminal you can do sudo vim <file>
2010-11-05T03:35:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	That is stupid to do :)
2010-11-05T03:35:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	Don't run that file.
2010-11-05T03:35:00.000Z	Terp	Rad-	It will try to remove everything from your computer.
