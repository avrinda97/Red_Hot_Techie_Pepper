2008-02-02T19:12:00.000Z	bulmer	Yonie	for one, why do you need to create the file in /etc ?
2008-02-02T19:13:00.000Z	Yonie	bulmer	i am doing a tut for my usb phone, it says i need to create a file in /ect/ppp/peers/
2008-02-02T19:13:00.000Z	bulmer	Yonie	okay, then you can sudo mkdir -p /etc/ppp/peers   note: it is etc not ect

2008-02-02T19:14:00.000Z	Yonie	bulmer	what does mkdir -p do?
2008-02-02T19:14:00.000Z	bulmer		bod_-> create them  like so screen; command &   and you can log out
2008-02-02T19:15:00.000Z	bulmer	Yonie	with the correct permissions
2008-02-02T19:15:00.000Z	bulmer		bod_-> not with screen shell
2008-02-02T19:16:00.000Z	bulmer		okay its redundant for the & :)
