2009-03-04T11:33:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		whenever I try to SSH into my ubuntu box i get "Connection closed by <my IP address)"
2009-03-04T11:34:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	have you examined the output of "ssh -vvv -l <user> <IP address>"
2009-03-04T11:35:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	what should it be?
2009-03-04T11:35:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	that verbose output should give you more information as to why it's closing the connection.
2009-03-04T11:37:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	its strange though, I can SSH in locally but not with my DDNS
2009-03-04T11:37:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	and im 99% sure i did the port forwarding right
2009-03-04T11:37:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	what interface is sshd listening on?
2009-03-04T11:38:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	eth1
2009-03-04T11:38:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	id assume it is, it will work on the LAN
2009-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	I'd examine your sshd_config, but beyond that I don't know.
2009-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	where is that id assume /etc/ssh_config right?
2009-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	/etc/ssh/sshd_config
2009-03-04T11:40:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	what should i be looking for in here
2009-03-04T11:41:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	this is where you need to consult "man sshd_config"
2009-03-04T11:42:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	but id be shooting blind, i havent the faintest idea of what im looking for here
2009-03-04T11:42:00.000Z	ectospasm	Comrade-Sergei	I can't help you if you're not willing to read the manual.
2009-03-04T11:42:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	ectospasm	words of an IT man
