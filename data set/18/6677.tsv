2008-04-12T21:03:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Hi guys I've installed gutsy - during install the DHCP phase didn't detect connection. After install I've tried both static, dhcp and roaming but none are working. What's funny though is that another PC (this one) is working just fine, also gutsy, going through the same hub
2008-04-12T21:03:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Any idea what it could be?
2008-04-12T21:04:00.000Z	|Debian|	g[r]eek	ifconfig ?
2008-04-12T21:04:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	I run ifconfig and I get info for eth0
2008-04-12T21:05:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	I imagine that implies the hardware is ok
2008-04-12T21:05:00.000Z	|Debian|	g[r]eek	yeah
2008-04-12T21:05:00.000Z	|Debian|		mhmm
2008-04-12T21:05:00.000Z	|Debian|		minimal install worked fine for me
2008-04-12T21:05:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	Also, my BIOS has a "SMART LAN" test, if I unplug the network cable it says "no connection", and with the cable plugged in it says "Connection found, cable < 10m" - so I imagine the hardware is indeed ok
2008-04-12T21:06:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	But what I don't get is that it doesn't want to get an IP address. I run dhclient eth0 on my current pc and the DHCP server responds and assigns it an address and all is ok. But on the other PC the DHCP server doesn't respond
2008-04-12T21:07:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	Also I've tried configuring manually, iface eth0 inet static etc
2008-04-12T21:07:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	then ifconfig gives all the details (address etc) but still no internet connection
2008-04-12T21:07:00.000Z	|Debian|	g[r]eek	 i can't figure it out
2008-04-12T21:07:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	Can't even ping the router, nor the other laptop on the same network
2008-04-12T21:07:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	I am totally stomped.
2008-04-12T21:07:00.000Z	g[r]eek		*stumped
2008-04-12T21:08:00.000Z	g[r]eek	|Debian|	I thought *maybe* the drivers that have been installed for the network card are not copmatiable but then ifconfig wouldn't work right?
2008-04-12T21:09:00.000Z	|Debian|	g[r]eek	 true
