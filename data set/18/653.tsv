2011-11-09T21:37:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	Runs light years faster for me on my laptop and desktop
2011-11-09T21:38:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	The amount of memory doesn't make it run faster, it just stops it running slower
2011-11-09T21:39:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	Try `free`
2011-11-09T21:39:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	Then paste that to pastebin.com or somewhere
2011-11-09T21:42:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	Ubuntu itself is only using 400MB RAM there. Are you using integrated graphics or separate?
2011-11-09T21:43:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	Have you made sure you have installed the correct drivers?
2011-11-09T21:44:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	What graphics card have you got?
2011-11-09T21:49:00.000Z	CJKay	johnnychimpo	Ubuntu should have an installation candidate for nVidia GLX but I can't seem to grab it at the moment
