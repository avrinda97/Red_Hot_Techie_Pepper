2007-09-15T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] : depends on your packages installed and download speed; I needed 1.4gb downloaded last install, took a several hours for the complete run
2007-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	[nrx] 	nickrud	i'm going from dapper to edgy... i did the apt-get dist-upgrade... and now i'm in adept updater doing 1044 packages ;o
2007-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] : there you go :)
2007-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	[nrx] 	nickrud	then i'll have to go from edgy to fiesty :/
2007-09-15T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] : yup. You can kinda get around that, especially if you have a separate home partition:  you can get a record of the packages you have installed, install feisty, then reload your packages
2007-09-15T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] : less downloading, anyway
2007-09-15T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	strang3love	you have to add the stanza back, what partition is your windows on?
2007-09-15T09:36:00.000Z	[nrx] 	nickrud	a record of the packages i have installed? i don't get you
2007-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] :   dpkg --get-selections > mypackages  , then save that, install feisty, then sudo dpkg --set-selections < mypackages  && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade
2007-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	strang3love	a sec
2007-09-15T09:38:00.000Z	[nrx] 	nickrud	so, when i install fiesty, that'll speed up the update process\stage?
2007-09-15T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	strang3love	add http://pastebin.ca/698615 below the AUTOMAGIC line in menu.lst
2007-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] : it'll skip the edgy download & install, save a couple hours, anyway.
2007-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	[nrx] 	nickrud	i'm already half way through edgy tho
2007-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud		[nrx] : then just keep going, no big deal really
2007-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	[nrx] 	nickrud	i'll remember that for the future tho :)
