2009-11-02T16:36:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Oh no! I cant run the Ubuntu 9.10 liveCD because I think it has compiz enabled and that doesnt work on my machine. But when I boot from a hardy disk I cant mount my ext4 partitions. Can I get a livecd that doesnt have compiz?
2009-11-02T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JonathanEllis	uninstall the driver it is using which will make it use vesa and not allow compiz
2009-11-02T16:39:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ActionParsnip1	Thanks. But I cant get that far as the graphics are screwed. Could I do ctrl alt F1 from a live cd to get to a terminal?
2009-11-02T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JonathanEllis	if you can do it in an installed system, yes
2009-11-02T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JonathanEllis	you'll need to restart the x server but you should be fine
2009-11-02T16:40:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ActionParsnip1	The other thing is I understand Ctrl Alt Backspace doesnt work anymore so now I dont know hot to restart x

2009-11-02T16:41:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ActionParsnip1	Thanks. I guess I need to make a customised livecd
2009-11-02T16:46:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ActionParsnip1	alt k printscreen does not restart X. It tries to take a screen snapshot

2009-11-02T16:48:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ActionParsnip1	Thanks. I was just wondering if there was a restartx command. I'll have a look in the wiki
2009-11-16T19:10:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ActionParsnip1	Good afternoon. Hope I am not bothering you with this question. I want to share files between two computers both running Ubuntu. When I try to share my home folder /home/jonathan by right clicking in nautilus it prompts me to install the Windows network sharing service.

2009-11-16T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	JonathanEllis	samba works nice and fast here, i think you should read up on both and compare to your requirements
