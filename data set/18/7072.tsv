2008-04-17T13:00:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	Twim4	i did uninstall the kernel just now :( .. plan to wait until hardy full release, and asked for official cd then..
2008-04-17T13:01:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	Twim4	then i'll fresh install everything.
2008-04-17T13:01:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	Twim4	but i wonder what is the problem, maybe i didnt upgrade xorg as well .
