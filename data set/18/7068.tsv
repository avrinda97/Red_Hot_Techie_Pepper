2008-02-13T05:24:00.000Z	bruenig	HangukMiguk	check rhythmbox -h for usage info, a lot of players have such things but rhythmbox being gnome and having the gnome philosophy of "don't add that feature, it will make people's head explode", it might not
2008-02-13T05:25:00.000Z	HangukMiguk	bruenig	i tried that, found nothing.  i'm wanting to display my current track in conky without having to switch to audacious or xmms, anyone know of a script?
2008-02-13T05:25:00.000Z	bruenig	HangukMiguk	you wouldn't want to do that in that manner
2008-02-13T05:26:00.000Z	HangukMiguk	bruenig	how should i do it?
2008-02-13T05:26:00.000Z	bruenig	HangukMiguk	your cpu will thank you
2008-02-13T05:26:00.000Z	bruenig		well xmms works (I believe) by writing a text file everytime it changes a track which is what those monitors use
2008-02-13T05:27:00.000Z	bruenig		but running rhythmbox all of the time to get that info would make your computer cry

2008-02-13T05:27:00.000Z	HangukMiguk	bruenig	that's the problem, i'd use xmms if it would support my AAC files
2008-02-13T05:28:00.000Z	HangukMiguk	bruenig	rhythmbox is the only one i've found to support it
2008-02-13T05:28:00.000Z	bruenig	HangukMiguk	ok... figure something out, I am just saying rhythmbox is not viable for what you are talking about, I use sonata + mpd and conky has built in goodness for mpd
2008-02-13T05:28:00.000Z	HangukMiguk	bruenig	link me to mpd?
2008-02-13T05:28:00.000Z	HangukMiguk		or is it in apt?
2008-02-13T05:29:00.000Z	bruenig	HangukMiguk	I don't know if ubuntu doesn't compile in aac support or something but there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to find a plethora of players which can use it seeing as most players just use one of the few codec backends which aac would be supported for
2008-02-13T05:29:00.000Z	bruenig	HangukMiguk	it might be in apt, I don't use ubuntu
2008-02-13T05:29:00.000Z	HangukMiguk	bruenig	hmmmm, well i know my gstreamer plugins make it work. if xmms has the plugins, i could use that
