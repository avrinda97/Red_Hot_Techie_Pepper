2009-04-11T12:14:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	Do you happen to know where standard sound files are kept?
2009-04-11T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	"standard"?  /usr/share/*
2009-06-08T04:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	You can specify more than one, but yes.
2009-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	7 (well, 6, and then 7 is X)
2009-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	ok, so if I only have F1 & F2 that's wrong :\
2009-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	and what's supposed to be above F7?
2009-06-13T05:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	Not necessarily.  `ps aux | grep getty` will tell you all the terminals that are running.  You might have it configured to only have two.
2009-06-13T05:33:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	I figured it out - stupid mistake - so stupid I won't tell you :P
2009-06-13T05:33:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	but, above F7?
2009-09-14T05:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	Just configure root's PS1 to be red
2009-09-14T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	*your* bashrc won't be sourced when you root, root's will.
2009-10-19T02:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	You can do a dry-run of any apt-get command with --simulate (see the man page for alternative/shorter flags for the same thing)
2009-10-19T02:38:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	thanks
2009-11-06T02:03:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	thanks, do you know the package name?
2009-11-06T02:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Mike_lifeguard	There's a few.  Check out plplot
2009-11-06T02:05:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Flannel	nm, found it
