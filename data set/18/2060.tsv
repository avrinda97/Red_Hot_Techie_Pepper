2011-01-30T21:07:00.000Z	ChesterX		Hi, I just tried to download some software from the msdn academie alliance portal (software for students). The problem is the following: to download the software you have to execute an .exe file, however I don't think ubuntu can do this (or at least I have the right application installed). How could I make this work?
2011-01-30T21:07:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	whats the software
2011-01-30T21:09:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	it is windows 7 (student edition) - I ll need it in dual boot to work with some of my university's programs :-/
2011-01-30T21:14:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	any suggestions?
2011-01-30T21:15:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	whats the software you need to execute to get the windows 7
2011-02-03T16:19:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-02-03T16:19:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	check out medibuntu.org also for packages, ie related to playing dvd
2011-07-14T17:59:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	no
2011-07-14T17:59:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	whats the app
2011-07-14T18:00:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	it is not really an app. rather an gui for an already 11.04 compatible app (aircrack-ng)
2011-07-14T18:00:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	ok, whats the package name
2011-07-14T18:01:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	this package is not in the ubuntu repository - but i can give you the sourceforge link
2011-07-14T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	the package name will suffice
2011-07-14T18:03:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	main app package name "aircrack-ng", gui package name "wepcrackgui"
2011-07-14T18:05:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	for lucid? a search of the repos shows no such package
2011-07-14T18:07:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	as i told you before this package does not form part of any of the ubuntu repository
2011-07-14T18:10:00.000Z	bazhang	ChesterX	no idea sorry. you could ask in #aircrack-ng I suppose
2011-07-14T18:11:00.000Z	ChesterX	bazhang	will do thank you (btw, that means there is no way to run a compatibility mode in ubuntu whatsoever, right?)
