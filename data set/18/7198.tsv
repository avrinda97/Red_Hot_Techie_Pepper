2008-01-30T11:49:00.000Z	singlesun		hello everyone, i have a series of questions... i am about to switch over all the computers in my house to ubuntu... however... before doing so, I am concerned about 1 thing, the router that everyone uses is a Belkin wireless G router.. the driver files and installation CD will not run on Ubunutu... is there a solution for this?
2008-01-30T11:50:00.000Z	phuzion	singlesun	there is more than likely a web based interface that you can use to administrate the router
2008-01-30T11:51:00.000Z	phuzion	singlesun	then an option is to reset the router
2008-01-30T11:52:00.000Z	phuzion	singlesun	reset the router, and administrate it from http://192.168.1.1
2008-01-30T11:52:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	but I have to connect the router directly to my ethernet port right? to do that?
2008-01-30T11:53:00.000Z	phuzion	singlesun	not necessarily, I can administrate my WRT54G via wifi
2008-01-30T11:54:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	hmmm ... so basically reset this thing by unplugging, and holding a pin down in the reset ... then connect to router via IP, and set up as an access point? <-- (and remember password)
2008-01-30T11:55:00.000Z	phuzion	singlesun	no, don't unplug
2008-01-30T11:56:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	one sec, let me boot up my other computer... you say you can administer the router from another wireless adapter based pc?
2008-01-30T11:57:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	well im booting the old tank laptop quick
2008-01-30T12:01:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	soldats i got a timeout when i tried to connect to the router from my laptop by using 192.168.1.1
2008-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	i would also like that cool clouds picture ;)
2008-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	i did use some of the "matrix looking green letter pictures" that seemed to work well
2008-01-31T06:21:00.000Z	singlesun	phuzion	hey maybe this will work http://www.beryl-themes.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/55604-1.jpg you like that one?
