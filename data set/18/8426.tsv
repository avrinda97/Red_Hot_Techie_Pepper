2007-08-24T06:16:00.000Z	Tigran_		Ontza: im gonna try reseting router settings, that doesnt work....oh well linux. back to windows =/
2007-08-24T06:16:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	you are running linux on your router?
2007-08-24T06:16:00.000Z	Tigran_	bruenig	ehm..idk, its a netgear router
2007-08-24T06:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	ok well the OS of your computer has nothing to do with the router
2007-08-24T06:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	the router has its own OS
2007-08-24T06:18:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	so changing your pc's OS will have no effect on the router
2007-08-24T06:18:00.000Z	Tigran_	bruenig	when did i say that?
2007-08-24T06:18:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	what card?
2007-08-24T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	that is the madwifi driver isn't it?
2007-08-24T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	well there should be no problem then
2007-08-24T06:20:00.000Z	Tigran_	bruenig	there is :P
2007-08-24T06:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	it is probably some ubuntu thing, they abstract so much stuff that I don't have the energy to try to even go through the steps of figuring it out
2007-08-24T06:21:00.000Z	Tigran_	bruenig	meh you're gonna make me go back to windows?
2007-08-24T06:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	just so much effort, I don't think you realize
2007-08-24T06:22:00.000Z	Tigran_	bruenig	can you at least point me in the right direction, some keywords to search, what to look for
2007-08-24T06:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	that is the problem, it is so abstracted, that finding any support for it is near impossible, click and pray, the prayers fall through and you are screwed
2007-08-24T06:23:00.000Z	Tigran_	bruenig	ok...well what do you suggest I do?
2007-08-24T06:24:00.000Z	bruenig	Tigran_	might find a distro whose installation process is not as abstracted
