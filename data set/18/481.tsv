2012-02-23T20:11:00.000Z	acidrain		i have port 25, 110, and 143 forwarded. squirrelmail connection refused by imap server. any reasons why?
2012-02-23T20:12:00.000Z	acidrain		ERROR: Connection dropped by IMAP server.
2012-02-23T20:12:00.000Z	Trevor69420	acidrain	what's the IMAP server you are using?
2012-02-23T20:12:00.000Z	Trevor69420		and is it on one of those ports acidrain
2012-02-23T20:14:00.000Z	acidrain	Trevor69420	yes it is on port 143. how to i get imap version?
2012-02-23T20:15:00.000Z	Trevor69420		acidraid not sure...  are you hosting your own mail server or are you trying to get squirrelmail to retrieve from a remote mail service (like pair networks or gmail or something)
2012-02-23T20:16:00.000Z	Trevor69420	acidrain	i've only ever ran squirrelmail over SMTP
2012-02-23T20:16:00.000Z	acidrain	Trevor69420	so you are suggesting i change squirrelmail port to 25?
2012-02-23T20:16:00.000Z	Trevor69420		also acidrain the other thing is that some ISPs if it's a home line may block some of those ports to prevent you from hosting mail and web servers
2012-02-23T20:17:00.000Z	Trevor69420	acidrain	only if your mail server is set up for SMTP
2012-02-23T20:17:00.000Z	acidrain	Trevor69420	but thats not the case here. i had a mail server up 5 months ago on a different box
2012-02-23T20:17:00.000Z	acidrain		mail is on 25. imap on 143. courier on 110
2012-02-23T20:17:00.000Z	Trevor69420		what are you using as the mail server tho?
2012-02-23T20:17:00.000Z	Trevor69420		postfix?
2012-02-23T20:17:00.000Z	acidrain		yeah
2012-02-23T20:18:00.000Z	acidrain		SM is supposed to be using imap to authenticate to the smtp server
2012-02-23T20:18:00.000Z	acidrain		i guess it cannot do it in plain text?
2012-02-23T20:18:00.000Z	Trevor69420	acidrain	give me a sec to read over some docs...  i havent done this in ages
