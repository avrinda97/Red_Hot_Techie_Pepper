2011-04-12T10:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	lets move on please
2011-04-12T10:32:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	will do. i got the answer to what i needed, anyway. thanks everyone
2011-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	need more details
2011-08-18T05:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	what is the exact issue with the indicator applet
2011-08-18T05:12:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	using too much cpu.
2011-08-18T05:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	what other processes do you have running, ie major ones
2011-08-18T05:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	and this persists, when you create a guest account?
2011-08-18T05:15:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	guest account? haven't made any
2011-08-18T05:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	that would be  a first step, hardly ever need to completely reinstall for something like this
2011-08-18T05:17:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	so I should create a guest account then?
2011-08-18T05:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	have you not already done so, and tested it?
2011-08-18T05:20:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	no, i haven't. let me try
2011-08-18T05:21:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	so i should log out, make a guest account and log in from there?
2011-08-18T05:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	system---administration---users and groups---add  log out, log in with new user
2011-08-18T05:24:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	ok, will do
2011-08-18T05:34:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	ah, indicator-applet isn't on anymore
2011-08-18T05:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Cortex	so a video driver issue, or perhaps a theme would be my guess
2011-08-18T05:36:00.000Z	Cortex	bazhang	probably. it's fine, now, for the time being
