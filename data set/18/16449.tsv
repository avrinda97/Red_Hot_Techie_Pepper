2004-09-29T07:59:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	ah, no
2004-09-29T07:59:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	installs the base system only, intended for clueful people to customize
2004-10-02T06:52:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	does dpkg-depcheck help?
2004-10-02T06:52:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	will try
2004-10-02T06:54:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	thats much better, thank you.
2004-10-10T11:31:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	I thought we already had 0.8
2004-10-10T14:04:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	(as in, Monday)
2004-10-10T13:44:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	hm it was .7 last i looked (ipw)

2004-10-10T14:03:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	neat.
2004-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	chmod +x /home/brandon/bin/firefox-tabs
2004-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	all my bin/ is +x
2004-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	either that or the filesystem's mounted noexec
2004-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	hm its on nfs, but it worked yesterday
2004-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	noexec snuck in there somehow.. thanks
2004-10-15T07:01:00.000Z	Kamion	tseng	I tend to avoid noexec everywhere, since it doesn't really offer any benefit
2004-10-23T11:40:00.000Z	tseng	Kamion	kdrive (and I believe X) can run a (slow) X server on top of linux framebuffer
