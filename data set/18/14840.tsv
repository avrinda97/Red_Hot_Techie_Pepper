2005-06-05T09:06:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31		Just added a secondary pci trident video card. Was hoping it would just start working, but it didn't. Was I expecting too much?
2005-06-05T09:06:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	you have to configure it in xorg.conf
2005-06-05T09:06:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	read the gentoo guide to dual monitors
2005-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	gentoo, isn't that another distro? 'i'm on ubuntu. Should hotplug have reognised it?
2005-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	the gentoo tutorial doesnt have anything gentoo specific in it
2005-06-05T09:08:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	it may have recognised the monitor and card but that doesnt mean itll use it
2005-06-05T09:08:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	tbh dual monitors with X is a bitch
2005-06-05T09:11:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	thanks for the encouragement.
2005-06-05T09:13:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	ah actually that wont work
2005-06-05T09:13:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	you dont want to follow it word for word
2005-06-05T09:14:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	just set up xorg.conf like it says, and take a backup, and know how to revert to that backup if X doesnt start
2005-06-05T09:17:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	great... what am I getting myself into??
2005-06-05T09:18:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	okay then, how do I start X with a particular xorg.conf?
2005-06-05T09:18:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	and how do I set it to boot into X using a certain .conf?
2005-06-05T09:18:00.000Z	kestas	FlyingSquirrel31	if you dont know how to alter, back up, and restore your xorg.conf then you shouldnt be trying to use dual monitors
2005-06-05T09:20:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	If I just backup the original, and I know how to start it manually, I should be safe, no?
2005-06-05T09:20:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	I'm willing to learn.
2005-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel31	kestas	 this doesn't look so bad...
