2011-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	io_error		Hello. I inherited an Ubuntu 9.04 server, which I want to upgrade to 10.04 LTS. When I run sudo do-release-upgradeAn upgrade from 'jaunty' to 'lucid' is not supported with this tool."
2011-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	You can't do that
2011-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	I gathered as much from the error message.
2011-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	That is NOT helpful.
2011-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	Jaunty is EOL... And, you can only upgrade to the next release, meaning Karmic, i.e. 9.10
2011-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	From THERE, you can upgrade to 10.04
2011-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	And how do I upgrade to 9.10, so I can then upgrade to 10.04?
2011-08-26T08:57:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	Try editing /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades setting "Prompt=normal"
2011-08-26T08:58:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	It was already on Prompt=normal. And it decided it wanted to go directly from jaunty to lucid, with that error message I started with.
2011-08-26T08:58:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	Weird... :/ Well this tool has no freaking manpage so I can't really know the syntax for specifying what to upgrade to
2011-08-26T09:00:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	LOL, when I have to resort to IRC for a question, run like hell :)
2011-08-26T09:00:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	lol :D
2011-08-26T09:01:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	Another reason why a rolling release distro for a server is a better idea tho
2011-08-26T09:01:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	I'm just NOT going there :P
2011-08-26T09:02:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	I know, just saying
2011-08-26T09:03:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	Most of my other boxen are CentOS :P
2011-08-26T09:04:00.000Z	theadmin	io_error	Um... ew. Sorry but anything RPM-based freaks me out
2011-08-26T09:05:00.000Z	io_error	theadmin	heh, I must be used to it. I've been using red hat since it was in somebody's garage.
