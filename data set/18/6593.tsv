2009-06-09T03:40:00.000Z	FactTech		Question: Does anyone here know ANYTHING about accessing a Netware server from Ubuntu?
2009-06-09T03:41:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	easier with SuSE... but that's the extent of my knowledge.  not sure if anyone has ported the SuSE NetWare package to other Linuxes or not.
2009-06-09T03:41:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- Thanks. I'll look into this.
2009-06-09T03:42:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	Novell is in charge of SuSE, if you didn't know.
2009-06-09T03:42:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- I did. Someone on the answers board is looking to get it to work with Ubuntu, and I can't find anything helpful for him.
2009-06-09T03:43:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	theoretically possible, but I've not seen it.  if you happen to find a way will you let me know?  I could put it to some use.  I teach part-time at the local university and our network shares there use NetWare.
2009-06-09T03:43:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- sure!
2009-06-09T03:44:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- one possible tip -- it may be possible to connect to shares using smbclient. I saw some old posts somewhere that suggested this, but no details, and I have no Netware server to try it out on.
2009-06-09T03:45:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	hmm.  wouldn't think so.  but I haven't exactly tested it :)
2009-06-09T03:53:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- Look into ncpmount command, seems it was available in hardy but not in intrepid or jaunty repositories.
2009-06-09T03:55:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- or maybe it is available as part of the ncpfs package, not sure.
2009-06-09T03:56:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=204690 as an example discussion
2009-06-09T03:57:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	thanks, I'll check that out.  I wonder why support was ceased.
2009-06-09T03:57:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- not sure it was if it's just part of another package, but it looked like some change in a library broke it at one point (saw bug reports with titles about this but didn't read them), so maybe it just got dropped by the wayside.
2009-06-09T03:58:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	still, surprised somebody didn't make a backport.  not popular enough perhaps.
2009-06-09T03:58:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- probably. I haven't seen a Netware server since my Windows 3.11 days. :)
2009-06-09T03:58:00.000Z	PhotoJim	FactTech	:) other than at the university here, I haven't seen it in ages either.
2009-06-09T04:02:00.000Z	FactTech	PhotoJim	-- thanks for providing the extra impetus to keep looking. Hope it helps.
