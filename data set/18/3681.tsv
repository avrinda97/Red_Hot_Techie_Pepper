2010-05-23T22:23:00.000Z	wrapster		im having trouble trying to understand the way space is being managed...
2010-05-23T22:23:00.000Z	wrapster		just a week ago i had to reinstall ubuntu because of lack of space..
2010-05-23T22:23:00.000Z	wrapster		now i have a fairly new machine and all of a sudden i see only 5.6G being free
2010-05-23T22:24:00.000Z	wrapster		what is taking up so much of space? /var/cache/apt/archives is 500M and i have a few other data that is at max worth about another 100M..
2010-05-23T22:25:00.000Z	wrapster		I have so far only installed vbox,nvidia drivers and thats about it.
2010-05-23T22:25:00.000Z	phlak_user	wrapster	where are you seeing your free disk space info?
2010-05-23T22:26:00.000Z	phlak_user	wrapster	did you type df -h in a terminal?
2010-05-23T22:26:00.000Z	wrapster	phlak_user	df -h

2010-05-23T22:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	wrapster	all your disk space is there; you just need to mount the other partitions
2010-05-23T22:33:00.000Z	wrapster	phlak_user	yes.. i understand that.. but my question was where to find out why the / partition is gobbling up space?
2010-05-23T22:34:00.000Z	wrapster	phlak_user	fine.. i'll take a look at it.. Thanks for your help
2010-05-23T22:34:00.000Z	phlak_user	wrapster	you might have selected that as the / and everything else below it; normally it is a good idea to have separate partitions for /home /var etc etc
