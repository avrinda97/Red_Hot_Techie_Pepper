2010-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	henrique		Hi mka

2010-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	henrique		Add to pannel does not show the option
2010-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	you're stuck.. you're going to have to leave it on forever! :) (April 1 is just around the corner)
2010-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	can you right mouse click the area and "Add" ??
2010-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	click your name and see if there's a drop down menu
2010-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	then when you right mouse click and choose "add".. look for a different appelate .. maybe something called user switcher?
2010-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	henrique	Scunizi	thats the one I used to show my name but thats all it shows. not the different buttons.
2010-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	keep looking a different one has to be there someplace
2010-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	henrique	Scunizi	Must be something custom for netbook remix.
2010-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	maybe one called "shutdown"?
2010-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	I just reformatted my usb key that was setup to boot to unr otherwise I'd boot on my laptop and look as well.
2010-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	henrique	Scunizi	thank you for your help I'll do some external search on google or ask in the forums
2010-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	good luck.. it's out there that's for sure.
2010-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	henrique	Scunizi	thats for sure. I can't be the first jack ass to remove that for no reason whatsoever
2010-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	henrique	we learn better that way ;)
