2007-12-07T19:28:00.000Z	bonkers-matt		hi , just got a removeable hard drive and i want to format it in ubuntu but gpareted doesn't see it , i can see it with fdisk -l. how do i format it then?
2007-12-07T19:30:00.000Z	bonkers-matt		i mean "external hard drive"
2007-12-07T19:31:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	to share between windows and linux?
2007-12-07T19:33:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	no, just linux
2007-12-07T19:33:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	did you start up with the drive inserted or hotplug it?
2007-12-07T19:34:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	i'm not sure i understand the question. i just plugged the disk in and then openned up gparted, gparted didnt list it but fdisk -l did. now i want to format the drive as FAT32
2007-12-07T19:35:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	you're running gutsy right? was the computer already running when you plugged in the drive (hotplug) or did you start up the computer with the drive attached
2007-12-07T19:36:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	sorry, yes gutsy, yes computer always running . its also a server so i dont turn it off
2007-12-07T19:36:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	not sure what new drives are formatted in these days--could it be ntfs?
2007-12-07T19:37:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	its not formated
2007-12-07T19:38:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	well you can use a command line method to format it
2007-12-07T19:38:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	yes im looking at the man page for mkfs now
2007-12-07T19:39:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	brobostigon if i want fstype FAT32 shout i write "-t fat32" or "-t vfat"?
2007-12-07T19:41:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	err sorry--cfdisk (ncurses based) might be easier I defer to brobostigon for the -t vfat question
2007-12-07T19:42:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	thanks ,btw what is 'ncurses' it recently came up when i was trying to compile a debian kernel
2007-12-07T19:44:00.000Z	bazhang	bonkers-matt	ncurses is kind of a beefy version of cli where you can tab through choices
2007-12-07T19:44:00.000Z	bonkers-matt	bazhang	thanks - good explanation !
