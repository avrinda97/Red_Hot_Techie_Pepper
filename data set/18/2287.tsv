2010-10-29T05:28:00.000Z	delinquentme		back up and running and destroy whatever crud the windows install has done
2010-10-29T05:30:00.000Z	delinquentme		ok, good to know .. but how do i repair the boot record
2010-10-29T05:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	Do you have a liveCD?
2011-07-04T11:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	You probably don't want to completely replace $PATH, rather you should add to it with 'PATH=$PATH:/path/to/new/directory/'. Is /home/unf-ubu/biohack/crossbow-1.1.2 a regular file or a directory?
2011-07-04T11:05:00.000Z	delinquentme	Jordan_U	yeah its a directory
2011-07-04T11:11:00.000Z	delinquentme	Jordan_U	that above question was for you :D  .. no rush though
2012-03-10T08:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	A lot, #bash can probably give you all the details.
2012-09-06T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	What do you mean by "update"?
2012-09-06T08:02:00.000Z	delinquentme	Jordan_U	I need to get the .iso corresponding to the existing version that I've got installed
2012-09-06T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	You don't use an iso of any kind to update, unless by "update" you mean "Install a newer verison of Ubuntu over the older version", in which case it doesn't matter what the previous version was.
2012-09-06T08:06:00.000Z	delinquentme	Jordan_U	Im asking about VirtualBox .. and which architecture ( AMDx64  or i386 ) corresponds to the current host OS of ubuntu 10.04 that I run
2012-09-06T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	You can find out the current architecture you're using with "uname -m".
2012-11-16T04:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	for file in db/migrate/*whatever*; do gedit "$file"; done
2012-11-16T05:00:00.000Z	delinquentme	Jordan_U	Not bad.
2012-11-16T05:01:00.000Z	delinquentme	Jordan_U	no need for grep eh?
2012-11-16T05:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	Not if what you need to do is covered by shell globbing.
2012-11-16T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	delinquentme	By the way, I highly recommend reading http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls .
