2006-09-16T16:37:00.000Z	habeeb		Greetings, I have to understand the *nix world. What is GNU? And I'm not talking about the licence. I'm talking about the site gnu.org. And I know its not Unix, but why is it about it?
2006-09-16T16:38:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	Here's the short version: Unix was an operating system with a lot of great tools, but the folks who owned it wouldn't make it "free" - free as in speech, not as in beer.  People couldn't hack on it and change it to their liking.
2006-09-16T16:39:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	So, an enteprising fella in the 80's decided to make a carbon copy of Unix, but free
2006-09-16T16:39:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	I'm following you.
2006-09-16T16:39:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	He called it GNU.  It used to stand for something that actually meant something ( I think), but now it's just GNU is Not Unix, because it is free!
2006-09-16T16:40:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	off topic, but FreeBSD is *nix?
2006-09-16T16:40:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	No idea.  I was under the impression that the BSDs weren't linux.
2006-09-16T16:40:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	winrar
2006-09-16T16:41:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	don't worry - cruise control for col.
2006-09-16T16:41:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	Is it right to say "Linux is made in C, because the kernel is in C?"
2006-09-16T16:42:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	That sounds like more of an opinion thing.  I mean, sure, the kernel is in C, but I"m sur ethere are modules coded in C++.
2006-09-16T16:42:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	Yep
2006-09-16T16:42:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	Man, how hardcore would it be if someone started with JUST the kernel and built a distro from scratch, just to use on their own, not to actually distribute?
2006-09-16T16:43:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	I'm actually asking theoritical questions, I'm really happy with the current distributions :P
2006-09-16T16:43:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	I just want to get some basic things.
2006-09-16T16:45:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	wtf are modules. I know how to load them (fglrx, vesa etc) but wtf are they?
2006-09-16T16:45:00.000Z	Tonren	habeeb	You know, I'm honestly not sure
2006-09-16T16:45:00.000Z	habeeb	Tonren	I see.
