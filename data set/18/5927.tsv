2009-07-16T03:01:00.000Z	spikemcc		hey are you jerks or what ?
2009-07-16T03:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	what do you want us to do with that?  You keep pasting that link without any other info
2009-07-16T03:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	what is the problem what you are having with that xorg config? (yes, I read the paste)
2009-07-16T03:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	where did you get the driver from?
2009-07-16T03:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	you're not using the restricted drivers from ubuntu's repos?
2009-07-16T03:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	we only officially support the drivers in the repos
2009-07-16T03:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	was it working before you installed the 2nd monitor?
2009-07-16T03:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	what exactly is broken about the current setup?
2009-07-16T03:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	what about it isn't working right?
2009-07-16T03:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	other than onlt having 800x600, can you still use both monitors?
2009-07-16T03:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	are you still using both monitors, or are you just using one?
2009-07-16T03:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	I'm trying.  Please be patient
2009-07-16T03:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution might have some information that can help you with fixing the resolution
2009-07-16T03:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	looking at the most recent xorg config, I didn't see any modelines in it
2009-07-16T03:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	spikemcc	other than through xrandr and adding modelines to xorg.conf, I'm out of ideas
