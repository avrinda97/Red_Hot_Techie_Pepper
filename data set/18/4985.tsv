2009-07-02T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Barridus	 xubuntu has less features also
2009-07-02T04:36:00.000Z	Barridus	Dr_Willis	huh?  why are you triggering my highlights for no reason
2009-07-02T04:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Barridus	 bad tab completion. :)
2009-07-08T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Barridus	 ive never noticed a openbox-gnome - you can run gnome and use openbox..
2009-07-08T04:35:00.000Z	Barridus	Dr_Willis	i can't get ubuntu to use openbox.  i select openbox-gnome (or is it gnome-openbox, whatever :) in the gdm login session selection, and after login i am in metacity not opembox
2009-07-08T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Barridus	 make a custom desktop session perhaps for gdm that launches just openbox then set openbox to run what gnome parts you want perhaps.. or it could be something else is   some how making openbox quit and spawn metacity.
2009-07-08T04:38:00.000Z	Barridus	Dr_Willis	in hardy i simply installed the openbox package and selected it as the session
2010-01-11T01:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Barridus	 try accessing the machines via typing in the ip instead of the machine name.
2010-01-11T01:01:00.000Z	Barridus	Dr_Willis	i can access shared files manually, and i can live with that.  it's the printers i can't get to work
2010-01-11T01:04:00.000Z	Barridus	Dr_Willis	(or anyone)  this is as far as i an get to my printer.  WORKGROUP is the workgroup name and JD is the machine name of the pc that has the printer shared.  so samba is at least working on some level?  http://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i44/solidus0079/Screenshot.png
2010-09-07T06:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Barridus	 give the usb drives a proper Label and they should mount to /media/LabelName
