2010-07-16T00:40:00.000Z	falconic		hey guys.. I am trying to setup a Ubuntu virtual machine based dev environment for ruby
2010-07-16T00:41:00.000Z	falconic		on my laptop.. I have given 2 GB RAM ..
2010-07-16T00:41:00.000Z	falconic		and I am on an i5 processor
2010-07-16T00:41:00.000Z	falconic		but the vm seems a little sluggish for development.. are there some optimizations which I can do to increase the performance ?
2010-07-16T00:42:00.000Z	falconic		I have also tried on a Mac 10.6.4
2010-07-16T00:42:00.000Z	falconic		but again the Vm seems a little sluggish.
2010-07-16T00:44:00.000Z	falconic		I have 512 MB ram for it.
2010-07-16T00:44:00.000Z	bogdomania	falconic	add more RAM
2010-07-16T00:44:00.000Z	falconic	bogdomania	2 GB out of 4GB ... is that less ?
2010-07-16T00:45:00.000Z	bogdomania	falconic	what are you developing?
2010-07-16T00:46:00.000Z	falconic	bogdomania	Ruby
2010-07-16T00:47:00.000Z	bogdomania	falconic	on ruby you can`t do very large projects whatsoever, therefore, with 2gb  ram and an intel i5 should work just fine..
2010-07-16T00:47:00.000Z	falconic	bogdomania	I use netbeans and post gres for development
2010-07-16T00:48:00.000Z	falconic	bogdomania	btw.. what makes u feel ruby cant handle big projects ?
2010-07-16T00:48:00.000Z	falconic	bogdomania	no comparing the too :)
2010-07-16T00:49:00.000Z	falconic	bogdomania	any suggested optimizations for a vm machine ?
2010-07-16T00:51:00.000Z	bogdomania	falconic	depends on how well optimized is the SO && apps
2010-07-16T00:53:00.000Z	bogdomania	falconic	btw, compile you own kernel,from source,clean
