2011-01-18T22:31:00.000Z	sugoruyo		anyone have any idea at all about installing ubuntu on a macbook?
2011-01-18T22:32:00.000Z	sipior	sugoruyo	"macbook" refers to a rather large swath of machines at this point. which one are you interested in?
2011-01-18T22:33:00.000Z	sugoruyo	sipior	ok for the third time: macbook2,1 i put the disc in and it won't boot
2011-01-18T22:35:00.000Z	sugoruyo		i have already installed 10.04 some time back, as well as the latest mint, so i have refit, and it shows me three options, the first just returns an error message, the other two give me a command prompt asking what my cd boot type is and expect an answer from one of two options which are empty, but that's no problem cause it's completely unresponsive

2011-01-18T22:36:00.000Z	sugoruyo	sipior	i already know that doc, but it won't help me
2011-01-18T22:36:00.000Z	sugoruyo		nothing on about mb2,1 and 10.10
2011-01-18T22:37:00.000Z	sipior	sugoruyo	surely the instructions for 10.04 are not so different. have you tried them?
2011-01-18T22:39:00.000Z	sugoruyo	sipior	as i said i already had 10.04 on it and a mint version as well, i also recall installing 10.10 at some point... those instructions are useless to me, they refer to getting things working *after* installing when i can't even get the thing to boot, the generic instructions it links too are equally useless
2011-01-18T22:40:00.000Z	sipior	sugoruyo	have you considered that the problem may lie with your boot media?
2011-01-18T22:40:00.000Z	sugoruyo	sipior	i have which is why i tested an ubuntu 10.10 i386 cd, an amd64 one, the alternates for both amd64 and i386 and the kubuntu amd64 standard install cd
2011-01-18T22:41:00.000Z	sugoruyo		they all do the same thing
2011-01-18T22:41:00.000Z	sipior		sugoruyo you mentioned that you had installed 10.04 earlier. why not do that again, and then upgrade?
2011-01-18T22:42:00.000Z	sugoruyo	sipior	because i don't want to install ubuntu, but kubuntu, however while troubleshooting i realised that ubuntu won't boot either, so per your suggestion i should download kubuntu 10.04 hope it installs, then do the dist-upgrade up to 10.10 hoping it will work...
2011-01-18T22:43:00.000Z	sipior	sugoruyo	yes.
2011-01-18T22:44:00.000Z	sugoruyo	sipior	that's not feasible, it would take too long for something that risks running into the exact same problem...
2011-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	sugoruyo	do what you want, i don't care.
2011-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	sugoruyo	mac os x is nice.
