2007-07-24T11:55:00.000Z	lmosher		When I go to resume from suspend, my screen remains black. When I move the mouse I get graphical artifacts, but if I do ctrl+alt+F1 I can get to a console (can't see it) but I can login and shutdown from there (but screen remains w/ artifacts)
2007-07-24T11:55:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	dmsg ?
2007-07-24T11:56:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	sorry I've forgotten how to read that log. What do I do?
2007-07-24T11:57:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	next time, login, and type sudo dmesg > ~/dmesg.log
2007-07-24T11:58:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	then, after you reboot, less the file and see if anything pops out at you
2007-07-24T11:58:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	dmesg is kept in ram, that's why i'm having you save it to a file before rebooting
2007-07-24T11:59:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	Ok I'll try that. I'll reboot, save the log, and try again.
2007-07-24T12:00:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	Do I need to log out and back in, restart gdm, or physically reboot?
2007-07-24T12:01:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	whatever you need to do to be able to read the screen again
2007-07-24T12:01:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	basically i want you to get the screen not readable, then save dmesg to a log, then read it...
2007-07-24T12:02:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	ohhh ok. Right, hopefully I can do that, I'll just have to type carefully :)
2007-07-24T12:02:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	Still here?
2007-07-24T12:03:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	yeah...
2007-07-24T12:04:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	Ok just to clarify, you want the dmesg log while I'm i the blind state, b/c if I reboot it gets lost? In that case I'll type the command in the TTY1 so (hopefully) I can just switch to that console and hit enter to save the log
2007-07-24T12:04:00.000Z	Maximander	lmosher	yeah, then after you reboot, check it out with "tail" or "less" and see if you find anything interesting
2007-07-24T12:05:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	ok will do. brb
2007-07-24T12:21:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	I went through the log, didn't find anything strange, really. One thing (ata6) reported "port disabled, ignoring" and "APCI get timing mode failed". Also got one "pnp: Device 00:06 does not support activation." and "pnp: Failed to activate device 00:07...
2007-07-24T12:21:00.000Z	lmosher	Maximander	: Everything else just said 'suspend', 'LATE suspend', 'EARLY resume' or 'resume'
