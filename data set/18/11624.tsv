2006-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	combox		what channel could help me with installing ActiveX for Mozilla on Ubuntu 5.1??
2006-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	combox		can anyone point me in the direction of someone who knows about installing AciveX for Mozilla
2006-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	sys8976	combox	are you talking in linux?
2006-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	sys8976	combox	you should be able to go into tools-extisions and get more and get it from there
2006-07-06T10:14:00.000Z	sys8976	combox	I use opera more secure so dont use it, Kibbled_bits yea but the active x ext is a xpi so it should still install
2006-07-06T10:17:00.000Z	sys8976	combox	just a question why are you needing axtive x in linux anyway?
