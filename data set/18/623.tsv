2012-04-15T02:31:00.000Z	compdoc		windows 7 needs a change in group policy to allow it to use a certain type of password security
2012-04-15T02:31:00.000Z	b14d3	compdoc	Found some forum posts online and followed that. Still getting the same thing. A friend of mine even tried his Mac, and it's doing the same thing.
2012-04-15T02:32:00.000Z	b14d3	compdoc	Sorry, unclear sentence. I found some forum posts online ABOUT the change to group policy. And followed those.

2012-04-15T02:36:00.000Z	b14d3	compdoc	Yeah, that's one of the things I did. I can't find the other page that I was using, that reduced the requirements of password security.
2012-04-15T02:49:00.000Z	b14d3	compdoc	: Just let me know when you're back :)

2012-04-15T03:08:00.000Z	b14d3	compdoc	: I figured it out! I had a homegroup set up that messed it all up.
