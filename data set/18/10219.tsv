2007-10-29T23:32:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	you pay that price anyway, the offical update broke my system, had to reinstall
2007-10-29T23:32:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	well, that's why you don't upgrade prod systems until you've tested:-P
2007-10-29T23:33:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	dude, didnt you just say the developers do testing? dont they have extensive periods of beta?
2007-10-29T23:33:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	so whos it on, me or them? because if its both then its neither
2007-10-29T23:34:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	it's all about testing, the dev's test, then you have to test internal, then you slowly bring into production so your prod boxes don't suffer
2007-10-29T23:34:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	dev's can't possibly predict every possible outcome with every possible peice of hardware
2007-10-29T23:35:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	that's why bug reports are open to the community
2007-10-29T23:35:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	all i'm saying is, as an end user i should not be expected to fear hitting ok to an automatic update, now i'd understand if i went and installed something beta, but i didnt. it said "hey, you should upgrade" and i was like "well i'll trust you, since you know more than me", and suffered for it
2007-10-29T23:36:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	updates are always dangerous, but in reality any upgrades can be reversed, and most "broken" systems can be repaired without reinstall
2007-10-29T23:36:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	cop out, if it worked before, it should work again. they commit, they should deliver
2007-10-29T23:37:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	if i were a developer sure, ubuntu dosent have the same system as xp to undo changes
2007-10-29T23:37:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	and if you tried to upgrade to vista from xp, you'd run into the same possible problem
2007-10-29T23:37:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	so i should sit with an outdated system, thats the offical recommendation :P
2007-10-29T23:38:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	if you're afraid to google to fix:-P
2007-10-29T23:38:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	which is equally lame, more so because they make you pay for it, avoiding that sort of crap is why i went to ubuntu in the first place
2007-10-29T23:38:00.000Z	Innomen	leprasmurf	so its on me again, whos in charge here, me or the devs? :P pick a side man
2007-10-29T23:38:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	like right now, my nvidia drivers are all jacked up.  but it's pretty much my fault that it's not working
2007-10-29T23:39:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Innomen	have fun
