2005-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	other than that, search for retail games that come with a linux version, there are only a few but a few good ones
2005-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	alternatively you can look into ... cedega ... it has some support for windows games

2005-05-23T06:47:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	you need to delete all the icons first

2005-05-23T07:58:00.000Z	jeffco	holycow	i did fdisk -l nothing happens
2005-05-23T08:01:00.000Z	jeffco	holycow	what do you make of my results?
2005-05-23T08:02:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	well at least you know what partitions you have and how large they are
2005-05-23T08:03:00.000Z	jeffco	holycow	jamesio, then why do i only have nautilus showing that i have 31.9 gigs of free space (out of a 40G HD)? Does that mean Ubuntu takes up 9Gigs?
2005-05-23T08:03:00.000Z	jeffco	holycow	" subtract from your files system size"? what do you mean?
2005-05-23T08:05:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	it does, your not thinking
2005-05-23T08:10:00.000Z	jeffco	holycow	"jeffco, it does, your not thinking." please tell me what you mean.
2005-05-23T08:15:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	hard drives are never the EXACT number of gigs they are sold, usually less, never more
2005-05-23T08:58:00.000Z	holycow	jeffco	we are considering a switch to ubuntu BECAUSE we know we can always BUY support, meaning that support is available on demand, not support is available whenver someone decides they actually want to answer a question on a forum or irc
