2006-07-24T10:57:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	cat <logfilename>
2006-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	Y are you installing the new video drivers?
2006-07-24T11:05:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	Honestly I have never had problems with the generic linux drivers
2006-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	when you say crashed, does it just reboot, or does it give you an error?
2006-07-24T11:07:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	I don't think that will be a graphicew card issue... Usually that is RAM or processor related
2006-07-24T11:49:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	have you tried quanta or bluefish?
2006-07-24T11:55:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	It's good, rather tasty, but watch out for the bluetooths :)
2006-07-24T11:56:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	???
2006-07-24T11:57:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	hang on 1 sec

2006-07-24T12:01:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	go there and follow directions...
2006-07-24T12:03:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	ok. Open up /etc/apt/sources.list in (insert your text editor's name here)
2006-07-24T12:04:00.000Z	highphilosopher	m3talc0re	then uncomment (remove the #'s) the lines which have a link (http://) and then universe towards the end
