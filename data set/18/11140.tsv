2006-10-21T16:02:00.000Z	silox		My Gizmo Client crashes when I try to make a call, whats whrong? I have the latest version..
2006-10-21T16:02:00.000Z	agent	silox	ask gizmo :)
2006-10-21T16:03:00.000Z	silox	agent	do they have a irc channel?
2006-10-21T16:03:00.000Z	agent	silox	no idea... they do have a forum... does your client work at all? does it crash?
2006-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	agent	silox	the thing is, gizmo is not open source so its not really easy for anyone to help you
2006-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	agent	silox	hence why i suggest gizmo forum... they are the only ones that really know their own client
2006-10-21T16:05:00.000Z	silox	agent	like i said, it crashes when i try to make a call to someone, it makes the ringtone then it hangups...
2006-10-21T16:05:00.000Z	agent	silox	try starting from terminal and see what error it gives... otherwise you really have to ask gizmo people...
2006-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	agent	silox	just so you know... there are open soure sip clients (ubuntu has ekiga - there are also more out there)
2006-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	silox	agent	not with record support :(
2006-10-21T16:13:00.000Z	agent	silox	http://www.twinklephone.com/ - but i don't think you can record using twinkle... maybe some other application
2006-10-21T16:17:00.000Z	agent	silox	maybe use a program like http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ to record the conversation "in real time"... especially since you have 2 sound cards
2006-10-21T16:17:00.000Z	silox	agent	yeah but it complains about "soundcard in use" :/
2006-10-21T16:18:00.000Z	agent	silox	use your second sound card :)
2006-10-21T16:19:00.000Z	silox	agent	then i will only get the sound of one direction :/ not both parts..
2006-10-21T16:20:00.000Z	agent	silox	or if you really want to do this the quick and easy way (but the not so cool way) is plug the cable from your first soundcard output (one you use voip) into your second soundcard record/input and record using audacity or any other program the second sound cards input port
2006-10-21T16:21:00.000Z	agent	silox	im sure you can figure something out... im out of ideas :)
2006-10-21T16:24:00.000Z	agent	silox	also, if you are getting a "sound card already in use" error that probably means that one or more of those programs are NOT using alsa... use alsa and you should not get that error
