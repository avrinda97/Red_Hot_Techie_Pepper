2007-11-20T06:09:00.000Z	Pelo	rasky	 but I don't care of the mp3 plyer itself much, the controls on the fist one I had were much better in my opinon
2007-11-20T06:09:00.000Z	rasky	Pelo	I have to admit the controls on Ipods are pretty good. I refuse to get one though - they're too trendy for someone of my age :)
