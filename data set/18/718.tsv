2011-10-14T19:14:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	what makes you think you have partitions
2011-10-14T19:15:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	and i can boot windows just fine and see the 4 partitions i have via minitool
2011-10-14T19:16:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	how big is this disk?
2011-10-14T19:20:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	fdisk shows all my paritions but ubuntu 11.10 install and gparted do not see them
2011-10-14T19:22:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	that happens sometimes
2011-10-14T19:22:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	what is it you want to do?
2011-10-14T19:23:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	i would like to install ubuntu 11.10 alongside windows, but i have i cant define which partition i want to install to since it doesnt see them
2011-10-14T19:24:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	put a file 'thisOne' on the partition you want to use from Windows
2011-10-14T19:24:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	then when you mount it from the live OS you'll know it's the right one
2011-10-14T19:24:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	the problem is the installed doesnt see any partitions at all! it only see the disk as a whole. id have no problem identifying which partition i want to install to if i could see them
2011-10-14T19:25:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	that's gparted, you said fdisk works
2011-10-14T19:26:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	so i cant define which partition i want to install to
2011-10-14T19:26:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	if you setup a partition from fdisk that might change
2011-10-14T19:27:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	i will try that. heres a screenshot of fdisk and installer: http://i55.tinypic.com/2u5s5fq.png
2011-10-14T19:28:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	interesting
2011-10-14T19:28:00.000Z	reisio	bbbenji	maybe if you use the "alternate" install image, it has an "expert" mode, IIRC
2011-10-14T19:29:00.000Z	bbbenji	reisio	oh great! thats what i need. thanks
