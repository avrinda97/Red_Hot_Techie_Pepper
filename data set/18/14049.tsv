2005-10-02T06:15:00.000Z	sdali		Anyone understand why iptables would show "accept all, anywhere,anywhere" for my input chain? http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2569  Doesn't this mean that I'm basically not running a firewall?
2005-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 Yup!
2005-10-02T06:19:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 According to your paste, it looks like something has indeed manipulated the filtering tables...
2005-10-02T06:23:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 crimsun is correct in his statement.  However, it looks like you do indeed have something installed that is configuring at least a minimal set of packet filtering rules.  I'd check your runlevel dir for any symbolic links to any of the firewall configuration apps you have installed.
2005-10-02T06:23:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	Yep. I think so too. THanks.
2005-10-02T06:26:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	Check my understanding here - who or whatever configured the firewall for me added an entry that says "ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere". This says to me that I'm wide open, but today when a colleague of mine tried to VNC into my ubuntu box, he was not allowed (due to the firewall). Does that accept all anywhere,anywhere open it up to the world or not?
2005-10-02T06:27:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 one sec... let me review your paste again...
2005-10-02T06:27:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	I left out all of the other personally identifiable parts.
2005-10-02T06:29:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 Yes.  It would appear to be the case with the entry that reads, "ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere."
2005-10-02T06:30:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	check this: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2571
2005-10-02T06:30:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 You could try manually flushing all the chains and resetting the default policies back to ACCEPT for all built-in chains.  Then have your friend try VNC again.
2005-10-02T06:30:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	I know that works
2005-10-02T06:31:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	If line 9 of my pastebin says it's open, then why didn't vnc work?
2005-10-02T06:34:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 Seems like it should allow pretty much everything.  Either way, it's pretty clear that it's interfering somehow if flushing it fixes things.  I don't have an answer for you at the moment as to why though.
2005-10-02T06:34:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	Thanks anyway. I'll continue to play and learn.
2005-10-02T06:35:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 And you're sure it's on the INPUT chain?
2005-10-02T07:37:00.000Z	sdali	rob_p	crimsun: Firestarter had configured the firewall for me. Thanks again for the help.
2005-10-02T07:38:00.000Z	rob_p	sdali	 Cool!  Glad you figured it out!
