2010-10-16T13:55:00.000Z	W4RH4WK		got a question too, need to setup a server which mirrors the content of one directory to a secound server in realtime
2010-10-16T13:55:00.000Z	W4RH4WK		my first aproch was, creating a cronjob which starts rsync, and run that every 5 min or so
2010-10-16T13:55:00.000Z	W4RH4WK		any other ideas for realtime mirroring
2010-10-16T13:57:00.000Z	W4RH4WK		i know mirroring is not good, but i my "boss" tells me what to do... i just find a solution :P
2010-10-16T13:58:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	tell your boss to make regular backups and use RAID0+1
2010-10-16T13:59:00.000Z	W4RH4WK	lucent	well i go and have a talk with em on monday
2010-10-16T13:59:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	userspace tools to mirror files is asking for epic fail
2010-10-16T13:59:00.000Z	W4RH4WK	lucent	xD
2010-10-16T14:01:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	even using LVM and snapshot features with userspace tools is going to be a hassle to keep 2 copies at a point in time operational
2010-10-16T14:06:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	"realtime backup" what elephant nuts is that
2010-10-16T14:07:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	if you want a backup of a file that is in a consistent state, use 'duplicity' command available in repos
2010-10-16T14:07:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	getting things into consistent states is not the job of userland
2010-10-16T14:07:00.000Z	W4RH4WK	lucent	maybe i'm using the wrong word for what i want but ill have a look
2010-10-16T14:12:00.000Z	W4RH4WK	lucent	well duplicity looks like a good solution for creating backups, ill show it to my boss... what would your aproach be to keep to different servers mirrored
2010-10-16T14:14:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	I would bill my boss for a pair of Wiebetech Ultradock's, a pelican 1400 case, and 6-7 harddisks and show him / her how to back up their crap
2010-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	W4RH4WK	lucent	kk, got your point
2010-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	W4RH4WK	lucent	thx for the help
2010-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	lucent	W4RH4WK	there's an ideal way to do this, and then there's the way it's going to get done
