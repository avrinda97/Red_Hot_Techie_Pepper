2009-01-24T04:38:00.000Z	smokie		hey guys, how can i make a shell script continue after pressing on any key?
2009-01-24T04:39:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	why would the script be halted?
2009-01-24T04:39:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	for the user to read a msg for example
2009-01-24T04:40:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	and continue after hes done reasing
2009-01-24T04:40:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	ok. does it *have* to be 'any' key, or can it be the c (for continue)
2009-01-24T04:41:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	yeah sure it can ofcourse
2009-01-24T04:41:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	ok, wait a moment, i have an example
2009-01-24T04:43:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	well, at least i thought i had.. haha.. searching now..
2009-01-24T04:44:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	np .. im searching around too while i asked here
2009-01-24T04:44:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	http://paste.ubuntu.com/108795/ have a look
2009-01-24T04:47:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	sure. You'll just have to make the 'continue' part :)
2009-01-24T04:49:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	cool let me give that a try
2009-01-24T05:06:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	yes, if you want to use the special characters, that is
2009-01-24T05:02:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	that worked liek a charm. i have one last question, do i have to use echo " " on every new sentence?
2009-01-24T05:03:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	if you're not using special characters, the " are not really needed. However in the example I used the "\c", that does require the quotes
2009-01-24T05:04:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	how do i do then if want to type like 3 sentences in a row instead of one long one? do i use echo 3 times?
2009-01-24T05:05:00.000Z	oCean_	smokie	the "\n" is for a newline. See "man echo" for other options
2009-01-24T05:05:00.000Z	smokie	oCean_	yeah got it cool
