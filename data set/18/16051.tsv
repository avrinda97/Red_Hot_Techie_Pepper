2005-05-06T12:39:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	What are you trying to do ?
2005-05-06T12:40:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	I have a broken Ubuntu system (the installed grub fails at stage 1.5), so I'm trying to get to the grub command-line by booting from the install CD
2005-05-06T12:40:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	right, boot with 'rescue'
2005-05-06T12:40:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	what does that do?
2005-05-06T12:40:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	boots the install cd into rescue mode
2005-05-06T12:40:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	once its finished loading you can run 'grub-install' to fix your grub install
2005-05-06T12:40:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	that's not documented, is it? I looked for that
2005-05-06T12:41:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	yeh i couldn't see it either, someone told me :)
2005-05-06T12:41:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	grub-install <device> (probably /dev/hda i guess)
2005-05-06T12:41:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	ahahaha. :)
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	it says "could not find kernel image rescue". This is a warty install CD.
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	maybe thats on the live cd?
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	ohhh, warty
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	i think rescue was added in hoary
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	ah. Bugger.
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	you coudl boot the install cd
2005-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	aquarius	then go alt+f2
2005-05-06T12:43:00.000Z	aquarius	Lathiat	hey, that's not a bad idea.
