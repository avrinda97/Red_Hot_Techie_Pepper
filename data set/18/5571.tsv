2008-09-25T19:16:00.000Z	abe3k		Everytime I want to restart ubuntu I have to click on the restart icon twice, first click shuts down all applications and nothing happens, second click restarts ubuntu, is there any solution for this ?
2008-09-25T19:17:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	it sounds like the shutdown is hanging
2008-09-25T19:18:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	what happens when you do "sudo reboot" in the terminal?
2008-09-25T19:21:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	try creating a test user account, and reboot via GUI from there and see if the problem persists
2008-09-25T19:24:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	 I understand... I'm ruling out whether or not is has to do with your user account specifically.
2008-09-25T19:32:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	ok so it's specific to your profile
2008-09-25T19:33:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	how big of a deal would it be to reset your profile?
2008-09-25T19:33:00.000Z	abe3k	churnd	Big
2008-09-25T19:33:00.000Z	abe3k	churnd	: xD
2008-09-25T19:34:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	i'm afraid i don't know where exactly to look
2008-09-25T19:34:00.000Z	abe3k	churnd	yeah me too :/
2008-09-25T19:35:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	you know in your home directory, there's a bunch of hidden folders like .nautilus, .gtk*, .gnome, .gnome2, right?
2008-09-25T19:35:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	 i know the setting is in one of those somewhere
2008-09-25T19:36:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	 for how the restart button behaves
2008-09-25T19:37:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	 basically, the entire look and feel of your desktop environment is contained throughout those folders
2008-09-25T19:38:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	 so my feeling is either a program specific to your session is hanging or there's a messed up setting
2008-09-25T19:40:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	how are you searching?
2008-09-25T19:41:00.000Z	churnd	abe3k	try gconf-editor (run from terminal or "Run Command"
