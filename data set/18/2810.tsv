2010-02-16T06:46:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	hey, any luck with installing OO.o 3.2?
2010-02-16T06:47:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	nope :( tired of trying
2010-02-16T06:48:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	does open office 3.1 work for you?
2010-02-16T06:49:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	it's a lot easier to install
2010-02-16T06:49:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	yes it does. except for the docx files
2010-02-16T06:50:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	hmm -- well, if you're able to wait for Lucid Lynx, it will probably have the never version of OOo
2010-02-16T06:50:00.000Z	Semitones		comes out in April
2010-02-16T06:51:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	yes i guess i would have to, for a number of reasons. the power management daemon on this is also screwed
2010-02-16T06:51:00.000Z	Semitones		did you try asking for help with that already, titan_ark?
2010-02-16T06:52:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	yes i have. it is a bug with certain hp and dell notebooks. a patch is available but people advised me against doing a kernel recompile
2010-02-16T06:52:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	the bug is reported in launchpad
2010-02-16T06:53:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	ugh, I hate when hardware doesn't work!
2010-02-16T06:53:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	else i need to use the vanilla kernel 2.6.32
2010-02-16T06:53:00.000Z	titan_ark		yeah its irritating
2010-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	titan_ark		everytime laptop recovers from sleep i am told there is no battery in, so i cant put it to sleep. always shot down!
2010-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	I've had similar problems with Sleep -- I just shut down every time now
2010-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	Semitones	titan_ark	ubuntu boots so quickly I don't mind
2010-02-16T06:57:00.000Z	titan_ark	Semitones	yeah i do the same :)
