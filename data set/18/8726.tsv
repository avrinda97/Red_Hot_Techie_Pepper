2007-10-02T12:46:00.000Z	julz		the xubuntu site tells me i can install xubuntu through the ubuntu package manager, but i cant find it in there... is the site old or am i missing something?
2007-10-02T12:46:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2007-10-02T12:48:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	sudo
2007-10-02T12:51:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	did you do "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" ?
2007-10-02T12:52:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	mmhhh... weird.
2007-10-02T12:53:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	try "apt-cache search xubuntu-desktop"
2007-10-02T12:54:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	did you see xubuntu-desktop in the list?
2007-10-02T12:55:00.000Z	leo_rockw	julz	you didn't see it in the apt-cache search list? how odd
