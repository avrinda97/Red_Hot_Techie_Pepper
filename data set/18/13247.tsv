2007-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	LadyNikon		Can anyone else help me with my NTFS issue? I already corrected my fstab.. just got to get it to mount properly I get.. mount: special device /dev/disk/by-uuid/0FAFFE6303FAF196 does not exist  when trying mount -a
2007-04-07T16:58:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	does that path exist?  (it's case sensitive too)
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	i have no idea why mount -a is spewing that out. so i doubt it does exist
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	all i did was type mount -a
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	can you pastebin your /etc/fstab?
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	sure lemme find the link again

2007-04-07T05:02:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	cwillu replace the umask with an f and move ro over so there is no space.
2007-04-07T05:03:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	can you now pastebin me what " ls /dev/disk/by-path/ " says?

2007-04-07T05:06:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	my bad, I need /dev/disk/by-uuid, sorry
2007-04-07T05:08:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14316/
2007-04-07T05:10:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	I'm not dead sure, but I'd guess that if you change /etc/fstab ->  UUID=0FAFFE6303FAF196 to  UUID=8E08A5D008A5B81B it'll work, but I'm not dead sure
2007-04-07T05:12:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	eh
2007-04-07T05:13:00.000Z	LadyNikon	cwillu	:S
2007-04-07T05:13:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	?
2008-05-02T01:07:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	it you're sure there's nothing using it, just delete the lock file
2008-05-02T01:07:00.000Z	cwillu	LadyNikon	but be really sure
