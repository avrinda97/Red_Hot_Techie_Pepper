2009-01-09T16:49:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 Hibernate through the shell?  What's the command for hibernate + suspend?
2009-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	there's no command for it. there's applications that do it, and there's a hibernate.sh file somewhere on the HD that does it, but they don't work effectively
2009-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 Ah. I'll try google.  Maybe somebody came up with a solution.
2009-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	try locate hibernate.sh and then bind it to an alias if you like
2009-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	like bind the location to an alias
2009-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	you'll probably have to type ./hibernate.sh from the directory to start it
2009-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	ie, ./directory/hivernate.sh
2009-01-09T16:56:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	ps, let me know if you get it working properly ;)
2009-01-09T16:56:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 I think the command is... sudo /etc/acpi/sleepbtn.sh -- I'll try it soon. :o
2009-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	i'll give it a shot. thanks
2009-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 Still googling through the forums. :<
2009-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 Were you able to hibernate successfully on your machine?  I don't think I ever did for my side.
2009-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 If so, would you try the command?  "sudo pmi action hibernate"
2009-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	i couldn't so i gave up a while back, but there's an application that doe it
2009-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	apparently it's unsafe to hibernate without the application
2009-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Tyrath	 I did came back from hibernate (sorta).  I wasn't able to use my bluetooth keyboard/mouse when resume.
2009-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	Tyrath	jinja-sheep	:/
