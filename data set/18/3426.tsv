2009-10-09T05:02:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	in general, only one service per port. Not only that, but there are conventions on which service use which port. Generally, apache runs on 80, and ssh runs on 22. You can change that, as it's only a convention, but it's a good convention...
2009-10-09T05:05:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	ssl, or ssh? Not the same thing at all...
2009-10-09T05:08:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	too complicated for my tiny brain...
2009-10-09T05:14:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	can't you just install mjpegtools?
2009-10-09T05:17:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	build it and .deb it yourself. I'll step you through it if you want...
2009-10-09T05:17:00.000Z	_Techie_	losha	shall we pm?
2009-10-09T05:20:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	no pm, either we do it in public or we don't do it at all...
2009-10-09T05:22:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	better annoying than bad advice. Also, the rest can sing along and follow the bouncing ball...
2009-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	looks perfect. Now type: make   (and stand well back)
2009-10-09T05:25:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	did it build an mplex executable?
2009-10-09T05:26:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	then you're 90% done. Do you have checkinstall installed?
2009-10-09T05:27:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	ok, sudo apt-get install checkinstall
2009-10-09T05:28:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	ok, sudo checkinstall in the directory where mplex was built...
2009-10-09T05:30:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	usually it installs it automatically too. If not, then sudo gdebi <debfile>
2009-10-09T05:31:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	dpkg -i <debfile>
2009-10-09T05:32:00.000Z	losha	_Techie_	See? only 4 steps, not bad at all...
