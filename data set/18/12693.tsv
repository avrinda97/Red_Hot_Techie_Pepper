2006-03-18T12:56:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	Your best bet is to just ask the questions.
2006-03-18T13:19:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	So you're trying to read MP3 files from an NTFS volume?
2006-03-18T13:19:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	 yes
2006-03-18T13:20:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	lemme check it out
2006-03-18T13:21:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	If it's in /etc/fstab, what's listed in the "<options>" column for that drive?
2006-03-18T13:21:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	 it is not
2006-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	can you type me the unmount command
2006-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	If it's already mounted, just do "umount /c"
2006-03-18T13:24:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	Yup, sorry.
2006-03-18T13:25:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	Did that new mount command work?
2006-03-18T13:27:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	a new problem ,the player doesen`t open `em
2006-03-18T13:27:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	Do you have MP3 support installed?
2006-03-18T13:31:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	I can`t get it, the archive wasn`t found
2006-03-18T13:33:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	Did you add the proper repositories?
2006-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	Andr31	silvaran	repositories meaning? :) I am a n00b
2006-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	silvaran	Andr31	The MP3 page should tell you about using Synaptic to add repositories (package sources, like "universe" and "multiverse" and stuff like that)...
