2010-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	elita		hiya all, Ijust installed ubuntu-netbook-extensions into my normal 9.10 setup and I don't like the way GNOME now comes up, but I can't seem to revert to the normal/standard X setup :(
2010-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	what part of it don't you like?
2010-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	also have you tried just uninstalling them again?
2010-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	the whole single-window / left-hand-application-selector thing
2010-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	yes, I did try apt-get remove but it stayed the same.
2010-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	also tried rebooting/relogging?
2010-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	elita		this is on an Acer Aspire one pro (1024x600 display)
2010-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	several times.
2010-01-26T13:11:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	even tries remaking the user account
2010-01-26T13:16:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	well isn't it just a special launcher on the desktop, and windows being maximalised?
2010-01-26T13:16:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	I think so, though the desktop also lacks the normal main menu
2010-01-26T13:16:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	so, even if I kill the launcher in the startup, when it gets in I can't then launch anything
2010-01-26T13:17:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	dont you normally have main menu on the gnome panel? or can't you normally add it?
2010-01-26T13:17:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	and the maximalising is done by "maximus" process
2010-01-26T13:17:00.000Z	elita	Tartaros	normally I would expect it to be available, though for some reason it's not there.   Any ideas how to add it?
2010-01-26T13:18:00.000Z	elita		(the gnome main menu to the top taskbar)
2010-01-26T13:18:00.000Z	elita		well, my husband just told me dinner is on the table, so I better move along, thanks for your help thus far Tartaros .
2010-01-26T13:18:00.000Z	Tartaros	elita	:) ok
