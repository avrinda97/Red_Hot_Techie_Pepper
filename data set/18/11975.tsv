2006-06-03T16:54:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna		what are the most common reasons for the LiveCD install not booting?
2006-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna		yes, it gets to setting up some of the system services (e.g. gnome panel configuration, or uncompressing Linux kenrel)
2006-06-03T16:56:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna		ok, thanks anyways...
2006-06-03T05:09:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna		my install CD is getting to a different point in the boot process each time, then hangs for a while, then reboots and starts again
2006-06-03T05:10:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna		My install CD is getting to a random point in the boot process, and then rebooting itself
2006-06-03T05:11:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna		can any one offer any help please?
2006-06-03T05:12:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	Your CD checks out error free?
2006-06-03T05:14:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	YYu're saying you can't even boot as a live CD user?
2006-06-03T05:18:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna	hillside	nope, it doesn't even get to the gdm
2006-06-03T05:19:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	Hmmm, OK, someone else here should take htis. Sorry, restate your question. :/
2006-06-03T05:20:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna	hillside	ok
2006-06-03T05:20:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna	hillside	thanks
2006-06-03T05:24:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	When you try to boot, there is a check the CD selection, does it confirm the CD is OK?
2006-06-03T05:25:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	Do other live CDs work like KNOPPIX or DSL?
2006-06-03T05:27:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	you have enough RAM? <shurg>
2006-06-03T05:27:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna	hillside	1Gb
2006-06-03T05:28:00.000Z	Tinned_Tuna	hillside	2x 256Mb + 1x 512Mb
2006-06-03T05:29:00.000Z	hillside	Tinned_Tuna	Try a small distro like dsl, slax, puppy? Does any other work, KNOPPIX??
