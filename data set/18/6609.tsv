2008-04-25T03:46:00.000Z	Saladin		Hey guys, I am wanting to revert back to Firefox 2.0.014 after doing the Hardy Heron upgrade. Any help, as I am unable to do so
2008-04-25T03:47:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	there's a package for firefox 2. check synaptic
2008-04-25T04:07:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	still having trouble with extensions? did you try that extension i mentioned?
2008-04-25T04:08:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	no you didn't
2008-04-25T04:08:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	was a while ago. you acknowledged it
2008-04-25T04:08:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	nightly tester tools extension
2008-04-25T04:08:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	makes firefox think your extensions are compatible. but i recommend enabling them one at a time
2008-04-25T04:09:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	'cause some will work, and some won't, and some may prevent it from running
2008-04-25T04:09:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	if you end up enabling a bad one that prevents it from running, then run an older firefox to fix it
2008-04-25T04:10:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	(ie., disable that extension)
2008-04-25T04:10:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	the nightly tester tools? of course ;)
2008-04-25T04:12:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	a 'nightly' is a cutting edge build, released every day. it's an extension designed to enable extensions for testing on versions of firefox they aren't designed for
2008-04-25T04:17:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	i had a weird issue like that the first time i tried to use the nightly exension. try restarting it, and make sure you select an extension, then right click and 'make compatible'
2008-04-25T04:17:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	um, i thought you were trying to enable FF2 extensions for FF3?
2008-04-25T04:21:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	nightly tester tools alters the extensions compatibility. ff2 thinks they don't work anymore. you'll prolly have to reinstall them if you want to go back..
2008-04-25T04:21:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	you shouldn't lose settings though\
2008-04-25T04:22:00.000Z	Saladin	tanath	however... Nightly isn't showing up on the extensions list.
2008-04-25T04:22:00.000Z	tanath	Saladin	huh... well i've never downgraded like that, so...
