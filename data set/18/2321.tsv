2012-09-15T11:47:00.000Z	msmith0957		Anyone know anything about alsa audio drivers ? Need help debugging my no-audio issue :/ http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=093cfd18ead70526bc477a48d6aad53f84a74d99
2012-09-15T11:49:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	I'll need more than "no sound" to help you :)
2012-09-15T11:50:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	aplay -l lists my sound card, alsamixer also allows me to mess with levels, but the actual vol control only shows the 'dummy output' hardware playback device, not my REAL card
2012-09-15T11:51:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	someone had a similar issue here, with very similar hardware: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+question/190509 but their solution did not appear to help me
2012-09-15T11:52:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	I'm guessing you're using regular ubuntu 12.04? then it's probably PulseAudio's fault...
2012-09-15T12:04:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	it's a hidden file in /home/$USER
2012-09-15T12:05:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	create one?
2012-09-15T12:26:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	buhman: i'm not exactly sure what belongs in this new asound.conf file i had to create.
2012-09-15T12:29:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	here's mine, I have dual soundcards thou and is set the card #2... : http://codepad.org/GXGUmC08
2012-09-15T12:29:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	also, it's .asoundrc, not .asound.conf :)
2012-09-15T12:31:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	its not ~/.asoundrc/asound.conf ?
2012-09-15T12:34:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	hmm. Neither .asoundrc or /etc/asound.conf is normally required. You should be able to play and record sound without either (assuming your mic and speakers are hooked up properly). If your system won't work without one, and you are running the most current version of ALSA, you probably should file a bug report. lol, should i file a bug report ??
2012-09-15T12:45:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	so my .asoundrc file simply reads "pcm.card0 { type hw  card 0 }" . also, only reason why i was mentioning asound.conf earlier is because buhman mentioned earlier the change i would be required to make would be in there. After adding those few lines above, is there anything i have to restart?
2012-09-15T12:46:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	buhman was refering to 2 separate files, not a file in a directory :) and no, nothing has to be restarted :)
2012-09-15T12:47:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	so, there is an 'asound.conf' i have to create/modify somewhere ? Still no audio :/
2012-09-15T12:50:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	what's next? i'm not sure what i should be trying here
2012-09-15T13:22:00.000Z	bkc_	msmith0957	found your problem... it's a Dell ^^
2012-09-15T13:22:00.000Z	msmith0957	bkc_	NO! this was before it was dell ;)
