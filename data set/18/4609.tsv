2009-09-19T01:47:00.000Z	jophish		I have used rsync to copy a large amount of music from one server to another. however it has left out all the tracks with apostrophes in. what cp flags should I use just to fill in the blanks, i.e not overwrite files that are already present at the destination
2009-09-19T01:48:00.000Z	losher	jophish	what rsync command did you use originally?
2009-09-19T01:53:00.000Z	jophish	losher	sudo rsync -av /mnt/slimserver/music /data --progress
2009-09-19T01:55:00.000Z	losher	jophish	that command looks good, and should work even with files that contain apostrophes. Have you tried running it again? rsync won't copy the same files twice if they are identical. Were there any error/warning messages?
2009-09-19T02:02:00.000Z	losher	jophish	so if you do e.g. ls -l "/mnt/slimserver/music/CDs/Bukka White/The Complete Sessions

2009-09-19T02:08:00.000Z	losher	jophish	well, everything looks pretty much like I expected it to. I can't really see why rsync would complain that certain files have 'vanished'. Can you run the rsync command again and paste some of the error messages so I can see the *exact* text when it goes wrong...
2009-09-19T02:10:00.000Z	losher	jophish	I don't quite know what I'm looking for, but what you report shouldn't happen during normal usage, which is why I want to see an example of the exact message. Sometimes the devil is in the details...

2009-09-19T02:21:00.000Z	losher	jophish	I'm stumped. Is there something you haven't told me e.g. something special about the source filesystem perhaps?
2009-09-19T02:23:00.000Z	losher	jophish	so the source is nfs mounted? Any error messages from nfs in dmesg? Any error messages on the nfs server maybe?
2009-09-19T02:24:00.000Z	losher	jophish	same question though, I guess. What happens if you try and cp a single 'troublesome' file by hand?
2009-09-19T02:27:00.000Z	jophish	losher	I am unable to type the filename
2009-09-19T02:28:00.000Z	losher	jophish	not sure what you mean. You mean it doesn't autocomplete?
2009-09-19T02:31:00.000Z	losher	jophish	well, it's just a guess at this stage, but I think your problem is actually on the smb server. Can you copy a whole directory using cp -r ? (No need for asterisks or wild card characters)
2009-09-19T02:32:00.000Z	losher	jophish	so you can successfully copy a filename containing an asterisk if you do it via nautilus?
2009-09-19T02:34:00.000Z	jophish	losher	yes no problem
2009-09-19T02:35:00.000Z	losher	jophish	sorry, I'm out of ideas. I've never seen this failure mode before. At least you have a workaround :-)
