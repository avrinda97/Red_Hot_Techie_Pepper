2008-01-21T04:56:00.000Z	Jangari		will gparted allow me to partition off some hard drive space while it's in use?
2008-01-21T04:56:00.000Z	Jangari		or should i use a liveCD?
2008-01-21T04:56:00.000Z	Jangari		ha
2008-01-21T04:57:00.000Z	Jangari		i take it i shouldn't then, bkar, lest i lose everything?
2008-01-21T04:57:00.000Z	Jangari		i suppose it's a recent installation anyway
2008-01-21T04:58:00.000Z	Jangari		but i need to install windows on my work machine, but i want to keep linux, obviously,
2008-01-21T04:59:00.000Z	Jangari		so i need to run a dual boot, meaning I'll have to partition off some space, and I'll doubtlessly have to restore the grub loader, as windows' mbr will overwrite it
2008-01-21T05:00:00.000Z	Jangari		wasn't it a silly design flaw to make cd/dvd drive bays with the open/close button *underneath* the tray?
