2006-09-24T12:54:00.000Z	rubikfreak		Somehow I was updating my machine and I did "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade", and aptitude deleted a ton of my packages, including xserver-xorg. How do I reinstall all the default packages?
2006-09-24T12:54:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-09-24T12:56:00.000Z	rubikfreak	stefg	will that preserve my files? e.g. /home
2006-09-24T12:56:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	of course. it's just a metapackage which will have all the default packasges as dependencies
2006-09-24T12:58:00.000Z	rubikfreak	stefg	it says that ubuntu-desktop is already the latest version
2006-09-24T12:58:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	huh... then try sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
2006-09-24T13:00:00.000Z	rubikfreak	stefg	it replaces the metapackage but no actual pacages that were lost get installed
2006-09-24T13:02:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	hmm.. then i'd sudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-desktop, and then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop again
2006-09-24T13:03:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	you apt-database seems corrupted
2006-09-24T13:04:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	do you have X right now, or are you on console?
2006-09-24T13:06:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	hmm to get X again I'd try sudo apt-get install gnome-panel nautilus first, hopefully this will restore a usable gui first
2006-09-24T13:07:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	good idea
2006-09-24T13:08:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	last thing you did was apt-get update and dist-upgrading?
2006-09-24T13:08:00.000Z	rubikfreak	stefg	how do i restart x
2006-09-24T13:08:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-09-24T13:10:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm ?
2006-09-24T13:11:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	i tend to suggest that... that looks really screwed
2006-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	stefg	rubikfreak	you don't need to resize no more, it's done already. go to manual partitioning
