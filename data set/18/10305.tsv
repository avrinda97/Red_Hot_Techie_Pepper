2006-12-19T12:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	cant you just type the mount of the partition in the adress bar?
2006-12-19T12:43:00.000Z	monika__	nolimitsoya	i can, but it doesn't work in amarok
2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	monika__	nolimitsoya	i want to add music to collection and i can't
2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	i dont use kde so i dont know if i can give any great tips on it, but cant you make a bookmank like in thunar?
2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	monika__	nolimitsoya	want to see screen shot?
2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	thank you, but i dont think theyll help in this matter :)
2006-12-19T12:45:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	i suggest you either make bookmarks in konqi, or links i your home
2006-12-19T12:45:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	or run it by LjL, i think he/shes a kde user :)
2006-12-19T12:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	ubotu is a bot that LjLkindly called to aid :)
2006-12-19T12:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	not at all :) happens all the time
2006-12-19T12:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	if you want to see all the dirs, i guess it would
2006-12-19T12:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	glad for you :)
2006-12-19T12:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	the kde people probably thought it confused newcomers. most users should move outside ~ anyway
2006-12-19T12:53:00.000Z	monika__	nolimitsoya	well, i have few partitions, other distributions etc.
2006-12-19T12:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	then you dont count as the average user id guess ;)
2006-12-19T12:54:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	monika__	agreed :)
