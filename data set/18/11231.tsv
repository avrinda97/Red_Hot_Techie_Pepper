2006-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	Websteria		:-)
2006-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	Websteria		I think the thing that made me fall in love with ubuntu and linux in general were two things: mt-dappd and hellanzb
2006-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	Websteria		and nomachine
2006-10-13T14:27:00.000Z	Websteria		At least when things break in Linux there are decent error messages as opposed to Windows
2006-10-13T14:27:00.000Z	Websteria		hahahahah
2006-10-13T14:27:00.000Z	Websteria		just when things do have problems cause I screwed something up
2006-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	Websteria		No, I meant /Var/log was MUCH better than the hex
2006-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	Websteria		One thing that does bug me. When I start Konsole in Gnome it seems to take about a second to load. Under debian it seemed to load faster. Is something possibly misconfigured?
2006-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	Websteria		Or is there a gnome terminal prog I should be using
2006-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	a whole SECOND??? Oh dear! and aterm's faster
2006-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	gnome-terminal's popular, but it messes with keybindings a lot.
2006-10-13T14:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	it may have something to do with needing to load QT libraries in gnome or something
2006-10-13T14:31:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	*shrug* sorry
2006-10-13T14:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	if you're booted to it, it'll be used...
2006-10-13T14:34:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	it's because you've got its meta-package involved...i think it's linux-386 or something
2006-10-13T14:35:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	what's the output of uname -r?
2006-10-13T14:35:00.000Z	ladydoor	Websteria	and yeah, aterm is gret
