2007-07-28T12:34:00.000Z	file13		im pretty sure i have a gig
2007-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	file13		you use 8 gigs for a swap partition?!
2007-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	file13		my laptop only has a 60gb HDD, i couldnt swing that
2007-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	file13		why are the benefits of the larger swap partiton, im not even sure what it does
2007-07-28T12:36:00.000Z	file13		well i either have 512-1GB not sure, i dont see any my computer-esk properties option to check
2007-07-28T12:36:00.000Z	file13		1gb of ram
2007-07-28T12:36:00.000Z	file13		but only a 60gb HDD
2007-07-28T12:37:00.000Z	file13		well i could go for 1gb i suppose? if it would help things along a bit.
2007-07-28T12:39:00.000Z	file13		ok cuz im having to reinstall ubuntu and im gonna remake the swap and ext3 parition, i dunno if i have to delete the swap but i think itll be easier if i just delete evertying that isnt the 10gb XP partiton and start fresh on the ubuntu install
2007-07-28T12:41:00.000Z	file13		And one quick question before i re-install. Is anyone a wireless guru that could answer something
2007-07-28T12:42:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	sorta a wireless guru i guess
2007-07-28T12:42:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	know nothing about wpa but i can give you a link to that
2007-07-28T12:43:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	you mean it had you remove network manager?
2007-07-28T12:43:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	i dont know, that makes no sense to me.
2007-07-28T12:43:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	maybe because it causes a race with ifconfig.  if not, you should be able to use it just fine afterwards (?)  why not post in the thread and ask?
2007-07-28T12:47:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	well "iwlist scan" can scan
2007-07-28T12:47:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	it just removed the pretty flashy GUI
2007-07-28T12:47:00.000Z	xtknight	file13	and "iwconfig" can set options
