2008-01-21T19:40:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	you could  pipe the log to another place of your choice in "real time" , tail -f /path/to/log >> ~/cached-log.now
2008-01-21T19:40:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	you should an output of what happens
2008-01-21T19:41:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	are you suspending / resuming when the freezes happen ?
2008-01-21T19:41:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	no, it happens completely randomly
2008-01-21T19:43:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	no, only drivers I have that aren't from the repos are the nvidia ones, 169.07 the most current
2008-01-21T19:43:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	they could well lockup xorg ?
2008-01-21T19:44:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	you should use the repo if you need stability, and have a testing dual-boot maybe
2008-01-21T19:45:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	I CANNOT use the ones from the repo for nvidia, they're old shit that doesn't work for my setup
2008-01-21T19:45:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	wouldn't I see something like Xorg takng an insane amount of CPU/memory before it happens?
2008-01-21T19:46:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	might might not depends
2008-01-21T19:46:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	I know they don't, I tried them and they didn't work... only 1 monitor worked(partially), two were black and the 4th looked like a bad christmas lighting
2008-01-21T19:47:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	what card ?
2008-01-21T19:47:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	two cards, GeForce 6200 and Quadro NVS 280
2008-01-21T19:49:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	I have used 2xcards for 4 monitors (6200+7300gt) myself with older drivers , and currently have a dual setup working fine of the repo 7300gt
2008-01-21T19:50:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	as I said earlier, it didn't work for me, it would only see one monitor and one other showing random colors.  Manually instaling the drivers from Nvidia was the only thing that worked
2008-01-21T19:51:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	doubt that was the problem ? hand talored xorg.conf ?
2008-01-21T19:51:00.000Z	Joe_	dax_roc	no, I used nvidia-settings to do it
2008-01-21T19:52:00.000Z	dax_roc	Joe_	it should work fine with a hand tailored xorg.conf on the repo drivers, sorry I cant be of more help
