2006-08-07T08:37:00.000Z	bipolar		Is anyone using the compiz packages from compiz.net on dapper?
2006-08-07T08:37:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	i'm using a non-standard repo, but don't know if it is pulled from there
2006-08-07T08:38:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	I'm having trouble getting compiz to use the settings in gconf. For instance the number of viewports. are you having any trouble like that?
2006-08-07T08:39:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	no, but iirc there was something i had to do to update gconf a while back
2006-08-07T08:39:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	unfortunately, i'm not using gui just now so can't check
2006-08-07T08:40:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	ok. if you get a chance, please let me know.
2006-08-07T08:40:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	i'll see what i can find out. In the meantime, you could try the repo i'm using??
2006-08-07T08:40:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	what repo is that?
2006-08-07T08:42:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	deb http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz dapper main
2006-08-07T08:42:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	ok. thats the mirror for the compiz.net packages. same ones I have. :)
2006-08-07T08:43:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	:) - There certainly was something i had to do (maybe it was to install a "gconf" module in compiz??)
2006-08-07T08:43:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	let me check....
2006-08-07T08:44:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	wow... that might be it. It's installed, but not loaded.
2006-08-07T08:45:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	give it a try
2006-08-07T08:45:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	indeed. that was it. thanks! :D
2006-08-07T08:45:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	excellent :)
2006-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	bipolar	mcphail	very excellent. I was missing a lot of functionality.
2006-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	mcphail	bipolar	now you'll have to put up with your keybindings being messed up by the developers every couple of days when they release a new version....
