2006-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	kanid		well, lets try this again:
2006-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	kanid		I have a Logitech MX1000 wireless mouse which has a usb receiver. When I boot my Toshiba Satellite up with the mouse plugged in, everything works just dandy. Exactly like things should be.
2006-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	kanid		The problem comes when I plug the mouse in after the system has booted. Once I plug the mouse in I get the following kernel message repeated way too many times:
2006-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	kanid		[4348319.623000]  hub 1-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 1. Maybe the USB cable is bad?
2006-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	kanid		Now, I know the cable isn't bad because the mouse works in ubuntu if plugged in before booting, and it works in gentoo and windows on the same computer. It also works in slackware on a different computer.
2006-03-23T14:25:00.000Z	kanid		anyone have any ideas?
2006-03-23T14:26:00.000Z	RQ	kanid	maybe it's a bug
2006-03-23T14:26:00.000Z	kanid	RQ	I filed one here: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/hotplug/+bug/35492
2006-03-23T14:27:00.000Z	RQ	kanid	great
2006-03-23T14:27:00.000Z	kanid	RQ	but I'm not sure how to narrow it down to a specific place
2006-03-23T14:28:00.000Z	kanid		!paste
2006-03-23T14:28:00.000Z	RQ		omg
2006-03-23T14:28:00.000Z	RQ	kanid	devs will help you to narrow it down
2006-03-23T14:28:00.000Z	kanid	RQ	I hope so.
2006-03-23T14:29:00.000Z	kanid	RQ	do the devs not generally hang out in IRC or the forums?
2006-03-23T14:29:00.000Z	RQ	kanid	dunno, i'm not a dev
2006-03-23T14:29:00.000Z	RQ		;)
2006-03-23T14:29:00.000Z	kanid	RQ	because I've gotten all of zero response to my questions in the forums, and very few in IRC
