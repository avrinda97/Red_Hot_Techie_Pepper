2008-10-06T23:06:00.000Z	Daremonai		I am getting: "Duplicate or bad block in use!" while it's fscking my main disk (the one that has ubuntu / /home etc.) can this be fixed?
2008-10-06T23:06:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	it might be either a software or hardware problem (failing drive). does it drop you to a console?
2008-10-06T23:07:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	I am booting with a fsck, after this happens.. it goes on saying some stuff about inodes, then reboots the pc automatically.
2008-10-06T23:07:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	right, that's what it's supposed to do, but after it reboots, does it do it again?
2008-10-06T23:08:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	it's rebooted around 6-7 times so far. at one point it told me to put root password or click Ctrl+D and I did Ctrl+D
2008-10-06T23:09:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	you do need to put in a password (shouldn't really be the root password, but your own password) and run fsck manually. or you could (perhaps easier) boot from a live cd.
2008-10-06T23:09:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	in any case, you'll need to make sure there isn't a hardware failure on the drive. i suppose you're on another computer right now?
2008-10-06T23:09:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	I don't have a CD-Drive on the machine..
2008-10-06T23:10:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	correct.. on my laptop. how can i check for hardware failures? thing is Ubuntu was working, but it was freezing a lot, which is why i made it run the fsck on reboot, and rebooted.
2008-10-06T23:11:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	one thing at a time - we need to get fsck to fix the errors, first
2008-10-06T23:11:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	reboot and put your password
2008-10-06T23:12:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	At one point I was copying some files from the hard disk in question and another one which turned out to be a faulty disc and when it froze.. my pc somehow crashed, and i had to run fsck, and it asked me a bunch of times "do you want to fix(y)" some inode stuff.. i told it 'y', and then stuff started happening with the crashing, etc. I guess...
2008-10-06T23:13:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	when it reboots, should I just turn it off and on again? how can i stop the constant fscks?
2008-10-06T23:14:00.000Z	LjL	Daremonai	i told you - you should *put* the root password when it asks you, *not* hit ctrl+d, and then run fsck manually
2008-10-06T23:14:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	fsck died with exit 3
2008-10-06T23:14:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	yeah, but it's not asking me this anymore
2008-10-06T23:26:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	any suggestions on how to run it again without having to fsck?
2008-10-07T00:45:00.000Z	Daremonai	LjL	& soundray, thank you for your help.
