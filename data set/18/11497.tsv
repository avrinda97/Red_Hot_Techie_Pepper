2006-11-02T11:29:00.000Z	guillem101		OK, found, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash"
2006-11-02T11:29:00.000Z	guillem101		and disable dash as the default sh
2006-11-02T11:30:00.000Z	guillem101		This dash thing has been causing some trouble in several places until I have realized... :,-(
2006-11-02T11:32:00.000Z	OoberMick	guillem101	if it is from ubuntu packages you should report bugs against them for using bash-ism in a /bin/sh script
2006-11-02T11:33:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	I'm not sure they are bugs... or "features" from bash I was somewhat relying on
2006-11-02T11:33:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	I only know that I *need* bash
2006-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	OoberMick	guillem101	if you are writing scripts that need bash then you should use #!/bin/bash not #!/bin/sh
2006-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	I've had two problems: one is the PATH environment variable not correctly set when launching sh scripts and the other a very specific detail using a C and popen
2006-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	sure, but popen() uses sh and you cannot say it to use bash
2006-11-02T11:36:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	so I can see my script should have been #!/bin/bash, so I'm perhaps wrong complaining about dash... but for the popen() thing ... I don't really know if what I expect be OK at all, but it works with bash
2006-11-02T11:37:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	for these reasons I don't want to fill a bug... but I'm not happy with dash either :-P
2006-11-02T11:38:00.000Z	OoberMick	guillem101	I'm not sure what you are trying to do but it sounds like you are happy with your fix. Just realise that you might use a system where /bin/sh isn't bash in the future and it might break again
2006-11-02T11:38:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	you are right
2006-11-02T11:38:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	unless dash is broken, of course :-P
2006-11-02T11:39:00.000Z	OoberMick	guillem101	and if it is you should report a bug :D
2006-11-02T11:41:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	If checked that the problem with my script was my fault, since I had the PATH defined at .bashrc but not at .profile (where I guess sh may check by default) so this is one point for dash :-P
2006-11-02T11:42:00.000Z	guillem101	OoberMick	but the problem is that I'm completely unsure about the popen thing. I may write a bug file to see if it gets honored or discarded
2006-11-02T11:43:00.000Z	OoberMick	guillem101	I wouldn't know about the popen thing. Can you copy the line from the C code here and see if anyone cares to comment
