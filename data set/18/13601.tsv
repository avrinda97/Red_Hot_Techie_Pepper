2010-08-12T09:41:00.000Z	control_		ok so i install it through ubuntu software center and then do ???
2010-08-12T09:41:00.000Z	control_		omg, so vsftp OR this ebox thing?
2010-08-12T09:42:00.000Z	control_		config tool for a ftp server?
2010-08-12T09:42:00.000Z	control_		no i asked what is the easiest ftp server to setup in ubuntu server
2010-08-12T09:43:00.000Z	control_		because someone said it when i asked for a ftp
2010-08-12T09:43:00.000Z	control_		omg
2010-08-12T09:43:00.000Z	control_		5 different people said 5 diff things
2010-08-12T09:44:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	then i will second vsftp install it then edit /etc/vsftpd.conf and read the comments to enable what you need
2010-08-12T09:45:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	yes, especially note the options about anonymous access and LOcal User access
2010-08-12T09:49:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	sudo gedit /etc/vsftpd.conf and the ssh server is working out of the box but you can configure it. again they suggested this ebox for easy config, but i have no knowledge of it
2010-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	if you enabled local users in the config and restarted the server !  then you should already be able to ftp as yourself, it's a nice test to check it's working
2010-08-12T09:58:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	setup a user for where you want access too. ie add a user called mydata or another username and then use maco's other command to change where you log into
2010-08-12T10:01:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	sudo usermod -d /media/externaldrive  username     (for the user you jsut created, not your user)
2010-08-12T10:23:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	http://www.linuxreaders.com/2010/07/14/virtual-users-on-vsftpd-centos/  this is a little more up to date but centos
2010-08-12T10:25:00.000Z	bofh80	control_	you could also try proftp or pureftp. also supposedly with virtual user support
