2007-02-09T07:38:00.000Z	Polygon89		hello, i am wondering why the update manager wont let me update three packages, linux header, image and restricted modules. they are greyed out in the update manager
2007-02-09T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	 it's on the repo side,  leave it alone they will update when they get fixed or what ever
2007-04-21T09:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	    menu > edit > apply
2007-04-21T09:53:00.000Z	Polygon89	Pelo	apply is greyed out after i tell it to create the disklabel
2007-04-21T09:53:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	  then you proceed and add the new partitons
2007-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	Polygon89	Pelo	that is the problem. When i try to right click > new, it says i need to create the disk label again. even though i just told it to create it.
2007-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	  leave gparted, go back in , try again
2007-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	  this is a usb hdd ?
2007-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	 got a cd with the harware,  see if you have a recovery prog on it
2007-04-21T09:59:00.000Z	Polygon89	Pelo	are you saying that i should see if i have a recovery cd that came with my usb hdd?
2007-04-21T09:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	  more or less,   recovery format  maintenence,  stuff in general
2007-04-21T10:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	  basicaly if this were 10 years ago with an internal hdd I would tell you to low format it , but that 's not an option anymore so I don't know what to tell you
2007-04-21T10:02:00.000Z	Polygon89	Pelo	i am going to see if my dads mac can format this drive for fat32, see if it that can re-create the disk label.
2007-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	 best of luck
2007-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	 sorry i don't
2007-10-11T06:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	 open a blank instance of mplayer, then go to the preferences ,  and make sure the audio device is  alsa
2007-10-11T06:09:00.000Z	Polygon89	Pelo	it is... but isnt the mplayer gui just a frontend to mplayer (cli)....so why is the cli working but not the gui
2007-10-11T06:09:00.000Z	Pelo	Polygon89	 don'T know , you can probably ask in #mplayer they should know
