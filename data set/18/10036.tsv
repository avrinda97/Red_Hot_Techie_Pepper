2007-02-03T17:38:00.000Z	Beverage		hey guys i made a small script and chmod'd it i dont know how to run it anyone know?
2007-02-03T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	what kind of script?
2007-02-03T17:40:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	its a script so that my limewire will run
2007-02-03T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	well as long as you have the first line as  #!/bin/sh  or something similar, you can do what soundray said
2007-02-03T17:43:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	it looks liek this "#!/bin/bash
2007-02-03T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	that looks fine
2007-02-03T17:44:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	so just put that into /usr/bin/ and itll run?
2007-02-03T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	/usr/local/bin/  is better.  You should use /usr/local for stuff you do, and leave the rest of the stuff to the package manager
2007-02-03T17:45:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	okay thanks
2007-02-03T17:49:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	i tried setitng my local/bin so i have the permission but "sudo chown -R jon:jon /usr/local/bin/" doesnt work...says "sudo: must be setuid root" any suggestions?
2007-02-03T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	what command did you use to change the permissions?
2007-02-03T06:15:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	i used sudo chown -R jon:jon /usr/bin/
2007-02-03T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	everything in my /usr/bin is root owned except "at" which is daemon:daemon and lppasswd which is cupsys:lpadmin
2007-02-03T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	I spoke to you earlier, and specifically said /usr/local/bin...
2007-02-03T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	note that "at" and "lppasswd" are not owned by root
2007-02-03T06:23:00.000Z	Beverage	jrib	so i shud chown -R jon:jon /usr/bin/at ? and the same for lppasswd?
2007-02-03T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	Beverage	everything in my /usr/bin is root owned except "at" which is daemon:daemon and "lppasswd" which is cupsys:lpadmin
