2008-06-24T12:17:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	so i install scponly then create a new user and set his shell to scponly and that will restrict them to scp/sftp access only?
2008-06-24T12:18:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	i forgot. if think man scponly will tell you how to use it.
2008-06-24T12:25:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	i followed the instructions in man scponly and changed a user's shell to /usr/bin/scponly but when i try to login via sftp i get permission denied
2008-06-24T12:26:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	how do you "log in via sftp"?
2008-06-24T12:26:00.000Z	__machine		transmit
2008-06-24T12:26:00.000Z	__machine		(sftp app on mac)
2008-06-24T12:27:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	make sure you set it to SCP mode and not SFTP mode
2008-06-24T12:27:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	hmm it only has SFTP mode (not sftp)...
2008-06-24T12:28:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	the man page says it should work with sftp tho?
2008-06-24T12:28:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	appears like Transmit is crap. oh well, try rssh instead.
2008-06-24T12:29:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	i can login to the same server with a regular user over sftp with transmit
2008-06-24T12:29:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	doesn't help, does it
2008-06-24T12:38:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	i tried from another linux box with sftp command line and still got Permission denied (publickey). ... if i have any public key on a machine can i not login with ssh to another machine with a regular username/password?
2008-06-24T12:38:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	depends on your sshd config i guess
2008-06-24T12:44:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	i tried it with another machine which has no pub key and still get permission denied publickey error... wtf... hmm
2008-06-24T12:44:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	the public key is stored on the server
2008-06-24T12:58:00.000Z	__machine	magnetron	i think i found the sshd_config option that was causing probs... i changed that... how do i restart sshd so it reloads the new config file?
2008-06-24T12:58:00.000Z	magnetron	__machine	"sudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart" , IIRF
