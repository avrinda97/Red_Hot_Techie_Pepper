2005-09-06T15:48:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		that city never should have been built in the first place
2005-09-06T14:00:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		you know, whoever's brainchild it was to not let regged nicks join this, it really screws things up big time for people who auto-join this channel and auto-register
2005-09-06T14:00:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		not let unregged I mean
2005-09-06T14:02:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	what client do you use?
2005-09-06T14:04:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	you may be able to script it (or set) so it doesnt join the channels right away (allowing nickserv to be happily interacted with)
2005-09-06T14:04:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Nalioth	how?
2005-09-06T14:04:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	not sure, i'd ask in #xchat
2005-09-06T14:06:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	yes, if you dont ahve your xchat primed to autojoin, just connect to freenode and surf a couple of webpages
2005-09-06T14:06:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	atm, the channel is bot-unfriendly (they are living in #ubuntu-unregged by the hordes)
2005-09-06T14:07:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	then come back and join your channels
2005-09-06T14:07:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Nalioth	no thanks
2005-09-06T14:08:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	if the ops opened the channel up, there'd be thousands of bots in here
2005-09-06T14:08:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Nalioth	didnt seem to have this problem a week ago
2005-09-06T14:08:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	the bots weren't attacking a week ago
2005-09-06T14:09:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Nalioth	thats super weak - what kind of asshole makes loads of bots to attack a linux channel
2005-09-06T14:10:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	they're not attacking this channel. they're attacking the whole freenode network
2005-09-07T13:31:00.000Z	Nalioth	ColonelKernel	ext2fs makes it possible
2005-09-07T13:31:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Nalioth	that use to be read only
