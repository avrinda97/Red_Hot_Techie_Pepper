2009-07-19T04:35:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/221490/
2009-07-19T04:40:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	name whatever you like; copy to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and run "chmod +x /path/to/script" and it will show up in context menu in nautilus
2009-07-19T04:42:00.000Z	Kangarooo	VCoolio	so i then right click image and send to yes? or it will also have context enty "Take screenshot and upload and open link or copy link?"
2009-07-19T04:42:00.000Z	Kangarooo	VCoolio	and is your script in nautilus script website?
2009-07-19T04:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	it's not my script and I probably took it from gnome-look.org
2009-07-19T04:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	in context menu select "scripts", it's in there like you named it

2009-07-19T06:15:00.000Z	Kangarooo	VCoolio	wow its very great. also other file managers should have it. maybe it can be modified to use not only in file managers but also in Obmenu?
2009-07-19T06:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	it works with anything that has customizable actions; you can run the script from commandline also with a file (although it will pop up the window, it's not cli-only)
2010-03-04T03:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	no idea, but delete ~/.config/transmission and restart transmission and you're back to default; also set it how you want in the preferences

2010-03-04T03:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	Kangarooo	it goes to tray for me, but that may also be may configuration, don't remember
