2011-11-09T15:32:00.000Z	ederico		hello everyone, this will probably seem like a stupid question, but what do you reckon is better for system resources using a mail client like Thunderbird or access emails through webmail (i.e. browser)?
2011-11-09T15:32:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	well, gmail is faster than any desktop client x)
2011-11-09T15:34:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	I'm wondering, because I'm having trouble with system resources apparently, in fact I'm also considering switching to Kubuntu from Ubuntu (11.10) as I read that KDE is more efficient resource wise
2011-11-09T15:34:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	you don't really have to 'change' to kubuntu, you can just install 'kubuntu-desktop' package on your current installation to install "kubuntu"
2011-11-09T15:38:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm (or kdm) lets you choose between login managers
2011-11-09T15:38:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	if you're gonna run kde you probably wanna change to kdm
2011-11-09T15:40:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	I'll check that out
2011-11-09T15:44:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	xfce might be worth trying too
2011-11-09T15:44:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	yes, reading about them
2011-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop :)
2011-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	thanks
2011-11-09T15:46:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	so Xubuntu is Ubuntu with xfce? I always wondered what that was
2011-11-09T15:46:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	yes
2011-11-09T15:46:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	all ubuntu/xubuntu/kubuntu are all in the exact same repositories, they aren't anyhow 'separate' distros apart from default packages at install cd's
2011-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	so you can install and test them simply by apt-getting stuff
2011-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	so what happens is I change the desktop environment but would still use Ubuntu's apps (and those that I have installed myself after Ubuntu's installation?)
2011-11-09T15:48:00.000Z	crizzy	ederico	none of those get removed, you can run them just fine regardless of desktop environment
2011-11-09T15:48:00.000Z	ederico	crizzy	great, thanks for the support
