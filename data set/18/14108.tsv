2006-11-11T15:13:00.000Z	izm99		can I change root password via liveCD?
2006-11-11T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	izm99	default user?
2006-11-11T15:14:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	the first user... whose password is used for "sudo"
2006-11-11T15:15:00.000Z	Flannel	izm99	Your first user is a member of hte admin group, being 'first' doesn't make him special, he's simply a member of the admin group.  And yes, you can change his password, would you like a howto on doing so?
2006-11-11T15:16:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	I would love a howto on how to do that from a liveCD!
2006-11-11T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	izm99	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword, you'll use "Last Resort 2", and the reason your recovery console has a password is because you set a root password
2006-11-11T15:17:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	thx.  I'll report back soon.  :)
2006-11-11T15:40:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	I think there is a typo in that LostPassword page you sent me.
2006-11-11T15:41:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	it says to mount proc-filesystem (method2) do:  mount -o bind -t  proc mnttmp/proc
2006-11-11T15:41:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	that gives me an error about usage.  I think there should be an extra "proc"
2006-11-11T15:42:00.000Z	Flannel	izm99	well, it's a wiki, go ahead and change it if it's erroneous
2006-11-11T15:42:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	but when I do that, it says " special device proc does not exist"
2006-11-11T15:42:00.000Z	Flannel	izm99	heh, ok, so that's not the fix, at any rate
2006-11-11T16:03:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	jrib : I can't seem to change my passwd....  passwd returuns: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info.  password unchanged.
2006-11-11T16:03:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	jrib: I checked, and the /etc/passwd,group, and shadow files are present..
2007-04-21T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	izm99	you can't upgrade from dapper to feisty.  You need to go through edgy
2007-04-21T05:15:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	oh.  darn.  :(
2007-04-21T05:15:00.000Z	izm99	Flannel	ok, thx.
