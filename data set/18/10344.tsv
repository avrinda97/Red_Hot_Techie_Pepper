2007-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	TheVault		What will happen once my upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 happens? Will I still have my files & things?
2007-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	slavik	TheVault	yes
2007-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	TheVault	slavik	Thanks. What about my login & things? Will I have to re-setup that stuff?
2007-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	slavik	TheVault	no, the only thing that gets updated are all the packages (kernel, drivers, programs, etc)
2007-03-03T11:17:00.000Z	slavik	TheVault	I wouldn't suggest using it unless you are fine with (possibly) losing things
2007-03-03T11:18:00.000Z	TheVault	slavik	No, just wanna know what new features & upgrades and things, whats improved
2007-03-03T11:18:00.000Z	slavik	TheVault	search the wiki :)
2007-03-03T11:18:00.000Z	slavik	TheVault	the wiki usually has info and such
2007-03-03T11:19:00.000Z	slavik	TheVault	good :P
