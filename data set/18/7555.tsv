2008-07-03T09:33:00.000Z	rkj		I've just upgraded my Dell 1420 laptop to Hardy 8.04 and the sound no longer works. Anybody know how to fix it?
2008-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	this morning, sound stopped working for me. I set every sound parameter to alsa, then had to restart to re-enable sound
2008-07-03T09:37:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	davidd I will try a system reboot and see if that helps - I went to the Multimedia Selector and selected Alsa for both input and output
2008-07-03T09:37:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	are there other things to set to alsa first?
2008-07-03T09:56:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	I tried a reboot, as far as I can see I have everything set to Alsa, my sound card driver seems to be the same as the one used in Gutsy (same device name) but still no sound
2008-07-03T09:57:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	have you tried to play sound from the soud configuration interface?
2008-07-03T09:58:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	if you mean using the "Test" on the sound config dialog then yes, and it makes no sound
2008-07-03T09:58:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	that's a big issue... :(
2008-07-03T09:59:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	no kidding.  Makes Hardy kind of a bummer.
2008-07-03T10:00:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Rkj have you upgraded or installed from scratch?
2008-07-03T10:02:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	upgraded from Gutsy. Sound was working fine before the "upgrade"
2008-07-03T10:03:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	if it's of interest, the machine is a Dell Inspiron 1420
2008-07-03T10:03:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	upgrade is not recommended. Maybe if you install from scratch it will work
2008-07-03T10:04:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	upgrade not recommended?? If I install from scratch won't I have to reinstall every package too?
2008-07-03T10:06:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	every package not installed by default for sure. But in my case, I never upgrade, only reinstall from scratch
2008-07-03T10:08:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	I think maybe I will shell out the $250 for support from Canonical. I never could get all the other audio jacks such as external mic in to work with the previous versions either
2008-07-03T10:09:00.000Z	WalloO	rkj	your unlucky... for me it works better with linux than windows... :)
2008-07-03T10:11:00.000Z	rkj	WalloO	I don't mean to complain. I can get a year of support from Canonical for about the price of windows with no support, and windows generally doesn't work any better.
