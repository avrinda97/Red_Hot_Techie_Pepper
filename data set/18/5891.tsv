2009-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	Rilt		what is the name of the package that contains the manpages on ubuntu?
2009-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	^
2009-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	you probably want the development ones? manpages-dev
2009-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	ok :)
2009-04-30T07:08:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	Hmm that didn't seem to work, I installed both manpages and manpages-dev
2009-04-30T07:09:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	it might be manpages-posix-dev
2009-04-30T07:09:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	yep. i just installed it and got fopen
2009-04-30T07:10:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	hmm I did too but it still says "-bash: man command not found"
2009-04-30T07:11:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	uh... run "which man"
2009-04-30T07:11:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	no output?
2009-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	that's... strange you shouldn't be missing man
2009-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	it's usually at /usr/bin/man
2009-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	 doesnt exist :P
2009-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	this is a fresh install from a linode vps
2009-04-30T07:13:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	i'd reinstall manpages, then. just "manpages"
2009-04-30T07:36:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	Still no manpages, I used apt-get purge manpages to remove it... I also did a apt-get update and apt-get upgrade to see if that would help and still nothing
2009-04-30T07:48:00.000Z	raylu	Rilt	er... why'd you remove the manpages?
2009-04-30T07:52:00.000Z	Rilt	raylu	Got it working by installing man-db
