2010-01-12T11:04:00.000Z	bullgard		Two Ubuntu 9.10 computers. On both says Update Manager: "Your system is up-to-date." Still, one presents a 'man update-grub' of 2001, the other of 2009. Why is the former not up-to-date?
2010-01-12T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	Are you sure they're both 9.10? and the old one isn't 8.04?
2010-01-12T11:38:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	On both computers: '~$ lsb_release -a; No LSB modules are available. Distributor ID: Ubuntu; Description: Ubuntu 9.10; Release: 9.10; Codename: karmic'
2010-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	Alright, can you pastebin the output (of the machine with old grub man page) of the following: uname -a && apt-cache policy grub libc6

2010-02-01T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	edge is the development LP server
2010-02-01T12:12:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	Hm. What is meant by the phrase: "so we can catch those before they hit a wider audience."?
2010-02-01T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	They're trying to catch issues before they get moved from the development platform to the general public
2010-02-01T12:16:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	I am tempted to swaer. I have prepared a bug report in Launchpad. I took me more than one hour. And now I only read: "Sorry, something went wrong in Launchpad."
2010-02-01T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	You shouldn't be using the development server (no one should be)
2010-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	I entered Launchpad normally. I did not intend to use the development server. I was guided (or should I say "diverted"?) to this server.
2010-02-09T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	teddymills: Looks like you might have to wait for 10.10, actually.  Lucid currently has 10.04
2010-02-13T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	I don't believe there are categories, but you can browse the data yourself: http://popcon.ubuntu.com/
2010-02-13T12:13:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	There are. At least 3: having no tag, RECENT-CTIME, and NOFILES.  --  Please tell me what RECENT-CTIME and what NOFILES means.
2010-02-13T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	http://popcon.debian.org/README  search for "tag" and it'll give descriptions of the tags
2010-02-13T12:56:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	Thank you very much for providing this link to an excellent explanatory article.
2010-02-25T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	bullgard	Have you tried in #avahi?
2010-02-25T14:41:00.000Z	bullgard	Flannel	No. Let me hurry to do.
