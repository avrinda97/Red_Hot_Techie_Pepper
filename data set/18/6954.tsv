2008-03-08T06:22:00.000Z	D-Unit		will a pentium 4 thats 64-bit capable be faster or just work with 64-bit?
2008-03-08T06:22:00.000Z	D-Unit		intel 630 to be precise
2008-03-08T06:23:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	64bit ubuntu still has some package issues,  no flash and some drivers missing for nvidia/ati and such , we generaly recommend the 32bit unless you hvae a real use for 64 bit
2008-03-08T06:24:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	well i dont use youtube much if ever and dont encode much either but i do encode more than i use youtube so i c use for 64-bit in that sense but should my 32-bit dial-up modem driver work in it?
2008-03-08T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	I think you should be fine
2008-03-08T06:26:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	for 64-bit u mean, right?
2008-03-08T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	yeah,  , what is your video card ?
2008-03-08T06:27:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	ati saphire radeon x600 pro
2008-03-08T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	 that is where you might have issues,  I am not sure there are ati video drivers for the 64 bit version,
2008-03-08T06:28:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	well in like 4 months i was planning to buy a 8800 gt 512 mb so i should be good then?
2008-03-08T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	give it a try ,  if video is not an issue ther is always the vesa driver,  which should install by default anyway , if that doesn't work well for you , you'll know quickly enough,  and yuou can reinstall the 32bit one
2008-03-08T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	consider checkingthis link out  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2008-03-08T06:30:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	if video works well on live cd then that means ill have no video problems, right?
2008-03-08T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	live cd uses vesa driver as far as I know
2008-03-08T06:30:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	y does it matter which driver i use?
2008-03-08T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	I don't realy have any experince with either 64 bit or ati cards,  I'm just spitting back what I've read other say
2008-03-08T06:31:00.000Z	D-Unit	Pelo	k, well thx for answering some stuff
2008-03-08T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	D-Unit	depends how much you want out of your video card,  vesa is just a fallback driver, it won'T allow you to use 3d stuff and effect as far as I know
