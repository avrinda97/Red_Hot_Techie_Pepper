2009-08-05T07:08:00.000Z	Sahdos		I'm sure DMCA law applies in California
2009-08-05T07:10:00.000Z	Sahdos		anyone know how to make all printing to be green on a black background :)
2009-08-05T07:10:00.000Z	Sahdos		correction, not printing...displayed text
2009-08-05T07:11:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	...what displayed text? There's a lot of text in Ubuntu. :P
2009-08-05T07:12:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	actually, my problem is really on websites now
2009-08-05T07:13:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	 the greasemonkey script I tried didn't work...
2009-08-05T07:13:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	...you want to change the way websites look? Uhm... I guess you could change the default fonts and set up something in greasemonkey...
2009-08-05T07:13:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	 I'm not even sure if it's possible
2009-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	Definitely possible, just... very very useless and unnecessary. And probably difficult. :P
2009-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	not useless and unnecessary.  I find it aesthetically pleasing
2009-08-05T07:15:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	it helps me tolerate staring on the screen for extended stretches
2009-08-05T07:16:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	Well, while I might agree with that (currently using irssi with green on black :P), it's going to mess things up. When someone designs a website they have a certain design in mind, changing the way things are displayed might give you a lot of strange things to deal with. FOr instance, a green background - then your script changed text to green... Such things.
2009-08-05T07:17:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	actually changed my display colors a long time ago, and it was a pain in the ass browsing. everything gets distorted, and more often than not you need to highlight the text to even be able to see it ;)
2009-08-05T07:18:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	display colors and background colors?
2009-08-05T07:18:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	on websites, yes. since your preferences collide with css and html and whatnot... it just tends to get very hard to browse :)
2009-08-05T07:19:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	i already have challenges with my ubuntu theme
2009-08-05T07:19:00.000Z	Sahdos	burkmat	do you use a greasemonkey script?
2009-08-05T07:21:00.000Z	burkmat	Sahdos	Changed all system-wide default fonts and for browsing, yes, greasemonkey.
