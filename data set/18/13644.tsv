2005-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	If you're going to code n stuff you should check up vi and emacs but they're a bit trickier
2005-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	corincole	barongas	what are vi and emacs?
2005-11-02T07:38:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	What kaiser said
2005-11-02T07:39:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	vi and emacs are really advanced editors with highly developed functions for programmers. They can be tricky to learn but fast and efficient once mastered

2005-11-02T07:42:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	in order to compile lmme you probably need to install curses/ncurses and maybe dev packages
2005-11-02T07:44:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	I suppose you have lynx already... If you need a bittorrent client that works without X I'd go for torrentflux if you plan to install mysql/php/apache that is
2005-11-02T07:52:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	check out http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man1/aaxine.1.html an ascii video player :)
2005-11-02T07:53:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	and you WILL need nethack
2005-11-02T07:53:00.000Z	corincole	barongas	how can I copy and past?
2005-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	nethack is an ascii game which is extremely wellmade
2005-11-02T07:55:00.000Z	barongas	corincole	lynx works ok as a webbrowser but I find it has problems with many pages, any more up-to-date console browsers?
