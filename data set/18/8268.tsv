2007-10-18T05:29:00.000Z	zetheroo		what does it mean when they tell you there are security updates for Ubuntu Linux?..... I thought Linux was secure?!?
2007-10-18T05:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	it is.. they are updates.. its hardly future proof
2007-10-18T05:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	think realistically
2007-10-18T05:31:00.000Z	zetheroo	Paddy_EIRE	: well it makes it sound like Linux has security issues like Windows does
2007-10-18T05:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	hardly
2007-10-18T05:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	you here trolling
2007-10-18T05:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	Paddy_EIRE	I read this whole article where some guy is mocking Linux for having "Security Updates" just like windows..... and I was nerved by it..... so I thought I would find out what thats all about...
2007-10-18T05:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	its a good thing, worry when there are no updates
2007-10-18T05:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	Paddy_EIRE	does it mean though that Linux is vulnerable to outside attack .... or that viruses are being made for Linux?
2007-10-18T05:34:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	things can always be better nothing is infallible
2007-10-18T05:35:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	as far as security goes linux is the best
2007-10-18T05:35:00.000Z	zetheroo	Paddy_EIRE	I just wish they would name it something diferent so Windows users could not poke fun at Linux so easily
2007-10-18T05:35:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	what are you using it for
2007-10-18T05:36:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	hardly poking fun and those people are the trolls
2007-10-18T05:36:00.000Z	zetheroo	Paddy_EIRE	I use it on all my PC's
2007-10-18T05:38:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	updates are a great thing... technology moves fast and linux keeps state-of-the-art as apposed to windows updates being the second tuesday of every month which they dont really fix anything
2007-10-18T05:38:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	zetheroo	they add restrictions like wga and drm.. which hamper a user rather than benefit them
