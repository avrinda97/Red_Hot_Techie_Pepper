2007-08-10T10:24:00.000Z	Twomby		Anybody here familiar with truecrypt and Forcefield ?
2007-08-10T10:26:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	i installed trucrypt following a howto in the forums. works ok
2007-08-10T10:28:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: I installed it fine too.  I created a volume under Windows, but can't access it under ubuntu
2007-08-10T10:29:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	i have the exact same setup but it works for me. sadly i don't know much about how i made it to work.
2007-08-10T10:29:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	so i guess i can't help you much more than to confirm that it's possible
2007-08-10T10:30:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: Thanks, I know I'll get it to work someday.. I was rather looking for a shortcut instead of having to read a lot, I'm in a little hurry :)
2007-08-10T10:30:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	good luck :)
2007-08-10T10:31:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: Do you use the Gui (Forcefield) or the command line interfaace ?
2007-08-10T10:31:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	command line
2007-08-10T10:31:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	basically i only use one command to mount the volume since i created it in windows using gui
2007-08-10T10:32:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: let's say I have a volue mounted on sda6
2007-08-10T10:33:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	give me one minute please to reboot in linux to give you the exact syntax :)
2007-08-10T10:34:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: That would be greatly appreciated !!!!!
2007-08-10T10:39:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	ok it's easy: trucrypt /mnt/shared/xxxx /mnt/tc         (the /mnt/shared/xxxx is the location and name of the volume you want to mount)
2007-08-10T10:42:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: Thanks a lot !! I'll give it a try in a few minutes, and I'll give you some news !! I really appreciate it !!
2007-08-10T10:42:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	no problem
2007-08-10T10:59:00.000Z	Twomby	scipio	: Everything works fine !!! Thanks a bunch !!!!!
2007-08-10T10:59:00.000Z	scipio	Twomby	excellent :)
