2009-03-24T14:29:00.000Z	adaptr	ActionParsnip1	as accurate as the settings/maps are you feed into it
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr	ActionParsnip1	in my experience, the temp sensors are ok; the fans often suck
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr		voltage, so-so
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		just curious as to which is the cpu temp
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr		it hugely depends on the quality of the sensors
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		some say 62 deg and some say 40
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		which is a big difference
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr		which one
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr		the highest will be core temp
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr		the lower ones mainboard sensors
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		well thats my point, there about 5 different cpu0 temperatures that it makes the values near pointless
2009-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	adaptr		pastebin the output of sensors
2009-03-24T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		http://pastebin.com/f7e68e6a3
2009-03-24T14:33:00.000Z	adaptr	ActionParsnip1	I would say it is fairly self-explanatory; the cores are both at 65C
2009-03-24T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adaptr	line 24 says its 61 deg
2009-03-24T14:34:00.000Z	adaptr	ActionParsnip1	read teh core temps
2009-03-24T14:35:00.000Z	adaptr		that's the on-die sensor; it's bound to be more accurate than anything else
2009-03-24T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	adaptr	thought so, just checking, seems hogh for a 3000+ AM2 Semperon
