2011-01-17T15:12:00.000Z	ryanf_109		Hi All, I can't get an answer in #ubuntu-app-devel: What programming language is best for creating console apps?
2011-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	seriously, the answer depends on what you want to build
2011-01-17T15:15:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	then i have to second beginer, pick up a good book on python, look up the tutorials, fire up a nice text editor and code away
2011-01-17T15:16:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	GNOME apps are written mostly in GTK
2011-01-17T15:17:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	buttons*, python has PyGTK and other stuff that allow you to connect the two
2011-01-17T15:18:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	so learn some python, and then learn some GTK, as for Glade, yeah I think it works with python
2011-01-17T15:18:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	of course, python is just a suggestion, you can always choose something else
2011-01-17T15:20:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	that's a tricky one, they're both object oriented, you don't compile python to binary, it's dynamically typed (meaning a variable can change type in execution)
2011-01-17T15:20:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	i'd say python is more forgiving to those with a less technical background (for example if you're not good with pointers)
2011-01-17T15:21:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	sort of, python compiles to bytecode for optimization, but if you have a python program in .py files yes, those are the code itself
2011-01-17T15:22:00.000Z	ryanf_109	sugoruyo	does this mean that you have the option to kind of compile it, but not so the code is completely unreadable?
2011-01-17T15:23:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	Python is basically a scripting language, as far as I know there's no *sure-fire* way to make it *completely* unreadable AND have it run just as well/fast
2011-01-17T15:24:00.000Z	ryanf_109	sugoruyo	I suppose that means it's ideal if it's open source anyway?
2011-01-17T15:24:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	well I'll put it this way: if you're doing open source coding, it saves you compiling binaries AND you don't care who sees your code
2011-01-17T15:26:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	python is very popular in open source, see the ubuntu installer, the original implementation of bittorrent and lots of other stuff you use daily
2011-01-17T15:32:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	that sort of defeats the purpose of using sudo rather than root... plus it opens you up for some security issues
2011-01-17T15:32:00.000Z	ryanf_109	sugoruyo	lol ok this is when my bad practice starts to show.
2011-01-17T15:32:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ryanf_109	i've been rooted before
