2008-01-23T05:01:00.000Z	Hazarath	neverblue	All the drivers that mplayer found, yes. All installed.
2008-01-23T05:02:00.000Z	Hazarath	neverblue	Intel drivers installed. All other AVIs in my collection play, it's just this freggin' 1,200Kbps bitrate that's killing me.
2008-01-23T05:02:00.000Z	neverblue	Hazarath	not able to help you
2008-01-23T05:06:00.000Z	neverblue	Hazarath	whats the output from 'file movie.avi' ? (put on pastebin to not flood the channel)
2008-01-23T05:07:00.000Z	Hazarath	neverblue	What do I put in the terminal?
2008-01-23T05:08:00.000Z	neverblue	Hazarath	file is a command, which tells you information about a file, in this case, your movie
2008-01-23T05:09:00.000Z	Hazarath	neverblue	TheMatrix.mkv: Matroska data <-- That's it.
2008-01-23T05:10:00.000Z	neverblue	Hazarath	http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/codecid/wavpack.html :: happy reading
2008-01-23T05:11:00.000Z	Hazarath	neverblue	What does this tell me, besides script looking things?
2008-01-23T05:13:00.000Z	neverblue	Hazarath	i think you will have to actually read it to figure it out yourself
2008-01-23T05:14:00.000Z	Hazarath	neverblue	I can play the file, however, it stammers, hence me having the problem. If I wanted to research and develop my own files, that can come in handy. I need something to decode the files at a better rate, or convert it, not learn how it works.
2008-01-23T05:14:00.000Z	neverblue	Hazarath	your talking to the wrong person then
