2007-09-26T10:55:00.000Z	Fish-Face		Hey, I've been trying to install feisty, and the installation hangs after the message "Installed openoffice.org-java-common-x.x.x"
2007-09-26T10:55:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	from the alternate cd?
2007-09-26T10:56:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	correct
2007-09-26T10:56:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	if you press ALT+F4 it takes you to a console where they may be an error message..?
2007-09-26T10:56:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	I checked
2007-09-26T10:56:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	(and also poked for half an hour with the VT)
2007-09-26T10:57:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	which it couldn't, because the network wasn't properly set up
2007-09-26T10:57:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	check the cd?
2007-09-26T10:57:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	the CD is fine - the md5sum was good, and k3b verified the disk fully
2007-09-26T10:57:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	disk space?
2007-09-26T10:58:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	60Gb
2007-09-26T10:58:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	2Gb RAM, which didn't fail memtest after an hour or so
2007-09-26T10:58:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	1 hour isn't long enough IMO
2007-09-26T10:58:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	I have seen machines from for 12 hours then fail
2007-09-26T10:59:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	true, but I don't think memory's at fault
2007-09-26T10:59:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	run it anyway when you're asleep, lets you rule it out :)
2007-09-26T10:59:00.000Z	popey	Fish-Face	hang on though
2007-09-26T11:24:00.000Z	Fish-Face	popey	where were we
