2011-05-10T18:35:00.000Z	adam61		when installing ubuntu 11.04 onto my computer that only has a 'broken' windows 7 os, in the 'Allocate drive space' step, it said "This computer currently has no detected operating systems. What would you like to do?" how can i access my windows files (trying to save my mp3s), does anyone know?"
2011-05-10T18:36:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	Well, not sure what has happened.  You might try the LiveCD and see what you have.
2011-05-10T18:36:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	i have the ubuntu 8 live cd, will that work?
2011-05-10T18:37:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	Sure.
2011-05-10T18:39:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	Ctrl-Alt-F5
2011-05-10T18:40:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	yes
2011-05-10T18:40:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	You should be able to do it from the LiveCD
2011-05-10T18:46:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	sorry, i know you're very busy; can anyone tell me how to access windows files to copy them to an external drive
2011-05-10T18:47:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	Mount the partition and plug in a thumb drive and copy the files over.
2011-05-10T18:48:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	thank you; stupid question: how do i mount the partition?
2011-05-10T18:50:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	If you don't see any GUI for it, go to a terminal and first type   sudo fdisk -l   to see where the partitions are so that you can dermine which one will contain the mp3s you are wanting.  Then, (once you've discovered which partition it is), mount it with command:  sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  And then   cd /mnt  and start looking for them.  ls
2011-05-10T18:51:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	thank you very much! i'll try that
2011-05-10T18:51:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	Once you find them plug in the USB device and see where it is mounted to and then use the  cp  command to copy them over.  But if you find a GUI UI for it, I'm sure you will find it easier.
2011-05-10T18:54:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	i'm very sorry if this is a mess, but can you make sense of this? Disk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80032038912 bytes
2011-05-10T18:57:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	how do i tell if they are on partition 1 or 2?
2011-05-10T20:03:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	sorry to bother you again! i'm not able to see my usb drive in "places"
2011-05-10T20:03:00.000Z	usr13	adam61	unplug and plug it back in again.
2011-05-10T20:04:00.000Z	adam61	usr13	i'm running ubuntu 11 so i can't i don' think
