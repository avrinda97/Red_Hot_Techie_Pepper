2009-01-27T21:27:00.000Z	dual		How do I kill the sudo process
2009-01-27T21:27:00.000Z	dual		It uses 100% cpu
2009-01-27T21:27:00.000Z	dual		A sudo process on my computer uses 100% CPU. How do I kill it?
2009-01-27T21:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	that sounds a bit odd
2009-01-27T21:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	it's probably something called through sudo
2009-01-27T21:28:00.000Z	dual	gordonjcp	WHen I run "top", it says sudo
2009-01-27T21:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	you could use "sudo kill <process id>"
2009-01-27T21:28:00.000Z	dual	gordonjcp	Didnt work
2009-01-27T21:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	what didn't?
2009-01-27T21:29:00.000Z	dual	gordonjcp	killing sudo
2009-01-27T21:29:00.000Z	dual		Still runs like hell
2009-01-27T21:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	what is the PID of the sudo process?
2009-01-27T21:30:00.000Z	dual		10737
2009-01-27T21:30:00.000Z	dual		sudo kill 10737 doesn't work
2009-01-27T21:30:00.000Z	dual		Hmm
2009-01-27T21:31:00.000Z	dual		I'm rebooting, gordon
2009-01-27T21:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	okay, that's a bit odd, but not totally surprising
2009-01-27T21:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	dual	hang on, can you see it in ps -ax?
