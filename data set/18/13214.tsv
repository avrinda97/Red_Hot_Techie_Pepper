2006-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	lowman62	if you are SURE you have multiverse, please pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	lowman62	and you did apt-get update right?
2006-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	_jason	lowman62	multiverse isn't in dfault sources.list, you have to add it (basically everywhere 'universe' is alone)
2006-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	lowman62	_jason	oh okay so where i get that info do you know? sure ya do :)

2006-01-24T09:29:00.000Z	_jason	lowman62	we're on different pages, I don't know what you mean :)  If you see a line that has universe but not multiverse you just add it, pastebin if you aren't sure
