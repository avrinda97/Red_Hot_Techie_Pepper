2010-11-11T18:47:00.000Z	pinoyoragon		In 10.10, When I change my resolution to 1440x900 the top and bottom panels are gone, but i appears when i change it back to 1024x768. Why is that? i have an intel i915GM on Dell inspiron 640m
2010-11-11T18:47:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	Try resetting your panels in 1440x900?
2010-11-11T18:48:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	ubottu: ok i'll try
2010-11-11T18:49:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	ubottu: do i have to do this everytime i change resolution?
2010-11-11T18:51:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	ubottu: btw the icons on my desktop just flickered then no panels appeared...
2010-11-11T18:51:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	Well, does it work?
2010-11-11T18:52:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	When I plug in external monitor to the laptop or second monitor, panels (and positions) often can be found shuffled around.
2010-11-11T18:53:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	that's it... i'm using an external monitor also and it doesn't appear even if i tried using those commands
2010-11-11T18:54:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	You said 24" monitor?
2010-11-11T18:54:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	Well, either way. I wonder if your laptop's graphic card is powerful enough to manage both displays?
2010-11-11T18:55:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	I'll try the suggestion of Dr_Willis to make it the default display... will be back...
2010-11-11T19:00:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	Dr_Willis: We made it! I switched off the monitor of laptop in gnome-control-center and the panels appeared! Thanks guys!
2010-11-11T19:01:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	Nice. :o
2011-02-28T17:14:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	"man wget" or "wget --help" in the terminal.
2011-02-28T17:15:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	i wonder if wget can fork then accelerate download
2011-02-28T17:15:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	aria2
2011-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	red2kic	pinoyoragon	You want that. I believe.
2011-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	pinoyoragon	red2kic	thanks
