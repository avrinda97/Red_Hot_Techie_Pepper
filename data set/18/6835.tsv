2008-03-18T00:20:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		hey all
2008-03-18T00:21:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		I messed up my installation...
2008-03-18T00:21:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		How do I go about cleaning out Ubuntu and installing Kubuntu?
2008-03-18T00:22:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		I went to reboot cause I installed KDE too.  And then it gave me some error like it wouldn't read stuff
2008-03-18T00:22:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		first one was about the CPU or CPI, then the second was it ran out of RAM or something like that
2008-03-18T00:23:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		yea
2008-03-18T00:23:00.000Z	BluesDriv1		why?
2008-03-18T00:24:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	You don't need to... auso apt get install Kubuntu-desktop, then sudo Apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop, then apt-get autoclean
2008-03-18T00:42:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	Did you activate the video restricted driver?
2008-03-18T00:42:00.000Z	BluesDriv1	minimec	 I don't think so
2008-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	So.. during the boot process the screen changes to console mode?
2008-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	BluesDriv1	minimec	 it says my hardware does not need a restricted driver, but it's using just a generic video driver right now.  That's what I was in the process of doing
2008-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	BluesDriv1	minimec	 console mode?  if you mean the command lines, yes
2008-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	Can you login?
2008-03-18T00:44:00.000Z	BluesDriv1	minimec	I have to use the Live CD to use my computer.  Otherwise it gets stuck in the boot process
2008-03-18T00:45:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	Ok. First thing is to press ESC when grub starts. Maybe you can choose a different kernel.
2008-03-18T00:48:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	This will not bring you anything, as both system are the same. It's just the windows environment that changes.
2008-03-18T00:49:00.000Z	minimec	BluesDriv1	I guess you try to choose another kernel at the beginnig of the goot process (ESC -> grub)
