2006-10-07T11:55:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	blind	get a nic for that
2006-10-07T11:55:00.000Z	blind		I have a nic...
2006-10-07T11:55:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	blind	or you can do the easier route
2006-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	blind	get a wireless nic for the windows box and have it connect to the router
2006-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		and share files that way
2006-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	blind	Shadowpillar	that costs too much money.
2006-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	blind	not that much, if you get the right card
2006-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		$30 or so
2006-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	blind		30 dollars that i don't have

2006-10-07T11:57:00.000Z	blind		but it's upstairs, bro
2006-10-07T11:57:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	blind	connect the windows box to the router
2006-10-07T11:57:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	blind	throw the windows box up there and set up vnc
2006-10-07T11:57:00.000Z	blind	Shadowpillar	not an option.
