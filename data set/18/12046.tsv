2006-06-04T06:47:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	klormexor	ah, did you run 'sudo update-grub' after running the ln?
2006-06-04T06:47:00.000Z	klormexor	RandolphCarter	to get that bootsplash sorry, I did link a file from that folder to /boot/grub/etc...  and it shows the link
2006-06-04T06:48:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	klormexor	sorry, afaik it ran it automagically after you installed the grub-splashimages package, my fault
2006-06-04T06:48:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	klormexor	provided the link's setup okay, running that command should say something like 'Splashimage Found at...'
