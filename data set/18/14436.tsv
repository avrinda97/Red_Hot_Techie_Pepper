2005-09-06T11:28:00.000Z	jefis		how to disable boot scripts on startup like 0dns-down and time synchroning?
2005-09-06T11:29:00.000Z	rob_p	jefis	 use update-rc.d to remove the symbolic links from the appropriate run levels
2005-09-06T11:29:00.000Z	jefis		how?:)
2005-09-06T11:30:00.000Z	rob_p	jefis	 at the command do something like, "update-rc.d -f whatever_script.sh remove"
2005-09-06T11:30:00.000Z	jefis		hmm
2005-09-06T11:30:00.000Z	jefis	rob_p	what is scripts name that checks "0dns-down" and time synchoning with ubuntulinux.org
2005-09-06T11:30:00.000Z	rob_p	jefis	 That will remove it from all of the run levels.
2005-09-06T11:31:00.000Z	rob_p	jefis	 I think that would be dns-clean
2005-09-06T11:31:00.000Z	jefis		right
2005-09-06T11:31:00.000Z	jefis		and with time?
2005-09-06T11:32:00.000Z	rob_p	jefis	 and the time sync happens with ntpdate... I think.  I use ntp-server but I think the default is ntpdate.
2005-09-06T11:33:00.000Z	jefis		yes
2005-09-06T11:33:00.000Z	jefis		by the way, how to get  kernel source?
2005-09-06T11:34:00.000Z	jefis		em
2005-09-06T11:34:00.000Z	jefis		is anyway with apt-get ?
2005-09-06T11:35:00.000Z	jefis		how?
2005-09-06T11:35:00.000Z	jefis		ok, i will try it later
2005-09-06T11:36:00.000Z	rob_p	jefis	 probably apt-get install linux-source-2.x.x or something similar...  just do a, "apt-cache search kernel-source" and you should be able to find what you need.
