2010-02-21T10:09:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	the same goes for you, read what I wrote to mobidroid
2010-02-21T10:11:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	huh? so you disabled pulseaudio?
2010-02-21T10:12:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	so from alsamixer its not muted? its some other audio server that's interfering, try switching the audio servers on the media player you are using
2010-02-21T10:13:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	even after switching the audio server?
2010-02-21T10:14:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	depending on your media player, I know smplayer and vlc for example is capable of doing it
2010-02-21T10:16:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	which media player are you using?
2010-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	I'd try giving smplayer a go and dumping the output of mplayer's log into pastebin
2010-02-21T10:21:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	nothing works if you sit there, complain and don't try anything
2010-02-21T10:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	no you haven't
2010-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	pastebin the output of mplayer in full
2010-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	pastebin the output of mplayer leading up to fatal error
2010-02-21T10:35:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	paket	smplayer? open up the place where it will show you mplayer log
