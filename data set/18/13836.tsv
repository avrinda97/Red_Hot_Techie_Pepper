2006-01-24T17:17:00.000Z	damg		is it possible to update from 5.10 to 6.04 via apt-get (don't want to download an iso and kill my FS)
2006-01-24T17:17:00.000Z	damg		?
2006-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	diesel	damg	yes it is possible
2006-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	diesel	damg	I wouldn't recommend that until it is out of testing and into productino
2006-01-24T17:19:00.000Z	damg	diesel	:/ not so easy as from deb stable -> deb testing, ok
2006-01-24T17:20:00.000Z	diesel	damg	the process is the same
2006-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	diesel	damg	however, I don't think comparing debian testing and ubuntu dapper is quite the same
2006-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	damg	diesel	well, I have nothing against beta stage, this machine is not intended for production. And in the end - hey, the software is just repackaged and dealing with unfulfilled deps - I can live with that. Are there any known problems if I change repositories and update?
2006-01-24T17:23:00.000Z	diesel	damg	You can change your sources.list to point to dapper and apt-get dist-upgrade, but hold on because some of the dapper packages are broken...that's why it is beta
2006-01-24T17:23:00.000Z	damg	diesel	thanks for your information
2006-01-24T17:23:00.000Z	diesel	damg	if you can live with a broken system, then you can try it
2006-01-24T17:24:00.000Z	damg	diesel	well, I wanted a bit updated software (im used to Gentoo ;) ) and due to the fact that ubuntu freezes the versions, I have a "bad" feeling :D
2006-01-24T17:24:00.000Z	diesel	damg	I am curious, do you just want to get the most "bleeding-edge" software possible?
2006-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	damg	diesel	kinda, but should be a bit stable
2006-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	diesel	damg	I probably shouldn't say this in this channel, but why not try debian unstable (with bts)?
2006-01-24T17:27:00.000Z	damg	diesel	last time i did deb unstable, I landed between updated gnome, but outdated gnome-panel (whereby there was no dep ;) ). And in similar situations for other software, too. So I avoid deb unstable. In contrary to that Gentoo's packages are properly packaged, but I can't install it here because the livecd kernel doesn't have netdrivers for this damn laptop :D
2006-01-24T17:30:00.000Z	diesel	damg	yeah, with debian unstable you run certain risks...however, with a bts (bug tracking system), I have _rarely_ had troubles with unstable
2006-01-24T17:31:00.000Z	damg	diesel	i think a bit changed since sarge release. I think you got me. I'll give it a try this weekend. Thanks for the idea ;)
