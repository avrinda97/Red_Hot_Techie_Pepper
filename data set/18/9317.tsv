2008-08-21T03:55:00.000Z	caveman26		20g Media
2008-08-21T03:56:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	nah not that, open up terminal and type "ls /media" what does it say?
2008-08-21T03:50:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	whats the filesystem?
2008-08-21T03:51:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	where do u mount it?
2008-08-21T03:52:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	hm, well u gotta know the mountpoint, did u mount it manually or was it done automatically? its probably in /media
2008-08-21T03:53:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	look in /media there supposed to be something there besides cdrom
2008-08-21T03:53:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	tell me whats there
2008-08-21T03:55:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	ok then whats the name of the external?
2008-08-21T03:58:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	hm, u sure its mounted? try to mount it as root
2008-08-21T04:02:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	nice so on the terminal type "sudo chown `whoami`:`whoami` -R /media/disk
2008-08-21T04:05:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	no problem
2008-08-21T04:07:00.000Z	usser	caveman26	that depends on the way u use the filesystem, reiser performs better when theres a lot of small files scattered all over
