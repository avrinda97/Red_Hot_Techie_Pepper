2006-07-26T12:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	stop repeating please.
2006-09-23T10:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	probably never.
2006-09-23T10:40:00.000Z	axa-axa	fyrestrtr	!? Why is that ?
2006-09-23T10:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	because its LTS and Edgy is coming with 2.16.
2006-09-23T10:41:00.000Z	axa-axa	fyrestrtr	Uh, but when will it come :(
2006-09-23T10:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	October.
2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	axa-axa	fyrestrtr	And can I upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 without too much hustle?
2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	yes, eventually; don't try it now as its still being worked on and has a few bugs.
2006-09-23T10:43:00.000Z	axa-axa	fyrestrtr	thanks.
2006-10-04T14:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	no.
2006-10-04T14:07:00.000Z	axa-axa	fyrestrtr	than what does LTS mean?
2006-10-04T14:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	axa-axa	means its supported for longer than the other releases, not that it will update to the latest and greatest.
