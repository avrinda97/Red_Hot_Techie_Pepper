2007-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	jodde		That's the model I take it.
2007-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	jodde		What's the make?
2007-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	jodde		Sorry, one more time with the model?  X-Chat didn't repaint properly.
2007-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	jodde		A lot of programs do that for some reason.
2007-10-01T10:19:00.000Z	jodde		Here, try this:

2007-10-01T10:21:00.000Z	jodde		Anyone here use Limewire?
2007-10-01T10:21:00.000Z	jodde		My amule won't connect to anything.
2007-10-01T10:22:00.000Z	jodde		I keep getting connection issues.
2007-10-01T10:22:00.000Z	jodde		Does Ubuntu have a built in firewall?
2007-10-01T10:22:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	yes
2007-10-01T10:25:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	there is a firewall by default.
2007-10-01T10:25:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	it's called iptables
2007-10-01T10:27:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	I'd use a frontend like firestarter to configure iptables.
2007-10-01T10:27:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	it's in there...hold on haven't used Add/Remove in a long time
2007-10-01T10:28:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	under "Show" Choose "All available applications"
2007-10-01T10:31:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	btw, for your reference: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/security
2007-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	jodde	sudo
