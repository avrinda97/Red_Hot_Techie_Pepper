2005-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	the fact is that you actually have to think and know how and what to partition.
2005-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	what has screwed your partitions up is what you tell the install todo
2005-04-01T06:10:00.000Z	viZion	scizzo	i'm not saying it wasnt my fault.. i only say that the setup is in that way not n00b proof enough to make it clear for people, that they should NOT install grub in their MBR but in a seperate /boot partition
2005-04-01T06:10:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	?
2005-04-01T06:10:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	what you should maybe do is to read the information....
2005-04-01T06:11:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	there is guides to stuff...and of course...if you go to the page you will also see that there has been one release of ubuntu and the second is comming soon
2005-04-01T06:12:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	how did you partition and what did you tell the install that the bootable partition should be?
2005-04-01T06:14:00.000Z	scizzo	viZion	and which one is bootable?
