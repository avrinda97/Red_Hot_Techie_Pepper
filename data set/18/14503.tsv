2005-07-21T06:24:00.000Z	sJaM		you can define them yourself Heimdall
2005-07-21T06:24:00.000Z	sJaM		in the config somewhere
2005-07-21T06:25:00.000Z	sJaM		you only have to open 1 tcp port and an optional udp port
2005-07-21T06:25:00.000Z	Heimdall	sJaM	I know but maybe it is better to put default ones
2005-07-21T06:26:00.000Z	Heimdall	sJaM	but in the options it is written 6889 TCP, I just oppened it but it does not download (red head)
2005-07-21T06:28:00.000Z	sJaM	Heimdall	you can use https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 (Shields Up) to check if your ports are not stealth (open or close)
2005-07-21T06:34:00.000Z	sJaM	Heimdall	open that means there is nothing wrong with your ports settings (firewall/router)
2005-07-21T06:35:00.000Z	Heimdall	sJaM	hum no...
2005-07-21T06:36:00.000Z	Heimdall	sJaM	at centraltracker.org:81 I have : d14:failure reason56:unsupported tracker protocol, please upgrade your cliente
