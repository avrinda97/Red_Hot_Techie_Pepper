2005-10-15T15:52:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	compile a -ck kernel :-)
2005-10-15T15:53:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	That just went right over my head, but when I hear the word "compile" I guess that means "Linux Newbie = Big No No".
2005-10-15T15:53:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	lol
2005-10-15T15:54:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	whats you machine spec?
2005-10-15T15:55:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	Dell Inspiron 600m, 1.3GHz Pentium Centrino w/ 1024KB Lvl 2 Cache, 512MB SDRAM @ 266MHz, Mobility Radeon 9000 64MB 128-Bit AGP 4x.
2005-10-15T15:56:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	what sort of slowness?
2005-10-15T15:56:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	When dragging windows there are "trails".
2005-10-15T15:57:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	using ati driver or the xorg driver?
2005-10-15T15:57:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	I'm not sure, how do I check?
2005-10-15T15:57:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	It's a laptop, and I didn't not install the driver, Ubuntu did that for me while the installation, so I'm gussing xorg?
2005-10-15T15:57:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	i'm not a ATI person since i've always had a nvidia card on Linux
2005-10-15T15:59:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	There are no ATI drivers for laptops as far as I know. But I know in Windows there are options lets you tune down your visual elements, such as when dragging windows it only shows the outline instead of the entire window, are there anyways to do that in GNOME?
2005-10-16T16:00:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	it's not a gnome thing no
2005-10-16T16:01:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	nvidia has renderaccelration which gives not redraw what so ever
2005-10-16T16:04:00.000Z	SuseUX	anchovie	ubuntu tends to be slower, even i've noticed that
2005-10-16T16:04:00.000Z	anchovie	SuseUX	Ooo... what's a comparabily faster distribution? =)
