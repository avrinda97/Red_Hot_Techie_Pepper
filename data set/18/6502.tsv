2009-04-06T02:42:00.000Z	Prose		anyway I can change the resolution of a session at the login prompt ?
2009-04-06T02:43:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	you could try ctrl+alt+<numeric +/->
2009-04-06T02:43:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	it worked years ago..
2009-04-06T02:43:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	no I mean, change the resolution I am about to login into
2009-04-06T02:44:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	I changed the resolution in -session and  the screen decided it was "out of range"
2009-04-06T02:44:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	have you tried login using failsafe (gnome or terminal) session and fixing it?
2009-04-06T02:44:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	yeah ... still out of sync...
2009-04-06T02:45:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	CLI command would be damned welcome
2009-04-06T02:45:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	what file did you edit?
2009-04-06T02:47:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	I just changed the resolution via the GUI
2009-04-06T02:54:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	hmm.. you could try deleting $HOME/.gnome2/monitors.xml
2009-04-06T02:55:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	really now, that barely sounds like a good idea
2009-04-06T02:55:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	I'll give it a try I guess..
2009-04-06T02:55:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	why? this is local setting and without it gnome should just load defaults
2009-04-06T02:57:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	there is no file called monitor.xml is gnome2
2009-04-06T02:57:00.000Z	kklimonda	Prose	check also $HOME/.config/
2009-04-06T02:59:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	found it, removed it, rebooting
2009-04-06T03:00:00.000Z	Prose	kklimonda	all right! it worked! thanks a bunch :) :)
