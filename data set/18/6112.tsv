2011-05-23T17:20:00.000Z	linsux		kde a better DE
2011-05-23T17:20:00.000Z	linsux		gnome crashes too much
2011-05-23T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	kde is too fat for my tastes
2011-05-23T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	don't use it then, there are many DEs to choose from
2011-05-23T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	in your opinion ;)
2011-05-23T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	got a link to back that up?
2011-05-23T17:23:00.000Z	linsux	ActionParsnip	google
2011-05-23T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	no, back up your own rant
2011-05-23T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	go get me one you are satisfied with.
2011-05-23T17:24:00.000Z	linsux	ActionParsnip	go google it yourself im not gonna do things for you you don't pay me
2011-05-23T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	then your rant is worthless as you have nothing to back it up with
2011-05-23T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	chat with root is a really bad idea too
2011-05-23T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	there is no root password
2011-05-23T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	because running everything as root is a really bad practice if you care about system security
2011-05-23T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	its not really a problem
2011-05-23T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	if s/he understood his/her OS, then they'd realize why the OS is how it is
2011-05-30T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	apt-get and aptitude handle that for you, remove what you don't need then run: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove
2011-05-30T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linsux	install w32codes from medibuntu repo
