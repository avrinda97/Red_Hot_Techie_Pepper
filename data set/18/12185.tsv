2006-05-21T16:30:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		how do i open .wmv porn files in linux?
2006-05-21T16:31:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		that's been the hardest part of my transition
2006-05-21T16:32:00.000Z	hyphenated	ToHellWithGA	they're 'restricted' because of the format (wmv) not because of the content ;-)
2006-05-21T16:32:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		thanks hyphenated
2006-05-21T16:32:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		yeah i totally understand
2006-05-21T16:32:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i used that page to setup mp3 and flash and java
2006-05-21T16:32:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		just didn't think of video codecs at the time
2006-05-21T16:33:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		but i've been using linux for almost a week and it's becoming unbearable having no access to my good old .wmv porn
2006-05-21T16:33:00.000Z	hyphenated		I'd probably have got video formats working first.
2006-05-21T16:33:00.000Z	hyphenated		I have an ipod to play mp3s anyway, and I barely care for flash and java
2006-05-21T16:34:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		out of curiousity, if i were to upgrade to dapper would i have to come anew with all of my software?
2006-05-21T16:34:00.000Z	hyphenated		'anew'? you probably wouldn't have to learn many new software programs. it'll mostly be more recent versions rather than different default applications
2006-05-21T16:35:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	hyphenated	a mean reinstall the software.  i've been doing ./configure, make, make install from source to get newest versions anyway :)
2006-05-21T16:35:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		*i mean
2006-05-21T16:35:00.000Z	hyphenated	ToHellWithGA	you can use the package manager to update things.. it's a 'cleaner' way than managing all your installs from source packages
2006-05-21T16:36:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i'm asking if reinstalling the OS would wipe the drive and start from scratch
2006-05-21T16:36:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		or if it would be an upgrade more than a clean slate thing
2006-05-21T16:36:00.000Z	hyphenated	ToHellWithGA	no, you'll have the choice of 'install' or 'upgrade'
