2012-02-14T22:23:00.000Z	Dunuts		Hi all quick question, my wifi on my laptop has suddenly stopped working, no driver is detected in the additional drivers so I totally reinstalled 11.10 hoping it would solve it cause It was initially working but no such look, it's like the card is suddenly not detected, any ideas would be welcome?
2012-02-14T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	is there a switch to enable / disable the wifi?
2012-02-14T22:24:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	there is on but the light is orange?
2012-02-14T22:24:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	the switch is in the on position
2012-02-14T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	try the switch then run:  sudo iwlist scan
2012-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	if no wifis are found, repress then rescan
2012-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	it says that the interface doesn't support scanning
2012-02-14T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	if you run:  sudo rfkill list    does it say the interface is blocked in any way?
2012-02-14T22:34:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	nothing comes up after I type 'sudo rfkill list'
2012-02-14T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	if you run:   sudo lshw -C network
2012-02-14T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	does it say the interface is disabled or unclaimed or anything like that?
2012-02-14T22:35:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	it just says: ' PCI (sysfs)
2012-02-14T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	give it time
2012-02-14T22:36:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	just ran it again now so I'm waiting for it
2012-02-14T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	your pci bus is slow
2012-02-14T22:37:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	it didn't bring up anything else there, it's not just brought back up my username and the @ symbol etc
2012-02-14T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dunuts	is the networking service running?
2012-02-14T22:38:00.000Z	Dunuts	ActionParsnip	nothing is happening now, I ran that but after a while it just brought back up my username and the weird dollar symbol you know
