2009-09-15T02:50:00.000Z	n8tuser		ActionParsnip-> an actual user insights is the best.. sharing of experience..

2009-09-15T02:55:00.000Z	n8tuser		kurrata-> meaning to create a script.
2009-09-15T02:55:00.000Z	n8tuser		dfgas-> i would not touch beta either.
2009-09-15T02:57:00.000Z	n8tuser		ComradeHaz-> is that grub2 for the newer or latest jaunty?
2009-09-15T02:58:00.000Z	n8tuser		k0nane-> how long does it stop responding? and do you have to do anything drastic to make it recover?
2009-09-15T02:58:00.000Z	n8tuser		ComradeHaz-> you may have to visit #ubuntu+1
2009-09-15T02:59:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	As I can never 'watch' it happen I couldn't say when it stops, but it remains unresponsive until I reboot it.
2009-09-15T03:02:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	No, they're vulnerability scanners. I noticed DList (if I recall correctly) entries in my Apache logs, and figured it would be wise to run a couple of scanners to ensure there wasn't anything blatently hackable that wasn't showing up.
2009-09-15T03:05:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	No firewall rules except to route from 10.8.x (for my OpenVPN redirect-gateway).
2009-09-15T03:08:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	Any suggestions on keep alive scripts? Other than keeping the thing up, would they give me some useful diagnostic info so  Ican fix the real problem?
2009-09-15T03:09:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	I must be dense... Keep logging what? And, ping out from the server, or ping the server from local?
2009-09-15T03:12:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	Okay, and when I get the time, if there's still nothing useful to reference in logs?
2009-09-15T03:17:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	Alright. I'll look at running a script like that. I may also run a 'tail -F /var/log/syslog' from local SSH to get the last entry when it times out.
2009-09-15T03:24:00.000Z	k0nane	n8tuser	I have noticed an odd pattern here. http://paste.ubuntu.com/271247/ What's odd is that that particular cronjob runs all day just fine, then it seems to freeze on the very last execution?
