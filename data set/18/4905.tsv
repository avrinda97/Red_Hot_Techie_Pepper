2009-01-27T06:17:00.000Z	BCampbell		how does one make the "documents" folder in the home directory open the "my documents" folder on a windows ntfs partition?  is it a symlink I need?
2009-01-27T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 yes  'ln -s oneplace  /path/to/otherplace
2009-01-27T06:17:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	thanks
2009-02-01T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 whats not working with it - exactly?
2009-02-01T06:47:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	when trying to access shares from Windows to Ubuntu I either get a login prompt or a blank window
2009-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 i always make same username on windows and linux - and give the linux a samba password with 'sudo smbpasswd -a username' (i also give the user the SAME password as he uses on windows)     - Or i think one can enable guest browsing/access on the samba server.. but i rarely do that
2009-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 i think thers some 'unknown user = guest' option that may be  required also
2009-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	i shoudl create the windows user on the ubuntu box?
2009-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 i always do. even if its never used. (thi is my home lan so i only have 4 users anyway)
2009-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	ok, will try
2009-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 the samba-books in the repos are worth reading for a lot of this info.
2009-02-01T07:11:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	I still cannot access linux shares from windows.  I noticed that all the shares are owned by root.  I have tried to chown (as root) to my user, but it's not working.  Could this be my problem?
2009-02-01T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 you  chown the share 'directory' not the share itself.
2009-02-01T07:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 and you may want to chmod them to a  mode that lets others access them.
2009-02-01T07:12:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	yes, when i do chown -c it says all has been changed, but when I ls -l all still show as owned by root
2009-02-01T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	BCampbell	 chown -c? Hmm...  Not sure what that does.. :)    Hers my smb.conf file for and example -->   http://superstud.pastebin.com/f387a2e90  and my Public share --> drwxr-xr-x 4 willis willis 4.0K 2009-01-13 21:49 PublicVideos/
2009-02-01T07:15:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	-c is a verbose mode, shows all finished tasks
2009-02-01T07:53:00.000Z	BCampbell	Dr_willis	thanks for the help, think I got it now...
