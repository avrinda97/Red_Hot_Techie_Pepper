2009-05-11T03:43:00.000Z	mjm52		oooh
2009-05-11T03:43:00.000Z	mjm52		that might be true as well
2009-05-11T03:43:00.000Z	mjm52		the forums online suggest to put what the runscript runs as a gnome startup app
2009-05-11T03:44:00.000Z	mjm52		but i'd prefer to use the runscript if possible
2009-05-11T03:44:00.000Z	mjm52		still need to look into it some
2009-05-11T03:44:00.000Z	mjm52		can't reboot right now, installing Visual Studio 2008 on a Windows 7 Virtual machine
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	mjm52		hate to applaud microsoft while in an ubuntu forum, but windows 7 is kinda neat
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	mjm52		just in VMware for me
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	mjm52		not good enough to be my main OS
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	mjm52		WGA?
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	usser	mjm52	its great and all, not enough incentive for me to switch from linux though
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	mjm52		that's my thought too
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	mjm52	ubuntu	is just way too usable (and fast!) to xfer over to Windows 7
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	mjm52		and all apps (games excluded) can run in a VM
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	mjm52		it gave my disk performance a 7.7/7.9
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	mjm52		haha
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	mjm52		stop what/
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	usser	mjm52	and windows just doesnt have the same tools readily available, like openvpn, ssh, aircrack, compilers, its just lacking
