2006-11-03T12:49:00.000Z	morgue		I go to http://asdfasfd.jpg
2006-11-03T12:49:00.000Z	morgue		and I don't get the set as wallpaper option
2006-11-03T12:16:00.000Z	morgue		can someone check if they get "set as wallpaper" option when right clicking on an imagen in firefox 2.0?
2006-11-03T12:18:00.000Z	soundray	morgue	yes, but it's called "set as desktop background"
2006-11-03T12:19:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	can you go to help -> about and copy-paste the bottom part please?
2006-11-03T12:20:00.000Z	soundray	morgue	no, can't you just ask what you want to know from it?
2006-11-03T12:21:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	I'm not getting the 'set as desktop background' option so I want to check if my build is different or something like that
2006-11-03T12:22:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	at the ff forum someone told me the edgy version doesn't come with the option
2006-11-03T12:23:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	how do i get that?
2006-11-03T12:24:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	found it
2006-11-03T12:25:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	omg thanks!
2006-11-03T12:25:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	how did you find that?
2006-11-03T12:25:00.000Z	soundray	morgue	I didn't. I remembered that I installed it.
2006-11-03T12:25:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	THANKS
2006-11-03T13:14:00.000Z	soundray	morgue	no. Gnome isn't an image viewer
2006-11-03T13:15:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	excuse me I meant Eye of GNOME 2.16.1
2006-11-03T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	morgue	yes, that's the one
2006-11-03T13:16:00.000Z	morgue	soundray	funny 'cause I used to get options when I right clicked on pictures, now I don't
