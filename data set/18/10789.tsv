2006-10-25T05:38:00.000Z	jrib		 dontbanme no not really
2006-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	jrib		yeah... :/
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	so, why might Synaptic tell me that it needs to remove ubuntu-desktop? I don't think I have any weird apps that would conflict with it
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	how are you using synaptic to upgrade?
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	"mark all upgrades" in smart upgrade mode
2006-10-25T05:43:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	I see, well I would recommend using apt-get instead after updating sources.list.  Then if you still have problems, pastebin the output
2006-10-25T05:44:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	apt reports the same thing
2006-10-25T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	pastebin all the output
2006-10-25T05:47:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28170/
2006-10-25T05:47:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	your thoughts?
2006-10-25T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	"interesting" atm
2006-10-25T05:48:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	?
2006-10-25T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	you have a backup?
2006-10-25T05:50:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	yes
2006-10-25T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	I would dist-upgrade and then try to install ubuntu-desktop afterwards, and then dist-upgrade again
2006-10-25T05:52:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	ok, I was just wondering
2006-10-25T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	dontbanme	it shouldn't cause too much trouble, it just won't be as smoot
2006-10-25T06:00:00.000Z	dontbanme	jrib	funny, last time I said something even remotely offtopic, gnomefreak permabanned me (I think my old hostname is still blacklisted
