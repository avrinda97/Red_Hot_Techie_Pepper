2007-09-18T09:41:00.000Z	rafaelscj	dystopianray	SlimeyPete: thanks
2007-09-18T09:44:00.000Z	rafaelscj	dystopianray	will apt-get remove kubuntu-artwork-usplash change to the ubuntu's one?
2007-09-18T09:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	rafaelscj	i'm not sure, but it will be rid of kubuntu's artwork
2007-09-18T10:09:00.000Z	dystopianray	rafaelscj	it's a lot more than just a window manager
2007-09-18T10:09:00.000Z	dystopianray	rafaelscj	kubuntu uses kde rather than gnome
2007-09-18T10:10:00.000Z	rafaelscj	dystopianray	I know, but how about the "wizards" like network-manager... are the same?
2007-09-18T10:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	rafaelscj	they both have network-manager, ubuntu has nm-applet, kubuntu has knetworkmanager
2007-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	rafaelscj	if you prefer gnome use ubuntu, if you prefer kde use kubuntu
