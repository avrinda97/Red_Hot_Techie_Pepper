2008-05-13T21:07:00.000Z	kauer	dury	You said "sudo apt-get install -f what is it for?" What do you mean? Do you mean that -f will cause the held-back packages to install?
2008-05-13T21:07:00.000Z	dury	kauer	yeah can't install packages
2008-05-13T21:08:00.000Z	kauer		Basically I want to know what that message actually *means* "The following packages have been kept back"
2008-05-13T21:08:00.000Z	dury	kauer	it's trying to update to 8.04
2008-05-13T21:09:00.000Z	dury		and the databs
2008-05-13T21:09:00.000Z	dury		sorry
2008-05-13T21:09:00.000Z	kauer	dury	You mean they are held back until my distro catches up?
2008-05-13T21:10:00.000Z	dury	kauer	the database it's broken or something can't install packages, what's wrong
2008-05-13T21:17:00.000Z	kauer	dury	Sorry, I don't understand you. Are you making a statement or asking me a question? I would like to know exactly what the "held back" message means. That is, under what conditions does apt-get issue that message?
2008-05-13T21:35:00.000Z	dury	kauer	iare you there
