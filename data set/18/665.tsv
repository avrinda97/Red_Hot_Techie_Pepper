2011-11-01T12:06:00.000Z	harsh343	zykotick9	ok thanks
2011-11-14T11:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	harsh343	users need to be in the "admin" group to sudo.
2011-11-14T11:17:00.000Z	harsh343	zykotick9	means i am not able to use this command with any other username
2011-11-14T11:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	harsh343	add your new user to the "admin" group (not sure how if you don't currently have a sudo users though)
2012-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	harsh343	scp? (which uses ssh for access, the remote server would have to be running ssh for that to work)
2012-01-19T12:26:00.000Z	harsh343	zykotick9	yes ssh
2012-01-19T13:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	harsh343	destination also should be "... username@remoteserver:/var/www"
2012-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	harsh343	xkill is "weak".  You could probably use "killall soffice.bin" from terminal.
2012-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	harsh343	zykotick9	what i can do ?
2012-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	harsh343	from a terminal run "killall soffice.bin"
2012-02-25T10:55:00.000Z	harsh343	zykotick9	excellent works thanks dear
