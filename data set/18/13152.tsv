2006-01-27T17:45:00.000Z	idefix_		I read somewhere that it is bad style to log in as superuser, is this true?
2006-01-27T17:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	Yes.  Use sudo for just about everything.
2006-01-27T07:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	You can /msg it from anywhere.
2006-01-27T07:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	Why do you want to?
2006-01-27T12:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	white=not selected, nothing interesting, star=newly available, updated, or something like that, green=installed.
2006-01-27T12:26:00.000Z	idefix_	tonyyarusso	so if you're a real fanatic you'd mark all upgrades of the white boxes with yellow stars and click apply ?
2006-01-27T12:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	No, you use the option to automatically select all upgrades, then click apply.
2006-01-27T12:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	Why click them all?
2006-01-27T12:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	?  I wouldn't say I'm a real fanatic either, just like to be up-to-date.
2006-01-27T12:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	I do it via command line, but yes.
2006-01-27T12:28:00.000Z	idefix_	tonyyarusso	apt-get upgrade?
2006-01-27T12:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	Yep.
2006-01-27T12:29:00.000Z	idefix_	tonyyarusso	should I do it too or could my PC get slower from it?
2006-01-27T12:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	Well, I don't really know enough about the inner workings of things to answer that intelligently, but I've seen no problem.
2006-01-27T12:31:00.000Z	idefix_	tonyyarusso	I'll just try then..
2006-01-27T12:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	I don't think it matters.  I'm always running stuff.
2006-01-27T12:42:00.000Z	idefix_	tonyyarusso	do you know it?
2006-01-27T12:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	idefix_	What jamuraa said, then click Apply.
