2011-09-23T15:36:00.000Z	Dulcin		For some reason I'm getting a lot of 404 messages on an apt-get update, when I try to apt-get install, it tells me packages are not authorized. I tried adding a new sources.list, but even from different sources I get the same 404 errors. Any idea what it could be?

2011-09-23T15:44:00.000Z	Dulcin	ActionParsnip	Yes I did
2011-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	Dulcin	ActionParsnip	I installed it completely last weekend, then wednesday mysql-server wouldn't boot because of a mysql.host missing, then i tried to fix it but, figured I might as well reinstall it, but I couldn't reinstall it anymore
2011-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dulcin	can you web browse to http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/ on the same pc?
2011-09-23T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dulcin	try:  wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/alsa-info.sh; chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh; ./alsa-info.sh
2011-09-23T15:52:00.000Z	Dulcin	ActionParsnip	it seems the problem persists with any sources.list

2011-09-23T15:56:00.000Z	Dulcin	ActionParsnip	Same problem with that sources list, just lots of 404 not found, even though they all are 100% correct
2011-09-23T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dulcin	do you use a proxy?
2011-09-23T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dulcin	then you don't. Strange
2011-09-23T16:01:00.000Z	Dulcin	ActionParsnip	Any more ideas what the problem could be?
2011-09-23T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dulcin	could try a reboot
