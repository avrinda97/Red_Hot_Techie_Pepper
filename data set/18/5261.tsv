2009-01-27T09:17:00.000Z	srx2002		hi guys, quick question....I'm trying to learn some terminal commands...if I open  for example  " amsn "  from the terminal window where exactly is the " executable " ( for lack of a better word ) file located
2009-01-27T09:18:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	/usr/bin, for amsn.
2009-01-27T09:18:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	well, most programs installed from the ubuntu add/remove or synpatic or apt-get are stored in /usr/bin. If you compile your own programs, they're in /usr/local/bin.
2009-01-27T09:20:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	/usr/local/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/bin, /sbin, /bin, /usr/games are where they're stored.
2009-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	Sorry, there is definitely a command, but I've forgotten it. Does anyone else know how to determine where an executable in $PATH is located?
2009-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	firefox is /usr/bin by default.
2009-01-27T09:22:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	hang on, I'll have it for you in a sec
2009-01-27T09:22:00.000Z	srx2002	Peddy	ok thanks
2009-01-27T09:23:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	the command is "type -p firefox"
2009-01-27T09:23:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	replace firefox with any program you want.
2009-01-27T09:26:00.000Z	srx2002	Peddy	If I wanted to prevent someone from using for example MSN while I'm away from my PC...is there a command for that?
2009-01-27T09:27:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	as in block Pidgin from being used entirely?
2009-01-27T09:27:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	block pidgin from being used at a certain time*
2009-01-27T09:29:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	do you mean programs or files?
2009-01-27T09:31:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	you could just make a seperate account for your kids/siblings/parents that doesn't have permission to access those files. Fast user switching is really fast, and you can stay logged in.
2009-01-27T09:32:00.000Z	srx2002	Peddy	good idea...so chmod 000 and 775 won't work for programs i guess
2009-01-27T09:33:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	yes, it would, you just chmod the /usr/bin... file
2009-01-27T09:34:00.000Z	Peddy	srx2002	I don't know the ids of your users, you can do 'sudo nautilus /usr/bin', then right-click on the programs, and set which users can access it. But you should make a new account first.
