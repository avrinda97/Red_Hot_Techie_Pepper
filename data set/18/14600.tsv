2006-01-12T10:15:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	what's that?
2006-01-12T10:15:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	it's a game, based on bungie
2006-01-12T10:20:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	yeah I'm here
2006-01-12T10:22:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	so Aleph One is a game based on Bungie's marathon, and i really like it, but it's not in the apt, and so i had to download some stupid rpm witch doesn't work, so i'd really like to have it in apt.
2006-01-12T10:23:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	so bug the developers to get it in
2006-04-01T16:44:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	that wont work
2006-04-01T16:45:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	why not?
2006-04-01T16:45:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	windows batch files are very different from bash scripts
2006-04-01T16:45:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	they don't work in linux
2006-04-01T16:45:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	yes that's why i'm trying to change it
2006-04-01T16:45:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	you need to revrite it completely
2006-04-01T16:46:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	about nothing from the batch file will work in linux. you might as well write a new script from scratch
2006-04-01T16:47:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	ok
2006-04-01T16:47:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	don't worry. you can't know what you don't know
2006-04-01T16:49:00.000Z	mwe	VincentMX	the name is xubuntu-destop IIRC
2006-04-01T16:49:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	ok
2006-04-01T16:50:00.000Z	VincentMX	mwe	i think i'm going to write the base program first, then i'll add the other funtions
