2009-10-25T13:11:00.000Z	jvainio		Hey is there any way to add Fiji to the timezones in Gnome???
2009-10-25T13:11:00.000Z	jvainio		I think Fiji is a wellknown country
2009-10-25T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		why it isn't there in the timezones?
2009-10-25T13:12:00.000Z	jvainio		weird.
2009-10-25T13:13:00.000Z	wgrant	jvainio	The timezone is Pacific/Fiji.
2009-10-25T13:13:00.000Z	jvainio		i think it is -1
2009-10-25T13:14:00.000Z	wgrant	jvainio	Is it not listed?
2009-10-25T13:14:00.000Z	jvainio		no it isn't
2009-10-25T13:14:00.000Z	wgrant	jvainio	Where are you looking?
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio	wgrant	click the clock. go to locations. try to type in Fiji. nothing.
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	wgrant	jvainio	Try a city.
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	wgrant	jvainio	Otherwise, select the timezone manually (Pacific -> Fiji)
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio	wgrant	Doesn't know the capital, suva
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio		or the 2nd largest, lautoka
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio		or the oturist gateway, nadi
2009-10-25T13:15:00.000Z	jvainio		or vanua levus 2nd largest, savusavu
2009-10-25T13:16:00.000Z	wgrant	jvainio	Indeed, seems not :( Enter it manually, I guess.
2009-10-25T13:17:00.000Z	jvainio	wgrant	yeah i got it. thanks for your help!
