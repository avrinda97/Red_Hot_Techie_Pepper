2009-03-09T23:39:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	you're on a subnet, configure your router to forward the port to that box
2009-03-09T23:40:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	I did, just like i did for port 80, 21, etc. they all work except 3784
2009-03-09T23:41:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	any iptables blocking it? sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log and watch for any errors
2009-03-09T23:50:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	I just checked if my server is 'up' from ventrilo.com, it says it's fine, but i still can't connect to it
2009-03-09T23:51:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	does netstat -tunap from terminal show that port as listening/open?
2009-03-09T23:52:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	yes
2009-03-09T23:53:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	what error do they get?
2009-03-09T23:53:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	"MSG: Contacting server." and stays there
2009-03-09T23:54:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	can we go to PM and I'll tell you the info, maybe you can understand better that way?
2009-03-09T23:54:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	your logs should show the error, i'm not familiar with ventrilo
2009-03-09T23:54:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	the tail -f etc. stuff you told me didn't show anything
2009-03-09T23:55:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	what i don't understand is that, I can login to it locally, I can telnet to it from outside, even ventrilo.com can know the status of my server, yet for some weird reason, outside people can't get in
2009-03-09T23:56:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	tail -f reads in real time, watch it as you invoke the error
2009-03-09T23:56:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	the error is not being outputted on server side, it's like messages aren't even reaching it
2009-03-09T23:57:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	you don't seem to be getting an error, just no connection, is ventrilo configured right?
2009-03-09T23:57:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	it worked out of nowhere just now, i didn't even change anything
2009-03-09T23:58:00.000Z	bigrigger	Daremonai	well. sweet. probably a constipated port ;p
2009-03-09T23:59:00.000Z	Daremonai	bigrigger	hehe :)
