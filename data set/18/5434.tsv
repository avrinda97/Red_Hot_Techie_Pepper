2008-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	wsa		welllll wait a minute does this box have a static ip jim_p?
2008-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	wsa		dhcpcd should populate resolv.conf with nameservers automagically . . .
2008-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	i need to set my isps dns servers and i use static ip on my lan
2008-10-25T10:56:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	this may be overkill for you, but i might recommend running tinydns or dnsmasq on your router, naming your isps nameservers as nexthops, and doing static leases
2008-10-25T10:57:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	kill me as in...? i use static ip on my lan, and i simply set my isps dns servers there and i am fine. this pc i am on now has all this and its working perfectly
2008-10-25T10:59:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	dynamically from the isp? i get a new ip almost daily
2008-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	no I just mean the box in question -- from the router -- like i said it might be overkill -- if your configuration is static you can just edit resolv.conf
2008-10-25T11:23:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	i think its better to install debian since its a server
2008-10-25T11:23:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	mind if i ask about its duties?
2008-10-25T11:26:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	of course, it is a layer-3 router for a very small lan, offering dhcp, dns, ntp, and some file shares and a local cvs repository, also it offers smtp, imap, pop3, and http to the wan (oh and ntp too)
2008-10-25T11:26:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	simply wow! better use debian
2008-10-25T11:44:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	well it's like I don't know gentoo on the desktop with encrypted disks is a PITA and so I am thinking of ubuntu there and have this preference that everything is the same
2008-10-25T11:45:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	I don't think I would switch to debian
2008-10-25T11:46:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	in a pita? so you dunp debian server for ubuntu server?!
2008-10-25T11:48:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	that server runs gentoo now, i'm considering switching to ubuntu server
2008-10-25T11:48:00.000Z	wsa	jim_p	because i want everything to be the same, and gentoo on a desktop is a painful (but rewarding) experience
2008-10-25T11:49:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	so you need a desktop too? try debian lenny then
2008-10-25T11:51:00.000Z	jim_p	wsa	i suggest lenny, because etch packages are like... as ancient as the parthenon
