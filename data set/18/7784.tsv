2008-08-10T07:56:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	.. why not use just pppoe that comes with ubuntu?
2008-08-10T07:58:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	well pppoe is broadband.. adsl usualy... pppoeconfig is quite easy to use
2008-08-10T07:58:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	and menu driven.
2008-08-10T07:59:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	Open a terminal and type sudo pppoeconfig
2008-08-10T07:59:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	answer the questions and your ready.
2008-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	To go online: sudo pon dsl-provider
2008-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	To go offline: sudo poff
2008-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	to view the log of the connection: plog
2008-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	schmick	Silent123	nope.. type exactly dsl-provider, that is the name that pppoeconfig assigns the connection file.
