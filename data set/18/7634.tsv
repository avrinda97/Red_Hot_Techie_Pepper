2007-12-10T21:21:00.000Z	gradin		i got a weird one, for some reason my ubuntu box stopped responding to pings to the localhostname
2007-12-10T21:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	ping localhost ?
2007-12-10T21:22:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	more like ping tiger
2007-12-10T21:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	use localhost instead of the hostname
2007-12-10T21:22:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	yeah that works fine
2007-12-10T21:23:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	the problem is the other computers aren't able to ping the hostname
2007-12-10T21:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	you need a dns for that i think, or else edit your /etc/hosts file and put them in there manually
2007-12-10T21:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	ive never had luck with name resolution, ive always done it manually, and my router at home has static dhcp, so each mac address gets the same ip each time
2007-12-10T21:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	whats the issue? its not resolving the hostname to the ip, or ip to hostname, whichever way, i know little about networking
2007-12-10T21:26:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	the ip is set statically, but the hostname isn't resolving properly
2007-12-10T21:27:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	edit your /etc/hosts file and put an entry in there for your hosts
2007-12-10T21:28:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	thats not the issue
2007-12-10T21:28:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	it recognizes it self as the proper hostname
2007-12-10T21:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	look at that file, its probably already set in there for 127.0.0.1 to be your hostname
2007-12-10T21:32:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	the issue is the other computers on the network aren't resolving its hostname properly
2007-12-10T21:32:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	stop bugging me about it if you arent giong to try my advice
2007-12-10T21:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	gradin	its how all my machines are set up, it works for me it will work for you, i can almost guarentee it
2007-12-10T21:34:00.000Z	gradin	MasterShrek_	half my computers are linux and the other half are windows, your telling me to maually edit the hosts files to point an ip to a hostname that should be broadcast by the specific linux box already?
