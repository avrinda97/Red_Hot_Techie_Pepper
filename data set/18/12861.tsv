2006-02-28T11:00:00.000Z	Organs		Would this be the place to ask how to mount a CD drive so I can burn my ubunu image?
2006-02-28T11:00:00.000Z	Organs		*ubuntu image
2006-02-28T11:01:00.000Z	Organs		(And yes, I'm new to linux.  About 72 hours new)
2006-02-28T11:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	Organs	which OS are you trying to burn in?
2006-02-28T11:01:00.000Z	Organs		I'm in another distro of linux (cAos)
2006-02-28T11:02:00.000Z	Organs		GNOME is my specific GUI as of now.
2006-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Organs	Nautilus can burn ISOs in Gnome - find your ISO file, right click, select "Burn To Disc"
2006-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	Organs		First off, I need to mount the disc.
2006-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	Organs		And I've got GnomeBaker, so I can burn just fine.
2006-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	Organs		I need to mount the drive more than anything else.
2006-02-28T11:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	Organs	your burner doesn't automount when you put a CD in it?
2006-02-28T11:04:00.000Z	Organs		Nope.  Perhaps a problem then?  Lemmie see if I can get an error readout from somewhere.
2006-02-28T11:05:00.000Z	Organs	Madpilot	how would I manually mount the drive?
2006-02-28T11:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Organs	I've never had to do that (yet), so I"m not at all sure. Try reading "man mount" in a terminal
2006-02-28T11:07:00.000Z	Organs		sounds....fun.
2006-02-28T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Organs	I've mounted harddrives, but not optical drives, so I'm not sure if they're mounted the same way
2006-02-28T11:09:00.000Z	Organs		'kay, thanks Madpilot
2006-02-28T11:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Organs	hang around here and ask again later, or check ubuntuforums.org
