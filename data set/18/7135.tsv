2010-03-19T02:26:00.000Z	danopia	RaverWild	do acers have known wifi instability?
2010-03-19T02:27:00.000Z	danopia		because mine is terrible on some networks
2010-03-19T02:27:00.000Z	RaverWild	danopia	looks so
2010-03-19T02:27:00.000Z	danopia	RaverWild	any tips on making it more stable?
2010-03-19T02:27:00.000Z	danopia		at school i normally end up under win7 or with a patch cable
2010-03-19T02:28:00.000Z	RaverWild	danopia	if i has any idea i would make my connect now. my wifi works, but it dont want to connect to my wifi network. seems it does not accept my key
2010-03-19T02:28:00.000Z	danopia	RaverWild	for me it works but half the time it stops communicating and builds up a packet buffer
2010-03-19T02:28:00.000Z	danopia		then after liek half a minute everything is transfered again and it works for 30 seconds
2010-03-19T02:29:00.000Z	danopia	RaverWild	it gets extremely annoying so i use ethernet when possible, it happens under WEP at home but also on an unprotected network at school
2010-03-19T02:29:00.000Z	danopia		and it's only sometimes
2010-03-19T02:29:00.000Z	RaverWild	danopia	same here. yesterday i left it to download and went out. when i came back it disconnected from the home wifi network and since then it wont accept my password :(((((((((
2010-03-19T02:30:00.000Z	danopia	RaverWild	sometimes it takes it an huor to fetch 5 new packages
2010-03-19T02:30:00.000Z	RaverWild	danopia	i have win xp on the same machine but what is the point of ubuntu then. this must be fixed
2010-03-19T02:30:00.000Z	danopia		because it drops so often
2010-03-19T02:30:00.000Z	danopia		i have win7 with ubuntu installed via wubi
2010-03-19T02:31:00.000Z	RaverWild	danopia	Acer Aspire One laptop here. yes i did. i restarted the whole router and the laptop, tried win xp = no problem. back on ubuntu - problem
