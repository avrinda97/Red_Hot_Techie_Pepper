2007-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	perhaps samba isn't configured yet? just a guess..
2007-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	I mean..the samba server part
2007-01-09T10:19:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	oh.. then I don't know.. although I do get the same error when trying to share a directory
2007-01-09T10:19:00.000Z	kanzie	Slart	 hmm... this is really fishy, have we encountered a ripe bug here
2007-01-09T10:20:00.000Z	kanzie	Slart	through Shared folders in system you can do it
2007-01-09T10:21:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	ok, checking
2007-01-09T10:24:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	hmm.. yes.. using the menu-thingy I can share a folder.. but right clicking on a folder in nautilus gives me that error... annying
2007-05-25T16:58:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	ask the people in #winehq ,they might have an answer
2007-05-25T16:58:00.000Z	kanzie	Slart	thanks
2007-09-27T09:33:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	try safe mode.. I think it's firefox -safe or something similar
2010-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	broadcast address is something else.. check the routing tables
2010-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	if you're looking for the external ip on your network there is sites like http://whatismyip.com
2010-06-21T14:41:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	replace "gunzip -d {}" with "rm {}"  . You might want some extra switches with that in case it wants confirmation for each delete
2010-06-21T14:41:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	{} is the placeholder for the filename
2010-06-21T14:41:00.000Z	kanzie	Slart	thanks
2010-06-21T14:42:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	hmm.. come to think of it.. I'm not sure what the -execdir  switch does.. I think I've always used just -exec.. check the man page to make sure it's not doing something weird
2010-06-21T14:43:00.000Z	kanzie	Slart	its just that it runs from the subdir where the found file is
2010-06-21T14:44:00.000Z	Slart	kanzie	unop: ah.. every day you learn something new =) Thanks!
