2008-01-26T21:14:00.000Z	bkar		incorrect-> isnt it openssl has those tools?
2008-01-26T21:15:00.000Z	bkar		Jatz-> having /tmp at 1mb will certainly not work
2008-01-26T21:15:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	I know
2008-01-26T21:17:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	it's long, should I paste it all?
2008-01-26T21:17:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	what did that do?
2008-01-26T21:18:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	okay
2008-01-26T21:20:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53584/
2008-01-26T21:22:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	it was working fine before
2008-01-26T21:22:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	could it be qdvdauthor? when I used it I had to select /tmp for something
2008-01-26T21:22:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	overflow? how did I load it? I have no Idea.
2008-01-26T21:23:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	so how do I fix it?
2008-01-26T21:26:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	so do I have to kill /tmp and remake it or is my install ruined?
2008-01-26T21:27:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	I already removed it
2008-01-26T21:29:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	umount: /tmp is not in the fstab (and you are not root)
2008-01-26T21:29:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	umount: /tmp: device is busy
2008-01-26T21:32:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	I should really kill it all?
2008-01-26T21:32:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	I just dont want to break something
2008-01-26T21:33:00.000Z	Jatz	bkar	alright
