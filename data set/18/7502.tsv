2008-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	Nigel		one last question
2008-07-17T07:12:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	shoot
2008-07-17T07:10:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	yes..... but its minimal... nothing advanced can be done via the wubi installer
2008-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	no problem... good luck
2008-07-17T07:13:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	what versions do you have?
2008-07-17T07:14:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	i dont think wubi is available for 6.06...... not sure about 7.06
2008-07-17T07:14:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	i know it is for the latest 8.04
2008-07-17T07:15:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	looking
2008-07-17T07:15:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	i would recommend getting the latest... although there are 2 ways to use wubi
2008-07-17T07:16:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	you can download the iso or get the installer
2008-07-17T07:17:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	how big is the hard drive and what is the purpose of the install?
2008-07-17T07:19:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	I would use at least 20G
2008-07-17T07:20:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	Nigel	no prob, you 2
