2011-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	republic		I have lucid lynx. I am using a cellphone card as a modem(by using HSDPA modem), is there any software in ubuntu which I can use to make texting while using the card?
2011-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	republic		the modem has its windows software to do that, but I want to do it in ubuntu
2011-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Do what, exactly?
2011-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	texting
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	sending text(sms)
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	I see, just a second, I saw a software for that
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	thanks
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Check Wammu (CLI) and Gammu (GUI)
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	very nice. thank you very much
2011-11-30T12:06:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	wow, I do not think that in ubuntu there is such software :D
2011-11-30T12:07:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	You mean it's not in the repos?
2011-11-30T12:07:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Oh
2011-11-30T12:13:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Good choice xD
2011-11-30T12:13:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Also, Gammu/Wammu are also available for Windows, so you can use those in case your built-in modem's software is broken (like it was for me)
2011-11-30T12:14:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	I do not use windows. but the software for the modem is provided for windows only. that is why I need the software replacement for ubuntu
2011-11-30T12:14:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Makes sense.
2011-11-30T12:15:00.000Z	republic	theadmin	in fact, I have to use usb_modeswitch each time I want to use the modem because it is only detected as a storage
2011-11-30T12:16:00.000Z	theadmin	republic	Have you tried writing an udev rule to automate that?
