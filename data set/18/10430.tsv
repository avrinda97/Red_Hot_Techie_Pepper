2006-12-23T07:25:00.000Z	stepanstas		i rebooted my os and (i have multi boot with windows and ubuntu) the windows was replaced by ubuntu (all three things were added inplace of the windows), how can i get it back
2006-12-23T07:26:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	: if all else failes, you can overwrite grub by using the xp install cd, chosing repait, and then fixing the master boot record
2006-12-23T07:26:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	windows is not an option, it was replaced
2006-12-23T07:27:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	: replaced, or just not in grub as an option?
2006-12-23T07:27:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	i guess not an option, well, i know its still in the system because i did not format, but..
2006-12-23T07:28:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	this was my order: windows, ubuntu:(just a name, had no function, then the three ubuntu things (generic....
2006-12-23T07:28:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	: so you can do what i said earlier, all you need is the xp cd
2006-12-23T07:28:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	: but then you would lose ubuntu
2006-12-23T07:29:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	and now its the three ubuntus, Ubuntu: (just the name, no function) and again the three ubuntus,
2006-12-23T07:32:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	is the windows cd my only option?
2006-12-23T07:36:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	do you have xp on your computer to?
2006-12-23T07:36:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	no
2006-12-23T07:37:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	do you think that copying the text that another person has to my menu.lst would work?
2006-12-23T07:37:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	i dont know, ive never manually configured grub
2006-12-23T07:38:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	is ubuntu a new isntallation? or do you really want to keep it/
2006-12-23T07:41:00.000Z	emilia	stepanstas	its happened to me, what i did was boot the xp cd, choose repair, then type fixmbr, itll overwrite grub, and you can boot to xp
2006-12-23T07:43:00.000Z	stepanstas	emilia	i would like repairing xp to be my last resort
