2008-11-01T15:36:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	activate it
2008-11-01T15:37:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	i did, but after it completes it says that they arent activated
2008-11-01T15:37:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	did it install them?
2008-11-01T15:37:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	after you install the new video driver you have to reboot
2008-11-01T15:38:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	I had trouble getting them installed as well... one sec, let me look somewhere else...
2008-11-01T15:38:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	cool thanks
2008-11-01T15:39:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	how you getting to hardware drivers?
2008-11-01T15:39:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	system -> admin -> hardware drivers
2008-11-01T15:41:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	don't know why this made a difference for me, but go to add/remove -> All available -> search nvidia, then select Hardware drivers and nvidia X server settings. THAT is where I finally got tehm to install but some of it looked the same as the other way..... but they installed
2008-11-01T15:42:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	cool thanks, just noticed something else in the authorizations app, i cant update grants or anything now, wonder is there something messed up there
2008-11-01T15:42:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	not sure on that one
2008-11-01T15:43:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	might be the cause of not being able to enable drivers
2008-11-01T15:45:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	can you try something
2008-11-01T15:48:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	gonna try this reboot again!
2008-11-01T15:49:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	thanks for the help
2008-11-01T16:16:00.000Z	eoghan	reiki	i have returned
2008-11-01T16:18:00.000Z	reiki	eoghan	how'd it go?
