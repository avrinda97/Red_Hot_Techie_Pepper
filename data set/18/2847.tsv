2011-04-07T18:49:00.000Z	mordof		Is Wubi an in-windows install, basically it's own VM? if so - how reliably does it work / recieve updates?  I'd like to run ubuntu from a VM instead of a standalone OS but i'm wondering about performance issues and whatnot
2011-04-07T18:50:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	it uses a file as a hard drive, it's as native as a partitioned install; except with the added overhead of 2 filesystems
2011-04-07T18:54:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	it will boot instead of windows; the only thing in common is where the files are stored
2011-04-07T18:56:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	which can help if you can't decide or don't know up front how much space you want/need for each
2011-04-07T18:58:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	that was never the case
2011-04-29T04:56:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	is grub doing it or is it a busybox prompt?
2011-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	what's a busybox prompt? lol
2011-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	if it doesn't say busybox don't worry about it
2011-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	ok, then i guess it's not that.
2011-04-29T07:32:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	i have the nouvou driver or w/e installed.. i'm not sure which it's using
2011-04-29T07:29:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	what would one look for in glxinfo?
2011-04-29T07:29:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	i'm also wondering about the driver since i'm in the same situation
2011-04-29T07:29:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	look at the vendor string, it should signal rather clearly if it's the proprietary or nouveau driver
2011-04-29T07:29:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	NVIDIA Corporation
2011-04-29T07:33:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	if it says nvidia corporation it's the proprietary driver
2011-04-29T07:33:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	k.. that's annoying, i'm getting slow response on desktop applications
2011-04-29T08:25:00.000Z	ohsix	mordof	only if you enable the extra repos
2011-04-29T08:25:00.000Z	mordof	ohsix	i forgot i did that xD
