2006-11-25T06:09:00.000Z	Gertoly		Does anybody know if you can connect 2 ide2usb cables together to just basically get around using a really long ide ribbon?
2006-11-25T06:09:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	not possible
2006-11-25T06:10:00.000Z	Gertoly	sn9	you know of something that could do something like that? Otherwise i'm looking at a 7 feet ribbon (which i know would have issues)
2006-11-25T06:11:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	if you need to connect a hard disk over seven feet, don't use ide
2006-11-25T06:11:00.000Z	Gertoly	sn9	use what then?
2006-11-25T06:11:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	what is your motherboard equipped with?
2006-11-25T06:12:00.000Z	Gertoly		i only have ide on the mobo, well usb2.0 (no sata)
2006-11-25T06:12:00.000Z	Gertoly		or scsi
2006-11-25T06:12:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	then use the usb2
2006-11-25T06:13:00.000Z	Gertoly		sorry, it's usb1.1 actually (forgot that)
2006-11-25T06:13:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	no slots?
2006-11-25T06:13:00.000Z	Gertoly		where on earth to you get a high speed ribbon at in bulk where one can mount their own heads?
2006-11-25T06:14:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	do you have available pci slots?
2006-11-25T06:14:00.000Z	Gertoly	sn9	yeah i got slots, to buy a usb io card right...that's last resort. Really, i was just wondering about the cheap hack i was talking about.
2006-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	Gertoly		i guess you need some sort of software to do that hack, not just hardware
2006-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	get yourself as cheap a 1394 card (not usb) as you can. best you can do
2006-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	Gertoly		yeh, thanks
2006-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	sn9	Gertoly	no, the hardware will not physically allow it
