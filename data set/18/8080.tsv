2007-10-04T11:54:00.000Z	dmagno	_2	I'm back!
2007-10-04T11:54:00.000Z	dmagno		I reconfigured the xserver using my monitors manual as reference and that not workd at all
2007-10-04T11:55:00.000Z	_2	dmagno	ok.   working or no ?
2007-10-04T11:55:00.000Z	dmagno		i'm trying to put that nvidia card working for 4 months
2007-10-04T11:56:00.000Z	_2	dmagno	so try again.  different settings.   when you get it right then it will work.    and you can use the "vesa" driver if needed to get it up and running.    i can't really help you with the nvidia driver particularly though
2007-10-04T11:57:00.000Z	dmagno		ok I understand
2007-10-04T11:57:00.000Z	dmagno		I don't know whatelse to change in xserver config
2007-10-04T11:58:00.000Z	dmagno		I'm intrigated with this issue cause the nvidia driver had worked with another debian distro
2007-10-04T11:58:00.000Z	_2	dmagno	the monitor,  use the middle selection not advanced not simple and get as close as possable to what you know yours is.  that should give a "usable" range.
2007-10-04T12:00:00.000Z	dmagno	_2	ok I'll try your suggestion but now I need to sleep :-)
2007-10-04T12:00:00.000Z	_2	dmagno	it is also possable that the fbcon module is interfeering eith the vidio driver
2007-10-04T12:00:00.000Z	dmagno		I'm very thankfull for you help
2007-10-04T12:00:00.000Z	dmagno		I'll also investigate the fcon module for sure
2007-10-04T12:00:00.000Z	_2		you can try booting with "nosplash"  on the kernel line and see if it helps.
2007-10-04T12:01:00.000Z	_2	dmagno	it's fbcon   frame buffer console  driver.   provides the mechenism for usplash
2007-10-04T12:01:00.000Z	dmagno	_2	ok I'll study this module
2007-10-04T12:02:00.000Z	dmagno		thanx for your help!
2007-10-04T12:02:00.000Z	_2	dmagno	luck with it.
