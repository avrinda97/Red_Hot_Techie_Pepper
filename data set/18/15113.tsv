2007-11-19T01:09:00.000Z	ompaul	hussam	no - that would take a lot of space - please read the urls I am beginning to think you are trolling and you really don't want me to think that
2007-11-19T01:14:00.000Z	ompaul	hussam	so go to that url and get the minimal install or else take a desktop option from www.ubuntu.com
2007-11-19T01:15:00.000Z	hussam	ompaul	i would download the minimal install if i knoew how to text install
2007-11-19T01:15:00.000Z	ompaul	hussam	you can go to www.ubuntu.com and click on download and work from there tell us when you have it downloaded
2007-11-19T01:17:00.000Z	ompaul	hussam	it is not hard to use - you just have to make a decision before you start -- make sure you are ready to do the full install tell us when you have the disk downloaded, I'll have the bot message you the install instructions
2007-11-19T01:22:00.000Z	ompaul	hussam	better to hit www.ubuntu.com
2007-11-19T01:23:00.000Z	hussam	ompaul	i am there i click there its directly download iso
2007-11-19T01:23:00.000Z	ompaul	hussam	yes
