2005-05-24T14:58:00.000Z	Nabiki		Is there a way to uninstall grub from the master boot record? :)
2005-05-24T15:00:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nabiki	- there probably is a bettr way to do this but, i use the "dd" command dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/YOUR_DRIVE   (please google this for settings to match what you want to do.)
2005-05-24T15:00:00.000Z	Nabiki		And recently a fat32 partition on the disk that /root is on went to hell....  If it was a software issue, all is good.. Ifit was hardware, then I need to get that drive outa the boot loop before it dies for real.
2005-05-24T15:01:00.000Z	IIIEars		YES BE VERY CAREFUL!
2005-05-24T15:01:00.000Z	Nabiki		If I could get a copy of WinXP Home SP 2, for like 6 minutes, I could have it all fixed. :P But all anyone has are those damned recovery disks. Hehehehehe
2005-05-24T15:01:00.000Z	IIIEars		lol - after 3 weeks i know just enough to be dangerous
2005-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	Nabiki		rewrite the MBR...
2005-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	IIIEars		you should see what a newb like me can do with file permissions. - lol
2005-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	Nabiki		Thanks to grub, if that happens, my system will be a paperweight with anything shortof a low level format and reinstall of everything.
2005-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	Nabiki		Because, if I can rewerite it to where it only looks at windows, it will not require the second drive to boot propperly.
2005-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	Nabiki		because grub wrote to the master boot record, to look at data on the second physical drive.
2005-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nabiki	- If you get into trouble (and i have already) try Helix Linux to rescue any files.
2005-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	Nabiki		:P  See... I got myself in a jam becauseo f windows. :P hehehe
2005-05-24T15:05:00.000Z	Nabiki		Last time I ran into an issue where it couldn't read the config files, I had to use the rescue disk. ^_^
2005-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	Nabiki		I think the version of grub I have is a little retarded!  ^^;; I like lilo better anyway *pouts*
2005-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	Nabiki		Lilo writes EVERYTHING to the boot record. :P so if one drive dies, you just get an error when you try to access it.^^:;
2005-05-24T15:07:00.000Z	Nabiki	mypapit	Lilo's uninstall is more like an undo than an uninstall.  Means that if you change it twice, you can't go back to the first.
2005-05-24T15:07:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nabiki	- lol - lilo is scarey - it can turn your display into a stream of flowing zeros if the disk isn't handled correctly.
