2006-02-28T12:10:00.000Z	joels		Hi. I just installed ubuntu and I'm trying to figure out how to install zlib with apt-get.
2006-02-28T12:11:00.000Z	joels		I don't have X11 installed. I don't want to use Synaptic or whatever it's called.
2006-02-28T12:12:00.000Z	joels		I see that :)
2006-02-28T12:13:00.000Z	joels		it seems that zlibc was what I needed
2006-02-28T12:13:00.000Z	joels		I've never used a debian-based distribution before, so this apt stuff is new to me
2006-02-28T12:13:00.000Z	hobbs	joels	not likely
2006-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	hobbs	joels	'zlib1g' is most likely
2006-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	joels	hobbs	that one's already installed.
2006-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	joels		configure: error: "no zlib found"
2006-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	joels		 - I'm just trying to make this go away
2006-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	hobbs	joels	oh. You're trying to link against it
2006-02-28T12:15:00.000Z	hobbs	joels	zlib1g-dev
2006-02-28T12:15:00.000Z	joels		Ah, excellent.
2006-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	hobbs	joels	when you want to compile something against a given library, you need the version from a package ending in -dev
2006-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	joels		hmm, should I stick '-dev' on the end of eveyrhing i wanna link against?
2006-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	joels		ah, you answered before I asked.
2006-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	joels		haha
2006-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	hobbs	joels	usually it's libfoo-dev, but zlib is oh so very ancient and special :)
