2011-02-06T05:16:00.000Z	hobbes		Does unetbootin need enough space on the OS drive to process the transfer?
2011-02-06T05:17:00.000Z	hobbes		WinXP
2011-02-06T05:18:00.000Z	hobbes		The situation is, I have a very very old crappy borrowed PC, and a new PC with almost all the parts I need. I need a OS for my new PC.
2011-02-06T05:19:00.000Z	hobbes		This ancient PC lacks a burning drive, and has very crowded tiny hard drives
2011-02-06T05:19:00.000Z	hobbes		Well, the linux is for the new PC, not the old one, I just need to get it to the new one
2011-02-06T05:21:00.000Z	hobbes		So unetbootin doesn't turn the flash drive into a phantom DVD image where the rest of the space disappears then, right?
2011-02-06T05:23:00.000Z	hobbes		Lexvegas: and the unitbootin process doesn't delete any data or require a empty USB flash, right?
2011-02-06T05:25:00.000Z	hobbes		POST beeps (if PC speakers are plugged in) are the primary way to diagnose major system problems
2011-02-06T05:25:00.000Z	hobbes		Lexvegas: Well if your not positive
2011-02-06T05:26:00.000Z	hobbes		Another issue though, doesn't the OS drive need X amount of temporary space to process the unetbootin conversion process?
2011-02-06T05:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hobbes	GRUB2 can allow you to boot from an iso that's already on the flash drive.
2011-02-06T05:30:00.000Z	hobbes	Jordan_U	I didn't fully understand what you mean
2011-02-06T05:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hobbes	GRUB2 is a bootloader. You can install GRUB2 to a flash drive and manually configure it to boot from an Ubuntu iso file on that same flash drive (without needing to extract or do anything else to the iso).
2011-02-06T05:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hobbes	It is much more work than tools like unetbootin, but it doesn't require copying / modification of the contents of the iso itself.
2011-02-06T05:33:00.000Z	hobbes	Jordan_U	How is it more work? Any other catches?
2011-02-06T05:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hobbes	It's more work because it's not a nice GUI designed specifically for the purpose. You need to use terminal commands and text configuration files to set it up.
2011-02-06T05:35:00.000Z	hobbes	Jordan_U	Hmm, I have never ever used linux before though, that sounds a bit scary.
2011-02-06T05:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hobbes	Indeed, it's probably not something you want to do as a beginner.
