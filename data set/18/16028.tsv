2005-01-21T14:57:00.000Z	will_		tolstoy: have you tried the nvidia drivers in apt-get?
2005-01-21T14:58:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	yes.  you're talking the "restricted-modules" right?
2005-01-21T15:00:00.000Z	will_	tolstoy-	did it work?
2005-01-21T15:00:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	installing the requisite packages didn't work.
2005-01-21T15:01:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	the kernel mod is there, but I get an "Invalid module format" for the nvidia.ko file located in the 2.6.10-1 module tree.
2005-01-21T15:02:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	guess I'd have to reboot to 2.6.9 to do that.  Is synaptic better than apt-get dist-upgrade?
2005-01-21T15:02:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	I didn't build the kernel or the restricted-modules.
2005-01-21T15:03:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	I didn't build 'em.  Just installed the latest hoary packages.
2005-01-21T15:04:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	I wonder if there's a packaging mismatch.
2005-01-21T15:04:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	When I dpkg -l for restricted, the 2.6.10-1 restricted-modules mentions something about 2.6.10-3.
2005-01-21T15:04:00.000Z	will_	tolstoy-	i used the ubuntu unoficcial starter guide to install the nvidia drivers, then ound them useless once i upgraded the kernel, not wanting to reinstall the nvidia everytime i upgrade the kernel i just used the available ones in apt-get
2005-01-21T15:05:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	that's what I'm doing as well.
2005-01-21T15:08:00.000Z	will_	tolstoy-	http://ubuntuguide.org/index.html#installnvidiadriver
2005-01-21T15:10:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	I've done those things.  I think there's not a compatible nvidia kernel driver for hoary and the 2.6.10-4 kernel.
2005-01-21T15:13:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	:)  yeah, so this all isn't a complaint about quality, just want to make sure I'm doing something worth reporting as a bug.
2005-01-21T15:15:00.000Z	will_	tolstoy-	if you want my advice, dont use hoary unless you want to test / develop & help, it simply is not read yet. reinstall warty for 'everything works' and maybe have a test machine with hoary on
2005-01-21T15:16:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	i agree with that, but I also like to help, even if just a little.
2005-01-21T15:16:00.000Z	tolstoy-	will_	so I'm using hoary with eyes open.
