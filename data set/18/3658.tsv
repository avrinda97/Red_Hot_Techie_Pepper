2009-10-21T20:23:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Firefox just updated and now the menus are missing.  ff is not in full screen mode (F11) I tried that...  Any ideas how to retrieve?
2009-10-21T20:23:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	Right-click on the toolbar and check "Navigation Toolbar"
2009-10-21T20:24:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Terces	I do not have a toolbar.  I only have the window title bar and the body of the web page, no nav or links etc...
2009-10-21T20:25:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	Have you tried logging out of all sessions (or rebooting) yet?
2009-10-21T20:27:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Terces	I closed all sessions and restarted, but not reboot
2009-10-21T20:28:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	There's a more drastic approach, which is deleting your settings manually
2009-10-21T20:28:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	Do you want to do that?
2009-10-21T20:29:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	You can move your settings temporarily and then put them back too.
2009-10-21T20:29:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Terces	you mean move .mozilla/firefox/myProfile.default ?
2009-10-21T20:30:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	Yep.
2009-10-21T20:33:00.000Z	JuJuBee		ls
2009-10-21T20:33:00.000Z	JuJuBee		sry
2009-10-21T20:34:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Terces	 so now I have to reinstall all of my add-ons ?
2009-10-21T20:35:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	That's why I said it was an extreme solution...
2009-10-21T20:35:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	There's probably one specific file in the profile that you could delete to reset the GUI, but I don't know which one that is.
2009-10-21T20:36:00.000Z	Terces	JuJuBee	Did you know there was a safe-mode? "firefox -safe-mode" works sometimes
2009-10-21T20:39:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Terces	 Tried resetting toolbars etc... If I continue in safe mode, all is good (minus the add-ons) but if I try to make changes and restart, I get same problem... :(
2009-10-21T20:44:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Terces	 well, easier I guess to start fresh... I use xmarks anyway so not much trouble...
