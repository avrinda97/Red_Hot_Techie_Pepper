2010-05-02T16:44:00.000Z	artisan		network-manager does not consider to handle eth0, how do I convince it?

2010-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	YOu want to undervolt your laptop?
2010-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	artisan	minimec	not necessarily. why?
2010-05-02T16:48:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	I was just curious... I fyou load another (older) kernel?
2010-05-02T16:49:00.000Z	artisan	minimec	nope. it is a completely fresh install from alternate.
2010-05-02T16:51:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	As I understand, this is a regression, as probably it worked with previous version. I would first try an older kernel version (install an older kenrel), or even give a ekrnerl series like 2.6.33 a try. See if the problem persists.
2010-05-02T16:54:00.000Z	artisan	minimec	does that mean it is a kernel bug then?
2010-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	That's what we want to find out, aren't we? ;) Afterwards we can guess, that it is related tu cpufreq.
2010-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	That would be my approach to the problem.
2010-05-02T16:56:00.000Z	artisan	minimec	*sigh* always regressions ... :) lemme see, I have an older updated lappi here, tha actually *can* do scaling
2010-05-02T16:57:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	Hardware is a complex thing ;) --> see win7 *rofl*
2010-05-02T16:59:00.000Z	artisan	minimec	one thing, the installer asked if it should put only machine specific modules in initrd or the whole bunch, I went for the machine specific one, now on boot always it complain there is a moduler misisng, strange but possibly the cuplrit? and: how do I change that behaviour of initramfs?
2010-05-02T17:01:00.000Z	minimec	artisan	I am not really used in using the alternate CD, but if you tried to 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-<foo>', would that give you the possibility again to choose?
2010-05-02T17:02:00.000Z	artisan	minimec	lemme try
