2012-10-04T20:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	asoundconf is no longer used afail , ~/.asoundrc is open to configuration if you need it
2012-10-04T20:43:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	now that I searched for it, I remember having a similar issue in some previous ubuntu version
2012-10-04T21:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	kostkon afaik , ~/.asoundrc has replaced asoundconf
2012-10-04T21:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	which module ?
2012-10-04T21:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	on some bios you disable the onboard audio and choose the pci card in "peripherals" or audiocodec  optional choices , then no blacklist is required , because some upgrades can defeat media balcklists
2012-10-04T21:16:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	oh, good to know! I will check that after reboot later today.
2012-10-04T21:25:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	kostkon: the reason I changed soundcards was very bad sound quality. reading up a bit on that revealed that the onbord sound might be responsible for that.
2012-10-04T21:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	pulseaudio installed I assume
2012-10-04T21:27:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	no, just disabled/blacklisted the onboard sound so far, right now I am checking sound quality with different sources
2012-10-04T21:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	 I'm not a pulseaudio fan , but in some cases such as pci soundcards it's needed to work with website audio like flash/flv embedded files . if you have it then pavucontrol would be a benefit for input and output settings
2012-10-04T21:33:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	i think pulseaudio does a great job now, because it didn't give me any trouble in my previous ubuntu and the quality was not bad
2012-10-04T21:34:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	I am still testing right now but it seems that sound quality is a whole lot better with a real soundcard (sb live!)
2012-10-04T21:35:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	well if you're using the analog output then pulseaudio is another layer of audio processing which degrades the audio quality somewhat , doing 2 digital processes instead of just one thru alsa
2012-10-04T21:36:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	I might be wrong about that but I believe pulseaudio yielded better quality than alsa did on the same machine.
2012-10-04T21:38:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	yes, I meant just plain alsa compared to pulseaudio on top of alsa
2012-10-04T21:40:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	if you like, I can report back to you on how sound is doing here
2012-10-04T21:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jente	personally I use the spdif passthru with pulse using a m-audio pci card as card=0 , to the DAC on an audio amplifier and I also have the onboard audio setup/intel hda and it feeds thru the hdmi out to our tv , altho I don't use that one much
2012-10-04T21:54:00.000Z	jente	BluesKaj	spdif is a dream of mine, but I don't have the hardware for that
