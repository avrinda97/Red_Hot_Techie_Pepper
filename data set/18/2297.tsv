2010-06-24T12:12:00.000Z	ubufool		the ubuntu nvidia drivers are built for ubuntu/linux.. the ones from nvidia webste or others.. usually don't work properly
2010-06-24T12:13:00.000Z	ubufool		i have an nvidia gfx card.. they don't work..it usually doesnt detect properly
2010-06-24T12:13:00.000Z	ubufool		yillid the ones provided for your detected card, are the most stable release ubuntu has built for ubuntu
2010-06-24T12:14:00.000Z	ubufool		often "newest" is not the best and still has bugs that have not been reported to nvidia or ubuntu, and they will continue to work to bring newer ones to us
2010-06-24T12:15:00.000Z	ubufool		indus..when 173.00 first came out, it fried many cards...
2010-06-24T12:15:00.000Z	ubufool		it is now the most stable release provided..
2010-06-24T12:15:00.000Z	ubufool		xD

2010-06-24T11:51:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	how can a cat access the motherboard ??
2010-06-24T11:53:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	 if the urine dries, it might leave deposits maybe :D not sure
2010-06-24T12:14:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	its not necessarily stable
2010-06-24T12:14:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	i mean its stable , but newer ones might fix some bugs
2010-06-24T12:15:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	i used the 173 for a long loing time,
2010-06-24T12:15:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	it worked best for me
2010-06-24T12:16:00.000Z	indus	ubufool	ubuntu doenst change any thing in the driver
2010-06-24T12:16:00.000Z	ubufool	indus	thx to all the testers who knew what to look for and helped debug it...i was one of them
