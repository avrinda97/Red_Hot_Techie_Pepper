2008-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	SonicComKid		I have a 100ft cable running down to my server, and only ONE work station down there with the server. I want the server to share it's network connection with the workstation. The server has two NIC cards
2008-06-13T07:35:00.000Z	SonicComKid		pretty much the server is just shareing information between the NIC cards like a passive switch or HUB
2008-06-13T07:36:00.000Z	SonicComKid		trying to look and keep up with IRC at the same time
2008-06-13T07:38:00.000Z	SonicComKid		that sounds like what I want, thanks guys
2008-06-13T07:40:00.000Z	SonicComKid		This is very newbieish of me, but server edition DOES have a GUI, right?

2008-06-13T07:41:00.000Z	SonicComKid	zcat[1]	it's only console??
2008-06-13T07:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]	SonicComKid	once it's installed it will be on a menu somewhere.. it's not installed by default tho
2008-06-13T07:42:00.000Z	SonicComKid	zcat[1]	how the heck do I enable GUI on it then?
2008-06-13T07:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]	SonicComKid	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
2008-06-13T07:43:00.000Z	SonicComKid	zcat[1]	with that command it'll install Gnome desktop, just like Desktop edition then, right?
2008-06-13T07:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]	SonicComKid	yes..
