2005-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	zoro		oh i meant to ask - does ubuntu5 support the nforce2 chipset by default?
2005-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	Seveas	zoro	sort of...
2005-05-31T12:28:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	yeah i've noticed that myself on a few distros
2005-05-31T12:28:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	i was hoping that it had been sorted :(
2005-05-31T12:28:00.000Z	Seveas	zoro	just modprobe foredeth and you're settled
2005-05-31T12:29:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	well, what i want to do is remote-boot an nforce2 system from a server that's not nforce2 :)
2005-05-31T12:29:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	hence the problems :)
2005-05-31T12:29:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	meh we'll cross the bridge when we get there :)
2005-05-31T12:34:00.000Z	Seveas	zoro	mentioning is allowed, supporting not..
2005-05-31T12:34:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	ah - fair enough
2005-05-31T12:40:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	it's most likely not a k related issue
2005-05-31T12:42:00.000Z	Seveas	zoro	it will install it
2005-05-31T12:42:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	thanks
2005-05-31T12:43:00.000Z	Seveas	zoro	apt-get -d dist-upgrade will only download
2005-05-31T12:43:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	that's fine so :)
2005-05-31T12:45:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	a restart shouldnt be needed iirc
2005-05-31T12:45:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	i _think_ it loads the list every time you access it
2005-05-31T12:45:00.000Z	zoro	Seveas	but i haven't used OOo in a long time
