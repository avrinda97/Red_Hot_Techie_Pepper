2009-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	xorwhy		I cannot get my webcam to work. When I plug it in, nothing happens, I have tried many applications and none seem to work
2009-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	xorwhy		It seems like the camera is not recognized by the system. The model is Intel CS630
2009-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 not all webcams are supported in linux. Theres too many of them  out.
2009-12-14T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 thats is just what the usb device is identifying itslef as.
2010-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 that makes no sence...   McDonolds and other stores/places offer free wifi.
2010-06-20T11:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 ive seen various 'web site scrapers' that can do that.. but never used any.
2010-07-10T01:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 find a PPA for it. or recompile from source is one way to upgrade it
2010-07-10T01:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 wow.. how logical..
2010-07-10T01:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 guess you go look for a PPA for it then.
2010-07-10T01:34:00.000Z	xorwhy	Dr_Willis	This is not the first time this has happened. I am on the PPA page, and some dependency file is downloadable as a .deb, but the binary package itself is nowhere to be found
2010-08-29T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 you mean a normal music cd right?
2010-08-29T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 one normally dosent mount audio cds
2010-08-29T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 you start a music player and let it play them - or rip them to mp3 or whatever
2010-08-29T13:51:00.000Z	xorwhy	Dr_Willis	Surprising then, that the mount function is issued automagically when an audio CD is inserted. I will try opening with a media player.
2010-08-29T13:53:00.000Z	xorwhy	Dr_Willis	Thank you, that worked flawlessly.
2010-08-29T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xorwhy	 a live cd will not be using the nvidia drivers. it will be using the opensources novau (or whateve rits called) drivers
2010-08-29T13:55:00.000Z	xorwhy	Dr_Willis	I think you have myself and another's questions/comments combined.
2010-08-29T13:59:00.000Z	xorwhy	Dr_Willis	My problem is solved. Autoplay functions properly within Nautilus as it issues a mount command and then a load media directory within Nautilus command. It does the same however with audio CD's which is strange, since it clearly detects the media type before issuing the erroneous commands.
