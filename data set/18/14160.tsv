2008-10-08T19:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	if you only get grub> then you're not even past the boot loader.
2008-10-12T21:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	and when you attempt to run that command?
2008-10-12T21:48:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	dpkg
2008-10-12T21:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	are you running on the live cd?
2008-10-12T21:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	It looks to me that you're having a seriously broken system. Have you had a harddisk crash? Are all partitions mounted?
2008-10-12T21:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	Please be patient. I got the link the first time but I am a tad busy researching the quickbooks issue for CaBlGuY
2008-10-12T22:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	Please take me trough what happens when you attempt to boot your system.
2008-10-12T22:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	Is this machine the same one with your linux installation?
2008-10-12T22:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	I see. Well that might be a problem.
2008-10-12T22:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	Hang on while I try to find some way for this to work.
2008-10-12T22:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	Have you got a desktop live cd availible?
2008-10-12T22:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	I see. :/
2008-10-12T22:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	I'm sorry, but I have to pass on solving this issue then. If you get hold of a live cd then I can probably help you diagnose the issue. Other than that I would recomend attempting to re-install the system.
2008-10-12T22:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	...if re-installing is an option that is.
2008-10-12T22:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	I assume that you created a separate partition for /home and that should leave your personal files intact.
2008-10-12T22:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	amanu	Also please take note of any error messages that may occure during installation as that will help us in debugging the issue.
