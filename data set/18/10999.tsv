2012-07-12T18:08:00.000Z	wols	livingdaylight	dpkg --print-architecture is one way
2012-07-12T18:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	wols	thx. is there another - quicker/easier way, too?
2012-07-12T18:10:00.000Z	wols	livingdaylight	what is slow with this way?
2012-07-12T18:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight	wols	you're right
2012-07-12T18:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight	wols	just thought if there is another way that might at the same time give me other interesting stats and facts while i was at it
2012-07-12T18:12:00.000Z	wols	livingdaylight	you could still run a 64bit kernel with 32bit userland. uname -a will tell you
