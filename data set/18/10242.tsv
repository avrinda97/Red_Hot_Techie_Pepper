2006-12-29T13:52:00.000Z	genius314		Can someone help me? Flash can't play any sound.
2006-12-29T13:52:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	That's easy.
2006-12-29T13:52:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	Get the beta plugin. Replace the existing file with the one in the beta version.
2006-12-29T13:52:00.000Z	genius314	pluma	Ok.
2006-12-29T13:53:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	I'm pretty sure there is a tutorial with a link somewhere. I think it's the Flash 9 Beta for Mozilla/Firefox on Linux or something like that.
2006-12-29T13:53:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	You'll find the file in your .mozilla directory in your home folder, I think.
2006-12-29T13:54:00.000Z	genius314	pluma	Ok. Do I get the beta plugin from the flash website?
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	I think so.
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	genius314	pluma	ok.
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	You have to look around a bit, I think. Lemme check
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	I think that's it: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
2006-12-29T13:56:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	Simple unzip it and replace the existing file in...
2006-12-29T13:56:00.000Z	genius314	pluma	Ok, thanks.

2006-12-29T13:56:00.000Z	pluma		libflashplayer.so I think
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	Transparency and stuff like that doesn't work yet, though. Also it seems to be a bit glitchy. Best thing you can get for Linux, though.
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	pluma	genius314	Once you've replaced it, fire up Firefox and check the version of your plugin by loading a Flash page and right-clicking on the Flash app.
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	genius314	pluma	Ok.
