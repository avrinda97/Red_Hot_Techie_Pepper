2006-08-03T14:11:00.000Z	nikin		i didnt modify it yet. and yes i ame that user
2006-08-03T14:12:00.000Z	nikin		yup
2006-08-03T14:13:00.000Z	nikin		RW R  R
2006-08-03T14:15:00.000Z	nikin		no problem, just thinking.. coz if 2 people log in to a server and they should be able to write eachothers files, the i need to set this not?
2006-08-03T14:15:00.000Z	nikin		like RW RW R  if they are in same group
2006-08-03T14:16:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	yes, and the executable bit for directories in which these files are
2006-08-03T14:18:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	yes. you need to change that
2006-08-03T14:18:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	i have a /home/pub where all this stuff lives
2006-08-03T14:19:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	all you have to is add permissios. like 'chmod -R g+rwx directory" where directory is the one where these files live
2006-08-03T14:20:00.000Z	nikin	topyli	but what if someone saves a file into that directory?
2006-08-03T14:23:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	the directory has to be rwx so that people can actually access the stuff inside
2006-08-03T14:24:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	by default, this is indeed a problem. by default the permissions will be set to rwx------
2006-08-03T14:29:00.000Z	topyli	nikin	you need to set the sticky bit, and set group id. so what you actually want for the dir i guess is drwxrwsr-t. not sure, i think i'm not qualified for this anymore :)
