2007-01-28T10:44:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	thats normal..
2007-01-28T10:45:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	compile some software and watch it rish a lot more than 6 degrees :)
2007-01-28T10:45:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	the celeron on my laptop regularly reaches 80C (crap laptop with a desktop cpu and poor cooling)
2007-01-28T10:46:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	that's what my Desktop had previously - Around 80degrees. I replaced the heatsink earlier today, and it booted at 40degrees..I'd like to keep it there :-P
2007-01-28T10:46:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	it will always heat up a bit
2007-01-28T10:47:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	alright, thanks.
2007-01-28T10:47:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	FirstStrike, I'll keep an eye on it over the next hour
2007-01-28T10:48:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	use cat /proc/acpic/thermal_zone/THZN/temperature (the THZN may differ for your computer
2007-01-28T10:48:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	for the sensor, generally, what do you think "high" and "low" temperature levels should be set to?
2007-01-28T10:49:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	you mean something that will perfrom actions based on heat?
2007-01-28T10:50:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	no, the sensor shows a thermometer that changes colour with the CPU's temperature accordance to these values - If I set the "high" value to 200, it will be green, because it's not even nearly 200. But I change the "high" value to 50, it will be red, because it's near 50..
2007-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	ah, in that case i would set high to 70.. try actualy stressing the cpu first to see what temperature it reaches. if its just idleing away then the temperature wont change much at all..
2007-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	download some source code and compile it.. a large package like mplayer should do the trick
2007-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	I'll render some 3D scenes in blender...Same kind of thing
2007-01-28T10:52:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	as long as it uses cpu cycles it shoud do the trick
2007-01-28T10:52:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	do one massive one so it uses the cpu for a good bit of time.. don't give it any breaks
2007-01-28T10:53:00.000Z	Jimmey	variant	blender-bin is using 80% percent of the cpu, and it's staying at 47
2007-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	variant	Jimmey	only 100% counts
