2010-09-04T16:24:00.000Z	n00by		can a package be removed without removing it's dependancies? :P
2010-09-04T16:25:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	sure, actually that's the default behavior
2010-09-04T16:25:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	really?
2010-09-04T16:26:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	it does if you do "sudo apt-get autoremove gearman", but not with just "remove"
2010-09-04T16:27:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	you mean autoremove removes the dependancies while remove does not ?
2010-09-04T16:28:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	more or less. autoremove removes packages that are unneeded (i.e. not depended upon by any other package), so if your package was the only one that depended on them, they get removed
2010-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	and remove would just remove the package but not the ones on which it's dependant?
2010-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	yes (although you can do "sudo apt-get autoremove" later)
2010-09-04T16:30:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	indeed
2010-09-04T16:30:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	thank you
2010-09-04T16:31:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	although i have to ask, why do you want to keep dependencies installed if nothing is dependant on them? if it's because you have manually compiled stuff that APT doesn't know about, there's probably a better way
2010-09-04T16:31:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	so how do you want me to delete a pakcage ?
2010-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	I thought sudo apt-get remove gearman would delete gearman and all it's dependancies, but you said autoremove will do that
2010-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	both are correct, but i would use "autoremove", because, why keep the dependencies installed if they're no longer needed?
2010-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	ok, I will use autoremove from now onwards :)
2010-09-04T16:33:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	you can also use "remove" and then just do a "sudo apt-get autoremove" periodically, to get rid of unneeded things. matter of preference.
2010-09-04T16:34:00.000Z	n00by	LjL	so sudo apt-get autoremove removes ALL the unneeded dependancies/packages ?
2010-09-04T16:34:00.000Z	LjL	n00by	yep
