2009-02-11T05:04:00.000Z	Wizzup		Nope
2009-02-11T05:04:00.000Z	Wizzup		Use TwinView
2009-02-11T05:05:00.000Z	Wizzup		(Seperate X Screen didn't even work on my setup)
2009-02-11T05:05:00.000Z	Wizzup		There was this option for setting the position
2009-02-11T05:05:00.000Z	Wizzup		You can set it relatively to a monitor
2009-02-11T05:05:00.000Z	Wizzup		Either in pixels or just 'left'
2009-02-11T05:06:00.000Z	Wizzup		Lol, this is all out of my memory though, don't have any X near atm... Just a Gentoo without X.
2009-02-11T05:08:00.000Z	Wizzup		I really like Ubuntu because it is fairly easy to set up and such. If you have lots of experience you might want to choose one which comes with nearly no apps at all
2009-02-11T05:08:00.000Z	Wizzup		macbook as server? hmm
2009-02-11T05:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wizzup	not really, there's some experienced people that like Ubuntu.. I used it to basically jumpstart me into Debian.
2009-02-11T05:09:00.000Z	Wizzup	IndyGunFreak	I see... Well, I really liked Ubuntu because it was my first Distro to work properly. When I tried it at my laptop I found the performance quite slow though
2009-02-11T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wizzup	strange.. it runs quiet well on my 2 laptops, and an AAO i have...  1 laptop is newer (1.8ghz), one is quite old(900mhz)
2009-02-11T05:11:00.000Z	Wizzup	IndyGunFreak	Hmm, my laptop was quite old, with a 1,5 Ghz celeron. I was mainly referring to movies not playing _too_ well
2009-02-11T05:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wizzup	weird.. like i said, my laptop is a 1.8ghz celeron, and it plays movies find...
2009-02-11T05:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wizzup	no.. vlc
