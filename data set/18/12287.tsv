2006-05-15T15:03:00.000Z	Dingo		can I install ubuntu on an intel based Mac-mini?
2006-05-15T15:03:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	yes, using Boot Camp
2006-05-15T15:04:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	I mean natively!
2006-05-15T15:04:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	yes, using boot camp.
2006-05-15T15:05:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	isn't bootcamp an emulation software?
2006-05-15T15:05:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	no.
2006-05-15T15:05:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	oh...then it's ok :D
2006-05-15T15:06:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	boot camp is an integrated package consisting of a live partitioner, an IA-32 BIOS module for EFI that includes a graphical bootloader, and some windows drivers for mac hardware.
2006-05-15T15:07:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	but it can be used nearly as easily to run linux.
2006-05-15T15:08:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	but the linux software.. there will be no restrictions right?
2006-05-15T15:08:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	restrictions..?
2006-05-15T15:09:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	I mean, not being able to run some programs
2006-05-15T15:09:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	for example..?
2006-05-15T15:09:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	no idea, I'm just asking to be sure :P
2006-05-15T15:10:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	ubuntu will basically work the same way on intel mac hardware as it does on any other x86 PC.
2006-05-15T15:10:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	except that you'll need to use boot camp
2006-05-15T15:11:00.000Z	eobanb_	Dingo	there are plenty of how-tos online about running linux (particularly ubuntu, actually) on intel macs using boot camp
2006-05-15T15:11:00.000Z	Dingo	eobanb_	yes, I'm reading some
