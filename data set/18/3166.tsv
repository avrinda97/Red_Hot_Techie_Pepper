2009-11-26T08:50:00.000Z	VaultDweller		So like, I want to install KDE (generic), in Ubuntu 9.10
2009-11-26T08:50:00.000Z	VaultDweller		but for some reason, I can only download kubuntu-desktop, which makes my Ubuntu distro, a regular old Kubuntu one
2009-11-26T08:50:00.000Z	VaultDweller		I want the generic KDE
2009-11-26T08:51:00.000Z	VaultDweller		Not the Kubuntu branded
2009-11-26T08:51:00.000Z	VaultDweller		:P
2009-11-26T08:51:00.000Z	VaultDweller		You mean me? :P
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	VaultDweller		E: Package kde has no installation candidate
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	VaultDweller		james@james-ubuntu:~$
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	VaultDweller		Couldn't find package kde4
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	sudo apt-get install kde
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	try those. no guarantees. ;)
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	sudo apt-get install kde will work
2009-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	my bad
2009-11-26T08:53:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	keep in mind whatever the method, it'll probably be a LOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNGGGGGGGG installation
2009-11-26T08:54:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	that shouldnt make a difference...
2009-11-26T08:55:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	you should only have to type startkde
2009-11-26T08:55:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	and that SHOULD take care of it
2009-11-26T08:55:00.000Z	Archanamiya	VaultDweller	if i'm correct
