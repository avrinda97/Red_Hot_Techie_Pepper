2005-12-14T06:16:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint		hey, I'm trying to compile subcommnander (svn client) from its source.
2005-12-14T06:16:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint		but I get this error:
2005-12-14T06:16:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint		found qt version ./configure: line 5930: yes/bin/moc: No such file or directory but I need 3.2 <= version < 4.0.0
2005-12-14T06:16:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint		How do I get qt 3.2?
2005-12-14T06:17:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint		so... anyone know where could I get qt 3.2 to compile this app?
2005-12-14T06:19:00.000Z	BlueDevil	MonoNoGoldSaint	sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt-dev
2005-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	BlueDevil		good night people
2005-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	it says I already have the newest version. :(
2005-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	night!
2005-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	All I wanted was the old one (3.2)
2005-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	I have the compat libraries but they are not helping either.
2005-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	BlueDevil	MonoNoGoldSaint	do you have qt4-dev installed?
2005-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	let me see, but I guess so.
2005-12-14T06:23:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	I do.
2005-12-14T06:23:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	I have to get rid of it?
2005-12-14T06:25:00.000Z	BlueDevil	MonoNoGoldSaint	i think so
2005-12-14T06:25:00.000Z	MonoNoGoldSaint	BlueDevil	I'm removing it, let's see.
