2012-03-26T01:59:00.000Z	cuddylier		Why does it say "Permissions Denied" when I try to run a .sh file?
2012-03-26T01:59:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	because your currently logged in user either doesn't own the file or it's not marked executable
2012-03-26T02:00:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	sudo chmod +x filename
2012-03-26T02:01:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	if you still can't execute the script then you'll have to use sudo.
2012-03-26T02:02:00.000Z	cuddylier	wylde	How do I use sudo to execute it?
2012-03-26T02:02:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	sudo ./filename.sh
2012-03-26T02:05:00.000Z	cuddylier	wylde	I get "Command not found!"
2012-03-26T02:05:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	you'll have to cd /path/to/script.sh or sudo ./path/to/script.sh
2012-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	if that's where the file is that should work...unless there's a typos omewhere
2012-03-26T02:09:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	then cd /home/ryan/craftbukkit and do sudo  ./craftbukkit.sh
2012-03-26T02:13:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	follow the link to the site that was posted. My children are all grown up, I don't need to spoon feed anyone anymore :P
2012-03-26T02:22:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	issue the same command starting with sudo
2012-03-26T02:23:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	that's how you issue commands that require root access, such as installing packages.
2012-03-26T02:23:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	+1
2012-03-26T02:26:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	I don't understand what you mean.
2012-03-26T02:27:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	you can do the same things in gui that you can in terminal, usually (especially in IRC) it is easier and faster to use the command line.
2012-03-26T02:29:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	easiest is to cd /to/the/path/of/file and ./filename. If you need root privs to run it, use sudo ./filname
2012-03-26T02:30:00.000Z	wylde	cuddylier	when using sudo, make sure you have a good idea what is going to happen and/or trust where the script/command came from.
