2007-09-25T10:44:00.000Z	teb		so i have 8 updates to install, but update-manager says that they're not authenticated, should i install these packages anyways?  they're things like linux headers and linux source
2007-09-25T10:44:00.000Z	sethk	teb	if you don't install things that aren't authenticated, you effectively can't use the update facility at all.
2007-09-25T10:45:00.000Z	teb	sethk	it's just that i've never seen non-authenticated packages before, this warning box has never come up before
2007-09-25T10:45:00.000Z	teb	sethk	and i would think that at least linux-headers-2.6.20-16 would be signed
2007-09-25T10:46:00.000Z	sethk	teb	indeed, one would expect and hope that is the case, but frequently it isn't.
2007-09-25T10:47:00.000Z	teb	sethk	if i wait a while will a signed version be available, it wouldn't be in my best security interests to use unsigned packages (i'm a little bit of a security freak)
2007-09-25T10:47:00.000Z	sethk	teb	I don't disagree.  Obviously I don't know why you are updating, so I can't say whether or not waiting makes sense.
2007-09-25T10:48:00.000Z	teb	sethk	update manager said, hey i have package updates for you, here they are, that's why i'm updating
2007-09-25T10:48:00.000Z	sethk	teb	if you are security conscious, you should NEVER update simply because an update is available.
2007-09-25T10:49:00.000Z	teb	sethk	i totally agree, but when it comes to things like the kernel and the headers i try to stay on top of them for security fixes
2007-09-25T10:50:00.000Z	sethk	teb	indeed, but it is not uncommon for a security related patch to fix one problem and create others.  It's best to wait a while before patching, unless you know that the specific security issue that is addressed is actually relevant to your installation.  Many are quite specialized and don't apply to many configurations.
2007-09-25T10:50:00.000Z	sethk	teb	IMO, of course
2007-09-25T10:51:00.000Z	teb	sethk	i respect your O, and agree with you however as i am unknowing in some aspects of linux i don't know if a particular update actually fixes something that is broken that i have or not
2007-09-25T10:52:00.000Z	teb	sethk	so i can either stay with a hole i might possibly have or possibly create a new one, such a conundrum
2007-09-25T10:53:00.000Z	sethk	teb	indeed, it isn't obvious what is best.  You can only play the odds.  I think the odds favor waiting a short time after a patch is released, but in any given situation this may be wrong.  It also depends on what you know about who did the patch.  I'm much more nervous about installing a windows patch than I am about installing a linux patch.
2007-09-25T10:54:00.000Z	teb	sethk	 lol if i had a windows machine, i'd probably be running windows 2000, and i'm not sure they make patches for that anymore
2007-09-25T13:20:00.000Z	sethk	teb	when I've seen long mount times, they have been caused by DNS errors.  (This may or may not apply to your case, but it's worth checking.)  What I saw was a DNS lookup, a timeout, going to the next listed DNS server, a timeout, etc.
2007-09-25T13:21:00.000Z	sethk	teb	you can test this easily by substituting the IP address for the name in the specification of the NFS mount.  such as, instead of xyz:/a/b/c, 192.168.0.123:/a/b/c.
