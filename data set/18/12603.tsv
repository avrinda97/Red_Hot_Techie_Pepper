2006-04-26T16:56:00.000Z	Phlosten		if there is anyone in here familiar with xinerama, is there a way to force an application to open on a set screen?
2006-04-26T08:53:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	gstream is a plugin, am i right.. like arts.
2006-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	|lostbyte|		PhilCote: or sound server ?
2006-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	^
2006-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	Phlosten	|lostbyte|	the default installation of totem is totem-gstreamer (as opposed to totem-zine), it has a plugin for each file type
2006-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	Phlosten		totem-xine rather
2006-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	codec you mean.
2006-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	i have gxine
2006-04-26T08:56:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	i   have this option in amaroke for gstream and arts. so its confusing.
2006-04-26T08:56:00.000Z	Phlosten	|lostbyte|	well, yes, gstreamer is the audio system and it uses the codecs for each file type
2006-04-26T08:56:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	Does it do remote sound ? like arts..
2006-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	Phlosten	|lostbyte|	gstreamer is pretty good, except it still has some issues with sound/video latency
2006-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	Phlosten	|lostbyte|	not, sure never really dabbled in that area
2006-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	ahh ! :( ok
2006-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	thanks for the info.
2006-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	|lostbyte|		np
2006-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	Phlosten	|lostbyte|	there is a lot of development happening with ubuntu and gstreamer to get it working top notch :)
2006-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	Phlosten	k
