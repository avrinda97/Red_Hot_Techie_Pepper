2012-03-05T03:24:00.000Z	tomvolek		HI , i am trying to make a server use static IP, i have edited the interface file and added the auto eth0
2012-03-05T03:24:00.000Z	tomvolek		iface eth0 inet static  lines,   now when i try to  restart the networking, it says RTNETLINK answers: File exists
2012-03-05T03:24:00.000Z	tomvolek		Failed to bring up eth0.
2012-03-05T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	can you pastebin the lines you have added (or retype in a pastebin).

2012-03-05T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	the network will be .0   not .1
2012-03-05T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	the network address is incorrect
2012-03-05T03:29:00.000Z	tomvolek	ActionParsnip	 why 1 and not 0 ?
2012-03-05T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	look at your netmask
2012-03-05T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	you also set the network address as the same as the default gateway
2012-03-05T03:36:00.000Z	tomvolek	ActionParsnip	 can u tell me the difference between network and gateway ips int eh interface file, sorry I am newbie
2012-03-05T03:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	the gateway is the node your system will send data to if the address is not in your system's subnet. The network IP is the address of the entire network.
2012-03-05T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	so your netmask gives 253 networks, the network address will be .0 and the broadcast IP is .255   the network section of the address is 192.168.1   and anything not in that subnet will be sent to the default gateway to be sent out to the WAN
2012-03-05T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	you can use a more restrictive netwmask like 255.255.255.248 this will mean the network addresses will be 192.168.0.0, 192.168.0.0, 8, 192.168.0.0, 16, 192.168.0.0, 24   and so on

2012-03-05T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	all I did was copy the error which YOU pasted and slung it in duckduckgo, seems to happen a bit.
2012-03-05T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	can you give the output of:   sudo apt-get install pastebinit; clear; pastebinit /etc/lsb-release     Thanks
2012-04-08T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomvolek	netstat -a | grep portnum
