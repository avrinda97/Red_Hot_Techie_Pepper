2006-01-07T12:29:00.000Z	dooglus		I can't get "locate" to work in dapper.  Is anyone else having the same problem?  It's been like it for about 2 weeks now.
2006-01-07T12:30:00.000Z	dooglus		(dapper) chris@chrislap:~$ locate whatever
2006-01-07T12:30:00.000Z	dooglus		Segmentation fault
2006-01-07T12:30:00.000Z	dooglus		that's what I see
2006-01-07T12:30:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	it finds some files here and then it segfaults
2006-01-07T12:33:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	oh, you have the same?
2006-01-07T12:33:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	yes but it seems to work
2006-01-07T12:33:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	it finds a few files for me too
2006-01-07T12:33:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	it finds the file, then it segfaults so it doesnt really matter
2006-01-07T12:33:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	(it's just that I don't have "whatever"
2006-01-07T12:40:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	that's really weird
2006-01-07T12:40:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	what?
2006-01-07T12:45:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	you should file a bug report and that's it
2006-01-07T12:45:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	good idea
2006-01-07T12:45:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	I'd like to file the fix with it though
2006-01-07T12:45:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	start looking in locate bugzilla then or on google
2006-01-07T12:48:00.000Z	shining_	dooglus	yes nice :)
2006-01-07T14:44:00.000Z	dooglus	shining_	I got that slocate bug eventually.  It was a buffer overflow - the buffer was declared as char ch[0]  (!)
