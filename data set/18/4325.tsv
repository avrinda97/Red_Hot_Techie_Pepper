2009-04-28T16:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	What problem? :>
2009-04-28T16:15:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	The one we discuss is about a menu font proble with Firefox and thunderbird betas with ubuntu 9.04
2009-04-28T16:15:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	You're using betas? ^.^
2009-04-28T16:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	Shut down the firefox.  Rename ".mozilla" to ".mozilla-backup" and see if the problem still is there.
2009-04-28T16:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	It's in your home directory (~/user).  This will start firefox on a new profile.
2009-04-28T16:22:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	I already tried the new profile, that's the first thing I done infact. Nothing changes, the font is still too big for menus. What a screenshot ?
2009-04-28T16:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	Do send the SS.
2009-04-28T16:24:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	SS ? what's that ?
2009-04-28T16:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	SS --> Screenshot.
2009-04-28T16:24:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	sorry :) I send it in some seconds.

2009-04-28T16:42:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	Is this related to System --> Preferences --> Appearances --> (Look Under Fonts Size) ?
2009-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	I'm in 96dpi in system prefs. And no other program have this pb except Thunderbird 3.0 beta which is based on the same engine as FX...
2009-04-28T16:45:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	Well, since you're using 7inch netbook, you might be well off with 72 DPI.  And you're using Beta, which shouldn't be helped at all.  Also, you could use Font Rendering --> Subpixel smoothing (LCD).
2009-04-28T16:46:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	no, using a tohsiba 15" laptop. I just reduced the firefox window size to make the SS smaller...
2009-04-28T18:52:00.000Z	NicolasM14	mobi-sheep	about my Firefox pb, i'll just gonna fill a bug on bugzilla. Thanks for your help.
2009-04-28T18:52:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NicolasM14	Okay.  Good luck though. >_>
