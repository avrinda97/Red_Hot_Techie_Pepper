2006-05-20T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	no, it's not.  his hosts file is hosed.
2006-08-20T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	it's explained on the bottom half of that page
2008-03-07T21:35:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	the *, because the root account is locked
2008-03-07T21:36:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	Agent_bob ok i am not sure what is going on; if i want passwd on ubuntu system #1 to change the root password on the passwd file on ubuntu #2, can i ftp the passwd (and shadow files) from ubuntu #2 to #1, run passwd, change the password, then ftp the files back and have it all work?
2008-03-07T21:37:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	why not just ssh in and do it?
2008-03-07T21:37:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	Besides, if you're transferring secure files, you should be using scp not ftp anyway
2008-03-07T21:37:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	there are user access issues; the user is really green and really can barely log into Windows
2008-03-07T21:38:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	i just need to provide them with an automated procedure
2008-03-07T21:38:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	then he should not be changing the root password, let alone (probably) have a root account, and admin access is questionable too
2008-03-07T21:38:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	that's a non sequitor; they HAVE To be able to change it;
2008-03-07T21:38:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	Why do they need a root password anyway?  Whats inadequate with sudo?
2008-03-07T21:39:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	it's a turnkey ubuntu system; all they need to do is periodically change the root passwd for security reasons; that is it ... ok well i can run some experiments and see if i can make this work thanks
2008-03-07T21:39:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	Ubuntu systems *dont* have root passwords, for security reasons.
2008-03-07T21:40:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	sorry but this is not really a ubuntu distro ... it's more of a vanilla linux distro embedded in a system, but i figured the passwd issues were universal across all linux distros
2008-03-07T21:40:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	Really, if youre administering this for this guy, you shouldn't need to be asking these questions.  If you're so sure using a root account is appropriate, and feel qualified to make that decision, you shouldn't need to be asking these questions.
2008-05-31T08:39:00.000Z	Flannel	jramsey	sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
2008-05-31T08:39:00.000Z	jramsey	Flannel	txs
