2005-08-23T13:28:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		ati makes FAR superior video cards
2005-08-23T13:28:00.000Z	kvidell	PurpleMotion	If you like noise and interferance, sure. :-P
2005-08-23T13:29:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		my radeon 9700 pro 256 decimated every vnidia card i have ever seen
2005-08-23T13:29:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		nvidia
2005-08-23T13:29:00.000Z	kvidell	PurpleMotion	My GeForce MX4000 was able to play Goom 3 and HL2 at highest settings... My friends 9800pro could not. My card is 64bit, his is.. much more, lol.. 128?
2005-08-23T13:30:00.000Z	kvidell		Doom3 even
2005-08-23T13:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		then he had driver issues
2005-08-23T13:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		cause my radeon was the shiznit
2005-08-23T13:30:00.000Z	kvidell	PurpleMotion	That's my second point. ATI can't write drivers to save their life :)
2005-08-23T13:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		hell, THIS radeon os nice :)
2005-08-23T13:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		is
2005-08-23T13:31:00.000Z	kvidell		Their linux drivers (or lack there of in some cases) have been less than spectacular
2005-08-23T13:31:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		nah, i'll like ati more regardless because they draw a better picture on my screen.. crisper anti-aliasing, etc.. i dont reallyc are about speed, i dont play games
2005-08-23T13:31:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		for speed maybe
2005-08-23T13:32:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		but ati cards are a LOT prettier
2005-08-23T13:32:00.000Z	kvidell		Yea.. I've had crap luck with ATI's for many reasons. They let in a lot of noise that caused my display to look _god awful_, or they just plain didn't work, windows and linux...
2005-08-23T13:32:00.000Z	kvidell		PurpleMotion:I've not had that experience.
2005-08-23T13:32:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	kvidell	 sorry to hear it
