2007-06-01T10:27:00.000Z	inflex		okay, someone good with GFX 3D want to explain this to me... I reinstalled Ubuntu and thought I'd try run my TRON (armagetronad) and WOW, finally, 40fps at 1920x1200 with eerything turned on
2007-06-01T10:27:00.000Z	inflex		yet I run GLX gears and it -sucks-
2007-06-01T10:27:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	glxgears is not a benchmark
2007-06-01T10:27:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	I know - but it's at least /partially/ representitive
2007-06-01T10:28:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	well, it's still strange that when one goes well the other doesn't
2007-06-01T10:29:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	what video card?
2007-06-01T10:29:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	ATi Radeon 9250 (256MB)
2007-06-01T10:30:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	using the free driver in both cases?
2007-06-01T10:30:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	afaik, yes :\  any way of determining which is installed?
2007-06-01T10:31:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	the version of fglrx included in feisty doesn't support the 9250 anymore
2007-06-01T10:32:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	well, it's all very curious then isn't it
2007-06-01T10:32:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	I did /try/ to install flgx using the ATi site's driver package.. but it didn't even get started since there was a problem in one of the scripts
2007-06-01T10:33:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	yes that's the free driver
2007-06-01T10:34:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	just be happy it decided to work so well :P
2007-06-01T10:34:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	just thinking it'll come back later and bite me when I have to do another install :D
2007-06-01T10:34:00.000Z	inflex	crdlb	then I'll be cussing once more
2007-06-01T12:37:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	no gnome-volume-manager
2007-06-01T12:37:00.000Z	crdlb	inflex	which uses dbus and hal
