2005-09-10T11:33:00.000Z	afaik		any reason at all for ubuntu.org to use ssl with no valid cert?
2005-09-10T11:33:00.000Z	afaik		seems a waste
2005-09-10T11:34:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	because no one bought a cert yet
2005-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	afaik	bob2	why even use ssl though? It is just serving up information
2005-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	logins
2005-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	afaik	bob2	then why not do like a competent site and ONLY do ssl on the login portions?
2005-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	afaik	bob2	not for plain information
2005-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	sure it is
2005-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	if you only use encryption for things you want private, it means They know anything encrypted is worth looking at
2005-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	yes, you're missing the point, still
2005-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	afaik	bob2	the only point is laziness :)
2005-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	anyway, you clearly don't want to understand, so if you'd like it fixed, email the webmaster
2005-09-26T08:18:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	then report it on launchpad.net
2005-09-26T08:19:00.000Z	afaik	bob2	but we find bug!
2005-09-26T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	please stop it, or you'll have to leave
2005-10-03T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	file a bug, too
2005-10-03T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	stop it
2005-10-03T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	afaik	chill out
