2006-03-26T06:31:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	what is it?
2006-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	i'm trying to compile an application and so i have to run configure
2006-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	that error comes right at the end.
2006-03-26T06:33:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	yes but what is it.  reason i'm asking is b/c it might be in the repos already
2006-03-26T06:33:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	i checked, it's not in the repos
2006-03-26T06:33:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	then you need some x*-dev packages i would assume
2006-03-26T06:34:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	and also, are you aware of checkinstall>?
2006-03-26T06:34:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	checkinstall? no
2006-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	what does it do?
2006-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	makes a deb file from the source so you can remove the thing later easier.
2006-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	i see
2006-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	what's the exact X package i need again?
2006-03-26T06:38:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	i'm not sure, but my guess is x-window-system-dev
2006-03-26T06:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	i'm downloading the packages that ubotu said abot X includes
2006-03-26T06:43:00.000Z	brenner	DJAdmiral	yes, mr. nalioth told me.  sorry i missed the ones you needed :)
2006-03-26T06:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	brenner	no problem. I'm thankful that you're helping me to learn
