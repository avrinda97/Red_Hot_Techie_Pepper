2006-07-24T13:00:00.000Z	greenman		hello.
2006-07-24T13:01:00.000Z	greenman		my gentoo installation has gone to hell and I would like to replace it with ubuntu.
2006-07-24T13:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	pop in the ubuntu desktop cd, reboot, click on the lovely install icon.
2006-07-24T13:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	is your /home on another partition?
2006-07-24T13:02:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	this is our mail server and I would like to keep the mail that people already have and be able to integrate it into a new mail app
2006-07-24T13:02:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	yeah it is.
2006-07-24T13:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	oooh, I don't know if its such a wise move to convert a mail server to ubuntu. Try to sort out your gentoo issues in #gentoo -- lots of friendly people in there.
2006-07-24T13:04:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	I would, but we've been having issues from day one.  Gentoo is a really good distro, but you have to babysit it a lot.
2006-07-24T13:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	aye, its a labor of love.
2006-07-24T13:04:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	I'm thinking since we're using .maildir in users directories, maybe it won't be so complicated?
2006-07-24T13:07:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	what does ubuntu come with for mail?  Is it pretty simple to install if it doesn't come with it?  We need email that's readable by emacs.
2006-07-24T13:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	hrmm, should be okay then -- just backup /home somewhere
2006-07-24T13:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	console or something else?
2006-07-24T13:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	by default, you get evolution.
2006-07-24T13:08:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	does that use .maildir?
2006-07-24T13:08:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	um, yeah console
2006-07-24T13:09:00.000Z	greenman	fyrestrtr	the boss grew up on solaris unix
2006-07-24T13:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	greenman	oh pick your poison I guess. I like mutt.
