2006-12-18T10:12:00.000Z	Asc		Is beryl a window manager or a desktop environment?  Will feisty still use GNOME?
2006-12-18T10:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	WM, and yes.
2006-12-18T10:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	How do you propose to run two window managers at the same time, exactly?
2006-12-18T10:16:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	Good point.  I'm still a little hazy on the exact definition of a window manager.
2006-12-18T10:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	Window manager draws the titlebar at the top (with the _ o x) buttons. Window managers decide where windows are. Window managers move, maximise, minimise, restore, scale, tile, animate windows. Manage them, if you will.
2006-12-18T10:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	Desktop environments provide a consistent user interface, configuration utilities, a desktop, an API, and applications. An environment, if you will, to work in. Upon a desktop.
2006-12-18T10:17:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	*in a fake sneaky tone* But you can't run a window manager *under another window manager*?
2006-12-18T10:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	Any desktop environment can be used with any window manager, and vice versa.
2006-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	*gravely* No. But the best minds of the nation are working at it.
2006-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	I sense that you've had the opportunity to make that distinction before ;p
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	let me see if I've got this straight.  Your mount points are now okay, but something crashed and now the display doesn't work?
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	I believe you're talking to awilcox
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	yeah, probably
2007-02-03T11:31:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	No, but if no perl gurus show up I can do it in python.
2007-02-03T11:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	Well, at need I could do it in java. I was kind of looking for something like cat file | somemagicalcommandwitharcanename
2007-02-03T11:34:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	Yeah, can't really help you with that.  Bet I can do it in fewer lines than with java though. ;\
2007-02-03T11:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	Oh xD Sorry, brainfart. while read line ; do if [ $a = "1" ]  ; a = 0 ; break ; else echo $line ; a = 1 ; fi ; done
2007-02-03T11:37:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	That would look so much more cryptic in perl.
