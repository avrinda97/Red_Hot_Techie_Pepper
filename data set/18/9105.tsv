2007-10-14T10:24:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	oh noes! Dont love your distro, that's when you get an electric shock from your HD ;(
2007-10-14T10:29:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	it's a skill you can get for a Druid on World of Warcraft @ level 50 :D
2007-10-14T10:31:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	i may be able to help you. But i doubt the performance will be very good. it's not for me atleast, and i have 2x 8800GTX's
2007-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	It may be my drivers, because its definately not hardware.
2007-10-14T10:34:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	Do you have wine installed?
2007-10-14T10:34:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	Wine is a windows emulator.
2007-10-14T10:34:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	open terminal and type "sudo apt-get install wine" should help a bit :P
2007-10-14T10:35:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	i mean, it means you can run windows based things.
2007-10-14T10:35:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	just type what i said in terminal :P
2007-10-14T10:36:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	wha? did you type "sudo" before "apt-get install wine"
2007-10-14T10:37:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	odd, if that fails, close the terminal and start again
2007-10-14T10:38:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	sick of what? :P
2007-10-14T10:38:00.000Z	TriGz_	Manderson	im gonna do the same when ophcrack is working
