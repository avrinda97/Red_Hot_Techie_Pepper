2010-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	MrWGW		how do I disable those obnoxious notification bubbles that appear every time you get a message in Pidgin or Empathy and the window isn't focused?
2010-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	MrWGW		those bubbles persist like 5 seconds and there's no easy way to close them
2010-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	MrWGW		its extremely annoying
2010-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	MrWGW		can I disable libnotify altogether?
2010-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	MrWGW		I very much resent this form of desktop behavior
2010-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	MrWGW		that blowsucks
2010-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	codebrainz	MrWGW	i think notification-daemon is in charge of that
2010-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	MrWGW		but oh well
2010-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	MrWGW		why is it that GNOME's UI designers (and KDE's) have gotten so obnoxious over the past few years? :-p
2010-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	MrWGW		actually most recent OS releases have UIs that piss me off
2010-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	MrWGW		OS X especially
2010-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	MrWGW		Windows 7 is very much on my shitlist though
2010-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	MrWGW		now the other question I have - is there a command line tool to set the ip address etc similiar to service network restart?
2010-06-04T11:30:00.000Z	MrWGW		err
2010-06-04T11:30:00.000Z	MrWGW		rather
2010-06-04T11:30:00.000Z	MrWGW		similiar to system-config-network-tui
2010-06-04T11:31:00.000Z	codebrainz	MrWGW	edit the file /etc/network/interfaces and restart the networking service, but interfaces configured in there won't work in network-manager anymore
2010-06-04T11:31:00.000Z	MrWGW	codebrainz	in general that's a good thing
