2009-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	zaniel_		I have a panasonic dvd ram multi drive that will not burn in Jaunty (ubuntu) I burn coasters and don't know why
2009-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	I have a funny story!  I thought my combo drive was a cd-r/dvd-r when I looked it was just dvd-rom :/.  Do you use dvd+r or dvd-r?
2009-06-09T07:51:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	could be the disks are they dvd-rw?
2009-06-09T07:53:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	are they CD-rw disks?  People have reported problems with the -rw.
2009-06-09T07:55:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	can't think of the name of it - but the package had to do with cd data formats
2009-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	cdrdao is one of them to add
2009-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	Try adding cdrdao through synaptic
2009-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	your welcome :)
2009-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	hmm....what program are you using to burn cd's?
2009-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	I didn't know nero had a linux version?
2009-06-09T08:05:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	did you try the default burner in Gnome?
2009-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	go to the tools menu in the burner and should be an option there to burn image
2009-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	if it is Brasero - last button on the left side, bottom
2009-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	If its gnomebaker - its under tools
2009-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	any luck?
2009-06-09T08:12:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	sorry, in Brasero its the last button on the left side of the window "Burn Image"
2009-06-09T08:13:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	are you seeing it down the left side of the window, not menu bar
2009-06-09T08:15:00.000Z	linux	zaniel_	yay!  Good luck!
