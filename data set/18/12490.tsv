2006-04-22T16:31:00.000Z	riomerc		so yeah
2006-04-22T16:31:00.000Z	riomerc		two ubuntu partitions, the ones it requires
2006-04-22T16:32:00.000Z	riomerc		ok
2006-04-22T16:32:00.000Z	riomerc		how?
2006-04-22T16:33:00.000Z	topyli	riomerc	you can't resize or otherwise mounted partitions
2006-04-22T16:34:00.000Z	riomerc	topyli	well, that's a fucking waste of HD
2006-04-22T16:34:00.000Z	topyli	riomerc	i.e. if your system is on the partition you wish to reparition, you need to boot into another system
2006-04-22T16:36:00.000Z	topyli	riomerc	so is the space you want to edit mounted or not?
2006-04-22T16:36:00.000Z	riomerc	topyli	sorry, what?
2006-04-22T16:37:00.000Z	topyli	riomerc	if you have one big partiton, and you're currently running the system you have installed on it, you can't do a thing
2006-04-22T16:39:00.000Z	topyli	riomerc	or any linux live cd with parted on it
2006-04-22T16:41:00.000Z	topyli	riomerc	why do you want to repartition anyway. the space is there, aren't you happy?
