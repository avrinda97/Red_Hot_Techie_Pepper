2010-10-11T14:53:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		what would be the best way to upgrade my 9.10 kernel from 2.6.31 to > 2.6.36 ?
2010-10-11T14:54:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		what kernel does the latest ubuntu use
2010-10-11T14:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ae86-drifter	2.6.35 for the latest stable
2010-10-11T14:57:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	psycho_oreos	thanks for the reply, would there be an issue if i installed 2.6.36 to my 9.10 ?
2010-10-11T14:57:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		could you please tell me the best way to include this in my repositories
2010-10-11T14:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ae86-drifter	I wouldn't recommend it personally, if you're planning to use the ubuntu patched version in most cases it should work with a few broken dependencies but when using a vanilla kernel you may get lots more broken dependencies
2010-10-11T15:00:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	psycho_oreos	so what should i change to include this in my repositories? I need this version for my dtv card to work & it's a media center pc
2010-10-11T15:02:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		i already tried enabling backports
2010-10-11T15:02:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ae86-drifter	I'd say you need to add maverick meerkat to your repositories and only grab the source code of the provided kernel from that repository before disabling the maverick repository.. Again I must stress that this may break your setup, so do be prepared for it
2010-10-11T15:03:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	psycho_oreos	thanks
2010-10-11T15:04:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		i will just hope for the best, what is a good way to prepare for my setup breaking/
2010-10-11T15:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ae86-drifter	make sure you keep your copy of current kernel
2010-10-11T15:05:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		ok sure, i was going to do that for sure anyway, unless you have another idea, im about to start it now
2010-10-11T15:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos		in other words, make sure that the newly compiled kernel does not replace your current kernel or delete your current kernel version in the grub entires
2010-10-11T15:06:00.000Z	psycho_oreos		not really lol, all the best
2010-10-11T15:06:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	psycho_oreos	oh ok cool thanks :) last time i installed a new kernel with dpkg -i on debian and it worked fine..
2010-10-11T15:07:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		but the grub entry did not work
2010-10-11T15:07:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ae86-drifter	I'd double check everything before rebooting, especially current kernel and the kernel is also listed in grub entries
