2006-11-03T11:23:00.000Z	kronoman		question : ubuntu 6.06 uses ALSA as default sound system ?
2006-11-03T11:24:00.000Z	crimsun	kronoman	we've used alsa by default ever since warty (4.10)
2006-11-03T11:25:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	any idea why the joystick port is not active ? my joystick don't works
2006-11-03T11:25:00.000Z	kronoman		I think that ubuntu should provide a way to use joysticks easy to use
2006-11-03T11:25:00.000Z	kronoman		(fill a bug?)
2006-11-03T11:26:00.000Z	crimsun	kronoman	which card do you have?
2006-11-03T11:26:00.000Z	crimsun		sound card, that is, kronoman
2006-11-03T11:26:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	a CMPCI 8738, I know how to activate it manually to use the gamepad, but would be cool if new versions would detect it
2006-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	kronoman		I must add the line options snd-cmipci joystick_port=1 to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2006-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	crimsun	kronoman	that's not detectable currently, hence why you have to pass a parameter.
2006-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	maybe the joystick package should be installed by default too
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	crimsun	kronoman	request they be added, then.
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	also I have a script for init.d to start/stop the joystick
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	ok, I will try to see first how to get in touch with developers, and maybe help with the old-school joystick stuff
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	crimsun	kronoman	you're talking with one.
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	any idea if USB joysticks are OK ? I didn't had the opportunity to test one
2006-11-03T11:31:00.000Z	crimsun	kronoman	I don't know; no one has slipped me test hardware.
2006-11-03T11:31:00.000Z	kronoman	crimsun	I work at gameloft, I will try to fetch some joysticks to do my tests next week, thanks for your help
