2009-09-15T03:32:00.000Z	Loder3331		Is there such thing as a terminal command that can change screen resolution? One that would be common to ubuntu and other distributions?
2009-09-15T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	xrandr
2009-09-15T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	it does more than dual screens
2009-09-15T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	you probably want to read some documentation, yeah
2009-09-15T03:37:00.000Z	Loder3331	jrib	how do I change from one mode to another? To choose another resolution? I don't see it there
2009-09-15T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution , http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2
2009-09-15T03:45:00.000Z	Loder3331	jrib	I inputted xrandr and this is what it returned. I don't use ldvr (I don't think?) like in the article. I'm using a hdmi input. How do I change the resolution? I tried the command they suggested and it didn't work.
2009-09-15T03:47:00.000Z	Loder3331	jrib	are you still here?
2009-09-15T03:47:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	yes, use pastebin...
2009-09-15T03:48:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	visit paste.ubuntu.com, it's pretty self-explanatory
2009-09-15T03:48:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	so paste what you want to show me, submit, give me url
2009-09-15T03:51:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	show the command you tried
2009-09-15T03:52:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	well neither of those were listed in your xrandr output
2009-09-15T03:53:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	you need to actually read the links I gave you please
2009-09-15T03:53:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	not just search for commands and copy and paste them without understanding
2009-09-15T03:54:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	hint: your output's name is "default"
2009-09-15T03:56:00.000Z	Loder3331	jrib	Okay I got it, thanks. Is there a key combination that I can press to open a terminal prompt on my other distro when I go to fix this? Because I can't navigate to the terminal because of the resolution.
2009-09-15T03:56:00.000Z	jrib	Loder3331	one does not exist by default on gnome, you can try alt-f2 to get a run prompt and then typing "gnome-terminal" though
