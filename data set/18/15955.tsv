2004-12-30T07:00:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	if you want to actually disagree with me on something, you're welcome to do so, and I'll tell you why I think you're wrong :)
2004-12-30T07:02:00.000Z	melazyboy	njan	Because your making a rediciolus claim that gentoo is 140% faster, when in reality typical gentoo optimizations only make a 5-15% difference.
2004-12-30T07:03:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	you're making a ridiculous (and badly spelt) claim based on the premise 'when in reality.. ' which is just as asserted as the point I made.
2004-12-30T07:04:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	your 'reality' aside, I have personally experienced, as someone who works in IT, in a high-availability environment in which I use my laptop, that my laptop is significantly faster in gentoo than it has been today in ubuntu, under similar load. If you want to disagree with me, you're welcome to, but as was indicated by my experiental assertion, this is based on experience, and nothing else.
2004-12-30T07:04:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	I have neither the time nor interest in putting any numbers together.
2004-12-30T07:05:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	gnome is more responsive, tab completion is faster, and I can have more open without my DE freezing for a few microseconds each time I switch Virtual Desktop, and as far as I can tell, there's a ~40% difference as far as my productivity is concerned, even if the *precise* response times aren't that great.
2004-12-30T07:06:00.000Z	melazyboy	njan	You show your experince by making a claim that is not possible, gentoo is faster because it's compiled using specialized optimizations, those can be quantified, and the number doesn't even come close to 140%
2004-12-30T07:06:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	bear in mind also that whilst a specific package might only be 10% faster with speed optimisations, the average linux desktop is a layered environment in which unoptimised software is running in an unoptimised desktop environment in an unoptimised xserver, on an unoptimised kernel.
2004-12-30T07:07:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	so 'speed', which is an ambiguous term, refers to the speed increase over *all four layers*.
2004-12-30T07:07:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	so what you're basically saying is that what I've said is, what I've asserted isn't possible because it's a claim which isn't possible, based on nebulous 'quantitative' figures which you haven't supplied either :)
2004-12-30T07:08:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	it's disagreeable people like you who give linux communities bad names :)
2004-12-30T07:10:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	as I said before, I have no interest in benchmarking it, and as I also said before, the situation is more complicated than you're assuming. I suggest you go back and read what I said ;)
2004-12-30T07:10:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	that's not what I said at all.
2004-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	it was an occasional sentence. You wouldn't extrapolate 'this scottish man is drunk' to infer that all scottish men are drunk. Equally, it's stupid to assume that because I believe that in my circumstance, there's a 140% speed increase, there is always one.
2004-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	njan	melazyboy	I suggest you both go back and read everything that I said carefully, and that you pick up a book or two on critical thinking and read something by Quine.
2004-12-30T07:13:00.000Z	melazyboy	njan	Give me a fucking break, you none the less said that Gentoo was 140% faster than Ubuntu, which is impossible in any situation, why? BECAUSE COMPILE TIME OPTIMIZATIONS CAN NOT EQUATE TO 140% <-- now drop it douche.
2004-12-30T07:14:00.000Z	melazyboy	njan	I never said anything about assuming, or you assuming, i said you stated, which you did, that gentoo was 140% faster on your laptop, which it isn't.
