2007-10-04T05:40:00.000Z	cjae_		in ubuntu is there anyway to put two avi's back together as one big one that was separated on a win machine
2007-10-04T05:41:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	 avimerge -o foo.avi -i foo1.avi foo2.avi
2007-10-04T05:42:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	you will need the transcode package (sudo apt-get install transcode)
2007-10-04T05:42:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	avi merge already in ubuntu
2007-10-04T05:43:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	?
2007-10-04T05:44:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	is this possible to do with avidemux as well cause g/f is not going to like commandline
2007-10-04T05:45:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	you can use avidemux yes, but commandline is much easier IMHO
2007-10-04T05:45:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	I merely meant is avimerge installed in ubuntu by default
2007-10-04T05:46:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	no not by default
2007-10-04T05:47:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	was looking for how to merge in avidemux do you know what it is labelled as?
2007-10-04T05:47:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	sorry I don't use avidemux
2007-10-04T05:48:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	yes but trying to teach her cli is going to be difficult as there are many split avi's box had no dvd burner in it
2007-10-04T05:48:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	thanks anyway
2007-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	 it gave me invalid input file when using avimerge is there credentials for the output filename?
2007-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	you did this right: avimerge -o outputfilename.avi -i part1.avi part2.avi
2007-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	sorry
2007-10-04T06:06:00.000Z	cjae_	heguru	thank you very much avimerge work quite well and all synced up
2007-10-04T06:07:00.000Z	heguru	cjae_	welcome :)
