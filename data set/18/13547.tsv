2010-09-06T10:07:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	nocturnus	it depends on few packages, most on default installation
2010-09-06T10:08:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	nocturnus	debconf (>= 0.5) , debconf-2.0 , libc6 (>= 2.4) , and wget
2010-09-06T10:09:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	nocturnus	it works just fine, I am typing from a b43 wifi connection right now
2010-09-06T10:09:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	nocturnus	it might have some issues with a particular chipset, but the chance for it to work is good
2010-09-06T10:11:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	nocturnus	my system runs on a BCM4311 rev 01
