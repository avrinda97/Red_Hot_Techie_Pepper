2006-10-16T15:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	I'm glad you think so
2006-10-16T15:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	The occasional complement is nice to hear among many complaints
2006-10-16T15:42:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	have you considered other linux distributions too?
2006-10-16T15:43:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	I tried linspire, then ubuntu, and settled (temporarily) on debian, so sometimes you'll like 2 or 3
2006-10-16T15:44:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	have you tried kde too?
2006-10-16T15:44:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	(Kde is a desktop environment)

2006-10-16T15:46:00.000Z	fkdsm	SeanTater	 well.. i would like to update to the newly released Gnome, any tips in howto, or is this included in the Synaptics
2006-10-16T15:47:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	it should be in edgy
2006-10-16T15:47:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	If you wait, edgy will be released in a few days
2006-10-16T15:48:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	But it's not as stable as dapper (and probably will never be, It's not intended to be)
2006-10-16T15:48:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	sure
2006-10-16T15:48:00.000Z	SeanTater	fkdsm	see ya, got to go
