2011-06-13T20:02:00.000Z	assink		hm, im at a friend, she did just an update. and rebooted. and now she lost the UUID of her / partition
2011-06-13T20:03:00.000Z	oCean	assink	don't suggest that here, thank you
2011-06-13T20:04:00.000Z	assink	oCean	or ubuntu forums
2011-06-13T20:04:00.000Z	oCean	assink	that neither, you don't tell others to just 'search <url>'
2011-06-13T20:06:00.000Z	assink	oCean	and im just iritated that a upgrade can let your machine loose UUID's this is the second time it happens here
2011-06-13T20:07:00.000Z	oCean	assink	i understand, but still you can't tell others just to google it.
2011-06-13T20:09:00.000Z	assink	oCean	i dont know, this person just said by him/herself that he/she didnt search yet. so then its just odd to ask immediatly. i remember when i started 12 years ago with my debian installation. then im still nice now :)
2011-06-13T20:10:00.000Z	oCean	assink	fair enough, but channel guidelines are clear on just suggesting google (or other search engines)
2011-06-13T20:10:00.000Z	oCean	assink	you got the UUID change/removal fixed?
2011-06-13T20:11:00.000Z	assink	oCean	no, i just get in the initrd CLI
2011-06-13T20:11:00.000Z	assink	oCean	but i think i should try a fsckfs maybe
2011-06-13T20:12:00.000Z	assink	oCean	just came up in my head. it might that the partition superblock or something broke. is the only thing that would make sense to me
2011-06-13T20:13:00.000Z	oCean	assink	I really have no clue as to why UUID is (seems to have) gone, but you can alway add it again
2011-06-13T20:13:00.000Z	assink	oCean	ah
2011-06-13T20:13:00.000Z	oCean	assink	boot from livecd and fix the filesystems
2011-06-13T20:14:00.000Z	assink	oCean	thats what i was thinking about now yes. but strange thing is that this is the 2nd time after updating. i was wondering if that question came here before. of its a dual-boot btw
2011-06-13T20:14:00.000Z	oCean	assink	currently checking the bugspages, but not finding anything relevant
2011-06-13T20:15:00.000Z	assink	oCean	just searched for hours too already yes, just doesnt make sense at all
