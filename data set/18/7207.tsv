2011-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	josephoenix		Okay... well I just tried to disable a service using update-rc.d
2011-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	josephoenix		and saw "Do NOT use update-rc.d for this purpose in the docs"
2011-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	josephoenix		What should I do?
2011-06-15T09:15:00.000Z	josephoenix		oh, never mind
2011-06-15T09:17:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	stop servicename
2011-06-15T09:18:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	start servicename
2011-06-15T09:18:00.000Z	josephoenix	histo	Jon--: that will persist after reboot?
2011-06-15T09:20:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	hold up one sec let me read some stuff
2011-06-15T09:23:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	sudo update-rc.d servicename stop 2 3 4 5    or what ever runlevels you want
2011-06-15T09:23:00.000Z	josephoenix	histo	okay, so 'stop' is the level to disable the service?
2011-06-15T09:23:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	the levels control which runlevels you want to disable it on 1-6
2011-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	mostlike 2-5
2011-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	sorry most likely
2011-06-15T09:27:00.000Z	josephoenix	histo	okay, it looks like there are links for apache2 in rc0, rc1  and rc6.. should I remove those?
2011-06-15T09:29:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	 0 is for shutdown phase 1 is for recovery console and 6 is for reboot
2011-06-15T09:29:00.000Z	histo	josephoenix	so if you want.  That's the only time it would get called is shutdown reboot or recovery
2011-06-15T09:30:00.000Z	josephoenix	histo	right, I'm thinking I don't need a web server that starts on shutdown...
2011-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	josephoenix	histo	something else that confused me is that mysql was installed and presumably added to startup, but I don't see links in the rc folders...
