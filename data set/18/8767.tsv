2007-10-28T10:25:00.000Z	osmosis		is there an easy way to get php4 onto gutsy?
2007-10-28T10:27:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	why would you want to do that (tm)
2007-10-28T10:27:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	so I can get a legacy php4 app running with too much trouble.
2007-10-28T10:29:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	wow, it's really not there!  I'm surprised.
2007-10-28T10:29:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	yah, edgy was the last release that had it.
2007-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	you ever used pbuilder?  http://tumbleweed.org.za/2007/06/10/php4-for-feisty-pbuilder-for-beginners/
2007-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	is the app that bad?  I recently had a shared server upgraded from 4. to 5 without my knowledge and all my legacy code there just kept on working....
2007-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	no
2007-10-28T10:33:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	looks like it's build-your-own time: http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v4
2007-10-28T10:33:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	will that build mod_php for apache also?
2007-10-28T10:34:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	as well as the command line version?
2007-10-28T10:34:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	don't know, but I would suspect yes
2007-10-28T10:34:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	but have you tried the app under PHP5?  You know it's bad legacy code?
2007-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	lots of possible configurations. ill have to test php5 too. im pretty sure there is going to be issues either way.
2007-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	so im trying to kept the env changes low
2007-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	or i just stay on dapper for now. that has php4 and php5
2007-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	pbx	osmosis	I hear you. I've just been pleasantly surprised by the ease of migration in most cases.  But I generally wrote my PHP4 code to be pretty "dumb" and clean.
2007-10-28T10:38:00.000Z	osmosis	pbx	+100,000 lines of php4 code that I didnt write. im just doing IT. Besides, I do python.
