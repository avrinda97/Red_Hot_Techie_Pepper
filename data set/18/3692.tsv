2011-02-27T08:28:00.000Z	MariaKeys		Abhijit: Do you know the story of 3 monkeys?
2011-02-27T08:29:00.000Z	MariaKeys		Abhijit: Let me tell you the story of 3 monkeys...
2011-02-27T08:29:00.000Z	MariaKeys		They put 3 monkeys in a cage... And put a banana on top.
2011-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	MariaKeys		Every time one of the monkeys try to get the banana, the owner of the house beats him. All monkeys try in turn, they get beaten.
2011-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	MariaKeys		After a while, monkeys learn the trick, and they no longer reach to the banana.
2011-02-27T08:31:00.000Z	MariaKeys		So one day... They bring in a new monkey to the cage...
2011-02-27T08:31:00.000Z	MariaKeys		The new monkey looks around... He goes for the banana.
2011-02-27T08:31:00.000Z	MariaKeys		As soon as he goes for the banana, all 3 other monkeys start beating him.

2011-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	shcherbak	MariaKeys	Then ok, if you want root shell in Ubuntu/Dedian you need to reconfigure 80% of system and eventually use normal kernel, besides it ok.
