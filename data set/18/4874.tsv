2009-05-28T06:50:00.000Z	chronofire	harpreet_	ok
2009-05-28T06:50:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	please check your power supply to the drive, open your cpu
2009-05-28T06:51:00.000Z	chronofire	harpreet_	 is there anything on the cmputer that could be done first before i have to open my computer up?
2009-05-28T06:52:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	that was just for your information , now we have to work on what you already got, can you play anything on it, any sound or nothing at all?
2009-05-28T06:52:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	no, you gotta open it buddy
2009-05-28T06:53:00.000Z	chronofire	harpreet_	 nothing at all
2009-05-28T06:53:00.000Z	chronofire	harpreet_	il go do that
2009-05-28T06:54:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	i can suggest you something, try thing, hwinfo and tell me output (in terminal)
2009-05-28T06:55:00.000Z	chronofire	harpreet_	i am installing hwinfo now
2009-05-28T06:55:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	good, then do sudo hwinfo --short and tell me output where it says /dev/sr0
2009-05-28T06:57:00.000Z	chronofire	harpreet_	i do not see /dev/sr0
2009-05-28T06:58:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	it should be listed right under /dev/sda
2009-05-28T06:58:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	if it is not there that means ,1. it does not take power, 2, its ide/sata cable dies 3. it itself died, so that means open up your computer

2009-05-28T06:59:00.000Z	harpreet_	chronofire	you are welcomea
