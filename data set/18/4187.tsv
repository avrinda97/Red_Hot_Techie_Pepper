2010-02-05T02:52:00.000Z	Rubyiris		Would someone be able to explain to me why even though ubuntu is advertised to run basic programs, and even some games faster than windows, ubuntu actually runs significantly slower? Also would someone be able to help me improve my performance?
2010-02-05T02:54:00.000Z	Rubyiris		It's been advertised to do so on alot of websites. It's not like I've taken the liberty to memorize them. Use googlefu.
2010-02-05T02:55:00.000Z	Rubyiris		I've seen it on -SEVERAL- websites.
2010-02-05T02:55:00.000Z	Rubyiris		But thats not important.

Also would someone be able to help me improve my performance? <- reposting because people got off-track and didn't actully bother to help.
2010-02-05T02:57:00.000Z	Rubyiris		I am.
2010-02-05T02:57:00.000Z	klappi	Rubyiris	your question is quite generic what application is slow?
2010-02-05T02:58:00.000Z	Rubyiris		Alot of applications are slow. Firefox slows to an absolute crawl if I have even a total of three tabs open. A problem I don't have on windows.
2010-02-05T02:58:00.000Z	Rubyiris		I'm not specifically asking for game help damnit. Learn to read.
2010-02-05T02:59:00.000Z	Rubyiris		Then why is ubuntu advertised to run basic apps, and -some- non linux games faster than windows?
2010-02-05T02:59:00.000Z	Rubyiris		:|
2010-02-05T03:00:00.000Z	Rubyiris		music programs, firefox, etc.
