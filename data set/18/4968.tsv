2009-01-06T12:02:00.000Z	mrmac_		hello
2009-01-06T12:03:00.000Z	mrmac_		i was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction with web develpment
2009-01-06T12:03:00.000Z	mrmac_		much love if so
2009-01-06T12:03:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	what language?
2009-01-06T12:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	what platform?
2009-01-06T12:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	you would want to start with a lamp server
2009-01-06T12:05:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	 google lamp... linux, apache, mysql, php
2009-01-06T12:39:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	if you are only using this on localhost, set apache to only listen on 127.0.0.1
2009-01-06T14:47:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	no go
2009-01-06T14:47:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	`netstat -an | grep :80`
2009-01-06T14:52:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	nope
2009-01-06T14:55:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	do a `netstat -an | grep :80`
2009-01-06T14:55:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	just did
2009-01-06T14:55:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	still no go....
2009-01-06T14:58:00.000Z	mrmac_	tyler_d	 tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:80            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
2009-01-06T14:59:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	ok so its listening on your box, you have a routing issue
2009-01-06T14:59:00.000Z	tyler_d	mrmac_	however I'm not sure why its only listening on 127.0.0.1.... if you want people from outside to hit it you should have it listening on teh public address... ie. 10. or 192.
2009-01-06T15:03:00.000Z	mrmac_	tyler_d	 okay, i'll look into that also
