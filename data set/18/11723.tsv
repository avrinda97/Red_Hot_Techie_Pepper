2007-02-05T08:24:00.000Z	compengi	francois	how to check the version of flash plugin in firefox?
2007-02-05T08:24:00.000Z	francois	compengi	i don't think its only for firefox, you can check with flash.com or adobe.com the latest being v9.0
2007-02-05T08:25:00.000Z	compengi	francois	yeah i know that it's 9 but i want to make sure that i have it
2007-02-05T08:26:00.000Z	francois	compengi	if you have it installed, thats the one you have, it'll override any other versions
2007-02-05T08:26:00.000Z	francois	compengi	no matter way
2007-02-05T08:26:00.000Z	francois	compengi	no matter what*
2007-02-05T08:28:00.000Z	compengi	francois	okay, then do you know how to install the newest plugin for firefox?
2007-02-05T08:29:00.000Z	francois	compengi	if you install the flash plugin, firefox should just find it
2007-02-05T08:29:00.000Z	francois	compengi	or you can just update firefox,
2007-02-05T08:30:00.000Z	compengi	francois	i have flashplugin-nonfree installed with other libraries from GPL flash
2007-02-05T08:30:00.000Z	francois	compengi	ok, did you get it from adobe.com ? or apt-get ?
