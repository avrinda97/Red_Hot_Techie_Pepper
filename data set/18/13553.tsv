2005-11-06T14:01:00.000Z	Melee		that was  my plan
2005-11-06T14:02:00.000Z	Melee		I swear, someone should make a gigantic slide show for linux or something
2005-11-06T14:02:00.000Z	Melee		I'm in way over my head
2005-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	Melee		hey
2005-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	Melee		everyone likes pictures
2005-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Melee		nope
2005-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Melee		it works
2005-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Melee		thanks guys
2005-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Melee		and I'm serious, I'm gonna make a slide show when I figure this stuff out in five or fifty years
2005-11-06T14:06:00.000Z	Melee		Oh, we'll probably be dead or something by then, I'm sure.  See, it requires me figuring out how to use linux first
2005-11-06T14:06:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	that's good i think ut2004 on linux crashed a bit less then it does on windows me thinks
2005-11-06T14:08:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	if you ever get stuck there is a UT2004 tweaking guide on linux-gamers.net: http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=40
2005-11-06T14:10:00.000Z	Melee	LivingTarget	 Thanks for the site
2005-11-06T14:22:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	make that "linux install.sh" most likely :)
2005-11-06T14:33:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	it installs in /usr/local/games/ut2004/ go there and look for the file named ut2004 and try and run it
2005-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	if that doesn't work you might need to run it through the terminal in that directory: ./ut2004 yes that is a dot-slash
2005-11-06T14:36:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	did you install it somewhere else?
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	LivingTarget	Melee	ok :)
