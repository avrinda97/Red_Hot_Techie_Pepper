2006-04-02T11:02:00.000Z	fyrebat	spiderworm	ah, I thought it was working- I'm installing wine, and it was installing for a long time. Then it aborted the install with the message "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext"
2006-04-02T11:02:00.000Z	spiderworm	fyrebat	how are you going about installing wine?
2006-04-02T11:03:00.000Z	fyrebat	spiderworm	I downloaded a wine folder, then from command line I type: "./tools/wineinstall

2006-04-02T11:05:00.000Z	spiderworm	fyrebat	go to this page: http://winehq.org/site/download-deb  .... there's instructions there for getting the precompiled binaries using apt & synaptic
2006-04-02T11:05:00.000Z	spiderworm	fyrebat	basically you need to add some repos, then update, then install wine with synaptic
2006-04-02T11:07:00.000Z	fyrebat	spiderworm	I installed ubuntu last week, so plz excuse my ignorance. What is a repo, and what is synaptic?
