2009-04-25T03:57:00.000Z	matrix_		can anyone help me hello
2009-04-25T03:57:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	do you have drivers installed for your hraphics card/
2009-04-25T03:58:00.000Z	matrix_	h00k	you mean nvidia drivers
2009-04-25T03:58:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	yes, you have those installed and activated?
2009-04-25T03:59:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	is it active?
2009-04-25T03:59:00.000Z	matrix_	h00k	how can i see my nvidia is activated
2009-04-25T03:59:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	check out System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2009-04-25T04:01:00.000Z	matrix_	h00k	it shows nvidia version 180 recommended is activated
2009-04-25T04:01:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	if it's active, you'll see a green light, have you restarted since you've activated it?
2009-04-25T04:02:00.000Z	matrix_	h00k	you mean to restart ubuntu to activate nvidia i did that when i installed ubuntu
2009-04-25T04:11:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	how high quality of movies are you playing?
2009-04-25T04:11:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	I've seen that with movies that are in 1080p and the processor simply cannot handle it
2009-04-25T04:12:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	so, its only an avi.  what do you have for a processor and how much memory do you have?
2009-04-25T04:14:00.000Z	h00k	matrix_	try mplayer, it also might be the file itself
