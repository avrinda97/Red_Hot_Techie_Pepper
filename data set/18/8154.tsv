2007-12-19T22:28:00.000Z	foso		hey guys, put the live cd on my dads comp to try to get him to try it, now it wont start up like it should, it keeps stopping while the xp logo is showing and the progress bar just stops
2007-12-19T22:28:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	the xp logo should not be showing--you may need to tell your bios to boot from the cd
2007-12-19T22:29:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	it already booted from the cd, im trying to put it back to normal now
2007-12-19T22:33:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	not sure what you mean: put it back to normal? did you install anything or just use the live cd? restart the computer and take out the cd and xp will startup again
2007-12-19T22:37:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	dad started out on dos, then moved on to windows, still using xp, so i put the live cd in to show him ubuntu, just trying to get him to mess with it, took it out, tried to restart and it keeps freezing up
2007-12-19T22:38:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	windows keeps freezing? and you did not install anything? hmmm. might be a windows problem
2007-12-19T22:50:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	thats what i figured
2007-12-19T22:52:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	it's kind of offtopic to talk about windows problems here (actually waaaay offtopic); perhaps you can convince him that this is why you should use ub untu? :}
2007-12-19T22:52:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	i came here to see if it was a common problem
2007-12-19T22:53:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	hes convinced that ubuntu broke it, so....
2007-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	try to boot from the ubuntu live cd again--it may be a hardware problem; if not then it may be that the windows box is completely compromised--a not uncommon occurrence
2007-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	something is messed up with the computer already, it randomly shuts down, what would cause that?
2007-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	hardware issues
2007-12-19T23:00:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	anything in particular?
2007-12-19T23:00:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	probably best ask in ##windows
2007-12-19T23:10:00.000Z	foso	bazhang	booting from the cd and restarting after that fixed it, Jack_Sparrow, going to the windows thing to see if they can help me stop it from happening again thanks guys
2007-12-19T23:11:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	glad to hear
2007-12-19T23:14:00.000Z	bazhang	foso	time to switch hehe
