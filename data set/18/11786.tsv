2011-10-30T04:25:00.000Z	Name141		is it possible to get back to the actual Gnome look ('ubuntu-classic' another words) in 11.10 ?
2011-10-30T04:26:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	before you login, select 'gnome-classic'
2011-10-30T04:26:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	I thought it was taking out in 11.10 ?
2011-10-30T04:27:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	I don't think its removed, but I may be wrong.
2011-10-30T04:28:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	http://linux-software-news-tutorials.blogspot.com/2011/10/ubuntu-1110-oneiric-remove-unity-and.html , maybe this will do it ?
2011-10-30T04:32:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	I think I'll check it out in a virtual machine first.  Then if I can't figure anything I'll go with Xubuntu or something more resonable than unity before I go ahead and do the partitions and dual boot .
2011-10-30T04:33:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	you could boot from livecd also (rather than VM), but same difference.
2011-10-30T04:33:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	I'm just trying to ween myself off of XP before 2014.. and thought I might as well anyway since it's so old.
2011-10-30T04:34:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	well you carry on then :)
2011-10-30T04:34:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	yeah lol.  I'm just wondering if this machine would be better running a 'smaller' one ?  (like xubuntu anyway)
2011-10-30T04:35:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	Ubuntu today requires some decent hardware.  Lubuntu is the lightest weight of them all, Xubuntu would be next.
2011-10-30T04:36:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	E2160 should be decent enough? Yet the CelronD single core in the living room seems faster sometimes :/
2011-10-30T04:37:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	thats a decent enough proc for sure.
2011-10-30T04:38:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	Has ubuntu gotten any worse since hardy? in terms of needing processor/GPU power ? I was running that before I started getting in to PC gaming.
2011-10-30T04:40:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	depends on your definition of worseu
2011-10-30T04:41:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	"needs more 'power'"
2011-10-30T04:41:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Name141	then yes it does/is.
2011-10-30T04:42:00.000Z	Name141	Jeruvy	I guess the only thing to do is to try it..
