2011-03-26T09:28:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	bonjoyee: back from reboot. no change?
2011-03-26T09:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
2011-03-26T09:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	did you add the 2nd line I gave to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
2011-03-26T09:39:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	i did, rebooted, no change, then switched it to bonjoyee's option one, also no change
2011-03-26T09:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	try changing the model to: model=laptop
2011-03-26T09:40:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	to bonjoyee's or to yours?
2011-03-26T09:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	whatever the model= says currently, change it to laptop
2011-03-26T09:40:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	so now i have "options snd_hda_intel model=laptop" as the added line in alsa-base.conf
2011-03-26T09:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	if that doesn't work then try changing it to generic
2011-03-26T09:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	I also recommend you upgrade your alsa to 1.0.23 with: http://monespaceperso.org/blog-en/2010/05/02/upgrade-alsa-1-0-23-on-ubuntu-lucid-lynx-10-04/
2011-03-26T09:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	reboot to test inbetween
2011-03-26T09:42:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	that upgrade looks complicated..
2011-03-26T09:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sheena	its step by step....
2011-03-26T09:43:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	yes, it is. just very long for an upgrade. i can do it tomorrow sometime though.
2011-03-26T09:44:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	rebooting again.
2011-03-26T09:46:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	no change with "laptop"
2011-03-26T09:47:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	i guess i could try with generic, but i think i'll leave it for tonight and try again tomorrow. is it possible its a hardware issue?
2011-03-26T09:54:00.000Z	sheena	ActionParsnip	have we done anything that might cause unexpected reboots?
