2006-05-20T15:40:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	uh
2006-05-20T15:42:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	yes I want to hide my realdomain to protect the innocence ;)
2006-05-20T15:43:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	you sure that tje /etc/apache2/sotes-enabled/mydomain.com file is *readable* ?
2006-05-20T15:44:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	the permission is 644 on that file
2006-05-20T15:46:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	take out the <Directory> tags
2006-05-20T15:47:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	you're missing some lines at the top of your default config, in theory
2006-05-20T15:48:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	just a min let me paste the whole file again
2006-05-20T15:50:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	it's here: http://rafb.net/paste/results/HBBujr23.html
2006-05-20T15:52:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	did you try taking out the <Directory> tags in the 'mydomain.com
2006-05-20T15:53:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	aha! I figured it out now ;)
2006-05-20T15:53:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	what was the issue?
2006-05-20T15:53:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	adding ServerName localhost to that default file solved it
2006-05-20T15:53:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	weird
2006-05-20T15:54:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	I guess the reason is my hostname is set to mydomain.com
2006-05-20T15:54:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	and not having a ServerName in default let it assume that localhost is mydomain.com
2006-05-20T15:55:00.000Z	Overand	thinkpad	interesting
2006-05-20T15:55:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	so the default file listen to localhost and all its names configured in /etc/hosts
2006-05-20T15:55:00.000Z	thinkpad	Overand	at least this is how I understand it now
