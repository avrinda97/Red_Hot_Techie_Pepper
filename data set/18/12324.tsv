2006-05-03T11:16:00.000Z	houlala		i can go on irc servers but not on internet ...
2006-05-03T11:17:00.000Z	houlala		someone can see me ?
2006-05-03T11:17:00.000Z	eck	houlala	ipv4 connections should be tunneled through ipv6
2006-05-03T11:17:00.000Z	houlala		k, but i need to be in ipv4
2006-05-03T11:18:00.000Z	houlala		and i forget how to switch ...
2006-05-03T11:19:00.000Z	eck	houlala	I don't really know much about ipv6, but I think it is an option in ifconfig
2006-05-03T11:19:00.000Z	houlala		nop
2006-05-03T11:20:00.000Z	houlala		i have to modifiy the /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
2006-05-03T11:20:00.000Z	houlala		but i can't access to internet to help myself >_<
2006-05-03T11:21:00.000Z	houlala		i don't understand *french* :s
2006-05-03T11:21:00.000Z	eck	houlala	if you can get onto irc i would imagine that the problem is some firewall setting
2006-05-03T11:22:00.000Z	eck	houlala	if you want to disable ipv6 though you can try modprobe -r ipv6
2006-05-03T11:22:00.000Z	houlala	eck	i don't have firewall
2006-05-03T11:22:00.000Z	houlala	eck	> ipv6 is in use
2006-05-03T11:22:00.000Z	houlala	eck	i remeber that i need to edit the /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
