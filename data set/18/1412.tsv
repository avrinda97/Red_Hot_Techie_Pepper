2011-02-26T23:06:00.000Z	UBXUER		hello
2011-02-26T23:06:00.000Z	UBXUER		i'm facing a huge probelm
2011-02-26T23:07:00.000Z	UBXUER		on windows, my connection speed is 600kb/sec, on ubuntu <100kb/sec... it was fine this morning
2011-02-26T23:07:00.000Z	UBXUER		all my download and everyhing on ubuntu is really slow...
2011-02-26T23:08:00.000Z	UBXUER		my upload speed is the same on both the machine
2011-02-26T23:08:00.000Z	UBXUER		its only my download.. i feel like ubuntu randomly is limiting my transfer rate
2011-02-26T23:09:00.000Z	UBXUER		so?
2011-02-26T23:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UBXUER	try running: lspci    and search for your network chip to see if there are any bugs logged for it
2011-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	UBXUER	ActionParsnip	my 'network chip' was fine this morning..
2011-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UBXUER	i assume the device is integrated into the system and isnt usb based
2011-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	UBXUER		yes.. i'm on a notebook
2011-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UBXUER	well it's not now is it. What changed since/
2011-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	UBXUER		maybe..
2011-02-26T23:12:00.000Z	UBXUER		i started the program inssider
2011-02-26T23:12:00.000Z	UBXUER		it was installed before but i ran it today
2011-02-26T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UBXUER	ok try without it running
2011-02-26T23:12:00.000Z	UBXUER		yea.. i tried that.. 3 time reboot..made no difference ran sudo dhclient wlan0 which usually fixes the problem but isn't working any more
2011-02-26T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UBXUER	a BIOS update may help too. also read the dmesg of the bootup to see if any firmware files are being used
