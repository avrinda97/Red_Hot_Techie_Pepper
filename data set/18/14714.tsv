2005-06-24T11:30:00.000Z	brett		Can anyone help me set my 'default gateway device' so that I don't have to manually set it every time I boot?
2005-06-24T11:30:00.000Z	bob2	brett	it didn't ask you during the install?
2005-06-24T11:31:00.000Z	bob2	brett	please don't /msg people
2005-06-24T11:32:00.000Z	bob2	brett	I don't know about the gui tools, the correct fix would be adding a gateway line in /etc/network/interfaces
2005-06-24T11:33:00.000Z	brett	bob2	I think we're not talking about the same thing.  I'm not talking about my default gateway (IP address), I'm talking about the default network interface (in my case wlan0)
2005-06-24T11:34:00.000Z	bob2	brett	whichever interface has the gateway line in /etc/network/interfaces is the default interface
2005-06-24T11:35:00.000Z	brett	bob2	It should be that way, yes, but it's not working that way for me.
2005-06-24T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	brett	paste your /etc/network/interfaces to #flood
2005-06-24T11:39:00.000Z	brett	bob2	done
2005-06-24T11:39:00.000Z	bob2	brett	hrm, ok
2005-06-24T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	brett	I think commenting out the last 3 lines will fix it
2005-06-24T11:40:00.000Z	brett	bob2	actually... someone suggested that would solve my problem!  so, it doesn't work either way.
2005-06-24T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	brett	well, that should bring it up for you, I don't know why it wouldn't work
2005-06-24T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	brett	maybe someone on the user list might know
2005-06-24T11:43:00.000Z	brett	bob2	The interface is brought up (sorta?) but it doesn't work until I set the 'default gateway device' to 'wlan0' in the GUI tool
2005-06-24T11:44:00.000Z	bob2	brett	I don't know what the gui tool does, unfortunately
2005-06-24T11:44:00.000Z	brett	bob2	neither do I ;]   Thanks for giving it a whirl though
2005-06-24T11:55:00.000Z	brett	bob2	I think wlan0 does eventually come up automatically, just takes a long time (1-2min) to kick in.
