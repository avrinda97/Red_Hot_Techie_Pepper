2012-03-08T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Valrin	can you see what is meant to happen though? can you make it occur without me being 100% accurate?
2012-03-08T10:55:00.000Z	Valrin	ActionParsnip	I dunno man, I've tried so many different things to try and get this damn thing to work and nothing seems to be getting the job done.
2012-03-08T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Valrin	you just need to open the file you named in your error in a text file.
2012-03-08T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Valrin	run gedit and you can open the file there.
2012-03-08T10:58:00.000Z	Valrin	ActionParsnip	I used gedit, and it won't let me do anything.
2012-03-08T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Valrin	click file -> open .  click file system on the left. open etc, open apt, open sources.list.d
