2006-10-14T12:10:00.000Z	Hoagie		Hi everyone. Was hoping someone here could answer a question or two :) Thinking of getting a laptop and slapping linux on it, and several people recommended Ubuntu to me.
2006-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	Hoagie		Ehh. Sorry. Was mostly wondering how customisable the interface etc is. I've been using windows since forever, and the bleedin' update thing pushed me over the edge last night.
2006-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	Hoagie		I might just be blind, but I can't find much on it >_>
2006-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	if you want to explore ubuntu, just burn yourself a live-cd! Then you can pop the disc in the CD drive and it will boot to ubuntu without touching your hard drive. When you finish exploring, just take it out, reboot, and all is as you left it!
2006-10-14T12:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	all the default Ubuntu installation CDs are liveCDs.
2006-10-14T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	as to your question, the interface is infinitely customisable. For starters, ubuntu offers three flavours with different desktops - kubuntu (KDE desktop), ubuntu (GNOME desktop), xubuntu (XFCE desktop -- lightweight for old computers). Both KDE and GNOME themselves are infinitely customisable, and if you don't like them you can install any window manager you like --  fluxbox, icewm, twm, etc.
2006-10-14T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Someone tell me if that cut off, the ending was supposed to be "fluxbox, icewm, twm, etc."
2006-10-14T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	I suggest you break out wikipedia and look up articles for KDE, GNOME, and XFCE.
2006-10-14T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	or google image search,
2006-10-14T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex		.
2006-10-14T12:16:00.000Z	Hoagie	ArrenLex	Will do! :) Thanks a lot for the help!
2006-10-14T12:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	But remember that all of these desktops are a LOT more customisable than Explorer, so don't think you're tied down to what you see -- you can make it look like anything!
2006-10-14T12:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Hoagie	But again, I strongly recommend burning yourself a kubuntu and ubuntu livecd and seeing if they suit you and which you like more.

2006-10-14T12:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex		I'm confused. What are you asking?
2006-10-14T12:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Oh. It's my writing pseudonym. It's based on my name -- Alex.
2006-10-14T12:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Arren Lex.
2006-10-14T12:19:00.000Z	Hoagie	ArrenLex	Thanks a lot :) I will! *Tips cap* I'd best get to accidentally blowing up my CD burner then.
