2011-08-08T23:02:00.000Z	silverarrow		any mac-linux people here?
2011-08-08T23:03:00.000Z	silverarrow		is there a way to burn iso on a mac?
2011-08-08T23:03:00.000Z	silverarrow		gparted, erase and formate
2011-08-08T23:04:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	was that to me ?
2011-08-08T23:04:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	sorry yes
2011-08-08T23:04:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	whhats this gparted thing? can you go a bit more step by step or give me a guide to follow ?
2011-08-08T23:06:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	?
2011-08-08T23:07:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	gparted is a partitioning tool, it is there in the live CDs on Ubuntu and Linux, but can be downloaded an burned for separate boot up cd too
2011-08-08T23:08:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	i can use that even if i used the "install on windows" thing ?
2011-08-08T23:08:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	yes
2011-08-08T23:08:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	but you might have to fuzz a bit with grub
2011-08-08T23:08:00.000Z	noneabove		silverarow, and theres no other way with wubi? just want to make sure before i go out and find my usb or a cd haha
2011-08-08T23:10:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	there might be, do you have a windows recovery cd? At least it can erase and reformate with ntfs file system
2011-08-08T23:11:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	well i mean ive been able to uninstall it using wubi but for some reason every time i reinstall the same problem comes back (it gets stuck in boot up once in awhile, then when i install the driver for my graphics card it says i can no longer use unity)
2011-08-08T23:12:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	hmm, I'm not shore why you get that
2011-08-08T23:12:00.000Z	silverarrow	noneabove	though I have had similar happen to me
2011-08-08T23:13:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	yea it was all fine until i tried to install more drivers from my graphics card the other day because i have a switchable graphics card so i wanted it using the good one, then all of a sudden it switched out of unity, and then when i reinstalled it gets stuck on a boot screen after i do the updates (like when you install and run first time theres updates it asks you to install)
2011-08-08T23:17:00.000Z	noneabove	silverarrow	gonna try ANOTHER install, one last time, see if it works...
