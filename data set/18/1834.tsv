2010-10-26T00:45:00.000Z	Celtibero		Hi, would you please tell me of a good software for Ubuntu that can solve mathematic operations (equations)?
2010-10-26T00:45:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	wolframalpha :)
2010-10-26T00:45:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	otherwise maple I guess
2010-10-26T00:46:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	does it have to be free? otherwise mathematica is very good
2010-10-26T00:46:00.000Z	Celtibero	qorep	Can those solve simple fractions operations?
2010-10-26T00:46:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	guess you could always torrent it
2010-10-26T00:46:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	wolframalpha can, and that's right in your browser
2010-10-26T00:47:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve+%28x%2B3%29%2F%28x%2B9%29+%3D+%28x-1%29%2F%28x%2B2%29
2010-10-26T00:49:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	did you try wolframalpha?
2010-10-26T00:49:00.000Z	Celtibero	qorep	I'm looking for it.
2010-10-26T00:49:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	I linked it ;) http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve+%28x%2B3%29%2F%28x%2B9%29+%3D+%28x-1%29%2F%28x%2B2%29
2010-10-26T00:50:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	you just put your stuff in the entry box there, and it does the magic
2010-10-26T00:50:00.000Z	Celtibero	qorep	Oh, sorry, thank you very much.
2010-10-26T00:51:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	try the "show steps" button
2010-10-26T00:51:00.000Z	Celtibero	qorep	Thank you very very much, this is great!
2010-10-26T00:51:00.000Z	qorep	Celtibero	I recommend playing around with it some if it's for math homework, so you see what's going on and learn how to solve it yourself
2010-10-26T00:52:00.000Z	Celtibero	qorep	Definitely
2010-10-26T00:52:00.000Z	Celtibero	qorep	You're right
