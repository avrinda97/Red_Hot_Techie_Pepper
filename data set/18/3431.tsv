2009-10-18T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	you'd have to ask adobe as it's proprietary...
2009-10-18T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	not really... but as ubottu said you can use it through wine
2009-10-18T17:57:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	thats useless
2009-10-18T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	ou really do mean shockwave?  Not flash?
2009-10-18T17:57:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	i got flash, i talk about shockwave
2009-10-18T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	right, so your only option is to use firefox through wine.  Not sure why you think it's useless.  It would let you use shockwave if you need to...
2009-10-18T17:58:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	i have to use firefox through wine right? and that DOSNT looks good
2009-10-18T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	right.  Why doesn't it look good exactly?
2009-10-18T18:00:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	well, ubuntu softwares got another interface then windows softwares i guess. so a windows software on a ubuntu os cant look good..
2009-10-18T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	I don't understand what you mean by "can't look good".  If you need shockwave then it is your option
2009-10-18T18:01:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	and if i should get windows firefox for ubuntu then why do i use ubuntu and not windows?
2009-10-18T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	you should use ubuntu if you want to use ubuntu.  If all you do on your computer is view shockwave in firefox, then yes it would make no sense for you to use Ubuntu
2009-10-18T18:03:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	forget this i dont need shockwave so much that i install win firefox through wine
2009-10-18T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	k
2009-10-18T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	j1mp492	you could just keep both around and when you come to a site that you need startup the wine firefox
2009-10-18T18:04:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	gonna complain to the fking adobe bastards
2009-10-18T18:04:00.000Z	j1mp492	jrib	hmm.. maybe
