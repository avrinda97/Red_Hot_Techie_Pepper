2008-07-21T19:01:00.000Z	yereth		hrmm.. I get these errors in my syslog every few minutes:
2008-07-21T19:02:00.000Z	yereth		Jul 21 15:58:54 server winbindd[8560]: [2008/07/21 15:58:54, 0] libsmb/clientgen.c:cli_receive_smb(112)
2008-07-21T19:02:00.000Z	yereth		Jul 21 15:58:54 server winbindd[8560]:   Receiving SMB: Server stopped responding
2008-07-21T19:02:00.000Z	yereth		and then access to the samba server is lagging a few seconds
2008-07-21T19:02:00.000Z	yereth		anyone any clue what's wrong there?
2008-07-21T19:03:00.000Z	yereth		anyone?
2008-07-21T19:04:00.000Z	kevinO	yereth	sounds like the samba server your connecting to stops responding "Server stopped responding" but thats just a guess
2008-07-21T19:04:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	I've noticed it stops responding
2008-07-21T19:05:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	but why?
2008-07-21T19:05:00.000Z	kevinO	yereth	is the remote samba server yours?
2008-07-21T19:05:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	I put the output on verbose, but it doesn't show me more info
2008-07-21T19:05:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	yes
2008-07-21T19:07:00.000Z	kevinO	yereth	im not really sure as i do not know that much about smb but I would check error logs on the remote server and see if that gives any info
2008-07-21T19:08:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	I was checking those, but this was all I could dig up in the /var/log/syslog .. the samba logs didn't show me anything interesting
2008-07-21T19:08:00.000Z	kevinO	yereth	i would stick around and ask someone else.
2008-07-21T19:08:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	cheers ;)
2008-07-21T19:09:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	obviously :P
2008-07-21T19:09:00.000Z	yereth	kevinO	thanks anyway mate
