2009-09-08T17:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	yes
2009-10-01T10:23:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	Nope...Scientists did a study and found the moon has nothing to do with people going crazy
2009-10-01T10:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	possible :)
2009-10-01T10:25:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	I honestly think the reason for people's craziness is just the change in the weather
2009-10-01T10:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	freenode
2009-10-01T10:28:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	Yeah...I'm wondering how the Linux community gets money for its maintenance and stuff...Surely people are paid to contribute
2009-10-01T10:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	very few are paid. compared to the amount of people who contribute to make linux what it is ( for free )
2009-10-01T10:29:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	So Linux is strictly a voluntary effort?
2009-10-01T10:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	mostly
2009-10-01T10:30:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	but not strictly
2009-10-01T10:31:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	i'm sure jussi01 could point you to a few good sites explaining all this but a good start is the Ubuntu philosophy on ubuntu.com this is offtopic for this channel.
2009-10-01T10:31:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	Here's a question that's more on-topic...Is there any place a newbie could go to learn the inner-workings of Ubuntu?
2009-10-01T10:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	this channel is a great place to learn. the ubuntu wiki and forums. there is also Launchpad. I mean this answer  is not the best one but google is a great tool :-)
2009-10-01T10:33:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	I've been using Ubuntu full-time since June of 2009, but I do not feel like I am learning anything because I'm so dependent on the GUI.
2009-10-17T05:24:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	I use nVidia cards.  They work fine with Ubuntu.  All I have to do is enable proprietary drivers.  My card is several generations older than his
2009-10-17T05:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	mnaines	ok, just thought that list was an accurate if not complete list he could check
2009-10-17T05:26:00.000Z	mnaines	IdleOne	Yeah.  Usually when it comes to post-7800-series nVidia cards, there aren't many problems with Ubuntu.  All you have to do is enable proprietary drivers
