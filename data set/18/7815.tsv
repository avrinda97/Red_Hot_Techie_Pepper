2012-05-25T20:46:00.000Z	yggdrasil		good day, i have a lenovo w510 with 12.4 and i cant get my secondary display working ..anyone have suggestions ?
2012-05-25T20:46:00.000Z	sfears	yggdrasil	have you looked in the display control panel?
2012-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	yggdrasil	sfears	yes, it doesnt show up there.
2012-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	yggdrasil		only the internal display is there.
2012-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	sfears		look on your f1-f12 keys. is there a logo of a display on any of them? you may have to use the fn or ctrl key to turn on the secondary monitor.  laptops disable by default to save power
2012-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	yggdrasil	sfears	yea tried that too..
2012-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	sfears	yggdrasil	have you looked in the additional drivers application to make sure you have non-generic drivers installed?
2012-05-25T20:49:00.000Z	yggdrasil	sfears	yes, i have loaded the two different versions that are presented to me in the additional drivers and rebooted with both. no go :(
2012-05-25T20:49:00.000Z	yggdrasil		ive googled and cant seem to find anything either.
2012-05-25T20:51:00.000Z	sfears	yggdrasil	what video card are you using?

2012-05-25T20:54:00.000Z	sfears	yggdrasil	in the display control panel is there a second monitor picture displayed at all?  are you 100% that the 2nd monitor is plugged in? does it say no signal?
