2012-06-06T12:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		the cups web interface, or printer config tools have a checkbox to allow/share the printers
2012-06-06T12:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		check your cups logs.
2012-06-06T12:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		you may want to be sure samba is working if its shareing to a windows machine
2012-06-06T12:49:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	I would like to edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf to allow one specific other host to print via my computer
2012-06-06T12:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danabr	 i belive the web interface gives you a gui for doing that. i never limit my home lan that way
2012-06-06T12:50:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	Let me give you the full picture...
2012-06-06T12:51:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	We have a local network with one Ubuntu machine that is connected to the external network.
2012-06-06T12:51:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	That same machine is also connected (via wireless) to some printers on the local network
2012-06-06T12:53:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	Now, I would like to allow a specific machine on the external network (static ip) to submit printjobs via lpr to the Ubuntu server
2012-06-06T12:53:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	Does that clarify the question?
2012-06-06T12:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danabr	 over the internet you mean?
2012-06-06T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danabr	 could do a ssh tunnle. Im not sure how cups security features would work across the internets. Never needed that feature
2012-06-06T12:55:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	SSH port forwarding sounds like an interesting idea
2012-06-06T12:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danabr	 cups may have some features to do that allready. but ive never used them. check the cups.org homepage/docs perhaps. or askubuntu.com
2012-06-06T12:56:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	So I would set up a tunnel from some local port on the webserver, to the print servers port 631. Then I would run lpr towards my local port. Would CUPS allow that?
2012-06-06T12:58:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	Ok. Thanks for your help, I will try with port forwarding.
2012-06-06T13:22:00.000Z	danabr	Dr_Willis	I've read quite a bit of CUPS documentation, and it is indeed not very nice to printing newbies
2012-06-06T13:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danabr	 you are doing somthing complex.. and cups Is a 'business class' tool. for local/home ussage my cups machines all see eatch other and  getting printing going is just a few clicks.. or even less at times
