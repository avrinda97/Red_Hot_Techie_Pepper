2009-05-21T03:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	no thank me for triggering those two
2009-05-21T03:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	if you want Windows,  and your computer has enough RAM, and you don't want to 3D Windows game or some such, you can run it inside Ubuntu
2009-05-21T04:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	yes there aren't really any viruses for Linux at this time,  and to get malicious programs installed you would have to install yourself,  or  have your computer broken into and have them do it
2009-05-21T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	,but whatever OS your on you should have a firewall
2009-05-21T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	for example one enabled in your router
2009-05-21T04:02:00.000Z	i2go	sebsebseb	does ubuntu has plugNplay?
2009-05-21T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	and a good idea to have a good password that isn't say abc123
2009-05-21T04:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	most hardware works rather well with Ubuntu, but not everything, because of stupid hardware manufactures and lack of Linux support
2009-05-21T04:03:00.000Z	i2go	sebsebseb	i have a wireless router and card as well im kinda worry about that
2009-05-21T04:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	is it atheros?
2009-05-21T04:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	you can try  your hardware on the Live CD before installing from that CD as well
2009-05-21T04:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	if it works on the live session no problem, then you should be fine, if not,  you will have to probably set it up
2009-05-21T04:05:00.000Z	i2go	sebsebseb	i have netgear router and linksys card
2009-05-21T04:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	i2go	I think it will work well,  as I said you try on Live CD, once you got one and booted the computer from it
2009-05-21T04:06:00.000Z	i2go	sebsebseb	how do you guys download songs or movies? what do you guys use?
