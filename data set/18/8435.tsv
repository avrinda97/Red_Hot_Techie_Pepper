2008-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	Devourer		Can Ubuntu format a flash drive?
2008-03-13T05:56:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	yes. put it in, DONT mount it, and type mkdosfs /dev/[device]
2008-03-13T05:56:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	will that make it FAT32?
2008-03-13T05:56:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	think fat16
2008-03-13T05:57:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	is that standard?
2008-03-13T05:57:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	i think so, yes. you ought to try, if it doenst work in your camera/mp3 player/... you can do fat32 manually. but fat16 is standard
2008-03-13T05:57:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	thanks.
2008-03-13T06:03:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	correct.
2008-03-13T06:04:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	I was thinking that in my head.
2008-03-13T06:08:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	it spit this out at me. :( mkdosfs: Will not try to make filesystem on full-disk device '/dev/sdf' (use -I if wanted)
2008-03-13T06:09:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	thats funny. never seen that before, sorry... :/
2008-03-13T06:09:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	:'(
2008-03-13T06:10:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	well, it is formatted as something else at the moment. It's has a vfat or fat12 file system right now I think.
2008-03-13T06:10:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	so try what it says: use -I if wanted
2008-03-13T06:12:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	it worked. :D
2008-03-13T06:12:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	nice =) sometimes it helps to just follow =)
2008-03-13T06:12:00.000Z	Devourer	damaltor	I didn't want anything to blow upl
2008-03-13T06:13:00.000Z	damaltor	Devourer	but would have been funny too...
