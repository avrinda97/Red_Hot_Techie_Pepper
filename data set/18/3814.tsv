2009-07-26T05:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976		Isn't there a way to get into cups via firefox?  localhost"4403 isn't it, but I thought it was something along those lines.  Also, anyone got an okidata microline320 working in ubuntu?
2009-07-26T05:32:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	localhost:631
2009-07-26T05:33:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	do you know what the username and password is by default?
2009-07-26T05:33:00.000Z	mido1		craig: root and your root pw.
2009-07-26T05:35:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	aha.  Further, (and I know this would be the case in Windows) should I reboot now that the printer is plugged in?  Test prints aren't working, but it did see it.  The only other time I've hooked up one of these was parallel, not usb
2009-07-26T05:36:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	Just leave Ubuntu running ;-)
2009-07-26T05:36:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	No need to reboot for a printer or something.
2009-07-26T05:36:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	Why don't you use the normal printer setup tool from ubuntu?
2009-07-26T05:36:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	I thought it would be fine.  Just checking; I fixed a windows box for someone last night and got into the habit again :P
2009-07-26T05:36:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	it never asked to set up.  I went into printers, and there it was
2009-07-26T05:37:00.000Z	mido1		Ah, then it was auto-detected
2009-07-26T05:37:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	Okay, and why exactly do you now want to fiddle with cups?
2009-07-26T05:38:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	I didn't know if something was messed up in the gui testing area.  Thought I'd try right from cups.  Still no love though
2009-07-26T05:38:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	'kay, it's late in the eavening here: Ubuntu did autoconfigure your printer. It did print the test page correctly. What is bothering you?
2009-07-26T05:39:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	no test page.
2009-07-26T05:40:00.000Z	mido1	craigbass1976	Okay, the printer is listed in the list of printers, correct?
2009-07-26T05:41:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	got it.  I shut it off and turned it back on, just started a test page.
2009-07-26T05:41:00.000Z	craigbass1976	mido1	wow, the test page printing makes me think my cat got stuck in there-- lots of straight horizontal lines.
