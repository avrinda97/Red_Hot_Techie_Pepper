2006-06-19T12:18:00.000Z	skybox		I have a VERY weird problem, a few minutes ago I could browse one of my favo sites (binsearch.info) now it won't even load, hell I can't even ping it, but it works for evryone else, how is that possible?
2006-06-19T12:18:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	Does not sound weird, sounds like the machine you are trying to reach went down
2006-06-19T12:18:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	or rather, your route to it
2006-06-19T12:18:00.000Z	skybox	Lynoure	but it works for evryone else
2006-06-19T12:19:00.000Z	skybox		try it, binsearch.info
2006-06-19T12:19:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	As I'm not sitting in your lap, my route is not your route
2006-06-19T12:19:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	Do other sites still work?
2006-06-19T12:19:00.000Z	skybox	Lynoure	hmm I see, I  don't understand what your saying though, yeah other sites works
2006-06-19T12:20:00.000Z	skybox		maybe i should just wait then :S ?
2006-06-19T12:20:00.000Z	skybox		like I said I can't even ping it, but it works for evryone else
2006-06-19T12:21:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	Imagine internet connected by a network of thin lines. My set of lines is different from yours as I am elsewhere. There might be a line missing in yours, a dead end. (Was that more clear?) But do a traceroute se see it better
2006-06-19T12:21:00.000Z	Lynoure		s/se/to
2006-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	skybox		lynoure, so what you're saying is , my connection/pipe to binsearch is down etc? ok doing route now
2006-06-19T12:23:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	Of courge they might have just started hating you and blocked your incoming from their firewall but I'd put my money on a temporary network problem not specifically related to your computer
2006-06-19T12:23:00.000Z	skybox		lynoure, how do I trace route?
2006-06-19T12:23:00.000Z	skybox	Lynoure	heh :P yeah, how do I trace route?
2006-06-19T12:24:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	first you need to install traceroute...
2006-06-19T12:24:00.000Z	Lynoure	skybox	after that it can be just    traceroute hostename
