2008-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	jaem		not according to ATI's website
2008-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	jaem		it's still for X <=7.3
2008-10-24T13:34:00.000Z	jaem		huh
2008-10-24T13:36:00.000Z	jaem		that's the web page
2008-10-24T13:37:00.000Z	jaem		ergo the text/html - it /is/ html
2008-10-24T13:37:00.000Z	jaem		you need the link to the actual stream
2008-10-24T13:37:00.000Z	jaem		give me a sec
2008-10-24T13:38:00.000Z	jaem		well, first of all, these are video streams, so internet radio won't work for the links on that page
2008-10-24T13:38:00.000Z	[mbm]	jaem	they do a stupid user agent switching trick
2008-10-24T13:38:00.000Z	jaem		sorry - I don't see a radio link
2008-10-24T13:39:00.000Z	jaem		mbm: are you saying I should switch my UA to see what ubuntu_todd is seeing?
2008-10-24T13:40:00.000Z	jaem		sorry
2008-10-24T13:41:00.000Z	jaem		yeah... I just missed the obvious
2008-10-24T13:43:00.000Z	jaem	ubuntu_todd	sorry - I don't have RealPlayer installed, and I don't want to have it installed... here's the basics, though
2008-10-24T13:43:00.000Z	jaem		they don't provide a direct link... so you have to find it
2008-10-24T13:44:00.000Z	jaem		load the RealAudio radio page, right-click, and select "view source"
2008-10-24T13:44:00.000Z	jaem		scratch that
2008-10-24T13:44:00.000Z	[mbm]	jaem	the aspx url is correct, but the server will spit out html if it doesn't think the client is the correct player
