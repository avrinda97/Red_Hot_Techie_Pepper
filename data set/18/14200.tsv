2005-10-14T05:12:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		this is annoying... does anyone know how to get around the error message "No valide device!" on boot-up? Windows does not recognise my SATA HD and neither does LiveCD, but the bios chucks up the device name and its capacity along with that error message
2005-10-14T05:13:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	you should try moving your SATA connector to another channel on your motherboard.
2005-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	are you overclocking?
2005-10-14T05:17:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	hmm...what kinda HDD is it? if Hitachi Deskstar when did you buy it?
2005-10-14T05:19:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	hm. If your BIOS is showing an error message, could be a bad HDD.
2005-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	also want to make sure that your SATA cable doesn't have any tight radius turns, it'll kill transfer speeds horribly.
2005-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	and could, possible, interfere with connectivity.
2005-10-14T05:21:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	well, did you install SATA drivers in windows?
2005-10-14T05:23:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	hmm...think you accidentally fried it while moving it around?
2005-10-14T05:25:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	well, static (but that's probably not it). Did you like pull out a power cable while it was in use, or shake it while it was being used or anything?
2005-10-14T05:27:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	well if the HDD was shot you'd have a very slim chance of getting that far; reading/writing would be crapped. hmm...have you tried changing the cable? (you said you changed the slot it was plugged into on the mobo right? what mobo you have anyways?)
2005-10-14T05:30:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	i guess you could try either flashing the BIOS or reinstalling windows and making sure you install the SATA drivers; but that still wouldn't explain it not coming up in ubuntu...
2005-10-14T05:30:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	isn't that like a brand new board to the market?
2005-10-14T05:35:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	fix it?
2005-10-14T05:36:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	well, it should. if you want to use ur RAID slots, enable it in the BIOS.
2005-10-14T05:36:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	no problem. :)
2005-10-14T05:39:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	ThePyromaniac	the drive would probably work in your RAID slots, but unless you're using raid, i'd just put it in the normal SATA slot. If you for some reason wanted to use the RAID slot, make sure you find RAID and enable it in your BIOS settings. They're usually off by default and that would explain it. So either way it should work and fix you rissue.
