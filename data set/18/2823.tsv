2010-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	thecliff	faz_kn	try Systems > Administration > Hardware Driver and see if Ubuntu picks up your driver
2010-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	thecliff	faz_kn	do you know if you have an AMD or Intel processor?
2010-02-13T16:37:00.000Z	thecliff	faz_kn	could go either way then.  let me know what happens in Hardware Drivers
2010-02-13T16:40:00.000Z	thecliff	faz_kn	open terminal and enter "gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2010-02-13T16:42:00.000Z	thecliff	faz_kn	another tool I use is Sysinfo.  You can install this by going to Terminal and entering "sudo apt-get install sysinfo" and then entering your password.  this will give you an easy to use GUI interface and tell all hardware information abut you box
