2007-07-22T05:33:00.000Z	tafkaz	rausb0	there must be some way to see it...
2007-07-22T05:34:00.000Z	tafkaz		lsmod | grep agp
2007-07-22T05:34:00.000Z	tafkaz		agpgart                35400  1 nvidia
2007-07-22T05:34:00.000Z	tafkaz		so i guess it should be there
2007-07-22T05:35:00.000Z	rausb0	tafkaz	the nvidia driver (as part of the kernel) is responsible for creating that /proc entry. if it doesn't do that, it is maybe a different version of the nvidia driver. i don't have any nvidia card, so i cannot tell.
2007-07-22T05:35:00.000Z	tafkaz		hm...
2007-07-22T05:36:00.000Z	rausb0	tafkaz	at least some module called "nvidia" is loaded
2007-07-22T05:36:00.000Z	tafkaz		hehe right!
2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	tafkaz		actually glxgears shows me, that the prop driver seems to work
2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	rausb0	tafkaz	but you have to check which one it is. i remember there are three different "generations" of nvidia binary drivers.
2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	tafkaz		but i have strange issues with mythtv...
2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	tafkaz		and i think it must have something to do wit agp
2007-07-22T05:38:00.000Z	tafkaz	rausb0	i have installed the latest one with envy this script that loads the newest one
2007-07-22T05:38:00.000Z	tafkaz		but i treid also with the ubuntu nvidia-new
2007-07-22T05:38:00.000Z	rausb0	tafkaz	the envy script is not supported i guess
2007-07-22T05:38:00.000Z	rausb0	tafkaz	the ubuntu package way is
2007-07-22T05:39:00.000Z	tafkaz	rausb0	i know...i tried before, but the same issue !
2007-07-22T05:39:00.000Z	rausb0	tafkaz	but i better shut up now and let someone help who owns a nvidia card..
