2006-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	Nihil85	amphi	i have an intel ipw2200
2006-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	amphi	Nihil85	what do you mean "doesn't work" ?
2006-04-05T06:06:00.000Z	amphi	Nihil85	does ifcoonfig -a show it? (it'll most likely manifest as eth1)
2006-04-05T06:06:00.000Z	amphi	Nihil85	that's ifconfig
2006-04-05T06:07:00.000Z	Nihil85	amphi	yes, it's eht1, eth0 is the lan
2006-04-05T06:07:00.000Z	Nihil85	amphi	can i bother you in pvt?
2006-04-05T06:08:00.000Z	amphi	Nihil85	so you have kernel support - you just have to configure it; sudo dhclient eth1 is worth a try
