2009-12-20T00:28:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	have you googled the card model number with ubuntu?  Have you installed wine?  Have you tried virtual box with a windows XP installation?
2009-12-20T00:29:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	I had not even thought of trying "wine" I have googled the card numbers yes and nothing really not even anything about peak usb tv stick under ubuntu
2009-12-20T00:30:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	can you install drivers on wine?
2009-12-20T00:30:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	I recommend installing wine, and the medibuntu packages.  Has LOTS of multimedial libraries for using windows drivers, as well as linux drivers.
2009-12-20T00:31:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	no worries, I'm pretty new too.  Just today learning that installing Wine put libraries on my system I needed to run other things I'm trying to do as well.
2009-12-20T00:31:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	can I install drivers into wine?
2009-12-20T00:32:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	WORST case scenario, if you have a windows installation cd, is to install Virtual Box, install windows in that, and try to run your usb tv stick thru that.
2009-12-20T00:34:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	don't worry about the drivers just yet.  install wine, reboot, and THEN see if the system recognizes your usb stick.
2009-12-20T00:35:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	do I not have to do anything with wine? Now I have it installed it will automaticly run when I boot ubuntu?
2009-12-20T00:35:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	installing wine installs multimedia libraries that MAY or may not help your system recognize the stick.
2009-12-20T00:36:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	not necessarily.  If it still doesn't recognize the stick, then try running the installation disk under wine.
2009-12-20T00:37:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	how do I run a installation disk under wine?
2009-12-20T00:37:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	and if you still can't get it going, then install virtual box, and install windows under that.
2009-12-20T00:49:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	the only way youre going to be able to use the actual driver disk, is to install virtual box, and then install windows under virtual box, THEN install your windows drivers for your usb tv stick there.
2009-12-20T00:59:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	Sorry bro, linux isn't an operating system that you can sit down and make work with zero knowledge.  Takes time, study, and patience.   It's worth it in the end for the stability.  Windows only works for anyone who sits in front of it because it's so bloated with every possible driver, library, and software scenario that could possibly present itself.  That's why it's such a resource hog.
2009-12-20T01:01:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	I think you are exactly right. To be totally fair i'm in a bad mood and not being fair. It's a discontinued usb stick with limited support for windows anyway. Expecting it to work on linux is OTT however I just thought like with my printer . . epson sx200 I pressed the on button a balloon popped up and said your printer is ready and working I was like OMG NO WAY? and it worked perfectly I think i was hoping for the same with this.
2009-12-20T01:01:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	jmyers	You have been a great help and thank you for your time and support m8.
2009-12-20T01:02:00.000Z	jmyers	LewisDre4m	yeah, I'm struggling HARD CORE with a $200 video card I just bought 6 months ago.
