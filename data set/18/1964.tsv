2010-10-06T01:41:00.000Z	Chaos2358		thank you people
2010-10-06T01:42:00.000Z	Chaos2358		its really messed up that there are so many hall monitors that try to redirect you to different rooms for a simple ubuntu related question just cause the are bored
2010-10-06T01:44:00.000Z	Chaos2358		Suddenly i'm reminded of junior high school
2010-10-06T01:45:00.000Z	guntbert	Chaos2358	please stop those off topic comments
2010-10-26T02:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Chaos2358	if you want to use some space of your disk it must be part of a partition and then have a file system
2010-10-26T02:44:00.000Z	Chaos2358	guntbert	so basically with this 250 gig i want to use for storage best thing to do would be create a 1 gig partition and then format the remaining 249 to fat??
2010-10-26T02:45:00.000Z	Chaos2358	guntbert	i already have a 60gb external i didnt have this problem with i erased and formatted with fat and it works fine as storage
2010-10-26T02:45:00.000Z	guntbert	Chaos2358	no, create a 250 gig partition and format it to vfat (or so..)
2010-10-26T02:45:00.000Z	Chaos2358	guntbert	ok cool
2010-10-26T02:45:00.000Z	guntbert	Chaos2358	you didn't remove the partition on that HD
2010-10-26T02:47:00.000Z	Chaos2358	guntbert	ok may seem a little slow as i'm just learning a little slow but to clear it up the 60 gig was one big partition which is why i could format it. since the 250 had two 125gb partitions and i removed them i naow have to create a single 250 gb partition in order to use it am i correct?
2010-10-26T02:48:00.000Z	guntbert	Chaos2358	correct - all data must be on partitions that carry a file system
2010-10-26T03:00:00.000Z	guntbert	Chaos2358	I said vfat
2010-10-26T03:01:00.000Z	Chaos2358	guntbert	ok i shall try that
2010-10-26T03:31:00.000Z	Chaos2358	guntbert	how do i format to vfat? it isnt one of my optinons
