2007-01-08T07:36:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 I've noticed the people in here are really helpful and friendly
2007-01-08T07:43:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 what wireless card do you have?
2007-01-08T07:46:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 go to <system> <admin> <networking tools> and tell me if it says your card is working
2007-01-08T07:49:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 go to <system> <admin> <networking > (sorry sent u to wrong spot)and tell me if it says your card is working
2007-01-08T07:50:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 double click on your wireless connection and see if its active
2007-01-08T07:51:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	it should show a wireless card and say "the interface *blank* is active or inactive
2007-01-08T07:57:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 try installing knetworkmanager and kwifimanager in synaptic (aka add remove programs) under you "applications" tab
2007-01-08T08:04:00.000Z	imbecile	Sasa	 hows it going? got it figured out?
