2006-05-22T14:57:00.000Z	Ademan_		cool
2006-05-22T14:57:00.000Z	Ademan_		unfortunately i doubt i'd be able to use that because i'm behind 2 physical firewalls
2006-05-22T14:57:00.000Z	Ademan_		eh?
2006-05-22T14:57:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	i think one option is to just open up a specific range in the 40k's for pasv and tell the ftp server demand pasv on those ports.
2006-05-22T14:58:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	ah.. you'll probably need to use the ooption I just described then.
2006-05-22T14:59:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	probably was an FTP server issue not telling the clients to use the proper ports.  Did you debug with a pasv client and checking the port it was given by the server?
2006-05-22T15:00:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	check it out.  :)
2006-05-22T15:00:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	one with the least amount of known sweeping trojan traffic.  :)
2006-05-22T15:01:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	how many clients do you expect at a time?
2006-05-22T15:02:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	i'm certain it does
2006-05-22T15:03:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	if it doesn't, it should specify in the man page for the conf file.
2006-05-22T15:03:00.000Z	Ademan_	drumline_	well, i'm sure it has a default value, but i dont override it in my conf
2006-05-22T15:03:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	probably 3
2006-05-22T15:03:00.000Z	Ademan_	drumline_	not on a laptop
2006-05-22T15:05:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	go with a range around: 2 * (concurrent connections) * (number of clients max)
2006-05-22T15:05:00.000Z	Ademan_	drumline_	k thanks
2006-05-22T15:05:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	if there's issue, increase.  :)
2006-05-22T15:05:00.000Z	drumline_	Ademan_	depends on how smart your ftp daemon is
