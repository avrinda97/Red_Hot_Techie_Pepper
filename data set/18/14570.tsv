2005-09-19T12:45:00.000Z	feugan3333		s/Is so/If so/
2005-09-19T12:47:00.000Z	feugan3333		breezy using the same kernel?
2005-09-19T12:48:00.000Z	feugan3333		I think the new kernel will be better for amd/nvidia users.
2005-09-19T12:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	feugan3333	why you think that?
2005-09-19T12:50:00.000Z	feugan3333	erUSUL	When compiling the Nvidia driver on AMD64 it give out warning that the driver may be unstable and suggests upgrading to kernel 2.6.11.
2005-09-19T12:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	feugan3333	ther is a 2.6.11 in universe for hoary...
