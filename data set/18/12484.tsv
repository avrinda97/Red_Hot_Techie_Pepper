2006-04-15T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	if you want that module to load on boot, add it to /etc/modules
2006-04-15T09:11:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	not sure how to do that
2006-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	sudo nano /etc/modules
2006-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	yeah, I am just using pico, does that make a dif?
2006-04-15T09:13:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	now I just add "rc.d"
2006-04-15T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	no, gksudo gedit works as well, and add the module name to an empty line
2006-04-15T09:15:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	now I just add "rc.d" or "rc"?
2006-04-15T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	what was the module you wanted to be loaded on boot again?
2006-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	/etc/rc.d/rc.modules
2006-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	no, it was some ethernet device you wanted to work
2006-04-15T09:17:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	yeah.... I am not sure, I just know that that is the file I am supposed to edit, but it is not present...
2006-04-15T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	forget all about /etc/rc.d/rc.modules, it does not exist in ubuntu
2006-04-15T09:17:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	ok... so I don't need to add a module?
2006-04-15T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	8139too <-- put that on a blank line in /etc/modules
2006-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	alright. so whats it going to do again?
2006-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	every time you boot up, the modules in /etc/modules are modprobed
2006-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	FarFetched22	functionally the same result as the slackware howto you were using
2006-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	FarFetched22	nickrud	ok
