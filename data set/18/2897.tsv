2010-01-28T10:41:00.000Z	zruty		Why do I feel a bot attack coming on ...?
2010-01-28T10:43:00.000Z	zruty		How do I move my downloads-in-progress without breaking them, having to start all over?
2010-01-28T10:43:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	Which program?
2010-01-28T10:43:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	transmission
2010-01-28T10:48:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	mobi-sheep headyadmin: thanks
2010-01-28T10:50:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	I'm pretty sure you have to run the 1.7x version to get that functionality.  I remember being upset at pre 1.7 versions for breaking the torrent.
2010-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	Yeah, well, they're not all that critical but some had been going for a few months...
2010-01-28T11:00:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	That method works, but it's tricky.  I'd say your best bet is to upgrade and restart X-mission
2010-01-28T11:04:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	I need to plan such a big upgrade... it is not just a desktop computer
2010-01-28T11:04:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	Gotcha.  Just asking.
2010-01-28T11:08:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	Check your source lists and make sure https://launchpad.net/~transmissionbt/+archive/ppa is listed
2010-01-28T11:10:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	If you have to add it (I'm guessing you will) then close, and do an 'sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude full-upgrade'
2010-01-28T11:13:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	.. having some trouble adding it into my sources.list ; it keeps telling me there is a malformed line
2010-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	Also, you may need to enable the 'universe' packages.  can't remember if x-mission is in 'main' or not.
2010-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	universe is in there. But now it says somethting the public key is not available
2010-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	Actually go look at this page: https://launchpad.net/~transmissionbt/+archive/ppa
2010-01-28T11:26:00.000Z	zruty	cyqotiq	Wonderful! Figured it out with a lot of help from you! Got to go download by download but that will take a few months less time than to restart them all. Thanks!
2010-01-28T11:26:00.000Z	cyqotiq	zruty	np, good luck
