2008-03-04T19:41:00.000Z	sinbox		ok, I've now found a new rpm package with new drivers for my printers, it's an "src.rpm" which apparently means it contains the source in there, anyone know what I must use to open it extract the source from there so I can then do a make install of the source?
2008-03-04T19:42:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	which printer are you installing
2008-03-04T19:44:00.000Z	sinbox	zossso	  Canon Pixma MP160: works fine over the network via cups when connected to an XP machine but steadfastly refuses to work when via USB to this box despite following all the instructions I found in the ubuntu forum and linuxprinting and openprint
2008-03-04T19:44:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	I had a pixima at one time.  let me think a while
2008-03-04T19:46:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	do you have alien installed?
2008-03-04T19:47:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	ah.. I had problems installing this printer too.  think i ended up using turboprint or something.  *thinking*
2008-03-04T19:49:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	you've looked at this forum: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=364749
2008-03-04T19:51:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	this one seems alright.  sounds similar to what I did: http://openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Canon-Pixma_MP160
2008-03-04T19:51:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	even has a guide for Ubuntu 7.10
2008-03-04T19:52:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	pretty sure you will need alien regardless
2008-03-04T19:53:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	In my experience, it was the most difficult printer to get working with linux (without closed-source turboprint).
2008-03-04T19:55:00.000Z	sinbox	zossso	I had read that one too :) will try that as well  Jack_Sparrow I think that the free version of turboprint puts a watermark of their company logo on prints though which isn't exactly ideal, thanks both of you, if all that fail I will try the newer canon file I found on the european website yesterday
2008-03-04T19:55:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	Jack_Sparrow:  it does put a watermark on it
2008-03-04T19:56:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	the method on that last post I gave you should work.  But if I remember, many setting (b/w only, etc.) don't work easily
2008-03-05T21:52:00.000Z	sinbox	zossso	you were telling me you used a canon pixma MP160 before or was that someone else?
2008-03-05T21:52:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	yeah, me
2008-03-05T21:54:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	never got it doing that.  cool!
2008-03-05T21:55:00.000Z	zossso	sinbox	what are you scanning with then?
