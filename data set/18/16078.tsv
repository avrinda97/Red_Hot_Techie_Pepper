2004-11-17T10:44:00.000Z	nubi		how can I change the GDM resolution?
2004-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	nubi		PLEASE can some1 at least try to answer my question? :-(
2004-11-17T10:47:00.000Z	kent	nubi	you can change it in /etc/XF86Config-4, i think
2004-11-17T10:48:00.000Z	nubi	kent	no I can't :(
2004-11-17T10:48:00.000Z	kent	nubi	well, i could. How come you cant? What did you do?
2004-11-17T10:51:00.000Z	kent	nubi	Well, say you want gdm to use 1024x768, then make sure it in the XF86Config-4.
2004-11-17T10:53:00.000Z	nubi	kent	Modes  "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "720x400" "640x480" "640x400" ... I'm currently using 1152*864. Do you see that value in there? I dont.
2004-11-17T10:53:00.000Z	nubi	kent	all depth lines are the same
2004-11-17T10:54:00.000Z	kent	nubi	what value?  What are the resolution you want to use?
2004-11-17T10:54:00.000Z	nubi	kent	I want to use my current resolution :) 1152*846*24
2004-11-17T10:55:00.000Z	kent	nubi	perhaps you should run the command you got from bob2. I changed the resolution simply by deleting 1600x1200 since that was what gdm wanted to run, and its to ugly on my monitor.
2004-11-17T10:55:00.000Z	nubi	kent	same problem as I have :)
2004-11-17T10:56:00.000Z	kent	nubi	or add the resolution to there. Write 1152x846  and change the default depth.
2004-11-17T10:57:00.000Z	kent	nubi	if its running 1600x1200 and you dont want it to, just delete 1600x1200 from that line.
2004-11-17T10:57:00.000Z	nubi	kent	yes it could be good then I thing ... but I'm really confused that my system doesn't do, what is written in config files. Where it got that it can run at my current resolution? I'm happy that it works but i'm really interested from where this setting came
2004-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	kent	nubi	configuring X is kind of hard.  I realy think the people developing X should take some time to configure an easy way to configure it..
2004-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	nubi	kent	I want to know, what happens in my comp. Thats the reason I switched to linux years ago
