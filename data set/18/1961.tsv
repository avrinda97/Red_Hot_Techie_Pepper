2010-09-27T13:31:00.000Z	baseem		chip (i think ) is sis 964
2010-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	if you run: lspci | grep -i vga    you will b shown
2010-09-27T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	you'll need an xorg.conf file. There is a sample one here: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-571530.html    you can remove all the keyboard / mouse stuff
2010-09-27T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	remove what?
2010-09-27T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	It's text, copy the the xorg.conf then use the delete key on the keyboard to remove all the text relating to mouse and keyboard
2010-09-27T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	if you are talking about screen res, it is desktop
2010-09-27T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-09-27T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	sure, if you don't use tablets etc
2010-09-27T13:56:00.000Z	baseem	ActionParsnip	also my monitor is Acer 713, should I change the name, and what other detailes?
2010-09-27T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	if you like, if you change the identifier you MUST change the identifier in the other sections too or it won't work. It's only aesthetic so I wouldn't worry too much
2010-09-27T13:59:00.000Z	baseem	ActionParsnip	when I tried to save the file it said "Could not find the file /etc/x11/xorg.conf"
2010-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	lucid doesn't come with one, when you populate the file it should then be saveable.
2010-09-27T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baseem	put text in, if you open a blank text file and put text in it, you are populating the file
