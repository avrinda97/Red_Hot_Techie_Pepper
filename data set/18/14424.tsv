2005-08-21T15:54:00.000Z	salil	popey	do you use bluetooth
2005-08-21T15:50:00.000Z	popey	salil	what phone?

2005-08-21T15:51:00.000Z	salil	popey	QD
2005-08-21T15:51:00.000Z	popey	salil	does it use a memory card? you can put that in a memory card reader and mount that. thats what i do with my nokia 6600
2005-08-21T15:53:00.000Z	salil	popey	yes it does.. but i don't have a memory card and i was wondering whether you could load it like a filesystem thru bluetoot
2005-08-21T15:53:00.000Z	popey	salil	I have a friend who uses bluetooth with his nokia6600 but it uses nfs and it's a bit messy
2005-08-21T15:54:00.000Z	salil	popey	i did configure the bluetooth with obex .. but.. the "bluetooth file sharing"  doesn't work
2005-08-21T15:55:00.000Z	popey	salil	no, not on linux, because i have a memory card reader
2005-08-21T15:55:00.000Z	salil	popey	it was giving me problems with windows too..
2005-08-21T15:55:00.000Z	popey	salil	ditto!
2005-08-21T15:55:00.000Z	salil	popey	it always connected on port 0....!!!
2005-08-21T15:56:00.000Z	popey	salil	I've never got file transfer working well on bluetooth on windows
2005-08-21T15:56:00.000Z	salil	popey	oh really.. .. it worked fine with mine.. but.. just that it always connected on port0.. i never could make it connect on the regular ports. !!
2005-08-21T15:57:00.000Z	salil	popey	can you help me with mplayer ....
2005-08-21T15:57:00.000Z	popey	salil	I don't use mplayer, only totem and xine
2005-08-21T15:58:00.000Z	salil	popey	oh..
