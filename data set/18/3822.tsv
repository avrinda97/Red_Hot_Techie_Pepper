2012-04-06T13:07:00.000Z	joginder		how can we add new users?
2012-04-06T13:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	or go into system settings -> users and groups -> unlock -> add user
2012-04-06T13:10:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	for a cleaner output "getent passwd | cut -d: -f1"
2012-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	go to "system settings" -> "users and group". that will only list desktop users though, but that's probably all you want anyways
2012-04-06T13:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	what new wallpapers?
2012-04-06T13:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	yes I know that, but what *new* ones?
2012-04-06T13:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	could you post a link/etc?
2012-04-06T13:18:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	are there any backgrounds in particular that you want (new Maverick ones, etc) or just some backgrounds in general?
2012-04-06T13:32:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	WHY do you want to be the root user. 99% of linux users will NEVER need to log in as root, sudo is more than enough. I run 24/7 servers and my root account is deactivated on ALL of them
2012-04-06T13:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	":q" to quit, ":wq" to save and quit, ":q!" to quit and discard changes
2012-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	you have asked that question 3 times and appear to be asking *completely* random questions. Is there something *specific* you are trying to do?
2012-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	would you like a link to a "getting started with ubuntu" tutorial so you can have some fun?
2012-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	if there's anything in particular you would like to learn (apache, command line, etc), let us know, there are LOTS of tutorials we can point you to
2012-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	very, very, VERY small chance. I think there's been ONE virus that ever managed to propagate between linux machines in the wild
2012-04-06T14:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	your questions appear very random and don't seem to be serving any purpose, please explain what you are trying to DO
2012-04-06T14:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	please do NOT re-ask questions to which you have already been given the answer FIVE TIMES!
2012-04-06T14:21:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	because only root can add a new user...
2012-04-06T14:34:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	joginder	please go through https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal to familiarize yourself with the linux command line. don't forget to visit the links at the bottom for even more fun tutorials!
