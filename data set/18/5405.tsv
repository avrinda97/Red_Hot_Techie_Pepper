2008-11-10T10:51:00.000Z	ditch64		hello, i have a problem, i resized the swap partition and the computer would not reboot, i tried like 6 times and it didnt work the 7th time it booted......
2008-11-10T10:51:00.000Z	ditch64		it even said that it predicted a failure
2008-11-10T10:51:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	what size?   my system never even uses the swap part
2008-11-10T10:52:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	i used the auto install and it made the swap like 40 gigs and after learning about linux i resized it to 2 gigs today
2008-11-10T10:52:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	i doubt you'll ever need a 2 gig swap part..  just fyi...
2008-11-10T10:53:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	but now it works and now i fear that i may have a problem larger then i think
2008-11-10T10:53:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	it sounds like your FAT was messed with...
2008-11-10T10:53:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	i have 2 gigs of memory and i hibernate every time i turn off the computer
2008-11-10T10:54:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	but thats not the issue right now, i need to make sure everything is ok, and that i do not need to restore any of the file system before i reboot
2008-11-10T10:54:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	yes, in light of that, disregard what I said.
2008-11-10T10:54:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	Do you have gparted installed?
2008-11-10T10:54:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	yes
2008-11-10T10:55:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	You could use gparted to take a look if the partitions were okay...
2008-11-10T10:55:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	i did not know that, give me a second and ill report back
2008-11-10T10:56:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	how do i use gparted to figure out if its ok?
2008-11-10T10:57:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	Let me load up gparted...  I don't have it installed on this box
2008-11-10T10:57:00.000Z	ditch64	aegis	ok thank you
2008-11-10T10:59:00.000Z	aegis	ditch64	You can force a check of your drives by rebooting your computer with 'sudo shutdown -r -F now
