2007-08-02T13:47:00.000Z	midori		thank you for the welcome
2007-08-02T13:48:00.000Z	midori		how about, whats the standard size for any linux distro installed on a hard drive?  how much it takes up just on first installl?  (I mainly want to compare ubuntu to fedora install size.  I don't got much spaces. I heard, they say 10 gigs for / partition, well.  i don't got that much.  how big is their install size?)
2007-08-02T13:50:00.000Z	midori		anyone knows fedora install size???
2007-08-02T13:50:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	huh?
2007-08-02T13:53:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	i don't see why that is useful
2007-08-02T13:53:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	you still need to install the regular programs you need on both and it'll jack up the disk space
2007-08-02T13:54:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	then fedora AND ubuntu are not the distros for you
2007-08-02T13:54:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	fedora is about the same class
2007-08-02T13:54:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	go crux or DSL if you're short in space
2007-08-02T13:55:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	do what you like man.. but i would go for one of these minimal distros if i was short on space
2007-08-02T13:56:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	what's a p2 gotta do with disk space??????????
2007-08-02T13:57:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	i would say it won't make that much of a difference, if at all
2007-08-02T13:58:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	i can install a 180GB drive on a P2 machine
2007-08-02T13:58:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	na mean?
2007-08-02T14:00:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	ok.. install both and see
2007-08-02T14:04:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	i can be more rude but some folks won't like it.. but you're welcome
2007-08-02T14:06:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	midori	join #politics
