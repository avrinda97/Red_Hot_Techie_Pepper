2007-06-01T05:37:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	temp files? what temp files?
2007-06-01T05:38:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	I think that's cleaned no matter what desktop you run
2007-06-01T05:38:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	why? stuff in /tmp should be temporary
2007-06-01T05:39:00.000Z	supernova_	mwe	okey.. im new to linux.... win you have to clean everything your self to ceep the computer "fast"
2007-06-01T05:39:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	that's not your problem and why kcontrol is not loading
2007-06-01T05:39:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	did you install kubuntu or what?

2007-06-01T05:40:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	does the system thing replacement work?
2007-06-01T05:41:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	there is a new "system" menu entry that is supposed to replace kcontrol
2007-06-01T05:41:00.000Z	mwe	supernova_	I still like kcontrol much more, though.
2007-06-01T05:44:00.000Z	supernova_	mwe	but i dont understand what devive fails to open..
