2007-05-12T09:16:00.000Z	madman91		hey guys.. this might be a stupid question.. but how do i stream a windows media player stream.. and rip it
2007-05-12T09:16:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	mplayer -dumpstream
2007-05-12T09:16:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	wow.. really? what will it output to
2007-05-12T09:17:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	./stream.dump
2007-05-12T09:17:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	is that a video file?
2007-05-12T09:17:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	you should be able to play it again
2007-05-12T09:18:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	but will it just connect to the site again? or will it play in mplayer? or can i transcode it to another file..
2007-05-12T09:19:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	it will download the data, you won't need to connect anymore
2007-05-12T09:19:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	but do you know what format it will be.. and if it is transcodable?
2007-05-12T09:20:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	not for sure, but it will probably be wmv or whatever the original was in
2007-05-12T09:20:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	thanks!
2008-01-22T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	man 2 whatever
2008-01-24T08:39:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	manpages-dev package will give you the manpages you want.  If you actually want a book, you should ask in ##c
2008-01-24T08:39:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	##c banned everyone
2008-01-24T08:40:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	I'm in ##c
2008-01-24T08:40:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	how odd? ... hm..
2008-01-24T08:40:00.000Z	madman91	jrib	can you ask an admin why I am banned?
2008-01-24T08:44:00.000Z	jrib	madman91	I asked the channel if an op was available.  In the meantime, maybe some C coders in #ubuntu-offtopic can suggest some books for you
