2009-03-18T20:48:00.000Z	humbolt		does anybody know, if Skype audio input (of the static-oss version) does work with padsp?
2009-03-18T20:49:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	if it is really static linked (all libs linked into it), no
2009-03-18T20:49:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	I got the static-oss version from skype.com
2009-03-18T20:50:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	i don't use skype at all. but you can do ldd /path/to/skype to check it.
2009-03-18T20:51:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	if it gives you something like "statically linked", you are out of luck
2009-03-18T20:51:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	then it is not statically linked
2009-03-18T20:52:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	ok, all it says is static-oss on the download page
2009-03-18T20:52:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	what beli says, nopaste the output of ldd
2009-03-18T20:54:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	beli: http://nopaste.org/p/a559bzvr4
2009-03-18T20:55:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	it should work with padsp if padsp uses the same technique as aoss
2009-03-18T20:56:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	how do you see that. which lib am I looking for?
2009-03-18T20:56:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	output works, but skype does seem to believe, there is no mic
2009-03-18T20:57:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	it is dynamically linked agains libc. and if padsp works like aoss, it will intercept the open() system call
2009-03-18T20:57:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	then i suspect it is a pulseaudio problem. i don't use PA, just plain alsa
2009-03-18T20:59:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	I can record from the mic via pulseaudio, with the gnome-recorder app, or whatever its name is
2009-03-18T20:59:00.000Z	humbolt	rtx3462	so pulseaudio seems to work correctly
2009-03-18T20:59:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	then i don't know, must be skype specific...
2009-03-18T21:00:00.000Z	rtx3462	humbolt	i refuse to use this closed source rubbish
