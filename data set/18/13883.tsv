2005-10-07T05:41:00.000Z	_willcooke_		Any MySQL people in here?  I've asked in #MySQL, no response!
2005-10-07T05:42:00.000Z	_willcooke_		Know about searching against free text index?
2005-10-07T05:43:00.000Z	propagandhi	_willcooke_	something like SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE TextField='%keyword%'
2005-10-07T05:44:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	I was doing it that way but I'm trying SELECT * FROM table WHERE MATCH (column) AGAINST ('Search Term');
2005-10-07T05:44:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	and it ain't working!
2005-10-07T05:44:00.000Z	propagandhi		hmm...
2005-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	I think I'll go back to using LIKE for now!
2005-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	propagandhi		is there an error or its just not returning any results
2005-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	returns an empty set, so I guess I havent got the syntax quite right
2005-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	propagandhi		yeah that'd be it
2005-10-07T05:46:00.000Z	propagandhi		LIKE is good depending on the scenario
2005-10-07T05:47:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	the table has about 3000 entries with a 3 line text field, so LIKE is OK, but if it gets much bigger I'll have to think of a better way!  It's not slow at the moment though, so I guess, if it aint broke, dont fix it!
2005-10-07T05:47:00.000Z	propagandhi		u using PHP?
2005-10-07T05:47:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	python
2005-10-07T05:48:00.000Z	propagandhi		ok, so it should be speedy 3000 entries is nothing, my works database has well over 600,000
2005-10-07T05:48:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	that's good news!  I'll change it back.  Cheers!
2005-10-07T05:48:00.000Z	propagandhi		no worries, didnt do nothin anyhow!
2005-10-07T05:48:00.000Z	_willcooke_	propagandhi	You convinced me to stick with LIKE!
