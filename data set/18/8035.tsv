2008-07-22T21:50:00.000Z	jlewis		Can someone help me please? I have a CD full of essays that I have burned onto a disk for backup. Now, with my fresh install of Ubuntu, when I try and access the folder a icon of a lock appears and I cant save anything in that folder. How do i remove the lock from the files?

2008-07-22T21:59:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	jlewis	umm. what is the name of the locked folder?
2008-07-22T22:00:00.000Z	jlewis	Odd-rationale	It is "Free Reformed Stuff". But they are all locked it seems (all the ones from the CD burn).
2008-07-22T22:01:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	jlewis	ok. so do "chmod -R 755 Free Reformed Stuff"
2008-07-22T22:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	jlewis	use tab completion to help complete the folder name...
2008-07-22T22:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	jlewis	try "chmod -R 755 ~/Free<tab>"
2008-07-22T22:04:00.000Z	jlewis	Odd-rationale	That is it! Beauty! tHX.
2008-07-22T22:05:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	jlewis	np. BTW, cool to see other reformed people on here... :)
