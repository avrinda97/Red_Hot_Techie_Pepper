2007-10-30T10:04:00.000Z	levander	soror	just download a LiveCD and boot your computer off it, don't have to install Ubuntu to try it out, just boot off the LiveCD
2007-10-30T10:04:00.000Z	soror	levander	 I've got it installed and running, and I can tinker with it, but I'm looking for a guide of some sort.
2007-10-30T10:05:00.000Z	levander	soror	It depends on what you want to do with it.  What do you want to do?
2007-10-30T10:06:00.000Z	soror	levander	 I want to know how the file system works, how to fix corrupted/crashing programs (I know how to install them, but when they start crashing out I'm SOL), etc.  Just a general 'here's how'.
2007-10-30T10:08:00.000Z	levander	soror	fixing filesystems is the fsck command.  Fixing crashed programs...
2007-10-30T10:08:00.000Z	levander	soror	That's a pretty varied activity.
2007-10-30T10:09:00.000Z	levander	soror	I think what I do for that is just to google for any error message that comes up when a program crashes.
2007-10-30T10:09:00.000Z	soror	levander	 I ended up having to reinstal ubuntu completely
2007-10-30T10:09:00.000Z	levander	soror	If you're pretty newb, I'd try to make sure not to get too deep into stuff.  It's lots more fun to learn if you just do it piece by piece and don't try to dive down into the depths too quickly.
2007-10-30T10:11:00.000Z	levander	soror	why'd you have to reinstall?
2007-10-30T10:12:00.000Z	soror	levander	 Sorry, I explained but forgot to tag your name.  Prog kept dying, in terminal it said 'core dumped' and I tried to uninstall/reinstall, but it continued to do the same.
2007-10-30T10:12:00.000Z	soror	levander	 To correct it, I ended up reinstalling ubuntu completely.
2007-10-30T10:12:00.000Z	levander	soror	What program was it?  What repository did you install it from?
2007-10-30T10:14:00.000Z	levander	soror	What I've done, is when problems like that come up, I just get on the internet and figure out what the problem is when you've got the problem.  That's how most people learn.  You probably could have learned something about fixing it in the time it took you to reinstall?
2007-10-30T10:16:00.000Z	soror	levander	Xchat, and I'm not sure which it came from.  Behold, I am n00b.
2007-10-30T10:16:00.000Z	levander	soror	As a newb, I'd really just stick to the Canonical repositories.  XChat is in Canonical.
2007-10-30T10:17:00.000Z	soror	levander	Thank you for the advice.
