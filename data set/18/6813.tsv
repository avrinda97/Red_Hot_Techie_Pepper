2008-03-27T23:24:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	I got it to work, thanks :-)
2008-03-27T23:14:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	if you drivers  are stup correctly you just have to enable desktop effects
2008-03-27T23:14:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	cool
2008-03-27T23:14:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	oh, it doesn't work :-(
2008-03-27T23:15:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	I have one of those GMA 950 cards
2008-03-27T23:16:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	thanks though :-)
2008-03-27T23:44:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	it's fancy, for the time being though I'm going back to metacity
2008-03-27T23:44:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	it's what i use too
2008-03-27T23:44:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	it's flashy but annoying :-P
2008-03-27T23:44:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	exactly
2008-03-27T23:45:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	only good when you are giving presentations..
2008-03-27T23:45:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	not to mention that it eats my battery. I do wish that a couple of its features were in metacity, such as window expos and dragging stuff between v-desktops
2008-03-27T23:46:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	have a look at powertop
2008-03-27T23:57:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	anyway, I'm going to log out now, need to reboot my X server
2008-03-28T01:23:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	in the preferences you can reduce how much cpu it uses, or disable it altogether
2008-03-28T01:25:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	thanks, it's not so much about the CPU not being available for other apps but the CPU getting eaten up at all while on battery
2008-03-28T01:25:00.000Z	rexy_	saminthemiddle	you can just disable it then in the preferences
2008-03-28T01:26:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	rexy_	thanks, I just did
