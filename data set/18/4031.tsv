2009-06-15T19:06:00.000Z	AceKing		Anyone know of a tool to secure erase a hard drive?
2009-06-15T19:06:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	For a full erase, DBAN is good
2009-06-15T19:07:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	thanks, it will erase beyond recovery?
2009-06-15T19:07:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	DBAN? Usually yes, but depends on the method chosen.
2009-06-15T19:08:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	And yes, the really best option is microwave < /dev/hda
2009-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	I heard there's a site called google.com that can do it.
2009-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	Seriously, http://tor.eff.org/
2009-06-20T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	For torrents, Relakks
2009-06-20T17:51:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	Why do you need a proxy, anyway?
2009-06-20T17:52:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	I guess I'm just being paranoid. I use an IP blocker
2009-06-20T17:52:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	Maybe try Relakks or IPredator or something like that?
2009-06-20T17:53:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	Thank you
2009-07-22T17:37:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	What client are you using - VNC, or Windows Remote Desktop?
2009-07-22T17:38:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	VNC I'm trying to connect one Ubuntu PC to another
2009-07-22T17:46:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	you still there?
2009-07-23T19:37:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	You started to help me yesterday with setting up a remote desktop, then I didn't hear anything. You have time to help?
2009-07-23T19:37:00.000Z	grawity	AceKing	I have time, but I don't know anything about setting up VNC
2009-07-23T19:38:00.000Z	AceKing	grawity	Ok, thanks anyway
