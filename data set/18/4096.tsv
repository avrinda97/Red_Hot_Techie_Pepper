2011-01-17T06:21:00.000Z	semitones		Hey  guys I'm sorry but it looks like I'm in a difficult spot... when I boot into Ubuntu, i'm taken to the CLI. GDM says it's already running, but in F8 all I see is a blinking cursor
2011-01-17T06:21:00.000Z	semitones		I'm not sure what to do from here
2011-01-17T06:23:00.000Z	semitones		what should I do to find out why my GUI isn't working?
2011-01-17T06:24:00.000Z	tulimaq	semitones	what seems to be the problem ?
2011-01-17T06:24:00.000Z	semitones	tulimaq	when I boot up, I get the CLI instead of gnome. GDM says it's running, so I don't know what to do from here
2011-01-17T06:25:00.000Z	semitones		:)
2011-01-17T06:25:00.000Z	tulimaq	semitones	what happens when press control+alt+f7
2011-01-17T06:26:00.000Z	semitones	tulimaq	I've tried f7 and f8 -- f7 just has boot messages
2011-01-17T06:26:00.000Z	semitones	tulimaq	f8 has a blinking cursor -- i'm in f1 now
2011-01-17T06:26:00.000Z	tulimaq	semitones	and what video card u have ?
2011-01-17T06:27:00.000Z	semitones	tulimaq	a newish gforce

2011-01-17T06:27:00.000Z	semitones		GT 240
2011-01-17T06:28:00.000Z	semitones	tulimaq	it's worked before -- I did just change the gfx card though
2011-01-17T06:28:00.000Z	semitones		do you think that's what happened?
2011-01-17T06:29:00.000Z	tulimaq	semitones	ok i see, maybe u should try to reconfure Xserver ?
