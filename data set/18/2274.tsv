2010-07-22T17:32:00.000Z	Rogasch		Hello, i have a generell Question about Ubuntu and PDC. Im currently building a small Network for a youth-center and i want to install on all systems Ubuntu, but i also want to have a Server for saving the Profiles on a Server. How do i do this? Can anyone tell me a good Howto?
2010-07-22T17:33:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	when you say 'Profiles' what do you mean exactly?
2010-07-22T17:36:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	ok, i think i know what you're looking for
2010-07-22T17:37:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	yeah, i agree with llutz
2010-07-22T17:50:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	ok, yeah, 'Single Sign on', ldap, centralized accounts, all that madness
2010-07-22T17:53:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	yeah its madness for me :P i just started i few month ago with Linux... for me, its not that easy
2010-07-22T17:53:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	but its a lot cheaper than Active Directory...
2010-07-22T17:54:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	yeah thats true, well i will try it again with ldap
2010-07-22T17:55:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	don't mention it.  are you running ubuntu-server ?
2010-07-22T17:55:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	yes i am
2010-07-22T17:55:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	i'm assuming that you've read the Ubuntu Server Manual?
2010-07-22T17:56:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	no, not all of it :/
2010-07-22T17:56:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	yeah i know i shoud do this first :)
2010-07-22T17:57:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	you're going to want to *carefully* read the section on network authentication: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/network-authentication.html
2010-07-22T17:58:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	yes, i will do that
2010-07-22T17:59:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	i believe if you start from there, you will have some luck.  just make sure that you understand what you're doing and why ;) good luck!
2010-07-22T17:59:00.000Z	Rogasch	randy_	thank you for your help
2010-07-22T18:04:00.000Z	randy_	Rogasch	still there?
