2005-09-29T08:01:00.000Z	shaoqi		hi. how come i cannot copy files or install files into my system? It says I don't have access. How to solve this? Thanks.
2005-09-29T08:03:00.000Z	shaoqi		no. i'm still new to linux.
2005-09-29T08:03:00.000Z	shaoqi		so i see installation cant be done like this.
2005-09-29T08:04:00.000Z	shaoqi		must be using this sudo command only?
2005-09-29T08:04:00.000Z	shaoqi		yup, i'm reading it. thanks..
2005-09-29T08:04:00.000Z	shaoqi		can i logon to the admin account by default?
2005-09-29T08:04:00.000Z	shaoqi		i see..
2005-09-29T08:05:00.000Z	shaoqi		what does that do?
2005-09-29T08:05:00.000Z	shaoqi		ic..
2005-09-29T08:06:00.000Z	shaoqi		so in linux, most things are done in terminal, rather than using gui?
2005-09-29T08:06:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	not necessarily, but its faster
2005-09-29T08:08:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	its easy to pick up if you just sit in linux for a couple of days
2005-09-29T08:09:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	the most important things to remember are "sudo" and "man"
2005-09-29T08:10:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	 man is manual
2005-09-29T08:11:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	so you type it before a command, like "man cp"
2005-09-29T08:11:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	that will bring up the user manual for the cp or copy command
2005-09-29T08:11:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	remember it is case sensitive
2005-09-29T08:24:00.000Z	WebLOCH	shaoqi	 not yet
