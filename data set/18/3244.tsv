2009-11-09T03:37:00.000Z	rdz		hi all. what software is managing hotkeys in ubuntu 9.10?
2009-11-09T03:37:00.000Z	mka	rdz	gconf-editor
2009-11-09T03:38:00.000Z	rdz		mk8, many thanks.. i'll have a look
2009-11-09T03:38:00.000Z	rdz		sorry, i mean mka
2009-11-09T03:38:00.000Z	mka	rdz	oh, sorry, I thought you meant shortcuts
2009-11-09T03:39:00.000Z	rdz	mka	no, not shortcuts but special keys such as the volume up/down buttons and such.. i would like to change how they are used
2009-11-09T03:39:00.000Z	mka	rdz	I understand you now, I dont think gconf-editor can do that
2009-11-09T03:40:00.000Z	rdz	mka	do you have an idea, what is used for managing that stuff in 9.10?
2009-11-09T03:40:00.000Z	mka	rdz	you need drivers, if ubuntu cannot understand those special keys out-of-the-box
2009-11-09T03:41:00.000Z	rdz	mka	it understands them perfectly out of the box. i am just settings up a box for a special situation, where i would like to change the behaviour of some keys myself.. everything is working great so fat, i just don't know, which software manages those keyys
2009-11-09T03:41:00.000Z	rdz	mka	currently they are applied to pulseaudio volume. and i would like to use them for alsa volume directly
2009-11-09T03:42:00.000Z	mka	rdz	you need gconf-editor then
2009-11-09T03:42:00.000Z	mka	rdz	you need to understand the "name" of your special keys first
2009-11-09T03:43:00.000Z	mka	rdz	and try to create a global shortcut under metacity in gconf-editor using your special key combination
2009-11-09T03:44:00.000Z	rdz	mka	ok. should i be able to find the name by using 'xev'?
2009-11-09T03:44:00.000Z	mka	rdz	that's where I am not sure what to use
2009-11-09T03:45:00.000Z	rdz	mka	the xev output looks very different when pressing those special keys from when pressing just normal character keys
2009-11-09T03:45:00.000Z	rdz	mka	ok.. thanks so far.. i'll try to figure it out
