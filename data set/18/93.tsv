2012-10-31T20:04:00.000Z	area51pilot		sudo gedit fstab
2012-10-31T20:05:00.000Z	area51pilot		I get an error stating unable to mount /media/sda3 on startup, Press S to skip or M for Manual?
2012-10-31T20:06:00.000Z	area51pilot		its an NTFS partition with Data
2012-10-31T20:06:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	/media/sda3? Sounds dodgy
2012-10-31T20:07:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	Please paste the result of running "cat /etc/fstab" into http://paste.ubuntu.com and then paste the resulting URL in this channel
2012-10-31T20:08:00.000Z	area51pilot	blazemore	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/1321153/
2012-10-31T20:09:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	OK now what happens if you run "sudo mount -o remount /dev/sda3"
2012-10-31T20:10:00.000Z	area51pilot	blazemore	its already mounted
2012-10-31T20:10:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	Then what's the problem
2012-10-31T20:12:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	Not sure I'm google-fu-ing now
2012-10-31T20:14:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	Reboot into Windows. Schedule a checkdisk for the next reboot on that drive. Then reboot and let it do its thing, then reboot AGAIN into Windows
2012-10-31T20:28:00.000Z	area51pilot	blazemore	there is a file /etc/fstab.BAK that looks like the original file backup. What would be the proper way to revert to that file if my file system check doesnt correcct the mount issue?
2012-10-31T20:28:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	you would "sudo mv /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.broken && sudo mv /etc/fstab.BAK /etc/fstab"
2012-10-31T20:29:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	Basically the /etc/fstab file is what describes partition mounts, so whatever is in there is what will be mounted on boot
2012-10-31T20:29:00.000Z	area51pilot	blazemore	thx I understand that but have never had to really mess with it so far   :P  so im being cautious
2012-10-31T20:30:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	Make a liveCD before you go messing around with stuff you're not 100% confident about
2012-10-31T20:30:00.000Z	blazemore	area51pilot	That way if you break something you can just boot from the liveCD and copy the backup back
2012-10-31T20:31:00.000Z	area51pilot	blazemore	thx ... i just clean installed 12.04 and 7 this weekend ... would like to avoid cloning the drive back :)
