2008-04-28T08:02:00.000Z	jerbear		for some reason, file selection dialogs take FOREVER to open in all programs... any ideas what the problem could be?
2008-04-28T08:03:00.000Z	jerbear		oh my god hardy is terrible... i thought gutsy was bad
2008-04-28T08:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	not helpfull -- speak it somewhere else
2008-04-28T08:05:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	i've been trying to get help for problems that i've been having...
2008-04-28T08:05:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	what problems?
2008-04-28T08:06:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	there are so many, i'm trying to focus on one at a time... the current one is that file selection dialogs (in all programs) take a really long time to open
2008-04-28T08:06:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	at least 20 sec or so
2008-04-28T08:06:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	elaborate --
2008-04-28T08:07:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	that's all i have... you go to open a file... wait 20 sec, and the dialog pops up
2008-04-28T08:07:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	u mean in nautilus you double clickon a file and it takes 20 secs to open it?
2008-04-28T08:08:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	no.... a file selection dialog...like if you try to open a file in firefox (for example), you would go to the File menu and click open... the dialog that pops up then is the one i'm talking about
2008-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	in terminal run   'top'    recreate bug and tell me what app is spiking cpu
2008-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	no cpu spikes, no high mem usage... it just delays and it does it in any program that uses the gnome file chooser
2008-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	reinstall ubuntu-desktop
2008-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	what??!
2008-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	its just 1 package
2008-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	jerbear	Bodsda	how do you reinstall it? it's already installed
2008-04-28T08:12:00.000Z	Bodsda	jerbear	i belive its   sudo apt-get reinstall ...........   man apt-get
