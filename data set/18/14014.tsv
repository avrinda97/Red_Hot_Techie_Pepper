2005-11-16T09:46:00.000Z	psusi		let's see... what nice things should go into a rescue initrd?  fdisk and ntfsresize... what else?  hrm...
2005-11-16T09:47:00.000Z	psusi		I suppose for a more general rescue image... but I only use ext2 for /boot... and I might stop doing that at some point...
2005-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	psusi		I also don't have a floppy drive... they are obsolete piles of shit and I'm glad to see them go
2005-11-16T09:50:00.000Z	psusi		I wrote a floppy disk driver once for ReactOS... man they suck
2005-11-16T09:50:00.000Z	psusi		I hate floppies with a passion
2005-11-16T09:51:00.000Z	psusi		you can hardly EAT for $20... if you aren't a starving cambodian, you can afford a usb memory stick ;)
2005-11-16T09:51:00.000Z	psusi		that reminds me... I should go buy one of those
2005-11-16T09:51:00.000Z	psusi		I usually just use cds or the Internet
2005-11-16T09:53:00.000Z	dabaR	psusi	why would you need a stick....there is sftp...
2005-11-16T09:54:00.000Z	dabaR	psusi	cds suck worse even...
2006-01-11T10:08:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	what were you trying to mount?
2006-01-11T10:08:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	check your demsg for errors
2006-01-11T10:11:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	sounds like the cd is unreadable... dmesg should be full of errors
2006-01-11T10:13:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	reboot, and try a different cd
2006-01-11T10:13:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	it isn't killable because the kernel is shitting itself
2006-01-11T10:14:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	reboot man ;)
2006-01-11T10:16:00.000Z	psusi	dabaR	my guess is that the drive does not like dma mode or something
2006-01-11T10:17:00.000Z	dabaR	psusi	OK, well, at least my hdd got umounted, that is an improvement.
