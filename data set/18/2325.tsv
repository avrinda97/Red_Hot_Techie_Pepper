2010-06-16T06:02:00.000Z	Bradleyd		Can anyone help me with my problem?
2010-06-16T06:02:00.000Z	Bradleyd		can someone look at this and tell me if its something to do with my graphics? http://img.imgland.net/127644794581.png     Its a game called Tibia i play and they have a Linux client
2010-06-16T06:03:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Bradleyd	well it's the gpu, graphics exceeding your machine specs or a software glitch.  Run other graphic intensive apps/games.  If you see it again, suspect the card or your specs
2010-06-16T06:04:00.000Z	Bradleyd	acerimmer_	I had it running using wine so i can use the Windows Client but when I try to open that now it says Video Surface something error
2010-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Bradleyd	ah. i must have missed that part.  anyway, as u know, wine doesn't always fly perfect...
2010-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	Bradleyd		acerimmer: It says Video surface allocation failed. (Error Code 13)  Please choose another video graphics mode.    and then it goes off when i press Ok

2010-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Bradleyd	I rarely use wine.  ask again in this channel and also check #winehq
2010-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	Bradleyd		It says something about opengl
2010-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	Bradleyd		Direct3D9 is not available without OpenGL.
2010-06-16T06:12:00.000Z	Bradleyd		What does this mean? Direct3D9 is not available without OpenGL.
2010-06-16T06:12:00.000Z	Bradleyd		   I need to get OpenGL?
2010-06-16T06:17:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Bradleyd	do a search of your filesystem for open gl - almost certain you'll find it.  and really, ask the #winehq folks about this bcz they probably know more than us
