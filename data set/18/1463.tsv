2011-03-02T02:21:00.000Z	MarkB		I'm experiencing problems with Compiz on my Xubuntu 10.10 system, could someone help me?
2011-03-02T02:22:00.000Z	MarkB		Because I wanted to make sure someone was listenting, is rather long.  But, okay I will state my question.
2011-03-02T02:24:00.000Z	MarkB		I am running Xubuntu 10.10 and I installed compiz-core with the plugins, the settings manager and whatnot.  I have Nvidia GeForce 8400 GS, Compiz Check said I was blacklisted and Compiz may not work, but I continued to see if it would.  It obviously does not work, but now my Window Headers do not appear unless I run Compiz I un-installled it and they do not appear on my Windows.  So I had to re-install it to get them working, how can I get
2011-03-02T02:24:00.000Z	MarkB		them back without using Compiz?
2011-03-02T02:25:00.000Z	MarkB		Anyone have a clue what to do?  I'd rather not re-install my system..
2011-03-02T02:26:00.000Z	MarkB		Guess not...oh well I'll just re-install my OS then.
2011-03-02T02:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	MarkB	you have to tell xfce to use the original window manager of xfce--> xfwm4
2011-03-02T02:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	MarkB	run « xfwm4 --replace » ?
2011-03-02T02:27:00.000Z	MarkB		So I can now safely un-install Compiz?
2011-03-02T02:28:00.000Z	MarkB		And my Window Headers will still be there.
2011-03-02T02:28:00.000Z	MarkB		You do?  512 MB PCI?
2011-03-02T02:30:00.000Z	MarkB	erUSUL	 Can I remove Compiz from my Computer and restart it, and my Window Headers will still be there?
2011-03-02T02:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	MarkB	did you do the « xfwm4 --replace » ?
2011-03-02T02:31:00.000Z	MarkB	erUSUL	 Yes sir.
2011-03-02T02:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	MarkB	i really dunno for sure never used xfce. maybe in #xubuntu you can confirm
2011-03-02T02:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	MarkB	in gnome that would work
2011-03-02T02:34:00.000Z	MarkB		Okay, thank you erUSUL I guess I will check with Xubuntu chat.
2011-03-02T02:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	MarkB	no problem
