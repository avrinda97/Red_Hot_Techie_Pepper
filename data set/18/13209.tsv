2005-12-25T14:46:00.000Z	h4x		one thing that i didnt like about firefox is the lack of plugins already installed

2005-12-25T14:46:00.000Z	h4x		i agree with nicholaspaul, but i do have an open mind to browser suggestions
2005-12-25T14:47:00.000Z	topyli	h4x	dillo is a very small and light browser that is strictly for html. no plugins, no java, no nothing
2005-12-25T14:48:00.000Z	h4x		it formats the html right? or is it raw output. topyli
2005-12-25T14:49:00.000Z	h4x		i'll try opera
2005-12-25T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	h4x	it shows html all right, formatted and laid out like any graphical browser. but that's all it does. it's very fast :)
2005-12-25T14:50:00.000Z	h4x		can i have some links to opera or dillo
2005-12-25T14:50:00.000Z	h4x		I'll google them. thanks for the help
2005-12-25T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	h4x	try opera.com and dillo.org. or try to make a better guess :)
