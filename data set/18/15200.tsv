2007-09-26T10:08:00.000Z	Ritzerisk		] is there a command besides unzip or a zip file ....
2007-09-26T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	plenty of them, what are you trying to unpack
2007-09-26T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	sudo aptitude install zip unzip
2007-09-26T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	or find them in synaptic for installation
2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	and since I finally really read the subtext, look for asterisk in synaptic, you can get it from the repos (highly preferred)
2007-09-27T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	what directory do you have the sources in. Did you have to use sudo to unpack the tar?
2007-09-27T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	move the working directory to your home directory, and chown it to yourself. Easier to work that way
2007-09-27T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	the install location won't change, it's defined in the makefile
2007-09-27T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	a few more nouns, fewer pronouns, please
2007-09-27T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	and any particular reason you're not using asterisk from the repos?
2007-09-27T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	you running ubuntu?
2007-09-27T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	system->admin->synaptic,  ctrl-f , search for asterisk
2007-09-27T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	glad to hear you gave up on the vmware appliance ;)
2007-09-27T08:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	try installing build-essential with synaptic
2007-09-27T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	you can't do the apt-get thing with synaptic open, only one package manager at a time
2007-09-27T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	libncurses5-dev (hopefully that covers termcap)
2007-09-27T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Ritzerisk	if you're trying to write a config file outside of your home, you need to use sudo privileges. gksudo gedit in a terminal
