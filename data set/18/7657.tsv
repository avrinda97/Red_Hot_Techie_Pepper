2010-03-02T21:59:00.000Z	jcrawford		so anyone that can help with the ubuntu install of apache or should i ask in #apache?
2010-03-02T22:00:00.000Z	jcrawford		not sure why the error log is saying it cannot read an .htaccess file in my user directory.  I am not even sure why it is looking in my user directory ~/.htaccess
2010-03-02T22:01:00.000Z	jcrawford		my vhost is correct, i have checked several times
2010-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	jcrawford		but for some reason my install is seeking out an .htaccess in /home/jocrawfo/ which is nothing I setup
2010-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	jcrawford		and I do not need MySQL installed just Apache
2010-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	jcrawford		so marking by task is not what I need
2010-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	jcrawford		:)
2010-03-02T22:05:00.000Z	Pici	jcrawford	Why is apache looking at your home directory, did you setup a vhost to look there? If so, then www-data needs to be able to read the directory, even if you don't have an .htaccess file there.
2010-03-02T22:06:00.000Z	jcrawford	Pici	no i did not set my vhost to be there, my vhost is /home/jocrawfo/workspace/ovife/
2010-03-02T22:06:00.000Z	Pici	jcrawford	Hm.. Then it shouldn't really care.  I think that #httpd might be able to help you more (thats the Apache support channel)
2010-03-02T22:07:00.000Z	jcrawford	Pici	thanks i was not sure if they would support the ubuntu install as it is not typical :)
2010-03-15T16:26:00.000Z	Pici	jcrawford	You can modify those from the bookmarks menu in any Nautilus window.
2010-05-12T23:52:00.000Z	Pici	jcrawford	Please refrain from using lmgtfy links here.
2010-05-12T23:52:00.000Z	jcrawford	Pici	why is that?
2010-05-12T23:52:00.000Z	Pici	jcrawford	Because thats not the purpose of this channel.
2010-05-12T23:53:00.000Z	jcrawford	Pici	so spoonfeeding is the purpose?
2010-10-26T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	jcrawford	Run every minute.
2010-10-26T20:01:00.000Z	jcrawford	Pici	thanks
