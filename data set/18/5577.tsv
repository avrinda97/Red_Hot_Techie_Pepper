2008-09-23T13:56:00.000Z	lunacia		I'm new to Ubuntu, as I installed it last night... It's mostly wonderful, but I don't have any sound... The driver is fine, and it's playing, but no sound. The speakers are set to max.
2008-09-23T13:57:00.000Z	lunacia		done
2008-09-23T13:58:00.000Z	lunacia		still no sound
2008-09-23T13:59:00.000Z	lunacia		Hm... Now the player stopped.
2008-09-23T13:59:00.000Z	lunacia		Odd

2008-09-23T14:01:00.000Z	brandonmpace	lunacia	When ubuntu 8.10 comes out on October 30th, be sure to try a clean install of that, as it supports more hardware
2008-09-23T14:02:00.000Z	brandonmpace	lunacia	do you see a sound device when you do this on the terminal?       lshal | grep sound
2008-09-23T14:04:00.000Z	brandonmpace	lunacia	if you search through the output of  lshal   and find your sound card I may be able to help you.
