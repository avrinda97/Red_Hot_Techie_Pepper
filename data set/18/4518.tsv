2009-03-29T11:24:00.000Z	Sapta		Do swap and root both need to be on primary HD partitions?
2009-03-29T11:25:00.000Z	Sapta		*separate primary HD partitions?
2009-03-29T11:27:00.000Z	Sapta		Actually I am having problem creating primary partitions, max limit has been reached.
2009-03-29T11:28:00.000Z	Sapta		it's a dell laptop, has too many primary partitions. Anyone here has  a dell laptop?
2009-03-29T11:28:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	you can only create 4 primary partitions
2009-03-29T11:33:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	there's no problem with creating root on an extended partition
2009-03-29T11:33:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	on this laptop, swap and /home are on primaries, while root is on extended
2009-03-29T11:34:00.000Z	Sapta	dayo	that's a solution. Do I need /home? And I do, does it need to be on primary partition?
2009-03-29T11:35:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	i put /home on a primary, because i want to be able to retain my data, in case i need to reinstall. but no, u do not need to explicitly create /home. it would be created for u under /
2009-03-29T11:47:00.000Z	Sapta	dayo	If I put / and /home on separate logical drives, can't I retain /home after reinstall?
2009-03-29T11:47:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	yes
2009-03-29T12:28:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	i usually go 2xRAM size for swap. and for slash home, i subtract about 10-15GB for / and give the remainder to /home
2009-03-29T12:29:00.000Z	Sapta	dayo	don't say remainder, plz ;)  what's the size for /home?
2009-03-29T12:30:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	it depends on the amount of freespace u got. /home can be 5GB or 5TB
2009-03-29T12:33:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	how big is your RAM? give swap twice that. give / 15GB. then give whatever u like to /home
2009-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	Sapta	dayo	ram is 2 gb
2009-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	then your swap is 4gb
2009-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	dayo	Sapta	ok
