2012-10-19T09:04:00.000Z	d3m0nk		12.10 updates screwed up the video playback... anybody had this issue? known fix?
2012-10-19T09:05:00.000Z	d3m0nk		I tried reinstalling the gstreamer plugins, vlc etc.
2012-10-19T09:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	d3m0nk	what player?  have you changed your VO output from XV to something else?  (common blue tint issue)
2012-10-19T09:06:00.000Z	d3m0nk	zykotick9	yeh I did the blue tint fix... applied patch for libvpau or something I remember sometime back...
2012-10-19T09:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	d3m0nk	fyi gstreamer probably defaults to XV
2012-10-19T09:07:00.000Z	d3m0nk	zykotick9	hmm checking...
2012-10-19T09:08:00.000Z	d3m0nk	zykotick9	I had it set to OpenGL / XCB
2012-10-19T09:08:00.000Z	d3m0nk		changed to XV and still won't work
2012-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	d3m0nk		some videos play okay... like .mov etc...
2012-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	d3m0nk	;) i would have expected opengl TO work, and XV NOT to work ;)  sorry i don't have any further suggestions.  good luck.
2012-10-19T09:10:00.000Z	d3m0nk		Movie Player (default Player and UMPlayer) say "stream contains no data" etc.
2012-10-19T09:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	d3m0nk	that sounds like a possible codec issue.  try "mplayer".
2012-10-19T09:11:00.000Z	d3m0nk	zykotick9	yeah codec issue is the likeliest... but I've installed and updated all of em :(
2012-10-19T09:11:00.000Z	d3m0nk		gstream, the good, the bad and the ugly ;)
2012-10-19T09:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	d3m0nk	do you use mplayer with medibuntu's w32-something or w64-something?  that's a real test ;)
2012-10-19T09:12:00.000Z	d3m0nk	zykotick9	nop dude.. btw I use gnome UI & lxde...
2012-10-19T09:13:00.000Z	d3m0nk		I'm too slow and dumb to understand unity
2012-10-19T09:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	d3m0nk	i believe everyone should choose the DE/WM they want to work in.  then choose a gnu/linux distro that enables that selection (FYI ubuntu from mini (see "/msg ubottu mini" for details) can allow you to select NO DE/WM by default.  so just a "naked" ubuntu - install ONLY what you want from "sudo apt-get install foo" ;)
