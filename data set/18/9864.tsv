2009-05-29T19:00:00.000Z	gbjk		Hi. I have a Thinkpad T60 next to me. I upgraded from 8.04 to 9.04. This caused screen hangs, after a downgrade of the xorg-video-driver.
2009-05-29T19:00:00.000Z	gbjk		Without finding a solution I went for a 8.10 reinstall.
2009-05-29T19:00:00.000Z	gbjk		I did this without formatting the drive.
2009-05-29T19:00:00.000Z	gbjk		On boot, the laptop doesn't show a login screen.
2009-05-29T19:01:00.000Z	gbjk		Xorg.0.log suggests several points of failure.
2009-05-29T19:01:00.000Z	sipior	gbjk	without formatting the drive? hmm...that could cause no end of excitement. do you not have a separate /home?
2009-05-29T19:02:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	*Apparently* I was a wang when I installed this one, and forgot to create a separate partition for /home/
2009-05-29T19:02:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	I then went and did the same thing again with the new install, actually, forgetting to create a second partition (though I didn't fancy dynamic resizing)
2009-05-29T19:03:00.000Z	sipior	gbjk	simplest to backup your data, do the reinstall, and then restore, i think.
2009-05-29T19:03:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	However xubuntu install *did* warn that it would blow away /var/, /lib/, /etc/ etc.
2009-05-29T19:03:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	So it seemed vaguely sane to try installing over the top.
2009-05-29T19:03:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	I'm doing a mostly slow backup now, but wanted to look for alternatives.
2011-05-11T15:07:00.000Z	sipior	gbjk	didn't think they made those anymore. no clickable scroll wheel?

2011-05-11T15:09:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	Since I use a datahand, I need a static mouse between the hands.
2011-05-11T15:09:00.000Z	sipior	gbjk	ah, of course :-)
2011-05-11T15:10:00.000Z	sipior	gbjk	does pressing both buttons simultaneously emulate button 3?
2011-05-11T15:10:00.000Z	gbjk	sipior	Not now. Used to. I can fix with xinput set-prop on the device, I guess.
