2011-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	rawfodog_		My sdcard reader will only mount cards as read only. I don't know what to do, even sudo won't work
2011-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	rawfodog_		I check the switch obviously.
2011-09-02T07:45:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	Have you tried remounting manually using -o remount,rw?
2011-09-02T07:45:00.000Z	rawfodog_	Polah	what is the command to do that ?
2011-09-02T07:45:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	mount -o remount,rw /dev/device /media/mountpoint
2011-09-02T07:47:00.000Z	rawfodog_	Polah	how do I found out the device ?
2011-09-02T07:48:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	mount -l should give you a list of mounted devices, insert the SD card and run it and then pastebin the output for me please

2011-09-02T07:50:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	NintendoDS SD card, right?
2011-09-02T07:51:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	Do this: sudo mkdir /media/ds && sudo mount -t vfat -o remount,defaults /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/ds
2011-09-02T07:52:00.000Z	rawfodog_	Polah	"mount: /media/ds not mounted already, or bad option"
2011-09-02T07:53:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	Oh, sorry. Do this this:   sudo umount /media/NintendoDS && mount -t vfat -o defaults /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/ds
2011-09-02T07:55:00.000Z	rawfodog_	Polah	"mount: only root can do that"
2011-09-02T07:55:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	Oops again, I'm doing so bad. put sudo before mount on that last line I gave you
2011-09-02T07:56:00.000Z	rawfodog_	Polah	"mount: block device /dev/mmcblk0p1 is write-protected, mounting read-only
2011-09-02T07:59:00.000Z	Polah	rawfodog_	sudo mount -t vfat -o remount,defaults,force /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/ds
2011-09-02T08:00:00.000Z	rawfodog_	Polah	my screen just went black and all the bash text appeared
