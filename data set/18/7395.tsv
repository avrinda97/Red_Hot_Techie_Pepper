2008-01-25T20:30:00.000Z	_nmap		I'm looking for a emule client for ubuntu. Whats the package name for a apt-get install?
2008-01-25T20:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	amule
2010-01-18T21:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	probably the routing table  is invalid after configuring the eth1 connection
2010-01-18T21:36:00.000Z	_nmap	erUSUL	if i put iptables -F is to work fine?
2010-01-18T21:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	what does iptables have to do with the routing table?
2010-01-18T21:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	i think that when you add the eth1 connection you end up with two default gateaways and you only can have one
2010-01-18T21:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	but to be sure you have to check the output od « ip route »
2010-01-18T21:43:00.000Z	_nmap	erUSUL	here is what im trying to do... I want to share the wlan0 connection with a other pc connected in the eth1. Wlan0 is DHCP with my router hardware. So to do this i need to manually make a eth1 connection with other pc and use iptables to share connection right?
2010-01-18T21:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	yes
2010-01-18T21:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	that'as a way to do it
2010-01-18T21:45:00.000Z	_nmap	erUSUL	a simple sudo ifconfig eth1 10.1.1.100 is a correct way to manually enter an ip to eth1?
2010-01-18T21:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	yes
2010-01-18T21:50:00.000Z	_nmap	erUSUL	ok thanks, seems to be ok now. Both computers are ping each other
2010-01-18T21:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	to make the change permanent you will have to use the interfaces file /etc/network/interfaces
2010-01-18T21:54:00.000Z	_nmap	erUSUL	to share the command iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE  is right?
2010-01-18T21:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	i think you have to specify the in interface add  "-i eth1" ?
2010-01-18T21:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	_nmap	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
2010-01-18T21:57:00.000Z	_nmap	erUSUL	thakns for the tip man. I will restart know to see if works
