2005-12-03T11:00:00.000Z	kvantti		hey crimsun, is there plans for a modern fps like cube to be added to the synaptic? that game is open source, and i have long wondered why there is no modern fps games found in the synaptic..
2005-12-03T11:01:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	what's the license?
2005-12-03T11:01:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	let me see
2005-12-03T11:01:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	the site is: http://wouter.fov120.com/cube/
2005-12-03T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	it _may_ be able to be included in universe due to the zlib license but certainly won't be in main for Dapper
2005-12-03T11:03:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	of course :) thankyou
2005-12-03T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	if you would like to see it in Ubuntu, please add it to the list of candidates that we track for universe/multiverse
2005-12-03T11:04:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	is that list in the wiki since i do not have any dev contacts?
2005-12-03T11:04:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	yes
2005-12-03T11:07:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	is there some kind of identifier for the page you can give me..i am in the CategoryDocumentation section. or a link, please?
2005-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	please start with https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UniverseCandidates
2005-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	thanks
2005-12-03T11:10:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	i discovered that cube is allready a candidate. it looks like the word has gotten around :)
2005-12-03T11:11:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	if not all parts of the software are open source, would that mean that the un-parts will be in multiverse, or could it hinder the process?
2005-12-03T11:13:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	which parts aren't open?
2005-12-03T11:13:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	the network code
2005-12-03T11:13:00.000Z	crimsun	kvantti	yes, the license will be a hindrance
2005-12-03T11:14:00.000Z	kvantti	crimsun	so more waiting..well, atleast we got wolfenstein et and it actually has a good installer :)
