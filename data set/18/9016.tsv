2007-06-05T08:24:00.000Z	aMMuNix		can someone show me how to download latest source files from CVS and install them? (gstreamer)
2007-06-05T08:25:00.000Z	tarzeau	aMMuNix	you'd take the current gstreamer debian source package, and make an update from the cvs version
2007-06-05T08:25:00.000Z	tarzeau	aMMuNix	www.linuks.mine.nu/irc/debian-packaging/
2007-06-05T08:26:00.000Z	aMMuNix	tarzeau	will that link explain step-by-step?
2007-06-05T08:26:00.000Z	aMMuNix	tarzeau	I'm still pretty new
2007-06-05T08:26:00.000Z	tarzeau	aMMuNix	more or less, it doesn't tell about cvs
2007-06-05T08:26:00.000Z	tarzeau	aMMuNix	there's even some deb cvs tools, i never use them
2007-06-05T08:27:00.000Z	aMMuNix	tarzeau	never used any source files, always downloaded from a site\synaptic, do you know a guide where I can see a complete step-by-step?
