2011-01-26T13:18:00.000Z	bhavesh	blackout	in the terminal
2011-01-26T13:18:00.000Z	bhavesh	blackout	ok so first of all from your live CD, boot in ubuntu
2011-01-26T13:19:00.000Z	bhavesh	blackout	then open Applications > Accessories > Terminal
2011-01-26T13:19:00.000Z	bhavesh	blackout	in the terminal type sudo update-grub2
2011-01-26T13:20:00.000Z	bhavesh	blackout	if it gives the result( it finds linus and windows) then thats it
