2006-01-04T12:38:00.000Z	Joe4		how can i tell if my ubuntu has found my nic anyway, because i havent installed any drivers for it, and its onboard, but i did "activate" it
2006-01-04T12:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	 are you using the same pc in linux right now?
2006-01-04T12:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	 use lspci command
2006-01-04T12:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	 you asked how to see if ubuntu sees your nic that command should tell you
2006-01-04T12:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	what is your nic card?
2006-01-04T12:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	 is it an NE2000 with a D10022 rev5 chipset?
2006-01-04T12:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	 wait a few more things ill check
2006-01-04T12:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	it is wired right?
2006-01-04T12:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Joe4	 when you get access to ubuntu open terminal and type lspci if it doesnt list your nic than you might need drivers for it for that command you dont need to be online
