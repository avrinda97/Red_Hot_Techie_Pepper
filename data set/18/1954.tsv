2012-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	cordoval		mouse all of a sudden stops working or being recognized
2012-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	cordoval		how to make it *look the usb mouse?
2012-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	NewWorld	cordoval	 when it stops working is the light on it still on?
2012-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	cordoval		the mouse pad on the laptop works and everything but i can see how the light on the mouse just dies
2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	cordoval		no it is not, when i am plugging it again it goes on but then dies again once the plug is all the way in
2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	NewWorld	cordoval	 Maybe it's just a hardware problem? Try it on another machine
2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	cordoval		it is kind of in between that it lits up gain but it does not recognize it again
2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	cordoval		no it is not a hardware problem this works perfect even on ubuntu before
2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	cordoval		so it hppens radomly
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	NewWorld	cordoval	 Don't push it in all the way. Push it only enough to keep the light on
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	cordoval		i mean there has to be  a way or an explanation NewWorld
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	cordoval		ok i can leave it half way but that does not seem to be a solution
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	cordoval		as it can be on but not recognized
2012-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	NewWorld	cordoval	 You say it switches on as you push it in, but once all the way in it switches off. So push it in NOT all the way
2012-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	cordoval		it is as if ubuntu is lazy recognizing hardware, i think there have been times when i plug after a while and it recognizes it again
2012-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	NewWorld	cordoval	 Make it stay on the sweet spot where the light is on
2012-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	cordoval	NewWorld	that does not solve the problem
