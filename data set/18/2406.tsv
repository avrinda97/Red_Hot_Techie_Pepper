2010-05-22T23:58:00.000Z	tripelb		I've got a problem using the torrent download for Ubuntu 9.10 with Transmission. My system is an AMD 9.10 upgrade from 9.04  -  I have two hard drives. Both are mounted. The second is NTFS which is my target drive. What I get is: Error: Permission denied (/media/ubuntu-9.10desktop-i386.iso)  In preferences a directory is chosen on the 2nd drive. I resaved the preferences and tried again. Same story, morning glory.
2010-05-22T23:59:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	u think u need to set write permission properly
2010-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	I checked properties, it seemed ok. I am the only user.
2010-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	sudo nautilus "/second drive mount point" and right click on mounted folder and change permissions to your username and not root
2010-05-23T00:01:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	remove the "" of course
2010-05-23T00:01:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	oh this time it's different and the permissions cannot be determined. (now I'll do what you just said)
2010-05-23T00:02:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	oh no lots of errors. couldnt find the 2nd drive mount point. ??
2010-05-23T00:03:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	what is the address of your second drive where u want to torrents to be saved?
2010-05-23T00:06:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	what is the address of a drive?
2010-05-23T00:07:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	did your problem get resolved?
2010-05-23T00:09:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	I'm going to get the verbose reply I got and put it in a pastebin
2010-05-23T00:18:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	OK I mounted and unmounted it a 3rd time and now I can get into permissions and it looks good but (same results) The reply in terminal  http://paste.ubuntu.com/437977/ -- the reply from the gui  http://paste.ubuntu.com/437979/

2010-05-23T00:23:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	just open the folder u want to save the torrents in and check the name of the folder in the address bar and paste here what it is. your address bar at the top of the window that shows the folders content
2010-05-23T00:28:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	instead of using "/second drive name" or whatever i said earlier try using /media/3A30C15E30C1222D and see what happens
2010-05-23T00:53:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	can u read the partition where u want to store the torrent?
2010-05-23T01:03:00.000Z	tripelb	The_Wanderer_	Can I read it? I can see it in file-browser. I can see the directories. I can make directories and store files  on it, ie read and write.
2010-05-23T01:04:00.000Z	The_Wanderer_	tripelb	hmm, did u set up the save to location in transmission properly?
