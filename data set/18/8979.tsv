2007-05-29T12:05:00.000Z	AlexanderM		can anyone tell me how i can change my theme with emerald/beryl?
2007-05-29T12:06:00.000Z	kkathman	AlexanderM	 use beryl-manager
2007-05-29T12:07:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	but where is the option?:P didn't find it, or i'm i jus keeping my eyes shut?
2007-05-29T12:07:00.000Z	kkathman	AlexanderM	 right click on beryl-manager - then look at emerald
2007-05-29T12:07:00.000Z	kkathman		those are your themes
2007-05-29T12:08:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	i see several themes, but how can i change? double-clicking doesn't do the trick. right clicking doesnt?
2007-05-29T12:08:00.000Z	kkathman		hmm normally you just click on it and it changes...thats what happens for me - be sure you have chosen beryl  too
2007-05-29T12:09:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	window manager > beryl, window decorator > emerald (beryl)
2007-05-29T12:09:00.000Z	kkathman		yep
2007-05-29T12:10:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	 ah emerald-replace in console did the trick
2007-05-29T12:10:00.000Z	kkathman		:)
2007-05-29T12:10:00.000Z	kkathman		good :)
2007-05-29T12:10:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	but i have to do it everytime i select another theme :P
2007-05-29T12:11:00.000Z	kkathman	AlexanderM	 not sure why - thats true here in ubuntu, but not other distros...perhaps a different version :)
2007-05-29T12:11:00.000Z	kkathman		I havent researched it
2007-05-29T12:11:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	installed yesterday, ahh what the hell it works:D
2007-05-29T12:11:00.000Z	AlexanderM	kkathman	thank you:)!
2007-05-29T12:12:00.000Z	kkathman	AlexanderM	 if it works dont fix it :)   you're welcome :)
