2010-03-03T08:19:00.000Z	sixofour		its taking forever to open these logs
2010-03-03T08:19:00.000Z	sixofour		i'm |604| btw
2010-03-03T08:20:00.000Z	sixofour		is there any way to put a hard size limit on all log files?
2010-03-03T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	Even with "less filename.log" ?
2010-03-03T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	It's a utility for viewing files. Try it.
2010-03-03T08:23:00.000Z	sixofour	Jordan_U	the logs don't have anything of note
2010-03-03T08:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	With logrotate.
2010-03-03T08:55:00.000Z	sixofour	Jordan_U	 how don i do that/
2010-03-03T09:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	/etc/logrotate.conf You probably want to uncomment "compress" and add something like "size 500M"
2010-03-03T09:00:00.000Z	sixofour	Jordan_U	i want to do like size 100m max
2010-03-03T09:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	That's fine
2010-03-03T09:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	It rotates the logs after they become the specified size, by default 4 copies are kept but you can change that.
2010-03-03T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	compress will also help a LOT since it's text.
2010-03-03T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	Change "rotate 4" to "rotate 0" then.
2010-03-03T09:05:00.000Z	sixofour	Jordan_U	where do i put the size 20m option/
2010-03-03T09:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	Anywhere, but right before the rotate option is probably a good place since they are related.
2010-03-03T09:38:00.000Z	sixofour	Jordan_U	i seem to have kde working, and i am on the rt-kernal, but no sound :/
2010-03-03T09:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sixofour	No idea about the sound issue.
