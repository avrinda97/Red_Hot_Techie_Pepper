2010-03-08T21:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	sloopy, usr13: There is no problem that that would be an appropriate solution for.
2010-03-08T21:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	usr13: If you were to pipe /dev/urandom over your /etc/bash.bashrc, that would be a "bad thing".
2010-03-08T21:42:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	If you have a live-cd, we could pastebin you a proper /etc/bash.bashrc file to restore it.
2010-03-08T21:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	Presumably you installed Ubuntu using one
2010-03-08T21:44:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/391159/ Here's a copy of my /etc/bash.bashrc, feel free to copy over yours with it
2010-03-08T21:45:00.000Z	mrdk	ASULutzy	alright, but I can't boot my pc :/. How can I edit that file?
2010-03-08T21:45:00.000Z	mrdk	ASULutzy	is vi an editor?
2010-03-08T21:46:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	Use a live-cd of some kind. The Ubuntu installer CD would work. You'd want to boot off the live-cd, then mount the filesystem, then edit /etc/bash.bashrc to contain the contents of that pastebin. And yes, vi is an editor.
2010-03-08T21:47:00.000Z	mrdk	ASULutzy	ok, I'm already trying to boot the cd
2010-03-08T21:48:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	I'm not sure what the rules are on the ubuntu forums, but whoever told you to do that was clearly being malicious. You should PM a moderator or something about it; we don't need malicious users trying to hose up peoples' systems.
2010-03-08T21:49:00.000Z	mrdk	ASULutzy	I did, but after two PMs noone wrote back..
2010-03-08T21:50:00.000Z	mrdk	ASULutzy	would a zfs rollback work?
2010-03-08T21:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	Maybe? I don't use ZFS :P
2010-03-08T22:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy	mrdk	I smell a troll :)
2010-03-08T22:02:00.000Z	mrdk	ASULutzy	I don't play wow :|
