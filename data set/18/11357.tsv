2007-08-21T14:26:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	shut it. Im not asking about gutsy at all, actually im wishing that ubuntu would get a clue about what their people want.
2007-08-21T14:27:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	then you should have a launchpad account and be doing contributions via that tool
2007-08-21T14:29:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	actually https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/126152 . See how far that has got me?
2007-08-21T14:30:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	someone came in a while ago and read the fix and it worked for them
2007-08-21T14:30:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	to my firewire drive problem? on LAUNCHPAD?
2007-08-21T14:31:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	sorry wrong bug -
2007-08-21T14:33:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	did you even check out my post on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/126152 ? if you could help me figure out why that isnt working, that would be much appreciated. but i feel as if i am on my own on the firewire drive problem. this long an no reply from ubuntu? call me goofy, but it seems to me some stuff gets better each new release, and then some stuff just breaks.
2007-08-21T14:35:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	can you remove the other devices and plug it into the various sockets on the box .. just in case something is clashing - it is not likely but could be the case at times usb is a bit of a dark horse, I am reading your bug very very slowly
2007-08-21T14:36:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	its using firewire for the connection. i only have one other thing plugged into firewire, which is another 500gb hd
2007-08-21T14:38:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	very disappointed in the whole launchpad experience just because of this issue. i mean, it worked on edgy eft but now it doesnt on feisty but my newer seagate freeagent pro drive does? especially it being a ntfs drive on the freeagent and a fat on the regular seagate 500gb? come on, call me goofy but am i the only one that sees thats?
2007-08-21T14:40:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	goofy (as you asked me to ;-)) ehh I don't have one to play with and I doubt that others do to, it looks like a kernel issue looking around google - the got wrong page seems to be your kernel calling something it should not - but that aside can you try it as a usb drive as a hack in the medium term
2007-08-21T14:42:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	and for the fun of it download gutsy and see if it works with that
2007-08-21T14:42:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	i really do want to try gutsy, especially with all the new kernel improvements. it sounds great. seriously.
2007-08-21T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	test the live CD if it does not work with that get that bug into the gutsy tree
2007-08-21T14:46:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	http://osdir.com/ml/linux.kernel.firewire.user/2006-05/msg00002.html seems to throw some light on the problem
2007-08-21T14:47:00.000Z	justin420	ompaul	thanks for the link! will check it out when i have more patience; and also when i too have had less beers!
2007-08-21T14:49:00.000Z	ompaul	justin420	it gives a $solution for values of solution ~( ugly kid hack ) ~
