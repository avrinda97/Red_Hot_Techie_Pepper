2005-10-03T06:51:00.000Z	linner		hey guys, now I have a question... I've tried installing the NDISwrapper for my (don't pull your hair out now) broadcom wlan for my Compaq V2000Z.  I've been following the instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToSetUpNdiswrapper and am stuck at line 5.   I don't see the wlan0 in my Sys -> Admin -> Networking spot.
2005-10-03T06:52:00.000Z	linner		where do i go from here?
2005-10-03T06:52:00.000Z	nixiac	linner	you made progress!  an hour ago you were stuck at line 4!  Been there, done that, but, you did it quicker!
2005-10-03T06:53:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 *smile*  woo hoo!
2005-10-03T06:53:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 did you get it installed?
2005-10-03T06:55:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 where can i get that magazine????
2005-10-03T06:56:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 maybe that's what i need
2005-10-03T06:58:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 then if you got it set up.... can you help me??? *wink wink wink*
2005-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 I didnt' see anything about desktop and fileserver options in here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToSetUpNdiswrapper
2005-10-03T07:06:00.000Z	nixiac	linner	I thought that the VESA driver is the OLDER video standard, and actully, if I want really good resolution, etc. from a Linux listed peice of video hardware, then, I should use the driver for that piece of listed hardware... such as an Nvidia card driver, instead of the VESA driver, but, mayhap some Xpert can chime in?
2005-10-03T07:07:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 I have a very, very new laptop and my particular card.. the ati 200m, can't run anything including a radeon driver... it has to use the VESA
2005-10-03T07:08:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 it's not perfect... such as I can't standby or hibernate with out serious problems... but crap, as long as I can run linux instead of windows I'm a happy camper
2005-10-03T07:08:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 i just need my wireless card to work so that i can work remotely at my client sitesw
2005-10-03T07:09:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 that's why I was asking for your help in getting it up and running
2005-10-03T07:10:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 re: using the VESA driver, do you understand now why it works?
2005-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 right on... and because it's a desktop already it's an easier workaround :)
2005-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	nixiac	linner	yeah, been there. VESA is great for my servers, or, when I don't really know what it is, and the installer selects it forme... anything to get up!
2005-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	linner	nixiac	 exactly dude!
