2008-09-09T05:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	I've tried it in Windows and to say it is still rough is an understatement.
2008-09-09T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	i'll just wait til it matures
2008-10-18T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	compiz is quite light. it just ruins everything else
2008-10-18T06:46:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	haha, I know, but I wasn't really talking about its weight either
2008-10-18T06:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	i think compiz is garbage
2008-10-18T06:47:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	I more or less agree/ I used to use it, and I've always had hardware capable of it, but I got very irritated with it, very quickly.
2008-10-18T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	same here, fluxbox all the way for me
2009-04-27T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	easier to put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-04-27T01:39:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	I know, but I like things to be global.
2009-04-27T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	fair play
2009-11-30T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	what about if you rename ~/.mozilla
2009-11-30T00:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	I'll give it a try
2009-11-30T00:39:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	no change.........It doesn't really bother me browsing this way, I just know it's a bad idea. It IS my fault, since I was just being lazy :P
2009-11-30T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	its a real bad idea. Did you download the tar.gz and install that way or did you use the repo?
2009-11-30T00:41:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	The tar. I've done it a thousand times over the past few years. I just didn't feel like updating it the way I know I should.
2009-11-30T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bobertdos	use: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ppa   much easier
2009-11-30T00:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	ActionParsnip	well, would you look at that......I didn't know they posted the daily builds like that....thanks
