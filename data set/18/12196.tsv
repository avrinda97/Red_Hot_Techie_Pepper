2006-08-05T15:39:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	sameer	it keeps asking for a fs type
2006-08-05T15:39:00.000Z	sameer	nicholaspaul	is it ntfs ??
2006-08-05T15:39:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	sameer	i think its ext, but it doesnt like that.
2006-08-05T15:41:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	sameer	 sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda /mnt/tmp = wonf fs type bad option, bad superblock or too many mounted file systems.

2006-08-05T15:42:00.000Z	sameer		try fdisk -l /dev/hda_numb
