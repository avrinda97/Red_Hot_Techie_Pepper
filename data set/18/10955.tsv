2008-04-26T09:15:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	look in System Monitor
2008-04-26T09:17:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	8.04 refers to 2008 April ... that means you have Hardy Heron .. the latest release released yesterday
2008-04-26T09:18:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	if you did an upgrade then all your appearance settings are held over .. if you want to see how Hardy is set up on a fresh install then create a new user and log into it... you'll see Hardy's new look
2008-04-26T09:19:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	... oh dear ... go to System/Administration/ UsersandGroups ... you can create a new user there
2008-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	you need to unlock the UsersandGroup feature ... look for an 'Unlock' button there
2008-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	go to System / Quit then choose Log Out ... enter new user's username and password .... voila
2008-04-26T09:54:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	... go to firefox extensions website and serach for a youtube addon
2008-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	seamus7	pawan	download videos from youtube https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=youtube&cat=all   "Video DownloadHelper" looks good
