2007-01-28T06:27:00.000Z	wd		best torrent app, i used bittorent but it's slow anything faster?
2007-01-28T06:27:00.000Z	shatrat	wd	I use azureus. Keep in mind torrents speed up the longer you run them, cause they find more peers
2007-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	wd	shatrat	i couldn't get azureu to config.
2007-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	shatrat	wd	Ive heard lots of people say that.  I've never had a problem with it though
2007-01-28T06:29:00.000Z	wd	shatrat	u use it for torrents or for peer sharing?
2007-01-28T06:29:00.000Z	shatrat	wd	same thing.
2007-01-28T06:30:00.000Z	wd	shatrat	i thought azu was for like peer sharing networks only not for like torrent sites.
2007-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	shatrat	wd	azureues has some plugins that do some wild stuff like distributed tracking and importing torrents from RSS feeds, but basically its a bit torrent client.
2007-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	wd	shatrat	wow
2007-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	wd	shatrat	i'll check out further, what's ur avg dl speed?
