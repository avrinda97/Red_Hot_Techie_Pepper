2008-04-11T12:04:00.000Z	EnvoyRising		does anyone know how to set video options in et:qw? is that missing from linux client or something?
2008-04-11T12:05:00.000Z	EnvoyRising		ah, Madpilot is all over it. doesn't have to be 4 characters, just enough to identify the person without being ambiguous
2008-04-11T12:07:00.000Z	EnvoyRising		an intel graphics card? hmm...i guess you'd avoid proprietary drivers that way..
2008-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	EnvoyRising		alternatively, enable the hardy repos and install from that (should be called prerelease or something)
2008-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	EnvoyRising		better yet, wait two weeks for hardy to come out, all packages are getting updated then (they are now, but it's pre-release)
2008-04-11T12:10:00.000Z	wica_	EnvoyRising	And howdo I add the hardy repos
