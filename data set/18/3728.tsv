2009-11-05T04:59:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	elaborate
2009-11-05T05:01:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	what are "these" "simple" problems?
2009-11-05T05:03:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	What is your simple problem then?
2009-11-05T05:04:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	Mka	ihave a windows cd, ubuntu was opening it before but at this time, it's looking like a blank CD
2009-11-05T05:06:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	this is not a simple problem
2009-11-05T05:06:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	Mka	i thought
2009-11-05T05:07:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	I know about htis
2009-11-05T05:07:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	I guess it's a hardware problem
2009-11-05T05:07:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	Mka	it opens other CD's
2009-11-05T05:07:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	Yes
2009-11-05T05:08:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	I know about this but I cannot explain it. the interesting thing is that even Windows of the same machine gets confused of such a CD/DVD
2009-11-05T05:09:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	Mka	i am more confused than my machine
2009-11-05T05:09:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	I think that your CD/DVD drive is getting bad
2009-11-05T05:10:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	its struggling to read some DVDs or CDs
2009-11-05T05:10:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	Mka	i think not, it was changed nearly..
2009-11-05T05:11:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	But I still do think so. I have confidence on my observations
2009-11-05T05:13:00.000Z	Mka	Hasanibrahim	I run 6 operating systems on one computer and if one of them says a CD is blank, ALL of them will say the same
