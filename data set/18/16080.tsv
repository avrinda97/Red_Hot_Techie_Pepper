2005-03-24T11:50:00.000Z	orospakr		has anyone had gtk-gnutella segfault the moment they click the "Download" button in the search results? I can confirm this on two separate hoary boxes.
2005-03-24T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	could you obtain a backtrace via gdb ?
2005-03-24T11:52:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	yes, it occurs in glib somewhere. :P
2005-03-24T11:52:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	where in glib?
2005-03-24T11:53:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	#0  0xb7b85a4e in g_strdup () from /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0
2005-03-24T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	ok, please file a bug and let me know the bug #.
2005-03-24T11:53:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	ok. :)
2005-03-24T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	I'll look at it in 30 minutes.
2005-03-24T12:05:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	it won't accept 'gtk-gnutella' in the "Package:" field, it seems. Is unknown appropriate?
2005-03-24T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	yes
2005-03-24T12:07:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	bug #7556. :)
2005-03-24T12:07:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	great, thanks.

2005-03-25T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	how's gtk-gnutella? :-)
2005-03-25T10:52:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	working perfectly!
2005-03-25T10:52:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	many thanks!
2005-03-25T10:53:00.000Z	orospakr	crimsun	that was a super-fast update.
2005-03-25T10:53:00.000Z	crimsun	orospakr	I had to test on a couple architectures before uploading else it would have been up earlier.
