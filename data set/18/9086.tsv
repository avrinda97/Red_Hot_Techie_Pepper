2007-05-12T11:14:00.000Z	arya^		anyone feel like recommending a motherboard that wont hang before, during or after the ubuntu install process?
2007-05-12T11:16:00.000Z	arya^		oh, and on a side note: stay away from: Abit AB9, Asus P5N, Asus P5B mobos, unless you have worlds of time to spend hacking kernel code...
2007-05-12T11:17:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	i am thinking of getting the asus p5n sli, what problems does it have?
2007-05-12T11:17:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	SATA controller support
2007-05-12T11:20:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	the one in nforce 650sli? what problems exactly you had with it?
2007-05-12T11:21:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	it's a known bug with that mobo, though I didnt try feisty...
2007-05-12T11:22:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	http://www.linuxquestions.org/hcl/showproduct.php/product/3826 here they report success
2007-05-12T11:24:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	do you have any links describing the problem? i cant find any
2007-05-12T11:24:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	what's your mailing address? I'll send you my dead one and you can see for yourself :-)
2007-05-12T11:27:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	http://www.techimo.com/forum/showthread.php?p=2074295 this problem is what you refer to?
2007-05-12T11:29:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	yeah, it was a display issue... the server install worked fine though
2007-05-12T11:29:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	I lie, the alternate text-only install worked fine...
2007-05-12T11:29:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	display issue? have you tried safe graphics option?
2007-05-12T11:30:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	yeah, tried that. unfortunately, I can't test feisty on it, because after 20 hours of working on it, I smashed it into about 30 pieces.
2007-05-12T11:30:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	in all 64bit versions i have tried, default graphics install didnt work, but safe graphics worked
2007-05-12T11:31:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	only to buy the Abit AB9, and have JMicron sata controller issues :)
2007-05-12T11:31:00.000Z	XLV_feisty	arya^	also you need to set the xserver to use vesa, not nv graphics, then install the nvidia drivers which work ok
2007-05-12T11:32:00.000Z	arya^	XLV_feisty	I wish you luck with yours :-) if you know of another one that works out of the box, let me know.
