2008-12-27T17:33:00.000Z	wolfeySI		hello guys.. i wonder if i can do anything about my "problem" ... well unreal tournament 2004 crashes awfully lot... SIGSEGV... i think i have latest patch and everything
2008-12-27T17:33:00.000Z	wolfeySI		i use ubuntu beta if that makes difference
2008-12-27T17:33:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	you've checked the application database for wine?
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	it's native
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	or it has a native linux client?
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	oh.. sweet..I mean.. not that it's crashing.. but the native client =)
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	i switched to beta some time ago cause my wireless is only supported .27 .. can i switch back to standard now?
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	yah that's why that's only game i ever paid for
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	wolfeySI		and it's still worth it;)
2008-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	which version are you running?
2008-12-27T17:35:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	=) might even buy a copy.. just en encourage them..
2008-12-27T17:35:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	says 8.10 at console, what else can i say.. it is beta i think
2008-12-27T17:36:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	if you've done your updates and such the beta install will turn into a real install when it's available
2008-12-27T17:36:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	oh ok
2008-12-27T17:36:00.000Z	wolfeySI		i update everything that's offered
2008-12-27T17:37:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	it's not that i cant play game... but it crashes once...twice an hour... i kinda suspect it crashes when i try to move when it already lags a bit... like network buffer overflow
2008-12-27T17:39:00.000Z	Slart	wolfeySI	I would start asking around in some unreal forums.. see if anyone else is having issues.. then you can start comparing setups etc to see if there is a common factor. Unless you get some kind of error message that points to something else than just a segfault
2008-12-27T17:40:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Slart	well i started now .24 kernel and i get something about ati drivers
