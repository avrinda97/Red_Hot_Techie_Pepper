2008-03-19T21:35:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	what's the problem
2008-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	sorry, afk; well, it freezes if i have my ipod plugged in
2008-03-19T21:52:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	try starting it from a terminal, with rhythmbox
2008-03-19T21:54:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	well, no message, do window doesn't even appear, it only shows in system monitor, eating 65% of my CPU
2008-03-19T21:55:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	"the window", sorry, i don't know how that "do" got there :))
2008-03-19T21:56:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	I don't really like rhythmbox myself, and i don't have an ipod so i cant reproduce the problem, so maybe you should file a bug.
2008-03-19T21:57:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	what do you use?
2008-03-19T21:58:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	I use Listen at the moment, but there are a plethora of available options
2008-03-19T21:58:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	wow i actually got to use that word :p
2008-03-19T21:58:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	you could try Quod-Libet Exaile Amarok Banshee
2008-03-19T21:59:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	well, how can i make rhythmbox as it was when i installed ubuntu?
2008-03-19T22:00:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	i.e. delete all the settings & stuff
2008-03-19T22:01:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	sudo apt-get purge rhythmbox && sudo apt-get install rhythmbox
2008-03-19T22:01:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	thanks
2008-03-19T22:02:00.000Z	SliMM	Exteris	i love the fact that it is so simple, i need nothing more, and if i really need smth else, i will have a reason to learn python
2008-03-19T22:03:00.000Z	Exteris	SliMM	Listen has some nice features, for instance last.fm integration, wikipedia
