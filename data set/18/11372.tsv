2006-08-06T12:13:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- dont u lose/damage data with fuse?
2006-08-06T12:15:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	you can still use captive ntfs or fuse
2006-08-06T12:17:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	but ntfs write support is still experimental anyway. Your best bet for stability imvho would be captive
2006-08-06T12:18:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- am i going to lose data?
2006-08-06T12:19:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	it's experimental, nothing is guaranteed
2006-08-06T12:19:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- great, why is it experemental? did they like just come out with ntfs write support and didnt have it before?
2006-08-06T12:21:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	captive was a call wrapper for the ntfs.sys windows driver, which internals are unclear. Native write support is even more unclear because of the closed nature of the ntfs
2006-08-06T12:22:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- Your saying i should go with captive rather than fuse?
2006-08-06T12:26:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	many distributions / how-tos moved to fuse, check http://linux-ntfs.org/ and !fuse
2006-08-06T12:27:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- the reason im mounting ntfs partition with write support is because i got there tons of data. Which i would not like to lose...ill try fuse right now
2006-08-06T12:28:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	theres a risk. If you can't afford losing data you really should enable writing on ntfs at the time
2006-08-06T12:28:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	you really SHOULDN'T
2006-08-06T12:31:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- Yea i guess i shouldnt, how much is the risk?
2006-08-06T12:32:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	As much as i'd like to tell you it works, there is a risk, my ntfs was corrupted once
2006-08-06T12:34:00.000Z	Pulshion	baconbacon	-- yea, then i wont do it, my friend was using gentoo i think and had his drive mounted fine and lost nothing, but he said he mounted with root or something...i have to ask him that
2006-08-07T11:01:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	right-click, properties, open with, select as default or set another
2006-08-07T11:02:00.000Z	baconbacon	Pulshion	woh that was OLD stuff, sorry
