2011-11-13T04:42:00.000Z	bjrohan		How can I tell if Ubuntu is recognizing my swap space?
2011-11-13T04:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	"free" does it show swap?
2011-11-13T04:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	check your fstab
2011-11-13T04:45:00.000Z	bjrohan	zykotick9	- what am I looking for? i have a line commented out that says where it was during installation, but that /dev no longer exists after adjusting partitions
2011-11-13T04:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	the UUID for your swap is probably not correct
2011-11-13T04:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	you can use "sudo blkid" to see what's it really is, then be sure that same UUID is in your fstab
2011-11-13T04:49:00.000Z	bjrohan	zykotick9	There is nothing correct in my fstab for the swap partition, the dev name, nor UUID
2011-11-13T04:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	use one or the other UUID or dev name - not both.  Correct it then.
2011-11-13T04:50:00.000Z	bjrohan	zykotick9	I can enable in gparted, then apply changes correct?
2011-11-13T04:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	ahhh, i'm not touching that one.  good luck.
2011-11-13T04:51:00.000Z	bjrohan	zykotick9	 Actually I enabled on Gparted by right clicking on it then selecting swapon, but it doesn't allow me to apply
2011-11-13T04:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	sorry i can't help further, good luck.
2011-11-13T04:52:00.000Z	bjrohan	zykotick9	my mental issue wit fstab is that the line is commented out and all wrong that is why I am hesitant to manually change it
2012-02-23T09:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	if you are using 12.04 ask in #ubuntu+1 (version isn't supported here)
2012-02-23T09:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	it often is, doesn't change the fact your version issues supported here
2012-02-23T11:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	using samba or nfs
2012-03-27T23:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	re-ask in #ubuntu+1
2012-03-27T23:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	bjrohan	command line application i believe
