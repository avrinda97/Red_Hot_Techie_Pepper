2009-01-22T15:28:00.000Z	Deany		detects it as a camera, which is the problem
2009-01-22T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	what do you want to do with your phone, if its just copying files yu may find its picked up as a usb storage device
2009-01-22T15:29:00.000Z	Deany	ActionParsnip	been here before, it picks it up as a camera nothing else
2009-01-22T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	does it show up as a partition in sudo fdisk -l
2009-01-22T15:30:00.000Z	Deany	ActionParsnip	no..
2009-01-22T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	bah
2009-01-23T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	if its going to be used in windows, ntfs, otherwise, ext2 will do you
2009-01-23T15:48:00.000Z	Deany	ActionParsnip	 well xchat displays everything ive missed while miinimised...i guess to an extent it does
2009-01-23T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	yes the app will still hold the text, but the actual drawing of the window itself to display on the screen
2009-01-23T15:49:00.000Z	Deany	ActionParsnip	not windows no,  and i need speed.. im dis-counting any ext fs...
2009-01-23T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	what size files/
2009-01-23T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	i'd use ext2 personally, saves you ~16Gb for the journal
2009-01-23T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Ubuntu/2008-04/msg03082.html
2009-01-23T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	the speed running down the usb is many times slower than the data speed coming off the drive so I personally cant see much speed increse with usb
2009-01-23T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	the data down usb is slooow, the fs wont hold it up much if at all
2009-01-23T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	usb is burst, firewire is buffered better so is significantly faster
2009-01-23T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Deany	its rated as 480mbps but there is a lot of empty time in the data movements
