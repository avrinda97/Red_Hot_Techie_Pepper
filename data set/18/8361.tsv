2007-12-03T07:12:00.000Z	sexcopter		hi, i have a question. now that we have an actual choice, would you choose using ntfs over fat for a partition to be used by ubuntu and windows, or stick to the good old fat?
2007-12-03T07:13:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	I suggest NTFS... more secure than fat
2007-12-03T07:14:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	you can use ext3(linux files system) with windows using Ext2IFS utility , but it is not working 100%
2007-12-03T07:15:00.000Z	sexcopter	Benalex	I've also heard that that software isn't 100% safe with data
2007-12-03T07:16:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	No it is safe... but sometimes you won't be able to delete some files and have to reboot to linux to delete them , which of course may be forgotten and may get you in trouble ;)
2007-12-03T07:18:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	what size is that fat partition?
2007-12-03T07:18:00.000Z	sexcopter	Benalex	it's currently 40gig, but i might be growing it by 15 or so some time soon
2007-12-03T07:19:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	40gigs partition???
2007-12-03T07:19:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	formated in FAT???... I don't think so
2007-12-03T07:20:00.000Z	sexcopter	Benalex	how come not?
2007-12-03T07:21:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	well I can't recall what max size FAT fs could be... but I doubt it is 40 (forty gigs)
2007-12-03T07:23:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	anyway... since it is 40 gigs, move to NTFS... for more security and better space utilization
2007-12-03T07:24:00.000Z	sexcopter	Benalex	okie doke, i'll see to it
2007-12-03T07:25:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	anytime :)
2007-12-03T07:28:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	it depends on your patience while searching google... my patience led me to Ext2IFS... go ahead and light me :)
2007-12-03T07:29:00.000Z	sexcopter	Benalex	hehe, i'm more inclined to just do the easy thing and use ntfs :s
2007-12-03T07:30:00.000Z	Benalex	sexcopter	before ntfs-3g Fat was prefered... but now you can read/write to NTFS under ubuntu... so why not?
2007-12-03T07:30:00.000Z	sexcopter	Benalex	indeed
