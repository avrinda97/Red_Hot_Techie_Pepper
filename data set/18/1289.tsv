2011-04-07T00:06:00.000Z	rossorosso		Hi guys! I have a Laptop HP6010p with dual batteries but ubunut only uses one of the batteries
2011-04-07T00:06:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	this is a kernel issue, not Ubuntu per se
2011-04-07T00:07:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	I have 2.6.35-28-generic
2011-04-07T00:08:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	maybe, you'll need a custom-built kernel or the controller that manages the switch between the batteries is not supported
2011-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	okay... I have 2 machines and both running ubuntu 10.10 but on the other laptop it works ..I' gonna check what kernel version that computer has
2011-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	please pastebin your lspci
2011-04-07T00:10:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	ok just a sec
2011-04-07T00:11:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	http://paste.ubuntu.com/590415/
2011-04-07T00:19:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	did u read the pastebin of my lspci? =)
2011-04-07T00:19:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	sorry, no not yet, just a sec.
2011-04-07T00:19:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	no panic I can see that u are really busy :)
2011-04-07T00:21:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	I have read it, couldn't find any strange hardware. Intel HW is usually quite well supported on linux.
2011-04-07T00:22:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	I am puzzled to not see any Power Management chip included on your list. No ACPI or something like that.
2011-04-07T00:23:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	the thing is that I have 2 laptops they are almost the same , the only difference is that one is Centrino PRO and the other Centrino vPRO I have ubuntu on both machines.could the battery be broken since it says that energy when full 0 WH?
2011-04-07T00:24:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	is this a multiboot system, or is Ubuntu the only OS installed on your notebook?
2011-04-07T00:24:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	ubuntu is the only OS
2011-04-07T00:26:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	rossorosso	I'd try to find a LiveCD or something like it, that has a test suite for Intel chipsets. You might try Hirens BootDisk if you don't mind to step into a gray area when it comes to legal issues...
2011-04-07T00:27:00.000Z	rossorosso	Stereocaulon	okay I will do that :)
