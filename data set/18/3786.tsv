2009-11-27T03:24:00.000Z	shooree		hey, I would like to install java on karmic. What's the usual way to do it? I bet there's more bother free way than manually downloading and installing
2009-11-27T03:25:00.000Z	brennus	shooree	best way is to go into synaptic, and install the package ubuntu-restricted-extras .
2009-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	I apparently have it installed
2009-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	but when I try to run a java app, it doesn't know what to open i with
2009-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	brennus	shooree	and java is still not installed?
2009-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	java verification on java.com fails also in ffox
2009-11-27T03:28:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	should I try reinstalling the package?
2009-11-27T03:28:00.000Z	brennus	shooree	search synaptic for java
2009-11-27T03:28:00.000Z	shooree		ok
2009-11-27T03:28:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	and then what?
2009-11-27T03:29:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	a bunch of it is already installed, including java-common and other stuff
2009-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	brennus	shooree	well the restricted extras should do it for you. do you have java-common installed?
2009-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	yes I do. I wonder what is wrong
2009-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	I never had any problems with java in jaunty. That's why I'm confus now.
2009-11-27T03:31:00.000Z	brennus	shooree	the best I can suggest is reinstalling. Many people are discovering new problems in Karmic that we're all hoping will be fixed for the LTS release coming up
2009-11-27T03:32:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	very well then. I will try reinstalling the entire restricted extras thing. thanks

2009-11-27T03:34:00.000Z	shooree	brennus	no luck :/ it still opens my java app with gedit. what a shame. I can't believe this.
