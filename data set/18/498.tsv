2012-06-21T02:26:00.000Z	Ririshi		Hi
2012-06-21T02:26:00.000Z	Ririshi		I installed ubuntu from mini. Now how do I start the system,
2012-06-21T02:28:00.000Z	Ririshi		How do I boot my Ubuntu system? I told it to install into the MBR of my primary HDD, but windows just starts.
2012-06-21T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	how many hard disks do you have ?
2012-06-21T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	it's probably gone to the second hard disk
2012-06-21T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	set the bios to boot the second drive, see if it works
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	it sounds as if grub is pointing at the wrong partition then
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	you may have to manually apply/configure grub
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	Ririshi	ikonia	how?
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	ubottu has just sent you a pm with a basic guide
2012-06-21T02:32:00.000Z	Ririshi	ikonia	ok thanks
2012-06-21T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	you'll need to apply thought to match it to how your system is setup
2012-06-21T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	(eg: don't copy and paste - use the commands in relation to your own system setup)
2012-06-21T02:33:00.000Z	Ririshi	ikonia	err I'll try to understand.
2012-06-21T02:46:00.000Z	Ririshi	ikonia	I had Ubutu minimal installed. i got into grub via boot-USB and am now installing lubuntu-desktop (I wanted lubuntu)
2012-06-21T02:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	yeah, you're installing lubuntu
2012-06-21T02:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	so ? I told you to fix grub, not mess with desktops
2012-06-21T02:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Ririshi	I don't know why you are not doing what the guide told you to do, so I'm not interested
