2009-12-19T01:55:00.000Z	gp5st		when i ls a file it exists, but when i run it the response is that the file doesn't exist
2009-12-19T01:55:00.000Z	gp5st		i have 755 on the file, owned by me
2009-12-19T01:56:00.000Z	Jamed	gp5st	i once had the same problem with a little 32bit programm which i tried to run on 64bit computer. maybe that is the problem?
2009-12-19T01:57:00.000Z	gp5st		ortsvo: yeah
2009-12-19T01:57:00.000Z	gp5st		jamed: yeah, that's prob it:(
2009-12-19T01:57:00.000Z	gp5st		i'm trying to install the intel compilers v 11.1
2009-12-19T01:57:00.000Z	gp5st		and this program keeps failing
2009-12-19T01:58:00.000Z	gp5st		but they distribute the ia64 version of this helper program in the intel64 package but they use the 32bit one
2009-12-19T01:58:00.000Z	gp5st		and i just need the frakin' libs
2009-12-19T01:58:00.000Z	gp5st	airtonix	everyone
2009-12-19T01:59:00.000Z	Jamed	gp5st	well, if it really is the problem, you can do nothing but get a 64bit version
2009-12-19T01:59:00.000Z	gp5st	airtonix	read what i wrote you
2009-12-19T01:59:00.000Z	gp5st		jamed: yeah:
2009-12-19T01:59:00.000Z	Jamed	gp5st	or i think there was some lib for 32bit programms in 64bit, never used it though
2009-12-19T02:00:00.000Z	gp5st	airtonix	i was explaining my prolem with the intel compilers hoping someone would have ha the problem and asolution, it wasn't directed at any one person
2009-12-19T02:00:00.000Z	gp5st		jamed: it's just annoying this is all suppose to be supported:-\
2009-12-19T02:00:00.000Z	gp5st		jamed: thanks though
2009-12-19T02:04:00.000Z	Jamed	gp5st	i just looked it up: the package linux32 is for 32bit support, but if you run hardy or newer it is already preinstalled, so if it doesnt work now, you can do nothing
