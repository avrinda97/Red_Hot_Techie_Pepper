2012-03-06T23:22:00.000Z	Broc93		hello everybody!
2012-03-06T23:23:00.000Z	Broc93		I've got a big question: I've tried to install Xubuntu on a PC, but I got an error at the end of the installation, saying that there was a problem with the disc, or sort of. I've changed hard drive and CD drive. Now, after some minutes of installation, I get this screen: http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/8461/06032012261.jpg
2012-03-06T23:23:00.000Z	Broc93		what does it mean? How can I solve this problem?
2012-03-06T23:25:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	theres a key combo to get out of a kernel panic i dont have it memorized though
2012-03-06T23:26:00.000Z	Broc93	celthunder	well, but what does that screen mean?
2012-03-06T23:26:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	that you hit a kernel panic.
2012-03-06T23:26:00.000Z	Broc93	celthunder	an error, so. why does it happen? :D
2012-03-06T23:27:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	it happens when your kernel crashes
2012-03-06T23:28:00.000Z	Broc93	celthunder	ok, but why does it crashes? It's not a disk problem (I've changed it), neither a problem of the CD drive (I've changed it, too)
2012-03-06T23:29:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	says paging issue try a different kernel or now ram
2012-03-06T23:30:00.000Z	Broc93	celthunder	a different kernel: what do you mean?
2012-03-06T23:31:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	i mean go to kertel. org and compile a different kernel or try changing your ram
2012-03-06T23:31:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	kernel.org sorry
2012-03-06T23:31:00.000Z	Broc93	celthunder	but I still haven't installed the operating system...
2012-03-06T23:34:00.000Z	Broc93	celthunder	so, the problem is with the RAM... sob
2012-03-06T23:34:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	not necessarilly and i could be wrong
2012-03-06T23:35:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	im just a noob dont take my guesses as final
2012-03-07T00:05:00.000Z	celthunder	Broc93	any luck with a different kernel
