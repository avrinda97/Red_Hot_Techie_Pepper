2009-12-27T00:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	Have you added any 3rd party sources?
2009-12-27T00:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	Can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list? I can try and help with this.
2009-12-27T00:52:00.000Z	jnyknx	ardchoille	did u get tht?
2009-12-27T00:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	I need the url
2009-12-27T00:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	The reason  you had trouble with winff is because you used sources meant for intrepid on your dapper system. It's not good to mix sources like that
2009-12-27T00:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	You need to stick with dapper sources if you're running a dapper system.
2009-12-27T00:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	I'd recommend disabling the backports sources and do: sudo apt-get update
2009-12-27T00:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	Then see what happens with your install. Don't forget to remove that winff and any other non-dapper sources
2009-12-27T01:04:00.000Z	jnyknx	ardchoille	im still getting 154 pkgs marked for removal
2009-12-27T01:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	jnyknx	Not sure what to do about that. It could be a problem stemming from having intrepid sources.
