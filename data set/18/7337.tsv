2012-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	its possiblebut will break your OS
2012-04-26T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	you can install the beta and upgrade to the release candidate later
2012-08-21T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	no, its in the Gnome based version
2012-08-21T20:09:00.000Z	l_r	ActionParsnip	gnubuntu?
2012-08-21T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	if you dislike Unity, install Xubuntu and it won't be installed and you will get the 2 panel desktop like in gnome2
2012-08-21T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	the release called 'ubuntu' uses the gnome desktop
2012-08-21T20:10:00.000Z	l_r	ActionParsnip	i dont understand. isn't "ubuntu" the default release?
2012-08-21T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	no, there is no 'default release'
2012-08-21T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	its only 'default' if you go to the ubuntu site, if you grab the xubuntu ISO, it is equally as supported as ubuntu.
2012-08-21T20:11:00.000Z	l_r	ActionParsnip	you said "ubuntu" will use the gnome desktop. so what is the name of the release using unity?
2012-08-21T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	ubuntu
2012-08-21T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	it just uses Unity as the default shell in the release
2012-08-21T20:12:00.000Z	l_r	ActionParsnip	ok, so it's the same as 12.04 basically. i am using the gnome-desktop. but i am disappointed it has not been considered adequately
2012-08-21T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	its just a different desktop and window manager, if you don't like Unity, don't use it.
2012-08-21T20:14:00.000Z	l_r	ActionParsnip	i am saying that the when gnome was the default, ubuntu gave it much more consideration
2012-08-21T20:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l_r	they do now as it is still installed when you install ubuntu
