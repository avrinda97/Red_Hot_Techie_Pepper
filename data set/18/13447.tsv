2006-06-19T05:33:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	the restricted formats wiki is much better
2006-06-19T12:24:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	contact the developers and tell them to write cross platform software
2006-06-19T12:24:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	or learn to use Blender
2006-06-19T12:25:00.000Z	KrisWood	polpak	I have a feeling the developers would tell me were I can stick my request, and it wouldn't be pleasant. I can't use blender for what I need to do.
2006-06-19T12:26:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	well then don't buy their software
2006-06-19T12:26:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	there are plenty of cross platform gui libs, and opengl does 3d graphics fine on any OS
2006-06-19T12:27:00.000Z	KrisWood	polpak	I don't buy it, my employer does, I use it because they tell me to.
2006-06-19T12:27:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	well then your employer should also be buying you windows
2006-06-19T12:28:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	it's not magic. They used closed source API's that are only available under 1 OS. We can't magically make everything work w/o any assistance/cooperation from the developers
2006-06-19T12:29:00.000Z	KrisWood	polpak	yes but there is no open source alternative for high end modeling applications, and I'm sick of windows' bullshit
2006-06-19T12:30:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	have you seen/used blender?
2006-06-19T12:31:00.000Z	KrisWood	polpak	I've tried blender, I can't get used to the interface, and my employer uses a proprietary 3dsmax plugin to export to their 3d application
2006-06-19T12:32:00.000Z	polpak	KrisWood	sounds like bad business to so closely couple yourself with one vendor
