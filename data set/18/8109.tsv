2007-10-01T06:34:00.000Z	Hilikus		how do i make windows recognize my linux box as a host in the network so that if i do for example ping ubuntu, "ubuntu" will resolve to the ip of my server?
2007-10-01T06:35:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	That would be something to ask in the ##windows channel
2007-10-01T06:36:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	Stick the name and IP into the /etc/hosts file
2007-10-01T06:36:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	man hosts for the syntax
2008-10-06T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	set $EDITOR = nano
2009-06-29T23:44:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	ssh user@host.com yourcommandgoeshere
2009-06-29T23:45:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	or do you mean on the local system?
2009-06-29T23:45:00.000Z	Hilikus	Pici	that runs it remotely, i mean to start something locally
2009-06-29T23:47:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	You could use nohup ssh user@host &; newcommand
2009-06-29T23:48:00.000Z	Hilikus	Pici	would that let me interact with the ssh process?? thing is i need to enter a passowrd in the ssh process to connect and then once that connection is stablished i need to run a second command which uses the ssh tunnel
2009-06-29T23:49:00.000Z	Hilikus	Pici	but i want to automate it all, except entering the password of course
2009-06-29T23:52:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	Hm... I'm thinking.
2009-06-29T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	Hilikus	I *think* the -f argument will put the ssh process into the background after you enter your password.
2009-06-29T23:54:00.000Z	Hilikus	Pici	thanks, let me try that
2009-06-30T00:16:00.000Z	Hilikus	Pici	it worked! kinda, i had to add a couple of other switches but -f was the main one. thanks a lot

2009-06-30T00:18:00.000Z	Hilikus	Pici	thanks a lot
