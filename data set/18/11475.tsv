2009-09-18T23:02:00.000Z	pete_		does it really matter if I have a seperate /home directory?????
2009-09-18T23:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	depends on what you want to do,  can be useful if  you don't have for example an external hard disk to back stuff up on to
2009-09-18T23:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	or if you don't want to have to move data into another partition,  when you want to sort out a partition set up
2009-09-18T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	I would suggest clean installing  pete_  ,because of the default Ext4 file system :)  and how the  Ext3 to Ext4 conversion may not  be good enough for full Ext4 support
2009-09-18T23:04:00.000Z	pete_	sebsebseb	i am using etx4
2009-09-18T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	ah ok
2009-09-18T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	with Ext4 ok
2009-09-18T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	  set it up so you got Ext4?  nice and fast to boot and that?   if so I guess then it's just upgrade and  things are fine
2009-09-18T23:05:00.000Z	pete_	sebsebseb	yea its real fast, but my home is still on my /
2009-09-18T23:06:00.000Z	pete_	sebsebseb	should i move it?
2009-09-18T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	have you got an external hard disk?
2009-09-18T23:06:00.000Z	pete_	sebsebseb	nah
2009-09-18T23:07:00.000Z	pete_	sebsebseb	do i need one for this, i thought not
2009-09-18T23:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	well  if in the future you have a reason to re install  Ubuntu,   if you have a seperate home things become easier
2009-09-18T23:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	,but if you can back up your stuff else where anyway for example an external hard disk, a seperate Home isn't really needed
2009-09-18T23:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	no
2009-10-05T03:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pete_	sudo passwd username
2009-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	pete_	sebsebseb	nope
