2011-07-01T00:37:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	thats what happens after you burn the image.
2011-07-01T00:38:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	Aha, but that didn't happen with the 11.04. It just an .iso on the cd.
2011-07-01T00:38:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	then you did not burn it as an image
2011-07-01T00:39:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	I thought I just had the options burn iso and burn data and I tried both : ( I guess there was more options...
2011-07-01T00:39:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	install gnomebaker, brasero sucks for this.
2011-07-01T00:40:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	Lol, I saw there was a "burn image option" in the brasero menu. When I used it earlier today i right clicked on the iso an choose open with so I never saw that option. But well thanks anyway.
2011-07-01T00:41:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	I guess you don't know how to unlock bios? I can just start with my hdd and lan.
2011-07-01T00:41:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	now thats a dumb thing to say, of course i know how to do that, but that didn't really seem to be your question.
2011-07-01T00:43:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	I can't change my boot order in the bios menu because it's locked or something. I can't change it anyway.
2011-07-01T00:43:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	I can't even add boot options or anything.
2011-07-01T00:43:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	well you never mentioned that, you only mentioned yuo didn't know how to burn an ISO
2011-07-03T06:52:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	what the.. why on earth would you want to do that?
2011-07-03T06:52:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	Because it sucks.
2011-07-03T06:52:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	No but, to test some things on my site etc : )
2011-07-03T06:52:00.000Z	KM0201	engammalsko	because what sucks?
2011-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	IE6
2011-07-03T06:55:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	Isn't that kind of cheating?
2011-07-03T06:55:00.000Z	engammalsko	KM0201	I was joking haha.
