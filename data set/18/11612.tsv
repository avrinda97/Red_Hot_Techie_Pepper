2008-05-01T17:43:00.000Z	MDCore		is there a way to use the 8.04-alternate iso as a cdrom to upgrade?
2008-05-01T17:45:00.000Z	MDCore		ugh...back
2008-05-01T17:46:00.000Z	MDCore		ok, so does anyone know if I can mount the 8.04-alternate iso to upgrade?
2008-05-01T17:47:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	use the 'mount -o loop file.iso /folder/name
2008-05-01T17:48:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	and then the 'gksu /fodername/cdromupgrade command shoulddo it
2008-05-01T17:48:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	I managed to mount the disc but I wasn't sure where to go from there. Running cdromupgrade didn't work...
2008-05-01T17:49:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	you must run the cdromupgrade command with '/foldername' prefaced
2008-05-01T17:50:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	gksu /fodername/cdromupgrade; the same foldername you used in mount -o loop file.iso /foldername
2008-05-01T17:50:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	I'm su'd into a bash prompt, with the iso mounted on /media/kubuntu-8.04.
2008-05-01T17:50:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	this file is the alternateCD image?
2008-05-01T17:50:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	yep
2008-05-01T17:51:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	what did you do exactly?
2008-05-01T17:51:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	mount -o loop kubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso /media/kubuntu-8.04/  ; /media/kubuntu-8.04/cdromupgrade
2008-05-01T17:52:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	hold up
2008-05-01T17:52:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	ok :)
2008-05-01T17:57:00.000Z	rodolfo	MDCore	after the /filename/cdromupgrade command...what happens next?
2008-05-01T17:57:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	it gets to step two or so like I mentioned, gives an error and rolls back
2008-05-01T17:58:00.000Z	MDCore	rodolfo	ah worked something out. I added deb file:/media/_mounted_iso_path ... to my sources.list. It liekd that
