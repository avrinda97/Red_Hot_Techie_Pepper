2006-10-28T11:14:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117		Okay, what should one do if /usr/bin/dpkg is missing?  Anyone know?
2006-10-28T11:14:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117		(I'm trying to upgrade to edgy...and I got an error for that part.  I went and looked, and it's missing...)
2006-10-28T11:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	uh... will apt-get install dpkg work?
2006-10-28T11:16:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	is says I already have it.  But when upgrading to Edgy, I get the error:  "Errors were encountered while processing:
2006-10-28T11:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	that definitely does not mean /usr/bin/dpkg does not exist! Quite the opposite.
2006-10-28T11:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	that means that dpkg failed when trying to run that package's pre-install scripts.
2006-10-28T11:18:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	- Okay...is there anything you could suggest doing to fix this (or make it so that dpkg doesn't fail =P)?
2006-10-28T11:21:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	- It's hard to tell, as I get all kinds of funky error messeges before the error I just showed.  Should I post them?
2006-10-28T11:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	pastebin the whole thing, please.
2006-10-28T11:21:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	- By pastebin, do you mean post it all here?
2006-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	that's an easy error to fix, but it might lead to problems later on.
2006-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	I point you to this line: dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_1%3a7.1.1ubuntu6_i386.deb (--unpack):
2006-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	- Thanks, I really don't need an image viewer...not right now, anyways.  I'll try what you suggested.
2006-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	uh...I get a bunch of "Depends" messeges when I do what you said to do.  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28790/  -- Is it okay to continue trying to install Edgy?
2006-10-28T11:34:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28791/
2006-10-28T11:36:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	Okay.  *tries*
2006-10-28T12:29:00.000Z	Bobrobyn117	ArrenLex	-- Thanks for the help before.  So far, everything is moving smoothly.  Thanks so much, I would NEVER have been able to figure it out on my own =P
2006-10-28T12:29:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Bobrobyn117	no problem! Just watch carefully for error messages :)
