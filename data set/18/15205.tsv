2007-04-27T05:51:00.000Z	nickrud	|thunder	wrong guy, and I won't spend time looking for some guy named JRE on the kernel mail list :P
2007-07-15T16:25:00.000Z	nickrud	|thunder	those are used by the add/remove under applications
2007-07-15T16:26:00.000Z	nickrud	|thunder	yeah, a bunch of icons you can scavenge for other things ;)
2007-09-07T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	|thunder	no; but you can make the panels minimize
2007-09-07T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	|thunder	so you can see them? ;)
2007-09-07T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	|thunder	try running xp in vmware-server you can make it truly full screen. But getting above the panels; maybe using brightside or devilspie. Those are the only two things I can think of offhand that might allow that
