2005-09-18T13:49:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-09-18T13:50:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	thanks!
2005-09-18T13:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	oh, then try xserver-xfree86
2005-09-18T13:57:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	I went through the instructions. Do I need to reload a service or sumthin?
2005-09-18T13:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	did u add a higher resolution?
2005-09-18T13:58:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	Yes, I've added 1024x768 and took out the ones I don't use.
2005-09-18T13:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	just restart X
2005-09-18T13:59:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	Awesome. Thanks again bro
2005-09-18T15:16:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	I think I broke my X11
2005-09-18T15:16:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	hmmm, u do have terminal access right?
2005-09-18T15:18:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	Yes I do. Here's what happened, I restarted x, and when it came to loading the display driver (S3 ProSavage8), startx returned (EE) No devices detected.
2005-09-18T15:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	your xorg config should have been backed up, just move the current xorg.conf to somewhere, and mv the older xorg.conf.mmddyy to xorg.conf
2005-09-18T15:19:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	i don't have xorg..i don't think Warty has that yet
2005-09-18T15:20:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	oops, it subsitite xorg with xfree86
2005-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	trigger_ph	robotgeek	can you run me through that command we used a while ago?
2005-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	robotgeek	trigger_ph	okay...
