2011-08-20T21:07:00.000Z	tim167		help, ubuntu not booting, fsck gives "input/output error", what do i do?
2011-08-20T21:09:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	  you installed with live cd ...yes?
2011-08-20T21:09:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	 did you check the md5sums of the iso image before burning it?
2011-08-20T21:09:00.000Z	tim167		coz the CD is working, the booting from /dev/sda1 does not
2011-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	tim167	coz_	the CD is working, the booting from /dev/sda1 does not
2011-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	 I aks if you checked the md5sum because it could have been corrunpted during download,, torrents generally have extra checks so less likely to be corrupt
2011-08-20T21:11:00.000Z	tim167		i also have this: /dev/sda1 partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary
2011-08-20T21:11:00.000Z	tim167	coz_	the problem is not the CD
2011-08-20T21:11:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	 ooo  I see,, and is this a dual boot?
2011-08-20T21:11:00.000Z	tim167	coz_	no
2011-08-20T21:11:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	 how large of a drive is it
2011-08-20T21:12:00.000Z	tim167	coz_	350GB
2011-08-20T21:12:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	yikes... when something like this happens I generally use D-Ban to write zeros to the drive then install,, however on that size drive it may take more than 8 or 9 hours to complete
2011-08-20T21:13:00.000Z	tim167	coz_	the thing is that this is an already installed ubuntu, which does no longer boot now, it did boot before
2011-08-20T21:13:00.000Z	tim167	coz_	it was a working system, now it drops to "busy box" when booting, right after the GRUB menu
2011-08-20T21:14:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	 ah  when it drops to busybox,, after about 5 seconds,, type    exit,,, see if it boots to desktop
2011-08-20T21:14:00.000Z	tim167		fsck /dev/sda1 gives "input/output error" and stops
2011-08-20T21:14:00.000Z	coz_	tim167	 for that error however, I cant think of anything offhand that could remedy it,,
