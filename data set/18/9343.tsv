2007-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	Your answer is insufficient. I do know what a terminal is.
2007-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	magnetron	bullgard4	it means open a terminal
2007-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	Thank you.
2007-05-12T05:48:00.000Z	magnetron	bullgard4	you want longer battery time? try installing the powernowd package. if that doesn't help, just uninstall it
2007-05-12T05:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	I would rather like to get a thorough understanding about the software providing a longer battery life in an Ubuntu laptop computer.
2007-07-17T09:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	As far as I know this is not possible. Please use Irssi.
2008-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	magnetron	bullgard4	what does System > administration > language support yield?
2008-05-26T13:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	Language Support > Supported Languages > Language German support asserted. No more assertions. -- Default language for new useraccounts and the login screen: 'Deutsch (Deutschland)'.
2008-05-26T13:26:00.000Z	magnetron	bullgard4	if you hit the "apply" button, does it wanna install complementary language support?
2008-05-26T13:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	At the moment 'Apply' is greyed out. So pressing it does not effect anything.
2008-05-26T13:28:00.000Z	magnetron	bullgard4	ok
2008-10-16T00:05:00.000Z	magnetron	bullgard4	maybe ffmpeg, i'm not sure. i'm sure ffmpeg supports the flv format
2008-10-16T00:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	Thank you.
2008-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	Ah! That was too simple. :-)
2008-12-14T17:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	magnetron	Ok. Thank you.
