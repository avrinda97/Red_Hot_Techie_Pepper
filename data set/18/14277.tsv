2006-03-26T17:03:00.000Z	gary		I started a new job today, and I'm installing ubuntu on it. Never usd it before, used debian as server and client forr about a year though.  Just want to make sure I have everything I need

2006-03-26T17:04:00.000Z	gary		ok then, one more question about shared drives
2006-03-26T17:04:00.000Z	gary		the company has a shared drive on a SUSE machine running samba.  Completely accessible from Linux.  This doesn't mean I need samba though does it?  I just need to mount the location - right?
2006-03-26T17:05:00.000Z	bimberi	gary	yes, no only need the samba client to mount shares/query ubotu
