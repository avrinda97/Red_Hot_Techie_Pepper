2012-03-08T01:07:00.000Z	subh		 hi all, i want to disable my ARP module for some experiment so how can i do this.
2012-03-08T01:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	I did an lsmod | grep arp  and I don't see it on my system, I'm not sure what or where your ARP module is
2012-03-08T01:09:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: i want to disable address resolution protocol in my linux box but i dont know how to do this
2012-03-08T01:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	arp is very low in ethernet I'm not sure you can go much lower everything seems to link into the mac address that I think is part of arp
2012-03-08T01:12:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: how to disable all the process related to arp. I want to use my program in replacement of arp
2012-03-08T01:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	I guess it would be the lowist driver for your nic you want to play with
2012-03-08T01:14:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: i got some modification in sysctl.cfg to disable ARP. but how to load file .
2012-03-08T01:15:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: how the .cfg file come to affect ARP
2012-03-08T01:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	I guess with this sysctl [-n] [-e] -p <filename>    (default /etc/sysctl.conf)
2012-03-08T01:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	QA: but I assume this is some learning exersize
2012-03-08T01:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	 that's like saying if I change my program how will it effect the operation of my program.  that would depend on what was in the file
2012-03-08T01:26:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: means do i need to restart my pc or there is some alternative thing to read that cfg file
2012-03-08T01:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	sorry I thought I gave you the command already http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl8_sysctl.htm  but some value that chane in sysctl require reboot,  not sure if your do or not
2012-03-08T01:29:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: thanks
2012-03-08T01:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	but your link also showed you another method echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/arp_ignore
2012-03-08T01:30:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	:  but that need restart, correct.
2012-03-08T01:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	subh	don't you read your own links Note that the arp_announce/arp_ignore sysctls must be setup correctly, before the VIP address is brought up at a logical interface at real servers.
2012-03-08T01:32:00.000Z	subh	sacarlson	: ok i will read it :) thanks alot
