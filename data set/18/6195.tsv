2009-11-04T11:12:00.000Z	SeaPhor	philh	cdw32 what if you let the vid play till the buffer is finished, then go to the /tmp dir and copy the vid- rename it- to home dir,, and watch via vlc?
2009-11-04T11:13:00.000Z	philh	SeaPhor	anything streamed with rtmp doesn't get cached this way, it's ok for youtube but not iplayer or similar
2009-11-04T11:17:00.000Z	philh	SeaPhor	which flash version are you using?
2009-11-04T11:19:00.000Z	philh	SeaPhor	heh, fair enough
2009-11-04T11:22:00.000Z	philh	SeaPhor	feel free to volunteer some possibilities that spring to mind
2009-11-04T11:28:00.000Z	philh	SeaPhor	don't get so bloody protective, it's just a distro
