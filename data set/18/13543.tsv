2005-11-06T06:53:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	I'll have to install it by hand.. alternativly you'll have to try bittornado... but I feel your pain azureus is a worhy java-app
2005-11-06T06:54:00.000Z	tomaj	madmike	nothing beats azureus :)
2005-11-06T06:54:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	full ack..
2005-11-06T06:57:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	if you are using the default ubuntu jre, yes
2005-11-06T06:57:00.000Z	tomaj	madmike	i was using the sun jre
2005-11-06T06:58:00.000Z	tomaj	madmike	what does that mean?
2005-11-06T06:59:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	sudo update-alternatives --config java
2005-11-06T06:59:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	this will let you select the jre to use
2005-11-06T06:59:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	if you don't it will alwys use the java-gcj even when the sun-jre is installed
2005-11-06T07:00:00.000Z	tomaj	madmike	and EloraHRanma but bob2 is saying that the ubuntu jre and the sun jre are the same
2005-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	madmike	tomaj	i disagree... but it really doesn't matter, use the one that better serves your need
