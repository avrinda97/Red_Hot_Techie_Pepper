2011-04-19T00:31:00.000Z	Draco_		hi again, I'll try to ask: I installed Ubuntu 10.10 on my HD, resizing an existing partition to create the space for it, now that partition I resized can't be read anymore, at least under windows, this is my situation http://www.webalice.it/asimov12/images/Immagine.JPG, (I:\) is the one that can't be read, ubuntu is right after that, ubuntu itself doesn't run because the installer but the bootloader on the wrong HD, my priority now is
2011-04-19T00:32:00.000Z	KM0201	Draco_	Windows cannot natively read Linux filesystems... thats why you can't see it under windows
2011-04-19T00:32:00.000Z	Draco_	KM0201	no, the NTFS partition that I resized to accomodate the ext4 can't be read
2011-04-19T00:33:00.000Z	KM0201		whats the filesystem on it?
2011-04-19T00:33:00.000Z	KM0201	Draco_	wait, are you trying to use Wubi?
2011-04-19T00:33:00.000Z	KM0201		"ubuntu.exe'
2011-04-19T00:33:00.000Z	KM0201		?
2011-04-19T00:33:00.000Z	Draco_	KM0201	I don't even know what that is
2011-04-19T00:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Draco_	are you inserting the cd, and clicking Install, and it goes through the whole process under Windows?
2011-04-19T00:35:00.000Z	Draco_	KM0201	no no no, you got this all wrong, Ubuntu installed itself fine, I didn't even try to run it yet but at this point I don't care, I need to recover my date from the ntfs partition ( I:\ , on that image )
2011-04-19T00:35:00.000Z	Draco_		data*
2011-04-19T00:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Draco_	ok.. i don't know on that.. thats really a windows question, not a linux question.
2011-04-19T00:36:00.000Z	Draco_	KM0201	well since ubuntu made the mess, I tought you might know what caused it
2011-04-19T00:36:00.000Z	Draco_		Recuva you say? I'll look into it
2011-04-19T00:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Draco_	i'd suggest ubuntu didn't make the mess.... but thats another issue.
2011-04-19T00:38:00.000Z	Draco_	KM0201	yes it did, by my hands of course, but still ...
2011-04-19T00:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Draco_	the second part of your statement, explains it perfect.. "by my hands"... thats the only reason that happened....
2011-04-19T00:45:00.000Z	Draco_	KM0201	it's just a matter of "points of view", anyway I'm just trying to solve the problem here,  forgive me but I'm a bit frustrated atm
