2006-01-09T13:54:00.000Z	site		extension of installer is .sh
2006-01-09T13:54:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 then you type sh then the name.sh
2006-01-09T13:57:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 try #vmware
2006-01-09T13:59:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 never installed it in linux so cannot help at all otherwise ;)
2006-01-09T16:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-01-09T16:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 you installing from apt/synaptic? or compiling source yourself?
2006-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	site	aftertaf	i know how synaptic works
2006-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 just asking..... your errors sounded like compilation woes, not package parties :)
2006-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	site	aftertaf	yes amsn needs to be compiled first
2006-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 are you installing amsn from synaptic? or from a tarball?
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	site	aftertaf	, do u know what to do now?
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 as you didnt answer my question, no...
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	site	aftertaf	 i say tar..
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 oki... any reason why not the synaptic package??
2006-01-09T16:36:00.000Z	aftertaf	site	 it *would* be easier to use the package, as and when it updates you dont have to go through all this again.... but otherwise, you need tcl8.4-dev as crimsun pointed out to Badm4n instead (lol)
