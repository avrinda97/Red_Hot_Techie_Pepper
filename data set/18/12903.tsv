2006-03-01T13:47:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	np
2006-05-05T06:19:00.000Z	_jason	cradek	mplayer is in multiverse
2006-05-05T06:19:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	no it's not, not anymore
2006-05-05T06:20:00.000Z	_jason	cradek	still there
2006-05-05T06:20:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	what am I doing wrong then?
2006-05-05T06:20:00.000Z	_jason	cradek	can you put your /etc/apt/sources.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and give us a link please?
2006-05-05T06:22:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13099
2006-05-05T06:23:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	I'm an idiot, sorry, forget it
2006-05-05T06:23:00.000Z	_jason	cradek	you see you only have backports multiverse right? np :P
2006-05-05T06:23:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	I could have sworn on my other machine I only had to uncomment things, but on this one I had to add the multiverse lines
2006-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	but obviously I must remember wrong
2006-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	_jason	cradek	since breezy it's been like that.  That's a common problem here actually, people just uncomment
2006-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	_jason	cradek	(it may have been like that before too but I don't recall)
2006-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	cradek	_jason	it's embarassing, I'm not a newbie :-)
