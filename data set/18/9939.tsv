2007-01-31T09:12:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	jsut say what's wrong and someone might anwser you if they know the answer
2007-01-31T09:14:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	ok your root (hdx,y) is wrong you have to boot to live cd mount your linux filesystem and edit /boot/grub/menu.lst so it's correct
2007-01-31T09:15:00.000Z	LakeTown	kitche	so you want me to boot the live cd, go to the terminal and mount the partition that is called "/"?
2007-01-31T09:16:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	yeah
2007-01-31T09:17:00.000Z	LakeTown	kitche	writnig that down, and afterwards edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and what should I check in it?
2007-01-31T09:17:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	root (hdx,y) the x and y should eb numbers
2007-01-31T09:17:00.000Z	LakeTown	kitche	(is the commande to edit a file "sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"?
2007-01-31T09:18:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	yes if you want to use gedit
2007-01-31T09:18:00.000Z	LakeTown	kitche	lastly, what are "eb" numbers?
2007-01-31T09:18:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	eb=be fast type hit keys in wrong order
2007-01-31T09:20:00.000Z	LakeTown	kitche	Just realised, sorry. The "/" parti is sda7 on my pc. Swap is sda6. What should I simply be sure that melu.lst has a line that says "root (sda6,0) or something?
2007-01-31T09:21:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	root should be sd6,0 but some sata can work with hd6,0
2007-01-31T09:21:00.000Z	LakeTown	kitche	ok cool, I'll give it a try and then come back to annoy you with my results :) thanks for your time!
2007-01-31T09:59:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	hmm so when you looked at /dev/sda7 and mounted it boot/grub/menu.lst is empty
2007-01-31T10:03:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	go into the directory that you mounted your /
2007-01-31T10:06:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	did you go into the directory that you mounted /
2007-01-31T10:07:00.000Z	kitche	LakeTown	go into that directory where yo umounted /dev/sda8
