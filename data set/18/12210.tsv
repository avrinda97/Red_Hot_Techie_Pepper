2006-10-16T11:39:00.000Z	t0mazrage		im looking for help, i want to install obuntu in my pc...but i have some questions...
2006-10-16T11:40:00.000Z	t0mazrage		can i install HP 1510 All in ONE?
2006-10-16T11:40:00.000Z	t0mazrage		my RADEON 9250 AGP card its compatible?
2006-10-16T11:40:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	yes. eeeeasily.
2006-10-16T11:42:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	believe me, this is much different.
2006-10-16T11:42:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	I think it's the best option.
2006-10-16T11:43:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	that's surprising, though, given that... well, there are a lot of low-income areas.
2006-10-16T11:46:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	does one computer have a wired connection?
2006-10-16T11:47:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	you'll be fine with the wired one
2006-10-16T11:48:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	for the other computer, you'll have to install some more apps
2006-10-16T11:49:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	probably. have faith :)
2006-10-16T11:49:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	will you be dual-booting the PC(s)?
2006-10-16T11:50:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	oh, well... maybe you should do this computer first, and then we'll work on the second computer.
2006-10-16T11:51:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	maybe even wait for Edgy, on the other computer? it will only be another week or so
2006-10-16T12:06:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	is english your second language, by the way?
2006-10-16T12:06:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	no, because your English is awesome
2006-10-16T12:10:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	t0mazrage	maybe in a week or two you'll be helping people in the Spanish ubuntu channel
