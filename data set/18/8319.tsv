2007-09-07T09:58:00.000Z	private_guy		Well I dont know exactly, how do I find the model?
2007-09-07T09:58:00.000Z	private_guy		I opened my motherboard but couldn't find anything :(
2007-09-07T09:59:00.000Z	Vlet	private_guy	open a terminal and type: lspci > ~/Desktop/results.txt
2007-09-07T09:59:00.000Z	Vlet	private_guy	and then paste the contents of the results.txt file to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-09-07T10:06:00.000Z	Vlet	private_guy	it looks like that card uses the broadcom chipset, which may require you installing ndiswrapper... see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-09-07T10:07:00.000Z	private_guy	Vlet	Thanks, I will check that out :)
2007-09-07T10:08:00.000Z	Vlet	private_guy	this also looks relevant: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=42697
2007-09-07T10:08:00.000Z	private_guy	Vlet	Thanks again :)
2007-09-07T10:09:00.000Z	Vlet	private_guy	one more suggestion, search ubuntuforums for 'F5D7001' :)
2007-09-07T11:05:00.000Z	Vlet	private_guy	It seems no one knows how to help you at this time. You might be better off starting to search ubuntuforums
