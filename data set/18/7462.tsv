2008-01-05T11:44:00.000Z	ollle		i did it! i found the cause of the bug in Save (Save As) dialogs that erased the user-written file name on folder change!
2008-01-05T11:45:00.000Z	ollle		one of the two blocking bugs in gtk+
2008-01-05T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	ollle	you mean the fix?
2008-01-05T11:46:00.000Z	ollle	nickrud	no fix yet, i have to come back to my usual computer and modify gtk and test-link
2008-01-05T11:46:00.000Z	ollle		i just know what the problem is
2008-01-05T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	ollle	if you've found the cause, the fix can't be far behind. I've always hated that, so I'll say thanks in advance
2008-01-05T11:47:00.000Z	ollle		no problem! i enjoyed this little hacking
2008-01-05T11:47:00.000Z	ollle		nikrud: by the way, there seems to be more that one related problem. i fixed the only bug that i could reproduce with feisty
2008-01-05T11:48:00.000Z	ollle		*nickrud
2008-01-05T11:48:00.000Z	nickrud	ollle	hrm. I'm on gutsy so I think you need to work harder for me ;P
2008-01-05T11:49:00.000Z	ollle		but once a fix is contributed it will appear in gutsy as well of course
2008-01-05T11:49:00.000Z	ollle		gutsy is 7.10 , right?
2008-01-05T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud		yes
2008-01-05T11:50:00.000Z	ollle		actually, im astonished a real gtk+ coder didnt find it before me
2008-01-05T11:50:00.000Z	ollle		the problem is just what i expected it to be :/
2008-01-05T11:51:00.000Z	ollle		you want me explain the bug?   :p dont think so, right?
2008-01-05T11:51:00.000Z	ollle		if you are interested : http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419737
2008-01-05T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	ollle	not really :) I pretty much quit programming in the late 80's , never really learned event driven stuff
