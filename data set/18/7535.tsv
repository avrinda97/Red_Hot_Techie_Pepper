2008-02-09T22:13:00.000Z	TheK		hello. I messed up my configuration. I need to be able to make opengl programs but although I'm running Xgl and can use desktop effects (nvidia driver installed) I fail to create a 'direct rendering context'. This happened after an upgrade to gutsy from feisty. Could anyone direct me to the appropriate docs?
2008-02-09T22:14:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	which nvidia card, many don't need Xgl (which is the cause of your direct rendering problem)
2008-02-09T22:15:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	I don't think I used Xgl in feisty. I spent a few hours configuring it but I don't remember how anymore. I'm on a dell precision (m90)
2008-02-09T22:16:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	How can I revert to nvidia-only setup?
2008-02-09T22:16:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	  lspci | grep -i vga  will tell you the card to start with
2008-02-09T22:17:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G71 [Quadro FX 1500M] (rev a1)
2008-02-09T22:17:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	iirc you had to create a special gdm session to run xgl; don't run that special session should be enough
2008-02-09T22:18:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	I see. I think I choose between GNOME and xgl.
2008-02-09T22:18:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	You say that using GNOME would fix my problem?
2008-02-09T22:19:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	it should set you up with a normal 3d accel, yes. And compiz should work without xgl for you now
2008-02-09T22:20:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	Funny if it would be that simple. I've spent several hours pulling different libs. Many thanks! (restarting X)
2008-02-09T22:24:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	No luck. Still running Xgl.
2008-02-09T22:27:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	sudo apt-get remove xserver-xgl , the xgl option on gdm probably will stop working completely.
2008-02-09T22:28:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	Seems dangerous ;)
2008-02-09T22:31:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	not really, you'll fall back to normal X in gnome. If all else fails, ctl-alt-f2 , log in and sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl ;)
2008-02-09T22:31:00.000Z	nickrud	TheK	clt-alt-f7 to get back to the gui login
2008-02-09T22:31:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	ok, I'll give it a shot. But does this mean that Xgl doesn't have an opengl api at all?
2008-02-09T22:45:00.000Z	TheK	nickrud	I got my gl context back! You are the hero of the day.
