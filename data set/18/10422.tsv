2006-12-03T13:48:00.000Z	ServerCrash		i might sound crazy, but can anyone tell me what difference does distro make, like why fedora or why ubuntu or for that matter suse when almost all of them are same linux
2006-12-03T13:48:00.000Z	ServerCrash		you get almost all the same stuff
2006-12-03T13:50:00.000Z	ServerCrash		i have been using redhat/ fedora from long time but had heard a lot about ubuntu so wondering should i switch and if yes than what differece would i get in ubuntu
2006-12-03T13:50:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	things like proprietary stuff, ease of use,hardware support, plug and play , as well
2006-12-03T13:51:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	Subhuman, the kernel can be compiled with as many or as few options as you'd like so there exists a difference there as well
2006-12-03T13:55:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	theres nothing wrong with sticking with that you know
2006-12-03T13:55:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	sometimes distros work better for some systems than others, but if you use ubuntu then you get its advantages and vision
2006-12-03T13:56:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	if you want kde you run kubuntu
2006-12-03T13:56:00.000Z	ServerCrash	nothlit	"advantages and vision" can you throw some light
2006-12-03T13:57:00.000Z	ServerCrash	nothlit	ubuntu doest have kde during installation
2006-12-03T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	using gnome in ubuntu will definitely be more advantageous compared to kde because its the original and most common installation
2006-12-03T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	theres kubuntu
2006-12-03T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	kubuntu.org
2006-12-03T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	also xubuntu
2006-12-03T13:58:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	theres a lot of gnome innovation ubuntu uses like gnome-app-install its a program that works like add/remove in windows, but you can actually add things and its very user friendly
2006-12-03T13:58:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	and you get a huge library of packages
2006-12-03T13:59:00.000Z	nothlit	ServerCrash	but things like codecs especially things like windows codecs and things like skype will take more work
2006-12-03T13:59:00.000Z	ServerCrash	nothlit	thanks...time for gdm restart ... testing xgl :D brb
