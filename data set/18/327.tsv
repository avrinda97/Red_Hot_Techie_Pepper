2012-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	XiRoN		Hey guys I have an SSH server and an FTP server
2012-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	what do you need help with?
2012-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	XiRoN		I want to transfer, files from my FTP server to my SSH server, is there ay way of doing it without downloading the files to my computer first?
2012-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	I assume you can log on to your FTP server?
2012-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	XiRoN	cprofitt	Yes.
2012-06-06T05:35:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	you should be able to use this document to complete your task
2012-06-06T05:35:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/TransferFiles
2012-06-06T05:36:00.000Z	XiRoN		Thanks bob
2012-06-06T05:36:00.000Z	XiRoN	cprofitt	Limitation: You can't move files between two remote computers. Either the source or destination must be a local file. However, if you log in to a remote machine with ssh, you can copy files between two remote machines on that machine's command-line.
2012-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	once you are logged in to your FTP server you should be able to initiate the scp transfer from it
2012-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	exactly
2012-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	you can also do entire folders
2012-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	scp -r (recursive) username@server:(remote location) (local location)
2012-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	XiRoN	cprofitt	I'm using a GUI :(
2012-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	do you have a GUI on your FTP server?
2012-06-06T05:39:00.000Z	XiRoN	cprofitt	No
2012-06-06T05:39:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	I would use the command line then
2012-06-06T05:39:00.000Z	cprofitt	XiRoN	unless your GUI will give you a command line
