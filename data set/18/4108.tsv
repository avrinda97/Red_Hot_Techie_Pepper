2009-06-05T08:38:00.000Z	sam_		Hi,all,  I have 2 programs need to auto-start, I place them into /etc/rc.local, but one can start, and another failed to start. They both can start by hand when I call "/etc/rc.local" on command.
2009-06-05T08:38:00.000Z	sam_		Now, I find the difference, But I dont know why?
2009-06-05T08:39:00.000Z	sam_		My program is a socket server, it can auto-start in /etc/rc.local on my PC, but it cannot auto-start on my VMware.
2009-06-05T08:39:00.000Z	sam_		My OS is both ubuntu-9.04 on my PC and VMware.
2009-06-05T08:40:00.000Z	cabrey	sam_	what are the commands?
2009-06-05T08:40:00.000Z	sam_		the command is : supernode -l 1234 &
2009-06-05T08:41:00.000Z	sam_	cabrey	when I disgard the '&', it can auto-start.
2009-06-05T08:41:00.000Z	sam_		but On my pc, I can auto-start with '&' and without '&'
2009-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	cabrey	sam_	you shouldn't need the & in rc.local
2009-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	sam_		yes, I said I found this difference.
2009-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	sam_		But why on My PC it can start with '&'
2009-06-05T08:43:00.000Z	cabrey	sam_	so does that mean it works or not?
2009-06-05T08:44:00.000Z	sam_		I can work with '&' and without '&' on my PC; but it cannot works with '&' on my VMware.
2009-06-05T08:44:00.000Z	sam_		my os are both ubuntu-9.04
2009-06-05T08:45:00.000Z	cabrey	sam_	I'm confused, I thought we were just working with one OS (and rc.local)
2009-06-05T08:46:00.000Z	sam_	cabrey	another difference is about the OS installation mode, my PC is installed over network. but the VMware is installed by ubtuntu.iso image file.
2009-06-05T08:47:00.000Z	sam_		the deference is about the accounts priviledge.
2009-06-05T08:47:00.000Z	cabrey	sam_	I'm not entirely sure I know what you mean, but I have to go :( sorry
