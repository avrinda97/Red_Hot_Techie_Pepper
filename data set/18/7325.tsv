2012-11-27T19:47:00.000Z	hondusa		ubuntu will not recognize my password - "cryptsetup failed, bad password or options" - i installed ubuntu on a sony vaio and everything worked yesterday - how can i fix this?
2012-11-27T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	is that your login password?
2012-11-27T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	hold shift at boot, select recovery mode, select root and you can run:  passwd foo      change foo for your username then run: reboot
2012-11-27T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	any, it doesn't matter
2012-11-27T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	if the pasword reset doesn't fly in root recovery then it must be some other pass
2012-11-27T20:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	then you have set a root password
2012-11-27T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	in ubuntu that drops straight to the prompt so you can run commands
2012-11-27T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	you have set it yourself
2012-11-27T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	why did you set the root password
2012-11-27T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	ubuntu defaults to leaving it alone
2012-11-27T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	you have full system access using sudo, so why set the root password?
2012-11-27T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	did you use encryptfs?
2012-11-27T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	so you can see my text. Why did you set a root password at all?
2012-11-27T20:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	you will need to boot to liveCD, mount adnd decrypt the data then get the data off. LOts of messing around. WHy do you not have a decent backup?
2012-11-27T20:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	yes
2012-11-27T20:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	I suggest you review your backup strategy. It's clearly not suitable
2012-11-27T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	i don't use encryptfs, its too much of a headache. There are guides online galore, maybe someone can help you
2012-11-27T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hondusa	in future I recommend you don't use encryptfs. Its a lot easier
