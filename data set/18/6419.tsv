2008-05-17T22:11:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	do you know how to reconfigure xorg in hardy?  i think dpkg-reconfigure command doesnt do what it should for x in hardy
2008-05-17T22:11:00.000Z	darthanubis	alapidas	thats usually the way, or xconfig
2008-05-17T22:14:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	the dpkg command only asks about keyboard and mouse information
2008-05-17T22:14:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	i think it is a known issue with hardy
2008-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	so any other ideas on how to fix this?
2008-05-17T22:16:00.000Z	darthanubis	alapidas	what kind of video cards?
2008-05-17T22:16:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	geforce 7300
2008-05-17T22:17:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	working beautifully before the xorg upgrade
2008-05-17T22:17:00.000Z	darthanubis	alapidas	run xconfig-nvidia or something like that

2008-05-17T22:17:00.000Z	alapidas	darthanubis	doing that makes a new xorg but it still does nto work
