2007-10-16T09:54:00.000Z	L0GAN	Paddy_EIRE	: show me what DVD allows copying?
2007-10-16T09:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	L0GAN	copying and backing up are 2 completely different things
2007-10-16T09:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	L0GAN	I buy mine but I always back them up
2007-10-16T09:57:00.000Z	L0GAN	Paddy_EIRE	: then you dont have many :P.  Well I also see the player only allows unencrypted DVD's. Would need to download additional libs it seems
