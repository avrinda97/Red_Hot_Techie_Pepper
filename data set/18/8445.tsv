2007-08-18T12:24:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	so you're using ftp instead of sftp because?
2007-08-18T12:24:00.000Z	gikid	olyuser	what?
2007-08-18T12:25:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	your choice to use ftp instead of sftp, because you want untrusted users to be able to upload files to the website?
2007-08-18T12:25:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	you could create a  user that only has permissions to the website dir, or you could make a chroot jail for sftp...
2007-08-18T12:25:00.000Z	gikid	olyuser	i'm still not understanding you....

2007-08-18T12:28:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	then use ssh.  sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2007-08-18T12:28:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	then to connect, you can use sftp, on windows, putty...
2007-08-18T12:28:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	ftp is deprecated
2007-08-18T12:29:00.000Z	olyuser	gikid	and if you need to connect to your linux box running ssh from a mac, use Fugu
