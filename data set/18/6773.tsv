2008-08-02T07:14:00.000Z	amenado		hkittysmoothie-> then perhaps thats not the executable  for soffice 3 ?
2008-08-02T07:15:00.000Z	amenado		hkittysmoothie-> check the file itself,  is it really there?
2008-08-02T07:16:00.000Z	amenado		hkittysmoothie-> and you are sure it has a 744 as minimum perms?
2008-08-02T07:17:00.000Z	amenado		hkittysmoothie-> do an ls -la  of that file and see if it has  rwxr--r-- as permissions
2008-08-02T07:18:00.000Z	amenado		hkittysmoothie-> well what is its permission, paste it here..
2008-08-02T07:19:00.000Z	amenado		sunny-> if it was me, id restart the network, and if it still dont work try a reboot
2008-08-02T07:19:00.000Z	amenado		hkittysmoothie-> try this  strace  /path/to/soffice
2008-08-02T07:20:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	i have done all of that but no fix.... did a reboot, did stop and start but nothing changed
2008-08-02T07:22:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	i am using madwifi-tools
2008-08-02T07:24:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	is there a way to get the name of the driver being used for my wireless Athros
2008-08-02T07:36:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	could ath_pci be a name of the driver? that is all i can see as far as driver name when running lshw -C network
2008-08-02T07:40:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	ok lsmod |grep  ath_pci has the following output: ath_pci               101024  0 AND wlan                  207728  5 wlan_wep,wlan_scan_sta,ath_rate_sample,ath_pci AND ath_hal               192592  3 ath_rate_sample,ath_pci ..................... now could this give you an idea why am i having trouble seeing packets in monitor mode running wireshark and airodump????
2008-08-02T07:46:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	infact, wireshark shows a blank screen when my wireless is put on monitor mode
2008-08-02T07:50:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	i will try to see what i can do with that encryption thing... although it was working so normal just this afternoon... and i powered off the pc for a few hours and not worked since
2008-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	no there are about 50 AP around this area in the city.. i don't see any of them when in moitor mode
2008-08-02T07:54:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	yes, iwlist aht0 scan do show it all... but that is in managed mode.... the problem is in monitor mode when its not showing or detecting any AP around.
2008-08-02T07:57:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	example:  sudo airmon-ng start ath0  and then sudo airodump-ng ath0 should at least show something right? it did this afternoon.. now it's not...
2008-08-02T08:02:00.000Z	sunny	amenado	is there a way to unload and reload driver for my Atheros wireless maybe that could fix it...
