2007-01-07T09:29:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		are you wired or wireless?
2007-01-07T09:30:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		and you can't see your router?
2007-01-07T09:30:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		but you're online?
2007-01-07T09:31:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		so your wireless card, then
2007-01-07T09:31:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		edit your /etc/iftab
2007-01-07T09:32:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		you'll probably see an extra ethernet card
2007-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		he said he didn't
2007-01-07T09:34:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		i do, n30n
2007-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	n30n	kiwinz_sucks	well i clicked and disabled networking, then when i reenabled it the section for enabling and disabling wireless networking disappear
2007-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		i've seen that before
2007-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		it usually comes back up in my experience, though
2007-01-07T09:36:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		last time i saw it, the card he was using was going bad
2007-01-07T09:36:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		i don't think it's an applicatin problem, i think it's hardware
2007-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	n30n	kiwinz_sucks	i still connect wirelessly, i just cant see wireless networks under the network-manager drop list
2007-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks	n30n	i'm clueless then
2007-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		are you using kde or gnome
2007-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	n30n	kiwinz_sucks	I guess its just goo it still works
2007-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	n30n	kiwinz_sucks	i just cant see it in GUI
