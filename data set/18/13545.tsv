2005-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	Ragol		hi, I can't compile kde 3.5 from svn nor amarok from svn after upgrading from hoary->breezy
2005-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	Ragol		here's the error msg of make
2005-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	Ragol		http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3864
2005-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	Ragol		after doing some searching, it seems that there was libXcursor.la file in hoary, but not in breezy
2005-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	Ragol		any ideas?
2005-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	Ragol		libxrender is another problematic library
2005-11-05T07:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	Ragol	what is this on the compile of specifically?
2005-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	some more lines at http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3865
2005-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	is this enough?
2005-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	Ragol	that's fine. There doesn't seem to be a package in ubuntu that brings in that library. Hm
2005-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	yeah... I've noticed that
2005-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	Ragol	it should ideally come in libxcursor-dev
2005-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	that's where it came in hoary
2005-11-05T07:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	Ragol	might be worth just grabbing the .la and placing it inside usr/lib
2005-11-05T07:22:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	yeah, but how I can make that file?
2005-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	Ragol	grab the hoary pack, then just take the .la from there
2005-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	oh, okay... I'll try that
2005-11-05T09:13:00.000Z	Ragol	apokryphos	well, make seems to accept the old versions (from hoary pkgs) of those files, we'll see how it will work
