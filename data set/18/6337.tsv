2008-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	Akiv1		Hello everyone, I am looking for some answers to some questions I have regarding my video card and xorg and compizfusion
2008-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	Akiv1		I posted most of the details here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5430090#post5430090
2008-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	Akiv1		I would be really appreciative of any help
2008-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	what driver are you using. your xorg.conf is normal btw
2008-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	I haven't set up anything specific beyond default installation
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	How could I check?
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	then do. same as in debian. Xorg logs
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	what card do you have?
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	then you need to enable DRM
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	 How so?
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	again: check Xorg logs
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	It's odd because it seems like I have some of the Compiz effects
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	also glxinfo |grep direct to check for direct rendering
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	Pardon my ignorance, I wouldnt know what to do with the logs, nor where they are
2008-07-22T08:40:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	ï»¿that returned YES
2008-07-22T08:40:00.000Z	wols	Akiv1	then compiz should work
2008-07-22T08:41:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	Right, which is what I thought ... It seems like it is working, but the thing is, I am following a tutorial to embed a terminal in the desktop and it says System > Preferences should have a COMPIZ entry
2008-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	Akiv1	wols	So there should not be a Compiz entry in the System > Preferences option?
