2010-02-07T02:52:00.000Z	web1109		i'm using ubuntu 9.10 i386 alternate.iso. I used manual partitioning, the installer never asked me for grub location. At the end I chose "go back" instead of reboot, then in the menu chose install GRUB to disk, it then searches for other OSes and proceeds to install to (hd0) without asking me! how do I trick it into (hd0,3)?
2010-02-07T02:52:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	manually install it to (hd0,3)
2010-02-07T02:53:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	I want to do it from the current instance of the installation
2010-02-07T02:54:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	When I choose install GRUB to disk, it proceeds to search for OSes, but then without asking me installs to (hd0), why does it not ask me? On a similar computer the same steps resulted in it asking me for the location!
2010-02-07T02:57:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	os-prober searches for other OSes
2010-02-07T03:09:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	it determines what needs entries in the grub menu

2010-02-07T03:11:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	so then it os-prober is not responsible for reason the "install grub to harddisk" option of the alternate cd, not asking me for the location
2010-02-07T03:11:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	correct
2010-02-07T03:12:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	I can recite that page by heart at 3 am in the morning, it doesn't help me with my question
2010-02-07T03:12:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	do you want /boot in a certain location or you're sure you want grub installed on a partition instead of the mbr?
2010-02-07T03:13:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	i want grub in (hd0,3) (and I know the grub2 renumbering)
2010-02-07T03:14:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	"If you want to install it to some partition then use that partition name instead of /dev/sda e.g. /dev/sda1 for the second partition etc. Or if you want to install grub2 on another drive then you may use that name e.g. /dev/sdb for an external hard disk. "
2010-02-07T03:15:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	I'm in the alternate installer menu, are familiar with it? I have option "install grub to disk" or "install lilo to disk"
2010-02-07T03:16:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	you need to get to a shell of somekind. try ctrl+alt+f1
2010-02-07T03:16:00.000Z	web1109	chelz	i can go into chell, theres is a menu entry for taht
2010-02-07T03:16:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	do that then
2010-02-07T03:17:00.000Z	chelz	web1109	http://linuxers.org/howto/how-recover-grub2-ubuntu-910-karmic-koala and follow this guide. note "If you want to install it to some partition then use that partition name instead of /dev/sda e.g. /dev/sda1 for the second partition etc." as part of step 8
