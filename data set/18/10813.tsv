2007-02-19T07:30:00.000Z	tiredbones_		Do I have to mark which repoitory to use when using synaptic?
2007-02-19T07:30:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	no, just manage them directly in your sources.list
2007-02-19T07:32:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	well I update the list and I'm still getting the same erros when trying to in stall a plugin for Totem.
2007-02-19T07:32:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	which error ?
2007-02-19T07:33:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	this error --totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin: Depends: totem-gstreamer (=1.4.1-0ubuntu4) but 1.4.3-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
2007-02-19T07:34:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	running Edgy or Dapper ?
2007-02-19T07:34:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	dapper
2007-02-19T07:35:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	that's really weird... could you pastebin your sources.list ?
2007-02-19T07:36:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	sure give a second
2007-02-19T07:37:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	where is located????
2007-02-19T07:44:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	http://pastebin.com/884037
2007-02-19T07:50:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	did you get the sources.list file?
2007-02-19T07:51:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	the funny thing is that it wants to install totem-gstreamer 1.4.3 while the version in dapper repos is 1.4.1...
2007-02-19T07:53:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	I'll try, but I haven't got a glue where to being. thnks.
2007-02-19T07:56:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	do you already have totem-gstreamter installed ?
2007-02-19T07:56:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	yes. I''m removing it now.
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tiredbones_	anyway, if I were you, I'd try totem-xine instead
2007-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	tiredbones_	HymnToLife	ok
