2011-09-26T18:16:00.000Z	osb_		how would one enable dual core cpu support on Natty?  Ubuntu puts me in SMP mode with only one of my cpu cores appearing at half clock speed.
2011-09-26T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	how do you know it's only showing one
2011-09-26T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	where does that show it's only using 1 core
2011-09-26T18:17:00.000Z	osb_	ikonia	proc/cpuinfo says so.
2011-09-26T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	pastebin the full output of /proc/cpuinfo please.
2011-09-26T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	"cat /proc/cpuinfo" and put it in a pastebin
2011-09-26T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	sudo apt-get install pastebinit && cat /proc/cpuinfo | pastbinit
2011-09-26T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	the clock spead is not a massive issue as powerscaling can effect it,
2011-09-26T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	[    0.050174] SMP motherboard not detected.
2011-09-26T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	I suspect that's the issue
2011-09-26T18:23:00.000Z	osb_	ikonia	any ideas?
2011-09-26T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	just reading through the dmesg output
2011-09-26T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	 0.000000] Booting paravirtualized kernel on bare hardware
2011-09-26T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	that interests me, but I've not quite worked out the relevence yet
2011-09-26T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	it's not a kernel issue, I don't believe
2011-09-26T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	still reading trying to understand what's failing
2011-09-26T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	then do'nt use part image
2011-09-26T18:47:00.000Z	ikonia	osb_	I'd recommend against it, but ok
