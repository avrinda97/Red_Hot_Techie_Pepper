2005-10-30T08:50:00.000Z	bobn		i use mutt
2005-10-30T08:52:00.000Z	bobn		knew there was a good resource - used it once to gaet a windmodem going in debian.
2005-10-30T08:53:00.000Z	bobn		no.  pretty sure I've never useed theat nick.
2005-10-30T08:54:00.000Z	bobn		I like fluxbox myself when RAM or CPU are short
2005-10-30T08:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	I use ratpoison all the time :P
2005-10-30T08:55:00.000Z	bobn	Razor-X	I tried ratpoison - a little *too* basic.  But that is certainly light.
2005-10-30T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	well, I have no real use for any of the stuff most other desktops use, I view my videos maximized, my console session is maximized, all my games are maximized
2005-10-30T08:57:00.000Z	bobn	Razor-X	I often operate the same way.  BUt I have no averdion to the mouse, nor to sometimes using un=maximized windows.
2005-10-30T08:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	I don't like the mouse only beacuse it's a foot away from my keyboard :P
2005-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	bobn	Razor-X	I agre that a good UI minimizes the need to leave the keyboard.   anything that doesn't make the alt-tab sequence immediately available generally goes by the wayside in my book.
2005-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	ahhh, so was I :P
2005-10-30T09:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	but, Alt+Tab is useless for me, because of the fractional-second delay I get
2005-10-30T09:01:00.000Z	bobn	Razor-X	you must be young.  I'm terriblky impatitent ant alt-tab delay bothers me not.
2005-10-30T09:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	yes, I am young, :P
2005-10-30T09:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	i'm probably one of the youngest in the channel, I think
2005-10-30T09:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	really, I hate delay :P
2005-10-30T09:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	bobn	o_O, you're older than my dad (but not by much, though)
2005-10-30T09:02:00.000Z	bobn	Razor-X	very cool to be into this so young.
