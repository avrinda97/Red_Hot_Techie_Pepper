2006-06-03T10:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	totem-xine ?
2006-06-03T10:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	damn, that's crappy
2006-06-03T10:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	^^^
2006-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	what about "libquicktime0" ?
2006-06-03T10:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	wouldn't hurt
2006-06-03T10:24:00.000Z	qbar	tristanmike	I already have libquicktime0 installed
2006-06-03T10:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	you're on mac ? that's above me tehn
2006-06-03T10:27:00.000Z	qbar	tristanmike	yeah, apple trailers worked in breezy, but not in dapper
2006-06-03T10:27:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	don't tell me that....:(
2006-06-03T10:51:00.000Z	qbar	tristanmike	only problem is that I'm on a mac.  One of the old ones without an x86 processor
2006-06-03T10:52:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	oh, is that x86 specific? sorry, didn't know
2006-06-03T10:52:00.000Z	qbar	tristanmike	maybe I can compile from source
2006-06-03T10:52:00.000Z	tristanmike	qbar	that's always fun ;)
2006-06-03T10:58:00.000Z	qbar	tristanmike	of course the link to the source tarball is dead
