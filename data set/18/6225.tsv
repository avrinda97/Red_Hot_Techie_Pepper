2008-06-05T03:59:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	have you seen this page: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-ubuntukubuntuedubuntuxubuntu-without-cdrom-drive.html
2008-06-05T03:59:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	I don't want to *install* i want to boot an image remotely using pxe
2008-06-05T04:00:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	i don't have a hard drive on the computer i want to run ubuntu on, nor a cd-rom drive because it
2008-06-05T04:00:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	is in another machine
2008-06-05T04:00:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	ok, what you will need to do is set up a nfs server on the remote machine in addition to the pxe server
2008-06-05T04:01:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	i can't just boot an image?  i've tried it with an msdos boot image and it worked fine
2008-06-05T04:02:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	then the pxe stage will load the kernel, I think you can supply all the options you need to it via pxelinux (you may need a small initramfs, not sure)
2008-06-05T04:03:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	that's not really a practical solution for booting a whole linux OS, nfs is much easier to work with, and allows you to preserve changes across boots
2008-06-05T04:03:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	i have ubuntu installed on another partition on this machine, is there anyway to just point that to my laptop?
2008-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	it's probably possible but very complicated. I wouldn't recommend trying it either as it could break your ubuntu system
2008-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	can i do nfs over pxe?
2008-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	you'd have a much easier job of setting up a separate installation (you'd also have a much easier job if you were using linux as your host but you can probably get around that)
2008-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	no, they would run as separate services but that's not an issue, they can both run on the same machine
2008-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	the laptop doesn't have a hard drive, a disk drive, or a cdrom drive
2008-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	my only option is network booting with pxe
2008-06-05T04:08:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	yeah I've figured that much out it's ok ;-). I mean you can run both the pxe server and the nfs server on your windows machine which -does- have the hdd etc.
2008-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	lscapegoatl	funkyHat	so how do i get from pxe to nfs, i'd still need an image of some operating system to send to the laptop to then go to nfs
2008-06-05T04:10:00.000Z	funkyHat	lscapegoatl	shall we go to /query? this is probably too much noise for #ubuntu
