2012-08-02T21:14:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		say i want to queue up a bunch of commands, the last one being done by root. how do i do this so that the password prompt shows up first?
2012-08-02T21:14:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		i can't do everything as root, since it requires wine
2012-08-02T21:14:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		it's my and only my computer, so i'd be fine with even something stupid like sudo --password="hunter2" [blah] if possible
2012-08-02T21:15:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		i'm considering using xvkbd for that now, but that seems stupid
2012-08-02T21:16:00.000Z	jrib	WHAT_UP	one way would be to do everything with sudo but just call "su - -c COMMAND" on the other commands.  But you should explain exactly what you are trying to do in case we can give you better advice
2012-08-02T21:16:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	i have one device mounted by root i want to copy the result to
2012-08-02T21:17:00.000Z	jrib	WHAT_UP	result of what?
2012-08-02T21:17:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	some script i wrote that creates an mp4 file
2012-08-02T21:17:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	so it's just a sudo cp command at the end
2012-08-02T21:17:00.000Z	jrib	WHAT_UP	can you not give your user access to that part of the mounted filesystem?
2012-08-02T21:18:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	maybe. it's a mounted samba server i really only should be uploading files to. can i give a nonroot user access without messing up the server itself?
2012-08-02T21:19:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	i'm not sure i understand how the sudo - -c thing works. can you give an example?
2012-08-02T21:19:00.000Z	jrib		!sru | magma
2012-08-02T21:20:00.000Z	jrib	WHAT_UP	su - some_other_user -c COMMAND
2012-08-02T21:20:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	ah, got it. does COMMAND need to be in quotes?
2012-08-02T21:20:00.000Z	jrib	WHAT_UP	not sure
2012-08-02T21:20:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	seems so. thanks!!
2012-08-02T21:24:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	jrib	i think it works (i'll find out in a couple hours when the script is done). thank you!
