2006-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	THX-1138	livingdaylight	- there is a rules file in /etc/x11/xkbd/ - still working on your question.
2006-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	THX-1138	i don't follow?
2006-10-05T16:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	THX-1138	i need to co into /etx/x11/xkbd?

2006-10-06T16:03:00.000Z	THX-1138	livingdaylight	- i wonder if the %variables en   etc are used in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
2006-10-06T16:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	THX-1138	i wouldn't know either :s
2006-10-06T16:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	THX-1138	all i know is i'm using the gui in System / keyboard layout and changing language but without effect
2006-10-06T16:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	THX-1138	what would be the use of having a gui to change something if i have to after go into x11 config files to complete the changes? or to infact realise it!
2006-10-06T16:05:00.000Z	THX-1138	livingdaylight	- try running the root desktop and then use the gui there? - doesn't sound comepletely right. but worht a try i am out of answers

2006-10-06T16:11:00.000Z	THX-1138	livingdaylight	- log off the 'net (root and connected is bad.) then Ctrl+Alt+F1 login with your username. - easier though command line is to open the the troublesome app type ps -e   find it's name use that name in terminal to launch it using gksudo <nettlesome_app>
2006-10-06T16:12:00.000Z	THX-1138	livingdaylight	- You will want to see the "#" symbol to tell you the command will run with super powers
2006-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	THX-1138	log off the net? I'm hooked to broadband non-stop
2006-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	THX-1138	livingdaylight	-no open connections. ya know.
