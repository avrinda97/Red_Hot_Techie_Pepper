Say we mount our encrypted partition B, we decide to change a file on it  from bytes 1-240. This affects partitiong B in a VERY limited range. It would be easily to block update this, BUT you're asking the host system to perform the sync on the ENCRYPTED data... meaning partition A. To the host

2011-05-08T12:51:00.000Z	magn3ts		I feel fairly safe in saying that striping reduces the strength of the  encryption or introduces weakness. but not enough to claim it as fact.
2011-05-08T12:51:00.000Z	magn3ts		How long until ext4 is FUSE?
2011-05-08T12:51:00.000Z	magn3ts		oh wait, I remember what the U stands for.
2011-05-08T12:52:00.000Z	magn3ts		good luck, really don't count on it working man.
2011-05-08T12:54:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	Nice, that's like a "LOOK HERE" sign =)
2011-05-08T12:35:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	sure you can, you just may not like the results =)
2011-05-08T12:52:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	EWE?
2011-05-08T12:52:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	stripping across drives or partitions?
2011-05-08T12:53:00.000Z	magn3ts	Jymmm	MAC OS X will stripe an encrypted volume such that the changes to the contents of the host volume is similar to the encrypted volume.
2011-05-08T12:55:00.000Z	magn3ts	Jymmm	yeah, I'm still having a hard time figuring out how that works. I'd think at best each so-much-sized area would be encrypted and then mounted in a unionfs style.
2011-05-08T12:55:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	(FWIW, ZFS now supports encryption =)
2011-05-08T12:56:00.000Z	magn3ts	Jymmm	does that help things? I know nothing about ZFS.
2011-05-08T12:56:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	Not under ubuntu.... yet.
2011-05-08T12:57:00.000Z	magn3ts	Jymmm	is ZFS behind or is ubuntu somehow limited in another way?
2011-05-08T12:58:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	ZFS is a Solaris thing, s l o w l y getting ported to xBSD and sorta kind in a fubar way to linux
2011-05-08T12:59:00.000Z	Jymmm	magn3ts	one nice thing about ZFS is it prevents corruption creep...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS
