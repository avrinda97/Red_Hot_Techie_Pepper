2008-12-18T09:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	take a paxil, i as in the wrong channel
2008-12-18T09:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	IndyGunFreak	Sorry, I was used to this channel being helpful and staying on topic
2008-12-18T09:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	IndyGunFreak	Guess it's degraded significantly since then :)
2008-12-18T09:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	and i have no problem w/ that.. other than when its directed at me...
2009-01-06T01:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	i've never heard of migratiung one.. that would be entertaining
2009-01-06T01:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	hmm, maybe not as bad as i thought... never heard of LVPM..
2009-01-06T01:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	you can comment them out no problem at all.. and they won't show up
2009-01-06T01:54:00.000Z	ASULutzy	IndyGunFreak	But when you install a new kernel, Grub will go ahead and readd them unless you remove them, right?
2009-01-06T01:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	once i comment my old ones out, they never show up again
2009-01-06T01:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	IndyGunFreak	You may be right, I just never bother to remove them :)
2009-01-06T01:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ASULutzy	lol
