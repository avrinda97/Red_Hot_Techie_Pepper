2007-05-25T12:12:00.000Z	clearze1		 |ericsson|: yeah, what are you trying to do with ssl?
2007-05-25T12:12:00.000Z	|ericsson|	clearze1	need to run apache with SSL, currently running on feisty
2007-05-25T12:13:00.000Z	|ericsson|	clearze1	obviously the certificate is missing in feisty, so don't know how to go around that...
2007-05-25T12:13:00.000Z	clearze1		 |ericsson|: Hmmm, I don't run apache on a feisty install but I haven't had problems with dapper. Is it giving you a specific error?
2007-05-25T12:14:00.000Z	|ericsson|	clearze1	the thing is that the apache2-ssl-certificate is missing in feisty, so I don't know what to do..
2007-05-25T12:14:00.000Z	clearze1		 |ericsson|:  one sec
2007-05-25T12:16:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22392/ <---that should help you.
2007-05-25T12:16:00.000Z	clearze1		oh wait that is 64 bbit
2007-05-25T12:16:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	hang on
2007-05-25T12:17:00.000Z	|ericsson|	clearze1	hanging here..
2007-05-25T12:19:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	sudo a2enmod ssl <---try that. That should enable ssl
2007-05-25T12:20:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	Did that work for you?
2007-05-25T12:21:00.000Z	|ericsson|	clearze1	I've already enabled that one, but the procedure for creating cerfiticates is not there since the -sll-package is non-existent in fiesty, i.e doesn't work :(
2007-05-25T12:22:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	If not do sudo apt-get install ssl-cert; /usr/sbin/make-ssl-cert /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem
2007-05-25T12:22:00.000Z	clearze1		That should solve your problem
2007-05-25T12:24:00.000Z	|ericsson|	clearze1	I'll check when we have a change to restart the server, hopefully some progress due to this though...
2007-05-25T12:25:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	btw you do know that feisty is a desktop release of ubuntu right. ie not made to run a server right.
2007-05-25T12:26:00.000Z	clearze1	|ericsson|	If it is possible run dapper or even debian. Dapper is supported long term. Feisty is basically a 6 month release.
