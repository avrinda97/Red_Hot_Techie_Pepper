2010-04-06T14:29:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	hmm not sure.. what version of skype are you using?

2010-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	its 2.1.0.81 beta i guess
2010-04-06T14:31:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	not sure if it works in other apps then it must be a skype problem
2010-04-06T14:31:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	is there any ubuntu version of skype i can use?
2010-04-06T14:33:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	have you seen this? Maybe it is of some help https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeWebCams
2010-04-06T14:34:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	i've seen it... my webcam is not listed there... its so weird that this webcam works fine for everything but skype... and i have to login to windows to do skype... :(
2010-04-06T14:35:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	Well thats the problem with proprietary software who's main target isn't linux
2010-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	yeah but its too popular to even avoid... :S and that is miserable...  :S
2010-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	have a look at this too: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam
2010-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	ok man... diggin that now...
2010-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	there's a section there that seems your case (you see 'something' but then it doesn't work)
2010-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	yep... i see white emptiness... :)
2010-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	lorenzosu	idioteque	good luck then ;)
2010-04-06T14:40:00.000Z	idioteque	lorenzosu	thanks... i'll try following that webcam guide and pray that it works.
