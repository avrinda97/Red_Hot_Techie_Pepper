2009-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	kiris		I wish it said that before I bought it
2009-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	kiris		compiler issues here I come!
2009-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	kiris		thanks, guys
2009-03-07T02:46:00.000Z	kiris		why do you think I bought the 4GB? t
2009-03-07T02:46:00.000Z	kiris		I'm planning on some simulations and virtualisation, so I'll be using it
2009-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	kiris		?
2009-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	kiris		my pc came with 32-bit vista
2009-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	kiris		how stupid is that?
2009-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	kiris		it only detected 3.2GB of memory
2009-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	kiris		yeah, and I've installed ubuntu dual-boot
2009-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	guntbert	kiris	try 64 with a live CD first, there are still some problems, but workarounds do exist
2009-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	kiris	guntbert	what kind of problems, for example?
2009-03-07T02:50:00.000Z	guntbert	kiris	getting flash to run seems to be one iirc
2009-03-07T02:51:00.000Z	kiris	guntbert	ah, crap. I use flash a lot
2009-03-07T02:51:00.000Z	guntbert	kiris	I am on 64 and youtube is no problem for my firefox anymore
2009-03-07T02:52:00.000Z	kiris	guntbert	what 64-bit issues *do* you have? I wouldn't want to get all setup and find something really fundamental is completely broken
2009-03-07T02:53:00.000Z	guntbert	kiris	thats why I suggested an extended live CD session, I myself don't have any 64-bit issues, but I'm not into video/sound...
2009-03-07T02:53:00.000Z	kiris	guntbert	hmm, ok. I'll try the live cd
