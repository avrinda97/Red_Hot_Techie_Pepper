2009-07-22T10:11:00.000Z	Helliana		can someone please help me figure out why i don't have sound in flash videos while using Firefox?
2009-07-22T10:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	using pulseaudio?
2009-07-22T10:12:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	i guess.
2009-07-22T10:13:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	what i don't understand is i did nothing different on my desktop than i did on my laptop
2009-07-22T10:14:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	could be a hardware difference
2009-07-22T10:14:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	sound works everywhere else, just not in flash.
2009-07-22T10:20:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	followed that website, still no sound in flash
2009-07-22T10:21:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	any other ideas?
2009-07-22T10:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	you installed libflashsupport?
2009-07-22T10:22:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	yes
2009-07-22T10:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	and restarted firefox?
2009-07-22T10:23:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	yes, rebooted the entire system actually
2009-07-22T10:26:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	System->Preferences->Sound  what is everything pointed to? pulseuadio or alsa?
2009-07-22T10:28:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	trying to pull it up...
2009-07-22T10:29:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	I can't find where you are talking about looking
2009-07-22T10:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	waitasec... did you say Kubuntu or Ubuntu?
2009-07-22T10:30:00.000Z	Helliana	Gnea	Kubuntu
2009-07-22T10:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Helliana	big difference there :) sorry about that, you should check out #kubuntu, unless someone else here is familiar with the kde gui
