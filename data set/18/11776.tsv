2008-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	whisperkiller		is there a reason why my laptop wont boot from the cdrom?
2008-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Is the bios cmos set to boot the cd first
2008-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	IS it a Dell or HPO?
2008-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	HOw did you burn the disk.. as a single file or as an image
2008-05-28T06:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	INteresting.. perhaps a bad drive... do you get the first menu screen?
2008-05-28T06:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Double check the cd in a diff machine...
2008-05-28T06:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Sounds like hardware issue..
2008-05-28T06:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	YOu can try usb stick or one of the many other ways we have to install ubuntu
2008-05-28T06:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Does ANY cd boot
2008-05-28T06:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	I did say ANY disk
2008-05-28T06:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Possibly knocked out the cd reader as well
2008-05-28T06:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	USB might be a better way to go
2008-05-28T06:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Now you are just making it hard on yourself.. bad hd, bad cd and no usb
2008-05-29T06:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	why not reinstall if it is that messed up
2008-05-29T06:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	That is what happened right..
2008-05-29T06:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Buy a usb stick.. or take it to a professional else you are wasting your time otherwise not to mention ours
2008-05-29T06:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	 A $9 usb stick... isnt worth the time you have already spent on this
2008-05-29T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whisperkiller	Good luck
