2007-05-10T11:21:00.000Z	ooazzaoo		i need help with a regexp that will print all characters before ":::" in a file.  Can anyone help?
2007-05-10T11:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	sure
2007-05-10T11:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	you mean on a line?
2007-05-10T11:23:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	dump of what file format?
2007-05-10T11:24:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	option 1: awk
2007-05-10T11:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	option 2: sed
2007-05-10T11:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	sed -e 's/^\(.*\):::.*$/\1/'
2007-05-10T11:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	that's the one you want for sed
2007-05-10T11:26:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	I like the awk solution better, easier to read :)
2007-05-10T11:26:00.000Z	ooazzaoo	SuperQ	me too
2007-05-10T11:28:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	the sed one would help you more with learning regexp :)
2007-05-10T11:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	I could give you a bit of a verbose explanation of how the sed line works
2007-05-10T11:30:00.000Z	ooazzaoo	SuperQ	thanks.. works great
2007-05-10T11:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	:)
2007-05-10T11:31:00.000Z	ooazzaoo	SuperQ	now i've got duplicate usernames (dump binary also exports pass history) appended with username_history_x.  Sed to delete all lines matchin _history?
2007-05-10T11:33:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	| grep -v "_history"
2007-05-10T11:34:00.000Z	ooazzaoo	SuperQ	thanks.. works great
2007-05-10T11:36:00.000Z	SuperQ	ooazzaoo	yes :)
