2007-04-08T11:17:00.000Z	morpheus_74		Hi.  If I install the beta version of Fiesty, do I have to do a fresh install of the final version, or can I simply download and install the patches from the repository?
2007-04-08T11:17:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	you can install the patches and upgrades from beta
2007-04-08T11:18:00.000Z	morpheus_74	atoponce	and this means I don't need to wipe the drive and do a fresh install, right?
2007-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	right. if you install the feisty beta, you'll get updates just like normal, that will take you to stable

2007-04-08T11:29:00.000Z	morpheus_74	atoponce	So is there much performance difference between Ubuntu server and a minimal debian install, on a lower end machine?
2007-04-08T11:30:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	hmmm. really, the only differences, are ubuntu services are not listening for connections, and the repos are setup differently
2007-04-08T11:30:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	hardware-wise, i think they are similar in support
2007-04-08T11:31:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	ubuntu server does give you a lamp stack though. not sure about debian. i think you have to set up lamp yourself...
2007-04-08T11:33:00.000Z	morpheus_74	atoponce	The only reason I'm asking is I'm searching for a lite distro that will run on my old pen 150 with 32mb of ram (the lack of ram is the killer).  I only want to use this machine for extra storage.  What do you think?
2007-04-08T11:34:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	with only 32mb of ram? then you'll *definitely* have to install server, and even at that, you're going to be hurting. i'd probably either look into damn small linux, or upgrading your ram
2007-04-08T11:35:00.000Z	morpheus_74	atoponce	I tried DSL, but cannot get it to boot even in low memory mode!
2007-04-08T11:35:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	heh. i'd upgrade the ram, then
2007-04-08T11:36:00.000Z	atoponce	morpheus_74	32mb is just not enough, even for the most barebones install
2007-04-08T11:36:00.000Z	morpheus_74	atoponce	Your right!
