2007-04-28T13:05:00.000Z	jasin		I have wpa going in ubuntu :)
2007-04-28T13:06:00.000Z	jasin		wpa is better then wep but still not 100% secure
2007-04-28T13:06:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	WPA2 is much better but It still suffers from mac spoofing
2007-04-28T13:07:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	Super G ones do.
2007-04-28T13:08:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	and any router that supports n spec.
2007-04-28T13:13:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	RangeMax Netgear routes has wpa2
2007-04-28T13:14:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	I feel like buying a new router when mine works perfectly fine.
2007-04-28T13:15:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	its a waste of money when you're as poor as I am.
2007-04-28T13:17:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	I do not feel like buying a new router when mine works perfectly fine.
2007-04-28T13:17:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	its a waste of money when you're as poor as I am.
2007-04-28T13:18:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	True. Im poorer then you
2007-04-28T13:18:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	 I doubt it
2007-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	Wanna bet?
2007-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	I dont make bets its sin.
2007-04-28T13:20:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	Is not
2007-04-28T13:20:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	 your opinion.
2007-04-28T13:21:00.000Z	kahrytan	jasin	WPA is decent though
2007-04-28T13:21:00.000Z	jasin	kahrytan	 no its not, wpa is just as easily cracked as wep.
