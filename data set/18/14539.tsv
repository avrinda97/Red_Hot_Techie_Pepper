2005-07-16T12:15:00.000Z	harris|u		Can someone help me with apache? People can't connect to the IP for some reason and I don't see why unless the port is being blocked by default or something

2005-07-16T12:19:00.000Z	anacron	harris|u	how you'r friends are trying to access your page?
2005-07-16T12:20:00.000Z	harris|u	anacron	through firefox / the internet? I don't really know how to answer that
2005-07-16T12:20:00.000Z	anacron	harris|u	i mean is their address correct, like http://your_ip nothing like www.ip.com etc
2005-07-16T12:21:00.000Z	harris|u	anacron	Oh, yes
2005-07-16T12:23:00.000Z	anacron	harris|u	then i don't know what could possibly be wrong, except that port and maybe user access? (read and execute)
2005-07-16T12:24:00.000Z	harris|u	anacron	are you referring to port 78 or 80
2005-07-16T12:24:00.000Z	anacron	harris|u	i would use 80, but you just have to try which one works
2005-07-16T12:25:00.000Z	harris|u	anacron	can I PM you quickly?
2005-07-16T12:25:00.000Z	anacron	harris|u	i don't think i can help you anymore
2005-07-16T12:26:00.000Z	anacron	harris|u	but sure you can if you wan't to :D
