2009-08-26T02:23:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	You need ask but once.
2009-08-26T02:23:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	And that sounds like a firewall issue perhaps.
2009-08-26T02:23:00.000Z	KB1JWQ		 Sure the skype ports aren't being filtered, digitalbuddy
2009-08-26T02:24:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	KB1JWQ	sorry ... how to know if my ports are filtered?
2009-08-26T02:30:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	KB1JWQ	could you help me?
2009-08-26T02:30:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	Unlikely.  If you haven't forwarded the ports in your firewall/router, it's going to throw that error.
2009-08-26T02:31:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	KB1JWQ	then how to fix it?
2009-08-26T02:32:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	Forward the ports in your router/firewall. Q.E.D.
2009-08-26T02:32:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	KB1JWQ	whats Q.E.D?
2009-08-26T02:33:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	It's latin shorthand for quod erat demonstrandum. :-)  And no, that doesn't help you, but you might consult the documentation for your router to see how it works. :)
2009-08-26T02:54:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	KB1JWQ	it didn't help
2009-08-26T02:54:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	That's unfortuate.
2009-08-26T02:55:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	digitalbuddy	Go read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
2009-08-26T02:55:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	KB1JWQ	is there skype room in irc?
