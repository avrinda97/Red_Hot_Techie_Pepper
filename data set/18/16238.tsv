2005-01-14T13:11:00.000Z	kagou		i'm playing with grub install problem on AMD64 :(  I don't understand why installer freeze, and under the console and after a chroot grub-install works ?!
2005-01-14T13:12:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	what filesystem do you use ?
2005-01-14T13:19:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	lets go on here,  because it belongs rather in this channel .... can you hit ctrl-alt-f3 to see if there are errors in the last lines ?
2005-01-14T13:21:00.000Z	kagou	ogra	"grub is already the newest version"
2005-01-14T13:21:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	hmm, looks not like an error......
2005-01-14T13:22:00.000Z	kagou	ogra	no and under Alt-F4 no error
2005-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	i'm not sure which exactly is the error console....try f2 - f4 there should be a lot of msgs in one of them
2005-01-14T13:24:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	hmm..... at least there should be a list of the commands that were run....
2005-01-14T13:27:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	what is the error you get i the installer screen ? hao long did you give grub to finish (how long did you wait ?)
2005-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	kagou	ogra	too much
2005-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	heh, what is too much for you ?
2005-01-14T13:30:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	hmm, but the rest of the install went fine ?
2005-01-14T13:32:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	and that worked ?
2005-01-14T13:32:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	i.e. the system boots ?
2005-01-14T13:34:00.000Z	kagou	ogra	after the reboot, keyboard and locales are not configured
2005-01-14T13:34:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	run base-config
2005-01-14T13:34:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	that is normally the first thing run after the first reboot.....
2005-01-14T13:35:00.000Z	ogra	kagou	....it does the second part of the install
