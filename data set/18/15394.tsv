2006-01-18T11:30:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	put a display number on that (192.168.0.56:0, for example)
2006-01-18T11:32:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	describe your environment again please
2006-01-18T11:34:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	so you're on host1, connected via ssh to host2, and want to run an X app on host2 with it displayed back to host1?
2006-01-18T11:35:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	i can't help with fluxbox menus
2006-01-18T11:37:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	if you are logged into the machine locally with an X session, why do you want to launch an X app from the console? just launch it in the X session.
2006-01-18T11:37:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	ah, try setting DISPLAY to localhost:0 or even just ":0"

2006-01-18T11:47:00.000Z	fangorious	yggdrasil	ssh can actually setup X forwarding automatically, if you use -X when connecting at the command line
