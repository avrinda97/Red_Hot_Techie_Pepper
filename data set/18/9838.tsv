2007-11-03T03:35:00.000Z	||drake||		alright, I'm on a live session now because I can no longer boot into ubuntu at all
2007-11-03T03:35:00.000Z	||drake||		who's willing to help me out?
2007-11-03T03:35:00.000Z	||drake||		sorry... questions still stands
2007-11-03T03:36:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	post what you're having troubles with and whoever knows will answer
2007-11-03T03:37:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	might be a misconfiguration in the xorg.conf
2007-11-03T03:39:00.000Z	||drake||	euxneks	this i know... which is why i hate having to answer the question that way... lemme send you some more error messages it comes up with
2007-11-03T03:40:00.000Z	||drake||	euxneks	http://pastebin.com/m6d203005
2007-11-03T03:41:00.000Z	||drake||	euxneks	the xorg error log is at /var/log/Xorg.0.log.
2007-11-03T03:41:00.000Z	||drake||	euxneks	it reports no errors, which is one of the many many reason's im pretty sure it's not an xorg.conf problem
2007-11-03T03:42:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	looks like there is a formatting problem on your blacklist file
2007-11-03T03:42:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	do you use vi?
2007-11-03T03:43:00.000Z	||drake||	euxneks	i've blacklisted ubuntu's default driver for my webcam is all... it didn't have any effect on booting for a good two weeks or so
2007-11-03T03:43:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	try removing the offending line and booting again... ?
2007-11-03T03:43:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	or, better yet, commenting it out
2007-11-03T03:44:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	that's probably what I would try anyway, other than that you'd have to ask someone else with more knowledge about the system =P
2007-11-03T03:45:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	that's only a warning so it shouldn't be a problem
2007-11-03T03:46:00.000Z	||drake||	euxneks	coincindentally... it's no longer on my /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist i wonder where it went? clearly it must still be there
2007-11-03T03:50:00.000Z	euxneks	||drake||	beyond that I haven't a clue
