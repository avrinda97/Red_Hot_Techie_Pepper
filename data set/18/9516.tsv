2009-04-23T21:37:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Hi guys..
2009-04-23T21:37:00.000Z	mikebeecham		I'm wondering what would be the best way to network within Jackal 9.04:
2009-04-23T21:37:00.000Z	mikebeecham		I have a Mac Mini downstairs, with an attached USB HDD. This contains all my media folders on there, such as movies, mp3s, tv shows, etc. I would like to be able to access these from my Ubuntu machine upstairs, and currently have both machines cabled to a Netgear DG834 router.
2009-04-23T21:37:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Prior to installing Jackal, I was using GVFS (accessing as SFTP), and this worked kind of ok. However, I'm wondering is there is a more robust way to network the Mac to the Ubuntu machine.
2009-04-23T21:39:00.000Z	mikebeecham		and the folders are shared by samba
2009-04-23T21:40:00.000Z	mikebeecham		so theoretically, it's all there
2009-04-23T21:41:00.000Z	mikebeecham		moment**

2009-04-23T21:47:00.000Z	office	mikebeecham	you cant do this
2009-04-23T21:47:00.000Z	office	mikebeecham	must install sshd server at mac machines
2009-04-23T21:47:00.000Z	mikebeecham	office	 I've been doing it through GVFS for around 6 months now!
2009-04-23T21:48:00.000Z	office	mikebeecham	and now you can youse sshfs to mouint mac disk on ubuntu
2009-04-23T21:49:00.000Z	office	mikebeecham	or you can use sftp to thesame effect
