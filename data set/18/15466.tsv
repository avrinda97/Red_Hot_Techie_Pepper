2005-03-23T08:08:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	what do I look for?
2005-03-23T08:08:00.000Z	scandium	kresten	column "router" and the row "default"
2005-03-23T08:09:00.000Z	scandium		should be the ip address of your router
2005-03-23T08:10:00.000Z	scandium	kresten	oh sorry, with english locale it's called "gateway" and not "router"
2005-03-23T08:10:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	There's no router collumn, but there's a Gateway collumn in whitch is has my rout.... Yea
2005-03-23T08:10:00.000Z	scandium	kresten	sorry ;)
2005-03-23T08:10:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	no problem
2005-03-23T08:11:00.000Z	kresten		What do I do then?
2005-03-23T08:11:00.000Z	scandium	kresten	ok, maybe it's DNS then
2005-03-23T08:12:00.000Z	kresten		Scandium, what about it?
2005-03-23T08:13:00.000Z	scandium	kresten	well, if gateway info is correct and you can connect to boxes on your lan but not surf the web, maybe it doesn't lookup host names correctly...try to ping an IP address, if that works, try a hostname
2005-03-23T08:14:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	I've tried pinging but no luck... (only my local computers...)
2005-03-23T08:17:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	Could it be that I just have a lousy router?
2005-03-23T08:19:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	It doesn't say "gw", but the other things...
2005-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	will do...
2005-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	scandium	kresten	it's heze talking to you now, not me ;)
2005-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	kresten	scandium	sorry bout that...
