2007-07-03T06:00:00.000Z	mavsman4457		i was told to boot from the Live-CD, mount my installation and change kboot.conf from there, does that mean reinstalling ubuntu altogether, if not how do i do that?
2007-07-03T06:00:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	No, you aren't re-installing
2007-07-03T06:00:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	so how do i do what i want to do
2007-07-03T06:01:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	You boot... you openthe drive, you browse to the file, edit, save, and reboot :)
2007-07-03T06:03:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	How do I get to the drive? I don't see it on the desktop
2007-07-03T06:03:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	I'm going to PM you, ok?
2007-07-03T06:04:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	ok but I don't think I can sned any PM's to you because I need to register or something
2007-07-03T06:05:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	lol okay... look under Places - Computer
2007-07-03T06:06:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	one sec my other computer is about 20 feet away so my responses may be delayed
2007-07-03T06:08:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	OK I've found my kboot file and I can edit it but is there any way to install new kernel through my live cd?
2007-07-03T06:09:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	Maybe... but don't try. why would you want to do that anyway?
2007-07-03T06:10:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	because my ubuntu won't boot up and I think that it isn't just my kboot file that is the cause but I could try editting my kboot file and if that doesn't fix it then I could install a new kernel from the live cd?
2007-07-03T06:10:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	Er.. no I don't think you can even do that.
2007-07-03T06:11:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	Is it grub that's erroring?
2007-07-03T06:11:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	I don't know what grub is but I think it's because my custom kernel changed sda1 to ps3sda1 and then the update manager's kernel changed it back to sda1
2007-07-03T06:12:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	Sorry, can't help you there
2007-07-03T06:12:00.000Z	mavsman4457	aboutblank	sorry I have to go eat dinner but will you be on in a half hour?
2007-07-03T06:13:00.000Z	aboutblank	mavsman4457	Probably not.
