2006-05-15T16:11:00.000Z	cge		Does anyone know if there is a program like screen that does vertical splits instead of just horizontal splits?
2006-05-15T05:01:00.000Z	cge		could someone else try telnetting into port 25 on vmadmin's system?
2006-05-15T05:02:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	it lists all rules
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	you can use 'man iptables' to learn more about it.
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	cge	eggzeck	what?
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	eggzeck		:/
2006-05-15T05:04:00.000Z	cge	eggzeck	oh I see. I  worded that in a rather ambiguous manner.
2006-05-15T05:04:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	haha.
2006-05-15T05:05:00.000Z	cge	eggzeck	But vmadmin seems to have bigger problems than that. He says that the server install is mostly default, but X is listening on TCP, while most of the safer things (ssh,smtp) are filtered.
2006-05-15T05:06:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	ubuntu does not filter by defualt
2006-05-15T05:06:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	make sure he has openssh-server installed
2006-05-15T05:07:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	that will allow others to ssh into his box
2006-05-15T05:07:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	so he should: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2006-05-15T05:09:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	without openssh-server, if I tried: ssh -l <username> <ip> it would timeout or say connection refused.
2006-05-15T05:09:00.000Z	cge	eggzeck	netstat -lt shows ssh, whereas nmap on my machine shows that it is filtered. But actually it appears he might be running under vmware!? Why didn't he tell me that. Oh well, he's left anyway.
2006-05-15T05:10:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	haha. But remember, ssh and ssh server are two diff things :)
2006-05-15T05:10:00.000Z	cge	eggzeck	Yeah, but it is netstat -lt showing it as listening on *:22.
2006-05-15T05:11:00.000Z	eggzeck	cge	well the port shouldn't be filtered by default. Either way he's gone :p
