2009-11-16T22:02:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	you should be booting to hd1,0 if you want to boot to the first partition of sdb
2009-11-16T22:02:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	Such file (menu.lst) not present in /boot/grub
2009-11-16T22:03:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	I try change grub.cfg from (hd1,1) to (hd1,0). I try reboot
2009-11-16T22:03:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	sounds good.
2009-11-16T22:10:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	I work from liveCd. How I can mount /dev/sdb1 in rw? (sudo mount -o rw /dev/sdb1 /mnt) gives me only readonly access?
2009-11-16T22:11:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	does it give you any errors?
2009-11-16T22:11:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	I can't edit grub.cfg as it mounted readonly :(
2009-11-16T22:12:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	you can edit it in grub too. Grub has it's own built in editor.
2009-11-16T22:12:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	but that's only temporary
2009-11-16T22:12:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	I umount it everywhere, try mount with mount -o,rw or mount -o rw and anyway it mounted readonly
2009-11-16T22:13:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	have you tried mounting without rw? just with -o?
2009-11-16T22:14:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	hm... I don't know.
2009-11-16T22:14:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	mount -o, give also readonly access
2009-11-16T22:14:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	maybe you should get someone who's a bit more experienced to help you. sorry.
2009-11-16T22:14:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	I don't know.
2009-11-16T22:15:00.000Z	lexxmt	Kravlin	I try boot from different livecd
2009-11-16T22:15:00.000Z	kravlin	lexxmt	good luck
