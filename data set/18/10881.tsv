2007-07-15T16:30:00.000Z	ditoa		hi all.
2007-07-15T16:31:00.000Z	ditoa		i got a c++ related question, where is the best place to ask it?
2007-07-15T16:31:00.000Z	ditoa		ahh, tried #c++ instead. cpp doesnt exist. my bad :/
2007-07-15T15:03:00.000Z	ditoa		hey all
2007-07-15T15:03:00.000Z	ditoa		what would be the most sensible programming language to start with if wanting to learn how to program with ubuntu as your operating system?
2007-07-15T15:04:00.000Z	NigelS	ditoa	if you don't know any languages then you can't go far wrong with learning C
2007-07-15T15:05:00.000Z	NigelS	ditoa	from that you can recognise the syntax of the more modern languages
2007-07-15T15:05:00.000Z	ditoa	NigelS	I was wondering if learning C might be a bad idea for a n00b like myself?
2007-07-15T15:05:00.000Z	NigelS	ditoa	why?
2007-07-15T15:05:00.000Z	NigelS	ditoa	you only stop being a noob when you have learned something new :)
2007-07-15T15:05:00.000Z	ditoa	NigelS	just that it is a difficult language in that it is much lower levels than languages such as java or python
2007-07-15T15:06:00.000Z	ditoa		i have pretty much zero programming history
2007-07-15T15:06:00.000Z	ditoa		batch files and vbscript is basically it
2007-07-15T15:06:00.000Z	NigelS	ditoa	it's not more difficult really - you just have to do more things without the oo model abstracting it away.  If you learn C then you understand to a finer level the benefit of OO and will appreciate Java/C# etc more
2007-07-15T15:06:00.000Z	ditoa		a tiny bit of C# a couple of years ago
2007-07-15T15:07:00.000Z	ditoa		ok cool
2007-07-15T15:07:00.000Z	ditoa		will have a look around on some C websites and see how i get on :)
2007-07-15T15:07:00.000Z	NigelS	ditoa	you don't have to go deep into C either really
