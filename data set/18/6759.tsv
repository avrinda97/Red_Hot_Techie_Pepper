2008-06-15T22:19:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	-_- I am doing it when it disappears from my screen view.
2008-06-15T22:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	and its annoying as hell.. give it a couple minutes, and people will respond if they know the answer.
2008-06-15T22:21:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	Nvm I can probably figure it out myself.
2008-06-29T19:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	can you not boot a CD?
2008-06-29T19:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	hmm, is your cd writer bad?.. wy won't it co-operate
2008-06-29T19:14:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	Its not the CD Writer I have replaced it with other ones. The problem is when I got to burn anything or open up the blank disk I get the CD Error No Disk in CD Drive
2008-06-29T19:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	are you burning it under Ubuntu, or under Windows, or what?
2008-06-29T19:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	what program are you using to burn it?
2008-06-29T19:15:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	Nero,MagicISO,ISOBuster.
2008-06-29T19:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	?.. what?.. naplusis?
2008-06-29T19:19:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	The exact error No Disk Inserted into drive D:
2008-06-29T19:20:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	oh sorry about that I was just having a flashback of a program I was working on to make my Windows interface better.
2008-06-29T19:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	so you can't burn any files, not just images, that suggests something is wrong w/ your drive.
2008-06-29T19:22:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	But I get better detection on Ubuntu than Windows. On Ubuntu I can at least OPEN up blank cd's i havn't tried writing on Ubuntu yet.
2008-06-29T19:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	can you boot ubuntu?... w/o using the CD drive?
2008-06-29T19:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Falling-Inferno	be back in about 20min
2008-06-29T19:23:00.000Z	Falling-Inferno	IndyGunFreak	Im going to try getting Ubuntu's CD to work on my 2nd hard drive then im going to go Install it and then we can discuss this further.
