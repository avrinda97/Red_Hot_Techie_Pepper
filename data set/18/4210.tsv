2009-05-18T23:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		almost My personal opinion.. Anything.. is better than wubi
2009-05-18T23:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		!wubi
2009-05-18T23:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		almost And contrary to what it says there, I dont feel it is safe
2009-05-18T23:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		almost If you lose power to your PC you can lose everything including your ntfs/windows
2009-05-18T23:19:00.000Z	Jhodas	Jack_Sparrow	thats very unlikely
2009-05-18T23:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		almost It even says it in the fine print in the wubi faq
2009-05-18T23:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jhodas	Well.. It did happen to ME
2009-05-18T23:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jhodas	and it HAS happened to many others
2009-05-18T23:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jhodas	It has supposedly improved, but I still wont use it
2009-05-18T23:20:00.000Z	Jhodas	Jack_Sparrow	I dont see how you would lost NTFS
2009-05-18T23:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jhodas	Then do some reading.
2009-05-18T23:21:00.000Z	Jhodas	Jack_Sparrow	OK. :/ forgive me for being curious
2009-05-18T23:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jhodas	I fought hard for them NOT to include it
2009-05-18T23:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		wubi that is
2009-05-18T23:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		!es
2009-05-18T23:22:00.000Z	Jhodas	Jack_Sparrow	NTFS?
2009-05-18T23:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jhodas	No, I did not want them to do include the wubi thing...
