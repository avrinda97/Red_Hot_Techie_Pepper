2011-04-13T12:02:00.000Z	Jenk		Hi ! How do I extract archives having an 'xz' extension ? For example, "file.tar.xz".
2011-04-13T12:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	unxz /path/to/file.tar.xz
2011-04-13T12:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	You should also be able to just double click them.
2011-04-13T12:03:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	Thanks, but I get this error : "bash: unxz: command not found".
2011-04-13T12:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	It should then give you the command you need to run to install unxz.
2011-04-13T12:05:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	No, it doesn't. I understand, that you get something like 'app' can be installed by 'sudo apt-get install app' but in this case, I only get the above mentioned error.
2011-04-13T12:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	Can you pastebin the output of "lsb_release -a"?
2011-04-13T12:10:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	http://paste.ubuntu.com/593458/
2011-04-13T12:16:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	Is there a way I can install 'unxz' from source code and then use it ?
2011-04-13T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	You don't need to. Can you pastebin the output of "lsb_release -a"?
2011-04-13T12:17:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	Yes, I did send you the link, http://paste.ubuntu.com/593458/
2011-04-13T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	Sorry, missed it the first time.
2011-04-13T12:18:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	That's fine, but any luck on this ?
2011-04-13T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	Ubuntu 9.04 is no longer supported.
2011-04-13T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	Please upgrade to a supported release.
2011-04-13T12:20:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	Gosh, I'm waiting for natty to come out, and till then this is only a stop gap arrangement. Could you help ma manually install 'unxz' ? Possibly from source.
2011-04-13T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jenk	I don't particularly like to try to support EOL software, and it's officially not supported in this channel so you're pretty much on your own :(
2011-04-13T12:22:00.000Z	Jenk	Jordan_U	Oh, well. Thanks anyway for your time. :)
