2007-03-02T06:38:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi		I'm trying to grub-install, doesn't work

2007-03-02T06:43:00.000Z	timfrost	The_PHP_Jedi	have you got the root of your hard disk mounted?
2007-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	timfrost	whenever... a response is being awaited..
2007-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	timfrost	The_PHP_Jedi	What was the actual grub install command you used?
2007-03-02T06:47:00.000Z	timfrost	The_PHP_Jedi	add '--root=<mount point>' where <mount point> is the directory that you mounted the hard disk root to
2007-03-02T07:05:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	timfrost	I still get error 15
2007-03-02T07:13:00.000Z	timfrost	The_PHP_Jedi	is /boot separate from the root of your Ubuntu install? - Error 15 usually indicates that grub can't find critical files (kernel or initrd)
2007-03-02T07:13:00.000Z	timfrost	The_PHP_Jedi	in that case, the '--root=' needs to point to where you mount the /boot partition
2007-03-02T07:26:00.000Z	timfrost	The_PHP_Jedi	what is in /media/sda7/boot?
