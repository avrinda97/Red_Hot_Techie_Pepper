2009-12-08T23:37:00.000Z	nperry	manjula1	Whats the error message when booting 9.04
2009-12-08T23:38:00.000Z	manjula1	nperry	there is no error messages... only grub dont have the option to boot in to 9.04. i think it because i installed 8.10 later that grub is intalled from 8.10 and to reinstall the grub from 9.04 i cant get in to it
2009-12-08T23:41:00.000Z	nperry	manjula1	run 'sudo update-grub' from the 8.10, it should then update with the 9.04 lines
2009-12-08T23:44:00.000Z	nperry	manjula1	run 'sudo update-grub' from the 8.10, it should then update with the 9.04 lines
2009-12-08T23:45:00.000Z	manjula1	nperry	for that should i mount the 9.04 partition ? it has ext4 and 8.10 says it cant mount it
2009-12-08T23:47:00.000Z	nperry	manjula1	Ah, that could be a problem - As it'd need to see it :s
2009-12-08T23:47:00.000Z	manjula1	nperry	i update it and grub didnt see the ext4 partition
2009-12-08T23:48:00.000Z	manjula1	nperry	my problem is i dont have the ubuntu 9.04 CD with me so i can reinstall the grub from that and i have some files i need to get in that ext4 partion fast
