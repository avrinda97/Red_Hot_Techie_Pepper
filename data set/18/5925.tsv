2009-12-25T14:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	raj	there were issues with 9.04, but I think those issues were resolved before 9.10 was released
2009-12-25T14:22:00.000Z	raj	lstarnes	: but still i am not getting the resolution
2009-12-25T14:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	raj	you might need to manually configure the resolution on /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-12-27T01:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	raj	edit your xorg.conf to add the new resolutions
2009-12-27T01:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	raj	no, sorry
2009-12-27T01:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	raj	I am not good with xorg.conf
