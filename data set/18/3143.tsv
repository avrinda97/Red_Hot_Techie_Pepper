2010-06-20T00:29:00.000Z	howlymowly		hi guys.. i got a REAL big problem...  zattoo seems not to work anymore on my computer, because I have the wrong version of flash player installed (I am on ubuntu 10.04 64 bit)  what can i do now :)?
2010-06-20T00:30:00.000Z	howlymowly		because it seems ubuntu 64 bit doesn not support that version of flash player
2010-06-20T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	theres the 64bit flash ppa
2010-06-20T00:31:00.000Z	howlymowly	ActionParsnip	can you give me a hint to it :)?
2010-06-20T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	you'll need to remove the package you currently have
2010-06-20T00:32:00.000Z	howlymowly	ActionParsnip	you mean the "flashplayer-plugin"-package?
2010-06-20T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	yes, remove that, there isa 64bit one on that ppa specified there
2010-06-20T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	make sure you dont have gnash or swf-dec stinking up the place
2010-06-20T00:35:00.000Z	howlymowly	ActionParsnip	You are talking riddles to me ^^
2010-06-20T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	use http://pastebin.com    and give the output of: dpkg -l | grep flash;dpkg -l | grep gnash;  dpkg -l | grep swf
2010-06-20T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	and i will give you a big command to sort you out
2010-06-20T00:39:00.000Z	howlymowly	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/FvhL7eq2
2010-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	sudo dpkg -P flashplugin-installer    you already have flash installed, and its the 64bit version
2011-07-22T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	can you give  a pastebin of the output of:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade     (close software centre etc first)
2011-10-11T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	howlymowly	oneiric isn't supported here, ask in #ubuntu+1 pleas
