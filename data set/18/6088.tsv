2009-02-13T06:09:00.000Z	danopia		hey, what's the minimum amoutn of RAM that ubuntu server will install/work under? anyone know?
2009-02-13T06:09:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	i think 64 is what is listed under minimal specs
2009-02-13T06:10:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	that depends what you are looking to do, but for most people it should
2009-02-13T06:10:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	ok... arch failed becuase it loaded everything into RAM and quickly died
2009-02-13T06:10:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	and what's the lowest recomeanded CPU speed?
2009-02-13T06:10:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	well 400mhz is ok
2009-02-13T06:10:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	it's 233 MHz
2009-02-13T06:11:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	shold i not even try isntalling? :P
2009-02-13T06:11:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	you can try, but you may be waiting a long time for it to install
2009-02-13T06:12:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	normal ubuntu failed (not even boot), and arch booted to prompt but ran out of RAM installing
2009-02-13T06:12:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	i guess this wouldn't work as a good file server then :P
2009-02-13T06:12:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	normal ubuntu uses a GUI, that needs lots of memory
2009-02-13T06:13:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	i am aware
2009-02-13T06:13:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	ubuntu server shouldent have those kind of problems
2009-02-13T06:13:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	the install for ubuntu server is text based
2009-02-13T06:13:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	k, i'll try installing, but how well would it perform? would it be usable?
2009-02-13T06:14:00.000Z	KDE4000	danopia	it will be slow for installing, but after that it shouldent be so bad
2009-02-13T06:15:00.000Z	danopia	KDE4000	k
