2007-12-06T18:46:00.000Z	verb3k		guys is there a difference (even if minimal) between installing a command-line system with the alternate CD and installing it from the server CD ?
2007-12-06T18:46:00.000Z	verb3k		lots of questions :)
2007-12-06T18:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	i thought the alternate cd was the server cd
2007-12-06T18:48:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	 no , the alternate also installs ubuntu Desktop
2007-12-06T18:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	I think you are confused. alternate install a cli system no GUI
2007-12-06T18:48:00.000Z	IdleOne		!alternate | verb3k
2007-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	it's text mode installation....but the final system is with GUI
2007-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	then it is I who is confused hehe
2007-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	yes :)  ...but the alternate CD can let you choose if you want a text-mode system or a full system with a GUI
2007-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	then use the alternate cd
2007-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	I already downloaded the server CD and I have very slow connection :(
2007-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	so use the serve cd. either way they are both ubuntu
2007-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	there must be some small differences
2007-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	 that's why I ask here
2007-12-06T18:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	probably but surely can be fixed with apt-get install...
2007-12-06T18:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	verb3k	the server cd installs !LAMP by default IIRC
2007-12-06T18:55:00.000Z	IdleOne		gotta go. have a nice day folks
2007-12-06T18:55:00.000Z	verb3k	IdleOne	cya
