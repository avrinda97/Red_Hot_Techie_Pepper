2012-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	dfour		nope, but i'm up for trying new things :-)
2012-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	dfour		so i need to burn that disk, then try to run it off that?
2012-08-13T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	hold SHIFT at boot, and you can edit the boot
2012-08-13T16:30:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	i tried that. it says "Grub loading...", then goes to the ubuntu screen and freezes
2012-08-13T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	or you can manipulate from liveCD
2012-08-13T16:31:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	i booted from the livecd just to use the OS and could edit from there but i'm not sure if that actually changes it since i'm running it from the disc? if it does change it, then apparently it didn't work anyway
2012-08-13T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	you need to chroot
2012-08-13T16:32:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	what's that? i'm new to linux, fyi
2012-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	not new to looking online for an explanation though...?
2012-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video
2012-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	luckily, the bot will give me the answer before google ;-)
2012-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	the bot doesnt trigger automatically, t was auronandace who made it happen
2012-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	instead of immediately askng for clarification of new phrases and words, try the web a little, you'll learn more
2012-08-13T16:35:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	i've tried the web to solve this and it's been a long process already
2012-08-13T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	how, when youhave only just now heard the term chroot?
2012-08-13T16:36:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	it's never come up as one of the solutions/problems. on the other hand, i had seen the solution suggested here but hadn't tried it since it didn't quite match the problem i was having
2012-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dfour	but now it has, so you saying that you tried the web _after_ you have the new option is unintelligent....
2012-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	dfour	ActionParsnip	i tried this option because i assumed i was talking to a real person, not a bot
