2010-10-13T08:30:00.000Z	ssbr		I want to install Wine without having internet on the computer I'm installing it on. How would I do this?
2010-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	you will need to grab all the dependancies from the web, you could start with wine then see what the packages moan about, then go grab that package and so on, very messy
2010-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	ssbr	ActionParsnip	Oh. Well. The other part is that strictly speaking I haven't installed ubuntu yet, either
2011-09-02T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	look in /var/log/dpkg.log
2011-09-02T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	that will show the log of packages install / removed etc

2011-09-02T00:51:00.000Z	ssbr	ActionParsnip	that's about jscalibrator though
2011-09-02T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	I've only seen that in the playdeb ppa
2011-09-02T00:51:00.000Z	ssbr	ActionParsnip	it's the thing listed in the xbox controller FAQ

2011-12-28T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	are there any bugs reported?
2011-12-28T17:42:00.000Z	ssbr	ActionParsnip	I can't find one. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Apparently Ubuntu has tons of issues with hgview :(
2011-12-28T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	did you self compile the module?
2011-12-28T17:42:00.000Z	ssbr	ActionParsnip	no.
2011-12-28T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	what if you run:  sudo modprobe hg
2011-12-28T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	I'm assuming that's what it is, i don't use the app
2011-12-28T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ssbr	is that how it's used
2011-12-28T17:44:00.000Z	ssbr	ActionParsnip	the command-line program is called "hg", yes
