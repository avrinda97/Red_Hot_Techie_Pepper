2011-05-20T02:17:00.000Z	nit-wit		Emily; can you pist a image bin of the hard drive with a screen shot of the gparted partitioner on the Ubuntu live cd?

2011-05-20T02:20:00.000Z	nit-wit		Emily; the usb ports on one side of the eeepc don't boot forget which side.
2011-05-20T02:21:00.000Z	Em1ly	nit-wit	only one usb works? is that what you mean?
2011-05-20T02:21:00.000Z	Em1ly		* one side
2011-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	one side or the other I think the left side doesn't
2011-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	Em1ly		well, it's on the right
2011-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	Em1ly		so that could explain it if it's the other side..
2011-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	switch sides.;)
2011-05-20T02:23:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	if you get booted give us a screen shot of gparted, my concern here is how many partitions you already have.
2011-05-20T02:24:00.000Z	Em1ly		sorry to be stupid, what's gparted nit-wit ?
2011-05-20T02:25:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	gparted is the partitioner on the live cd menu-system-admin-gparted. It will show us exactly whats on there now.
2011-05-20T02:25:00.000Z	nit-wit		*what's
2011-05-20T02:26:00.000Z	Em1ly	nit-wit	sorry, again.  What cd ?
2011-05-20T02:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	cd is a general term for the ISO that was loaded to the thumb, it can be burned to a cd.;)
2011-05-20T02:29:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	good questions, better to know to understand the lingo.;)
2011-05-20T02:29:00.000Z	Em1ly		yep, I just feel a bit stupid..
2011-05-20T02:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	Em1ly	nah new things seem strange, and by and large the geek culture has a bit a a attitude.;)
