2007-11-01T08:40:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	you're wrong
2007-11-01T08:40:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	the rapid spindown/spin up is set by the manufacturer.
2007-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	it's just that ubuntu doesn't allow spindown unless you enable it.
2007-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	and, it doesn't happen to everyone.
2007-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	which is because it's a hardware issue :)
2007-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	Yea, it is.
2007-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	because window overrides the manufacture set spindown time.
2007-11-01T08:43:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Bonster	it's a hardware issue, not done by ubuntu.
