2006-07-08T10:33:00.000Z	jbwiv	snoops	I installed the dep package via apt, but when I start it up it starts ok but then just spins...
2006-07-08T10:34:00.000Z	snoops	jbwiv	spins?

2006-07-08T10:38:00.000Z	snoops	jbwiv	I would ask that you've installed all the required kde libs.. but apt handles that

2006-07-08T10:42:00.000Z	jbwiv	snoops	do you know where amaroK stores its sqlite database? I'm noticing an error there
