2008-08-14T17:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Dazed	try to disable some of the plugins for compiz to find the one that is causing the issue
2008-08-14T17:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Dazed	which plugins were you chiefly using
2008-08-14T17:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Dazed	when did this start messing up? an update, installing some new software or what
2008-08-14T17:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Dazed	well perhaps try to enable the plugins one by one until you find the culprit
2008-08-14T17:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Dazed	not so serious
