2005-05-21T08:27:00.000Z	Nub		which i don't want it to do

2005-05-21T08:27:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	The config file for your running stock kernel is in /boot
2005-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	Nub		can i just vi that and not have to change all the other options?
2005-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	You can copy it to your kernel source dir, then start from there. All defaults will be preselected.
2005-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	Nub	dcraven	thank you
2005-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	copy it as /usr/src/kernel-source/.config... Whatever your kernel source dir is.
2005-05-21T08:30:00.000Z	Nub	dcraven	that way can i just change a single option/
2005-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	If that's all you need, then yes. This assumes the same sources as your running kernel.
2005-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	Nub	dcraven	great, thank you
2005-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	If you are going to compile a newer kernel that what that config was made from, do a "make oldconfig".
2005-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	np
2005-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	Nub	dcraven	same kernel just changed driver
2005-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	dcraven	Nub	You're golden then.
