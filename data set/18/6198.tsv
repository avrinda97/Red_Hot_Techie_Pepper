2008-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	SonicComKid		Could someone help me with a fairly easy question?
2008-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	SonicComKid		I currently have a box acting as a network bridge. ie. Router->Server box with two network cards<-Windows XP box connected to server via other network card
2008-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	SonicComKid		if I install Ubuntu server on it. How do I bridge the two network adaptors to share internet and other resources across the two adaptors?
2008-06-13T07:23:00.000Z	SonicComKid		In windows XP I simply selected the two network adaptors, right clicked, and clicked 'bridge'. How do you do it with Ubuntu Server Edition?
2008-06-13T07:25:00.000Z	SonicComKid		....anybody know?
2008-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	SonicComKid		Does anybody here know how to bridge two network adatpors together in Ubuntu Server Edition (8.04)?
2008-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	SonicComKid		I did, I didn't find anything
2008-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	SonicComKid		when I searched for 'bridge' I got tons of things about wireless
