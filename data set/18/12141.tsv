2006-07-23T10:41:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	They end up going in /usr/include/linux
2006-07-23T10:42:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	There are actually other locations, the package is linux-kernel-headers.  If you installed build-essential, you'll have that package.  You can do dpkg -L linux-kernel-headers to list the files.
2006-07-23T10:42:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	If you plan to compile anything, then build-essential is... essential. ;-)
2006-07-23T10:43:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	dpkg -s linux-kernel-headers will give you the package blurb.
2006-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	Yes
2006-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	Not really the "owner", but the founder of Canonical, yes.
2006-08-04T09:30:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	His name is Mark Shuttleworth, he's South African, and is a self-made millionaire.
2006-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	gdb	shriphani	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth -- Is an interesting bio of him.
