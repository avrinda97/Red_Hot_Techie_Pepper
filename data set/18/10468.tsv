2007-12-14T23:42:00.000Z	Zero4k		Hey now, just about every windows issue that I've run across, can be fixed by reinstalling drivers / reconfiguring the problem software, and doesn't involve me spending two hours at a command line. But I don't want to get into the *nix versus windows debate right now. :P
2007-12-14T23:43:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	linux has a higher standard of usability lately.  it's worth sticking with it to see how much more powerful, stable and ethical it is compared to windows.  remember that you encounter problems on both linux and windows, it's just you are incredibly used to only the windows problems (so far)
2007-12-14T23:44:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	 that's not true anymore
2007-12-14T23:53:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	the console search stuff is very powerful, that's why they use them
2007-12-14T23:55:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	ldap?
2007-12-14T23:56:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	you probably need to find out more about what's available in linux before judging it
2007-12-14T23:57:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	generally everything is, apart from industry standard stuff like adobe photoshop, but you can run that on vmware, virtualbox or whatever anyway
2007-12-14T23:58:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	some people are touchy, but half the time they're often quite helpful
2007-12-14T23:59:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	my suggestion is don't integrate linux into your working environment proper until you've piloted it for at least a few months
2007-12-15T00:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	wine isn't really great for business applications
2007-12-15T00:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	try a virtual machine perhaps?
2007-12-15T00:03:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	generally you should be looking for ways to do stuff in linux, not wine, and as a last ditch run it on vmware
2007-12-15T00:05:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	all the stuff you want to do is possible, you just need to spend more time with linux and google
2007-12-15T00:06:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	and the ubuntu wiki
2007-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	in windows, some things are installed into program files, some in the registry, some in documents and settings...
2007-12-15T00:12:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	maybe just read the ubuntu manual?
2007-12-15T00:12:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Zero4k	then the wiki for reference
