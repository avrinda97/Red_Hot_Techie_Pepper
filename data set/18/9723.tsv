2007-03-06T07:44:00.000Z	techie		Can anybody tell me how to install a windows program using wine?
2007-03-06T07:44:00.000Z	madsen	techie	'wine WinProgram.exe'
2007-03-06T07:45:00.000Z	madsen	techie	np!
2007-03-06T07:45:00.000Z	techie	madsen	and after that just give the name of the window program I want to install?
2007-03-06T07:46:00.000Z	madsen	techie	What?
2007-03-06T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	techie	Hehe, no, WinProgram.exe was just an example.. Just 'wine Voicedit.exe' (if that's what the exe is called.)
2007-03-06T07:49:00.000Z	madsen	techie	Ok. I hope it works out. Wine can be a frustrating piece of cra---fantastic software!
2007-03-06T07:55:00.000Z	madsen	techie	Did you run 'wine "/mnt/windows/Program Files/Panasonic/Voice Editing/Voice Edit.exe"'?
2007-03-06T07:55:00.000Z	techie	madsen	I will try it now. wait
2007-03-06T07:57:00.000Z	techie	madsen	when I tried to run it i get: wine: cannot find '/mnt/windows/Program'
2007-03-06T07:58:00.000Z	madsen	techie	You need to put " " around the path to the exe.
2007-03-06T07:58:00.000Z	techie	madsen	thanks.
2007-03-06T07:58:00.000Z	madsen	techie	np
2007-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	techie	madsen	I got this:  wine "/mnt/windows/Program Files/Panasonic/Voice Editing/voice editing.exe"
2007-03-06T08:03:00.000Z	madsen	techie	looks like that program won't immediately run under wine... Maybe you should try #wine instead... Or check out their website.
2007-03-06T08:04:00.000Z	techie	madsen	I will do that
2007-03-06T08:04:00.000Z	madsen	techie	Either way, I've got to go now. Good luck with it!
2007-03-06T08:04:00.000Z	madsen	techie	No problem!
