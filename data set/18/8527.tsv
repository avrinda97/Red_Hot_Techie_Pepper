2008-10-12T21:06:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		Hi! I've just installed Ubuntu 8.04.1 from netinstall. HOWTO update gnome and nautilus to the latest version?
2008-10-12T21:07:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I want gnome2.24 and I have Version: 2.22.3
2008-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I know that using intrepid in the sources.list could update it to the latest version, but it also changes many many many other things.. I do not want a dependancy problem. So Is there a howto??
2008-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I`d like to have the latest ubuntu desktop, but stay at hardy^
2008-10-12T21:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	that is how you get the latest stuff you can get
2008-10-12T21:09:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	ompaul	I don't want intrepid
2008-10-12T21:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	then you really don't want to be doing what you are doing
2008-10-12T21:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	there is a long way to do something and a short way, you are choosing the long way
2008-10-12T21:10:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	ompaul	I want hardy+ latest ubuntu-desktop, or is latest beeing considererd unstable? I`m talking about latest stable
2008-10-12T21:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	then you have that
2008-10-12T21:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	you make your hardy unstable if you move the desktop around
2008-10-12T21:12:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	ompaul	Is hardy never gonna update to gnome2.24??
2008-10-12T21:12:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	never - this is not gentoo / slackware they patch and support the version that is there
2008-10-12T21:12:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	ompaul	I dislike replacing a working system just to obtain another gnome version
2008-10-12T21:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	well the tight integration is what you got, it is the design
2008-10-12T21:15:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	ompaul	OK, tight integration yah? I really need boost library >=1.35 wtf has boost to do with integration?? I need it for programming and lyx depends on it
2008-10-12T21:16:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	ompaul	only intrepid features boost 1.35
2008-10-12T21:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Xsss4hell	this is offtopic for here, why you may ask, because it is beyond the scope of the stable release and getting a stable release working, if the version you want is not with it, then you take the chance, if it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces
