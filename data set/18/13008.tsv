2011-04-15T10:45:00.000Z	aaron_c		hi, is there a default shortcut to make the font size in your terminal smaller?
2011-04-15T10:46:00.000Z	Khisanth	aaron_c	which terminal are you using?
2011-04-15T10:48:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	i'm using the default ubuntu terminal
2011-04-15T10:49:00.000Z	Khisanth	aaron_c	for the oen in Applications->Accessories you can just go to Edit -> Current Profile and change it from there
2011-04-15T10:49:00.000Z	Khisanth		or right click on the terminal and select Edit Current Profile
2011-04-15T10:49:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	ah i see.  is there a keyboard shortcut though?
2011-04-15T10:50:00.000Z	Khisanth	aaron_c	well that is permanent so ...
2011-04-15T10:50:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	i want to be able to change it on the fly, and i think i stumbled across the shortcut somehow but cant remember what i did
2011-04-15T10:50:00.000Z	Khisanth		but you could create multiple profiles with different font sizes
2011-04-15T10:50:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	hmm i see.  so there's no keyboard shortcut to do it temporarily?
2011-04-15T10:51:00.000Z	Khisanth	aaron_c	I don't recall ever running into that
2011-04-15T10:53:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	mmk, thanks
2011-04-15T10:54:00.000Z	Khisanth	aaron_c	closest I can think of is creating a shortcut that opens a terminal with a particular profile
2011-04-15T10:55:00.000Z	Khisanth		but nothing like ctrl++ or ctrl+- in a browser
2011-04-15T10:57:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	ooo i figured it out
2011-04-15T10:57:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	ctrl+- to make it samller
2011-04-15T10:57:00.000Z	aaron_c	Khisanth	ctrl+shift++ to make it bigger
2011-04-15T10:59:00.000Z	Khisanth	aaron_c	heh I didn't try the -
