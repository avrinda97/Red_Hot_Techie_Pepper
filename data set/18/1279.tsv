2011-04-10T23:56:00.000Z	boairc		guys, i am trying to setup ubuntu with 3 monitors
2011-04-10T23:56:00.000Z	boairc		xinerama worked but i get no compiz
2011-04-10T23:57:00.000Z	boairc		been reading that xinerama is not compatible with compiz. is that so?
2011-04-10T23:57:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	a lot of cards can't do 3d support with xinerama which causes compiz problems
2011-04-10T23:58:00.000Z	boairc	ikonia	i have nvidia 8600 and 8400
2011-04-10T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	so ?
2011-04-10T23:59:00.000Z	boairc	ikonia	so can you point me in the right direction to get this setup?
2011-04-10T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	setup with what ?
2011-04-11T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	how many cards are you using ?
2011-04-11T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	ok, so you can't use twinview as that is limited to 1 card only
2011-04-11T00:01:00.000Z	boairc	ikonia	yes. i need for 3 monitors
2011-04-11T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	your options are limited, I'd suggest looking at the open source drivers,
2011-04-11T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	then your options are limited to almost zero
2011-04-11T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	if you want
2011-04-11T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	it is supported, just not with your cards
2011-04-11T00:05:00.000Z	boairc	ikonia	with what cards is it supported?
2011-04-11T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	boairc	talk to nvidia.com and ask them why their drivers don't support 3d acceleration split across mutliple cards
