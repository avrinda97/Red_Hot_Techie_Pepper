2005-07-14T08:46:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	 Well accually i was talking about the cost of money... They are very tight people when it comes to cost. lol.  Should have been how hard it was to convice them to purchase legal copies.
2005-07-14T08:46:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	uh, wine is free
2005-07-14T08:47:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	 Really?? Where? Last i heard it was a charge,.. Bugger you mean i have been looking at wrong place.
2005-07-14T08:47:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	uh, try apt-get install wine
2005-07-14T08:48:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	 www.winehq.com ? Oh bugger i have been as well.
2005-07-14T08:48:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	 Will take a look later.. about to go out for pool, and drinks with a mate
2005-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	try "apt-get install wine" for wine. there's also cedega, which is not free, but the source is available for you to compile yourself. google cvscedega for that
2005-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	& nalioth
2005-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	& nalioth : Grr.. Sorry.. Was going to say.. Thanks guys.. :D
2005-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	np :)
2005-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	just remember cvscedega. cedega is better for games
2005-07-14T08:51:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	wine is better for general apps
2005-07-14T08:51:00.000Z	Thazza	Danar	tar.. not that the office running myob will need to play games. so wine is probaly better
2005-07-14T08:51:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	doesn't hurt to get both
2005-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	Danar	Thazza	there's a script out there to download, compile & install cvscedega for you. look for that if you get it. wine should be in the repository
