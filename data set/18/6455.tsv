2008-09-06T09:05:00.000Z	Prose		if I can't get help with cups, anyone know some good gnome themes?
2008-09-06T09:06:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	whats the prob?
2008-09-06T09:07:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	cups says printer is online but asking cups for a page test doesn't get the printer started
2008-09-06T09:07:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	the problem is on a 7.1
2008-09-06T09:09:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	did you install PS drivers or just the defaukt stuff when setting it up?
2008-09-06T09:09:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	*default
2008-09-06T09:10:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	it's a mp130 but I installed the IP1500 drivers and they USED to work on the same computer it doens't work now
2008-09-06T09:11:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	so the drivers are good and obviously, I haven't changed anything I think might have disturbed CUPS (except I changed the static ip of the machine)
2008-09-06T09:12:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	yeah samba share...quite an important detail i did not mention
2008-09-06T09:12:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	but I am asking a test page via ssh
2008-09-06T09:13:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	 so since it's ssh, I figure I am basically using the terminal at the machine
2008-09-06T09:14:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	ok,,,, any more factors to consider and i start calculating my grand-kid's education expenses...lol, j/k
2008-09-06T09:15:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	nah, if you got your phd in impossible, it's all easy
2008-09-06T09:15:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	1st thing is to get the printer, attached box, on the right ip and network
2008-09-06T09:16:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	my phd is in "improbability"
2008-09-06T09:17:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	ok, well the printer is attached to a box and said box is on the network. said box also has samba file shares and they work perfectly as I am listening to music on those shares as I type
2008-09-06T09:18:00.000Z	Anacranom	Prose	but are there ip and settings as they were wne  u set up that printer on the remote box?
2008-09-06T09:19:00.000Z	Prose	Anacranom	well, no, ip settings have been changed
