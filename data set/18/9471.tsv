2009-02-26T07:34:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	cat /proc/mdstat
2009-02-26T07:36:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	would it tell me in there if there were errors or problems? it shows the setup, which is cool, but no the health
2009-02-26T07:37:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	are you on a desktop or server?
2009-02-26T07:39:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	mdstat would tell you if it was faulty, or if rebuilding anyway.
2009-02-26T07:41:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	should i be checking it everyday or something, I don't want to be left in the dark one day because 1 of the drives had failed 6 months ago
2009-02-26T07:43:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	i've got software raid systems over 6 years old now, just upgraded one of them to 320Gb without fuss
2009-02-26T07:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	I just troll the logs occasionally.  I assume you mean mirrored raid 1 ?
2009-02-26T07:44:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	i have raid5
2009-02-26T07:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	even better :-)
2009-02-26T07:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	how many drives
2009-02-26T07:45:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	so check the logs every once a while eh, that kinda suxks no :)
2009-02-26T07:45:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	4
2009-02-26T07:46:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	yep. You should check out the page that ubotu recommended. I've only used them on servers so far, so not on my desktop, i've heard of developments that may be of use, probably gparted for one.
2009-02-26T07:46:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	ok thanks for helping out, i'll check em out
2009-02-26T07:46:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	which version of ubuntu?
2009-02-26T07:47:00.000Z	baz	fluvvell	8.10
2009-02-26T07:47:00.000Z	fluvvell	baz	definitely look at gparted.
