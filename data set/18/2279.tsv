2010-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	abuayyoub		Hi, can someone help me please? I am having some strange problems. My computer ( sony vaio x64 Lucid ) has been bogging down lately like crazy. It becomes almost impossible to launch programs, for example it took almost 5 minutes to launch xchat and it keeps graying out every couple minutes. Also, the laptop gets so hot it's difficult to touch. A couple times I had to force reboot and when I did I got a disk error, it scanned the first ti
2010-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	abuayyoub		me locked up then finally finished the second... how can I find out what is wrong with my system?
2010-06-28T03:10:00.000Z	abuayyoub		it's acting like windows does when you get a really sick virus
2010-06-28T03:12:00.000Z	jbl_	abuayyoub	try to see if there are processes hogging the CPU/swapping a lot using the top or htop commands
2010-06-28T03:21:00.000Z	jbl_	abuayyoub	how do the %CPU and %MEM columns look like for the top 3 processes?
2010-06-28T03:23:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	 looks like cpu 3,3,1 and %mem 0.7, 0.8, 1.0
2010-06-28T03:24:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	the program i was talking about nzbget was something like 17.0 /18 which still dosent seem like a whole lot.
2010-06-28T03:26:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	 do you think its a hardware problem? the lappy is a work horse i download a whole lot but its still a good machine and under 6 months old. The fan seems like its blowing ok, and this problem dosent seem to happen all the time...
2010-06-28T03:28:00.000Z	jbl_	abuayyoub	I've had a similar problem and in my case, the gnome-do process was eating all my CPU and inducing the same symptoms you are seeing.
2010-06-28T03:29:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	 interesting. I also thought It could be something i installed I like to test out alot of beta stuff...
2010-06-28T03:31:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	is there a utilitly that can scan and tell me if I got a hardware/software problem?
2010-06-28T03:33:00.000Z	jbl_	abuayyoub	HW faults would tend to manifest themselves as system hang ups or random crashes. The symptoms you described make me think of a badly behaving piece of SW.
2010-06-28T03:34:00.000Z	jbl_	abuayyoub	but you can try to check your RAM using the "Memory test(memtest86+)" grub option when you start your computer.
2010-06-28T03:34:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	yea I think so as well. Like I said the system works fine, it gets a little hot when its working hard but. I am thinking it has to do something with the powermanager, I have had alot of problems with power mngt on this machine and lucid.
2010-06-28T03:35:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	 thats a good idea ill try that
2010-06-28T03:35:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	 what about HW scan? is there  a prog out there that can give me a good scanning?
2010-06-28T03:36:00.000Z	jbl_	abuayyoub	I'm afraid Google or somebody else in here might be more knowledgeable than me about that...
2010-06-28T03:36:00.000Z	abuayyoub	jbl_	 well thank you anyhow :)
