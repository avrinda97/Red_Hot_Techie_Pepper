2011-04-18T06:04:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	So.... how much time do you got. Thats gonna take a while to fix. I have no idea what you did... but i have a few ideas. Your better off on a re-install.
2011-04-18T06:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	this is the reinstall, it was supposed to fix this problem
2011-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	you formated your partitions before (or durrin) reinstall?
2011-04-18T06:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	only /, not /home
2011-04-18T06:08:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	Hmm. Id try both. For that matter, if your gonna bother with partitons... I would set up one extended partition with a 200mb /boot , a 10-20gb / and a * /home
2011-04-18T06:09:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	what should I throw in the /boot? livecd?
2011-04-18T06:11:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	yeah, I know how to do it, but I just don't understand how to use a /boot partition
2011-04-18T06:12:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	ah, ok. is there anything else useful I can put in there like a recovery iso or something?
2011-04-18T06:12:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	 Ubuntu mounts grub and its images there. It means, even if you screw your system, it wont be unbootable.
2011-04-18T06:13:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	Yes you can, now that you mention it, i myself keep a "puppy linux" in my /boot for recovery. Its a little more complex, because you have to install puppy, then reinstall ubuntu.... but it dose work.
2011-04-18T06:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	I normally separate / and /home, but I've never used /boot before, so I just wonder if there are any other neat little tricks I might do with it, so maybe I should make it larger?
2011-04-18T06:14:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	do you just put an iso in there or what?
2011-04-18T06:15:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	But thats geting into a complexity. For your average user, like yourself. Its mainly used for multiboot setups. Say if you have Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Windows, and you wanna switch out ubuntu for open suse, but ubuntu is where grub is... well you can just format your /home and / and install suse there, and your bootloader remains untouched as long as you dont overwrite it.
2011-04-18T06:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	ok, fair enough, I'll just keep it simple I guess
2011-04-18T06:20:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	I currently have a Windows 7, A fat32 shared for all my personal files and a ntfs for disk imges. Inside an extended i have ....
2011-04-18T06:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	NictraSavios	I suppose, but this machine is pretty dedicated to my TV, so that's not so important for me :P
2011-04-18T06:35:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	if this was arch linux i could telll you in 5 seconds.... but ubuntu dosent use rc.confg or mkiinit so not a clue.
2012-07-04T07:59:00.000Z	NictraSavios	gaelfx	lsmod | grep module_name
