2011-07-29T00:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3		where can i find a log indicating if my croons are running?
2011-07-29T00:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3		i can run the command fine manually but for some reason cron isn't running it or it isn't working
2011-07-29T00:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3		wanting to know where to look first
2011-07-29T00:33:00.000Z	Pici	Dreamer3	You should see an entry in /var/log/auth.log at least
2011-07-29T00:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Pici	what am i looking for exactly?
2011-07-29T00:37:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Pici	i'm trying to figure out if my croons are even running
2011-07-29T00:37:00.000Z	Pici	Dreamer3	just a moment
2011-07-29T00:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3		i'm confused because i've never known cron to be flakey before
2011-07-29T00:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3		i have no cron.log
2011-07-29T00:39:00.000Z	Pici	Dreamer3	Sorry, look in /var/log/syslog, you should have entries there for each cron task that was started.
2011-07-29T00:39:00.000Z	Pici	Dreamer3	Theres a lot of other stuff in there too, the lines you want will look like: Jul 28 06:55:01 hostname CRON[13755]: (root)
2011-07-29T00:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Pici	it's got like nothing useful
2011-07-29T00:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3		like the cron jobs aren't even running
2011-07-29T00:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3		i just see my edits to crontab
2011-07-29T00:41:00.000Z	Pici	Dreamer3	Do you have a newline at the end of the crontab?
2011-07-29T00:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Pici	no?
2011-07-29T00:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3		well on the last line yes
2011-07-29T00:41:00.000Z	Pici	Dreamer3	Add one.
