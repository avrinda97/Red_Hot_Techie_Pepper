2010-08-22T03:46:00.000Z	Subpoena		i think i might be having hardware issues, but im not sure, what would cause slow startups and even the BIOS menu to perform incredibly slowly?
2010-08-22T03:47:00.000Z	Oer	Subpoena	any usb device ?
2010-08-22T03:47:00.000Z	Subpoena		nothing at all, i even unplugged the HDD
2010-08-22T03:47:00.000Z	Subpoena		absolute bare bones and the problem persists
2010-08-22T03:48:00.000Z	Oer	Subpoena	run memtest86
2010-08-22T03:49:00.000Z	Oer		billy no
2010-08-22T03:49:00.000Z	Subpoena	Oer	um... is there a way to make a memtest CD on a mac?
2010-08-22T03:49:00.000Z	Subpoena		its my only current running machine
2010-08-22T03:49:00.000Z	Oer	Subpoena	any ubuntu distro has it
2010-08-22T03:50:00.000Z	Oer		it is an option in the installer, or in grub
2010-08-22T03:50:00.000Z	Subpoena		gotcha, on it
2010-08-22T03:50:00.000Z	Subpoena		thanks
2010-08-22T04:02:00.000Z	Oer		rename it
2010-08-22T04:02:00.000Z	Subpoena		so, um... while running memtest86, "Pass" should probably be rising above 0% at some point, yeah?
2010-08-22T04:02:00.000Z	Oer		yes Subpoena
2010-08-22T04:03:00.000Z	Subpoena	Oer	welp.
2010-08-22T04:14:00.000Z	Subpoena	Oer	the problem persists after i swap out the RAM. is it more likely that i have 2 sets of bad RAM, or that there's some other problem?
2010-08-22T04:15:00.000Z	Oer	Subpoena	i think too, some bad ram, experiment wich one by using 2 at the time
