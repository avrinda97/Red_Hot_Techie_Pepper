2007-01-22T12:14:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	not sure in kubuntu, but in ubuntu, you have to tell gnome-open what programs that should be opened with the diffrent extentions
2007-01-22T12:16:00.000Z	slyfox	LazyAngel	Are you talking about default applciations? Because Frifox is set to be my default applicaiton, but when in firefox I have downlaoded a file and want to open the destination directory, it does nto do so
2007-01-22T12:28:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	you do it in nautilus
2007-01-22T12:18:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	no, not default application like that. In firefox:  Edit-->Preferences--> Content --> (File Type) Manage
2007-01-22T12:20:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	sorry, that was wrong place. Not sure where you do it. I use Opera ;)
2007-01-22T12:20:00.000Z	slyfox	LazyAngel	But that is for mp3 files and flash and otehr
2007-01-22T12:21:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	there is probably a default application that tries to open all the files
2007-01-22T12:21:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	in gnome, that is "gnome-open"
2007-01-22T12:22:00.000Z	slyfox	LazyAngel	the problem is that firefox needs to communicate with knoqueror and tell it to open up the directory
2007-01-22T12:22:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	what happens when you try to open a file ?
2007-01-22T12:24:00.000Z	slyfox	LazyAngel	Nothing happens
2007-01-22T12:25:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	what happens when you tries to open the same file with the program that browses the folders and files on your system?
2007-01-22T12:25:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	if nothing happens there either, then you have to set it up in that program.
2007-01-22T12:26:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	if that works, then you have to figure out how you can set firefox default to open files in that file viewer. (which is called gnome-open in gnome)
2007-01-22T12:28:00.000Z	slyfox	LazyAngel	gnome-open in gnome where in Ubuntu do you do that? Is that ?
2007-01-22T12:30:00.000Z	slyfox	LazyAngel	I'll see if I can find somethig in Ubuntu forums
2007-01-22T12:31:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	ok. good luck
2007-01-22T12:32:00.000Z	LazyAngel	slyfox	you can also try #kubuntu or #kde Probably more than you that has this problem
