2009-07-29T04:26:00.000Z	spO		oh wait, do you guys use alt. bin or whatever?
2009-07-29T04:27:00.000Z	spO		hmm
2009-07-29T04:27:00.000Z	spO		i guess you can use newsbins and sabnzbd
2009-07-29T04:27:00.000Z	spO		seb, i was talking about what news reader to use with ubuntu
2009-07-29T04:28:00.000Z	spO		i want to use newsleecher in ubuntu
2009-07-29T04:28:00.000Z	spO		how do i do that
2009-07-29T04:28:00.000Z	spO		do you guys use wine or something?
2009-07-29T04:28:00.000Z	spO		dioes that work well?
2009-07-29T04:29:00.000Z	spO		i woulkd like to put together a package whereas i can run windows 7 ontop of ubuntu
2009-07-29T04:29:00.000Z	spO		dr_willis, virualbox is like wine, huh?
2009-07-29T04:29:00.000Z	LjL	spO	not really... wine simulates windows, virtualbox simulates a computer
2009-07-30T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	spO	uhm, yeah, more or less... at least in debian
2009-07-30T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	spO	well, set them all to "manual" in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-07-30T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	spO	then add an interface like "iface bridgename inet static" (or dhcp or what you have)
2009-07-30T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	spO	you need then the special parameter "bridge_ports ifname1 ifname2 ..."
2009-07-30T06:17:00.000Z	LjL	spO	this is a piece of my own interfaces: http://paste.ubuntu.com/236271/
2009-07-30T06:22:00.000Z	LjL	spO	are those two cards each connected to a different computer, or to the same other computer? (i think that's more like what he's asking)
2009-07-30T06:23:00.000Z	LjL	spO	*yes*, but that's not what he's asking :(
