2005-07-11T07:15:00.000Z	XhyldazhK		what should I have in my sources.list?
2005-07-11T07:16:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	not if you use backports...
2005-07-11T07:16:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	what is backports?
2005-07-11T07:17:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	(man that's hard to type): see http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/
2005-07-11T07:25:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	you're broken? I'm running Breezy and doing fine. If you have upgraded to breezy, take all hoary sources out of your list and add all the breezy sources
2005-07-11T07:26:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	which accel card do u have?
2005-07-11T07:26:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	video card?
2005-07-11T07:26:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	yes
2005-07-11T07:27:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	I run Breezy on two systems. One has a GeForce Ti4400, the other a Radeon 9000
2005-07-11T07:27:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	how did you managed the nvidia-glx conflict?
2005-07-11T07:28:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	i'm running without nvidia drivers right now
2005-07-11T07:28:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	hmm... I do 3d modelling on my box
2005-07-11T07:29:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	so you use the drivers directly from nvidia?
2005-07-11T07:30:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	yeah, Breezy isn't for you right now... no, I use the included drivers right now, which give me < 200 fps with my Ti4400 (3000 fps usually with the drivers)
2005-07-11T07:30:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	which included drivers?
2005-07-11T07:31:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	the "nv" driver as opposed to the "nvidia" driver
2005-07-11T07:33:00.000Z	seth_k	XhyldazhK	jasoncohen is 100% correct
2005-07-11T09:35:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	seth_k	i did it... I installed the nvidia driver from nvidia.com, and uninstalled nvidia-glx... until breezy gets fixed, that's the easier way
