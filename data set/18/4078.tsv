2011-07-08T00:19:00.000Z	dtcrshr		i cant create any partition
2011-07-08T00:19:00.000Z	dtcrshr		i need dual boot
2011-07-08T00:19:00.000Z	dtcrshr		some apps from my wife college only run in windows
2011-07-08T00:20:00.000Z	dtcrshr		hp just screwed me
2011-07-08T00:20:00.000Z	dtcrshr		and my windows partition is now 60gb only
2011-07-08T00:20:00.000Z	dtcrshr		lol
2011-07-08T00:20:00.000Z	dtcrshr		dunno if i can "move" them arround
2011-07-08T00:20:00.000Z	dtcrshr		or put in another extended container
2011-07-08T00:21:00.000Z	dtcrshr		ill close the installation and run gparted, lets see
2011-07-08T00:22:00.000Z	dtcrshr		on gparted when i choose to create a new one on the free unallocated space it claims that i need to create a new container, no more than 4 partitions
2011-07-08T00:23:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	You can only have 4 primary partition on a hdd
2011-07-08T00:25:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	You could do that, and delete a partition.  Or you can use an extended partition that lets you cheat and have more than 4
2011-07-08T00:25:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	An extended partition holds other partitions.  Any partition inside the extended partition does not count against your 4
2011-07-08T00:25:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	But your way is probably simpler and faster
2011-07-08T00:25:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	It will
2011-07-08T00:27:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	what?
2011-07-08T00:28:00.000Z	dtcrshr	edbian	ill try to not mess with this first two
2011-07-08T00:28:00.000Z	edbian	dtcrshr	good idea
