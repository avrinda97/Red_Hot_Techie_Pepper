2010-10-16T16:23:00.000Z	Muffie		anyone can help me with STA installation?
2010-10-16T16:24:00.000Z	Muffie		I thought, in 2010, ubuntu 10.10 wouldnt have a problem with a simple wireless card...
2010-10-16T16:25:00.000Z	Muffie		and then, mark shuttleworth is still wondering why Ubuntu is not widely used.
2010-10-16T16:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	what wifi chip ?
2010-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	if it is broadcom then blame boradcom. they do not let anyone distribute the firmware for their cards
2010-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	Muffie	erUSUL	Dont want to blame anyone. Just wanted to use Ubuntu
2010-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	if they just allow it the any linux distro will come with the firmware already installed
2010-10-16T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	so why you came here ranting about lack of support for common hardware ? go rant to a broadcom support forum
2010-10-16T16:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	if you are connected via wire then just « sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter »
2010-10-16T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	sorry in maverick is firmware-b43-installer the package name...
2010-10-16T16:33:00.000Z	Muffie	erUSUL	 It's already on the installation iso?
2010-10-16T16:33:00.000Z	Muffie	erUSUL	or do I need to take it from here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/
2010-10-16T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	problem is; it is far easier to install it while connected to internet. to avoid legal problems the package has to download the firmware file from internet during install.
2010-10-16T16:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	if you do it offline you need the packages ( both of them ) and download the firmware files. transfer everything to the system and run some commands... http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#device_firmware_installation
2010-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	Muffie	erUSUL	 thankx. I'll follow that link
2010-10-16T16:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Muffie	« sudo rkill list all »
2010-10-16T16:51:00.000Z	Muffie	erUSUL	 one sec. looking at bios
2010-10-16T16:53:00.000Z	Muffie	erUSUL	rkill?
