2005-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	iapx8088		do you know the difference btw /etc/init.d/ifupdown and ifupdown-clean/
2005-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	ifupdown-clean cleans the states out on reboot
2005-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	ifupdown keeps state of what interfaces are up and down
2005-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	obviously on reboot that doesnt apply anymore
2005-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	iapx8088	Lathiat	I saw that i can solve my hibernate problem restarting networking on resume. I want to try a better approach with ifupdown...what am I to restart in this case, the ifupdown or -clean?
2005-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	iapx8088	Lathiat	I would try to restart -clean, on resume.  Are you agree?
2005-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	no
2005-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	restart networking
2005-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	iapx8088	Lathiat	ok it's the way it's and it's working. Thanks
2005-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	your restarting ifupdown-clean?
2005-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	try restarting 'networking' instead if that doesnt work just use ifupdown-clean i guess
2005-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	iapx8088	Lathiat	presently I'm restarting networking and it works. Now I want to try something more complex
2005-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	no point trying something more complex
2005-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	restarting networkign is exactly what you want to do
2005-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	iapx8088	Lathiat	ok. It works :)
2005-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	Lathiat	iapx8088	restarting ifupdown-clean will just break things
2005-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	iapx8088	Lathiat	ok and thanks
