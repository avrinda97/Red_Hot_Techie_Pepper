2012-03-31T18:42:00.000Z	silentz0r		hello, i am trying to send an email using sendmail to my gmail account, but the email never gets there.
2012-03-31T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	gmail is probably blocking you as you are on a home connection
2012-03-31T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	most ISP's will block mail servers running on home connections
2012-03-31T18:43:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	how can I test if it's a sendmail error or a gmail error?
2012-03-31T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	it won't be a gmail error....if there was a gmail error, more people would be complaining that gmail is failing
2012-03-31T18:45:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	what I mean is, how can I know if gmail is blocking the email or if the email is not sent at all
2012-03-31T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	just look in the mailq if the mail is still there or not
2012-03-31T18:47:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	yep, both there. says Sender address rejected
2012-03-31T18:47:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	there you go then "rejected"
2012-03-31T18:47:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	so my ISP rejected them?
2012-03-31T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	"rejected" is the key workd
2012-03-31T18:48:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	well how can I know who rejected them then :)
2012-03-31T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	it's not your ISP - it's gmail, you are on a home connection ( I assume ) most mail services will reject home connections running mail servers
2012-03-31T18:49:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	huh, it actually went through
2012-03-31T18:49:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	it's not in the queue anymore
2012-03-31T18:50:00.000Z	silentz0r	ikonia	however it's not in my spam/inbox either :s
2012-03-31T18:50:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	so it's probably going to the bounce address you setup
2012-03-31T18:50:00.000Z	ikonia	silentz0r	as iot's being rejected
