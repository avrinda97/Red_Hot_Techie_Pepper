2009-05-10T10:46:00.000Z	Hystoriker		can anybody please help me with getting rid of some installed packages. I cannot remove two packages which were not installed correctly durign a previous installation process.
2009-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	Hystoriker		trying "sudo apt-get purge -f" did not help
2009-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	dpkg --configure -a
2009-05-10T10:48:00.000Z	Hystoriker	Kareeser	that doesn't help either. entering it doesnt give any information back, but the problem remains
2009-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	nothing at all? hrm.
2009-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	Hystoriker	Kareeser	no, nothing at all. i am working on kubuntu 9.04, if that may be of interest
2009-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	then dpkg believes the packages were installed fully. Have you tried uninstalling them with the purge function? apt-get purge [package]
2009-05-10T10:51:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	oooorrr... apt-get install --reinstall [package]
2009-05-10T10:53:00.000Z	Hystoriker	Kareeser	nothing of it works, both times the apt-get returns that no dir file was speciefied and thus it cannot go on
2009-05-10T10:53:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	can you paste the error into a pastebin so we can see it?
2009-05-10T10:54:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	brb, ask someone else for a while, sorry!!
2009-05-10T11:13:00.000Z	Hystoriker	Kareeser	sorry, i was away for a sec. look at http://paste.ubuntu.com/168156/, i have tried to translate my german output a little
2009-05-10T11:13:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	that's with apt-get purge?
2009-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	Hystoriker	Kareeser	yes, with "sudo apt-get purge -f"
2009-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	blaaah...
2009-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	I've suggested all I can think of, so at this point, try posting a message to ubuntu forums
2009-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	Hystoriker	Kareeser	thanks for your help
2009-05-10T11:16:00.000Z	Kareeser	Hystoriker	sorry I couldn't fix it :(
