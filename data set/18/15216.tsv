2005-05-02T05:27:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	hehe, yeah
2005-05-02T05:29:00.000Z	b2s	Edgan	the problem I have with gentoo isn't the compile times (well, the main problem) its that things break during upgrades
2005-05-02T05:30:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	Isn't that true with upgrades of anything other than maybe debian stable?
2005-05-02T05:31:00.000Z	b2s	Edgan	no.  the majority of my systems use rhel, and they don't break at all during upgrades.  of course, most of the packages are custom, but thankfully rpms are trivial to patch and rebuild
2005-05-02T05:32:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	yeah, I looked into ubuntu as a server. It seems to have as many packages in main as rhel.
2005-05-02T05:32:00.000Z	b2s	Edgan	I don't think it has as many packages as main... rhel is like 4 CDs, not 1.
2005-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	main isn't everything on the cd
2005-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	just the default install
2005-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	b2s	Edgan	ah, how big is main then?
2005-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	like 1300 packages
2005-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	where as rhel is like 1400-1500
2005-05-02T05:34:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	yeah, but I found myself adding lots of packages from repos under redhat
2005-05-02T05:34:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	ubuntu has postfix, apache2, php, dovecot, cyrus-imapd, etc in main
2005-05-02T05:35:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	packages.ubuntu.com
2005-05-02T05:35:00.000Z	b2s	Edgan	the only packages I added under rhel were courier-mta and pure-ftpd, both of which are in universe on ubuntu
2005-05-02T05:36:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	what other services do you use in redhat? That you would want in ubuntu main?
2005-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	b2s	Edgan	I just installed my laptop with ubuntu about 3 days ago, so I haven't had much time to really plan out that sort of thing.
2005-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	Edgan	b2s	I installed it in my laptop the other day. It is nice. It didn't go so well on a junk desktop I tried it on.
