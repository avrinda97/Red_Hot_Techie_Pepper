2005-03-31T15:53:00.000Z	returnthis		are there any docs on cups for ubuntu? I can't find any one the site
2005-03-31T15:55:00.000Z	returnthis		does anyone know how to reenable cups web interface?
2005-03-31T15:56:00.000Z	returnthis		is there a user oriented ubuntu channel?
2005-03-31T15:58:00.000Z	returnthis		so I can't do anything useful witht that interface
2005-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	returnthis		tried several things, including lppasswd
2005-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	returnthis		I can not get it to login at all
2005-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	returnthis		I set the root passwd just to use that, still did not work
2005-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	returnthis		I then tried lppasswd, still did not work
2005-03-31T16:00:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	are you on the right port # for the cups server?
2005-03-31T16:02:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	I haven't run cups on anything but gentoo in a while; seems to me there's a step to allow a user to admin (I do know I login/password as unprivileged user).  Maybe add that user to some /etc/group?
2005-03-31T16:03:00.000Z	returnthis	nis	I even went so far as loggin in as root
2005-03-31T16:04:00.000Z	returnthis	nis	it looks like ubuntu has handicapped cups for security reasons.... with no docs on how to unhandicap it
2005-03-31T16:05:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	have you been able to use cups on other platforms okay?
2005-03-31T16:05:00.000Z	returnthis	nis	this is the first time I have used a printer in 15yrs of computers
2005-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	haha (15 yrs remark).  Know the feeling.  cups never worked for me .. then one day it did.
2005-03-31T16:08:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	I thought ubuntu was supposed to 'just work' hehe.
2005-03-31T16:26:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	good luck.
2005-03-31T16:27:00.000Z	nis	returnthis	Aw, c'mon. Enjoy the hack.
