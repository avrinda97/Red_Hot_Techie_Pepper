2009-05-27T10:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	No, fragmentation will not neccisarily increase with time with ext3
2009-05-27T10:12:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	describe a scenario in which fragmentation decreases
2009-05-27T10:30:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	according to shake, run on my downloads directory (about 100 files, average size 200MB), the average file has 1100 fragments.  That seems sufficiently much to start worrying about defraging
2009-05-27T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	What does filefrag report?
2009-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	random sampling, without filenames: 3217 extents found, perfection would be 3 extents; 1314 extents found, perfection would be 3 extents; 1817 extents found, perfection would be 3 extents; 1083 extents found, perfection would be 3 extents; 1883 extents found, perfection would be 3 extents
2009-05-27T10:38:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	I am not sure what "percentage" might be assigned to a 300MB file with 3000 fragments, but if that is less than 1% then I think that measurement is misleading
2009-05-27T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	I did not make the comment about 1% :)
2009-05-27T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	How much free space do you have?
2009-05-27T10:44:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	between 1 and 100GB, out of 500GB total
2009-05-27T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	Something is seriously wrong, because you shouldn't be seeing fragmentation like that
2009-05-27T10:46:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	as I said... Create large files until the drive is full.  Delete half the files at semi-random.  Create small files until the drive is 75% full.  Repeat on a regular basis for years.  Presto, significantly greater than 1% fragmentation.
2009-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	i am aware that my usage pattern (filling the drive up before cleaning it out, while continuing to create small and large files) is very fragmentation-inducing
2009-05-27T10:48:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	what I *should* do is stop using the same partition for bittorrent and ~, and stop letting the bittorrent partition fill to 99.8% capacity before cleaning it out.
2009-05-27T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	Ok, did you have a question?
2011-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	sparr	Jordan_U	thanks. hopefully the new UI will be ready in another few versions
2012-02-22T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	jockey-kde
2012-02-22T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	Or jockey-gtk, if you really want the GNOME version.
2012-02-22T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sparr	You're welcome.
