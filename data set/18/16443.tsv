2010-02-05T07:42:00.000Z	Geothermal		Sorry. My bad. Um, where does electricsheep install into? I know it's supposed to be into my home folder, but I can't find it. I've downloaded it and installed it with apt-get, but it won't download a sheep. I got a sheep pack but I don't know where to extract it to.
2010-02-05T07:43:00.000Z	Geothermal		I did. No results
2010-02-05T07:44:00.000Z	Geothermal		It is installed cuz if I run it from the CLI it tries to download a sheep, but won't connect to the network
2010-02-05T07:44:00.000Z	Geothermal		I just apt-get it a couple minutes ago too.
2010-02-05T07:44:00.000Z	Geothermal		electricsheep
2010-02-05T07:44:00.000Z	Geothermal		The same thine
2010-02-05T07:45:00.000Z	Geothermal		In the terminal?
2010-02-05T07:45:00.000Z	Geothermal		Yeah, that worked. But I have a multitude of files.
2010-02-05T07:47:00.000Z	Geothermal		Same results. Which directory would contain the sheep files?
2010-02-05T07:47:00.000Z	Geothermal		It's a search.
2010-02-05T07:47:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	the p2p-ness of electric sheep only goes while the screensaver is running
2010-02-05T07:48:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	and it takes a long time. probably best to just download a sheep-pack yourself and put it in ~/.sheep
2010-02-05T07:48:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	if you set electric sheep as your screensaver and have no sheep yet, itll jsut be solid black until however many days/weeks it takes to get sheep
2010-02-05T07:48:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	unpack the sheep pack into ~/.sheep
2010-02-05T07:49:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	~ means your home directory
2010-02-05T07:49:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	. means its hidden
2010-02-05T07:49:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	so turn on hidden files in your file browser (in the view menu)
2010-02-05T07:50:00.000Z	maco	Geothermal	it might not exist yet. in that case, make a new folder named ".sheep" in your home directory
