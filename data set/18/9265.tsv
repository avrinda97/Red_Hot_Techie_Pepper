2007-04-23T07:59:00.000Z	Parmenion		hey guys ... i've got a wee problem with my eth1, my wireless card
2007-04-23T08:00:00.000Z	Parmenion		ive already set up ndiswrapper to use the windows driver
2007-04-23T08:00:00.000Z	Parmenion		it kinda works
2007-04-23T08:00:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	you need ndiswrapper?
2007-04-23T08:00:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	yeah
2007-04-23T08:01:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	does your driver support wpa2 ?
2007-04-23T08:02:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	i would believe so ...
2007-04-23T08:02:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	i would check the docs/howto and the manufacturer's site
2007-04-23T08:03:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	i did ... ive come to the point im willing to just turn off all security and run free :P
2007-04-23T08:03:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	yeah -- its also possible your router is not complaint to specs
2007-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	its a linksys WRT54G
2007-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	i have had issues with other firmwares though
2007-04-23T08:05:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	ok, ill go tweak around with the /etc/network/interfaces a bit more
2007-04-23T08:05:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	network manager is what you want
2007-04-23T08:06:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	ok, thanks =)
2007-04-23T08:08:00.000Z	Parmenion	khermans	is there a way to just restart eth1 ?
2007-04-23T08:08:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	ifconfig eth1 down
2007-04-23T08:08:00.000Z	khermans	Parmenion	then ifconfig eth1 up; dhclient eth1
