2010-09-18T23:52:00.000Z	rbastic		Anyone: How do I install a .deb package? I want to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu
2010-09-18T23:53:00.000Z	rbastic		nodnod, I am going to try the latest virtualbox from the site for AMD64 to see if that helps
2010-09-18T23:53:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	why?
2010-09-18T23:54:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	sorry not you
2010-09-18T23:54:00.000Z	rbastic	Katsumi32	haha k
2010-09-19T00:20:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	install vbox get xp iso and load it thats all
2010-09-19T00:24:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	did you make this iso yourself ? i had the same issue use dirrerent software to burn iso
2010-09-19T00:25:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	if u hvae win installation disk u can easy make iso
2010-09-19T00:25:00.000Z	rbastic	Katsumi32	I see
2010-09-19T00:25:00.000Z	rbastic	Katsumi32	Regardless VirtualBox doesn't seem to like booting off of the Microsoft-provided ISO file.
2010-09-19T00:27:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	it worked very well for my everything depends what iso u have got i used fist some software to make iso out of my win installation cd than booted ubuntu and it didnt work at all vbox didnt recognisse it than someone told me about other software i burned it again and it worked i tested vbox with win7 and xp both were working
2010-09-19T00:28:00.000Z	rbastic	Katsumi32	the ISO file works when using VIrtualBox on Windows. Can't see a reason this should make a difference on Ubuntu. It's the same machine. Maybe a different version of VirtualBox though.
2010-09-19T00:28:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	if it work under win it will under ubuntu what the error youre getting ?
2010-09-19T00:29:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	just tell me what the vbox says when youre trying to play xp ?
2010-09-19T00:30:00.000Z	rbastic	Katsumi32	I set the media source to the ISO file in the New Virtual Machine wizard
2010-09-19T00:31:00.000Z	rbastic	Katsumi32	then it says FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted.
2010-09-19T00:32:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	so it isnt bootable if it says no botable than it isnt bootable u may try to get newer vvbox from the web i have got the latest one in synaptic vbox is bit old
2010-09-19T00:33:00.000Z	Katsumi32	rbastic	if you have any questions about vbox join #vbox
