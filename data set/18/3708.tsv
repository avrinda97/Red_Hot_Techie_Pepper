2012-05-19T11:56:00.000Z	bouma		there is some issue with the chroot in the livecd, from what i can tell it is an intermitent bug, but it surprising it would exisit with 1204
2012-05-19T11:58:00.000Z	bouma		i dont have a separate boot partition
2012-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	bouma		i almost want to just reinstall over the top of the current install
2012-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	bouma		will this break things?
2012-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	bouma		there isnt much on /home
2012-05-19T12:00:00.000Z	alankila	bouma	your old fs will be formatted over most likely
2012-05-19T12:03:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	thats the idea
2012-05-19T12:04:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	i cant figure out how to just get grub-install /dev/sda to run
2012-05-19T12:04:00.000Z	alankila	bouma	the sda is your harddisk? has filesystems on it? one of them contains /boot?
2012-05-19T12:05:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	there is no boot, just one linux partition sda1, and sd2 is the win7 boot partition, sd3 win7system
2012-05-19T12:06:00.000Z	alankila	bouma	right so /dev/sda1 contains the directory called /boot/grub then.
2012-05-19T12:06:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	yes
2012-05-19T12:07:00.000Z	alankila	bouma	so mount it, chroot to it, then mount /sys, /proc and /dev, then try grub-install
2012-05-19T12:07:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	sigh i thought i could just run grub-install /dev/sda from the term on a livecd
2012-05-19T12:08:00.000Z	alankila	bouma	not sure if that should work. It is conceivable it could.
2012-05-19T12:09:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	really... im sure ive used it before i thought it just scanned the drive and regenerated a whole boot menu with every detected kernel, rescue modes and entries for all detected operating systems
2012-05-19T12:09:00.000Z	alankila	bouma	that is update-grub
2012-05-19T12:10:00.000Z	bouma	alankila	ok, well update-grub /dev/sda doesnt work either it gives, /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?).
