2008-07-05T00:15:00.000Z	Subrock		Hiya, can someone tell me how to watch youtube videos nicely with utumbu, this system has terrible lag and picture freezes
2008-07-05T00:15:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	flash works fine in ubuntu installs, and youtube playback is fine.  You'll have to give us some more details if you want us to help you isolate the problem.
2008-07-05T00:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	again, I can't help you unless you give me something to work with
2008-07-05T00:21:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	what video card are you using
2008-07-05T00:25:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	and have you installed correct drivers for it (probably from the restricted drivers manager)
2008-07-05T00:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	open up a terminal and type "glxinfo | grep -i direct"
2008-07-05T00:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	ok, so your video card id sest up correctly
2008-07-05T00:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	if you turn off desktop effects, do you still get the same general lagginess?
2008-07-05T00:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	system | appearance i think
2008-07-05T00:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	i dunno
2008-07-05T00:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	open up a terminal and type top
2008-07-05T00:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	and identify the process that is running out of control
2008-07-05T00:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	what elsde
2008-07-05T00:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	what happens if you close firefox?
2008-07-05T00:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	does the machine behave correctly for the most part?
2008-07-05T00:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	maybe the out of the box ubuntu install is like that, but you can configure it to be as slim as you want.  Ubuntu is built on top of a base system that I've had running on a 486 with 4mb ram
2008-07-05T00:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	it x-chat is using that much cpu, it's probably having a bad interaction with something.  Have you tried turning off desktop effects?
2008-07-05T00:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Subrock	Xorg is the process responsible for your gui
