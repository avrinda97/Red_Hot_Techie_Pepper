2008-06-28T12:07:00.000Z	fma243		i am not getting much support here
2008-06-28T12:07:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 one normally makes at least 2 partitions, one for / and one for swap.
2008-06-28T12:09:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 depending on how the rest of the hd is laid out. You may need to make a extended partition for the whole 5gb, then 2 logicals inside it. one of 4.5 gb for / and a .5gb for swap.
2008-06-28T12:09:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 i normally free up some space and make it 'unallocated' and let the ubuntu installer auto partition inside the unallocated space.
2008-06-28T15:32:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 use the partion manager tools to delete the install/partitions you dont want.. (be carefull) :)
2008-06-28T15:32:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 then remove any extra entries in the grub menu.lst file.
2008-06-28T15:33:00.000Z	fma243	dr_Willis	where is the grub menu.ist file
2008-06-28T15:45:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 you mean 'delete' the ntfs and remake it as ext3? or you want to Save the data on it?
2008-06-28T15:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	  make sure its unmounted. run gpated and delete the partition.. 'supporting ntfs' has nothng to do with it.
2008-06-28T15:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 then after its deleted remake a new partition, of type ext3
2008-06-28T15:54:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 well you must run gparted as root. and the partition must not be in use/mounted
2008-06-28T15:55:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 you mean as a user? well a user has no permissions to things thats not owned by him. Make a directyory on the hd. and as root, chown it to be owned by the user in question. is one way
2008-06-29T19:43:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 if its a windows ntfs filesystem. give it a proper name under windows.
2008-06-29T19:45:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 use tune2fs to label the ext3's and windows to name the fat32's there may be a way to name them/label them under linux. but  i dont rember how
2008-06-29T19:45:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 the label changes wont take affect till a reboot i belive also..
2008-06-29T19:50:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 that can be done with gnome. theres some settings to show drive icons on the desktop
2008-06-29T19:51:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 not really. I dont want icons on the desktop.. its clutter
2008-06-29T19:52:00.000Z	dr_Willis	fma243	 i always have file managers open. and i got them in my bookmarks..
