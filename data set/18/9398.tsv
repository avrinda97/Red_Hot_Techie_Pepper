2007-06-11T09:15:00.000Z	HorizonXP		hey guys that were help me, i found it, it was in .vmware
2007-06-11T09:16:00.000Z	HorizonXP		i dont' think i need those VMs anymore so yeah, off they go!
2007-06-11T09:17:00.000Z	HorizonXP		thanks guys!
2007-06-11T09:19:00.000Z	HorizonXP		hey, another question guys
2007-06-11T09:19:00.000Z	HorizonXP		Core 2 Duo: use AMD64, or i386?
2007-06-11T09:20:00.000Z	Toma-	HorizonXP	i386
2007-06-11T09:20:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	Why? 64bit support's not that great?
2007-06-11T09:20:00.000Z	Toma-	HorizonXP	no, 64bit optimizations are not used
2007-06-11T09:21:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	Like, no apps utilize it? So I wouldn't see a speed up?
2007-06-11T09:22:00.000Z	Toma-	HorizonXP	nope. also, 64bit is only really going to speed up ram thats over like 4 gigs
2007-06-11T09:22:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	wth? so what's the point of 64-bit? I'm pretty sure it's not just due to ram
2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	and 64bit allows the use of more registers in the cpu (almost double) so if an app was recompiled for 64bit, it should speed it up right?
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	I don't think ur right
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	Toma-	HorizonXP	no. no apps use the 64bit registers yet
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	if they're recompiled using the 64bit compiler, they do
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	Toma-	HorizonXP	ive got a 386 and a 64bit install on my 64bit amd and there is absolutely no speed difference
2007-06-11T09:25:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	The compiler will use the extra registers instead of accessing your RAM
2007-06-11T09:25:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Toma-	I find that hard to believe.. i was asking which i should use because I was worried about 32bit app support
