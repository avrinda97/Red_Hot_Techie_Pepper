2004-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	tseng	phlaegel	yes?
2004-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	phlaegel	tseng	any chance of packaging mono.posix? tomboy in cvs uses it...
2004-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	tseng	phlaegel	where is the homepage?
2004-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	phlaegel	tseng	not sure... haven't been able to find a lot of info. there's this: http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/MonoPosix
2004-10-11T09:53:00.000Z	phlaegel	tseng	it sounds like it's something I'd expect to be included with mono, but...
2004-10-11T09:55:00.000Z	tseng	phlaegel	^ joem is the man.
2004-10-11T09:56:00.000Z	phlaegel	tseng	that's what I expected... so why doesn't tomboy compile anymore? it complains about missing mono.posix.
2004-10-11T09:56:00.000Z	tseng	phlaegel	do you have the -dev libs?
2004-10-11T09:57:00.000Z	phlaegel	tseng	libmono-dev?
2004-10-11T09:57:00.000Z	tseng	phlaegel	make sure you have them all
2004-10-11T09:58:00.000Z	phlaegel	tseng	I have everything except mono-gac, mono-jay, mono-mint
2004-10-11T09:59:00.000Z	tseng	phlaegel	huh.
