2009-06-15T22:33:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	i configure my router and my ubuntu connection without any problem... the problem is that just... doesnt work. keep asking me about keys, even if i type them correctly
2009-06-15T22:34:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	Are you using DHCP or Static I{ fpr te local machine?
2009-06-15T22:35:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	dhcp
2009-06-15T22:35:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	Are you using DHCP or Static IP for the local machine?*
2009-06-15T22:35:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	When I had this problem last time, the dhcp was getting a conflicting address... hmm wait one second. I think I might know what's wrong. This is Jaunty, correct?
2009-06-15T22:36:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	yes it's jaunty ... but im pretty sure its not ip-conflict, because there are only 2 machines in this network, and one of them has static ip
2009-06-15T22:37:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	Ok, it's probably routing rules then. Try this: After configing the router and ubuntu to connect, run these commends:
2009-06-15T22:39:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	sudo iptables -F; sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT; sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT; sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
2009-06-15T22:39:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	That command should delete any conflicting rule and allow access to your router
2009-06-15T22:40:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	Also, if you want to be secure, use WPA without TKIP and a very long and complicated key. WEP is almost useless. SOmeone could hack it in under 5 minutes
2009-06-15T22:41:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	i know about that... but its still better than unencrypted network
2009-06-15T22:42:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	these command didnt help ;/ im gonna browse these threads you gave me
2009-06-15T22:42:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	I didn't give you any threads. the other thing I had to do to connect was fakeauth to the router. But that requires aircrack-ng to be installed
2009-06-15T22:43:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	apparently, i've ot that package ;) but it doesnt want to cooperate with my card
2009-06-15T22:44:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	Well, I might be able to help you but we'd need to go to a more appropriate channel like #madwifi or #aircrack-ng
2009-06-15T22:45:00.000Z	bigos	soreau	 which one, then?
2009-06-15T22:45:00.000Z	soreau	bigos	Meet me in #aircrack-ng
