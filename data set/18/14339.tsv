2009-11-27T02:32:00.000Z	munley		Zykotick9 AMorozow : you don't understanbd, I need to copy files between Mac and Ubuntu
2009-11-27T02:32:00.000Z	munley		Then why woulndn't ubuntu let me?
2009-11-27T02:33:00.000Z	munley		I cannot use FAT32, because a 4.2GB file cannot be save on my 16GB USB stick
2009-11-27T02:33:00.000Z	munley		Amorozov
2009-11-27T02:34:00.000Z	munley		Zykotick9 AMorozow : the problem is, the partition ways of Ubuntu is not standard
2009-11-27T02:34:00.000Z	munley		I am so fed up with this
2009-11-27T02:36:00.000Z	munley		as I said, computer is supposed to help people, not blocking people
2009-11-27T02:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	If you want to copy files between both systems, you need a filesystem that both support.
2009-11-27T02:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	or you can copy over the network
2009-11-27T02:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	if you want to use a USB drive, format it as NTFS
2009-11-27T02:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	that's supported by both Ubuntu and OS X (via NTFS-3g)
2009-11-27T02:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	that doesn't matter. the only other option is FAT32
2009-11-27T02:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	you don't need windows.
2009-11-27T02:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	install ntfsprogs and you will be able to create ntfs filesystems
2009-11-27T02:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	munley	which is why you need to use NTFS! :P
