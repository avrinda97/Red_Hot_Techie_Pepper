2009-01-15T03:03:00.000Z	Some_ux		I can't find documentation on how to patch packages ?
2009-01-15T03:04:00.000Z	Some_ux		How do I apply something which is in http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy-updates/ ?
2009-01-15T03:05:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	1) sudo apt-get update
2009-01-15T03:05:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	2) sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-01-15T03:05:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	3) sudo apt-get install <package name>
2009-01-15T03:08:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	compare. Before upgrading do 'sudo apt-get show dnsmasq'
2009-01-15T03:12:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	aah i see what u mean. have u tried looking for a .deb of the update?
2009-01-15T03:15:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	u won't see the latest in there. only the stablest
2009-01-15T03:16:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	there is no "just released" stuff in the packages
2009-01-15T03:16:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	in the repository, i mean
2009-01-15T03:16:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	try the dnsmasq site?
2009-01-15T03:21:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	i should think so
2009-01-15T03:23:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	yeah it a subdomain
2009-01-15T03:24:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	yes u would 'wget -c http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/d/dnsmasq/dnsmasq-base_2.41-2ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb
2009-01-15T03:25:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	then dpkg -i http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/d/dnsmasq/dnsmasq-base_2.41-2ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb
2009-01-15T03:25:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	dpkg -i dnsmasq-base_2.41-2ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb
2009-01-15T03:26:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	HOWEVER i don't know if this would update your current dnsmasq
2009-01-15T03:26:00.000Z	dayo__	Some_ux	maybe someone in here can shed light on this?
