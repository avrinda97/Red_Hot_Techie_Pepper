2008-09-29T02:52:00.000Z	NewtoU		Hey KenBW, i got another question.  got a sec?
2008-09-29T02:52:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	yup
2008-09-29T02:53:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	shoot
2008-09-29T02:53:00.000Z	NewtoU	KenBW	ok, what is the fast/easy way to get my laptop HD to be bootable with CD drivers so i can get to this new UbuntU CD?
2008-09-29T02:54:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	you mean it wont boot from CD?
2008-09-29T02:54:00.000Z	NewtoU	KenBW	it will not
2008-09-29T02:54:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	not sure how being old affects things, but your BIOS is probably the best place to tlook
2008-09-29T02:55:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	the boot sequence will probably be set to Floppy, then Hard Drive. then CD
2008-09-29T02:56:00.000Z	NewtoU	KenBW	the Bios is the latest and very old.  I need to format the drive with something like a DOS that has universal CD drivers.  I cannot use the floppy AND the CD at the same time
2008-09-29T02:57:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	i don't really know alot about this, but you could try looking at the setup
2008-09-29T02:57:00.000Z	NewtoU	KenBW	I thought bootdisk.org but thought you guys might have an idea
2008-09-29T03:01:00.000Z	KenBW	NewtoU	hows it going
2008-09-29T03:02:00.000Z	NewtoU	KenBW	I gonna try bootdisks.org.  I'll be back if it dont work.
2008-09-29T03:02:00.000Z	NewtoU	KenBW	Thanks again
