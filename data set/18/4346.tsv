2010-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	lvh		Hello.
2010-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	lvh		My Lucid install refuses to boot. I'm being affected by this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/+bug/532984
2010-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	indus	lvh	just remove the word splash from boot menu by pressing f6
2010-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	lvh	indus	When exactly? just mash f6 as its boots?
2010-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	indus	lvh	yeh
2010-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	indus	lvh	look for the word splash
2010-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	indus	lvh	dont change anything else
2010-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	indus	lvh	if that works, then after boot , you can permanently remove the splash by editing grub
2010-06-28T14:38:00.000Z	lvh	indus	It would appear my usb disk is dying. How unfortunate.
2010-06-28T14:38:00.000Z	lvh	indus	(I'm reasonably proficient; I just never used splash screens and didn't know about F6
2010-06-28T14:38:00.000Z	lvh	indus	Thanks :)
2010-06-28T14:40:00.000Z	indus	lvh	so booting now ?
2010-06-28T14:40:00.000Z	lvh	indus	Yep, it works. Thanks.
2010-06-28T14:40:00.000Z	lvh	indus	Appears to be an USB problem, I'll plug them out one by one and retry until it goes away.
2010-06-28T14:40:00.000Z	indus	lvh	usb hmm
2010-06-28T14:41:00.000Z	indus	lvh	how ? i thought it s a splash problem
2010-06-28T14:41:00.000Z	lvh	indus	(I know about /etc/default/grub from Debian, this is my girlfriends' computer)
2010-06-28T14:41:00.000Z	lvh	indus	Well, hardly; like in that bug I linked the splash was just masking the actual problem :)
