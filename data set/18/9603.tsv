2008-11-18T13:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	andre_pl	does /proc/acpi exist?
2008-11-18T13:24:00.000Z	andre_pl	Frogzoo	yep

2008-11-18T13:27:00.000Z	andre_pl	Frogzoo	I have no "Power" under sys->prefs
2008-11-18T13:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	andre_pl	no "power management"?
2008-11-18T13:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	andre_pl	locate gnome-power-preferences?
2008-11-18T13:33:00.000Z	andre_pl	Frogzoo	its in /usr/bin
2008-11-18T13:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	andre_pl	but no /usr/share/applications/gnome-power-preferences.desktop ?
2008-11-18T13:35:00.000Z	andre_pl	Frogzoo	actually... it looks like reinstalling gnome-power-manager fixed it
2008-11-18T13:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	andre_pl	heh - weird
