2005-05-24T14:34:00.000Z	nakata		ssh is not interpreting a damn thing
2005-05-24T14:35:00.000Z	nakata		it's just a raw pipe, encrypting, possibly compressing slightly, and authenticating an X11 protocol spew to/from a server/client.  it's not a protocol, and the bandwidth difference from raw X11 is next to nothing as makes no odds.
2005-05-24T14:35:00.000Z	nakata		a tunnel.
2005-05-24T14:36:00.000Z	nakata		hell, cable's slow
2005-05-24T14:37:00.000Z	nakata		is it a vpn connection to my desktop or what
2005-05-24T14:37:00.000Z	nakata		ssh can do any arbitrary forwards you want
2005-05-24T14:38:00.000Z	nakata		bridging a single port between the two and setting a DISPLAY envvar isn't really rocket science
2005-05-24T14:38:00.000Z	nakata		nor does it really justify calling it a 'feature' of ssh, since it's only there for convenience
2005-05-24T14:39:00.000Z	nakata		(port forwarding accomplishes the same damn thing)
2005-05-24T14:40:00.000Z	nakata		used gnome for years, too
2005-05-24T14:41:00.000Z	lotusleaf	nakata	what made you switch to KDE? :)
2005-05-24T14:41:00.000Z	nakata	lotusleaf	gnome stripping out it's usability, the slowness, the gray...
2005-05-24T14:43:00.000Z	lotusleaf	nakata	damn, and this coming from a long time gnome user? So why did I switch? LOL. :-P Are you suing the kde ubuntu now or did you install kde using ubuntu?
2005-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	nakata	lotusleaf	i installed ubuntu, then kubuntu-desktop
2005-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	nakata	lotusleaf	i just fell in love with KDE, the polished integration, the sexy messaging, etcetera
2005-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	lotusleaf	nakata	ah. So kde *can* be installed in ubuntu without problems then? :)
2005-05-24T14:45:00.000Z	nakata	lotusleaf	yes BUT
2005-05-24T14:45:00.000Z	lotusleaf	nakata	yeah, I liked KDE for the longest time too, but I'm finding gnome to be pretty nice too
