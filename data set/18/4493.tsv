2009-08-21T05:39:00.000Z	Ingsoc		ok I installed ubuntu on a friends laptop as a dual boot system, and when I did i let ubuntu take up as much space as it wanted (it was a brand new laptop with a fresh windows vista install on it) now I want to shrink the ubuntu partition and expand the windows partition to give her more room in windows. Can gparted do this without nuking everything?
2009-08-21T05:40:00.000Z	Ingsoc		cool ty guys
2009-08-21T05:41:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Ingsoc	gparted can theoretically resize file systems without data loss, in practice i don't trust it ;p
2009-08-21T05:41:00.000Z	Ingsoc	DigitalKiwi	have you had problems in the past?
2009-08-21T05:42:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Ingsoc	yes
2009-08-21T05:43:00.000Z	Ingsoc	DigitalKiwi	resizing an existing windows partition?
2009-08-21T05:43:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		resizing any partition
2009-08-21T05:43:00.000Z	Ingsoc	DigitalKiwi	How long ago? What version of gparted?
2009-08-21T05:44:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Ingsoc	i don't recall
2009-08-21T05:45:00.000Z	Ingsoc	DigitalKiwi	Are we talking years ago or recently?
2009-08-21T05:45:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		the makers themselves say to backup all data ;p
2009-08-21T05:45:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		umm, a few months with whatever the newest gparted was at the time
2009-08-21T05:47:00.000Z	Ingsoc		hmm now I am nervous
2009-08-21T05:48:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Ingsoc	it's not that it always fails, or that it doesn't work, it's just don't do it on stuff you care a lot about, new installs means you shouldn't have too many problems in both a performing the actions and b recovering if they fail
2009-08-21T05:50:00.000Z	Ingsoc	DigitalKiwi	Yeah but I did the install about 1 year ago. I guess I'll have to clean out my thimb drive
2009-08-21T05:50:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		oh i thought you said fresh installs >.>
2009-08-21T05:50:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		woot arch
2009-08-21T05:50:00.000Z	Ingsoc	DigitalKiwi	Well it was a fresh install when I did it. ;)
