2010-12-27T05:13:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		Hey guys, trying to install Ubuntu on this computer, but when I boot the Ubuntu 10.10 CD I just made, it just takes me to a terminal that says something like "Unable to find a live image to boot to"
2010-12-27T05:13:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	try to make another CD and if fails download a new copy
2010-12-27T05:15:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	I have a limited number of CDs. You think the image corrupted somewhere?
2010-12-27T07:53:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	still the same problem?
2010-12-27T07:53:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	ye
2010-12-27T07:57:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	do what?
2010-12-27T07:57:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	I did. I got the exact same problem with it
2010-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	do you want to use windows and ubuntu?
2010-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	I also checked the hash of the iso, and it's correct
2010-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	do you want to use windows and ubuntu?
2010-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	I don't care. I'd be fine with just ubuntu
2010-12-27T08:05:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	go to this and do it. http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Initramfs#Basics
2010-12-27T08:09:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	what is this, I don't even... I just want to boot into livecd, not create my own initramfs or whatever this is. Also, the initramfs does say it has BusyBox
2010-12-27T08:12:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	initramfs is going to do what the kernel can't do like showing up boot screen and mounting specified root partition
2010-12-27T08:13:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	initramfs is going to do what the kernel can't do like showing up boot screen and mounting specified root partition
2010-12-27T08:14:00.000Z	AnggaDj98	IsmAvatar	so i guess creating a live file system is the job of initramfs rite?
2010-12-27T08:15:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	I don't know what the job of the initramfs is. I'm a java programmer trying to get ubuntu running, this stuff confuses me >_<
2010-12-27T08:17:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	AnggaDj98	ok, I'll try. And Java is just what I'm known best for. I know a dozen others too.
