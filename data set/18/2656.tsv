2010-07-29T10:28:00.000Z	picard1421		is there anyway to only have a GUI login? nothing else GUI?
2010-07-29T10:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	why not just use cli login to then stay at cli. it'd be a smoother ride
2010-07-29T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	ease up on the enter key dude, you are scrolling the channel
2010-07-29T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	why do you want gui login if you are just going to use cli??
2010-07-29T10:51:00.000Z	picard1421	ActionParsnip	well im trying to do facial recognition login.. i dont want a GUI.. at all.. but i cant figure out a way to do facial recognition login without it??
2010-07-29T10:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	weird stuff, i see you point
2010-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	i'd just have the user log in to an x session then
2010-07-29T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	i believe maco knows a thing or 3
2010-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	flwm is probably lightest, Fluxbox, openbox are light too
2010-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	the login system is seperate to the DE and WM
2010-07-29T11:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	you can use KDM to log into any desktop environmnt you like, a desktop environment doesn't have a dedicated login system
2010-07-29T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	deps and libs
2010-07-29T11:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	its also why servers dont have x servers, its less to run and smaller footprint, leaving greater resources for the stuff it i serving
2010-07-29T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	the desktop is moot, you can use any gui login screen to then load into any desktop. You can use GDM to boot into KDE if you want
2010-07-29T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	slim is pretty light
2010-07-29T21:09:00.000Z	picard1421	ActionParsnip	is that customizeable
2010-07-29T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	picard1421	very
