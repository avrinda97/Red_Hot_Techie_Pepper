2009-06-30T07:25:00.000Z	Canageek		Um, ok thats bad. The liveCD just froze, and I just ran Check CD on it
2009-06-30T07:25:00.000Z	Canageek		I'm pretty sure my hardware is good...
2009-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	losher	Canageek	froze when, exactly?
2009-06-30T07:27:00.000Z	Canageek		When I hit numlock, I was goint to try sudo modprobe rt2500pci and when I hit numblock too type 2500 it seemed to crash
2009-06-30T07:27:00.000Z	Canageek		as in everything locked up
2009-06-30T07:27:00.000Z	Canageek		second time its happend tonight
2009-06-30T07:27:00.000Z	Canageek		I've not touched this computer since oh, last summer
2009-06-30T07:27:00.000Z	Canageek		when I tired to get linux working on it
2009-06-30T07:28:00.000Z	losher	Canageek	which os live-cd are you running?
2009-06-30T07:28:00.000Z	Canageek		I think the lastest Ubuntu relase
2009-06-30T07:29:00.000Z	Canageek		let me check
2009-06-30T07:29:00.000Z	Canageek	losher	ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso
2009-06-30T07:29:00.000Z	losher	Canageek	hangs are usually hardware related. Maybe you should run a memtest overnight?
2009-06-30T07:30:00.000Z	Canageek		I guess, but I used this computer constanly till I got my laptop without trouble so unless its broken down while sitting unplugged
2009-06-30T07:30:00.000Z	losher	Canageek	9.04 is fussier than other releases. Another options is try again with 8.04.2
2009-06-30T07:30:00.000Z	Canageek		Ok
2009-06-30T07:30:00.000Z	Canageek		I'll try that if installing it doesn't work
2009-06-30T07:30:00.000Z	losher	Canageek	good luck
