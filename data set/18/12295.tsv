2006-05-23T12:41:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	There's nothing to a command prompt; you type a command, it runs it. You just need to know what commands exist :)
2006-05-23T15:06:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	rpm's are Red Hat Package Management files.
2006-05-23T15:06:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	but you usually shouldn't be installing from them; better to install from the repos directly (IMHO)
2006-05-23T15:08:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	didn't the zsnes package in the repos work? Did you try that first?
2006-05-23T15:09:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	Have you used Synaptic before?
2006-05-23T15:10:00.000Z	hasan	hastesaver	which pakacge is synaptic do i have to install to access zsnes
2006-05-23T15:10:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	look for the package zsnes
2006-05-23T15:13:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	you need to enable multiverse; just a sec I'll tell you how to do that --
2006-05-23T15:14:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	did you read that link ubotu sent you? (Or just look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto )
2006-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	hasan	hastesaver	i am reading the link now
2006-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	hasan	hastesaver	i found a gameboy advance repository but not an zsnes one
2006-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	hasan	hastesaver	i only found a gameboy advance repository but not an zsnes one
2006-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	have you enabled multiverse?
2006-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	don't repeat, don't paste.
2006-05-23T15:29:00.000Z	hasan	hastesaver	yes i enabled multiuniverse
2006-05-23T15:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	a package called zsnes is there in multiverse; do an update (or "Refresh"?) and search again
2006-05-23T15:40:00.000Z	hastesaver	hasan	it's multiverse, not universe
