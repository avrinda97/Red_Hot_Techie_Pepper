2007-06-21T10:04:00.000Z	Naisenu		How do I readd myself to multiple groups?
2007-06-21T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	usermod -G [group1,group2,group3]  -a username (DONT forget the -a)
2007-06-21T10:05:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	do the groups have to be in the square brackets?
2007-06-21T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	no, group1,group2,group3
2007-06-21T10:06:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	ty for the clarification
2007-06-21T10:09:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	that didn't work
2007-06-21T10:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	What error did it give?
2007-06-21T10:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	What group are you trying to add yourself to?
2007-06-21T10:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	What groups are you currently in?
2007-06-21T10:10:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	the ones I accidentally removed myself from :) (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26547/)
2007-06-21T10:11:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	FYI, I am "carissa"
2007-06-21T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	eh, forgot the -a, hmm?  What does 'groups' give you?
2007-06-21T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	that's much easier than catting a text file
2007-06-21T10:11:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	I ran it as: sudo usermod -G adm,dialout,fax,cdrom,floppy,tape,audio,dip,plugdev,scanner,admin,fuse -a carissa
2007-06-21T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	what groups are you currently in?
2007-06-21T10:12:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	Apparently only a group I was trying to create: "dutton"
2007-06-21T10:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Naisenu	Right.  Ok, since you're currenlty not in admin, you can't sudo.  So you'll need to reboot, (unless you have another user that has sudo privs), at GRUB, go to a "recovery mode", it'll be a root prompt, add your user to her groups, and you're good.
2007-06-21T10:13:00.000Z	Naisenu	Flannel	Yes i'll hop into hubby's account
