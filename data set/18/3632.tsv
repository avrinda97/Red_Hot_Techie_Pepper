2011-06-10T04:42:00.000Z	szal	Fretta	please rephrase
2011-06-10T04:43:00.000Z	Fretta		when using apt-get install, does this install the dependencies for a particular package, default... or do i need to specify with an option flag?
2011-06-10T04:44:00.000Z	Fretta	szal	^ any idea?
2011-06-10T04:49:00.000Z	szal	Fretta	you're either pretty new or pretty blind if you haven't seen that yet :P ..  test case -> 'sudo apt-get -d install emacs' <- that would only download the pkgs, but it'll most likely ask for confirmation anyway
2011-06-10T04:50:00.000Z	Fretta	szal	thnx for the nice comments, but also thax for the -d flag
2011-06-10T04:51:00.000Z	szal	Fretta	no offence meant
