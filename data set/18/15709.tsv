2005-04-20T09:30:00.000Z	carthik		then add a launcher for the app... tcwd
2005-04-20T09:31:00.000Z	carthik		login to gnome then :)
2005-04-20T09:32:00.000Z	carthik		check whats there for apps currently and you'll get the hang of it
2005-04-20T09:34:00.000Z	carthik		if i may repeat my question...
2005-04-20T09:34:00.000Z	carthik		I have a strange problem - each time after I login, the r, m, b etc keys dont work -- until is go to system->preferences->keyboard layout and change the layout from 104 to 105 keys or back... why is this so, can't the setting be remembered, once set?
2005-04-20T09:35:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	wow, do you have some special hardware/keyboard?
2005-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	glad i don't have that problem :)
2005-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	but it sounds more solvable
2005-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	carthik	Dreamer31	I am fond of this
2005-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	is it only in gnome, if you start a different WM, do they work?
2005-04-20T09:37:00.000Z	carthik	Dreamer31	never tried another WM...
2005-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	carthik	Dreamer31	when I was on KDE, on ubuntu, things were fine though....
2005-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	try that... blackbox, flux, something simple if you ahve to apt-get it
2005-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	try it not
2005-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	try it now
2005-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	if that works then i'd wipe your gnome data (move it temp) and see if that fixes it...
2005-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	or do what dcraven_ says
2005-04-20T09:45:00.000Z	Dreamer31	carthik	i switching video cards (both NV) no problem, of course it doesn't work 100% right though
