2009-09-07T05:31:00.000Z	LucidGuy		Picking myself up a netbook but thinking on getting either a 1gig ram model of 2gig.  Does anyone know if the 2gig will consume allot more battery life?
2009-09-07T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	also you could ask in ##hardware
2009-09-07T05:33:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sebsebseb	Im ordering the Ubuntu Dell miniV .. its loaded with Ubuntu, thats why I was aksing.
2009-09-07T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	ok well it's still offtopic really for this channal
2009-09-07T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	your question is hardware realted not software related in anyway really hence  being off topic really as far as I know
2009-09-15T03:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	yes
2009-09-15T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	they do, but only security updates
2009-09-15T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	like standard releases only security updates from the repo
2009-09-15T03:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	oh it didn't say there ok
2009-09-15T03:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	18 months of support on the desktop,  3 years on the server
2009-09-15T04:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	don't get it yet, unless your a developer
2009-09-15T04:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	or a proper  Ubuntu tester
2009-09-15T04:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	If you want to get it early maybe the Beta  on  October 1st
2009-09-15T04:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	I think it's the first
2009-09-15T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	well then Beta
2009-09-15T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	or  maybe alpha, but  you will have to clean install  when the final is out really for sure probably, if you do  an alpha
2009-09-15T04:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	 yes alpha so bugs etc, that's expected,   and  this isn't the first  time I done alpha, but  like after last time, I said  I woudn't do it untill beta, but  I still did,   next time round I will stay with Karmic as host, and  virtual machine the development version,   and do a clean install as each one comes out
2009-09-15T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LucidGuy	indeed  8.10 is better than 9.04 in certain ways, and they even mess with shutdown and logout in 9.04
