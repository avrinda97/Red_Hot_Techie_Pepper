2010-03-15T09:49:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		Is there a way to increase the area in which you can grab a window to stretch it? It is currently a single pixel wide which is a pain to try and grab.
2010-03-15T09:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	alt+middle_mouse_button and click drag anywhere in window
2010-03-15T09:53:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	ZykoticK9	I was about to say "that only stretches the bottom part, and its not anywhere, it only works when close to the bottom" when I realized that "hmm, only close to the bottom... maybe the side will make that side move: lo and behold, it does. Thanks mate.

2010-03-15T11:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	where you trying to get Q3 sound working?
2010-03-15T11:09:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	ZykoticK9	Not that I know of. I'm having input and output issues with TeamSpeak3. I don't know what Q3 is.
2010-03-15T11:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	i just saw people talking about ioquake and using the quake3 sound fix.  if you're aren't talking about Quake3 (Q3) then nevermind ;)
2010-03-15T11:10:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	ZykoticK9	Ah, ok. Thanks anyways then. =)
2010-09-28T03:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	i don't think "compiz --replace" will work from a tty (i could be wrong)
2010-10-26T03:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	64bit can be more difficult to configure/setup (i use it)
2010-10-26T03:49:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	ZykoticK9	but other than that, not really a difference?
2010-10-26T03:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	other then the whole - different architectures ;)
2010-11-09T05:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	think of nice as "run priority" - see "man nice" for the man page ;)  "man renice" might be of interest as well.
2010-12-24T20:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	you\ use\ the\ escape
2010-12-24T20:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	"or put it in double quotes"
2010-12-24T20:27:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	ZykoticK9	I tried that and it said the directory didn't exist
2010-12-24T20:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spaztic_One	actually the best option is use the TAB key to complete the name
2010-12-24T20:28:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	ZykoticK9	Ah, true. Forgot about that completely
