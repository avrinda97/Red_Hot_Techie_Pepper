2008-08-29T02:12:00.000Z	asedelst		before I bother asking the actual question; is anyone here familiar with the ati fglrx video driver stuff on hardy?
2008-08-29T02:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	Just ask the question
2008-08-29T02:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	Are you sure that you are actually using fglrx currently ( if it won't load it may default back to vesa )
2008-08-29T02:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	You should not have to, X should do that
2008-08-29T02:19:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	 when i used to do an lsmod it would show fglrx either way
2008-08-29T02:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	That will disable fglrx
2008-08-29T02:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	Before you install fglrx you are going to be using either "ati" or vesa
2008-08-29T02:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	BTW, your posts to me will only be highlighted in my client if you use my full nick ( use tab completion )
2008-08-29T02:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	Yes, to use the open source ati driver set your xorg.conf to use Driver "ati"
2008-08-29T02:25:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	I'm going to retry that again; though I had poor luck last time.  That should use dri and support aiglx right?
2008-08-29T02:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	It depends on your card
2008-08-29T02:27:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	i'll be back; thanks for the help so far
2008-08-29T02:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	asedelst	np
2008-08-29T02:35:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	looks like that much worked
2008-08-29T02:36:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	should lsmod still only find "video" tho?
2008-08-29T02:36:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	in any event; I guess the next thing I need to do is try to enable dri
2008-08-29T02:55:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	cool; i got the fglrx driver working; and aiglx is working too... only problem is that xrandr is reporting a resolution of 1400x1050 as max
2008-08-29T03:00:00.000Z	asedelst	Jordan_U	you still there?
