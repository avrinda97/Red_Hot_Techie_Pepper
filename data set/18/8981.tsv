2011-12-12T15:42:00.000Z	NeilP		is this the help channel?
2011-12-12T15:43:00.000Z	NeilP		Can I ask for help regarding my administrator account? I just installed ubuntu yesterday and I love it but after I set my account to no password, it still asks for a password during authentication...
2011-12-12T15:44:00.000Z	NeilP		during installations (software center)
2011-12-12T15:44:00.000Z	NeilP		I just did...ehehe
2011-12-12T15:44:00.000Z	NeilP		I already tried the root thing though
2011-12-12T15:44:00.000Z	NeilP		I just set it to no password
2011-12-12T15:45:00.000Z	NeilP		When I try to change my password, the cursor goes to the new password immediately, it doesn't ask for the current one. But the Change button is dimmed
2011-12-12T15:45:00.000Z	NeilP		-user accounts
2011-12-12T15:45:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	although you set it to no password on login, to do things that require root access you need to authenticate
2011-12-12T15:47:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	but the password you created during install is still the password for sudo
2011-12-12T15:49:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	ok. lets start over. what is it that you are trying to do,
2011-12-12T15:50:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	whenever you set the password on the default account it becomes the sudo password
2011-12-12T15:50:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	well you set it to auto login, but you still set a password
2011-12-12T15:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	during install you set a password, you then set to autologin.. the password you set is still valid
2011-12-12T15:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	if you dont know what it is jsut do passwd from terminal and reset or go to accounts and reset threw gui
2011-12-12T15:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	i find its easier to just passwd from a terminal
2011-12-12T15:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	no terminal. command line interface... like cmd.exe in windows
2011-12-12T15:54:00.000Z	geoffmcc	NeilP	while loged itno the account you want to change the password on just use passwd then enter then it will guide u threw password change
