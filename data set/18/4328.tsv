2012-03-30T13:34:00.000Z	chinosuke		I've nfs mount point define in /etc/fstab. How to prevent the system mount nfs at the boot up time?
2012-03-30T13:36:00.000Z	chinosuke		i've define nfs mount point defined in /etc/fstab. How do i prevent system from mounting nfs source when starting up the system?
2012-03-30T13:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	take it out of /etc/fstab
2012-03-30T13:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	 oh I think there is another way like add noauto
2012-03-30T13:38:00.000Z	chinosuke	sacarlson	is there another without chaning /etc/fstab?
2012-03-30T13:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	well I guess if you force the server to be offline it will also not mount,  but on the client side the /etc/fstab would have to be modified
2012-03-30T13:39:00.000Z	chinosuke		previous i run gentoo and it has a netmount. so i disable this from default runlevel nfs will ot mount at startup.
2012-03-30T13:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	there might be some tricks on services start that would also work
2012-03-30T13:41:00.000Z	chinosuke	sacarlson	that is what i'm expecting "some service" :)
2012-03-30T13:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	but seems easier to just disable auto mount with noauto in the line of /etc/fstab as seen http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html
2012-03-30T13:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	in eather case you would require root access to change it
2012-03-30T13:46:00.000Z	chinosuke	sacarlson	i've like 20+ nfs mount point so just lazy to editing the file :)
2012-03-30T13:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	we have some fancy features in editors called find and replace all
2012-03-30T13:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	I know nothing of the services that need to change to disable it
2012-03-30T13:51:00.000Z	chinosuke	sacarlson	thanks anyway! but find and replace method need more attention if i enter the wrong term.
2012-03-30T13:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	that's what backups are for
2012-03-30T13:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	chinosuke	in the time we chated I could have already mannualy edited the 20 lines
2012-03-30T13:54:00.000Z	chinosuke	sacarlson	I done that before : find and replace and backup. just need a quick trick disable the service for the future usage.
