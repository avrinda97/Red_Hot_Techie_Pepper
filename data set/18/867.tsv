2011-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	pilgo		I turned off my wif using the menu at the top and uncheck the "enable wireless" or whatever it's called.
2011-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	pilgo		Now, whatever I do I can't turn it on. It's grayed out.
2011-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	some drivers like to blow up when you do that restaring fixes it
2011-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	pilgo		I tried to turn it on from Windows but booting into Ubuntu turns wireless off again
2011-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	pilgo	gogeta	Oh, I've restarted more than once :)
2011-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	and it didnt come back as on
2011-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	do sudo ip net up wlan0
2011-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	i probly did that wrong
2011-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	pilgo	gogeta	Nope. The physical button does nothing. The menu is frayed out. Windows works though but turns off when I boot into ubuntu
2011-12-15T11:27:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	ip link set wlan0 up
2011-12-15T11:27:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	thats the cli command to turn it on
2011-12-15T11:27:00.000Z	pilgo		oh!
2011-12-15T11:28:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	sudo  ip link set wlan0 up
2011-12-15T11:28:00.000Z	gogeta		normaly wlan0 is the defult card name
2011-12-15T11:29:00.000Z	pilgo	gogeta	I'll try that in one sec.
2011-12-15T11:30:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	well thats the command to tell the softwhere to turn the card on
2011-12-15T11:31:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	if the gui is not working for some reasion or it will fail and tell you why
2011-12-15T11:31:00.000Z	gogeta	pilgo	rather then just a gray box
