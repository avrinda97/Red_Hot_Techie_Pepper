2008-03-20T01:49:00.000Z	dabbill		i have haveing problems finding info on enabling a swap partition. Any one got a link for how to do it in ubuntu?
2008-03-20T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	swapon doesn't work?
2008-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	not sure if it worked, and dont know how to make it come on at startup
2008-03-20T01:51:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	is the swap defined in the fstab?
2008-03-20T01:51:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	nope
2008-03-20T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	that would be one thing to try.. hang on.. I'll see what my fstab says..
2008-03-20T01:52:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	dont know how it is suppose to look in fstab :)
2008-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	this is the line in my fstab       UUID=da19e64e-3350-42dd-b705-d0915a82c780 none swap sw 0 0
2008-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	you can get the uuid of your partition using sudo blkid
2008-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	yea just wasnt sure for the none / 0 0 parts of it :)
2008-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	thanks :)

2008-03-20T21:48:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	thanks
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	is it really bad? or just not as good as you thought it'd be?.. it might be that the card is pretty new and support in the driver isn't really up to speed yet
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	Its barly doing better then the 6600GT i had in the computer
2008-03-24T01:50:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	like its only doing maybe 5% better then the 6600GT.
2008-08-13T03:56:00.000Z	Slart	dabbill	from a terminal, tail /var/log/syslog
2008-08-13T03:58:00.000Z	dabbill	Slart	use 1-2 device not accepting address 6, error -62
