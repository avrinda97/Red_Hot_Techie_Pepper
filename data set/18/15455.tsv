2007-01-06T17:13:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	linux cna read the windows files without problems.
2007-01-06T17:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	As long as those partitions exist, linux doesn't care what kind they are.
2007-01-26T09:26:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	'sudo !!'
2007-01-26T09:27:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	No, the startup link was not removed, because the command didn't run as root.
2007-01-26T09:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	run 'sudo !!'
2007-01-26T09:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	That runs "sudo <previous command>'
2007-01-26T09:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	Aggort	They ONLY affect the printing system.
