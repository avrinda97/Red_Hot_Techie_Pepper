2012-03-06T20:29:00.000Z	spartan2276		How can I get my Webcam to show while using skype? I go to the Sesstings and my laptop webcam is not listed
2012-03-06T20:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	does the webcam work in cheese?
2012-03-06T20:31:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	I think I may have a bigger issue it just said if I would like to install these packages(cheese) without verification
2012-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	so I guess the Key from the Ubuntu servers is messed up
2012-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	can you give a pastebin of the output of:   sudo apt-get update
2012-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	you probably added a PPA and not the key
2012-03-06T20:33:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/3p3jrLSA
2012-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	sudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 40976EAF437D05B5
2012-03-06T20:35:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	do you want the output of this
2012-03-06T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	was a key imported
2012-03-06T20:36:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	I guess not because I still get the same error msg when I do sudo apt-get update
2012-03-06T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	just go for it dude, install the packages
2012-03-06T20:45:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	ok installed cheese, ran it and I get no devices found
2012-03-06T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	then the cam isn't configured
2012-03-06T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	run:  lsusb    and use the 8 character hex ID to find guides
2012-03-06T20:46:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	but it was working before this morning
2012-03-06T20:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spartan2276	tried a reboot?
2012-03-06T20:50:00.000Z	spartan2276	ActionParsnip	what is this Windows? LOL. No I really doubt that it will solve the issue as I rebooted it this morning after a software update
