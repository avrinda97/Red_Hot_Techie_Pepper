2011-04-04T09:23:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	sudo shutdown -h now
2011-04-04T09:24:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	there's a suedit or sudoedit util that I think you need to use...
2011-04-04T09:25:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	I was gone a while, so I might be unclear. are you just trying to shutdown?
2011-04-04T09:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	do you have a  $  or a #  for your prompt?
2011-04-04T09:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	just live, or live with usb?
2011-04-04T09:29:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	it's the lower options when you boot BT4. the "persistent" live options do use storage. so whether something went wrong depends on whether you used those and were in the middle of doing something when you powered off.
2011-04-04T09:30:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	no, it would write to usb.
2011-04-04T09:31:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	fennucci	but those files could have been open, and could become corrupt.
