2006-10-15T10:00:00.000Z	SuperMiguel		i just got an old PIII 800 MGHZ and 300 MB of ram, and i want to make it server, beside ssh server and http server there is any other useful tool?
2006-10-15T10:01:00.000Z	SuperMiguel		what is an cluster and what is an NAS device
2006-10-15T10:02:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	oh man you can make the server do anything
2006-10-15T10:03:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	you can make web access servers, you can make ldap servers, ftp servers, streaming media servers
2006-10-15T10:03:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	you can spend a lifetime building super cool things :)
2006-10-15T10:06:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	holycow	what is an ldap servers?
2006-10-15T10:06:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	its basically a really really fancy address book you can use to authenticate users against and provide priviledges to them
2006-10-15T10:07:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	holycow	there any way to make a file server, like i have 5 computers and i want them to share files two of them have windows
2006-10-15T10:08:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	yes i'll show you the really easy way
2006-10-15T10:08:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	holycow	ok =)
2006-10-15T10:08:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	1. research what vmware is ... in particular you will need to know what vmware player is and what vmware server is
2006-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	2. you will download a vmware appliance image ... and run it from your vmware server when you have that setup ... which is easy but a bit hard for a noob, you need to google a bit
2006-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	 since its plug and play
2006-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	3. http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/315
2006-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	holycow	do you want me to install the vmware server?
2006-10-15T10:14:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	in order to run the vmware appliance images, you will need to install vmware server 1.x which is free to use (though not open source.  later you can use something like xen to do virtualization when you are more comfy with how things work)
2006-10-15T10:16:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	holycow	and then?
2006-10-15T10:17:00.000Z	holycow	SuperMiguel	i can't hand hold you through the whole thing.  i gave you the shortest route to the most interesting way to test out linux environments, particularly server level stuff
