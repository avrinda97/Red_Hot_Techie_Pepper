2007-12-26T18:53:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	Hibernate didn't turn it off at all
2007-12-26T18:54:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	Hibernate just gave the same result but the screens showed the tty7 cursor blink (you know, when you don't have x server/gdm)
2007-12-26T18:54:00.000Z	sascha_	ader11	i think you best chance is looking for people with the same laptop running ubuntu
2007-12-26T18:54:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	I'm on a desktop
2007-12-26T18:54:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	making it all the more troublesome :P
2007-12-26T18:55:00.000Z	sascha_	ader11	indeed
2007-12-26T18:55:00.000Z	sascha_	ader11	on my desktop it works which suprised me alot. but i see no use for it on a desktop honestly.
2007-12-26T18:56:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	The real problem is that if I leave my computer unattended it automatically tries to suspend
2007-12-26T18:56:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	I don't use it much, it's just that it's automatically invoked
2007-12-26T18:57:00.000Z	sascha_	ader11	you can disable that in the gnome-power-manager
2007-12-26T18:58:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	o.o in the terminal gnome-power-manager doesn't do anything, it just gives me another prompt
2007-12-26T18:58:00.000Z	sascha_	ader11	its in the menu or try gnome-power-preferences
2007-12-26T18:59:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	Actions: Put computer to sleep when inactive for **never**
2007-12-26T18:59:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	Display: Put display to sleep when inactive for **40 minutes**
2007-12-26T19:00:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	so I don't know if that's the problem or not
2007-12-26T19:04:00.000Z	sascha_	ader11	i surrender, better ask the forums
2007-12-26T19:06:00.000Z	ader11	sascha_	Thanks for not leaving me hangin :]
