2011-02-26T22:57:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	ikonia You can tell the router to set static IPs
2011-02-26T22:57:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	how would wireless go into that?
2011-02-26T22:58:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	Most routers have a web-based config
2011-02-26T22:58:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	and?
2011-02-26T23:00:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	Go into the DHCP configuration page and set static or fixed leases (depending on what term the router's config uses).
2011-02-26T23:00:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	that will not solve the naming issues, my router doesnt know anything about DNS
2011-02-26T23:01:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	Well, as I said before you set each device's hostname to what you want.
2011-02-26T23:02:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	Or you can edit host file on the various PCs to use what you want it to use.
2011-02-26T23:02:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	ups, that is possible, if there are 3-4 pcs, i have 6 curently,
2011-02-26T23:06:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	ssh into them and append to host files with cat >>
2011-02-26T23:06:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	its mixes, 2x win, 3x ubuntu, 1x osx ....
2011-02-26T23:06:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	That way, you just paste a whole batch in each one.
2011-02-26T23:07:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	reformat 2x win and 1x osx  ;/
2011-02-26T23:07:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	no :)
2011-02-26T23:08:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	Then just set hostnames as you see fit
2011-02-26T23:09:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	And set static leases in the router, (to make things even more simplier).  If you have static IPs you can just use IP address.  So.. why NOT just use IP???
2011-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	brontoeee	terry	nothing wrong with that, it feels dumb on the long run, also ips are not really human friendly
2011-02-26T23:14:00.000Z	terry	brontoeee	You only need to remember the last 1 or 2 digits because you know ###.##.# already.  so....  i.e. I have 7 on my home LAN, kids pc is .12 webserver is .18 wife's is .5 for the Ubuntu machine and .20 for the MS Windows one etc.etc. etc.
