2007-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	cweagans		does anyone here know of a good C++ IDE for ubuntu?
2007-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	anjuta
2007-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	can just get that by doing "sudo apt-get install anjuta"?
2007-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	yes, but you will likely also want a GUI designer
2007-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	fluid, which pulls in fltk, is nice - but can be a tricky API to learn
2007-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	I am still learning C++...any suggestions on a simple API?
2007-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	FLTK, if you want C++ and not C
2007-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	for a GUI designer? or for an IDE?
2007-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	for an IDE.. Anjuta or Eclips.. for a GUI designer, fluid
2007-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	thank you! that helps a lot
2007-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	and for a graphics toolkit, fltk - or sdl if you are either suicidal or writing a game
2007-06-03T11:28:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	apt-get can't find fltk in any of the repositories
2007-06-03T11:29:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	it can't find sdl either
2007-06-03T11:29:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	just install fluid
2007-06-03T11:30:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	i did, but I would like a graphics api to play around with...I would eventually like to write a game (rather, the rendering portion of a game)
2007-06-03T11:32:00.000Z	lockd	cweagans	libfltk1.1-dev, libsdl-dev
2007-06-03T11:32:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	awesome....thank you much
2007-06-04T09:58:00.000Z	cweagans	lockd	chmod /mnt/*diskname*
