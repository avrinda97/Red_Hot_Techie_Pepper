2008-04-09T09:32:00.000Z	sethrd		Hello.
2008-04-09T09:33:00.000Z	sethrd		I don't much care for all the apps that ubuntu desktop installs. Anyway to cut it down during installation, or possible do a server install, and install JUST Xorg and whatever apps I want, instead of a full blown GNOME desktop? gnome-light from Gentoo comes to mind
2008-04-09T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	Grab the alternate CD and you can install a text-only system (or the server CD, but you'll want the generic kernel)
2008-04-09T09:36:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	So, I could install via the via CD, then just do apt-get gnome, and have a bare minimum GNOME desktop, or will it still grab all the crap that comes with the ubuntu-desktop package?
2008-04-09T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	the gnome package in universe grabs stock gnome (which includes the gnome apps, like epiphany, etc).  There are other packages for a bare gnome install, yes.  I don't believe there's a pre-fab metapackage, but yes, you can build your own lightweight one.
2008-04-09T09:38:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	How would you go about building a stripped down version of GNOME without pulling everything from universe?
2008-04-09T09:39:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	what?  You mean without installing the "gnome" package?
2008-04-09T09:39:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	Yes, I apologize. How would I go about installing a bare minimum GNOME install?
2008-04-09T09:40:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	I want the bare minimums, as I don't use 3/4th the apps the come with the ubuntu-desktop package.
2008-04-09T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/gnome is that package, which depends on http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/gnome-desktop-environment, which looks to be a standard gnome desktop without too many other things.  Epiphany, Ekiga, evolution, and that looks like that's it when it comes to extras.
2008-04-09T09:43:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	So install with the alt CD, then just do apt-get install gnome?
2008-04-09T09:44:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	gnome will include some extras, gnome-desktop-environment includes fewer.  gnome includes synaptic, rhythmbox, etc.  Take a look
2008-04-09T09:56:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	I'm not. It solved all my issues.
2008-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	Ok, so then do apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment ?
2008-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	yep (and xorg)
2008-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	sethrd	Flannel	Heh, you would like that doin that would fetch xorg in the process.
2008-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	Not necessarily.  Just because you've got those apps doesn't mean your Xserver is on this machine
2008-04-09T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	sethrd	Please don't be malicious.
