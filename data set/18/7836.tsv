2007-11-06T14:28:00.000Z	import		need a help document on remastering ubuntu i want to make ubuntu use fluxbox instead of gnome. And i would like fluxbox to be installed instead of gnome when you click the install.Also how does the installation work, does it just copy everything from the squashfs file to the hard drive?
2007-11-06T14:30:00.000Z	import		anyone have a answer for above?
2007-11-06T14:31:00.000Z	import		void would like to do a remaster so i know how things work :) only the best way to learn about your system and how it works
2007-11-06T14:31:00.000Z	import		im a hands on kinda guy
2007-11-06T14:32:00.000Z	import		and i like to tinker alot
2007-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	import		void does your documentation contain the information on the installation process. Does ubuntu copy everything off the squash file system to the hard drive. so if i remaster the squash file and apt-get remove gnome then apt-get install fluxbox, inside the chroot. Will ubuntu then use fluxbox for the install.

2007-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	redtux	import	alright - have you already tried http://www.gnewsense.org/Builder/HowToCreateYourOwnGNULinuxDistribution ?
2007-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	import	redtux	i am playing to mount the squash file system and doing this manually not using some program to help me along.
2007-11-06T14:38:00.000Z	import	redtux	yes i have remastered a few cds but nothing like this
2007-11-06T14:38:00.000Z	import	redtux	im just not sure if thats how things will work out. Im pretty sure not 100 percent that the squash file system is copied strieght off to the hard drive
2007-11-06T14:41:00.000Z	redtux	import	k, sry - what about https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomizationFromScratch ? i also guess it's being copied 1:1 - but i cannot securely confirm it. ;)
2007-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	import	redtux	nice documentation thank you
2007-11-06T14:48:00.000Z	redtux	import	can't find the information you're looking for. :( but if you want to learn, you could join #fluxbuntu and help them... :)
2007-11-06T14:50:00.000Z	redtux	import	yes, you said "mount /dev/..." - thus, your system won't know where to mount your device... and you will need sudo to mount stuff that's not in /etc/fstab...
2007-11-06T15:00:00.000Z	redtux	import	k3b can read .daa files?
2007-11-06T15:01:00.000Z	import	redtux	about 90 percent
2007-11-06T15:03:00.000Z	redtux	import	bye ;)
