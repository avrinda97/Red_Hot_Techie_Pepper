2008-12-25T23:14:00.000Z	n0kS111		Hello. I have a problem with my wifi. The network manager finds automatically my wifi but when I click on it and when I enter my password it doesn't connect. I don't have this problem in winxp and the password I use is the same in both OS.
2008-12-25T23:14:00.000Z	n0kS111		Can anyone help pls?

2008-12-25T23:17:00.000Z	brohken	n0kS111	cool. yea im not sure why it does that... but installing netapplet seemed to do the trick for me
2008-12-25T23:18:00.000Z	brohken		anyone know where i can adjust volume other than alsamixer? im getting sound right now... but very low. alsamixer is at the highest.

2008-12-25T23:21:00.000Z	brohken	n0kS111	nt sure then... sorry... it should automatically see any wireless connections in the area
2008-12-25T23:22:00.000Z	brohken		do you have a hardware switch that's set to off?
2008-12-25T23:26:00.000Z	n0kS111	brohken	I have my wifi ON. I installed network-admin and it detects my Wifi but it doesn't want to connect to it
