2004-10-13T14:23:00.000Z	julia		hi
2004-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	julia		If I wanted to run Kopote (KDE based IM client) is it possible in unbuntu?
2004-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	burner_	julia	you could... but what's wrong with gaim?
2004-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	julia	burner_	I just liked kopote better
2004-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	julia	burner_	would I just add a generic debian source ?
2004-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	burner_	julia	try just adding universe
2004-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	julia	burner_	did that
2004-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	julia	burner_	do you mind if I paste my sources.list in a /msg ?
2004-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	burner_	julia	flood works
2004-10-13T14:36:00.000Z	julia	burner_	kernel issue?
2004-10-13T14:39:00.000Z	julia	burner_	can you explain this checkinstall thing?
2004-10-13T14:40:00.000Z	burner_	julia	./configure; make; checkinstall
2004-10-13T14:41:00.000Z	julia	burner_	that's pretty cool
2004-10-13T14:42:00.000Z	julia	burner_	some of us are old school ;-)
2004-10-13T14:43:00.000Z	julia	burner_	Sun is alot older than 1999
2004-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	julia	burner_	I was going to ask about a live CD that would be great
2004-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	julia	burner_	hopefully something that allows for a usb key for saving files
2004-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	burner_	julia	if you need one in the meantime... there's always kanotix... it's kde based, but still good
