2008-11-18T15:50:00.000Z	zhai		guys.. how can i download flashplayer??
2008-11-18T15:50:00.000Z	zhai		would somebody help me?
2008-11-18T15:51:00.000Z	fde	zhai	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restricted-extras ... it'll set you up with most everything you'll need codecs and plugins wise
2008-11-18T15:53:00.000Z	fde	zhai	do as I said
2008-11-18T15:54:00.000Z	fde	zhai	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2008-11-18T15:54:00.000Z	fde	zhai	Applications > Accessories > Terminal  and type what I said  :/
2008-11-18T15:59:00.000Z	fde	zhai	ok... then go to System > Administration > Software Sources and make sure all boxes in the first tab are checked
2008-11-18T16:13:00.000Z	fde	zhai	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/8.10/release/  should probably grab the torrent if you have a client for it.
2008-11-18T16:16:00.000Z	fde	zhai	depends how you partitioned, but probably, yes
2008-11-18T16:18:00.000Z	zhai	fde	u mean bitTorrent??
2008-11-18T16:18:00.000Z	fde	zhai	bittorrent is a torrent client....
2008-11-18T16:18:00.000Z	fde	zhai	I meant the .torrent file
2008-11-18T16:21:00.000Z	fde	zhai	you get what I said? got disconnected briefly...
2008-11-18T16:22:00.000Z	zhai	fde	yeah.. im about to download it now.. but im having a hard time downloadingit
2008-11-18T16:23:00.000Z	fde	zhai	what is the issue?
2008-11-18T16:29:00.000Z	fde	zhai	ugh, then just grab the regular iso file for i386 ... you might be using a version of Ubuntu that didn't have a torrent client
2008-11-18T16:48:00.000Z	fde	zhai	you can use anti-virus software sure... mostly to protect your windows using friends though
2008-11-18T16:48:00.000Z	fde	zhai	viruses are much less effective on Linux boxes... even less effective if you have something like selinux
