2011-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	is it changed to POP3?
2011-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	check it is an IMAP folder
2011-01-13T01:36:00.000Z	Linden940	WaltherFI	its IMAP not POP3...it use 2 save a copy on the server but it stoped doing so...I would like it to do so..so when I am not at desktop an sign into mail online I can view sent folder
2011-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	check your sending settings
2011-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	there should be a tickbox with save sent on server iirc
2011-01-13T01:38:00.000Z	Linden940	WaltherFI	I am using evolution  an there is no check box for save sent on server
2011-01-13T01:39:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	hm, if you're sending through correct smtp, it should work
2011-01-13T01:39:00.000Z	Linden940	WaltherFI	it will send the e-mail but it wont save it to the online sent folder...
2011-01-13T01:40:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	that is not evolution's fault then
2011-01-13T01:40:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	check your webmail settings, there might be something
2011-01-13T01:40:00.000Z	Linden940	WaltherFI	i will look again but I had checked over that like 3 times now give me a few to check
2011-01-13T01:42:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	if evolution sends the mails through SMTP and it gets delivered, it is for evolution to decide whether the copy gets saved
2011-01-13T01:42:00.000Z	Linden940	WaltherFI	where would I find the setting that would save the copy online?
2011-01-13T01:43:00.000Z	WaltherFI	Linden940	probably at your webmail, as the webmail clients are usually on the actual server
