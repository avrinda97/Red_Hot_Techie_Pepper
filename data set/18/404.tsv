2012-03-04T13:58:00.000Z	Kaltiz		Hey, I booted a Native install of Ubuntu through a VM, however I can't boot the native Ubuntu anymore. It still works through the VM any ideas?
2012-03-04T13:59:00.000Z	Kaltiz		It goes into some weird recovery boot mode
2012-03-04T13:59:00.000Z	Kaltiz		Umm
2012-03-04T14:00:00.000Z	Kaltiz		Possibly because the change of hardware
2012-03-04T14:00:00.000Z	Kaltiz		I get to the grub menu
2012-03-04T14:00:00.000Z	Kaltiz		and click to boot the ubuntu 11.10 and some text shows up.
2012-03-04T14:01:00.000Z	Kaltiz		(Really new to ubuntu I could go jump on another comp and boot into and tell you brb
2012-03-04T14:02:00.000Z	Kaltiz		If My memory s correct
2012-03-04T14:02:00.000Z	Kaltiz		It gets to determining the battery percentage?
