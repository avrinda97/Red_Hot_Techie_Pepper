2006-07-25T09:17:00.000Z	tuesday		Which GUI do you all prefer? I've found KDE to be more looks than anything... XFCE is under-developed, blackbox is for developers, and enlightenment is a great idea, but to raw. I like gnome pretty well, however.
2006-07-25T09:18:00.000Z	tuesday		I don't like KDE.
2006-07-25T09:18:00.000Z	tuesday		KDE's like that girl that's too pretty, almost to the point where it makes her a bitch.
2006-07-25T09:18:00.000Z	tuesday		All looks and no thought.
2006-07-25T09:19:00.000Z	tuesday		!%N
2006-07-25T09:20:00.000Z	tuesday		Your remark was in regards to? My saying 'bitch' correct?

2006-07-25T09:27:00.000Z	negativecreep	tuesday	found none
2006-07-25T09:27:00.000Z	tuesday	negativecreep	I do not know them. Look for the package that includes ipv4, or post something on the forums.
