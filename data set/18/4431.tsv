2009-04-12T02:26:00.000Z	Sylar		=/ i have windows
2009-04-12T02:27:00.000Z	Sylar		i just want to test it out on a virtual machine first before i install it.
2009-04-12T02:28:00.000Z	Sylar		yes i have virtualbox but do i have to have it burned on a cd or can i use it off the desktop on windows
2009-04-12T02:29:00.000Z	Sylar		ok, how much ram should be given to this os
2009-04-12T02:29:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	in virtualbox ubuntu will run fine at 512
2009-04-12T02:30:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	id say best arould be 1gb but most poeple dont have that free
2009-04-12T02:30:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	you might not be able to run virtualbox with only 512 of ram
2009-04-12T02:33:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	you can install 8.10 and when 9.04 comes out you can upgrade easily
2009-04-12T02:34:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	the extra speed of ext4 wouldn't isn't something not to install over
2009-04-12T02:35:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	ubuntu is good for beginers however it does also have a lot for the experanced user to do
2009-04-12T02:35:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	you might be able to use a lighter gui in virtual machine but gnome will be a little heavy
2009-04-12T02:37:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	the irc channel #megworld has a good small amount of users which can help you get ubuntu running on little ram howver we will probabaly help you run it without gnome and use a lighter gui
2009-04-12T02:38:00.000Z	megworld	Sylar	this channel has a lot of help and support but because megworld is smaller we can put more time and effort in researching and experementing with you
