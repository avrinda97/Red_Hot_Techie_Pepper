2007-01-19T12:33:00.000Z	nano		what's the difference between linux-generic and linux-686 and linux-386?
2007-01-19T12:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	linux-generic is a superset of all other linux architectures. linux-386 is compiled for pre-pentium1 hardware.
2007-01-19T12:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	linux-686, intended for pentium 4 and up, is one of the architectures obsoleted by generic.
2007-01-19T12:35:00.000Z	nano	arrenlex	it says that linux-686 is "obsoleted" by linux-generic...
2007-01-19T12:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	That's right.
2007-01-19T12:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	Okay, it's like this.
2007-01-19T12:35:00.000Z	nano	arrenlex	I currently have generic, is it optimized?
2007-01-19T12:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	Once upon a time there were many architectures! There were 386, 486, 686, amd-k7, and-k8, and many others!
2007-01-19T12:36:00.000Z	nano	arrenlex	carry on :)
2007-01-19T12:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	And the ubuntu developers, lo, they looked upon these architectures, and they said: augh! We're too lazy to provide all these.
2007-01-19T12:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	So they came together, and they crafted a great work; they toiled in secret on CVS and lo, they revealed their work to the world: it was -generic.
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	nano	arrenlex	so generic can handle all types of architectures..but not necessarily optimized right?
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	And they said unto the people: hark! No longer will you have to install kernels for your subarchitectures to get features you want! Here is -generic, and it provides all the features you want without significant loss of speed!
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	And the people cheered, and the sun shone bright, and it was so.
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	If you go here!
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	arrenlex		!generic | nano
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	nano	You get lots of juicy technical details about exactly how optimised -generic is
2007-01-19T12:37:00.000Z	nano	arrenlex	thanks a lot arrenlex :) that really clears it up
