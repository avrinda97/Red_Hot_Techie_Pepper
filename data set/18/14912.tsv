2005-05-26T13:12:00.000Z	bigfoot		hi all: i need to change the firefox.js file in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/pref, but it says in Properties-->Permissions Tab "You are not the owner, so you can't change these permissions." How do I become the owner? Is being the owner the same as sudo?
2005-05-26T13:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	bigfoot	why do you need to change the permissions?
2005-05-26T13:13:00.000Z	bigfoot	Burgundavia	I want to modify the file, so that I can customize how Firefox works. Check out http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/tips
