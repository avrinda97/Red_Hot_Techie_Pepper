2011-08-08T10:47:00.000Z	especially-corn		can i erase the distro's memory of the usb ports?
2011-08-08T10:47:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	Memory of the USB ports. What?
2011-08-08T10:49:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	Just unplug it. If the driver didn't load, or failed to load, replugging it will give it another go. However this won't fix a bad driver install, which you'll have to deal with manually.
2011-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	it doesn't work anymore, yesterday i bought a keyboard with 2 hubs included, it worked flawlessly, that is, until i used the 2 hubs, now it doesn't work anymore
2011-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	Does it work in another port or system?
2011-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	it works on another system
2011-08-08T10:51:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	Okay. Then you've probably generated a bus conflict. Something a DEVELOPED driver system like windows can handle. Linux'es drivers are written by people who want the driver...Hang on dude.
2011-08-08T10:53:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	yes, thats what i meant, i want my system to "forget" what this keyboard means because i suspect it still thinks my phone is somehow connected to the system,
2011-08-08T10:53:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	Well, I don't know how to do that, but have you given the system a good power cycle?
2011-08-08T10:54:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	yep, unplugged and stuff
2011-08-08T10:54:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	Well, plug it in and see what "dmesg | grep -i usb" outputs.

2011-08-08T10:59:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	don't know, i did a before and after unplugging
2011-08-08T10:59:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	everything i pasted was after i plugged it in
2011-08-08T11:00:00.000Z	especially-corn	OmegaForte	look http://paste.ubuntu.com/660943/
2011-08-08T11:01:00.000Z	OmegaForte	especially-corn	It looks like it sees something..
