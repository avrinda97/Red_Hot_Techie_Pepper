2006-04-24T10:55:00.000Z	whyameye_	OrTigaS	I'm tuning in late. You want something hyperterminal like in ubuntu? Try cutecom.
2006-04-24T10:55:00.000Z	whyameye_	OrTigaS	cutecom.
2006-04-24T10:58:00.000Z	whyameye_	OrTigaS	do you mean /dev/ttyUSB0?
2006-04-24T10:58:00.000Z	OrTigaS	whyameye_	yes
2006-04-24T11:00:00.000Z	whyameye_	OrTigaS	I can't think of why there would be. But cutecom might not be in synaptic...
2006-04-24T11:02:00.000Z	whyameye_	OrTigaS	unfortunately cutecom is not in the repos. I compiled from source. It's an easy build if you have built stuff before...
2006-04-24T11:03:00.000Z	OrTigaS	whyameye_	i'm newbie so i cant do that yet
2006-04-24T11:04:00.000Z	whyameye_	OrTigaS	I'm a bit green or I'd know how to make a .deb of my install of cutecom. anybody out there known how to do this? I remember something about fakeroot...
