2009-08-23T02:24:00.000Z	timothy_		every time i run apt-get i get it says that packages are not authenticated
2009-08-23T02:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	then you've added a third party repo without a key, no?
2009-08-23T02:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	please pastebin the error you're receiving
2009-08-23T02:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	Have you added a third-party repository?
2009-08-23T02:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	did you try sudo apt-get update?
2009-08-23T03:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	are you still trying to fix your repo auth error?
2009-08-23T03:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	I need a link
2009-08-23T03:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	try visiting http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jaunty-security/main/binary-i386 in a browser. Do you see a directory listing?
2009-08-23T03:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	right.
2009-08-23T03:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	essentially, apt-get is finding that that URL is a 404, when clearly it isn't. It isn't your ISP's fault either.
2009-08-23T03:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	my nickname is Stormx2, not storm x. If you want me to see your messages, use my nick
2009-08-23T03:52:00.000Z	timothy_	Stormx2	what did you want me to do after that
2009-08-23T03:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list please
2009-08-23T03:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	to get the contents, hit Alt + F2 and write "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" (without the quote)
2009-08-23T03:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	Uhg.
2009-08-23T04:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	Look, I need you to open a file, select all the text, paste it into pastebin, and give me the link
2009-08-23T04:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	Can you do all that?
2009-08-23T04:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	timothy_	Uhg. How did you go to open it?
