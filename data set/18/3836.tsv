2010-05-09T22:16:00.000Z	chandrageetha		how can i access skype that i installed on my system
2010-05-09T22:17:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	Alt + F2 --> type "skype"
2010-05-09T22:19:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	Is it in Applications -->Internet
2010-05-09T22:20:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	In terminal  type "which skype"
2010-05-09T22:24:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	you dont have skype installed, run "sudo apt-get install skype"
2010-05-09T22:26:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	can you paste what "echo $PATH" returns
2010-05-09T22:27:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	you dont include the quote when you type in the terminal
2010-05-09T22:29:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	now run "which skype" without quotes
2010-05-09T22:31:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	If "which skype" returned nothing, you most probably don't have skype installed
2010-05-09T22:32:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	run "sudo apt-get install skype" without quotes in terminal
2010-05-09T22:50:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	please explain
2010-05-09T23:12:00.000Z	hollyjolly	chandrageetha	sudo apt-get install pidgin
