2010-05-02T03:03:00.000Z	TheMudkip		It is not a startup service anymore
2010-05-02T03:03:00.000Z	TheMudkip		I even tried fucking up its startup script
2010-05-02T03:03:00.000Z	TheMudkip		It still works :(
2010-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	TheMudkip		I still want it to exist
2010-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	TheMudkip		I just dont want it to start
2010-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	TheMudkip		Oh , by the way , my grub is fucked up
2010-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	TheMudkip		All the text is weird
2010-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	TheMudkip		It is all on top of top of the the screen
2010-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	TheMudkip		And it is like the letters are missing bottom halves
2010-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	TheMudkip		Sorry
2010-05-02T03:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	Can you take a picture?
2010-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	You can probably solve the problem by uncommenting "GRUB_TERMINAL=console" in /etc/default/grub, but I wonder why it isn't working by default.
2010-05-02T03:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	Are you sure that's the grub menu? In Ubuntu the grub menu isn't shown by default (only if you have another OS installed or you hold shift).
2010-05-02T03:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	Ok, then that's not a grub issue (at least not likely)
2010-05-02T03:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	/etc/default/grub is where you change settings.
2010-05-02T03:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	If startupmanager changed the tty resolution that might be what caused the problem, by default grub passes a value that works with all BIOSs. If you set a higher one your BIOS may or may not support it.
2010-05-02T03:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	Could you pastebin your /etc/default/grub?
2010-05-02T03:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheMudkip	Remove the vga=769 from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
