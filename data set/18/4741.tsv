2010-02-23T18:40:00.000Z	anomiewut		Yeh I tried using the root
2010-02-23T18:40:00.000Z	anomiewut		but it wouldnt log in as that
2010-02-23T18:40:00.000Z	anomiewut		so I just want to give a user root pivs
2010-02-23T18:41:00.000Z	anomiewut		Is there not a simple command that gives the user root (or close to it) privs?
2010-02-23T18:42:00.000Z	anomiewut		no its not for use
2010-02-23T18:42:00.000Z	anomiewut		its for joomla
2010-02-23T18:43:00.000Z	anomiewut		so I don't need to CHMOD all my files to 0777
2010-02-23T18:43:00.000Z	anomiewut		you just give it ftp access
2010-02-23T18:43:00.000Z	anomiewut		it would only need full read/write permission over /var/www
2010-02-23T18:43:00.000Z	ibuclaw	anomiewut	O: O: O:
2010-02-23T18:44:00.000Z	anomiewut		ive set the home directory of the user to /var/www
2010-02-23T18:44:00.000Z	anomiewut		it didnt make a difference though
2010-02-23T18:45:00.000Z	anomiewut	Dr_Willis	how do I do that?
2010-02-23T18:46:00.000Z	anomiewut		argh
2010-02-23T18:46:00.000Z	anomiewut		I dont see why ubuntu makes it so difficult
2010-02-23T18:47:00.000Z	anomiewut		i would of been better installing winxp on the fucking thing
2010-02-23T18:48:00.000Z	ibuclaw	anomiewut	also, why not samba ?
