2010-02-26T13:45:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	what are you trying to measure?  I missed that part of the conversation
2010-02-26T13:45:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	How can I determine how much traffic has flown from my Ubuntu 9.10 computer to another Ubuntu 9.10 computer in my LAN in this session? '~$ ifconfig' gives a summary over all hosts in the LAN only.
2010-02-26T13:50:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	I didn't find it.. I know there are monitoring tools that do that kind of thing. I don't know taht you will be able to recover data on what happened in the past ..you have to havesomething recording that data already when it happens
2010-02-26T13:50:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	I'm checking out tcpstat though it might help
2010-02-26T13:51:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	youmean only data on the local lan?
2010-02-26T13:51:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	Yes.
2010-02-26T13:51:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	I think you might need to look into something like cacti or nagios and see if there's a monitro for that..
2010-02-26T13:53:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	I will do some snooping into tcpstat, cacti and nagios.
2010-02-26T13:54:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	yeah I amlooking at tcpstat now; and it might work with some filters, which are documented in tcpdump, but I can't say I know how to set those filters to do what you want
2010-02-28T09:51:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	I do not know why Synaptic's and apt-get's results differ. You need to observe more carefully both programs outputs.
2010-02-28T10:10:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	mail merge takes a set of information from tables in a spreadsheet/database and plugs t into points in a document so you can make like form letters
2010-02-28T10:11:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	so for instans you could have a letter that says dear [name] and it would set up a set of documents that put a name in each copy
2010-02-28T10:12:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	Ah! Thank you very much for  your excellent explanation.
2010-02-28T10:12:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	yeah you might check out http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/FAQ/Writer/Printing/How_do_I_setup_mail_merge

2010-02-28T10:12:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	Very good. I am hurrying to read this article.
2010-02-28T10:14:00.000Z	rifter	bullgard	basically fields in your document will refer to fields in the database or spreadsheet, so you could have things like name, address, phone number, favorite color, whatever, and then you relate those fields in your document to the fields in your data source and it plugs them in
2010-02-28T10:16:00.000Z	bullgard	rifter	Yes. I remember that WordStar implemented such a function.
