2009-06-19T05:28:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	if you're running ubuntu, use pulseaudio
2009-06-19T05:35:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	and lupine_85 thanx, i used pulseaudio and ran a windows update and now sound works
2009-06-19T05:35:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	yay! :)
2009-06-19T05:36:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	you said that pulseaudio is your friend, but ive heard that its bad compared to alsa and oss. What exactly is the diffrence?
2009-06-19T05:37:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	i didn't say it was your friend haha but it acts as a proxy for most/all apps so that you can control volume, etc with advanced features
2009-06-25T20:14:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	System > Administration > Software Sources
2009-06-25T20:14:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	how do I uninstall them after that I mean
2009-06-25T20:15:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	if you go to update-manger, click check for updates, it might downgrade the packages
2009-06-25T20:16:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	i did it says no updates available. does that mean i don't actually have any proposed updates installed?
2009-06-25T20:17:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	probably because it would downgrade them... try it from the terminal. run sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
2009-06-25T20:18:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	it says "No packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed."
2009-06-25T20:18:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	then it seems you're good
2009-06-25T20:20:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	oh alright i guess i don't have any installed then. this is a little off topic but what is the red horizontal line mean in xchat?
2009-06-25T20:20:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	what red horizontal line? you mean your nick highlighted? it's to help you see it
2009-06-25T20:21:00.000Z	knasto	cabrey	its in the xchat chat window. its  a random horizontal line that appears in between some lines of text.
2009-06-25T20:22:00.000Z	cabrey	knasto	strange O.o i don't get any of that
