2010-12-30T20:03:00.000Z	bibic682		Padron: I have similar card....I needed to use ndiswrapper and the windows driver for mine....now works great
2010-12-30T20:05:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	interesting , which version of a win driver did you use, as in for which version of windows, and im not sure if i have ndiswrapper installed , i presume I can pick it up by the package manager ?
2010-12-30T20:11:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	good deal, i cant locate the original driver disk but I have a copy of the driver stored on hdd, with ndiswrapper , does it require a command line syntax, is it a file that I need to edit to include a particular entry , or a gui ? sorry for my not being familliar
2010-12-30T20:13:00.000Z	bibic682	padron	: after install of ndis wrapper....start it and it will ask you to locate the driver .inf file.. its all in a gui
2010-12-30T20:14:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	awesome, much appreciated, we'll see how it goes
2010-12-30T20:18:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	one more thing, im running 32 bit maverik, and intend to use a 32bit winxp driver, did you do this with 32bit as well, or ?
2010-12-30T20:26:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	alright, thanks
2010-12-30T20:31:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	yea I will be
2010-12-30T20:32:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	just redownloading the xp driver , thought I had a copy of it, but didnt
2010-12-30T20:35:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	aye, will do
2010-12-30T20:40:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	Netrtuw.inf sound correct to you ?
2010-12-30T20:44:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	found it in the winxp2k folder, there is an rtl8187.sys in the same folder, as well as netrtuw.cat , im almost certain im in the right place ?
2010-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	aye
2010-12-30T20:46:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	sweet, ill reboot and see, thanks again, bbiab
2010-12-30T21:08:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	im curious as to why the linux driver was such crap ?
2010-12-30T21:11:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	yea that is what I had read as well, i was just glad i was able to get a tiny ammount of function from the linux driver because I had to d/l ndiswrapper , heh
2010-12-30T21:11:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	once I did that I fired it up and pointed it to the driver and rebooted, bingo
2010-12-30T21:21:00.000Z	padron	bibic682	yea man, the original driver out of the box could see all the networks, and connect to them, but was worthless, the only thing I ever managed to do with it was get 1/2 of the google main page to load, one time, and never again, so i looked around and located the newest linux driver from realtek and made it etc and that made a difference, if only enough to barely click a few pages and download packages in the kb size , heh
