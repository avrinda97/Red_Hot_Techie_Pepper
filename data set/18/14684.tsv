2005-08-12T15:32:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	-- I'm trying to play runescape. I have sound generally, but not when I play this game
2005-08-12T15:32:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	does it require direct OSS access? If you're using esd, have you tried esddsp $game ?
2005-08-12T15:35:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	the game required the java runtime pluggin for the firefox browser
2005-08-12T15:41:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	do you have time now to help me?
2005-08-12T15:42:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	sec
2005-08-12T15:44:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	it means wait a sec, because I have to take care of my pets
2005-08-12T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	/ pcharky: yes?
2005-08-12T15:48:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	runescape required the java runtime plugin in firefox
2005-08-12T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	ok, I'm not sure how that's affected by OSS...
2005-08-12T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	are you using esd?
2005-08-12T15:50:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	what is esd?
2005-08-12T15:54:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	pgrep esd
2005-08-12T15:56:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	OK, esd is running, any other ideas?
2005-08-12T15:56:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	I mentioned about 20 minutes ago that you could try: esddsp $game
2005-08-12T15:56:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	(substitute $game for the executable name)
2005-08-12T15:57:00.000Z	yoda	crimsun	the game is on the internet, how do I do that?
2005-08-12T15:58:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	ok, then you'll have to temporarily suspend esd. Try unchecking the System> Preferences> Sound> Enable sound server startup
2005-08-12T15:59:00.000Z	crimsun	yoda	then try your Java applet again
