2012-04-28T13:01:00.000Z	RyanB		Hey everyone. Does anybody have any experience with SSH?
2012-04-28T13:01:00.000Z	RyanB		I need help with that.
2012-04-28T13:02:00.000Z	RyanB		and I can't download it using wget
2012-04-28T13:03:00.000Z	RyanB		Ok. Nothing actually but it needs a log on to a website. Each time you try to download the file, it gives a new ID number. I am connecting to another server using PuTTY. I don't have
2012-04-28T13:03:00.000Z	RyanB		VNC access to otherwise access it.
2012-04-28T13:04:00.000Z	RyanB		So, is it possible to download files with variable download IDs using putty when SSHing to another server without VNC access?
2012-04-28T13:04:00.000Z	RyanB		It's http, not ftp by the way.
2012-04-28T13:05:00.000Z	RyanB		Ok in putty, you have a command called wget. I am trying to use that std0s
2012-04-28T13:05:00.000Z	RyanB		I am trying to use wget to download a file onto the server.
2012-04-28T13:05:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	man wget
2012-04-28T13:06:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	you can read up on specifying username and password
2012-04-28T13:06:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	as well as following redirects
2012-04-28T13:10:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	then that's probably a non-starter
2012-04-28T13:11:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	is it linked on a preceding page that does not have a variable in the URL?
2012-04-28T13:25:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	there are lots of other shells out there as well
2012-04-28T13:25:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	tcsh, csh, zsh, ksh
2012-04-28T13:26:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	bash is what you will find commonly setup on most linux distros nowadays
2012-04-28T13:26:00.000Z	_xan_	RyanB	it's pretty good as far as SSH clients for Windows go
