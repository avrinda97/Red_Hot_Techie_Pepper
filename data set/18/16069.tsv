2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		guys.. someone please help me with this X window system problem..
2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		I'm completely stuck here
2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		I've just upgraded to breezy and i still can't get X to run
2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		and I get the same error
2005-09-23T06:49:00.000Z	kuru		error:  could not open default font 'fixed';
2005-09-23T06:51:00.000Z	kuru		breezy is badly broken
2005-09-23T06:52:00.000Z	kuru		then again, it's a development release.. oh well
2005-09-23T06:54:00.000Z	kuru		hrmm
2005-09-23T06:55:00.000Z	volvoguy	kuru	i'd suggest checking that as well, if you can at least get to a command prompt.
2005-09-23T06:55:00.000Z	kuru	volvoguy	yeah, I slapped knoppix on there, disabled gdm and rebooted
2005-09-23T06:55:00.000Z	kuru	volvoguy	so I can get that much now
2005-09-23T06:56:00.000Z	kuru	volvoguy	grabbing ubuntu-base now
2005-09-23T06:56:00.000Z	volvoguy	kuru	just running knoppix live, or you installed it?
2005-09-23T06:57:00.000Z	kuru	volvoguy	nono.. I just used knoppix to mount the hda1 to remove +x bit off of the gdm script
2005-09-23T06:57:00.000Z	volvoguy	kuru	gotcha.
2005-09-23T06:57:00.000Z	kuru	volvoguy	otherwise X kept crashing and locking the keyboard
2005-09-23T06:57:00.000Z	kuru	volvoguy	which is pretty nasty i would say
2005-09-23T06:57:00.000Z	volvoguy	kuru	i agree.
