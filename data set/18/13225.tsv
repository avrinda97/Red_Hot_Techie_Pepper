2005-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	izi_		anyone here have a linksys AP ?
2005-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	yes
2005-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	wpa works ok with breezy ?
2005-12-23T17:26:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	but I don't use WPA -- I use ssh for everything that goes over wireless.
2005-12-23T17:26:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	hum ok ;)
2005-12-23T17:28:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	I know it's a compromise because I'm not protecting my network against unauthorized use, but you'd have to do MAC address spoofing to do that, which I think is enough of a barrier.
2005-12-23T17:29:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	have you got wpasupplicant? I think that's what you need to do WPA in breezy.
2005-12-23T17:30:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	yes: http://pastebin.com/468846
2005-12-23T17:31:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	I take it you've tested it without encryption.
2005-12-23T17:32:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	yep and it works ok
2005-12-23T17:33:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	is wpasupplicant running?
2005-12-23T17:35:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	sure: /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -B -d -w -i ath0 -D madwifi -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
2005-12-23T17:36:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	what I mean is: have you started it with '/etc/init.d/wpasupplicant start'? Checked with ps? Checked the logs?
2005-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	yep checked with ps, dunno where to find the logs though
2005-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	as I don't use it myself, all I can do is nag you with the obvious stuff.
2005-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	/var/log/syslog
2005-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	soundray	izi_	e.g. grep wpa /var/log/syslog
2005-12-23T17:38:00.000Z	izi_	soundray	nothing in the logs,  i'm going to investigate further, anyway thx
