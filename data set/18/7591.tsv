2011-05-13T14:23:00.000Z	squid0		hi. it seems there's a broken package that I tried to install via apt-get. now, whenever I try to install something else, I get a message saying I must configure 'sudo dkpg --configure -a'. But when I do that, it doesn't really configure the package. I can't install anything; apt-get just hangs on this broken package! please help
2011-05-13T14:23:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	Have you tried removing the broken package?
2011-05-13T14:24:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	yes, but it says I must install it first
2011-05-13T14:26:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	What happens when you try install--reinstall?
2011-05-13T14:26:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	sudo apt-get install --reinstall package
2011-05-13T14:26:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	trying that
2011-05-13T14:34:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	Did you do apt-get update first?
2011-05-13T14:34:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	no. I did now
2011-05-13T14:35:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	I did update, then install --reinstall, and it still hangs
2011-05-13T14:35:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	hmm.. not sure how it got that broken
2011-05-13T14:36:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	with the same error about having no files installed
2011-05-13T14:36:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	What did you do before it broke?
2011-05-13T14:37:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	I was installing it via apt-get, and it was taking ages, so I killed it. it wasn't even responding to Ctrl+C, so I killed the terminal process it was on
2011-05-13T14:37:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	Which version of ubuntu?
2011-05-13T14:37:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	10.10, mint
2011-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	soreau	squid0	I don't think we support mint here
2011-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	ok, but this is a basic tool, unrelated to mint's higher-level changes
2011-05-13T14:40:00.000Z	squid0	soreau	I tried apt-get clean, and now when I try apt-get install some other package, it's downloading the broken package again... well I'll see if it works
