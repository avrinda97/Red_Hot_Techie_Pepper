2011-04-07T19:53:00.000Z	pumeust		i'm using testdisk and it says boot sector status is ok and backup boot sector status is ok and 'sectors are identical'. but when i click on 'list' it says 'can't open filesystem. Filesystem seems damaged'?
2011-04-07T19:54:00.000Z	compdoc	pumeust	how about the smart data - any reallocated sectors?
2011-04-07T19:55:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	how do i access smart data?
2011-04-07T19:55:00.000Z	compdoc	pumeust	you using gnome?
2011-04-07T19:55:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 yes
2011-04-07T19:56:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 oops i accidentally clicked on ok somewhere and now i'm taken back to 'Analyse'. do i have to start over?
2011-04-07T19:57:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 oh ok hold on
2011-04-07T19:58:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 'analyse' is the first step, after i make disk selection
2011-04-07T20:00:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 no sorry that was on testdisk. ok now i'm looking at disk utility and it says reallocated sector count assessment is 'good', but i didnt  run the 'run self-test'
2011-04-07T20:01:00.000Z	compdoc	pumeust	no reallocated sectors? no pending sectors? any reported uncorrectable?
2011-04-07T20:02:00.000Z	compdoc	pumeust	if the disk shows healthy, then maybe you corrupted the drive by shutting off the system power
2011-04-07T20:03:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 'current pending sector count' says 'N/A...normalized: 200, worst: 200, threshold: 0, value'...
2011-04-07T20:03:00.000Z	compdoc	pumeust	the Value is what you need to be concerned about
2011-04-07T20:04:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 'reallocated sector count' assessemt is 'good, 'normalized: 200, worst: 200, threshold: 140, value: 0 sectors'
2011-04-07T20:04:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 yes i had to do shut off the computer at times
2011-04-07T20:05:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	 because i couldnt shut it down normally
2011-04-07T20:05:00.000Z	compdoc	pumeust	well at least the drive's smart thinks the disk hardware is healthy, so you just need to concentrate on repairing the partition
2011-04-07T20:08:00.000Z	pumeust	compdoc	no i dont know how to check on reallocated sectors other than what i just typed
