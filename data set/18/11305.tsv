2006-08-15T05:35:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	I just bought the motherboard and the Ethernet is OnBoard. It *should* support IPv6, just as the router *should* support it.
2006-08-15T05:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	it has nothing to do with your router or your network card, in fact, the protocol doesn't work on that layer. The problem is, most DNS servers do not support ipv6, so when you try to query a domain in firefox, it will query using ipv6, then time out, then query using ipv4. That's why it takes time to "look up" domains.
2006-08-15T05:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	if you disable ipv6, this lag will go away.
2006-08-15T05:37:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	Ah. The wiki made it sound like the hardware being outdated being the problem.
2006-08-15T05:38:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	So, basically, the DNS I'm trying to query doesn't support the protocol and that's why it times out?
2006-08-15T05:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	technically, your the server is only listening on ipv4, not ipv6 addresess, but your analogy is correct.
2006-08-15T05:41:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	Aye. Thanks for the troubleshooting. I'll reboot and see if that did it. ;)
2006-08-19T13:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	your windows box probably have the dns lookups cached. Could be an issue with your dns servers. Can you dig the domain without problems?
2006-08-19T13:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	dig yahoo.com from a command prompt
2006-08-19T13:59:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	digging yahoo.com on Ubuntu works fine.
2006-08-19T13:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	dig wikipedia.org
2006-08-19T13:59:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	also works
2006-08-19T14:00:00.000Z	pluma	fyrestrtr	yet Firefox times out on look up
2006-08-19T14:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	and you sure you disabled ipv6 in firefox?
2006-08-19T14:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pluma	yes
