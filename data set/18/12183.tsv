2006-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	Zane42		I'm trying to get an app for ubuntu that supports nzb.
2006-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	Zane42		It looks like dapper has a package called nzb.
2006-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	Zane42		But it's not available for breezy?
2006-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	Zane42		Tried it watnu can't get it to work either.
2006-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	Zane42		I've got the default perl install.
2006-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	Zane42		That may be the reason.
2006-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	Zane42		I don't know.
2006-05-17T07:15:00.000Z	watnu	Zane42	SABnzb-0.1.8 ?
2006-05-17T07:15:00.000Z	Zane42	watnu	ok I'll give it a try.
2006-05-17T07:15:00.000Z	Zane42		it's the ./configure gives an error.
2006-05-17T07:17:00.000Z	watnu		!beer
2006-05-17T07:17:00.000Z	watnu		:)
2006-05-17T07:18:00.000Z	Zane42	watnu	when I try ./configure in nzbget I get the following: configure: error: "libxml2 header files were not found in /usr/include/libxml2."
2006-05-17T07:21:00.000Z	Zane42	watnu	I have libxml2 it's jsut  apparently not where it expects it to be any idea?
2006-05-17T07:22:00.000Z	Zane42		I'm trying to install nzbget
2006-05-17T07:22:00.000Z	Zane42		so yeah...
2006-05-17T07:22:00.000Z	Zane42		unless I can find the package somewhere.
2006-05-17T07:23:00.000Z	watnu	Zane42	man symlink, to tell the application where to find
