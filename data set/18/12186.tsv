2006-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		for future reference, the problem i had with vmware installation was related to the package "linux-headers" for my specific kernel.  to get the right headers the command i used was "sudo apt-get install linux-headers$(uname -r)"
2006-06-24T09:37:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		if anybody asks about that in here, now i (and whoever read that) will have that in an IRC log
2006-06-24T09:39:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i'd think there would be a 686 build since i use a pentium 4 processor
2006-06-24T09:39:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	just install the 686
2006-06-24T09:40:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	tronica	i can install a 686 kernel?
2006-06-24T09:40:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		also, would i benefit from using that kernel?
2006-06-24T09:40:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	if its a HT proc then get the smp kernel
2006-06-24T09:41:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	heres guide http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=85917

2006-06-24T09:42:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	you want the 2.6 kernel
2006-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	isntall the 2.6 kernel
2006-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i'm curious, why would i have found a package for 2.4.27 when everything is running on 2.6.15 now?  i didn't install it and used the guide tronica suggested instead
2006-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		!language
2006-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	not sure why the 2.4's are still there.
2006-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		2.6 is stable, innit?
2006-06-24T09:45:00.000Z	tronica	ToHellWithGA	its very stable
