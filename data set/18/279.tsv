2012-05-30T12:49:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	to make sure run: umount /mnt/{proc,sys,dev,boot,usr,var,home}
2012-05-30T12:50:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	nothing else is mounted under /mnt
2012-05-30T12:38:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	chroot and run grub-install /dev/sda
2012-05-30T12:40:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	chroot fails with some stupid error about /bin/sh
2012-05-30T12:41:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	what's the error?
2012-05-30T12:45:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	chroot can't execute '/bin/sh': Exec format error
2012-05-30T12:46:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	try chroot /mnt /bin/bash
2012-05-30T12:46:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	and this is assuming you have sda1 mounted there
2012-05-30T12:46:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	yup sda on mnt both disc and os are 64 bit
2012-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	basically same error
2012-05-30T12:49:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	type "mount" to see if anything is mounted inside /mnt to prevent your from unmounting
2012-05-30T12:51:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	lsof | grep mnt
2012-05-30T12:51:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	kill whatever process shows up
2012-05-30T12:52:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	I'm in the 12.04 installer disc rescue mode , lsof isn't even on it
2012-05-30T12:52:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	do you have any terminals that are sitting in /mnt?
2012-05-30T12:53:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	there is only 1 terminal, it's a fresh boot
2012-05-30T12:58:00.000Z	wawowe	wildint	how did sda1 get mounted in the first place?
2012-05-30T13:08:00.000Z	wildint	wawowe	I mounted it myself
