2008-08-19T14:33:00.000Z	Expl0ited		Ok UXRVT I need to know if there is anyway to change any of its options, and if I can where do I do it at?
2008-08-19T14:34:00.000Z	Expl0ited		rxvt is a better teminal emulator.
2008-08-19T14:35:00.000Z	Expl0ited		I don't want opinions thanks, just how to change RXVT's options thanks
2008-08-19T14:36:00.000Z	unop	Expl0ited	what kind of options?
2008-08-19T14:37:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	I want to change background colors and stuff, or atleast its palatte.
2008-08-19T14:37:00.000Z	unop	Expl0ited	in ~/.Xdefaults
2008-08-19T14:37:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	thanks :D
2008-08-19T14:37:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	wait, there is nothing with that name in ~/
2008-08-19T14:38:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	rxvt doesn't have its own config files?
2008-08-19T14:39:00.000Z	unop	Expl0ited	not really no .. without that file, rxvt uses its defaults
2008-08-19T14:40:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	there is this when I type 'locate rxvt' :
2008-08-19T14:40:00.000Z	unop	Expl0ited	don't paste in here
2008-08-19T14:41:00.000Z	unop	Expl0ited	if you want to adjust rxvt settings.. create an ~/.Xdefaults file and add your settings in
2008-08-19T14:41:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	I found the examples file :( Im an idiot ...
2008-08-19T14:42:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	true that.
2008-08-28T02:37:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	why would nice values really matter?
2008-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	unop	Expl0ited	because sometimes you want your X apps to have a lower nice value than system services
2008-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	Expl0ited	unop	oh I see...
