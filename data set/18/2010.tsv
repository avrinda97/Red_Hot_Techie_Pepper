2010-12-29T22:56:00.000Z	mpgutta		hi. could anyone please tell me how to install postgresql9.0 on ubuntu 8.04, i could not find apt- package for the same.
2010-12-29T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	someone may have packaged it for Hardy
2010-12-29T23:06:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	i found this ppa for Lucid and Maverick at https://launchpad.net/~pitti/+archive/postgresql but couldnt get one for Hardy
2010-12-29T23:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	no other ppa has it?
2010-12-29T23:08:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	it seems Martin Pitt is the guy who maintains postgresql packages for ubuntu
2010-12-29T23:09:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	from his link i cant find for Hardy
2010-12-29T23:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	then i'd hit him up to see whats what.
2010-12-29T23:10:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	so what are the otherways i can install postgres 9.0 on ubuntu 8.04?
2010-12-29T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	not sure dude, Hardy dies in April so an upgrade may be in order
2010-12-29T23:14:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	ok sure.  i will try that.
2010-12-29T23:14:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	so you mean no support for 8.04 from april?

2010-12-29T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	unless you installed hardy erver
2010-12-29T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	i'd contact martin, see what he says
2010-12-29T23:17:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	thank you so much!
2010-12-29T23:21:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	i have run "uname -a" to know whether i am running server or desktop. here is the output "Linux ialeia 2.6.18-xen #1 SMP Tue Feb 12 06:40:50 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux" so is this server or desktop?
2010-12-29T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mpgutta	not sure about the xen kernel.If you have a desktop with a mouse pointer and an X server and desktop icons, you are running the desktop OS
2010-12-29T23:26:00.000Z	mpgutta	ActionParsnip	we have hosting with slicehost. so probably it should be server.
