2004-12-26T07:55:00.000Z	__learner__		I made a XFREE86 modeline using the specs at the http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl site. Where is the XF86Config file I need to change?
2004-12-26T07:56:00.000Z	__learner__		will that work in ubuntu?
2004-12-26T07:56:00.000Z	daniels	__learner__	it's in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2004-12-26T07:56:00.000Z	daniels		but why do you need to make a modeline?  are things not working for you currently?
2004-12-26T07:56:00.000Z	__learner__		tx
2004-12-26T07:58:00.000Z	__learner__		yes they are, but are not at maximum. My monitor (LG F700P) runs at 100hz(1024x768) with no problems, I'm used to it on windows. In ubuntu it is working at 85hz, I want to get it to 100.
2004-12-26T07:58:00.000Z	__learner__		it can handle more than that but I don't feel secure to do it.
2004-12-26T07:58:00.000Z	daniels	__learner__	edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, don't worry about the ModeLine, just remove the lines starting with HorizSync and VertRefresh
2004-12-26T07:59:00.000Z	__learner__	daniels	what is that supposed to do?
2004-12-26T07:59:00.000Z	__learner__		My ubuntu worked only at 60hz out of the box.
2004-12-26T08:03:00.000Z	__learner__		Should I change HorizSync VertRefresh to the specs of my monitor?  or is preferable to use the modeline generated by the site?
2004-12-26T08:04:00.000Z	daniels	__learner__	it should probe your monitor for the resolution ranges it supports, instead of guessing and getting it wrong
2004-12-26T08:04:00.000Z	daniels	__learner__	this has been fixed in our development tree
2004-12-26T08:05:00.000Z	__learner__	daniels	this is not what happened during install? Probe - Noanswer - 60Hz?
2004-12-26T08:06:00.000Z	__learner__		is this
2004-12-26T08:10:00.000Z	daniels	__learner__	sorry, I don't really follow
2004-12-26T08:13:00.000Z	__learner__	daniels	Is it not what happened by first. When I installed ubuntu, my monitor was only running at 60hz. Because of that I think that detection does not work here.
2004-12-26T08:14:00.000Z	daniels	__learner__	ah, right
