2005-02-17T12:22:00.000Z	randabis		oh well, she used all her gift money anyway
2005-02-17T12:23:00.000Z	randabis		I think this is getting way off-topic..:/
2005-02-17T12:25:00.000Z	randabis		compression
2005-02-17T12:25:00.000Z	randabis		and to divide large files into smaller ones
2005-02-17T12:25:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	heh.. the data is as compressed as it can be.. rar can maybe shave off like 2%, by just taking reoccurring blocks or something
2005-02-17T12:26:00.000Z	randabis	sulkd	well it's more for dividing them up..in the cases where that doesn't apply, I'm not sure...
2005-02-27T12:28:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	broke?
2005-02-27T12:29:00.000Z	randabis	sulkd	yeah it won't let me sudo
2005-02-27T12:30:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	hehe... then you have no choice but to put "init=/bin/bash" into your /boot/grub/menu.lst and reboot and change it..
2005-02-27T12:31:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	just put it at the "kernel" line... then remove it when you're done fixing your system
2005-02-27T12:31:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	put it at the end of the line.. the parsing is slightly fubar
2005-02-27T12:31:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	and no quotes
2005-02-27T12:32:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	just something like kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-3-k7 root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet splash init=/bin/bash
2005-02-27T12:33:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	or wait... selecting that "recovery mode" thing at boot might also work, I guess
2005-02-27T12:33:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	try the recovery mode
2005-02-27T12:38:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	everything ok again?
2005-02-27T12:38:00.000Z	randabis	sulkd	no lol
2005-02-27T12:39:00.000Z	sulkd	randabis	did you try hitting escape just before boot and selecting "recovery mode" ?
