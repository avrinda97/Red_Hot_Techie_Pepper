2008-02-22T19:14:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo		can anyone help me set up ssh for secure vnc? i tried once before and i couldnt get anything to work
2008-02-22T19:16:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	try something like ssh -C -L888:192.168.2.3:123 vncuser@vnchost.net
2008-02-22T19:17:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	then connect VNC to localhost:888
2008-02-22T19:17:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Wander_w	and there is no setup involved
2008-02-22T19:17:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	not appart from logging in
2008-02-22T19:18:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	Oh and just for your information: -C turns on compression (which is also very usefull with scp)
2008-02-22T19:19:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Wander_w	so then what is all this stuff i iread about needing putty and stuff, setting up keys etc
2008-02-22T19:19:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	um... putty is for Windows right?
2008-02-22T19:20:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	everything is more difficult in windows :P
2008-02-22T19:21:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	But you might want to set up public/private keys, but that is just for convenience, you won't have to enter your password anymore
2008-02-22T19:27:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Wander_w	how do i do that, and does this work if i want to vnc in from windwos to a linux machine with ssh
2008-02-22T19:30:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	Sorry, I can't help you with Windows
2008-02-22T19:42:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	I got Putty running with Wine! Try this:
2008-02-22T19:43:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	open a new connection with putty, but before connecting, go to connection->SSH->tunnels
2008-02-22T19:45:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Wander_w	i need to resetup ssh though
2008-02-22T19:45:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	Wander_w	ive unistalled everything, and like i said i would like froms cratch, and hopefully setup everything up right
2008-02-22T19:46:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	um... so you have no server to connect to?
2008-02-22T19:48:00.000Z	Wander_w	ForzaPalermo	ok, so install SSH on the linux server first
