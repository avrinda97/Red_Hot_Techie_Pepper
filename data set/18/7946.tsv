2007-12-24T13:14:00.000Z	oddworld		flash is making firefox freeze, i have most recent version. any ideas?
2007-12-24T13:14:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	when watching videos on youtube?
2007-12-24T13:14:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	does your sound distort?
2007-12-24T13:15:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	Unfortunately, I haven't found a concrete solution...you could try this...

2007-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	Don't quote me here, but I'm pretty sure that Gnash doesn't play youtube videos
2007-12-24T13:17:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	you could take a look at gnash, if that "fix" doesn't work
2007-12-24T13:18:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	no luck?
2007-12-24T13:21:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	if you installed locally, I guess you could just remove the .so file found in /home/yournamehere/.mozilla/plugins
2007-12-24T13:23:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	move the file to the desktop and then do a "about:plugins" in firefox...you'll see that firefox no longer thinks flash is installed.
2007-12-24T13:27:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	everything is slow?
2007-12-24T13:27:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	ah. I see
2007-12-24T13:27:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	you could try gnash now...the open-source alternative
2007-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	i'm about to compile gnash and see how it performs
2007-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	in all honesty, i've never tried it
2007-12-24T13:31:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	i'll let you know how gnash turns out...
2007-12-24T13:48:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	for me yes...it's the only thing that's caused me problems with linux
2007-12-24T13:48:00.000Z	isaacj87	oddworld	everything else has been great
