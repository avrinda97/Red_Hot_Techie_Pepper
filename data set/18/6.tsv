2004-10-09T09:30:00.000Z	joem	mdz	do the new kernel images released have any sort of ide changes?
2004-10-09T09:30:00.000Z	mdz	joem	not specifically, no. are you having a problem?
2004-10-09T09:32:00.000Z	mdz	joem	what was the last kernel where it worked?
2004-10-09T09:33:00.000Z	mdz	joem	and what is the error message you see?
2004-10-09T09:33:00.000Z	joem	mdz	hold on, I'll get the bug#
2004-10-09T09:34:00.000Z	mdz	joem	I see, so this is a problem with the install CD?
2004-10-09T09:35:00.000Z	mdz	joem	the new kernel has not propagated onto the install CDs yet
2004-10-09T09:37:00.000Z	mdz	joem	what is the error message that you see when it fails?
2004-10-09T09:38:00.000Z	mdz	joem	I mean in the installer
2004-10-09T09:38:00.000Z	mdz	joem	there are two different dialogs which contain the text "No common CD-ROM drive was detected"
2004-10-09T09:39:00.000Z	mdz	joem	one asks if you want to load drivers from a floppy, and the other offers to let you select a cd-rom driver. which one did you see?
2004-10-09T09:39:00.000Z	joem	mdz	list
2004-10-09T09:41:00.000Z	mdz	joem	please attach the complete dmesg output to the bug
2004-10-09T09:42:00.000Z	mdz	joem	when you boot the installed system, do you get the same problem or a different one?
2004-10-09T09:42:00.000Z	joem	mdz	same issue
2004-10-09T09:51:00.000Z	joem	mdz	added dmesg output to bug..hope it helps
2004-10-31T16:55:00.000Z	mdz	joem	you can still use a static /dev
2004-10-31T16:56:00.000Z	joem	mdz	yea, I didn't know if that was a udev or distro specific option
