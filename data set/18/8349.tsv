2007-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	wm-seabrook		my friend, who's in a different country, is TRYING to try out ubuntu, but she's having trouble booting from the cd she burnt
2007-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	wm-seabrook		she's tried esc, f12, f10, f5, all kinds of stuff when it boots, to choose to boot from cd
2007-09-01T09:54:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	did she try the alternate install CD as well?
2007-09-01T09:54:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	the alternate install CD?
2007-09-01T09:55:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	Yes.  There are two installation CDs -- one that is a LIVE-CD with a full GUI that allows you to test the OS out before installing and another that does a basic text install.
2007-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	what happens when she tries?
2007-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	she says that no matter what key she tries to use to override the booting via harddrive, it still just continues on into windows
2007-09-01T10:03:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	varies widely by manufacturer and generation -- what kind of system does she have?
2007-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	she doesn't exactly know, because it was built for her
2007-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	how would she get that relevant information? type of BIOS? no clue
2007-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	system setup like before windows?
2007-09-01T10:05:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	yes, at POST.  There should be a keystroke that will let her make configuration changes to the BIOS
2007-09-01T10:05:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	how do we find out which keystroke that is?
2007-09-01T10:05:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	one of those changes should be boot sequence.
2007-09-01T10:06:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	will do
2007-09-01T10:07:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	there's apparently an intel screen...
2007-09-01T10:09:00.000Z	TexasTwister	wm-seabrook	I'm not familiar with all the BIOSs out there.  You'll still need to google for more info.
2007-09-01T10:10:00.000Z	wm-seabrook	TexasTwister	hoping maybe intel was all standard or something... :P hehe. we'll try to get more information and google for the keystroke. thanks!
