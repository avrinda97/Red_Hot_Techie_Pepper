2008-11-28T02:08:00.000Z	alex_mayorga		what should I install on a Celeron 300 Mhz 192 MB old PC?
2008-11-28T02:09:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	MSDOS
2008-11-28T02:09:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	private_meta	I was looking for something more linux based :)
2008-11-28T02:09:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	i know, i know ;)
2008-11-28T02:10:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	you can save a lot if you're willing to work without an x-server
2008-11-28T02:11:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	private_meta	this is for the janitor kids so we need a GUI
2008-11-28T02:11:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	oh... k, but that might be another problem... if you're installing any current ubuntu system, any games those kids might want to play is rather out
2008-11-28T02:11:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	that computer can't even run supertux >_>
2008-11-28T02:18:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	actually, I'd kinda recommend that as well, something like win '98
2008-11-28T02:19:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	private_meta	I rather keep them away from bug#1 :)
2008-11-28T02:19:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	y'know, you can get computers twice the speed of that one, almost for free
2008-11-28T02:20:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	depends, look what's in there
2008-11-28T02:21:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	ain't mexico kinda deadly these last months?
2008-11-28T02:22:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	private_meta	don't believe all that you see in the news, I've managed to survive down here for 26 years, knock on wood :)
2008-11-28T02:23:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	may i query you?
2008-11-28T02:24:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	private_meta	on what?
2008-11-28T02:24:00.000Z	private_meta	alex_mayorga	just 'bout burying news preoccupations
