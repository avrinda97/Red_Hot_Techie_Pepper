2007-08-04T05:48:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	Is your password 'password'?
2007-08-04T05:49:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	aptitude install sshd
2007-08-04T05:50:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	^^ how you install sftp
2007-08-04T05:50:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	And that is much more secure than ftp
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	ffm	MajorPayne	I have OpenSSH installed, I just dont know how to setup sftp.
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	It should be already set up.
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	ffm	MajorPayne	how do i use it then?
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	With sftp.
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	Or psftp is a good alternative if you are on Windows.
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	ffm	MajorPayne	is that included with the windows package?
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	No, psftp is a download.  The p stands for putty, you can download it off the putty website.
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	ffm	MajorPayne	I already have putty.
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	Yea, psftp is not putty.
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	But you can get it off the same website.
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	ffm	MajorPayne	does it have a gui?
2007-08-04T05:53:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ffm	No.  I can't give any advice on GUI sftp clients.  They are out there.
