2012-10-12T01:42:00.000Z	Lasivian		but, I should get at least one windows box showing up, there are 6 on the network
2012-10-12T01:43:00.000Z	Lasivian		installing that now
2012-10-12T01:43:00.000Z	Lasivian		one of the ubuntu boxes is 12.04, the other is 10.10
2012-10-12T01:44:00.000Z	Lasivian		gigolo worked
2012-10-12T01:45:00.000Z	Lasivian		the idea that an ubuntu software error would affect both machines seems impossible
2012-10-12T01:46:00.000Z	Lasivian		hrrm, I thought *.10 were the LTS..
2012-10-12T01:46:00.000Z	Lasivian		perhaps, I was mistaken :)
2012-10-12T01:46:00.000Z	Lasivian		I see, guess I need to just change that machine to 12.04
2012-10-12T01:47:00.000Z	Lasivian		and i'm betting there is no upgrade path to do such a thing, heh
2012-10-12T01:49:00.000Z	Lasivian		is there any easy way to go from a .10 install to a .04?
2012-10-12T01:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Lasivian	look above at the ubotto comment on eol.
2012-10-12T01:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		ubottu*
2012-10-12T01:50:00.000Z	Lasivian		yeah, the EOL upgrade link stops at 9.10
2012-10-12T01:50:00.000Z	Lasivian	jrib	dammit, stop pointing out my flawed statements! :)
2012-10-12T01:51:00.000Z	Lasivian		what should I do with 10.10, I can erase it, but i've made multiple edits
2012-10-12T01:52:00.000Z	Lasivian		so, 3 upgrades
2012-10-12T01:52:00.000Z	Lasivian		that sounds, painful, heh
2012-10-12T01:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Lasivian	Try reading this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades  the upgrade will have to be a eol upgrade TheLordOfTime
