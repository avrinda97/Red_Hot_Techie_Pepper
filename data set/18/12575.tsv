2006-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	harisund		Does anyone know of a good VPN solution? I want to access my 192.168.5.0/24 subnet at home from outside. What is the best solution?
2006-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	thor	harisund	are you running linux at home?
2006-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	harisund	thor	Indeed!
2006-10-25T05:33:00.000Z	thor	harisund	open one port on the linux box...a weird one like 54987
2006-10-25T05:33:00.000Z	thor	harisund	then run sshd off that port.
2006-10-25T05:33:00.000Z	harisund	thor	yes, I am doing that.
2006-10-25T05:33:00.000Z	thor	harisund	you can ssh -x to that port...that puts you in the linux box
2006-10-25T05:34:00.000Z	harisund	thor	I have plenty of services running on my Ubuntu boxes here. .. I can' keep opening ports on my router .. well, I could but that kind of defeats the purpose
2006-10-25T05:34:00.000Z	harisund		those Yes, I am familiar with what you are seeing and that is the short term solution I am adopting now.
2006-10-25T05:34:00.000Z	thor		harisund:no no....your router only has one open port.....to one box
2006-10-25T05:34:00.000Z	harisund	thor	Yes, I understand what you are saying. What I am saying is that my equirements are more than just the SSH port.
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund		rag what do you mean where is kernel?
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund		rag what do you want to do?
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	thor	harisund	you can open more than one port...but every port you open increases the security risk
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund	thor	which is precisely why I want a VPN solution
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund		rag yes, UBuntu doesn't ship with the kernel sources by default
2006-10-25T05:36:00.000Z	harisund		rag you will have to download it .. I believe the sources are called linux-source-$(uname -r) or something like that.
2006-10-25T05:36:00.000Z	thor	harisund	right...the way I set my home network up I had total access to all my linux and windows boxes, via 'ssh -x'
