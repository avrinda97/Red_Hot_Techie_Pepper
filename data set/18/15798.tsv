2005-05-23T07:22:00.000Z	brokenladder		old hd
2005-05-23T07:22:00.000Z	brokenladder		it's terrible how apps in the panel are named like "text editor" instead of "gedit" with the comment being "text editor".  You can change it, but it will be overwritten the next time you upgrade.
2005-05-23T07:23:00.000Z	brokenladder		kde is atrocious.
2005-05-23T07:23:00.000Z	brokenladder		it does do some things better than gnome ,but it is so ugly.
2005-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	brokenladder		I like being able to use kde apps in gnome when i like.  freedesktop standards are a good thing.
2005-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	brokenladder		personally, i think there needs to be something analogous to free desktop for linux distros.  so that they all use the same settings files and such.
2005-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	brokenladder		the linux "market" needs to be unfragmented.
