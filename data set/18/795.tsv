2011-09-04T19:51:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	no idea
2011-09-04T19:51:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	the boot sector is on the masterboot sector of the disk, not the file ysstem, so I suspect you hav enot installed the master boot record properly
2011-09-04T19:53:00.000Z	angelicalmaddr2	ikonia	, i always used the same method (usb creator from live cd) whatever the file system ive tryed
2011-09-04T19:53:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	that doesn't change what I've said
2011-09-04T19:56:00.000Z	angelicalmaddr2	ikonia	, do you have some idea i can try?
2011-09-04T20:01:00.000Z	angelicalmaddr2	ikonia	, i have no dual boot , does master boot still applies?
2011-09-04T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	correct

2011-09-04T20:11:00.000Z	angelicalmaddr2	ikonia	ill install ubuntu on a ext4 partition and system will get stuck on motherboard logo. i will need to disconnect the usb pen drive in order to proceed with the live cd. what do i need to do next?
2011-09-04T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	just burn an install CD and install from that, it will be easlier
2011-09-04T20:13:00.000Z	angelicalmaddr2	ikonia	that is what i always do but it only boots when i use a 16fat formatted partition
2011-09-04T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	I suspect you are installing the boot loader wrong
2011-09-04T20:15:00.000Z	angelicalmaddr2	ikonia	installing boot loader?  dont see no option about boot loader when using install cd
2011-09-04T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	angelicalmaddr2	it's called grub
