2006-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	matthewf		hey people, ubuntu has installed ok on my system and all but the included media player app is very very broken on my setup audio and video freeze and lock up after about 30 seconds of playback ..
2006-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	tried any other players?
2006-08-27T05:44:00.000Z	matthewf	DeeTahPanLtah	no, not yet, the app im trying to use is Xfplay i think, ive tryed diffrent renderer options etc but it keeps failing... then again im not sure which renderer i should be useing for my hardware, or which audio device
2006-08-27T05:45:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	but first 30secs run properly?
2006-08-27T05:46:00.000Z	matthewf	DeeTahPanLtah	happen to know which renderer/audio device i should be useing ? if i am running a Nvidia card and VIA Vinyl 6 Trac Channel audio ?
2006-08-27T05:47:00.000Z	matthewf	DeeTahPanLtah	will have to boot the machine again to have a look
2006-08-27T05:54:00.000Z	matthewf	DeeTahPanLtah	how can i tell for sure if X is fully accelerated video wise ?
2006-08-27T05:54:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	xglinfo?
2006-08-27T05:55:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	lemme check
2006-08-27T05:55:00.000Z	matthewf	DeeTahPanLtah	ahhh.. thats the one .. i think
2006-08-27T05:56:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	what exactly you mean?
2006-08-27T05:58:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	then you probably don't have the acceleration,install correct drivers ;)
2006-08-27T05:58:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	nvidia?
2006-08-27T05:59:00.000Z	matthewf	DeeTahPanLtah	yep... tis a crappy FX 5200 on a VIA EPIA C3 board
2006-08-27T05:59:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	try installing nvidia-glx
2006-08-27T06:12:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	is it a problem?
2006-08-27T06:13:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	matthewf	i'd risk removing it and let your package manager take it over
