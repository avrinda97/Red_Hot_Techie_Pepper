2009-09-15T05:22:00.000Z	josh		is there something wrong with the feisty package repo?
2009-09-15T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	uhmm I guess so,  since fesity is no longer supported
2009-09-15T05:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	maybe the server version has support just about still,  but the desktop nope
2009-09-15T05:23:00.000Z	josh	sebsebseb	yes, but why then are older versions still on the server?
2009-09-15T05:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	Is it the server version?
2009-09-15T05:24:00.000Z	josh	sebsebseb	yes
2009-09-15T05:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	ok for proper servers 8.04 is recommended, that's also the LTS
2009-09-15T05:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	if your on edgy, it would be much easier to clean install
2009-09-15T05:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	I guess the repos are still there for versions such as 7.04  since yes got to go through versions,   but they don't have to add other updates to them,   except the server updates if that's still supported
2009-09-15T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	that's unlucky in a way, if it had been 6.06  you could have upgraded directly to 8.04
2009-09-15T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	now you have to go through  7.04 and  7.10  to  upgrade
2009-09-15T05:27:00.000Z	josh	sebsebseb	but if I change edgy in sources.list to feisty I just get a bunch of 404 errors on apt-get update
2009-09-15T05:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	I think I have been in here before,  when other people have had similar problems to yours
2009-09-15T05:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	It would be easier for you to clean install and put 8.04 server on
2009-09-15T05:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	or would it hmm, what kind of server you got?
2009-09-15T05:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	yeah with the LTS's at least
2009-09-15T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	ok mirrors
2009-09-15T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh	on the desktop  version,  you can change the mirror and get the updates  from some where else, I don't know about the server
