2005-04-18T05:41:00.000Z	inter	akk	isn't there away to just tell ubuntu _not_ to load a service without blowing it away?
2005-04-18T05:41:00.000Z	akk	inter	I finally ended up writing a script that keeps a list of services I want turned off: it calls apt-get update, apt-get -f dist-upgrade, then update-rc.d for each disabled service.
2005-04-18T05:41:00.000Z	inter	akk	ugh
2005-04-18T05:41:00.000Z	inter	akk	sounds like the debian boot services standard needs some work
2005-04-18T05:42:00.000Z	akk	inter	Yes, it does.  But debian people seem happy with it.  I don't know about rconf, that njan just mentioned, though.
2005-04-18T05:42:00.000Z	akk	inter	The funny thing is: it's such a FAQ that debian has a bunch of pages about complicated-and-temporary ways to do it
2005-04-18T05:42:00.000Z	akk	inter	with rude remarks aimed at people who want something more permanent.
2005-04-18T05:43:00.000Z	inter	akk	well...I think i'll just remove the symlinks manually o_O
2005-04-18T05:43:00.000Z	inter	akk	debian ppl aren't always the niecest ;)
2005-04-18T05:43:00.000Z	inter	akk	nicest*
2005-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	akk	inter	They refer people who want non-rude behavior to ubuntu. :-)
2005-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	akk	inter	(actually there are lots of nice debian people, in addition to the less nice ones)
2005-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	inter	akk	hehe...or a stable distro that isn't 10yrs old
2005-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	inter	akk	ah...i liked the gentoo ppl the most
2005-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	inter	akk	just my expereince though
2005-04-18T05:45:00.000Z	inter	akk	don't ;)
2005-04-18T05:45:00.000Z	inter	akk	nice ppl...bad distro idea
