2010-07-26T07:42:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	yeah, its not particularly difficult to do that.  are you trying to do this: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Image:Standard_bridge_large.jpg ? if so, you shouldn't need hostap
2010-07-26T07:43:00.000Z	hypetech		Randy_ that's exactly what I'm trying to do
2010-07-26T07:44:00.000Z	hypetech	randy_	I'm connecting my laptop to my wireless router as normal, then I'm using the ethernet port on the laptop to share the connection to a computer, and that works fine.  I also want to share to a second computer though, and when I hook the shared ethernet connection from the laptop into a switch, both clients won't work
2010-07-26T07:47:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	no big deal.  did you assign IP addresses manually?
2010-07-26T07:47:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	are you doing connection sharing through something like firestarter?
2010-07-26T07:48:00.000Z	hypetech	randy_	I tried that, the connection sharing in ubuntu creates a new 10. network while my router's network is 192., so I assigned manual 10. to both the clients I was trying to connect to the switch but they still wouldn't work at the same time
2010-07-26T07:48:00.000Z	hypetech		I'm just doing sharing through NetworkManager
2010-07-26T07:49:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	yeah, connection sharing doesn't quite work right in Network Manager... reluctantly.  ok. let me guess, you assigned 192.168.(something).10 to *both* computers
2010-07-26T07:49:00.000Z	hypetech	randy_	no.  I mean the connection sharing creates a 10.x.x.x network and no I didn't give them both the same address :p
2010-07-26T07:50:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	ok ok, you understand of course why i would ask ;) just taking care of the easy stuff first ;)
2010-07-26T07:50:00.000Z	hypetech	randy_	no worries :)
2010-07-26T07:51:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	now, the way i would do it is much simpler than dealing with NetworkManager, even though it *seems* more difficult at first.  we can install and verify, rather quickly, through the command line, whether or not this works, which of course it will.  there are only a few steps to this.
2010-07-26T07:51:00.000Z	hypetech	randy_	sure I'm willing to give anything a shot
2010-07-26T07:53:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	step 1) wireless connectivity (the bridge).  step 2) turn on routing (hella important) step 3) assign a network to the ethernet port.  step 4) assign IP's from that network to devices on the switch plugged into the ethernet port)
2010-07-26T07:56:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	there are (2) ways we can do this, depending on which one you would prefer.  would you like to (a) extend your network so that you don't have a sub-subnet for the switch or (b) would you like a true wireless bridge that allows DHCP to reach the connection-shared devices?
2010-07-26T07:56:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	wait, that was the same option worded differently.  the other option is a sub-subnet like you've been trying to do up to this point
2010-07-26T07:57:00.000Z	hypetech	randy_	whichever is easier, I can manually assign the addresses easily enough if necessary.  I don't need them on a different subnet than the main internal network
2010-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	randy_	hypetech	you should probably pm me, so we can go through this ;)
