2012-11-09T22:46:00.000Z	linux|newb		...was gonna say - thought 12.10 only had two years :-s
2012-11-09T22:48:00.000Z	linux|newb		anyone got display issues with chrome using an ATI card?
2012-11-09T22:48:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	I have display issue with chrome with no card? lol
2012-11-09T22:49:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	ATI drivers though?
2012-11-09T22:50:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	well no, no graphics card in the machine, display errors such as white only screen (using vnc to connect). what display error do you get?
2012-11-09T22:51:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	o, my bad. stuff just doesn't render right. I'm guessing a lot of jscript content  because it's especially bad on facebook
2012-11-09T22:51:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	chrome or chromium?
2012-11-09T22:51:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	chrome.
2012-11-09T22:51:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	never used chrome only chromium
2012-11-09T22:52:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	and chromium works fine but I annoys me that I can't get it working right on chrome
2012-11-09T22:52:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	any reason why you need chrome?
2012-11-09T22:53:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	no... like I say, it's just become a point of contention for me :P
2012-11-09T22:54:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	chromium pairs with your google account, right? I used it a long time back but before all the services were partnered...
2012-11-09T22:54:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	oh i see, well I suggest you use chromium, I hear that chrome itself isn't as good. and they are the same apps anyway, just different icons, it looks like that anyway.
2012-11-09T22:54:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	it pairs with my google account yea
2012-11-09T22:55:00.000Z	linux|newb	Linkandzelda	sweet. might just bite the bullet and stop being such a purist
2012-11-09T22:56:00.000Z	Linkandzelda	linux|newb	its worth it imo
