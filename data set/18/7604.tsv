2007-12-11T04:33:00.000Z	eurowerke		I'm having a problem keeping my static ip address
2007-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	eurowerke		I set the config up in /etc/network/interfaces
2007-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	eurowerke		but as soon as the regular dhcp lease time expires, it renews to another IP address
2007-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	eurowerke		anyone have a clue?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	eurowerke		why does it time out in the first place?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	eurowerke		can't I just keep it static?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	don't try ping -f
2007-12-11T04:36:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	it's either dhcp, either static
2007-12-11T04:36:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	when it's dhcp it's up to the dhcp server to give you the same ip
2007-12-11T04:37:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	then it should have nothing to do with dhcp
2007-12-11T04:38:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	have you tried setting it from System Settings ?
2007-12-11T04:44:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	could you paste in pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file ?
2007-12-11T04:49:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	everything seems ok, I don't understand how the dhcp client might start
2007-12-11T04:50:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	can you check if it's running now ?
2007-12-11T04:57:00.000Z	eurowerke	georgeb	you mean if dhclient is running?
2007-12-11T04:57:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	yep.. it might be some dhcpcd or dhcpclient running somewhere over there.. ps -ef | grep dhcp :)
2007-12-11T05:03:00.000Z	eurowerke	georgeb	it held the static IP after reboot
2007-12-11T05:05:00.000Z	georgeb	eurowerke	np
