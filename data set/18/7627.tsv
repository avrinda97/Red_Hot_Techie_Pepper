2010-06-08T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	That actually sounds like a feature that upstream grub might be willing to add. You should propose it.
2010-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	Those livecds are mostly based on partimage.
2010-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	parted != partimage.
2010-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	http://partedmagic.com/ The Parted Magic OS employs core programs of GParted and Parted to handle partitioning tasks with ease, while featuring other useful programs (e.g. Partimage, TestDisk, Truecrypt, G4L, SuperGrubDisk, ddrescue, etc...)  and it's got a nice tmpfs setup.
2010-06-08T10:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	Do you happen to know what version of super grub disk they include? super grub disk isn't mentioned at all in http://partedmagic.com/programs.html (and there's at least one live distro using a really early version of super grub2 disk that's so old it's practically useless)
2010-06-08T10:24:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	Not sure, sec while I fire it up in vbox
2010-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	There's two listed. Super Grub Disk 1 and Super Grub Disk 2. Super Grub Disk 1 is "0.97-os.1"
2010-06-08T10:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	/msg ubottu factoid is foo
2010-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	Super Grub Disk 2 is "1.96"
2010-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	Ugh, that's 2 year old grub code, and has almost no features.
2010-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	post it in the parted magic forums -- he's real quick about updating stuff like that.
2010-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	Will do.
2010-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	I'd do it myself; but I lack the domain knowledge you exhibit to be able to satisfy him.
2010-06-08T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	"sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" to change the setting for which devices are installed to on grub upgrades
2010-06-08T12:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	Manually? That's what Super GRUB2 Disk is for :)
2010-06-08T12:59:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	Noooooooope. I doubt it'd be able to find which partition, kernel, and initrd in the mess of EFI partitions on my work boxes ;)
2010-06-08T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kamilion	It won't detect kernels if you have a separate /boot, but it will detect grub.cfg files and let you use that :)
2010-06-08T13:01:00.000Z	Kamilion	Jordan_U	Oooh, now that's handy. Usually I have grub4dos set up to do that.
