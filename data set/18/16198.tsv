2005-04-08T10:18:00.000Z	projectmayhem		eclipse maybe you are getting that because your graphics driver is not functioning?
2005-04-08T10:18:00.000Z	projectmayhem		nvidia driver not working = slow graphics
2005-04-08T10:19:00.000Z	projectmayhem		eclipse no software is perfect and bug free, duh
2005-04-08T10:19:00.000Z	eclipse	projectmayhem	i have the nvidia driver installed with openGL enabled
2005-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	projectmayhem		eclipse oh, then it shouldn't be a problem
2005-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	projectmayhem		eclipse hoary or warty?
2005-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	eclipse		hoary
2005-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	projectmayhem		eclipse that could be part of it, hoary (since its unstable and all) tends to run slower
2005-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	projectmayhem		yoko omo don't you have to pay for that??
2005-04-08T10:20:00.000Z	eclipse		also in kde, the desktop icon text doesn't support long filename

2005-04-08T10:22:00.000Z	eclipse	projectmayhem	maybe u don't download as much as me
2005-04-08T10:23:00.000Z	eclipse	projectmayhem	also it's fine if u just create a file or folder on the desktop and it will appear on it right away with no problems
