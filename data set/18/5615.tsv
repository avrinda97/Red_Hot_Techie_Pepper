2008-10-13T10:35:00.000Z	hosstest	ActionParsnip	 Thanks
2008-10-13T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	unrar x /path/to/file.rar
2008-10-13T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	cd ~/.wine; find -name *.ico
2008-10-13T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	it may be part of an exe in which case you will have to grep
2008-10-13T15:56:00.000Z	hosstest	ActionParsnip	 Can Awn use .ico files?
2008-10-13T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	and search for eve
2008-10-13T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	im answering question 1
2008-10-13T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	i have no idea about awm
2008-10-13T15:58:00.000Z	hosstest	ActionParsnip	 Thanks for attempting to answer question 1, howerver my initial question was to find out where a launcher is getting its icon from, if it is currently using the icon.  This could apply to any number of current launcher already present.
2008-10-13T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	if its specific to that app it will be in ~/.wine but if its using an ubuntu icon it'll be in /usr/share/pixmaps
2008-10-13T16:00:00.000Z	hosstest	ActionParsnip	 Thanks.  Is the /usr/share/icon folder reserved for system icons?
2008-10-13T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	its where some icons are, you can copy any others you want there with sudo cp
2008-10-13T16:02:00.000Z	hosstest	ActionParsnip	 I think it is kinda lame that you cant place a launcher on the desktop and have no way of finding out where it is getting its icon from.  Right clicking offers no help under Properties.
2008-10-13T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	i dont use launchers myself so i dont have that problem :)
2008-10-13T16:05:00.000Z	hosstest	ActionParsnip	 The wife likes icons, what can I say.
2008-10-13T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hosstest	makes sense
