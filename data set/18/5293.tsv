2009-01-24T07:53:00.000Z	jedi06		ok since the guided partition doesn't work becuase it only sees my xp partition i have to use the manual and i see /dev/sda1 ntsf /dev/sda2 ext3 106MB and /dev/sda3 31gb  which sda2 and sda3 must be linux how do i format them onto one partition and install ubuntu
2009-01-24T07:54:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	well, it seems like /dev/sda2 is /boot and /dev/sda3 might be /
2009-01-24T07:55:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	what do you wnat to do?
2009-01-24T07:55:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	delete the linux partitions?
2009-01-24T07:55:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	you want to install ubuntu over XP?
2009-01-24T07:56:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	well for starters: ubuntu IS linux, but well you should delete /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 via livecd
2009-01-24T07:57:00.000Z	jedi06	akurei	i have the optio
2009-01-24T07:58:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	then use the installer and manually create 3 partitions: 1) ext2 100MB for /boot 2) ext3 about 5GB for / 3) ext3 the rest for /home
2009-01-24T08:00:00.000Z	jedi06	akurei	why ext2 for the /boot
2009-01-24T08:00:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	dunno, kinda preference
2009-01-24T08:00:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	could use ext3 though. but i don't see the need for a journaled fs on /boot
2009-01-24T08:01:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	just leave /dev/sda1 untouched
2009-01-24T08:01:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	 but you should ALWAYS make backups dude
2009-01-24T08:02:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	guided is bad... it screwed my disk once
2009-01-24T08:02:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	use manual: just check that there's no checked box on /dev/sda1
2009-01-24T08:10:00.000Z	jedi06	akurei	do i use primary or logical for the new partitions
2009-01-24T08:11:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	use primary for /boot. the rest is logical
2009-01-24T08:13:00.000Z	akurei	jedi06	short: primary : max 4 partitions logical: more.... long: see wikipedia
