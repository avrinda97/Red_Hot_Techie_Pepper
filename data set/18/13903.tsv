2007-08-03T10:41:00.000Z	phanter		I hope there is somebody willing to help me in this worst-case senario :(.
2007-08-03T10:41:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	you will find out once you've described the scenario.
2007-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	does Alt-F2 work?
2007-08-03T10:47:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	the menu or Windows keys perhaps?
2007-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	Xfce uses Alt-F2 as the default shortcut for the xfrun4 program. If that doesn't work, your setup is messed up in more ways than one.
2007-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	phanter	soundray	I am sure it is messed up...
2007-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	can you ssh to the machine from another?
2007-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	if the keyboard doesn't work at the grub stage, I bet it's USB. Can you connect a PS/2 keyboard temporarily?
2007-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	have you instructed that person to hold Alt down while they press F2? (Just to be certain...)
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	phanter	soundray	yes I did :)
2007-08-03T11:02:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	is it possible that, on the console, there is a login that just isn't displayed? I'd try a blind login to check.
2007-08-03T11:02:00.000Z	phanter	soundray	blind login sounds like a good idea :)
2007-08-03T11:05:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	there's no way she could find a mouse somewhere to attach to that machine?
2007-08-03T11:07:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	as someone mentioned above, you might be able to get the keyboard to work if you configure USB legacy mode in the BIOS.
2007-08-03T11:07:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	I mean, at the grub stage.
2007-08-03T11:09:00.000Z	phanter	soundray	keyboard does work at boot time (she could get into the bios), but there is something wrong that grup does not go into the menu
2007-08-03T11:10:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	she probably needs to hit Esc once grub takes over from BIOS.
2007-08-03T11:17:00.000Z	soundray	phanter	too bad. It looks like you'll have to wait for the shops to open.
