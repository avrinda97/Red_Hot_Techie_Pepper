2008-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	My current xorg.conf is pretty much just a stub, everything gets autoconfigured by xorg at startup.
2008-11-07T07:57:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	check out /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	... which should describe what's being detected.  You _can_ also put stuff into xorg.conf to make things explicit, though the whole process is changing rapidly.
2008-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	BrickHaus	karsten	ahhh. I see that now. Couldn't figure out why everything was missing and still working.. nice. I like that..
2008-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	Yeah, I discovered that over the summer.
2008-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	BrickHaus	karsten	sweet. Thanks for the tip
2008-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	I'm from Debian, so ubuntu's pretty similar.
2008-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	NP.
2008-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	You can also do a fair bit of stuff through xrandr, interactively.
2008-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	.. scary, actually, how much.  And both KDE/GNOME have pretty good config tools (GUI).
2008-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	setting your display to be mirrored and/or upside down is always fun....
2008-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	BrickHaus	karsten	is xrandr a pkg?
2008-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	application and utility, one sec...
2008-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	BrickHaus	karsten	don't think i've heard of that before
2008-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	... x11-server-utils
2008-11-07T08:01:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	... is the package.  Should be installed by default.
2008-11-07T08:01:00.000Z	karsten	BrickHaus	botlove.
