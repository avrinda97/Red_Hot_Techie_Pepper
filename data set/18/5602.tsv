2009-01-20T23:34:00.000Z	plytheman		oops
2009-01-20T23:35:00.000Z	plytheman		can someone help me with some permissions issues?  I'm running a .sh to install Neverwinter Nights and it won't let me write to where it has to be installed
2009-01-20T23:36:00.000Z	plytheman		I set the folder privleges to all read/write
2009-01-20T23:36:00.000Z	plytheman		but no luck
2009-01-20T23:36:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	how did you set the permissions for the install location?
2009-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	plytheman	ichbinesderelch	I ran nautilus as root and set it through the properties dialog
2009-01-20T23:37:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	where do you want to install it to?
2009-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	just do a "sudo chown -R youruser /usr/local/games/"
2009-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	will change the owner of the folder to your login name
2009-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	plytheman	ichbinesderelch	I'll try that now, thanks
2009-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	plytheman	ichbinesderelch	still not working.  should the chown command have given me a success message? I saw nothing
2009-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	nope just no output, do a "ls -l /usr/local/games" and post the output
2009-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	fearlessdawgs method, sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/games/
2009-01-21T00:16:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	plytheman	if you have 1 ubuntu system and add another one, how many do you have then? :P
