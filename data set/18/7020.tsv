2008-10-14T16:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	There is.
2008-10-14T16:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	But your shouting has put you in the back of the queue. I'll be with you shortly.
2008-10-14T16:13:00.000Z	sectrix	BlueEagle	are you a php expert?
2008-10-14T16:14:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	Meanwhile be a good boy and pastebin a short example of the code you're having trouble with so I can verify the problem.
2008-10-14T16:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	It's important that you use the exact nickname or many irc clients do not highlight the text and lines may be lost.
2008-10-14T16:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	Ok, have you got urls for me to look at your code?
2008-10-14T16:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	Still waiting for those pastebin urls.
2008-10-14T16:30:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sectrix	I won't be around much longer so this is probably your last chance.
