2012-11-26T06:26:00.000Z	Darkstar1		………. Anyone?

2012-11-26T06:29:00.000Z	Darkstar1	usr13	10.04 still going?
2012-11-26T06:30:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	Yes, (10.04 is LTS).  LTS Desktop = 3 years

2012-11-26T06:32:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	LTS: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS
2012-11-26T06:33:00.000Z	Darkstar1	usr13	Thanks. Should've known and installed the LTS version
2012-11-26T06:33:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	Yep
2012-11-26T08:24:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	do-release-upgrade will only take you to the incremental path
2012-11-26T08:25:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	but if you get to 10.04, you can switch to LTS and then go from 10.04 to 12.04.
2012-11-26T08:32:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	To switch to LTS change Prompt=normal
2012-11-26T08:32:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	To switch to LTS change Prompt=normal to Prompt=lts in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
2012-11-26T08:33:00.000Z	Darkstar1	usr13	Ok I'll try thsat
2012-11-26T08:35:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	Scratch that.  You are passed 10.04. YOu are on 10.10 and you can't do that.  Sorry.  Disreguard
2012-11-26T08:35:00.000Z	Darkstar1	usr13	:) ok
2012-11-26T08:49:00.000Z	usr13	Darkstar1	That is better than A42c05932c056222 or My\040Book :)
