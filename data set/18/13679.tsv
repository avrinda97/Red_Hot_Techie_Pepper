2005-10-21T06:20:00.000Z	fsmith		hello
2005-10-21T06:21:00.000Z	fsmith		I am having a problem with sudo. I have searched all over and it looks like I cannot fix it.
2005-10-21T06:22:00.000Z	fsmith		I used sudo -S -h and when I was finished I closed the terminal without first typing exit and then I exited gnome and selected save session. Now I get "sudo: must be setuid root
2005-10-21T06:22:00.000Z	fsmith		" no matter what.
2005-10-21T06:23:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	is sudo setuid root?
2005-10-21T06:23:00.000Z	fsmith	eythian	how do I check?
2005-10-21T06:23:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	ls -l `which sudo`
2005-10-21T06:24:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	should look like: -rwsr-xr-x  1 root root 93076 2005-09-30 20:11 /usr/bin/sudo
2005-10-21T06:24:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	the 's' in the permissions is important
2005-10-21T06:25:00.000Z	fsmith	eythian	nope that is missing... replaced with x
2005-10-21T06:26:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	then, as root (which may be tricky): chmod +s `which sudo`
2005-10-21T06:26:00.000Z	fsmith	eythian	I cannot get under root to change it, that is my problem.
2005-10-21T06:27:00.000Z	fsmith	eythian	the only user available to my knowledge is the one I setup at install.
2005-10-21T06:27:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	from a rescue CD? I can't help much right now, my system is currently in the process of being broken.
2005-10-21T06:27:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	then use a rescue CD if applications->system tools->root terminal doesn't work
2005-10-21T06:28:00.000Z	fsmith	eythian	oh ok... will the install cd work for that?
2005-10-21T06:28:00.000Z	eythian	fsmith	yep
2005-10-21T06:28:00.000Z	fsmith	eythian	ok thanks a lot!
