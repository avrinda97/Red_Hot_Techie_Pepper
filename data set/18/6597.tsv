2008-04-27T03:36:00.000Z	Byan		can anyone help me figure out why I can't get lm-sensors to work?
2008-04-27T03:36:00.000Z	Byan		I had it working in fiesty fawn
2008-04-27T03:37:00.000Z	androver	Byan	what's not working about it?
2008-04-27T03:38:00.000Z	Byan	androver	sensors-detect doesn't find anything
2008-04-27T03:39:00.000Z	androver	Byan	what does "sensors" return?
2008-04-27T03:40:00.000Z	Byan	androver	"No sensors found!"
2008-04-27T03:40:00.000Z	androver	Byan	do you remember what modules sensors-detect installed in gutsy?  are they still listed in /etc/modules?
2008-04-27T03:42:00.000Z	Byan	androver	fiesty* and I did a fresh install and I looked in my backed up /etc
2008-04-27T03:42:00.000Z	Byan	androver	I tried modprobe those and it didn't help
2008-04-27T03:42:00.000Z	androver	Byan	what happened when you modprobed them?  are they listed in "lsmod"?
2008-04-27T03:43:00.000Z	Byan	androver	uhm, let me see
2008-04-27T03:44:00.000Z	Byan	androver	maybe?
