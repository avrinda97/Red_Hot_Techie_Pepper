2005-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	synthetic_		k, i give up
2005-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	synthetic_		i followed the instructions exactly on everything:
2005-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	synthetic_		no sound, no mouse, no wireless
2005-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	synthetic_		i'm going back to windows
2005-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	synthetic_		thanks for your help
2005-07-08T14:50:00.000Z	synthetic_		i'm been trying to figure out wireless for two days
2005-07-08T14:50:00.000Z	synthetic_		i get the advice to upgrade to hoary
2005-07-08T14:50:00.000Z	synthetic_		and hoary doesn't fix anything;  it just takes away my mouse support
2005-07-08T14:51:00.000Z	synthetic_		i mean honestly, i got the drivers, i followed instructions, and it absolutely refuses to work
2005-07-08T14:51:00.000Z	speel	synthetic_	well if you want you can type xorgconfig in a shell and try to reconfigure xorg all over again
2005-07-08T14:44:00.000Z	speel	synthetic_	sudo gedit /etx/X11/xorg.conf
2005-07-08T14:44:00.000Z	speel	synthetic_	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ** made a mistake Lol

2005-07-08T15:04:00.000Z	speel	synthetic_	i think you would have to install xp first then linux
2005-07-08T15:05:00.000Z	synthetic_	speel	shoot...see, my copy of windows is slightly less than legal, so i can't boot it from my bios
2005-07-08T15:06:00.000Z	speel	synthetic_	ah damn =/ i have the not so legal bootable windows
