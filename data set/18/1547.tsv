2011-01-24T16:23:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	unfortunately, no one here is bound to help you, so be patient
2011-01-24T16:25:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	sorry man but i'm trying to teach linux to my students and is first impression is not that good
2011-01-24T16:26:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	what is your problem?
2011-01-24T16:27:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	after I boot from cd ask me for username and passwd but nothing is installed
2011-01-24T16:28:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	are you booting from the CD or not? your phrasing was kind of confusing
2011-01-24T16:29:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	yes
2011-01-24T16:29:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	are you sure you are booting from the CD? if you are, it's absolutely not going to ask you for a password
2011-01-24T16:29:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	yes I am
2011-01-24T16:30:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	can you describe the sequence of actions you make when you boot from the CD. what shows up? what do you click?
2011-01-24T16:33:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	they have restarted the pc  from the installation cd; and the only thing that appeared after a wile is a windows asking for username and passwd
2011-01-24T16:35:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	i agree with tristan3199, that's definately not ubuntu
2011-01-24T16:41:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	root and toor doesn't work on this pcs, anymore ideas?
2011-01-24T16:41:00.000Z	meltingwax	thormentor	where did you obtain your ubuntu live cd
2011-01-24T16:42:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	from the ubuntu website
2011-01-24T16:43:00.000Z	thormentor	meltingwax	32bit
