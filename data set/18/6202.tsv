2008-06-11T20:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	Mountpoint is what you make it
2008-06-11T20:44:00.000Z	CaptainAmerica	Jack_Sparrow	what is an example for using the ISO as an OS
2008-06-11T20:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	You are trying to mount what as an os
2008-06-11T20:45:00.000Z	CaptainAmerica	Jack_Sparrow	an Iso as an OS for Windows XP
2008-06-11T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	Read up on vbox or wine to run your windows apps...
2008-06-11T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	 Start by making a mount point... sudo mkdir /media/mydrive ... sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/jack/Desktop/KNOPPIX_V5.0.1CD-2006-06-01-EN.iso /media/mydrive              is an example, but you wont be able to do what you are looking to do.
2008-06-11T20:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	Dont go there.. burn the iso to a cd
2008-06-11T20:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	you didnt burn it right.. you burned it as a file, not as an image
2008-06-11T20:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	right click the iso and tell it to write to disk
2008-06-11T20:48:00.000Z	CaptainAmerica	Jack_Sparrow	kk
2008-06-11T20:49:00.000Z	CaptainAmerica	Jack_Sparrow	write as a file image?
2008-06-11T20:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	yes, burn as image
2008-06-11T20:50:00.000Z	CaptainAmerica	Jack_Sparrow	kk
2008-06-11T20:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	if you do it right, you will see many files on the cd not just *.iso
2008-06-11T20:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	To Backup your mbr.. Go to Terminal.. cd Desktop .... sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbr.backup bs=512 count=1   Note: 512 includes the partition info 446 first partition is 16 bytes and gets to 462 Would just be the boot info... use hda if needed on your system... copy mbr.backup to a USB Drive or other media
2008-06-11T21:11:00.000Z	CaptainAmerica	Jack_Sparrow	I got the iso put to an image on a CD. What Now?
2008-06-11T21:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CaptainAmerica	Do you see multiple files or a single fine on the cd
