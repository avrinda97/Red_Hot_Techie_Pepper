2007-10-20T07:42:00.000Z	thedefender		geoff: go to system\ preferences\ apperence
2007-10-20T07:42:00.000Z	thedefender		geoff: go to effects and enable them to as you wish, if you want more compex effects
2007-10-20T07:42:00.000Z	thedefender		i see
2007-10-20T07:43:00.000Z	thedefender		hmmm, not sure if Xubuntu has effects, seeing is it is suppose to be a lighter system
2007-10-20T07:44:00.000Z	trogdor	thedefender	effects can be installed to any system
2007-10-20T07:45:00.000Z	thedefender	trogdor	yes but is it already preinstalled on Xubuntu
2007-10-20T07:45:00.000Z	trogdor	thedefender	where you buying xubuntu preinstalled from?...
2007-10-20T07:46:00.000Z	trogdor	thedefender	if you want effects just apt-get install compiz-fusion. it works on every setup however kde is bloated on its own built in effects system so running both might be lacking on performance
2007-10-20T07:46:00.000Z	thedefender	trogdor	huh buying? a man on here is wondering if he has effects on his Xubuntu gutsy installation and how to enable them
2007-10-20T07:47:00.000Z	thedefender	trogdor	in gutsy gnome it compizfusion is preinstalled but i am unsure on xbuntu
2007-10-20T07:47:00.000Z	trogdor	thedefender	you mentioned preinstalled, you installed the system yourself though right?  just open synaptic and grab a few fancy graphics things
2007-10-20T07:47:00.000Z	trogdor	thedefender	its like what 10mb to install compizfusion or other things?..
2007-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	trogdor	thedefender	hmm there is one thing you would need to know. to use it you have to do compiz --replace command you can set xubuntu to do that upon start under settings
