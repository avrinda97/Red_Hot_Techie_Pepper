2006-12-28T17:30:00.000Z	mwe		you have to blindtype your password though. nothing is ecchoed, not even a *. but I guess you don't even get to the prompt
2006-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	Still doesn't work :/
2006-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	yup
2006-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	odd
2006-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	Yeah :)
2006-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	doesn't sudo dhclient eth0 work either?
2006-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	nope, it    gives me  DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67      but all those timeout
2006-12-28T17:36:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	I'm not sure what's up
2006-12-28T17:36:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	ok, thanks anyway for your time
2006-12-28T17:36:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	you are not using the wifi card? I see two entries for that
2006-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	nope, eth0 is the "normal"
2006-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	The absolutely strangest part of this is that it works at home, but not in my friends cable modem
2006-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	while it works for him on Ubuntu XP
2006-12-28T17:38:00.000Z	Enselic`	mwe	A DHCP server should not care about the OS right? Could it even figure out what os that requests?
2006-12-28T17:39:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	right
2006-12-28T17:39:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	it's a network protocol. OS independent
2006-12-28T17:40:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic`	it's not a proper DHCP server if it doesn't respond to the broadcast
