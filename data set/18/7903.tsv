2008-06-24T03:28:00.000Z	DoubleD		Hi i have been trying to make my integrated (wired) network work under ubuntu 8.04. It has worked fine before under 7.10. I have already tried unplugging the network card etc. like it was told on: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=538448 I have also tried the WakeOnLan via windows, this did not help me either. Can someone please help me?
2008-06-24T03:28:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	what network chip?
2008-06-24T03:29:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	ifconfig -a   and dmesg |grep eth
2008-06-24T03:30:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	: that only lists things right ?
2008-06-24T03:35:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	: should i msg you in private to paste the outcome of those commands ?
2008-06-24T03:35:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	you should not

2008-06-24T03:40:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	your NIC is recognized and it has a IP. it's fine
2008-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	my nic is recognized yes, but it does not have an ip address. it might have that 169 thing but thats an ip address you get when you cant get one from your router.
2008-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	it does. I saw it
2008-06-24T03:42:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	and the link is up it connects to the router. if your router doesn't hand out dhcp addresses it's not a ubuntu problem
2008-06-24T03:42:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	: if i would have gotten an ip address it would be in my routers dhcp ip address pool
2008-06-24T03:42:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	: my network card worked fine under 7.10
2008-06-24T03:42:00.000Z	wols_	DoubleD	ubuntu is not responsible for the dhcpd of your router
2008-06-24T03:43:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	: if it works under 7.10, and not under 8.04. how can it not be the responsibility of ubuntu
2008-06-24T03:46:00.000Z	DoubleD	wols_	: do you know what i mean ?
