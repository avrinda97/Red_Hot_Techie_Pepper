2011-01-10T13:33:00.000Z	ebra		where is my ip address which gave to me by the isp is stored
2011-01-10T13:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	ebra	Your English is not well understood. Say it in other words, please.
2011-01-10T13:35:00.000Z	ebra	splazo	i don't wanna it through ifconfig
2011-01-10T13:35:00.000Z	ebra		bullgrad4, i need the file in which the ip address is stored
2011-01-10T13:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	ebra	I believe it is stored in the kernel.
2011-01-10T13:38:00.000Z	ebra		bullgrad4, I knew that, but i need the file name, because i want to use it in other script
2011-01-10T13:38:00.000Z	ebra		yeah it's dhcp
2011-01-10T13:39:00.000Z	ebra	splazo	yeah it's dhcp
2011-01-10T13:42:00.000Z	ebra	splazo	i will look there and come here again
2011-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	ebra	Let me re-iterate: It is stored in a RAM area which is for kernel use. You need to use a program which fetches this address and shows it to you.
2011-01-10T13:44:00.000Z	ebra		ok, bullgrad4, could you name one of these programs
2011-01-10T13:46:00.000Z	ebra	splazo	i knew ifconfig but i need to somehow to cut this address
2011-01-10T13:47:00.000Z	ebra		I used this line to cut the address from the ifconfig
2011-01-10T13:48:00.000Z	ebra	splazo	i need it temporary so there is no need to them
2011-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	ebra	One program is "ifconfig".
2011-01-10T13:51:00.000Z	ebra	splazo	i used this line to get the address form ifconfig: ifconfig ppp0 | grep -d : -f 2 | cut -d : -f 2 | cut -d \  -f 1
2011-01-10T13:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	ebra	Another method is to query http://www.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/check_ip.cgi
