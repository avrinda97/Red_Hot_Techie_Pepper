2010-11-02T06:38:00.000Z	dbowlby		I have ubuntu server 10.10 running on my box.  I told it to install the virtualization components.  So far it works great, I love it.  My only concern is that my hosts are on their own network.  I'm cool with this, but I really want to have the server to act as a gateway to the virtualized servers.
2010-11-02T06:38:00.000Z	dbowlby		There is documentation on host only and bridged connections, but I can't find anything on port forwarding to the virtualized hosts.
2010-11-02T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	make the guest systems us a bridged interface and they will appear on teh LAN just like a physical PC and will be in the DHCP list in the router config page
2010-11-02T06:40:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	I'm not wanting to eat up IP addreses on my network.  I like it to be seperate.  I want the host server to port forward to the internal hosts
2010-11-02T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	are you using a home lan?
2010-11-02T06:41:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	I like the design of having the VM host front the ports
2010-11-02T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	do you anticipate having 254 PCs?
2010-11-02T06:42:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	I see where you are going, but I only want one IP per physical box
2010-11-02T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	thats what will happen, the other IPs will be for the software systems
2010-11-02T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	the host won't have multiple IPs, it will just be the same port for the next hop to then hit the virtual systems
2010-11-02T06:45:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	I understand the dynamics of virtualization.  I'm wanting to forward ports from the eth0 of the host to the various virtual boxes on that host.  The idea is to have a single IP to reference and based on port it goes to the appropriate host
2010-11-02T06:45:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	similar to the nat options in vmware
2010-11-02T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	you can do it that way but its a bit messier
2010-11-02T06:45:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	I figured that is why there isn't really a tutorial :)
2010-11-02T06:55:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	thanks for the info.  I will go with the bridging approach and abandon the idea of fronting ports from the host.
2010-11-02T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbowlby	home networks have addresses to burn
2010-11-02T06:56:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	I'll just change my IP schema to accomodate :)
2010-11-02T06:56:00.000Z	dbowlby	ActionParsnip	well that is true of most homes, not necessarily mine :)
