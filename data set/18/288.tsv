2012-08-12T07:54:00.000Z	osirisx11		hello my friends, i am stuck in a very low resolution after a game crashed, can anyone please suggest how i can reset to a higher res in terminal?
2012-08-12T07:55:00.000Z	osirisx11		i tried using the standard gui but it annoyingly won't let me drag it up as my resolution is smaller than the change resolution window
2012-08-12T07:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	osirisx11	have you tried logging out and back in or rebooting?
2012-08-12T07:56:00.000Z	osirisx11	wilee-nilee	no i was trying to avoid tha
