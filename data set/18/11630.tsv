2006-07-02T07:29:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	 you don't have an icon for it on your desktop?  Try places>computer
2006-07-02T07:30:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	 open your places menu at top, then computer, that should list your drives
2006-07-02T08:01:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	what he's telling you is good, "sudo nautilus" in a terminal window should prompt for password then open up a new file manager window as root
2006-07-02T08:02:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	what is it you are trying to do?  are you the one trying to access a windows partition?
2006-07-02T08:03:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	do you know if it's an ide drive?  if so what placement?  (primary master/slave etc)
2006-07-02T08:04:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	ok, primary or secondary?
2006-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	ok if it's your primary slave ide drive with ntfs filesystem try this in a terminal as root (no quotes) - "mkdir -p /mnt/windows && mount -t ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/windows"
2006-07-02T08:07:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	did that work?
2006-07-02T08:08:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	ok... try it like this then "sudo mkdir -p /mnt/windows && mount -t ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/windows"
2006-07-02T08:09:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	or like this if you want to be paranoid and have read only access  "sudo mkdir -p /mnt/windows && mount -o ro -t ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/windows"
2006-07-02T08:10:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	just type sudo before the command and type your login password
2006-07-02T08:12:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	it won't if you have already run sudo in the past, what 5 minutes or so
2006-07-02T08:13:00.000Z	dgh1973	abc123	sorry no, too much traffic here
