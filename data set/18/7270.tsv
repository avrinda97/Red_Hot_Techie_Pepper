2010-07-20T11:19:00.000Z	rewati	ActionParsnip	: i tried it it very simple and dosnt have all features correct me if i am wrong
2010-07-20T11:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	depends which features you need. There's also amaya
2010-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	there are lots on the repos and I'm sure there are some which arent
2010-07-20T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	if you can't pull yourself away from Adobe's apron strings you could try running dreamweaver in wine assuming you own a legal copy (could be pricey)
2010-07-20T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	2004 seems to get a good rating http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=183
2010-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	rewati	ActionParsnip	: Thanks i downloaded amaya and working with it . it looks good
2010-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	nice
2010-08-02T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	you could add an entry in your startup to run a command to launch espeak or festival to say "Welcome to Ubuntu" if that gets you off
2010-08-02T02:42:00.000Z	rewati	ActionParsnip	hi how are u ? yeah that is great i will see how to get it eworking thanks
2010-08-02T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	just add a normal startup item to run a suiitable espeak command
2010-08-02T02:43:00.000Z	rewati	ActionParsnip	ok
2011-07-21T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	test memory and ensure cd is set to 1st boot device
2011-07-21T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	i don't think so really. The liveCd should run regardless of installed OS as it runs in RAM
2011-07-21T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rewati	you can run liveCD in 512mb. Test your RAM is a good start
