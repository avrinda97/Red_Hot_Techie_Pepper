2011-01-04T01:33:00.000Z	lesshaste		can anyone recommend an applicant to stream music to a DLNA compliant receiver that they use themselves?

2011-01-04T01:35:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	 The default music player,  Rhythmbox, has a plugin that can be both a DLNA client and server.
2011-01-04T01:35:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	oh?!
2011-01-04T01:36:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	have you tried it?
2011-01-04T01:37:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	Yes.  (?)
2011-01-04T01:37:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	do you need coherence too?
2011-01-04T01:38:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	No.  (Why does this matter?)
2011-01-04T01:38:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	ok.. I am trying to work out how to do it
2011-01-04T01:39:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	http://ubuntu-snippets.blogspot.com/2008/10/rhythmbox-media-server.html for example claims you do
2011-01-04T01:39:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	So?  What is the outstanding problem that you're having?
2011-01-04T01:40:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	working out what I need to install, currently :)
2011-01-04T01:40:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	 Just try it.  Ubuntu almost always handles dependencies for you.  If you can see the plugin, then it will probably work.
2011-01-04T01:41:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	the coherence plugin? I can't see it
2011-01-04T01:42:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	The UPNP/DLNA plugin, unless you have an unusually weird setup.
2011-01-04T01:42:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	I can't see that currently
2011-01-04T01:44:00.000Z	dajhorn	lesshaste	Did you install the rhythmbox-plugin-coherence package, or did you try to install it from upstream?
2011-01-04T01:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	dajhorn	installing it now using sudo apt-get install rhythmbox-plugin-coherence
