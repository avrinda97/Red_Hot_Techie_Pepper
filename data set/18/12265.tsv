2009-11-16T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	normally caused by a corrupt windows disk after resizing
2009-11-16T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	if you re-install the windows nltd with the recovery CD - then re-install grub
2009-11-16T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	your windows install CD
2009-11-16T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	if you boot from it and click install it will offer you recovery mode or fix install, ##windows can help you with that

2010-09-10T22:53:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	do you mean the diff command ?
2010-09-10T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	man is the correct command
2010-09-10T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	that isn't what this channel is about
2010-09-10T22:56:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	man is the correct command to read man pages
2010-09-10T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshell	that isn't what this channel is for
