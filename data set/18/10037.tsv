2008-05-07T23:48:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... is there a chance of this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution-data-server/+bug/151536 - damaging the hardware of a machine?
2008-05-07T23:49:00.000Z	chazco		heh, the bots clever :)
2008-05-07T23:49:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	only if your machine is already undercooled
2008-05-07T23:50:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	- One overheats due to the room its in. The other is a laptop which has to run the fan continuously then eventually switches off due to heat.
2008-05-07T23:50:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	ya, that'd be a design defect in the laptop, which isn't helped by that bug :p
2008-05-07T23:50:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	- It doesnt do it on Gusty/Windows...
2008-05-07T23:51:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	if it's shutting down, then it should be okay (as long as you don't keep powering it back up), in that the hardware has a thermometre to shut down the machine before it _actually_ overheats
2009-06-17T15:09:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	they're journalled, in practice there shouldn't be any data corruption (although obviously anything that hadn't been written to disk yet is gone)
2009-06-17T15:09:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	that being said, a hard shutdown isn't exactly nice to the hardware either
2009-06-17T15:09:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	- Ah, good to here, thanks :)
2009-06-17T15:09:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	and whether an application itself handles being killed nicely is another matter
2009-06-17T15:09:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	- Was unavoidable, Ubuntu totally froze, could switch to terminals or anything
2009-06-17T15:10:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	& ActionParsnip - Thanks :)
2009-06-17T15:11:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	incidently, if that happens again, you can avoid the worst behaviour sometimes
2009-06-17T15:12:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	- How?
2009-06-17T15:12:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	alt-sysrq-s will do a disk sync, which will save you from some harm
2009-06-17T15:12:00.000Z	cwillu	chazco	alt-sysrq-[reisub] (r, then e, then i... a few seconds between each)
2009-06-17T15:12:00.000Z	chazco	cwillu	- I think it had completely given up though, but will make a note of that for next time :)
