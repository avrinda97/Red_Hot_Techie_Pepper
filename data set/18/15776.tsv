2006-11-10T17:35:00.000Z	MM2		Could someone please help, my 6.10 won't see my wireless HP kbd or mouse. Or it sees it randomly (after reboot)
2006-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	how about changing the battery ?
2006-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	it works in windows :/
2006-11-10T17:37:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	is the problem equal with both kbd AND mouse ?
2006-11-10T17:37:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	in morning kbd worked fine, I booted to windows, it worked, I booted just to ubuntu and it didn't work
2006-11-10T17:37:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	yes
2006-11-10T17:37:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	I guess you have to boot into windows now ( to see it does/doesn't work ) :)
2006-11-10T17:37:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	in grub it worked fine :)
2006-11-10T17:49:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	I rebooted and usb kbd and mouse are still dead...
2006-11-10T17:50:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	grub worked fine with kbd
2006-11-10T17:51:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	so windows also has problem with this wireless gear ?
2006-11-10T17:51:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	no, just Ubuntu
2006-11-10T17:52:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	I asked you to reboot into windows - to see if after the problem occured in ubuntu it is replicated or not in windows.
2006-11-10T17:52:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	I rebooted to windows, and no problems
2006-11-10T17:52:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	then there needs to be done some tuning.
2006-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	I know, but what kind of tuning?
2006-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	sobersabre	MM2	look for misc repeat rates, and serial protocols related to usb
2006-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	MM2	sobersabre	where to start? howtos?
