2008-11-03T01:19:00.000Z	makhi		Bind/DNS question ; My Registrar resolve my domain name to my server. Server local resolution this well, but wrong resolution from my house (unknown host). Are there other things to do ? open ports ? configurations ? very sorry my english
2008-11-03T01:20:00.000Z	musikgoat	makhi	set your /etc/hosts to your local IP for your server
2008-11-03T01:21:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	i like this : public pc : www.mydomain.com -> my DNS server -> 88.191.*.* -> Hello world
2008-11-03T01:22:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	 Bind is a wrong solution ?
2008-11-03T01:22:00.000Z	musikgoat	makhi	sorry, i guess i'm misunderstanding your problem, can you explain?
2008-11-03T01:25:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	sorry :( -> In my Registrar panel i set the primariry DNS server to 88.191.x.x , now i have configured my DNS from the server : "ping -c5 www.ping-from-the-same-server-to-my-domain.com" succely response ! but from my house (this computer) if i like to resolve with "ping" command, i have the reponse : "unknown domain"
2008-11-03T01:26:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	i have read more documentation about Bind to this result, good in the local server, wrong from my remote pc
2008-11-03T01:27:00.000Z	musikgoat	makhi	so you are running bind on the local network for local network dns resolution?
2008-11-03T01:28:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	local network : dedicated server in another datacenter, the resolution from the same server is good, not good for a remote network (my pc)
2008-11-03T01:30:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	Ubuntu does not open the DNS port from anothor network ?
2008-11-03T01:30:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	i need to open port(s) ?
2008-11-03T01:33:00.000Z	musikgoat	makhi	dns resolution is done on a port (53 if i remember correctly) and so if your local system is querying a dns server remotely, then that remote server needs to be accepting calls on that port
2008-11-03T01:34:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	my Bind installation does not accept external dns resolution ? :)
2008-11-03T01:34:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	"from external resolution"
2008-11-03T01:36:00.000Z	musikgoat	makhi	i guess i'm not the best person to help, i'm not on the same page as you
2008-11-03T01:36:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	ok, thank for your help :)
2008-11-03T02:05:00.000Z	makhi	musikgoat	it's works: wrong "arpa domain" for the ip resolution :D
2008-11-03T02:05:00.000Z	musikgoat	makhi	nice work
