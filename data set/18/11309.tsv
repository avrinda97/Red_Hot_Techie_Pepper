2007-08-26T15:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	just set IP addresses manually, if you're just talking from one computer to the other
2007-08-26T15:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	don't complicate things with DHCP
2007-08-26T15:04:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	saw the pastebin? I did -> http://pastebin.ca/671026 but it doesn't seem to work, the two PCs can't ping each other
2007-08-26T15:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	forget about using wep etc
2007-08-26T15:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	just get it working first
2007-08-26T15:05:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	alright
2007-08-26T15:05:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	anything I need to change in the scripts?
2007-08-26T15:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	ah, you're trying to route from one as well?
2007-08-26T15:05:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	yeah, using my PC as gateway to share my internet for my laptop
2007-08-26T15:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	looks about right
2007-08-26T15:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	not sure about the routing but you should *at least* be able to ping between .2 and .10
2007-08-26T15:06:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	which doesn't work =/
2007-08-26T15:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	get that going first
2007-08-26T15:06:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	been trying to
2007-08-26T15:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	like I said, don't worry about wep etc at least until you can ping between the two PCSs
2007-08-26T15:07:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	oki, is there a way I can make it not to use any key? just remove the ra0 key lines and it'll be set open?
2007-08-26T15:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DARKGuy	yup
2007-08-26T15:07:00.000Z	DARKGuy	gordonjcp	oki :D
