2012-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	cihhan		Im having some problems with the installation of Ubuntu 12.04 Server. When it comes to the "partition disks", I only see (1) Configure iSCSI, (2) a completely blank line, (3) Undo, (4) Finish -- (2) should normally have guided partitioning... Any ideas?
2012-07-10T03:38:00.000Z	escott	cihhan	how are your disks attached
2012-07-10T03:39:00.000Z	cihhan	escott	good question, the problem is it is blade server
2012-07-10T03:43:00.000Z	cihhan	escott	any recommendation? i checked it with redhat and gparted live and they are able to see.
2012-07-10T03:43:00.000Z	escott	cihhan	that still doesnt answer the question. how is the storage attached?
2012-07-10T03:43:00.000Z	cihhan	escott	what do you mean by how they are attached?
2012-07-10T03:44:00.000Z	escott	cihhan	ATA, SCSI, SATA, iSCSI, carrier pigeon
