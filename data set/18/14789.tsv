2005-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	holo		why does mpg123 and mp3blaster don't exist in ubuntu repositorys?
2005-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: exactly..
2005-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: and now you need to download 30mb of packages just to compile mp3blaster yourself
2005-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	are you kidding, worst that could happen was using debian repositorys, i do have a life
2005-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	:  compile things yourself dont be lazy
2005-06-12T12:27:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	then i think you are using the wrong distro, try gentoo, its for ultra geeks
2005-06-12T12:28:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: the ultra geeks are just smarter than you
2005-06-12T12:28:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	no, they are short sighted
2005-06-12T12:29:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: compiling mp3blaster takes less time than finding the package
2005-06-12T12:29:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	you are wrong
2005-06-12T12:29:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: you are an arrogant american most likely
2005-06-12T12:31:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: binaries compiled for i686 sucks, if i can use -O3 and athlon-4 to make it faster i will
2005-06-12T12:32:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	holo	: you are adopting a ms viewpoint of things
2005-06-12T12:32:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	slow computers take too long to compile something just to be a little fast, very fast computers are fast enouph to bother compiling just to be a little optimized
2005-06-12T12:41:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	that is very nice to say, but when you go to a computer store what do you see there installed? microsoft windows.. so obviously they have tom imitate their touch and look, at least kde does a little of that.. gnome imitates cocoa touch and feel without the accelerated stuff
2005-06-12T12:57:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	you OS doesn't ignore your commands, he does what you want, but you are still working for him, and not the opposite
2005-06-12T13:06:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	wow you use the word kill too many times. you must be obcessive with killing
2005-06-12T15:26:00.000Z	holo	lsuactiafner	ok you said that becouse i said otherwise
