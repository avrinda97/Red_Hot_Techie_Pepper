2005-07-07T14:43:00.000Z	Strife		why the hell is there no (good) open source alternative to partition magic?
2005-07-07T14:44:00.000Z	Strife		erm
2005-07-07T14:45:00.000Z	Strife		sorry, I've had a bit of wine tonight
2005-07-07T14:45:00.000Z	Strife		to the first part
2005-07-07T14:45:00.000Z	Strife		there you go
2005-07-07T14:45:00.000Z	Strife		therefore, not as good
2005-07-07T14:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Strife	actually I heard when partition magic does it, it takes forever and is very unreliable
2005-07-07T14:46:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	doesn't matter... at least it tries :P
2005-07-07T14:46:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	obviously, only an idiot would count on that (i.e., not backup beforehand)
2005-07-07T14:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Strife	if you are going to back up your data, why is that feature even necessary in the first place?
2005-07-07T14:48:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Strife	I mean, why not just move all the data off of your partition, erase it, and repartition the way you want?  No need for partition magic to do somethnig that might screw up your data
2005-07-07T14:48:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	oh I agree
2005-07-07T14:48:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	but it would be nice to have something that can move your stuff, too
2005-07-07T14:49:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	the $50 rebate was before or after the $100?
2005-07-07T14:50:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Strife	after.  So it ended up being $50 for a 7200rpm 120gb hard drive.
2005-07-07T14:50:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	NICE
2005-07-07T14:50:00.000Z	Strife	tiglionabbit	where did you get that?
2005-07-10T07:15:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Strife	I got xnest from them
