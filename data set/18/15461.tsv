2005-09-21T16:53:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	You're asking the wrong question in the wrong channel.
2005-09-21T16:55:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	Did you file a bug report on that>
2005-09-21T05:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	yes
2005-09-22T16:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	Don't assume because they're not on the channel they're not watching you.
2005-09-22T16:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	That's a famous last mistake.
2005-09-22T16:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	Ops here fdon't idle with an @ on the channel, but they ARE here.
2005-09-22T16:32:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	op presence should be the ONLY reason for you not to behave like a teenager though.
2005-09-22T05:13:00.000Z	cafuego_	boogie	Would you mind laying off the trolling now?
