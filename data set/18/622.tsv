2012-03-29T00:35:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		My Xfce desktop background changes everytime I reboot, anyone knows why?

2012-03-29T00:35:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		Also firefox opens by default
2012-03-29T00:35:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		can't find any setting to stop opening programs by default at startup
2012-03-29T00:36:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		no I set the wallpaper from a saved image
2012-03-29T00:36:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		it just changes back to default
2012-03-29T00:37:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		and the programs that were last open start by itself, even after a hard reboot
2012-03-29T00:37:00.000Z	nooblikesgrapes		No hard reboot
