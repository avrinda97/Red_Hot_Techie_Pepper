2012-07-29T01:55:00.000Z	richtroye		Hi, trying to update ubuntu 12-4, supposedly long-term support, fails on this url:

2012-07-29T01:55:00.000Z	bekks	richtroye	Then just try another mirror.
2012-07-29T01:55:00.000Z	richtroye		The site *does* have *ubuntu-.2* but does *not* have *ubuntu-.1*
2012-07-29T01:56:00.000Z	richtroye	bekks	thanks, how do I do that?

2012-07-29T01:57:00.000Z	richtroye		oh ok i'll bring up synaptic and try updating from there
2012-07-29T01:59:00.000Z	richtroye	bekks	I guess I need to install synaptic, it apparently doesn't come with the default distro
2012-07-29T02:00:00.000Z	bekks	richtroye	Yes, but thats not a big deal :)
2012-07-29T02:00:00.000Z	richtroye		installing now ...
2012-07-29T02:10:00.000Z	richtroye	bekks	synaptic apparently doesn't have a way to specify mirrors.  Would you mind having a look yourself for that particular url I specified, to see if you can find it on any mirror?  I did a synaptic update and got the same problem.
2012-07-29T02:11:00.000Z	bekks	richtroye	For sure it does.
2012-07-29T02:12:00.000Z	richtroye	bekks	that's good to know.  Is it a gui thing (and if so, what dropdown menu?) or do I need to give some option to a command-line invocation?
2012-07-29T02:12:00.000Z	bekks	richtroye	Take a look at Settings -> Repositories -> Download from
2012-07-29T02:13:00.000Z	bekks	richtroye	There, you can choose the mirror you want to use.
2012-07-29T02:14:00.000Z	richtroye		thanks bekks
2012-07-29T02:50:00.000Z	richtroye	bekks	thanks for your help, all are updated now.
