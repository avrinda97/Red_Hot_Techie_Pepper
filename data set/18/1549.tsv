2011-01-24T01:02:00.000Z	bhuwan		@izuzizu... can you help me out?
2011-01-24T01:04:00.000Z	bhuwan		critical in the way that it does not work, right??
2011-01-24T01:04:00.000Z	izuzizu	bhuwan	go to system -> preferences -> sound -> input, ajust the input volume slider;
2011-01-24T01:05:00.000Z	bhuwan	izuzizu	had checked that one too... works with headphone, but not with builtin sound... changed input and output devices ... and still no result
2011-01-24T01:12:00.000Z	izuzizu	bhuwan	is the hardware itself fine? if your headphone is fine then the sound device is fine... well, I assume
2011-01-24T01:14:00.000Z	bhuwan		izuzizu@ya it was fine in earlier windows os
2011-01-24T01:15:00.000Z	bhuwan		but after i went ti ubuntu its not working
2011-01-24T01:17:00.000Z	bhuwan		izuzizu@ it was fine in windows but when i switch to ubuntu there its problem
2011-01-24T01:17:00.000Z	bhuwan		with inbulit speaker
2011-01-24T01:17:00.000Z	bhuwan		.....
2011-01-24T01:19:00.000Z	izuzizu		uhhh, i am thinking about that... my laptop speaker works as intended...
2011-01-24T01:23:00.000Z	izuzizu	bhuwan	oh, check that sound preference again, on output tab, go to connector, and check if it is set to analog speaker...
