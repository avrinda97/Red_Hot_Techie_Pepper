2005-05-14T11:08:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	you will also have to set xmms to use ESD instead of OSS
2005-05-14T11:09:00.000Z	Mistiry	Dethread	i have no idea what ESD and OSS are...again, im a n00bie
2005-05-14T11:09:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	tell us when you're done installing
2005-05-14T11:12:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	did you set the repositories correctly?
2005-05-14T11:13:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	in other words, did you follow steps 1,2 and 3 in that link you wree given?
2005-05-14T11:54:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	did you set it to ESD?
2005-05-14T11:55:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	in xmms, go to Options -> Preferences, then pick eSound for Output Plugin
2005-05-14T11:58:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	sorry...try another multimedia player, I guess
2005-05-14T12:02:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	why don't you type out your whole question into one coherent sentence...it's much easier to follow that way
2005-05-14T12:04:00.000Z	Dethread	Mistiry	that sounds very strange. do you maybe have some magnetic device close to the monitor?
