2006-01-28T11:46:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	just ask your question if someone know it he will answer
2006-01-28T11:48:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	one way is to check if you have the right driver for it
2006-01-28T11:48:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	check linuxprinting.org or the ubuntu forums
2006-01-28T11:51:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	using the gnome menu try to print a test page
2006-01-28T11:53:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	where di you get the driver for your printer
2006-01-28T11:53:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	if i were you i would reinstall the driver file
2006-01-28T11:54:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	before that try shutting down the printer and starting it again
2006-01-28T11:54:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	and the drivers are in linuxprinting.org
2006-01-28T11:54:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	and before that just check the ubuntu howto that ubotu directed you to
2006-01-28T11:55:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	i am afraid i got to go so good luck
2006-01-28T11:55:00.000Z	ilba7r	zeb	follow the ubuntu howto will help you set it up
