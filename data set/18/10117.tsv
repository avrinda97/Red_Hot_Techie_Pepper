2010-03-03T08:29:00.000Z	sixofour		so onc eit gets to 100mb, it deletes itself or the oldest entries or how ever it works
2010-03-03T08:29:00.000Z	sixofour		it will never meet the needs for those who don't know how to use it
2010-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	sixofour		me Souljah?
2010-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	fliptop	sixofour	 that pretty much stands for any o/s
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	sixofour	Souljah	 my system made GB sized logfiles, i couldn't even boot , so i need to cap them at 10mb
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	sixofour		100mb*
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	sixofour		i had to delete stuff in order to bootn
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	sixofour		kde wouldn't load
2010-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	fliptop	sixofour	 you should increase your / partition size to 20 or 25gb
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	sixofour		why?
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	sixofour		so the logs can be bigger? lol
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	fliptop	sixofour	or create a separate partition for /tmp or /var/log
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	sixofour		they went to 1.4 gb in like 10 minutes
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	sixofour		what Souljah?
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	sixofour		i jsut need to tell linux not to allow them to get big
2010-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	sixofour		better eyt, if i could turn logging off , even better
2010-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	sixofour		yes Souljah
2010-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	fliptop	sixofour	log files don't work that way, what you have to do is protect the rest of your partitions if a process starts to run away and fill up /var/log
