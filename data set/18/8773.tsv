2008-11-28T21:36:00.000Z	intercool		Anyone have problems with spdif and analog music? I am not able to change volume.. DTS sound works great though..
2008-11-28T21:37:00.000Z	intercool		analog music  = mp3 etc, not DTS/AC3 mixed music
2008-11-28T21:37:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	you won't be able to change the volume...you have to use the audio input volume control.

2008-11-28T21:38:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop		Stopping the chat, one ban at a time
2008-11-28T21:38:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	are you using an optical cable for all sources? analog and DTS?
2008-11-28T21:38:00.000Z	intercool	osxdude|laptop	yes, for all.
2008-11-28T21:39:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	then you would have to use the surround reciever's volume control.
2008-11-28T21:40:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	or, more in general, the volume control of the...audio reciever.
2008-11-28T21:40:00.000Z	intercool	osxdude|laptop	thats wierd.. DTS has only one sound level. and works great. But regular sound has to low volume to regulate on the amp, even i i crank it up to the max
2008-11-28T21:41:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	I would think on analog outputs you would have to adjust either the Volume Control's volumes, or the application's volumes.
2008-11-28T21:43:00.000Z	intercool	osxdude|laptop	when i try to controle the volume in lets say totem og rythmbox there is only "on" and "off" no volume gets modified with the slider.
2008-11-28T21:44:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	then I would check the volume control.
2008-11-28T21:45:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	that is, the mixer.
2008-11-28T21:45:00.000Z	intercool		hehe checked both alsamixer and gnome-mixer no volume control is reacting..
2008-11-28T21:45:00.000Z	intercool		have googled for it seems to be a problem that others have also
2008-11-28T21:46:00.000Z	intercool		when using optical og coax
2008-11-28T21:47:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	intercool	then it's an ubuntu bug >_<
