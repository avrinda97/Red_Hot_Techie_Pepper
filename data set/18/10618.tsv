2007-12-09T08:13:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	k done, try to install it now?
2007-12-09T08:10:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	what's your issue. Sorry I missed it.
2007-12-09T08:11:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	I had to remove cupsys b/c it gave me an error whenever I tried to install anything else, now I need to get it install again
2007-12-09T08:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	ok...
2007-12-09T08:12:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	cupsys gives me errors whenever i try to install it
2007-12-09T08:12:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	forgot that part :)
2007-12-09T08:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	try 'sudo aptitude purge cupsys' (and various other CUPS packages if needed) to remove configuration files.
2007-12-09T08:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	yeah, with install instead of purge on the command line
2007-12-09T08:14:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	putting the output on pastebin....

2007-12-09T08:19:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	something looks odd with libdns
2007-12-09T08:19:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	ok?
2007-12-09T08:24:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	so what do i do? i tried reinstalling libdns with synaptic just now, then tried installing cupsys again, still didnt work
2007-12-09T08:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	there is more detailed stuff in the logs. Check those out (browse around /var/log to find it.)
2007-12-09T08:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	I'm not really sure what to do though.
2007-12-09T08:27:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	is there another way i can use a printer without cupsys?
2007-12-09T08:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	shadowblade	there's the antiquated ways I've never tried.
2007-12-09T08:28:00.000Z	shadowblade	cellofellow	unfortunately its a dell printer (it was a gift - works really well in windows, unfortunately windows sucks at life)
