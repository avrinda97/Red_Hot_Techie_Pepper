2011-05-05T00:12:00.000Z	FoolsRun		Can anyone tell me how to run an application (actually a Java .jar file) on my machine's :0 display from SSH?
2011-05-05T00:12:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	export DISPLAY=':0'
2011-05-05T00:13:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	export DISPLAY=':0' COMMAND HERE ?
2011-05-05T00:13:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	yes, it is a command
2011-05-05T00:13:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	I mean do I use the export command on a separate line, or as part of the java -jar line?\
2011-05-05T00:14:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	different line
2011-05-05T00:14:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	or export xyz; java -jar x.jar
2011-05-05T00:15:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	I get "Can't connect to X11 window server using ':0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable."
2011-05-05T00:15:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	are you the same user?
2011-05-05T00:15:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	the same user as who?
2011-05-05T00:15:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	the same user as the person who is logged in
2011-05-05T00:16:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	I'm not, but I disabled "nolisten tcp" for X
2011-05-05T00:16:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	if you are not the same user, I don't think it works. I know very little about x
2011-05-05T00:17:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	I'll try as the same user
2011-05-05T00:17:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	in the past without doing anything I have run stuff by setting DISPLAY as the same user who was logged in
2011-05-05T00:19:00.000Z	FoolsRun	smw	the same user can't connect to :0 either
2011-05-05T00:19:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	I don't know the answer then.
2011-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	smw	FoolsRun	It works when I try to run firefox
