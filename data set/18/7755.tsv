2008-06-21T02:10:00.000Z	ipei		al, I just tested to start ubuntu with the older kernel number or something in the grub menu... It worked with that. I believe that the nvidia driver did something strange...
2008-06-21T02:11:00.000Z	ipei		al, I don't really know the difference between the chooices in the menu... But the previous worked... But How can I solve that?
2008-06-21T02:11:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	did you reinstall the nvidia driver for the new kernel? Has to be done each time you update the kernel for drivers from outside of ubuntu
2008-06-21T02:12:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Sorry, I didn't really get it... Reinstall what? :/
2008-06-21T02:12:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	the nvidia driver you got from nvidia.com
2008-06-21T02:13:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	I did install it after the update of the kernel. So, :'/
2008-06-21T02:13:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	heh. that's the reason I tend to avoid 3d party drivers
2008-06-21T02:14:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	more accurately, 3d party drivers that haven't been massaged by people who know what they are doing
2008-06-21T02:15:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Ok. But now I can only start ubuntu (with good graphics) in the previous KERNEL. wHAT SHOULD i DO?
2008-06-21T02:15:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Sorry for the caps...
2008-06-21T02:16:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Because as it is now the latest kernel will be "auto started"...
2008-06-21T02:17:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	I'd use the previous kernel for now :) You can designate which kernel gets started in /boot/grub/menu.lst , see the line with default. Start counting with 0, so the one you want is probably 2.
2008-06-21T02:18:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Yeah, ok. (This one was the third in the list, yeah :)) But will it be "auto solved" when they reales a new kenel version?
2008-06-21T02:19:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	possibly, or there'll be some info on what works on ubuntuforums.org .
2008-06-21T02:20:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Ok. If it doesn' its quite easy to reinstall Ubuntu. :)
2008-06-21T02:21:00.000Z	nickrud	ipei	heh. And, <caps> don't use stuff that doesn't come in packages! </caps>
2008-06-21T02:21:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Yeah... I know, but I thought "nvidia" was a trust able source  :P
2008-06-21T02:23:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	But I'm learning. I wont do that again... -.- Thanks for the help!
