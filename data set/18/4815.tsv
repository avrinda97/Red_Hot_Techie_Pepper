2010-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	crazygir		hiya!
2010-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	crazygir		is it possible to have two (active) ppp connections?
2010-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	crazygir		happens in windows too, so I'm wondering if it is even physically possible?
2010-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	crazygir		I have a wireless (cell) pcmcia card which connects via pptp, and then want to make pptp vpn connections, but initiating the vpn disconnects the modem..
2010-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	crazygir		seems silly not to be able to..
2010-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	crazygir		more packages
2010-04-27T07:07:00.000Z	crazygir		networking gurus unite!
2010-04-27T07:07:00.000Z	crazygir		pptp via modem & vpn, why would this not work together?
2010-04-27T07:09:00.000Z	crazygir		guess not
2010-04-27T07:09:00.000Z	crazygir		?
2010-04-27T07:10:00.000Z	pepee	crazygir	no idea, google?
2010-04-27T07:10:00.000Z	pepee	crazygir	or search for a networking-related channels
2010-04-27T07:13:00.000Z	pepee	crazygir	I'm ignorant in the matter, but - what about virtual machines?
2010-04-27T07:14:00.000Z	crazygir	pepee	how would that help, exactly?
2010-04-27T07:16:00.000Z	pepee	crazygir	as I said, I'm ignorant :)
2010-04-27T07:16:00.000Z	pepee	crazygir	attach one connection to a vm and use the vm as router
2010-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	crazygir	pepee	complication never helps.
2010-04-27T07:27:00.000Z	pepee	crazygir	same happens to me
