2011-09-17T19:22:00.000Z	warfaren		does 11.10 also have unity as default?
2011-09-17T19:22:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	Yes.
2011-10-09T23:23:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	That's a weird way to do it
2011-10-09T23:23:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	ls -l /usr # That's all you need
2011-10-09T23:24:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	Oh?... Ah I see.
2011-10-09T23:25:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	Comment sign :D
2011-10-09T23:25:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	ls # List all files in a directory
2012-01-11T14:45:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	Does "ntfsck /dev/sdz500" work? (where /dev/sdz500 is the ntfs partition)
2012-01-11T14:49:00.000Z	warfaren	theadmin	ok ran it, it said Unsupported: replay_log() Unsupported check_volume() Checking 288768 MFT records. Unsupported cases found.
2012-01-11T14:50:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	I see... Ugh, sounds like a mess to me, I dunno what to do with that. Might want to delete the NTFS partition altogether if possible and recreate it... idk
2012-01-11T14:52:00.000Z	warfaren	theadmin	yay... :( well do you think the hard drive will be found by my windows install disc if i remove all the partitons? because i don't understand, it's like it doesn't even find the physical harddrive. and it should be the correct driver (i got the exact driver for the chipset lspci told me it was)
2012-01-11T14:53:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	I had a similar problem when Windows wouldn't find a drive with a messed up partition table even though the drive was working :/
2012-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	I did: sudo fdisk /dev/sdz <<< "o" to remove all partitions, and it worked thereafter (replace "/dev/sdz" with your drive)
2012-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	warfaren	theadmin	okay i'll do that if i can't work it out any other way. thanks
2012-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	(from a liveCD though. Or a install on another drive. Not from a working Ubuntu system, won't work)
2012-01-11T15:06:00.000Z	warfaren	theadmin	okay, i'll run that fdisk command now but it doesn't seem to work. it says Warning: DOS-compatible mode is deprecated. It's strongly recommended to switch off the mode (command 'c') and change display units to sectors (command 'u').
2012-01-11T15:06:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	Huh... weird.
2012-01-15T18:17:00.000Z	theadmin	warfaren	Eh. Maverick. Unity wasn't even out back then :P
