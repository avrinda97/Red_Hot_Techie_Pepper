2007-05-18T08:36:00.000Z	meezyfuh		how do i join .001 .002 .003 etc files?
2007-05-18T08:38:00.000Z	meezyfuh		can anyone tell me how to combine files that are split via file.001 file.002 etc?
2007-05-18T08:38:00.000Z	Falstius	meezyfuh	probably unrar, but that's just a guess.
2007-05-18T08:39:00.000Z	meezyfuh	Falstius	it's a rar file split file.rar.001 file.rar.002, etc
2007-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	meezyfuh		ok lemme try
2007-05-18T08:41:00.000Z	Falstius	meezyfuh	run unrar on the first file and it should find the rest automatically.
2007-05-18T08:41:00.000Z	meezyfuh		it says it's not a RAR archive.
2007-05-18T08:41:00.000Z	meezyfuh		isn't there a copy option? or am i thinking of windows?
2007-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	Falstius	meezyfuh	copy what?  Its possible your rar file is corrupted.  Or meant to be a virus on a windows system.
2007-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	meezyfuh	Falstius	it's like someone made a single rar file and split it up.
2007-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	meezyfuh		if you had several text files for instance, and wanted to combine them into one, how would you do it?
2007-05-18T08:43:00.000Z	Falstius	meezyfuh	you would use cat.  cat file1 file2 file3 > big_file
2007-05-18T08:43:00.000Z	meezyfuh	Falstius	tanks let me try this
2007-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	Falstius	meezyfuh	but I'd be really surprised if someone did that considering that rar is almost exclusively used to make multiple part archives.
2007-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	meezyfuh	Falstius	some people are stupid. he might have just made a single rar and used jsplit or something.
2007-05-18T08:49:00.000Z	meezyfuh	Falstius	the cat worked, thank you so much!!
2007-05-18T08:49:00.000Z	Falstius	meezyfuh	if you know the person who did it, tell them they're an idiot :)
2007-05-18T08:49:00.000Z	meezyfuh	Falstius	will do :P
