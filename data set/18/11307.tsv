2006-08-24T12:51:00.000Z	Orasis1		Has anyone noticed a drastic ammount of slow down after upgrading?
2006-08-24T12:51:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	I've talked to a couple of other people who have asked that question
2006-08-24T12:51:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	Are you experiencing the same thing?
2006-08-24T12:52:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	no, but I haven't updated yet.  You updated to dapper?
2006-08-24T12:52:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	No I simply upgraded my packages on Synaptic, I was already on dapper
2006-08-24T12:52:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	oh, so just packages from the past day, or a few days?
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	run top, see what's using all the cpu
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	top, runs in a terminal, lists out currently running processes and what resources they are consuming
2006-08-24T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	the biggest consumers at the top
2006-08-24T12:58:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	You have to be kidding me.. that was there all this time?
2006-08-24T12:58:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	that goes back to bsd unix, yes  :)
2006-08-24T12:58:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	I was typing all this -=> ps -e -o pcpu,cpu,nice,state,cputime,args --sort pcpu | sed '/^ 0.0 /d'
2006-08-24T12:58:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	lol, well thanks for saving me future time :P
2006-08-24T12:58:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	you're welcome  :)
2006-08-24T13:00:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	Does top show "all" processes?, Because I do not see "Fluxbox" in that list..
2006-08-24T13:01:00.000Z	sethk	Orasis1	if you make your terminal big enough, it will, otherwise it shows however many lines there are
2006-08-24T13:02:00.000Z	Orasis1	sethk	Gotcha
