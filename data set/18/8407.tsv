2007-08-24T11:42:00.000Z	SystemOverload		Hey guys.
2007-08-24T11:42:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	Hi.
2007-08-24T11:44:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	It's just with 1129 people in here it's easy for text to get lost, so the more people that put their response on one line makes it easier for us to read the data and process it and come up with an appropriate response.
2007-08-24T11:46:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	They both have their advantages and such. Both are supported about the same but I think the IRC support for Gnome is better than KUbuntu. But both of them are about as well built and stable. Just try both and see I guess. You can run both at the same time. Personally I like KDE better because it's more like Winblows than Gnome so I'm more used to it.
2007-08-24T11:47:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	Yup.
2007-08-24T11:48:00.000Z	SystemOverload	MrObvious	can I switch between them by restarting? And lets say I wan't to have a dual boot, how would I go about doing this?
2007-08-24T11:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	No you don't need to dual boot. It's integrated into Ubuntu.
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	SystemOverload	MrObvious	I mean't if I wanted to have a dual boot of windows on my computer.
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	You'll just choose your login manager (probably GDM would be better (Gnome based)) and you can choose Gnome or KDE. There are also other WMs available such as Enlightenment, etc.
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	Oh yeah you'll need to dual boot with Winblows. That's how I do it but I hate having to dual boot just to run a Winblows program that I can't run through wine.
2007-08-24T11:50:00.000Z	SystemOverload	MrObvious	I know it sucks :(
2007-08-24T11:50:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	What do you run in Winblows that you'll need to dual boot?
2007-08-24T11:51:00.000Z	SystemOverload	MrObvious	I am a bit of a gamer, and I may need to play some games.
2007-08-24T11:51:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	Ahh.
2007-08-24T11:52:00.000Z	SystemOverload	MrObvious	even though I play alot of games, Windows is just too bloated and runs slowly.
2007-08-24T11:53:00.000Z	SystemOverload	MrObvious	I also want to make sure that my hardware is all compatable with Ubuntu.
2007-08-24T11:53:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	I hear you. There are some things you can do to make the experience with Winblows better at least. I'm an expert at that so if you want some advice you can join me in #eocf.
2007-08-24T11:54:00.000Z	MrObvious	SystemOverload	In fact I'm on Winblows now at work.
