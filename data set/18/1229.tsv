2011-08-07T21:35:00.000Z	gulzar		urgent....I downloaded a video from youtube and want to use it in ppt for my college presentation but libreoffice  is not saving the video even after adding it from insert menu. I think the problem is in the format. If so then which format should I use? Pitivi is installed. If not then how to do it?
2011-08-07T21:35:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	are you sure the ppt file would include the video file itself and not just a link to it
2011-08-07T21:38:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	you could try using ffmpeg or mencoder to convert the file to another format, but i have no idea what format would work better
2011-08-07T22:14:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	are you sure that the video is supposed to be saved in the file.=
2011-08-07T22:15:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	I want to do so. Is it possible?
2011-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	i dont know, but i wouldn't be surprised if the normal behavior of the application is for the video to not be embedded but instead to be referenced by a relative path
2011-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	ummmm big prob..
2011-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	urlin2u: need some WINE for this..
2012-03-04T21:51:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	probably not but poppler-utils will have a pdftotext utility
2012-03-04T21:51:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	Ok will check it
2012-03-04T21:58:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	no dear.. no help with poppler. It converts but not to odt :(
2012-03-04T21:58:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	like i said i dont think you can get to odt in one shot
2012-03-04T21:59:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	any other way.. indirect way will also work. websites are there whcih convert online but having something offline is of great help
2012-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	i dont know of a way sorry
2012-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	no prob.. atleast I get to know abotu poppler. :) Thank You
2012-03-04T22:16:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	nice.. I thought of not puting him on CLI
2012-03-04T22:17:00.000Z	escott	gulzar	you never know what will be easier for someone, CLI or GUI. usually i just see if one starts to go bad and then try the other
2012-03-04T22:18:00.000Z	gulzar	escott	agree
