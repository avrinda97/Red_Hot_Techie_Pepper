2010-03-31T06:24:00.000Z	oopsfire		Any one know a good app to diagnose/fix bad sectors on a hd outside of fsck which is not doing the trick?
2010-03-31T06:25:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	if the disk is bad best to backup
2010-03-31T06:25:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	partition table broken?
2010-03-31T06:26:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	what does fsck say?
2010-03-31T06:27:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	thats not an indication the disk is still ood
2010-03-31T06:28:00.000Z	oopsfire	acicula	Right, I'd like to be able to mount the partition, so I can back it up if possible,, then replace the hd
2010-03-31T06:28:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	fsck has a badblocks option and autofix and such, you could try to et it to sort the issues with that
2010-03-31T06:29:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	as a recovery method, using dd to dump it contents works in absense of a working filesystem
2010-03-31T06:29:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	cooling the disks can also help with datarecovery
2010-03-31T06:29:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	carefull that you select test only, bb also has an intensive surface test option that erases data
2010-03-31T06:30:00.000Z	oopsfire	acicula	Lolgrr.. I even put the hd in the fridge for a few minutes as I've heard that, and have knocked it around a bit heh. I was able to get the pc to boot in to ubuntu once,, and it locked up and I haven't been ale to get in since
2010-03-31T06:31:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	dont boot the disk, use a livecd, do a quick check and go straight to dumping your data
2010-03-31T06:31:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	id start with windows
2010-03-31T06:32:00.000Z	oopsfire	acicula	right
2010-03-31T06:32:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	i mean with dumping the win partition since that works
2010-03-31T06:32:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	try dumping the partition with dd
2010-03-31T06:33:00.000Z	oopsfire	acicula	You wouldn't happen to have a link that explains it a bit in detail?
2010-03-31T06:34:00.000Z	acicula	oopsfire	see the datarecovery link it details doing it with dd
