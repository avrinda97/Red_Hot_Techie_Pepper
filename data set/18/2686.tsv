2011-01-17T18:33:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	I'm not sure WINE is such a great solution for gaming. but that is my opninion :)
2011-01-17T18:34:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	do you think oyu can play games just because of that?
2011-01-17T18:34:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	it's more complicated than that
2011-01-17T18:35:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	yes, but you can't run windows software in Linux
2011-01-17T18:35:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	without some sort of emulation
2011-01-17T18:36:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	boot into windows when you want to game, that's what I do
2011-01-17T18:37:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	well, if you're set on gaming on Linux, then try WINE or Cedega
2011-01-17T18:40:00.000Z	tobier	ogo0p	that's not a proper question
