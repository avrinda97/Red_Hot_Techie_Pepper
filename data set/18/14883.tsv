2005-06-16T15:19:00.000Z	pfp		sudo emacs -nw /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-06-16T15:20:00.000Z	pfp		hmm, dunno :)
2005-06-16T15:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	you mean "vi /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2005-06-16T15:22:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	of course i meant ${EDITOR} /boot/grub... ;)
2005-06-16T15:52:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	and why not?
2005-06-16T15:53:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	if he has to ask what's ssh, he prolly doesnt have ssh-server installed. he has broken X it seems
2005-06-16T15:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	I thought ssh defaults
2005-06-16T15:54:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	thing is, his keyboard/video doesn't respond, and i thought maybe he could ssh into his machine to reboot it safely. but sshD isn't installed by default
2005-06-16T15:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	ouchies....
2005-06-16T15:57:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	why _reinstall_ just because the machine crashed once?
2005-06-16T15:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	oh, this is first boot?
2005-06-18T05:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	Azureus just uses all my CPU, and cripples me
2005-06-18T05:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	lemme see
2005-06-18T06:07:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	(or anyone) what's your recommended choice for installing j2sdk?
2005-06-18T07:23:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	uk.archive.... seems to work (as fi. is same as uk.)
2005-06-18T07:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	pfp	ok
2005-06-21T14:46:00.000Z	pfp	Razor-X	i do, but there's no ~/.wine/config
