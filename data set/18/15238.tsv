2005-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	AlinuxOS		hello, I've recompiled 2.6.12 kernel. but at the boot I have this messages ERROR: Removing 'generic': Device or resource busy
2005-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	AlinuxOS		swsusp: Suspend partition has wrong signature?
2005-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	AlinuxOS		 what does they mean?
2005-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	why did you compile it?
2005-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	and it means that you tried to resume without having suspended, which is fine
2005-09-12T15:32:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	bob2	I compiled it because, my computer shutdowns himself..
2005-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	bob2	and it means that you tried to resume without having suspended, which is fine? so how can I fix it?
2005-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	what?
2005-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	there's nothing to fix
2005-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	you can't, leave it alone
2005-09-12T15:35:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	bob2	? alone ?
2005-09-12T15:35:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	just don't touch it
2005-09-12T15:35:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	bob2	yuo think there is no fix-es and it's not problematic ...you mean that ?
2005-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	there's nothing to fix
2005-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	bob2	thanks
2005-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	bob2	and another thing...
2005-09-12T15:38:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	the simple solution is "don't compile your own kernel"
2005-09-12T15:38:00.000Z	bob2	AlinuxOS	since you left things out
