2009-07-14T00:46:00.000Z	ghostknife	pup	keys are what you use to encrypt/decrypt. you have 2 keys a public/private. you send people your public. then they send you a message encrypted with your public, which only you (who has the private key) can decrypt

2009-07-14T00:49:00.000Z	pup	ghostknife	does key sharing help?
2009-07-14T00:49:00.000Z	ghostknife	pup	to start having fun with it, get yourself a key, and start signing your e-mail messages with this
2009-07-14T00:49:00.000Z	ghostknife	pup	yes. if you make your "public key"
2009-07-14T00:50:00.000Z	ghostknife	pup	yes. if you make your "public key" public on a key server, then people can look it up to verify messages you send, and to also encrypt messages they send to you
2009-07-14T00:50:00.000Z	pup	ghostknife	how do i get myself a key?
2009-07-14T00:51:00.000Z	ghostknife	pup	because people need your key to verify your messages and to encrypt messages they send to you. so you need to either send it to them, or make it public (which is safe). as long as you keep your private key secure, you can give your public key to anyone
2009-07-14T00:52:00.000Z	ghostknife	pup	goto Applications->Accessories->Passwords and Encryption Keys
