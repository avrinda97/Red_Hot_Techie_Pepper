2007-03-09T10:14:00.000Z	colbert	mjunx	I got the same I/O error now after remounting  when trying to move files :(
2007-03-09T10:15:00.000Z	mjunx	colbert	maybe you need to fsck that partition
2007-03-09T10:15:00.000Z	colbert	mjunx	Ok I will
2007-03-09T10:16:00.000Z	colbert	mjunx	lol how do I use fsck to scan my mounted /dev/sda1 ?
2007-03-09T10:16:00.000Z	mjunx	colbert	you gotta umount it first
2007-03-09T10:18:00.000Z	colbert	mjunx	fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)| fsck: fsck.ntfs-3g: not found | fsck: Error 2 while executing fsck.ntfs-3g for /dev/sda1
2007-03-09T10:18:00.000Z	mjunx	colbert	you might need to boot with a windows cd and use its system recovery dealy to run chkdsk
2007-03-09T10:19:00.000Z	colbert	mjunx	Ok
