2008-02-01T18:40:00.000Z	coolbhavi		Hello
2008-02-01T18:40:00.000Z	coolbhavi		is It possible to use ubuntu desktop drivers on ubuntu server?
2008-02-01T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	it is yes, but if you need a gui it's better to install the desktop version from the CD
2008-02-01T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	Andycass1 are these wirless cards ?
2008-02-01T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	why are you runninb the server edition ?
2008-02-01T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	as in what was your purpose for selecting the server edition
2008-02-01T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	but why the server edition
2008-02-01T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	the desktop edition can do all the server edition can for most situations
2008-02-01T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	but why are you using the server install, and not the desktop
2008-02-01T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	you'll find the desktop edtition much better for home use on a lot of fronts
2008-02-01T18:45:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	curious to know what ?
2008-02-01T18:45:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	install the desktop edition, you'll find it a better learning tool and it more suited to home use
2008-02-01T18:45:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	install it via synaptic
2008-02-01T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	that is the answer to your question
2008-02-01T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	however as a learning tool I suggest you use the desktop edition as the gui is more intergrated and bonus's like restricted driver compatiblilty for example works
2008-02-01T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	if you can't figure out the names of obvious packages - you should not be running the server edition

2008-02-01T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	coolbhavi	but none of that appears technical contribution ?
