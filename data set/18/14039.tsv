2005-11-22T09:26:00.000Z	z3r0x		I have an error with my mct_u232 module -> MCT USB-RS232: unsupported baudrate request, I found a patch for kernel 2.6.12-rc2 and I have 2.6.12-9-386. Can I use this patch?
2005-11-22T09:27:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	probably, yes.
2005-11-22T09:27:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	how can I use the patch? where can I find a tutorial how to patch a kernel?
2005-11-22T09:27:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	You will need to fetch 'build-essential', 'kernel-package', 'libncurses5-dev' and 'gcc-3.4'
2005-11-22T09:28:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	.. and the kernel source.
2005-11-22T09:28:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	I already installed this package..but how can I patch it?
2005-11-22T09:29:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	via the 'patch' command.
2005-11-22T09:29:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	cd into the kernel source directory, then run 'patch -p1 --dry-run < /path/to/the/patchfile.diff'
2005-11-22T09:29:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	oh didn't know that there is a patch command. thx I'll look at the manpage
2005-11-22T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	That TRIED to patch, will print an errors that would occur, but doesn't apply any changes.
2005-11-22T09:30:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	do I have to unload the module first
2005-11-22T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	Not now, no.
2005-11-22T09:31:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	ok and do I have to recompile the kernel or do something after patching it?
2005-11-22T09:33:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	stupid question...I cant find /usr/src/linux....there is only a rpm directory
2005-11-22T09:34:00.000Z	cafuego	z3r0x	yes, you will need to rebuild the kernel.
2005-11-22T09:35:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	with make && make modules_install ?
2005-11-22T09:39:00.000Z	z3r0x	cafuego	hm it couldn't find the file... drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c
