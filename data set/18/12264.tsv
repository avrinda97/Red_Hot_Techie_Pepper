2008-01-18T02:14:00.000Z	CruCio		My Ubuntu Terminal says that YUM is not installed
2008-01-18T02:14:00.000Z	CruCio		why ?
2008-01-18T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	ubuntu does not use yum
2008-01-18T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	flash player plugin package is currently broke
2008-01-18T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	apt-get inmstall xchat or xchat-gnome
2008-01-19T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	everythin in #ubuntu is x86 generic
2008-01-19T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	you are using PPC then
2008-01-19T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	x86 (i386-base packages) will not work
2008-01-19T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	no
2008-01-19T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	1.) the flash package is broke 2.) the PPC port of ubuntu is community support
2008-01-19T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	x86 arch is the current mass deployment
2008-01-19T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	no, thats not what I'm saying
2008-01-19T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	I'm saying ubuntu doesn't support the PPC port on the PS3 so it's up to the community what is packaged
2008-01-19T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	no-one does anymore after apple stopped making them
2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	thats a server platform
2008-01-19T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	no you don't know, or you wouldn't keep asking about PPC PC's
2008-01-19T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	then stop asking about it
2008-01-19T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	CruCio	I don't thin kit's in the community repo's
