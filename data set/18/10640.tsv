2007-07-26T13:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gordonjcp	His monitor isn't showing anything, I figured getting ssh to work would at least let us have some interaction
2007-07-26T13:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jordan_U	yeah, but Ubuntu doesn't install sshd by default
2007-07-26T13:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gordonjcp	He installed it blind from a tty :) ( hopefully it worked )
2007-07-26T13:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gordonjcp	We did that, he didn't see anything but we hopefully installed ssh from there.

2009-05-15T02:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jordan_U	it does a good job of looking like a random poorly-written script
2009-05-15T02:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gordonjcp	I believe Alberto Milone is also a regular Ubunut developer, and again it is available in the repositories ( though universe, not main )

2009-05-15T02:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jordan_U	good for you
2009-05-15T02:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jordan_U	you're the first person I've ever heard of with the open drivers working
2012-08-27T00:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gordonjcp	On Ubuntu the grub menu is hidden when Ubuntu is the only OS, you have to hold shift to see it.
2012-08-27T00:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jordan_U	not here it's not
2012-08-27T00:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jordan_U	stock install of Precise amd64
2012-08-27T00:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gordonjcp	I don't know why it didn't happen for you, but that *is* the default for systems with only one OS (Ubuntu) installed.]
