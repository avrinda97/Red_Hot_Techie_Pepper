2012-01-18T00:38:00.000Z	psp-0854		ya it might be a faulty burn
2012-01-18T00:38:00.000Z	psp-0854		try burning at no more than 8x
2012-01-18T00:38:00.000Z	psp-0854		do you have virtualbox?
2012-01-18T00:39:00.000Z	psp-0854		ya ubu soft center
2012-01-18T00:39:00.000Z	psp-0854		virtualbox
2012-01-18T00:39:00.000Z	psp-0854		you can test your images there first
2012-01-18T00:40:00.000Z	psp-0854		aeon:  it helps me verify the download
2012-01-18T00:41:00.000Z	psp-0854		aeon: looks like I have homework
2012-01-18T00:41:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	OK I'll try reburning then following the virtualbox approach
2012-01-18T00:46:00.000Z	psp-0854	user123456987	 have you tested unity yet?
2012-01-18T00:47:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	I read somewhere that the drivers are included in the newer ubuntu versions
2012-01-18T00:49:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	I don't understand, what's isomaster and what's unbooting?
2012-01-18T00:51:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	so it's `sudo apt-get install unebootin'?
2012-01-18T00:52:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	aeon-ltd, OK everybody, I'll try reburning BBS
2012-01-18T01:09:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	aeon-ltd, kristoffer,  I've reburned and still nothing. I have an idea though. Does grub have a command for forcing a boot from the CD?
2012-01-18T01:13:00.000Z	user123456987	psp-0854	aeon-ltd, kristoffer,  OK I solved the problem, my computer's boot menu was buggy. I changed boot hierarchy in computer setup and now it has loaded the LiveCD
