2006-08-07T05:29:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Warbo	thanks ill try it
2006-08-07T05:30:00.000Z	Warbo	h3h_timo	If it is an installer you may need to let it access the system, so "sudo sh filename.sh" would do that
2006-08-07T05:31:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Warbo	im installing unreal tournament 2004, and it uses a sh script... do you know any other mainstream games that are able to be played in linux??
2006-08-17T14:29:00.000Z	Warbo	h3h_timo	As in, the window borders, or the panel?
2006-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Warbo	its the entire top window panel
2006-08-17T14:32:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Warbo	like wehre it says #ubuntu at the top up here, its not showing when i run compiz
2006-08-17T14:34:00.000Z	Warbo	h3h_timo	Make sure the "decoration" plugin is loaded. If the worst comes to the worst the "compiz --replace decoration" might help
2006-08-17T14:34:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Warbo	what is the application to customize compiz??
2006-08-17T14:35:00.000Z	Warbo	h3h_timo	The one I know of is gset-compiz, but I think that is out dated
2006-08-17T14:38:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Warbo	i have no idea how to fix this
