2011-03-04T00:34:00.000Z	magn3ts		This is really urgent: is there a log of GNOME remote desktop connections made?
2011-03-04T00:35:00.000Z	magn3ts		because someone's been remoted into my PC for a few hours
2011-03-04T00:35:00.000Z	magn3ts		I already disconnected them
2011-03-04T00:36:00.000Z	magn3ts		I'm at Uni, no control. I normally don't have VNC turned on.
2011-03-04T00:36:00.000Z	magn3ts		The weird thing is... they brute forced a very hard password... or GNOME's implementation has a security flaw.
2011-03-04T00:36:00.000Z	magn3ts		I mean, my password was 20 characters long....
2011-03-04T00:37:00.000Z	magn3ts		Are you telling me Vino has known exploits ilessthan3ubuntu ?
2011-03-04T00:37:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	magn3ts	i thought you guys said vnc
2011-03-04T00:37:00.000Z	magn3ts	ilessthan3ubuntu	Vino is VNC.
2011-03-04T00:38:00.000Z	magn3ts		I think this should now be tagged as a security vulnerability since multiple people with complex passwords protecting their Vino servers have been compromised. It makes me think that Vino is vulnerable to the same vulnerability, or something similar, as below.
2011-03-04T00:38:00.000Z	magn3ts		That's a quote...
2011-03-04T00:38:00.000Z	magn3ts		and really concerning.
2011-03-04T00:38:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	magn3ts	then im saying your pwd makes no difference depending on the vuln.
2011-03-04T00:39:00.000Z	magn3ts	ilessthan3ubuntu	... I understand that... but are we just jumping to assuming that Vino has vulnerabilities? Known ones?
2011-03-04T00:39:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	magn3ts	idk, lets look
2011-03-04T00:40:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu		why is it called vino and not vnc again?
2011-03-04T00:40:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu		nevermind, gnome
2011-03-04T00:40:00.000Z	magn3ts	ilessthan3ubuntu	Vino is the GNOME impl of VNC server
