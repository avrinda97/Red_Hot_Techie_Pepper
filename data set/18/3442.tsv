2009-11-20T09:35:00.000Z	losha	flanders	I'm curious. Why would you want to split at fixed intervals. They're unlikely to coincide with breaks in the audio?
2009-11-20T09:35:00.000Z	flanders	losha	it's for my car's audio player. The seek function is horrible (VERY slow.)
2009-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	losha	flanders	um, try wavbreaker (disclaimer: I've never used this myself)
2009-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	flanders	losha	so what I do is split automatically at every 60 seconds. If I want to continue where I left off (podcast episode, for example), I can just quickly skip to the track # I left off on.
2009-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	flanders	losha	is it a plugin for k3b or another application entirely?
2009-11-20T09:37:00.000Z	losha	flanders	sorry, it's a separate app. You did ask for a k3b feature....
2009-11-20T09:38:00.000Z	flanders	losha	I can use mp3splt-gtk to split the mp3 podcasts, but I was hoping K3B had a similar feature that Brasero has: auto-split tracks.
2009-11-20T09:38:00.000Z	flanders	losha	Brasero is acting really goofy for me. It doesn't seem to unmount discs when erasing them or when burning, and this has ruined some of my CDs.
2009-11-20T09:38:00.000Z	losha	flanders	brasero is incredibly buggy. Not sure why....
2009-11-20T09:39:00.000Z	flanders	losha	also, Brasero puts the FIRST 60 seconds as the LAST track, but the rest are in proper order. This seems like a bug that was overlooked.
2009-11-20T09:39:00.000Z	losha	flanders	well, I don't see any google hits for k3b and autosplit....
2009-11-20T09:40:00.000Z	flanders	losha	no problem, thanks for trying though.
2009-11-20T09:41:00.000Z	losha	flanders	actually, this site says it can split files, so poke around: http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-extra-gear&m=111866789022998&w=2
2009-11-20T09:42:00.000Z	flanders	losha	I know it can split manually, but that's tedious.
2009-11-20T09:42:00.000Z	losha	flanders	oh, right. Back to square one, then...
2009-11-20T09:43:00.000Z	flanders	losha	if only GNOME programs weren't so buggy.
2009-11-20T09:44:00.000Z	flanders	losha	ironically, even though I use the GNOME desktop, I find myself preferring KDE applications.
2009-11-20T09:44:00.000Z	losha	flanders	the solution to *that* is to learn to use the cli versions....
