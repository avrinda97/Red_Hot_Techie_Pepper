2007-03-29T08:46:00.000Z	shiva		for up grade
2007-03-29T08:46:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	nothing.  Put stuff in /var/www
2007-03-29T08:48:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	You've already got it setup.  Just put stuff in your document root (/var/www) and you're done.
2007-03-29T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	What?  LAMP is just the httpd, your network configuration is independant of it
2007-03-29T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	`:q`
2007-03-29T13:30:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	hit escape, then `:q` and hit enter
2007-03-29T13:37:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	`sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start` if you installed ubuntu.  then ctrl-alt-f7
2007-03-29T13:39:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	If you installed the server version, and nothing else, then you don't have a GUI currently
2007-03-29T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	there's no different in linux between a "desktop" and a "server".  They both can run server-ish stuff, and desktop-ish stuff.
2007-03-29T13:48:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	unless you install one
2007-03-29T13:49:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	No.  YOu've already installed the server, you already have Apache, PHP, SQL, etc installed.
2007-03-29T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	there's a howto here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
2007-03-30T08:09:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
2008-11-10T02:50:00.000Z	Flannel	shiva	He meant #kubuntu
