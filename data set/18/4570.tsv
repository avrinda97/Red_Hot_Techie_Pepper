2011-09-03T22:23:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	what should the package "updates" do?
2011-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	there is no package updates, maybe you mean "sudo apt-get upate && sudo apt-get install foobar"?
2011-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	dexter_	iceroot	Yeah, that.But I can't install packages.
2011-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	what package e.g.?
2011-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	dexter_	iceroot	installing htem from ubuntu tweak.... chromium, transmission....\
2011-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	what is the output of "sudo apt-get install transmission"?
2011-09-03T22:26:00.000Z	dexter_	iceroot	It worked b/c I alread have the PPA but Tweak makes it easier. It's installing.
2011-09-03T22:27:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	so its working fine?
2011-09-03T22:28:00.000Z	dexter_	iceroot	I guess,  just don't want to install one by one. Ubuntu tweak said their were problems or whatever. After going to synaptic to fix it still didn't work. What is the command to install updates? sudo apt-get install update ?
2011-09-03T22:28:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	sudo apt-get install package1 package2 package3
2011-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	dexter_	iceroot	What's package 1, 2... Do I insert a name?
2011-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	to install updates use "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2011-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	dexter_	iceroot	Did it change in Natty?
2011-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	iceroot	dexter_	if you want to install the package transmission and firefox use "sudo apt-get install transmission firefox"
