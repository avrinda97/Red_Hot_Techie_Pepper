2007-09-20T08:38:00.000Z	ShackJack		Hi all - nautilus is not auto-mounting USB pen drives... I plug in and the device shows in /deb/sdb and lsusb list the device, but it doesn't show in my computer or on the desktop - any ideas ?
2007-09-20T08:38:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	have you edited your /etc/fstab?
2007-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	once edited "sudo mount -a"
2007-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	I had to make an adjustment for Virtual Box, but restored it to original...
2007-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	Dr_willis I would like the drive to be auto mounted ... compuer sees the drive and it goes in /deb/sd* but doesn't show n nautilus... (I have display volumes set)
2007-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	? have you added /dev/sdb(1?) to /etc/fstab
2007-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	No I have not...
2007-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	ps its /dev not /deb ;0)~
2007-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	i hope
2007-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	oh and thats probably your problem right there
2007-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	Yeah, type... I have not added anything to fstab.. I shouldn't have to though, I wouldn't think... DOesn't nautilus/ubuntu support automounting... I also have another computer - same issue... when drive *is* in fstab but doesn't show on Nautilus...
2007-09-20T08:43:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	it's strange? as my usb drives automount
2007-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	Yep, habe the issue on two computers... I have a usb HD in fstab and it doens't show in nautilus, those I can access at /media/DriveName
2007-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	to automount internal/external drives you can edit /etc/fstab but USB drives hould by default do it
2007-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	It's very frustrating... thinking of resort to reinstalling Ubuntu - the icky Windows way to fix a problem...
2007-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	by show in nautilus do you mean on the desktop?
2007-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	ShackJack	keito	Desktop and Computer (yes I have show volumes checked)
2007-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	keito	ShackJack	in computer it should be in /media/DriveName. is it not there anywhere?
