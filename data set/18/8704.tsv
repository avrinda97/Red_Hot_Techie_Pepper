2007-07-08T12:37:00.000Z	Fezzler		is "rmdir" the commandline to remove a directory?
2007-07-08T12:38:00.000Z	Fezzler		for example "sudo rmdir /usr/home/myhome/myvideo will remove myvideo directory?
2007-07-08T12:39:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	rmdir only works on empty directories
2007-07-08T12:39:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	if you want to delete the directory and the stuff inside, use "rm -rf"
2007-07-08T12:40:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	use sudo
2007-07-08T13:43:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	the file /etc/group might be close ish...
2007-07-08T13:44:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	anyone in "adm" is an admin for example
2007-07-08T13:44:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	anyone in /etc/sudoers can use sudo and it should say in there something about adm ALL
2007-07-09T16:31:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	thats not supposed to happen, and i dont know how to fix it
2007-07-09T16:32:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	ctrl alt backspace restarts X
2007-07-09T16:33:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	i dont know why your panels are freezing. how much ram do you have? are there a lot of applets on the panels?  is a lot of other junk running?
2007-07-09T16:34:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-07-09T05:21:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	places is part of the menu in the gnome panel.  you could try using not-gnome
2007-07-09T05:22:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	oh wait real quick "free -m"
2007-07-09T05:23:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	see if a lot of resources are in use.  gnome is a bit heavy, so if youre pushing it on memory usage, xfce may be better
2007-07-09T05:24:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	yes
2007-07-09T05:24:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	recmydesk is rather mem-hogging, if i recall correctly
2007-07-09T05:25:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Fezzler	go to the first VT and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
