2012-10-26T22:56:00.000Z	Ron-		hi, i've a problem, my burnet image of ubuntu is not able to install the latest version. there are errors
2012-10-26T22:56:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	what errors do you get?
2012-10-26T22:59:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	"unable to find medium for live cd"
2012-10-26T23:01:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	then i'd do as was suggested and check the md5sum to make sure the download was not corrupt
2012-10-26T23:01:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	did that
2012-10-26T23:01:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	They match?
2012-10-26T23:01:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	yes
2012-10-26T23:02:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	this could be due to either a faulty drive like gogeta said, the CD burned incorrectly or the ISO you downloaded wasn't correct
2012-10-26T23:08:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	gogeta not sure here what it might stems from
2012-10-26T23:09:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	is your computer capable of booting from USB and do you have a spare USB stick lying around?
2012-10-26T23:11:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	i've 2gb at the car
2012-10-26T23:11:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	the reason i ask is i always install using a USB, then you dont waste CD's, its faster and if your drive is broken or not working right you avoided that problem
2012-10-26T23:13:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	is it easy to make a usb install nowdays?
2012-10-26T23:13:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	Easy peasy, are you on Windows now?
2012-10-26T23:13:00.000Z	Ron-	arthur_	yes

2012-10-26T23:14:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	yes it should be fine
2012-10-26T23:15:00.000Z	arthur_	Ron-	more than welcome
