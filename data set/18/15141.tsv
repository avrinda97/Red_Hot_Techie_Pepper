2006-12-05T08:29:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	sometimes that card works with ubuntu native drivers and other times it needs ndiswrapper to work
2006-12-05T08:30:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	great.  do as frying_fish suggests
2006-12-05T08:31:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	you'll have to press the button, sometimes for a few seconds until it lights up
2006-12-05T08:32:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	I have an HP/compaq as well and its probably quite similar in how it functions
2006-12-05T08:32:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	you may have to press it a few times or even hold it for a second or two
2006-12-05T08:33:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	yes indeed.  the light probably needs to be on which I believe means that the radio is functional
2006-12-05T08:34:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	what is the output of ndiswrapper -l
2006-12-05T08:38:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	no, dmesg |grep ndiswrapper is the command, you type that into a console on your desktop and then you paste the output to the pastebin
2006-12-05T08:39:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	then it seems like you dont have ndiswrapper working :)
2006-12-05T08:40:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	what is the output of lsmod |grep ndis
2006-12-05T08:42:00.000Z	Gumby	lewyjh	ok, how about this...  dpkg -l ndisw*
