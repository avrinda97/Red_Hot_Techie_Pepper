2006-10-24T07:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		I have a built-in speaker on a desktop computer that plays system bell sounds, and played the little background music of the Win XP Home OEM-supplied end-user config stuff (which I declined).  How can I make all sounds (music, etc.) play through this speaker, rather than only through the headphone jack?
2006-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	unplug your headphones
2006-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	They aren't plugged in.
2006-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	or plug those speakers to the headphone jack
2006-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	They're internal speakers.  that would involve soldering inside the machine.  There must be a better way than that.
2006-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	ah, that speaker. that cant be done, to my knowledge :)
2006-10-24T07:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	Well it must be possible to make it do something other than beep, b/c Windows can use it :S
2006-10-24T07:55:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	that speaker is just connected to a tonegenerator on the motherboard, for system beeps. you mean windows plays music on that one?
2006-10-24T07:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	Yes, or at least it played the background music for the OEM-to-end-user setup.  I declined the EULA, so I don't know any further than that.
2006-10-24T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	yes, well, you cant play your mp3s through there, if thats what you mean :)
2006-10-24T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	its not in any way connected to your soundcard; just a simple tone generator
2006-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	Then how was it playing that stuff?
2006-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	the software just tells it what tones to create, and it does. its like the ringtones of a cellular phone
2006-10-24T08:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	Sounded more complex than that, but maybe not.
2006-11-26T08:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	Is the text file with the package names one per line or all in a row?
2006-11-26T08:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	all in one line, with just spaces between. i though that would simplify things :)
2006-11-26T08:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nolimitsoya	It does - you can leave out xargs from that line then.
2006-11-26T08:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tonyyarusso	so, 'cat <filename> | apt-get install'?
