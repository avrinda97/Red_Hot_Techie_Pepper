2011-03-25T22:29:00.000Z	d1rty		is there a kernel parameter to disabled sound completely? I really don't like having to blacklist a ton of sound modules..
2011-03-25T22:30:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	why disable sounds in the kernel? ... just don't start alsa ... or mute it
2011-03-25T22:30:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	also make sure to disable the pcspkr module
2011-03-25T22:32:00.000Z	d1rty	candyban	because i want to disable sound....
2011-03-25T22:33:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	if you hate the "beep" at the console ... it does not stop by disabling the sound
2011-03-25T22:33:00.000Z	d1rty	candyban	look bro, this is a server
2011-03-25T22:35:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	If you're worried about bloat, then why don't you just compile your own kernel with only the required modules?
2011-03-25T22:36:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	if it is a server, it will probably not produce sound anyways ... and since you do not have alsa etc installed (since you hate bloat) ... I wonder what is the point
2011-03-25T22:37:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	like I said soundcore will only disable your "soundcard" sound ... not the beeper on the motherboard (which can still produce very ennoying sounds)
2011-03-25T22:39:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	k ... but please enlighten my why you want to disable sound on your server? (genuinely interested curious as I never gave it any thought)
2011-03-25T22:41:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	never had the need of a "few mb" of ram on a server for a long time ... and when I did, I ran my custom kernels (which frees up a lot more than just a few mb)
2011-03-25T22:41:00.000Z	d1rty	candyban	right, like i said though i'd rather a 5 minute optimization versus a new kernel :)
2011-03-25T22:42:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	anyways ... good to see some people are still motivated to get a few percent more out of their systems
2011-03-25T22:43:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	I gave up on that when I noticed it is cheaper to throw more hardware at it (clustering etc)
2011-03-25T22:43:00.000Z	d1rty	candyban	yeah, this particular guy is a latitude with the lcd ripped off of it and no battery, lol
2011-03-25T22:44:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	k ... frankenstein laptop as server ... :)
2011-03-25T22:45:00.000Z	candyban	d1rty	makes me think of the days when I ran bare motherboard (without case) as my main pc
2011-03-25T22:45:00.000Z	d1rty	candyban	i have a few of them strewn about, theyre just nagios + cacti
