2005-11-30T15:14:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	whats wrong?
2005-11-30T15:15:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	I cant get xine-ui, gxine, totem-xine, or totem-gstreamer to play a dvd
2005-11-30T15:15:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	they all bitch about NAV packet error junk
2005-11-30T15:15:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	but mplayer and vlc can play the DVDs
2005-11-30T15:17:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	any ideas?
2005-11-30T15:18:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	searching...
2005-11-30T15:19:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	i assume you have libdvdcss2 installed
2005-11-30T15:19:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	yup
2005-11-30T15:19:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	vlc and mplayer work
2005-11-30T15:20:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	thats odd because i've found that there are 2 things that cause it, not having libdvdcss2 installed or having a dirty/damaged disc
2005-11-30T15:21:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	strace seems to show gxine etc loading the stupid dvdcss stuff too
2005-11-30T15:22:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	strange, if i find anything i'll let you know

2005-11-30T15:23:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	Try to open the totem.conf file in your /home/.gnome/ directory, there will be a line quoted, referring to libdvdcss2, unquote this line
2005-11-30T15:32:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	well, totem is saying I am trying to play an encrypted dvd without libdvdcss installed
2005-11-30T15:33:00.000Z	dragonbyte	thechitowncubs	but i uncommented those lines  and its still doing it
2005-11-30T15:33:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	dragonbyte	alright, sry thats all i got
