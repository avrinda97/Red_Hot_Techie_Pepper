2008-04-28T22:03:00.000Z	fearl	Ward1983	also, what is the output from make exactly? please direct that at me explicitly so I can see it.
2008-04-28T22:03:00.000Z	Ward1983	fearl	there g15daemon XMMS plugin
2008-04-28T22:03:00.000Z	fearl	Ward1983	also, if you don't have build-essential ... I reserve the right to hit you  :P
2008-04-28T22:04:00.000Z	Ward1983	fearl	lol offcourse i have build-essential, and g15daemon works fine :)
2008-04-28T22:05:00.000Z	Ward1983	fearl	since ./configure failed there are no makefiles
2008-04-28T22:05:00.000Z	Ward1983	fearl	its q syntqx error though so normqlly the problem should be within the configure file itself
2008-04-28T22:05:00.000Z	Ward1983	fearl	sorry i recently changed keyboard layout
2008-04-28T22:05:00.000Z	fearl	Ward1983	#autotools probably
