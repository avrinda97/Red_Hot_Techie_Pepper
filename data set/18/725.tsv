2011-10-12T10:57:00.000Z	Alxjrvs		Hey guys
2011-10-12T10:57:00.000Z	Alxjrvs		I feel I just somehow screwed myself
2011-10-12T10:57:00.000Z	Alxjrvs		I am setting up ubuntu for the first time, and now when I
2011-10-12T10:57:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	Please elaborate
2011-10-12T10:58:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	Did you create a user without making a home directory for that use
2011-10-12T11:00:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	do "ls -A"
2011-10-12T11:00:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	If you really think there should be anything in your home directory, that should show it to you
2011-10-12T11:01:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	;p;
2011-10-12T11:01:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	It's okay, man. It happens to the best of us.
2011-10-12T11:01:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	You should've seen me a few weeks ago
2011-10-12T11:02:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	I've been using linux for more than a decade. I installed the newest Fedora on my laptop and I was like "uh oh god what is this." and had no idea what to do with gnome 3.
2011-10-12T11:04:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	Yeah it makes me feel weird and I hate it. I'm gonna have to get used to it though.
2011-10-12T11:06:00.000Z	Alxjrvs	ohzie	I'm in my mid twenties, been using linux for... gosh, 10 years now. I've always been a design person, and I have to say that this interface is ~20 pounds sexier than anything i've seen on linux.
2011-10-12T11:07:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	Well it's a good thing some people like it. :-)
2011-10-12T11:08:00.000Z	Alxjrvs	ohzie	Also, something I discovered that I love: Now, my workstations are relegated to one monitor. So I can keep my dual monitor consistent with a single activity and move around on the other monitor. Fantastic for programming with multiple resources to look at.
2011-10-12T11:09:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	Yeah, I use multiple computers at work...but I use a windows laptop and a mac at work. ( ,_,)
2011-10-12T11:11:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	I was only allowed to use windows until recently. Linux was just a server thing and a my-laptop thing...but we're switching to corporate gmail for everything, so it doesn't matter what I use. So I have a mac on my desk. It's...really pretty. :3
2011-10-12T11:11:00.000Z	ohzie	Alxjrvs	irssi really sucks on a mac's terminal though. The default mac terminal is actually a lot less capable than I'm use to gnome-terminal being. Significantly. :| I downloaded terminator for mac, but I haven't had much chance to play with it yet.
