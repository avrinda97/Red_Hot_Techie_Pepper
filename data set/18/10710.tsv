2007-12-26T01:20:00.000Z	sparr		how can i pin packages to a certain release regardless of version number?  i don't want to get higher versions from less desirable releases
2007-12-26T01:22:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto has some stuff, with an example of version pinning
2007-12-26T01:23:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	i dont want to pin specific versions, i want to pin the release, and not get ANY version from another release
2007-12-26T01:27:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	you would pin by origin, if the repo provides it. http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/howto/debian.html#errata has a reasonable discussion
2007-12-26T01:29:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	theres no way to override version with a release pin?  :(
2007-12-26T01:29:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	doh, I reread your question, see that first wiki page I gave you, and "how to keep a mixed system" , that's how you specify a release
2007-12-26T01:30:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	i have specified a release, but somehow im getting new versions from the wrong one
2007-12-26T01:30:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	APT::Default-Release
2007-12-26T01:30:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	you did that ?
2007-12-26T01:31:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	and apt-cache policy should give you some clues about where your version is coming from
2007-12-26T01:31:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	yes
2007-12-26T01:32:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	what origin does the wine repo say it is?
2007-12-26T01:33:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	not sure, how can i check?
2007-12-26T01:35:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	what exactly should my APT::Default-Release be?  ive tried "o=Ubuntu", "gutsy", "7.10" to no avail
2007-12-26T01:38:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	if ubuntu is using the same as debian did, it would be the origin iirc
2007-12-26T01:38:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	but my memory is hazy on this, to tell the truth
2007-12-26T01:39:00.000Z	sparr	nickrud	thanks for trying.  no offense, but this is why i usually ask my obscure apt questions in #debian, unfortunately they don't support their own software any more  :(
2007-12-26T01:39:00.000Z	nickrud	sparr	sad but true. Gotta know what you want to know before you can ask about it anymore
