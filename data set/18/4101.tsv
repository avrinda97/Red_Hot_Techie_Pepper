2012-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	Adie		can wubi resize my disk?
2012-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	Adie		my wubi install is full :(
2012-08-25T05:22:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	Adie	maybe time to install it for real then? You will get much better disk performance as well ;)
2012-08-25T05:23:00.000Z	Adie	zykotick9	WELL, THATS NOT WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING
2012-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	Adie		though... is a wubi install something I can open in vmware/virtualbox?
2012-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	Adie		or it it a weird virtual disk
2012-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	Adie		I needed to install ubuntu so I could edit and compile programs for windows, BUT I FULLED UP MAH WUBI
2012-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	Adie		I don't even know how :|
2012-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	Adie		isn't 18gb the default?
2012-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	Adie		or was it 2...
2012-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	Adie		also! how much would wubi DESTROY I/O performance?
2012-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	Adie		if any
2012-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	Adie		I have a good computer, but ubuntu is not liking all I am doing with it
2012-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	Adie		QT Creator + chrome + a windows 7 virtual machine, and the thing just locks up a lot
2012-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	Adie		idk if making a REAL ubuntu installation would fix that
2012-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	Adie	you will get better disk performance by either installing it properly to disk or using a virtual environment like VirtualBox
2012-08-25T05:28:00.000Z	Adie		yeah, looks like the root disk is 19gb
2012-08-25T05:28:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	Adie	WUBI is a test environment to make it easy for people to test out Ubuntu, its not meant for long term use
