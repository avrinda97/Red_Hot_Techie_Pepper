2005-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	Did you file a wishlist bug on that/ ;-)
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	license
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	LasseL	cafuego_	what about it?
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	Sun doesn't allow distribution of modified packages.
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	ATI do.
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	LasseL	cafuego_	in which way is the java package modified?
2005-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	It's repackaged; different file locations. That's illegal under the license.
2005-10-17T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	Mind you, there is a packaged blackdown java (1.4) - that is a different license.
2005-10-17T05:43:00.000Z	LasseL	cafuego_	what is so bad about /opt anyways? couldn't you just package it without modifying it?
2005-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	No, because converting it from .bin ro .rpm.bin to .deb and then redistributing it is already against the license.
2005-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	www.sun.com -> Feedback for all your gripes.
2005-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	LasseL	cafuego_	did you ask?
2005-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	Better legal minds than mine can read licenses.
2005-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	I'm not going to waste my time on it.
2005-10-17T05:46:00.000Z	LasseL	cafuego_	perhaps if one just wrote them and asked for permission, or their interpretation of their license if you wish. They may not read it as strict as Stallman
2005-10-17T05:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	LasseL	Like I said, I'm not going to waste my time on it. Feel free to email them.
2005-10-17T05:48:00.000Z	LasseL	cafuego_	I think I will
