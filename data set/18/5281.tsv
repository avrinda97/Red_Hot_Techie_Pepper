2008-11-13T21:49:00.000Z	IcyPolecat		is it possible to have multiple bonded interfaces (eg bond0 = eth0 & eth2 bond1 = eth1 & eth3)?
2008-11-13T21:51:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	Also see bridging
2008-11-13T21:52:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	don't want to bridge - want to bond / team. Have one bond interface up - now am trying to get the second online and am having problems
2008-11-13T21:56:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	ok - will try it manually although already have bond0 setup and working - now need bond1 on different subnet
2008-11-13T21:56:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	yes
2008-11-13T22:02:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	should be there automatically. Or File Close instead of Quit. Or install the PPA version which should support it from the close toolbar button
2008-11-13T22:03:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	all I get from the first ifconfig command is bond1: ERROR while getting interface flasgs: no such device
2008-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	setup network interfaces or virtual interfaces so they match your IP/subnet settings first
2008-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	so I need to setup say eth2 to use the subnet I want?
2008-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	I would think so, yes
2008-11-13T22:08:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	pretty cool stuff, let me know when you have bonded :)
2008-11-13T22:09:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	no luck yet. Weird as bond0 was realy easy to setup bond1 is being a total pita
2008-11-13T22:09:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	subnet issue maybe. make sure you take the bonds down before bonding up again
2008-11-13T22:10:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	possibly - will try that
2008-11-13T22:11:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	Copy and init script as bonding, then you can do "bonding up/down"
2008-11-13T22:24:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	ok giving up for today - will try again tomorrow
2008-11-13T22:24:00.000Z	SOF4LNX	IcyPolecat	alright, good luck
2008-11-13T22:25:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	SOF4LNX	thanks - will keep you posted
