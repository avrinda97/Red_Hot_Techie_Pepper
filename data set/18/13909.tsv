2007-01-30T12:39:00.000Z	zyth		that'd be quite the list

2007-01-30T07:52:00.000Z	zyth		My trash applet is broken.  It never shows trash in it, and right clicking on it has 'empty trash' greyed out, but if I open the folder I can see the stuff in it, and I can empty trash.  Anyone got any idea?
2007-01-30T07:54:00.000Z	soundray	zyth	make sure the permissions on $HOME/.Trash are correct
2007-01-30T07:54:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	 hm ok
2007-01-30T07:55:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	drwxr-xr-x 49 owner owner 4096 2007-01-30 07:51 ..
2007-01-30T07:56:00.000Z	soundray	zyth	I assume owner is your username?
2007-01-30T07:56:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	yea
2007-01-30T07:57:00.000Z	soundray	zyth	it shouldn't make much of a difference, but I have drwx------ on .Trash
2007-01-30T07:57:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	me too
2007-01-30T07:57:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	drwx------  2 owner owner 4096 2007-01-30 07:52 .
2007-01-30T08:00:00.000Z	soundray	zyth	'..' is the parent directory. To be sure to know what you're looking at, use 'ls -ld ~/.Trash' (it'll be drwx------, so it's okay)
2007-01-30T08:00:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	ahh ok
2007-01-30T08:58:00.000Z	soundray	zyth	he means a split zip file with a maximum file length of 500000 bytes
2007-01-30T08:58:00.000Z	zyth	soundray	ohh, what, is he sending it though gmail?
