2007-02-06T08:05:00.000Z	tapas		ok, who can i talk to about the details of the live cd?
2007-02-06T08:05:00.000Z	tapas		i hope it's ok to swear at the bot ;)
2007-02-06T08:06:00.000Z	tapas		oh the PC attack is coming at me :)
2007-02-06T08:07:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	 did you have a question to ask?
2007-02-06T08:07:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	yes and i will ask it again :)
2007-02-06T08:08:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	 no
2007-02-06T08:08:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	is there a simple way to install additional files on the root fs of the installed system?
2007-02-06T08:09:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	 well, not until after the install is finished
2007-02-06T08:12:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	or just have a post-install script on a webpage that the client can use later? :)
2007-02-06T08:12:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	not such a bad idea either.. i kinda shy away from creating .deb packages
2007-02-06T08:13:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	 .deb's are the easiest of packages to create -- except the tarball derivatives
2007-02-06T08:19:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	i don;t even know what you mean by "tarball derivatives"
2007-02-06T08:20:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	 tarball's are tar.gz, .tar.bz2, tar.Z, tar.zip, .tgz, etc
2007-02-06T08:21:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	i kknow that :)
2007-02-06T08:21:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	just not what you know by "derivatives"
2007-02-06T08:22:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	and yes i know the literal meaning of that word, too, thanks :)
2007-02-06T08:22:00.000Z	un0p	tapas	 well, like slackware uses .tgz package, bsd uses .tbz , etc -- they are tarballs but quite different, hence derived :)
2007-02-06T08:22:00.000Z	tapas	un0p	ah, now i get your drift..
