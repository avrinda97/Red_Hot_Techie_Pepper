2010-04-15T09:40:00.000Z	Roasted		Permissions Question - For a user to be able to read-only, when it comes to directories, that user must ALSO have execute permissions on that folder to actually open it and read what's inside - correct?
2010-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	Yes.
2010-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	is this true for any OS, such as windows, etc?
2010-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	That I am not sure. But under Ubuntu and RHEL it is.
2010-04-15T09:43:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	thanks. I'll ask in windows to see. Pretty sure it is but I'm kinda curious. :P
2010-04-15T09:44:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	Alright, interesting trivia haha
2010-05-10T07:55:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	sudo restart samba
2010-05-10T07:55:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	restart: Unknown job: samba
2010-05-10T07:56:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	any idea?
2010-05-10T07:56:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	Type `service` in a terminal then do a quick double tap of the TAB key, it will list all services, is Samba there?
2010-05-10T07:57:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	I ran service --status-all, and I did not see "samba" in the list. I saw "smbd" but thats the closest thing I found.
2010-05-10T07:57:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	samba is installed tho. apt-get install samba = 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove.
2010-05-10T07:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	That is probably it then.
2010-05-10T07:59:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	not sure. I kind of doubt it tho the way its acting.
2010-05-10T07:59:00.000Z	Roasted	crucialhoax	just sorta frustrating, since I rely on samba heavily and just upgraded to 10.04
2010-05-10T07:59:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	?
2010-05-10T08:01:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	I have samba installed as well and running `sudo restart smbd` I got a service restart, however using `samba` did not work.
2010-05-10T08:03:00.000Z	crucialhoax	Roasted	smbd start/running, process 2850 That is my output, you do not see any of that?
