2006-12-30T07:50:00.000Z	tenco		i have a problem with suspend to ram and gnome. it works with kde, but with gnome the laptop doesnt even suspend
2006-12-30T07:51:00.000Z	tenco		no suggestions?
2006-12-30T07:51:00.000Z	tenco		which script does kde call to suspend?
2006-12-30T07:53:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	what's to say it's a script -- it might as well be ACPId, if not, something like klaptop
2006-12-30T07:54:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	it uses ubuntus acpi framework, because changes to /etc/default/acpi-support have effect on kde's suspend app
2006-12-30T07:54:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	so it should sth independent of gnome/kde
2006-12-30T07:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	maybe this'll start something off -- http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-power-manager/
2006-12-30T08:14:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	IIRC, the sysfs is a read-only fs
2006-12-30T08:15:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	 /sys on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
2006-12-30T08:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	i did mention sysfs -- not /sys -- the sysfs filesystem is a virtual file system to depict information about hardware and drivers and so on, I dont see why you'd need to write to iy
2006-12-30T08:17:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	to suspend to ram, of course. just look at /etc/acpi/sleep.sh , line 39
2006-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	sorry, i dont understand. sysfs is mounted to /sys here
2006-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	unfortunately i dont use gnome or kde or use any power management tools, i don't have that script here
2006-12-30T08:19:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	I think about it like this -- if sysfs exports info about your hardware, it'd be dangerous to make it writable to
2006-12-30T08:19:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	it reads: "echo -n $ACPI_SLEEP_MODE >/sys/power/state" where $ACPI_SLEEP_MODE is one of "mem" for suspend to ram and "disk" for suspend to disk
2006-12-30T08:20:00.000Z	tenco	un_operateur	http://acpi.sourceforge.net/documentation/sleep.html
2006-12-30T08:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	tenco	well, the fact that you can't modify anything under /sys indicates it works differently to other types of file systems -- http://delcom.sourceforge.net/sysfs.txt
