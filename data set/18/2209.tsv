2010-07-20T00:14:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	you have 2 separate problems I think, your nforce chipset and your geforce
2010-07-20T00:15:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	yeah, why not?
2010-07-20T00:15:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	well why can't you install nvidia graphics drivers?
2010-07-20T00:16:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	are you sure you even need to install restricted drivers for nforce? Your audio doesn't work already?
2010-07-20T00:16:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	will it help with my internet?
2010-07-20T00:17:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	when I download and install nvidia drivers, it will install graphics and also ethernet driver for kernel??
2010-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	no
2010-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	click system-> administration -> hardware drivers
2010-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	that is for graphics only
2010-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	the forcedeth thing is a completely different issue, those drivers are open source
2010-07-20T00:19:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	I am doing something like that: when I boot up ubuntu 10.04, then I type in console: sudo ifconfig eth0 inet 192.168.0.100 (my address), and also: route add default gw 192.168.0.1
2010-07-20T00:19:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	^
2010-07-20T00:19:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	are you not using networkmanager for a reason? I thought this was a desktop machine
2010-07-20T00:20:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	yeah, that's desktop machime
2010-07-20T00:20:00.000Z	nforced	peepingtom	I'm just a slacker more than ubunter...
2010-07-20T00:21:00.000Z	peepingtom	nforced	why are you using ifconfig to configure the network then? You should use network manage, you can use your mouse instead of typing a bunch of stuff
