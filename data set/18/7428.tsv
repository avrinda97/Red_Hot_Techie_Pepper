2008-01-29T17:11:00.000Z	kaboombob	travisat	i did that but now the folder is empty
2008-01-29T17:10:00.000Z	travisat	kaboombob	just umount what you mounted
2008-01-29T17:11:00.000Z	travisat	kaboombob	have you tried rebooting?
2008-01-29T17:12:00.000Z	travisat	kaboombob	rebooting won't make you lose anything you already lost, I think you just have a file-system mishap
2008-01-29T17:12:00.000Z	kaboombob	travisat	will i still be able to log in?
2008-01-29T17:13:00.000Z	travisat	kaboombob	yes

2008-01-29T17:25:00.000Z	travisat	kaboombob	adn don't just logout reboot
2008-01-29T17:25:00.000Z	kaboombob	travisat	i did reboot
2008-01-29T17:26:00.000Z	kaboombob	travisat	can you tell me what the mount command i was given earlier was? cause it worked i just mounted in the wrong place
2008-01-29T17:28:00.000Z	kaboombob	travisat	it should have the text "/dev/???" in it
