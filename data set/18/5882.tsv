2008-09-06T10:46:00.000Z	threefcata		hi i'm trying to run this script but javac keeps spitting out error.http://paste.ubuntu.org.cn/9215
2008-09-06T10:47:00.000Z	threefcata		it seems the space is not correctly escaped..
2008-09-06T10:48:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	LABHOME='/home/threefcata/schooldocs/Search\ Engine/lab'  <<< you shouldn't need to escape the space here (when using single quotes)
2008-09-06T10:48:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	why don't you simplify the problem and just not use a directory name with a space?
2008-09-06T10:49:00.000Z	threefcata	joejoecircusboy	i did that but i wanna know how to make it to work with space..
2008-09-06T10:50:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	try removing the \
2008-09-06T10:50:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	failing that, I don't know
2008-09-06T10:51:00.000Z	threefcata	joejoecircusboy	and that failed.. thx though
2008-09-06T10:53:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	one more idea - try wrapping each full searchpath substitution in quotes
2008-09-06T10:53:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	e.g. use '$LABHOME/lib/lucene-core-2.1.0.jar', instead of '$LABHOME'/lib/lucene-core-2.1.0.jar
2008-09-06T10:58:00.000Z	threefcata	joejoecircusboy	still not working... this time $LABHOME is printed..
2008-09-06T10:59:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	ah, replace the single quote with a double quote (")
2008-09-06T10:59:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	variable substitution doesn't occur with a single quote in bash scripts (forgot about that)
2008-09-06T11:02:00.000Z	threefcata	joejoecircusboy	no luck..
2008-09-06T11:03:00.000Z	threefcata	joejoecircusboy	no luck..
2008-09-06T11:04:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	I think your embedded variables are the source of the problem. If you really want to get this working, I would try doing it with a single variable first (CLASSPATH), then fix the substitution
2008-09-06T11:04:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	threefcata	personally, i would just drop the space from the dir name ;)
2008-09-06T11:07:00.000Z	threefcata	joejoecircusboy	ok i will look into that..
