2008-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	I enerted a chroot on my system that failed, lets assume I got that far on my own powers and abilities
2008-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	/dev/hda3              73G   50G   20G  72% /mnt/hda3
2008-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	this is not a chroot issue
2008-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	grus is throwing error 15, file not found
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	grub is pointing at a file that no longer exist
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	with all that overwhelming evidence, I think its BLATANTLY obvious the problem is not chroot
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	I just showed you proof its not the chroot
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	jchroosted	amenado	step back because you cannot help
