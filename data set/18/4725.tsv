2009-08-18T07:15:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		need some advice, just got a thinkpad and I need to decide between jaunty or karmic
2009-08-18T07:16:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		also is there any difference between the minimal cd and installing server w/o any extra software?
2009-08-18T07:17:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		I just want ubuntu w/o a gui
2009-08-18T07:18:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		I don't want a gui Flannel
2009-08-18T07:18:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		I have the server install and want to know if it will do the same thing
2009-08-18T07:18:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		okay
2009-08-18T07:20:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		if I install the server without selecting any extra software will it be the same as the minimal w/o selecting additional software?
2009-08-18T07:21:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		is having the server kernal going to alter my user experience though?
2009-08-18T07:22:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	are you installing on a PPC?
2009-08-18T07:23:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	there are lots of install options from alternate CD, just press tab key and run through them
2009-08-18T07:25:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	when you get to yaboot prompt just press tab and review all your options - you don't need to install server stuff and then uninstall
2009-08-18T07:26:00.000Z	MrMacPlus	mdg	you assume I'm using a mac. ;)
2009-08-18T07:26:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	even on an intel, press tab and you will see lots of options - just keep pressing tab
2009-08-18T07:26:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	yes, I assumed Mac - sorry
2009-08-18T07:27:00.000Z	MrMacPlus	mdg	I do own more macs than can be healthy but I'm just going to be using linux on my thinkpad I just got
2009-08-18T07:27:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	my first laptop was a thinkpad - a whopping 166 Mhz :)
2009-08-18T07:28:00.000Z	MrMacPlus	mdg	thinkpad a20m, 800mhz
2009-08-18T07:28:00.000Z	mdg	MrMacPlus	that should work nicely
