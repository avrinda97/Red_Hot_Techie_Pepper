2007-03-15T16:29:00.000Z	sethk	syntaxshadow	there is a web site for generating ppd files for printers
2007-03-15T16:29:00.000Z	sethk	syntaxshadow	someone will know the URL
2007-03-15T16:30:00.000Z	syntaxshadow		and you don't know the website off hand sethk?
2007-03-15T16:30:00.000Z	sethk	syntaxshadow	something-o-matic.  google for CUPS and look for the word 'matic' and you'll find it
2007-03-15T16:30:00.000Z	syntaxshadow		see i did cups already
2007-03-15T16:30:00.000Z	syntaxshadow		it didn't work
2007-03-15T16:30:00.000Z	sethk	syntaxshadow	you generated a ppd file?
2007-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	syntaxshadow	sethk	i thought if i had a .ppd file then it would make cups work
2007-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	sethk	syntaxshadow	that's probably correct.  that's why I suggested the web site.
2007-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	syntaxshadow		i used cups to add a printer but after adding it i tried to print a test page it went to the job tray then left without printing
2007-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	sethk	syntaxshadow	place to start is:   http://openprinting.org/driver_list.cgi
