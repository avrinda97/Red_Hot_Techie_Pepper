2009-08-30T13:41:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	wazzag	i don't know any other program on ubuntu 9.04 since brasero is the defualt app
2009-08-30T13:44:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	wazzag	im using ubuntu 9.04 jaunty i don't know if in not mistaken its gnome i don't know whats the best alternative besides brasero
2009-08-30T13:46:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	I don't know either, brasero works for me on 9.04, just try one, I think the first one is KDE, the rest are gnome except for the last one
2009-08-30T13:46:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	hehehe lol, good luck

2009-08-30T13:51:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	wazzag	is there anything i can do when it says no space on a blank rw disc after i erased it? or do you not know??
2009-08-30T13:51:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	no idea I'm sorry
2009-08-30T13:53:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	I was in this channel a couple of days ago and someone was asking about a similar problem, I am pretty sure the fix was to use another burning prog, which one I cannot remember
2009-08-30T14:01:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	serpentine and xcdroast are in synaptic
2009-08-30T14:01:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	wazzag	ok i'll look into it i just like soemthing for now or even that won't give me problems

2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	wazzag	ok but that just means someone has the same issue as me
2009-08-30T14:32:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	Yeah I know, but there are other ways.....
2009-08-30T14:32:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	wazzag	well since no one here has helped me and that link you posted me didn't give a sollution
2009-08-30T14:33:00.000Z	wazzag	GhostWolfy	musta narrowed it down a bit though!
