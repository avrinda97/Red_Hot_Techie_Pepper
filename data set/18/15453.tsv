2005-07-22T10:01:00.000Z	DAC1138		anyone here using an external usb hard drive?
2005-07-22T10:01:00.000Z	kutucape	DAC1138	yes I do, i used to use it
2005-07-22T10:02:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	did you have any problems with it?
2005-07-22T10:02:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	mine works upon bootup, then after a while it stops working and i can remount it
2005-07-22T10:02:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	it sometimes works in windows too. sounds like a flaky drive, but it works perfectly over on a mandrake 10 box
2005-07-22T10:02:00.000Z	kutucape	DAC1138	nope, it works smooth on my hoary
2005-07-22T10:04:00.000Z	kutucape	DAC1138	i think you have remount it with -oremount -t ext3? CMIIW
2005-07-22T10:05:00.000Z	kutucape	DAC1138	you can try with livecd first
2005-07-22T10:05:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	okay, but ubuntu is already installed, im running it now, cant i just scan it here?
2005-07-22T10:06:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	i want to scan the usb drive, not this hard drive
2005-07-22T10:07:00.000Z	kutucape	DAC1138	oh, you can do this..
2005-07-22T10:07:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	its fat32 currently
2005-07-22T10:08:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	windows wouldnt work
2005-07-22T10:08:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	windows wont detect the drive sometimes, and when it does, it says "scandisk could not complete the scan"
2005-07-22T10:09:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	but it works perfectly in mandrake 10
2005-07-22T10:09:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	its mounted right now
2005-07-22T10:13:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	so anyway, its running on mandrake.ive been trying to set that up as a way to access my drive through the network
2005-07-22T10:13:00.000Z	DAC1138	kutucape	but ubuntu wont access any windows computers on the network or the mandrake box. its visible, but not browsable
