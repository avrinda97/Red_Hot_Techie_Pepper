2006-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		i'm such a noob - should have written it down
2006-11-28T10:57:00.000Z	Nerd42		If ubuntu comes up like it's supposed to - is there an easy way to get it to check itself and download any files it might be missing ??
2006-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	Nerd42		or else it has the wrong goal
2006-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	Nerd42		The goal ought to be to make a "Free Software" OS that does everything that Windows does and is just as easy to understand and use as Windows is.
2006-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	Nerd42		oh crap
2006-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	Nerd42		it says "Warning: failure while configuring base packages. This will be attempted 5 times"
2006-11-28T11:02:00.000Z	Nerd42		yeah windows has bugs
2006-11-28T11:02:00.000Z	Nerd42		windows *is* a bug
2006-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	Nerd42		ubutntu apparently sees my computer as "unclean"
2006-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	Nerd42		whoah dude, this is getting Biblical
2006-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	you sure you did not install ichtux?
2006-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	it is a version of Ubuntu tailored to christian users
2006-11-28T11:07:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	OK OK.
2006-11-28T11:12:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux
2006-11-28T11:26:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	it would involve setting up your sources to include multiverse and installing a package.
2006-11-28T11:30:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	nothing will be easy to set up til you learn to install packages...
2006-11-28T11:33:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	that is an oversimplification
2006-11-28T11:35:00.000Z	dabaR	Nerd42	we are going that way. Linux for human beings is what you could translate to linux for stupid people if you want to oversiplify
