2007-02-12T12:57:00.000Z	dynamicreflux		how does one remove a desktop entry if the Main Menu Editor fails and crashes when attempted?
2007-02-12T12:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	The menu entries are kept in either ~/.local/share/applications or /usr/share/applications
2007-02-15T12:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	I can only suggest chaning the video driver within mplayer and see if that helps.
2007-02-15T12:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	Open mplayer, right-click the main window, choose Preferences, go to the Video tab and choose a different video driver. This has sometimes helped me fix things.
2007-02-15T12:25:00.000Z	dynamicreflux	ardchoille	im not seeing anything in reference to a video driver
2007-02-15T12:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	Are you in the video tab?
2007-02-15T12:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	YEs, the one installed from the Ubuntu repos
2007-02-15T12:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	You need to go to the "Video" tab
2007-02-15T12:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	Did you right-click and choose properties?
2007-02-15T12:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	You should right click on the mplayer main window
2007-02-15T12:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	Well, that isn't mplayer, now is it?
2007-02-15T12:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	I was answering your question pertaining to fixing mplayer, why am I an idiot for doing that?
2007-02-15T12:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	IMHO, tote is the worst media player on the planet. MPlayer, however, ROCKS!
2007-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	dynamicreflux	ardchoille	what is the best option for watching embedded .mpg's in firefox
2007-02-15T12:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	No idea, I don't allow videos in web browsers.
2007-02-16T13:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	I see them sometimes dependent on the title in the app's titlebar.
2007-02-16T13:07:00.000Z	dynamicreflux	ardchoille	it used to be where if i had just one application, it would span across the whole bar...now its COMPLETELY random
2007-02-16T13:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	dynamicreflux	, cables You can right click on that applet and change the size, BTW
