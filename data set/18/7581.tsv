2008-02-21T08:25:00.000Z	rilo		so what's the deal with Ubuntu and Azureus
2008-02-21T08:26:00.000Z	rilo		apt-get only pulls 2.5.0.0
2008-02-21T08:27:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	azureus now contains a non free component, so it's possible that they won't be packaging newer versions, but don't quote me on that
2008-02-21T08:27:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	yea, I figured that was the problem. I run the classic interface anyway, but yea.
2008-02-21T08:51:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	right click on a torrent file and click on properties. go to open with to change associations
2008-02-21T08:52:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	I did, it didn't work. If I reopen the .torrent file, it's still selected as Azureus. That's what I said I did
2008-02-21T08:52:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	uninstall that gnome-bt download garbage
2008-02-21T08:53:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	I tried, it wanted me to uninstall ubuntu-desktop if I uninstalled it
2008-02-21T08:53:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	ubuntu-desktop is not a required package. it is a meta package and is safe to delete
2008-02-21T08:53:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	what's included in it?
2008-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	nothing. it's a pointer package. it points to other packages but doesn't really do anything on its own. uninstalling it will have no affect
2008-02-21T08:55:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	but I still want to set Azureus as the default. ok about the ubuntu-desktop
2008-02-21T08:55:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	if it's the only package that can open up torrents, that would make it the default, wouldn't it?
2008-02-21T08:56:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	and if you are wondering how to do it directly from firefox, just go to preferences/applications in firefox and change the default for torrents
2008-02-21T08:58:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	that's what I was thinking when I tried it before, but that's obviously not the right way to do it. I use Opera and have that menu open... just trying to change what comes up in the default field
2008-02-21T08:59:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	i have never had a problem changeing file association by right clicking on a file, properties, and changing the default in open with. i use transmission, even with other torrent apps installed, and don't havea problem with file associations
2008-02-21T08:59:00.000Z	rilo	jeffMASTERflex	yea, I don't know why it's not working. That's the first thing I did.
2008-02-21T09:00:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rilo	the easiest way, of course, is to get rid of the bt-download program and it's associated packages
