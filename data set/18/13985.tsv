2007-04-11T07:39:00.000Z	VSpike		I want to store all my mail in a local imap server, and have it fetched from my ISP's pop3 servers and preferably spam filtered as well... I'm a bit overwhelmed by the choice of software available.  Can someone recommend a combination for me?
2007-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	VSpike		I set up qmail in the past (long time ago though) with fetchmail. I see quite a few simple imap servers operate with maildir, which I think means I have to use qmail or one of the mailservers which uses maildir.  Is that right?
2007-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	I use courier-imap and Postfix for delivery in maildirs
2007-04-11T07:42:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	that sounds like a sendible combination
2007-04-11T07:43:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	Qmail is a patch nightmare and I wouldn't recommand it except for specific unknown needs)
2007-04-11T07:43:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	do you need to use fetchmail as well?
2007-04-11T07:43:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	or do you get your mail sent in by smtp?
2007-04-11T07:43:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	not quite, I have a regular MX with domains
2007-04-11T07:44:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	the last time I looked about fetchmail there are several ways to interface it with Postifix, Either by SMTP forwarder or directly feeding the delivery agent
2007-04-11T07:44:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	Ah ok.  Makes sense.  My ISP can support that even without a domain, but I'm not convinced enough about my broadband + machine availability!  Fetchmail should work fine though, right?
2007-04-11T07:47:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	I ran my own MX behind a DSL line with static IP during 2 yers until 6months ago I could rent a dedicated server for 24Euro/month (30USD)
2007-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	This is a bit more detail stuff, and maybe i need to figure this out later, but I use two accounts, a work one and a personal one.  Currently I fetch both and use rules in my mail program to route them to different folders.  Can I do that routing in the maildir automatically with postfix?
2007-04-11T07:50:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	the default Postfix provided delivery agent does not support user customized delivery. You can use procmail or maildrop for that
2007-04-11T07:52:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	thanks.  I'll look into procmail
2007-04-11T07:53:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	ldap look the most versatile way. It is the toughest as well though
2007-04-11T07:53:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	what are the alternatives?
2007-04-11T07:55:00.000Z	leagris	VSpike	If you can enjoy webmails, contacts go well in plain text or SQL databases. If you want MUA addressbook connectivity, it's Ldap
2007-04-11T07:58:00.000Z	VSpike	leagris	thanks for the advice!  Much appreciated
