2009-06-29T18:48:00.000Z	usr13_		Is there some way I can capture the file from mms://win.playstream.com/stanthony/windowsmedia/SOD/1429.wma ?
2009-06-29T18:48:00.000Z	usr13_		usr13: Maybe some browser plugin?
2009-06-29T18:49:00.000Z	usr13_		There are two of these files I'd like to save.
2009-06-29T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 theres a 'streamripper' tool i recall.
2009-06-29T18:49:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	Tnx
2009-07-16T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 only the first initial user has 'sudo' rights.
2009-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	As far as I know, this one is.  At any rate, I just checked and the user is in admin group
2009-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	What other issue should I look for?
2009-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 somthing is goofy then.
2009-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 not sure. ive never had the problem except when using  a different user.
2009-07-16T09:30:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	Yes, it is.  I set this up for a young man some time ago and he's somehow mucked it up.  Do not know what he's done.
2009-07-16T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 could be the users groups, or the sudoers file i guess..
2009-07-16T09:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 heres my groups (well part of it) file --> grep willis /etc/group | pastebinit
2009-07-16T09:32:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	How about /etc/sudoers ?
2009-07-16T09:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	http://pastebin.com/f48093598
2009-07-16T09:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	usr13_	 i think those are untweaked by me.. :) i dont recall tweaking them
2009-07-16T09:40:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	There was no admin group.
2009-07-16T09:41:00.000Z	usr13_	Dr_Willis	see above
