2005-11-16T14:38:00.000Z	daHippo		Oh, sorry.
2005-11-16T14:39:00.000Z	daHippo		Opera, as in the Web Browser Opera (www.opera.com)
2005-11-16T14:40:00.000Z	daHippo		Ok
2005-11-16T14:40:00.000Z	daHippo		I've connected to a windows printer, through ubuntu, and can print from all my apps, but in opera, the printer doesnt show up
2005-11-16T14:42:00.000Z	daHippo		I don't have Konq, but it shows up in Firefox and prints fine from it
2005-11-16T14:42:00.000Z	daHippo		Opera is free (but not opensource)
2005-11-16T14:43:00.000Z	daHippo		I didn't install konqueror
2005-11-16T14:44:00.000Z	daHippo		synaptic
2005-11-16T14:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	I run Opera all the time, and just tried printing - it went fine... maybe have a look in Opera's printing options to make sure it sees your printer?
2005-11-16T14:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	what make/model of printer?
2005-11-16T14:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	HP should just work...
2005-11-16T14:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	you might want to ask on the Opera forums - there's a Linux forum there
2005-11-16T14:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	are you running the static deb Opera or the one supposedly for Breezy Badger?
2005-11-16T14:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	download the static deb version and install it - I cannot get the "Breezy Badger" version to actually run properly on Breezy - I've filed a couple of bugs w/ Opera about it
2005-11-16T14:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	daHippo	try the static Opera deb, it does work fine in Breezy... Hoary didn't have these problems... :(
2005-11-16T14:56:00.000Z	daHippo	Madpilot	 I am using the static Opera deb
