2005-07-23T05:09:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	axis	you dont save it you just copy it.  ie   cd  /etc/X11/  && cp  xorg.conf   xorg.conf-bak
2005-07-23T05:11:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	axis	because X manages not just your screen but the mouse
2005-07-23T05:12:00.000Z	axis	Linux_Galore	: whats the default /dev/mouse
2005-07-23T05:12:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	axis	the graphical display in Linux is actually portable in that you can send it from one machine to the other so what mouse you have is important
2005-07-23T05:12:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	axis	yep
2005-07-23T05:17:00.000Z	axis	Linux_Galore	: i'm lucky .. my buddy got me into bsd long ago, this computer is made for it [=
2005-07-23T05:18:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	axis	yeah Ive got a OBSD machine and getting my nvidia stuff working at a decent speed took me ages
2005-07-23T05:22:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	axis	no OSX is based on Darwin its a BSD kissing cousin to FreeBSD.....its totally different to Linux at the kernel level
