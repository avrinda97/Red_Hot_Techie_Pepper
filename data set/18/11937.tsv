2006-06-07T06:49:00.000Z	inrelief		does azureus act odd for anybody else?  odd meaning the health icon isn't displayed, disk read errors, and the inability to close the error dialogs?

2006-06-07T07:01:00.000Z	inrelief	d34db14ck	just remembered something...azureus does require java5+, so using blackdown, or any other free jre prolly won't cut it

2006-06-07T07:07:00.000Z	d34db14ck	inrelief	 installed java?
2006-06-07T07:07:00.000Z	inrelief	d34db14ck	downloaded sun's jre (1.5), and switched the default jre from the free one (forget what it was called) to sun's
