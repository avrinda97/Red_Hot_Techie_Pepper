2009-12-02T04:05:00.000Z	Lingus		anyone have any idea ?
2009-12-02T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	are you sure you don't want to use your ~/.mozilla/ ?
2009-12-02T04:06:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	had you made changes to it?
2009-12-02T04:06:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	so no point in replacing it
2009-12-02T04:07:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	that's saved in ~/.mozilla not /etc
2009-12-02T04:07:00.000Z	Lingus	jrib	hmm
2009-12-02T04:07:00.000Z	Lingus	jrib	so i was told to back up the wrong folder ?
2009-12-02T04:07:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	seems so.  Did you back up your ~ (/home/your_username) ?
2009-12-02T04:07:00.000Z	Lingus	jrib	yeah i backed that up
2009-12-02T04:08:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	great, then your bookmarks are in there.  Just copy over your old ~/.mozilla
2009-12-02T04:08:00.000Z	Lingus	jrib	1 sec please gonna check
2009-12-02T04:09:00.000Z	Lingus	jrib	my home folder io backed up doesnt have anything to with firefox inside...
2009-12-02T04:09:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	view -> show hidden file  should show you a ".mozilla" directory
2009-12-02T04:10:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	close firefox, delete/rename new .mozilla and replace it with your old one, restart firefox
2009-12-02T04:11:00.000Z	Lingus	jrib	no hidden firefox folder here :s
2009-12-02T04:11:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	it's not firefox, it's ".mozilla"
2009-12-02T04:11:00.000Z	jrib	Lingus	how did you backup your ~?
