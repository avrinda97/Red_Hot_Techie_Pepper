2005-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu		i use xmms normally but since i did my hoary install it just seems to not play and then crash when i do hit the play button. so i tried to build it from source and heres the error i got. checking how to run the C++ preprocessor... /lib/cpp
2005-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu		configure: error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check
2005-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu		See `config.log' for more details.
2005-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu		acidwolf@ubuntuG4:~/xmms-1.2.10$
2005-06-09T07:48:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu		sorry
2005-06-09T07:48:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	apt-get build-dep xmms && apt-get -b source xmms
2005-06-09T07:50:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu	crimsun_	i got an error from that aswell.  Build-dependencies for xmms could not be satisfied.
2005-06-09T07:50:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	make sure you have the necessary repos enabled
2005-06-09T07:51:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu	crimsun_	i do have all of them
2005-06-09T07:53:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	that's not possible, else you'd not get the /lib/cpp sanity error
2005-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	Yoshimitsu	crimsun_	could this be the reason for my xmms issue
2005-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	did you install ubuntu regularly?
2005-06-09T08:10:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	so why are you compiling xmms?
2005-06-09T08:12:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	"failed to work"?
2005-06-09T08:13:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	no, there was nothing wrong
2005-06-09T08:13:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	you were supposed to switch the output plugin to esound if you were using the default ubuntu settings
2005-06-09T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	did it work with the oss output if you pkilled esd?
2005-06-09T08:16:00.000Z	crimsun_	Yoshimitsu	alsa ppc support is lacking up through 1.0.8
