2008-12-09T19:15:00.000Z	Photoguy		How can I quickly change typed languages?
2008-12-09T19:16:00.000Z	Photoguy		Like type in English, switch to Hebrew, then switch back, all in 30 seconds?
2008-12-09T19:18:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	you can put a "keyboard layout switch" applet (not sure that's exactly what it's called) on your panel
2008-12-09T19:18:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	but didn't the standard Hebrew layout provide a means to type latin letters without switching?
2008-12-09T19:20:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	i don't remember exactly, it's not like i'm a user of Hebrew keyboards - but from memory, i recalled that if you just press Caps Lock, it'd switch to Latin
2008-12-09T19:20:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	could also always try asking in #ubuntu-il
2008-12-11T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	you're using an invalid address for the Medibuntu repository in /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-12-11T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	remove the Medibuntu entries from that file or, if you do want to have Medibuntu available, /msg ubottu medibuntu
2008-12-11T20:58:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	just remove the last line and add « deb http://packages.medibuntu.org/ intrepid free non-free » instead
2008-12-11T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	and what makes you think that the line that i gave you won't achieve that?
2008-12-11T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	err yes, it says "free non-free", so that means it will include free apps, and non-free apps
2008-12-11T21:03:00.000Z	Photoguy	LjL	umm, how can I make it to allow me to save it?
2008-12-11T21:03:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	you need to open it with "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list".
2008-12-11T21:03:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	nautilus isn't a text editor.
2008-12-13T22:18:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	getdeb is not recommended
2008-12-13T22:18:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	did he express the intention that he wanted to have the latest version?
2008-12-13T22:19:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	that's very close to saying "who wants ubuntu", as ubuntu rarely has the latest version of anything, but rather aims for stability.
2008-12-13T22:22:00.000Z	LjL	Photoguy	look, all i'm asking you is that when you think it's a good idea to suggest a package from unofficial places like getdeb, you make it clear it has the disadvantage of not being supported by ubuntu.
