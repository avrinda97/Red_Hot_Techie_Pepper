2009-02-27T23:53:00.000Z	Huufarted		Question about vino, the default VNC server in Ubuntu.  I have mine set to listen, but netstat -an does not show anything listening on 5900 and I can't connect to it.  I'm connecting locally on a LAN
2009-02-27T23:54:00.000Z	Huufarted		!tab | newfie_rich
2009-02-27T23:54:00.000Z	giovani	Huufarted	is the process running?
2009-02-27T23:54:00.000Z	Huufarted	giovani	is it 'vino'?
2009-02-27T23:55:00.000Z	giovani	Huufarted	I don't know ... look
2009-02-27T23:55:00.000Z	Huufarted	giovani	lol if I don't know the name, I don't know what to grep for in ps -ef.  nothing with vino shows up, however
2009-02-27T23:55:00.000Z	giovani	Huufarted	then who says the process has been started?
2009-02-27T23:56:00.000Z	Huufarted	giovani	I'm going off of the system-preferences-remote desktop
2009-02-27T23:56:00.000Z	giovani	Huufarted	you're asking us why it doesn't have a listening port open -- either you've misconfigured it, it's broken, or it's not running in the first place
2009-02-27T23:56:00.000Z	Huufarted		right, giovani.  I understand that.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  I don't know if it's handled through inetd or if it's a standalone
2009-02-27T23:56:00.000Z	giovani	Huufarted	yeah, unfortunately, neither do I -- but I'd figure out how to start it first :)
2009-02-27T23:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	giovani	if it's under inetd, you won't see vino and if it's standalone, I assume I would.  But since I don't know for sure how it's set up (but I'd assume standalone), I'm not entirely sure how to proceed
2009-02-27T23:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	giovani	yeah frustrating.  Thanks, bud.
2009-02-27T23:58:00.000Z	giovani	Huufarted	in the file list for vino I see /usr/lib/vino/vino-server
