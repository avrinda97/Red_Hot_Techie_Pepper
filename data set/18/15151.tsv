2005-04-29T15:47:00.000Z	zoppy		because I haven't configure anything in hdparm.conf
2005-04-29T15:47:00.000Z	zoppy		all is commented in hdparm.conf
2005-04-29T15:47:00.000Z	Jeeves_	zoppy	I think your disk is broken then.
2005-04-29T15:47:00.000Z	zoppy		when Starting Ubuntu ... in boot sequence I have to wait 2 minutes before the boot begins
2005-04-29T15:48:00.000Z	zoppy	Jeeves_	:  Win works fine
2005-04-29T15:48:00.000Z	Jeeves_	zoppy	Have you tried 'man hdparm' ? :)
2005-04-29T15:48:00.000Z	zoppy		yep
2005-04-29T15:48:00.000Z	Jeeves_		You've searched for dma?

2005-04-29T15:49:00.000Z	zoppy		DMA error is running when Starting Ubuntu ... is writing
2005-04-29T15:49:00.000Z	Jeeves_	zoppy	And you've found this part
2005-04-29T15:49:00.000Z	Jeeves_		" -d     Disable/enable the "using_dma" flag for this drive."
2005-04-29T15:50:00.000Z	zoppy		hdparm -d 0 didn't work :)
2005-04-29T15:51:00.000Z	Jeeves_	zoppy	You have some weird hardware than :)
