2006-12-23T12:49:00.000Z	n2diy		I have a laptop which currently has FC1 installed on it, and I'd like to install Ubuntu on to it. The system won't boot from the CD drive, and it has no floppy drive, ideas?
2006-12-23T12:51:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	if it has no usb ports, its rather old, right?
2006-12-23T12:51:00.000Z	n2diy	POVaddct	umm, yes.
2006-12-23T12:51:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	how much RAM does it have?
2006-12-23T12:52:00.000Z	n2diy	POVaddct	196  meg
2006-12-23T12:52:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	okay
2006-12-23T12:52:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	it does not boot from cd at all or just not from the ubuntu cd?
2006-12-23T12:53:00.000Z	n2diy	POVaddct	Bios doesn't support booting from CD.
2006-12-23T12:53:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	hmm. and no floppy either, thats bad. how was fc1 installed?
2006-12-23T12:54:00.000Z	n2diy	POVaddct	 I put a minimal dos system on it, and then ran Fedoras install script off the cd.
2006-12-23T12:55:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	and how did you install dos? what were you booting from?
2006-12-23T12:55:00.000Z	n2diy	POVaddct	 floppy disk, the CD and Floppy share the same bay, so it is one or the other.
2006-12-23T12:55:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	i see
2006-12-23T12:56:00.000Z	POVaddct	n2diy	there is a boot manager (sbm) that can be installed to hard disk allowing to boot from cd even if the bios does not support it
