2009-08-14T01:56:00.000Z	maco	xlq	yeah im just talking about whats automatic. the aptitude tui is a little too confusing for me to bother with
2009-08-14T01:56:00.000Z	xlq	maco	really? I find it pretty simple.
2009-08-14T01:57:00.000Z	xlq	maco	ahh well, if you don't use aptitude, you might find 'deborphan' useful - it tells you about orphaned packages
2009-08-14T01:57:00.000Z	maco	xlq	well i never really used it til i went to the "select packages to install" thing when installing from a pxe boot
2009-08-14T01:57:00.000Z	maco	xlq	yeah i know. tell  Xerran :P
2009-08-14T01:58:00.000Z	maco	xlq	Xerran though i believe apt-get prompts you about whats unneeded now, so deborphan is no longer needed. if apt-get prompts you, you can then say "apt-get autoremove" and itll do it
2009-08-14T01:59:00.000Z	maco	xlq	 think thats because it uses dpkg on them during install
2009-08-14T01:59:00.000Z	xlq	maco	indeed
2009-08-14T20:53:00.000Z	xlq	maco	really? Nice!
2009-08-14T23:08:00.000Z	xlq	maco	murlidhar: ntpd changes the time gradually to avoid problems
2009-08-14T23:08:00.000Z	maco	xlq	well yeah..if youre like hours off...
