2010-07-20T04:50:00.000Z	Oer	transom324	maybe a bugreport is in place, to help development fix this.
2010-07-20T05:02:00.000Z	Oer		mun that review is pointing to a windows bootdisk, ubuntu does not recognize .exe
2010-07-20T05:05:00.000Z	Oer		mun maybe bootdisk.com can help
2010-07-20T05:16:00.000Z	Oer	transom324	i do not see the update 2,0.6 so i guess they are working on it.
2010-07-20T05:17:00.000Z	transom324	Oer	I check the thread you sent.  i think i might wait for the fix.

2010-07-20T05:21:00.000Z	Oer	transom324	no, just remove it in synaptic, and re-install again.
