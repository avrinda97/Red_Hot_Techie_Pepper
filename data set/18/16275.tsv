2004-10-19T08:13:00.000Z	yyc747		he's looking for the next step from knoppix (which, surprisingly, he has had since yesterday)
2004-10-19T08:14:00.000Z	yyc747		and I'm trying to steer him away from slack, because I know nothing about it
2004-10-19T08:15:00.000Z	yyc747		bur[n] er: why do you think my favorite distros are debian (-based) and gentoo
2004-10-19T08:15:00.000Z	yyc747		bur[n] er: I need package management
2004-10-19T08:15:00.000Z	yyc747		bur[n] er: good package management
2004-10-19T08:16:00.000Z	yyc747		bur[n] er: or, at the very least, something that can easily remove packages I don't like
2004-10-19T08:16:00.000Z	yyc747		btw, are there many themes for gnome included?  the screens I've seen look ugly imo
2004-10-19T08:17:00.000Z	yyc747		bur[n] er: hmm... I've never really looked at how to do that
2004-10-19T08:17:00.000Z	yyc747		bur[n] er: because I'm starting to like KDE more and more
2004-10-19T08:18:00.000Z	yyc747		(in KDE the two are separate)
2004-10-19T08:20:00.000Z	goatboy	yyc747	in GNOME color schemes are a part of GTK+ themes.
2004-10-19T08:20:00.000Z	yyc747		I like the versioning scheme... it's shorter than the 2004XXXX type, and more precise than the gentoo 2004.X
2004-10-19T08:20:00.000Z	yyc747	goatboy	k.  I'll experiment with it
2004-10-19T08:20:00.000Z	yyc747	goatboy	is there a theme reminiscant of OS X?
2004-10-19T08:20:00.000Z	yyc747	goatboy	I don't mind that
2004-10-19T08:21:00.000Z	goatboy	yyc747	not included in gnome-themes-extras, I don't think.
2004-10-19T08:21:00.000Z	goatboy	yyc747	but there are plenty of them out there.
2004-10-19T08:21:00.000Z	yyc747	goatboy	whether or not I can apt-get themes doesn't really concern me
