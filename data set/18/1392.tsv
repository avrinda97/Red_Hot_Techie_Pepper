2011-03-04T19:07:00.000Z	jrz-		I want to install forked-daapd 0.12   I found a debian repo, but it was only versino 0.11.. I'm running 10.4.. Can I safely addhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/source/natty/forked-daapd ?
2011-03-04T19:08:00.000Z	jrz-		hm
2011-03-04T19:09:00.000Z	jrz-		I run on this box:  xbmc, smbd, afpd, daapd..   would 11.04 be stable enough at this point?
2011-03-04T19:09:00.000Z	jrz-		And will I be able to just apt-get dist-upgrade to 11.04 final?
2011-03-04T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrz-	what release are you on now?
2011-03-04T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!theme | ceo
2011-03-04T19:10:00.000Z	jrz-		I'm on lucid.
2011-03-04T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrz-	great!
2011-03-04T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrz-	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:codebutler/ppa; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install forked-daapd
2011-03-04T19:11:00.000Z	jrz-		It's not really production.. well, my files are important, but I'm running ext4, and I assume there are no datacorruption/loss issues with natty
2011-03-04T19:12:00.000Z	jrz-		As long as xbmc will run without TOO many problems, my gf is fine with it :-)
2011-03-04T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrz-	someone has a lucid ppa for the forked-daapd version you desire :)
