2008-10-18T07:42:00.000Z	lianimator		I mounted a partition into a folder in ~/ but it still shows in My Computer as a volume.
2008-10-18T07:43:00.000Z	lianimator		i don't want it to show
2008-10-18T07:45:00.000Z	lianimator		ubuntu could report wrong battery time
2008-10-18T07:45:00.000Z	lianimator		try using it past 0%
2008-10-18T07:46:00.000Z	lianimator		use it until it's depleted
2008-10-18T07:46:00.000Z	lianimator		then next time, it might show correctly
2008-10-18T07:48:00.000Z	lianimator		can someone tell me how to mount a partition so it wouldn't show as volume?
2008-10-18T07:48:00.000Z	lianimator		I edited etc/fstab to a folder
2008-10-18T07:48:00.000Z	lianimator		not in /media
2008-10-18T07:48:00.000Z	lianimator		ok
2008-10-18T07:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	lianimator	 Huh? You mount a filesystem to a directory. ie  /media/whatever
2008-10-18T07:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	lianimator	 you can mount them anywhere you want. Not just /media/Somthing
2008-10-18T07:51:00.000Z	lianimator	dr_willis	not /media/whatever. Cuz I don't want it to show in My Computer
2008-10-18T07:51:00.000Z	lianimator	dr_willis	I mounted in ~/whatever
2008-10-18T07:51:00.000Z	lianimator	dr_willis	then in My Computer, it's showing as /home/myname/whatever
2008-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	lianimator	 i think thats more of a gnome filemanager/config issue, then a mounting issue.   Its just seeing all mounts and showing them.
2008-12-04T01:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	lianimator	 there are guides on how to make a swap 'file' in linux. its not too hard to do..  google for 'swap howto linux' or similer.
2009-04-24T20:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	lianimator	 mouse slowy and carefully and find a spot btween the applets/buttons,, or remove a panel applet for a min or 3  till you get it moved.. then replace it.
