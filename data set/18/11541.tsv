2006-12-11T13:41:00.000Z	manopulus		hello, i never had any expierence with LVM. can i resize existing partition, create new and then install ubuntu to new partition with debootstrap ?
2006-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	manopulus		actually there is fedora 5 and LVM
2006-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	psusi	manopulus	you can do that without lvm as well
2006-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	how? (system is at colocation)
2006-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	psusi		without lvm you just have to boot from a livecd
2006-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	manopulus		no :)
2006-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	psusi	manopulus	then you probably want to use lvm ;)
2006-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	i need resize - and under existing and working
2006-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	psusi	manopulus	are the disks currently using LVM?
2006-12-11T13:44:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	yes
2006-12-11T13:44:00.000Z	psusi	manopulus	ok... then yea, lvm can do that
2006-12-11T13:45:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	lvm then pvscan five me /dev/hdg1, but no idea how to resize
2006-12-11T13:46:00.000Z	psusi	manopulus	vgchange is the main command to manipulate lvm... is there an existing logical volume you want to resize?  is this shrinking or growing?  does it already have a filesystem on it and you want to keep that filesystem intact?
2006-12-11T13:47:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	well, there is now fedora core5. i need ubuntu instead. it is colocation. i will not have access to it after reboot - so i haveto do all steps carefully :)
2006-12-11T13:47:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	first, need shrink existing partition, then create new, mount and install ubuntu
2006-12-11T13:48:00.000Z	psusi	manopulus	have you tried evms?
2006-12-11T13:49:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	yum install evms not help me :) no package with such name. really i not know well FC :)
2006-12-11T13:50:00.000Z	manopulus	psusi	i have pasted you lvm/pwscan and df-h, can you please look
