2012-03-31T21:28:00.000Z	Geodesical		Hi! I am trying to install GIMP Image Editor on my Ubuntu 11.10, but when  enter sudo apt-get install gimp, and enter my password, it runs a code line and ends with a message saying

2012-03-31T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	why are you using the PPA
2012-03-31T21:30:00.000Z	Geodesical	ikonia	I haven't the slightest clue what PPA is
2012-03-31T21:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	you've installed the gimp PPA to get the latest gimp version
2012-03-31T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	do you have any files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d ?
2012-03-31T21:36:00.000Z	Geodesical	ikonia	How would I check that?
2012-03-31T21:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	open that directory and see if there is anything there
2012-03-31T21:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	you don't know how to look at files and directories using ubuntu ?
2012-03-31T21:38:00.000Z	Geodesical	ikonia	I am new to Ubuntu, I am used to Windows' easier ways around.
2012-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	the file manager is the same as windows explorer
2012-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	before continuing I'd suggest having a read of https://help.ubuntu.com to get to understand the basics of how to do things like look in a directory
2012-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	Geodesical	ikonia	Oh, you could have just said to use the File Manager.:P
2012-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Geodesical	sort of stands to reason "look in a directory" "use the file manager"
