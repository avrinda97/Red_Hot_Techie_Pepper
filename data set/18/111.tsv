2012-09-09T22:51:00.000Z	ozette		how fix audio problems in flash
2012-09-09T22:51:00.000Z	pth	ozette	Can you be specific?
2012-09-09T22:53:00.000Z	ozette	pth	I'm experiencing sound problems in Chrome and Firefox when I'm at youtube or justintv
2012-09-09T22:53:00.000Z	ozette		Sound either plays real slow, or real quick
2012-09-09T22:53:00.000Z	ozette		like my speakers are in water
2012-09-09T22:54:00.000Z	pth	ozette	I have experienced out of sync sound on youtube but not the things you mention, sorry, cant help.
2012-09-09T22:54:00.000Z	ozette	pth	weird .. I can't even type in the search bar at youtube
2012-09-09T22:55:00.000Z	ozette	pth	are you using 12.04?
2012-09-09T22:55:00.000Z	pth	ozette	Yes
2012-09-09T22:55:00.000Z	ozette	pth	This problem is so annoying, Only way to resolve is to restart my system
2012-09-09T22:56:00.000Z	pth	ozette	Try chrome://plugins/ in chrome and tell me the version of the flash plugin.
2012-09-09T22:57:00.000Z	ozette		Flash (2 files) - Version: 11.3.31.232,  Shockwave Flash 11.3 r31
2012-09-09T22:57:00.000Z	ozette	pth	Version: 11.3.31.232,  Shockwave Flash 11.3 r31
2012-09-09T22:58:00.000Z	pth	ozette	Same here. Strange.
2012-09-09T22:58:00.000Z	ozette	pth	I guess it's the latest
2012-09-09T22:58:00.000Z	ozette	pth	Hmm ok, I was wondering if I was the only one experiencing this
2012-09-09T22:59:00.000Z	pth	ozette	Maybe an idea would be to remove the plugin and let chrome install it again next time a flash is hit on a page.
2012-09-09T23:00:00.000Z	ozette	pth	good idea i'll try that
