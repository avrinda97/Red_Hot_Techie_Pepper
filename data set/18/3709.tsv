2009-08-14T10:13:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	whats the difference?
2009-08-14T10:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	sudo su calls sudo, su, and a shell.  sudo -i calls sudo and the shell without adding su
2009-08-14T10:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	also, sudo -i is under the control of /etc/sudoers
2009-08-14T10:14:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	still dont get the difference...
2009-08-14T10:15:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	what processor do you have on your PC?
2009-08-14T10:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+
2009-08-14T10:17:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	what does cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor outputs there?

2009-08-14T10:18:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	I have a E7200 wich is supposedly Dual Core but cpuinfo is just listing one of them, any ideas on how to fix this? or is it correct?
2009-08-14T10:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	what does it say in the "cpu cores:" line?
2009-08-14T10:20:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	no cpu_cores line
2009-08-14T10:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	it's a space, not an underscore
2009-08-14T10:21:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	its the same, its not listing it...
2009-08-14T10:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	there might be a bios setting related to it
2009-08-14T10:23:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	ok, so just by checking the bios if that was the problem Ubuntu is going to detect it automagically?
2009-08-14T10:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	ljyanes	it should detect it automatically
2009-08-14T10:58:00.000Z	ljyanes	lstarnes	tnx :)
