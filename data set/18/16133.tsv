2005-04-12T09:16:00.000Z	black_nightmare		thanks for the bit of help at start anyhow
2005-04-12T09:17:00.000Z	black_nightmare		flonne..ok ty...there's many that I wouldn't even need.. especially amiga partitions?? rofl
2005-04-12T09:17:00.000Z	black_nightmare		bye now :p
2005-04-12T06:56:00.000Z	black_nightmare		ok back on my pc now :p
2005-04-12T06:56:00.000Z	black_nightmare		could you repeat that grep command again?
2005-04-12T06:58:00.000Z	black_nightmare		I see a sb16.ko and so on in this list
2005-04-12T06:59:00.000Z	black_nightmare		but I don't see anything really helpful from that command at all
2005-04-12T06:59:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	any 'isa.o' or similar?
2005-04-12T06:59:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	mariano: that command list all the modules (drivers) that relate to ISA support
2005-04-12T07:00:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	mariano: that's OK..
2005-04-12T07:01:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	mariano: as root or using sudo do this: 'sudo modprobe sb16.ko'
2005-04-12T07:02:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	mariano: any output from that? if that doesn't work, try the same but with i2c-isa.ko and then modprobe sb16.ko again
2005-04-12T07:02:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	and you?
2005-04-12T07:47:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	ext3 == journaled file system. ext2 == static file system. reiserfs, trouble.
2005-04-12T07:49:00.000Z	delire	black_nightmare	i enjoy ext3. to convert ext2 --> ext3 simply 'tune2fs -j /dev/<yourpartition>'
