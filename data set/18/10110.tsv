2008-04-15T00:18:00.000Z	Itaku		my ubuntu says /dev/dsp is busy(the sound driver) i get this error alot how do i fix it?
2008-04-15T00:18:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	stop running a sound server, would be my guess
2008-04-15T00:18:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	also why are you using /dev/dsp?
2008-04-15T00:19:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	i never set anything
2008-04-15T00:19:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	how do i stop using the sound server?
2008-04-15T00:20:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	are you using gnome?
2008-04-15T00:21:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	in that case i'm not sure... i guess you need to configure your sound system to use ALSA instead of OSS
2008-04-15T00:22:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	nvidia meaning your video card? If you're using ALSA you shouldn't be getting reports about /dev/dsp
2008-04-15T00:22:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	well thats what i assume cuz VMWare is yelling at me about that
2008-04-15T00:23:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	my sound doesnt work for some reason though you know how to fix it?
2008-04-15T00:25:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	what exactly is going on? you're running vmware?
2008-04-15T00:25:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	it didnt work before i set up vmware
2008-04-15T00:25:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	it happens alot
2008-04-15T00:25:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	with what application?
2008-04-15T00:25:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	just no sound comes out when i play a music
2008-04-15T00:48:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	why do you want to? It's almost always a bad idea
2008-04-15T00:48:00.000Z	Itaku	graft	im really lazy and im too lazy to use sudo and then time in my huge pass
2008-04-15T00:49:00.000Z	graft	Itaku	if you're lazy, you can just disable passwords, or open a root shell, or give yourself a long time before your sudo tickets run out, etc.
