2009-11-06T21:48:00.000Z	Terminus-		hello. question, how do i get fglrx running? i tried going to system -> administration -> hardware drivers but there was nothing about it there.
2009-11-06T21:48:00.000Z	Terminus-		on karmic i mean. all the docs i can find are still for jaunty.
2009-11-06T21:48:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	make sure you have updated and upgraded so that the newest restricted drivers are in this list
2009-11-06T21:49:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	i'm running karmic from a usb drive. doesn't look like restricted is installed. aptitude search restricted gives me nothing. i've just updated.
2009-11-06T21:49:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	no, it would be a system update/upgrade to grab restricted mods
2009-11-06T21:50:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	you wont find them through aptitude
2009-11-06T21:50:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	ah... thanks.
2009-11-06T21:51:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	np
2009-11-06T21:53:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	running software update says everything's up to date. i'm using main and restricted in sources.list, the default.
2009-11-06T21:53:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	this is odd if you need fglrx drivers
2009-11-06T21:54:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	btw, i used the usb startup creator to get karmic running.
2009-11-06T21:55:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	i'm running from the USB right now. don't have a spare drive to do a real install.
2009-11-06T21:55:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	i see
2009-11-06T21:56:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	i should still have the restricted drivers though right?
2009-11-06T21:56:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	i'm not sure, sorry
2009-11-06T21:56:00.000Z	kaneda^	Terminus-	whyu dont you try a slightly different flavor of ubuntu for graphics?
2009-11-06T21:57:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	how slightly different? right now i'm thinking of just installing xorg-driver-fglrx and praying that it works. XD
2009-11-06T21:58:00.000Z	Terminus-	kaneda^	i'll give this a try. thanks for the info. brb.
