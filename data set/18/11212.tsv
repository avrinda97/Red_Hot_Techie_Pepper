2006-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	holycow		i cannot fathom how anyone can possibly use or administer windows anymore
2006-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	holycow		so its all somewhere on the learning curve i guess
2006-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	holycow		heh
2006-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	holycow		and discovering the reason is usually a google away
2006-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	holycow		go and figure out why anything in windows is the way it is
2006-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	holycow		impossible
2006-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	holycow		i don't think ms devs understand it
2006-12-24T11:59:00.000Z	holycow		it requires a bit of skill in each one to setup right
2006-12-24T11:59:00.000Z	holycow		i'm not sure this is the right place for that kind of support
2006-12-24T12:00:00.000Z	holycow		we try to help people install a basic ubuntu system and keep it running
2006-12-24T12:00:00.000Z	chastech	holycow	I have hoary hedgehog and it loaded my printer and it works fine why can't HP Deskjet work on Dapper Drake after it finds it and loads the driver it says :job:stopped
2006-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	chastech	supported model? i would imagine i guess
2006-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	chastech	hard to say, could be an issue with a driver
2006-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	holycow		or and issue with the cups print server
2006-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	chastech	that stuff is fairly easy to debug
2006-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	holycow		you need to enable verbose logging for the cups server
2006-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	chastech		if i new where to start
2006-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	holycow	chastech	then you need to tail -f /var/log/somelogfile for cups to watch what the issue is
