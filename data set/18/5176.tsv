2008-12-14T13:54:00.000Z	euxneks		I'm having a weird error with my keyboard, whenever I press up gnome-screenshot is run
2008-12-14T13:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Check out System -> Keyboard Shortcuts?
2008-12-14T13:57:00.000Z	euxneks	tiyowan	well, see the thing is, it only started doing this after I ran mplayer in fullscreen mode
2008-12-14T13:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Um...hmm...far as I know...there's a shortcut assigned to your up key.
2008-12-14T13:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Could you please go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts and look beside the heading Take A Screenshot?
2008-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	euxneks	tiyowan	tells me that "Up" would make typing impossible which I agree, but I can't remove the shortcut :P
2008-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Odd. Set that back to Print.
2008-12-14T14:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Set it back to print, log out and log in. Maybe that'll clear it up?
2008-12-14T14:00:00.000Z	euxneks	tiyowan	it's been set to print the whole time though :\
2008-12-14T14:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Try it for its own sake? :-)
2008-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Try?
2008-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	euxneks	tiyowan	I have another unrelated question, will in  a bit :D thanks
2008-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Go ahead.
2008-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	I have no clue about that. :)
2008-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	euxneks	tiyowan	thanks :)
2008-12-14T14:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	But I'm sure the experienced users here can help you fix that.
2008-12-14T14:27:00.000Z	euxneks	tiyowan	fyi restarting X fixed up arrow issue
2008-12-14T14:28:00.000Z	tiyowan	euxneks	Useful to know. :-)
