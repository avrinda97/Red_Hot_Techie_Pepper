2006-04-10T12:39:00.000Z	brent		good thing ive still got windows. microsoft may be greedy, but at least they make programs that 'just work'
2006-04-10T12:40:00.000Z	brent		if not nautilus, then why do other burning programs work but nautilus burn does not? explain that
2006-04-10T12:42:00.000Z	brent		i have told you. here is the forth time: it says please insert blank cd. nothing else that is as far as it takes me i dont get any more dialog
2006-04-10T12:42:00.000Z	brent		this seems like a lost cause
2006-04-10T12:42:00.000Z	brent		no
2006-04-10T12:44:00.000Z	brent		when i click write it says "please insert blank disk"
2006-04-10T12:44:00.000Z	brent		that is as far as it goes
2006-04-10T12:44:00.000Z	brent		yes
2006-04-10T12:44:00.000Z	brent		it just keeps saying it after clicking ok
2006-04-10T12:44:00.000Z	brent		media is not bad it is brand new
2006-04-10T12:45:00.000Z	Falstius	brent	I had a similar problem trying to burn DVDs in Nautilus .. it was related to permissions.
2006-04-10T12:45:00.000Z	brent	Falstius	so the solution is, please?
2006-04-10T12:46:00.000Z	Falstius	brent	uhm, don't burn DVDs in Nautilus ;)  I just use the command line or gnomebaker.  It is easier anyway.
2006-04-10T12:47:00.000Z	Falstius	brent	I'm not sure I ever tried with CDs.
2006-04-10T12:49:00.000Z	Falstius	brent	I'm not sure how to fix it.  Just pointing out that I don't think it is a media problem and that Nautilus CD burning is not 100%.
2006-04-10T12:49:00.000Z	brent	Falstius	i know. it is a bug
2006-04-10T13:06:00.000Z	Falstius	brent	there is a configuration option for where nautilus puts the temporary data when making the image to burn to the CD .. maybe you don't have permissions there.
2006-04-10T13:07:00.000Z	Falstius	brent	I'm at work and not on ubuntu .. its in there somewhere?
