2010-09-23T19:36:00.000Z	DTH0		hello all !
2010-09-23T19:37:00.000Z	DTH0		how can i do to know where grub is installed ? (since find /boot/grub/stage1 return error 15 )
2010-09-23T19:39:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	You mean where the MBR is or where the config files are?
2010-09-23T19:39:00.000Z	DTH0	undecim	well hum... i think it's the MBR
2010-09-23T19:39:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	Though I suppose http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/ would give you both
2010-09-23T19:40:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	By default, grub will install the MBR to /dev/sda
2010-09-23T19:40:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	Are you having issues booting with Grub?
2010-09-23T19:41:00.000Z	DTH0	undecim	no i'm trying to install grub gfx (yeah i know, i'm looking for trouble ^^)
2010-09-23T19:41:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	You mean a background or a special version of grub?
2010-09-23T19:42:00.000Z	DTH0	undecim	yes, it's something like that
2010-09-23T19:42:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	Are you following a howto?
2010-09-23T19:43:00.000Z	DTH0	undecim	yeah, and it told me i'd better know that info and remember it somehow
2010-09-23T19:43:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	Can you give me the link to the howto?
2010-09-23T19:43:00.000Z	DTH0	undecim	it's in french :/
2010-09-23T19:44:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	Ahh... Well I suppose I could try a google-translated version of the page.
2010-09-23T19:45:00.000Z	DTH0	undecim	well so here it is for you : http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/grub-gfxboot, have fun and thx
2010-09-23T19:51:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	Found it yet?
2010-09-23T19:52:00.000Z	undecim	DTH0	I read over the howto and understand what you need now. What is the your root device? (i.e. the device that Ubuntu is installed to)
