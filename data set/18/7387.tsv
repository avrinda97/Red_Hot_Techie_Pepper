2008-01-17T03:36:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	are you just trying to enable desktop effects?  in gutsy you should use compiz, which is installed by default.  Or are you looking to use beryl instead for some reason
2008-01-17T03:37:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	simply go to System>Preferences>Appearence>Visual Effects Tab
2008-01-17T03:39:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	I believe you will need to use custom settings to enable the cube, there are several different programs that can configure compiz settings in the repo
2008-01-17T03:40:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	one is called compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-01-17T03:40:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	you will likely have to install it, but after installed you will not have to use sudo
2008-01-17T03:47:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	the drivers for USB are part of the kernel, what problem with them are you experiencing?
2008-01-17T03:47:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	is your soundcard USB?
2008-01-17T03:48:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	well that problem is most likely not a problem with USB drivers, but rather ALSA, which handles sound cards
2008-01-17T03:49:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	is that a flash video?
2008-01-17T03:50:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	does it play the sound after you login?
2008-01-17T03:52:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	what is the output for dpkg -s esound
2008-01-17T03:53:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	no that checks to see if the package esound is installed
2008-01-17T03:53:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	dpkg -s esound  (may require sudo)
2008-01-17T03:55:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	this might be the problem, but I am not sure, you can install esound with sudo apt-get install esound
2008-01-17T03:56:00.000Z	starfall87	lex0	you should trying playing sound in something, make sure that AIM still works, see if anything else works, but it might require a restart
