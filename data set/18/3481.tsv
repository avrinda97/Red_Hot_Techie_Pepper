2009-09-24T19:27:00.000Z	freenose		Hi, to install a minimal configuraction of ubuntu without gnome, should I use the server install?
2009-09-24T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 theres other ways to do a minimal 'desktop' without doing the server instgall
2009-09-24T19:28:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	What other ways?
2009-09-24T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 what desktop do you want to use?
2009-09-24T19:29:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	no desktop, just a WM
2009-09-24T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 a 'server' install has some sever specific tweaks you may not want.
2009-09-24T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 you could always just install openbox and use it - on ubuntu...
2009-09-24T19:30:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	I see, so.. how do you do a minimal desktop?
2009-09-24T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 or xubuntu,  since you will still want most of the gnome-related 'config/support/whatever tools'
2009-09-24T19:31:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	This is an old machine with 10 GB hard drive :/, wanted to save space
2009-09-24T19:31:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	gnome takes up to much space
2009-09-24T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 then remove the parts you dont want. You will want some of the gnome tools/config tools unless you really are going hard core.
2009-09-24T19:32:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	yeah, hard core, all CLI
2009-09-24T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 theres that  (unsupported here) variant called err.. crunchbang. it comes with fluxbox.
2009-09-24T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freenose	 i also saw work on (unsupported here) 200mb or so gnome-light variant
2009-09-24T19:33:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	Yeah, I saw it, actually it uses openbox :)
2009-09-24T19:34:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	yeah, looks like it
2009-09-24T19:35:00.000Z	freenose	Dr_Willis	I just hope I won't break much during uninstall ;)
