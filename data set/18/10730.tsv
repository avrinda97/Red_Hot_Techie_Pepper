2007-02-15T15:24:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	It's actually the reverse, it's running at too high a resolution
2007-02-15T15:24:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	you need to make sure that the horizontal and vertical refresh rates are high enoguh for the resolution you want
2007-02-15T15:24:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	then you have too high a resolution in the xorg.conf
2007-02-15T15:25:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	It's only set to 1024  by 768 in xorg.conf, but the login screen / max resolution is 1600 x 1200
2007-02-15T15:25:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	are you sure you set every bit depth to 1024x768 and that there are no other higher resolutions there?
2007-02-15T15:25:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	Yes
2007-02-15T15:26:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	you can cycle resolutions with ctrl+alt with plus and minus on the keypad too
2007-02-15T15:26:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	If I do that on the login screen will it keep that res?
2007-02-15T15:26:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	maybe try runining the reconfigure script for xorg again
2007-02-15T15:26:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	it should do yeah
2007-02-15T15:26:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	for this login anyway
2007-02-15T15:26:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	Tried that, and when I set it to ati for drivers or fglrx for drivers it properly uses my max res
2007-02-15T15:27:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	When using the radeon drivers it ignores em
2007-02-15T15:27:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	I dunno, but my goal is getting beryl working, and I
2007-02-15T15:28:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	I've only succeeded with radeon
2007-02-15T15:28:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	It's only a testbed
2007-02-15T15:29:00.000Z	linxeh	Sensae	what was the radeon package name ?
2007-02-15T15:30:00.000Z	Sensae	linxeh	Pretty sure it was xorg-driver-ati
