2005-12-02T15:32:00.000Z	jenda	lightbright	Are you qualified enoucgh to say that?  "stick with ext3 UNLESS you want to risk losing data by using reiser"
2005-12-02T15:33:00.000Z	lightbright	jenda	yes from personal experience and what I have learned from Linux users who are veterans in it
2005-12-02T15:34:00.000Z	jenda	lightbright	I prefer reiserfs, although I don't like Hans Reiser :)

2005-12-02T15:39:00.000Z	lightbright	jenda	 good meet you therer
2005-12-02T15:43:00.000Z	lightbright	jenda	notice phogg hasnt even used Linux long time and not a developer!  not really qualified to answer that!  so ask some Debian developers what they have to say about it
2005-12-02T15:45:00.000Z	lightbright	jenda	you cant ask 1 person who fully admits they are new to Linux about it to get an accurate feedback!  you need to ask the Developers
2005-12-31T15:02:00.000Z	lightbright	jenda	hello

2006-01-20T16:48:00.000Z	jenda	lightbright	No need for antiviri on Ubuntu. And long time no see
2006-01-20T16:48:00.000Z	lightbright	jenda	hi :)  but cant you send a virus trhrough email to a windows user?
2006-01-20T16:48:00.000Z	jenda	lightbright	Yes, I guess you can, but then it's their AV, that should catch the viri.
