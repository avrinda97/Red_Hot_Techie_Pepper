2010-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		ON my 500GB main SATA drive I've got Fedora 12 installed already, but that didn't work out well, The partition is using 200GB and I am actually using like 1GB of it :x
2010-07-27T06:15:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		So you guys think that 4GB is enough for Ubuntu + Swap if all I am using Ubuntu for is a platform for cross platform development?
2010-07-27T06:15:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		Or should I go for a smaller distro like Xubuntu or a netbook version?
2010-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		Well, the swap is recommended for 1Gb, how big is Ubuntu itself? Like 1.5GB?
2010-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		Xubuntu is significantly smaller, right?
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		Hehe, I already bought the 4GB. I will look around and see which distro I want
2010-07-27T06:21:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		Actually I just bought a 4GB drive for $12 at Walmart :D
2010-07-27T06:22:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		THATS OVER 9000 BYTES
2010-07-27T06:22:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		Sorry
2010-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe		What, Ubuntu has a free cloud storage system now?
2010-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	Yup. :D
2010-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	And a music service too.
2010-07-27T06:25:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	The music service works with the online cloud storage, so you can sync your songs between multiple computers you own.
2010-07-27T06:28:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	5 sounds a little bit on the heavy side.
2010-07-27T06:49:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	Radeon is ATI?
2010-07-27T06:50:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	Not I. My chipset is NVidia. I do know there are some ATI drivers available in Synaptic though.
2010-07-27T06:51:00.000Z	cypher-neo	DeM0nFiRe	Give it a shot. Most of the video drivers in Ubuntu work natively; they are installed during the initial install when Ubuntu detects your hardware.
2010-07-27T06:52:00.000Z	DeM0nFiRe	cypher-neo	Well, we'll see. The 5800 is the new one, so I know Fedora 12 didn't have drivers when I was looking a couple months ago
