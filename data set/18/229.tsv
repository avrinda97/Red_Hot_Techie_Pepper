2012-09-19T18:21:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Eagle: What are their policies regarding wiretapping?
2012-09-19T18:21:00.000Z	vinceableworld		First I've heard of mumble
2012-09-19T18:23:00.000Z	vinceableworld		IC...
2012-09-19T18:23:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Is mumble cross platform?
2012-09-19T18:23:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Eagle u ever use mumble?
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Thanks for all the input guys/gals
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		How would you compare teamspeak to skype?
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		or mumble to skype?
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		besides the obvious (owned by microcrap)
2012-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	teamspeak, you can predict the path
2012-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	teamspeak is client -> server <- client
2012-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	skype, is P2P, with quite random routing
2012-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	which means communications arent truly secure.
2012-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	i wrote a security opinion on skype, your communications between you and your friend could be routed through, say, China
2012-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	in TeamSpeak, its routed through that server, but its not directly P2P
2012-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	so rather than going through a node in, say, China, the node *is* the server
2012-09-19T18:27:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	you'll need a server to connect to, but generally yes.
2012-09-19T18:27:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	vinceableworld	if you don't have a server, its a moot point
