2005-03-23T07:36:00.000Z	agabus		could someone help me get rhythmbox working with mp3's. please not i already have totem running fine with mp3s
2005-03-23T07:36:00.000Z	xav	agabus	which problem?
2005-03-23T07:37:00.000Z	agabus	xav	- well when i open an mp3 file with rhythmbox, it doesn't do anything at all
2005-03-23T07:38:00.000Z	xav	agabus	all mp3 and only mp3? ogg work fine?
2005-03-23T07:38:00.000Z	xav	agabus	check it
2005-03-23T07:44:00.000Z	xav	agabus	launch it with rhythmbox -d in console. and try to open ur mp3
2005-03-23T07:49:00.000Z	agabus	xav	- i store my mp3 collection on my server, not my local disc. why does linux have such problems with smb?
2005-03-23T07:50:00.000Z	xav	agabus	rhythmbox is like ubuntu, not really bug free :)
2005-03-23T07:50:00.000Z	agabus	xav	- yeh, smb browsing with linux i've found has many problems
2005-03-23T07:51:00.000Z	xav	agabus	ha :)
2005-03-23T07:51:00.000Z	agabus	xav	- but that's most likely a gnome fix anyways with the new gnome 2.10
2005-03-23T07:51:00.000Z	xav	agabus	well its right that samba is not easy to configure
2005-03-23T07:52:00.000Z	xav	agabus	it worked for me in previous version too, but maybe its better in 2.10
2005-03-23T07:52:00.000Z	xav	agabus	which os is your server running?
2005-03-23T07:52:00.000Z	agabus	xav	- yeh, the pretty much 1 reason from stopping me from converting to ubuntu/gnome is that i can't browse my windows shares on other computers in my lan properly
2005-03-23T07:56:00.000Z	xav	agabus	good idea
2005-03-23T07:58:00.000Z	xav	agabus	linux is a powerful server, I don't see the problem. it'll work fine if its well configured. just check that ur printer is well supported
2005-03-23T07:59:00.000Z	agabus	xav	- yeh i know, i'll prove it to him soneday soon enough. but for now im goin to bed
