2007-01-05T15:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	linux is an alternative to windows but there is no definition of linux other than its an operating system
2007-01-05T15:56:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	linux isnt even an OS
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	not a good place to troll. and yes linux is an operating system
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	who said i was trolling? it's a kernel
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	a kernel is not an OS
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	yes and no
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	the backbone of linux == kernel
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	no. linux is a kernel. it is not an OS. GNU is the OS
2007-01-05T15:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	kernel does nothing for you without modules/app/programs
2007-01-05T15:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	if you want to get technical GNU is a flavor of the apps provided with the kernel
2007-01-05T15:59:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	right
2007-01-05T15:59:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	and the kernel is linux
2007-01-05T16:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	in generally speaking for a troll that doesnt care of what he types nor the answer he gets linux == oS is fine IMO
2007-01-05T16:01:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	please. you have no proof that i am a troll other than you disagree with me
2007-01-05T16:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	that weasnt meant for you please read it and see what i said to IMMORTAL
2007-01-05T16:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	h3xis	IMMORTAL was the troll i was referring to
2007-01-05T16:03:00.000Z	h3xis	gnomefreak	oh sorry. i thought you were speaking in some form, my apologies XD
