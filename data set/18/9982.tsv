2007-01-26T12:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid		would someone help me with an interface problem??
2007-01-26T12:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid		its kind of hard to explain
2007-01-26T13:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid		but the point is, my broadcomm card has the bcmwl5a.inf file installed with ndiswrapper. Ndiswrapper is loaded and runs, however when I restart the interface is always down, how can I bring the interface up always? Also let me say that on CLI mode 'iwlist scan' shows my SSID, but on Networking there is '' none, zilch,nothing detected
2007-01-26T13:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid		Im using Edgy
2007-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	SurfnKid		Does anyone use the Broadcomm Wireless Chipset?
2007-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	shatrat	SurfnKid	I do, I followed the how-to on the ubuntuforums and it wokred first try
2007-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	shatrat	SurfnKid	I dont even remember everything I did cause it worked with no tinkering
2007-01-26T13:04:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	would you point me out to which, mine works, however when i restart, the adapter is always off
2007-01-26T13:04:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	Dapper was like that, easy quick and no tinkering
2007-01-26T13:04:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	ok thx
2007-01-26T13:05:00.000Z	shatrat	SurfnKid	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174 thats the how-to.  My laptop had the 4319 chipset which causes all the trouble so I ended up having to use special instructions at the end.
2007-01-26T13:06:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	ok let me check it out, the card works 100% however when I restart, log back in, the card is ON, but Networking unchecks it as being on, all the time, so I just need it to be compeltely on.
2007-01-26T13:06:00.000Z	shatrat	SurfnKid	I see
2007-01-26T13:07:00.000Z	shatrat	SurfnKid	what network manager are you using? Im using network-manager-gnome and it is hot stuff
2007-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	same, I can turn it on manually, but reboot come back and its turned off again, its annoying, Im using the bcmwl5a.inf type installation with ndiswrapper. Also network-mgr-gnome doesnt detect any SSID's, when in reality 'iwlist scan' shows that there is one available
2007-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	i have never had this problem ever, I just did an Edgy install, Dapper was fine.
2007-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	shatrat	SurfnKid	Well, I have no further insight for you :(  Wireless is a big confusing mess. Wire the world I say! Outlets every 3 feet!
2007-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	SurfnKid	shatrat	let me read up a bit if i think of something to ask i'll tell ya cheers
