2008-05-02T08:24:00.000Z	chris_420	mjbrooks	yes but its shut off through bios
2008-05-02T08:24:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	darn.. that was what I was going to suggest  :/
2008-05-02T08:26:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	I had a friend with a similar problem, here's what fixed it
2008-05-02T08:28:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	uncomment blacklist snd-atiixp-modem in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-modem
2008-05-02T08:29:00.000Z	chris_420	mjbrooks	: ok let me give that a try... if it don't work im a put it back lol
2008-05-02T08:38:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	you could try uncommenting the other ones in there
2008-05-02T08:38:00.000Z	chris_420	mjbrooks	im a try one by one...
2008-05-02T08:38:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	not sure if you have one of those, but they cause the same problems
2008-05-02T08:39:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	you can do them all at onece... no harm
2008-05-02T08:39:00.000Z	mjbrooks	chris_420	you'll only have one of them so it won't harm it
