2007-01-31T06:13:00.000Z	jimmie		cus im a noob
2007-01-31T06:13:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	yes, Ubuntu has GNOME and Kubuntu has KDE
2007-01-31T06:14:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	there is a ton of differences. best to try KDE for yourself i believe
2007-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	actually i suggest that you use "sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop" if you are not sure that you will keep KDE. that is done from a terminal
2007-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	by selecting it for installation. or by using either of apt-get or aptitude with the syntax above
2007-01-31T06:20:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	that's fine, just keep in mind that removing it later might not be entirely easy that way
2007-01-31T06:21:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	no. if you install using Synaptic now, apitude won't be of any use to remove it later
2007-01-31T06:23:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	*i* think the best way is typing "sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop" in a terminal.
2007-01-31T06:23:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	yes!
2007-01-31T06:24:00.000Z	jimmie	FairLite	ok.. what will happen after the installing is done?
2007-01-31T06:25:00.000Z	FairLite	jimmie	nothing. only, at the login screen (where you put username and password), you will be able to click on the "Options" button, and select a KDE session
