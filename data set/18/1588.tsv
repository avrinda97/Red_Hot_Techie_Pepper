2011-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	vkj		@bhazhang any idea what i can do
2011-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	Edit the jira-application.properties file (see the JIRA Installation Directory page to find where this file is located), add a 'jira.home' property and set it to your desired location for the JIRA home directory.
2011-07-11T11:33:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	setting the home directory is explained in detail here: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Setting+your+JIRA+Home+Directory
2011-07-11T11:34:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	by the way, it's "jira_home", not "java_home"
2011-07-11T11:37:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	to set the environment variable, you use the export command but it may not be necessary in linux... if it is, you should find the directory in /etc
2011-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	as in "export JAVA_HOME=/etc/java-something-or-other
2011-07-11T11:40:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	assuming you are using the gnome desktop, open Places->Computer and look through the /etc folder for what looks like the java installation directory
2011-07-11T11:42:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	sounds like it to me :)
2011-07-11T11:42:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	sounds more like it to me :D
2011-07-11T11:43:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	I'd try "export JAVA_HOME=/etc/java-6-sun" first and then the other if that doesn't work
2011-07-11T11:43:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	yup
2011-07-11T11:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	remember that things are case sensitive in linux
2011-07-11T11:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vkj	glad to help
