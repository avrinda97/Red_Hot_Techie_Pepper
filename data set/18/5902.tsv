2008-08-07T14:13:00.000Z	Scorp	DozedOnLinux	OK !!
2008-08-07T14:16:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	Scorp	: had him add to xorg.conf (to get login screen to come up) Option "AGPMode" "4"    . reference> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsAti    Radeon 9000     RV250
2008-08-07T15:07:00.000Z	Scorp	DozedOnLinux	I basically told him to use dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg so that gets the xorg.conf to the generic version
2008-08-07T15:07:00.000Z	Scorp	DozedOnLinux	if that doesnt work, look for backups in /etc/X11/xorg.conf* and use any one of them which sets ur system working....
