2008-07-23T04:43:00.000Z	zerogate		i didn't have my menu.lst ubgradet during my gutsy to hardy upgrade but i should have, what can i do now?
2008-07-23T04:43:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	does this command still want to upgrade packages?   sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
2008-07-23T04:44:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	yes
2008-07-23T04:45:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	i guess you will have to complete the upgrade then, it seems the upgrade failed.
2008-07-23T04:45:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	but during the upgrade i was asked if i want the menu.lst upgraded and i said "no"
2008-07-23T04:46:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	but now i want to say yes but i think it is too late
2008-07-23T04:47:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	hmm, yea.  maybe this does it.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow grub; sudo update-grub
2008-07-23T04:47:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	thx i will try
2008-07-23T04:47:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	do that once aptitude has finished upgrading tho
2008-07-23T04:49:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	hmm it says that it has updated menu.lst but it has not
2008-07-23T04:49:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	there is still the gutsy kernel
2008-07-25T02:02:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	ls -l $(readlink -f file)
2008-07-25T03:28:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	better to.   sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop
2008-07-25T03:28:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	gdm stop doesn't work for me
2008-07-25T03:29:00.000Z	unop	zerogate	it ought to, killing gdm directly doesn't give a chance for pid files to be cleaned up
2008-07-25T03:31:00.000Z	zerogate	unop	hmm - ah you'Re right! it didn'T work because i was executing gdm while being in /etc/init.d insted of executing ./gdm
