2006-01-17T14:41:00.000Z	specialbuddy		it's easy to understand why people don't go with something other then windows because I can't even get a monitor to work correctly
2006-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	specialbuddy		what do I have to do to get my monitor to work
2006-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	specialbuddy		?
2006-01-17T14:44:00.000Z	specialbuddy		It should work
2006-01-17T14:44:00.000Z	specialbuddy		It knows my video card and it knows what kind of monitor it is
2006-01-17T14:44:00.000Z	specialbuddy		but I can't change the resolution
2006-01-17T14:46:00.000Z	specialbuddy		well I want to know why I can't go into display and fix the resolution size
2006-01-17T14:47:00.000Z	specialbuddy		disconnected myself on accident
2006-01-17T14:48:00.000Z	specialbuddy		desktop 640x480
2006-01-17T14:48:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	you _need_ to read the wiki.
2006-01-17T14:49:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	you should then do what it says
2006-01-17T14:49:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	you still need to edit xorg.conf it doesn't work correctly
2006-01-17T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	like the wiki says
2006-01-17T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	well it's not fine or it would work. did you specify HorizSync and VertRefresh to the values your monitor manual lists?
2006-01-17T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	then google does
2006-01-17T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	like the wiki says, again
2006-01-17T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	I thougt you read it
2006-01-18T17:56:00.000Z	mwe	specialbuddy	add universe to sources.list
