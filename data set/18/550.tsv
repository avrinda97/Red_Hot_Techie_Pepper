2012-06-14T08:45:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	you want only you to be able to run it or you want everyone to
2012-06-14T08:47:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	No i just want to run and develop it from there

2012-06-14T08:54:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	so chmod it
2012-06-14T08:58:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	Now i have copied it to www now what i have o do
2012-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	chmod it and/or chown it
2012-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	can you tell me elaborately how to do it
2012-06-14T09:06:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	i have read the properties of that file and its written i am not the owner of that it root but my account is administrator account
2012-06-14T09:06:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	what should i do
2012-06-14T09:07:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	chmod 755 is pretty generic should work
2012-06-14T09:08:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	so waht i shoud write in terminal sudo chmod 755 /var/www/file.php
2012-06-14T09:15:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	rajiv@rajiv:~$ /home/public$ chmod 755 file.php bash: /home/public$: No such file or directory
2012-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	so file.php doesnt exist use exact locaiton or cd to the dir first
2012-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	or use relative location
2012-06-14T09:19:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	chmod: changing permissions of `file.php': Operation not permitted
2012-06-14T09:20:00.000Z	Raji	celthunder	i have done that now it showing this error
2012-06-14T09:20:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	so do it as root and as someone else said rtfm this is basic stuff you should know about
2012-06-14T09:24:00.000Z	celthunder	Raji	probably because you arent root. if you want a lazy fix chown /var/www into a group you and apache are in and then change the group permissions
