2008-04-05T19:44:00.000Z	lopin		And the output is messing them all up...
2008-04-05T19:45:00.000Z	lopin		tee's not working... Gonna try a pipe...
2008-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	lopin		I'm just trying to set up the init.d, so I don't want to type a damn thing...
2008-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	lopin		So, it starts up Folding@HOME, webcam, and SC_Server on start up...
2008-04-05T19:47:00.000Z	lopin		With a pipe?
2008-04-05T19:49:00.000Z	lopin		That's what I was doing...  I thought > was called tee...
2008-04-05T19:50:00.000Z	lopin		Okay...  Well, regardless, there's still text going across my screen...
