2011-04-30T23:39:00.000Z	Froq		What language are kernels written in?
2011-04-30T23:40:00.000Z	Froq		O... where can I get the source code for the kernel ubuntu uses?
2011-04-30T23:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	apt-get source linux-image-* (depends on the version you want)
2011-04-30T23:42:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	that'll check out all the files used to build the package so you can rebuild them yourself; if you want to maintain modifications it might be easier to familiarize yourself with the debian maintainer tools, and stuff like pbuilder
2011-04-30T23:57:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	iw phy phy0 info
2011-04-30T23:57:00.000Z	Froq	ohsix	thanks
2011-05-01T00:01:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	theres a ton of files in it :] like tons
2011-05-01T00:01:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	not a million but over 50k
2011-05-01T00:01:00.000Z	Froq	ohsix	must be... but it is only 75MB.... that isn't very big. lol... but I guess it is too.
2011-05-01T00:03:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	he asked how to get the source code, not how to browse it
2011-05-01T00:04:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	theres the upstream kernels git browser and launchpads bzr browser for it's local kernel branches
2011-05-01T00:04:00.000Z	Froq	ohsix	o man, you are so smart, talking over my head! :)
2011-05-01T00:04:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	first message was meant for rgr
2011-05-01T00:06:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	if that's all you wanted, you might be interested in http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=tree
2011-05-01T00:07:00.000Z	Froq	ohsix	yeah!  that is what i wnated! could have had it 30 minutes ago if I could just better articulate my desires, huh?  thanks
2011-05-01T00:07:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	that's linus' kernel tree; and doesn't include ubuntu patches (they're in their own tree) but if you're not interested in building it or anything, it should suffice
2011-05-01T00:07:00.000Z	ohsix	Froq	well it's a very general question, i assumed it was ubuntu related and you wanted to rebuild it or something :] no harm no foul
2011-05-01T00:08:00.000Z	Froq	ohsix	right on!
