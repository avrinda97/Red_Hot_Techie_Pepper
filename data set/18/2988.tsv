2010-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	EsatYuce		what is the suffix one application?
2010-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	mattameus	EsatYuce	when you look at the icon below it there should be a filename, that filename will end with something like .deb or .tgz
2010-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	mattameus		the suffix is what comes after the '.'
2010-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	EsatYuce		are these for application like .exe on Windows?
2010-01-08T10:09:00.000Z	mattameus	EsatYuce	usually applications on ubuntu are distributed in package form (they end in .deb), which is somewhat similar to a .exe installer on windows
2010-01-08T10:10:00.000Z	EsatYuce	mattameus	 thnaks
2010-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	EsatYuce		How can i search one unknow files with suffix .deb?
2010-01-08T10:12:00.000Z	EsatYuce		i typed *.deb in my home directory, there is no result
2010-01-08T10:13:00.000Z	mattameus	EsatYuce	if you want to find all files that end in deb you open a terminal and run "sudo find / -name -print" without the parenthesis, there is probably a nicer gui way, but I don't keep up on those things
2010-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	mattameus	EsatYuce	it will return the locations of all files that end in .deb
2010-01-08T10:17:00.000Z	mattameus	EsatYuce	you said you were trying to install cmusphinx? it appears those files are not .deb files, and will be a bit more painful to install, at least if you downloaded them from http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wordpress/download/
2010-01-08T10:23:00.000Z	mattameus	EsatYuce	type ALT+F2, then click on "Run in Terminal" and paste this into the textbox (without quotes) "sudo apt-get install sphinx2-bin"
