2012-01-13T11:06:00.000Z	Brewster		Might I be able to put forth a suggestion for ubuntu 12?
2012-01-13T11:07:00.000Z	Brewster		such as when you open a window make it so that it doesn't open at the top left where it is extremely difficult to move or resize especially since the close buttons are hidden when a window is opened in this manner?
2012-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	Brewster		oh
2012-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	Brewster		ok

2012-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	Brewster		it happens 100% of the time on my computer
2012-01-13T11:09:00.000Z	Kimmen	Brewster	which DE are you running? Unity? Gnome? wtc
2012-01-13T11:09:00.000Z	Brewster		Unity

2012-01-13T11:09:00.000Z	Brewster		I havent used KDE Plasma or gnome3 in a while
2012-01-13T11:09:00.000Z	Brewster		it is the regular edition
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Brewster		desktop
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Brewster		but I have it on a laptop
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Brewster		seeing that it is not technically a netbook there should'nt be a problem
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Kimmen	Brewster	if you have compiz running you can use ccsm to change window placement behavious
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Brewster		shouldn't
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Kimmen		behaviour*
2012-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Brewster	Kimmen	I haven't thought of that
