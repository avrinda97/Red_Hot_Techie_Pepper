2007-06-10T11:54:00.000Z	matthew		I've given up attempting to become a programmer; I have enough trouble figuring out the formation of the Linux filesystems
2007-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	matthew		help?
2007-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	matthew		Oh.... any explanations on installing w32codec?
2007-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	matthew		I'm having the worst of tribulations
2007-06-10T11:57:00.000Z	matthew		Anybody able to assist me with the installation of w32codecs?
2007-06-10T11:57:00.000Z	matthew		I know it's pathetic and there are online intructions but I've failed repetitiously
2007-06-10T11:58:00.000Z	matthew		although, i did finally manage to install wine
2007-06-10T11:58:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	you have the .deb package down loaded  ?
2007-06-10T11:59:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	 sudo dpkg -i path/to/packagename.deb     it's that simple    iirc.
2007-06-10T12:01:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	err i think there was also a script in either that package or the one for dvds    i dont  remember which.  but you had to do something like  sudo sh /usr/lib/something/script.sh       to finish the install but that should be in the instructions if it's the codecs.
2007-06-10T12:03:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	 if no one pipes up with the answer   you can always     dpkg -L <packagename> | grep .sh     and see if it had a script in it  :)
2007-06-10T12:05:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	oh.  /msg ubotu codecs     i think
2007-06-10T12:06:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	 it's   http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
2007-06-10T12:07:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	sorry about the misscue,  was w32codecs that held the url
2007-06-10T12:09:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	 yeah  i said  /msg ubotu codecs  it was   /msg ubotu w32codecs    sorry.
2007-06-10T12:13:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	give me a minute let me find it for you.
2007-06-10T12:16:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	 feisty ?
2007-06-10T12:26:00.000Z	intelikey	matthew	yep.      or just  sudo dpkg -i <the-file-you-dl'd.deb>
