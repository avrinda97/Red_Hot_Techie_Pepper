2011-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	daniel		hello would anyone be able to help me download a .tgz program
2011-02-01T17:33:00.000Z	daniel		how do i install a .tgz file
2011-02-01T17:33:00.000Z	randomus1r	daniel	extract by 'tar xvf filename', read the install file; it's usually source and needs a manual compile
2011-02-01T17:34:00.000Z	daniel		its called tibia870.tgz from tibia.com
2011-02-01T17:34:00.000Z	daniel		it says its for linux
2011-02-01T17:35:00.000Z	randomus1r		or INSTALL
2011-02-01T17:35:00.000Z	randomus1r		but it is manual compiling, if they offer another package, it'd be easier
2011-02-01T17:35:00.000Z	randomus1r		like .deb or something
2011-02-01T17:36:00.000Z	daniel		daniel@Shelia:~$ tar -xvf Tibia870.tgz
2011-02-01T17:36:00.000Z	daniel		tar: Tibia870.tgz: Cannot open: No such file or directory
2011-02-01T17:36:00.000Z	daniel		tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
2011-02-01T17:36:00.000Z	daniel		daniel@Shelia:~$
2011-02-01T17:36:00.000Z	daniel		thats what it gave me
2011-02-01T17:37:00.000Z	randomus1r		Please, if someone sees my question, raise your hand.
2011-02-01T17:39:00.000Z	daniel	randomus1r	how do i tar xvf something the file name is Tibia870.tgz
2011-02-01T17:40:00.000Z	randomus1r	daniel	can you open a terminal and do this: cd path/to/the/tar/file/directory/
2011-02-01T17:41:00.000Z	daniel	randomus1r	no such file or directory
