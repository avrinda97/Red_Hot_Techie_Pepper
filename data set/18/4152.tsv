2009-05-31T09:24:00.000Z	kerebrus_		vlc closes soon as it starts to load dvd
2009-05-31T09:25:00.000Z	kerebrus_		yes and mplayer crashed very hard
2009-05-31T09:26:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	 I believe you will have to disable the desktop effects.
2009-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	 do you have the desktop effects enabled?
2009-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	kerebrus_	Detrix	where would I find that out?
2009-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	that probably means no. but to be sure go to system -> preferences -> apperence
2009-05-31T09:32:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	when the window opens, go to the tab on far right "visual effects"
2009-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	kerebrus_	Detrix	normal
2009-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	 ok, try none....sucks but the visual effects take up resourse
2009-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	kerebrus_	Detrix	lol no thanks I like my desktop looking good, ill just rip the vid to iso then watch it then delete it.
2009-05-31T09:37:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	 understood.  :)
2009-05-31T09:37:00.000Z	kerebrus_	Detrix	thanks for the help though
2009-05-31T09:38:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	though it might be easer to turn off the effects, watch the movie, then turn the effects back on.
2009-05-31T09:38:00.000Z	kerebrus_	Detrix	I tried still wouldnt play.
2009-05-31T09:39:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	 did you do the css_install?
2009-05-31T09:41:00.000Z	Detrix	kerebrus_	 ok I am running out of ideas then..lol
