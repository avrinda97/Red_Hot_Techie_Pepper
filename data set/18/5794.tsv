2009-12-26T22:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	if you want to compile a kernel for write access I'm sure its possible
2009-12-26T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	what fs does it use?
2009-12-26T22:34:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	i believe it is ufs (unix file system)
2009-12-26T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/bsd-17/mount-ufs-partitions-not-slices-from-linux-etcfstab-425047/#post2217856    has an fstab example, you can also use the entry rearranged to form a mount command'
2009-12-26T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	seems to be a recognised fs to the kernel
2009-12-26T22:43:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	yeah just trying to do it from the GUI isn't permitted it looks like.
2009-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	scsi disks are called what in /dev ?
2009-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	you'll need to run the gui with gksudo, i'd add anentry in fstab to automount it
2009-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	sudo fdisk -l    will tell you
2009-12-26T22:46:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	this mount will only be in there for 2 minutes then i'm putting another one on. I can make it so the GUI can auto mount ufs whenever I put a disk in that is that format?
2009-12-26T22:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	the gconf should mount it, or you will av to manually mount again
2009-12-26T22:47:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	lol so you know i know nothing about any of this:)
2009-12-26T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	use better mount options
2009-12-26T22:52:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	what do you mean? i'm looking through dmesg and its telling me that ufs was compiled with read-only support.

2009-12-26T22:57:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	Ill go a different path before that:)
2009-12-26T23:01:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ActionParsnip1	ah got it working, ufs support is in a module instead of in the kernel or... something lol
2009-12-26T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	PureEvilGeek	cool
