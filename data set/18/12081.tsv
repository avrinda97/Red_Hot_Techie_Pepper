2006-06-18T08:32:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	scifi	go to www.bootdisks.com, and download the win98se bootdisk, and save it to a floppy disk. Restart the PC with it in and get into a dos prompt, than run fdisk
2006-06-18T08:33:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	scifi	you've never used fdisk before?
2006-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	scifi	actually now that I remember fdisk will only create and delete partitions. If you want to format the partition you have to use something else.
2006-06-18T08:35:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	scifi	are you on a high-speed connection ?
