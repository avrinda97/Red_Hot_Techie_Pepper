2010-10-16T18:10:00.000Z	argued		Hi.. is there a script out there for saving installed software/ppa:s I could use before fresh install?
2010-10-16T18:12:00.000Z	chu_	argued	there should be a way to export a list of packages to a file through synaptic, though, I'm not sure if sources.list records PPAs (someone else?)
2010-10-16T18:13:00.000Z	argued		chu: yes there is.. I am asking since I havent seen a script like that and took a chance to ask first
2010-10-16T18:14:00.000Z	argued		I am virtu.. run lshw
2010-10-16T18:14:00.000Z	argued		- I am
2010-10-16T18:15:00.000Z	chu_	argued	if you don't mind using a terminal, you could write a simple bash script which does something like "dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > $package-list" and saves your sources.list (assuming PPAs are recorded), then write a script to restore them after re-install.
2010-10-16T18:16:00.000Z	argued		chu: I am looking over that option atm.. thanks for the confirm - seems I am on the right path
2010-10-16T18:16:00.000Z	argued		if all goes well I ll release it at gnome-look
2010-10-16T18:17:00.000Z	chu_	argued	I'm guessing "dpkg --set-selections > $package-list" would then restore the packages. But I don't know how you can save your PPAs.
2010-10-16T18:17:00.000Z	argued		cojage.. if u have restricted extras then u should have rar/unrar services as well
2010-10-16T18:18:00.000Z	argued		chu: thats the second step.. involving all the keys as well
2010-10-16T18:18:00.000Z	chu_	argued	I've written something similar if you are interested? It does all that, but saves some important files (mainly config files)
2010-10-16T18:18:00.000Z	argued		das_coach... not a thing
2010-10-16T18:19:00.000Z	argued		chu.. I ll give it a try and return if I get stucked on the way ..maybe we could compare the code and see if we could figure it out
2010-10-16T18:19:00.000Z	chu_	argued	sure, sounds good.
2010-10-16T18:19:00.000Z	argued	das_coach	u should be in the right place
2010-10-16T18:20:00.000Z	argued		but I am sry, cant help u with that myself
2010-10-16T18:20:00.000Z	chu_	argued	I have never given it out because it's literally 5 lines of bash code, anyone could redo it if they wanted :p
