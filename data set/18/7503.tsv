2007-12-28T18:58:00.000Z	Wander_w		who is tilda?
2007-12-28T18:58:00.000Z	sayers	Wander_w	a terminal emulator like in games where you pres a key and it drops down.
2007-12-28T18:58:00.000Z	sayers	Wander_w	wait I was confused it is also a key right above tab left of 1
2007-12-28T18:59:00.000Z	Wander_w		can't say i'd be impressed by that
2007-12-28T18:59:00.000Z	sayers		If you used the terminal a lot you would be.
2007-12-28T18:59:00.000Z	Wander_w		1 terminal isn't enough anyway
2007-12-28T18:59:00.000Z	Wander_w		(got nine running now)
2007-12-28T19:00:00.000Z	Wander_w		I like to keep 9 terminals on 1 screen, keeps stuff easily accesable
2007-12-28T19:00:00.000Z	sayers	Wander_w	9 is a bit much :)
2007-12-28T19:00:00.000Z	Wander_w	sayers	no its not
2007-12-28T19:00:00.000Z	sayers		unless you dont have a desktop environment
2007-12-28T19:01:00.000Z	Wander_w	sayers	I have a desktop enviroment
2007-12-28T19:01:00.000Z	sayers		I doubt all 8 are being used or you love terminal apps
2007-12-28T19:01:00.000Z	Wander_w	sayers	in the old days I used to have as much as 18 running, didn't have an IDE then
2007-12-28T19:01:00.000Z	sayers		Or your a developer :)
2007-12-28T19:01:00.000Z	Wander_w		yes, am an developer
2007-12-28T19:03:00.000Z	sayers	Wander_w	well I use ubuntu as my desktop nonstop and at most have like 3 tabs in a terminal open for server work
2007-12-28T19:03:00.000Z	Wander_w	sayers	Well: to each his own style, but I've used all the terminals (9) at least once today
