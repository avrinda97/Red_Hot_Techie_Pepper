2010-05-27T17:07:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		Hello all, i have a problem with a single USB stick - only this stick is not being auto mounted.can you give me the possible reasons for this issue? thanks/
2010-05-27T17:07:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	wrong filesystem? a or no partitions?
2010-05-27T17:09:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	can you be more specific? what do you mean by wrong and no partitions?
2010-05-27T17:09:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	whiche filesystem do you have on your usb stick?
2010-05-27T17:10:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	and do you have a partition or not?
2010-05-27T17:10:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	check what dmesg says when you insert the stick?
2010-05-27T17:10:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	ok , i'll give you the output in just a sec
2010-05-27T17:12:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	http://sprunge.us/NPhW can you tell what you see and understand ? thanks
2010-05-27T17:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	i can see an usb thing is detected, it has a partition, and it's called /dev/sdb1
2010-05-27T17:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	it's not in /media/SOMEWHERE?
2010-05-27T17:16:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	No.that is the main problem.Usually it was mounting the device into /media/KINGSTON
2010-05-27T17:16:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	you don't want to mount it yourself, do you?
2010-05-27T17:18:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	No , actually the main purpose of this low-storage USB stick is to hold some small tar files - a small backup files which i want to create automatically. I wrote a udev rule for that stick and all is working fine but no auto mount.
2010-05-27T17:19:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	hahaha. if it's small, create a gmail account, send it there by mail
2010-05-27T17:19:00.000Z	tarzeau	RanyAlbeg	crontab rule to do it daily?
2010-05-27T17:19:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	I have another USB stick and he is being auto mounted each time i plug it in.
2010-05-27T17:21:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	thats a nice idea in itself.But - is it so difficult to restore some settings i might have changed?
2010-05-27T17:23:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	tarzeau	I must have accidentally changed some settings related to this specific fs
