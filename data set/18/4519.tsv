2009-03-28T21:20:00.000Z	paulEU		hi! I have question: is there a chance add packages subversion-1.6.x for 8.04 LTS in backports? I see that there is 1.5.x, who is responsible for this package?
2009-03-28T21:20:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	your best bet is to see if they have a PPA
2009-03-28T21:21:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	PPA? Could you explain what's mean? :)
2009-03-28T21:21:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	its a repository that has newer software than the baseline ---- basically you add it to synaptic and then can get the newer versions
2009-03-28T21:22:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	personal package archive
2009-03-28T21:23:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	Do you suggest to find repo for this package and add into synaptic?
2009-03-28T21:23:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	they dont have one ... sorry
2009-03-28T21:23:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	even jaunty is still at 1.5 -- are you sure 1.6 is stable?
2009-03-28T21:24:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	yes, I tried find it. In official version is 1.4.x subversion, on backports there is 1.5.x, and I hope that there will be 1.6 too ;)
2009-03-28T21:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	do you want SVN or CVS ?
2009-03-28T21:25:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	packages subversion
2009-03-28T21:25:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	for 8.04 LTS
2009-03-28T21:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	you'll have to compile it yourself, jaunty (newest devel version) is still sitting on 1.5.4
2009-03-28T21:27:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	yes, because version 1.6 is fresh (it was released some days ago)
2009-03-28T21:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	so just wait and see - or compile it yourself
2009-03-28T21:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	paulEU	come back when this says 1.6
2009-03-28T21:28:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	yes, I'll wait some day, maybe there will be available for 8.04
2009-03-28T21:29:00.000Z	paulEU	Cpudan80	thanks for informations
