2005-08-26T14:13:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	i can't use either of those
2005-08-26T14:13:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	no X environment
2005-08-26T14:13:00.000Z	nickrud	vitriol	aptitude is ncurses, works in a virtual terminal
2005-08-26T14:14:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	oohh my mistake :)

2005-08-26T14:16:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	i think that might be working! thanks!!
2005-08-26T14:16:00.000Z	nickrud	vitriol	np.
2005-08-26T14:32:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	i'm still desktopless :\
2005-08-26T14:33:00.000Z	nickrud	vitriol	apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop will show you what is needed for ubuntu-desktop; something under that is broken somewhere. Welcome to breezy :)
2005-08-26T14:33:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	ahh ok
2005-08-26T14:34:00.000Z	nickrud	vitriol	you can interactively examine that list and try fixing it in aptitude.
2005-08-26T14:34:00.000Z	vitriol	nickrud	k i'll try that
