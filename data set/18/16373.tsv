2004-12-03T07:38:00.000Z	jmhodges		my grub-fu is weak
2004-12-03T07:38:00.000Z	jmhodges		im sitting on this live cd right now trying to figure out how to re-install the grub bits i had on my hard drive into my mbr now that i've overwritten them with a windows install in another partition
2004-12-03T07:40:00.000Z	jmhodges		GammaRay, hehe
2004-12-03T07:40:00.000Z	jmhodges		i knew how to do this with lilo
2004-12-03T07:41:00.000Z	jmhodges		neither seemed to work
2004-12-03T07:41:00.000Z	jmhodges		and .. something else.. trying to remember what..
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	jmhodges		oh, the latter was grub fromt he cd with the --config-file.. (which was stupid i know) and then i tried grub-install with the -directory deal pointed at the grub dir in /boot on the hd
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	jmhodges		let me get the output
2004-12-03T07:44:00.000Z	jmhodges		but im nto sure if its what i want
2004-12-03T07:44:00.000Z	wasabi	jmhodges	edit /etc/mtab
2004-12-03T07:44:00.000Z	jmhodges	wasabi	ok.. to what? :/
2004-12-03T07:45:00.000Z	jmhodges	wasabi	ahhh i see
2004-12-03T07:48:00.000Z	jmhodges	wasabi	btw, that didnt work either with this line in mtab "/boot /mnt/hda1 ext3 rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0"
2004-12-03T07:49:00.000Z	jmhodges	wasabi	ah, ok
2004-12-03T07:49:00.000Z	jmhodges	wasabi	well /boot is inside of a larger partition, not one by itsel
2004-12-03T07:50:00.000Z	wasabi	jmhodges	eh? you don't have a /boot? oh. then you don't need to mess with mtab at all
2004-12-03T07:50:00.000Z	jmhodges	wasabi	right, theres the issue..
