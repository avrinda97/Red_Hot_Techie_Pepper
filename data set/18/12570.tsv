2006-04-02T06:05:00.000Z	Chillien	sfaris	I figured I will give ubuntu up and install Win XP
2006-04-02T06:08:00.000Z	sfaris	Chillien	ubuntu/linux might seem a bit harder, but all it takes is some learning and you will do fine.. you cant know everything from start, you need experience.. How long have you tried linux/ubuntu?
2006-04-02T06:08:00.000Z	Chillien	sfaris	I am going to use linux to write essays, chat, use Ventrilo and play a game called Counter Strike
