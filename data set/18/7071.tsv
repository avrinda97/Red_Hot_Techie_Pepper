2008-02-11T14:21:00.000Z	Mushrooms		wouldn't it be better if i just aborted the installation and plugged in a ethernet cable?
2008-02-11T14:22:00.000Z	Mushrooms		so... what if it doesn't time out?
2008-02-11T14:24:00.000Z	Mushrooms		thanks for your help ^-^
2008-02-11T14:25:00.000Z	Mushrooms		what does it mean when it says "commented out"
2008-02-11T14:26:00.000Z	Mushrooms		ok... so i really don't need to worry about the commented stuff right? i mean i can install all of those files that didn't get installed from the repositories?
2008-02-11T14:27:00.000Z	Mushrooms		i see... well not really... i guess i'll need to complete the installation first, connect to the internet and then try to understand what you guys mean >.<
2008-02-11T14:28:00.000Z	Mushrooms		and hmm... sorry..>.< i might need a hand configuring the wireless too
2008-02-11T14:28:00.000Z	Mushrooms		but i'll have a crack at it first
