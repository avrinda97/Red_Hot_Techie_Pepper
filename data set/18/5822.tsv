2008-08-18T00:27:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	copy/paste doesn't work? :)
2008-08-18T00:27:00.000Z	Yahoo__	therealnanotube	you kidding now? :)
2008-08-18T00:27:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	indeed :) so you want to automatically push the info to some website?
2008-08-18T00:28:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	that would involve writing a custom shell/python/perl script (unless one already exists)
2008-08-18T00:28:00.000Z	Yahoo__	therealnanotube	so there are no programs with that function?
2008-08-18T00:29:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	don't know of any... but really, it will be just a one-line shell script, so i doubt any "programs" would already exist.
2008-08-18T00:29:00.000Z	Yahoo__	therealnanotube	but thats not enough for me :) i want web monitoring :) real web monitoring like "big" programs
2008-08-18T00:30:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	so, describe what exactly you want? does taking mdadm output, and pushing it out to a website, with like, updates every minute, do what you need to do?
2008-08-18T00:32:00.000Z	Yahoo__	therealnanotube	yess exactly
2008-08-18T00:32:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	so, that's still a one-line shell script, that you just put into a cron job :)
2008-08-18T00:32:00.000Z	Yahoo__	therealnanotube	but i don't know shell scripting :(
2008-08-18T00:33:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	well, if you tell me where you want the mdadm output published, i can make a shellscript for you. (basically, it will do "mdadm > /path/to/your/webpage", nothing more...)
2008-08-18T00:34:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	but in the long run, you'd do well to learn some shell :) it's easy, there's lots of tutorials on it and all.
2008-08-18T00:34:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Yahoo__	i'm off to lunch. bbl.
2008-08-18T00:34:00.000Z	Yahoo__	therealnanotube	i mean /cat/proc/mdstat > html file
