2006-09-15T16:48:00.000Z	eugman		What's a good perl ide
2006-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	eugman		Ok, is there a way to roll back to a previous kernel? The most recent update broke nvidia. I did a reconfig and the nv drivers work but the nvidia drivers don't seem to.
2006-09-15T06:18:00.000Z	eugman		A way preferably that can be done from the command line.

2006-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	eugman		whoops
2006-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	eugman		Though I had went to #ubuntu-unregged
2006-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	did you upgrade both the kernel and the driver?
2006-09-15T06:20:00.000Z	eugman	JoseStefan	the update manager only listed the kernel.
2006-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	are you using the nvidia driver, or the xorg nv driver?
2006-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	eugman	JoseStefan	Nvidia. Nv works witht he kernel although it looks a little off.
2006-09-15T06:22:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	put the results of this on the pastebin: apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
2006-09-15T06:23:00.000Z	eugman	JoseStefan	is there a way to do that from the command like or will I need to reconfig xserver to use the nv drivers?
2006-09-15T06:24:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	the output is not long, you can just type the version # for me, instead of paste
2006-09-15T06:26:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	ok, i have 1.0.8762+2.6.15.11-4 dapper
2006-09-15T06:27:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	you might want to try the update
2006-09-15T06:27:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	afaik you have 'yesterdays' version
2006-09-15T06:28:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	check this too: apt-cache policy linux-image-$(uname -r)
2006-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eugman	ctrl+alt+del
