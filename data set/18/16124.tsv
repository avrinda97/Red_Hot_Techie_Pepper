2005-01-11T06:54:00.000Z	ftwig		have alsa-tools but cant find alsaconfig, am I missing something?
2005-01-11T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	'alsaconf' is in the 'alsa-utils' package
2005-01-11T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	and if you have a pci/usb sound device, it's not necessary
2005-01-11T06:57:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	not with regards to sound in current hoary, no
2005-01-11T06:57:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	why?
2005-01-11T06:59:00.000Z	ftwig	crimsun	cos I have alsa-utils, have done updatedb and locate alsaconfig returns nothing ;(
2005-01-11T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	I don't think you read what I typed
2005-01-11T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	note how there is no "alsaconfig"
2005-01-11T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	there is only an "alsaconf"
2005-01-11T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	[crimsun@opeth ~] % dlocate alsaconf
2005-01-11T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	sudo apt-get --reinstall install alsa-utils
2005-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	ftwig	crimsun	ta - giving the reinstall a go - BTW what is dlocate?
2005-01-11T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	apt-cache show dlocate
2005-01-11T07:10:00.000Z	ftwig	crimsun	ta - still not got alsaconfig but dont think I need it as I have a PCI soundcard - went back and read previous stuff you said.  Sorry for being a plonker ;)
2005-01-11T07:12:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	Debian/Ubuntu does not ship an alsaconfig.
2005-01-11T07:12:00.000Z	crimsun	ftwig	it ships an alsaconf in the 'alsa-utils' package.
2005-01-11T07:13:00.000Z	ftwig	crimsun	ok - I think it was demudi I was using it with - pitty ubuntu douse not have a low latency kernel - its on my todo list.
2005-01-11T07:14:00.000Z	ftwig	crimsun	- sorry, I ment alsaconf
