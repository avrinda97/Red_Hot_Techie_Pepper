2009-10-16T07:03:00.000Z	tsukiyomi		this is it http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html
2009-10-16T07:03:00.000Z	tsukiyomi		i have kernel 2.6.26.x so

2009-10-16T07:04:00.000Z	tsukiyomi		thnxs
2009-10-16T07:04:00.000Z	coz_	tsukiyomi	  first...did you read the  README_AND_ISTALL file to see if your camera is suppoerted with this driver?
2009-10-16T07:05:00.000Z	tsukiyomi		yes i did, and it is
2009-10-16T07:05:00.000Z	coz_	tsukiyomi	 ok hold on
2009-10-16T07:06:00.000Z	tsukiyomi		when i compile i get the same error here look, http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2501109&group_id=28498&atid=393547
2009-10-16T07:08:00.000Z	coz_	tsukiyomi	 ok this is not compiling here either ...there is  a dependecy missing  but also you may have to contact the developer on this one and tell him exactly the errors   you get in the terminal
2009-10-16T07:09:00.000Z	tsukiyomi		bummr i see, some other people got the same error and were able to fix it by installing a old kernel version, what do you think?
2009-10-16T07:11:00.000Z	coz_	tsukiyomi	 that is certainly one options  but  i would suggest contacting the developer  and letting him know...he will answer and I believe there is an email address for him in that README file
2009-10-16T07:12:00.000Z	coz_	tsukiyomi	  dont hesitate to contact a developer especially when they offer their email address
2009-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	tsukiyomi	coz_	thank you very much i will contact the developer, hoping to get a response from him soon
2009-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	coz_	tsukiyomi	 good   also let me know if he gives you a solution :)
