2006-07-25T08:09:00.000Z	avis		i'm sorry.  i have to do something against the rules and offtopic just to celebrate ubuntu with you.  i'm poping my dual core 3.2 preston in my linux box tomorrow and putting my Celeron D 2.8 in my windows box.
2006-07-25T08:10:00.000Z	tritium	avis	nothing to apologize for ;)
2008-07-06T11:45:00.000Z	tritium	avis	no worries
2009-01-16T01:43:00.000Z	tritium	avis	sudo uses your user's password
2009-01-16T01:44:00.000Z	avis	tritium	i know that buy synaptic package manager wont accept my sudo password
2009-01-16T01:44:00.000Z	tritium	avis	there is no "sudo password".  Again, it is your *user's* password.
2009-01-16T01:45:00.000Z	avis	tritium	thanks for clearing that up.  now, any idea on how to get synapic to accept my *user* password ?
2009-01-16T01:45:00.000Z	tritium	avis	are you able to run any commands with sudo?
2009-01-16T01:50:00.000Z	tritium	avis	I asked you if you could run any commands with sudo...
2009-01-16T01:50:00.000Z	avis	tritium	yes i sure can from command line
2009-01-16T01:51:00.000Z	tritium	avis	then there should be no reason you can't run synaptic
2009-01-16T01:52:00.000Z	avis	tritium	well, synaptic isn't accepting my users password (which is the same i use to execute a sudo) i've typed it over and over to make sure i got it right.  there has to be a file that saves the password for that, thats different from my user password
2009-01-16T01:52:00.000Z	tritium	avis	there's not
2009-01-16T01:53:00.000Z	avis	tritium	i will attempt to type my password correctly, one more time.
2009-01-16T01:54:00.000Z	avis	tritium	wrong.  its definitely rejecting the *correct* password :/  i'll ask around later maybe someone else will know.  i can adminster my system from the command line thats alright by me
2009-01-16T01:54:00.000Z	tritium	avis	no, not wrong.  There is *no* file that stores a separate password for synaptic.
2009-01-16T01:55:00.000Z	avis	tritium	ok.  understood.  well, irregardless of that fact, when my system wishes to update through a gui, i can't do anything about it
2009-01-16T01:56:00.000Z	tritium	avis	sorry to hear that.  That's puzzling.
