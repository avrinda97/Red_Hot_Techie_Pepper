2006-06-29T06:23:00.000Z	stefg		understanding the menu.lst and having a small service partition as the first one helps a lot...
2006-06-29T06:25:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	Fedora's GUI installer was probably the biggest help. It is pretty good
2006-07-10T05:03:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	That's just an executable :)
2006-09-05T13:02:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	welcome to the wonderful world of error free syntax :-)
2007-04-24T05:23:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	in case you do not use the provided boot line from grub: you need to pass the UUID of the root volume now, not the /dev no more
2007-04-24T05:24:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	Yeah, I already did on Edgy. It panics a short time after loading GDM
2007-04-24T05:25:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	heard that song before... Feisty isn't as well tested as we all wish it had been. Any log entries which might be useful?
2007-04-24T05:26:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	I tried looking about in dmesg but can't find what is going on just before the kernel panic, since it gets full of the new boot messages
2007-04-24T05:27:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	what kind of system is that? Do you have SATA or PATA-hd?
2007-04-24T05:27:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	SATA. Dapper didn't recognise it, but Edgy did.
2007-04-24T05:29:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	then you might be a "victim" of the libata experiments currently taking place in the so-called stable kernel... all i can tell is 'search the forums', i finally rolled my own kernel. Maybe someone else knows what's wrong
2007-04-24T05:30:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	OK, thanks anyway. Was just wondering if it was a known issue, and maybe whether installing from scratch would have the same problem
2007-04-24T05:31:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	the kernel has it's problems, so a reinstall won't fix it, i guess
2007-04-24T05:31:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	Well at least I won't go wiping my system for nothing now :)
2007-04-24T05:52:00.000Z	Warbo	stefg	Thanks for the help, I think I've found it reported in Launchpad and using irqpoll, noapic and nolapic on GRUB's kernel line apparently worked for some people so I'll give it a shot. Cheers
2007-05-01T15:00:00.000Z	stefg	Warbo	that's a frequently heard issue with feisty...
