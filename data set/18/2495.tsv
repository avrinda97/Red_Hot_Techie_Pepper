2010-05-03T15:21:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	*groan*
2010-05-03T15:22:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	Ok. Go to Applications and down to internet and there it is!
2010-05-03T15:27:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	can you run empathy? I bet there is a preference inside to show applet
2010-05-03T15:30:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	sorry to say. synaptic uninstall and reinstall
2010-05-03T15:30:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	will give it a go
2010-05-03T15:38:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	returned
2010-05-03T15:38:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	it was worth every penny you paid us
2010-05-03T15:38:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	still have the issue
2010-05-03T15:39:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	so u r going to make me open it to try to help you
2010-05-03T15:39:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	open it?
2010-05-03T15:41:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	I opened it and I can't find any setting either
2010-05-03T15:42:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	i think it is this QuitCount have emailed the author to find out how to remove it
2010-05-03T15:42:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	so you can't remove it from the bar?
2010-05-03T15:43:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	you can quit it from the menu but when you restart it is still there
2010-05-03T15:43:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	freckle	did you look in synaptic and remove it?
2010-05-03T15:44:00.000Z	freckle	Sam_Fisher	will try that
