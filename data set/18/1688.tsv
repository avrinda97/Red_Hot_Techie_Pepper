2010-12-24T22:52:00.000Z	muskie		I give up.
2010-12-24T22:52:00.000Z	SoMeNaMe	muskie	What's troubling you ?
2010-12-24T22:53:00.000Z	muskie	SoMeNaMe	been trying to Get a remote X connection to a system with a failed graphics card so I can resurrect a semi-failed RAID array.
2010-12-24T22:54:00.000Z	SoMeNaMe	muskie	And where exactly are you stuck ?
2010-12-24T22:55:00.000Z	muskie	SoMeNaMe	I can't get the vnc connection working
2010-12-24T22:55:00.000Z	muskie		ssh -x doesen't work either
2010-12-24T22:55:00.000Z	SoMeNaMe	muskie	You have the computers on a network ?
2010-12-24T22:55:00.000Z	muskie		yes,they're on a network
2010-12-24T22:56:00.000Z	SoMeNaMe	muskie	And VNC isn't working ? Which version of Ubuntu are you using ?
2010-12-24T22:57:00.000Z	muskie	SoMeNaMe	10.10.
2010-12-24T22:58:00.000Z	muskie	SoMeNaMe	I think it's cause I don't have access to .Xauthority
2010-12-24T22:59:00.000Z	muskie		Okay. fine. I can't get into an X.

2010-12-24T22:59:00.000Z	muskie	SoMeNaMe	Do you knwo much about mounting RAID arrays?
2010-12-24T23:00:00.000Z	SoMeNaMe	muskie	Not about mounting RAID arrays... Sorry !
