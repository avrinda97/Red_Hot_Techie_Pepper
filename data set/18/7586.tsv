2007-12-15T19:12:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: are you running Ubuntu 7.10? That has version of aMSN as part of the Universe repository
2007-12-15T19:12:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: 0.97 RC1 to be exact
2007-12-15T19:13:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	No. I run Dapper
2007-12-15T19:14:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: You can try the generic Linux installer which is on the aMSN site : http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/amsn/amsn-0.97RC1-1.tcl84.x86.package
2007-12-15T19:14:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: Or take the leap and go to 7.10.. it is worth it!
2007-12-15T19:15:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	nty. I'm waiting for the next LTS, so I can LTS->LTS. It seems more stable to me.
2007-12-15T19:16:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	how do I install it? D:
2007-12-15T19:18:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: Right click on the download and set the permissions to allow execute. Then double click and run in terminal.. Follow the prompts etc..
2007-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	wow, wtf. It's installing a lot of autopackage stuff and asking me for my pass
2007-12-15T19:22:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: Yeah. Maybe the 7.10 upgrade would be easier? :)
2007-12-15T19:22:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	Thank you for your patience. Installation of your package will now proceed.
2007-12-15T19:22:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	quiet D:<
2007-12-15T19:23:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: Hope it works for you. Where does it install it?
2007-12-15T19:23:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	well, it's pretty. Like a Windows installer :|
2007-12-15T19:24:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	yay! Thanks. It installed correctly. :3
2007-12-15T19:25:00.000Z	frownfrown	gopodge	and all I had to do was type amsn after it was doen.
2007-12-15T19:25:00.000Z	gopodge	frownfrown	: Hopefully it is the latest version.
