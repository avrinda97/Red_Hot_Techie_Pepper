2008-10-14T11:02:00.000Z	dhng		how do I restore my x server settings after it's borked when I upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu?
2008-10-14T11:03:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	did you back it up?
2008-10-14T11:03:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	I'm not sure, I just ran the upgrade program
2008-10-14T11:03:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	did you have a lot of custom configurations?
2008-10-14T11:03:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	I think it's backed up, I'm just not sure where
2008-10-14T11:03:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	I don't think so
2008-10-14T11:04:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	if you can find it, that would be best, else, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-10-14T11:04:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	where is the config file located?
2008-10-14T11:04:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-10-14T11:06:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	so do I just rename one of my backup files to xorg.conf?
2008-10-14T11:06:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	then restart the x server, yup
2008-10-14T11:13:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	thanks, x is fixed
2008-10-14T11:14:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	great, glad to help
2008-10-14T11:16:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	it was premature...x loads but gnome doesn't, so I'm stuck with  my desktop background and nothing else
2008-10-14T11:18:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	I'll be honest, I have to get up in 5.5hrs, I'm not going to be alert long enough to fix this- let me phone a friend
2008-10-14T11:22:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	nothing but message
2008-10-14T11:22:00.000Z	geremy	dhng	srry
2008-10-14T11:22:00.000Z	dhng	geremy	thanks anyways
