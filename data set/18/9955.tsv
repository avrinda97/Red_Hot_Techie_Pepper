2007-04-17T15:05:00.000Z	felixhummel		I want to scan for local WLANs from bash - what tool do I need? I tried kismet a while ago, but it's meant for sniffing, not for connecting...
2007-04-17T15:05:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	wireless-tools has everything
2007-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	well I use iwconfig for configuration, but how do I get a list of Essids?
2007-04-17T15:08:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	I am sorry its been a very long time and I didn't take notes, but I know you can - I know this doesn't count for much.
2007-04-17T15:09:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	iwlist scan
2007-04-17T15:09:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	thanks, I'll try
2007-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	the format is : iwlist "device" scan
2007-04-17T15:11:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	yes, but it did not work, though iwconfig works :/
2007-04-17T15:11:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	you might have to tweak it to get all networks to be sean
2007-04-17T15:12:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	ok, what is your device? rausb0
2007-04-17T15:12:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	eth1
2007-04-17T15:12:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	thanks very much
2007-04-17T15:12:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	so "iwscan eth1" scan gives nothing?
2007-04-17T15:14:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	I think that is the way to go.  I am serious, if you have the $.
2007-04-17T15:14:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	i thought maybe when already connected, it does not work, but it just works perfectly. thank you again :)
2007-04-17T15:14:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	Awesome
2007-04-17T15:14:00.000Z	felixhummel	yigal	what do you mean by "if you have the $"?
2007-04-17T15:15:00.000Z	yigal	felixhummel	now I go to bed
