2005-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 what is your videocard/cpu?
2005-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	ufk		AMD moblue sempron, and sec the computer is rebooting i don't remember the gfx card
2005-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	ufk		AMD Mobile sempron
2005-12-07T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 let me guess ati mobiltiey x200 or similer. :P
2005-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	ufk		HP Pavilion, yeah and it's some kind of an ati radeon card.
2005-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 theres a thread about them in the forums. Theres a few 'issues', for a start. check the x config, and either use the 'no hwacell' option , or set the 'radeon' driver to be 'vesa' (i think)
2005-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 i got a COmpaq V2311 and had to do some tweaking..
2005-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	ufk		k thanks i'll try that
2005-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 the actual ati drivers Did work however.. with 3d support.
2005-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 also check your clock.. if its running at x2 normal speed theres a grub/boot option needed to fix that.
2005-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	ufk	Dr_Willis	aahm.. how do i check that?
2005-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 its like 'nolsapci' or somthing similer. for the clock issue, or somthing.
2005-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 get X working first. :P the see if the clock flys by.
2005-12-07T11:25:00.000Z	ufk		err.. before the X problem, my system usually doesn't boot! it get stuch on starting hotplug subsystem
2005-12-07T11:25:00.000Z	ufk		stuch=stuck
2005-12-07T11:27:00.000Z	ufk		can i remove lvm?
2005-12-07T11:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ufk	 the 'noapic, noapci, nolapic, (or was it nolapci?) options may help there as well.
