2005-08-01T13:34:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		hi apollo2011
2005-08-01T13:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	tha_gamemaster	sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
2005-08-01T13:35:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	jasoncohen	thanks!
2005-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	jasoncohen	tha_gamemaster	adding extra repositories isn't enough. you need to install libdvdcss2 to decrypt commercial DVDs...though i don't understand why the package would be removed
2005-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	jasoncohen	for somereason i thought it installed it by default.
2005-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	jasoncohen	as a dependency
2005-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	jasoncohen	tha_gamemaster	no- it's not a dependency. it's in hoary-extras because it's not legal in the US
2005-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	jasoncohen	Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate
2005-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	jasoncohen	tha_gamemaster	you need to add hoary-extras
2005-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	jasoncohen		!multimedia repositories

2005-08-01T13:41:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	jasoncohen	i did all that, but i was missing the backports mirror, because when i installed it, it failed the first time
