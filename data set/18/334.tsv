2012-08-30T17:31:00.000Z	L0tt037		I am getting an error saying I need to update Flash plugin for browser for  while. Near as I can tell I have the latest. Also, it does not matter which browser I use, same error. My default browser is Firefox, but have Chrome and Empathy as well.
2012-08-30T17:32:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y        doesn't fix it ?  repos enabled ?
2012-08-30T17:34:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	sure you got a terminal, and you'll love it once you are used to it
2012-08-30T17:36:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	terminal open (just no gui, cmd-line ) ?
2012-08-30T17:40:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	please put nick when answering, maybe have a look at your repos ?
2012-08-30T17:41:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	sudo apt-get install pastebinit && pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-08-30T17:43:00.000Z	L0tt037	DasEi	I ran that last command you gave me, what do I do now?
2012-08-30T17:44:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	give resulting url from terminal here
2012-08-30T17:47:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	lsb_release -a, I assume it reveals oneiric ?
2012-08-30T17:48:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	I just wanted to make sure which distro you are running, lsb_release -a tells you
2012-08-30T17:49:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	gksu gedit  /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-08-30T17:51:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	see lines 45,46 in http://paste.ubuntu.com/1175886/ ?  scroll down your local file, and alter to deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu oneiric partner         btw...
2012-08-30T17:52:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	then save gedit, re-run update/grade
2012-08-30T17:52:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	so you remove the '#'  in front that two lines and put oneiric for maverick
2012-08-30T17:53:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	first get one thing done ..
2012-08-30T17:54:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	there are some issues on distro-uprgrades, mostly if not lts to lts, but that's another question, and procedures are- if so at all- similar
2012-08-30T17:56:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	you mostly get in trouble by third paty repos or ppas, not ubuntu's default, and your partner wasn't enabled at all
2012-08-30T18:00:00.000Z	DasEi	L0tt037	update now working ?
