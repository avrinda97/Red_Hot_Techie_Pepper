2006-09-03T09:05:00.000Z	Ademan		all of the sudden i can't ssh (through GNOME/Nautilus) into my webserver, but i can do it through the console...
2006-09-03T09:05:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Are you sure your links to the ssh file, have not changed - or been wiped, since the last time you started the program?
2006-09-03T09:06:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	links? either way i tried redoing the connection through "Connect to Server" from the places menu
2006-09-03T09:06:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Yes, you usually need to tell the program where SSH is - /usr/bin/ssh etc - in the options somewhere
2006-09-03T09:07:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	well i don't know how it would have been changed
2006-09-03T09:07:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	It could if you did not apply changes, anyways - double check your programs options - see if there is not an option that is without arguments to the SSH exec.
2006-09-03T09:08:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	what program? i'm just using nautilus' network transparency
2006-09-03T09:08:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Nautilus, is a program...
2006-09-03T09:08:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	i realize that, but how would i have changed the config for it?
2006-09-03T09:09:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	but it was working before...
2006-09-03T09:09:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Ok well, if you do not check your options - you are still no closer to having it work with SSH again.
2006-09-03T09:09:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	where do i check nautilus options?
2006-09-03T09:10:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Usually - file - options, preferences - edit-> preferences etc ... if all else fails read the manual that came with Nautilus.
2006-09-03T09:11:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	there's no option in edit-> preferences dialog
2006-09-03T09:12:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Well then best read the manual, or FAQ - SSH has to be somewhere ----> Google, Nautilius SSH
2006-09-03T09:14:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Simple, you need to usually set up Apache config - to link with your PHP interpreter, and then add your scripts to /htdocs or whatever directory you told Apache to hold your HTML in - and away you go, you need to follow the script instructions after that
2006-09-03T09:16:00.000Z	Ademan	justin_	the default folder is /var/www
2006-09-03T09:16:00.000Z	justin_	Ademan	Yeah whatever it is
