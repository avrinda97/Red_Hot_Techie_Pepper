2009-11-09T10:00:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	i tried to check, but its over my head
2009-11-09T10:01:00.000Z	russlar	sarthor	can you use a different one?
2009-11-09T10:01:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	yes but which one? i am not an expert
2009-11-09T10:02:00.000Z	russlar	sarthor	pick one close to you
2009-11-09T10:02:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	OK.
2009-11-09T10:02:00.000Z	russlar	sarthor	I;m in mass, so I usr the MIT repos
2009-11-09T10:03:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	now its says "W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com karmic-security Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG 40976EAF437D05B5 Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key <ftpmaster@ubuntu.com>"
2009-11-09T10:04:00.000Z	russlar	sarthor	open up software sources, and choose a different server
2009-11-09T10:04:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	OK.
2009-11-09T10:08:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	again error with 2 different servers, "W: GPG error: http://ubuntu.mirrors.isu.net.sa karmic-security Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG 40976EAF437D05B5 Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key <ftpmaster@ubuntu.com>"

2009-11-09T10:09:00.000Z	russlar	sarthor	and tell them you've seen it on multiple repos
2009-11-09T10:17:00.000Z	sarthor	russlar	i went to #ops, they said, its the correct place to get help about ubuntu, so they said, go to #ubuntu-ops, i went there, they said, go to #ubuntu, confused !!
