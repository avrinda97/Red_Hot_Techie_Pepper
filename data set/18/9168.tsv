2009-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	jabagawee		anyone know how rm works? i rm -rf'ed my data directory, and i have a feelign it's still recoverable
2009-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 rm just unlinks the files from the sfilesystem..  they may or ,may not be recoverable..
2009-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 if you are wanting to be paranoid theres secure deletion tools out there.
2009-07-29T05:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 'dd' can copy the mbr to a file and back.. yes.
2009-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 i find rm works rather well. :)  is tehre some specific problem you are having with it?
2009-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	lemme paste my situation again
2009-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 if you are worried about the order things get removed.. you could use 'find' and the options it has to remove things in a specific order.
2009-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 if this is about recovering things.. well.. no idea on that.. good luck undeleting things.
2009-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	the situation is that i already rm'ed some files... so i want to know what order rm does it in
2009-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 from what ive seen it does it aplhabetically   make some test dirs and watch the order perhaps?
2009-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	err... sure
2009-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	  check the timestamps on the things perhaps  to see when it was last modfied/
2009-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	thats a great suggestion. otoh, i might also need to do a bitta reading on the rm source code
2009-07-29T06:01:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	i'll be darned if google keeps telling me that "rm source code" refers to realmedia... no i do not want to know how realplayer handles streams, thank you
2009-07-29T06:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 check the apt package manager docs/guides therew a way to get them to download the soruce packages but ive never done so.. and i dont know what package 'rm' is in.
2009-07-29T06:02:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	most likely gnu coreutils
2009-12-25T05:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jabagawee	 you may want to check out the 'fsarchiver' tool. (but its not in the repos yet)
2009-12-25T05:49:00.000Z	jabagawee	Dr_Willis	good tip
