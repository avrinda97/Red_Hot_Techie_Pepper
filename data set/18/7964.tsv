2009-10-17T08:08:00.000Z	cody___		PROBLEM: Whenever i boot, i get the message that my home directory appears to be /home/cody, but it could not be found, do i want to use / instead? I click no, then it gives me the error: "Users $HOME/.dmrc file is ignored... It should be owned by the user and have 644 permisions. What is wrong?
2009-10-17T08:09:00.000Z	cody___		I am on LiveCD right now
2009-10-17T08:09:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	does /home/cody exist? Is user cody the owner?
2009-10-17T08:10:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	Both should be yes, i will mount the partition that has /home on it to see if something happened
2009-10-17T08:10:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	Yes, /home/cody exists.
2009-10-17T08:11:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	ls -l /home.  does cody own cody?
2009-10-17T08:11:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	Would that command still apply since i am on a live cd?
2009-10-17T08:11:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	dare I ask what you did to fstab/
2009-10-17T08:11:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	haha. I added /proc/bus/usb to it
2009-10-17T08:12:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	so remove it. Sounds like /home is not being mounted.
2009-10-17T08:12:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	Okay, how would i do so? I am on the liveCD
2009-10-17T08:13:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	mount the hard drive and edit the fstab.
2009-10-17T08:13:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	I will be allowed to without being sudo?
2009-10-17T08:13:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	you can sudo from the livecd
2009-10-17T08:14:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	I found out what happened!!! For some reason, when i had it add the line to fstab, it removed everything else
2009-10-17T08:15:00.000Z	joeb3_	cody___	if you don't have a backup, create it manually.  Use /etc/fstab on the livecd as a guide.
2009-10-17T08:15:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	Okay, cause i never expected that hehe I will c/p
2009-10-17T08:16:00.000Z	cody___	joeb3_	Uh oh... i remember mine being very different :(
