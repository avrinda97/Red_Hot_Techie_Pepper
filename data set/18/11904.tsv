2007-03-19T07:15:00.000Z	BlackDalek		Software update won't work. It says there are too many errors. How do I clear out the corrupted updates which downloaded, so that I can download them again?
2007-03-19T07:15:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade does what
2007-03-19T07:17:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	do things in the terminal
2007-03-19T07:17:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade in the terminal and if you get an error message paste it, if it is very long pastebin it
2007-03-19T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	try sudo apt-get remove tar
2007-03-19T07:25:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bruenig	that tells me I am about to do something potentially harmful.... shall I proceed?
2007-03-19T07:25:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	pastebin what it says
2007-03-19T07:26:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bruenig	it tells me this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10987/ - should I proceed?
2007-03-19T07:27:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	I would go for it, so long as you reinstall tar later, all will be fine
2007-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bruenig	it didn't work anyway.
2007-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	keep on pastebinning
2007-03-19T07:29:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bruenig	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10988/ is the result
2007-03-19T07:29:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	there is something wrong with openoffice.org-common
2007-03-19T07:30:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	if it was my system I would sudo apt-get remove that
2007-03-19T07:34:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bruenig	i tried sudo apt-get remove openoffice.org-common ...I still get the error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10988/
2007-03-19T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop tar openoffice.org-common
2007-03-19T07:39:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bruenig	none of this is working.. isn't there some way I can just delete all this crap and re-download it? I am beginning to think it might just be easier to format and re-install from scratch since this is a clean install off a CD, and there is nothing on the hard drive I need to keep :(
2007-03-19T07:39:00.000Z	bruenig	BlackDalek	well fresh install then
