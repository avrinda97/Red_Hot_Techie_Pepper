2010-01-11T03:12:00.000Z	fatih		i have ubuntu 9.10 and lm_sensors 3.1 installed. when i do the command pwmconfig
2010-01-11T03:12:00.000Z	fatih		there is the error "There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed"
2010-01-11T03:14:00.000Z	fatih		the program lm_sensors 3.1 works, it finds my sensors, tells the voltages and fan speed, but the command "pwmconfig" does not work. it comes the error "There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed"

2010-01-11T03:16:00.000Z	fatih		i dont know what you mean with modules. 4pin?! in windows the fans where regulatet by the temp!
2010-01-11T03:17:00.000Z	fatih		sry, but i have just installed ubuntu. i would really love it, if my cpu fan would not be so fuckin loud
2010-01-11T03:18:00.000Z	the_real_dave	fatih	try pwmconfig, google it, there's a howto on controlling fan speed. Then again, high fan speed could be due to a hardware cause, like poor cooling
2010-01-11T03:20:00.000Z	the_real_dave	fatih	are you getting those temps using lm-sensors? :S
2010-01-11T03:21:00.000Z	the_real_dave	fatih	what does it return? Sorry if I missed it earlier
2010-01-11T03:24:00.000Z	the_real_dave	fatih	cat  /etc/modules should show the module used by lm-sensors
2010-01-11T03:26:00.000Z	fatih	the_real_dave	he says # Generated by sensors-detect on Sun Jan 10 18:10:52 2010
2010-01-11T03:27:00.000Z	the_real_dave	fatih	try reducing that to just one time and rebooting, though I don't think that will help TBH
2010-01-11T03:27:00.000Z	fatih	the_real_dave	how can i reduce that?
2010-01-11T03:29:00.000Z	fatih	the_real_dave	ok, i have reduced it to one. now i reboot.
2010-01-11T03:35:00.000Z	the_real_dave	fatih	no didn't really think it would :( Sorry mate, but you need to find the right modules, must be controlled by a different one or something. Heavy Googling I'd say
