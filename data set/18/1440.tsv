2011-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	randomnoob		why is it that when i plug in my headphones i can't hear any audio, but my loudspeakers work perfectly fine?
2011-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	check mixer
2011-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	there are no controls specific to the headphones
2011-02-19T18:47:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	is it a laptop?
2011-02-19T18:47:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	yep
2011-02-19T18:48:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	then Senjai has a point. My laptop's speakers shut off automagically when the jack goes in
2011-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	how may 1/4 inch jacks you got?
2011-02-19T18:52:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	hmm?
2011-02-19T18:52:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	how many input jacks are there on the laptop
2011-02-19T18:53:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	for instance, my line out never works, so I must use the other out line
2011-02-19T18:53:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	two, one for headphones and one for the mic
2011-02-19T18:54:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	hda intel idt

2011-02-19T18:57:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	thanks
2011-02-19T18:57:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	looks like there's a workaround involving getting the latest alsa driver
2011-02-19T18:57:00.000Z	blkdg	randomnoob	it's about half way down the pafe
2011-02-19T18:59:00.000Z	randomnoob	blkdg	probably wouldn't work, ubuntu comes with an even higher version of alsa and it still doesn't work
