2006-08-13T13:55:00.000Z	jeeaar		ok, ive got a file: "ventrilo_srv", on my desktop, and id like to execute it, but I dont know what to put into my terminal, i r noob
2006-08-13T13:55:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	cd to /home/<username>/Desktop, then type ./ventrilo_srv, and hit returm
2006-08-13T13:56:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	Change Directory
2006-08-13T13:56:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	It's a command
2006-08-13T13:57:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	No, but it makes more sense. If it creates any extra files, it usually drops them in the working directory if the location isn't explicitly set
2006-08-13T14:02:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	Server or client?
2006-08-13T14:03:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	ps -A | grep ventrilo
2006-08-13T14:03:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	That'll let you know if it's running or not
2006-08-13T14:06:00.000Z	jeeaar	DarkElf109	im getting "28650 pts/0    00:00:00 ventrilo_srv
2006-08-13T14:08:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	That means that it's running
2006-08-13T14:09:00.000Z	jeeaar	DarkElf109	Does being behind a router mean i need to set permissions in the router settings?
2006-08-13T14:10:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	No idea. Never ran a ventrilo server
2006-08-13T14:48:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	Environment?
2006-08-13T14:49:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	Wine, if you want to run it semi-natively
2006-08-13T14:50:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	If you want to emulate a full Windows install, there's qemu, or, if you want to pay, VMWare
2006-08-13T14:51:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	You *can* do it, but it's hard. Better off with Cedega
2006-08-13T14:52:00.000Z	DarkElf109	jeeaar	Cedega is a fork of Wine that's been modified for better game support
2006-08-13T15:14:00.000Z	jeeaar	DarkElf109	sorry, i should stop using you as my personal google :S
