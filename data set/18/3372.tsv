2009-10-31T23:04:00.000Z	mikeru		HELLO????
2009-10-31T23:05:00.000Z	mikeru		    ?
2009-10-31T23:05:00.000Z	julianoliver	mikeru	tell us the problem
2009-10-31T23:05:00.000Z	mikeru		      ?
2009-10-31T23:05:00.000Z	mikeru		I've already askedx
2009-10-31T23:06:00.000Z	mikeru		every once in a while, when a sound... sounds, if there was more than about a minute without doing any sound, it does a weird buzz...
2009-10-31T23:06:00.000Z	mikeru		particularily, with alert sounds. like  if I backspace on an empty line in Xchat, it does an alert sound and that weird buzz/noise sounds. If I continue doing so, it won't. But if I wait another minute, it does so again.
2009-10-31T23:07:00.000Z	julianoliver	mikeru	that's a strange problem. is this on 9.10?
2009-10-31T23:07:00.000Z	mikeru		yes, 9.10
2009-10-31T23:08:00.000Z	julianoliver	mikeru	it looks a little like this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-alsamixer/+bug/454224
2009-10-31T23:09:00.000Z	julianoliver	mikeru	you could try disabling Pulse Audio.
2009-10-31T23:09:00.000Z	mikeru	julianoliver	well...not really. It happens when there hasn't been audio output for about aminute, and then there is audio output again
2009-10-31T23:10:00.000Z	mikeru	julianoliver	 I wouldn't...  >_>
2009-10-31T23:10:00.000Z	julianoliver	mikeru	it's very odd. i can't see any bug that matches this issue
2009-10-31T23:10:00.000Z	mikeru		:S
2009-10-31T23:10:00.000Z	mikeru	julianoliver	 should I record the sound?
2009-10-31T23:10:00.000Z	julianoliver	mikeru	try disabling Pulse Audio: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio
2009-10-31T23:11:00.000Z	mikeru	julianoliver	 it's because it's not really a buzz... I don't know how to describe it :P
