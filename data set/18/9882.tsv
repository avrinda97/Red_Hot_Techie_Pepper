2007-10-06T07:06:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	without having seen the video: compiz fusion
2007-10-06T07:06:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	hoping for something a bit more specific
2007-10-06T07:06:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	it is called shiftswitcher
2007-10-06T07:06:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	thx.
2007-10-06T07:07:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	you can change between to different types of switching. one looks like the vista thingy
2007-10-06T07:08:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	does it come w/ compizfusion?
2007-10-06T07:08:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	you may need the comiz plugins
2007-10-06T07:09:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	but on my gutsy it comes with it, yes
2007-10-06T07:09:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	you need to configure it with compiz config settings manager. did you install that?
2007-10-06T07:09:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	I am installing the 'unofficial' plugins
2007-10-06T07:10:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	sweet! got it thx.
2007-10-06T07:11:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	It does the 'cover' and 'vista' style alt tab display.. but doesnt makle the windows kinda walk in front of eachother though
2007-10-06T07:12:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	sorry, i didn't watch the video you posted
2007-10-06T07:12:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	when they alt-tab, the focus window moves to the left and the unfocused app moves to the right, and then focus changes..
2007-10-06T07:12:00.000Z	myconid	dennda	as you might expect 'alt-tab' to work with REAL people...
2007-10-06T07:13:00.000Z	dennda	myconid	ring switcher? dunno if i got you right
