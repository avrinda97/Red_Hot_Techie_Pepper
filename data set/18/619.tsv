2011-11-30T05:01:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	It appears you already have telnet running. That would be the reason it can't bind.

2011-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	yaboo	Scott_S	ok seems I am already on, but cannot telnet another session
2011-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	yaboo	Scott_S	can I stop the telnet session to rebind?
2011-11-30T05:03:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	What reason do you have to rebind it? If it's already running, you should already be able to connect.
2011-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	yaboo	Scott_S	getting connection refused
2011-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	That's odd. Do you remember installing a telnet server before? Or did you specify it when you install the server?
2011-11-30T05:06:00.000Z	yaboo	Scott_S	yes using xinetd
2011-11-30T05:07:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	xinetd isn't the only server you have installed it seems.
2011-11-30T05:08:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	Do you have a telnet client running at the moment?
2011-11-30T05:08:00.000Z	yaboo	Scott_S	yes I do
2011-11-30T05:08:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	Close the client and restart the server.
2011-11-30T05:11:00.000Z	yaboo	Scott_S	I did this and no go
2011-11-30T05:12:00.000Z	Scott_S	yaboo	I'm at the end of my rope then, I'm unsure as to why it's unable to bind unless you already have a server running. You have to stop the other server before you can start the one you want to use.
