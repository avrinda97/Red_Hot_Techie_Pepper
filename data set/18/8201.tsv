2007-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	jvm123	xorg 4.3 doesn't exist
2007-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	jvm123	xorg is currently on release 7.X
2007-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	sorry.
2007-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	s/4.1/7.1/
2007-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	s/4.3/7.3/
2007-12-23T22:28:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	the ubuntu 7.10 configuration tool recognizes both monitors, but does not allow to use both of them at the same time. i can only choose between "default screen" and "disabled".
2007-12-23T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	jvm123	what video card do you have
2007-12-23T22:28:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	when i choose default screen both monitors display the same image.
2007-12-23T22:28:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	ati radeon something
2007-12-23T22:28:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	wait a second
2007-12-23T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jvm123	thats where my knowledge ends, ati isnot my thing
2007-12-23T22:29:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	thank you...
2007-12-23T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jvm123	you'll be better trying to use the ati dual head config options
2007-12-23T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jvm123	called something like desktop clone
2007-12-23T22:30:00.000Z	jvm123	ikonia	i wrote the xorg.conf i use at the moment by myself, but i thought i would try this easy tool that comes with ubuntu :)
