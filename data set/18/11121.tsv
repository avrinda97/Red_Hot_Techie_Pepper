2012-10-14T17:44:00.000Z	sasuke		hi can anyone tell me how to use beep cmd
2012-10-14T17:45:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	what's not clear ?
2012-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	sasuke	ikonia	i installed beep package a few mins back.  I dont know how to use that cmd.
2012-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	man beep
2012-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	surly looking at how to use something before installing it seems wise
2012-10-14T17:49:00.000Z	sasuke	ikonia	thats where i am failing i know why we use use that but unable to use . i tried in man pages also. when i issue the cmd nothing happened. i didnt get beep sound
2012-10-14T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	what command are you using exactly ?
2012-10-14T17:58:00.000Z	sasuke	ikonia	i am using this cmd "cp -rv PDFS/* ~/Documents/stuff/| beep -f 1000 -r 5 -s " . Can you tell me should we need to configure any file to make a beep sound after completed the process
2012-10-14T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	get beep working first
2012-10-14T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	then include it in other command
2012-10-14T17:59:00.000Z	sasuke	ikonia	i didnt get it. my system sound is working fine & i use this cmd "sudo apt-get install beep" . After this i dont know what to do
2012-10-14T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	READ the man page, and get it to beep
2012-10-14T18:07:00.000Z	sasuke	ikonia	when i am using "beep" cmd i didnt get beep sound. So can i use this "chmod 4755 /usr/bin/beep"
2012-10-14T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	why are you doing that ?
2012-10-14T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	why are you chmodding the file ?
2012-10-14T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	what reason do you think this is due to file permissions ???
2012-10-14T18:08:00.000Z	sasuke	ikonia	i found that in man page. Its telling that when beep is not working try the above pasted cmd
2012-10-14T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	sasuke	I don't see that in the man page ?
