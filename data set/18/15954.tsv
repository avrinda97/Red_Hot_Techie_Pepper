2005-12-11T16:20:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	lock your laptop when you're away from it?
2005-12-11T16:21:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	why not? use an account with a four-character password just for gigs, it'd take seconds to unlock.
2005-12-11T16:21:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	and that way you wouldn't have the worry that if your connectivity died, you'd be musicless.
2005-12-11T16:22:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	well, since you're still doing it that way, I'd expect that. :-P
2005-12-11T16:22:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	it's quite an elegant way, but I wouldn't do it that way, personally.
2005-12-11T16:24:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	what *would* you do if the internet connection died?
2005-12-11T16:25:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	how, if you didn't have an internet connection?
2005-12-11T16:32:00.000Z	njan	DJGreen	they're completely different applications. :P
