2008-12-16T04:54:00.000Z	persona_khanu		hello!
2008-12-16T04:55:00.000Z	persona_khanu		i'm on a live cd so that i can access another local hard drive/partition that i didn't have permissions to access, but i still don't have permission!  i messed up the partitioner somehow so now i can't access files on the partition!
2008-12-16T04:57:00.000Z	persona_khanu		anyone able to help me with my permissions issue?
2008-12-16T04:57:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	if its a linux filesyetem, permissions still apply. maybe you need gksu nautlius
2008-12-16T04:58:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	they are, i can't connect to the partition with the correct ubuntu install so now i'm on a live disc trying to get at the files because i can see them but have no permissions
2008-12-16T04:58:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	did you use sudo/ gksu? to make the access as root?
2008-12-16T04:59:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	i didn't, is that just the command? 'sudo gksu'?
2008-12-16T04:59:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	no. how do you work. console or nautlius?
2008-12-16T05:00:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	console
2008-12-16T05:00:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	then #  sudo ls /media/disk/
2008-12-16T05:00:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	right now on the livecd however i'm using nautlius
2008-12-16T05:01:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	to get a "root" nautilus you can use alt+f2 -> "gksu nautlius"  but don't make that a regular habit :-)
2008-12-16T05:03:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	still not able to get there, 'gksu nautlius' didn't seem to have any effect
2008-12-16T05:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	ok, if you try that in a terminal, do you get an error? maybe its gksudo
2008-12-16T05:05:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	nice, the command line worked, i ended up just typing 'sudo su' heh
2008-12-16T05:05:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	persona_khanu	that's "sudo -i" ;-)
2008-12-16T05:06:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	heh, i'll fix that, also 'gksudo nautilus' works, only one i ;)
2008-12-16T05:06:00.000Z	persona_khanu	zsquareplusc	thanks
