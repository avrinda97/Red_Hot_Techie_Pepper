2008-01-31T08:31:00.000Z	Jewsus		A website says an applet is supposed to pop-up in another window, but it isn't working in firefox
2008-01-31T08:32:00.000Z	Jewsus		but it doesn't show the pop-up blocker thing
2008-01-31T08:32:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	do you see a lightbulb on the bottom right hand side of the window?
2008-01-31T08:32:00.000Z	Jewsus	CITguy	non
2008-01-31T08:33:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	what version of Ubuntu and Firefox are you using?
2008-01-31T08:35:00.000Z	Jewsus	CITguy	I'm using ubuntu 7.10 gutsy, and firefox version 2.0.0.11
2008-01-31T08:35:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	ok, gimme a sec
2008-01-31T08:36:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	does the applet work fine otherwise?
2008-01-31T08:37:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	do you have javascript enabled?
2008-01-31T08:37:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	could you post the link so I can try?
2008-01-31T08:39:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	It's not working for me either. I suspect the applet isn't working properly.
2008-01-31T08:40:00.000Z	Jewsus	CITguy	I remember the applet used to work fine when I was running windows
2008-01-31T08:40:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	so it's worked in windows but not in Ubuntu?
2008-01-31T08:40:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	were you using firefox with windows?
2008-01-31T08:40:00.000Z	Jewsus	CITguy	yes, I think so
2008-01-31T08:42:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	I'm sorry, from all of the information I'm getting, it seems to be a problem with the way the applet is coded.
2008-01-31T08:42:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	I would contact the developer to see if they have a solution.
2008-01-31T08:43:00.000Z	CITguy	Jewsus	For what it's worth, you're welcome.
