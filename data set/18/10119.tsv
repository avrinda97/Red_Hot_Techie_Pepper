2007-12-19T11:06:00.000Z	twiztr		Hey, what program is the little calender that pops up when you click the date link too?
2007-12-19T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	that's the clock applet
2007-12-19T11:08:00.000Z	twiztr	nickrud	I mean, I know when you click on it, and see the calender, it can show you all the appointments you have made, but I don't know what program you have to save the appointments in.
2007-12-19T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	oh, that's saved in evolution, the mail/calender app
2007-12-24T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	 do you see a grub menu when you boot?
2007-12-24T11:28:00.000Z	twiztr	nickrud	Yea, but it only give me access to mint.
2007-12-24T11:28:00.000Z	twiztr	nickrud	Win doesnt even show up on the list
2007-12-24T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	ok, what partition is your windows on?
2007-12-24T11:29:00.000Z	twiztr	nickrud	the second drive
2007-12-24T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	and the partition of the second drive?
2007-12-24T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	no, that's the drive; like sdb1 or sdb2 ,   sudo fdisk -l  should give you an idea
2007-12-24T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	ah, only partition, missed that
2007-12-24T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	add the stanza in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49460/  to the very end of /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-12-24T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	keep that reference, you might need it
2008-03-01T04:35:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	try editing /etc/usplash.conf to a res your monitor knows
2008-03-01T04:34:00.000Z	nickrud	twiztr	but at some point you get a usable display in X?
2008-03-01T04:34:00.000Z	twiztr	nickrud	It works fine, as soon as it boots the GUI.
2008-03-01T04:36:00.000Z	twiztr	nickrud	Thanks, that should work. It's set to 12something by 1024, and my LCD wont work with anything bigger then 1024x800 or w/e.
