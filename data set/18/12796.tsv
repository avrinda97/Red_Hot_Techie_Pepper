2008-07-09T03:40:00.000Z	mynetdude		anybody know of a free app similar to cpu-z/cpuid for windows for linux?
2008-07-09T03:40:00.000Z	mynetdude		cpu-z only works for windows :(
2008-07-09T03:40:00.000Z	mynetdude		huh cat what???
2008-07-09T03:41:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 in terminal -> cat /proc/cpuinfo
2008-07-09T03:41:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 /proc/ has all sorts of neat files with system info in them
2008-07-09T03:43:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 cat just prints a text file to the shell...
2008-07-09T03:43:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 In theory you could make some ap that just shows the output of /proc/cpuinfo it  a special file that appears  to be a read only text file.
2008-07-09T03:44:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 theres other neat info files in /proc also.
2008-07-09T03:45:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 go there and look. :) be carefull wha tothe rfiles you 'cat' from /proc/ theres one or 2 files that are like all the systemememory. that can  print gibberish to the screen
2008-07-09T03:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 cat /proc/cmdline  -> shows what options the kernel was booted with..  each process has a diretory in /proc/ google for /proc/ theres bound to be a lot of neat guides that detail the stuff
2008-07-09T03:47:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 vmcore is one i dont think ya want to cat.  but a user cant do that anyway. :)
2008-07-09T03:48:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 the command line is the heart of linux. :)
2008-07-09T03:49:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 with that logic we would all still be using DOS.... :P
2008-07-09T03:50:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 I was into CP/M :) back then.. heh..
2008-07-09T03:50:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 heh  -  an early OS, ran on Z80 cpu's
2008-07-09T03:53:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 not needed it for years. I tend to collect emulators of old pc/systems. I got a Timex Sinclare hanging on the wall, a vic20 and C64 in the garrage  and some amigas laying about.
2008-07-09T03:53:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 for a laugh check out http://goosh.org/
2008-07-09T03:56:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mynetdude	 yea its fun to play with.
