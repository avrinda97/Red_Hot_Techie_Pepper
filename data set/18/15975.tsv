2010-02-07T16:36:00.000Z	Seveas	rea	does /usr/local/bin/python2.6 exist? And why are you installing python manually into /usr/local anyway?
2010-02-07T16:37:00.000Z	rea	Seveas	not bad, python 2.6 doesn't existe
2010-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	Seveas	rea	sure it does.
2010-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	Seveas	rea	which version of Ubuntu are you on?
2010-02-07T16:40:00.000Z	Seveas	rea	so don't bother with installing python manually. Remove all python related things from /usr/local and you can use the system python :)
2010-02-07T16:41:00.000Z	rea	Seveas	what it will be the command ?
2010-02-07T16:41:00.000Z	rea	Seveas	the problem was that  i wanted to change de defaut version of python 2.4 => 2.6
