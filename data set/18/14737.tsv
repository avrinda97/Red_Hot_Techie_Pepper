2005-06-21T07:08:00.000Z	Razor-X		i'm assuming you downloaded this off the internet, and saved it in your home director, cookiemonstergri?
2005-06-21T07:09:00.000Z	Razor-X		the FPS I get on a FPS is about.... 50
2005-06-21T07:11:00.000Z	Razor-X		I don't expect much from this, actually, it's an  old-ass card
2005-06-21T07:11:00.000Z	Razor-X		hmmm, what's the LaTeX way of putting a title text smack dab in the middle of the page? you just draw the title then add a page break, or something?
2005-06-21T07:11:00.000Z	ChrisCF	Razor-X	\title ?
2005-06-21T07:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	will try
2005-06-21T07:14:00.000Z	ChrisCF	Razor-X	Try The not-so-short introduction (lshort.pdf), a decent book, or use LyX
2005-06-21T07:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	I'm using the former, right now
2005-06-22T13:27:00.000Z	ChrisCF	Razor-X	And then there's the "F" distribution
2005-06-22T13:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	you mean.... Fresh Distribution?! ;)
2005-06-24T09:31:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	it belongs where Caps Lock is
2005-06-24T09:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	it was there originally
2005-06-24T09:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	can you tell me why some of the most useless keys ever are on your home row?
2005-06-24T09:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	oh yes they can
2005-06-24T09:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	my home row on the other hand is A O E U
2005-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	ChrisCF	Razor-X	but then that means you can't type "asdf" so quickly :o)
2005-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	one hand has all the vowels on the home row, the other hand has the most used consonants and consonant pairs
2005-06-24T09:37:00.000Z	Razor-X	ChrisCF	odd the double-standard there, Linux is adjustable but Dvorak is not ;)
