2009-08-29T05:22:00.000Z	ironfroggy_		if I do `dd if=/dev/sdb of=backup.img` where /dev/sdb is a 120GB usb disk, why might dd say it completed copying only 2.2meg?
2009-08-29T05:22:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	make sure your block size is correct.
2009-08-29T05:23:00.000Z	ironfroggy_	MindVirus	how do i know that?
2009-08-29T05:23:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	I'm guessing /dev/sdb is a CD, right?
2009-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	there are probably filesystem corruptions.
2009-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	try to fsck.
2009-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	ironfroggy_	MindVirus	fsck frightens me when it asks lots of questions.
2009-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	me too. You get over it, though. :)
2009-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	I'm happy I can finally help you after you helping me so many times in #python.
2009-08-29T05:25:00.000Z	ironfroggy_	MindVirus	it asks me to start overwriting blocks starting at block 10
2009-08-29T05:25:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	extreme data corruption.
2009-08-29T05:26:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	I'm fairly certain your drive's busted.
2009-08-29T05:26:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	please tell me if this is not the case so I can keep trying to help.
2009-08-29T05:26:00.000Z	ironfroggy_	MindVirus	ill try a few more things and come back if i can continue
2009-08-29T05:32:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	the drive was dead?
2009-08-29T05:33:00.000Z	ironfroggy_	MindVirus	no matter the case i felt it best to get a copy of the image before touching the drive any further. if its any mechanical issues i dont want to risk something failing permanently before i get the raw image off
2009-08-29T05:33:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	yes, good call.
2009-08-29T05:34:00.000Z	MindVirus	ironfroggy_	how many do you need to copy?
