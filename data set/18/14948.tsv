2006-01-03T15:34:00.000Z	Epix		im mad.
2006-01-03T15:35:00.000Z	Epix		gparted does its thing, no errors until "Some changes were made to busy devices" comes up... THE DEVICE WAS NOT BUSY! Then, I click OK, everything reloads and voila, nothing has changed!
2006-01-03T15:35:00.000Z	cmatheson	Epix	you need to reboot after you mess w/ your partition tables
2006-01-03T15:37:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	it better work :P... /me reboots.
2006-01-03T15:43:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	im logging in...
2006-01-03T15:44:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	fook. no resize...
2006-01-03T15:45:00.000Z	cmatheson	Epix	just boot off the install cd and use parted from the command-line probably (or you could just do it now... 'umount -o remount,ro / && parted /dev/whatever'
2006-01-03T15:47:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	i tried qtparted, no dice. and parted would not load up my device.
2006-01-03T15:47:00.000Z	cmatheson	Epix	why won't parted load up your device?
2006-01-03T15:47:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	grr, i forget the error.
2006-01-03T15:48:00.000Z	cmatheson	Epix	maybe you should try it again?
2006-01-03T15:50:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	ill reboot onto live. one sec
2006-01-03T15:51:00.000Z	cmatheson	Epix	you don't even need to reboot if you mount it read-only
2006-01-03T15:51:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	no, ill reboot.
2006-01-03T15:51:00.000Z	cmatheson	Epix	ok
2006-01-03T15:54:00.000Z	Epix	cmatheson	ok, it is saying that the BIOS gemoetry might have been detected incorreectly
