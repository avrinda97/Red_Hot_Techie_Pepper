2004-10-27T09:19:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	you may have to add yourself to group audio
2004-10-27T09:19:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	if the devices are in /dev
2004-10-27T09:20:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	what about /dev/dsp ?
2004-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	ls -l /dev/{dsp,audio,mixer}
2004-10-27T09:29:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	what does "lsmod | grep oss" say?
2004-10-27T09:31:00.000Z	guptan	__daniel	I have pasted it in #flood
2004-10-27T09:31:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	hmmm, looks good
2004-10-27T09:32:00.000Z	guptan	__daniel	I was trying to fix mplayer and rhythm started giving this error. anyway to reset audio config to defaults (installation defaults)
2004-10-27T09:33:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	if you quit both and start rhythmbox again?
2004-10-27T09:34:00.000Z	guptan	__daniel	same message again
2004-10-27T09:34:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	what does "lsof | grep -E /dev/dsp" or "lsof | grep -E /dev/mixer" say? maybe those devices are still in use?

2004-11-03T16:16:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	write to ubuntu-users mailing list to ask for the repackaging of a newer version
2004-11-03T16:16:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	(and try the "old" version for now) :-)
2004-11-03T16:18:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	the ubuntu developers will sort out which version to use :-)
2004-11-03T16:19:00.000Z	guptan	__daniel	ubuntu provides version 3.0 and in universe u can find 4.2
2004-11-03T16:19:00.000Z	__daniel	guptan	well install the universe version :-)
2004-11-03T16:20:00.000Z	guptan	__daniel	almost installed, let synaptic do configuring packages for me
