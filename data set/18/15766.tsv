2005-09-07T10:19:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	'cp -a' is nice,
2005-09-07T10:20:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	nope, this does exactly what i want but fails on filenames with a colon.
2005-09-07T10:20:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	ergo: it does not do what you want (I assume you don't want it to fail)
2005-09-07T10:21:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	sure, but i don't want to use cp or i'd be using cp.
2005-09-07T10:21:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	Any reason?
2005-09-07T10:21:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	cannot open: invalid argument
2005-09-07T10:22:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	If it automatically escapes, perhaps just don't quote.
2005-09-07T10:23:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	but the filenames have other characters--spaces, parentheses--that need to be quoted.
2005-09-07T10:24:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	Does it also escape when you just run for in in `cat folders`; do .....; done ?
2005-09-07T10:25:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	tried that, but wouldn't work with the spaces.  the while works.
2005-09-07T10:26:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	Did you find out WHY 'cp' prints an error?
2005-09-07T10:26:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	tar prints the error.
2005-09-07T10:52:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	'rsync . /media/IAUDIO/music --include-from folders'
2005-09-07T10:52:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	any ideas?
2005-09-07T10:53:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	is . in the folder list?
2005-09-07T10:53:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	doesn't matter if it is; it says the same thing.
2005-09-07T11:04:00.000Z	andrewski	cafuego	for all the people who have lauded rsync, no one knows how to make it do what tar does.
2005-09-07T11:04:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewski	I've only ever used it remotely.
