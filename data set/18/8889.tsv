2008-05-01T12:17:00.000Z	tanath		help! something keeps raping my dying hard drive, and i can't stop it. when it does, my system becomes unreponsive. i need to figure out what's doing it
2008-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	what ubuntu u use
2008-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	hardy
2008-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	if it's hardy it's ok
2008-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	it's a file indexer for the tracker tool
2008-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	it most certainly is not. it's killing my already dying hard drive
2008-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	so go to acccessories > indexer and shut it off
2008-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	i tried turning off indexing for the tracker tool, and excluding the paths of that hard drive. it still does it
2008-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	how do you know it rapes your hard disk?
2008-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	because i can hear and feel it, and when it does it, my system becomes nearly unusable, because the drive is dying
2008-05-01T12:21:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	go to accessories > system monitor and try to see if the hard disk is being used or if it's idle
2008-05-01T12:23:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	not sure where the system monitor app was, but it's not there. regardless though, i've tried using lsof when it's happening to figure out what's causing it, but lsof says nothing is using the drive. it makes no sense
2008-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	so just throw the disk to the trash can and buy a new one
2008-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	the only thing that works is unmounting the partitions before it happens. but if i try to unmount them while it's happening, it says the device is busy. if i use lsof to figure out what's using it, it says nothing is. makes no sense
2008-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	gee thanks
2008-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	i don't know how to help you further, sorry :(
2008-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	tanath	lousygarua	thanks anyway
2008-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	lousygarua	tanath	you're welcome
