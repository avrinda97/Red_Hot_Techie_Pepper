2005-10-05T15:31:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	its still pre-release
2005-10-05T15:32:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	its all explained on the main www.ubuntu.com page
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	I know Breezy is preview now, just didn't know what Colony 5 meant.
2005-10-05T16:13:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	chown -R user.group /directory/   or   chmod u+rwx -R /directory/
2005-10-05T16:14:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	So, for example, chmod u+777 /knelix/
2005-10-05T16:14:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	is that right?
2005-10-05T16:15:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	Hmm.
2005-10-05T16:15:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	Oh, yeah.. I forgot..
2005-10-05T16:15:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	chmod u+777 -R /knelix/
2005-10-05T16:16:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	It's that the man entries are soooo long... and my screen goes to 640x480 in CLI... (remember, I can't launch the terminal from Gnome now) and it takes so long to find what I need...
2005-10-05T16:17:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	you can search a man by pressing the "/" key
2005-10-05T16:18:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	and its long because its complex and you really should read it and make sure you understand exactly what you are doing before you start screwing around with permissions and ownership
2005-10-05T16:19:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	Mac OS X is my primary OS, so I know about permissions. But, I just don't know how to alter them in the CLI.
2005-10-05T16:19:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	I'd recommend if you simply are changing them so its easier to copy, you shouldnt change them
2005-10-05T16:20:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	try "sudo tar zcvf stuff_want_to_copy.tar.gz /the/directory/"
2005-10-05T16:20:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	that way you have one file, which you may change ownership/permissions on without accidentally screwing up your system
2005-10-05T16:21:00.000Z	Knelix	p0windah	I don't understand why my folding@home directory is only available for root.. I think that's a little overboard...
2005-10-05T16:22:00.000Z	p0windah	Knelix	one sec, let me load gui and see how its done
