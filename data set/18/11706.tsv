2006-10-09T06:42:00.000Z	ashzilla		Does anyone know how to upload a directory recursively with ftp?
2006-10-09T06:42:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	i don't know, but the "wput" package should be able to do that
2006-10-31T14:05:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	.deb files are really just ar archives, you can extract them with the "ar" command. they contain to tar.gz archives, which you can extract with "tar xf"
2006-10-31T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	why'd you want to do that anyway?
2006-10-31T14:12:00.000Z	ashzilla	LjL	long story, but my file got messed up trying to set a color theme
2006-10-31T14:13:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	if your .bashrc is messed up, just restore it from /etc/skel/.bashrc
2006-11-16T15:24:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	no
2006-11-16T15:24:00.000Z	ashzilla	LjL	please share :)
2006-11-16T15:24:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	echo "text to put on" >> filename
2006-11-16T15:25:00.000Z	ashzilla	LjL	thanks.
2006-11-16T15:25:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	cat reads from standard input, not from the command line
2006-11-16T15:25:00.000Z	ashzilla	LjL	I don't know the difference, but I appriciate your inititive.
2006-11-16T15:25:00.000Z	ashzilla	LjL	how can I copy and paste in the cli?
2006-11-16T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	echo expects a parameter.  "echo foobar" prints "foobar" on the screen, because you passed it as a parameter
2006-11-16T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	cat, instead, reads from standard input -- i.e. you type "cat", press Enter, and it sits there waiting for you to type things, and prints them
2006-11-16T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	depends on what terminal you're using. inside X most terminal respect the select-to-copy and middle-click-to-paste convention
2006-11-16T15:27:00.000Z	ashzilla	LjL	Ahhhhh, thank you for clearing that up. That's a good concept to understand.
2006-11-16T15:27:00.000Z	LjL	ashzilla	but that ends up in the middle-click clipboard, which is separate from the clipboard that ctrl+c and ctrl+v use. so if you want to copy to/from a terminal to/from another program, you need to do the same thing in the other program
