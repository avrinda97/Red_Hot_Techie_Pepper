2009-07-24T00:08:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x		One other question -- I'm going to convert my ext3 SSD and SD partitions to ext2 -- but what about the 'noatime' flag in fstab? Should I drop that?
2009-07-24T00:09:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	why are you going to convert them to ext2?
2009-07-24T00:09:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	b/c they're both flash-based media, and I can't have them die on me b/c of ext3's journaling
2009-07-24T00:10:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	you are aware that if there is a power failure, it may corrupt the disk if you don't have journaling?
2009-07-24T00:11:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	when you say corrupt -- recoverable (so I could format and reinstall)?
2009-07-24T00:11:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	yeah, you can reinstall, but you'll lose the data obviously
2009-07-24T00:13:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	then in my eyes -- better safe than sorry. And philpem makes a good point -- power failure is highly unlikely.
2009-07-24T00:13:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	yeah, but if it crashes or something, same problem
2009-07-24T00:13:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	although crashing/power failures are unlikely if you have a notebook
2009-07-24T00:14:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	that's true -- my main concern is for the life of the flash media. I also read something about disabling swap. But doesn't that eliminate the ability to standby/hibernate?
2009-07-24T00:15:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	you don't need swap for suspend but you will for hibernate
2009-07-24T00:15:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	I don't own an SSD, but I've seen some calculations that indicate that you will never use up all the available writes
2009-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	alright. So then perhaps I'm best off formatting the SD card as ext2 and leaving the SSD as ext3
2009-07-24T00:17:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	I'd encourage you to look into the number of writes on SSDs if you're interested; like I said, I don't own one, so that may or may not be true
2009-07-24T00:18:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	I appreciate it
2009-07-24T00:18:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	ext2 would probably be fine for the SD card
2009-07-24T00:18:00.000Z	adam7	xTheGoat121x	did you put part of ubuntu on the SD card?
2009-07-24T00:19:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	adam7	yes. It's only a 2GB SSD, so I have most on the SSD and then /home and /usr on a 4GB SD card
