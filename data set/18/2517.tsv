2010-04-30T14:20:00.000Z	idontdrink		If anyone here knows about remastersys, I had a question: can you make a backup of an encrypted system with it?
2010-04-30T14:21:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 i'm quite familiar with remastersys, but i'm not sure about *that* question
2010-04-30T14:21:00.000Z	idontdrink	grndslm	where could i find the answer to it?
2010-04-30T14:21:00.000Z	grndslm		i would imagine so, since everything is decrypted before making your "tmp iso" that eventually turns into your iso
2010-04-30T14:21:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 really, there's no reason that you couldn't just try it out and see if it works.. it's a 100% shot to see the 50/50 answer
2010-04-30T14:22:00.000Z	idontdrink	grndslm	how complicated is remastersys?
2010-04-30T14:22:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 here's some more stuff to help you out when you get past the backup stage, and want to do full-on customizing of "your own" distro

2010-04-30T14:23:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 or you could customize remastersys to add in some commands, as ubuntu suggested above. . .
2010-04-30T14:23:00.000Z	idontdrink		I dont get it :(
2010-04-30T14:23:00.000Z	idontdrink		whats going on
2010-04-30T14:24:00.000Z	idontdrink		im too tired
2010-04-30T14:24:00.000Z	idontdrink	grndslm	what are you saying?
2010-04-30T14:24:00.000Z	idontdrink	grndslm	im serious
2010-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	idontdrink		what do you mean add some commands
2010-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 that guide i linked to is geared more toward the "remastersys dist" side of things, where it strips your /home folder... if you want "remastersys backup" to work, then just try it... the only catch is that EVERYTHING on your system will need to be less than 4 GB
2010-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 basically, just try remastersys backup... if it works, you have the answer to your question; if it doesn't work, you have the ansewer to your question....  and if it doesn't work, you can add some commands, like the guy "ubuntu" suggested above, inside the remastersys script itself (it's just a script, and you can add commands anywhere in the backup section to do whatever the heck you want)
2010-04-30T14:28:00.000Z	grndslm	idontdrink	 but forget about it if your system is > 4gb
