2008-12-02T17:34:00.000Z	Kingsy101		can someone tell me the name of a half decent code editor program? I would use the text editor but it doesnt have line numbers and i have been using 'scream' but I don't like it, it randomly closes itself
2008-12-02T17:34:00.000Z	Kingsy101		is there kind of like a standard one that the majority of people use in ubuntu?
2008-12-02T17:35:00.000Z	Kingsy101		yea thats what I need really, cos thats what I am doing in it
2008-12-02T17:35:00.000Z	Kingsy101		hmmm ok
2008-12-02T17:35:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	check out the plugins in Gedit, you can enable syntax highlighting and line numbering
2008-12-02T17:36:00.000Z	Kingsy101	meganox	- how?
2008-12-02T17:37:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	http://www.micahcarrick.com/09-29-2007/gedit-html-editor.html
2008-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	Kingsy101	meganox	- cool, do I need to download that from the site or can I use a get -apt command?
2008-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins
2008-12-02T17:40:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	yes, apt-get install gedit-plugins
2008-12-02T17:40:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	and google for third party syntax highlighters for various languages
2008-12-02T17:41:00.000Z	Kingsy101	meganox	- doesnt the command download that for you?
2008-12-02T17:42:00.000Z	Kingsy101		ok, I am downloading the plugins now, once they have downloaded can I just go into gedit and enable the ones I want?
2008-12-02T17:44:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	gedit uses GtkSourceView for syntax highlighting, you just need to find/write XML files for the languages you want, details are in the first article
2008-12-02T17:44:00.000Z	Kingsy101		ok...
2008-12-02T17:44:00.000Z	Kingsy101		thanks
2008-12-02T17:45:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	many languages should be built-in
2008-12-02T17:45:00.000Z	meganox	Kingsy101	I haven't used it for that, I use vi mostly
