2006-08-31T11:34:00.000Z	eclapton		hello to all the people ...
2006-08-31T11:35:00.000Z	eclapton		Well I have a Dapper Live CD  6.06, but the installer doesn't work, it just crashes ... anyone to tell me how to download the installer, or how to use synaptic to update from my Breezy badger???
2006-08-31T11:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	6.06.1
2006-08-31T11:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	6.06 had an installer bug, use the alternate cd if you like though, or use 6,06,1 if you want the livecd
2006-08-31T11:40:00.000Z	eclapton	eyequeue	-- Sorry, didnt explain well the problem : m working on 56kb modem, dont wanna download a iso... the Live CD it was shipit who did ship it?
2006-08-31T11:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	ah
2006-08-31T11:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	you hve unfortunately been bitten by that known bug
2006-08-31T11:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	your options are the ones i mentioned, or possiby d/ling the server cd and then "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" after, but that still uses bandwidth
2006-08-31T11:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	i don't know where you live, but perhaps an internet cafe could prove useful?
2006-08-31T12:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	you might be able to use "debootstrap" for it, but it would be up to someone else to explain how, sorry
2006-08-31T12:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	but ... i think that relies heavily on a net connection too
2006-08-31T12:02:00.000Z	eclapton	eyequeue	thanks a lot --- think its time to pay for an ADSL
2006-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	yeah, or even an hour at some cafe, heh
2006-08-31T12:10:00.000Z	eclapton	eyequeue	- think ill pass sometimes to help out -- thnx and goodbye
2006-08-31T12:05:00.000Z	eclapton	eyequeue	- just as a note - this is war! been using linux since RH 6.2, and the help irc channels werent this... windy... uauh
2006-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	eclapton	lol, 854 in here now :)  it can be a zoo, i'll bet it's getting worse in the future too, sigh
2006-08-31T12:08:00.000Z	eclapton	eyequeue	- well, if people continues to say 'thanks' at the end, its not so bad... but it would be better if they read a little bit more... its pc problems yo have to read :D
