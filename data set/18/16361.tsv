2004-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	phin|work	subterrific	let me think for a second, cause i have ran across quite a few
2004-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	phin|work		yep
2004-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	phin|work		theres one
2004-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	subterrific		xmms uses gtk?
2004-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	phin|work		yep
2004-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	phin|work		i belive mplayer does as well
2004-10-01T13:55:00.000Z	subterrific		i'd have never guessed, its entirely customized
2004-10-01T13:55:00.000Z	phin|work		looks just like any dvd software thats out for, ack, windows
2004-10-01T13:55:00.000Z	subterrific		there are better alternatives to both xmms and mplayer
2004-10-01T13:55:00.000Z	phin|work		i personally use totem
2004-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	phin|work		but i use xmms alot for it being lite
2004-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	subterrific		rhythmbox and totem-xine
2004-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	phin|work		and it has alot of plugins that i like
2004-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	phin|work		there is also beep, but im not sure if it can use xmms plugins
2004-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	phin|work		i know its based on the xmms branch
2004-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	subterrific	phin|work	so you pretty much need to bug the xmms developers to port to gtk2
2004-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	phin|work	subterrific	hmmm. i suppose thats possible :P
