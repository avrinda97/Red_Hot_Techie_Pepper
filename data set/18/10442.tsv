2006-12-08T11:30:00.000Z	computermc		I installed 1.10 and the screen resolution if 800X600 and it kind of looks fuzzy. I thought I would go in and change the resolution, but it only gives me 800by600 and 640by480. How do I get other resolutions to choose from?

2006-12-08T11:32:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	you installed v1.10 of what?
2006-12-08T11:32:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	ubuntu
2006-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	not 6.10??
2006-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	sorry, yes it was 6.10
2006-12-08T11:34:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	ah.. then it makes more sense =) you have to setup xorg for your videocard.. what are you using? nvidia? ati?
2006-12-08T11:34:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	I'm not sure, how I would I find out?
2006-12-08T11:35:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	hold on..
2006-12-08T11:35:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	its a old gateway solo laptop
2006-12-08T11:35:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	ok
2006-12-08T11:36:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	I'm kind of new to ubuntu myself.. but try typing lspci at a terminal and search for something that looks like a graphics adapter
2006-12-08T11:39:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	would this be it...
2006-12-08T11:40:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	yes.. that looks like it might be the one
2006-12-08T11:41:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	now you have to find a driver for this card.. since it's not nvidia or ati it might be a little tricky.. try googling for "neomagic magicgraph ubuntu" or something like that
2006-12-08T11:41:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	ok
2006-12-08T11:42:00.000Z	computermc	Slart	, I did find a driver on ubuntulinux.org. I see if that works
2006-12-08T11:42:00.000Z	Slart	computermc	nice.. there should be some kind of readme on how to get it working too
