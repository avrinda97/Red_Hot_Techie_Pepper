2011-10-19T13:36:00.000Z	Jonny		is there an easy way to mount a samba share?
2011-10-19T13:36:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	smbmount
2011-10-19T13:36:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	/etc/fstab
2011-10-19T13:37:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	you mean how to create a share then I think?
2011-10-19T13:38:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	well if i have it as a share i am not able to import my music folder into clemantine
2011-10-19T13:39:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	no idea what clementine is :-)
2011-10-19T13:39:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	it is just a music player in ubuntu
2011-10-19T13:42:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	to tell you the truth, i bought a qnap nas for home a year or so ago and haven't looked back, for music and file sharing it's so awesome, and simple (and I set up file shares all day every day ;-) )
2011-10-19T13:48:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	that is really good
2011-10-19T13:49:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	I just set it up as a printer share with my old(ish) hp deskjet - worked first go
2011-10-19T13:49:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	nice!!
2011-10-19T13:50:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	unbelievably it even has an asterisk add on, you can use it as a VOIP PBX although I've not tried yet
2011-10-19T13:51:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	i would like a home skype setup
2011-10-19T13:52:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	the nature of voip is that the pbx just does the connections - kinda like a matchmaker - then the media, the actual conversation goes direct between clients, so the pbx doesn't need to be terribly fast or have that much bandwidth, as the calls aren't going through it.
2011-10-19T13:52:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	yeah. Didnt realise that
2011-10-19T13:53:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	try asterisknow - with an old junk PC works really well - you need a bunch of voip phones or ATAs (analogue telephone adapters) to play with it much though - although softphones installed on PCs will work
2011-10-19T13:54:00.000Z	freshinstall	Jonny	but be prepared to spend a year or more mastering it ;-)  I'm glad I did, got a killer phone setup at home now, but it's a long haul
2011-10-19T13:55:00.000Z	Jonny	freshinstall	im not sure if i can spare that time lol
