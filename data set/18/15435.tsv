2008-11-08T17:34:00.000Z	phanter		hi there
2008-11-08T17:34:00.000Z	phanter		I really need some help. I want to install ubuntu alternate from usb. I manage to put the install cd on the usb disk and boot it, but _every_ time it fails because it "cannot find the cd-rom drive". Is it possible to install it and how?
2008-11-08T17:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 how did you put it on the usb key?
2008-11-08T17:34:00.000Z	dr_willis		oops :)
2008-11-08T17:37:00.000Z	phanter	dr_willis	used a script that is normally used to put a ubuntu installer on a usb key (found it at the eeebuntu website), and I also tried unetbootin
2008-11-08T17:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 i had unetbootin work fine for me on alternative installer. Theres also the usbinstaller tool in the ubuntu menus. Not sure if thats useable from a live cd or not.
2008-11-08T17:38:00.000Z	phanter		I wonder if the alternate/debian installer is hardcoded to ask for a cd-rom or that it can take arguments that not make it check for the cd-rom
2008-11-08T17:39:00.000Z	phanter	dr_willis	the point is that unetbootin works for all live cd's (and thus installers), but not for the alternate version
2008-11-08T17:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 the unetbootin method worked fine for me for the alternative cd.
2008-11-08T17:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 the only reasibn i know this.. is because i accidently used the alt-cd image  when i made my thumbdrive  the otehr day.
2008-11-08T17:40:00.000Z	phanter	dr_willis	and you managed to install using that usb?
2008-11-08T17:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 yes.
2008-11-08T17:40:00.000Z	phanter		oke... then I will go and try again :)
2008-11-08T17:40:00.000Z	phanter		thanks
2008-11-08T17:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 i specifically was using the 64bit alt- installer , and unetbootin. in a usb key that i have had dozens of obher 'bootable' linux disrtos on befor..
2008-11-08T17:41:00.000Z	phanter	dr_willis	I will need the 32bit version, but that should not really matter I guess
2008-11-08T17:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	phanter	 yep. I decided to finally test 64bit.. No issues with it so far. :)
2008-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	phanter	dr_willis	well, my eeepc does not swallow the last 32bits ;-), must admit that my x64 debian install runs very smooth on my 634 bit machine
