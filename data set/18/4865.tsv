2010-01-08T20:52:00.000Z	ftab		my mic has stopped working in Karmic Koala, I tested it on another system running Karmic Koala and it was working properly, what could be the reason ?
2010-01-08T20:54:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	i'd guess it's a configuration issue... did you play around with sound settings?
2010-01-08T20:55:00.000Z	ftab	FiReSTaRT	yes I did, and I remember I did not change any settings
2010-01-08T20:55:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	open the sound settings, go to hardware and tell me which profile you're running
2010-01-08T20:58:00.000Z	ftab	FiReSTaRT	it was Analog Stereo Output,
2010-01-08T20:59:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	that's the problem.. switch to analog stereo duplex, then click on the input tab, speak into the mike and see if the indicator will show anything
2010-01-08T21:00:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	no idea.. you or someone else may have changed it by accident or it could have been an upgrade glitch
2010-01-08T21:01:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	in any case i'm glad to be of some assistance for a change :D
2010-01-08T21:03:00.000Z	ftab	FiReSTaRT	my skype has stopped working now :-( I mean no sound
2010-01-08T21:03:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	both input and output?
2010-01-08T21:03:00.000Z	ftab	FiReSTaRT	yes
2010-01-08T21:04:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	usually you just have to config it.. i think i also had to the first time around.. im opening mine
2010-01-08T21:04:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	go into options and go to sound
2010-01-08T21:04:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	sound devices
2010-01-08T21:05:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	tell me if anything (mic/speakers/ring) are NOT "PulseAudio server (local)"
2010-01-08T21:05:00.000Z	ftab	FiReSTaRT	a restart worked now :-) I mean restarting Skype
2010-01-08T21:06:00.000Z	ftab	FiReSTaRT	thanks for your help
2010-01-08T21:06:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	ftab	ahhh ok.. i think it does need to be restarted to play nice with changed osund settings.. no worries and enjoy :)
