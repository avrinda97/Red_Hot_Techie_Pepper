2009-04-30T21:50:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	But the limit is only for a single file.
2009-04-30T21:50:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	what do you mean?
2009-04-30T21:51:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	If there's a 3 GB file and a 700 MB file and more similar files, then the 4 GB limit won't apply.
2009-04-30T21:52:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	yeah but the virtual hd needs 4GB itself - and the virtual hd is a single file
2009-04-30T21:52:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	But he tried 3 GB disk too.
2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	I believe that failed because the install needs 4gb - I coulde be wrong though
2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	BUT the disk file is 3 GB as specified by user.
2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	The installer loads data from the separate .iso
2009-04-30T21:54:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	I know that, and I  also know that the cdrom filesystem is compressed, so when it's decompressed it is 4gb
2009-04-30T21:54:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	But it isn't decompressed to the disk.
2009-04-30T21:55:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	And if the user specifies 3 GB virtual disk, then the disk won't exceed 3 GB
2009-04-30T21:55:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	where is it compressed to? I'm confused
2009-04-30T21:55:00.000Z	grawity	pinged	Hmm, me too >_>
2009-04-30T21:59:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	turns out you were right - it only needs 4gb
2009-04-30T22:00:00.000Z	pinged	grawity	sorry I mean 3gb
