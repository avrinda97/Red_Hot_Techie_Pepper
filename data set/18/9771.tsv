2007-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	snowpunk98		what would be the best way to move a .tar off my ubuntu server to my ubuntu desktop
2007-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	wget it and then delete it off the server?
2007-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	I do not have Apache setup
2007-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	I say to set it up then
2007-04-12T08:11:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	Thanks that worked, I got it
2007-04-18T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	sudo chmod -w file
2007-04-18T07:25:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	yeah, if it is owned by root, you could also just do "sudo chmod go-w file"
2007-04-18T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	^
2007-04-18T07:33:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	Your saying that only the owner can write to the file?
2007-04-18T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	I am saying that everyone but the owner can write to it
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	I want only root to write to it not everyone but owner
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	who owns the file now
2007-04-18T07:37:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	how do I check that
2007-04-18T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	ls -l
2007-04-18T07:38:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	ok in this instance doing "sudo chmod 644 file" not sure how informative that is though for permission changes in the future
2007-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	OK I did 644 now its rw r r so only the owner can write to it correct?
2007-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	bruenig	snowpunk98	right
2007-04-18T07:45:00.000Z	snowpunk98	bruenig	ty
