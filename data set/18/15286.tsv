2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		i have a question about groups in ubuntu - why does the installer create a group of the same name as my user, and add me to that group?
2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		doesn't it make more sense to simply add my user to the 'users' group, as would be the case on most other *nixes?
2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		debian? really? i used to use debian and never noticed it do that
2005-04-16T10:13:00.000Z	pressureman		so every new user will get a group of the same name created too?
2005-04-16T10:14:00.000Z	pressureman		so, (sorry for a swathe of dumb questions), essentially each new user has no groups in common until the admin puts them in the 'users' group?
2005-04-16T10:16:00.000Z	pressureman		btw, i am running a fujitsu siemens amilo M 1425 notebook, and i was blown away by how everything "just works" with ubuntu
2005-04-16T10:16:00.000Z	pressureman		right down to 1280x800 on my widescreen LCD (ATI Mobility Radeon 9700)
2005-04-16T10:18:00.000Z	pressureman		can anybody offer a rough approximation of the amount of time it would take to do a debian install, and bring it up to the level of polishedness of ubuntu?
2005-04-16T10:19:00.000Z	pressureman		(being that i'm a die hard debian admin, and would still use it for console only servers, but i'm liking ubuntu more and more on my laptop)
2005-04-16T10:20:00.000Z	pressureman		i guess what i'm really asking is, is there any reason why in some situations debian might be better suited to a desktop?
2005-04-16T10:21:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	you want really old stuff that always works?
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	ubuntu is hardly the unknown
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	it's simply debian with a nicer gnome and better maintained main
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	pressureman	Dreamer3	it is for me - i've only really discovered it!
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	(understatement)
2005-04-16T10:25:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	that's the best way dude!
2005-04-16T10:25:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	and linux from scratch, that's the holy grail of "i have no life and nothing better to do"
2005-04-16T10:26:00.000Z	Dreamer3	pressureman	well, at that point you package stuff obviously :)
