2012-03-30T04:50:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	It quits if you log out and back in again?  hummm... I dono.  Why is it "quiting"?
2012-03-30T04:51:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Or what exactly is quitting?  Is it just being muted?  Or....?
2012-03-30T04:51:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Fire up  alsamixer  and see what's going on.
2012-03-30T04:52:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	What audio source are you trying to play, and what audio player ..?
2012-03-30T04:53:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Well, run your player of choice from terminal and watch terminal for errors.
2012-03-30T04:56:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Maybe it's a problem with pulseaudio.  Try uninstalling it.
2012-03-30T04:58:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Maybe this is it:  Bug #870063
2012-03-30T05:00:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Is your system fully updated?
2012-03-30T05:03:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Either on the MotherBoard or in a PCI slot.
2012-03-30T05:04:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	What sound card do you have?
2012-03-30T05:05:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	What does  alsamixer say about it?  (Look in the top left corner of the alsamixer window.)

2012-03-30T05:13:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	I don't know if spaceneedle was commenting on your issue, but sounds like a bug... I dono if I can be of any help.  You may just have to wait for it to get solved later on.
2012-03-30T05:19:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	(I don't understand your last question.)
2012-03-30T05:21:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Try  xfce
2012-03-30T05:21:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	 sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2012-03-30T05:24:00.000Z	usr13	Pilot200hrWonder	Try  xfce  I'm pretty sure you'll like it.
