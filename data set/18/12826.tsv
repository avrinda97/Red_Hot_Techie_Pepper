2006-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	trae		but...
2006-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	trae		it only does 1280x800 :(
2006-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	trae		which just isn't enough real estate
2006-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	trae		thinking about giving this one to the wife...
2006-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	trae		since her desktop is dying.
2006-03-04T13:49:00.000Z	trae		I've already got a 1.6Ghz M centrino chip though.... I'd want to get something faster than this ;)
2006-03-04T13:49:00.000Z	hotluck	trae	the top version is 1900 something resolution but seems a bit high for general use, i strain on this one sometimes
