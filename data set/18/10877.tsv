2006-10-14T16:56:00.000Z	teledyn_k		how is ubuntu different than debian/unstable?
2006-10-14T16:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	less on the unstable side, more on the usable side.
2006-10-14T16:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	just try out the livecd and see if its current enough for you :)
2006-10-14T16:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	you need another reason, in addition to instability?
2006-10-14T05:00:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	yes, because the instability issue normally isn't one of the more troubling things for me
2006-10-14T05:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	if you are looking for a reason, then don't switch :)
2006-10-14T05:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	ubuntu is decent about that, but in the end, compiling a kernel isn't all *that* bad.
2006-10-14T05:03:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	it becomes a pain though when you've got 3 or 4 different sets of hardware that you continually need to build stuff for, plus sometimes the releases are buggy
2006-10-14T05:03:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	its really just cumbersome to keep up with.  for example recent releases of the madwifi driver for my internal wifi are broken with dhcp client
2006-10-14T05:04:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	multiply that kind of headache by 3 or 4 and it does build up
2006-10-14T05:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	well that's really not a fault of any linux distro. If the drivers are bad, then it won't matter if you are on Sid or Ubuntu or _____ -- they'll be bad either way.
2006-10-14T05:05:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	not necessarily.  many distros are proactive and patch things and test the drivers out.  they would release something that's been QAed a little bit
2006-10-14T05:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	in my experience, ubunutu is better than most with hardware support. A lot of things surprised me by running out of the box.
2006-10-14T05:07:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	yeah i was curious how it compared with other distros.  i've been impressed before with centos and fedora with ou-of-the-box support for "non standard" hardware (e.g. common wifi devices that most people have)
2006-10-14T05:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	if I wanted to be 100% sure about something working, I'd always compile a kernel with the correct drivers.  Perhaps you should try more "commerical" distros like Suse or FC. Personally, I can't stand their software management systems, so I stay away from them.
2006-10-14T05:07:00.000Z	teledyn_k	fyrestrtr	yum?  what's wrong with that?
2006-10-14T05:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	I have two FC and one CentOS server at work. I don't mind yum that much (because we don't upgrade the servers that often) but I once tried FC5 on my desktop while I was doing some HD housekeeping and man what a headache. This depends on that, which depends on the first thing.
2006-10-14T05:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	teledyn_k	join #ubuntu-offtopic I'm sure people there know more. We try to keep this chan for support issues.
