2010-02-09T23:09:00.000Z	Cybodog		I have kvm and kvm_amd in /etc/modules but they are not loaded at boot time, but will modprobe.  How do I get them to load at boot?
2010-02-09T23:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Cybodog	works for me... can you post the modules file and the dmesg ?
2010-02-09T23:10:00.000Z	Cybodog	erUSUL	yes, did not think of dmesg
2010-02-09T23:10:00.000Z	Cybodog		no newbie here
2010-02-09T23:11:00.000Z	Cybodog		but thanks for the advise
2010-02-09T23:11:00.000Z	Cybodog		http://pastebin.org/89000  modules
2010-02-09T23:13:00.000Z	Cybodog		brain damage on the dmeg, working onit.
2010-02-09T23:14:00.000Z	Cybodog		http://pastebin.org/89001 dmesg output.
2010-02-09T23:15:00.000Z	Cybodog		thanks for looking at it.
2010-02-09T23:17:00.000Z	Cybodog	erUSUL	much noise here, in case you missed it:  http://pastebin.org/89001  http://pastebin.org/89000
2010-02-09T23:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Cybodog	weird i have a amd 3800+ and have no problems at all
2010-02-09T23:25:00.000Z	Cybodog	erUSUL	yes it is.  I can cludge it by a start up script that runs modprobe, but I don't remember how to do that.
2010-02-09T23:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Cybodog	i only load kvm-amd from modules though (and is with - not with _ )
2010-02-09T23:25:00.000Z	Cybodog	erUSUL	I will try that.

2010-02-09T23:26:00.000Z	Cybodog	erUSUL	I know that kvm-_intel or amd *will* load kvm
