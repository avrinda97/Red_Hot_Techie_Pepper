2008-03-10T17:26:00.000Z	na033681		Can someone please help. Whenever I try to boot Ubuntu, it goes to the screen that says "Starting Up..." and seems to freeze.
2008-03-10T17:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Are you trying to boot a live cd or a HD install
2008-03-10T17:30:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	HD Drive
2008-03-10T17:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Did this install ever work, or is this the first boot after the install
2008-03-10T17:32:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	First boot after the install.
2008-03-10T17:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Is this a dual bot system or single
2008-03-10T17:33:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	Dual
2008-03-10T17:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	at the grub menu press e to edit the command line e again one the line is selected.. and remove quiet and splash from the command line then boot.. as my first suggestion
2008-03-10T17:36:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	Ok I will try that.
2008-03-10T17:56:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	Still nothing
2008-03-10T17:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Did you see where it was stopping or the error involved?
2008-03-10T17:57:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	It just stops on the screen that says "Startin up..." with the cursor under it blinking
2008-03-10T17:59:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	I tried disconnecting my ext HD to see if that did anything but that didn't help either.
2008-03-10T18:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Were you trying to install on an external drive, or was the external drive connected when you installed etc?
2008-03-10T18:01:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	It was connected when I installed
2008-03-10T18:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Im not sure where to start with that, but I would try installing without the external in place to try and make sure the installer can do its job.
2008-03-10T18:03:00.000Z	na033681	Jack_Sparrow	It worked before with a previous install, but I re-booted a couple time and got the problem I have now so I deleted the partions and started over.
2008-03-10T18:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	na033681	Ok so it was working.. at one point, which was my first question..  You were able to boot the hd and get in.... answer is still the same try again without the external
