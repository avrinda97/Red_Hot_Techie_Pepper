2006-12-15T14:56:00.000Z	startswithz		how do I share a folder?  I am trying to move files off of a computer that's got knoppix running over to my ubuntu machine
2006-12-15T14:57:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	hrrm you need tesetup a folder as shared in the menus....
2006-12-15T14:57:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	it may install samba (i suggest thins method -- 'samba' to do windows shars)
2006-12-15T14:57:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	(on the ubuntu machine)
2006-12-15T14:57:00.000Z	startswithz		I have samba installed
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	startswithz		and I have been able to see the folder on the knoppix computer
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	you will also need to 'smbpasswd -a <user>' as approriate to add a  samba password for taht user on the ubunt machine (I think)
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	startswithz		but I was unable to write to it.
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	startswithz		I did that too.  I think
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	then you can use the knoppix machine to connect too the SMB share on the ubuntu machine and copy across
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	which i am not entirely sure howto do under knoppix grapihically...
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	startswithz		ok how would I do it through the terminal?
2006-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	I have done smbclient etc. but that is another matter.. ask in knoppix channel?
2006-12-15T14:59:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	well do yuo need to copy a whole load of files/dirs ? or just files in one dir ?
2006-12-15T14:59:00.000Z	startswithz	enyc	I need a bunch of files that are in different dirs
2006-12-15T14:59:00.000Z	startswithz		some things I need some I don't
2006-12-15T15:00:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	hrrrrrm well you would be best to ask somebody who is familiar with KNOPPIX grapical kde file tools
2006-12-15T15:00:00.000Z	enyc	startswithz	erm... if you are familira with commands to do things you can tar up the files you need and send the tar file wtih smbclient
