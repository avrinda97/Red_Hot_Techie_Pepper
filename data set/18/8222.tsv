2007-11-01T06:34:00.000Z	Vich		heya guys
2007-11-01T06:35:00.000Z	Vich		can anyone tell me what the purpose of the keyring manager is?
2007-11-01T06:35:00.000Z	Vich		!info keyring manager
2007-11-01T06:35:00.000Z	Vich		!ubotu keyring manager
2007-11-01T06:35:00.000Z	Vich		ncurses
2007-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	Vich		my problem is that upon boot the keyring manager always asks for my password
2007-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	Vich		it's very irritating
2007-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	Vich		then my wireless also asks for my password
2007-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	Vich		I thought the keyring manager was supposed to remember my wireless key
2007-11-01T06:37:00.000Z	Vich		and maybe not prompt me for a password all the time, since that is counter-productive
2007-11-01T06:37:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	to prevent Keyring manager from prompting for the password, install the package: libpam-gnome-keyring
2007-11-01T06:39:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	welcome :)
2007-11-01T06:40:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	did you upgrade from feisty?
2007-11-01T06:40:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	ok first, for libpam-gnome-keyring to work your Login password and your default keyring password should be the same
2007-11-01T06:41:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	oh, hmm that might actually be the problem, I am not sure if libpam-keyring and autologin work together
2007-11-01T06:48:00.000Z	Vich	heguru	I think that did it
2007-11-01T06:49:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	wireless should be prompt free as well. you should only have to enter ONE login password
2007-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	heguru	Vich	if its prompting for wireless password, I would suggest deleting your keyrings (System -> Administration -> Keyring Manager)
