2011-09-24T06:38:00.000Z	Raven		does anyone have any idea why this server isn't getting outside access when static ip is assigned?
2011-09-24T06:39:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	did you define a default route and gw?
2011-09-24T06:39:00.000Z	Raven	angel56	yes i did
2011-09-24T06:39:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	did you define dns servers in /etc/resolv.conf?
2011-09-24T06:40:00.000Z	Raven	angel56	yes i did
2011-09-24T06:40:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	can you ping the gateway address?
2011-09-24T06:40:00.000Z	Raven	angel56	yes
2011-09-24T06:40:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	can you ping google.com?
2011-09-24T06:41:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	can you ping 8.8.8.8?
2011-09-24T06:43:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	then there is a problem getting through the gateway
2011-09-24T06:44:00.000Z	Raven	angel56	http://paste.ubuntu.com/695949/ this is my config
2011-09-24T06:45:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	that doesn't look right. .254 is the broadcast address for the network. The gateway is the hub address, which is usually .1
2011-09-24T06:45:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	and your static ip should be something 'normal' I usually start my static IPs at 150 or 200.
2011-09-24T06:46:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	you need to make sure you don't use a static ip that the hub might reassign as dynamic to someone else.
2011-09-24T06:46:00.000Z	Raven	angel56	that is the way I have it configured and have no problems with any other machine
2011-09-24T06:46:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	you have broadcast and gateway the same?
2011-09-24T06:46:00.000Z	Raven	angel56	my dhcp has certain ip's blocked out for static assignment that is one of them
2011-09-24T06:47:00.000Z	angel56	Raven	well, if that works it is magic I never saw before
