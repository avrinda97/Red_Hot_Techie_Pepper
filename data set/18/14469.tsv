2006-04-01T06:02:00.000Z	ubunt1		Hi
2006-04-01T06:03:00.000Z	ubunt1		I have a problem
2006-04-01T06:03:00.000Z	ubunt1		I did something very stupid
2006-04-01T06:03:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	what did you do?
2006-04-01T06:04:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	boot in the rescue mode and use usermod to make your admin user members of the following groups 'adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev users lpadmin scanner admin'
2006-04-01T06:05:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	the default group name should be the same as the name of your admin user
2006-04-01T06:06:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	useradd <username> <group> would do that
2006-04-01T06:07:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	ern, not useradd, adduser would do that
2006-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	no, you should be able to choose rescue mode on on boot, in the GRUB menu
2006-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	I'm using gaim, the tab key doesn't work like on other IRC clients
2006-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	oh well it does
2006-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	he he he he
2006-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	:-)
2006-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	has been years since the last time I had an IRC chat
2006-04-01T06:10:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	during the nineties I used it almost daily... before this dark times...
2006-04-01T06:10:00.000Z	redguy	ubunt1	anyway, if you don't see tha menu during boot you should be able to enable it hitting esc as anstei and Killgore said
2006-04-01T06:13:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	thanks very much for your help!
2006-04-01T06:13:00.000Z	ubunt1	redguy	much appreciated!
