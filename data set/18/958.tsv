2011-07-19T02:08:00.000Z	boehmer		hello
2011-07-19T02:08:00.000Z	boehmer		i could need some help with my audio setuo
2011-07-19T02:08:00.000Z	boehmer		my snd-hda-intel doesn't recognize front panel audio jacks
2011-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	whats your sound device?... i just had this problem the other day
2011-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	boehmer		it actually works when booting natty liveCD. on my productive system with maverick sound keeps being player via rear speaker jack
2011-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	KM0201		hmm
2011-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	boehmer	KM0201	i have a DH55HC intel motherboard with onboard audio
2011-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	well that doesn't really tell us what your sound device is.
2011-07-19T02:10:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	lspci in a terminal, and find your audio device, and tell me what it is.
2011-07-19T02:11:00.000Z	boehmer	KM0201	"00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06)"
2011-07-19T02:11:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	hmm, thats the same one i have, i had to install pulse audio, gnome-media, then use gnome-streamer, and manually set it to go through to my headphones, when i plugged htem in
2011-07-19T02:12:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	but i have a laptop, not a PC... but i imagine you have a similar scenario on your hand
2011-07-19T02:12:00.000Z	boehmer	KM0201	on my laptop for work with fedora i had to do the same to use internal speakers (had set it to docking station sound the other day)
2011-07-19T02:12:00.000Z	KM0201		ya
2011-07-19T02:13:00.000Z	boehmer	KM0201	i run kubuntu and in the preferences dialog there is only 1 device:( hmm, maybe it's only a config problem?
2011-07-19T02:13:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	almmost definitely
2011-07-19T02:14:00.000Z	boehmer	KM0201	i'll investigate that. thanks so far for the hint!
2011-07-19T02:14:00.000Z	KM0201	boehmer	did you install pulseaudio?
