2010-01-16T19:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	yes; so? what are you trying to do? i just joined
2010-01-16T19:37:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	 [Karmic] The DEB program package ekiga-dbg is installed. '~$ gdb ekiga 2>&1 | tee ~/gdb-ekiga.txt; GNU gdb (GDB) 7.0-ubuntu; (no debugging symbols found)...done.' What went wrong?
2010-01-16T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	sorry my router died

2010-01-16T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	you have to install the gdb versions of the main libs the program uses if i read here correctly https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSeahorse?highlight=%28gdb%29
2010-01-16T19:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	debugging seahorse and ekiga should be pretty similar both are gnome programs
2010-01-16T19:50:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	 How can I identify _ the main libs the program uses_?
2010-01-16T19:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	see the ones for seahorse as both are gnome apps both use the same main libs
2010-01-16T19:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	if you want to be 100% sure then install the gdb of the 27 libs ekiga usas
2010-01-16T20:18:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	I have done as you suggested. I still obtain: '(no debugging symbols found)...done.'
2010-01-16T20:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	:( ; maybe you can ask in other channel... #ubuntu-devel  or #ubuntu-motu
2010-01-16T20:19:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	I hope they will not beat me out there.
2010-01-16T20:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	bad past experiences there ?
2010-01-16T20:21:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	No, not in these 2 channels which you suggested. Rather, their topic is different.
2010-01-16T20:22:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	I will give it a try first in #ubuntu-bugs.
2010-01-16T20:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	bullgard5	ok; good luck
2010-01-16T20:23:00.000Z	bullgard5	erUSUL	Thank you for your help.
