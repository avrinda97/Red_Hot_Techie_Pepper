2007-01-28T16:36:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	its alot of reading but this might help you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
2007-01-28T16:37:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	in my experience airlink cards (i have 2) are not the best cards to use with linux but you CAN get them to work
2007-01-28T16:37:00.000Z	ArnottAus	cpk1	i've already read it.... unfortunately didn't help...
2007-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	ArnottAus	cpk1	the driver is present and associated, the card is associated with an ap but I still can't get interent..
2007-01-28T16:39:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	k one sec let me try to dreg up some ideas from my memory
2007-01-28T16:40:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	did you set your card to managed or ad-hoc depending on whats correct?
2007-01-28T16:40:00.000Z	ArnottAus	cpk1	i set it to managed...
2007-01-28T16:40:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	can you ping the ap and then the router and then the modem?
2007-01-28T16:42:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	and iwlist scan shows you your ap?
2007-01-28T16:47:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	thats because you gave it one =P
2007-01-28T16:49:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	just to make sure all the bases are covered do iwconfig eth1 essid youressidhere and then iwconfig eth1 channel yourchannelhere and then iwconfig eth1 ap yourapmac here
2007-01-28T16:53:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	you could also check /etc/network/intefaces to make sure everything is correct
2007-01-28T16:56:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	how close are you to the ap? as in are you close enough that you have a strong signal without a doubt
2007-01-28T16:59:00.000Z	cpk1	ArnottAus	/etc/network/intefaces make sure that has all the correct values for some reason I found back in the day iwconfig didnt always pay attention to me and i was forced to use the gui
2007-01-30T09:18:00.000Z	ArnottAus	cpk1	hi mate! you were helping me yesterday yeah?
