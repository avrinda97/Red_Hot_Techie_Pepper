2011-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	Technicus		How can I enable hardware accelerated 3D graphics support on Ubuntu 11.04 for an Intel graphics processor?
2011-10-30T07:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	for intel, turn the computer on is all you should need.
2011-10-30T07:03:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	That is not the case in this particular instance.  Do you have any troubleshooting suggestions?
2011-10-30T07:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	not really... what's happening?  what are you trying to run that's failing?
2011-10-30T07:04:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	Compiz will not start.
2011-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	from terminal does "glxinfo | grep direct" report Yes?
2011-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	I believe there is a problem with some Nvidia driver moduel loading or something.
2011-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	do you have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf?  you shouldn't, rename it to xorg.conf.OLD if you do.
2011-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	It reports a semgentation fault.
2011-10-30T07:06:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	The file is there but it is empty.
2011-10-30T07:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	do you have nvidia packages installed?  "dpkg -l | grep nvidia" for a list.
2011-10-30T07:08:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	nvidia-current is installed.
2011-10-30T07:09:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	Does that mean that it is installed?  If I look in synaptic package manager, it is not installed.
2011-10-30T07:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	if dpkg says it's installed - it's installed.  you could use "sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current" to remove it (not sure that will help mind you)
2011-10-30T07:10:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	It will not uninstall!
2011-10-30T07:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	just leave it then
2011-10-30T07:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	Technicus	sorry i don't have any other suggestions, good luck.
2011-10-30T07:11:00.000Z	Technicus	zykotick9	Ok . . . thanks.
