2007-07-24T13:25:00.000Z	bluebanana		how do i get kmz files i click on in google earth to open up in the same instance of google earth? (perhaps this has to do with the firefox browser?)
2007-07-24T13:26:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	i think you need to set firefox to open new links in the same instance
2007-07-24T13:26:00.000Z	bluebanana	TTilus	what do you mean?
2007-07-24T13:27:00.000Z	bluebanana	TTilus	i have only one firefox window.
2007-07-24T13:28:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	edit -> preferences -> tabs -> "New pages should be opened in:" - "a now tab"  *check*
2007-07-24T13:29:00.000Z	bluebanana	TTilus	yes, it's set to "new tab"
2007-07-24T13:30:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	if you do _not_ want it to be a new tab, do _not_ set it to "new tab"  ;)
2007-07-24T13:31:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	ah! sorry, it's a google earth issue
2007-07-24T13:32:00.000Z	bluebanana	TTilus	yes, i think it's a google earth issue. But i don't think it's a specific issue with google earth. It's more of an ubuntu issue.
2007-07-24T13:32:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	ff is able to chech if there's another instance running when it fires up, apparently your google earth doesn't do that, and if you can not set it up to do that you're out of luck
2007-07-24T13:33:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	no, ubuntu has absolutely no way to force prog instances to behave certain way
2007-07-24T13:34:00.000Z	bluebanana	TTilus	are you sure?
2007-07-24T13:34:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	(ie force prog to open file in existing instance, it's an issue of the specific program to handle the situation)
2007-07-24T13:34:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	yes
2007-07-24T13:36:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	behavior of a program from the point os gives control to it is solely depending on the program (not quite really, but close enough in this context)
2007-07-24T13:37:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	bruenig has the semantics right
2007-07-24T13:38:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	but back to the issue, the OS does _not_ handle anyting internal to a program if the program doesn't ask the OS to do it
2007-07-24T13:39:00.000Z	TTilus	bluebanana	apparently pretty much the first thing ff does is to check if there is another ff runnin and hand the given url to it and shut down
