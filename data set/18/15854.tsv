2005-02-07T12:23:00.000Z	no0tic		hi, as I start mathematica, windows titles and borders disappear for a while, then metacity redraws them
2005-02-07T12:23:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	metacity just died and was restarted
2005-02-07T12:24:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	is it normal?
2005-02-07T12:24:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	No.
2005-02-07T12:24:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	I use the last metacity version in hoary
2005-02-07T12:25:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	"last" as of when?
2005-02-07T12:25:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	file a bug for this?
2005-02-07T12:25:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	1:2.9.8-0ubuntu1
2005-02-07T12:26:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	that's current. Try to get a coredump, the developers tend not to have mathematica to reproduce the bug.
2005-02-07T12:26:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	how can I get a coredump?
2005-02-07T12:26:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	via gdb?
2005-02-07T12:28:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	login on the console, ulimit -c unlimited, startx.
2005-02-07T12:31:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	then?
2005-02-07T12:31:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	where can I find coredump?
2005-02-07T12:32:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	should be in your home directory
2005-02-07T12:33:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	there isn't
2005-02-07T12:33:00.000Z	no0tic	smurfix	I have to go now, see you later?
2005-02-07T12:33:00.000Z	smurfix	no0tic	depends when you get back, but I'm not the only one who knows what "core dump" means here ;-)
