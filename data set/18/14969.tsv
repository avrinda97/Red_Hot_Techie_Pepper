2005-07-13T15:17:00.000Z	subjectdenied		i removed the X directories
2005-07-13T15:17:00.000Z	subjectdenied		and reinstalled the whole x-system
2005-07-13T15:17:00.000Z	subjectdenied		for getting XKB working
2005-07-13T15:18:00.000Z	subjectdenied		so this is a known problem?
2005-07-13T15:18:00.000Z	subjectdenied		any solutions?
2005-07-13T15:19:00.000Z	subjectdenied		Xsession.error tells me that it couldn't start /usr/bin/gnomesession
2005-07-13T15:19:00.000Z	subjectdenied		yes, whatever
2005-07-13T15:19:00.000Z	subjectdenied		but i think it's not a problem created by breezy
2005-07-13T15:20:00.000Z	subjectdenied		i don't think that it's very helpful telling me that i shouldn't run breezy 3 times a minute, because it's not a breezy problem
2005-07-13T15:21:00.000Z	subjectdenied		it was generated by me
2005-07-13T15:22:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	but we're not knowledgable about breezy, so are less likely to be able to help you 'ungenerate' it
2005-07-13T15:24:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	have you asked about the problem specifically?
2005-07-13T15:24:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	log into the failsafe terminal and remove .ICEauthority
2005-07-13T15:24:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	then you should be able to log in w/o a problem
2005-07-13T15:25:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	you don't need to use sudo, the .ICEauthority belongs to you
2005-07-13T15:26:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	nautilus has been said to occasionally change that file to read-only
2005-07-13T15:26:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	you can safely delete it
2005-07-13T15:29:00.000Z	nalioth	subjectdenied	as spoken about, you shouldnt open x-things as root
