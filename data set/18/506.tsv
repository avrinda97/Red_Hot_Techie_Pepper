2012-03-01T06:52:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	It's called a circular dependency and shouldn't happen. Report it as a bug.

2012-03-01T06:54:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	How are you installing this?
2012-03-01T06:54:00.000Z	Raymond_	norc	its a .deb
2012-03-01T06:54:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	What's wrong with apt-get?
2012-03-01T06:54:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	It handles all the dependencies like magic.
2012-03-01T06:54:00.000Z	Raymond_	norc	no internet connection

2012-03-01T06:55:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	There's a tool for you, give me a sec
2012-03-01T06:57:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	Obviously there's the possibility to install from CD repositories, but there's a neater package that produces shell scripts that download the packages required, which you can put on an USB drive, execute on another machine, plug the USB drive into your old machine, and it will use that as a repository.
2012-03-01T06:58:00.000Z	norc	Raymond_	apt-zip
2012-03-01T07:00:00.000Z	Raymond_	norc	thankyou
