2009-02-09T03:19:00.000Z	ian[2]		Still having trouble using apt-get & aptitude to install subversion.. Getting "E: Couldn't find package subversion." Anyone else have any suggestions?
2009-02-09T03:20:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	Have you enabled all of your repositories?
2009-02-09T03:22:00.000Z	KevDog		Flurdy has a good post in the Ubuntu Forums about setting up a mail server
2009-02-09T03:22:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	How do I go about doing that?
2009-02-09T03:22:00.000Z	ian[2]		I'm a former Fedora user, and not familiar with Ubuntu yet..
2009-02-09T03:23:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	edit your /etc/apt/sources list and make sure multiverse and universe repositories are enabled by removing the # sign in the front of the line, and then sudo aptitude update
2009-02-09T03:24:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	running that now.. Thanks for the info.. I'm more familiar with yum than apt/aptitude... so this is all new to me..
2009-02-09T03:24:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-02-09T03:24:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	Okay -- it's working now...
2009-02-09T03:24:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	Just wanted to clarify
2009-02-09T03:25:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	I guess it was the update I needed to run.. The multiverse & universe weren't commented out...
2009-02-09T03:25:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	I wasnt sure what repository it was in, so sorry
2009-02-09T03:25:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	I'm running this as my sources.list..
2009-02-09T03:26:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	General tip to upgrade packages: sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
2009-02-09T03:26:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	Thanks.. Is aptitude similar to apt as svn is similar to cvs?
2009-02-09T03:27:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	Yes I think today aptitude and apt-get are virtually the same and interchangeable.  I think aptitude handles dependencies better (or at least it used to).  I prefer aptitude but perhaps I'm biased from the old days
2009-02-09T03:28:00.000Z	ian[2]	KevDog	Thanks again for the info.. Everything is installed and working now.. If you're ever in Oklahoma City, I owe you a beer! thanks again
2009-02-09T03:28:00.000Z	KevDog	ian[2]	Sometimes however when aptitude isn't working or giving me strange messages, I defer to apt-get and the install works!
