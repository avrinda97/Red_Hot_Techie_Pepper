2008-01-24T11:59:00.000Z	possum_		Maybe i'm asking stupid questions but i am new to linux and trying to get a feel for things....... but this is like talking to a brick wall. Thanks for all the help.
2008-01-24T12:01:00.000Z	possum_		sorry that was rude i'm just a little distressed been at my cmoputer for way too long trying to get to know how to do things
2008-01-24T12:01:00.000Z	possum_		trying to leave winblows dead and buried
2008-01-24T12:01:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	you should try installing xubuntu-desktop from the command line (apt-get install xubuntu-desktop) -- atleast that way, you can find out which exact package conflicts and try and workaround it (and report a bug to launchpad if it's a genuine bug)

2008-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	any chance you can take a screenshot of what you see?
2008-01-24T12:12:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	if you have xnest installed, you can logon a gnome-session without logging out
2008-01-24T12:19:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	hmm well - it's hard to say what has gone wrong with your install -- if you like, you can try this at the command line -- sudo aptitude install -f
2008-01-24T12:21:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	well, if there are any broken packages, it should try and sort that out
2008-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	if you feel brave, you can completely remove/purge gnome and reinstall it -- but i wouldn't recommend it generally
2008-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	possum_	un0p	it wants to remove libgsf-gnome-1-114
2008-01-24T12:26:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	ok, what happens when you try and do that?
2008-01-24T12:27:00.000Z	possum_	un0p	it removed it.... do you want me to paste terminal text? or see if gnome is working again?
2008-01-24T12:27:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	well, if you removed it without any significant difficulty, then you'd probably be better of testing gnome out now
2008-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	possum_	un0p	ok it still doing the same thing but this time i managed to take a screenshot. Still wont let me browse files or open applications all the windows stay like these ones
2008-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	un0p	possum_	ok, any chance you can upload that pic somewhere?
2008-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	possum_	un0p	I'm uploading it to rapidshare but it will take a while on my connection
2008-01-24T12:35:00.000Z	possum_	un0p	ok here http://rapidshare.de/files/38392549/Screenshot.png.html
