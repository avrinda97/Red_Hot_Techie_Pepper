2008-12-15T06:45:00.000Z	roukoun		i have a ssh connection between two pcs and Totem media player intsalled on both... when i try to launch a movie(located in server's HD) from the client i get the error: "Error: Can't open display:"  . any help appreciated
2008-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	ssh -X remote.   That will export display.  SSH must be setup for X forwarding.
2008-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	let me try... tnx
2008-12-15T06:54:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	i connected using the command: "ssh -l <username> -X <Server;s IP>" and then i gave the command: " totem /path/to/avi_file" bit i get this error: "X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication. Can't open display:"
2008-12-15T06:55:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	does the local system have xauth installed?
2008-12-15T06:57:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	yes
2008-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	after you connect, type "echo $DISPLAY <enter>".  Does it return localhost:10.0 ?
2008-12-15T07:04:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	yes
2008-12-15T07:05:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	can you run xterm when connected. (just to test)
2008-12-15T07:07:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	no... i get: "X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication <enter> xterm Xt: Can't open display: localhost:10.0"
2008-12-15T07:09:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	any idea?
2008-12-15T07:10:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	looking
2008-12-15T07:20:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	do you have a .Xauthority file in you home dir?
2008-12-15T07:22:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	yes
2008-12-15T07:23:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	try removing that file before connecting.
2008-12-15T07:23:00.000Z	joeb3_	roukoun	also make sure you have free space in your /home folder.
2008-12-15T07:27:00.000Z	roukoun	joeb3_	it worked!!!!!! thanks a lot :)
