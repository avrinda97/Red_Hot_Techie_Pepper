2005-03-08T14:43:00.000Z	vixus		Hey all.
2005-03-08T14:44:00.000Z	vixus		2 things. #1: I want to chop together a site and am too lazy to hand-code the basic layout... any nice wysiwyg tools that support css etc?
2005-03-08T14:44:00.000Z	vixus		#2: Photoshop on ubuntu.... >_<
2005-03-08T14:45:00.000Z	bronson	vixus	nvu, gimp
2005-03-08T14:46:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	Tried nvu... ugh
2005-03-08T14:47:00.000Z	bronson	vixus	I'm afraid that's as wysiwig as it gets on Linux.
2005-03-08T14:47:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	Amaya?
2005-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	bronson	vixus	doesn't supprt css last I checked.  And it's sure showing its age.
2005-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	Yeah, I've handcoded my fair share of sites... I guess I'm just bored. I want to get to the php side of things :D
2005-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	OOo?
2005-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	bronson	vixus	doubt it.  :)  Try it and tell us how it goes!
2005-03-08T14:49:00.000Z	bronson	vixus	abiword will convert to html too.
2005-03-08T14:49:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	Amaya, run by W3... I'd be surprised if it didn't support CSS ;)
2005-03-08T14:50:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	I'll touch it up by hand anyway :D
2005-03-08T14:52:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	Ok... it doesn't have a gui for css properties, but i'll try amaya.. ugh, 15.5 MB!
2005-03-08T14:52:00.000Z	bronson	vixus	I don't think you're going to like it much...  :)
2005-03-08T14:53:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	yeah
2005-03-08T14:53:00.000Z	vixus	bronson	I'll try nvu again. It was a bit slow and chunky last time though.
