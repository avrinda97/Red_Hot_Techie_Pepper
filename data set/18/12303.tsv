2006-09-28T06:09:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	what do you mean it's not a complete vm?
2006-09-28T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	server can work too
2006-09-28T06:12:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	sure, but lowering the difficulties will save him some time (inderectly your time too :)
2006-09-28T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	except Server is free, Workstation you have to buy...
2006-09-28T06:13:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	and you can create images using the server?
2006-09-28T06:13:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	yep
2006-09-28T06:13:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	sounds like a good news, I thought it was not possible :)
2006-09-28T06:14:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	but still myself i just use the player. less hassle, and i feel more comfortable knowing the stuff i have installed all comes from the ubuntu reps...
2007-01-25T11:19:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	there is a package for virtualbox... are you sure you need to compile a module if you use the package?
2007-01-25T11:19:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	I use the pkg and it says: "no driver for this kernel...trying to compile..."
2007-01-25T11:20:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	well, i suppose i didn't even notice it was compiling a module. try installing linux-headers
2007-01-25T11:20:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	i believe the virtualbox site has that information, though
2007-01-25T11:20:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	well, I _cannot_ do anything with apt or dpkg
2007-01-25T11:21:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	are you very sure? even if it keeps giving you errors, it doesn't necessarily mean it won't install packages
2007-01-25T11:21:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	I cannot reinstall it and/or remove it, attempt to install other packages ended with the same error msg
2007-01-25T11:22:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	yes, but what i'm saying is that, even if you get the error message, it doesn't *necessarily* means the new packages aren't being installed. just try a "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic" and then try again the virtualbox .deb
2007-01-25T11:22:00.000Z	LjL	Pierre	if that doesn't work, try what soundray said
2007-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	Pierre	LjL	soundray thanks, got back a clean system :)
