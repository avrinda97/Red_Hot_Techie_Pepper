2009-05-29T04:56:00.000Z	dgh1973	ruler	you can try this "apt-get install gdecrypt"
2009-05-29T04:57:00.000Z	dgh1973	ruler	have not used that, just looking at what's available in deb repo
2009-05-29T04:57:00.000Z	dgh1973	ruler	also try "apt-cache search crypt" for other possibilities

2009-05-29T05:06:00.000Z	ruler	dgh1973	what is that
2009-05-29T05:06:00.000Z	ruler	dgh1973	i cant understand
2009-05-29T05:07:00.000Z	dgh1973	ruler	but in all seriousness, if it's a boot sector virus you'll need to clean that up before installing a new os, but it should not effect ubuntu directly in most cases (there are linux viruses out there but so rare as to be non-existent)
