2010-01-22T10:28:00.000Z	Maximo		new to all this...
2010-01-22T10:28:00.000Z	Losha	Maximo	you have to install 8.04 from scratch, there is no downgrade capability....
2010-01-22T10:28:00.000Z	Maximo		What just insert cd and thats it?
2010-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Maximo		no...
2010-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Maximo		just screwed my system up
2010-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Maximo		is the only one have available at the moment
2010-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Maximo		see?
2010-01-22T10:29:00.000Z	Maximo		no more
2010-01-22T10:30:00.000Z	Losha	Maximo	yes, just put in the cd and install. The catch is, you lose any 9.10 configuration. Save your /home somewhere safe if it has anything important in it.
2010-01-22T10:30:00.000Z	Maximo		another question: suppose just wanna reinstall Karmic 9:10 how do I do that?
2010-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	Maximo	Losha	nothing important just alittle program I run thats it...
2010-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	Maximo	Losha	how do I back it up?
2010-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	Losha	Maximo	same answer, put in the cd and install. Maybe I'm missing something, because the answer seems so simple?
2010-01-22T10:33:00.000Z	Losha	Maximo	copy it somewhere: to a blank cd or dvd, or to a different disk, or to a spare partition. Depends on your hardware....
2010-01-22T10:33:00.000Z	Maximo	Losha	I upgraded it from previous version into 9:10
2010-01-22T10:34:00.000Z	Maximo	Losha	oh I see
2010-01-22T10:36:00.000Z	Losha	Maximo	it's ok to ask beginner questions here...
