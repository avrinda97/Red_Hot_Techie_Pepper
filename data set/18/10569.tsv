2006-11-15T12:09:00.000Z	ademan_	specialbuddy	pretty sure it is
2006-11-15T12:10:00.000Z	ademan_	specialbuddy	did you mount it first?
2006-11-15T12:12:00.000Z	ademan_	specialbuddy	so chmod whever_the_mount_point_is   says what?
2006-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	specialbuddy	ademan_	is the mount point in /media

2006-11-15T12:15:00.000Z	ademan_	specialbuddy	no error code or anything?
2006-11-15T12:16:00.000Z	ademan_	specialbuddy	try doing it as root (sudo chmod u+r etc )
2006-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	specialbuddy	ademan_	do you think it has something to do with it being a hotplug device
2006-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	ademan_	specialbuddy	not if the fat partition is on the same drive
2006-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	specialbuddy	ademan_	well maybe I should just go all fat32 then
