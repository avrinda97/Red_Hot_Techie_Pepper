2012-01-17T05:30:00.000Z	aBound		Next time I'll know to buy a smaller laptop.
2012-01-17T05:31:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	next time buy a real computer, a desktop
2012-01-17T05:31:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	HA! Saying this isn't a real computer.
2012-01-17T05:32:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	?
2012-01-17T05:32:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	Intel quad-core 2.20Ghz processor, 16GBs of 1333Mhz RAM, nVidia 1.5GB 580M GTX, Ubuntu 11.10 64-Bit, Intel Centrino Ultimate-M, Intel 80GB SSD.
2012-01-17T05:33:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	16GBs of ram? you gonna use all that?
2012-01-17T05:33:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	your cpu is lacking
2012-01-17T05:34:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	Varies future-proofing and if I intend to use heavy IDEs like eclipse and the likes. I may never use it now but it'll eventually be used in the long-term.
2012-01-17T05:34:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	ahhh, why didn't you put a 16 core in?
2012-01-17T05:35:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	As more and more OS's are starting to use more RAM and needing a better processor.
2012-01-17T05:35:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	As far as I know they don't have 16-cores for laptops.
2012-01-17T05:35:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	more and more OS's ? such as?........windows?
2012-01-17T05:36:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	Varies seeing as people might tend to use virtual machines on their Linux box or whatever else they do. Someone doing rendering work in Blender or blah.
2012-01-17T05:37:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	i get tired of updating
2012-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	Mr-Linux	aBound	soon as u get everything working right, time to update and do it again, lol
2012-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	aBound	Mr-Linux	I agree seeing as you already have everything setup the way you want it. But figures using Unity 5.0 will be stable enough to use and keeping 12.04 LTS might be a keeper.
