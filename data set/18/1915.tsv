2010-12-17T14:12:00.000Z	Ileden		Admittedly, i did a stupid reinstall (installed fresh _over_ an existing install) but I didn't have separate partition for /home and wanted to preserve it. Feel free to not provide support, but please don't eat me alive :)
2010-12-17T14:12:00.000Z	Ileden		Anyway, what I did reasearch about it, that should just simply wipe out the existing system folders. and it did. and the system did boot at first, one time. But now it doesnt.
2010-12-17T14:14:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	not sure if i can help, but do you see a grub menu when you boot?
2010-12-17T14:15:00.000Z	Ileden	rigved	yes, but that's where it gets stuck
2010-12-17T14:15:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	does recovery mode work?
2010-12-17T14:16:00.000Z	Ileden	rigved	I cannot do anything in the grub menu
2010-12-17T14:16:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	when you did the fresh install again, did you delete the earlier partitions?
2010-12-17T14:17:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	is that the recovery mode?
2010-12-17T14:19:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	ok. or you need to install again. format all the partitions and then then install
2010-12-17T14:19:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	all the best!
2010-12-17T14:19:00.000Z	Ileden	rigved	problem is, i have /home with some data i'd not rather lose, and no big enough free backup media
2010-12-17T14:20:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	do you have a free partition?
2010-12-17T14:20:00.000Z	Ileden	rigved	and /home is not on a separate parition (stupid me)
2010-12-17T14:20:00.000Z	Ileden	rigved	no, the disk is pretty much full.
2010-12-17T14:21:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	if the data is important to you, then you need to free up some space somewhere and copy the home folder there. try borrowing an external hdd or usb stick from someone.
2010-12-17T14:22:00.000Z	Ileden	rigved	yeah, thats what im afraid of. and that'll take time.
2010-12-17T14:23:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	you should wait. better late than losing all your data, right?
2010-12-17T15:46:00.000Z	rigved	Ileden	also, you can check playdeb.net for Debian games
