2011-01-07T03:25:00.000Z	ajwill		okay that may have worked!
2011-01-07T03:25:00.000Z	ajwill		but now that that's worked, another problem has arisen
2011-01-07T03:25:00.000Z	ajwill		the WINXP partition I mounted earlier
2011-01-07T03:25:00.000Z	ajwill		its mounting at startup
2011-01-07T03:26:00.000Z	ajwill		however in places
2011-01-07T03:27:00.000Z	ajwill		okay, again in one line, I got that partition mounting at startup, but under the "Places" menu, there's two WINXP options, one takes me to the mounted partition, the other says it cannot mount it, how would I get rid of the second option?
2011-01-07T03:28:00.000Z	shcherbak	ajwill	fdisk -l, how many xp is there?
2011-01-07T03:28:00.000Z	ajwill	shcherbak	only one xp
2011-01-07T03:29:00.000Z	shcherbak	ajwill	have you mounted xp manually?
2011-01-07T03:29:00.000Z	ajwill	shcherbak	yes, I ran "mount /dev/sda1 /media/WINXP"
2011-01-07T03:30:00.000Z	shcherbak	ajwill	can you cd to /media/WINXP and ls?
2011-01-07T03:31:00.000Z	ajwill	shcherbak	okay, just my windows XP files, program files, documents and settings, etc
2011-01-07T03:31:00.000Z	shcherbak	ajwill	what is second fat/ntfs in fdisk -l?
2011-01-07T03:32:00.000Z	ajwill	shcherbak	there are none, fdisk -l only shows my one windows partition, its in the places menu (top left by default) that there's two WINXP's
2011-01-07T03:33:00.000Z	shcherbak	ajwill	god knows, check fstab, it may be result of remounting, what happen if you logout/login?
2011-01-07T03:34:00.000Z	ajwill	shcherbak	already have, its not remounting, and I've logged in/out about 3 times in the past 20 mins and it's persisted
2011-01-07T03:37:00.000Z	shcherbak	ajwill	i my guess nautilus is responsible, what if you umount xp?
2011-01-07T03:38:00.000Z	ajwill	shcherbak	okay gunna try that
