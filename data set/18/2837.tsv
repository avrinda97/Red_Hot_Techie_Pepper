2010-02-09T19:42:00.000Z	h2o0		Recently I've installed ubuntu 9.10 32-bits, but I've no sound :s what can I do?
2010-02-09T19:43:00.000Z	h2o0		alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
2010-02-09T19:43:00.000Z	h2o0		lspci |grep audio returns nothing for me
2010-02-09T19:43:00.000Z	h2o0		what's wrong?
2010-02-09T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	h2o0	lspci |grep -i audio

2010-02-09T19:46:00.000Z	h2o0		so, how to enable sound?
2010-02-09T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	h2o0	that seems to be the dvb card (TV) post your whole lspci output

2010-02-09T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	h2o0	is maybe the onboard audio disabled in the bios?
2010-02-09T19:48:00.000Z	h2o0	erUSUL	nope
2010-02-09T19:49:00.000Z	h2o0		works fine until reinstall ubuntu again
2010-02-09T19:50:00.000Z	erUSUL		!screenshot | cmp
2010-02-09T19:50:00.000Z	h2o0	erUSUL	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory  --> seems alsamixer don't load
2010-02-09T19:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	h2o0	if there is no sound card it is hardly a surprise
2010-02-09T19:50:00.000Z	h2o0		then what should I do?
2010-02-09T19:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	h2o0	i really dunno the sound card should show up in lspci. re-check bios settings
