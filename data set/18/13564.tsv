2005-12-07T06:38:00.000Z	steigweis		does anybody use photoshop and dreamweaver under linux? and how?
2005-12-07T06:39:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	you'll end up running a full windows under linux with vmware
2005-12-07T06:40:00.000Z	steigweis	czr	with an up-to-date sytem. is that fast enough?
2005-12-07T06:40:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	I've been using vmware for many years now
2005-12-07T06:40:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	it's fast enough for my needs ;-)
2005-12-07T06:40:00.000Z	steigweis	czr	so you have linux and windows the same time
2005-12-07T06:40:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	no. I run other stuff under vmware. I don't use windows
2005-12-07T06:40:00.000Z	czr		but I've run windows under vmware at other locations
2005-12-07T06:41:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	runs better in vmware than on hardware (windows that is)
2005-12-07T06:41:00.000Z	steigweis	czr	aha, you dont have to run windows under vmware to rum ps..
2005-12-07T06:41:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	you have to. I don't have to since I don't use ps :-)
2005-12-07T06:41:00.000Z	steigweis		crazy shit
2005-12-07T06:42:00.000Z	steigweis		ok, i will have a look...
2005-12-07T06:42:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	vmware workstation is the version suitable for you
2005-12-07T06:42:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	the other ones are meant for server use
2005-12-07T06:42:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	they are also much more expensive than workstation. you can get 30 day eval for all of them though
2005-12-07T06:42:00.000Z	steigweis		ok, thanks.. so there is no disadvantage left on linux
2005-12-07T06:43:00.000Z	czr	steigweis	technically you'll still be running windows though, just trough vmware ;-)
