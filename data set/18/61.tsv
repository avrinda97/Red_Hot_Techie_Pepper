2012-10-23T13:44:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	did you try logging into the router and checking blocked ports?
2012-10-23T13:46:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	i could not connect to the router for some reason.. The router is not mine (so idont know details - also i am not good with these things), but  why would i have blocked ports? i mean, i could connect to the internet perfectly ok, and before restarting the laptop i was on a vpn with the office's pc...
2012-10-23T13:47:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	you just said that you couldn't load webpages
2012-10-23T13:48:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	sorry.. before restarting i had webpages, vpn, eveything.. after restarting laptop i had only skype, torrents, but no webpages etc
2012-10-23T13:49:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	i guess you can't read. Check. For. Blocked. Ports.
2012-10-23T13:51:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	is it possible to connect with torrent client, or skype but not with browser due to closed ports? they use different ports? how can i check that?:)
2012-10-23T13:51:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	: is it with the use of nmap?
2012-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	a ok.. thanx.. just in case it is a ports issue, how can i change the settings (open closed ports)? now i am at the office, so idont have access to my homes laptop, so i will do these things later today... Also, could this be a result of the cisco client(plus the patches) that i installed?
2012-10-23T13:54:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	you have to login to the router, either via telnet, ssh, or the web interface and check to make sure everything is squared away, and yes it could be the result of that
2012-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	is it a modem/router combo
2012-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	just router
2012-10-23T13:56:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	plug directly into the modem and see if you can connect to webpages etc
2012-10-23T13:58:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	also, i suppose that the fact that i cant ping any ip could be due to the same issue (port closed)? :)
2012-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	filippos	bin_bash	thanx a lot for your help... i ll give it a try!!!
2012-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	bin_bash	filippos	i meant directly from the modem
