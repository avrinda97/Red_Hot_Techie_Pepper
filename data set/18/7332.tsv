2011-11-20T09:11:00.000Z	zizoo		But separate, so I can reinstall either OS if I screw something up....
2011-11-20T09:11:00.000Z	zizoo		So technically, it is another partition altogether, actually.
2011-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	zizoo		Is there any way to remount my data partition so that I can execute .jar files, perchance?
2011-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	zizoo		Oh, I was trying to do something else, come to think of it. x__x... I was trying to "open with..." Java Sun VM. But it doesn't work for the terminal command.
2011-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	zizoo		Says "Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute"
2011-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	zizoo		Attempting to change the file to be executable from the properties window does not work. It unchecks it as soon as I check it.
2011-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	zizoo		It works fine on my linux partition. I doubt Java is the problem.
2011-11-20T09:16:00.000Z	zizoo		.__. ... I'd have to move a lot of files to my linux partition, which is supposed to be big enough for just linux essentials, then keep most programs on the third partition. Am I going to have to redo my setup?
2011-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	zizoo		It is still on the separate partition.
2011-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	zizoo		That is, I have a Windows partition and a Data partition, the latter being where I keep anything I want to use with both Linux and Windows. ^^;;;;
2011-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	is the file stored on an NTFS partition?
2011-11-20T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	if its NTFS then you will need to make the partition mark all the files executable when it's mounted
2011-11-20T09:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	its not dangerous

2011-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	you can add it so that it mounts with those options at boot, you will need to create a new folder to mount to
2011-11-20T10:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	why not copy the app to your linux partition?
2012-02-22T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	I'd ask in #bash  they got mad skills
2012-06-13T03:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zizoo	wget should be able to do that
