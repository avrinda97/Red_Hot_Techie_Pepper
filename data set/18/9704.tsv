2007-03-10T17:39:00.000Z	LordLimecat		Anyone know how to get the Logitech laser mice (g5, G7) back buttons working?
2007-03-10T17:40:00.000Z	LordLimecat		also, having backspace go back a page in firefox would be nice :(
2007-03-10T17:40:00.000Z	LordLimecat		ah!
2007-03-10T17:41:00.000Z	LordLimecat		and the mice? i found a howto, but it was for earlier mice, and it said "you will need to change things for g5", and did not elaborate
2007-03-10T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	I wrote a guide for the mx1000 on the wiki, it should be very similar
2007-03-10T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MX1000Mouse  what do you mean by hex code?
2007-03-10T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	you can figure out the button numbers using 'xev'
2007-03-10T17:44:00.000Z	LordLimecat	jrib	it was a different guide
2007-03-10T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	all you have to do is setup evdev and then use xbindkeys (or something similar) to bind the keys accordingly
2007-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	I have no idea what the problem is, I just know it "doesn't work"
2007-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	LordLimecat	jrib	from a comment you made earlier, i take it you dont think sudo gedit /etc/somefile is a good idea?
2007-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	no, that's fine.  Which comment?
2007-03-10T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	oh, yeah, it's not the kind of think you should be doing so often that typing sudo is a burden imo
2007-03-10T06:44:00.000Z	LordLimecat	jrib	you seem to be the expert on things here
2007-03-10T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	nah, not really
2007-03-21T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	bruenig told you how, I think you missed it
2007-04-14T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	I think every 10-15 minutes is fine, there are other support options too:
2007-04-14T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	LordLimecat	that didn't used to say that...
