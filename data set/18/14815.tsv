2005-06-07T12:10:00.000Z	creyton		im having a error pop up everytime i log onto ubuntu this is what it says: Could not look up internet address for ubuntu.
2005-06-07T12:10:00.000Z	creyton		This will prevent GNOME from operating correctly.
2005-06-07T12:10:00.000Z	creyton		It may be possible to correct the problem by adding ubuntu to the file /etc/hosts.
2005-06-07T12:11:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	someone hosed /etc/hosts
2005-06-07T12:11:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	the first line should say: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost ubuntu
2005-06-07T12:11:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	it's a file
2005-06-07T12:13:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	I told you
2005-06-07T12:14:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	I'd be looking at why you don't have one, though
2005-06-07T12:15:00.000Z	creyton	bob2	anyways i cant get sudo -s to work so i can edit the file any suggestions?
2005-06-07T12:15:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	reboot, select "recovery" from the grub menu
2005-06-07T12:15:00.000Z	creyton	bob2	sorry im new at this
2005-06-07T12:16:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	I understand, just try to be more careful :)
2005-06-07T12:16:00.000Z	creyton	bob2	im tryng...ive spent 3-4 hours trying to figure out wpa for my network
2005-06-07T12:18:00.000Z	creyton	bob2	sorry to bother you, but im not familiar with the recovery mode and how to add a line to hosts file
2005-06-07T12:19:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	did you reboot into recovery mode yet?
2005-06-07T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	which text editor have you been using?
2005-06-07T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	ok, try "nano /etc/hosts" once you reboot
2005-06-07T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	creyton	it will display all the key bindings on the screen for you
