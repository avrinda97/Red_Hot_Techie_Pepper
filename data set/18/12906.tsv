2006-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	is this the first account you created during install?

2006-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	Gunner112k	_jason	"kevin"
2006-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	well, that means you are not in the admin group
2006-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	did you do an expert install by any chance?  and do you have access to root?
2006-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	Gunner112k	_jason	I do have access to root
2006-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	you created a password manually after the install?
2006-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	Gunner112k	_jason	yeah
2006-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	ok su to root and do 'adduser kevin admin'
2006-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	'sudo echo hi'
2006-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	okay, you amy want to add yourself to the adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner  groups as well
2006-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	s/amy/may
2006-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	Gunner112k	_jason	is the "save configuration" option in the logoff  screen important for my user settings?
2006-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	no, I think that just saves what programs you ahve open and then opens them up next time you login
2006-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	_jason	Gunner112k	did you put the '.' ?
