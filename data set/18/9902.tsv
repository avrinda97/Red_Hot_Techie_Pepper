2007-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	makuseru		desktop sharing
2007-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	you NEED to have a server running on the other computer
2007-02-08T08:16:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	using VNC?
2007-02-08T08:21:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	you need to tell them to run the server program. They have to have it first. You should use VNC.
2007-02-08T08:21:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	vnc is the protocol. There are different programs for using it. Ubuntu has both a server and client built in for it.
2007-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	it's built into ubuntu. The viewer is under Apps>Internet>Terminal Server client. Select VNC for protocol. The server is under System>Preferences>Remote Desktop. There should be a VNC server for Knoppix, too, just not sure what it's called.
2007-02-08T08:25:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	ubotu's a bot.
2007-02-08T08:25:00.000Z	makuseru	cables	that was random
2007-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	i thought you misspelled ubotu and said abotu... i guess it was really "about"
2007-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	what works one way and not the other?
2007-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	what OS is the other computer?
2007-02-08T08:29:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	you need to set up a vnc server on the knoppix box
2007-02-08T08:30:00.000Z	makuseru	cables	how do i do that
2007-02-08T08:30:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	i don't know... this is an Ubuntu channel not a Knoppix channel.
2007-02-08T08:32:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	try #knoppix
2007-02-08T09:14:00.000Z	cables	makuseru	like I said, this is not a Knoppix channel. #knoppix
