2005-06-02T16:28:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	HT is now disabled on smp kernel
2005-06-02T16:29:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	well doesn't that just suck.
2005-06-02T16:29:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	I've noticed little difference since the patch was applied
2005-06-02T16:30:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	funny, my system monitor still shows 2 cpus.
2005-06-02T16:31:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	have you applied the security patch?
2005-06-02T16:32:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	I am totally up to date, as far as I can tell (have done apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade just today).
2005-06-02T16:33:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	I've just checked and so does mine, hmmm... puzzling... the security patch definitely said it was going to disable hyperthreading
2005-06-02T16:34:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	It's a puzzler.
2005-06-02T16:42:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	I've checked my grub entries to see if HT is specified explicitly and it isn't. Maybe the load is shared across the virtual processors without any performance gain would be my guess now.
2005-06-02T16:43:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	HT isn't mentioned in grub, other than the "smp" at the end of the kernel name.
2005-06-02T16:48:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	yeah, I read in the security update, with a warning not too, that you can re-enable hyperthreading explicitly I think it's off by default now
2005-06-02T16:53:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	I read it in synaptic
2005-06-02T16:56:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	it was before the installation
2005-06-02T16:56:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	in the terminal?
2005-06-02T16:57:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	synaptic dialog box
2005-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	yeah, I would have expected to see just one cpu now
2005-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	thingfish	anto9us	if hyperthreading were disabled by default, that is all you would see.
2005-06-02T05:02:00.000Z	anto9us	thingfish	see /usr/share/doc/linux-headers-2.6.10-5/changelog.Debian
