2008-05-04T09:03:00.000Z	CSHARPER2		Is there a compatible Ubuntu/Linux TV turner with cablecard support? If there are options is there any consensus on what the best one might be?
2008-05-04T09:03:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	there is only one cablecard device in existence period (afaik) and no its not linux compatible
2008-05-04T09:04:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	its the ATI one that you have to buy with a new Windows Media Center machine
2008-05-04T09:04:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	the cablecard company (forgot who) apparently will not license it to be allowed to be sold outside of the special media center pc
2008-05-04T09:04:00.000Z	CSHARPER2		Calc: Ok, that was the only one I could find searching.
2008-05-04T09:05:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	yea i think that is the only one available
2008-05-04T09:06:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	looks like you can find them on ebay though, so if you want to write a driver ;-)
2008-05-04T09:07:00.000Z	CSHARPER2	calc	I guess the only thing to do is waste years on a lawsuit so the cable companies will comply with the law :)
2008-05-04T09:08:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	which law would that be?
2008-05-04T09:08:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	i'm pretty sure they aren't violating any law by requiring the hardware that uses cablecards to be unhackable, there are already laws about cable theft as well
2008-05-04T09:09:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	making it not available for sell outside of media center pc's keeps the likelyhood of it getting hacked pretty low
2008-05-04T09:09:00.000Z	CSHARPER2	calc	There are FCC regulations that require the cable companies to allow third party devices access to their programming.
2008-05-04T09:09:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	thats what cablecard is for.....
2008-05-04T09:10:00.000Z	CSHARPER2	calc	but does not allow it, if it is not possible to use it.
2008-05-04T09:10:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	just under linux, i doubt you will get far with any lawsuit :)
2008-05-04T09:11:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	i'm pretty sure the open access stuff wrt cablecard was written such that the stuff using it has to be 'approved'
2008-05-04T09:11:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	so a driver for the ati hardware might not even be legal
2008-05-04T09:12:00.000Z	calc	CSHARPER2	er an open driver i mean
