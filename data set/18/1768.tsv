2011-05-18T13:46:00.000Z	irreverant		let me explain it like this, i would like to use my cell phone as a live cd for a linux distro so that when im at a buddies comp i can use nix instead of windows./

2011-05-18T13:51:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	FAT, FAT32 and ext2 should work for a LiveCD-like boot partition if you're using Unetbootin.
2011-06-13T13:14:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	I suggest you replace that with Dropbox and forget about it like a bad nightmare
2011-06-13T13:16:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	that bad really?
2011-06-13T13:16:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	Well, I didn't like it back when I tried
2011-06-13T13:17:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	when did you try it?
2011-06-13T13:17:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	10.04
2011-06-13T13:18:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	the only thing i don't like about it is that I can specify folders to sync, i have to duplicate files or move the entire directory in windows to the sync folder.
2011-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	can i play music from dropbox?
2011-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	Well, a dropbox is just a folder anywhere you want. So yes
2011-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	It's just synced to the net
2011-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	checking it out now, no fee at all?
2011-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	2GB free
2011-06-13T13:22:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	Additional space purchasable
2011-06-13T13:22:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	but do I have to cache the files on my phone or can i stream music directly from the dropbox servers?
2011-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	theadmin	irreverant	You can as long as it's in your Public folder, then you can just feed the link to your phone lol
2011-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	irreverant	theadmin	yeah I didn't think about that. i can just tell the media player to play from the url.
