2011-05-29T00:51:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf		My maximize, close and minimize buttons dosent show. I cant even see the bar where you can rightclick and (for example) choose option "Always on top"
2011-05-29T00:52:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf		Besides if I have 3 Firefox windows open and try to close just one, they all shuts down. And my cursor is an X all the time. It dosent kill anything though
2011-05-29T00:53:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	CyborgSmurf	You have the panel at the top of your screen?
2011-05-29T00:54:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	yeah Ive got it but not on windows
2011-05-29T00:56:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	btw, this happend while trying to solve the skype issue (which now for some reason I cant paste or type anything in the terminal)
2011-05-29T00:59:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	something happend while trying to enable effects... it couldnt be enabled but I got my cursor back...
2011-05-29T01:00:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	its done
2011-05-29T01:01:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	everything seems to be back to normal
2011-05-29T01:01:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	CyborgSmurf	Then have no worries - that was a Compiz crash
2011-05-29T01:01:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	thank you so much
2011-05-29T01:03:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	CyborgSmurf	The more 'complicated' way to resolve that issue would have bee have you open up a terminal and run: metacity --replace
2011-05-29T01:04:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	whats next step then?
2011-05-29T01:05:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	yes
2011-05-29T01:05:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	but what about the metacity --replace command?
2011-05-29T01:07:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	oh, okay
2011-05-29T01:09:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	okay... is that a compiz bug or something?
2011-05-29T01:11:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	I believe you are right. Ive read alot about crashes that has to do with compiz
2011-05-29T01:13:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	BorgTK2001	I guess machines crashes because human is not perfect ;)
