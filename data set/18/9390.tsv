2007-04-26T10:57:00.000Z	sumigamer		hey can anybody tell me how XGL on Ubuntu would perform on an Intel 915G graphics chipset, with 1Gb RAM. Or is AIGLX better???
2007-04-26T10:57:00.000Z	gpm	sumigamer	i heard aiglx is better...
2007-04-26T10:57:00.000Z	sumigamer	gpm	what do you use??
2007-04-26T10:57:00.000Z	gpm	sumigamer	xgl, but card's pretty old
2007-04-26T10:58:00.000Z	sumigamer	gpm	are AIGLX and XGL effects the same??
2007-04-26T10:58:00.000Z	gpm	sumigamer	i think so, but i'm not an expert
2007-04-26T10:59:00.000Z	sumigamer	gpm	do you know the approximate total size of the files that are to be downloaded for enabling XGL or AIGLX in Edgy???
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	gpm	sumigamer	well i think aiglx is already with the xorg server, and xgl...well...i'm not sure
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	gpm		it's pretty small though
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	gpm		why, short on space?
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	sumigamer		no , short on bandwidth
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	gpm		oh
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	gpm		well, if you apt-get install xserver-xgl...it will say how much it has to download before it starts
2007-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	gpm		and you don't have to commit
2007-04-26T11:02:00.000Z	sumigamer	gpm	do you know the difference between the two??
2007-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	gpm	sumigamer	no...but you should follow the wiki or whatever to enable compiz...if that's what you're trying to do
2007-04-26T11:06:00.000Z	sumigamer	gpm	thanks for the help, i will be looking in #ubuntu-effects for my queries...
2007-04-26T11:06:00.000Z	gpm	sumigamer	good luck
