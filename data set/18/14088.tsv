2005-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	houman_zhu		hi there, i just did an apt-upgrade and it updated my kernel and it broke my wireless card :|
2005-09-15T06:22:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	what kind of card
2005-09-15T06:25:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	some of the drivers are well supported - i've been doing well with atheros and prism 2.5
2005-09-15T06:26:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	probably changed module configuration
2005-09-15T06:29:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	there are a lot of little numbers after the kernel version
2005-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	how can i check it? uname -r just gives me the first 3 numbers
2005-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	cat /proc/version
2005-09-15T06:32:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	cool, there is so much info in that proc thingie that i dont knwo about :) thanks, its a Linux version 2.6.10-5-686 (buildd@terranova) (gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5 -8ubuntu2))
2005-09-15T06:32:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	me too
2005-09-15T06:33:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	there is more going on under the hood than anybody could really grasp
2005-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	well the gurus must know, the linux geeks knwo for sure, i knwo a couple of them in my school, they knwo alot,
2005-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	but there is too much for anyone
2005-09-15T06:35:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	give up taking baths and showers, it will make more time for compiling kernels
2005-09-15T06:36:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	i have seen people who knwo more than you can imagine, but for that you gotta be single and sitting in th basement 24/7 , which mot people cant afford to do, if i spend more than couple of horus in front of my ubuntu my gf will start yelling
2005-09-15T06:36:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	if you have a config file compiling your kernel is not too hard
2005-09-15T06:37:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	the hard part is the manual kernel, but if you start with an existing config file the rest is easy
2005-09-15T06:37:00.000Z	tarvid_	houman_zhu	for years Mandrake shipped a config file which did not match the kernel binary
2005-09-15T06:39:00.000Z	houman_zhu	tarvid_	well whats the use of a config file really if you cant recompile it or something, i mean if you dont have the source who cares whats in the config file? im not sure really, maybe other programs need to look it up for stuff
