2008-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	always install Windows, then Linux
2008-02-17T18:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	so do you have data w/ onj the linux partitions you need backedup, or is it a new install?
2008-02-17T18:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	ok, so insert your XP disk, install XP, give the entire hard drive to XP...
2008-02-17T18:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	once you've installed XP, boot your ubuntu CD, and partition the hard drive, and install Ubuntu
2008-02-17T18:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	well, thats not a Linux issue..
2008-02-17T18:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	is your bios set to look at the CD Drive first?
2008-02-17T18:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	you just now clearly stated your problem, the issue isn't with linux
2008-02-17T18:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	your problem is either 1.  You aren't set to boot the CD Drive first(which is unlikely if you used it to install Ubuntu)
2008-02-17T18:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	or 2, your XP CD is bad(seems more likely)
2008-02-17T18:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	linux being installed on the hard drive, has no relevance to being able to boot your XP cd
2008-02-17T18:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	if you're not going to listen, stop talking to me
2008-02-17T18:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	have yout ried restarting your computer with the XP Cd in the drive?
2008-02-17T18:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	then for the 5th time.. its one of two things.. 1.  Your CD is bad, or 2.  Your system is not set to boot from CD first.. I guess 3 could be, your CD Drive is bad.
2008-02-17T18:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sant	linux has nothing to do with any o the above.
