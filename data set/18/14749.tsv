2005-06-18T13:07:00.000Z	goye2cz		Has anyone installed Skype? I'm having trouble finding the libqt3c102-mt package.
2005-06-18T13:09:00.000Z	hornsby	goye2cz	yea, were looking at wrong package
2005-06-18T13:12:00.000Z	goye2cz	hornsby	or bob2: I did this yesterday, and all went well. today, I'm not finding it. Under Applications/system tools/ add-remove programs, I clicked the advanced tab. I got synaptic and looked through the list. I don't see any of those.
