2005-03-02T07:45:00.000Z	rapha		Hi all
2005-03-02T07:47:00.000Z	rapha		I still got no sound with the latest Hoary. The mixer shows some very unlikely things, and only the way from line in to speakers seems to work. No DSP at all.
2005-03-02T07:48:00.000Z	rapha		Were there any significant changes in ALSA in Hoary during the last days?
2005-03-02T07:48:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	polypaudio is used
2005-03-02T07:50:00.000Z	rapha	da_bon_bon	That can't be the problem. Even with a disabled soundserver it doesn't work. Not even "cat blah.wav > /dev/dsp" produces any sound. And yes, ALL mixer channels ARE turned up and unmuted.
2005-03-02T07:51:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	lets go step-by-step,
2005-03-02T07:51:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2005-03-02T07:51:00.000Z	rapha	da_bon_bon	ubuntu-desktop has just been upgraded by an apt-get dist-upgrade.
2005-03-02T07:52:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	ok.. are u /sure/ its installed ?
2005-03-02T07:53:00.000Z	rapha	da_bon_bon	Yes, version 0.32 of ubuntu-desktop is installed. (This is also a pretty fresh installation of hoary directly off one of the nightly built CD images, it has no additional repositories enabled)
2005-03-02T07:53:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	ok.
2005-03-02T07:53:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	wait a sec.
2005-03-02T07:54:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	in mulimedia systems selector, select esd for both sink and inpur
2005-03-02T07:55:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	then, go here : http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2005-February/022862.html
2005-03-02T07:55:00.000Z	rapha	da_bon_bon	second...
2005-03-02T07:58:00.000Z	rapha	da_bon_bon	Okay, this helped to make the test ouput function in the multimedia systems selector _look_ like it worked, but there is no _audible_ output. Not even cat'ing a file to /dev/dsp produces any of that.
2005-03-02T07:58:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	rapha	cating a file cant ever work
2005-03-02T07:59:00.000Z	rapha	da_bon_bon	It has worked ever since I started using Linux in 1996
