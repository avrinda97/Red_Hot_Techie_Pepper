2005-12-31T15:50:00.000Z	LCamel_		hello ... is it possible to tell "make-kpkg" to use gcc 4.0 ?
2005-12-31T15:51:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	i'm willing to guess make-kpkg has nothing to do with gcc... but i may be wrong, either way, CC=gcc-4.0 and export CC prior to make-kpkg should do the trick
2005-12-31T15:52:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	thanks ... i have tried "CC=gcc-4.0 sudo make-kpkg --initrd ..." but it keeps asking for gcc-3.4
2005-12-31T15:53:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	erm, i guess you've done export ... right?
2005-12-31T15:54:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	yes ..
2005-12-31T15:54:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	you trying to compile a kernel?
2005-12-31T15:54:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	duh, disregard that please
2005-12-31T15:54:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	yes, i'm going to compile 2.6.12
2005-12-31T15:54:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	why not compile using gcc-3.4 tho?
2005-12-31T15:56:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	because 4.0 is right there ... and Debian.src.changelog has mentioned some changes for compiling under gcc4.0
2005-12-31T15:56:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	i see. i'll try looking around for an answer to that, but cant say i can help with that mate, sorry :)
2005-12-31T15:57:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	i'm considering create a symbolic link for gcc-3.4 to gcc-4.0, but i'm afraid it is a bad workaround
2005-12-31T15:57:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	thank you very much !! :D
2005-12-31T15:57:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	yes, sounds like calling for trouble :)
2005-12-31T15:57:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	np mate
2005-12-31T16:02:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	export MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-4.0" works !
2005-12-31T16:13:00.000Z	Determinist	LCamel_	i'm glad, i was just looking at something similar :)
2005-12-31T16:15:00.000Z	LCamel_	Determinist	:D
