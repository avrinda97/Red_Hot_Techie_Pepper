2006-11-02T13:49:00.000Z	scheuri	scamboy	whatever you answer is....BACKUP is always important! never do something big without backup!
2006-11-02T13:50:00.000Z	scamboy	scheuri	5.10 to breezy....my documents, files...will i loose it??
2006-11-02T13:50:00.000Z	scheuri	scamboy	5.10 is breezy....actually...but you should not lose anything if you make an upgrade (and not a new install), but BACK IT UP anyway!
2006-11-02T13:51:00.000Z	scamboy	scheuri	means download binary update to archive and not to cd right??
2006-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	scheuri	scamboy	yes...you log in to your machine and to a upgrade via internet and not downloading the CD and install from new...
2006-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	scheuri	scamboy	but still...make a backup of your data!!
2006-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	scamboy	scheuri	thanks...where u frm? japan?
2006-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	scheuri	scamboy	why? no...
2006-11-02T13:54:00.000Z	scheuri	scamboy	without read ads? sorry...did not get that...however....backup your data and then modify your sources.list from whatever release you have to the next and make an "sudo aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade"
