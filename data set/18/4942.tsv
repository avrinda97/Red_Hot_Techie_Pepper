2009-05-10T18:28:00.000Z	phoe6		I get this error, when I try to remove a package: "The package 'printers-bangalore' is in an inconsistent state and needs to be reinstalled, but no archive can be found for it. Please reinstall the package manually or remove it from the system."
2009-05-10T18:28:00.000Z	phoe6		how I handle this?
2009-05-10T18:28:00.000Z	phoe6		I want to remove it from the system
2009-05-10T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	that package is not an ubuntu created package
2009-05-10T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	speak to the people who created it
2009-05-10T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	speak to him then
2009-05-10T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	speak to your sys admin, so he can verify how it will effect your system
2009-05-10T18:32:00.000Z	phoe6	ikonia	I have unziped the package and i know that it wont affect my system. I am trying to do it myself ( to learn) and the reason I installed package was to setup the printer.
2009-05-10T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	still best to speak to your sys admin, I'm sure he will teach you but teach you safley
2009-05-10T18:35:00.000Z	phoe6	ikonia	Sorry to bother you;please dont let me in rounds. If you know the howto, please share;  there should be reason as why I am trying so hard.. :) you get it?
2009-05-10T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	your system administrator is the best way - if there is a reason you won't speak to your system administrator can't help you please tell me
2009-05-10T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	ssl headers have nothing to do with this package
2009-05-10T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	ok - so then it DOES have implications to other packages - speak to your system administrator
2009-05-10T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	you will potentially do serious damage to your system playing with a custom pacakge that has dependencies on other pacakges
2009-05-10T18:42:00.000Z	phoe6	ikonia	I am not worried about that. :) I am kind of surprised at your send me in so many rounds.  ikonia; I am a programmer,  who can try out stuffs and experiement too. This package was a experiement which has failed; and I am trying to undo it..
2009-05-10T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	the package should not just be blindly removed if it has dependencies on other packages, hence why you should talk to your systems administrator
2009-05-10T19:04:00.000Z	phoe6	ikonia	are you there?
2009-05-10T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	phoe6	yes
