2006-10-20T11:25:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	note i still have one problem, when i boot, Xorg doesnt start, but i can start it easily by just logging into a virtual terminal and goign "startx"
2006-10-20T11:26:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	still working on it
2006-10-20T11:26:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	well its no doubt a pain in the ass, but... i think you can do it, and i mean, why lose all your data if you can just upgrade?
2006-10-20T11:28:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	sure, by the way, any time i do something more than once, i think its safe to only do it once lol, that was just me trying everything
2006-10-20T11:30:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	no... i didnt unfortunately, hold on
2006-10-20T11:30:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	did you get mine?
2006-10-20T11:32:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	if you sent me any since that, its not working lol
2006-10-20T11:33:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	got it
2006-10-20T11:35:00.000Z	Ademan	qzn	all i did was open up synaptic, scroll down to find a package that was broken (has an ALL red checkbox next to it) click on it and hit remove broken package
