2010-05-14T05:43:00.000Z	[Screamo]		 Can anyone help me with 9.10 freezing like 10 times a day requiring a hard reset?
2010-05-14T05:43:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Upgrade to Lucid 10.04 and see if that still occurs?
2010-05-14T05:44:00.000Z	[Screamo]	red2kic	i really dont feel like doing that
2010-05-14T05:44:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Make a final /important/ backup then "do-release-upgrade -d"  -- Not too hard. :)
2010-05-14T05:45:00.000Z	[Screamo]	red2kic	in order to upgrade, id have to wipe this harddrive and reinstall the new one, i really dont want to, i dont have enough space to back anything up
2010-05-22T14:40:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Yup. I think so. :3
2010-05-22T14:41:00.000Z	[Screamo]	red2kic	that looks.. horrid D:
2010-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Brains over looks. :)
2010-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Functions* over looks.
2010-05-22T15:10:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Use GIMP + Compiz. Ok ok. Use Photoshop... but rainmeter is meh? Calendar, right?

2010-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	You only like Rainmeter because it is... easy to set up? ;o
2010-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	[Screamo]	red2kic	hardly, it took me like a week to get it to my liking
2010-05-22T15:15:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	Another !DE, like OpenBox or fluxbox.
2010-07-09T11:04:00.000Z	red2kic	[Screamo]	You can greatly free up the space by purchasing more storages. It's efficient method.
2010-07-09T11:04:00.000Z	[Screamo]	red2kic	indeed it is, but i am jobless and have no money
