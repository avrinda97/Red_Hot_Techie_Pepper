2012-01-08T01:52:00.000Z	kasii		it was about few days a go i was  updating my pc through update manager  after that it gives me  to run partial upgrading and after that a problem arise
2012-01-08T01:53:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	can you please start a terminal and run sudo apt-get update
2012-01-08T01:53:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	followed by sudo apt-get upgrade, then paste the results to paste.ubuntu.com
2012-01-08T01:54:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	do not paste the output here
2012-01-08T01:55:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	after you have put the results on paste.ubuntu.com you can paste the URL to the page in here
2012-01-08T01:57:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	"sudo apt-get update"
2012-01-08T02:03:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	ok, that completed without errors, it looks fine. Now try "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2012-01-08T02:04:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	really, I saw it the first time, if you put my name on a line I *will* see it
2012-01-08T02:08:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	it is not get-apt, it is apt-get. "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2012-01-08T02:12:00.000Z	AlanBell	kasii	ok, that completed without error too. There is nothing wrong with your package system and your computer is fully up to date
