2006-12-10T13:26:00.000Z	wyld		how do i make a file owned by root.root?
2006-12-10T13:27:00.000Z	wyld		"The file should be owned by root.root and be copied to /tmp." This is what it says in the java installer relating to the documentation. how do i do this?
2006-12-10T13:27:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 sudo chown root:root /target/file.name
2006-12-10T13:28:00.000Z	wyld	SilentDis	do i have colon in root:root, or a period?
2006-12-10T13:29:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 that's a colon :)
2006-12-10T13:29:00.000Z	wyld	SilentDis	thanks

2006-12-13T12:29:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 rm
2006-12-21T10:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 never seen that before... did you grab gxine or just xine?
2006-12-21T10:06:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 if you're running ubuntu with gnome... might be better to grab gxine instead.  i know it doesn't remove anything (got it installed right now, in fact)
2006-12-21T10:07:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 yes.  loosing totem can be a bit of a pain, as it provides an 'easy default' in case everything else fails :)
2006-12-21T10:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 nt, enjoy!
2006-12-21T10:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 lol if you miss totem, you can safely reinstall it.  it'll just kick the 'xine' package out.  and ubuntu-desktop is simply a meta package.  it doesn't 'do' anything but allow other distros (such as kubuntu/xubuntu) install the gnome desktop stuff.  no sweat on loosing it :)
2006-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 I see said the blind man to his deaf daughter as he picked up his hammer and saw? *giggle*
2006-12-21T10:12:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 rofl
2006-12-21T10:31:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 i don't need much, personally.  I run jmon on a seperate box :)
2006-12-21T10:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 monitors all the *nix systems on my network from a term window :)
2006-12-21T10:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	wyld	 it is.  it just watches proc/mem usage.  not really a 'system monitor' for personal use though
