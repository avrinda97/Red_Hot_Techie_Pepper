2006-05-27T11:01:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	if you use LiveCD you'll must use espresso
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	for what do you need dapper? desktop or server? choose
2006-05-27T11:00:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	i assume you know that default installation is the one using espresso
2006-06-03T06:04:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	what's up.....
2006-06-03T06:04:00.000Z	wubrgamer	EmxBA	i think ? i mean i ususally don't remember SN's that well, do i know you ? i DO think you've helped me b4 though
2006-06-03T06:05:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	yes, i helped you a lot some day :D
2006-06-03T06:05:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	i remember there was a lot of discussion last few days with you
2006-06-03T06:06:00.000Z	wubrgamer	EmxBA	, tutorials don't help as much as IRC and people
2006-06-03T06:07:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	that's why i became very attracted to #ubuntu
2006-06-03T06:09:00.000Z	EmxBA	wubrgamer	me too
