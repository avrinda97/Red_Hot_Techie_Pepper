2010-10-01T03:47:00.000Z	obrown		Hi everyone, I've set up a shared folder in my virtual box to use in windows XP but when I try to add it in win xp, it can not find share
2010-10-01T03:48:00.000Z	st__	obrown	never had such problem, are you sure you're on last version of additions
2010-10-01T03:48:00.000Z	obrown	st__	I use virtualbox 3.2.8
2010-10-01T03:49:00.000Z	obrown	st__	It says Oracle VM VirtualBox
2010-10-01T03:51:00.000Z	obrown	st__	When I installed win xp in the virtual box, I don't remember anything asking me to install additional driver, did I miss it ?
2010-10-01T03:52:00.000Z	st__	obrown	after installing xp when you install additions it warns you about unsigned drivers
2010-10-01T03:53:00.000Z	obrown	st__	, ron85, can you tell me the steps I need to do please ?
2010-10-01T03:56:00.000Z	st__	obrown	open Devices menu and choose Install Gust Additions, then open CDROM :)
2010-10-01T04:01:00.000Z	obrown	st__	, ron85, is there a difference between virtualbox and vm ?
2010-10-01T04:02:00.000Z	obrown	st__	, ron85, because when I type leftctrl+d in virtualbox, it opens the virtual media manager, not the device menu
2010-10-01T04:03:00.000Z	st__	obrown	use 'Device' menu if you're in QT interface
2010-10-01T04:05:00.000Z	obrown	st__	: I am in the virtualbox visual interface, I can not see the device menu anywhere
2010-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	obrown	st__	: maybe I can show you a screenshot of what I see ?
2010-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	st__	obrown	I have 3 menus in virtual machine window: Machine, Devices, and Help
2010-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	st__	obrown	sure
2010-10-01T04:10:00.000Z	obrown	st__	http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/2094/screenshotspi.png
2010-10-01T04:10:00.000Z	st__	obrown	you need to power it up first
2010-10-01T04:11:00.000Z	obrown	st__	aaaaah kkk, thanks for your patience
