2007-06-14T08:44:00.000Z	westoncampbell		Will someone help me please? I'm getting the "Failed to start X server..." message after doing sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-06-14T05:03:00.000Z	westoncampbell		I changed the mount options on my 20GB portable media player and I put something wrong and it's not mounting now. How can I still access the drive so that I can fix the problem?
2007-06-14T05:05:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	what do you mean, you put something wrong?  could you be more specific as to what you did when your player wouldn't mount any more?
2007-06-14T05:06:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	It said I put a wrong character in the mount options and it's not mounting anymore. I need to get back to settings to change what I entered to the right info.
2007-06-14T05:07:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	in /etc/fstab maybe?
2007-06-14T05:11:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	I don't have a /etc/fstab
2007-06-14T05:11:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	I'm sure you do.  so where did you change the mount option for your media player?
2007-06-14T05:11:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	When mounted, an Icon was put on the desktop. I right clicked it and went to properties.I then when to one of the tabs and changed the mount options to have fmask=777, etc. so that it would allow me to create and remove files.
2007-06-14T05:15:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	when you plug in the player, check dmesg to find its device name.  maybe we can mount it manually to fix it.
2007-06-14T05:19:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	AV_LYRA is the volume name shown in error. dmesg doesn't show too much about device names.
2007-06-14T05:19:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	pastebin the error / dmesg output for us.
2007-06-14T05:22:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	you can find the "dmesg" output at the following link: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25526/
2007-06-14T05:23:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	your player is this Thomson player?
2007-06-14T05:24:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	Yes, it's a RCA LYRA RD2780. Thomson is the HDD brand name.
2007-06-14T05:32:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	i'm not sure what's going on dude.  sorry.
2007-06-14T05:33:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	I thought as much... It's hard. Thanks for trying!
2007-06-14T05:33:00.000Z	westoncampbell	dawn_chorus	I really appreciate it
2007-06-14T05:34:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	westoncampbell	there are some weird messages in your dmesg output though.
