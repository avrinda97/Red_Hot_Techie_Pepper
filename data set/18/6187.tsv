2008-06-10T10:24:00.000Z	grael		hi there... anyone know why the vnc option in terminal server client would be disabled?
2008-06-10T10:24:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	it might not be installed
2008-06-10T10:25:00.000Z	grael	rampageoberon	does the vnc part of it have a separate package then?
2008-06-10T10:25:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	i think its xvnc4viewer
2008-06-10T10:26:00.000Z	grael	rampageoberon	got it. thank you =)
2008-06-12T07:10:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	iptraf or netstat
2008-06-12T08:11:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	sorry please repeat
2008-06-12T08:12:00.000Z	grael	rampageoberon	 i have a script called 'test' and i want to run it by just calling 'test' from a terminal. How do i make it so that wherever i am in the terminal, and i type 'test' it'll call the script?
2008-06-12T08:12:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	do you mean /home/user/.bin/?
2008-06-12T08:12:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	ah, you can either stick the script in /usr/bin or make a link in there to the file in your home directory
2008-06-12T08:13:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	once its int /usr/bin any user can call test and it will run
2008-06-12T08:14:00.000Z	grael	rampageoberon	right, but how do i make it so that whatever script i put in a particular directory, calling the script will work?
2008-06-12T08:14:00.000Z	grael	rampageoberon	IE, add it to $PATH i believe
2008-06-12T08:15:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	hmm, not sure how thats done
2008-06-12T08:16:00.000Z	grael	rampageoberon	ah well... thanks for trying anyway =P
2008-06-12T08:16:00.000Z	rampageoberon	grael	rk, and defined them in /etc/hosts. Should give you some perspective ;)
