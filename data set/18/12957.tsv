2006-02-28T10:40:00.000Z	apt514		Hi I installed 5.04 can i update with a 5.10 live cd?
2006-02-28T10:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	you can use a broadband Net connection too
2006-02-28T10:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	live cd is wrong AFAIK
2006-02-28T10:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	use the net, or the install cd
2006-02-28T10:43:00.000Z	apt514	Xenguy	i'm using a 33.6k
2006-02-28T10:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	not ideal; maybe a CD upgrade is better
2006-02-28T10:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	order some cd's for the upcoming Dapper release in April
2006-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	give them to your friends :-)
2006-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	apt514	Xenguy	sure on usb keys
2006-02-28T10:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	how much storage on your usb keys ?
2006-02-28T10:47:00.000Z	apt514	Xenguy	Kingston 256mb 20$ cdn http://www.oemexpress.com
2006-02-28T10:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	that's not a cd's worth - has ubu got a base install for that storage size, or are you just dreaming ?  :-)
2006-02-28T10:49:00.000Z	apt514	Xenguy	Kingston 1g 70$ cdn too
2006-02-28T10:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	that would do it then :-)
2006-02-28T10:50:00.000Z	Xenguy	apt514	there's probably a howto by now
2006-02-28T10:51:00.000Z	Xenguy		attack of the killer p's
2006-02-28T10:51:00.000Z	Xenguy		:-)
2006-02-28T10:55:00.000Z	apt514	Xenguy	Or a Kingston 512mb pc3200 400 $50
