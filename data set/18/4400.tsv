2009-04-19T16:25:00.000Z	Ned2		I think that's how you do it
2009-04-19T16:25:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	it's requesting a GPG key
2009-04-19T16:26:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	see their instructions here: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads (below "or combine downloading and registering")
2009-04-19T16:28:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	that's the site where I got the repository that I tried to add to software sources...it worked the previous times I installed virtualbox...I don't know why it's working now
2009-04-19T16:29:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	well, did you add the key?
2009-04-19T16:29:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	I'm not sure but I thought maybe that's the way to add the key because it worked before
2009-04-19T16:30:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	"public key not available" tells me that the key is well.. not available not invalid. Is it listed in System -> Software Sources -> Authentication?
2009-04-19T16:32:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	if I'm supposed to see the line I added to in Authentication, no I don't see it there...I only see it in Third-Party Software where I added it
2009-04-19T16:33:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	did you do the: wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/sun_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
2009-04-19T16:34:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	no I haven't...do I type that line exactly like that or do I add the repository at the end of that line?
2009-04-19T16:36:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	it seems you don't understand. Here's how repositories work: repositories are pools of packages you can install, these packages are signed with GPG keys so you can be sure about the validity. When you add a repository you need to add it (that is the line starting with deb) but you also need to import the key so that you can verify whether the packages are valid.
2009-04-19T16:36:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	so yes, you need to execute that line on the command line or add the key through the GUI.
2009-04-19T16:36:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	but it should be nowhere near the line starting with deb, since that's something entirely else
2009-04-19T16:39:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	thanks for the info
2009-04-19T16:39:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	np
2009-04-19T16:40:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	oh wait...I was wondering how was I able to get virtualbox to work before without adding the GPG...unless I somehow did it without realizing?
2009-04-19T16:41:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Ned2	maybe apt ignored the key, it's not required perse to install
2009-04-19T16:41:00.000Z	Ned2	Brucevdk	I see
