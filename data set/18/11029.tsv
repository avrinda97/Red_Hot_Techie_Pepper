2008-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu1		hi. im not coming off a new install or upgrade or anything, i dont remember what i did. but the last time i restarted my computer it wouldnt boot up properly. it goes past the grub then instead of getting my login screen i get a terminal-like screen and it says "BusyBox v1.1.3 (Debian 1:1.1.3-5ubuntu7) built-in shell (ash)" then it drops down and instead of my username it says "(initramfs)" in a terminal style prompt. i have limited commands
2008-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu1		while in this, but i can tell that i am on my main partition because im able to cd through folders. i looked around the internet and the most common responce was to remove "quiet splash" and add "all_generic_ide" to the thing in the grub (pressing escape then e for edit and b to boot it up) but that didnt work for me. a few sites i looked at also suggested just messing with "noacpi, nodma, noapic, and nolapic" i tried each one of those, with
2008-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu1		and without the "quiet splash" there and none of it worked. What is this problem, and how can i fix it?
2008-01-09T08:41:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	does it say anything about running fsck manually?
2008-01-09T08:41:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	im not sure
2008-01-09T08:41:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	what would that do (assuming i was able to do it)
2008-01-09T08:42:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	it's a harddisk scanner;  if it said that, then the machine was probably rebooted once while it was running a scan (would've seemed like it had frozen due to a lack of progress on the boot screen)
2008-01-09T08:43:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	does it still give the busybox prompt if you select the recovery kernel in grub?
2008-01-09T08:43:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	yes
2008-01-09T08:43:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	(it'll still give you a prompt, but it'll be a bash prompt instead of busybox)
2008-01-09T08:44:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	well if i could get a bash prompt i could do startx, right?
2008-01-09T08:44:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	did it say anything about 'unable to mount root filesystem'?
2008-01-09T08:44:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	yes, although /etc/init.d/gdm start would be more what you're looking for
2008-01-09T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	no, it is mounted, because i can browse around my HDD
2008-01-09T08:45:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	you're sure?  i.e., can you browse into your home directory?
2008-01-09T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	yes, im sure
2008-01-09T08:50:00.000Z	ubuntu1	cwillu	any ideas on what i can do?
2008-01-09T08:51:00.000Z	cwillu	ubuntu1	do you have network access on that machine?  (i.e., can you ping google.com?)
