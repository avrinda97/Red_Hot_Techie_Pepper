2010-05-05T02:55:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	ok thanks man
2010-05-05T02:44:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	Are you by chance using 32-bit flash on a 64-bit machine?
2010-05-05T02:46:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	i was before but now i'm not
2010-05-05T02:46:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	Not sure, then. Video without sound would be a PulseAudio issue. Sound without video... are you doing something fancy with compiz?
2010-05-05T02:49:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	... 64-bit flash won't work on a 32-bit installation of Ubuntu. Are you sure you're using a 32-bit installation of Ubuntu and not a 64-bit one?
2010-05-05T02:49:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	i have 64bit lucid
2010-05-05T02:49:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	What does "uname -a" say?
2010-05-05T02:49:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	uname -a says 2.6.32-21-generic #32-Ubuntu

2010-05-05T02:50:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	Try following these directions then: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash#x86_64
2010-05-05T02:51:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	You may have better luck installing the "pre-release" of flash from the PPA.
2010-05-05T02:51:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	i did though
2010-05-05T02:51:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	i did the stuff on https://launchpad.net/~sevenmachines/+archive/flash
2010-05-05T02:52:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	Ah, OK. I see, you have 10,0,45,2 installed.
2010-05-05T02:52:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	Is it all website (including YouTube) that don't work, or just some websites?
2010-05-05T02:52:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	lemme check, i only tried youtube so far
2010-05-05T02:54:00.000Z	infid	benkay86	good one. youtube is the problem because funnyordie.com videos are workin and so are google video
2010-05-05T02:54:00.000Z	benkay86	infid	Hmmm... not the flash plugin then. You might try clearing browser cache, rebooting, etc. One never knows why these things happen.
