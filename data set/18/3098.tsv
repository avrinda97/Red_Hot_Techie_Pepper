2010-02-05T22:21:00.000Z	usicow		I'm trying to connect to my WPA wireless network. Can anyone help me connect to it via the command line?
2010-02-05T22:21:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	do you have wpa_supplicant installed?
2010-02-05T22:21:00.000Z	usicow		so far I've just tried to use iwconfig with a key to connect.. but that doesnt work.
2010-02-05T22:22:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	yes
2010-02-05T22:22:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	do you need certificates for your wirelles lan? is you card working great?
2010-02-05T22:23:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	No, no certificates required.. and I believe my card is working.. it can see all the wireless networks around me (over 30 of them).
2010-02-05T22:24:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	ok so they seem to work...but can you tell me exactly what is happening to your connection?
2010-02-05T22:24:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	what is your problem?
2010-02-05T22:25:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	I guess that I've still got to do the step of creating the wps_suppliment.conf file and stuff.. I'll read up on that.
2010-02-05T22:25:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	ok so that might be your problem
2010-02-05T22:30:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	is it strange that I have no /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file? I can of course create one, but is it strange that it doesnt exist up front?
2010-02-05T22:33:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	yeah you have to create it , this is the normal procedure
2010-02-05T22:33:00.000Z	Ganang		do you want an example file?
2010-02-05T22:36:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	I think I got the example file.. so I've created it now, with my own network{} defined in there based on what wpa_passphrase gave me. What do I have to do next?
2010-02-05T22:40:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	strange.. I just saw a program called wpa_cli exists.. when I run it it says 'Cound not connect to wpa_supplicant - re-trying'
2010-02-05T22:41:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	u have to run the file with you against your conf file
2010-02-05T22:44:00.000Z	Ganang	usicow	follow this instructions http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/index.php?node_id=2009
2010-02-05T22:44:00.000Z	usicow	Ganang	thanks
