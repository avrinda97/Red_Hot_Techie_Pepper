2007-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	TimothyP		Hi, I installed a printer on ubuntu (NRG DSM725) the driver was in the list, and I also tried a new driver from the nashuatech website. The print seems to go out, the printer briefly receives something but that's where it ends. from windows it works
2007-03-05T07:53:00.000Z	TimothyP		I have tried installing it via cups webinterface, with same results
2007-03-05T07:53:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	what does the printer do when it recieves the job
2007-03-05T07:55:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	oh it's a jetdirect
2007-03-05T07:55:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	is it on a network?
2007-03-05T07:56:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	well the configuration you used is for jetdirect nic
2007-03-05T07:57:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	how is the printer connected?
2007-03-05T07:58:00.000Z	TimothyP	infidel	we use TCP/IP port with address 172.16.10.1 port 9100 when we connect to the printer from a windows machine
2007-03-05T07:58:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	what's make?
2007-03-05T07:59:00.000Z	TimothyP	infidel	Nashuatec (NGR) DSM725
2007-03-05T07:59:00.000Z	infidel	TimothyP	hold on a econd
2007-03-05T08:02:00.000Z	TimothyP	infidel	I also installed the latest ppd from the NGR site, but that didn't help, so I'm guessing I have to use something other than hp jetdirect
