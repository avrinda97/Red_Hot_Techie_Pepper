2008-07-01T17:30:00.000Z	ge		Hey People! I try to enable bluetooth on my notebook. Any idea how?
2008-07-01T17:30:00.000Z	ge		When I do `hcitool scan` it says "Device is not available: No such device"
2008-07-01T17:30:00.000Z	ge		On the Ubuntu wiki, it says "start bluetooth-applet" but what does this do? nothing happens.
2008-07-01T17:31:00.000Z	soundray	ge	you need bluetooth hardware
2008-07-01T17:32:00.000Z	ge	soundray	i have bluetooth hardware
2008-07-01T17:32:00.000Z	soundray	ge	what kind? How connected?
2008-07-01T17:32:00.000Z	ge	soundray	its part of the notebook
2008-07-01T17:33:00.000Z	soundray	ge	what notebook model?
2008-07-01T17:33:00.000Z	ge	soundray	samsung x20
2008-07-01T17:35:00.000Z	soundray	ge	does your bluetooth hardware show up when you enter 'lsusb'?
2008-07-01T17:37:00.000Z	ge	soundray	i dont think so. it shows a bunch of iles like these:
2008-07-01T17:38:00.000Z	soundray	ge	either that, or your integrated bluetooth hardware may be connected to the PCI bus, in which case it will show up in the output of lspci
2008-07-01T17:40:00.000Z	ge	soundray	ubottu: `lspci | grep blue` does not show anything. So I guess this notebook has no bluetooth. I will get an usb-bluetooth-thingy then.
2008-07-01T17:40:00.000Z	soundray	ge	grep is case sensitive. Retry with grep -i
2008-07-01T17:41:00.000Z	ge	soundray	nothing either.
2008-07-01T17:42:00.000Z	soundray	ge	the X20 comes in lots of versions. It's possible that yours doesn't have Bluetooth and you need a dongle.
2008-07-01T17:42:00.000Z	soundray	ge	I bought a nice one the other day, just fingernail-size and round
2008-07-01T17:43:00.000Z	ge	soundray	Bodsda: thank you very much for your help. will switch to another computer now and have to turn off irc.
