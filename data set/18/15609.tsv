2007-04-21T08:49:00.000Z	root__	william	I have a ubuntu install but have fallen in love with the speed of fluxbox. My origional plan was to back up everything and install Xubuntu because it is so stripped down lol. The alure of the upgrade now button was too strong though
2007-04-21T08:53:00.000Z	root__	william	I haven't the slightest what I did but I think I fixed it lol
