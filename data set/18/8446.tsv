2009-07-10T03:59:00.000Z	badpenguin86		I am on a fresh install of 9.04, and right off the bat, it told me my broadcom driver was enabled, but it doesn't work. What is wrong?
2009-07-10T03:59:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	wireless?
2009-07-10T03:59:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	yeah
2009-07-10T04:00:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	did you configure it with iwconfig or some graphical configurator?
2009-07-10T04:01:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	did you install over the wireless?
2009-07-10T04:02:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	I installed without being hooked to ethernet, but it should not have activated my wireless without accepting the restricted driver, should it?
2009-07-10T04:02:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	does ifconfig show your wireless device?
2009-07-10T04:03:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	Nope, just ethernet and loopback
2009-07-10T04:03:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	there's your problem the driver isn't loaded
2009-07-10T04:04:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	how do I fix it? I deactivated and reactivated it in the restricted drivers tool
2009-07-10T04:04:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	have you googled this
2009-07-10T04:05:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	Nah, figured best help was on here. I can look though
2009-07-10T04:09:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	The only remedy I found was a complex series of steps that involved manually shutting off the wireless card by using the switch, but my laptop is a macbook... no switch
2009-07-10T04:10:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	you installed jaunty on a macbook?
2009-07-10T04:10:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	yeah
2009-07-10T04:16:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	WHy?
2009-07-10T04:30:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bucky	I tried removing the driver and rebooting, then enabling it again.. No go
2009-07-10T04:32:00.000Z	bucky	badpenguin86	is the driver loaded, what does ifconfig say, have you used iwconfig or System->Administration->Network  to set it up   ...you're a mac guy, you can figure it out
