2006-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	Dowey		can i please borrow a few minutes of someones time
2006-11-05T09:38:00.000Z	Dowey		ok sorry, i just need help mounting my cd burner i have googled everything and i still cant do it
2006-11-05T09:39:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	it doesn't automatically mount when you put a disc in it?
2006-11-05T09:41:00.000Z	Dowey	bruenig	so do you know what i can do
2006-11-05T09:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	check your fstab to see what it has for your cdrom
2006-11-05T09:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	/etc/fstab
2006-11-05T09:45:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	right well theoretically, you should be able to just do a mount /dev/hdd but if it wasn't recognizing your blank disc it will just say no medium found I believe
2006-11-05T09:47:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	did your fstab have other stuff on that line like mine, stuff that looked like this udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
2006-11-05T09:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	your line should look like this. I am not sure this will solve your problem but, /dev/hdd        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
2006-11-05T09:50:00.000Z	Dowey	bruenig	that is what it looks like
2006-11-05T09:52:00.000Z	Dowey	bruenig	it looks like ubuntu doesnt recognize it as a cd burner
2006-11-05T09:52:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	ok, well try this command then. sudo mount /dev/hdd /media/cdrom0"
2006-11-05T09:53:00.000Z	Dowey	bruenig	i get this "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
2006-11-05T09:56:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdd /media/cdrom0
2006-11-05T09:57:00.000Z	Dowey	bruenig	i get another error "mount: special device /dev/hdd does not exist"
2006-11-05T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	that is all I got
2006-11-05T09:58:00.000Z	Dowey	bruenig	dang do u know anyone who can help
2006-11-05T09:58:00.000Z	bruenig	Dowey	ask in here again. I can't imagine what the problem is.
