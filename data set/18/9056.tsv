2007-06-04T07:26:00.000Z	doctorow		I would like to permanently disable Slow Keys on Kubuntu Feisty so that it never ever pops up a dialog asking me if I want to turn it on, no matter what keys I hold down
2007-06-04T07:26:00.000Z	doctorow		Is there a way to uninstall Slow Keys so that it's not even on my systems anymore?
2007-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	w1ls0n_	doctorow	are you the real cory doctorow?
2007-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	doctorow		Wilson -- yup!
2007-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	doctorow		At least, I'm wearing his underwear and using his computer!
2007-06-04T07:28:00.000Z	w1ls0n_	doctorow	i should've known.
2007-06-04T07:28:00.000Z	w1ls0n_	doctorow	that you use ubuntu that is..
2007-06-04T07:28:00.000Z	doctorow		w1ls0n, of course!
2007-06-04T07:29:00.000Z	doctorow		w1ls0n, though I have to tell you that I'm about ready to tear my hair out over Slow Keys turning on every time I hold down the shift key for 8 secs. I generally hold down the shift key whil eI'm thinking about what to type, fingers poised over the keyboard to start a new sentence. Inspiration strikes, I start typing, and all my keystrokes are stolen by
2007-06-04T07:30:00.000Z	w1ls0n_	doctorow	hehehe.  google says you're screwed :(
2007-06-04T07:30:00.000Z	doctorow		W1ls0n Slow Keys -- and then I have to minimize the top two windows to find the "Do you want Slow Keys" dialog and turn it off
2007-06-04T07:30:00.000Z	doctorow		W1ls0n, yeah, I saw that there area ton of open bugs, but I'm wondering if I can just get around them all by just deleting the package
2007-06-04T07:31:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	thanks for that's not it -- I need to change the fact that Slow Keys -- even when disabled -- pops up a dialog if you hold down shift for 8+ secs and asks you if you want it turned on
2007-06-04T07:32:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	I want to actually remove slow-keys, or at least get rid of the shortcut
2007-06-04T07:32:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	Do you know what package Slow Keys comes with? I was thinking I could just uninstall that
2007-06-04T07:32:00.000Z	w1ls0n_	doctorow	try finding something that automatically capitalizes the first letter of every sentence instead...
2007-06-04T07:33:00.000Z	doctorow		W1ls0n, I've been writing with a keyboard since I was 6. I'm 36 now. I am NOT going to stop capitalizing my sentences with the shift key at this point. Might as well try to unlearn how to brush my teeth.
2007-06-04T07:34:00.000Z	w1ls0n_	doctorow	nice meeting you.  I'm off to a celebration.
