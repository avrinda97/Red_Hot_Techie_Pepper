2006-01-04T13:30:00.000Z	Happuf		Some here knows why ubuntus diskmanager sets root acces to NTFS partition?
2006-01-04T13:30:00.000Z	Happuf		I cant change them afterwards.
2006-01-04T13:31:00.000Z	pashaw	Happuf	   you can set user read to ntfs  but  not write    that what you want
2006-01-04T13:31:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	tell me how. I have tried.
2006-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	pashaw	Happuf	  scroll down to this section    "Editing Ubuntu's filesystem table"
2006-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	happu wants to thank you :)
2006-01-04T13:33:00.000Z	pashaw	Happuf	   replace the fstab    ntfs line  "defaults"  to     those line lines like "ro,auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000"
2006-01-04T13:34:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	I dont have it fstab.
2006-01-04T13:34:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	I used diskmanager.
2006-01-04T13:34:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	but I'll try that script.
2006-01-04T13:35:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	oh. I'll try what you succested.

2006-01-04T13:36:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	nope. It just didnt automount for some reason.
2006-01-04T13:37:00.000Z	pashaw	Happuf	   type   cat /etc/fstab   there are no ntfs lines?
2006-01-04T13:37:00.000Z	Happuf	pashaw	nope.
