2006-06-25T11:25:00.000Z	garryF		If stardash is using breezy shouldn't he be downloading the driver from nvidia.com instead of getting them from the repositories that are drivers for dapper or has that changed?
2006-06-25T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	the best driver is not the issue, but what is the driver that is suppored
2006-06-25T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	that is a well known fix for debian based systems; the packagers are aware of the problems, and if you keep up to date you get a lot of fixes
2006-06-25T11:41:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	Hmm. Well, I run the update stuff regularly.
2006-06-25T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	that was a hopeful version of how it works, I admit
2006-06-25T11:42:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	:)
2006-06-25T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	but, it's true. Sometimes patience is a virtue
2006-06-25T11:43:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	Yep.
2006-06-25T11:44:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	The user with his issue, who I sent to reinstall, just told me he found out that his stuff wasn't installed at all. LoL.
2006-06-25T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	welcome to the support teamsters
2006-06-25T12:09:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	cut and paste, cut and paste. what more is there?
2006-06-25T12:11:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	My eyes tend to skip lines and misread them, and well it just runs down to my incapability of reliably following clear instructions or noticing that I've skipped a line or two down.
2006-06-25T12:12:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	that is the bane of irc
2006-06-25T12:16:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	Somehow I got that wizard of odd song in my head. Ping dong, the bot is dead, the bot is dead, please fix the bot ...
2006-06-25T12:17:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	get a better player, for your sanity :)
2006-06-25T12:17:00.000Z	garryF	nickrud	LoL
2006-06-25T12:34:00.000Z	nickrud	garryF	what, syrup?
