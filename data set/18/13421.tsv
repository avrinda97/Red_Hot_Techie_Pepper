2006-04-14T14:53:00.000Z	defcon8		thanks Frogzoo
2006-04-14T14:55:00.000Z	defcon8		how do i get ubuntu to not automatically start X?
2006-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	you change the start scripts in /tec
2006-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	you change the start scripts in /etc   that is
2006-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	defcon8	sethk	could you be more specific?
2006-04-14T14:57:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	in /etc, there are a series of directories, r0.d r1.d, etc.  each has a list of scripts that start the things running at that level
2006-04-14T14:57:00.000Z	defcon8	sethk	do i edit 5?
2006-04-14T14:58:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	they are just text files.  Once you know what to edit, you use a text editor
2006-04-14T14:58:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	so you go into /etc/rc2.d and stop if from starting gdm
2006-04-14T14:59:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	it is MUCH MUCH easiler on ubuntu.  Even without the tool that DBO told you about, gentoo is much harder
2006-04-14T14:59:00.000Z	defcon8	sethk	shall i just rename the script or put it somewhere else?
2006-04-14T14:59:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	move it
2006-04-14T14:59:00.000Z	sethk	defcon8	but why not use the tool that DBO recommended first, see if it makes your life easier?
2006-04-14T15:00:00.000Z	defcon8	sethk	oh im ok like this
