2009-12-20T07:23:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	is there the possibility of a BIOS OS lock?
2009-12-20T07:23:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	I doubt it
2009-12-20T07:24:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	I presume we're talking about a HPã€€machine here?
2009-12-20T07:25:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	acer
2009-12-20T07:25:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	just noticed, thanks, but I don't think such a company would be stupid enough to put bios os lock
2009-12-20T07:26:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	i believe i had it happen  to me on a older dell
2009-12-20T07:27:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	how old is old? I have a c-series and a d-series laptop, none of which displayed any form of bios os lock
2009-12-20T07:27:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	it was a pentium 3 demension desktop i believe, dont have it anymore
2009-12-20T07:28:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	ah I don't have dell desktops, I never had desktops pre-built by large manufacturers
2009-12-20T07:29:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	ok, not positive about it either, could be something else, it was a while ago
2009-12-20T07:30:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	I do know on a different case that manufacturers such as HP/Compaq, Lenovo/IBM does have minipci/minipcie wireless card whitelisting
2009-12-20T07:32:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	well if linux were installed on a partition, I'm sure its possible to simply format that partition rather than formatting the entire disk
2009-12-20T07:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	I'm suspecting the disk might not be bootable.. if there are doubts of whether such bios os lock exists. You can simply remove the internal hard disk to see if the bios is stubborn to boot only hard disk
2009-12-20T07:37:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	i hadn't thought of that, bravo!
2009-12-20T07:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	there's other ways to boot, you can also use something like PLoP boot manager and usb flash drive pre-loaded with ubuntu via unetbootin
2009-12-20T07:38:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	but bruns flash drive is dead "flashed out" -lol
2009-12-20T07:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	rocketman	time to buy a new one
2009-12-20T07:39:00.000Z	rocketman	psycho_oreos	yep
