2007-11-17T22:16:00.000Z	juano__	speps	with sudo ?
2007-11-17T22:17:00.000Z	speps	juano__	wlan change to 1 ... but nothing happens!
2007-11-17T22:20:00.000Z	juano__	speps	u cant get the wifi to work ?
2007-11-17T22:21:00.000Z	speps	juano__	wifi works fine!...only the led is off. i don't know why
2007-11-17T22:21:00.000Z	juano__	speps	when you installed ubuntu, did the legacy drivers prompt you for a driver ?
2007-11-17T22:23:00.000Z	speps	juano__	i use the ndiswrapper with my BroadCom 4318 AirForce One ...
2007-11-17T22:24:00.000Z	juano__	speps	the problem is just the led or is there connectivity problem also ?
2007-11-17T22:25:00.000Z	speps	juano__	no problem. Only the led. (under win the led is on so it's not broken)
2007-11-17T22:26:00.000Z	juano__	speps	ya, this happened to a friend of mine, it has to do with the drivers, if connectivity is fine though , that is very wierd
2007-11-17T22:26:00.000Z	juano__	speps	cause usually when there is no led, bad driver
2007-11-17T22:28:00.000Z	speps	juano__	maybe someone that has BroadCom 4318 AirForce One ... could help me.I wish.
2007-11-17T22:29:00.000Z	juano__	speps	yea, i think that if you have well connectivity.. normally the driver is fine
2007-11-17T22:30:00.000Z	juano__	speps	maybe you need another driver more suitable that enables the led at startup
2007-11-17T22:31:00.000Z	speps	juano__	maybe not ... this is the only one that works with my card
2007-11-17T22:31:00.000Z	juano__	speps	yea.. you really got me on that one with the led issue
2007-11-17T22:31:00.000Z	juano__	speps	really wouldnt know
