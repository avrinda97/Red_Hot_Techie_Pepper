2006-08-28T11:42:00.000Z	Wabs		ok, so I enabled the Mini-PCI in my BIOS, but in Network Tools under Network Devices I still don't see anything available besides Loopback Interface
2006-08-28T11:42:00.000Z	Wabs		This is crazy
2006-08-28T11:42:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	what does /etc/network/interfaces say
2006-08-28T11:43:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	Where is that?
2006-08-28T11:43:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	right where i said :) run "sudo gedit /etc/network/interface"
2006-08-28T11:45:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	It asks for a password
2006-08-28T11:45:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	type your user passworkd
2006-08-28T11:48:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	you'll have to retype it :P
2006-08-28T11:49:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	When I try to enter my password, I type it in and hit enter. I see no keystrokes, but then i hit enter and says its wrong
2006-08-28T11:49:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	out.txt
2006-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	in the terminal, when you type your password, it doesn't show up as anything, for security
2006-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	just type it in exactly how it should be
2006-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	Yeah, but then I hit enter after typing it in and it says it's wrong
2006-08-28T12:06:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	did you put it in yourself?
2006-08-28T12:07:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	do you have a physical switch for your wireless card?
2006-08-28T12:08:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	I don't think so
2006-08-28T12:08:00.000Z	PWill	Wabs	check :)
2006-08-28T12:08:00.000Z	Wabs	PWill	Nope, no switch or button
