2009-05-06T22:44:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	wins the keen observation award
2012-04-12T06:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	MrUnagi: ya or restart the one he now runs with a different config
2012-04-12T06:43:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	But if he does not have the Xserver running on the server, he will not be able to conect to it.
2012-04-12T06:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	yes with this tightvnc I think your correct and I'm not even sure about x11vnc on the new versions of ubuntu
2012-04-12T06:46:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	Yes, if he does not have a user logged into the Xserver, he's better off to use tightvnc (vncserver).
2012-06-19T15:29:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	(Just turn off the dhcp server?)
2012-06-19T15:29:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	Oh no, I see what he's saying.
2012-06-19T15:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	I'm not sure I've never done it
2012-06-19T15:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	you can run more than one network on a single nic,  it just won't be as secure
2012-06-19T15:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	oh maybe in this case you would want two nics since now your on wan direct?
2012-06-19T15:54:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	No, he would need to add another NIC
2012-06-19T15:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	you can run virtual networks but I'm not sure
2012-06-19T15:55:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	What you are talking about does not apply to this situation.  (Can not do it with one NIC.)
2012-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	genii-around  Yea, I looked at fdisk's list of drive types and 55 is indeed "EZ-Drive"
2012-06-26T18:47:00.000Z	usr13	sacarlson	genii-around I suppose if  he would have specified EZ-Drive as filesystem type, he might have been able to mount it.  Right?
2012-06-26T18:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	usr13	I guess it's some method to hide partitions or disk space to hide files?
