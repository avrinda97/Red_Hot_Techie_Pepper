2007-03-16T08:02:00.000Z	mattyv		Bug 72262 has been around for quite some time and seems to have been ignored. It was handed to the Debian guys but they haven't taken action. What can we do to get it seriously looked at (I feel more "me too" comments on the bug won't help)? The problem affects new OOo Base users, and the workaround isn't suitable for new people...hardly ideal
2007-03-16T08:03:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	one work around sudo apt-get install abiword seems to do very well
2007-03-16T08:03:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	Abiword for database?
2007-03-16T08:04:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	database you say
2007-03-16T08:04:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	 Yeah, I should be more clear. It's OOo's Base program, rather than the base components
2007-08-09T12:18:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	beginning Linux
2007-08-09T12:03:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	pwd
2007-08-09T12:03:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	thanks, memory eluded me
2007-08-09T12:15:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	ubuntuguide.org is not recommended
2007-08-09T12:16:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	Got some better links, wiki is ok when you know what you're looking for
2007-08-09T12:16:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	Sorry, better links was a question btw
2007-08-09T12:16:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	for what in particular
2007-08-09T12:17:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	to help tittelB learn
2007-08-09T12:17:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	learn what
2007-08-09T12:18:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	you encounter a problem or want to understand something someone told you, and you google until you figure it out completely, keep doing that and after a period of time, you will be very good, that was my strategy at least
2007-08-09T12:20:00.000Z	mattyv	bruenig	I'm fine with all that myself, tittelB was just looking for somewhere to start learning and you advised against ubuntuguide. Wondered if you had alternatives that's all
2007-08-09T12:20:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	ubuntuguide.org doesn't teach you anything
2007-08-09T12:21:00.000Z	bruenig	mattyv	zombo.com would be just as good
