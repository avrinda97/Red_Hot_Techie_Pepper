2009-06-10T04:57:00.000Z	buttons840		can someone help me configure a static ip address on ubuntu server, I have edited the interface config file, but I don't know what values to put in for "gateway" and "network," also, i see talk of name servers, but i don't know how to determin the ip address of my name server.
2009-06-10T04:59:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	run 'sudo ifconfig', it will tell you about the gateway, and that can be used to determine the network.
2009-06-10T04:59:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	to determine the nameserver, run: cat /etc/resolve.conf
2009-06-10T05:01:00.000Z	buttons840	Piet	ifconfig says nothing about gateway
2009-06-10T05:03:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	you'Re right, do this: sudo route -n
2009-06-10T05:03:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	the entry which follows the 0.0.0.0 is your gateway
2009-06-10T05:04:00.000Z	buttons840	Piet	it is the address of my router, is a router a gateway i suppose?
2009-06-10T05:04:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	yup
2009-06-10T05:04:00.000Z	buttons840	Piet	what value will i put in "network"
2009-06-10T05:05:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	i think it's optional. i'd normally prefer to put a netmask instead.
2009-06-10T05:05:00.000Z	buttons840	Piet	thank you, let me see what i can do
2009-06-10T05:06:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	if this is your home LAN, you can put the first three octetcs of your ip address, followed by .255 for 'network'
2009-06-10T05:06:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	normally, when you are supposed to use static ip addresses, your ISP would tell you the values you need to put there.  so make sure this is actually what you want/are supposed to do.
2009-06-10T05:07:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	using a static networking setup can be problematic if the ISP changes things out of the sudden, and you can't access the internet to learn what has been  changed.
2009-06-10T05:09:00.000Z	buttons840	Piet	it appears to be working, you have been talking about the gateway?  you say the gateway should be the same as my external ip address with a .255 at the end? currently i have 255.255.255.0 as gateway and it's working
2009-06-10T05:10:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	no, i was talking about the 'network' setting when i said it is _probably_ the same as your _internal_ ip address with a .255 at the end. and this was referring to configuring a server placed in a LAN behind NAT.
2009-06-10T05:11:00.000Z	Piet	buttons840	what is the server you are configuring going to do? where in your network setup will it be situated?
2009-06-10T05:13:00.000Z	buttons840	Piet	i have it working, it's just a headless server (which i had to attach a head to when i fubbed up ;) attaching to a generic user friendly not setup required linksys router
