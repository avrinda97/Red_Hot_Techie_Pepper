2011-06-16T05:32:00.000Z	dr_willis		latest benchmarks ive seen on KDE - show its not too heavy these days. :)
2011-06-16T05:34:00.000Z	dr_willis		theres the 'text' option that disables gdm and plymouth.. boots straight to the console
2011-06-16T05:35:00.000Z	dr_willis		you can do a 'full normal' install to a usb - if its big enough
2011-06-16T05:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		but they are more flexiable when moving from differnt machines.
2011-06-16T05:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		Normal full ubuntu install wants like 10gb i think
2011-06-16T05:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		Lubuntu is smaller. 5gb perhaps
2011-06-16T05:38:00.000Z	dr_willis		or so i recall seeing the  'suggested' info being at the start of the installer..   depends on what you want to do with the install also
