2006-10-24T08:18:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark		...so the only way to get to use kde is to delete ubuntu and install kubunto?
2006-10-24T08:19:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	I have both kubuntu and ubuntu installed on my computer
2006-10-24T08:19:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	so you can't have gnome and kde on the same ubuntu?
2006-10-24T08:20:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	Yes you can, kubuntu is KDE for ubuntu, you can't run them at the same time
2006-10-24T08:21:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	then why do you have ubuntu and kubuntu installed if you can have them both on 1 ubuntu installation
2006-10-24T08:21:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	Kubuntu is KDE, ubuntu is Gnome.
2006-10-24T08:22:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	They're not 2 separate operating systems, their the same core operating system with the gnome or kde suite of applications and windows management setup installed.
2006-10-24T08:22:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	but lotusleaf said you can have blackbox, fluxbox, openbox, xfce, enlightenment and others on one ubuntu
2006-10-24T08:23:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	i know that they're 2 different graphical thingies, but you're really confusing me now
2006-10-24T08:25:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	ok, then why do YOU have kubuntu and ubuntu installed if you can use both on one installation?
2006-10-24T08:25:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	Kubuntu and ubuntu are not separate OS's, I installed ubuntu (which is gnome) and then typed sudo apt-get kubuntu-desktop
2006-10-24T08:26:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	ok, but before you said you dual boot kubuntu and ubuntu
2006-10-24T08:26:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	no, I never said I dual boot. =)
2006-10-24T08:27:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	u said "<xipietotec> Fenix-Dark: I have both kubuntu and ubuntu installed on my computer"  i thought ubuntu and kubuntu are 2 separate operating systems, one with kde and one with gnome?  how can you run two separate operating systems at once?
2006-10-24T08:27:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	They're not separate operating systems.
2006-10-24T08:27:00.000Z	Fenix-Dark	xipietotec	you're confusing the hell out of me, i'm gonna skip *buntu and install slackware
2006-10-24T08:28:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	all kubuntu means is (k+ubuntu) xubuntu (xcfe+ubuntu)
2006-10-24T08:31:00.000Z	xipietotec	Fenix-Dark	Errr.....ubuntu is much much easier to install and configure than slackware
