2010-07-11T23:32:00.000Z	dominicdinada	scriptwarlock	I forget how to change the tab position in chrome do you remember ? I am trying to mimic IE.... and need to move the tab position. that with the glossy blue theme and it is sure to fool the less educated computer users
2010-07-11T23:33:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	dominicdinada	theme it?
2010-07-11T23:33:00.000Z	dominicdinada	scriptwarlock	even googling changing tab positioning in chrome results in a bunch of things about ordering nothing to move them below the address bar perm....
2010-07-11T23:33:00.000Z	dominicdinada	scriptwarlock	duh i got the color theme but not the tab positions

2010-07-11T23:40:00.000Z	dominicdinada	scriptwarlock	its not my PC and well FF does not look enough like IE even with all the plugs... but chrome does. It is for an old lady whom keeps messing her computer up and she is stuck in her ways of using IE so tricky is the only option i see here
