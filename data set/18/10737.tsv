2007-08-12T15:42:00.000Z	noelferreira		IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
2007-08-12T15:42:00.000Z	noelferreira		Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
2007-08-12T15:42:00.000Z	noelferreira		It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
2007-08-12T15:42:00.000Z	noelferreira		The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
2007-08-12T15:42:00.000Z	noelferreira		. can you hrlp mr?
2007-08-12T15:43:00.000Z	nixternal	noelferreira	you need to remove the key that is being referenced from ~/.ssh/known_hosts
2007-08-12T15:44:00.000Z	nixternal	noelferreira	all that means is that the server you are ssh'ing into has changed its key, and you have a different key in your known_hosts
2007-08-12T15:44:00.000Z	noelferreira		and the nixternal? i have to create other key? how could that happen (the key change?) )?
2007-08-12T15:44:00.000Z	nixternal	noelferreira	if you look closely to that error message you will see a line number that contains the key in question
2007-08-12T15:45:00.000Z	noelferreira		ya i see nixternal. should i use that one?
2007-08-12T15:45:00.000Z	nixternal	noelferreira	no, no need to create another key..all you have to do is edit the ~/.ssh/known_hosts and remove the key in there
2007-08-12T15:45:00.000Z	noelferreira		ok nixternal . thanks
2007-08-12T15:45:00.000Z	nixternal		edit the known_hosts on the computer you are ssh'ing from
2007-08-12T15:47:00.000Z	noelferreira	nixternal	the file is full of strange chars and i don't know what key to delete. edited the file from  the pc that i am trying to make the connection nixternal
2007-08-12T15:48:00.000Z	nixternal	noelferreira	are you familiar with vi/vim?
