2007-09-16T13:43:00.000Z	ejer		meh
2007-09-16T13:44:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	what is your actual question
2007-09-16T13:44:00.000Z	ejer	ompaul	is there any way to get a bigmem (for 4GB of ram) kernel that works with restricted modules?
2007-09-16T13:45:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	what makes you think it does not
2007-09-16T13:46:00.000Z	ejer	ompaul	what makes me thinkit does not is trying it and it not working ;)
2007-09-16T13:47:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	ahh well me trying this "ubuntu 4 gig ram" in google threw back several answers
2007-09-16T13:48:00.000Z	ejer	ompaul	I am running a custom kernel with 4g ram, all good, I just cannot get 3d acceleration
2007-09-16T13:48:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	I am kind of interested in that as I have big boxes that need converting in work to something a little more modern :-/
2007-09-16T13:48:00.000Z	ejer	ompaul	I suggest debian then...
2007-09-16T13:48:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	so which card is it just in case I actually know anything
2007-09-16T13:49:00.000Z	ejer	ompaul	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G70 [GeForce 7600 GS]  (rev a1) - but you cannot load ANY restricted modules
2007-09-16T13:50:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	hmm, I'll look at that before we do the conversions, (we run X over the wire and so have nice video cards on the servers for tuning desktops etc ..)
2007-09-16T13:50:00.000Z	ejer	ompaul	if you need bigmem support you will have trouble with ubuntu and 3d unfortunately, as well as wireless drivers if need be
2007-09-16T13:51:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	na this is an office - so we are looking at stuff like cat5e and the correct switches
2007-09-16T13:52:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	thanks for the heads up - I must go check out this
2008-08-23T12:49:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	I was about to say that
2008-08-23T12:50:00.000Z	ompaul	ejer	and are they too encrypted and can you access them without the primary device and if so are they secure, and if so what exactly were you trying to protect etc (no you don't need to answer ;-))
