2007-12-26T20:25:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n		I've managed to install the proprietarty ATI Radeon 9250 driver and I've got it running, but when I enable "videooverlay" in the device section of my xorg.conf file, all video and other overlayed stuff (like Tv-card) is of a wrong aspect ratio : I can only see the top half of the image. Where do I fix/configure this Xvideo stuff ?
2007-12-26T20:26:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	you definitely haven't managed to install a proprietary ati radeon 9250 drievr since such a thing doesn't exist
2007-12-26T20:27:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	aha and woops... I mean the ATI binary drivers from their own corporate website
2007-12-26T20:27:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	restricted drivers, is that the word I had to use ?
2007-12-26T20:27:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	a) that's still untrue since those won't work with 9250  b) ubuntu has fglrx as restricted drievrs. for help with ati.com ones, ask ati. they made that crud, they support it
2007-12-26T20:29:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-26T20:31:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	fglrx - I selected my card and OS at ati.com and they send me that 8.28 driver for their radeon cards. Downgraded ubuntu to edgy so that I was using an older kernel / Xserver - the newer ones weren't supported by that driver
2007-12-26T20:31:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	please run gutsy
2007-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	and use the proper driver
2007-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	not to mention you can't downgrade. you can only reinstall which is a sucky thing to do
2007-12-26T20:33:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	fglrx especially such an old driver is a lot owrse than current ubuntu drvers. eg. no compiz and bugs like the one you encoutnered probably
2007-12-26T20:33:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	I would love to, but what is the proper driver ? From what I've read, the fglrx driver from the ubuntu repos. doesn't support the 9250 anymore.
2007-12-26T20:33:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	ati is
2007-12-26T20:34:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	That's the one I was using in the first place, but I needed TV-out support.
2007-12-26T20:35:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	Is there a way to get TV-out support in that ati driver, other than going through the complicated-looking process of patching it ?
2007-12-26T20:36:00.000Z	wols	t-Omicr0n	atitvout possibly?
2007-12-26T20:38:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	thx, I will look into that (whatever it may be - I'll search google)
2007-12-26T20:55:00.000Z	t-Omicr0n	wols	I'm going away but I think you pointed me in the right direction, thanks a lot !
