2011-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	Cube``	squig	at plymouth
2011-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	squig	Cube``	can you get to a virtual console? you might want to boot up with out gfx
2011-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	Cube``	squig	nope, i cant. unless i can stop some stuff at grub. how can i force grub to display the installation list?
2011-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	squig		do you get the grub menu at all?
2011-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	Cube``	squig	no
2011-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	Cube``	squig	normally its set to boot a certain choice
2011-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	squig	Cube``	it usually has a delay, its on of the magic keys like f8 f5 del or tab to show the menu
2011-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	Cube``	squig	yes thats what im asking for
2011-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	squig	Cube``	might be easier to swtich back your gfx and set grub to wait, or boot from a live dick?
2011-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	squig		oops type disc
2011-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Cube``	squig	switch back? how
