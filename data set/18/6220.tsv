2008-06-06T00:29:00.000Z	inaru		other than the sudo?
2008-06-06T00:29:00.000Z	inaru		how to go to root in ubuntu????
2008-06-06T00:29:00.000Z	inaru		sudo su
2008-06-06T00:29:00.000Z	inaru		ok, thx
2008-06-06T00:29:00.000Z	inaru		cool
2008-06-06T00:30:00.000Z	inaru		sudo su
2008-06-06T00:30:00.000Z	inaru		if i use vi command, and want to insert on the conf file, i just type "i" right?
2008-06-06T00:32:00.000Z	ktheory	inaru	right, the 'i' command puts you in insert mode in vi.
2008-06-06T00:33:00.000Z	ktheory	inaru	hit ESC, then type ":wq <enter>" to save your changes and quit
2008-06-06T00:33:00.000Z	inaru	ktheory	but, it still can't be inserted. on the file property root user have access to read n write
2008-06-06T00:34:00.000Z	inaru	ktheory	and how to i exit the root user? i type exit and close the terminal, but when i open it again and type sudo su, it doesn't ask for password anymore
2008-06-06T00:35:00.000Z	ktheory	inaru	'sudo' remembers your password for several minutes...that's working as expected.
2008-06-06T00:36:00.000Z	inaru	ktheory	can i change the time interval to 0?
2008-06-06T00:36:00.000Z	inaru	ktheory	so it don't remember the password as i type exit?
2008-06-06T00:39:00.000Z	ktheory	inaru	You can change how long the 'sudo' command with cache your credentials by setting the 'timestamp_timeout' paramets in the Defaults section of /etc/sudoers (google it for more info)...but most people just leave the default.
