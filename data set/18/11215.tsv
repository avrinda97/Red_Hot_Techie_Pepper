2007-04-08T15:04:00.000Z	tobi		I don't have any thumbnails in nautilus(Feisty) is that a known problem?
2007-04-08T15:06:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	you should join the ubuntu+1 channel, I'm not sure it's name though, something like ubuntu+1
2007-04-08T15:06:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	there is nobody, who can help me
2007-04-08T15:07:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	what isn't thumbnailing exactly, video or pictures?
2007-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	video, pictures, SVGs, textfiles...
2007-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	I'm not sure if this will work, but open a nautilus window (open your home folder)
2007-04-08T15:09:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	then click Edit -> Preferences
2007-04-08T15:09:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	then go to the Preview tab
2007-04-08T15:09:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	done
2007-04-08T15:09:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	what does it say there?
2007-04-08T15:10:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	Previews are on, for local files only
2007-04-08T15:10:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	and for images <3MB
2007-04-08T15:11:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	I have to check, all the video/pictures/SVG's are on your HD, not on the network, right?
2007-04-08T15:11:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	yes, they are an my HD
2007-04-08T15:11:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	and you have Totem (I think totem is what does the previews) installed still?
2007-04-08T15:12:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	yes, totem is installed
2007-04-08T15:12:00.000Z	bobbob1016	tobi	not sure then, sorry
2007-04-08T15:13:00.000Z	tobi	bobbob1016	thanks nevertheless
