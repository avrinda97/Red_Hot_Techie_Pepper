2007-08-03T06:05:00.000Z	ice_cream		lo; i still cant get a script to run at startup as root.  It's just a script, not a service.. i've tried  'su - root /path/to/file' in rc.local, but that doesnt seem to fly
2007-08-03T06:07:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	You dont need to specify su for that. Just the path to the executable.
2007-08-03T06:07:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	What kind of file is at the end of that path?
2007-08-03T06:08:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	does it matter where the script is located?
2007-08-03T06:08:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	if it's in /home/someuser, it will not run as root?
2007-08-03T06:09:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	no, it should run
2007-08-03T06:09:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	if i just run it with sudo, it works
2007-08-03T06:10:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	but I have no idea where to put it so it will go as root on startup
2007-08-03T06:10:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	rc.local is the correct place.  Are you sure that root has access to run the script normally?
2007-08-03T06:12:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	actually.. it's very interesting.. sometimes the output file does not exist, and then root does not have the rights to write to it
2007-08-03T06:13:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	Thats odd.
2007-08-03T06:15:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	Hes confused
2007-08-03T06:16:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	it may be a delicate thing to do.. the script involves altering my cpuspeed.  I may just chmod u+w the whole directory
2007-08-03T06:24:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	i think i've got it.. need to test it out =)
2007-08-03T06:38:00.000Z	ice_cream	Pici	bah... this file only exists if a certain command is typed after my WM starts...
2008-04-04T20:41:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	don't do that.
2008-04-04T20:42:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	dont play with the bot like that. Theres already enough traffic in here.
2008-12-04T00:45:00.000Z	Pici	ice_cream	That package should exist no matter what release you're using.
