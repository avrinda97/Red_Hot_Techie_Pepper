2007-02-08T12:47:00.000Z	samin		thanks guys for the games tips!
2007-02-08T12:47:00.000Z	samin		I've actually tried openarena
2007-02-08T12:48:00.000Z	samin		when i run openarena, the graphics are weird (the rendering is psycadelic). I have the same problem when running tremulous
2007-02-08T12:48:00.000Z	samin		does anyone have ideas why this happens?
2007-02-08T12:49:00.000Z	samin		i would suggest ubuntu as it is appears to be the best supported
2007-02-08T12:49:00.000Z	samin		yeah
2007-02-08T12:50:00.000Z	samin		agree with flannel
2007-02-08T12:52:00.000Z	samin		has anyone here played openarena and/or tremulous?
2007-02-08T12:53:00.000Z	shatrat	samin	ive played tremulous, its fun
2007-02-08T12:53:00.000Z	samin		freeflyer: that's true, but ubuntu seems easoer to use
