2008-07-13T07:21:00.000Z	obf213		i can't take this firefox crashing everytime flash comes on
2008-07-13T07:21:00.000Z	obf213		its getting quite annoying
2008-07-13T07:22:00.000Z	td123	obf213	what ff version do you have?
2008-07-13T07:23:00.000Z	obf213	td123	ff3
2008-07-13T07:24:00.000Z	td123	obf213	did you do a full update of the system?
2008-07-13T07:24:00.000Z	td123	obf213	what I mean is do you have ff3rc2 or ff3
2008-07-13T07:25:00.000Z	obf213	td123	i think its just ff3.
2008-07-13T07:26:00.000Z	td123	obf213	type into the terminal "firefox --version" and paste what you get back
2008-07-13T07:26:00.000Z	obf213	td123	Mozilla Firefox 3.0, Copyright (c) 1998 - 2008 mozilla.org
2008-07-13T07:27:00.000Z	td123	obf213	what flash player did you install?
2008-07-13T07:28:00.000Z	obf213	td123	i don't know , regular flash?
2008-07-13T07:30:00.000Z	td123	obf213	type "aptitude show flashplugin-nonfree" and does it say yes, next to installed?
2008-07-13T07:32:00.000Z	td123	obf213	hmm... dunno, that plugin seems to be really stable along with ff3 (I haven't heard if it crashing once) try googleing it and include the website that is crashing it
2008-07-13T07:33:00.000Z	td123	obf213	you could try reinstalling ff3 and flash freshly and see if you're configuration is screwed up but other then that, dunno
2008-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	td123	obf213	you could also just remove flash all together to stop making it crash
2008-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	obf213	td123	quick question does your firefox ask you to save tabs.
2008-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	td123	obf213	yes, I leave that since I sometimes say yes :)
2008-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	td123	obf213	you can run update manager and press check to see if there are any updates for you but ff3 w/ adobe flash should be as stable as they get
