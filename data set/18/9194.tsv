2009-04-23T10:40:00.000Z	profx		anyone good with DHCP in a Windows environment?
2009-04-23T10:40:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	probably the people in #windows or #windows-server
2009-04-23T10:41:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	im asking in here
2009-04-23T10:41:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	dont get on my bad side, you wont like it
2009-04-23T10:42:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	pardon?
2009-04-23T10:42:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	don't start none, won't be none
2009-04-23T10:43:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	right, so if you need help with Windows DHCP Server, ask in #windows or #windows-server
2009-04-23T10:43:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	repeating is both annoying an not useful
2009-04-23T10:43:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	you're not going to get any help by acting like this
2009-04-23T10:44:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	maybe you just need to ignore any further comments from me, to save us both some time
2009-04-23T10:44:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	no problem there, if you'd stop making them and maybe say something more useful.
2009-04-23T10:45:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	saying something 'useful' in your eyes, isnt my purpose of being here, so just continue to do what you were doing before I dropped in
2009-04-23T10:45:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	just drop the attitude already.
2009-04-23T10:45:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	stop posting messages to be, and it will 'drop'
2009-04-23T10:46:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	we can take this private, if you prefer.
2009-04-23T10:47:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	take what to private exactly?
2009-04-23T10:47:00.000Z	profx	Gnea	i insist you do not continue to annoy me
2009-04-23T10:48:00.000Z	Gnea	profx	or?
