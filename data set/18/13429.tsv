2006-01-28T06:24:00.000Z	n00b	navarone	do yuou know where i can find a thesaurus version?
2006-01-28T06:26:00.000Z	navarone	n00b	use synaptic and search for thesaurus
2006-01-28T06:44:00.000Z	navarone	n00b	sudo apt-get install dict-moby-thesaurus  <-- should then be accessible thru dictionary frontend gui
2006-01-28T06:45:00.000Z	n00b	navarone	i did install that but there is no sign of it appearing in the dictionary GUI
2006-01-28T06:45:00.000Z	navarone	n00b	didi you try finding it in the drop down menu for the databases?
2006-01-28T06:46:00.000Z	n00b	navarone	which one is it?
2006-01-28T06:47:00.000Z	navarone	n00b	look for moby something
2006-01-28T06:48:00.000Z	n00b	navarone	okay i found... now how do i make it so that it searches through both the thesaurus and the dictionary?
2006-01-28T06:49:00.000Z	n00b	navarone	i figured that out... thanks for the help :)
2006-01-28T06:49:00.000Z	navarone	n00b	is it in the dictionary?
