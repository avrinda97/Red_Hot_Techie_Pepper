2009-10-02T05:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	segfaults are usually a programming issue, not much you can do at end user level
2009-10-02T05:02:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	Is there anything you can do to -cause- them?
2009-10-02T05:04:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	Well, what was the last thing you did before it happened?
2009-10-02T05:04:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	I tried to play a music file from a folder on my desktop. Never did that before.
2009-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	Which is to say it never had a problem with me doing that. I always open it that way.
2009-10-02T05:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	Well, try rebooting. It might not help, but in a nutshell, segfaulting is a memory thing.
2009-10-02T05:06:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	I've rebooted twice now. Should I just leave the thing alone for a while?
2009-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2009-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	Dapper Drake.
2009-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	Oh wow, is there something preventing you from upgrading?
2009-10-02T05:09:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	Only a dangerous lack of computer (specifically, Ubuntu) literacy.
2009-10-02T05:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	end of life. Do you want help upgrading? We'll walk you through.
2009-10-02T05:10:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	(and possibly Flannel) Is that something I need to download? Or pay for?
2009-10-02T05:10:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	no
2009-10-02T05:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	From medium to medium, they're all about the same.
2009-10-02T05:12:00.000Z	shinichizio	bobertdos	Ok, good. I have dial-up, so size is a nontrivial issue.
2009-10-02T05:13:00.000Z	bobertdos	shinichizio	If you wouldn't mind a BIT of money, you could always order a disc.
