2010-02-11T15:05:00.000Z	knoppies	indus	not that one, the complicated one.
2010-02-11T15:07:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	complicated one hehe
2010-03-09T11:58:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	nope
2010-03-09T11:59:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	:) not really helpful answer i know
2010-03-09T11:59:00.000Z	knoppies	indus	agreed, but its better than no answer.
2010-03-09T12:00:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	the gdm is tied up with a lot of things so i believe it wont be easy though it may be possible
2010-03-09T12:01:00.000Z	knoppies	indus	I actually want the old style of logging in back, Ive found some python scripts that bring back some functionality, but they not exactly what Im looking for.
2010-03-09T12:02:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	whats wrong with new gdm,
2010-03-09T12:04:00.000Z	knoppies	indus	I prefer where you dont have to click "log in" before logging in, where <tab> switches from username to password. And I would like to be able to use (pre-packaged) themes again.
2010-03-09T12:05:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	aah yes i miss the themes
2010-03-09T12:05:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	but i thnk those can be changed
2010-03-09T12:05:00.000Z	knoppies	indus	you can change the background and things, but not quite the same way you could in the old GDM.
2010-03-09T12:05:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	true i hear
2010-03-09T12:06:00.000Z	indus	knoppies	iam using lucid these days :) with some purple gdm
2010-03-09T12:06:00.000Z	knoppies	indus	Im hoping that as they develop it, these features trickle back. Maybe I should give lucid a try.
