2005-06-16T10:38:00.000Z	woodwizzle		How can I install inotify in hoary?
2005-06-16T10:39:00.000Z	woodwizzle		I thought i had it turned on, but udev did not create an device
2005-06-16T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	aiui, inotify in 2.6.10 was screwed, you'd need to make your own 2.6.12rc and make sure your inotify user stuff was ready
2005-06-16T10:42:00.000Z	woodwizzle	bob2	You can compile new kernels in ubuntu?
2005-06-16T10:42:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	of course
2005-06-16T10:43:00.000Z	woodwizzle	bob2	Where do you get the source for the standard ubuntu kernel? or is it in /usr/src/linux alreadty
2005-06-16T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	inotify support will only make it faster, not do anything new
2005-06-16T10:44:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	well, as I said, I think inotify in 2.6.10 is screwed, so you'd need to go to 2.6.12 or something, so you'd have to get it from kernel.org...
2005-06-16T10:45:00.000Z	woodwizzle	bob2	ah i c. What about breezy?? do the breezy kernels have inotify?
2005-06-16T10:45:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	breezy kernels are still screwed, aiui
2005-10-11T12:25:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	grep -i notify /boot/config-$(uname -r)
2005-10-11T12:25:00.000Z	woodwizzle	bob2	that returns: CONFIG_INOTIFY=y
2005-10-11T12:26:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	there you go
2005-10-11T12:28:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	/usr/share/doc/linux-image-$(uname -r)/
2005-10-11T12:28:00.000Z	woodwizzle	bob2	that doesn't tell me what version of the inotify patch is in that kernel
2005-10-11T12:29:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	sure it does
2005-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	indeed
2005-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	bob2	woodwizzle	it was a subtle hint for you to read the changelog
