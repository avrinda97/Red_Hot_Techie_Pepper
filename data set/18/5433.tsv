2010-02-16T09:01:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	greetings. i am trying to get a network/internet connection at all
2010-02-16T09:02:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	wireless or wired?
2010-02-16T09:02:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	wired, desktop computer, brand new hardware build
2010-02-16T09:02:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file?
2010-02-16T09:03:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	no, not really, since the computer has no networking ability whatsoever
2010-02-16T09:03:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	take a look at it.. does it have only 2 lines?
2010-02-16T09:04:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	it references lo and eth0, iface eth0 inet dhcp and auto eth0
2010-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	worth a try.. open the file with sudo nano /etc/networking/interfaces
2010-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	i used pico, that's ok right?
2010-02-16T09:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	yep
2010-02-16T09:06:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	ok, i changed them to eth1, restarting now
2010-02-16T09:07:00.000Z	zeleftikam	Izinucs	we have magic! Working great. Thanks very much. This problem was caused because I installed Ubuntu Server on one PC, and got it running great, then i built a new PC with an IDENTICAL motherboard and put the disk in it and it booted but for some reason it's eth1 on this mobo and eth0 on the old one. strange.
2010-02-16T09:08:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	great.. :)
2010-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	you want a server or desktop?
2010-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	then ubuntu server
2010-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	and like greezmunkey said
2010-03-27T08:50:00.000Z	Izinucs	zeleftikam	you won't have any issues with the server version.. remember there's no gui
