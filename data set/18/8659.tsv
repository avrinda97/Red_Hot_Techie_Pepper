2007-08-10T15:58:00.000Z	faileas		hmm, if i needed to compile stuff, what package would i need?
2007-08-10T15:59:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	that depends on what you need to compile. The Linux world has languages I've never even HEARD of.
2007-08-10T16:00:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	do a gcc -dumpver at a command line.
2007-08-10T16:02:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	gcc: no input files
2007-08-10T16:02:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	that means you have gcc.
2007-08-10T16:05:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	4.1.2
2007-08-10T16:06:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	you have a very recent version of gcc. You SHOULD be all set.
2007-08-10T05:21:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	you're saying that it'd be possible to (for example) format a partition ext2, install Windows on it and expect it to run?
2007-08-10T05:21:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	it can't BOOT from anything but NTFS and FAT. it can have third party FS installed as IFS, or have raw disk filters
2007-08-10T05:22:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	IFS = FUSE ;)
2007-08-10T05:58:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	NT, not dos
2007-08-10T06:01:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	i'd almost want to say joe sixpack wouldn't be on IRC, but i' sure i'm wrong ;)
2007-08-18T15:20:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	ubuntu respected an existing windows and FC dual boot; I now have a triple boot. I've a strong suspicion you can tell the ubuntu installer to clobber one of your existing partitions and it'll do the Right Thing.
2007-08-18T15:20:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	i hope so ;p
2007-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	not much wrong with XP maintained right ;p
2007-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	sauvin	faileas	I'll admit I don't maintain it. Even when it was FRESH, it took calendar time to boot.
2007-08-19T12:50:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	too many things starting on start, and terrible fragmentation (stock windows defrag is shit) probably
2007-09-07T12:50:00.000Z	faileas	sauvin	there is no right or wrong way, only users ;)
