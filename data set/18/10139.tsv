2007-01-07T13:41:00.000Z	rdv		hello
2007-01-07T13:41:00.000Z	rdv		where does Ubuntu keep its record of installed packages?
2007-01-07T13:42:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	use "locate *.deb"
2007-01-07T13:44:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	 roger that.
2007-01-07T13:45:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	that information is in one of the .deb files?
2007-01-07T13:46:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	i once found information telling me exactly when i installed certain packages
2007-01-07T13:46:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	no you should find a directory named archives, with all teh *.debs in it.
2007-01-07T13:47:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	i found that directory yes
2007-01-07T13:48:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	are you running X?
2007-01-07T13:49:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	ok, take a note of where that archive/*.deb directory is, and then open nautilus from a terminal, with gksudo nautilus.
2007-01-07T13:50:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	i think there's an easier way.  some log file told me what i installed and when.  i can't find it now though...
2007-01-07T13:51:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	 cool, go for it.
2007-01-07T13:51:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	found it.  it was just archived by logrotate
2007-01-07T13:52:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	?
2007-01-07T13:53:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	/var/log/dpkg.log ... the empty file there fooled me.  i had to look at the .gz'd archives
2007-01-07T13:54:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	 your looking for *.deb files remember? Where are they?
2007-01-07T13:55:00.000Z	rdv	n2diy	i found the deb files, but i wasn't looking for them, i was looking for a log
2007-01-07T13:56:00.000Z	n2diy	rdv	 I thought you wanted to purge your packages?
