2007-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	I'm not tha person, but ive done it before
2007-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	i've got some questions after talking with one of the admins here. Is kerberos an active function of authentication in AD, or something they have to add?
2007-10-12T16:11:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	what do you mean? are you asking if microsoft uses it to implement active directory?
2007-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	AD is active directory....
2007-10-12T16:13:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	so what are you asking me? lol i'm not picking up your question
2007-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	well your right about the admin, he is a dumb ass, kerberos is an open source alternative used to connect to AD environments, there is nothing to be done on the server side, it all works with microsoft stuff
2007-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	you dont have to change anything on the server to allow ubuntu machines to cnnect
2007-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	that's what i thought. So this will be as simple as setting LDAP/Kerberos up on this workstation, configure it to this network, and i'm good to go.
2007-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	exactly, i would make sure you know all your network settings though, you'll need them to connect
2007-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	got em all already. I just wanted to make sure i'm on the same page as the documentation, the sysadmins threw me for a loop earlier when i brought this up.
2007-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	yea, ignore those windows junkies, they dont know what they are talking about, maybe you can convince them to dump those windows servers in the process! :)
2007-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	good luck with them having a MS contract and 7000 win clients.
2007-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	lol
2007-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	yea, thats true
2007-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	but, i silently spread the dark side inside the office here, and hope it contaminates the rest of the general pop. :)
2007-10-12T16:18:00.000Z	ruz322	Iceshadow	that's great
2007-10-12T16:55:00.000Z	Iceshadow	ruz322	there is one thing i ran into here that might be a problem. The UNIX servers on the AD server have to be enabled
