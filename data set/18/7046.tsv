2008-02-15T10:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	speaker219	you want to find the file eggdrop that you have installed?
2008-02-15T10:24:00.000Z	speaker219	prince_jammys	i want to find the eggdrop directory that has eggdrop.conf in it etc
2008-02-15T10:25:00.000Z	speaker219		I checked the man page, not there
2008-02-15T10:25:00.000Z	prince_jammys	speaker219	try        locate eggdrop
2008-02-15T10:26:00.000Z	speaker219	prince_jammys	returned nothing
2008-02-15T10:26:00.000Z	prince_jammys	speaker219	      find  /usr -type d -name '*eggdrop*'
2008-02-15T10:26:00.000Z	speaker219	prince_jammys	probably have to upddb
2008-02-15T10:26:00.000Z	speaker219		ok,thanks
2008-02-15T10:27:00.000Z	speaker219		um
2008-02-15T10:27:00.000Z	speaker219		prince_jammys
2008-02-15T10:27:00.000Z	speaker219		server@server:~$ /usr -type d -name '*eggdrop*'
2008-02-15T10:27:00.000Z	speaker219		-bash: /usr: is a directory
2008-02-15T10:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	speaker219	find /usr -name '*eggdrop*'
2008-02-15T10:28:00.000Z	speaker219		thanks prince_jammys, sorry, i don't use linux too often except for an irc server that i have :p
2008-02-15T10:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	speaker219	and find /usr -name 'eggdrop*'   (no * at the beginning)  and if all else fails, the somewhat timeconsuming     sudo find / -name '*eggdrop*'
2008-02-15T10:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	speaker219	the time you got an error is because "find" is missing at the beginning of the command, so -type d is ok (finds directories only)
