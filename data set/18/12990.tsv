2006-04-05T14:24:00.000Z	fromvega		How do I enable the 5.10 repositories?
2006-04-05T14:24:00.000Z	AstralJava	fromvega	If you're using Hoary, you need to replace every mention of hoary to breezy in your /etc/apt/sources.list.
2006-04-05T14:26:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	I'm using the 5.10, Breezy right? But my repositories are all Hoary
2006-04-05T14:28:00.000Z	AstralJava	fromvega	What does lsb_release -a tell you?
2006-04-05T14:28:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	 Description:    Ubuntu (The Breezy Badger Release)
2006-04-05T14:29:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	 so, why my repositories are all set to hoary?
2006-04-05T14:29:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	I have replaced all 'hoary' to 'breezy', but it with errors
2006-04-05T14:31:00.000Z	AstralJava	fromvega	Could you post your sources.list to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and let us know the link to it, please?
2006-04-05T14:31:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	ok
2006-04-05T14:31:00.000Z	AstralJava		Hi Seveas.

2006-04-05T14:33:00.000Z	AstralJava		Hi crimsun.
2006-04-05T14:34:00.000Z	AstralJava	fromvega	That's weird, but I suspect it's got something to do with those backports, of which I don't know anything about. Hopefully someone else can help you on those?
2006-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	could you share your repo list?
2006-04-05T14:37:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	I already found one, thank you!
2006-04-05T14:38:00.000Z	AstralJava	fromvega	Okay good, here's mine anyway. It might have some weird things in it, but it works: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11175
2006-04-05T14:40:00.000Z	fromvega	AstralJava	thank you!
2006-04-05T14:40:00.000Z	AstralJava	fromvega	No prob. Did you get it working?
