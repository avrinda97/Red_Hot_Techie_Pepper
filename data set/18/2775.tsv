2010-03-01T00:06:00.000Z	madjoe		Hi! If there's a fix in a new stable version of Cairo-Dock that's killing me, and the release is not yet available through Synaptic, would it be wrong to install that new release by hand? What's the best practice?
2010-03-01T00:07:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	if you insist on compiling from source, use checkinstall: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall
2010-03-01T00:08:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	thnx
2010-03-01T00:16:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	I guess I should remove the old version first, right?
2010-03-01T00:17:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	that would probably be a good idea :) that way, when you go to uninstall it once the ubuntu package is released, you won't have to worry about collisions
2010-03-01T00:19:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	I think it would be ok if I use just remove, not complete remove, to save my config, plugins, etc... what do you think?
2010-03-01T00:19:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	that depends on where they live. if you leave them in place, checkinstall might complain and fail, or it might just overwrite them.
2010-03-01T00:20:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	good point
2010-03-01T00:26:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	would this method be more appropriate (the first described) http://www.glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=From%20the%20repository&lang=en
2010-03-01T00:27:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	oh, there's a 3rd-party repository with the package you want? sure, that would be easier than checkinstall from source
2010-03-01T00:28:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	sweet
2010-03-01T00:34:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	wow, this is incredible.. I'm impressed with all this :)
2010-03-01T00:34:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	what is?
2010-03-01T00:35:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	hehe.. I just jumped from early version of an application that was unstable, buggy and no-good, with a stable, new release and I'm impressed that it actually *WORKS* now! LOL
2010-03-01T00:35:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	glad to hear it :)
2010-03-08T00:55:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	you need to put the 'f' last
2010-03-08T00:56:00.000Z	brjann	madjoe	only that one, as you're essentially saying -f <filename>
2010-03-08T00:56:00.000Z	madjoe	brjann	loud and clear! thnx!
