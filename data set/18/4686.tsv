2009-11-26T10:30:00.000Z	Fatb0y		Can anyone tell me why Ubuntu doesn't see any of my Sata Harddrives?
2009-11-26T10:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	if they are additional internal drives you might have to add them to the fstab file so Ubuntu will know about them
2009-11-26T10:32:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	i am assuming this can be done during the text install?  just go to the terminal?
2009-11-26T10:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	i'd recommend you use "gksu gedit /etc/fstab" but you'll need to know what the dev id of your drives is and create mount points for them - a little research on your end may be required...
2009-11-26T10:34:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	all my drives are sata actually, but my first drive starts on the Sata 2 controller not sata 1.
2009-11-26T10:34:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	i can't even get all the way into the boot live cd inorder to use gedit.
2009-11-26T10:35:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	when i say it doesn't recognize the drives it also means it fails to load the live cd as there are no drives available.
2009-11-26T10:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	use "sudo fdisk -l" in a terminal to find all you correct /dev/sdX# that you'll need, how many partitions do you want to mount?
2009-11-26T10:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	oh man you you running a livecd?
2009-11-26T10:36:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	as long as i get 1 drive up then i would be fine.  i can format and mount the second drive after install.
2009-11-26T10:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	if you are then you don't need fstab!  just mount the drives!
2009-11-26T10:36:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	no, not running a live cd now.
2009-11-26T10:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	ok, then use the fdisk -l to find your partitions!  sd then a letter and number!
2009-11-26T10:37:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	so far all i have been able to do on this machine is get ubuntu running in vmware but i want ubuntu to be the main OS on this machine and then just load windows in vm when needed
2009-11-26T10:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	you also need to know what type of partition they are ext3 ext4 nfts etc
2009-11-26T10:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Fatb0y	you are aware that there is no gaming in VMs right?
2009-11-26T10:38:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	yes i am aware
2009-11-26T10:38:00.000Z	Fatb0y	ZykoticK9	this machine is not for gaming its for office work / serviing up files   i have another machine for games
