2008-10-01T13:41:00.000Z	rfxcasey		anywhere I can get a little tutoring on irc
2008-10-01T13:43:00.000Z	rfxcasey		what irc client do you all use?
2008-10-01T13:43:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	i use firefox via port 80 because they're bitches at my uni.
2008-10-01T13:44:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	what is your uni?
2008-10-01T13:44:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	Montpellier II, France. They block everything except port 80 (including SSH), so people go on youtube and msn but no IRC/SFTP for me.
2008-10-01T13:45:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	oh you mean your ISP
2008-10-01T13:45:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	no, the university network.
2008-10-01T13:46:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	usually when they type your name its highlighted. There might be IRC scripts that do that tho.
2008-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	that would be a good suggestion to do to Xchat devs ;)
2008-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	so there is no script for that
2008-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	or would I have to write my own
2008-10-01T13:51:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	that may exist, theres an huge amount of scripts, i dont know all of them
2008-10-01T13:52:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	thats just default output from the client i use when i press Tab for name autocompletion xD
2008-10-01T13:55:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	i don't know what client you use. Right click the names and u'll see if your client got options (mIrc got the very famous "slap" one)
2008-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	sorry to be a pain but what is the best client in your opinion
2008-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	Sdz	rfxcasey	its the one that fits your user needs :D thats a lame answer but i didnt try them all so i cant say
2008-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	well I'm not looking for the definative answer just your opinion
2008-10-01T13:58:00.000Z	rfxcasey	Sdz	actually Kirc looks really sleek
