2007-09-29T15:29:00.000Z	Eleaf		what's a good 'hang out' channel?
2007-09-29T15:29:00.000Z	soundray	Eleaf	#ubuntu-offtopic
2007-09-29T15:29:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	I can't, I was banned from there like a year ago?..
2007-09-29T15:30:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	any other ideas?
2007-09-29T15:30:00.000Z	soundray	Eleaf	go to #ubuntu-ops and grovel
2007-09-29T15:31:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	I'd rather not.
2007-09-29T15:31:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	(I already have a bunch in the past)
2007-09-29T15:31:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	.. I'm banned from #ubuntu-ops..
2007-09-29T15:32:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	oh well, do you know of any other places?  The main channels are too crowded
2007-09-29T15:32:00.000Z	soundray	Eleaf	try the big chatroom with the stars on the ceiling. It even has pubs and beer.
2007-09-29T15:33:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	? ;P
2007-09-29T15:33:00.000Z	soundray	Eleaf	sometimes also referred to as RL or Real Life
2007-09-29T15:33:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	right
2007-09-29T15:34:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	I'm at my computer now, however.  Any ideas?
2007-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	soundray	Eleaf	no.
2007-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	thanks mate.
2007-09-29T15:39:00.000Z	Eleaf	soundray	brrrzzzt!
