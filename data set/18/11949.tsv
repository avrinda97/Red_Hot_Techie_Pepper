2006-11-13T06:40:00.000Z	jordo23		Anyone know why when I am trying to install flashplugin-nonfree it says it isn't available if I have multiverse installed? (Edgy)
2006-11-13T06:40:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	no idea, but you might prefer to install the FP9 beta anyhow

2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	jordo23		Webben: is there a howto or a package for that file?
2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	the forums probably have a howto by now; I don't think there's a deb yet
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	but IIRC you just drop it in your plugins dir
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	jordo23		I don't even show flashplugin-nonfree in any of the gui package managers either...
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	jordo23		Is that not supported by edgy?
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	by definition stuff in universe and multiverse is "unsupported"
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	webben		but it should in theory still /work/
2006-11-13T06:43:00.000Z	jordo23		Yeah....symantics......but it's not listed.....wierd
2006-11-13T06:43:00.000Z	jordo23	webben	did you install this from source?
2006-11-13T06:43:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	it's not "source" it's a compiled plugin
2006-11-13T06:44:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	like the other ones in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
2006-11-13T06:44:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	apt-cache show flashplugin-nonfree shows that all that does it pull down a tarfile from Adobe anyway
2006-11-13T06:44:00.000Z	webben		it just handles the installation and uninstallation for you
2006-11-13T06:47:00.000Z	jordo23	webben	what's the default install location for Konq?
2006-11-13T06:49:00.000Z	webben	jordo23	run "locate konqueror" to see for yourself
