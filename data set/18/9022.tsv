2012-04-27T02:18:00.000Z	ox1de		what is the difference between xubuntu and ubuntu? is there anyway to load another kernel?
2012-04-27T02:19:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	The difference between xubuntu and ubuntu is the user interface/desktop environment.
2012-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	What OS are you running now?
2012-04-27T02:25:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	Uh oh. Oldish CPU?
2012-04-27T02:26:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	I don't know your experience level, so let me know if I need to clarify stuff
2012-04-27T02:27:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	If your computer is a car, the kernel is the software's "engine"
2012-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	If you have a list of kernels available to you in grub, choose the oldest. See if there are some that have -pae at the end of the name and others that don't.
2012-04-27T02:30:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	Most likely it has the same kernel as normal Ubuntu12
2012-04-27T02:33:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	ok. I'm doing some googling for you real fast.
2012-04-27T02:33:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	http://www.bestubuntu.com/non-pae-kernel-wont-be-dropped-in-12-04-lts.html
2012-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	 check it out!!! http://askubuntu.com/questions/122841/why-is-12-04-using-a-pae-dependent-kernel-by-default
2012-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	scroll most of the way down
2012-04-27T02:37:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	so you were right!
2012-04-27T02:40:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	I hope it works. It looks like it will from the research I did
2012-04-27T02:49:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	Yes it will.
2012-04-27T02:49:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	the only difference is that the installer is text-mode for alternate.
2012-04-27T02:50:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	the normal liveCD puts you in a graphical environment
2012-04-27T02:50:00.000Z	Striking7	ox1de	 yeah. Not a big deal - it's just not "pretty" when it's in the installer
