2010-11-01T23:31:00.000Z	Eventyret		How can i check for error messages at startup ? - I havnt been able to read the full message.
2010-11-01T23:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eventyret	check the logs and dmesg; but many messages from the init system may get lost
2010-11-01T23:37:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	so what you mean use dmesg and grep or something i know it said couldt not find /lib something rest i cant remember
2010-11-01T23:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eventyret	dmesg is only for kernel messages. try /var/log/syslog /var/log/daemon.log etc.
2010-11-01T23:38:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	ok thank you i will
2010-11-08T19:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eventyret	right click n the terminal window.
2010-11-08T19:52:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	there is no options for that ><
2010-11-08T19:52:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	never mind :P
2010-11-08T19:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eventyret	no problem
2010-11-08T20:46:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	do you know if madwifi has been removed ? found a guide to my wifi drivers but cant download it from there ?
2010-11-08T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eventyret	b43 does not work for you ?
2010-11-08T20:47:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	well i got a ASUS K70IO that has issues with the WLAN making it so i cant restart my computer, it just freezes with a black screen
2010-11-08T20:47:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	after 3 days of googling i figured it was my WLAN
2010-11-08T20:47:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	computer shutsdown normal but if i use restart or reboot or halt it just freezes after "system now rebooting"
2010-11-08T20:54:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	guess not :P
2010-11-08T20:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eventyret	sorry i do not see how the wifi can be interfering in shutdown process ...
2010-11-08T20:56:00.000Z	Eventyret	erUSUL	well what is wierd is that i can do a clean shutdown but i cant reboot ><
