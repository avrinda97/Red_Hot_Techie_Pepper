2011-12-14T09:07:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	heh.  internal mic not working?
2011-12-14T09:07:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	laptop or something, ALC892 card?
2011-12-14T09:07:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	depending on the audio codec, support under linux is hit or miss.  I filed a few bugs against my laptop actually. that was one of them
2011-12-14T09:08:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	well, as I recall, there are a *ton* of variations you can try. apparently the manufacturer implementations are wide and varied
2011-12-14T09:09:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	you know, when setting up your codec
2011-12-14T09:09:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	I'd definitely start at a minimum by filing a bug on launchpad
2011-12-14T09:09:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	try testing an external mic if you can get one. even a cheap $5 one
2011-12-14T09:09:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	you can also try filing a bug w/ the kernel folks
2011-12-14T09:10:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	my mom's internal mic didn't work, but after switching codec settings, it did
2011-12-14T09:10:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	check launchpad and forum for existing reports for your audio device
2011-12-14T09:11:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	do you know your audio card? should be listed in lspci
2011-12-14T09:13:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto - here's a guide someone wrote
2011-12-14T09:13:00.000Z	nemo	ImTheDude	good luck try google, try suggestions on that page, and definitely file a bug
