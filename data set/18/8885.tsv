2007-06-10T07:05:00.000Z	spasticteapot	underbear	Try downloading again.
2007-06-10T07:05:00.000Z	spasticteapot	underbear	Sounds dumb, but it happened to me once.
2007-06-10T07:05:00.000Z	underbear	spasticteapot	 I've downloaded 3x .  and also reburnt the disk 3x.  ive been reinstalling all night.  the same version 7.04 .
