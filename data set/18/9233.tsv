2007-04-26T12:18:00.000Z	Spoon98		do any of you have experience setting up wlan connections with ubuntu?
2007-04-26T12:19:00.000Z	Spoon98		I have a wlan card 2200bg, in windows it needs to be turned on before it can be used, in ubuntu I don't know how to do this... the driver is installed, but the button that would activate  the card does not activate it...
2007-04-26T12:20:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	what do you mean the driver is installed?
2007-04-26T12:23:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	do you have a terminal open?
2007-04-26T12:23:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	please open one if you don't and type "ifconfig -a"
2007-04-26T12:23:00.000Z	Spoon98	yigal	not currently, unfortunately, I only have wlan, so in order to be on the internet I have to boot up in windows... :(
2007-04-26T12:24:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	ok, then have you read some of the wifi docs in the ubuntu wiki?
2007-04-26T12:24:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	they are usually quite good for getting wireless working
2007-04-26T12:32:00.000Z	Spoon98	yigal	Thanks! I'll try booting it up in linux and try some of this ;)
2007-04-26T12:33:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	awesome wireless can be tricky but it (almost) always works
2007-04-26T13:32:00.000Z	Spoon98	yigal	Hi again, couldn't get it to work from the wikipages... found a small cable though, so I am writing from linux now :) the iwconfig tool says that the radio is off, I think this could be the problem, but I can't find anywhere in the wiki that describes turning the radio on...
2007-04-26T13:33:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	did you find a wiki page for the chip?
2007-04-26T13:34:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	"yes :D" you get it?
2007-04-26T13:35:00.000Z	Spoon98	yigal	yes I found it:
2007-04-26T13:36:00.000Z	Spoon98	yigal	oops, sorry that was a bit long
2007-04-26T13:36:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	great, almost all wireless works in linux
2007-04-26T13:38:00.000Z	Spoon98	yigal	the only problem is that the guide doesn't activate the card :( the radio is still off
2007-04-26T13:38:00.000Z	yigal	Spoon98	if you know the chipset search ubuntuforums.org
