2008-02-23T23:38:00.000Z	amenado		Squawk-> i guess you can modify the initrd image to give you more waiting time
2008-02-23T23:38:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	waiting time?
2008-02-23T23:39:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	surely all required modules just get loaded as and when, dynamicaly as needed or during boot?
2008-02-23T23:41:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	thats booting for a usb disk, which could be bios related. Im trying to use a usb keyboard with a normal install. The problem I suspect is a module not loaded/compiled, but with no keyboard I cant see how I can load it
2008-02-23T23:42:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	if your booting from a usb disk then the driver has to load before the OS. Im trying to use a usb keyboard under ubuntu, so the OS is loaded
2008-02-23T23:43:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	even if you are right, how would I alter it? Given that I can't access ubuntu, since no keyboard?
2008-02-23T23:44:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	yes
2008-02-23T23:45:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	actualy hadnt considered that, but is an sshd server started by default?
2008-02-23T23:45:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	I can only guess at what configuration it has regarding ip addresses, since its a clean install and I have never booted it
2008-02-23T23:47:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	im installing ubuntu so I can cehck it out, see whats running by default, whats not, what needs configuring etc. I have good working knowledge of linux (gentoo mostly). But if I cant get into it once...
2008-02-23T23:47:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	will have a go now, but I doubt sshd started by default in normal install?
2008-02-25T01:00:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	iptables is a set of userspace tools for netfilter, so it can be
2008-02-25T01:01:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	cant be, sorry
2008-02-25T01:02:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	iptables is a set of userspace tools that control netfilter. They are nothing to do with the kernel, all you enable in kernel is netfilter
2008-02-25T01:02:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	its ok though, I figured out how to load iptables rules at boot
2008-02-25T01:04:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	quite enjoying using ubuntu, making me think about things rather than just knowing where stuff is in gentoo. Probably make me much more rounded
2008-02-25T23:14:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	I meant if he has a dhcp server running, not if he has a client on hte livecd
2008-02-29T00:56:00.000Z	Squawk	amenado	yeah sounds about right, im guessing as soneil said its probably something like firestarter rather than a script
