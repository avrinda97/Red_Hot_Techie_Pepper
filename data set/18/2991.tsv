2011-01-10T17:19:00.000Z	lorenzosu		I had a power-down while updating Ubuntu 10.04 and now the system is unbootable even in rescue mode. Anything I can do from the live CD?
2011-01-10T17:20:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	what exactly is it showing when trying to boot ?
2011-01-10T17:21:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	If I do a normal boot it freezes at gdm (user selection), meaning no keyboard or mouse is active.
2011-01-10T17:21:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	If I use rescue mode it halts at some post-mount script. Only thing I can do at that point is CTRL-ALT-DEL reboot
2011-01-10T17:23:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	I would use the live cd, boot in the live cd, mount the partitions and check them if you can see files. Looks like you have to reinstall but at least check to see if you can retreive/backup any files
2011-01-10T17:23:00.000Z	nimrod10		any rhytmbox user ?
2011-01-10T17:24:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	I can mount the partitions and see the files. I have a separate home partition but reinstalli will still be a big hassle
2011-01-10T17:24:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	do a fsck on the  /   partition where the system is installed
2011-01-10T17:24:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	maybe you don't need to reinstall ...
2011-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	nimrod10		has anybody been able to play a radio stream in rhytmbox 0.12.8 in Lucid ?  It fails for me with could not resolve proxy hostname, even though i have no proxy
2011-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	how?
2011-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	chroot?
2011-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	how what ?
2011-01-10T17:41:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	not re-install
2011-01-10T17:42:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	please put your words in a context, I don't understand what you want, have you understood my suggestions above ?
2011-01-10T17:45:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	sorry I missed the fdisk suggestion (I'm on freenode webchat)
2011-01-10T17:46:00.000Z	lorenzosu	nimrod10	sorry I missed the fdisk suggestion (I'm on freenode webchat)
2011-01-10T17:47:00.000Z	nimrod10	lorenzosu	use fsck  to check your disks , not fdisk
