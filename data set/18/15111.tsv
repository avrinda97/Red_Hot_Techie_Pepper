2005-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	Maikeru		hey
2005-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	Maikeru		I try and install a program and have libwxgtk2.4 and libwxgtk2.4-contrib installed but they are the ubuntu versions so the program won't accept it
2005-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	Maikeru		program is a .deb
2005-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	Maikeru		is there a way to tell it to just use the ubuntu ones and live with it
2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	Maikeru		sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb
2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	Maikeru		nvm
2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	Maikeru		seems --ignore-depends= works fine
2005-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	Maikeru		waste: error while loading shared libraries: libwx_gtk_xrc-2.4.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	Maikeru		oh joy
2005-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Maikeru	are you trying to install debian or 3rd party debs ?
2005-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	Maikeru		3rd party, but I got it to install anyway
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Maikeru	risky business
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	Maikeru		but now I'm having that problem with libwx_gtk_xrc, which I had when I built it from .tar.gz as well
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	Maikeru	thoreauputic	I know, but I figure it's worth it if I can get it to work
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	Maikeru		if I can't get it to work then I guess it
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	Maikeru		it's not worth it
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	Maikeru		:)
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Maikeru	OK - good luck :)
