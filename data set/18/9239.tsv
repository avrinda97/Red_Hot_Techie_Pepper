2007-10-31T10:21:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	I have gmail+thunderbird here.  What is the problem you're facing?
2007-10-31T10:22:00.000Z	sasank	mactimes	nothing happens... thunderbird doesn't ask me for a password atleast
2007-10-31T10:23:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	I guess not.
2007-10-31T10:23:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	Let me open thunderbird here and see what I have exactly
2007-10-31T10:24:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	Server name: pop.gmail.com Port: 995 Use secure connection: SSL
2007-10-31T10:25:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	Is that what you have in your configurations?
2007-10-31T10:26:00.000Z	sasank	mactimes	i am trying to use imap. this is what i have exactly http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=77662
2007-10-31T10:28:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	That changes a lot ot things.  Then, yes, if you're using IMAP, there IS a problem if 993 is closed.
2007-10-31T10:29:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	Also, there IS a problem if you intend to send emails using that configuration too, once 587 is closed
2007-10-31T10:29:00.000Z	sasank	mactimes	did you open up ports for pop3?
2007-10-31T10:29:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	What do you mean?  In iptables?
2007-10-31T10:31:00.000Z	sasank	mactimes	just asking how it works on pop.. if you did not open up any ports for pop... then it should not be necessary for imap
2007-10-31T10:31:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	Well, you only have to OPEN ports if you have CLOSED them.
2007-10-31T10:32:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	If you're behind NAT, it should not be a problem, once you access 993 and 587 tcp ports OUT
2007-10-31T10:34:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	iptables -L, then look for the rule number, do a iptables -D INPUT rule_number_here
2007-10-31T10:35:00.000Z	mactimes	sasank	For iptables matters, I would suggest you reading the tutorial from the topic set on #iptables
