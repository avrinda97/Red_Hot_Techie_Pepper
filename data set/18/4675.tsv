2010-07-28T08:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	i give natex's comment +1
2010-07-28T08:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	are you sure paltalk express is using only flash?  could this be a java issue?
2010-07-28T08:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ZykoticK9	you may well be right. it just that I get the flash complaint pop up
2010-07-28T08:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ZykoticK9	I do have java installed too
2010-07-28T08:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	are you using the default opensource java or the oracle/sun java (which is in the Partner repository, not turned on by default!)
2010-07-28T08:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ZykoticK9	I don't think I@m using the opensource version of java - ice-tea - ? How can I tell for sure?
2010-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	i get an error about OS!  You might have to try this in WINE Firefox!
2010-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ZykoticK9	no, express is web-based and it says it runs on windown, max and linux on their site from any browser like ff and opera
2010-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	see natex's comment ;)  good news
2010-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	only ubuntu users here ;)
2010-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ZykoticK9	but in repos and synaptic i see Oubountu etc also ;)

2011-06-30T23:34:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ZykoticK9	your reason sounds an ethical one. I would say that wubi is not making ubuntu rely on windows. I'm more interested on how it works from a purely functional/technical point of view
2011-06-30T23:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	livingdaylight	it most certainly DOES rely on windows.  BluesKaj +1
