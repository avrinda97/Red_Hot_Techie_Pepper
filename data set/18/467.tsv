2012-08-23T07:05:00.000Z	|Anthony|		well w/e you get what i'm saying
2012-08-23T07:06:00.000Z	|Anthony|		+1 to each of the numbers than... but that is the order

2012-08-23T07:08:00.000Z	|Anthony|		i installed fedora A) because grub borked and i couldn't boot B) cause i wanted to try it out
2012-08-23T07:08:00.000Z	|Anthony|		i was hoping that a new grub install would fix the issue
2012-08-23T07:08:00.000Z	cfhowlett	|Anthony|	#fedora
2012-08-23T07:10:00.000Z	cfhowlett	|Anthony|	cross distro, like croo repo, is ill advised at best.  Also, to try other distros, consider virtualbox
2012-08-28T06:29:00.000Z	cfhowlett	|Anthony|	as I understand, proposed updates are not cutting edge, they're bleeding edge.  Unless you REALLY need the latest and greatest (not fully vetted) shiny stuff, I'd pass.  That said, isn't it time to update to 12.04?
2012-08-28T06:30:00.000Z	|Anthony|	cfhowlett	lol i appreciate the offer, but from my testings with gnome3... i despise it
2012-08-28T06:30:00.000Z	cfhowlett	|Anthony|	consider k/l/x/ubuntu.  no gnome
2012-08-28T06:32:00.000Z	cfhowlett	|Anthony|	nice to have options.  :)  fwiw, I was forced to switch when UbuntuStudio adopted xfce.  Very VERY minor complaints not worth mentioning here.
2012-08-28T06:33:00.000Z	|Anthony|	cfhowlett	MATE has be recommended to me as well
2012-08-28T06:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	|Anthony|	take your word for it ... XFCE works for me!  (Slogan trademarked and registered.)
