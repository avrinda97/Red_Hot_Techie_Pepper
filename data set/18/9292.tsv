2011-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 theres no root password by default. if you set one, you can set it to a password via the passwd command
2011-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 same command passwd
2011-01-15T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 grub menus have a recovery/rescue mode i thought
2011-01-15T16:51:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	yes you are right............but it also require password i think
2011-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 you could also edit the grub line and replace 'quiet splash' with 'single' or '1' i think
2011-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 i tend to rember my passwords. so i rarelyneed to reset them :)
2011-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	its not mine,friend of mine
2011-04-30T21:25:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	any other option
2011-04-30T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 clarify what you want to do exactly
2011-04-30T21:27:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	i have 10.04 and want to upgrade to 11.04 or can format my laptop and install it,actually i dont have a good internet connection....so all my installed packages will be lost if i format my drive
2011-04-30T21:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 i would suggest a clean install and you dont backup your package files to 11.04 you reinstall the ones you have installed.
2011-04-30T21:38:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	you recommendedme clean install why so?is there problem in upgrading?
2011-04-30T22:12:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	congrats
2011-05-01T22:26:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	Yes, I need console-only, but it do not start
2012-05-27T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 thers several in the repos, and many sites have  ppas for themes such as the webupd8 site. it has ppsa and some good guides and reviews of various themes
2012-05-27T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coder2	 it really depends on exactly 'what' you are wantng to change the look of. the term 'themne' is a bit broad
2012-05-27T17:52:00.000Z	coder2	Dr_Willis	thank you
