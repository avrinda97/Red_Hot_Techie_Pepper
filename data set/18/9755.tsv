2007-03-24T09:19:00.000Z	tealson	bruenig	it's installed in /usr/local/Adobe/Acrobat 7.0
2007-03-24T09:19:00.000Z	bruenig	tealson	but where is the binary
2007-03-24T09:19:00.000Z	bruenig	tealson	full path I mean
2007-03-24T09:20:00.000Z	tealson	bruenig	the bin file is  /usr/local/Adobe/Acrobat 7.0/acroread
2007-03-24T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	tealson	you realize that is in the repositories right?
2007-03-24T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	tealson	if you can remove that and then do sudo apt-get install acroread, everything will be taken care for you
2007-03-24T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig		s/care/care of/
2007-03-24T09:21:00.000Z	tealson	bruenig	i just installed the new 7.04 beta and there is no acroread listed
2007-03-24T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	tealson	ok well then, here is what I would do, sudo ln -s "/usr/local/Adobe/Acrobat 7.0/acroread" /usr/local/bin/acroread
2007-03-24T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	tealson	then it should be in the path
2007-03-24T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig		!info acroread
