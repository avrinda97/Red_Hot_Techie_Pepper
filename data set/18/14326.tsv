2005-09-11T11:58:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	I had splashy but could not figure out how to get it to not fuck up my boot screen
2005-09-11T12:00:00.000Z	CCFIEL	ironuckles	ic.. but you have installed it in your system?
2005-09-11T12:00:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	no, i'm not using it now
2005-09-11T12:01:00.000Z	CCFIEL	ironuckles	oh..ic..do you know any alternative of splashy?
2005-09-11T12:02:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	I have seen several tutorials for editing config files to create the same type of splash screen like in fedora core, but havent tried any
2005-09-11T12:03:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	if you get something to work let me know :-)
2005-09-11T12:04:00.000Z	CCFIEL	ironuckles	ok :)
2005-09-11T12:12:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	did you install a non-ubuntu deb file recently...?
2005-09-11T12:14:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	I had the same problem. Try editing your /etc/apt/source.list file and adding all the extra repos first.
2005-09-11T12:14:00.000Z	CCFIEL	ironuckles	i think so...i just followed in the ubuntu forums how to install splashy... this is what i addeded.. deb http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/debian unstable main
2005-09-11T12:15:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	I had the same problem when i tried to remove splashy. it was a pain in the ass :-(
2005-09-11T12:15:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	avoid debian repositories like the plague.
2005-09-11T12:15:00.000Z	CCFIEL	ironuckles	ic..so...what shall i do?
2005-09-11T12:15:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	I know. :-( I had to have someone on the forums, some admin help me out.
2005-09-11T12:16:00.000Z	ironuckles	CCFIEL	I wish i had kept a record of all that i did to fix it...
