2010-05-18T11:41:00.000Z	destroth		sorry about flooding, but it seems like XP wont even try to install without installing to c:\, it just blue screens out and says there are drive errors, which I scan disk and its clean
2010-05-18T11:41:00.000Z	destroth		and to press any key to restart
2010-05-18T11:42:00.000Z	destroth		so then you have to install XP 1st, because the kernel commands it?
