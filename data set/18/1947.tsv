2010-10-07T00:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	sresu	don't use it on windows :)
2010-10-07T00:50:00.000Z	blakkheim	sresu	you could make 2 partitions on it, one for windows and one for linux that windows can't see
2010-10-07T00:50:00.000Z	sresu	blakkheim	Yeahh.. that sounds good. How to do that?
2010-10-07T00:51:00.000Z	blakkheim	sresu	any partitioning tool you like. fdisk, parted/gparted, etc

2010-10-07T00:57:00.000Z	sresu	blakkheim	What should be the partition type for Linux and Windows on USB - ext2 and ntfs?
