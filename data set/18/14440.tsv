2005-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	meriad		Sanne- or do I have to install the legacy drier..
2005-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	I use the legacy driver for my TNT2 system.
2005-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	even though it's called "legacy" doesn't mean it sucks.
2005-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	in the Ubuntu repository.
2005-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	depreciated != legacy
2005-12-12T17:49:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	depreciated means support will be removed in the future, legacy means the opososite
2005-12-12T17:51:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	yep, that's one of the packages you'll need, the other is restricted modules with legacy in the name
2005-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	yep, that and the glx legacy file are what you need.
2005-12-12T17:53:00.000Z	EdLin	meriad	then after you have them, run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" and restart X
