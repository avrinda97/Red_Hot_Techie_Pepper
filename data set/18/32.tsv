2012-11-28T00:00:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		I'm trying to remount so I can FTP what I need
2012-11-28T00:01:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		sudo: unable to open /var/lib/sudo/server/0: Read-only file system
2012-11-28T00:03:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		mount: cannot remount block device /dev/sda1 read-write, is write-protected
2012-11-28T00:03:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		System is Read-only, possibly a bad HDD, I want to remount so I can access it and FTP stuff off of it
2012-11-28T00:03:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		I've said this like 4 times now
2012-11-28T00:05:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		no*
2012-11-28T00:05:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		yeah I use sudo -i
2012-11-28T00:05:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		Response: 500 OOPS: failed to open vsftpd log file:/var/log/vsftpd.log
2012-11-28T00:06:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		Alright. I can do that, I just wanted to get important stuff off that people are depending on, I guess I'll take the complaints.
2012-11-28T00:07:00.000Z	GunfighterJ		I might just shut down the machine so it doesn't keep freaking out
2012-11-28T00:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	GunfighterJ	have you got ssh access to the box?
2012-11-28T00:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	GunfighterJ	then set up sshfs
2012-11-28T00:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	GunfighterJ	"sshfs my.hostname:/path/to/source/dir mountpoint/"
2012-11-28T00:08:00.000Z	GunfighterJ	gordonjcp	how would I set that up?
2012-11-28T00:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	GunfighterJ	boom
2012-11-28T00:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	GunfighterJ	so over your ssh connection, you now have the source dir mounted as a local filesystem
2012-11-28T00:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	GunfighterJ	ah
2012-11-28T01:34:00.000Z	GunfighterJ	gordonjcp	SSHFS worked! Thanks so much. Btw, i updated everything yesterday and it seems that's when the problems started. Could that have been a cause to this?
