2012-07-05T02:53:00.000Z	s12a		hello. I installed ubuntu 12.04 on a pc with an amd 2.6 ghz dual core processor, nvidia nforce 430 integrated graphics, 3GB ram, 64 GB samsung ssd. the interface (unity) feels kind of laggy, unresponsive. is there some tweak to make it more enjoyable to use?
2012-07-05T02:53:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	Update kernel, install preload, update & upgrade system in terminal
2012-07-05T02:54:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	already running the latest updates
2012-07-05T02:54:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	and run Bleachbit, make sure you have proprietary drivers installed too, in settings
2012-07-05T02:54:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	proprietary drivers installed as well
2012-07-05T02:55:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	you got the 3.4 kernel?
2012-07-05T02:55:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	not sure, let me check
2012-07-05T02:56:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	try switching between unity and unity 2d, as well, and if all else fails, try Gnome or Cinnamon, but with the updated kernel, you honestly should be fine, my specs are lower than yours and my 12.04 runs fine
2012-07-05T02:57:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	I'm running 3.2.0
2012-07-05T02:57:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	tried that too, no change
2012-07-05T02:58:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	it's not that it doesn't run fine. I'd say that performance is acceptable. however I previously had windows 7 on this pc and the gui felt more responsive
2012-07-05T02:58:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	go to google and type ppa kernel, scroll down to v3.4-precise/, and then download all the files that end in AMD
2012-07-05T02:58:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	I'll try that
2012-07-05T02:59:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	and the linux headers all deb
2012-07-05T02:59:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	once you have them in your downloads, go to terminal type sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb and then go to synaptic, type in linux kernel and linux headers and uninstall 3.2 kernel files, then reboot and you should be good
2012-07-05T03:00:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	I'll check that out, but does a kernel update really change speed that much?
2012-07-05T03:01:00.000Z	abimael	s12a	yes because it fixes bugs and patches and stuff like that, so yes an updated kernel can have profound affects bcuz it makes everything run
2012-07-05T03:08:00.000Z	s12a	abimael	what about your video card?
