2010-01-13T06:34:00.000Z	sileni		also from an another nautilus window if i drag a file to the desktop it doesn't show up
2010-01-13T06:35:00.000Z	sileni		no
2010-01-13T06:35:00.000Z	sileni		i have none of those
2010-01-13T06:35:00.000Z	sileni		adding launcher does nothing
2010-01-13T06:35:00.000Z	enhickman	sileni	can you right click on the desktop and a menu pop up?
2010-01-13T06:35:00.000Z	sileni		i don't think wallpaper portion is working cause right clicking doesnt bring up any menu
2010-01-13T06:35:00.000Z	sileni		nope
2010-01-13T06:36:00.000Z	sileni		yes

2010-01-13T06:37:00.000Z	sileni		is this a known bug should i start nautilus in the beggining
2010-01-13T06:37:00.000Z	sileni		with a script
2010-01-13T06:37:00.000Z	sileni		one second i think it would be better if i test it by restarting once
2010-01-13T06:37:00.000Z	sileni		be right back everyone
2010-01-13T06:37:00.000Z	enhickman	sileni	it should just work if it happens again then file a bug
