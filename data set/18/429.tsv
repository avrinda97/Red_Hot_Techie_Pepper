2012-02-21T07:34:00.000Z	wildman_		hello to anyone out there that can help me with a ubuntu network problem
2012-02-21T07:36:00.000Z	wildman_		ok i have ubuntu 11.10 on all of my systems and i can get them to talk to one another
2012-02-21T07:36:00.000Z	wildman_		i cant see them in the netwok deal when you click the network icon
2012-02-21T07:37:00.000Z	wildman_		all i want to do is be able to copy files to difrent systems and my nas boxes
2012-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	I can't see other hosts when I click on my network icon (on the menubar). I didn't know that was even a feature. I'm using 11.04.
2012-02-21T07:42:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	I'm working on 11.04, Classic Gnome interface, so can't reproduce your exact situation, but it looks like when I select Places->Network and get into the network display, all I see are Windows computers, and I suppose if I had Samba servers configured correctly on Linux boxes, I'd see those too.
2012-02-21T07:51:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	You need to give us the URL picpaste.com gave you.
2012-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	Just as a diagnostic, try running Nautilus, then click Go->Network on the menu, and see if you see the other boxes there.
2012-02-21T07:57:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	By the way, in my opinion Nautilus sucks bigtime. We're doing this only as a diagnostic test.
2012-02-21T08:00:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	Did a program come up when you ran Nautilus?
2012-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	Oh I remember how you do it in Unity. Go to the place where you look at your computer, click that, and I think that should bring you into Nutulus.
2012-02-21T08:05:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	Go to the place where it gave you the error message, click OK on the dialog box posting the error, then run the menu on the program with Desktop and Pictures and all that (I think you hover or click the menubar at the upper left, and then choose help->about, and tell me what program it says it is.
2012-02-21T08:12:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	Good! Now get to the menu on that program (which we now know is Nautilus), and select Go->Network, and see if you get the same error message.
2012-02-21T08:19:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	Install a Samba server on one of the other boxes, and see if you see it in Nautilus. Installing the Samba server should be just an Aptitude thing or an apt-get install thing or whatever Unity uses. If security isn't an issue, temporarily make your home directory accessible on the other computer.
2012-02-21T08:19:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	What confuses me is how it showed the other computers on 11.04, but not on 11.10. I'm assuming all the other computers were not changed. That's bizarre.
2012-02-21T08:36:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	I don't know. Ask yourself this question: How can I narrow it down just one more time? Think of a diagnostic test that will rule out certain components. You know the first test I'd try? Go to each of those other 11.10 computers and see if *they* can see the other computers.
2012-02-21T08:42:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	I'm currently on 192.168.100.2, and I want to see if I have connectivity to 192.168.100.96, so I do this command from the command prompt of 192.168.100.2: "ping 192.168.100.96", and don't include the quotes. Ping is your most basic network diagnostic tool. If ping doesn't work, then probably nothing will, except if they have an IMCP blocking firewall, and you don't need to know that yet.
2012-02-21T08:48:00.000Z	stevelitt	wildman_	OK good, you know you have connectivity. How do you narrow it down more? Think of a good way and tell me.
