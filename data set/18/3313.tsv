2009-10-31T09:33:00.000Z	jeffhmb		Upgrade time! How slow are the servers?
2009-10-31T09:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	dunno till you start. :)
2009-10-31T10:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	8.04 LTS, has only to do with a corporate environment, where you have t omaintain a lot of machines, or ins ome cases a server
2009-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	I realize that. I use it on my home server.
2009-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	then why are you telling people LTS is more stable?
2009-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	it's more stable in the sense that you can leave it alone once it is working for you, but still get security and critical updates.
2009-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	i mentioned that
2009-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	super great!
2009-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	but thats not stability, thats support...
2009-10-31T10:15:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	whatever, I'll let you get back to winning your argument with the other guy.
2009-10-31T10:18:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	oh lord, that's ridiculous.
2009-10-31T10:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	whatever... use LTS if you like, i could truthfully care less, but spreading lies really helps nobody.
2009-10-31T10:19:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	I use both the the LTS and the latest. It just depends on the application. This "spreading lies" stuff is just inflammatory.
2009-10-31T10:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	cconsidering i wasn't talking to you anyways, nor really referring to anything you said, you shouldn't be taking it personally.. you clearly don't have a clue how this discussion started
2009-10-31T10:21:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	didn't stop you from lumping me in with the "lies" crowd.
2009-10-31T10:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	then don't get involved int he conversation... i hadn't said a word to you till you butted in
2009-10-31T11:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jeffhmb	unfortunately at this point, its VERY unlikely grub is his only problem, he's gonna have to reinstall most likely anyways
2009-10-31T11:03:00.000Z	jeffhmb	IndyGunFreak	OK.
