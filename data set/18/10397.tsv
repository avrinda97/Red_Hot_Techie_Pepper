2006-12-14T14:31:00.000Z	frogzoo		why do people say dapper is more stable than edgy? for me, edgy fixed everything that was annoying me
2006-12-14T14:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	For me, edgy felt a lot slower than dapper. And broke a lot of things I had grown used to, like mp3 support. It drove me back to debian.
2006-12-14T14:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	kde ?
2006-12-14T14:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	Yes.
2006-12-14T14:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	Is that a sin or something now?
2006-12-14T14:33:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	the gnome ugprade to 2.16 has been nothing but positive, huge speed gains
2006-12-14T14:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	The people on #gaim were like, you're on KDE?! Oh it's not a gaim problem then, crawl back to the kinfestedhole you crawled from infidel.
2006-12-14T14:34:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	well ubuntu is principally developed for gnome
2006-12-14T14:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	I'm used to kde. It has everything and I love that. :) And the GUI is pretty -- GTK always felt a little soft around the edges for me, whatever theme I used.
2006-12-14T14:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	I was running kubuntu, which is principally developed for kde.
2006-12-14T14:34:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	touche
2006-12-16T14:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	that sux :p
2006-12-16T14:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	It's not surprising. It's proprietary.
2006-12-16T14:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	I assume it is illegal for anyone but google to distribute it.
2006-12-16T14:33:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	ah, thx for that
2006-12-17T15:37:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	linux is like 10-20% of the server space these days
2006-12-17T15:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	frogzoo	Have you noticed the kind of hardware problems people come here with? Video cards, sound cards, webcams... Servers don't have those. They have hard drives, ram, and NICs. Linux supports almost all variations of these.
2006-12-17T15:39:00.000Z	frogzoo	arrenlex	as this is a support channel, it's not surprising people bring their problems here...
