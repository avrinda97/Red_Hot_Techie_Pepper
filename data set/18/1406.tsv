2011-02-27T14:09:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	any suggestion?
2011-02-27T14:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 applications -> software center look for skype perhaps.
2011-02-27T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 could be the Skype repos are not included by default.  check the skype factoid to see where its at.
2011-02-27T15:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 i think thats a sign somthing crashed.. or you are formating a VERY VERY alrge hard drive in the background
2011-02-27T15:45:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	along with existing windows, i am installing
2011-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	itmight be formatting around 100 gb in the background, which i selected to take space for ubuntu
2011-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	 should i wait more?
2011-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 is it resizeing a windows install? that can take a LONG time.
2011-02-27T15:47:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	 i did drag for lesser space for windows, once it asked, that might be reason?
2011-02-27T15:48:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	progress bar is almost 70% done,  so if guess be justified , i think, i am 2-3 steps away from full installation?
2011-02-27T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 resizeing windows can take forever..  expecially if the hd was not scan/defragged first.
2011-02-27T15:48:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	6 -7 hrs?
2011-02-27T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 i always make it a point to even resize within windows.. or via gparted - NOT in the installer..
2011-02-27T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 depends on the sizes of the HD.. yes...
2011-02-27T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 i resized a 1tb hd the other day.. took several hrs.. it was very full however.
2011-02-27T15:50:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	 320 gb around,safe to go out for sometime(6-7 hrs!!!) ?
2011-02-27T16:10:00.000Z	javahorn_	Dr_Willis	 next it should ask me username/password during installation?
2011-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javahorn_	 i think so.. i dont memorize the installer sequence
