2007-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	emmajane	john__	we call those "door handle" questions... because just when you put your hand on the door to leave you think of another question....
2007-12-15T10:41:00.000Z	emmajane	john__	how did you install gutsy?
2007-12-15T10:41:00.000Z	emmajane	john__	upgrade? or fresh install?
2007-12-15T10:41:00.000Z	emmajane	john__	then I'm pretty sure you really shouldn't need that file.
