2011-09-15T03:03:00.000Z	step		oh but how do i choose the free space?
2011-09-15T03:04:00.000Z	step		there is 514GB of unallocated space
2011-09-15T03:04:00.000Z	step		how do i do that if im in the step 5 of 8 of installing?
2011-09-15T03:05:00.000Z	robin0800	step	choose advanced or manual
2011-09-15T03:06:00.000Z	robin0800	step	have you a picture?
2011-09-15T03:06:00.000Z	step	robin0800	then what
2011-09-15T03:08:00.000Z	robin0800	step	you need to create a new partition
2011-09-15T03:08:00.000Z	step	robin0800	how
2011-09-15T03:09:00.000Z	robin0800	step	can you right click?
2011-09-15T03:13:00.000Z	step	robin0800	it only gives the option revert
2011-09-15T03:15:00.000Z	step	robin0800	huh?
2011-09-15T03:16:00.000Z	robin0800	step	it can't be free space if it says revert
2011-09-15T03:17:00.000Z	step	robin0800	how come at the top where  the color line graph it says free space and in the partition table it says unallocated?
2011-09-15T03:17:00.000Z	robin0800	step	does the picture say its free space?
2011-09-15T03:19:00.000Z	step	robin0800	yes
2011-09-15T03:19:00.000Z	robin0800	step	that's right so if you select this it won't let you create a new partition?
2011-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	robin0800	step	is edit available?
