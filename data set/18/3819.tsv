2010-01-19T22:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	perhaps install and run 'iptraf' (or a similar util) on the relevant machine?
2010-01-19T22:19:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	so I install this on my server?
2010-01-19T22:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	sure. i always start with 'iptraf' to monitor any network stuff. i love iptraf. i'd install it on all machines if you can :-)
2010-01-19T22:21:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	is there a way to do this just monitoring 1 port in particular?
2010-01-19T22:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	let me look at iptraf's options.. hang on
2010-01-19T22:21:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	ok
2010-01-19T22:23:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	is this also good for commandline only?
2010-01-19T22:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	yes. iptraf is an ncurses command line util. i'm not sure i see a way in it to monitor just one single port. but there may be a way to do it
2010-01-19T22:25:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	ok I will take a look into it
2010-01-19T22:27:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	once installed does it run by default or do you have to start it each time?
2010-01-19T22:29:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	ubuntu
2010-01-19T22:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	??
2010-01-19T22:31:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	thought you where takling to me when you wrote in?
2010-01-19T22:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	nope. asking for help with sound problem and i'm addressing the channel in my post ;-)
2010-01-19T22:32:00.000Z	paulus68	onetinsoldier	ok no problem
2010-01-20T01:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	paulus68	you might want to try asking in a bash channel. it's probably #bash or ##bash
