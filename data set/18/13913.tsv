2006-10-15T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	check out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows (should apply even from dapper)
2006-10-15T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	I take it back -- wastrel's sounds better
2006-10-15T14:29:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	I'd say configure everything from Dapper A
2006-10-15T14:29:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	once you're set up, that is.
2007-10-30T04:26:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	you could mount your root partition with the sync option. That way you lose performance, but you get a better chance of crash-related messages arriving on disk.
2007-10-30T04:27:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	where does those extra logs go?
2007-10-30T04:27:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	just add sync to the fstab?
2007-10-30T04:28:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	no extra logs -- just everything gets physically written and can't get lost in a cache
2007-10-30T04:29:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	ah you mean may be the log message is not written to the syslog just because it was waiting to be written cache? Can it be as long as 3 minutes?
2007-10-30T04:30:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	3 minutes does sound long, but I would still give it a go.
2007-10-30T04:30:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	i tried system request thingies but those did not help either in times of lockup :(
2007-10-30T04:30:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	keep trying ;)
2008-06-21T04:17:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	Ubuntu may use more energy than Windows because it tends to wake up the CPU from power saving states more frequently. You can trace such behaviour with powertop
2008-06-21T04:18:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	can i prevent it from doing so when on battery power?
2008-06-21T04:18:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	try powertop
2008-06-21T04:19:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	installed already, checking it now thanks
2008-06-21T04:24:00.000Z	MrKeuner	soundray	I clicked A R and W will those be permanent or do I have to do it everytime i need low energy consumption?
2008-06-21T04:25:00.000Z	soundray	MrKeuner	I don't know, I haven't tried it myself yet
