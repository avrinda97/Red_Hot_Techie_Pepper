2009-07-02T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	delete the \'s and join the lines?
2009-07-02T18:42:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	tried that. it doesnt work :S
2009-07-02T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	you didn't do it correctly then.  Pastebin
2009-07-02T18:43:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	ok one second
2009-07-02T18:44:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	http://debian.pastebin.com/m2642967a
2009-07-02T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	how does that show me that it doesn't work?
2009-07-02T18:45:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	thought you wanted to see the command i used, one moment.
2009-07-02T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	anyway, you didn't copy it right.  Look at line 4
2009-07-02T18:45:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	that extra "-"?
2009-07-02T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	s/extra//
2009-07-02T18:47:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	http://debian.pastebin.com/m234e6f4d correct now?
2009-07-02T18:47:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	looks ok to me
2009-07-02T18:47:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	I'll test it now
2009-07-02T18:48:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	may I ask how that - affects the command? it seems like its passing an argument like -l or -v but without the character? wtf
2009-07-02T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	tel0s	-O - tells wget to send the output to stdout
2009-07-02T18:49:00.000Z	tel0s	jrib	ah ok, many thanks.
