2009-12-14T01:20:00.000Z	wvd		So I got a problem.. where I'm 10 hours busy with now. I got troubles configuring my gigaset usb adapter 108. With ndiswrapper -l it tells me that the adapter is installed, but the interface wlan0 isn't here... Anyone has ideas?
2009-12-14T01:21:00.000Z	wvd		anyway, i'll figure out
2009-12-14T01:22:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	can you "hard" connect while t/s the wireless card?
2009-12-14T01:24:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	Is it an Atheros chipset? I just dealt with that a couple of days ago...
2009-12-14T01:24:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	idk.. it's a gigaset usb adapter
2009-12-14T01:25:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	Hrmmm... Thinking about what I did...
2009-12-14T01:26:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	have you checked dmesg?
2009-12-14T01:26:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	Yes, it shows nothing about my ndiswrapper I think.
2009-12-14T01:27:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	What should it show?
2009-12-14T01:27:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	checking my box for you... one sec...
2009-12-14T01:29:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	dmesg | grep "itk"
2009-12-14T01:29:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	should see at least SOMETHING in there...
2009-12-14T01:30:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	I would have to reboot for that.. but could you paste what's there?
2009-12-14T01:30:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	then I'll check that tommorow
2009-12-14T01:31:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	for example, [   21.640429] iwl3945: Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection driver for Linux, 1.2.26ks - tells me that the hardware was successfully detected...
2009-12-14T01:31:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	ndiswrapper -l doesn't tell me hardware detected, it tells me 'Vehice installed'.
2009-12-14T01:32:00.000Z	wvd	FromTheRedCarpet	I'm going to sleep now.. going to try it tommorow again, thanks tho
2009-12-14T01:32:00.000Z	FromTheRedCarpet	wvd	good luck
