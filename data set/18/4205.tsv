2009-07-17T20:19:00.000Z	grawity	navatwo	Just "compiz" or "metacity".
2009-07-17T20:19:00.000Z	grawity	navatwo	If that doesn't work, try with --replace
2009-07-17T20:20:00.000Z	grawity	navatwo	...are you doing it from a virtual console?
2009-07-17T20:21:00.000Z	grawity	navatwo	You need to run the WM from the same X session.
2009-07-17T20:21:00.000Z	grawity	navatwo	You said you still have a terminal open there
