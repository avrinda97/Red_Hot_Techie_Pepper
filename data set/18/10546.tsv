2006-12-07T07:05:00.000Z	mahdi		seems like the downloaded firefox doesnt connect to any sites (with and without linux32)... what could b wrong?
2006-12-07T07:05:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	You have internet connection working, my guess is a setting in the /cofig? of that Firfox
2006-12-07T07:05:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	yep. If i run x86_64 firefox from ubuntu repos with works fine
2006-12-07T07:07:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	and don't think it is about firefox.cfg because i copied the file from the working version and it still doesn't work
2006-12-07T07:08:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	I am newb to Debian/Linux, but that seems like a common program error of no comm or is a missing link in some config that permits Firefox to access.
2006-12-07T07:08:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	Did you run the sys file checker?
2006-12-07T07:09:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	yep. The weird thing is that it used to work fine... the feisty upgrade must have broken it
2006-12-07T07:09:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	how do i do that?
2006-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	Revert, is an option at Boot, or use the backup that I hope you made...
2006-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	ah, yep. I used it but has nothing to do
2006-12-07T07:11:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	and i don't intend to use the backup. Feisty seems to have fixed more stuff than it broke =P
2006-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	I have no idea what the command/sudo is for sys file check, but I saw it on the Debian Site, and a few Linux sites.
2006-12-07T07:13:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	i don't think it is about it anyway... the command is fsck. I only checks for integrity and the system is fine. It's a matter of some firefox settings
2006-12-07T07:13:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	just don't know where to look yet
2006-12-07T07:15:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	I may have it bkmarked, am looking now
2006-12-07T07:17:00.000Z	VigoFusion	mahdi	This is a start,,it isnt exact, but is a good source, http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/Linux-Dictionary.html
2006-12-07T07:18:00.000Z	mahdi		ubuntu's firefox seems to detect wether the system is 64 or 32bits... any chance that firefox64 will use 32bits plugins if ran with linux32?
2006-12-07T07:18:00.000Z	mahdi	VigoFusion	:) tkz
