2011-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	good_intentions		I guess I can search around for a while try to get sasc-ng workig
2011-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	good_intentions		So is there deffo no way to install windows to the HD within linux
2011-01-20T04:21:00.000Z	good_intentions		Surely I could install grub?
2011-01-20T04:21:00.000Z	good_intentions		*re
2011-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	good_intentions		but I can then reinstall grub
2011-01-20T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	it's not that bad, you just follow the wiki, boot a live cd, and run a command, then reboot
2011-01-20T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	I think grub2 can boot isos now. Someone mentioned it here once
2011-01-20T04:26:00.000Z	good_intentions	jrib	really! that would be the perfect solution
2011-01-20T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	I don't remember if you need to reboot and keep the cd in the drive.  This method definitely wouldn't work then
2011-01-20T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	regarding installing windowms
2011-01-20T04:28:00.000Z	good_intentions	jrib	Ah thats true the disc would need to be in on reboot
2011-01-20T04:29:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	http://geekdeck.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/booting-iso-images-with-grub2-among-other-things/ apparently it won't work
2011-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	good_intentions	jrib	Ah well I shall seek out more solutions
2011-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	maybe usb install?  Ask ##windows if that is a possibility
2011-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	though why can't you boot from your dvd drive again?
2011-01-20T04:32:00.000Z	good_intentions	jrib	Ive lost my win7 disk, lucky I have backed it up onto iso and burning fails for some reason
2011-01-20T04:33:00.000Z	jrib	good_intentions	burn at a friends
2011-01-20T04:33:00.000Z	good_intentions	jrib	thats plan B but IM hoping to install today
