2008-04-27T01:28:00.000Z	xubean		anybody know how to clear up the "/" folder?
2008-04-27T01:29:00.000Z	xubean		i think i'm not being able to upgrade, because of that
2008-04-27T01:29:00.000Z	xubean		I want to upgrade to hardy,
2008-04-27T01:30:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: yeah, I did clear up space in home, it's got 20 gigs left
2008-04-27T01:31:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: exactly, that's why I don't understand why i can't upgrade
2008-04-27T01:31:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: yes
2008-04-27T01:32:00.000Z	xubean		zelta, zvacet: the actual error I'm getting is "Authentication failed
2008-04-27T01:32:00.000Z	xubean		Authenticating the upgrade failed. There may be a problem with the network or with the server. " any ideas?
2008-04-27T01:33:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: what else could it be? I tried changing the server too...
2008-04-27T01:35:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: they are still getting hammored? it's been a lil more than two days now! I downloaded the iso, but left it at work... I desperately wanted to upgrade to hardy this weekend...
2008-04-27T01:35:00.000Z	Zelta	xubean	It came out on the 25th, today is the 26th
2008-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	xubean	emorris	Thanks for taking a look at that ...
2008-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: didn't it come out on the 24th?! i think it did... anyways... is there any other way/
2008-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	xubean		is that error I'm getting because of a server, if it is then, I can keep trying different servers! :)
2008-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	Zelta	xubean	how are you upgrading?  through the upgrade manager?
2008-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: yes...
2008-04-27T01:37:00.000Z	xubean		zelta: actually the weird thing is, ubuntu doesn't even show that I need an upgrade right now, i have to do a force upgrade "gksu update-manager -d"
2008-04-27T01:37:00.000Z	Zelta	xubean	Don't do that
