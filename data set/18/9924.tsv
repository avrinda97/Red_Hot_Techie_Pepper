2011-02-24T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		he was asking about remnote access specifically.
2011-02-24T20:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		teamviuewer has its own web site last i checked. Not in any repos.
2011-02-24T20:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		but there may be ppa's
2011-02-24T20:42:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	LogMeIn is for suckers who shell $69.95 per computer just to VNC their babies.
2011-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	redbox	 clarify what you are doing exactly.
2011-02-27T16:34:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	I crafted a script that pulls in 3 files from different servers and combine them into one /etc/hosts. That does not work. I'm able to access ridiculous ads and malware websites such as digg. :(
2011-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	redbox	 so you are using some ad-blocking type of complex hosts file  to blacklist sites.
2011-02-27T16:36:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	For instance, I myself don't use facebook and I read an article about how it is tracking you even although you're not a member. With cookies. So I do have a list of *.facebook.com to curb it. Facebook.com should take me to 127.0.0.1
2011-02-27T16:36:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	Right. Ads, Malware, Dangerous / Fake Domain Names, Stupid Websites.
2011-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	Is there a limit on /etc/hosts? It's a whooping 3.1 MB
2011-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	redbox	 no idea. i havent used that old blacklist-ad site via hosts method in years
2011-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	redbox	 as a test, try specific blocks with a smaller file.. and build up.
2011-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	redbox	 i never notice any ads... :)
2011-02-27T16:58:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	It did the trick. Weird. #_#
2011-02-27T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	redbox	 what did? i forget...
2011-02-27T16:58:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	Rebooting the machine. /etc/hosts.
2011-02-27T16:59:00.000Z	redbox	Dr_Willis	openbox + tint2 + chromium. That's it. :)
