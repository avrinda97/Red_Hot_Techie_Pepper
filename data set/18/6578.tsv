2008-04-28T20:05:00.000Z	kilpat		I'm having trouble with my contrast on Hardy.  Can anyone help?
2008-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	kilpat		My contrast changes by itself.  If I don't move the mouse for about a minute and then move it, the contrast goes up.  Also, if I have the contrast all the way down and then close my screen (laptop) and then open it, the contrast is all the way up again.  How can I fix this?
2008-04-28T20:08:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	Check the power settings.  System -> Preferences -> Power Management
2008-04-28T20:08:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	The checkbox "dim display when idle" can do this.
2008-04-28T20:10:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	Reboot the computer.  Also disable any power management in the BIOS setup program if you know how.
2008-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	You need to use the any-any patch to run VMware on Hardy.
2008-04-28T20:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	You should prefix your lines with dajhorn: so I get a beep when you talk.
2008-04-28T20:13:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	Ok, sorry about that
2008-04-28T20:14:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	Np.  Which VMware release are you running?
2008-04-28T20:14:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	well i couldn't get it working with 6.0.0 so I got 6.0.3 and I finally got it working but I've been having that ctrl problem.
2008-04-28T20:15:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	6.0.2*
2008-04-28T20:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	I'm running VMware Workstation 6.0.2 on Hardy without problems, but 32-bit.  I dunno whether a 64-bit host is stable.
2008-04-28T20:16:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	I have 32-bit
2008-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	I've just noticed in general after upgrading to Hardy I've been experience problems...besides what I've said I've also had my pc freeze, and firefox 3 beta 5 seems to crash a lot.
2008-04-28T20:18:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	Perhaps you have another problem.  Try running the memtest+ diagnostic from the GRUB prompt.
2008-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	how do i do that
2008-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	dajhorn	kilpat	Reboot the computer and look for the "GRUB... Push ESC" prompt.  One of the items will be Memtest.
2008-04-28T20:21:00.000Z	kilpat	dajhorn	Ok I'll do that
