2008-02-08T19:04:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	of course...actually I need your help
2008-02-08T19:05:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	with video card...It's time to make an upgrade and I want to buy a new computer
2008-02-08T19:05:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	can you give me some tips of a nice video card?
2008-02-08T19:06:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	as far as I know, ppl say that nvidia card works better on windows instead of linux...is that true? I'm looking for a headache-free video card...if possible :P
2008-02-08T19:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rodolfo	I use both nvidia and intel, none are bleeding edge and both types work well.  I would avoid the 8000 series of the nvidia.  #ubuntu-offtopic is a good place to ask that as it leads to lots of opinions and discussions.
2008-02-08T19:08:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	why not?
2008-02-08T19:08:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	I see...just one more thing: why are you running away from nv's 8xxx?
2008-02-08T19:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rodolfo	There was an issue with drivers awhile back.  not sure if it got straightened out and never got around to trying one out
2008-02-08T19:10:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	Is there any issue with nv's GF7300/7300LE that you've heard of?
2008-02-08T19:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rodolfo	Not that I am aware of
2008-02-08T19:11:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Jack_Sparrow	thanks man...and go get some sleep, sometimes... :P
2008-02-08T19:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rodolfo	goodnight
