2007-08-24T11:32:00.000Z	Baubal		Greetings, was hoping someone here could help me... I installed kubuntu 7.04 a month ago. CDs and usb flash drives automounted on the desktop fine. Now, they stopped automounting. I am not quite sure what caused this - I am thinking an apt-get update, upgrade or something. Any idea on how to fix? I read on the forums that a bunch of users have this same issue
2007-08-24T11:33:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	update again and it should be ok
2007-08-24T11:35:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	tried doing several updates, and still no go.  Not sure if this is an OS or display manager thing too
2007-08-24T11:38:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	Did you uninstall any of these: dbus, hal, or maybe hotplug .. did you compile your own kernel without Inotify support ?
2007-08-24T11:39:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	nay, I didnt uninstall any of those, nor did not compile my own kernal
2007-08-24T11:40:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	Well, dbus isnt getting the inotifies it should and so hal/pmount doesnt either. Check /var/log/messages
2007-08-24T11:40:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	kk will do
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	desktop not compiled with inotify or pmount support (I have that problem myself on my home built dist...)
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	Solve it and tell me how you did it plz :=)
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	lol
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	Its really annoying :)
2007-08-24T11:50:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	Compiling and automating the compile of the whole system was no problem but this little thing is driving me crazy :P
2007-08-24T11:50:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	do you know if dapper is affected by this too? I may need to downgrade to get that automount thing working.  (This is for a computer to be used by a good amount of non-computer skilled people)
2007-08-24T11:51:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	ugh.. ya.  these are the things that can drive one batty!  A seemingly minor thing that turns out to be anything but lol
2007-08-24T11:51:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	maybe its the latest HAL/pmount thats causing the issues ?
2007-08-24T11:52:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	compiling gnome from scratch is also a pain (i hate xml too) ..
2007-08-24T11:52:00.000Z	ginsitr	Baubal	I know the apps almost inside out.. can pin that down though
2007-08-24T11:53:00.000Z	Baubal	ginsitr	last time I complied gnome from scratch was about 10 years ago.. and I vowed never to do so again if I didnt have to ... talk about painful!
