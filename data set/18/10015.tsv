2007-03-19T11:08:00.000Z	lnx^		hey
2007-03-19T11:09:00.000Z	lnx^		is there some little fancy program that i could set to show reminders?
2007-03-19T11:09:00.000Z	lnx^		preferably somehow integrated with gnome/ubuntu
2007-03-19T11:10:00.000Z	lnx^		e.g. i could set it to show a reminder up next to the clock in the panel whenever i'm supposed to take backups
2007-03-19T11:12:00.000Z	mage___	lnx^	thanks for reminding me of my question
2007-03-19T11:12:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	no problem for nothing
2007-03-19T11:12:00.000Z	mage___	lnx^	also, try anacron
2007-03-19T11:13:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	oh gee! i forgot about it completely..
2007-03-19T11:13:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	even though there's still a problem, i might not be at home when my laptop tries to take backups
2007-03-19T11:14:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	but i suppose i can make a check for that with simple bash
2007-03-19T11:15:00.000Z	mage___	lnx^	depending on how you want to check, could be simple or complicated ;)
2007-03-19T11:15:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	so how exactly does anacron work? does it run the command whenever i power up my laptop or?
2007-03-19T11:16:00.000Z	mage___	lnx^	I uh, dont know exactly, but it has concepts like daily and weekly
2007-03-19T11:17:00.000Z	mage___	lnx^	with cron you're specifying exact times for operations to occur
2007-03-19T11:17:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	yeah, got that. i suppose i'll just do some research on my own, but thanks a lot :)
2007-03-19T11:19:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	oh yeah and i forgot there's another problem, my backup partition is encrypted behind a pw which i need to enter each time i want to make a backup
2007-03-19T11:19:00.000Z	mage___	lnx^	so you have it encrypted on the server but not the laptop?
2007-03-19T11:21:00.000Z	lnx^	mage___	yeah, i use encfs over nfs. the backups are encrypted, and to use that encrypted fs i need to enter a pw
