2004-12-15T11:15:00.000Z	SuperQ		hey.. anyone know how to adjust hotplug to fix a USB setting?
2004-12-15T11:17:00.000Z	SuperQ		ubuntu is the only distro that detects my external USB burner as a USB/IDE bridge
2004-12-15T11:17:00.000Z	SuperQ		everything else detects the drive attached to the USB/IDE bridge
2004-12-15T11:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	SuperQ	it is a USB/IDE bridge if its an external hardisk
2004-12-15T11:18:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	it's a USB/IDE box with a Lite-On DVD+-RW drive
2004-12-15T11:18:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	fedora/gentoo detect it as a LITE-ON, but ubuntu's hotplug config thinks it's a USB/IDE bridge
2004-12-15T11:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	any ideas
2004-12-15T11:22:00.000Z	linux_galore	SuperQ	sure ubuntu hasnt mounted the device already
2004-12-15T11:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	no.. it's a CD Burner, with no disks in it
2004-12-15T11:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	i don't know enough about hotplug to fix it
2004-12-15T11:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	and i'm too drunk to read the docs right now
2004-12-15T11:23:00.000Z	linux_galore	SuperQ	so have you tried puting a CD/DVD in the device and seeing if ubuntu mounts it
2004-12-15T11:24:00.000Z	linux_galore	SuperQ	  dmesg -c before you put the cd in then type  dmesg  after you have put a cd in the drive
2004-12-15T11:24:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	well.. since it doesn't detect it as a CD drive
2004-12-15T11:24:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	i won't be able to burn disks
2004-12-15T11:24:00.000Z	linux_galore	SuperQ	how do you know...ubuntu might not do anything unless there is media there
2004-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	SuperQ	linux_galore	right.. but if it's blank media
2004-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	SuperQ	should still mount
