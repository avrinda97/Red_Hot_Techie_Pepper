2007-02-27T17:35:00.000Z	NkZ		My Issue: My Ubuntu has been acting strange these days: It randomly hangs and Reboots. I did a hardware check (Thought it was the RAM) and it was fine. Ran MemTest (Took like a LOT he he) and it was fine. Ran the Ubuntu Kernel with the "noacpi" exception and it still was hanging so now I am using the previous kernel (Something -10 besides something -11): If this one hangs on too, what else can I do? (Hope I am not Spamming) (Anyone can help? :-P) (Believe
2007-02-27T17:35:00.000Z	NkZ		me I've tried a lot of things now. :-P)
2007-02-27T17:37:00.000Z	NkZ		Help? anyone? Any Thoughts?
2007-02-27T17:38:00.000Z	NkZ		Orionrobots: Oh. :-) Thanks. :-) Well, It's not giving any issues so far, It could be the new kernel, But I will shut up I don't wanna screw it up talking. :-)
2007-02-27T17:38:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	I see crashed from time to time, which is actually why I cam eon tonight - sorry a very odd, quite visual hang.
2007-02-27T17:40:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	- It looks like I had memory corruption to a frame buffer or something similar. The screen filled up with blobs and lines - however, they were all rounded - which confused me. I am used to it normally being hard edged?
2007-02-27T17:41:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	Absolutely not..
2007-02-27T17:41:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	Humour rebooted...
2007-02-27T17:45:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	Yes. But I am booting the old kernel - the new one remains off until I can be bothered to rejig the nvidia drivers locally.
2007-02-27T17:45:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	I have been tinkering with UML (User Mode Linux - not fluffy diagrams) a lot - which may have had something to do with it..
2007-02-27T17:46:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	My best guess is #gnome..
2007-02-27T17:46:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	An interesting kernel mess up is to create a VM with more memory than the physical box has..
2007-02-27T17:48:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	Well the HOST kernel issues a message to all terms "Oops"..
2007-02-27T17:48:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	And ps, top stopped working.
2007-02-27T17:49:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	And trying to run them, or kill just hung the term they were run in.
2007-02-27T17:49:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	However, things already running, like firefox, and GAIM, just seemed to carry on just fine.
2007-02-27T17:50:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	No that Vm thing was entirely my fault - nothing to do with the .11 kernel.
2007-02-27T17:51:00.000Z	orionrobots	NkZ	Making a Vm with 2Gb on a 1Gb box is a bad plan.. But an interesting experiment none the less.
