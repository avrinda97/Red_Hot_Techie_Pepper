2007-04-12T13:47:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	it tells the shell that it should execute the contents like a command
2007-04-12T13:47:00.000Z	gesus	scottam	robokop : ok so i did: mkdir `cat test.txt -- but it didn't create any dirs, instead in the prompt it just presents me with a new line: >
2007-04-12T13:48:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	you forgot the trailing `
2007-04-12T14:03:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	yes, first do a find and replace on the file to chance every instance of " " to "\ "
2007-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	or put quotes around the entire line, but that's harder
2007-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	gesus	scottam	that "\ " is meant to have a space after the \ , yes?
2007-04-12T14:06:00.000Z	gesus	scottam	i did replace all on " " and replaced with "\ " but when i ran that command it still created a directory for each word in the line..

2007-04-12T14:12:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	i know.....i'm trying to make it work here
2007-04-12T14:15:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	ok, i think i got it
2007-04-12T14:17:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	add #!/bin/bash to the top, then add the \s before every space, then add "mkdir " to the beginning of every line, make the file executable, and run it
2007-04-12T14:17:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	i'd back up the file first
2007-04-12T14:18:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	or, IIRC, "perl -p -i.bak -e 's/$/mkdir /g' file.txt" will add the stuff to the beginning
2007-04-12T14:19:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	no, that regex doesn't work.....$ is end of line....
2007-04-12T14:22:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	in vim: %s/^/mkdir /
2007-04-12T14:24:00.000Z	scottam	gesus	how's it coming?
