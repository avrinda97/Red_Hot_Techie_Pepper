2008-07-02T21:47:00.000Z	Pyramide		well...no matter what combination of update-grub and grub-install I use, the bootmenu just does not change
2008-07-02T21:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	do you have mutiple linux partitions ?
2008-07-02T21:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	probably grub is pointing to the old partition
2008-07-02T21:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	he data is still there, regardless if you can boot from it or not
2008-07-02T21:51:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	how do I force grub to use my new partition?
2008-07-02T21:51:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	I am reading the grub help :P
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	there is "## default grub root device
2008-07-02T21:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	to be honest I can't figure where does grub get the menu.lst location from
2008-07-02T21:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	have you grub-install into the hard disk device ? to overwrite the MBR  ?
2008-07-02T21:55:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	well I could delete the old partition so it will definitely not be able to get the obsolete configuration from there...but I fear that I won't be able to boot at all then
2008-07-02T21:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	yes, that would not be a good option
2008-07-02T21:55:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	I did sudo update-grub, sudo grub-install /dev/sda and sudo grub-install /dev/sdb
2008-07-02T21:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	ok
2008-07-02T21:57:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	it doesn't seem different from what you did but: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=563991
2008-07-02T22:05:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	now I tried to rename the menu.lst and let update-grub generate a new one, but except some comments and my windows partition there is no difference between the two files
2008-07-02T23:04:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	you will never guess what the real problem was
2008-07-02T23:05:00.000Z	joaopinto	Pyramide	editing the wrong file ? :P
2008-07-02T23:08:00.000Z	Pyramide	joaopinto	thanks for your help anyway
