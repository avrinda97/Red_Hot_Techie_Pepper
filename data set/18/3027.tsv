2011-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	did you try to install the video driver via the GUI?
2011-11-09T12:23:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	I did briefly, the instructions told me to run an nvidia command as root and reboot, upon reboot the xserver did not load
2011-11-09T12:31:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	do you know the model # of your chipset?
2011-11-09T12:31:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	lspci | grep vga
2011-11-09T12:32:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	that command returns nothing
2011-11-09T12:34:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	http://pastebin.ubntu.com/732815/
2011-11-09T12:36:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	um.... ubntu?
2011-11-09T12:36:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	sorry, re-typing on my laptop so I can't exactly copy/paste here
2011-11-09T12:37:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	and this laptop is notorious for keystrokes just disappearing
2011-11-09T12:37:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	 nVidia Corporation GT218 [GeForce 310M]
2011-11-09T12:40:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	might have some issues with that chipset
2011-11-09T12:42:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	no, I have no clue how to obtain that version and install it
2011-11-09T12:43:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	do you have any ideas where that information can be found?
2011-11-09T12:44:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/256.44/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-256.44.run
2011-11-09T12:44:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	type that on command line
2011-11-09T12:45:00.000Z	Richie086	stochastic	wget http://goo.gl/avAlW
2011-11-09T12:46:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	before I run that command I'm trying the GUI Aditional Drivers
2011-11-09T12:51:00.000Z	stochastic	Richie086	so the 'post-release updates' option in the GUI did install (the release version did not) but upon reboot I A) have better resolution B) have no window borders in xfce (ubiquity is fine though)
