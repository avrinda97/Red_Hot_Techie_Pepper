2010-12-28T22:15:00.000Z	_joey		I need to get a source for driver, patch this source, compile and install the driver
2010-12-28T22:15:00.000Z	_joey		what is the easiest way to do this
2010-12-28T22:16:00.000Z	_joey		i mean the easiest way to install the module once iti is compiled
2010-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	I use that ath5k, works for me
2010-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	what will your patch at to ath5k?
2010-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	add to ath5k
2010-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	_joey	sacarlson	there is patch which I know how to add. What i am not sure is how to insert the newly built module over the old one
2010-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	_joey	sacarlson	entire kernel?
2010-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	ya I think that's where that code is also
2010-12-28T22:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	well I did comile the rt73 wifi drivers with just the headers but I don't think I can compile the ones I have now on the newist kernels
2010-12-28T22:22:00.000Z	_joey	sacarlson	what packages are need to be installed to compile module from source?
2010-12-28T22:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	when you pull a git time line you get the whole working set
2010-12-28T22:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	that about it maybe cursurs or something or is that for the kernel build?
2010-12-28T22:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	oh maybe the wpa-suplicant package
2010-12-28T22:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	maybe they have a dev file for wpa-suplicant?
2010-12-28T22:27:00.000Z	_joey	sacarlson	that's a software for encryption
2010-12-28T22:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	ya I guess that's totaly outside the driver now?
2010-12-28T22:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	_joey	well sometime when I try to compile then I find out what's missing,  hit the botton and lets find out
