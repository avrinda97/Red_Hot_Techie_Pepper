2005-04-01T10:51:00.000Z	kevman		Hello, I just installed Ubuntu, and I cannot get it to communicate on my network
2005-04-01T10:52:00.000Z	kevman		Ifconfig reports the eth0 as UP, and my DNS servers are reported, but I have no Internet
2005-04-01T10:52:00.000Z	kevman		Any ideas?
2005-04-01T10:54:00.000Z	kevman		No help?
2005-04-01T10:54:00.000Z	nis	kevman	what is eth0 connected to?
2005-04-01T10:54:00.000Z	kevman	nis	what do you mean? Its connected to the school system
2005-04-01T10:55:00.000Z	nis	kevman	/sbin/ifconfig should tell u your IP adrs.
2005-04-01T10:56:00.000Z	kevman	nis	Its being reported in base16, which is unusual.
2005-04-01T10:56:00.000Z	nis	kevman	should be a dotted quad, unless you're talking about the MAC adrs.
2005-04-01T10:57:00.000Z	kevman	nis	Its not.
2005-04-01T10:58:00.000Z	nis	kevman	I've never seen that. eth0 should have 'inet addr:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' as 2nd line.
2005-04-01T10:59:00.000Z	nis	kevman	oh, maybe that's ipv6!  I never seen that.  No clue.
2005-04-01T11:00:00.000Z	nis	kevman	first I'd look in the man page for ifconfig to see if you can get that reported normally etc.
2005-04-01T11:09:00.000Z	nis	kevman	This isn't quite related, but it may put you onto the right idea:  cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2005-04-01T11:12:00.000Z	nis	kevman	I'd trace the entire boot procedure, starting with /etc/inittab
2005-04-01T11:14:00.000Z	kevman	nis	I'd abandon Linux first.
2005-04-01T11:38:00.000Z	nis	kevman	Linux wants a bit of massaging.
2005-04-01T11:39:00.000Z	nis	kevman	no one knows, but we all do it.
