2009-07-24T06:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor		is anybody here familiar with ubuntu's firewall? I can't seem to ping my machine properly :(
2009-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	i'm new to ubuntu, but I've played with ufw (sorry to repeat myself, mistyped your name)
2009-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	I'm using iptables and have used the same rules on 2 machines, however the problem only persists on the one running netbook remix, not the one running server edition (they are both 9.04)
2009-07-24T06:58:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	is network manager running on the the netbook?
2009-07-24T06:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	yes
2009-07-24T06:59:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	If i had to guess (which I'm doing), i would disable it and setup networking manually... network manager already screwed me today, so i'm prejudice... ;D
2009-07-24T07:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	I would, but until the machine is ready for production, it needs to be used on many wireless networks (making command line setup quite annoying)
2009-07-24T07:01:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	my idea was to use that method for testing if network manager is the problem.. If it is, there's probably a way to write a solution in a shell script.
2009-07-24T07:01:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	or patch network manager if you have a coder handy.
2009-07-24T07:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	what did you use instead of network manager (cli, wicd, etc)?
2009-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	what connection manager do you use?
2009-07-24T07:08:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	I read this http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex.html
2009-07-24T07:09:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	haven't tested it yet though... so beware if you don't have physical access
2009-07-24T07:10:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	unfortunately all my connections so far are wireless :( I guess I'll have to try out wicd. I used to use it, but didn't like the interface. But if it *works* then that's what I'll use
2009-07-24T07:11:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	should probably confirm that the problem is actually with network manager before abandoning it.
2009-07-24T07:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	I still have to check if the pinging problem persists
2009-07-24T07:37:00.000Z	renic	DarwinSurvivor	hope it clears up the problem
2009-07-24T07:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	renic	bwahaha, IT WORKS! thank you very very much. I spent a half-hour on the #iptables channel debugging my firewall yesterday, guess it was just NetworkManager being stupid!
