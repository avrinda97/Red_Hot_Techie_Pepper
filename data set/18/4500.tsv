2012-10-04T23:04:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	if you have any open ports then it's possible (ubuntu should not have any open by default)
2012-10-04T23:08:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	you need to do that in your irc client. if you can't - get a better one
2012-10-04T23:09:00.000Z	osama	crazydip	how do I get my colour red like yours
2012-10-04T23:10:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	uhh... your client controls colors :) i have no idea what color's you see and it's definitely not what i see
2012-10-04T23:12:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	you wanted to install StarCraft 2 right? try here: http://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-661-Starcraft_II_Wings_of_Liberty.html

2012-10-04T23:22:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	learn how linux works, learn how servers work, learn to program, learn about security, whatever fancies you
2012-10-04T23:23:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	and of course web developement, whether basic website design to advanced stuff all done on linux (unless you're wacky) - most of the web runs on linux so that's a start and it's all free to use and to modify
2012-10-04T23:24:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	sure
2012-10-04T23:26:00.000Z	crazydip	osama	ubuntu has an awesome server guide
