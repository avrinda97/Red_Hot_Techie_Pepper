2006-01-26T09:50:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	I would _never_ resize on _any_ system without a backup, regardless of what anyone might tell you.  Plus, t4 is telling you he has direct experience.
2006-01-26T09:51:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	Right... And the only things I need are already backed up (I do regular backups). BUT I cannot figure out how to do it in the first place.
2006-01-26T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	ok, you would be surprised how many people do a resize and lose important data.
2006-01-26T09:52:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	I didn't see the specifics of your system, it's power pc?
2006-01-26T09:52:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	Yes... 15" iMac G4 800MHz 512MB
2006-01-26T09:52:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	I've never done a resize on those.
2006-01-26T09:53:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	OK... It's just strange because (#1 I'm not stupid) many people told me that the PPC Ubuntu had resizing as an install option... and I can't for the life of me find it.
2006-01-26T09:54:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	I've never seen resizing as an install option with any version.
2006-01-26T09:54:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	as of now, me neither. :/
2006-01-26T09:54:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	I've seen many people resize, but not during install.
2006-01-26T09:54:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	so use whatever tool you want to resize with.  use a rescue cd or boot the ubuntu install cd in rescue mode
2006-01-26T09:55:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	How would I do that? (rescue mode from ubuntu cd)... and does it include parted?
2006-01-26T09:55:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	I don't know whether parted is there or not, sorry.  If you hit F1 at the boot prompt, it tells you how to get into rescue mode.
2006-01-26T09:56:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	I don't think the OS X bootstrap has the option to hit F1
2006-01-26T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	possible, I haven't tried it recently.
2006-01-26T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	in fact, I don't think I've tried the mac with ubuntu at all.
2006-01-26T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	CodyDH	so google or find somebody smarter than I am about ubuntu and ppc.  :)
2006-01-26T09:58:00.000Z	CodyDH	sethk	OK... thank you for your help!
