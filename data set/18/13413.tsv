2006-04-29T14:46:00.000Z	luke_		whenever I attempt to execute firefox 1.5.2 I get this error http://pastebin.com/678447
2006-04-29T14:46:00.000Z	luke_		does anyone know how Ive screwed up?
2006-04-29T14:47:00.000Z	luke_		yes
2006-04-29T14:47:00.000Z	luke_		but it still doesnt start, even from Gnome
2006-04-29T14:47:00.000Z	luke_		yes
2006-04-29T14:47:00.000Z	luke_		i did what it said
2006-04-29T14:48:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	that's harmless
2006-04-29T14:48:00.000Z	luke_	sethk	it doesnt run however
2006-04-29T14:49:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	ok, but those messages aren't the reason
2006-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	it's the messages about not finding shared object file that are killing it
2006-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	luke_	sethk	can I fix that?
2006-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	looks like you don't have pango installed
2006-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	install what's missing
2006-04-29T14:54:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	use synaptic and try search and see if it finds stuff for pango
2006-04-29T14:55:00.000Z	luke_	sethk	cant find it in synaptic
2006-04-29T14:55:00.000Z	luke_	sethk	unless you mean libpango
2006-04-29T14:55:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	libpango it is
2006-04-29T14:56:00.000Z	sethk	luke_	whenever you see a message about not finding a shared object, it's talking about a library
