2009-08-23T04:49:00.000Z	root5_		the most powerfull card is the usb awus036h
2009-08-23T04:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	300mW+ TX rate
2009-08-23T04:53:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	what are you trying to say ?
2009-08-23T04:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	trying to correct you, many people get confused over its true capabilities :p
2009-08-23T04:54:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	well give me the link
2009-08-23T04:57:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=735762&fcc_id=%27UQ2AWUS036H%27
2009-08-23T04:58:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	there's a list of pdf files
2009-08-23T04:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	the answer is within that page
2009-08-23T04:59:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	i wont enable JS, I don't see any relevant information on it as I see it, but if the awus036h is "just" a 300mW card, there must be another reference over the web
2009-08-23T05:00:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	i am reading that you have to iwpriv wlan0 highpower 1 in order to get the  max of the card
2009-08-23T05:01:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	I highly doubt you can achieve 500mW, its not really legal and again, its only a maximum transmit level, doesn't mean that it can receive at the same level as well
2009-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	well, i'm investigating, i think your right, it's not 500mW, but you can push the card to that power level, but it seems to be dangerous for the card
2009-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	it is for those who persist, I have a pair of those and I　never try to overrun it
2009-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	i read something interesting, it actually uses 300mW, and you'll never get above this value if you just use the card like that
2009-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	yes its mentioned previously but again its only TX level
2009-08-23T05:06:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	but you know, on the web you have the awus036EH => 300mW and the awus036h -> 500 mW, aren't you confusing ?
2009-08-23T05:07:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	root5_	no because the link I　have provided to you on the fcc website, there is a pdf file specifically detailing its TX power
2009-08-23T05:07:00.000Z	root5_	psycho_oreos	ok
