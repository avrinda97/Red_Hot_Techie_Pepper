2012-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	gopostal		what options do i have when my computer doesnt see my harddisk? it starts spinning but then stops and wont be mounted, can i force this or anything for recovery
2012-08-03T19:49:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 Is it not listed with `sudo fdisk -l` ?
2012-08-03T19:50:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	hmm no :(
2012-08-03T19:51:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 Unplug it. Replug and check `dmesg` does it list any new events?
2012-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	i do get a pretty big list but i guess it has to be on the bottom line? there doenst seem to be anything related to a harddisk
2012-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 Yeah. OK I mean do `dmesg` unplug+replug, and dmesg again. See what's new
2012-08-03T19:56:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	hmm nothing
2012-08-03T19:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 do you think the actual hardware is bust? how long after you connect it does it power down (every time for the same duration)? Does it make weird noises?
2012-08-03T20:01:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	yeah its probably bust, it sound well, starts spinning but after 10-20secs it just stops
2012-08-03T20:02:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 Try it on a different machine, with a different cord if possible
2012-08-03T20:02:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	i did try that
2012-08-03T20:04:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	does it mean that theres noway i can recover my data?
2012-08-03T20:04:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 If the hardware is busted you could take it to a recovery specialist, but their services aren't cheap
2012-08-03T20:05:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 Last last last resort , I heard that if you put it in the freezer for a few hours in a sealed bag. Then you take it out and have 10 mins to recover what you can before it's permanently gone. That's just what I heard though, you should google some more tips)
2012-08-03T20:06:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	oke its worth a try :) and to open up the disk?
2012-08-03T20:07:00.000Z	gopostal	NewWorld	thanks for the help i will try the freezer :)
2012-08-03T20:08:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 OK, please google this method to see what others have said about it. There should be more info
2012-08-03T20:09:00.000Z	NewWorld	gopostal	 And a _sealed_ bag so no moisture enters
