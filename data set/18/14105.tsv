2009-04-01T03:29:00.000Z	reisio		any known drawbacks to installing from Windows?
2009-04-01T03:31:00.000Z	reisio		k, just curious
2009-04-01T03:31:00.000Z	reisio		would seem like a disk image inside a Windows partition would be inherintly weird
2009-04-01T03:32:00.000Z	reisio		inherent* p'shaw
2009-04-01T03:33:00.000Z	reisio		yeah, sounds far out :p
2009-04-01T03:33:00.000Z	reisio		I was setting up a mount point for Windows and it was the same partition as Ubuntu :p

2009-04-01T03:35:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	The drawbacks are that you have a (very small) performance degradation from one more layer of abstraction, and you are on NTFS.  So if NTFS gets corrupted somehow, etc.
2010-02-14T04:49:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	server ISO or minimal ISO
2010-02-14T04:49:00.000Z	reisio	Flannel	I don't see a "minimal" anywhere
2010-02-14T04:50:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	It's 8MB, you download all the packages during the install: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2010-02-14T04:50:00.000Z	reisio	Flannel	hahah, thanks
2010-02-14T04:50:00.000Z	reisio	Flannel	thanks
2010-02-14T04:52:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	No problem
2011-10-16T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	adduser is a better utility for most purposes
2011-10-16T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	yes
2011-10-16T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	reisio	right, adduser instead of useradd.  Even the manpage for useradd says that.
2011-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	reisio	Flannel	the one Ubuntu modified :p
