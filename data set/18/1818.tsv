2010-10-29T18:17:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		Hey guys, I'm getting a repeated error in syslog that says this: [drm:r600_audio_bits_per_sample] *ERROR* Unknown bits per sample 0xf using 16 instead.
2010-10-29T18:17:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		Anybody know what it means and how to fix it
2010-10-29T18:18:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		Two of my monitors fail to start when it happens
2010-10-29T18:18:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		and it continually does it
2010-10-29T18:18:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		Anybody got an idea?
2010-10-29T18:19:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		like, 25% of the time on boot up.  If the machine boots correctly, its happy.
2010-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		If its an ATI card, it won't use vesa
2010-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		Its use the radeon driver, most likely
2010-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		unless its really old
2010-10-29T18:23:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		and they work well
2010-10-29T18:24:00.000Z	Copernic__	cookiemonster_	ist there a good opensource driver for the radeon?
2010-10-29T18:25:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		Copernic, the "radeon" driver I use is supposed to be the open source one
2010-10-29T18:25:00.000Z	cookiemonster_		I used to use fglrx and didn't have this problem, but I had others
2010-10-29T18:26:00.000Z	cookiemonster_	Copernic__	did you get my last message?  I forgot the spaces in your name
