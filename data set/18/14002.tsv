2011-01-15T08:28:00.000Z	ubu_noob		Help.. cannot install 10.10 on a PC... the installer hangs at "No value set for key :  `/apps/netbook-launcher/favorites_list"
2011-01-15T08:29:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	What do you have on your PC now?
2011-01-15T08:30:00.000Z	ubu_noob	usr13	there was windows, but I want to wipe that :)
2011-01-15T08:31:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	I've not seen that error, but at what stage of the install process are you at?
2011-01-15T08:31:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	How far did it get before stalling?
2011-01-15T08:31:00.000Z	ubu_noob		bullgard: I tried google -- no luck
2011-01-15T08:33:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	You might try 10.04
2011-01-15T08:33:00.000Z	ubu_noob	usr13	I am booting from the install CD... I guess an early stage because the screen is just purple with some dots, three white, two red
2011-01-15T08:33:00.000Z	ubu_noob		It's the desktop install CD, yes
2011-01-15T08:33:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	You could also try alternate CD
2011-01-15T08:34:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	Is this your first Linux install?
2011-01-15T08:34:00.000Z	ubu_noob		what's the alternate CD?
2011-01-15T08:34:00.000Z	ubu_noob		Zyko.. sure that it's the desktop install CD? the file is called "ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso"... is that what I want?
2011-01-15T08:35:00.000Z	ubu_noob		usr: not the first, no... maybe the third time... only did Fedora before tho
2011-01-15T08:36:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download
2011-01-15T08:36:00.000Z	ubu_noob		ok, I'll try the alternate CD, thanks
2011-01-15T08:37:00.000Z	usr13	ubu_noob	Could be bad media, could be hardware issue, etc. etc.
2011-01-15T08:38:00.000Z	ubu_noob	usr13	yes, many possibilities -- trying to narrow them down is my first task :/
