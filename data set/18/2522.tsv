2010-05-24T19:29:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	grub-install /dev/device
2010-05-24T19:31:00.000Z	complience	zenlunatic	grub-install what is this?
2010-05-24T19:31:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	reinstalls the boot loader.  man grub-install
2010-05-24T19:32:00.000Z	complience	zenlunatic	- this is a fresh install already tho
2010-05-24T19:33:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	well you said something about your boot partition but was vague
2010-05-24T19:34:00.000Z	complience	zenlunatic	im getting strange I/O errors when I try to install unbuntu, I think its to do with the motherboard harddisk controller.
2010-05-24T19:34:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	okay now youre jumping around and confusing me
2010-05-24T19:35:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	i gotta tend to the stove.. brb
2010-05-24T19:38:00.000Z	complience	zenlunatic	let me know when you are back
2010-05-24T19:40:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	back
2010-05-24T19:48:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	do you know how to correctly burn an image?
2010-05-24T19:52:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	i think there is a way to repopulate the /boot partition
2010-05-24T19:55:00.000Z	complience	zenlunatic	i would have thought a basic install would create a /boot partition
2010-05-24T19:56:00.000Z	zenlunatic	complience	it does.  but when you have seperate partitions it makes it easy to do lots of things for admins
2010-05-24T19:57:00.000Z	complience	zenlunatic	ubuntu seems to have a problem reading my harddrive
