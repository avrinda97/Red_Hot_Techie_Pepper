2007-03-09T16:05:00.000Z	profx		thought this linux distro was meant to be newbie friendly?
2007-03-09T16:05:00.000Z	profx		so far, I am not impressed
2007-03-09T16:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	what kind of problems are you having?
2007-03-09T16:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	upgrading the OS is a bad idea, jsut like I think upgrading Windows is a bad idea
2007-03-09T16:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	what makes you say that?
2007-03-09T16:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	well if you're wanting to paste error messages, thats what its for.
2007-03-09T16:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	and you're right, its not useful for you at this time.
2007-03-09T16:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	lol, i'm dense?... i've installed ubuntu at least a dozen times w/o an issue
2007-03-09T16:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	its fine, but when you have installation problems, its best to use the alternate cd
2007-03-11T12:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	is it keeping you from insalling the software you're tring to get?
2007-03-11T12:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	personally, i wouldn't really worry about it, but you can also look at that link.
2007-03-11T12:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	did you install automatix?
2007-03-11T12:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	is automatix in your appliations/systems menu
2007-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	you're making a mountain out of a molehilll, i wouldn't worry about it.
2007-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	why are you trying to add something to synaptic?
2007-03-11T12:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	ok, so this gpg error, is likely coming from one of those 3rd party repos..
2007-03-11T12:25:00.000Z	profx	IndyGunFreak	 correct
2007-03-11T12:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	profx	what do you need to know about repos?
