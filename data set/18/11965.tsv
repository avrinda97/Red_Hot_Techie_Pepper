2006-07-14T08:48:00.000Z	LoneShadow		I didnt ask anything about icons :)
2006-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	LoneShadow		"anyone installed a livecd onto a 1gb usb drive ?"
2006-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	LoneShadow		this is what I asked
2006-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	I couldn't get it work for ubuntu
2006-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	LoneShadow	dli	so are using dsl ?
2006-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	no, I installed gentoo on it, 500MB, with gnome
2006-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	LoneShadow	dli	what problem did you have ?
2006-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	with ubuntu livecd, the initrd script seeks only cd-rom, not usb
2006-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	I can take the ubuntu livecd, use my kernel, recreate the squashfs, it should work
2006-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	LoneShadow	dli	yea
2006-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	gentoo has better docs than ubuntu
2006-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	LoneShadow	dli	I am going try ubuntu livecd once
2006-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	you may try, maybe they already fixed the initrd scripts
2006-07-14T08:54:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	the initrd must be able to locate the booting device, that's the problem, you couldn't use " root=/dev/sda1"
2006-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	LoneShadow	dli	for my setup, root will be /dev/hda2
2006-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	dli	LoneShadow	then, it won't work, if you plug it in another box
2006-07-14T08:56:00.000Z	LoneShadow	dli	I will be installing on a Compact flash card and it will sit inside the msntv box
