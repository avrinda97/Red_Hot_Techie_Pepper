2007-03-05T16:32:00.000Z	zackglennie_		hello?  how can I repair the essential files (like apt-get...) to my ubuntu install?
2007-03-05T16:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	repair?
2007-03-05T16:33:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	I removed most of /usr by accident
2007-03-05T16:34:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	yes, it's a big mistake.  "tar" still seems to work, maybe I can download an archive to install?
2007-03-05T16:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	is your /home on a seperate partition?
2007-03-05T16:46:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	sorry, I didn't notice that message from you (I should get a better irc client).  my /home is not on a separate partition, and there is an additional complication.  I don't have a working cd drive, so it would be a pain to just rebuild from scratch.
2007-03-05T16:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	reinstalling is your only actual option, tbh.
2007-03-05T16:50:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	is there any way to get the basic things back, like chroot?
2007-03-05T16:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	not really; things are a sure mess.
2007-03-05T16:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	if you want chroot though just use a live cd
2007-03-05T16:51:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	no working cd drive, remember?
2007-03-05T16:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	ack. Other options in /msg ubotu install
2007-03-05T16:52:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	come again?  you want me too message someone?
2007-03-05T16:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	zackglennie_	the bot; it returns a factoid.
2007-03-05T16:54:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	oh, I see.
2007-03-05T16:54:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	I thought you had typo-ed.
2007-03-05T16:55:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	ok, I think I can get my data from /home off the partition.
2007-03-05T16:56:00.000Z	zackglennie_	apokryphos	no... mount is working but I don't have root access because sudo is gone. fuck!
