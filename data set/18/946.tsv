2011-08-10T02:05:00.000Z	Myrtti	gigenieks	what was your question then?
2011-08-10T02:05:00.000Z	Myrtti	gigenieks	although, did you get any help in #xubuntu?
2011-08-10T02:08:00.000Z	gigenieks	Myrtti	I have some problem (not important what) and I wanted to post "new thread" in Ubuntu Forums, BUT I can't make full use of possibilities (meaning editing text (colors, bolding, adding urls etc)) I can only post PURE text... Issue is that I can't click (in other words when I click for example on B nothing happens there is no [B][/B] on screen) on any icons (even smilies!)
2011-08-10T02:12:00.000Z	Myrtti	gigenieks	have you tried other browsers?
2011-08-31T21:38:00.000Z	gigenieks	Myrtti	i think it is right, sec
2011-08-31T21:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	gigenieks	also, just so you know, please have patience in our channels and don't crosspost across immediately if you don't get an answer...
2011-08-31T21:39:00.000Z	gigenieks	Myrtti	thank you! itwas correcty type !! :)
2011-08-31T21:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	gigenieks	it was what charlie-tca told you in #xubuntu eight minutes ago...
