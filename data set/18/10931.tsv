2006-10-05T08:23:00.000Z	vulcanium		hey guys
2006-10-05T08:24:00.000Z	vulcanium		I installed ubuntu for the first time today
2006-10-05T08:24:00.000Z	vulcanium		one minor issue seems to be that there isn't a propper graphics driver isntalled
2006-10-05T08:24:00.000Z	vulcanium		IE, I can't go above 1024x768
2006-10-05T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	that may be the graphics driver, but it also may be misidentification of the monitor.
2006-10-05T08:25:00.000Z	vulcanium	sethk	any way to force a resolution?
2006-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	can you paste your X log to the paste web site?
2006-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	it's named Xorg.0.log
2006-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	in /var/log
2006-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	vulcanium	sethk	I would, but I'm in windows right now
2006-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	best thing to do is look at the log.  otherwise, we are just guessing.
2006-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	with the log we can tell you immediately what's going on, and hopefully how to fix it.
2006-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	vulcanium	sethk	understood.
2006-10-05T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	there are ext2/3 drivers available for windows
2006-10-05T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	no virtual driver, there is a real driver
2006-10-05T08:41:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	I pay attention, and I've not heard of problems there.  But investigate for yourself; problems can be rare but still exist and may be serious.
2006-10-05T08:41:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	my judgement is that it is the best alternative if FAT32 is not an option for some reason.
2006-10-05T08:46:00.000Z	sethk	vulcanium	did it crash, or didn't it crash?   :)
