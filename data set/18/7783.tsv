2007-11-21T02:26:00.000Z	kazol3		Is anyone here familiar with installing drivers for Broadcom wifi NICs?
2007-11-21T02:26:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	unless you need to be doing network monitor, ndiswrapper is really nice
2007-11-21T02:27:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	and usually if ndiswrapper can't do it, no one can
2007-11-21T02:27:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	I'm having problems with bcm43xx fwcutter-I have a very low signal.
2007-11-21T02:28:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	yea, the bcm43xx is of poor quality right now. You can only get 11 MB out of the usual 54 MB from that driver.
2007-11-21T02:28:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	I highly recommend FIRST uninstalling your drivers, THEN installing ndiswrapper
2007-11-21T02:30:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	Ok, I'll try. 11 vs 54 Mb is no problem to me, I just need good reception-my speed right now is 50kB.
2007-11-21T02:32:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	the speed and distance both increase or decrease proportionally, btw. :)
2007-11-21T02:32:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	if you are far, you get low speeds.
2007-11-21T02:32:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	if you have low speeds, it'll act as if you were farther
2007-11-21T02:33:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	inverse-square law?
2007-11-21T02:33:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	something like that. ;)
2007-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	The WAP is directly above the office.
2007-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	I should be getting >40Mb.
2007-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	:P
2007-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	But my speed is slower than dial-up.
2007-11-21T02:35:00.000Z	javaJake	kazol3	yea, it's probably the drivers, and if not, it's the device (if you haven't tested it elsewhere)
2007-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	kazol3	javaJake	It worked fine with the WAP being much farther away.
