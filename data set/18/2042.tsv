2010-09-10T04:27:00.000Z	IdleOne		hmm maybe it's my client displaying it wrong
2010-09-10T04:27:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	yes there's not extra space, it's just the font
2010-09-10T04:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	thanks.
2010-09-11T20:48:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	ikonia : that's gonna help him :)
2010-11-24T23:12:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	mr_daniel is running ubuntu server, so I guess he doesn't have the Software Sources tool
2010-11-24T23:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	in that case, yeah manually
2010-11-24T23:12:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	well, not sure, as he's trying to install VirtualBox
2011-08-13T17:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	please turn off that auto greet script
2011-09-09T20:35:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	use quotes around the words, apt-cache search "firstword secondword"
2011-09-09T20:36:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	but it may be more efficient to do something like : apt-cache search firstword | grep secondword
2011-09-09T20:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	trying apt-cache search xchat | grep irc and nothing returns.
2011-09-09T20:38:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	apt-cache search xchat | grep -i irc
2011-09-09T20:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	thank you.
2011-09-09T20:39:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	that'll be case-insensitive, though I'm not sure why you would make such a search
2011-09-09T20:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	I used xchat and irc as a test because I know xchat exists as a package
2011-09-09T20:40:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	ok :) I get it
2012-10-06T12:57:00.000Z	glebihan	IdleOne	I think you're reading sarcasm from him when it wasn't meant to be
2012-10-06T12:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	glebihan	I did.
