2007-01-24T09:22:00.000Z	gaspipe1		anyone know how to copy files via termanal?
2007-01-24T09:23:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	i misspelled your name. Try "cp <original> <copy>"
2007-01-24T09:23:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	my prob. is that i have a few fonts in a folder on my desktop and i wish to cp them to "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf"
2007-01-24T09:23:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	can't you just use the GUI?
2007-01-24T09:24:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	no the folder is locked
2007-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	you need to use root access. So use this: "sudo cp <original> <destination>"
2007-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	the line would be sudo cp *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf
2007-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	so what's the problem you're having?
2007-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	i just don't know what to replace the * with (the fonts are in a folder called fonts on my desktop
2007-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	I'm not sure. You can always use Nautilus with root access by using "gksudo nautilus"
2007-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	open 2 of those and drag...
2007-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	i'm a noob to linux... and afraid you just lost me
2007-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	u don't know the "path" for access to a folder on you desktop?
2007-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	Ah, I see. It's ~/Desktop
2007-01-24T09:28:00.000Z	cablesm102	gaspipe1	your desktop's path is ~/Desktop
2007-01-24T09:29:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	so "sudo cp ~/Desktop/fonts/lucida grande.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf" should work?
2007-01-24T09:31:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	that didn't work... oww well try again another time
2007-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	gaspipe1	cablesm102	night and thanx
