2011-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	WilGil		hey, guys I have a new one.  Hopefuly one of you can help.  I just used the startup disk creator to make a bootable usb.  Now i have installed and want to reuse the usb.  However, when I plug it in it will not mount, does not show up under lsusb.  But I can still boot from it. Can anyone explain what is going on?
2011-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	look at the usb with disk utility.
2011-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	thanks, tried that but no dice.  I also ran fdisk -l and it does not show up there either.
2011-10-01T08:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	start the computer with it plugged in, hard to say what is happening really.
2011-10-01T08:15:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	tried that as well no dice unless i go to the boot select popup and select boot from usb device.
2011-10-01T08:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	in your sistuation I would try it in another OS or use a bootable gparted disc or any one that will read the partition format, and format it to what you want..
2011-10-01T08:20:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	thanks, but i don't have any other os's running right now.  I run windoze through virtual machines (and i doubt windoze will read it either).  maybe if i boot it in a machine running knoppix.
2011-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	some usb's have firmware on them that can cause problems have you looked on the web?
2011-10-01T08:22:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	i have been searching for about 2 hours now. I don't believe that to be the case. I think I know whats wrong, but don't know how to fix it.
2011-10-01T08:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	maybe if you share your hypothesis it would help.
2011-10-01T08:25:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	I believe that there is a set of reserved bits on all usb flash drives that contain information about the brand, size, and the fact that the device is a removable flash drive.  When the startup disk creator loaded the boot loader and created the persistence partition it flips the bits that denote that it is a flash drive so that a full install can be performed.
2011-10-01T08:40:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	its called the rmb and the only apps that give access are for windows
2011-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	you can probably wipe the whole usb, I has a sandisk thta was a problem, nut on the web was a way of removing the firmware.
2011-10-01T08:46:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	thanks i am familiar with that that is the sandisk u3 utility built into the firmware of the disk controller.  Mine is a pny specifically chosen because it is a very generic usb drive.  There has to be a way to fix theis from linux.  I am pretty much done with windows.  I still have one computer at home running windows and if all else fails i will try some of the usb partition...
2011-10-01T08:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	you might try dban.
2011-10-01T08:49:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	maybe, i was just reading something about testdisk, maybe that will work
2011-10-01T08:56:00.000Z	WilGil	urlin2u	this is bizzar.  I just stuck the flash drive in another machine to see if it would boot it and it did (as i expected).  Pulled it out and popped it into my desktop, upon which i was installing test disk and it automounted and popped up on the desktop.  Thanks for all of your help.
2011-10-01T08:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	WilGil	cool np.
