2005-06-27T08:05:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	- have you tried saving the commands you want to run in a text file, and just running that?
2005-06-27T08:06:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	Yeah, that's what I was hoping would work
2005-06-27T08:06:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	Really? I chmod'd it and it didn't work
2005-06-27T08:07:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	it may be that the current directory is not in your path.  try running it as ./yourfile
2005-06-27T08:07:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	Ah, there it goes.
2005-06-27T08:08:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	How would I be able to get it to run by double-clicking it and hitting the "run" button? As it stands now, I have to ./file in the console
2005-06-27T08:09:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	 Hm, I'm sure there's an easy way: right click a panel, use add to panel, custom application launcher...  maybe that works for you?
2005-06-27T08:15:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	Where would I need to put the script files so I'd be able to run them from any directory, without being in their specific one?
2005-06-27T08:15:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	 /usr/local/bin is probably the best place
2005-06-27T08:16:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	 that would work, but it's bad form :)
2005-06-27T08:17:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	Thanks for your help. =)
2005-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	I feel as though I gained 10-20 1337 points
2005-06-27T08:20:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	Oi, I'm having another problem, but this time I know what it is.
2005-06-27T08:21:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	I can't run the scripts, because they point to where the game I'm trying to run is... on a NTFS partition that only root has access to. And I can't chown because it's a read-only drive.
2005-06-27T08:22:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	 Hm, you want different mount options.  Lemme go check man mount
2005-06-27T08:23:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	 you want the option umask=022 or some such probably in your /etc/fstab
2005-06-27T08:36:00.000Z	ja32768	CrustyPunk	 Uh, that's a problem...   did you have a stray chown -R 1000 /  somewhere?
2005-06-27T08:37:00.000Z	CrustyPunk	ja32768	That's my guess, should I chown -r 0 /
