2009-08-26T17:40:00.000Z	leira_		I wan't ask some question maybe not so related to ubuntu, I have a 750GB external USB hard drive, which have only one ext3 partition. I copied some files in Ubuntu Jaunty, then attached this drive to my nas My Book World Edition, but some files can't be read in My Book
2009-08-26T17:41:00.000Z	leira_		When I sshed to My Book, use ls to show this file, it said "No Such File or Directory"
2009-08-26T17:41:00.000Z	leira_		it's quite strange, they both runs Linux~
2009-08-26T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	leira_	 just a guess.. but i bet its ownership/permission differances.. if it can read Some of the files.. see what/who owns them.
2009-08-26T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	leira_	 the fact they both run linux  means you got to pay attention to the owner/groups of the files/dirs and permissions on them
2009-08-26T17:42:00.000Z	leira_	Dr_Willis	they all owned by www-data, and if it's the permission, won't it say "permission denied"?
2009-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		No idea. I just know that moving a usb ext2/3 from one linux box to others.. can cause issues.
2009-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	leira_	Dr_Willis	 all the files owned by www-data, some of them can be read, some of them can't~
2009-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	leira_	 via SSH you cant read some of them? or vya the samba/network share stuff?
2009-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	leira_		is there any way I can get some more infomation?
2009-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	leira_	Dr_Willis	I can read some og them via ssh
2009-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	leira_		and the ones can be read can also be read by samba~
2009-08-26T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	leira_	 perhaps theres some world-book hacking site/channel/guides that may have info..  Not sure what to even check.  May be somthing trivial we are overlooking.. or something deeper.
2009-08-26T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		!info amarok
2009-08-26T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		These version #'s from !info always confuse me.
2009-08-26T17:46:00.000Z	leira_	Dr_Willis	well, thanks anyway~
