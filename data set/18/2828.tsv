2010-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	arleslie		Thank you ubuntu for whipping my thumbdrive with out telling me...
2010-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	not to disappoint, ubuntu didnt do it. you did it. ubuntu asked you if you wanted to do it lol
2010-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	I was installing grub using the grub-install, which I've asked multiple times for help and now I finally get it to work by just telling it to install on /dev/sdb and now my filetype is RAW, so no it did not tell me that it was going to render it usless.
2010-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	in grub, your disks should have been laid out in a format that was readable by size. you didnt view what you were writing to prior to doing so?
2010-02-24T04:40:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	I have, but grub wouldn't install onto it, so I figured that I might as well try sdb and well it worked, and rendered it useless
2010-02-24T04:41:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	im really sorry that it rendered it useless. ive done a similar thing before, but realized it, and fixed it. i hope it didnt kill any data on it that was of real importance like family pics and stuff
2010-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	well it killed my report, but luckly EASEUS recovers the entire partition, but do you think you can help me once I fix my pendrive?
2010-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	will you be on in about 30 minutes, I have to recover the partition
2010-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	i may. there are alot more intelligent people on here than me tho when it comes to that im sure. but, i will help if i see you
2010-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	what exactly are you doing so i understand it
2010-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	well I've asked multiple times but no one has offered to help
2010-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	I'm trying to install Grub2 onto my pendrive, using grub-install, but I keep getting: "Cannot find a GRUB device for /dev/sdb1"
2010-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	i understand that, but for what? are you trying to install a portable linux distro?
2010-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	arleslie	adambuntu	I'm going to use it to run multiple livecds
2010-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	adambuntu	arleslie	ah. so you are going to be able to boot several versions of linux/windows on a portable... i get it
