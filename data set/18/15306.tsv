2005-05-09T05:10:00.000Z	bassMonkey	thoreauputic	I'm about to...
2005-05-09T05:11:00.000Z	bassMonkey	thoreauputic	just tought that maybe someone here had done this already.
2005-05-09T05:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bassMonkey	I tried samba, but I prefer nfs here - I have no reason to use it really
2005-05-31T14:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bassMonkey	welcome to the wonderful world of gdesklet bloat ;)
2005-05-31T14:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bassMonkey	last time I tried gdesklets I uninstalled them within the hour as they were eating my cpu
2005-05-31T14:23:00.000Z	bassMonkey	thoreauputic	=/

2005-05-31T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bassMonkey	yes, and w32codecs has, for example some quicktime sound codecs etc
2005-07-04T12:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bassMonkey	chmod 664 I think
2005-07-04T12:09:00.000Z	bassMonkey	thoreauputic	ok, so 644 should mean rw-r-r then?
