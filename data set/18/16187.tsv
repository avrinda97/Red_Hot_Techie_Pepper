2004-11-20T06:23:00.000Z	Matt|	lamont_r	nothing in particular, it's more what I want it to do

2004-11-20T06:23:00.000Z	Matt|	lamont_r	i want the following window focus: when dragging and dropping I would like the target window, if active, to remain active
2004-11-20T06:24:00.000Z	Matt|	lamont_r	you know if this is possible?
2004-11-20T06:24:00.000Z	lamont_r	Matt|	I would love the same behaivor.  short of hacking over the source, I haven't found any way to change some of the focus options that I dislike though...
