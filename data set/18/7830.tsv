2007-11-08T00:08:00.000Z	UBUNTUISLOVED		why use customize when users first use ubuntu dont know what they need
2007-11-08T00:08:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	Please move this to offtopic or cease discussion.
2007-12-28T22:02:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	they do the same thing.
2007-12-28T22:03:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	Its okay
2007-12-31T19:07:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	Dont put stuff in /tmp, it needs to be cleared on reboot. Changing this functionality will have unexpected results.
2007-12-31T19:07:00.000Z	UBUNTUISLOVED	Pici	i like to be in control
2007-12-31T19:07:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	So? /tmp is designed to be cleared on reboot.
2007-12-31T19:08:00.000Z	UBUNTUISLOVED	Pici	 but why?
2007-12-31T19:10:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	This isnt like windows, user temporary things usually get stuck in your user's home folder somewhere.  /tmp is for stuff you shouldnt touch, like application locks. You want those to dissapear when you reboot.
2007-12-31T19:11:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	I suggest you find a new place to stick stuff instead of /tmp
2007-12-31T19:12:00.000Z	Pici	UBUNTUISLOVED	This is like putting files in the trashcan by your desk and wondering why every morning your files are gone.
2008-01-21T20:54:00.000Z	UBUNTUISLOVED	Pici	how do i tell someone to stop posting the same question 100 times
