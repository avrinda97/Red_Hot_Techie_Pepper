2011-09-09T14:02:00.000Z	devcalais		Someone mind having a browse at this pastebin and telling me what I'm doing wrong? trying to compile a .tar

2011-09-09T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2011-09-09T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vincent-c/conky; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install conky     gives you 1.8.1
2011-09-09T14:04:00.000Z	devcalais	ActionParsnip	- natty, 11.04 64bit!
2011-09-09T14:05:00.000Z	devcalais	ActionParsnip	- was my syntax to compiling a .tar file correct, though? Just unlucky on a dependancy?
2011-09-09T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	the ppa will give the version you want
2011-09-09T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	no idea, but there is a ppa with a binary of what you need, so why bother
2011-09-09T14:07:00.000Z	devcalais	ActionParsnip	- ... self education, why else!
2011-09-09T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	no idea, that's why I asked!
2011-09-09T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	press ALT+F2 and run:  conky
2011-09-09T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	not really awkward
2011-09-09T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	if you don't see it, run it in a terminal. You may need to copy a .conkyrc from in the OS (or online) to make it run
2011-09-09T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	seems your compile needs lua5.1 installing
2011-09-09T14:15:00.000Z	devcalais	ActionParsnip	that's just a dependancy based on whatever package I was trying to compile? Nothing wrong with my method of compiling the package at all?
2011-09-09T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	looks spot on, just needed to satisfy deps
2011-09-09T14:16:00.000Z	devcalais	ActionParsnip	I'm just happy I got the syntax correct ;) avoided the immediate problem. Cheers!
2011-09-09T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devcalais	np, using PPAs makes life a tonne easier, plus the packages will gel with the existing ones making install / remove as easy as any other package
