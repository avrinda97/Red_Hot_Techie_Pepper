2009-06-16T13:58:00.000Z	Lartza_		How do I use thunar for desktop? I have openbox
2009-06-16T13:59:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	Isn't thunar file manager (and not desktop)?
2009-06-16T13:59:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	Nautilus does that, but as far as I know thunar doesn't.
2009-06-16T14:00:00.000Z	Lartza_	sanxiyn	YOur system has that too
2009-06-16T14:00:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	?
2009-06-16T14:01:00.000Z	Lartza_	sanxiyn	YOur desktop is propably runned with a file manager too
2009-06-16T14:01:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	No it isn't.
2009-06-16T14:01:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	I use IceWM.
2009-06-16T14:02:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	Maybe you want something like iDesk?
2009-06-16T14:03:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	Which is a desktop and an icon mananer (and not a file manager).
2009-06-16T14:03:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	So no, thunar is a file manager, therefore doesn't manage desktop.
2009-06-16T14:06:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	IIRC ROX is a file manager that can do desktop too.
2009-06-16T14:07:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	Hm, it seems nothing fits your requirement :( Too bad.
2009-06-16T14:07:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	I used to use ROX (with a lot of custom configuration), but not now.
2009-06-16T14:09:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	Hm maybe you want to report bugs to PCMan and get them fixed?
2009-06-16T14:09:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	ok, so you don't like ROX default, but pcman lacks feature entirely?
2009-06-16T14:09:00.000Z	sanxiyn	Lartza_	I see.
2009-06-16T14:12:00.000Z	Lartza_	sanxiyn	You need to ask conky's author.
