2007-07-31T08:17:00.000Z	kevor_		Anyone a clue why a HD with an install won't work on the one system and does work on the other system?
2007-07-31T08:17:00.000Z	kevor_		must have something to do whith that UUID...
2007-07-31T08:19:00.000Z	genii	kevor_	Bios may map the drive differently on the two boxes for instance.
2007-07-31T08:19:00.000Z	kevor_	genii	map the drive? what exactly does that mean?
2007-07-31T08:20:00.000Z	genii	kevor_	One computer might see the drive with X heads X sectors X cylinders   but computer2 sees it like Y heads Y sectors Y cylinders
2007-07-31T08:22:00.000Z	genii	kevor_	If you go into bios on the computer it works with and write down all the numbers for the drive, on computer2 put the drive in exact same spot on IDE and cable, in bios there, specify exactly heads,cylinders etc as you copied it from the one that works
2007-07-31T08:22:00.000Z	kevor_	genii	i've checked, the new system (with a live cd by the way) with dumpe2fs, it gives me the same UUID
2007-07-31T08:23:00.000Z	kevor_		well, the same HD in the new system gives me the same UUID
2007-07-31T08:24:00.000Z	kevor_	genii	calm down ;P
2007-07-31T08:24:00.000Z	genii	kevor_	At any rate, the uuid has nothing to do with the scenario i am saying.
2007-07-31T08:25:00.000Z	kevor_		maybe you misunderstood..
2007-07-31T08:25:00.000Z	kevor_		let me try again :OP
2007-07-31T08:26:00.000Z	kevor_		I've an old system, took out the HD and put it in a new one. The HD in the new system, and boot gives me an error the install cannot be loaded, for the /dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID number is not found
2007-07-31T08:27:00.000Z	kevor_		sorry if i seem a little fuzzy :)
2007-07-31T08:27:00.000Z	genii	kevor_	Ah, OK, that is more clear. Your original description given makes it like you removed the hd from one box, transplanted it to another and it was not working in the new box.
2007-07-31T08:28:00.000Z	kevor_	genii	exactly :)
2007-07-31T08:29:00.000Z	genii	kevor_	The OS installed fine to the new HD ut it is giving the uuid errors then
2007-07-31T08:29:00.000Z	kevor_	genii	have not reinstalled, just migrated the HD :)
