2008-02-12T00:36:00.000Z	burkmat		Trying to mount a LaCie BigDisk 500GB external HDD (Linux claims it's HPFS/NTFS, I know it's NTFS). sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 returns an error (wrong fstype, bad option or damaged superblock). Any ideas?
2008-02-12T00:38:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	Incompatible NTFS version?
2008-02-12T00:38:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	IIRC, you should be using ntfs-3g, instead, anyway.
2008-02-12T00:39:00.000Z	burkmat	shortcircuit	went down the path of trying to get that a year ago or something... iirc, thats why I gave up. will try again then. :P
2008-02-12T00:39:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	I assume you're using Ubuntu.
2008-02-12T00:40:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	apt-cache search ntfs-3g
2008-02-12T00:40:00.000Z	burkmat	shortcircuit	Yeah, hence the #ubuntu channel. :P Thanks, will try that.

2008-02-12T00:43:00.000Z	burkmat	shortcircuit	So yeah, that showed me libntfs-3g-dev, 3g0 and ntfs-3g. What do I do with that info? ^^
2008-02-12T00:44:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	Those are packages that provide ntfs-3g
2008-02-12T00:44:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	"apt-get install ntfs-3g" will install it.
2008-02-12T00:44:00.000Z	burkmat	shortcircuit	Treat me like the rookie I am. Not new to computers at all, but Linux.. That's another story. :P
2008-02-12T00:45:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	use "dpkg -L ntfs-3g|grep man" to find the names of the man pages provided.
2008-02-12T00:46:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	You should see lines for ntfs-3g.8.gz, mount.ntfs-3g.8.gz, and mount.ntfs.8.gz
2008-02-12T00:47:00.000Z	burkmat	shortcircuit	Yeah, that's right.
2008-02-12T00:47:00.000Z	shortcircuit	burkmat	Read those manpages.  That should get you a little close.
2008-02-12T00:48:00.000Z	burkmat	shortcircuit	On it, didnt see nonhighlited at first. :) Thanks for the help. ^^
