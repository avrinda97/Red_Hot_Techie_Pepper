2011-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	Andrew131		Is it possible to disable the zeitgeist daemon?
2011-10-18T00:02:00.000Z	Andrew131		Can anyone read what I'm writing?
2011-10-18T00:02:00.000Z	Andrew131		Alright cool
2011-10-18T00:02:00.000Z	Andrew131		Thanks
2011-10-18T00:04:00.000Z	VCoolio	Andrew131	you want to disable this session or future also?
2011-10-18T00:04:00.000Z	Andrew131	VCoolio	from looking it looks like I lose unity if I do that so Im going to file a bug report
2011-10-18T00:05:00.000Z	VCoolio	Andrew131	ok, if you want it gone, edit or remove /etc/xdg/autostart/zeistgeist-datahub.desktop
2011-10-18T00:06:00.000Z	Andrew131		Thanks VCoolio
2011-10-18T00:06:00.000Z	Andrew131		I didnt realize until just now that the daemon is linked with unity
2011-10-18T00:06:00.000Z	Andrew131		So I'll screw myself if I do that
2011-10-18T00:07:00.000Z	VCoolio		if your system get unusable because of ram usage, you have little choice, or install xubuntu-desktop and log in on an xfce session
2011-10-18T00:07:00.000Z	VCoolio	Andrew131	^^
2011-10-18T00:08:00.000Z	Andrew131	VCoolio	?
2011-10-18T00:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	Andrew131	ah, I wrote something but forgot to address you, two lines above my ^^
2011-10-18T00:09:00.000Z	Andrew131		ahh
2011-10-18T00:10:00.000Z	Andrew131	VCoolio	should I report it as a bug?
2011-10-18T00:10:00.000Z	Andrew131		I just upgraded and now its all slow as garbage because its using up all my ram and slowly eating up my swap
2011-10-18T00:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	Andrew131	I don't know, if you think it's not your fault and zeitgeist-daemon is to blame, yes
