2008-12-17T00:10:00.000Z	cris_core		Hello, I am a first time user looking for some help
2008-12-17T00:12:00.000Z	cris_core		Is there anyone here that can help me with Ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-17T00:14:00.000Z	cris_core		ok. I got a dialog box that said I can use a proprietary driver for my NVIDIA card, so I tried to activate the driver, but it does not activate, and i does not telll me why or what is happening. Does anyone know what is going on?
2008-12-17T00:16:00.000Z	cris_core		So the light next to the driver is not supposed to turn green?
2008-12-17T00:16:00.000Z	cris_core		before i reboot?
2008-12-17T00:17:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Tried installing EnvyNG via synaptic? It's a script which eases the install for Nvidia drivers. The default install dialog wouldn't work for me in 8.04 for an example. Maybe you have the same problem although it's 8.10
2008-12-17T00:17:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	It changed to green for me immeadiately, no reboot. :P
2008-12-17T00:18:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Then run EnvyNG and let it do it's job. =) It will install Nvidia drivers for you.
2008-12-17T00:20:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	It should be available in the menus, for me it was under "Program->System utilites" or something similar.
2008-12-17T00:22:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	In your upper left corner, no panel with menus there?
2008-12-17T00:24:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Did you install envyng-qt?
2008-12-17T00:26:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Ok. Under system, try find Package manage synaptic and search for envy. Check envy-qt and just click ok and when it's finished. It should be available under applications
2008-12-17T00:31:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Did you update synaptic?
2008-12-17T00:32:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Ok, try find it when it's done.
2008-12-17T00:39:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Actually I had trouble too installing the drivers (solved it by using ENvy). I later had to reinstall Intrepid for another reason and then it worked just fine without Envy.
2008-12-17T00:48:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Wohoo. =)
2008-12-17T00:51:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Yes, make sure envyng-qt is installed too.
2008-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	herrP	cris_core	Good, when it's done. You should find it under applications somewhere.
