2007-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	vox754	Master_Z	probably yes. If it is not an integrated card. It is the manufacturers fault, not Linux.
2007-06-15T09:25:00.000Z	vox754	Master_Z	nothing. Live with it. Or reverse engineer the driver yourself.
2007-06-15T10:00:00.000Z	vox754	Master_Z	always start your question with specific information, like model, brand, chipset.  No your eyes color is not important.
2007-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	vox754	Master_Z	open the terminal an type "sudo lshw"  and also "lspci" or "lsusb" to view hardware, pci devices and usb devices.

2007-06-15T10:15:00.000Z	vox754	Master_Z	mmm... One of those newer Asus Mobos. I think some people have problems.
