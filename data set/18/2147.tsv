2010-08-09T09:15:00.000Z	kisplit		If I start developing gui software for linux. Do I need to use GTK+ vs QT for a specific desktop environment?
2010-08-09T09:15:00.000Z	rww	kisplit	generally, GNOME programs are GTK+ and KDE ones are Qt, but you can run Qt programs in GNOME and vice versa
2010-08-09T09:16:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	and lelle: Thank you
2010-08-09T22:10:00.000Z	rww	kisplit	no
2010-08-09T22:10:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	Ok thanks
2010-08-09T22:11:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	Do you know what exactly ident is/does?
2010-08-09T22:12:00.000Z	rww	kisplit	theoretically, it identifies which user owns the program that's using a given port, so that on a server with multiple users, you can identify each one by ident (and filter channel access as desired). In reality, idents can be faked trivially on home computers, so it's less used, though shell hosts still use it a lot.
2010-08-09T22:15:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	Thanks for the explanation, I found it helpful =]
2010-08-09T22:21:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	I'm sorry to bother you again, you just seem to know so much about this =P: When I whois myself it shows my actual hostname. Can everyone else see this?
2010-08-09T22:21:00.000Z	rww	kisplit	yes
2010-08-10T05:33:00.000Z	rww	kisplit	you need to use /save afterwards to save configuration changes like that
2010-08-10T05:33:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	I did and it's written to the .config file
2010-08-10T05:34:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	.irssi/config*
2010-08-10T05:34:00.000Z	rww	kisplit	odd. I used "/ignore -channel #ubuntu * JOINS PARTS QUITS" and it works fine
2010-08-10T05:34:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	and after that command you used /save?
2010-08-10T05:36:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	/ignore
2010-08-10T05:36:00.000Z	kisplit	rww	sorry disregard that
