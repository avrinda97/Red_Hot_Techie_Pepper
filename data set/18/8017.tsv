2008-08-10T10:34:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	_orly_owl__	hd0 then
2008-08-10T10:35:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja		GRUB only counts HDDs but makes no allowances for whether they're PATA, SATA, SCSI or whatever
2008-08-10T10:35:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja		If you only have a single HDD then it's always going to be hd0 according to GRUB'
2008-08-10T10:36:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		i copied all the OS files from my old PATA drive over to the ATA drive using rsync
2008-08-10T10:39:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		ok ill try hd0,0
2008-08-10T10:47:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		it still doesnt work
2008-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		doesny even find GRUB
2008-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		and i have menu.lst set to hd0,0
2008-08-10T10:58:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		anyone? trying to boot from SATA here
2008-08-10T10:59:00.000Z	_orly_owl__	tritium	i ï»¿copied all the OS files from a PATA drive to a SATA drive using rsync, and now it won't boot.
2008-08-10T11:00:00.000Z	_orly_owl__	tritium	i know, but what would the SATA drive be in menu.lst? hd0?
2008-08-10T11:01:00.000Z	_orly_owl__		i dont think it's hd0 as the PC doesnt even find GRUB
2008-08-10T11:01:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	_orly_owl__	what have you done to make this more complicated than it should be?
