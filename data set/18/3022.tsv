2010-01-01T15:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	what rpm were you trying to convert
2010-01-01T15:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	no need for that
2010-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	you dont want to mix versions.
2010-01-01T17:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	repository is repo; 9.04 should be used only with 9.04 repos
2010-01-01T20:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	check out medibuntu.org for the .deb
2010-01-01T20:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	you dont want to reference terminal to open .bin files with.
2010-01-01T20:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	how are you trying to install those drivers?
2010-01-01T20:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	that is not the supported method, you need to install from the package manager
2010-01-01T20:40:00.000Z	Xfact	bazhang	yes I know...but Hardy only supports 169.o2 of Nvidia that's too old, I've got the latest version from nvidia's website and trying to install it ...
2010-01-01T20:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	take a look at the guide book I linked you to
2010-01-23T14:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	that is offtopic here
2010-01-23T14:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Xfact	#ubuntu-offtopic
