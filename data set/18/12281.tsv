2007-12-20T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	david__	because your normal user doesn't have permissions.
2007-12-20T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	david__	the files are owned by the webserver - not your user
2007-12-20T16:48:00.000Z	david__	ikonia	can i be admin in web server
2007-12-20T16:48:00.000Z	ikonia	david__	using sudo before the commands will give you administrator access to that directory
2007-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	david__	ikonia	there any one  to make directory
2012-09-09T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	david__	it really depends what is contained within the tarball
