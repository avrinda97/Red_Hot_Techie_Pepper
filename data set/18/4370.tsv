2009-12-30T11:51:00.000Z	gotsanity		I am using a fresh install of karmic and my wireless is connecting and then disconnecting in about 10 mins. After it disconnects it will not reconnect short of a reboot. I am using an atheros ar928x chipset. Anyone have any idea?
2009-12-30T11:52:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	Install the backport modules.
2009-12-30T11:53:00.000Z	gotsanity		kinja: i thought i did. i found a forum post suggesting that but its still behaving the same way
2009-12-30T11:53:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	gotsanity: "aptitude search linux-backports-modules-karmic" -- It shows an "i" ?
2009-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	gotsanity		kinja: yes
2009-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	I see. Have you reboot yet since you installed the backport kernel?
2009-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	gotsanity		kinja: yes, several times
2009-12-30T11:55:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	What make/model?
2009-12-30T11:57:00.000Z	gotsanity		kinja: HP pavilion dm3-1039wm notebook the card comes up with (via lspci) 08:.00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR9289X Wireless Network Adapter (PCIExpress) (rev 01)

2009-12-30T11:59:00.000Z	gotsanity	kinja-sheep	kk, been a while since i last used xchat :)
2009-12-30T12:01:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	The backports usually would sovle your issue. I had somebody here last night with same card as your and it solved his issue. Not sure why it does not do the same for you.
2009-12-30T12:01:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	I see "linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic" in the repo too. Perhaps you would want to give it a try?
2009-12-30T12:02:00.000Z	gotsanity	kinja-sheep	I am slightly confused as to what the backports does. im assuming it installs some kernel modules that will solve the issue. Now when i rebooted im just selecting the default kernel. should i be looking for another one?
2009-12-30T12:03:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	No. It should be fine. If you want to make sure, you can hold SHIFT at GRUB2 boot. Also, backports is for patches made to the modules after the release date.  Kernel is the heart of the *nix. :)
2009-12-30T12:05:00.000Z	gotsanity	kinja-sheep	k, im doing a reboot on the notebook now (im on a different machine) so I will see what it shows
2009-12-30T12:12:00.000Z	gotsanity	kinja-sheep	it seems to be working now, thanks for the help. im still not quite sure whats goin on but it hasnt dropped on me yet
2009-12-30T12:14:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	gotsanity	That is strange. I didn't think it'll work but we shall see.
