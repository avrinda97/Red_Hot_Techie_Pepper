2012-01-06T11:15:00.000Z	Kimble		Can anyone suggest the option needed to make FSTAB mount a USB drive as read/write for all users?
2012-01-06T11:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	what filesystem
2012-01-06T11:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	you dont overide the fs permissions . yiu use chiwn or chmod in your case
2012-01-06T11:17:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	i'm afraid i'm not sure what that means. Sorry :)
2012-01-06T11:18:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	no, i know what permissions are and how to modify them. I'm just not sure what you're advising me to do.
2012-01-06T11:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	 use chmod and chown. or groups as needed
2012-01-06T11:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	 yiu dont just overide permissions with a mount option
2012-01-06T11:20:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	ah, you mean i just manually change the permissions on the root of the mounted device. gotcha. Thanks.
2012-01-06T11:23:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	thanks for the assist. all sorted now. Night all :)
2012-01-06T11:28:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	hi. I must have misunderstood your solution. On rebooting the machine, the drives I changed ownerships on revert back to root ownership. How can I make them automatically assume ugo+rwx perms?
2012-01-06T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	 you change the files permissions.
2012-01-06T11:29:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	you're going to have to be more explicit.
2012-01-06T11:30:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	I think you're talking about manually changing the permissions once the drives are mounted, am I right?
2012-01-06T11:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	 yes. you cant change them when unmounted..
2012-01-06T11:31:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	I'm afraid that doesn't really meet my needs.  I want the drives to automatically assume the correct permissions on reboot.
2012-01-06T11:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	 restate the issue to the channel. i may  me mussing your needs
2012-01-28T06:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kimble	 samba  perhaps.
2012-01-28T07:00:00.000Z	Kimble	dr_willis	actually, not entirely sure myself.  Samba's a definite yes; NFS is also ( I just checked).
