2010-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	contents	Trion	thanks. The stick mounts on one ubuntu installation, but it won't automount on an old laptop that I just installed lucid on
2010-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	Trion	contents	Hmmmm..
2010-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	contents	Trion	The stick shows up in gparted, but not on the desktop, and not in /media
2010-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	Trion	contents	Did you use the USB creator in lucid to make it?
2010-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	Trion	contents	try ejecting it and putting it back in, that normally works for me
2010-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	Trion	contents	when a usb isnt  being detected
2010-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	contents	Trion	No, it's just data. An NTFS partition and a ext4 partition
2010-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	Trion	contents	Ah gotcha
2010-05-26T18:35:00.000Z	Trion	contents	Should be a way to force mount it
