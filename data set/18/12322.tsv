2006-06-01T13:37:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	how do you like archlinux?
2006-06-01T13:39:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	best distribution i ever had... its abit harder to setup/configure, but once its running it works flawlessly, and you have so many options. pacman package manager look salot like apt-get and ABS is like gentoo's build system.
2006-06-01T13:39:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	I really want to try archlinux out but I dont know if i can handle it
2006-06-01T13:40:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	do you have experience with linux ?
2006-06-01T13:40:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	I just started with it acouple weeks ago
2006-06-01T13:40:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	the #archlinux channel is friendly; but for beginners i wouldnt advise arch. why do you want to try out arch ?
2006-06-01T13:41:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	I really just want to learn what makes it tick and Ive heard that building the system yourself helps you understand a lot about it
2006-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	then maybe gentoo would be good for you, but it is too time consuming and even harder to setup. you have to compile everything from source, and frankly, it isnt that much faster than archlinux (the same kinda) plus in the end you just use portage to compile packages.. that wont teach you anything either
2006-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	if you are serious about learning linux i would START with a distro like ubuntu, and later you can try Archlinux. you will learn alot with arch.
2006-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	I figure the only way to really figure everything out is by jumping in head first. Plus I am on a computer that I just threw together and dont really care about so it would be that big of a deal if anything got messed up.
2006-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	sure, but beginners will enjoy ubuntu better i think :) although my first real distribution was debian too, when it still had the bad/uneasy installer
2006-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	and i liked it
2006-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	ya, I am on ubuntu right now and I have learned a lot but I feel I could learn so much more by using arch
2006-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	well, what do you want to learn. you want to learn how your system works ?
2006-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	pretty much
2006-06-01T13:46:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	well arch will learn you about how linux works better than most distros, because you have to edit alot of files by hand, configuration files that tell your system what to do and where to look
2006-06-01T13:47:00.000Z	profoX`	T-CAN	i havent tried gentoo MYSELF but thats because i hate the compiling-compiling-compiling :) and arch has speed optimizations by default in the packages for i686
2006-06-01T13:48:00.000Z	T-CAN	profoX`	ya, maybe I will just stick around with ubuntu for awhile and see if I feel I know enough about linux in general to switch to arch
