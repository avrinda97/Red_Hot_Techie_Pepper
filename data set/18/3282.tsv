2009-12-14T07:48:00.000Z	AOC		hey guys
2009-12-14T07:48:00.000Z	AOC		i'm booting into rescue mode to recover my root password
2009-12-14T07:49:00.000Z	AOC		where can I find my root passwd in cleartext once in rescue boot mode?
2009-12-14T07:49:00.000Z	AOC		i know passwd changed it
2009-12-14T07:49:00.000Z	AOC		but to view it?
2009-12-14T07:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	and the format used cannot be converted back to cleartext
2009-12-14T07:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	are you using password authentication for ssh, or have you set it to only allow public key authentication?
2009-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	disable password authentication
2009-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	AOC	lstarnes	probably better just to disable passwd auth
2009-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	or lock root
2009-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	I always use passwd -l root
2009-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	AOC	lstarnes	I want to decrypt the /etc/passwd file
2009-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	that cannot be done
2009-12-14T07:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	hashes are one-way
2009-12-14T07:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	it might be possible to bruteforce it
2009-12-14T07:59:00.000Z	AOC	lstarnes	yes
2009-12-14T07:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	linux and windoes are different
2009-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	AOC	you don't have to do it, but you should
