2009-10-20T17:25:00.000Z	boscop		can I do 1000 recursion levels?
2009-10-20T17:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	you mean in the directory structure ?
2009-10-20T17:25:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	no, on the stack
2009-10-20T17:26:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	that depends on the stack size and how many data is being pushed at each recursion
2009-10-20T17:26:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	how can I find out how big the stack is?
2009-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	I just push one int
2009-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	I believe it's 2^32 bytes, on a 32 bits system, if you have that much RAM :)
2009-10-20T17:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	alsdo depends on ulimit -s
2009-10-20T17:29:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	8192
2009-10-20T17:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	ulimit -s unlimited
2009-10-20T17:30:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	but there are already functions on the stack from the OS
2009-10-20T17:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	right, I told you the max, not the max for your own use :P
2009-10-30T18:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	nothing significant
2009-10-30T18:54:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	too bad :(   why is ubuntu soo slow compared to win xp?
2009-10-30T18:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	because it provides more services & features
2009-10-30T18:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	if you have a lower resources system you would better use xubuntu
2009-10-30T18:56:00.000Z	boscop	joaopinto	is 2 Ghz cpu lower resource? or 1GB ram? I had a computer with 256 MB ram and 1.5 Gzh before and it ran faster (on win xp)
2009-10-30T18:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	boscop	ok, that is not a very low system, so you are likely to have some problem causing the performance degradation
