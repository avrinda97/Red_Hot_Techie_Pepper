2007-06-06T14:41:00.000Z	ymelaptop		all i want to know is where the hotplug directory is in ubuntu,
2007-06-06T14:41:00.000Z	crimsun	ymelaptop	Ubuntu doesn't ship with hotplug.
2007-06-06T14:41:00.000Z	ymelaptop		ok, it ships with udev?
2007-06-06T14:42:00.000Z	ymelaptop		thank you crimsun, by the way.
2007-06-06T14:43:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	i've talked to you about wireless cards before, if i have ucode that my card vendor insists the driver needs, where can i go about loading it?
2007-06-06T14:43:00.000Z	crimsun	ymelaptop	slap it into /lib/firmware/
2007-06-06T14:43:00.000Z	ymelaptop		thank you.
2007-06-06T14:44:00.000Z	ymelaptop		preciate it crimsun
2007-06-06T14:44:00.000Z	crimsun	ymelaptop	granted you need a udev rule instead of a hotplug script, but that's fairly straightforward to convert.
2007-06-06T14:44:00.000Z	ymelaptop		i think it came with both, actually
2007-06-06T14:44:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	is a udev rule called a ucode file?
2007-06-06T14:47:00.000Z	crimsun	ymelaptop	no.
2007-06-06T14:48:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	where can i either find documentation on converting it, or where do .ucode files go?
2007-06-06T14:48:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	by the way, sorry to bother you with trivial stuff, you're just the only one tossing out answers to my questions :/
2007-06-06T15:03:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	mind taking alook at a pastebin of mine?
2007-06-06T15:05:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24381/
2007-06-06T15:11:00.000Z	ymelaptop	crimsun	you still around?
2007-06-06T15:12:00.000Z	crimsun	ymelaptop	no, I'm off to work.
