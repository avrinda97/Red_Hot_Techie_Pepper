2006-07-18T11:07:00.000Z	user-land	winman	i don't find it there, only CPU frequency monitor.
2006-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	winman	user-land	hmmm .. I think I installed a package for those applets to list up .. one sec, let me check
2006-07-18T11:10:00.000Z	winman	user-land	sudo apt-get install hardware-monitor
2006-07-18T11:10:00.000Z	winman		this should get you more applets under listed
2006-07-18T11:19:00.000Z	user-land	winman	this gives me percentage for the CPU only ...
2006-07-18T11:20:00.000Z	winman	user-land	well I've got the same package running and the temperature monitor works great for me ...

2006-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	user-land		the 'Hardware Monitor' applet is listed in the end under 'Utility'
2006-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	user-land	winman	so we use two different applets with the same name ?
2006-07-18T11:46:00.000Z	winman	user-land	not sure, don't know why yours is different
2006-07-18T11:52:00.000Z	user-land	winman	what you installed is different, it's called 'sensors-applet'.
2006-07-18T11:53:00.000Z	winman	user-land	hmmm ...
