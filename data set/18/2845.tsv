2011-02-21T09:04:00.000Z	coraxx		hey all. When logging in to Ubuntu after selecting a specific language/country, it asks if I want to "Update names" or "Keep old names" (home directories names) ... if I accidently choose "Update names" and want to reverse that to the original English, how do I do that ? ....anyone ? (come on guys...that's gotta be an easy one ...are you really gonna avoid an easy one)
2011-02-21T09:05:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	log back in in english and it should ask the same thing
2011-02-21T09:06:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	it doesn't  (if it was _that_ easy ...I would be embarrased to be here ;-) )
2011-02-21T09:07:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	try running xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update
2011-02-21T09:07:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	it's the same thing thats run with your session
2011-02-21T09:07:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	I did ...and it didn't work ...it didn't change the dirs
2011-02-21T09:07:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	what did the directories actually change to?
2011-02-21T09:08:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	The Danish names ....  the critical one is the "Desktop" which is now reffered to as "Skrivebord"
2011-02-21T09:10:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	it looks like you have to change the default language again to do it
2011-02-21T09:11:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	there's also .config/user-dirs.locale and user-dirs.dirs
2011-02-21T09:11:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	YES ...that was one of the things I was looking for...the damn location of the setting...thanx man...let me just check it out
2011-02-21T09:11:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	strace is your friend
2011-02-21T09:12:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	strace ?
2011-02-21T09:13:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	it traces system calls, try strace xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update
2011-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	that sound _REALLY_ cool ...I just gotta try it out right now
2011-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	ohsix	coraxx	it's handy for finding what programs are touching without having to dig through a bunch of documentation for info you might never find
2011-02-21T09:16:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	exactly...it sounds too good to be true...just checking it ...(I'm strating my virtuall environment...just to see 4 myself ;-) )
2011-02-21T09:19:00.000Z	coraxx	ohsix	Thanx a milliion ...it ALWAYS a pleasure to learn about new tools ...specially those that helps diagnose thing ...thanx !!!!
