2007-02-02T15:31:00.000Z	TheSkorm		sweeet
2007-02-02T15:32:00.000Z	TheSkorm		oh dera all4n
2007-02-02T15:32:00.000Z	TheSkorm		dear
2007-02-02T15:32:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	that does not sound good..
2007-02-02T15:33:00.000Z	TheSkorm	all4n	: ive never treid such an idea, but there's proberly an easy solution to it
2007-02-02T15:33:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	Yeah, I hope it is in my fstab, but I am not entirely sure about the options for / in fstab.
2007-02-02T15:34:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	the permissions all seem fine when I do ls -l in / though..  so it must be the way it is mounted
2007-02-02T15:34:00.000Z	TheSkorm	all4n	: yes
2007-02-02T15:35:00.000Z	TheSkorm	all4n	: gimmie a second and ill do some looking
2007-02-02T15:37:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	thanks, I'll look into it
2007-02-02T15:37:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	I think it might be the notail option I'm using.. the old partition is using reiserfs, while the new is ext3
2007-02-02T15:37:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	so perhaps the notail option is for reiser only
2007-02-02T15:38:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	anyhow.. I'll try using some of yours.. thanks
2007-02-02T15:38:00.000Z	TheSkorm	all4n	np, but remember its freebsd so i dunno how it matchs up
2007-02-02T15:44:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	hey, I'm back... it worked. notail was definatly not a good idea for ext3.  :)  so now I'm in X already, and things seem fine
2007-02-02T15:44:00.000Z	TheSkorm	all4n	awsome
2007-02-02T15:44:00.000Z	all4n	TheSkorm	yeah..  lotsa more space on root :)
