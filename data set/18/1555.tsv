2011-01-30T17:49:00.000Z	danst_		Have anyone faced the strange issue with language switching: sometimes when you begin to type it automatically starts to change language after every typed symbol?
2011-01-30T17:50:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	sure.
2011-01-30T17:50:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	hit ctrl space to disable ibus input
2011-01-30T17:50:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	oh, thank you
2011-01-30T17:51:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	how many languages you have in ibus-setup
2011-01-30T17:52:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	I suppose two
2011-01-30T17:53:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	the top one creates issues, ie won't launch?
2011-01-30T17:54:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	no, it's just when I type something it changes language every next letter and it goes something like that "sщmуtрiтg lшkу еhфt"
2011-01-30T17:54:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	my ibus is acting very strangely as well, identical setup. I'll check launchpad for bugs
2011-01-30T17:55:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	maybe you know if it's possible to use xorg.conf for configuring layouts in maverick
2011-01-30T17:56:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	I was unable to type when I tried to add keyboard stuff into there
2011-01-30T17:57:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	does ibus-setup let you change
2011-01-30T17:58:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	it told me that ibus is turned off
2011-01-30T17:58:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	is that because I pressed ctrl+space
2011-01-30T17:58:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	anyway, it works after pressing ctrl+space just fine
2011-01-30T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	what about alt f2 ibus-setup , should launch a configuration wizard
2011-01-30T17:58:00.000Z	danst_	bazhang	thank you very much
2011-01-30T17:59:00.000Z	bazhang	danst_	okay
