2010-04-16T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	expr 1 + 1
2010-04-16T02:15:00.000Z	Diverdude	iceroot	expr 1 + 1 does not work
2010-04-16T02:16:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	michael@eeebuntu:~$ expr 1 + 1
2010-04-16T02:16:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	on bashm also on zsh
2010-08-13T02:27:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	what output you want from the script? are you using echo inside the script?
2010-08-13T02:28:00.000Z	Diverdude	iceroot	no i just want to echo the content of the script. cat /usr/local/bin/mountimm works perfectly
2010-08-13T02:28:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	and what is the problem when cat is working?
2010-08-13T02:29:00.000Z	Diverdude	iceroot	that i wanted to do it like this:  $which mountimm | cat    so that i did not have to write the actual path to the bash file
2010-08-13T02:30:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	why the $?
2010-08-13T02:30:00.000Z	Diverdude	iceroot	oh god..thats just to indicate that its a terminal
2010-08-13T02:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	cat `which mountimm`
2010-08-13T02:31:00.000Z	Diverdude	iceroot	its ridicolous to have to first write which mountimm, look at the output and manually type cat thepath
2010-11-07T16:15:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	if it is in the repos (apt-cache search will tell you) then of course
2010-11-11T17:19:00.000Z	iceroot	Diverdude	netmask 255.255.255.0 = /24
