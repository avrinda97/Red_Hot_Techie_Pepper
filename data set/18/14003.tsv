2011-09-28T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	So, which partition is that?
2011-09-28T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	So, which partition is that?
2011-09-28T23:00:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	sudo fdisk -l
2011-09-28T23:00:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	sudo fdisk -l |pastebinit
2011-09-28T23:01:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	mount  #See if it mounted now.
2011-09-28T23:02:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	mount |pastebinit  #Send resulting URL and we'll have a look.
2011-09-28T23:05:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	I see that you have  /dev/sda1 & /dev/sdf1 & /dev/sdf2  mounted.  What I do not see, are any Linux partitions. Are you booting to a LiveCD?  Or what? And what exactly are you wanting to do with this system?  (What is your end goal?)
2011-09-28T23:06:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	Yea, I like it too.
2011-09-28T23:06:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	So it is wubi?
2011-09-28T23:07:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	If you have a wubi install, I am not the one to help you.  I know little if anything about wubi.
2011-09-28T23:08:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	Yes (IMHO)
2011-12-15T23:46:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	What is your hardware?
2011-12-15T23:47:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	Do you get any response at all from mouse or keyboard?
2011-12-15T23:48:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	Ctrl-ALt-F6  #What does that do for you?
2011-12-15T23:49:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	Ok, no reponse from mouse or keyboard.
2011-12-15T23:51:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	You might try a memtest
2011-12-15T23:55:00.000Z	usr13	jexmex	Why?
