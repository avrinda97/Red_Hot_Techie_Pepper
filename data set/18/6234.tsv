2008-07-02T20:12:00.000Z	Bogaurd		does anybody use mdadm with raid1 on the system drive?
2008-07-02T20:13:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	I do
2008-06-30T20:19:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	Be careful
2008-06-30T20:20:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	Ubuntu loves to not boot from degraded arrays
2008-06-30T20:20:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	yeah, I've run into that a bunch of times now :(
2008-07-02T19:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	That's one thing I realllly wish Ubuntu would fix. Ubuntu absolutely hates booting from a degraded array. What's the point of having a RAID-1 if Ubuntu won't  boot from it easily without having to fiddle with stuff
2008-07-02T20:15:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	I just did an apt-get upgrade (kernel was upgraded)... got the system booting OK now, but it's complaining that it's not finding any of the devices listed in mdadm.conf. Also, on boot I used to get lots of verbose output telling me which arrays were assembled with which drives etc, but thats gone now... any ideas?
2008-07-02T20:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	Everytime I upgrade my kernel I get dumped to a busy box prompt on the next boot and I have to essentially reassemble the raid
2008-07-02T20:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	either mdadm --assemble --scan or mdadm --add (I forget the syntax)
2008-07-02T20:16:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	hrmm. i just edited the menu.lst and was ready to go.. the arrays seem to assemble just fine, but it complains that it cant fine what's specified in the conf
2008-07-02T20:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	So cat /proc/mdstat says everything is working fine?
2008-07-02T20:17:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	yeah, it does
2008-07-02T20:18:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	You could always just edit mdadm.conf ;)
2008-07-02T20:18:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	I did... it's correct :S
2008-07-02T20:29:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	do you have a "/etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/mdadm" file?
2008-07-02T20:32:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	one sec
2008-07-02T20:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Bogaurd	No, I don't, I have the directory, but it's empty
2008-07-02T20:33:00.000Z	Bogaurd	ASULutzy	me too. guess that's normal then :P
