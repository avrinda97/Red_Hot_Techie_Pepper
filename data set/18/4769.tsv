2009-02-20T06:10:00.000Z	Ryan_Chau		hi, I updated ubuntu and I have a small problem I was wondering if anyone could help me
2009-02-20T06:10:00.000Z	Ryan_Chau		i bought a pc it came with the ubuntu 8.04 version and everythign was fine, so I updated it to the latlest version, but while i was updating a few screen came up and i didn't read it, it said something about replacing files
2009-02-20T06:11:00.000Z	Ryan_Chau		i let the files replace each other, and when it restarted i was having problem with the drivers
2009-02-20T06:11:00.000Z	Ryan_Chau		i think the network card driver is corrupted, i was wondering if i could get that somewhere
2009-02-20T06:11:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Ryan_Chau	more than likely your system defaulted to the open source drivers, you may need to enable restricted drivers
2009-02-20T06:13:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Ryan_Chau	system/administration/hardware drivers
2009-02-20T06:15:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Ryan_Chau	the driver for your wifi card is probably still there, just not enabled because it is proprietary
2009-02-20T06:38:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Ryan_Chau	you still there? Troubleshooting wifi problems in IRC can get complicated at times, check out this link and post back with details if your still having problems --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide

2009-02-20T06:56:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Ryan_Chau	are you trying to enable a wireless or wired connection. By the way, how are you connected right now
2009-02-20T06:57:00.000Z	Ryan_Chau	exodus_ms	i am trying to enable a wired connection, i'm on another wired connection right now on my pc
