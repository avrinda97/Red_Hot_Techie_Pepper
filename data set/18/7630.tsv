2008-01-28T16:54:00.000Z	white_eagle		can you control ubuntu via windows with remote control?
2008-01-28T16:54:00.000Z	white_eagle		!remote control
2008-01-28T16:54:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	yes, you'll need a vnc viewer
2008-08-31T21:55:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	that seems to be overkill
2008-08-31T21:56:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	?
2008-08-31T21:56:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	installing all jasper packages
2008-08-31T21:56:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	all packages that contain jasper libjasper-dev libjasper1 libjasper-runtime
2008-08-31T21:56:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	that's an overkill?
2008-08-31T21:57:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	right, and you don't need the -dev packages unless you are building something that relies on the jasper headers
2008-08-31T21:58:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	and installing jasper should bring in the dependencies it needs
2008-08-31T21:58:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	ok, he fixed the problem, what's the fuss? :)
2008-08-31T21:59:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	silly way to get it working
2008-08-31T22:35:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	he wants to have a root shell
2008-08-31T22:35:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	newton, use sudo instead
2008-08-31T22:35:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	newton .   sudo -i
2008-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	unop	white_eagle	the root account is not enabled on ubuntu, so su will always fail
2008-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	oh, I enabled it i forgot
2008-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	white_eagle	unop	sorry
