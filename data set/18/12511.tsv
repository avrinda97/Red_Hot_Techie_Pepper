2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	cin		Hey, I'm currently logged in recovery mode. I tried upgrading to dapper and a lot of things went terribly wrong. Is there a way to get to the Ubuntu installation program without the CD?
2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	cin		:\
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	cin		>.>
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	cin		Yeah, any suggestions would be appreciated.
2006-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	cin		As much as commandline rocks for personal computing.
2006-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	cin		I really would search Google instead of asking for abuse in here, but, it's not the easiest thing to search for.
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	cin	what's the problem?
2006-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	I attempted an upgrade with apt-get and rebooted to find that my startup crashes, and a lot of programs are missing. I don't know enough to fix this myself. So I was wondering if there is a way to get to the Ubuntu installation disk to "reset" all the settings or something.
2006-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	cin	are you on breezy?
2006-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	yeah.
2006-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	cin	what programs are missing?
2006-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	probably... I don't expect the dapper upgrade went too well.
2006-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	vi.
2006-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	essential things like that.
2006-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	cin	so you are on dapper ;)
2006-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	Dapper doesn't have vi?/
2006-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	cin	#ubuntu+1
2006-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	cin	apokryphos	righto, thanks.
