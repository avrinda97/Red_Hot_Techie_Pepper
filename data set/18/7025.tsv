2008-02-16T19:13:00.000Z	harmattan		Hi. Anyone having tried Ubuntu on old PIIIs?
2008-02-16T19:14:00.000Z	harmattan		1 GHZ and 394 MB
2008-02-16T19:15:00.000Z	harmattan		I was wondering if the last edition would be too bloated for that machine
2008-02-16T19:16:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	you better run xubuntu (xfce desktop) or fluxbox on that
2008-02-16T19:17:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	xubuntu comes with minimal gnome services by default
2008-02-16T19:18:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	it has some gnome libs, but most of the gui apps are gtk2 only
2008-02-16T19:20:00.000Z	harmattan	bla3435	I recently read something about xfce not being so light in modern versions...
2008-02-16T19:21:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	that's why i use xfce with fluxbox windowmanager
2008-02-16T19:21:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	i installed normal xubuntu, then added fluxbox and run a fluxbox session from gdm login
2008-02-16T19:21:00.000Z	harmattan	bla3435	Is it difficult to change?
2008-02-16T19:22:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	no. gdm lets you choose which session to start when logging in
2008-02-16T19:22:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	you just have to install fluxbox after installing normal xubuntu    (sudo apt-get install fluxbox)
2008-02-16T19:23:00.000Z	harmattan	bla3435	oooh! I see. So it is simply like choosing in the login window one or another
2008-02-16T19:24:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	yes
2008-02-16T19:25:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	configuring fluxbox is of course not that much gui-ish than xfce
2008-02-16T19:25:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	some fluxbox settings can be changed by gui, some only in the fluxbox config files
2008-02-16T19:26:00.000Z	harmattan	bla3435	I'll look for an old podcast from Linux Reality. I think they have some tutorial or something about that
2008-02-16T19:33:00.000Z	bla3435	harmattan	alright :)
