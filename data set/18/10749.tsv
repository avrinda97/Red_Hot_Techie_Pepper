2006-10-28T09:26:00.000Z	VigilantGambit		I get the following error when trying to play N: ./n_v14: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-10-28T09:27:00.000Z	VigilantGambit		the game can be found here if anyone would like to try to figure out my problem: http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n_v1linux.tar.gz
2006-10-28T09:27:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	what problem are you having with it?
2006-10-28T09:28:00.000Z	VigilantGambit	bruenig	it's an executable
2006-10-28T09:28:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	open a terminal and cd into the directory and do ./whatever
2006-10-28T09:37:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	to run that game, you need to install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 "sudo apt-get install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2"
2006-10-28T09:39:00.000Z	VigilantGambit	bruenig	I'll try that, thanks
2006-10-28T09:51:00.000Z	VigilantGambit	bruenig	when I start the game, it says hit spacebar to begin
2006-10-28T09:51:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	try shift
2006-10-28T09:52:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	did you go into the controls?
2006-10-28T09:52:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	go into the controls and try to see what is up. I deleted it after I found the dependency
2006-10-28T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	I just tried the game. You use space to start the level. The arrows to move and shift to jump.
2006-10-28T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	also a little trick. Play music while you are starting it so that it doesn't lag
2006-10-28T09:56:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	are you sure? mine uses macromedia flash player 6. I tried to use the flash 9 standalone but it only wants flash movies for whatever reason
2006-10-28T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	ok so it should be good to go
2006-10-28T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	I have 9 beta installed, both the standalone and the plugin and it works fine
2006-10-28T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	start the game over and go into the configure
2006-10-28T10:01:00.000Z	bruenig	VigilantGambit	works fine here. I don't know what is wrong with yours.
