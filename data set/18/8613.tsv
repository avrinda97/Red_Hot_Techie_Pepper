2007-07-24T16:32:00.000Z	MonsieurBL		hi there, i'm tring to find a reason why i would get this : "error while loading shared libraries: libgc.so.1", even if libgc is in /usr/lib/ ?
2007-07-24T16:33:00.000Z	MonsieurBL		even after running ldconfig, i still get "error while loading shared libraries: libgc.so.1"
2007-07-24T16:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	that's pretty horrible
2007-07-24T16:35:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	you bet :)
2007-07-24T16:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	so how did you break it?
2007-07-24T16:37:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	well i just didn't, the lib's here, everything works fine, except when i'm tring to compile under Eclipse, i can't and get this error, it sucks
2007-07-24T16:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	locate libgc.so
2007-07-24T16:39:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	locate libgc.so -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31054/plain/
2007-07-24T16:40:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	so and so.1 are links to so.1.0.2
2007-07-24T16:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	perms are 644 ?
2007-07-24T16:43:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	yup :-|
2007-07-24T16:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	file /usr/lib/libgc*
2007-07-24T16:46:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31055/plain/
2007-07-24T05:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	is it possible the file's corrupt?
2007-07-24T05:08:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	well i get a GTK warning now and then, so this could be right. Do you know a way to safely reinstall libgc&co?
2007-07-24T05:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MonsieurBL	sudo apt-get --reinstall libgc1c2    should do it
2007-07-24T05:23:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	nope it didn't change anyth. This sucks so much...
2007-07-24T05:24:00.000Z	MonsieurBL	Frogzoo	anyway thanks for your help
