2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	stinkyfoot		sorry
2007-10-03T12:43:00.000Z	nickrud	stinkyfoot	maybe a silly question, but did you make texmaker... executable?
2007-12-20T02:45:00.000Z	nickrud	stinkyfoot	the newest X is supposed to, not the one in ubuntu. those commands given, the ones with -phigh (or replace with -pcritical) will autoconfig
2007-12-20T02:45:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	nickrud	i ran the first one, without phigh, and it didn't autoconfigure
2007-12-20T02:45:00.000Z	nickrud	stinkyfoot	true
2007-12-20T02:46:00.000Z	nickrud	stinkyfoot	if you hit enter on every suggested option there, you will end up with what -pcritical would give you. not including the option lets you review or change to taste
2007-12-20T02:47:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	nickrud	this might sound stupid but it tells me video card is in pci.1.0.0 is that the agp slot?
2007-12-20T02:48:00.000Z	nickrud	stinkyfoot	see wols
2007-12-20T02:48:00.000Z	nickrud	stinkyfoot	doesn't need to, X will determing that at run time
