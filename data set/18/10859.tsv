2007-05-17T11:01:00.000Z	rimey57		I need help
2007-05-17T11:02:00.000Z	rimey57		is there anyone here that can help me?
2007-05-17T11:02:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	don't ask to ask.
2007-05-17T11:04:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	it couldn't probably load the graphics driver...
2007-05-17T11:05:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	just curious which graphics adapter are you using? know that?
2007-05-17T11:05:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	using a notebook=
2007-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	if the live cd has problem it might be difficult to fix. it reads as it wouldn't be able to load a module for the graphics adapter
2007-05-17T11:09:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	sounds like a missing module? notebooks can be quite painful...
2007-05-17T11:12:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	no... i'm not saying that this is the error... it's just that this is one possibility
2007-05-17T11:13:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	it's hard to analyse without concrete logs or something
2007-05-17T11:15:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	well it's unlikely that the module is missing... can't read about problems...
2007-05-17T11:16:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	which version do you try to install again?
2007-05-17T11:16:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	32bit i guess?
2007-05-17T11:23:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	it _can_ be that your notebook troubles. I doubt that it's the graphics adapter - i have not read any problems dealing with this graphics cards, so...
2007-05-17T11:26:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	you could use the alternative (text) installer and when you got the base system you could try to solve the error
2007-05-17T11:27:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	but when you say you are new to all this, this will be a little longer way to go...
2007-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	PepperBob	rimey57	np. i suggest read every step carefully. won't be to tough. at least you should be able to boot the base system.
