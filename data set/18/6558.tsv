2008-11-21T05:02:00.000Z	EvilAIM		I installed Ubuntu, and it says my xorg isn't configured right...
2008-11-21T05:02:00.000Z	EvilAIM		weird
2008-11-21T05:02:00.000Z	EvilAIM		something about no screen?

2008-11-21T05:03:00.000Z	EvilAIM		can't I just run that xorg config thingy?
2008-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	EvilAIM		looks like it's an issue with something called 'wacome'?
2008-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	EvilAIM		Wacom
2008-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	EvilAIM		no driver found...
2008-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	you can try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ... would help if you could give a little more details than "says it isn't configured right, something about screens"  :/
2008-11-21T05:06:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	that shouldn't cause X to not work.
2008-11-21T05:06:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	is your box a tablet pc?
2008-11-21T05:07:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	cool ... 'cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE ... paste entire output to paste.ubuntu.com
2008-11-21T05:09:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	sudo aptitude install pastebinit && cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | pastebinit
2008-11-21T05:09:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	tell me the output... it should be a url
2008-11-21T05:13:00.000Z	fde	EvilAIM	did you ever do what I asked?
2008-11-21T05:13:00.000Z	EvilAIM	fde	I'm going to install 8.04 and see if that helps, but if it doesn't I'll do what you ask:)
