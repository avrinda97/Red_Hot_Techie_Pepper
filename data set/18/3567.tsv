2009-09-12T16:26:00.000Z	Smooch1502		whats mode #ubuntu +e by floodbot1
2009-09-12T16:28:00.000Z	Smooch1502		is it possible to install ubuntu server along side ubuntu desktop + windows xp? as a dualboot
2009-09-12T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	Smooch1502	possible yes, but probably also pointless.  Just install the server applications on your desktop ubuntu
2009-09-12T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	Smooch1502	did you see what I said before about there not being much point in having both desktop and server?  Why *exactly* do you want both installed?
2009-09-12T16:32:00.000Z	Smooch1502	jrib	i want the desktop so i can still browse the web etc using gnome but i also want ubuntu server as a dual boot becoz having a server with ubuntu desktop uses to much ram
2009-09-12T16:33:00.000Z	Smooch1502	jrib	and i dont have another spare computer to have ubuntu server on
2009-09-12T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	Smooch1502	but what's the point of a server that's almost never on... If you actually want to do this, it is trivial: just put in the disk and install the server on a new partition.  But I don't see the point.  Just disable gdm by default and any other services that bother you on the desktop
2009-09-12T16:34:00.000Z	Smooch1502	jrib	correct but i still want it dual boot with desktop and server
2009-09-12T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	Smooch1502	fine, then just install it to a new partition
2009-09-12T16:35:00.000Z	Smooch1502	jrib	ok thanks for your help
2009-09-12T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	Smooch1502	if you use the grub from the last install it should automatically detect the other ubuntu install.  If not, just look up grub chainloading
2009-09-12T16:36:00.000Z	Smooch1502	jrib	ok
