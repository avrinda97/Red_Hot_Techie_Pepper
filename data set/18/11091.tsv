2006-09-15T13:58:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	then, short of hacking, which probably no one in here knows how to do, you're hosed
2006-09-15T13:59:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	Gaining access to a system you're not supposed to have access to == hacking
2006-09-15T14:00:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	Then you want to log into it.
2006-09-15T14:01:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	Why don't you just SCP it to your home folder, THEN login and sudo it into the root?
2006-09-15T14:01:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	Oh.  Well for god's sakes, why didn't you say that in the first place?
2006-09-15T14:01:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	Go to #bash or ##linux and ask there.
2006-09-15T14:02:00.000Z	Tonren	appelza	A little patience goes a long, long way.
2006-09-15T14:04:00.000Z	appelza	Tonren	I dont mind waiting for an answer, but scroll and read.  I was getting the wrong answers, then I tell them thats not what I'm looking for and they don't listen. :)
