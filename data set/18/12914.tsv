2006-02-25T09:26:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	you install build-essential and add whatever else you need.
2006-02-25T09:27:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	how so I get access to this build-essential .. just su root and apt-get it ?
2006-02-25T09:28:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2006-02-25T09:29:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	intelikey : I don't have to su, the first thing I did was activate root (for a reason) ...
2006-02-25T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	don't be polemic for argument's sake. We assume you're intelligent enough to ignore the sudo part if you know what you're doing.
2006-02-25T09:31:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	fair enough ;)
2006-02-25T09:33:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	have to say, this might be the perfect linux for my wife, its very easy to use/install, and I love the ability to add limited access users quickly
2006-02-25T09:35:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	I'm searching for some updated FireFox, xfce4, and so on. Know of any good package archives ?
2006-02-25T09:37:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	are you tracking Dapper (6.04), or did you install Breezy (5.10)? Newer versions aren't in 5.10.
2006-02-25T09:37:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	Oh... I'm Breezy right now, only base install CD I saw at the time
2006-02-25T09:38:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	done slack, fbsd, gentoo, and a bit of debian over the years.. The Gui stuff is very new to me though :)
2006-02-25T09:39:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	is Dapper devel, or stable ?
2006-03-28T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	no, that's correct.
2006-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	I remember when I thought it was bloated breaking 10/15Meg
2006-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	they had better start packaging some pics & vids with it !
2006-03-28T07:02:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	heh.
2006-03-28T07:03:00.000Z	ipfw	crimsun	for 40 meg it should be able to make my coffee, give me sex, and do the dishes --- I mean, thats almost the size of the EMACS OS (text editor) :P
2006-03-28T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	ipfw	no
