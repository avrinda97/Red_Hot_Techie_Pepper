2005-02-27T12:00:00.000Z	mpq		xbox doesn't play the sims 2
2005-02-27T12:00:00.000Z	mpq		and I already have one
2005-02-27T12:01:00.000Z	mpq		if I can figure out how to run the sims 2 in wine, I wouldn't need windows
2005-02-27T12:01:00.000Z	mpq		but I don't think I can
2005-02-27T12:01:00.000Z	mpq		for that matter, I can't even access the windows partition
2005-02-27T12:02:00.000Z	mpq		so I don't think I can run it
2005-02-27T12:02:00.000Z	mpq		it tells me I don't have permission to access the partition
2005-02-27T12:03:00.000Z	mpq		because it will be running off the cd
2005-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	mpq		is it possible to access ntfs partitions outside of windows?
2005-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	mpq		because I don't think it is
2005-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	diego	mpq	yes
2005-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	diego	mpq	do something like `mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/point/
2005-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	diego	mpq	oh...
2005-02-27T12:05:00.000Z	diego	mpq	yeah, if you want stable read&write support between win&lin, i think fat is the way to go
2005-02-27T12:06:00.000Z	diego	mpq	no..windows comes with an ntfs->fat32 conversion utility i think
2005-02-27T12:07:00.000Z	diego	mpq	deal?
2005-02-27T12:21:00.000Z	diego	mpq	use this one then http://www.authentica.com/index_files/products/white_papers/prwp_11_final.pdf (from google)
2005-02-27T12:22:00.000Z	diego	mpq	no web-based e-mail account?
