2008-12-23T09:17:00.000Z	NEWK		I'm a bit of a Linux newb, but I don't know. Are there any programs that work only with one window manager?
2008-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	NEWK		ok
2008-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	NEWK		What about programs that come packaged with a certain window manager
2008-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	NEWK		like the GNOME games
2008-12-23T09:18:00.000Z	Org-Mode	NEWK	most of the popular window managers should be ok with that
