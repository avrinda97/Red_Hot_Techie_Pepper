2011-01-27T23:31:00.000Z	badpenguin86		I removed plymouth because it looked bad, but now I want to fix how bad it looks, how do I get it to start working again
2011-01-27T23:31:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	in ubuntu?
2011-01-27T23:31:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	Yes
2011-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	plymouth in ubuntu will break half the system if removed..how did you do it?
2011-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	Well, I removed the theme package, which basically made it boot in verbose
2011-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	oh..thats it..i though you removed plymouth..
2011-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	then install the theme..
2011-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	Tried that, didn't work
2011-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	I don't know if I have tried dpkg-reconfigure plymouth. think that would work?
2011-01-27T23:36:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	i think that package is called plymouth-theme-logo..not sure..check synaptic
2011-01-27T23:37:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	Gonna reboot and see if that fixed it
2011-01-27T23:39:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	no such luck.. still verbose
2011-01-27T23:39:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	after installing the theme..you have to do a couple of things
2011-01-27T23:39:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	o, yeah?
2011-01-27T23:40:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth
2011-01-27T23:40:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	then select the proper theme..
2011-01-27T23:40:00.000Z	bonjoyee	badpenguin86	and then sudo update-initramfs -u
2011-01-27T23:41:00.000Z	badpenguin86	bonjoyee	k, gonna try again
