2009-07-23T13:07:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	Thank you:) but I mean the options found in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file by default. I'm going to guess and say Ubuntu, Ubuntu recovery, and memtest?
2009-07-23T13:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	as well as a few other lines, yes
2009-07-23T13:08:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	Okay :) What lines might that be? Do you mean like when new kernels are installed
2009-07-23T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	i can show you mine, its marginally tweaked but will get you started

2009-07-23T13:12:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	Okay thank you. :) Youve been helpful. I was just curious because I am recommending Ubuntu NR to and I think GRUB is kinda unsightly :P I will set 'default 0', 'timeout 0' and 'hiddenmenu' :)
2010-07-12T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	there is usb-creator-gtk as part of a default install
2011-06-10T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	did you MD5 test the ISO you used?
2011-06-10T10:33:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	No, I'll try now, where can I get the md5s?
2011-06-10T10:33:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	THanks
2011-06-10T10:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	please MD% FIRST in future
2011-06-10T10:35:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	The hashes do* match
2011-06-10T10:35:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	Should I try unetbootin?
2011-06-10T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	if the ISO is good then yes
2011-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	unetbootin doesn't support 11.04, so I'm not sure if it will work
2011-10-16T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eboyjr	i believe if you run:  sudo modprobe pcspkr    it will beep
2011-10-16T13:40:00.000Z	eboyjr	ActionParsnip	Instead I want to use the sound from my sound settings like "Glass" | Sonar | Bark | Default
