2005-02-10T13:16:00.000Z	apokryphos		When partitioning, I get the error "There are uncorrected errors... if you continue this partition will not be used". Not really that helpful... have no idea of the errors it's talking about. Any idea on what I could do?

2005-02-10T13:17:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	did you specifc a file system?
2005-02-10T13:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	Yup; ext3
2005-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	dunno, I always just used the bin from sun's site
2005-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	Alrighty; will do. Just a shame that the repositories there are included...
2005-02-16T17:00:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	why are you using rpms?
2005-02-16T17:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	to install, naturally ;)
2005-02-16T17:01:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	install what?
2005-02-16T17:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	I noticed. That's what I did first; don't know what to do with the .deb (I'm new to Debian systems).
2005-02-16T17:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	This time j2re (I already had the RPM in a folder), but I'm sure there's other stuff I'll need to install
2005-02-23T06:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	isn't that a good thing? ;)
2005-02-23T07:00:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	I'm referring to gentoo though with that comment...compiling qt took forever :/
2005-02-23T07:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	Ah, right. I'm sure it would. ;)
2005-04-10T13:59:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	and it acheieves that goal well :)
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	are you using konversation? ;-)
2005-04-11T14:45:00.000Z	randabis	apokryphos	yeah :p I need to switch it to plain-text I suppose
2005-04-11T14:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	randabis	when texting more than one line you can get a preview of how it will come out, if you like...
