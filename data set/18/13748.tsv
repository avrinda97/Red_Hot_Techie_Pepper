2005-10-28T16:20:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	caaallm. ;)
2006-01-09T15:34:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	running with the pid of the root user from /etc/passwd?
2006-01-09T15:34:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	I'd say that fairly well qualifies you as running everything as root :P
2006-01-09T15:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	i dont do anything as "root" unless i have to
2006-01-09T15:35:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	right. Sorry, I misread what you said in context to infer that you ran everything using sudo :P
2006-04-18T14:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	yes there is
2006-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	because it isn't a dapper-specific issue, properly
2006-05-26T14:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	by the release it will be open for more
2006-05-26T14:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	they will be opening up for more soon
2006-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	ah, they're tiering the number people can order?
2006-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	they havent added it yet
2006-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	shipit lets me order 6.06 CDs
2006-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	I can just only order 10
2006-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	not more than 10
2006-05-26T14:40:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	right.. so they are tiering 6.06 submissions and they'll allow >10 in a while?
2006-05-26T14:40:00.000Z	njan	gnomefreak	cool. What's the reason for the tiering, to get CDs out to a larger number of people initially?
2006-05-26T14:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	njan	as far as i know they just havent added it to site yet maybe they dont know how many people will be making them
