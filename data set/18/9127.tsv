2007-05-30T12:01:00.000Z	chris-a		you still wating for a question
2007-05-30T12:02:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i kinda suck, what can i help you with?
2007-05-30T12:04:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	O.o.. well, thats certainly out of my jurisdiction.. somehow there was a syntax error though, what is this for?
2007-05-30T12:09:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i wish i had a printer, havent worked with one yet XD.. i dont think i can help you much, but check your syntax, cause it sounds like its looking for cups, and not the cupswrapper package youre working with, might be a space somewere
2007-05-30T12:09:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	other than that, someone else here might know for sure whats going on
2007-05-30T12:10:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	of course, i use it full time too, and run games
2007-05-30T12:11:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i see, it shouldnt be that hard to add a printer to ubuntu, it seems to be strong with additional applications
2007-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	first linux distro
2007-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	first its at like 10.x or something now, but its fast, reliable, and simple
2007-05-30T12:15:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i didnt really have trouble with windows, i just like new ideas
2007-05-30T12:16:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	the biggest reason is free software, and the fact that noone can break my pc like in linux
2007-05-30T12:17:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	XD
2007-05-30T12:17:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i watched vista softcrash closing a window
2007-05-30T12:18:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i decided if i was going to have a headache, i wasnt going to pay 90$ for it
2007-05-30T12:20:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	eh, i doubt your problem is reboot worthy :P only some packages require rebooting
2007-05-30T12:21:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	i see.. thats someone elses bag there >.> im using Fawn.. lol
2007-05-30T12:22:00.000Z	HKJGN	chris-a	kk
