2010-09-28T17:32:00.000Z	yudi1		 i am running xp as guest in ubuntu, do I need to install antivirus and firewall to secure it?
2010-09-28T17:32:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	xp professional?
2010-09-28T17:33:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	if it's professional then skip antivirus and enable SRP instead
2010-09-28T17:34:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	also you may leave ddefault firewall enabled
2010-09-28T17:35:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	and obviously use limited account
2010-09-28T17:35:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	yes xp professional, What is SRP?
2010-09-28T17:35:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	software restriction policy
2010-09-28T17:37:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	i use clam av and ufw, and I am no sure how XP connects to internet - using virutalbox though
2010-09-28T17:37:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	which is IP in XP machine?
2010-09-28T17:40:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	ip for xp is 10.x.x.x
2010-09-28T17:41:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	then you need no firewall
2010-09-28T17:41:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	ok
2010-09-28T17:41:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	if you need no FTP connection, you may stop firewall service
2010-09-28T17:44:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	i only use XP for just couple of programs, one of them is a tax program, thats why I need XP to be very secure.
2010-09-28T17:44:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	it will be very secure if you'll install updates and configure software restrictions
2010-09-28T17:47:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	where do I find the SRP options in XP
2010-09-28T17:48:00.000Z	st__	yudi1	Control Pane, Administration, Local Security Policies
2010-09-28T18:01:00.000Z	yudi1	st__	looked at local security policies, looks like I need to read up before I play with it, thanks for letting me know.
