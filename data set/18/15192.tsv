2005-11-10T17:52:00.000Z	Mabus		I set up ethernet properly on this comp (it wouldnt work for windows), so now the wireless card is in my XP machine
2005-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	Mabus		mplayer, Ratzilla
2005-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	Mabus		uh
2005-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	Mabus		When, smi|e ?
2005-11-10T17:54:00.000Z	Mabus		Maybe a few weeks ago, smi|e.
2005-11-10T17:54:00.000Z	Mabus		But not recently. :)
2005-11-10T17:54:00.000Z	Mabus		Be more specific, ventito
2005-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	Mabus		Something bad, Alex[RM-UK] 
2005-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	Mabus		Alex[RM-UK] , I have never installed kubuntu, I was just stating the obvious
2005-11-10T06:56:00.000Z	Mabus		how do I get .rm files to play in totem-xine?
2005-11-10T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Mabus	I just went thru that last night :)
2005-11-10T06:57:00.000Z	Mabus	nickrud	so you have advice for me then?
2005-11-10T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Mabus	first question: do you have w32codecs?
2005-11-10T06:58:00.000Z	Mabus		i don't know... i can play mpegs and avis and whatnot
2005-11-10T06:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Mabus	look in .gnome2/totem-addons; you need a bunch of links to dll's and .so's in there. the .so's are for real media
2005-11-10T07:00:00.000Z	Mabus	nickrud	I searched synaptic and found w32codecs... it wasn't installed so I'm installing it
2005-11-10T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Mabus	totem-xine will populate totem-addons for you when you run it, and you should be good to go
2005-11-10T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Mabus	however, I had some other issues, so if you have problems, ping me.
