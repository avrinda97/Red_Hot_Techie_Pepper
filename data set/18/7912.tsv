2007-10-27T09:35:00.000Z	Pownties		So would Xubuntu be worth a shot on my computer?  Or would I be wasting time with it also ?
2007-10-27T09:37:00.000Z	Pownties		Ubuntu , Kubuntu just pissed me off , I never liked KDE.
2007-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	Pownties		OK, I will give Xubuntu a shot then.
2007-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pownties	Are you looking for a lightweight distro?
2007-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	Pownties	Jordan_U_	 I am looking for a "works, but doesn't grab ass"
2007-10-27T09:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pownties	Might try Fedora, it's a little annoying enabling restricted things like mp3 becase they are stricter about non-free components
2007-10-27T09:41:00.000Z	Pownties	Jordan_U_	I want something that I install, and I don't have to shoot people to get things to work.  That's why I came to see about Ubuntu in the first place.

2007-10-27T09:46:00.000Z	Pownties	Jordan_U_	Fluxubuntu's download says it's only in RC
2007-10-27T09:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pownties	You don't need to re-install
2007-10-27T09:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pownties	Just update to the final
