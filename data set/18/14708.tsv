2005-06-24T11:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	i glanced through the install manual and i have a feeling it was hastily adapted from the debian manual -- i'm not sure all of it is valid
2005-06-24T11:45:00.000Z	mencial	HappyFool	I figured. So what would be the way to install without a CD-ROM drive?
2005-06-24T11:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	i don't think it's possible, sorry :-( -- I'm not too sure though
2005-06-24T11:47:00.000Z	mencial	HappyFool	Would using a Debian-installer kernel work with an Ubuntu ISO? Riskyyyy... But I am desperate.
2005-06-24T11:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	i don't know
2005-06-24T11:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	what do you have to lose?
2005-06-24T11:48:00.000Z	mencial	HappyFool	Besides 10GB of data, including my (finished) thesis? Nothing...
2005-06-24T11:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	then maybe you should backup first ;)
2005-06-24T11:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	i would backup even if using a conventional install method
2005-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	the install manual has this for usb: 'gzip -dc boot.img.gz >/dev/sda'
2005-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	however, i couldn't find such a file on the install cd, hence my suspicion that this (and similar) was a debian instruction
2005-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	mencial	HappyFool	Where is that install manual?
2005-06-24T12:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	on the (hoary) install cd -- i see you referenced warty earlier

2005-06-24T12:10:00.000Z	mencial	HappyFool	boot.img.gz would be a gzipped floppy image. There is one in a bootable CD; I should be able to extract it. But I think that dd'ing the whole .iso would have the same effect (making the usb hd bootable)
2005-06-24T12:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	i am not familiar with this
2005-06-24T12:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	mencial	googling for 'boot.img.gz site:archive.ubuntu.com' reveals no hits
