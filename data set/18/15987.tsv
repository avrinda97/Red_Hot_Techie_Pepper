2005-02-17T08:37:00.000Z	Orcrist		but DONT install them all, even if you want to download them locally
2005-02-17T08:39:00.000Z	Orcrist		it's lighter than the adobe version
2005-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	Orcrist		wait
2005-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	Orcrist		actually you want gpdf
2005-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	Orcrist		sorry
2005-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	Orcrist		xpdf is the ugly athena-looking one
2005-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	Orcrist		well, it's ugly on my desktop... but opinions are subjective
2005-02-17T08:42:00.000Z	Orcrist		have you used gpdf smeggy?   it's xpdf minus ugliness

2005-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	dude, see /topic.
2005-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	Orcrist	daniels	?
2005-02-17T08:45:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	ah, it's gone.  the /topic used to contain words to the effect of 'bashing ati or nvidia is offtopic here'
2005-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	er, you do know ubuntu has a 'custom' option (now named 'server' for hoary) that allows you to totally customise your install in terms of which packages you use, right?
2005-02-24T13:55:00.000Z	Orcrist	daniels	yes.. I've installed it that way recently in fact... gave me a really tiny base install that I used to build a custom setup
2005-02-24T13:55:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	ahr, cool
2005-02-24T13:56:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	well, if that's what you enjoy, then more power to you, but i don't want to have to pick up the phone and explain to my mum what a window manager is when she's installing ubuntu :)
2005-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	mmm, interesting, but if you know enough to be picking which window manager you want to install and that you absolutely don't want to install gnome, you probably know how to install from a base system
