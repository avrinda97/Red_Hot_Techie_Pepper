2011-06-14T16:47:00.000Z	RenaKunisaki		here's an interesting thought: what if in an almost-out-of-memory condition, Ubuntu would pop up a notification balloon asking if you want to create/enlarge your swapfile?
2011-06-14T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	it wouldn't
2011-06-14T16:47:00.000Z	RenaKunisaki	ikonia	I know, I'm suggesting it :p
2011-06-14T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	we don't control gnome development in here,
2011-06-14T16:48:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	besides if you are at that level where you are swapping out to disk, your machine will be at such a slow pace, you'll know your machine is out of ram
2011-06-14T16:49:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	your machine will be on it's knees, doing a partition resize would not be wise
2011-06-14T16:49:00.000Z	RenaKunisaki	ikonia	you don't need to mess with partitions, just create a big empty file and mark it as swap
2011-06-14T16:49:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	if you are at that level where you have no ram left, you won't need a bubble to advise you, you have no ram left
2011-06-14T16:50:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	you're already swapping to disk - the effort in creating another swap file would not be helpful
2011-06-14T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	think it through if it was a good idea....it would be in place by now
2011-06-14T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	swapping out userspace ram is different
2011-06-14T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	as if your machine is at a level where you have no ram left and you are swapping to disk already, the function of creating a swap file would add more load and not change the problem, the problem would be you don't have enough ram to do what you want
2011-06-14T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	a swap file is not a ram replacment
2011-06-14T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	either way, we don't control gnome development here, if you think it's a good idea, stick it on brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2011-06-14T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	I'm certain he does, I don't think you do
2011-06-14T16:55:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	you've thrown an idea out, and don't like that people don't think your idea will work
2011-06-14T16:56:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	if you think your idea is good, stick in on brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2011-06-14T16:56:00.000Z	ikonia	RenaKunisaki	lets drop it now, you don't want to hear it, so put it on brainstorm.ubuntu.com if you think it's a good idea
