2005-08-02T09:58:00.000Z	michael__	dabaR	I want it minimized, but not to show up in the panel...
2005-08-02T09:59:00.000Z	michael__	dabaR	like gaim...
2005-08-02T09:59:00.000Z	dabaR	michael__	gaim shows up in the panel.
2005-08-02T10:00:00.000Z	michael__	dabaR	gaim is only visible in the notification area on my desktop...
2005-08-02T10:01:00.000Z	dabaR	michael__	screenshots?

2005-10-29T05:43:00.000Z	dabaR	michael__	its pretty cool actually, to learn about applications vs system software, and os vs utilities, and shell vs kernel
