2008-08-10T22:17:00.000Z	droopsta915		im learning
2008-08-10T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	what's up, what's the problem ?
2008-11-15T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	depends on your needs and wants
2008-11-15T23:24:00.000Z	droopsta915	ikonia	I use it for pictures, music, internet.
2008-11-15T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	8.04 will be supported for longer
2008-11-24T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	any text editor of your choice
2008-11-26T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	I would advise against ubuntu tweak
2008-11-26T22:09:00.000Z	droopsta915	ikonia	what can I do to improve speed? I don't know why its so slow, it was fine yesterday.
2008-11-26T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	look at whats changed, the most obvious would be your ISP
2008-11-26T22:11:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	yes but they may be performing bad
2008-11-26T22:11:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	have a problem, be busy, etc etc
2008-11-26T22:12:00.000Z	droopsta915	ikonia	you're saying it might get better on its own if it is the isp?
2008-11-26T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	thats a good possability
2008-11-26T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	droopsta915	if nothing else has changed and it's going slow - that is an obvious strong candidate
2008-11-26T22:13:00.000Z	droopsta915	ikonia	does ubuntu have any backup software that is good?
