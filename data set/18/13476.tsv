2006-03-09T10:04:00.000Z	oskude		*knew
2006-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	they're firewall exploits
2006-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	most routers have inbuilt firewalls
2006-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	well, mostly they are just NATs......
2006-03-09T10:07:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	aye, but NATs can still be exploited, i'm sure
2006-03-09T10:07:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	now i KNOW :)
2006-03-09T10:08:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	i think, but not sure, alot of the newer netgear routers have a NAT and some other firewall as well
2006-07-25T10:44:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	links2 ? ;)
2006-07-25T10:45:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	wouldnt know, does it render images?
2006-07-25T10:45:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	hmm, dunno. gotta test
2006-07-25T10:45:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	damn, cant install links2 as de.archive... has problems :/
2006-07-25T10:46:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	well, dillo is the default browser in Damn Small Linux, so i guess it's fairly decent and light
2006-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	yup, its very light, but links2 is more lighter, but dunno about usability...
2006-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	links2 (with -g) does show images
2006-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	elkbuntu	oskude	cool
2006-07-25T10:54:00.000Z	oskude	elkbuntu	but dillo is more userfriendly, so please keep on recommeding that :)
