2007-07-16T08:05:00.000Z	daan		eum I just removed all the groups from my user, so I can't sudo anymore... is there a way to fix this?
2007-07-16T08:06:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	You can start in 'recovery mode'. Option at the boot menu.
2007-07-16T08:06:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	Am I automatically root then?
2007-07-16T08:06:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	Limited shell. yes. You are root.
2007-07-16T08:07:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	Thanx gonna try it, and for the next time what is the correct command to add a group to a user?
2007-07-16T08:07:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	gpasswd
2007-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	Ah I used that before and someone said that was wrong :( so now I used usermod.... :P
2007-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	I'm old and probably wrong. I strip out most of the ubuntu stuff and drive it like debian. Definitly suck at the point and click things :)
2007-07-16T08:09:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	Hehe, anyway I'm gonna reboot and try it now thanks
2007-07-16T08:09:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	what is the group to become root adm or admin
2007-07-16T08:11:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	My user is a member of both. But the /etc/sudoers file is where it's at (edited by 'visudo')
2007-07-16T08:40:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	ok I've got another problem, now I got sudo back but I don't have to type my password anymore...
2007-07-16T08:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	Sorry dude plane to catch in 5hours.
2007-07-16T08:41:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	ok
2007-07-16T08:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	daan (If you reinstall just keep your /home directory backed up)
2007-07-16T08:42:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	I'm not going to reinstall because of this :P
2007-07-16T08:42:00.000Z	daan	gyaresu	I'm going to fix it
2007-07-16T08:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	daan	Good luck I'm going to sleep.
