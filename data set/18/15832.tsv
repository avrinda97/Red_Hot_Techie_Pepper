2006-06-16T06:32:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		how do I put a shortcut in my menu?
2006-06-16T06:33:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		How can I load it without the sudo path command?
2006-06-16T06:34:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		wow, it's really slow
2006-06-16T06:34:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		choppy
2006-06-16T06:35:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		can someone tell me how to make a shortcut in the menu to launch the program without command line?
2006-06-16T06:37:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		"seem" is the operative term. Streamlining is sometimes what it is.
2006-06-16T06:39:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		Wouldn't it make sense, though, to have the program/package create these shortcuts by default, as in windows?
2006-06-16T06:39:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		yes, it's installed
2006-06-16T06:40:00.000Z	max_nooby_noob		no, I'm not saying Linux should be Windows, but it seems to make sense, Windows or not, that such things should be simplified.
2006-06-16T06:40:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 linux has a diy tradition as well as a lack of a coherent standard for desktop configuration, it would be hard for 3rd party software to pop an icon on the desktop when there's no guarantee that a desktop will even exist
2006-06-16T07:05:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 what do you use to run it from the command line?
2006-06-16T07:07:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 what's the file?  does it work if you run the file from the command line?  did you try with the 'run in terminal' checkbox checked
2006-06-16T07:09:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 try  sudo updatedb;  locate googleearth
2006-06-16T07:10:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 actually try  history  | grep googleearth
2006-06-16T07:11:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 do you neeeed sudo for that?
2006-06-16T07:13:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 well the menu command would be gksudo /usr/local/google-earth/googleearth   but try to figure out how to configure things so you don't need sudo
2006-06-16T07:17:00.000Z	wastrel	max_nooby_noob	 now try to run google earth without sudo
