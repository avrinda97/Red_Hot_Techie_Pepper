2006-03-30T13:14:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	as a server or a client?
2006-03-30T13:15:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	as a server
2006-03-30T13:15:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	do you have the printer configured locally, through System->Administration->Printing?
2006-03-30T13:15:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	yes
2006-03-30T13:16:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	what type of clients are you serving to?
2006-03-30T13:16:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	windows clients
2006-03-30T13:16:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	you should be able to just install the samba server and it will automatically share the printers
2006-03-30T13:17:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	unfortunatly that's not the case -- i have samba installed :-/
2006-03-30T13:17:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	are the windows machines able to browse your ubuntu machine?
2006-03-30T13:17:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	yes
2006-03-30T13:18:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	so they see the file shares, just not the printer?
2006-03-30T13:18:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	i had to configure the samba config file to get them to see the printer, but they cant print
2006-03-30T13:18:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	they don't have the required driver, but when i install it, it doesnt work -- there's no automated utility?
2006-03-30T13:18:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	i suspect is futzed the configuration file somehow
2006-03-30T13:19:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	in System->Administration->Printing there might be something for configuring smb sharing, but I don't have a printer so I can't check
2006-03-30T13:19:00.000Z	fangorious	aridese	have you checked /var/log/cups/*
2006-03-30T13:20:00.000Z	aridese	fangorious	ok, ill look
