2006-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	sureshot	ReverseBlade	not been watching but it sounds like his card is not set up correctly
2006-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	sureshot	I thought the same, but he claims, he receives an IP after rebooting
2006-10-18T11:28:00.000Z	sureshot	ReverseBlade	i have see things like this happen what is the sub net mask of what he gets is it 255.255.0.0 if so it is not set up correctly or the routor is not as well
2006-10-18T11:29:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	sureshot	I think there's a conflict in his story that he is not even aware of
2006-10-18T11:30:00.000Z	sureshot	ReverseBlade	that may be so take him back to the beginning have him hard reset his router and then reconfigure it then see what happens
