2012-05-12T09:31:00.000Z	arno_		Hi, if I install lts. Can I switch easily to "normal" ubuntu later ? Will I just need to change the repositories if I decide I want to upgrade in october ?
2012-05-12T09:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	you can upgrade to 12.10 when it is released in October if you want..yes
2012-05-12T09:32:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	ubuntu and ubuntu lts are the same (at install time) ?
2012-05-12T09:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	the packages are more stable on purpose in LTS, the apps as seen by the lay user will be the same
2012-05-12T09:47:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	Are there two different isos for 12.04 if so, are packages more stable in lts or are apps the same ?
2012-05-12T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	there are several ISOs for 12.04
2012-05-12T09:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	the apps varied depending on if you use kubuntu, lubuntu, xubuntu or ubuntu. they will all be officially stable
2012-05-12T09:51:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	am I assured the versions of underlying libraries are the same between all flavors (ie: same version of sqlite, gtk) or could they be differents ?
2012-05-12T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	yes that will be identical, just the default DE and apps will differ
2012-05-12T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	and obviously you can run the gnome apps in KDE and vice-versa
2012-05-12T09:55:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	thanks
2012-05-12T09:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	np :)
2012-06-05T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	does it need root access?
2012-06-05T20:12:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	no
2012-06-05T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	then use the startup application in dash and make a startup item to run the command )
2012-06-05T20:14:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	thanks, it worked
2012-08-02T01:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arno_	are tehre any bugs reported for it?
2012-08-02T02:05:00.000Z	arno_	ActionParsnip	didn't find a bug bug report, but direct rendering does not work, and I wonder if that's because of that
