2006-07-26T07:35:00.000Z	donbono		but under windows.. it runs very fast
2006-07-26T07:35:00.000Z	donbono		it's a network printer.. with a print server
2006-07-26T07:36:00.000Z	donbono		no.. it's a network printer.. it has a print server attached..
2006-07-26T07:37:00.000Z	donbono		yes.. it prints.. but takes very long.. the crazy thing is that under windows machines it responds fast.. but now we are migrating to ubuntu.. and it has got so slow
2006-07-26T07:38:00.000Z	donbono		when I send a job.. i can see a message at the printer properties.. spooling LPR job xx% .. but takes too long
2006-07-26T07:38:00.000Z	donbono		I've tried all drivers available.. the latest version of hplip as well
2006-07-26T07:38:00.000Z	donbono		it's and HP colorlaserjet 2500
2006-07-26T07:39:00.000Z	donbono		no..
2006-07-26T07:39:00.000Z	donbono		what that has to do?.. it's a network printer and it's self controlled
2006-07-26T07:39:00.000Z	donbono		it's not directly plugged to any computer
2006-07-26T07:40:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	you're struggling to set it up?
2006-07-26T07:41:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	which driver do you use?
2006-07-26T07:42:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	i have a hp 4250 and a 4600 set up to print over the network and i don't see the spooling
2006-07-26T07:43:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	what sort of queue is it? smb, lpd?
2006-07-26T07:46:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	where is it taking time, on the linux machine before it actually goes into the queue?
2006-07-26T07:53:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	did you say whether or not it seems slower when printing certain types of documents? are ps/pdf documents faster than stuff from openoffice etc?
2006-07-26T07:57:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	i'm not really familiar with setting up printer servers, but i know for a fact that our linux machines print to a slighlty differently configured queue than the windows machines. I'm not sure what the reason for it is tho
2006-07-26T07:57:00.000Z	CarinArr	donbono	have you tried www.ubuntuforums.org
