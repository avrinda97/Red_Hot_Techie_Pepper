2010-07-04T18:29:00.000Z	Euphus		usb-plug
2010-07-04T18:29:00.000Z	Euphus		and buy a netgear ;)

2010-07-04T18:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Euphus	netgear hasn't let the people I know down and it picks up ISP settings all by itself so good suggestion
2010-07-04T18:31:00.000Z	Euphus		;)
2010-07-04T18:32:00.000Z	Euphus	Pirate_Hunter	; i went from linksys to netgear, and i dont regret
2010-07-04T18:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Euphus	hmmm linksys I thought they were good at least much better than netgear, am I wrong?
2010-07-04T18:33:00.000Z	Euphus	Pirate_Hunter	 :  broke 3 in a half year :) but then the whole house fucked with them. the netgear are still running :)
