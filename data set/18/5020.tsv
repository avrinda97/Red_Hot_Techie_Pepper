2011-10-16T00:08:00.000Z	endeavormac		now that i've switched to oneiric and i'm giving this unity thing a try, can anyone recommend a good, simple, dark theme? I do a lot of late night programming
2011-10-16T00:09:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	vim?
2011-10-16T00:09:00.000Z	wolter		can I install ubuntu from a harddisk?
2011-10-16T00:09:00.000Z	endeavormac	wolter	sometimes.
2011-10-16T00:12:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	for vim I like the dw_ series
2011-10-16T00:13:00.000Z	endeavormac	wolter	Could you be a bit more specific? I'm looking for GTK3+ themes though (i believe, still working my head around unity themes)
2011-10-16T00:13:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	oh I thought you were looking for an IDE theme
2011-10-16T00:14:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	I only know themes for Gnome Classic, so can't help I'm afraid :p
2011-10-16T00:14:00.000Z	endeavormac	wolter	can i get back to gnome classic in oneiric? things get a bit screwy when i tried it. maybe there's an easier way
2011-10-16T00:15:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	I believe you can select your interface at the login screem
2011-10-16T00:15:00.000Z	wolter		screen*
2011-10-16T00:16:00.000Z	endeavormac	wolter	yes, but now i can't move my taskbars aroudn
2011-10-16T00:18:00.000Z	endeavormac		in maverick it was pretty easy to change up my ubuntu theme. is there something similar in oneiric?
2011-10-16T00:26:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	now that I remember, I think that if you install the gnome-panel you can use Gnome Classic
2011-10-16T00:27:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/gnome-shell-ubuntu-11-10-guide/
2011-10-16T00:27:00.000Z	endeavormac		thanks wolter
2011-10-16T00:29:00.000Z	wolter	endeavormac	no problem; once in gnome classic, the black dust theme is nice
2011-10-16T00:39:00.000Z	endeavormac	wolter	i'm fighting my way through this oneiric stuff. i have this weird ubuntu taskbar on one of my monitors (I don't know if you use dual monitors). if so, any idea how to remove it?
