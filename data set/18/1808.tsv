2011-09-28T03:31:00.000Z	DrGamut		Has anyone solved the screen tearing issues with nvidia proprietary drivers and dual monitors?
2011-09-28T03:32:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- have you set your v sync in compix config?
2011-09-28T03:32:00.000Z	DrGamut	zooka	i set it in the nvidia config, and i enabled a workaround as suggested by some google results
2011-09-28T03:33:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- The nvidia config v sync doesnt seem to work
2011-09-28T03:33:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- install compiz settings manager if you haven't already
2011-09-28T03:33:00.000Z	DrGamut	zooka	So where is the v sync option in compiz config
2011-09-28T03:33:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- uh I beleive general options, one sec
2011-09-28T03:35:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2009/09/20/make-compiz-run-smoothly-and-without-tearing/ This should show you where that is located
2011-09-28T03:35:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- also you may have to disable v sync everywhere else you have turned it on (e.g. nvidia control panel)
2011-09-28T03:36:00.000Z	DrGamut	zooka	my ccsm doesn't have the options mentioned in that link
2011-09-28T03:37:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- You probably installed the simple version.
2011-09-28T03:37:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- in Ubuntu Software center you can choose simple or advanced
2011-09-28T03:37:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- just the two
2011-09-28T03:38:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- what version of ubuntu are you on?
2011-09-28T03:39:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- gotcha. I haven't used 11.10 yet, so I don't know if they changed something there
2011-09-28T03:40:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- I'm not sure what to tell you if that setting isn't there. Delete and reinstall compiz settings manager maybe?
2011-09-28T03:41:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- You could look into editing your xorg.conf to enter it manually. I wouldn't know how to help you with that though
2011-09-28T03:42:00.000Z	zooka	DrGamut	- I'll be back in a bit sorry, but good luck
