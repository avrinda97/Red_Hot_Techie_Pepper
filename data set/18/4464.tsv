2009-08-17T21:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		arg, ?dm isn't helpful to people
2009-08-17T21:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		I fixed that factoid like a month ago
2009-08-17T21:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	ask an op in #ubuntu-ops to look at your edit of that factoid
2009-10-09T03:30:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	means if you want to fetch the source you need them there
2009-10-09T03:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	no
2009-10-09T03:29:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	so what do they mean? :)
2009-10-09T03:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	ok, so it allows you to get source code if you want to later
2009-10-09T03:30:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	yes
2009-10-09T03:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	k, thanks
2009-10-30T07:00:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	do you also use compiz? I get crashes with any compiz effect after upgrading :\
2009-10-30T07:00:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	But seems more stable otherwise (ie the *system* is stable, even if compiz is broken)
2009-12-10T08:40:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	I hope you're about 20 right now :\
2009-12-10T08:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	the lol is a auto replace scripty bit kiddy thing
2009-12-10T08:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	I know, that's why I said to cut it out :)
2009-12-10T08:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	I used to have that back when on EFnet using mirc
2009-12-10T08:38:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	IdleOne	that's not something to brag about :\
2009-12-10T08:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	was 10+ years ago :/
2009-12-10T08:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	Mike_lifeguard	:P
