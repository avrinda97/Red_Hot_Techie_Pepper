2006-05-13T05:06:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	someone else had problems with addresses resolving to 1.0.0.0, too... apparently the nameserver on their router was acting up
2006-05-13T05:07:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	you could try disbling ipv6
2006-05-13T05:10:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	that might not solve your problem... but then again, it might
2006-05-13T05:10:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	out of curiosity, are you using some kind of a nat router to connect to the internet?
2006-05-13T05:11:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	what does /etc/resolv.conf show as your nameserver addresses?
2006-05-13T05:12:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	is that the address of your router?
2006-05-13T05:12:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	okay. well, disabling ipv6 is still worth a shot
2006-05-13T05:26:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	sounds like your name server is doing something weird
2006-05-13T05:27:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	is your windows in vmware using the same nameserver that you have in /etc/resolv.conf now?
2006-05-13T05:29:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	hmm. try dig irc.freenode.net
2006-05-13T05:33:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	that came from 192.168.1.1, I thought you said you had something else in /etc/resolv.conf?
2006-05-13T05:33:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	pastebin your resolv.conf, too
2006-05-13T05:35:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	192.168.1.1 is your router, right?
2006-05-13T05:36:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	dig chat.freenode.net
2006-05-13T05:38:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	um. but nothing changed?
2006-05-13T05:39:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	okay, so after that you were using the router's nameserver?
2006-05-13T05:39:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	okay. well, I suppose the router's nameserver kind of *should* work, too
2006-05-13T05:41:00.000Z	iNiku	zelevw	the quality of the firmware on cheapo home routers usually leaves something to be desired...
