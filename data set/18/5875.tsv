2008-12-20T05:23:00.000Z	n8tuser		ohletmeinnowgodd-> what happens when you plugged the memory in?
2008-12-20T05:25:00.000Z	n8tuser		ohletmeinnowgodd-> if you type  dmesg  and look in the last few lines, has it been detected?
2008-12-20T05:26:00.000Z	n8tuser		deepfriedsquirre-> it is still possible, specially if it advised you not to fsck a mounted partition and you do it anyways
2008-12-20T05:27:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	I'd like to back some files up from it before I continue.
2008-12-20T05:29:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	If I pause fsck with Ctrl-z, mount it, copy some files, unmount it and fg fsck again, will I cause problems?
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	aye
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	I recovered it with testdisk ><
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	From a completely mangled partitiont able of an abused hard drive
2008-12-20T05:31:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	But would doing what I said cause fsck to emss it up?
2008-12-20T05:33:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	Oh yeah, I'm guessing that :P
2008-12-31T03:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	- what do you have between your hosts and the dsl modem?
2008-12-31T03:59:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	- is the dsl modem also acting as a router?  any firewalls on such router?
2008-12-31T04:01:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	- you have settings that are mis-configured..
2009-01-18T00:06:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	-> use the /dev/sdX  instead of UUID in menu.lst
2009-01-18T00:17:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	-> use the /dev/sdX  instead of UUID in menu.lst
2009-01-18T00:18:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	n8tuser	I used (hd0,8), yes
2009-01-18T00:23:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	-> yes i've already suggested that eh?  use /dev/sdX instead of UUID
2009-01-18T00:25:00.000Z	n8tuser	deepfriedsquirre	-> yeah both, on menu.lst and also fstab  to rid of the UUID issue, and correct it once you get the correct uuid
