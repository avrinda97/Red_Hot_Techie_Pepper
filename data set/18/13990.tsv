2007-02-20T06:25:00.000Z	phazeman		does anybody here uses photoshop under crossover office or wine ? i need to know if the CameraRaw plugin works as well.. ?
2007-02-20T06:26:00.000Z	Mattias	phazeman	which digial system camera are you using?
2007-02-20T06:26:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	canon
2007-02-20T06:26:00.000Z	Mattias	phazeman	well i just reinstalled to ubuntu so lost the name of the app i used to my nikon d70s raw format
2007-02-20T06:27:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	i mean - i know i can run photoshop under ubuntu/kubuntu with crossover office and i've done it myself, but i've ever tried to open any raw files with it. i want to kill my w$ now and go back to full time linux but the photoshop issue is the only one that stops me
2007-02-20T06:28:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	i can show you a screenshot of mine with photoshop 7 on kubuntu
2007-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	it's just lacks the basic functionality for me
2007-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	Mattias	phazeman	if photoshop works, then the camera raw plugin should work too no?
2007-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	thats the thing that the raw plugin doesn't sit on the same place with photoshop and all it's plugins
2007-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	its separated
2007-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	i need to be sure 100%
2007-02-20T06:30:00.000Z	Mattias	phazeman	your not on ubuntu now and with photoshop?
2007-02-20T06:30:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	nop, i'm on windows at home because of the photoshop issue
2007-02-20T06:31:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	but i really wanted to come back to linux. the only thing stopping me for now is the photoshop issue
2007-02-20T06:31:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	i know 99% that codeweavers crossover doesn't support the installshiled of PS CS2, but i know a trick to make it work
2007-02-20T06:31:00.000Z	Mattias	phazeman	tried their irc channel here on freenode? #crossover
2007-02-20T06:32:00.000Z	phazeman	Mattias	nop.. not yet.. will try now :)
