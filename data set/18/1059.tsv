2012-06-27T23:44:00.000Z	designbybeck		anyone use Synergy?
2012-06-27T23:44:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	I have, not actively but am familiar
2012-06-27T23:45:00.000Z	designbybeck	tyler_d	did your ubuntu screen go blank when you moved your mouse out and then it comes back on after a sec
2012-06-27T23:45:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	no it did not, I did note a very very short flicker, but certainly not to the extent you describe
2012-06-27T23:46:00.000Z	designbybeck		yes it is more than just a flicker
2012-06-27T23:46:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	have you started the server/client in the forground to see of possible error output?
2012-06-27T23:46:00.000Z	designbybeck		what do you mean foreground?
2012-06-27T23:47:00.000Z	designbybeck		i used their wizards to start them respectively tyler_d
2012-06-27T23:47:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	I would suggest starting them from the cli and monitoring output
2012-06-27T23:48:00.000Z	designbybeck		ok thank you tyler_d
2012-06-27T23:48:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	strange, sorry for dropping off there
2012-06-27T23:48:00.000Z	designbybeck		no prob tyler_d
2012-06-27T23:49:00.000Z	designbybeck		thank you for your help, it is my first time trying this so I don't know how it is suppose to handle tyler_d
2012-06-27T23:49:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	it works quite well, I used it for years in the past
2012-06-27T23:51:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	it would be something like `synergys -d ERROR -c /path/to/config` from a command line
2012-06-27T23:51:00.000Z	designbybeck		thanks
2012-06-27T23:56:00.000Z	designbybeck	tyler_d	I found the bug http://synergy-foss.org/spit/issues/details/2741/
2012-06-27T23:57:00.000Z	tyler_d	designbybeck	well that's always good news and bad news, good for you though :)
