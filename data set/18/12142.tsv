2006-06-30T08:29:00.000Z	root__		anyone familiar with software raid?
2006-06-30T08:30:00.000Z	gdb	root__	somewhat, what's the issue?
2006-06-30T08:32:00.000Z	root__	gdb	 , i reinstalled linux like 10 times today and always same issue , it wont mount the raid partitions
2006-06-30T08:32:00.000Z	gdb	root__	In what context?
2006-06-30T08:33:00.000Z	gdb	root__	Meaning during install, after install, after you've created some, ones you've created previously, etc?
2006-06-30T08:34:00.000Z	root__	gdb	i create them fro scratch every time , then after linux installs and boots for the first time it sais something about mgic bit
2006-06-30T08:34:00.000Z	root__	gdb	magic bit , or something , and none of my raid partitions work
2006-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	gdb	root__	So these are partitions you've created previous to installing? And where are they?  The boot drive or some other disks?
2006-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	root__	gdb	no, i have /boot on a single partition , then i have /home / and /swap raided
2006-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	root__	gdb	i did have software raid with x64 , it worked well , now i installed x32 and id doesnt want to work
2006-06-30T08:40:00.000Z	gdb	root__	I've never been successful in getting the boot device mirrored and I tried for hours. ;-)  I assume you're creating these using the Live CD and then running the installer?  You may be better advised to install the system normally and then manually "encapsulate" the boot device. I use quotes because Linux does not support actual disk encapsulation.
2006-06-30T08:42:00.000Z	gdb	root__	Oh dear.  So you're trying to concatenate the / partition?
2006-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	gdb	root__	I'm not sure that's psossible.
2006-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	root__	gdb	i had it working with x64
2006-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	gdb	root__	Ah, and what was different about that installation?
2006-06-30T08:45:00.000Z	root__	gdb	nothing , i did exactly same thing , it just doesnt work
2006-06-30T08:46:00.000Z	gdb	root__	Well, I apologize, I've not the experience with boot device raid (under Linux) to be much help.
2006-06-30T08:47:00.000Z	root__	gdb	ok , no problem , thanks for helping
