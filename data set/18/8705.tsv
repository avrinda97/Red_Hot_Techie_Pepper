2007-07-17T10:50:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	because ubuntu users know all!
2007-07-17T10:51:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	i know that.
2007-07-17T10:51:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	haha
2007-07-17T10:51:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	lol, I guess I should have known that !
2007-07-17T10:51:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	well you did, of course. maybe you know: why job control is turned off for my tty? i can't boot ubuntu.
2007-07-17T10:53:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	I'm guessing this makes me a non Ubuntu user, I'm not sure
2007-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	what is there error your getting?
2007-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	< /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off >
2007-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	i'm trying to boot a ubuntu disk on my friend's old computer. i've been using feisty disks.
2007-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	I think it's a issue with mounts, let me try google
2007-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	oh man it seems to be working fine with edgy
2007-07-17T10:58:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	I was just gonna suggest using a different dist
2007-07-17T10:58:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	yeah puppy was OK and now edgy is working ok...but i want to use feisty. i guess there's not much i can do short of installing edgy then dist-upgrading, eh?
2007-07-17T10:59:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	have you verified the disc to work on other machines?
2007-07-17T10:59:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	yeah
2007-07-17T10:59:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	these disks work fine on my other computers
2007-07-17T11:00:00.000Z	royel	relativeownershi	is it an older machine your having problems with then?
2007-07-17T11:00:00.000Z	relativeownershi	royel	yeah but there's somebody else in the hcannel having a similiar problem with a brand new computer
