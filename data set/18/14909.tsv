2006-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	djtansey		dapper is going to be supported for 3/5 years (desktop/server.) will the next release be supported for the same length of time? If not, how are people supposed to know which will have extended support?
2006-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	no next one will not. i guess it can be on the website how long each is supported and it will certiainly be printed on the manufactured CD's
2006-04-25T06:56:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	but it won't be some obvious pattern, like every other one. or every third one. or every forth one?
2006-04-25T06:57:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	at this point i'm not sure. though i'm guessing ever 2 years such an 'enterprise' release will come out
2006-04-25T06:57:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	thanks. just wanted to know. look forward to dapper and to a more edgy dapper+1 release.
2006-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	me too; though dapper has just scared me big-time. but i think they'll polish it up by release
2006-04-25T06:59:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	why, what did it do? i just hope it has good laptop support (i.e. docking/undocking, external monitors, etc.)
2006-04-25T07:00:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	i wouldn't dare try it on my laptop at this point. breezy works beautifully on it. but i tried doing an apt-get dist-upgrade and it messed up; BAD. if you wanna try it; i would suggest a clean install. but don't do dist-upgrade and expect it to be easy
2006-04-25T07:00:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	btw, i tried the dist-upgrade on my desktop not my laptop
2006-04-25T07:01:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	to be honest, i'm considering doing a clean dapper beta install this weekend. i just have to make sure i have an up-to-date backup of it that isn't missing some files. (a couple years back did a clean install of my machine but forgot my gnupg keys...)
2006-04-25T07:02:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	this time around i'm finally going to switch to my own /home partition... i just never wanted to before (on this laptop) because the harddrive isn't that huge.
2006-04-25T07:03:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	btw, how do you backup your home directory?
2006-04-25T07:03:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	if i were to, i would load cp -rf /home to my 320 GB drive. :D
2006-04-25T07:04:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	yeah. probably the best. i used to have a nice diff script setup. lost it sometime...
2006-04-25T07:16:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	and amphi: those are both nice. my next computer will be a thinkpad. but for now my dell 700m is doing super
2006-04-25T07:17:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	dunno the 700m. had the inspiron 8200... didn't work so well with the amount of traveling/backpacking i do
2006-04-25T07:18:00.000Z	nemik	djtansey	8200 was terrible. all my friends hate theirs. large and many problems. 700m seems much better built; but its still a dell
2006-04-25T07:19:00.000Z	djtansey	nemik	ah. well, i guess there is hope yet.
