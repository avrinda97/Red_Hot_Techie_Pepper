2005-10-08T15:21:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	: Either or both. the case fan will blow out warm air that has built up in the box, the cpu fan will try to cool the chip directly, There is a trade off for noise of course..
2005-10-08T15:22:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	take a look at www.overclockers.com for hints and tips! :)
2005-10-08T15:23:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	thermal paste does make a difference yes, air is a good insulator
2005-10-08T15:29:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	Getting a cpu fan that just blasts hot air onto your cpu is not going to help too much.. You really need to look at cooling the ambiant temperature if you can.  :)
2005-10-08T15:30:00.000Z	Toma-	selinium	thanks for repeating p0windah :D
2005-10-08T15:31:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	Fans are cheap anyway, get both, its cheaper then replacing you cpu! Sorry I missed p0windah post! :)
2005-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	You can buy a portable airconditioner for around 250 that would be the best solution if you can afford it.
2005-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	Toma-	selinium	no.
2005-10-08T15:41:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	have a look around the overclockers site, the give different priced solutions, including vents that may be less cost/hassle in the long run. http://overclockers.com/articles1256/
2005-10-08T15:42:00.000Z	Toma-	selinium	i need the room to be cooler, not the cpu
2005-10-08T15:43:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	good luck it. :)
2005-10-08T15:43:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	like lager! :)
2005-11-06T15:22:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	use zsnes and get mario roms
2005-11-06T15:22:00.000Z	Toma-	selinium	now thats using the ol' noodle :D
2005-11-06T15:23:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	not sure, but mariokart has split screen, i know it is a bit old school but....
2006-01-16T08:42:00.000Z	Toma-	selinium	>> still works fine with a touch'ed file...
2006-01-16T08:42:00.000Z	selinium	Toma-	indeed! :)
2006-01-16T08:43:00.000Z	Toma-	selinium	so no real need for > :)
