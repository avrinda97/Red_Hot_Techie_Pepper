2012-01-04T00:36:00.000Z	frots		guys, I lost reboot
2012-01-04T00:36:00.000Z	frots		how can I reboot now?
2012-01-04T00:36:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	in terminal type sudo reboot
2012-01-04T00:37:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	did you change your PATH env at all ?
2012-01-04T00:39:00.000Z	frots	acidfrost	I now read that shutdown -r should do the same, but it is also gone
2012-01-04T00:40:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	i'd assume you effed your PATH env up or you removed /bin/
2012-01-04T00:40:00.000Z	frots	acidfrost	isnt reboot supposed to be in sbin ?
2012-01-04T00:41:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	maybe
2012-01-04T00:41:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	yes it is
2012-01-04T00:41:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	do echo $PATH and paste bin the results
2012-01-04T00:42:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	and do ls /bin/ and ls /usr/sbin/
2012-01-04T00:42:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	but paste bin it
2012-01-04T00:42:00.000Z	frots	acidfrost	if I do ls /sbin/reboot, there is nothing there
2012-01-04T00:43:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	then something deleted your reboot
2012-01-04T00:43:00.000Z	frots	acidfrost	WTF?
2012-01-04T00:43:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	or you might have deletd it as root
2012-01-04T00:43:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	if you have root you have 100% absolute control and you can delete anything
2012-01-04T00:44:00.000Z	acidfrost	frots	hmm never knew about that ofcourse i've never deleted anything in /sbin/ , /usr/sbin/, /bin/
