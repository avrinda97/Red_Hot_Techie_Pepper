2009-04-27T00:00:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	try a look in update area
2009-04-27T00:02:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	just go to updates and refresh all, or even change the source
2009-04-27T00:02:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	 you shoild get a message like, hey, new OS available
2009-04-27T00:02:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	 then your probably there anyway
2009-04-27T00:03:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	 open the system monitor and look at the system tab

2009-04-27T00:05:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	just a source path I guess
2009-04-27T00:06:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	ok, I guess that error is quite important
2009-04-27T00:07:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	 I dont know, maybe someone does here, why not do a fresh install?
2009-04-27T00:07:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	just back up your files etc

2009-04-27T00:13:00.000Z	aspin	Bilboe	 but if you have it all backed up whats the prob, we live and learn :)
