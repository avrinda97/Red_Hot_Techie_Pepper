2008-01-11T05:42:00.000Z	Nessarose		well my problem is that with cfdisk I can't see my main parition why is that?
2008-01-11T05:42:00.000Z	peabody	Nessarose	What kind of partition is it?
2008-01-11T05:43:00.000Z	peabody	Nessarose	Have you tried other tools?
2008-01-11T05:43:00.000Z	peabody	Nessarose	Are you trying to recover the partition, or are you partitioning the space?
2008-01-11T05:45:00.000Z	peabody	Nessarose	?? So, what's the problem exactly?  Are you saying you created a reiserfs partition on /dev/sda1 and it ends up being marked as some other kind of partition?
2008-01-11T05:48:00.000Z	Nessarose	peabody	my problem is I have a 20G swap I want to cut that space in half give half to swap half to a new parition I can't do that though cause my root linux parition shows up in cfdisk as free space
2008-01-11T05:49:00.000Z	peabody	Nessarose	Your root partition?
2008-01-11T05:49:00.000Z	Nessarose	peabody	yes
2008-01-11T05:50:00.000Z	peabody	Nessarose	Which is your root partition?  /dev/sda[1-3] ??
2008-01-11T05:52:00.000Z	Nessarose	peabody	any idea?
