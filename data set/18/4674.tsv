2009-12-09T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	chromium if you add the PPA, Arora is good too
2009-12-09T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa
2009-12-09T01:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	it is, uses a hell of a lot less ram than firefox too
2010-04-26T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	you may need a virtual box to run the app natively to get an accurate test, you will need a windows license and install media
2012-06-16T08:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	I suggest a mid range Nvidia and you'll be fine :)
2012-06-16T08:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	why would you?
2012-06-16T08:38:00.000Z	skyl	ActionParsnip	I'm not a liberty :D

2012-06-16T08:39:00.000Z	skyl	ActionParsnip	to tell you why I would compile webkit while playing webgl and watching a video and running various cpu-hungry code
2012-06-16T08:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	I use chrome, its a webkit based browser, but why would compiling it do something I can't already do?
2012-06-16T08:42:00.000Z	skyl	ActionParsnip	people compile webkit all over the world everyday. Okay, switch "compile webkit" to "compile qt" and you have the same problem of it taking forever ...
2012-06-16T08:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	so you use it as a speed test...?
2012-06-16T08:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	if you just want to max your cpu, just run:  yes > /dev/null      and it will chew the cpu lotsly :)
2012-06-16T08:45:00.000Z	skyl	ActionParsnip	no, I actually want to compile qt really quickly while playing with webgl and running other stuff, etc
2012-06-16T08:47:00.000Z	skyl	ActionParsnip	but thanks for the link to the certified hardware
2012-06-16T08:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skyl	np dude
