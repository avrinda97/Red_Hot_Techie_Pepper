2007-01-13T12:53:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	you could try   xvidtune
2007-01-13T12:53:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	maybe look at  man xvidtune  for details
2007-01-13T12:57:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	 yeah when I freshly installed ubuntu is was at 1280xsomething, stretched
2007-01-13T13:00:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	officially it is a small tool, see it's description: "xvidtune is a small tool that was part of xbase-clients" :)
2007-01-13T13:00:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	hah, should i just press auto and let it... try?
2007-01-13T13:00:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	But you do not really need to keep it around after using it.
2007-01-13T13:02:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	usually I fiddle with the left-right-down-up and shorter-taller instead
2007-01-13T13:03:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	and in very small steps.
2007-01-13T13:03:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	and do read the man for xvidtune too, if you have not.
2007-01-13T13:07:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	I went Left-Apple is it gives me Sorry you have requested a modeline. This is not possible, or not supported by your hardware configuration...
2007-01-13T13:08:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	hmm, lcd or crt?
2007-01-13T13:16:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	I removed the CRT line, xvidtune still isn't happy
2007-01-13T13:17:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	I guess it did not help you then, if it does not let you tune anything
2007-01-13T13:18:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	anything else? I mean the monitor says that it's on 1440x900 and no errors on the Xlog, but it's all shifted, and on the bottom there's this dark red bar that covers up about 1/5th of the screen
2007-01-13T13:19:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	dark red? not black?
2007-01-13T13:19:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	nope
2007-01-13T13:19:00.000Z	Lynoure	yosyp	That does not sound like anything I know.
2007-01-13T13:19:00.000Z	yosyp	Lynoure	it also isn't on the login screen, only when logged in
