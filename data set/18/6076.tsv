2008-07-07T00:05:00.000Z	Jeffreyf		On wireless-G network......only getting 2MB/s and 6ft from AP.  Any ideas
2008-07-07T00:06:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	do you have anyone with a wireledd B adapter?
2008-07-07T00:06:00.000Z	AmritP		because that will have that effect
2008-07-07T00:06:00.000Z	Jeffreyf		Router set to G-ONLY.....nope
2008-07-07T00:08:00.000Z	Jeffreyf	AmritP	ï»¿Router set to G-ONLY.....nope
2008-07-07T00:08:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	humm... maybe bad router?
2008-07-07T00:09:00.000Z	Jeffreyf	AmritP	Other computer connected at 54mb/s.....Laptop also to 54mb/s
2008-07-07T00:09:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	then, maybe bad wireless agapter?
2008-07-07T00:10:00.000Z	AmritP		i've really never had such a problem happen to me...
2008-07-07T00:10:00.000Z	Jeffreyf	AmritP	Adapter was fine when running Windows.....never worked @ full speed after Ubuntu
2008-07-07T00:10:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	ah, then you need the drivers
2008-07-07T00:11:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	use ndiswrapper
2008-07-07T00:19:00.000Z	Jeffreyf	AmritP	it is a LInksys WMP54GS
2008-07-07T00:19:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	i've always had a problem with linksys drivers and such... so just use ndiswrapper...
2008-07-07T00:20:00.000Z	Jeffreyf	AmritP	Even if I am using the restricted drivers?
2008-07-07T00:22:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	like i said... i have always had a problem with linksys drivers, ndiswrapper uses the windows drivers and lets you use them (and you said that they work under windows right, so this would be perfect)
2008-07-07T00:22:00.000Z	Jeffreyf	AmritP	Thanks!  I will give it a shot and will be back.
2008-07-07T00:22:00.000Z	AmritP	Jeffreyf	np :)
