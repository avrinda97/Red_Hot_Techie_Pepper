2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	Lev|atan		# lsmod | grep ipv6
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	Lev|atan		ipv6                  311720  27

2008-05-18T23:54:00.000Z	drash	Lev|atan	start a file called bad_list inside /etc/modprobe.d. Add "alias net-pf-10 off" to it, save & reboot. It should work.
2008-05-19T00:04:00.000Z	drash	Lev|atan	try turning it back on in aliases if you added it to bad_list as well
2008-05-19T00:05:00.000Z	Lev|atan	drash	ok
