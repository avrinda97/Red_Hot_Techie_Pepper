2012-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm trying to install ubuntuon a neighbour's desktop machine. windows is v. slow on it.  it has 3 boot options: hdd, fdd, cd.  whatcan I do? the .iso for 12.10 is bigger than a CD
2012-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	install 12.04
2012-11-03T22:28:00.000Z	dooglus	wols	is that the last release of ubuntu that will support old computers?  do you have an alt distro you know of that still loads on old machines please?
2012-11-03T22:28:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	no. but it's a LTS which is (imho) a good idea for newbies to ubuntu
2012-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	and as a bonus it should fit on a CD :)  also: if you install 12.04 you can immediately upgrade to 12.10 if you wish, but I wouldn't
2012-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	dooglus	wols	thanks for your help.  what do you wuggest for burning .iso to CD?
2012-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	on which OS? if windows: imgburn
2012-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	dooglus	wols	ubuntu 12.10
2012-11-03T22:31:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	then whatever ubuntu uses for burning CDs. no clue myself
2012-11-03T22:31:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	do you know what hardware your neighbour has? lubuntu or xubuntu might be a very good idea
2012-11-03T22:40:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	it will get faster over time usually
2012-11-03T22:51:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	only if it's very old, but then yes
2012-11-03T22:51:00.000Z	dooglus	wols	it's a P4 CPU
2012-11-03T22:51:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	possible, especially for a OEM PC
2012-11-03T23:27:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	ssh is the client, not the serevr
2012-11-03T23:28:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	we do
2012-11-03T23:28:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	pastebin the full command you wrote and its output in a pastebin
2012-11-03T23:31:00.000Z	wols	dooglus	no need.
