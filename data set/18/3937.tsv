2009-08-16T00:22:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		why won't freenode accept a SSL connection
2009-08-16T00:23:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	The current ircd, Hyperion, does not support SSL connections. But ircd-seven (currently under development) will. Further questions in #freenode, please.
2009-08-16T18:17:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	The officially assigned TCP port is 22, but it's changeable.
2009-08-29T13:28:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	If someone is advertising his own channel - notify #freenode, or use /ignore, depending on your preferences
2009-08-29T13:29:00.000Z	GuidMorrow	grawity	- ???
2009-08-29T13:31:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	There is, but usually it's more than enough to just remove and recreate the partition.
2009-08-29T13:32:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	No need to wipe data.
2009-08-31T13:55:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	And for GNOME.
2009-08-31T13:57:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	Try Ctrl-alt-F1 a few times.
2009-08-31T14:05:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	What the beeping hell?
2009-08-31T14:09:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	X is usually running on Ctrl-Alt-F7, the seventh console.
2009-08-31T14:11:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	GNOME is the desktop environment. It uses X to draw the panels, icons and so on.
2009-08-31T14:14:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	Compiz.
2009-08-31T14:16:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	Compiz is a window manager, it is responsible for putting windows on your screen (and doing all the effects). CompizConfig-settings-manager is a program that allows editing Compiz settings and enabling effects.
2009-08-31T14:16:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	No.
2009-08-31T20:03:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	You're chatting on IRC, probably.
2009-10-17T17:52:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	Locked down how?
2009-10-17T17:57:00.000Z	grawity	GuidMorrow	I think that one is in "Software Sources">
