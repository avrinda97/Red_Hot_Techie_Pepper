2005-08-24T06:49:00.000Z	xerox		Hi.
2005-08-24T06:49:00.000Z	xerox		Is it possible to run arbitrary application fullscreen?
2005-08-24T06:50:00.000Z	xerox		E.g. Emacs.
2005-08-24T06:52:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	run emacs from gnome terminal, it can run in fullscreen mode
2005-08-24T06:54:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	exactly what I'm referring about - is gnome-terminal the only application that can run in proper fullscreen, under GNOME?
2005-08-24T06:54:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	no, epiphany can, evince can, firefox too I think
2005-08-24T06:54:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	I do not like this solution because gnome-terminal gives really awful colors to Emacs (and a very low number of them).
2005-08-24T06:55:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	you can change the colors in gnome-term, so that shouldn't be a problem.
2005-08-24T06:56:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	it is a problem - i.e. Emacs does have less colors in font-highlighting and such, it's awful to the eye.
2005-08-24T06:57:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	ok, but I don't have another solution to running emacs in fullscreen under gnome, sorry.
2005-08-24T06:57:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	thank you anyway :-)
2005-08-24T06:58:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	if you want a great wm for running apps i fullscreen I can recommend wmii-2
2005-08-24T06:58:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	I'll take a look, thank you.
2005-08-24T06:59:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	but it's rather different compared to you "everyday" wm :), think more of gnu-screen
2005-08-24T07:00:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	I have used ion before ion-2, and fvwm2 too :-)  I never heard of wmii-2, tough.
2005-08-24T07:00:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	ah, then it should be familiar to you.
2005-08-24T07:01:00.000Z	linukso	xerox	is a complete rewrite of the old wmi, inspired by lars/evil/ratpoison etc. But it feels very nice, and has got some nice features which makes it a breeze to use :)
2005-08-24T07:01:00.000Z	xerox	linukso	I don't exactly know if I really want to switch from GNOME tough... its ubuntu bounties are kind of useful sometimes :-)
