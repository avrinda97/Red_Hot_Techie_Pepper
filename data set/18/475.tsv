2012-11-18T18:14:00.000Z	hex20dec		I'm so sick and tired of updates ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS ruining my OS.
2012-11-18T18:14:00.000Z	hex20dec		Please help me once and for all, why is this always happening to me? The updates window popped up and all I did was let it update. Now my OS resolution is huge and for some reason it doesn't want to accept my password either. It's always something different.
2012-11-18T18:14:00.000Z	hex20dec		What am I doing wrong?
2012-11-18T18:15:00.000Z	OerHeks	hex20dec	sounds like you installed videodrivers manually, you need to build them every time there is a kernel update.
2012-11-18T18:16:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	Mind helping me out here on how to do this?
2012-11-18T18:18:00.000Z	OerHeks	hex20dec	you could do this tru a script, http://askubuntu.com/questions/111177/triggering-driver-module-rebuild-on-kernel-update
2012-11-18T18:34:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	Sorry about the delay.. Uhmm.. I haven't installed any drivers manually.
2012-11-18T18:36:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	Do I still need to go through that process in the link you sent me to?
2012-11-18T18:37:00.000Z	OerHeks	hex20dec	yes, this time manually
2012-11-18T18:39:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	It clearly says: "This guide is not aimed at users who have installed the drivers using EnvyNG or via the default Ubuntu mechanism."
2012-11-18T18:40:00.000Z	OerHeks	hex20dec	envyNG is very old method to use win drivers
2012-11-18T18:41:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	I was talking about the ubuntu mechanism, which is how I got my drivers, I never installed any of them manually, it was all installed with the OS.
2012-11-18T18:41:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	Sorry, I'm just a bit confused as to why I need to run this..
2012-11-18T18:42:00.000Z	OerHeks	hex20dec	oke, then you didn't install them bij downloading and applying yourself, then forget about this script, not suitable for you
2012-11-18T18:43:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	I'm glad you did, because I didn't want to go through this.
2012-11-18T19:16:00.000Z	OerHeks	hex20dec	i have bean searching for your  Intel Corporation 82Q963/Q965 , but no solution on 12.04/12.10
2012-11-18T19:17:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	Thanks man! =] I appreciate it even though you didn't find anything.
2012-11-18T19:24:00.000Z	hex20dec	OerHeks	Thanks again, and if you're still looking for it I think you should stop. I'm going to sleep.. GN
