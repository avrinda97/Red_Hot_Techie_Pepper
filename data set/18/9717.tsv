2009-05-04T04:55:00.000Z	panfist		how can i secure my ubuntu installation enough so that it's to log in from the outside
2009-05-04T04:55:00.000Z	panfist		wait...
2009-05-04T04:57:00.000Z	panfist		i'm trying to set up a secure and easy ssh connection to my ubuntu machine from the outside world
2009-05-04T04:57:00.000Z	cdavis	panfist	are you having problems?
2009-05-04T04:58:00.000Z	panfist	cdavis	i'm trying to make sure it's secure, i heard about people using special encryption keys they store on a thumb drive
2009-05-04T04:58:00.000Z	panfist	cdavis	or how to configure to use secure passphrases etc
2009-05-04T04:58:00.000Z	cdavis	panfist	you want to go read about authorized_keys or just use a very good password
2009-05-04T04:58:00.000Z	panfist	cdavis	right now i'm using ssh to log into my new ubuntu machine on my own subnet, behind my router, but i want to secure it so i can log in from work, or maybe even have the ubuntu box on a dmz
2009-05-04T04:59:00.000Z	panfist	cdavis	what about stuff like intrusion detection, like does a basic ubuntu box do anything special if it thinks that someone is trying to brute force their way in?
2009-05-04T05:00:00.000Z	cdavis	panfist	if you port forward only port 22 to your linux box, make sure root is not allowed ssh access and set a good password on your account you should be ok. Of course keeping up with security updates is a must
2009-05-04T05:00:00.000Z	panfist		do i need to look into snort or is that overkill?
2009-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	panfist		if i can wrap my head around securing ubuntu behind myfirewall, i eventually want ubuntu to -be- my firewall
2009-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	panfist		or some other linux based firewall
2009-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	cdavis	panfist	In my opinion that would be overkill if all you were doing was ssh
2009-05-04T05:02:00.000Z	cdavis	panfist	I would say install shorewall
2009-05-04T05:02:00.000Z	panfist	cdavis	well it's a start. i'm learning.
2009-05-04T05:02:00.000Z	panfist	cdavis	ssh i figure is a good place to start beause you can tunnel a lot of things through ssh
2009-05-04T05:02:00.000Z	cdavis	panfist	yes you can.
