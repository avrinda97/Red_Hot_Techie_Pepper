2010-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	kr3w		is there a way to do multi-server from commands
2010-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	kr3w		rather than ctrl+T
2010-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	kr3w		cause that's really annoying
2010-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	kr3w		like mirc had /server -m
2010-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	kr3w		if i do that then it changes server
2010-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	kr3w		i dont want that
2010-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	kr3w		i want multi
2010-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	kr3w		irssi does multi server with /server
2010-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	kr3w		not xchat :/
2010-05-23T05:51:00.000Z	kr3w		let me see again
2010-05-23T05:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	xchat will do multi server .. so will Qaussel.. but irssi is fantastic.. Weechat is suppose to be as good depending on who you talk to.
2010-05-23T05:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	I"m on kde right now so I can't give you the steps.. but instead of /server try /connect
2010-05-23T05:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	probably what moetunes said.. sounds familure
2010-05-23T05:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	ah.. then it is capable just not the way you want to use it.. it's tough when you're use to irssi
2010-05-23T05:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	there are scripts that will make it look like mIRC if you want..
2010-05-23T05:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	type the first few characters and hit TAB
2010-05-23T05:57:00.000Z	kr3w	Scunizi	think it's good
2010-05-23T05:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	kr3w	yep! :)
