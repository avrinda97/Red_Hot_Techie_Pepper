2005-09-30T08:43:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		does ubuntu require reboots to alter system changes like resolution?
2005-09-30T08:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	restarting X should be enough
2005-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	I was not  atechie until I discovered Linux (in fact I'm still not, really)
2005-12-30T10:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	the file system keeps things contiguous by itself
2005-12-30T10:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	unlikely
2005-12-30T10:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	is it an ftp server crashing, or your client?
2005-12-30T10:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	which client? gftp?
2005-12-30T10:35:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	thoreauputic	nah, ftp
2005-12-30T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	you mean command line ftp is crashing? i've never seen that...
2005-12-30T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	erm - is it segfaulting? What errors?
2005-12-30T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	that's what I meant by "which client"
2005-12-30T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	are you using "connect to server" ?
2005-12-30T10:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	yes, but it is nautilus that has the problem
2005-12-30T10:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	not dumped - but there are other files managers of course ( e.g konqueror, rox-filer, etc etc )
2005-12-30T10:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	nautilus is kind of integrated with gnome, so dumping it wouldn't be trivial :)
2005-12-30T10:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	nautilus is what you see when you open a folder/directory
2006-03-06T11:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	pine is "non-free" and not in Ubuntu
2007-03-11T06:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CaptainMorgan	ubotu
