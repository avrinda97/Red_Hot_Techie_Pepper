2006-05-21T16:01:00.000Z	jonuk		Question:  I'm trying to install Ubuntu 5.10.  When it gets to the stage where it is "Starting Partitioner", it gets 100% and then goes to a blue screen and hangs there.  If I hit Ctrl+C, it starts the partitioner again and hangs at 52% everytime.
2006-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	jonuk		I'm pretty positive it has something to do with my hard drives (first one in particular).  I have 2 hard drives.  One is a 40GB hard drive with Windows installed on it.  The second is a brand new 250 GB hard drive with entirely unallocated space.
2006-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	have a look at wiki.ubuntu.com/BootOptions  or wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulsKludge no promises but you might strike it lucky
2006-05-21T16:03:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	sata and ide?
2006-05-21T16:03:00.000Z	jonuk	ompaul	IDE
2006-05-21T16:04:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	make sure you have themn set as master and slave and work from there
2006-05-21T16:05:00.000Z	jonuk	ompaul	Yes, I have the jumper for the 40GB set as Master and the 250GB set as Slave
2006-05-21T16:05:00.000Z	jonuk	ompaul	 I want to leave the 40GB as is, and partition off part of the 250GB drive for Linux
2006-05-21T16:05:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	no cable select, and make sure that the cd is master on ide 2 (assuming that it is on ide 2)
2006-05-21T06:26:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	you will need to get a terminal, Applications, Accessories, Terminal, and in there type the bit between the arrow heads >>sudo fdisk -l<< get that output and go to https://paste.ubuntu-nl.org with it and enter it there and then give the url of that page in this channel
2006-05-21T06:27:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	so get yourself the live CD that comes with ubuntu and use that
2006-05-21T06:27:00.000Z	jonuk	ompaul	well, I've used the LiveCD for a little bit and decided to go ahead and permanently install
2006-05-21T06:28:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	so get the install CD and start the install
2006-05-21T06:31:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	did you have a look at wiki.ubuntu.com/BootOptions  or wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulsKludge ?
2006-05-21T06:31:00.000Z	jonuk	ompaul	i've glanced at them, i will read more thorouhgly
2006-05-21T06:32:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	go for it now - and no that would not stop it
2006-05-21T06:33:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	as CyaniCs|testing suggested there, that is a good idea, give it a shot and come back to us
2006-05-21T06:33:00.000Z	ompaul	jonuk	yes
