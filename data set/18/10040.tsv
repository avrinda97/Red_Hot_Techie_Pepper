2007-02-14T15:01:00.000Z	humbolto		how can I make the feisty kernel available in edgy? get linux-source package and recompile? get the bin package and install??
2007-02-14T15:01:00.000Z	humbolto		don't ask me why I want that, I have a perfectly good reason!
2007-02-14T15:02:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 the best way is to dist-upgrade to feisty
2007-02-14T15:02:00.000Z	humbolto	unop	but that's out of question until at least an rc release is out.
2007-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 you could force an install of the feisty kernel but it might bring in other feisty packages and then that might leave a lot of your edgy packages broken
2007-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	humbolto	unop	so, what is the BEST way?
2007-02-14T15:04:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 have you tried installing linux-image-2.6.19 ??
2007-02-14T15:04:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 manually i.e. ?
2007-02-14T15:05:00.000Z	humbolto	unop	no. is this available in edgy?
2007-02-14T15:06:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 sorry, that'd be linux-image-2.6.20 .. and no this is not available for edgy .. it's for feisty
2007-02-14T15:06:00.000Z	humbolto	unop	that's what I thought
2007-02-14T15:06:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=linux-image-2.6.20&searchon=names&subword=1&version=feisty&release=all
2007-02-14T15:07:00.000Z	humbolto	unop	I guess the best way would be to get linux-source-2.6.20 and recompile it with the debian or ubuntu magick in edgy?!
2007-02-14T15:07:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 or you could download and install the .deb from the repositories :)
2007-02-14T15:10:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 the latest might be this http://www.mirror.ac.uk/mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.20/linux-image-2.6.20-8-386_2.6.20-8.14_i386.deb
2007-02-14T15:13:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	 i wash my hands of any responsibility for any problems arising due to the install of this eh .. its not supported on edgy and you must be aware of the implications of doing this :)
2007-02-14T15:14:00.000Z	humbolto	unop	shouldn't it provide roughly the same kernel api?
2007-02-14T15:16:00.000Z	unop	humbolto	the kernel shouldnt be a problem .. its the package dependencies that might be a little tricky tho -- if you try and install this package manually and you dont get any complaints from dpkg, it ought to work quite well
