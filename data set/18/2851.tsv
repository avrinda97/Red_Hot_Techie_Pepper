2010-02-13T10:07:00.000Z	q0k		Hi. I've got a single partition with Windows XP. I want to split the disk into two partitions: one for Windows XP, one for Ubuntu. I right-click "my computer", choose "manage", "disk management"... Then I should right-click the free space on the disk, and see the "new partition" command in the menu.
2010-02-13T10:07:00.000Z	q0k		But I don't see any diagram with free / occupied space there... What should I do?
2010-02-13T10:07:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	You should do that from the ubuntu Live disk.
2010-02-13T10:08:00.000Z	q0k	carbm1	Microsoft Help says it's possible to do from "Disk Management", but I'll break my leg while trying to find how... I need your help.
2010-02-13T10:08:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	Only if its a Dynamic Drive... Don't mess with that kind of crap though.
2010-02-13T10:08:00.000Z	q0k		I haven't seen "sections" on my HD
2010-02-13T10:09:00.000Z	q0k		It is a Basic Disk, Microsoft Help says basic disks should be used for other OSs.
2010-02-13T10:10:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	You want to keep it a basic disk.  If you make it a dynamic disk Windows will do some funky stuff to it and you can't get it back to basic without a LOT of work. I would use the live ubuntu disk and use GPARTED from the System > Administration > GPARTED. Then run the installer.
2010-02-13T10:11:00.000Z	q0k		Has anybody ever done a new partition from Disk Management? I still think it possible. Or what Disk Management is, if not creating of new partitions?
2010-02-13T10:12:00.000Z	q0k		I mean Windows XP disk management
2010-02-13T10:13:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	Can you right click on the drive and then say Convert to Dynamic Drive?
2010-02-13T10:13:00.000Z	q0k	carbm1	if I make it a dynamic disk Windows will do some funky stuff to it and you can't get it back to basic without a LOT of work
2010-02-13T10:13:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	 but again. I wouldn't recommend you do that.
2010-02-13T10:15:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	Its not possible for Windows to resize its partition table while its active anyways. Its always safer to do it from a live cd or other media. Thats why GParted on the Ubuntu Live cd is great because your probably going to be using it to install Ubuntu anyways right?  Kind of a two for one deal.
2010-02-13T10:16:00.000Z	q0k		here: http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/dm_create_partitions.mspx?mfr=true "Right-click an unallocated region of a basic disk, and then click New Partition,"
2010-02-13T10:16:00.000Z	q0k		Where can I find the "unallocated region of a basic disk" ?
2010-02-13T10:17:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	 You probably don't have any unallocated space. It would be a grey area at the end.  Each partition is probably currently showing as a yellowish block and would say NTFS (Healthy).
2010-02-13T10:18:00.000Z	carbm1	q0k	That page only says that you can create and delete. Not resize.
