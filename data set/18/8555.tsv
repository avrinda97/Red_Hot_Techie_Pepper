2007-08-04T15:09:00.000Z	ribando		how do I recover my ubuntu feisty from a livecd if I messed up the file system and can't get to GRUB Menu?
2007-08-04T15:09:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Did you mess up the file system or just grub?
2007-08-04T15:12:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	i think i messed up the file system, but I when GRUB is starting up, it gives me an error, its not even letting me choose the OS that I want.yesterday at 4am I did "fsck /dev/ext3" because it was taking too long in the ubuntu loading screen, and ever since I did that, i having been able to even get to the GRUB Menu.
2007-08-04T15:13:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Put in the live CD and see if you did mess up the file system.  If you did mess up the file system you will have to re-install Ubuntu (that will fix grub to).  But don't re-install if you don't have to.
2007-08-04T15:14:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	i'm in the live cd now...lol...but i dont really know how to check if I messed up the filesystem
2007-08-04T15:15:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Type "mount" in a terminal to see if it is mounted.  If it is cd to the directory it is mounted to and see if you can read/write to the file sistem.
2007-08-04T15:16:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Or, you may be able to see it mounted on your desktop.  Been a while since I used the Live CD.
2007-08-04T15:19:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	i just did this: ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo blkid/dev/sda1: TYPE="ntfs" /dev/sda2: TYPE="swap" UUID="a9f15be7-49e5-498d-ba5a-d74e67439b00" /dev/sda3: UUID="55ae74a9-35a9-49fe-abc5-8515ac9d3222" SEC_TYPE="ext2" TYPE="ext3"
2007-08-04T15:19:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	I dont really know what that means
2007-08-04T15:21:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Type "mount | grep /dev/sda3" and see where it is mounted.
2007-08-04T15:23:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	it doesnt do anything when I typed "mount | grep /dev/sda3"
2007-08-04T15:24:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Ok, try this.  "cd /media", "sudo mkdir sda3", "sudo mount /dev/sda3 sda3"
2007-08-04T15:33:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	this is what I'm getting after typing the last command: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda3,       missing codepage or other error       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try       dmesg | tail  or so

2007-08-04T15:33:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	did u see the message i got from doing that?
2007-08-04T15:34:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	Yes, you didn't have to show it twice.  By the sounds of it you did mess up your file system if you can't mount the partition.  I would try a re-install of Ubuntu.
2007-08-04T15:36:00.000Z	ribando	MajorPayne	ok,thanks...sorry about the repetition.
2007-08-04T15:36:00.000Z	MajorPayne	ribando	It's ok.  And that is my best opinion.  You may be able to get away without a re-install.
