2005-03-29T11:37:00.000Z	HillTop		Anyone else have trouble with this link   http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39185092,00.htm      It blows away Firefox in Warty -- repeats anytime I click to it. But I can save the web page to hard disc and it read/edits in Nvu without trouble.
2005-03-29T11:37:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	Loads fine.
2005-03-29T11:37:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	In Hoary, that is.
2005-03-29T11:40:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	It's very easy to upgrade an installed system from Warty to Hoary.
2005-03-29T11:40:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	But you probably know that. :-)
2005-03-29T11:43:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	Different support libraries, perhaps.  And upgrading to Hoary is almost risk-free. :-)
2005-03-29T11:44:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	Mind you, it's very much my impression that Ubuntu is a truly excellent Linux distribution, good for newbies and experts alike.  I've been running Linux since 1993 and feel right at home in Ubuntu.
2005-03-29T11:45:00.000Z	HillTop	DarthFrog	 If I update to Hoary, will the extra programs I installed: Nvu, Acrobat Reader, etc. be OK or will their library connections be broken? :/    Oh!! Thanks Myrtti, that would explain that. :)
2005-03-29T11:46:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	They'll be fine.
2005-03-31T12:39:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	Go for it!  Let us know if you survive. :-)
2005-03-31T12:40:00.000Z	HillTop	DarthFrog	Aaak, Actually I'm not in Hoary now (pclinuxos) but I might just try it in the live CD next time it is up.
2005-03-31T16:39:00.000Z	HillTop	DarthFrog	calc, I tried The Famous Fork Bomb in Kubuntu Hoary livecd on a 200MH and it locked up in less than a second. Mouse, stuck, top in console stopped. ctrl-alt-backspace -- nothing.  :(
2005-04-01T17:01:00.000Z	HillTop	DarthFrog	calc, You there??
2005-04-01T17:02:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	Sometimes. :-)

2005-04-01T17:03:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	LOL!
2005-04-01T17:06:00.000Z	HillTop	DarthFrog	 Do you know if Ubuntu live has tohd=/dev/hda1    and fromhd=/dev/hda1    as KNOPPIX does?
2005-04-01T17:06:00.000Z	DarthFrog	HillTop	Sorry, no.
