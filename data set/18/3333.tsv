2010-02-05T19:38:00.000Z	meowbuntu	scunizi	just a persistant usb i am now trying to make an extended casper-rw (storage partition.
2010-02-05T19:39:00.000Z	scunizi	meowbuntu	why not use the tool built into ubuntu?
2010-02-05T19:39:00.000Z	meowbuntu	scunizi	that info saye edit something doesant say where the info is to edit
2010-02-05T19:40:00.000Z	scunizi	meowbuntu	looks like old stuff. I remember reading about casper several years ago.. ubuntu has a built in program to create a live usb.. also see unetbootin as another method of doing it.
2010-05-03T05:00:00.000Z	scunizi	meowbuntu	I'm running 8.04 on my laptop.. sound works but can be quirky.. sometimes Ihave to kill pulseaudio to get it working correctly
