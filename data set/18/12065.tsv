2006-06-02T15:15:00.000Z	Fujitsu	extern	Intel shouldn't get the naming rights to 64-bit as well as 32-bit! It is i386, remember.

2006-06-04T05:06:00.000Z	Fujitsu	extern	what does the script do?
2006-06-04T05:07:00.000Z	Fujitsu	extern	you should probably remove the sudo from the start of all the lines, and then just run the script using sudo.
2006-06-04T05:08:00.000Z	extern	Fujitsu	I want to put that file into the init.rd
