2010-10-09T21:50:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	it means you can't have free access to change the code of the driver.
2010-10-09T21:53:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	'sub-folders' in /dev/ are representations of the hardware devices
2010-10-09T21:53:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	you can't navigate through them
2010-10-09T21:54:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	you _can_ mount a device
2010-10-09T21:55:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	for example, if you have a second hard drive  that is not mounted called "/dev/sdb", you can mount it by creating a destination in /mnt ( sudo mkdir /mnt/newdrivename ) and then attaching that device there ( sudo mount /dev/sdb1/ /mnt/newdrivename )
2010-10-09T21:57:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	if you can see it in the gui, it is mounted somewhere already
2010-10-09T22:00:00.000Z	[thor]	nadav	check /media/  for already mounted drives >:D
2010-10-09T22:01:00.000Z	nadav	[thor]	aha I see, so their not actual partitions anymore, but folders
