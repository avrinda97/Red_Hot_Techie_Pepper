2008-05-25T08:01:00.000Z	kramer3d		can anyone help me?
2008-05-25T08:01:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	You could try to reconfigure X with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" from a terminal
2008-05-25T08:05:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	<ctrl><alt><f1> will do
2008-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	how do i get out of terminal and resume with installation?
2008-05-25T08:34:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	<ctrl><alt><f7>
2008-05-25T08:35:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	crap it says x server is now disabled , restard GDM when it is configured correctly
2008-05-25T08:36:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	you can restart gdm with from the terminal with "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
2008-05-25T08:45:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	sorry to bother you again but it just doesnt seem to work, let me repeat my problem so you dont have to scroll up: i have an onboard graphics card and an nvidia card installed
2008-05-25T08:45:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	how ever it does not recognize my nvidia card (or maybe it does i dk)
2008-05-25T08:46:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	so I would like to set the nvidia card as my default and get on with installation
2008-05-25T08:46:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	by get on with the installation, have you finished the basic install, and what to now add your own apps ?
2008-05-25T08:47:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	no i have not started install at all, i am stuck on the "Cannot load X server part"
2008-05-25T08:49:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	it might be better to, do the install in vesa mode.  then load the nvidia drivers after basic install.
2008-05-25T08:50:00.000Z	kramer3d	neil_d	how do i install in vesa mode? is that the safe graphics mode?
2008-05-25T08:51:00.000Z	neil_d	kramer3d	I think so.
