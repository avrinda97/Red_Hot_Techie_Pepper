2011-05-18T01:47:00.000Z	fructose		Anyone have experience installing VMware Player on a fresh install of 11.04? I'm wondering what works best and is easiest to install
2011-05-18T01:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	tried virtualbox?
2011-05-18T01:49:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	No. Can you easily download Windows images for it?
2011-05-18T01:50:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	download windows images? you need to own the iso and mount it in virtualbox to install it
2011-05-18T01:50:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	Can you store it and make copies at least?
2011-05-18T01:51:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	of the vm, sure
2011-05-18T01:51:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	So I could install Windows once, then make 3 copies and have 3 different Windows VMs?
2011-05-18T01:51:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	sure
2011-05-18T01:52:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	So why can't you download an image (legality aside)?
2011-05-18T01:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	that is the only barrier, legally
2011-05-18T01:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	we don't encourage or condone illegal activities here
2011-05-18T01:53:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	Under what country's laws?
2011-05-18T01:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	i'll let you figure that out, read the licenses that cover the software you wish to obtain
2011-05-18T01:55:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	The application of the licenses depend on the country you're in
2011-05-18T01:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	i'm not here to debate legalities, you know whether or not what you are doing is illegal, we just don't encourage those sort of activities here
2011-05-18T01:57:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	Well, if you can't settle on whether it is or isn't legal, I don't know how you settle on encouraging or discouraging it. I imagine you let people make the suggestion to install VLC all the time
2011-05-18T01:59:00.000Z	ThinkT510	fructose	you asked about vm's and i gave you a response, i hope it helps you
2011-05-18T02:01:00.000Z	fructose	ThinkT510	It did, thanks.
