2009-08-11T00:45:00.000Z	mshooshtari		how much does a canonical incident cost?
2009-08-11T00:46:00.000Z	mshooshtari		Can I "community trade" help for one problem for help with ?? for help with likewise-open5 ?
2009-08-11T00:48:00.000Z	mshooshtari		things work better with OpenSuse in my opinion, and with their build service, packages are built to work with the software and  you can get fixes, or new/backported software more easily
2009-08-11T00:50:00.000Z	mshooshtari		#ubuntu is a channel where everybody has questions and nobody has answers because it's famed as the easy linux, but when it doesn't work, nobody knows how to fix it unless you have $$$ for Canonical
2009-08-11T00:51:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	sure there are people with answers here
2009-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	er...no
2009-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	default users are NOT members of the audio group
2009-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	pulseaudio is the only member
2009-08-11T00:57:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	dapper's the only supported version that didnt ship with pulseaudio
2009-08-11T00:57:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	oh wait... no dapper's no longer supported on the desktop. there are no supported desktop verisons that dont have pulseaudio
2009-08-11T00:58:00.000Z	mshooshtari	maco	Why the choice for likewise-open?   both fedora, and opensuse have active directory integration without the need for a third party software.
2009-08-11T01:00:00.000Z	mshooshtari	maco	the reason is the support that likewise-open offers is, if you want support, buy something. So that lowers the level of user knowledge and support.
2009-08-11T01:00:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	what is likewise-open?
2009-08-11T01:01:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	why are you telling me about it?
2009-08-11T01:02:00.000Z	mshooshtari	maco	because it's supposed to cache your login, so if your not connected to the active directory network, you can still login to your computer.
2009-08-11T01:02:00.000Z	mshooshtari	maco	It's not doing that, and nobody really knows about what likewise-open is, yet able to support it.
2009-08-11T01:03:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	but why are you telling me about it?
2009-08-11T01:03:00.000Z	maco	mshooshtari	i didnt ask anything about Active Directory....i use kerberos
