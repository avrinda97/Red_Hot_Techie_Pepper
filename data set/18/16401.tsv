2004-12-28T13:46:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	the kde package is currently broken, use "kde-core" instead

2004-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	rvirani	Riddell	dude?
2004-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	fired?
2004-12-28T13:54:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	what are the failed dependencies?
2004-12-28T13:54:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	hotplug should load the drivers before network configuration
2004-12-28T13:55:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	but you can add a custom script to /etc/init.d and link to it from /etc/rc2.d
2004-12-28T14:11:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	what are the depency errors when you try to install kde-core?  and are you using hoary?
2004-12-28T14:18:00.000Z	rvirani	Riddell	so I basically cant get kde
2004-12-28T14:18:00.000Z	rvirani	Riddell	no using warty
2004-12-28T14:18:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	what are the errors it gives?
2004-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	you could try that.  what are the errors it gives?
2004-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	edit /etc/apt/sources.list  changing warty for hoary  then  sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install kde-core
2004-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	Riddell	rvirani	not long, doing a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade would take a long time and break stuff but you don't needs to do that
