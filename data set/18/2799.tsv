2011-05-02T00:13:00.000Z	Emylbus		my roommate closed my computer while I was updating to 11.04, which crashed the comp (my comp crashes when closed, an issue i haven't gotten time to fix yet) and now I can't boot into my ubuntu partition
2011-05-02T00:13:00.000Z	Emylbus		help?
2011-05-02T00:15:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	mount the partition, back up your data, download system iso, install.
2011-05-02T00:16:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	mount the partition in windows? when i install from the cd, will it be obvious what partitions to install to?
2011-05-02T00:18:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	the objective is to save whatever data you need before reinstallation, thats all
2011-05-02T00:18:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	I was wondering about the reinstallation process, since the computer has already been partitioned by the previous time I installed, I can just choose to install into the partitions that were made?
2011-05-02T00:19:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	if there is no valuable data, then you can skip this step
2011-05-02T00:19:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	i think i will skip it, nothing important was on there, all of it is luckily on my windows partition
2011-05-02T00:20:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	i assume you want to dual boot, yes?
2011-05-02T00:20:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	yessir
2011-05-02T00:20:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	alright, i think you can take off then
2011-05-02T00:21:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	you sure about dual booting though?
2011-05-02T00:22:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	use torrent
2011-05-02T00:23:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	the iso already installed from the website
2011-05-02T00:23:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	good. proceed
2011-05-02T00:24:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	just to make sure, I have a 64bit computer, i want the 64 bit of ubuntu right? is there any reason i would want to use the 32bit version?
2011-05-02T00:26:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Emylbus	64bit. be aware that you'll need install ai32-libs to obtain support to run 32bit apps
2011-05-02T00:26:00.000Z	Emylbus	kyubutsu	noted
