2008-08-11T17:59:00.000Z	FabParma		how access as root in gnome?
2008-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	what do you mean? do you want a gnome-session as root?
2008-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	FabParma	Tonehog	yes
2008-08-11T18:01:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	you're better off running applications using sudo or gnome-sudo (or whatever it's called)
2008-08-11T18:02:00.000Z	FabParma	Tonehog	the limit to log as root into X its a limit of desktop edition?
2008-08-11T18:03:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	it's safer to run root apps as root rather than the whole X Windows session
2008-08-11T18:04:00.000Z	FabParma	Tonehog	yes, i know very well. but if i need use root, does exist a way on Ubuntu desktop edition?
2008-08-11T18:04:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	you can do everything using gksudo without loggin in as root
2008-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	FabParma	Tonehog	ok, thanks. so its impossible to log as root. In server edition its possible?  thank you
2008-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	just use gksudo or kdesudo to run your apps
2008-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	it's just better security practice
2008-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	get used to that and you will have way less security issues
2008-08-11T18:07:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	That's why those were made
2008-08-11T18:07:00.000Z	FabParma	Tonehog	to me this in not security. its violation of freedom or the assumption that all users are unable to manage their os
2008-08-11T18:08:00.000Z	FabParma	Tonehog	anyway i know, its not your faul
2008-08-11T18:08:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	How is it a limitation to simply use a sudo wrapper to run a root-based application? That logic is false.
2008-08-11T18:09:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	I don't run Windows XP as Administrator because there's "runas..."
2008-08-11T18:09:00.000Z	Tonehog	FabParma	the same rule applies here in linux
