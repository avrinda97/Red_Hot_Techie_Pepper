2005-04-18T09:46:00.000Z	beowuff		I'm using Suse Linux Enterprise Edition 9 right now.
2005-04-18T09:46:00.000Z	beowuff		The problem is they are becoming the Microsoft of Linux.
2005-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	why?
2005-04-18T09:48:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	they are also pushing linux into enterprise. that's nice. no more talks with boss about `is it reliable'?
2005-04-18T09:49:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	Yes, it's nice to see more linux being used. I just wish that if they are going to release something for corps, and it has a gui that your supposed to use. Make it work...
2005-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	there's long way. linux have more choices in gui, which makes it inconsistent.
2005-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	otherwise, why bother with the gui?
2005-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	hm. you are still able to do anything with vim+cvs, gui is just for brave testers.
2005-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	Ah, but SLES9 is suppose to be designed to work "out of the box" with Yast. Every try their implimentation of LDAP? If something doesn't work right, first thing I do is go CLI and try to rip out LDAP. Usually fixes the problem.
2005-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	hm. i'm using suse. and SuseConfigs autoconfiguration often gives me clues about complicated things like LDAP and so.
2005-04-18T10:02:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	Hmmm... Thanks for the pointer to suseconfig. I'll have to check that out some more. Might help ease the pain of administration :-)
2005-04-18T10:03:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	n/p. BTW I think that with such system as SLES you are obliged to read docs carefully...
2005-04-18T10:04:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	Yeah. I haven't run suseconfig on this box yet, as I'm a bit timmid. But I'm putting together a test box right now that I can break.
2005-04-18T10:04:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	that's good :D 'test box to break'
2005-04-18T10:07:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	I've got an Athlon XP 2000+ at home running the k7 kernel. Haven't seen any errors. I'll check for this one at lunch.
2005-04-18T13:22:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	don't you know, that linux is sexy? :D
2005-04-18T13:23:00.000Z	beowuff	Shufla	yes, but how am I to explain that to my girlfriend?
2005-04-18T13:24:00.000Z	Shufla	beowuff	huh. don't you know, that linux zealots do not have g-f? :>
