2005-11-09T10:00:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	that will hopefully be a built-in feature for the next release
2005-11-09T10:01:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	yes, but this isn't knoppix is it?
2005-11-09T10:02:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	there is a livedvd available I believe that you can install from
2005-11-09T10:08:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	because ubuntu is awesome like that
2005-11-09T10:09:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	those aren't part of the default desktop installation, but they are available
2005-11-09T10:09:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	yes, but usually it's best *not* to just install any random deb you find
2005-11-09T10:10:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	there are tools that download the specific debs you need
2005-11-09T10:12:00.000Z	farruinn	thevishy	allows new users to test drive ubuntu before committing their machine to it
