2006-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	your video drivers?  if you can see stuff? :P
2006-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	depends on if you want 3d rendering
2006-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	well, sure, i can see stuff. That doesn't mean the best drivers are installed
2006-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	yes, 3d
2006-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2006-07-07T09:05:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	the wiki says I may already have accelerated 3d with the open drivers. How would I test this?
2006-07-07T09:06:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	yep
2006-07-07T09:06:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	would the other drivers benefit me in any way?
2006-07-07T09:07:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	try this: grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf | tail -1
2006-07-07T09:08:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	it shuld spit out something
2006-07-07T09:09:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	it should only spit out one line if i had it right:-/
2006-07-07T09:13:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	there are several listed there, one says Drivers "ati"
2006-07-07T09:13:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	the others say Drivers, followed by kdb mouse and wacom
2006-07-07T09:13:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	well, you're currently using the ati driver.  you may want to try the fglrx one which might give you a boost in performance
2006-07-07T09:14:00.000Z	orbin	Linuturk	see here if you want to try it: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2006-07-07T09:36:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	the fglrx driver screwed up my xserver
2006-07-07T09:37:00.000Z	Linuturk	orbin	i had to revert back to the ati driver
