2012-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	agamemnus		any ideas for mysql libs?
2012-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	agamemnus		just client libs
2012-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	agamemnus		i don't need a whole server
2012-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	agamemnus		what would the syntax on this be?
2012-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	or install aptitude
2012-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	what happens if you type mysql in a terminal ?
2012-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	agamemnus	Barnabas	it tells me where the program can be found
2012-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	could you post an output of uname -a
2012-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	where did you get your linux basic compiler?
2012-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	agamemnus	Barnabas	http://superb-sea2.dl.sourceforge.net/project/fbc/Binaries%20-%20Linux/FreeBASIC-0.23.0-linux.run
2012-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	have you googled (hard) for a real FreeBasic ubuntu repo?
2012-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	agamemnus	Barnabas	that's how I went from 20 compile errors to 1
2012-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	what you have now (your sh file) is not a debian / ubuntu repo
2012-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	your prime problem is the basic platform compability
2012-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	Barnabas	agamemnus	listen to itsnotabigtruck on this :-) you ARE creating problems for yourselves :-)
