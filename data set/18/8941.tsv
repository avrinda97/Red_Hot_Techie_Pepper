2007-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	loos		Hi, I'm looking at the wiki page NetworkPrintingFromWinXP and it talks about how to set the printer port in 5.10 and 6.06 but not 7.04. Anyone know where the CUPS port is set?
2007-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	what printer do you have?
2007-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	Brother HL-1850. Already installed locally, just want to print from my XP box
2007-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	would you like to share it with samba? like a network printer?
2007-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	That would be okay too, but I figured that cups would allow me to access it via an IP address
2007-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	like http://192.168.1.7/printers/myPrinter
2007-06-13T12:06:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	honestly i've always done the share with samba, specially if windows clients are involved
2007-06-13T12:08:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	either way, try this: System > Administration > Printing
2007-06-13T12:08:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	right-click your printer
2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	kay
2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	in the connection tab, you should have the "network printer" option
2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	I do, but I have the printer connected to the ubuntu box locally, I want the XP printer to use it as a network printer.
2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	Right now it says Local, should I change it to Netowrk?
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	yes, try that, then it should be visible on your local network
2007-06-13T12:17:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	Looks like all I had to do was enable global sharing under the Global Settings menu option
2007-06-13T12:18:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	Thanks very much for your help though
2007-06-13T12:18:00.000Z	loos	nanotaboada	It was greatly appreciated
2007-06-13T12:18:00.000Z	nanotaboada	loos	you're welcome!
