2007-01-16T13:34:00.000Z	Lice		is there a guide on how to install ubuntu from the disk?
2007-01-16T13:34:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	should be pretty straight forward, are you having trouble?
2007-01-16T13:35:00.000Z	Lice		havnt tested and do not know how to do
2007-01-16T13:36:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	boot up with the cd in (bios configured to boot the cd) and you should start right in to the install
2007-01-16T13:36:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	it
2007-01-16T13:36:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	is pretty much like windows xp
2007-01-16T13:36:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	asks you simple questions and such
2007-01-16T13:37:00.000Z	Lice	White_Lightning	well i've tried to burn it to CD but havnt succeded due to bad program that ruins my cd's while burning..so i wanna install in from the harddisk
2007-01-16T13:37:00.000Z	Lice	White_Lightning	and i do not know how to install linux or xp from the harddisk
2007-01-16T13:38:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	ah I see what you're talking about. Are you running windows right now?
2007-01-16T13:38:00.000Z	Lice		yes
2007-01-16T13:39:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	linux will reformat the hard drive (at least part of it, whatever) to install, so you can't install without booting the CD, windows won't allow it
2007-01-16T13:39:00.000Z	Lice		:/
2007-01-16T13:39:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	you can get a free ubuntu disk mailed to you (postal mail)
2007-01-16T13:40:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	again, from the ubuntu website
2007-01-16T13:40:00.000Z	Lice		okey i'll do that then
2007-01-16T13:40:00.000Z	White_Lightning	Lice	cool
2007-01-16T13:40:00.000Z	Lice	White_Lightning	thanks
