2008-05-22T22:27:00.000Z	JonathanD		odd...
2008-05-22T22:27:00.000Z	JonathanD		I'm trying to do an alt-install
2008-05-22T22:27:00.000Z	JonathanD		keyboard works in busybox shells, but not on the installer screen.
2008-05-22T22:29:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	That is rather odd....
2008-05-22T22:30:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	I've been trying to get this box going most of the day :p
2008-05-22T22:31:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	it's working after a reboot
2008-05-22T22:31:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	Good, because I was stumped.
2008-05-22T22:31:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	seriously. everything but the installer worked. only capslock, etc, worked on installer.
2008-12-20T01:47:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	I have to wonder if there isn't another way to authenticate.
2008-12-20T01:39:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	Indeed, thats exactly what happens.
2008-12-20T01:40:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	any idea how I can get ubuntu to qualify?
2008-12-20T01:42:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	I've never gotten my linux computer at work to properly work on our websense controlled internet access. I'm not sure if authenticating to AD will do it for a Linux machine.
2008-12-20T01:42:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	thats a shame :(
2008-12-20T01:42:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	I didn't spend that much time on it though.
2008-12-20T01:42:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	I have other means to get around it, but I'd rather do it correctly.
2008-12-20T01:42:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	Perhaps you can tunnel your traffic through your Windows PC?
2008-12-20T01:43:00.000Z	JonathanD	Pici	I have full rights to the websense admin console, if I going that route I'll exlude the IP.
2008-12-20T01:44:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanD	Oh, that works. iirc, there is also a client application that can run on windows computers if they are not on AD.  I didn't have access to that file, but perhaps that can run under wine.  I don't think there is a linux native binary for it.
