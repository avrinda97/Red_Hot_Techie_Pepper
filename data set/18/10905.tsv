2007-03-14T16:17:00.000Z	Trixsey		ye
2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	Trixsey		I pasted it
2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	Trixsey		"f you open this file, the file might present a security risk to your system. "
2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	Trixsey		was what it said
2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	Trixsey		I never said mplayer says that
2007-03-14T16:20:00.000Z	Trixsey		which IMHO is madness
2007-03-14T16:20:00.000Z	Trixsey		nor do their extensions
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		they all differ
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		and I got hundreds of them
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		all over the place
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	a shell script. call `file`, if it's QT, rename to "avi"
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	debian has nautilus too? you've been given a solution.
2007-03-14T16:23:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	better solution: tell nautilus team to ignore file extentions. or tell the people you download your pirated movies from to use better codecs
2007-03-14T16:26:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	then go through and fix all your extentions. .avi, .mpeg, .mov, .rm, and get the output from `file`
2007-06-15T14:27:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	because it depends on "java", and GCJ provides "java". did you already install another java package? sun's i recommend
2007-06-15T14:27:00.000Z	Trixsey	preaction	I already have suns java, but it still forces an install of GCJ
2007-06-15T14:28:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	file a bug against the package, it's the maintainer's fault
2007-06-15T14:29:00.000Z	preaction	Trixsey	look for "update-alternatives"
