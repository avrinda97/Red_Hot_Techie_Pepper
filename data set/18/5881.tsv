2008-12-22T01:28:00.000Z	tct13		hello, i have a problem I cannot send email from my computer, using the account on my mail server
2008-12-22T01:29:00.000Z	tct13		on server i use ubuntu server  + postfix
2008-12-22T01:29:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	check tail -f /var/log/mail.log  while trying to send
2008-12-22T01:32:00.000Z	tct13	LTL	i checked and there is no line of smtp
2008-12-22T01:33:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	when you installed postfix did you set it 'local only'?
2008-12-22T01:35:00.000Z	tct13	LTL	what should i try?
2008-12-22T01:35:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	does local mail work ok?
2008-12-22T01:36:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	is your fqdn set right in main.cf i think it is
2008-12-22T01:40:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	you're probably aware but a mailserver is tricky, check this out: http://www.postfix.org/documentation.html
2008-12-22T01:40:00.000Z	tct13	LTL	i am connecting succesfullu with telnet to from localhost on port 25
2008-12-22T01:41:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	your /etc/postfix/master.cf needs tweaking. http://www.postfix.org/documentation.html
2008-12-22T01:41:00.000Z	tct13	LTL	how do I change the fqdn for smtp?
2008-12-22T01:42:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	for a start change mynetworks, but thats the tip of the iceberg
2008-12-22T01:45:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	your wan port 25 is closed but until you are secure, keep it closed but you can test it that way ;p
2008-12-22T01:46:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	can/can't cannot
2008-12-22T01:48:00.000Z	tct13	LTL	thanks for advice but I don;t know where to start from
2008-12-22T01:49:00.000Z	LTL	tct13	running a mailserver open to the net is asking for trouble. you need to study postfix
2008-12-22T04:29:00.000Z	tct13	LTL	now i can connect from the same network with telnet on port 25
