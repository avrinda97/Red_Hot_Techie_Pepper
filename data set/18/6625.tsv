2008-07-30T08:46:00.000Z	Scorp_		Hey, can someone help me with the Card Reader ?? I need to copy my photographs to my PC..
2008-07-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	what problems are you encountering
2008-07-30T08:48:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	Its basically that no action is happening when i connect the card reader... Is it not plug and play???
2008-07-30T08:49:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	what type of card reader is it? in that I mean how does it connect to your computer, and what brand is it?
2008-07-30T08:49:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	Its a Tech-com card reader which works on USB 2.0
2008-07-30T08:50:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	have you googled for instructions on it? to help you with this that's what I'd be doing anyway...
2008-07-30T08:50:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	I tried, cudnt find any instructions... are they there ???
2008-07-30T08:51:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	I don't know, I guess I'll look. any model numbers you can give me?
2008-07-30T08:51:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	Its a generic stuf.. not really a big brand..
2008-07-30T08:54:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	either I'm reading this wrong, or they only have drivers for windows 98: http://www.techcomindia.com/home.php?vaction=download
2008-07-30T08:54:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	Yeah, cuz after that it works plug and play... ;)
2008-07-30T08:56:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	have you checked to make sure the usb port you're plugging it into is working correctly? what version of ubuntu are you running?
2008-07-30T08:56:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	I'm running Hardy heron.. How do i check if the usb is workin ?? One thing is that the Tech-com thing is geting power.. What else do i check ??
2008-07-30T08:58:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	USB is working cuz i can connect my printer to it. But the USB Card Reader is not getting recognized on ubuntu.
2008-07-30T09:00:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	I don't know what to tell you - my card reader works - and it's plug and play, and I don't see any drivers or tutorials. sorry...
2008-07-30T09:00:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	When u connect the card reader, what happens next ?? does it mount to /media or something else ??
2008-07-30T09:01:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	Scorp_	I don't have a card here to test it with at the moment but iirc the slot shows up under Nautilus' "computer" view, and it pops up just like a usb flash drive would
2008-07-30T09:02:00.000Z	Scorp_	Mr_Bunny_	Ok.. I'll see what i can do. Thanks..
