2007-11-19T05:21:00.000Z	installing-mytht		gamma problem with the monitor,, I understand it is a common problem in Gutsy,, I've noticed other bugs as well,, has anyone had this problem
2007-11-19T05:21:00.000Z	installing-mytht		!gamma
2007-11-19T05:21:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	what is your issue?
2007-11-19T05:22:00.000Z	installing-mytht	choudesh	thanks,, the monitor is too bright ('it physically set to the lowest setting but still everything appears white)
2007-11-19T05:22:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	what kernel/video card do you have?
2007-11-19T05:23:00.000Z	installing-mytht	choudesh	 I just installed Gutsey over Dapper,,  I'm using 7.10. The monitor is a generic LCD
2007-11-19T05:24:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	do you know which video card you have? if not that is fine - we can use the generic method
2007-11-19T05:25:00.000Z	installing-mytht	choudesh	I'm afraid not..
2007-11-19T05:25:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	ok - open terminal and type 'sudo xgamma -gamma 0.5'
2007-11-19T05:25:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	think should bring the gamma a bit - if you see no change then it isn't a gamma problem
2007-11-19T05:26:00.000Z	installing-mytht	choudesh	 That helped,, the font is darker,, and I think the number of colors were reduced
2007-11-19T05:27:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	hmmm...
2007-11-19T05:27:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	sudo cat /proc/acpi/video/GFX0/LCD/brightness
2007-11-19T05:27:00.000Z	installing-mytht	choudesh	taking it to 0.2 make's it look almost normal
2007-11-19T05:27:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	tell me what it returns
2007-11-19T05:28:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	nevermind - that last thing won't work.
2007-11-19T05:28:00.000Z	installing-mytht	choudesh	 after the video directory I have no more files
2007-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	choudesh	installing-mytht	yea - I kinda figured. play around with xgamma till you find a good setting.
