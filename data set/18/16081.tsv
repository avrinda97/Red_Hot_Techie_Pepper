2005-11-18T13:36:00.000Z	sewoyl		the overloaded Konqueror's GUI makes me feel bad I like clean and sleek design
2005-11-18T13:38:00.000Z	sewoyl		oh I noticed that Ubuntu won't install properly if chosing the wifi ipw2200bg as default nic in setup
2005-11-18T13:38:00.000Z	sewoyl		any idea why?
2005-11-18T13:40:00.000Z	sewoyl		anybody got wifi working in breezy?
2005-11-18T13:40:00.000Z	ushooz	sewoyl	yes
2005-11-18T14:00:00.000Z	ushooz	sewoyl	nope. My Toshiba has its wireless as eth1 and wired as eth0
2005-11-18T14:01:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	my acer too
2005-11-18T14:02:00.000Z	ushooz	sewoyl	try iwconfig and make sure those setting are correct
2005-11-18T14:03:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	it seems correct
2005-11-18T14:04:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	hmm do I have to specify the wifi access point as "default gateway" or the wired router 'beneath' it ?
2005-11-18T14:04:00.000Z	ushooz	sewoyl	depends on how you have things set up.
2005-11-18T14:05:00.000Z	ushooz	sewoyl	more than likely the router but it all depends if your access point is acting as a router itself as well
2005-11-18T14:06:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	no its actually a router with any routing/dhcp disabled
2005-11-18T14:06:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	so basicallywifi router turned access point
2005-11-18T14:06:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	works fine in windows
2005-11-18T14:07:00.000Z	ushooz	sewoyl	I would do ipconfig /all in windows and make sure your linux setting match
2005-11-18T14:08:00.000Z	sewoyl	ushooz	thats a good idea thanks I'll try that!
