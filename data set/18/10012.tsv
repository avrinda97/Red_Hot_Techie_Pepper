2007-04-26T08:34:00.000Z	Tom47	ssinghi	did you check the cd for errors
2007-04-26T08:35:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	nope
2007-04-26T08:35:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	how do I do that?
2007-04-26T08:36:00.000Z	Tom47	ssinghi	it may be then that there is an error on the cd .... when you boot up from t initially use the menu option to validate the cd
2007-04-26T08:39:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	i'll try that, but still can i use the CD partially to update some of the packages, my Internet connection is slow, and can't afford to download the iso image once again
2007-04-26T08:40:00.000Z	Tom47	ssinghi	did you download and burn the cd originally?
2007-04-26T08:40:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	yes, i did that
2007-04-26T08:40:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	yes
2007-04-26T08:43:00.000Z	Tom47	ssinghi	did you see that?
2007-04-26T08:43:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	thanks a lot, will try that
2007-04-26T08:43:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	your reply, yes i did
2007-04-26T08:43:00.000Z	Tom47	ssinghi	always check urnt cds before trying to install or upgrade from them
2007-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	the cd has no errors, i verified the integrity of it,
2007-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	ssinghi	Tom47	this is the error which I get: Sub-process gpgv returned an error code (2), W:Signature verification failed for: /cdrom/dists/feisty/Release.gpg
2007-04-26T09:46:00.000Z	Tom47	ssinghi	.... sorry i cannot help with that issue ...
