2010-11-26T23:03:00.000Z	masterme120		How do I change which channel the volume manager applet adjusts in 10.10?
2010-11-26T23:05:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 which sound card do you have?
2010-11-26T23:05:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	it's an integrated one.  How would I figure that out?
2010-11-26T23:07:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 open a terminal and type    alsamixer    the name and model of the card should show up in the upper left
2010-11-26T23:08:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	HDA ATI SB for card and VIA VT1708S for chip.
2010-11-26T23:08:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 and if you notice in alsamixer..you should have a series of sliders
2010-11-26T23:09:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	yeah, I've used it before
2010-11-26T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 ah ok
2010-11-26T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 and you want to do what now?
2010-11-26T23:10:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	change which channel the volume manager applet adjusts
2010-11-26T23:11:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	  how many channels does your card support?
2010-11-26T23:11:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	7.1
2010-11-26T23:12:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 mm  I have a similar card but gnerally just adjust in alsamixer... there are gui frontends for that  as well as a  pulseaudio systemtic  graphic equalizer
2010-11-26T23:22:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	The original problem was that I can't adjust the volume through the "gnome-volume-control" applet.   I have headphones connected to a port on the back, and the volume only changes when I adjust PCM or surround channels, but the volume manager applet is adjusting the Front Master channel.
2010-11-26T23:23:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 ooo ... mmm  have you tried   alsamixergui
2010-11-26T23:23:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	  I am kind of suggesting the things I have tired ,,, I am definitly not a linux sound expert,,,you could try  #alsa  and or  #pulseaudio channels
2010-11-26T23:25:00.000Z	masterme120	coz_	I went here because it's specifically the applet.  You used to be able to change which channel it adjusted in the sound preferences dialogue, but it's not there any more.
2010-11-26T23:26:00.000Z	coz_	masterme120	 understood...  would still try both of those channels and let them know that gnome no longer has that options in sound dialog
