2006-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	sorush21	patrick52222	that will try to fix apt-get ... no install any thing.. -f means fix
2006-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	patrick52222	sorush21	does nt do anything
2006-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	sorush21	patrick52222	I would recommend that you use kopete.. rather than amsn.. you can have video chat and voice chat in kopete , it also fully supports yahoo..
2006-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	sorush21	patrick52222	but where is this package comming form..
2006-04-01T10:09:00.000Z	patrick52222	sorush21	the amsn is coming of thier site as it says i need to upgrade the newer amsn, where do i get kopete
2006-04-01T10:10:00.000Z	sorush21	patrick52222	kopete is part of kubuntu.. all you need to do is to instlal kubuntu-desktop from your synaptic.. and select GDM when asked to do so..
2006-04-01T10:10:00.000Z	sorush21	patrick52222	before you do that tell me where you got the package.. is it the amsn site.. /
