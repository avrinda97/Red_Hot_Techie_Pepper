2006-11-11T08:52:00.000Z	anthonykid		am i the only one here with Mac?
2006-11-11T08:53:00.000Z	anthonykid		from what i've seen, ubuntu seems very limited :-/
2006-11-11T08:53:00.000Z	anthonykid		i hope
2006-11-11T08:54:00.000Z	anthonykid		i mean, vital applications such as the CS2 suite, any Macromedia apps, media applications... they just don't seem to be there
2006-11-11T08:54:00.000Z	anthonykid		but i did hear that CS3 will be linux compatible :-D
2006-11-11T08:55:00.000Z	variant	anthonykid	you did? where did you hear that?
2006-11-11T08:55:00.000Z	anthonykid	variant	digg.com
2006-11-11T08:56:00.000Z	variant	anthonykid	it's not ubuntu or free software that's limmited, it's the producers of the non free software that is not compatible that has limmitations. There are no limmits to what free software can be made to do.
2006-11-11T08:56:00.000Z	variant	anthonykid	digg ey? reliable source of information that one...
2006-11-11T08:56:00.000Z	anthonykid	variant	yeah, i figured that... ah well
2006-11-11T08:57:00.000Z	anthonykid	variant	digg is rarely incorrect, from what i've seen in the past few months
2006-11-11T09:00:00.000Z	variant	anthonykid	there is a cs3 version for intel macs, cant see any info about a gnu/linux version though
