2012-10-21T12:50:00.000Z	WalterN		hmm... I seem to have serious Xorg issues with my AMD HD6870 video card... here is pastebin of xorg.0.log   http://pastebin.com/kZnPCWxQ
2012-10-21T12:51:00.000Z	WalterN		seems anything done with 3D is extremely sluggish.. 2D related stuff seems to work fine
2012-10-21T12:51:00.000Z	WalterN		mind you, this is with ubuntu 12.10 64bit live disk
2012-10-21T12:52:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	Perhaps you should install first and then see what happens then
2012-10-21T12:53:00.000Z	WalterN	islandmonkey	I kinda dont want to if video is going to be this issue-y.. heh
2012-10-21T12:53:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	Well, there is only one way to find out, because you can't really do much while on the live disk
2012-10-21T12:54:00.000Z	WalterN	islandmonkey	is it a commonish issue though in general with 12.10?
2012-10-21T12:54:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	Not on my NVIDIA GT540M
2012-10-21T12:56:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	Well, all I can say is install and go from there, try using fglrx
2012-10-21T12:57:00.000Z	WalterN	islandmonkey	thats something I really would rather not do (use the AMD drivers...)
2012-10-21T13:00:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	Well then there is not much you can do. Sometimes, you need to take risks :)
2012-10-21T13:00:00.000Z	WalterN	islandmonkey	its just when I want to get things done, I do it on linux.. ubuntu is my main desktop OS
2012-10-21T13:02:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	Then, you will be stuck
2012-10-21T13:02:00.000Z	WalterN	islandmonkey	hay, should I go with btrfs? :3
2012-10-21T13:03:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	No, ext4
2012-10-21T13:40:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	OK, tried using fglrx?
2012-10-21T13:41:00.000Z	WalterN	islandmonkey	no... but hold on.. I dont see the error in the log files
2012-10-21T13:42:00.000Z	islandmonkey	WalterN	But try it anyway if the sluggishness is still evident
