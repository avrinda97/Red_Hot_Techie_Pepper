2009-07-26T18:39:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	are you there still?
2009-07-26T18:39:00.000Z	unop	maverick	 hmm, this is bizarre, before ppp0 gets an address eth0 has one but not after, moreover after ppp0 gets an address a route for 10.0.0.0 goes out of ppp0 (which has nothing to do with the ppp0 address)
2009-07-26T18:40:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	this has been same for me in many other linuxes including ubuntu from 5.10...
2009-07-26T18:40:00.000Z	unop	maverick	same as in, you lan doesn't work?
2009-07-26T18:40:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	ya
2009-07-26T18:41:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	meaning my lan dosent work when i connect to the internet, unlike in xp
2009-07-26T18:41:00.000Z	unop	maverick	well, we know why it doesn't work - something is misconfiguring your IP addressing and routing. I wonder if this is a bug.
2009-07-26T18:42:00.000Z	unop	maverick	did you do anything special when setting up the PPP connection?
2009-07-26T18:42:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	it happens only in linux, even fedora and stuff..
2009-07-26T18:42:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	no i just put my username pwd and service name in dsl box...
2009-07-26T18:43:00.000Z	unop	maverick	can you pastebin the output of   cat /etc/network/interfaces
2009-07-26T18:43:00.000Z	unop		?
2009-07-26T18:43:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	trying to find a solution to this for 5 years, only thing preventing me from using linux

2009-07-26T18:45:00.000Z	unop	maverick	 hmm, is your PPP connection a dial-up connection/modem?
2009-07-26T18:46:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	no its not, its just broadband, no router stuff, connects via pppoe..
2009-07-26T18:48:00.000Z	maverick_	unop	when in previous versions, ubuntu did not have the gui tool for pppoe, i used to use rp-pppoe, used to face the same problem
