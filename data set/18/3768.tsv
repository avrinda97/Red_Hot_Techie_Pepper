2010-06-09T02:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	are you sure about that % or was that a typo?
2010-06-09T02:29:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	yes, before the s you need to specify the region of the document to search, or it will only do the current line
2010-06-09T02:29:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	% is for the whole document
2010-06-09T02:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	cool thanks
2010-06-11T07:57:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/desktop-login.ogg although if you just want to disable the sound it is activated in System/Preferences/Startup Applications/Gnome login sound
2010-06-11T07:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	thank you!
2010-06-11T07:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	i'm planning on changing it for HAL saying "I am completly operational and all my circuts are functioning perfectly" :)
2010-06-11T07:59:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	hehe, sounds great
2010-06-11T08:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	thanks - works perfectly
2010-07-28T01:02:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	any reason not to use the ${acpitemp} variable instead?, otherwise as someone said the other day, you need to modify the grep to match the correct line since your output doesn't have temp2 anywhere
2010-07-28T01:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	it's the modifying the grep that I'd love some input on ;)
2010-07-28T01:03:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	depends on which line you want, could replace it with 'CPU Temperature' or any of the text at the start of the lines, may need to fiddle with the cut too
2010-07-28T01:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	thanks
2010-07-28T01:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	thanks now have working CPU temperature!  3rd time was the charm!
2010-07-28T01:13:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	excellent!
2010-09-06T23:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	that way my thought as well, but i doubt it will work for a menu
2010-09-06T23:31:00.000Z	trism	ZykoticK9	I figured you authorized it like with twitter, in the gwibber-accounts window, which is ALT draggable here
2010-09-06T23:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trism	my bad then ;)
