2006-10-25T08:33:00.000Z	njan	LiN01	that modem is supported under linux, but it's not massively easy to get working, you may find yourself fiddling.

2006-10-25T08:33:00.000Z	LiN01		hmmm damz
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	somebody from a belgium linux group told me that ubuntu can install it easly with a Wizard ...
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	he told me i have to look into the internet options
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	njan	LiN01	possibly, I haven't done it.
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	njan	LiN01	not in ubuntu, anyway..
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	njan	LiN01	last time I configured one of those there was fiddling required.
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	pfff
2006-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	what is fiddling ?
2006-10-25T08:35:00.000Z	njan	LiN01	fiddling is what the page I linked you to tells you how to do.
2006-10-25T08:36:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	okay thank you very much, last question when i will try to install this driver my modem will not get broken right ?
2006-10-25T08:36:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	i don't have to install software on the hardware of my modem right?
2006-10-25T08:36:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	its only software ..
2006-10-25T08:36:00.000Z	njan	LiN01	it's unlikely, but I couldn't tell you for sure. Free Software doesn't come with guarantees. :)
2006-10-25T08:36:00.000Z	LiN01	njan	okay i will see what i can do thanks for the help
