2007-11-06T03:50:00.000Z	kirika		for some reason on my system monitor my swap memory and regular memory seem to be switched and my box is running sluggish is there a way to change the specs for memory, i havent done this in a long time so forgive me
2007-11-06T03:51:00.000Z	kirika		sorry i was trying to ask on line but it switched to this
2007-11-06T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	what is wrong? memory or the system monitor? all your memory isn't detected?
2007-11-06T03:53:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	well the only clue as to why it running slow is when i look at the system monitor to see whats running my swap memory looks like it should be switched with user memory
2007-11-06T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	hmm.. how can you tell? what are the numbers? or you are looking at the graphs?
2007-11-06T03:57:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	user memory shows im using 125 of 218MB (57%) and swap says im using 35 of 1004 (4%)
2007-11-06T03:58:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	 i think it should be the other way around right
2007-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	well.. do you have 1 GB of memory installed? or 218 MB?
2007-11-06T04:00:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	i only have 351MB so it looks wierd to me, this only happened after i switched from ubuntu to Xubuntu
2007-11-06T04:00:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	check the first page in the system monitor.. "system".. at that page there should be something about memory
2007-11-06T04:00:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	oh.. using xubuntu... sorry.. don't know what the system monitor looks like there
2007-11-06T04:02:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	I don't know why your memory isn't correctly detected.. I would expect to see 125MB of 320 MB user memory used.. don't know what could change that.. my computer has all it's memory available as user memory.
2007-11-06T04:02:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	it says i only have 218MB so im going to take out the other stick since it may be bad
2007-11-06T04:02:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	tried to run memtest?
2007-11-06T04:02:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	 yea i did that yesterday it stalled
2007-11-06T04:03:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	 so i will do it again when i take out the new stick and see what happens thanks
2007-11-06T04:03:00.000Z	Slart	kirika	you're welcome and good luck in getting that memory working
2007-11-06T04:03:00.000Z	kirika	Slart	thank you, i really appreciate it
