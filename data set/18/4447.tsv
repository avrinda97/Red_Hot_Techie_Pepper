2011-05-07T13:36:00.000Z	bj0		i installed ntp but it doesn't seem to be setting the clock, the offset just grows continuously
2011-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	It will in time, but if you want to set it now, do   ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2011-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	   sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2011-05-07T13:39:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	thanks, i tried that, it worked when i ran it, but then the offsett just started growing again
2011-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	and after a day it is off by almost an hour
2011-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	You can tweak the hardware clock and I would guess that is the trouble.  Just a sec.
2011-05-07T13:41:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	it seems like the ntpd isn't setting the clock at all, it's pulling the right info from other servers
2011-05-07T13:45:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	You can sync the hardware clock with hwclock      hwclock -w
2011-05-07T13:45:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	sudo hwclock -w
2011-05-07T13:46:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	There is a way to adjust the speed of the hardware clock and I'm searching for info on that.  Still looking ....
2011-05-07T13:47:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	so what's the problem? ntpd can't keep up with the hw clock?
2011-05-07T13:47:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	I'm sorry, I did not say it right above, let me re-write the above comment
2011-05-07T13:48:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	You can sync the system time to the hardware clock with command:  hwclock -w
2011-05-07T13:48:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	i ran ntpdate again, then did that hwclock command, then started ntpd
2011-05-07T13:55:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	Well, I've not found what I was looking for, but I read once that there is a way to slow down or speed up the hardware clock.  You could give me  your email address and I could send it to you later if I find it, or you can just search for the info on your own.   But for now, you could set a crontab job to reset the time peroidically, like 2 or 3 times a day, but that's a terribly ugly workaround.
2011-05-07T13:55:00.000Z	usr13	bj0	Let me look again
2011-05-07T13:56:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	thanks, i'll keep looking, if i get desperate enough i might try the ntp mailing lists :)
2011-05-07T14:30:00.000Z	bj0	usr13	were you talking about "adjtimex", mentioned in this thread: http://fixunix.com/ntp/67593-ntp-high-jitter-reject-condition.html
