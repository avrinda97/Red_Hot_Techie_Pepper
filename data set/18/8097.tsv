2007-09-30T13:36:00.000Z	hellhound_		how do you edit the kernel config?
2007-09-30T13:36:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	depends on what you mean with kernel config
2007-09-30T13:38:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	I need to enable "CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER" "CONFIG_USB_USBNET" and "CONFIG_USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST" in the kernel
2007-09-30T13:39:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	those are enabled in the ubuntu config
2007-09-30T13:46:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	when I conpile usb-rndis-lite i get "ERROR: Module rndis_host does not exist in /proc/modules" and "ERROR: Module cdc_ether does not exist in /proc/modules" and "ERROR: Module usbnet does not exist in /proc/modules"
2007-09-30T13:46:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	you may need to modprobe the modules
2007-09-30T13:47:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	I get "FATAL: Module usbnet not found"  same for the other two as well
2007-09-30T13:48:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	are you using stock ubuntu kernels?
2007-09-30T13:50:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	yes i am running 2.6.20-16-generic
2007-09-30T13:51:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	well, it exists in there: /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/kernel/drivers/usb/net/usbnet.ko
2007-09-30T13:52:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	actually when i go to that directory i do not see usbnet.ko
2007-09-30T13:53:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	then something fishy is going on on your system
2007-09-30T13:54:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	that is why i wanted to check the kernel config to see why they were not enabled.... do you know how?
2007-09-30T13:54:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	look in /boot/config-*
2007-09-30T13:55:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	those are the kernel images aren't they.  I used to Gentoo and i could simply do "make menuconfig"
2007-09-30T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	the config-* files are the configs
2007-09-30T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	hellhound_	and ubuntu isn't gentoo, don't forget that :)
2007-09-30T13:57:00.000Z	hellhound_	Seveas	yes I know the two are different... I like ubuntu much better and this has been my only problem
