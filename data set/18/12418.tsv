2006-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	Warbo		Who wanted to boot from CD/floppy to preserve their MBR?
2006-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	Zer0
2006-09-24T13:58:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	E16 doesn't have composite support really
2006-09-24T13:59:00.000Z	Warbo	kitche	Composite as in translucency and shadows
2006-09-24T14:00:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	that's not really composite to be exact at least for e16
2006-09-24T14:28:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	that's what AIGLX is
2006-09-24T14:29:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	AIGLX is Xorg 7.1 it's built in
2006-09-24T14:29:00.000Z	Warbo	kitche	But you don't need to use it to get 3D desktop with Nvidia
2006-09-24T14:29:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	yes you do
2006-09-24T14:30:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	since right now Nvidia only supports XGL for 3d destktop that looks nice at least
2006-09-24T14:31:00.000Z	Warbo	kitche	http://linuxrevolution.blogspot.com/index.html (second post down)
2006-09-24T14:32:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	just so you know the person that made that post is an idiot since aiglx or XGL is needed to run compiz
2006-09-24T14:33:00.000Z	Warbo	kitche	I'll be in #ubuntu-xgl if you want to carry on
2006-10-03T06:04:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	AiGLX is X
2006-10-03T06:05:00.000Z	Warbo	kitche	"xorg-air"
2006-12-25T11:52:00.000Z	kitche	Warbo	your probably using bad dns servers
