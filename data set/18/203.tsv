2012-06-12T23:23:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		I'm on ubuntu-machine, and want to stream video to iPhone and PC..for that I've to setup some local-webserver…so I need suggestions, how and which server should I go for?
2012-06-12T23:24:00.000Z	A0D	abhinavmehta	vlc has a media server, xbmc also has options for this
2012-06-12T23:24:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	A0D	thank you. :)
2012-06-12T23:24:00.000Z	A0D	abhinavmehta	np. let me know if you need further help
2012-06-12T23:29:00.000Z	A0D	abhinavmehta	xbmc can host a regular media sharing server, but idk if iphone needs a seperate app to acsess such servers
2012-06-12T23:30:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	A0D	ok.
2012-06-12T23:37:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	A0D	any good-read-suggestion url/blog to setup xmbc media center on ubuntu?
2012-06-12T23:38:00.000Z	A0D	abhinavmehta	not on hand, but a quick trip to google should turn up plenty
2012-06-12T23:39:00.000Z	A0D	abhinavmehta	if all else fails, setting up a simple file server and streaming media through that would work
2012-06-12T23:40:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	A0D	hmm..but googling gives tons of results, which makes me confusing..anyways, I'll try some hacks, let see… thanks BTW.
2012-06-12T23:41:00.000Z	A0D	abhinavmehta	np. For some reason I remeber xbmc starting up a server automatically. I dont remeber setting it up
2012-06-12T23:42:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	A0D	ok.
