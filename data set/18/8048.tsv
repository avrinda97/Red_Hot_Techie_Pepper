2007-10-10T13:29:00.000Z	Javid^		I already did an aptitude hold on all of them
2007-10-10T13:30:00.000Z	Javid^		The package is in the main repos. That wouldn't be wise
2007-10-10T13:31:00.000Z	Javid^		yes
2007-10-10T13:31:00.000Z	Javid^		and it's firefox
2007-10-10T13:31:00.000Z	Javid^		There's a PPC ubuntu feisty
2007-10-10T13:31:00.000Z	Javid^		nope
2007-10-10T13:32:00.000Z	Javid^		the package in question IS an equivs-made dummy package I made just to get apt to shut the hell up
2007-10-10T13:33:00.000Z	Javid^		I guess they just aren't that great
2007-10-10T13:33:00.000Z	Javid^		!info equivs
2007-10-10T13:35:00.000Z	Javid^		there really needs to just be a "not interested" option on updates
2007-10-10T13:35:00.000Z	tom__	Javid^	but they are quite important
2007-10-10T13:36:00.000Z	Javid^		the cool thing about having my own computer is I get to decide what's important to put on it
2007-10-10T13:36:00.000Z	Javid^		is it utterly critical that I endlessly update firefox with the exact same deb? XD
2007-10-10T13:36:00.000Z	Javid^		I think not.
2007-10-10T13:37:00.000Z	tom__	Javid^	but the guys at ubuntu want to have a secure distro so they want people to update
2007-10-10T13:37:00.000Z	Javid^	tom__	do you understand the problem I am having at all?
2007-10-10T13:37:00.000Z	Javid^		because if you did you would know why such a feature would be useful
2007-10-10T13:38:00.000Z	tom__	Javid^	i was just generally commenting on the update notifications.
