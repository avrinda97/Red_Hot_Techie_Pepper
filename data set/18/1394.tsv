2011-03-03T06:09:00.000Z	whitefinger		anyone know a good place to start learning Csharp but writing and running in ubuntu?
2011-03-03T06:11:00.000Z	whitefinger		Starting to code in Csharp but wanting to start on ubuntu Because i hate windows anyone have any tips
2011-03-03T06:12:00.000Z	whitefinger		Zombie what is it that you are looking for?
2011-03-03T06:12:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	Isn't there mono for that? I think that's a linux C# implementation.
2011-03-03T06:20:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	There is but testing in ubuntu is seeming to  be deficult becuase it is in .exe and wine will run it but close automaticly, even with a stop close oh .net
2011-03-03T06:21:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	Hmmm... Well, I must confess I know hardly anything about C#. If what you're trying to run is an executable and you don't have the source, there isn't much you can do about it but try wine (which you have)
2011-03-03T06:22:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	wine will run it but close right away even with a close program i install mono and run mono ( application.exe) and it runs its just weird lol
2011-03-03T06:23:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	So it works...? I can't really help, sorry
2011-03-03T06:24:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	no problem thanks for the help You have any sugestions on a nice langauge to use in ubuntu that can have graphical interface.
2011-03-03T06:26:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	Well, Java is pretty easy to pick up and you can do GUIs pretty easily
2011-03-03T06:27:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	You can also do GUIs in python fairly easily (methinks). Writing a gui app in C/C++ is of course gong to be harder
2011-03-03T06:27:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	hm.. i like basic and i did not mind python but that was years and years and years ago
2011-03-03T06:28:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	Well, if Basic's your thing, I think there might be some implementations of that that use GUIS, not sure though
2011-03-03T06:28:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	yeah python was my second languge but i did not like windows execution problems and i want something that i can use for ubuntu and windows base
2011-03-03T06:29:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	Well if it's portability you want, Java is pretty good for that. the Netbeans IDE lets you design GUIs right in it, or you can write the GUIs entirely by hand. Take a look at the tutorials at http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
2011-03-03T06:32:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	thanks checking it out now see if i like it
2011-03-03T06:33:00.000Z	nsd	whitefinger	No problem. I gtg, so if you have any other questions ask someone else ;)
2011-03-03T06:33:00.000Z	whitefinger	nsd	thanks and will do talk to you another time lol
