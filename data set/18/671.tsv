2011-12-20T19:57:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	it's basically debian with an ugly window manager
2011-12-20T19:57:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: ?
2011-12-20T19:57:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: how about driver and dependencies issues? is it the same with ubuntu or debian?
2011-12-20T19:58:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: i dont really understand that. could you rephrase if you dont mind :)
2011-12-20T19:59:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	the ubuntu philosophy does support that it might be configuring your hardware automatically better
2011-12-20T20:00:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	but I have not tested it myself to give you backed statement, so I refrained from claming it does
2011-12-20T20:00:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: so where can i actually get this ubuntu minimal?
2011-12-20T20:00:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	how do you connect to the internet?
2011-12-20T20:01:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: usb modem
2011-12-20T20:01:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	you could download the bootonly and perform a netinstall
2011-12-20T20:01:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: so that is minimal :S sight
2011-12-20T20:02:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: wait, i think i am lost again, how is different then?
2011-12-20T20:05:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	it doesn't make much difference unless you are disgusted by all the eye candy, very minimal on disk space, and don't wanna see apps that you never use -- ever
2011-12-20T20:06:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: hurm, ok then :( sigh~  sorry for asking here now, how do i get into #fedora. i end up in fedora-unregistered just now
2011-12-20T20:07:00.000Z	nb-ben	inashdeen	I just figured you might have been talking about the minimal -CD-
2011-12-20T20:07:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: yeah
2011-12-20T20:09:00.000Z	inashdeen	nb-ben	: what kind of package, and where can i get it?the iso i mean
