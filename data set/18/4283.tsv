2009-05-31T03:26:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	http://pastebin.com/f1ecfce42 dont understand this
2009-05-31T03:17:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	it is in ubuntu server .. and date shows correct time
2009-05-31T03:19:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	That program is probably reading the hardware time directly (as does ubuntu) and ubuntu is probably compensating for your time zone / daylight savings or something
2009-05-31T03:20:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	hmmm .. no reply from proftpd channel.. ZykoticK9 let me know if you ever remember how u fixed it..
2009-05-31T03:21:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	how do I check my hardware clock ?
2009-05-31T03:21:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	read man clock
2009-05-31T03:21:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	ok
2009-05-31T03:27:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	i am always confused about which clock to pick.. hardware clock or system clock .. and why are they different on same box ?
2009-05-31T03:28:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	and how to keep it stick followed by a power cycle ?
2009-05-31T03:28:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	and reboot
2009-05-31T03:28:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	I have no idea (since the os can set the clock) why not just set it and use it?  Instead linux creates a system clock (based on hardware clock) with +1 hour or something if it is wrong
2009-05-31T03:28:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	What did you do to change it?
2009-05-31T03:29:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	i just noticed the time diff today.. i did not change anything since the install
2009-05-31T03:33:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	Then what change are you trying to preserve over a reboot?
2009-05-31T03:42:00.000Z	axisys	ed_debian	i fixed the hwclock to syn with system clock .. restarted proftpd and still proftpd xferlog timestamp is one hr behind.. i wish proftpd guys reply to email :-)
2009-05-31T03:42:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	IDK reboot?
2009-05-31T03:43:00.000Z	ed_debian	axisys	I don't know where that program get's its time info from (most use the system clock not the hwclock)
