2009-08-05T00:58:00.000Z	Cyrus25801		my package manager isn't showing me all (almost no) apps i search for. can someone help
2009-08-05T00:58:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	check the filters
2009-08-05T01:01:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	done that
2009-08-05T01:02:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	so, first of all, which package manager is this?
2009-08-05T01:02:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	synaptic
2009-08-05T01:02:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	and how are you searching, and what are you searching  for?
2009-08-05T01:03:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	in the search bar, vlc, opera, flash etc
2009-08-05T01:06:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	and when you search for vlc, what do you see? What do you expect to see?
2009-08-05T01:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	nothing, i expect to see the vlc package
2009-08-05T01:08:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	Again, only thing I could think of is misconfigured filters, it works just as it should on my side here....
2009-08-05T01:16:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	rechecked the filters, everything fine
2009-08-05T01:18:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	so if you just do "apt-cache show vlc", does that show the package info alright?
2009-08-05T01:19:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	it show me info....allot of it
2009-08-05T01:20:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	Yea, so then it's just the search in synaptic that's wonko...
2009-08-05T01:20:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	any idea how to fix it
2009-08-05T01:21:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	have not seen the issue before, not a clue, search launchpad if there are any bugs on the issue.
2009-08-05T01:21:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	arand	launchpad?
2009-08-05T01:21:00.000Z	arand	Cyrus25801	the ubuntu bug tracker at launchpad.net
