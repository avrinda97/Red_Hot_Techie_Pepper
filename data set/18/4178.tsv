2009-07-19T04:20:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	Are you speaking of a bluetooth audio device?
2009-07-19T04:20:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	they are generic HSP compatible bluetooth headsets
2009-07-19T04:21:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	8,000 is very low audio quality. 44,100 is standard CD quality.In case you didnt know.
2009-07-19T04:22:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	yeah i knew roughly but like i said these are cheap HSP/voice bluetooth headsets
2009-07-19T04:22:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	If you have stuttering and/or noise, you may have to set it to use the native sample rate.
2009-07-19T04:22:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	how can i do that exactly?
2009-07-19T04:22:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	been looking for a way to force resampling to its native rate
2009-07-19T04:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	Try several of the standard sample rates such as 44100, 22050, 48000 etc.
2009-07-19T04:23:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	how do i force this?
2009-07-19T04:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	I have a USB headset I use with gtkrecordmydesktop and I have to set it to its native 48000 and then the static and chopping disappear.
2009-07-19T04:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	Not sure.
2009-07-19T04:24:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	Are you trying to record into an application or what exactly?
2009-07-19T04:25:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	short term i'd just like to have a portable microphone and speaker for a netbook or something, long term: skype
2009-07-19T04:27:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	it does not always show up. i have virtually everything working with the headset just the huge intollerable audio sampling problem
2009-07-19T04:28:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	Ok in whatever app your using it with will probably have the actuall sample rate selection.
2009-07-21T04:11:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	netsurf3	Who? What?
2009-07-21T04:11:00.000Z	netsurf3	linuxguy2009	nano /etc/init.d/rc
