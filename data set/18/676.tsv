2011-11-08T23:23:00.000Z	n0yd		Hey guys
2011-11-08T23:23:00.000Z	n0yd		I'm just a bit confused, long time linux user, havent used Ubuntu in ages though....
2011-11-08T23:24:00.000Z	n0yd		Im running 11.10, and I wanted to get back old classic gnome, so i installed gnome-session-fallback.  But the panels and such arent correct.  The look kinda like regular old gnome, but im missing some of the menus at the top
2011-11-08T23:24:00.000Z	n0yd		Any ideas?
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	n0yd		omfg
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	n0yd		wow
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	n0yd		thats lame as shit
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	n0yd		Guess im going back to xfce
2011-11-08T23:26:00.000Z	n0yd		And just use my Arch box if i want gnome2
2011-11-08T23:26:00.000Z	riffautae	n0yd	install gnome-panel and use the session drop down to select it i think will pretend you are in g2
2011-11-08T23:28:00.000Z	riffautae	n0yd	gnome2 is depreciated
2011-11-08T23:28:00.000Z	n0yd	riffautae	no crap
2011-11-08T23:34:00.000Z	riffautae	n0yd	the simpleness of gnome complaint was the lack of configuration i think
2011-11-08T23:35:00.000Z	n0yd	riffautae	right, and gconf is archaic etc.  But to bitch about gnome2 and then praise kde where there is a million options for things and options for options for options and so on, just seems crazy
2011-11-08T23:36:00.000Z	riffautae	n0yd	its a support channel anyway
2011-11-08T23:37:00.000Z	n0yd	riffautae	duh.  Ive been around here for over 6 years.
2011-11-08T23:41:00.000Z	n0yd	riffautae	hes running 11.04 not *.10
2011-11-08T23:41:00.000Z	riffautae	n0yd	ah i see
