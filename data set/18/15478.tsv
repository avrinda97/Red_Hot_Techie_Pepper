2005-06-12T09:07:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	Python rocks for game creation. ;)
2005-06-12T09:07:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	get real buddy :) its slow at numerical computation
2005-06-12T09:08:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	forced: Lua is easy to implement, but Python as a language owns it hard. Plus, Boost.Python allows easy implementation.
2005-06-12T09:08:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	oh god you are such a noob
2005-06-12T09:08:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	Slow numerical computation? Try Psyco and Pyrex.
2005-06-12T09:08:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	its all about overhead and speed
2005-06-12T09:08:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	no.
2005-06-12T09:09:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	Don't get into this "you're a n00b" shit. It won't get you anywhere.
2005-06-12T09:10:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	you're ignored for being ignorant and talking out of your ass
2005-06-12T09:13:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	Fad languages? I highly suggest you take a look again at the languages you speak of. There's a reason why even advanced C/C++ coders are moving to other languages now.
2005-06-12T09:27:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	Perhaps with Java, but not Python
2005-06-12T09:27:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	you really think you are a know-it-all. don't you? you haven't check the vmSize of what java uses, and compared to python.
2005-06-12T09:28:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	Oh yeah, by stating the facts, I MUST be implying that I'm a know-it-all!
2005-06-12T09:28:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	no, you're speaking out your ass
2005-06-12T09:28:00.000Z	tsume	Quest-Master	*plonk*
2005-06-12T09:29:00.000Z	Quest-Master	tsume	I'd suggest you stop with the flaming, please. We don't want to turn #ubuntu into another #debian
