2008-04-22T13:40:00.000Z	motti		hello. does anyone know of symphony one distro?
2008-04-22T13:40:00.000Z	motti		because symphony one is an ubuntu based distro
2008-04-22T13:41:00.000Z	motti		silly me
2008-04-22T13:42:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	there's a difference. You don't go to a petrol station and ask for crude oil. It's all from the same thing though, right?
2008-04-22T13:48:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	look. they have a forum.
2008-04-22T13:51:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	but they have a forum! http://symphonyos.com/forum/
2008-04-22T13:52:00.000Z	motti	pipsqeek	there forum is quit numbed
2008-04-22T13:54:00.000Z	motti	pipsqeek	or maybe more supported distro should stop messing around with the kernel, I used aubuntu for 2 years before I had to switch distro
2008-04-22T13:54:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	anyway, that's not really offering me any information to help you.
2008-04-22T13:55:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	so, what's the question, in full.
2008-04-22T13:55:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	ask the question!
2008-04-22T14:10:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	considering symphonyos is based on deb/ubuntu, why not follow a mare suitable howto. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2008-04-22T14:11:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	I did this a few weeks ago when I placed Ubuntu on a USB key so I could live boot it for going on my EeePC
2008-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	motti	pipsqeek	I don't want to install it without testing it first with a live version because my hardware tend to be problematic.
2008-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	no one is installing anything. you can either liveboot with the CD, then make a USB boot disk within the live OS, or don't boot, install in a virtual machine. mount your USB key in the VM and follow instructions the same way.
2008-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	motti	pipsqeek	also, I'm lacking the isolinux.cfg file and that is the source of my problem
2008-04-22T14:34:00.000Z	pipsqeek	motti	that's how I did the EeePC install via USB.
2008-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	motti	pipsqeek	I'll check the link again
