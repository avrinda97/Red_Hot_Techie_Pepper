2011-09-16T10:02:00.000Z	usagiakumu		yes but I dont understand what you said
2011-09-16T10:03:00.000Z	usagiakumu		what is mesa?
2011-09-16T10:03:00.000Z	usagiakumu		it should work out of the box
2011-09-16T10:04:00.000Z	usagiakumu		OpenGL renderer string: Software Rasterizer?
2011-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	usagiakumu		but no 3d
2011-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	usagiakumu		even though its enabled
2011-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	usagiakumu		well that was a solid waste of time
2011-09-16T10:07:00.000Z	usagiakumu		virtualbox is useless if I cant run it properly
2011-09-16T10:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	usagiakumu	have you tried the 2d?
2011-09-16T10:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	usagiakumu	I believe it is a choice in the login after you choose the user.
2011-09-16T10:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	usagiakumu	even if you have 3d enabled vbox is using its drivers I believe.
2011-09-16T10:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	usagiakumu	you also have a choice of the classic desktop at the login.
2011-09-16T10:10:00.000Z	usagiakumu	urlin2u	yeah I dont like classic looks nothing like my brothers laptop
2011-09-16T10:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	usagiakumu	I am surprised your getting the unity at all in vbox.
2011-09-16T10:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	usagiakumu	you can move the window buttons to the right in gconf-edotor
2011-09-16T10:53:00.000Z	usagiakumu	urlin2u	that sort of defeats the purpose of symetry
