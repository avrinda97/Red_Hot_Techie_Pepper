2007-09-08T06:57:00.000Z	ubuntu09		anyone good with routers?
2007-09-08T06:57:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	I am, but just ask your question.
2007-09-08T06:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	Is this using Ubuntu? Does it work in Winblows okay?
2007-09-08T06:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	Odd.
2007-09-08T06:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	I don't think so. What IP does the active computer get? What's the first number?
2007-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	You aren't getting NAT working right then.
2007-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	You'll need to buy a NAT capable router.
2007-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	Yeah. Your IP range needs to start with 10, 172.16, or 192.168
2007-09-08T07:02:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	It's probably a switch.
2007-09-08T07:03:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	Hmm. I can't say I guess. The IP address you have now is a 68.x.y.z number right?
2007-09-08T07:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	What is your default gateway? Is it a 192 or a 68?
2007-09-08T07:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	I'd try buying a new router myself. My recommendation would be a LInksys WRT54G and modding it to DD-WRT.
2007-09-08T07:06:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	But just for kicks and giggles, what happens if you load your browser and type 192.168.1.1?
2007-09-08T07:08:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	It sounds like you might have to buy a new router to do this.
2007-09-08T07:09:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	That's only a hub.
2007-09-08T07:09:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	No.
2007-09-08T07:10:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	Nope.
2007-09-08T07:10:00.000Z	MrObvious	ubuntu09	YW.
