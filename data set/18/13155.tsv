2006-01-26T08:54:00.000Z	Eroick		I want a good non-vim/emacs/nano editor for windows and linux that has macros and stuff like that.
2006-01-26T08:54:00.000Z	Eroick		any ideas?
2006-01-26T08:54:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	apt-cache search 'code editor' for a list of candidates.
2006-01-26T08:54:00.000Z	Eroick	karsten	i want a recomendation
2006-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	... Well, you eliminated the two principle candidates.
2006-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	Eroick	karsten	nano/vim?
2006-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	Visual Slickedit is a proprietary tool that a lot of folks like.
2006-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	vim / emacs.
2006-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	Eroick	karsten	freeness is of the essence
2006-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	nedit and gedit have some coding support.  As I said:  most people likely use vim/emacs.
2006-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	The essence of this problem is that it's yours not mine ;-)
2006-01-26T08:57:00.000Z	Eroick	karsten	does vim have support for doing fancy macros? Like textmate for mac?
2006-01-26T08:57:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	Sure.  They're called sed scripts ;-)
2006-01-26T08:57:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	Seriously, I just pipe something from shell.  There is also a record/playback feature, I don't use it.
2006-01-26T08:58:00.000Z	Eroick	karsten	how do you do the pipe?
2006-01-26T08:58:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	:! <command>
2006-01-26T08:58:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	To run on a range, say, defined as a & b:  :a,b! <cmd>
2006-01-26T08:59:00.000Z	karsten	Eroick	You can mark lines with the ' key.  So: 'a <move> 'b sets the marks 'a' and 'b'.  You can then do stuff (move, copy, pipe, etc.) on those marks.
