2011-04-20T21:37:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	have you tried it with other programs?
2011-04-20T21:37:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	i don't know of any other programs that can modify an iso
2011-04-20T21:37:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	i've used the iso for burning/mounting and installing in a VM though - if you're wondering if it's corrupted, it's not
2011-04-20T21:39:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	have you tried kriso? its in the repos I think it allows you to edit it.
2011-04-20T21:39:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	will do
2011-04-20T21:39:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	not in the repos
2011-04-20T21:40:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	you sure you typed it right? not getting anything even in google under that name
2011-04-20T21:41:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	sorry type its kiso
2011-04-20T21:41:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	grabbing it now
2011-04-20T21:42:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	good, hope it works man.
2011-04-20T21:42:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	likewise, heh.. i got OS X 10.6 running in VBox, but i can't drop the EFI boot disc.. so i'm trying to change the resolution based on the data in the boot disc, lol
2011-04-20T21:42:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	the boot disc keeps resetting it afterall
2011-04-20T21:43:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	Sounds like a horrible way of changing res.
2011-04-20T21:43:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	indeed, but it won't matter once it's changed - i don't intend on constantly resizing it
2011-04-20T21:44:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	worked :D
2011-04-20T21:44:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	glad to hear. :)
2011-04-20T21:48:00.000Z	mordof	minion35	opened it.. didn't save the ISO or manage it very well ;_;
2011-04-20T21:49:00.000Z	minion35	mordof	sorry man only thing I can think of.
