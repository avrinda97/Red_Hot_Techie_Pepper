2009-10-02T05:16:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	hey do know about the application partimage
2009-10-02T05:17:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	a little bit - been ages since I used it, though.
2009-10-02T05:18:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	hey i wanted to create a bootable backup dvd
2009-10-02T05:19:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	Partimage is a hard disk partitioning tool - it's not for making DVDs
2009-10-02T05:20:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	so can you recommend me an application
2009-10-02T05:21:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	Brasero is the default ubuntu burning app, IIRC - but you could also use K3B, among others.
2009-10-02T05:22:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	hey let me explain you what i have to do
2009-10-02T05:22:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	Go ahead...
2009-10-02T05:24:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	i have window xp installed but i wanted to backup the entire partition so that if in future if the virus attacks then atleast i can restore from bootable backup dvd.
2009-10-02T05:25:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	Sorry, I am an idiot! - I was thinking of parted when you saaid partimage - doh!
2009-10-02T05:27:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	so was i right with the opinion should i use the partimage
2009-10-02T05:29:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	To back up a windows install, I would probably use a native windows tool myself (something like ghost) but partimage would probably do the job. But I've never used it.
2009-10-02T05:30:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	will it can perform the job of bootable backup image
2009-10-02T05:31:00.000Z	zen-tao	ricky21tom	Sorry, I don't know. Like I said I've never used it - I was thinking of parted.
2009-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	thanks any way there is nothing to be sorry
2009-10-02T05:34:00.000Z	ricky21tom	zen-tao	we are human tend do mistake but learn from mistake
