2012-02-26T04:51:00.000Z	Takyoji		Is there a way to lower the disk I/O priority for the whole system? On both my systems (Ubuntu and Fedora), I have complete system lockups that even kills sound daemons, drops all network connections, and likely doesn't even respond to interrupts from the Ethernet card, all solely in favor of freaking swapping memory back and forth from swap (even when the swappiness is set to 15, and there's 200MB free RAM!).
2012-02-26T04:51:00.000Z	Takyoji		On my laptop I've even had the whole system lockup, where you couldn't even move the cursor, just because of horrendously overprioritizing the disk I/O
2012-02-26T04:51:00.000Z	Takyoji		for 20 minutes
2012-02-26T04:52:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	how much total RAM?
2012-02-26T04:53:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	and you produce this on a few different systems?
2012-02-26T04:54:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	maybe its a disk issue
2012-02-26T04:55:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	what mode you in with hdparm -i
2012-02-26T04:56:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	i got nothing
2012-02-26T04:58:00.000Z	Takyoji	humungulous	http://paste.ubuntu.com/857192/
2012-02-26T04:59:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	yep youre in udma6
2012-02-26T05:02:00.000Z	Takyoji	humungulous	So should I lower the transfer mode, or something?
2012-02-26T05:02:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	no it was just something i was checking but its fine
2012-02-26T05:02:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	i really dont know whats going on with your lag
2012-02-26T05:03:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	add RAM, of course
2012-02-26T05:03:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	agreed. its definitely not right
2012-02-26T05:04:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	well, if you think of a system with too little ram hitting its commit ceiling, its going to bring the whole OS to its knees, not just one application
2012-02-26T05:04:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	but 700MB should be "enough"
2012-02-26T05:06:00.000Z	humungulous	Takyoji	have you fsck
