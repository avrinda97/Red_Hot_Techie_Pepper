2008-03-03T04:52:00.000Z	inertial		how do you turn off the drum sound that plays before login?
2008-03-03T04:54:00.000Z	inertial		i can turn off the login sound in system->prefs->sound but I can't turn off that dumdumdum sound that plays when the login screen loads... any ideas?
2008-03-03T04:54:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	system->preferences->sound ?
2008-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	inertial	Sarah	not there.. that's only the login sound.. i want the sound before that
2008-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	In the sound tab there is a "login" bit, just change it to no sound
2008-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	Oh you mean the GDM sound?
2008-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	inertial	Sarah	ah, yes, the GDM sound
2008-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf you will find #SoundOnLogin=true
2008-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	Sarah		SoundOnLoginFile=/usr/share/sounds/question.wav
2008-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	Uncomment the first line and set it to false
2008-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	inertial	Sarah	thanks
2008-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	inertial	Sarah	i think this should be easier to do.. where can i suggest it as something to fix?
2008-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	There probably is an easier way. But in the ubuntu bug thingy
2008-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	I found the easier way
2008-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	system->administration->login window->Accesibility (god knows why)
2008-03-03T04:58:00.000Z	inertial	Sarah	ah.. thanks.. yeah maybe that's not the right spot for that
2008-03-03T04:58:00.000Z	Sarah	inertial	I guess that would be a feature request to file with the Gnome team.
2008-03-03T04:58:00.000Z	inertial	Sarah	yup.. gtg to a meeting bbl
