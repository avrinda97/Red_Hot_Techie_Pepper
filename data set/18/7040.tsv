2008-07-04T09:11:00.000Z	knoppix		sorry, I mean windows
2008-07-04T09:12:00.000Z	knoppix		hello guys, can you please advise?
2008-07-04T09:13:00.000Z	knoppix		sorry, I mean Windows
2008-07-04T09:13:00.000Z	knoppix		when I instert the windows CD, it doesn't boot
2008-07-04T09:13:00.000Z	knoppix		something about GRUB
2008-07-04T09:15:00.000Z	knoppix		what happens is that when I try to boot from the windows CD, it tells me to "press any key to boot from CD" and I do. but then once it starts checking for hardware I can't seem to get to the pont where I can format the harddrives
2008-07-04T09:16:00.000Z	knoppix		no i haven't deleted partitions
2008-07-04T09:17:00.000Z	knoppix		from what i haave been reading on forums...it have to format the harddrive
2008-07-04T09:17:00.000Z	knoppix		but how do i format the harddrive fom the Fedora console..I'm a noob in linux?
2008-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	you can use parted, its quite cool from the command line
2008-07-04T09:24:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	are you using parted, fdisk, or gparted?
2008-07-04T09:25:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	you mean the language settings?
2008-07-04T09:25:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	ah wait, you mean grub, just press return
2008-07-04T09:25:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	alright, return will do the trick
2008-07-04T09:26:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	nope, you will get GUI for everything
2008-07-04T09:27:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	you see the gui in front of you now? or the command line?
2008-07-04T09:28:00.000Z	svenstaro	knoppix	goodie, basically everything should be pretty obvious now, you can just select which partitions you want to delete now and then resize the remaining partitions to fit in
