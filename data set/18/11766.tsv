2006-09-16T14:05:00.000Z	Piero		I can't understand the problem
2006-09-16T14:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Piero	Did you set a root password?
2006-09-16T14:06:00.000Z	Piero	Jack_Sparrow	sure. In fact, if I login as root
2006-09-16T14:06:00.000Z	Piero		it works
2006-09-16T14:06:00.000Z	Piero		but from an user, if I do "su"

2006-09-16T14:06:00.000Z	Piero		it's strange
2006-09-16T14:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Piero	Running as root user can also laed to problems..
2006-09-16T14:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Piero	Setting a root password and logging in as root is not advised
2006-09-16T14:07:00.000Z	Piero		yeah I know. but I would know
2006-09-16T14:07:00.000Z	Piero		why I get wrong password
2006-09-16T14:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Piero	USe sudo, or gksudo for gnome gui apps and kdesu for kde apps
2006-09-16T14:08:00.000Z	Piero	Jack_Sparrow	sure, but I would know the issue
