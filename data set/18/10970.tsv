2006-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	semPid		what should i do when linux crashes?
2006-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	semPid		:o
2006-09-30T07:02:00.000Z	semPid		that doesnt solve the prob =P
2006-09-30T07:02:00.000Z	frying_fish	semPid	that would be a lot rarer than when windows crashes, and define what you mean by crash
2006-09-30T07:02:00.000Z	frying_fish		as most things can be resolved by just killing the process and restarting it.
2006-09-30T07:02:00.000Z	semPid	frying_fish	i was configuring wireless connection
2006-09-30T07:03:00.000Z	semPid		e typed the pw's and stuff, clicked OK and it crashed
2006-09-30T07:03:00.000Z	frying_fish		ok, so what the wireless now doesn't work? you can probably just ifdown the device and ifup it, and then use iwconfig and such
2006-09-30T07:03:00.000Z	frying_fish		it "crashed" it stopped working? if so restart network-manager
2006-09-30T07:03:00.000Z	frying_fish		or nm-applet
2006-09-30T07:03:00.000Z	semPid		no no no
2006-09-30T07:03:00.000Z	semPid		the OS crashed
2006-09-30T07:04:00.000Z	frying_fish	semPid	the whole OS I doubt it.
2006-09-30T07:04:00.000Z	semPid		i cannot even use the mouse, it stopped
2006-09-30T07:04:00.000Z	frying_fish	semPid	ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-09-30T07:04:00.000Z	frying_fish		(restarts X)
2006-09-30T07:04:00.000Z	semPid		ok
2006-09-30T07:05:00.000Z	semPid	frying_fish	dind't work either :s
