2005-02-09T13:23:00.000Z	ideafix	Rytmis	thats the same has saying that if you have no cold you can walck around naked on the streets
2005-02-09T13:23:00.000Z	Rytmis	ideafix	no, it's not.
2005-02-09T13:23:00.000Z	Rytmis	ideafix	it's like saying, if you're immune to cold, you can do it.
2005-02-09T13:24:00.000Z	Rytmis	ideafix	when there's nothing that can be accessed from the network, there's no real risk in not running a firewall.
2005-02-09T13:24:00.000Z	Rytmis	ideafix	the way you see it seems to be rooted in the windows world.
2005-02-09T13:28:00.000Z	Rytmis	ideafix	why, when there's nothing that can receive those packages, and hence nothing to be afraid of?
2005-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	Rytmis	ideafix	you're not listening to us.
