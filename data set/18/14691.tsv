2005-09-11T12:50:00.000Z	jamey3		hiya
2005-09-11T12:51:00.000Z	jamey3		does anyone know how I can setup uPNP on Ubuntu?
2005-09-11T12:51:00.000Z	jamey3		so that I can setup port forwarding automatically
2005-09-11T12:52:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	you need to be more specific
2005-09-11T12:54:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	for example?
2005-09-11T12:54:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	e.g., firefox has no need for it
2005-09-11T12:54:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	apache has no need for it
2005-09-11T12:54:00.000Z	jamey3	bob2	that's my point
2005-09-11T12:55:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	no, apache does not do that, and I hope it never does
2005-09-11T12:56:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	there doesn't appear to be one in ubuntu
2005-09-11T12:56:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	you're welcome to package one if it exists and upload it
2005-09-11T12:57:00.000Z	jamey3	bob2	not really in my experience
2005-09-11T12:57:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	letting compromised windows machines forward ports to themselves sounds bad
2005-09-11T13:00:00.000Z	jamey3	bob2	don't ask this NIC is the biggest POS in the world
2005-09-21T11:32:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	depends on the sound card
2005-09-21T11:33:00.000Z	jamey3	bob2	it's the default integrated one on an Abit NF7-S motherboard. I think it's a Realtek chipset.
2005-09-21T11:34:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	what does google say about linux support for that motherboard?
2005-09-21T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	jamey3	it's possible linux doesn't support it at all, but I don't know
