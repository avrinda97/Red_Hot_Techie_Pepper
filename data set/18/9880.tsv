2007-08-01T05:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	what desktop environment are you using, and does it spit out any errors?
2007-08-01T05:19:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	tell you what, try this:  sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2007-08-01T05:19:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	(I want to see if I can at least get you into a graphical environment from which you can seek more help.
2007-08-01T05:19:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	Let me know when you've done that.
2007-08-01T05:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	Ah, so you can log in alright then?
2007-08-01T05:21:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	...Okay, so it logs you right back out again, then?
2007-08-01T05:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	Alright. Well, basically I'd like to help you get into another window manager for the moment, from which you can more comfortably try to debug your problem.
2007-08-01T05:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	If you'd like to pursue that option, that is.
2007-08-01T05:23:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	Was that directed at me? If so, you can probably log into it from GDM, if you want.
2007-08-01T05:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	Yeah, it's tough. Incidentally, it would make it easier on me if you'd preface things addressed to me with my nick, as I'm doing for you.
2007-08-01T05:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	irssi will highlight mentions of your nick. *shrug*
2007-08-01T05:24:00.000Z	Amon-san	ladydoor	can we do this on query?
2007-08-01T05:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	Amon-san	Did you get that?
