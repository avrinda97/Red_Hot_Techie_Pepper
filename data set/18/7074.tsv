2008-02-11T02:06:00.000Z	spaleyAE		Is it possible I did something wrong during install? Doesn't seem like I had a lot of options to screw up.
2008-02-11T02:06:00.000Z	spaleyAE		no data
2008-02-11T02:07:00.000Z	spaleyAE		starting over is an option
2008-02-11T02:07:00.000Z	spaleyAE		I just don't understand what I could have done wrong during install though.
2008-02-11T02:07:00.000Z	spaleyAE		'spaley' is in the 'adm' group which I assume is admin, yes?
2008-02-11T02:08:00.000Z	Starnestommy	spaleyAE	it should be admin, not adm
2008-02-11T02:10:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	Can you think of any reason why 'spaley', which was created as part of the installer process, should not have automatically been added to the 'admin' group?
2008-02-11T02:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	spaleyAE	sounds like a bug
2008-02-11T02:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	spaleyAE	I think you can go into recovery mode, log in as root, and do 'adduser spaley admin'
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	ok, I'll try that. I'm using 7.10 server, btw.
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	thanks
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	what's the easiest way into recovery mode?
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	spaleyAE	reboot?
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	great, th
2008-02-11T02:17:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	when I went into recovery mode, I"m in as root, but I tried 'adduser spaley admin' and got 'The group 'admin' does not exist.'
2008-02-11T02:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	spaleyAE	try editing /etc/sudoers with visudo in recoverymode
2008-02-11T02:21:00.000Z	Starnestommy	spaleyAE	I think someone came in here before with a similar issue. Editing /etc/sudoers worked.
2008-02-11T02:21:00.000Z	spaleyAE	Starnestommy	yeah, I did that, but now I"m worried what else is broken
