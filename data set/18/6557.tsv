2008-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	afallenhope		anyone know... if I patched my driver in the old kernel if the new kernel would have the previous patched driver or do I have to repatch it/
2008-05-27T07:21:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	repatch
2008-05-27T07:21:00.000Z	afallenhope	fde	do you know where I can get the kernel source then?
2008-05-27T07:22:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	linux-source-`uname -r`
2008-05-27T07:22:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	to limit confusion, actually 'linux-source-$(uname -r)
2008-05-27T07:22:00.000Z	afallenhope	fde	Couldn't find package linux-source-2.6.24-17-generic
2008-05-27T07:24:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	ahh... hmm... 'sudo apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r) I guess
2008-05-27T07:25:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	Actually, how do you mean you patched the kernel? You edited a module's source code, and applied it?
2008-05-27T07:25:00.000Z	afallenhope	fde	yeagh
2008-05-27T07:25:00.000Z	afallenhope	fde	I patched the module source for the b43 driver...
2008-05-27T07:26:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	you probably only want linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2008-05-27T07:27:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	You should definitely file a bug though and submit your patch if it is a fix.
2008-05-27T07:27:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	Not 100% it'll get in, but it'd save you some time if it does  :D
2008-05-27T07:27:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	you have booted to the newest kernel?
2008-05-27T07:27:00.000Z	afallenhope	fde	yeah I
2008-05-27T07:28:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	then get to compiling the module  ;D
2008-05-27T07:29:00.000Z	fde	afallenhope	dpkg -L linux-headers-$(uname -r) ... they're in the right place... just compile.
2008-05-27T07:30:00.000Z	afallenhope	fde	there's nothing in there lol.  in the b43 place
