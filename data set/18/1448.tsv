2011-02-20T16:10:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	take out one of the ram and try it agein
2011-02-20T16:10:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	should I run memtest first?
2011-02-20T16:11:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	nah, just try the ram first :)
2011-02-20T16:11:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	u decide what you do first :)
2011-02-20T16:12:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	I'll pull a stick out and see what happens.  I need to open it up anyway
2011-02-20T16:12:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	cool, hope it works :P
2011-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	pulled 1 out of the 2 sticks out, and it's now reporting 768MB available, despite it having a 1GB stick remaining.  Think I chose the wrong one to remove!
2011-02-20T16:19:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	:P so it may be the problem after all :) crossing fingers
2011-02-20T16:24:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	First one still crashed, second one also reports 768MB - not sure if this nvidia onboard card grabs the rest or something else.  I've kicked off memtest86 with the second one in
2011-02-20T16:25:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	hm, u could debug both of the ram sticks before going any further, it may be so many things. u said it freezes when u log in or?
2011-02-20T16:27:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	it's set to autologon, but it's typically freezing about the time it should start to boot myth frontend.  Once I was able to ssh in before it froze.  Nothing in dmesg.  It's been hot here this weekend, and the machine is left on 24/7, wondering if it's heat related
2011-02-20T16:29:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	ye heat is a killer :p u said you got a nvidia 3d card in there ? do you got a intregrated 3d card on your motherboard if so try that. :)
2011-02-20T16:30:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	no 3d, just onboard nvidia 8200.  no other gfx card around.  second stick of ram just passed memtest86 round 1, so I'm going to try booting it
2011-02-20T16:31:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	cool, im not guru when it comes too any thing but debugging is something all have to go through some times >)
2011-02-20T16:32:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	there's no word on problems with 2.6.35.25 is there?
2011-02-20T16:33:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	dont know sry
2011-02-20T16:33:00.000Z	banksy	Krycek	just realised there's a more likely culprit - nvidia drivers
2011-02-20T16:34:00.000Z	Krycek	banksy	:) gl i am out of idea of debugging >)
