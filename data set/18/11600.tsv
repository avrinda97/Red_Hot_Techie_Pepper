2006-07-07T14:10:00.000Z	jirc		hello can anyone help :), How do you make or install X Server to UBuntu 6.06 so that i can connect via putty on windiws/linux over the internet using SSH and X11 Forwarding to allow a fully GUI remote desktop?
2006-07-07T14:11:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- have you looked into VNC?
2006-07-07T14:13:00.000Z	jirc	sharms	i dont know how to encrypt VNC traffic
2006-07-07T14:13:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
2006-07-07T14:14:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- you can also tunnel VNC over ssh, but it takes a few more commands that I don't have at hand
2006-07-07T15:09:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- root is disabled by default
2006-07-07T15:11:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- please read the link
2006-07-07T15:11:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- your user password will let you use root through sudo
2006-07-07T15:11:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- but your password is not root's password
2006-07-07T15:12:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	 I will insist you read the link as it goes over that
2006-07-07T15:12:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
2006-07-07T15:13:00.000Z	jirc	sharms	it just says incorrect password
2006-07-07T15:13:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- what command are you running?
2006-07-07T15:14:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	and why are you running it
2006-07-07T15:15:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- what reason do you have to change roots password?
2006-07-07T15:17:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	- you can use sudo for anything su can do
2006-07-07T15:17:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	 and if that is too hard use sudo -i
2006-07-07T15:21:00.000Z	sharms	jirc	its more secure this way
