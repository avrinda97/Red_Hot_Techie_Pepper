2009-02-20T02:57:00.000Z	tangentcollision		what is the name of the taskbar in gnome?
2009-02-20T02:59:00.000Z	tangentcollision		excuse me, I'm using tightvnc and I need to start up everything command by command, what is the name of the taskbar in gnome?
2009-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	tangentcollision		gnome-panel should work
2009-02-20T03:01:00.000Z	tangentcollision		1337ingDisorder...damnit
2009-02-20T03:01:00.000Z	tangentcollision		apperently it doesn't work through VNC
2009-02-20T03:03:00.000Z	guntbert	tangentcollision	other approach: why do you use vnc instead ssh -X ?
2009-02-20T03:04:00.000Z	tangentcollision	guntbert	windows
2009-02-20T03:05:00.000Z	guntbert	tangentcollision	thats no problem, I use cygwin/X,  that exists even portable, with portable putty
2009-02-20T03:06:00.000Z	tangentcollision	guntbert	I've tried for days to get putty + x to work, it just doesn't for me
2009-02-20T03:06:00.000Z	tangentcollision	guntbert	I use VNC, it works fine, I have no problems
2009-02-20T03:06:00.000Z	tangentcollision	guntbert	the only problem I have is that I have no taskbar
2009-02-20T03:08:00.000Z	guntbert	tangentcollision	I saw your problem, have no solution, tried a different approach - sorry if it is no help :)
2009-02-20T03:08:00.000Z	tangentcollision	guntbert	screen gnome-panel
2009-02-20T03:09:00.000Z	guntbert	tangentcollision	glad it works, thank you for reporting back, I'll remember that
2009-02-20T03:09:00.000Z	tangentcollision	guntbert	no problem, lol xD
