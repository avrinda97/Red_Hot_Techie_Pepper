2011-12-22T14:47:00.000Z	biopyte		hi. i have a problem the terminal bell not ringing  .... echo -e '\a'  and stuff ... no sound .... any idea?
2011-12-22T14:48:00.000Z	Humbedooh	biopyte	do you have any sound at all? ;>
2011-12-22T14:49:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	yes ... mp3, movies ... sound is fine
2011-12-22T14:50:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	internal speaker, of course
2011-12-22T14:50:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	good question ... i have to find out exactly what kind of terminal it is
2011-12-22T14:52:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	its a gnome-terminal and i activated Terminal Bell in the settings
2011-12-22T14:54:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	still no beep after "xset b on"
2011-12-22T14:56:00.000Z	Humbedooh	biopyte	try running "xrdb -query" and see if the config might tell you something
2011-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	"speaker" in alsamixer is set to "0"
2011-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	i guess ... but i cant change the value .... where can i change it?
2011-12-22T15:10:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	in alsamixer i unmuted 'Beep' and raised the dB ... 'Speaker' dB cant be changed .... still no BEEP after all
2011-12-22T15:11:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	maybe a BIOS setting?
2011-12-22T15:11:00.000Z	Humbedooh	biopyte	if you are running it on xterm, shouldn't it use your audio device for playing the beep though?
2011-12-22T15:14:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	good point ... it beeps like a charme on the real terminal Ctrl-alt-F1
2011-12-22T15:15:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	so .. this tells me ... what?
2011-12-22T15:16:00.000Z	Humbedooh	biopyte	did you check the mixer control on the desktop? maybe xterm isn't set to use any sound card
2011-12-22T15:17:00.000Z	biopyte	Humbedooh	where do i find this setting ... is it in the preferences?
2011-12-22T15:18:00.000Z	Humbedooh	biopyte	I'm using xfce myself, so I wouldn't know exactly where on regular ubuntu :<
