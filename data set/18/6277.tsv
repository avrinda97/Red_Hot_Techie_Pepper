2008-05-29T20:12:00.000Z	unr3a1		how can I use apt-get to install the flash plugin?
2008-05-29T20:12:00.000Z	unr3a1		or does it have to be manually installed?
2008-05-29T20:13:00.000Z	unr3a1		nonfree?
2008-05-29T20:14:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	nonfree means the adobe flash, it's not open sourced (apart from that it works)
2008-05-29T20:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	check this, it, install flash player 10 beta and it should work http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4928900
2008-05-29T20:17:00.000Z	unr3a1	glitsj16	ok, I will try that
2008-05-29T20:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	did you install it via Gdebi ?
2008-05-29T20:21:00.000Z	unr3a1	glitsj16	I have no idea what that is
2008-05-29T20:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	Gdebi is a way to install .deb packages, ubuntu (apt) doesn't know what to do with them default like, try accessories > appfinder for Gdebi
2008-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	.. that checks all the dependencies for you, and installs those as well if you choose so
2008-05-29T20:25:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	yep, it's short for application finder, gives you a rundown of everything presently installed on your system
2008-05-29T20:27:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	open it, or follow fde's advice and double-click the .deb file via your file-manager, should both work
2008-05-29T20:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	anything specific about the missing dependencies ?
2008-05-29T20:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	did you "sudo apt-get remove libflashsupport nspluginwrapper" first ?
2008-05-29T20:37:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	i'm at a loss there i'm afraid, following the detailed instructions at that url worked for me, sorry
2008-05-29T20:38:00.000Z	unr3a1	glitsj16	its ok.  thanks for trying though
2008-05-29T21:06:00.000Z	unr3a1	glitsj16	did you say something to me?  I wasn't paying attention to my xchat icon, so I can't see if you directed anything towards me
2008-05-29T21:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	unr3a1	not lately no :)
