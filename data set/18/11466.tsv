2009-05-13T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb		zenwryly: there are still a few issues with Ext4 that are menitoned in the 9.04 release notes, but it should be good enough for most users,   but to be sure they should back up  stuff elsewhere as well
2009-05-13T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!notes
2009-05-13T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!sudo
2009-05-13T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb		oh  the bot has gone bye bye or something
2009-05-13T02:34:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	the bot has gone for a walk
2009-05-13T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Seveas	any idea why?
2009-05-13T02:35:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	no. But its owner is aware and presumablt working his ass of to get the bot back
2009-05-13T02:35:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	it tries to bite but fails
2009-07-19T00:15:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	damn you :P
2009-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	(the damn you refered to you beating me to the correct answer by one line of chat :))
2009-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Seveas	hmm?
2009-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Seveas	well learn to touch type if you don't know how already, and you might be able to beat me  sometime :D
2009-07-19T00:18:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	I actually had to look up where it lived, I have it bound to [flag key] + T so I never use the menu to find it :)
2009-07-19T00:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Seveas	you can get a few programs for that from the Ubuntu repo by the way
2010-02-13T15:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Seveas	:)  yep that's what I was on about,  and I assumed that could also be done on OS X
2010-02-13T15:37:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	I guess so. It has a terminal with a bsd-based-ish userland. Wouldn't be surprised if it has an md5sum command :)
2010-02-13T16:28:00.000Z	Seveas	sebsebseb	meh, it's in a good ppa (mozillateam knows what they do) so just use it ;)
2010-02-13T16:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Seveas	well  having to add ppa's in the first place (or install the software some other way) for  major later stuff, Firefox, Open Office, etc, or  wait for the next release, is a bit silly really, but whatever I guess. Also some users will find it difficult to add a ppa.
