2008-01-30T23:44:00.000Z	rodolfo		hey guys. I am running into problems when trying to install guifications. I've searched for libnotify, libpurple, guifications and all related -dev packages on synaptic and installed them all. everything runs fine after the './configure' command, but when i type make and hit enter, this is what i got: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/54084/
2008-01-30T23:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	why are you compoiling guifications
2008-01-30T23:45:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	excuse me?
2008-01-30T23:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	why are you compiling guifications
2008-01-30T23:46:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	because the file (itself) tells me to do that
2008-01-30T23:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	not a reason to do that
2008-01-30T23:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	there is a package:
2008-01-30T23:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	use it instead of compiling
2008-01-30T23:48:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	you mean that there is a deb and -ready-to-install vesion of it on the universal repo?
2008-01-30T23:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	i gave you the package name
2008-01-30T23:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	and yes
2008-01-30T23:50:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	hold on im checking this out
2008-01-30T23:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	sudo apt-get install pidgin-guifications or go into synaptic andd search for that.
2008-01-30T23:51:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	but I already have...
2008-01-30T23:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	so what's wrong?
2008-01-30T23:51:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	all this time trying to get it installed myself and it is available [pidgin plugins] >_<
2008-01-30T23:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	rodolfo	search for a package in the ubuntu repos first (enable all non-developer repos from software sources), if not there try getdeb
2008-01-30T23:53:00.000Z	rodolfo	kbrooks	yup. i will from now on x_x
