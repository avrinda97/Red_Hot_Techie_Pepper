2005-06-30T10:40:00.000Z	Octane		look you can do it without a password
2005-06-30T10:41:00.000Z	Octane		i just want to ubuntu to prompt for a pw when i do sudo
2005-06-30T10:43:00.000Z	Octane		so there is no way to make ubuntu not request a password when I do sudo as a certain user?
2005-06-30T10:44:00.000Z	ale_	Octane	did you try adding the line "<username> ALL=(ALL) ALL" to /etc/sudoers?
2005-06-30T10:44:00.000Z	Octane	ale_	yes
2005-06-30T10:45:00.000Z	Octane		oh shit

2005-06-30T10:45:00.000Z	ale_		well, it doesn't...
2005-06-30T10:45:00.000Z	Octane		actually yes that line asks you for a pw
2005-06-30T10:45:00.000Z	ale_		it's working here...
2005-06-30T10:46:00.000Z	ale_		i wrote it once, and then...
