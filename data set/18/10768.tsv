2007-05-20T11:47:00.000Z	ffm		 Is there anyway to capture a digital vidoe that is playing in WMP on the web? THere is no way for me to download it directly from the site.
2007-05-20T11:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	I think something like mencoder/mplayer could do that...
2007-05-20T11:48:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	It uses an activex control to disply it.
2007-05-20T11:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	have you got the location of the stream?
2007-05-20T11:48:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	the url of the page it is embeedded on, yes
2007-05-20T11:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	well then you might want to try reading its source to track down the originating media.
2007-05-20T11:49:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	http://www.pe.com/video/index.html?nvid=145357&shu=1
2007-05-20T11:50:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	I haven't got the time to myself. I'm afraid you'll just have to read the source to hunt it down if you really want to.
2008-03-01T21:39:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	have you tried plugging it in?
2008-03-01T21:39:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	yeah, it's not mounting.
2008-03-01T21:39:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	I don't think it's a USB mass storage device
2008-03-01T21:39:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	but it mounted...
2008-03-01T21:40:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	no.
2008-03-01T21:40:00.000Z	PriceChild	ffm	sorry misread you
2008-03-01T21:44:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	I just plugged it in, he'res what appeared in dmesg: http://pastebin.ca/924694
2008-03-01T21:46:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	hm... I was able to access it with "rioutil" , but sadly it's CLI only
2008-03-01T22:00:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	having a CLI only interface for this music player is probably a good thing, cause it forced me to relearn some basic BASH "while" loops.
2008-03-01T22:03:00.000Z	ffm	PriceChild	now a question, the files, when downloaded, now have "filenames" like "C:\Foo\Bar\baz.wma" . (see http://pastebin.ca/924713). Is there a regexp I can use to strip all but what's after the \ ?
