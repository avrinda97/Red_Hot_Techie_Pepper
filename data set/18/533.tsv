2012-01-05T12:00:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	what did you do to break it?
2012-01-05T12:00:00.000Z	rf5	Ben64	manually install another version of openssl
2012-01-05T12:01:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	manual meaning compile?
2012-01-05T12:01:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	why? : /
2012-01-05T12:02:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	should never do stuff like that on ubuntu
2012-01-05T12:03:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	i'd imagine it wouldn't be fine on debian either
2012-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	i wouldn't say yes 100%
2012-01-05T12:39:00.000Z	Ben64	rf5	you shouldn't use that language as well
