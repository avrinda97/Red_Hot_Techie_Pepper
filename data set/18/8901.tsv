2007-09-05T08:10:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	it is w32codecs, it isn't in the main repos, they are doubtfully even needed for his avi, I can't think of an avi combination that needs them
2007-09-17T08:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	you realize that when you login to a session what happens right?
2007-09-17T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	you seem to be thinking in windows terms, the world of registries and whatnot
2007-09-17T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	bringing up a gui is very basic, it literally runs a script that launches a bunch of crap
2007-09-17T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	most composite managers, realizing this, offer a --replace option so that you don't have to edit that script to launch that composite window manager, so you can put beryl --replace or whatever it is in the sessions startup commands
2007-09-17T08:43:00.000Z	Zemus	bruenig	I'm using the --replace option now, but I don't want to replace it, I want to make it default. Even replacing it as a startup script is still replacement... not making it the default manager.
2007-09-17T08:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	ok, right, well realizing now what happens during startup which is a script literally runs and launches a bunch of crap, you will have to find that script and edit it
2007-09-17T08:44:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	I can help with xfce, but I don't know where that script resides on other DEs
2007-09-17T08:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	I understand you, but basically you will need to edit scripts to get it done
2007-09-17T08:50:00.000Z	Zemus	bruenig	really? Sounds good, where should I start?
2007-09-17T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	one thing you might want to do though is drop this official notion of "default," It smacks of some sort of official registry or something. It literally just launches one program after another during the gui login, starts with the desktop, then the panel then the wm and so forth, there is no real official default, just whatever the script runs. But yeah i don't know gnome well so I can't help on that
2007-09-17T08:52:00.000Z	Zemus	bruenig	as of right now, it is launching metacity immediately -- I'm sure there must be a way to make it launch compiz easily instead. So that it boots up to compiz, instead of booting up to metacity? Very common.
2007-09-17T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	it's not very common amongst ubuntu people at least, they just generally go with the replace thing
2007-09-17T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	if you can find someone who knows where gnome puts its session files, it will tell you the script and you can go from there
2007-09-17T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	it might be in /etc/X11/sessions?
2007-09-17T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	is there something in there like a gnome.desktop or something?
2007-09-17T08:56:00.000Z	bruenig	Zemus	this is not really an effects question, but can you look in that directory /etc/X11/sessions
2007-09-17T08:58:00.000Z	Zemus	bruenig	sorry, I've got quite a few windows open
