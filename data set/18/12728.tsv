2006-03-16T17:59:00.000Z	Volmarias		Hi, I've installed ubuntu, but the networking isn't working. How do I set up my machine to get its IP via DHCP?

2006-03-16T06:00:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	Ah, this brings us to another fun part. I do System -> Administration -> Networking, and I get the "working" mouse icon for 5 seconds, and then it's the pointer again and I'm back to square one. What gives?
2006-03-16T06:01:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	In fact, I think clicking on anything under administration does that. Do I have to somehow login as root (which I didn't think was allowed/possible)
2006-03-16T06:02:00.000Z	lightstep	Volmarias	dpkg-reconfigure for some package should allow you this configuration too
2006-03-16T06:03:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	I'm a nitwit. Please speak to me accordingly.
2006-03-16T06:03:00.000Z	lightstep	Volmarias	it's the console interface for the configuration. i'll go look for the magic word
2006-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	Heck with it. I'll just reinstall.
2006-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	Thanks for the help though
2006-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	lightstep	Volmarias	before that, try running network-admin
2006-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	ok
2006-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	how
2006-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	lightstep	Volmarias	from the shell or something
2006-03-16T06:11:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	fantastic, it just wasn't configured or enabled
2006-03-16T06:12:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	Great! networking works!
2006-03-16T06:12:00.000Z	lightstep	Volmarias	still, not having the administration menu working is a big bug. maybe someone at ##gnome will know something about it
2006-03-16T06:13:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	Oh. I thought I just misconfigured something
2006-03-16T06:13:00.000Z	Volmarias	lightstep	I'll ask there, thanks
