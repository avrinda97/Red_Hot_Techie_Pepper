2008-01-23T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	use sudo or gksudo for graphical editors
2008-01-23T16:10:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	but then how do i edit a file, lets say its /etc/iproute2/rt_tables?
2008-01-23T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	sudo nano /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
2008-01-23T16:11:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	thank you
2008-01-23T16:12:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	how would i then create a new file in a dir?
2008-01-23T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	sudo nano /etc/new_file
2008-01-25T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	why do you want two ISP's connected to your machine
2008-01-25T21:20:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	My adsl is capped, so i have only 2gigs per month, so I want to use another line to download that big stuff and use my adsl to surf
2008-01-25T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	that is impracticle
2008-01-25T21:22:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	i can get it to work in windows really well
2008-01-25T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	iptables/quos traffic shaping is the only real way to manage that, that I'm aware of
2008-01-25T21:24:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	well im really new here so i dont actually know how to do that stuff :s All the tutorials i have found use 2 eth connections
2008-01-25T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	what software are you using in windows to manage your connection ?
2008-01-25T21:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	how are you telling windows "if a file = 2meg of bigger go here, else go the other one"
2008-01-25T21:28:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	i dont do that, what i do is, i route the other connection to a spacific IP, its actually a proxy server, then i just configure a download manager to download from that proxy only
2008-01-25T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Yonie	do the same in liunux then
2008-01-25T21:29:00.000Z	Yonie	ikonia	trying :P
