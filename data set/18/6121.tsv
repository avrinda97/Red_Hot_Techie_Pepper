2008-06-27T01:18:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	you'd only need a gui to edit the config :-)
2008-06-27T01:24:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	do you have a windows ssh client? (not sure if putty does sftp)
2008-06-27T01:24:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	cygwin does, though
2008-06-27T01:25:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	if that knows sftp, sure
2008-06-27T01:27:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	do you have filezilla already?
2008-06-27T01:28:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	ah, well... I meant "already installed" :-)
2008-06-27T01:30:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	in ubuntu, try 'ssh localhost', if you can log in, ssh is running :-)
2008-06-27T01:30:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	if ssh is running, an sftp client should work w/o changing your current setup
2008-06-27T01:31:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	hmm, ssh isn't running then
2008-06-27T01:32:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	'netstat -anl | grep 22' <-- that is likely empty
2008-06-27T01:33:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	er, ah, I meant anything that looks like this: "tcp        0      0 :::22                       :::*                        LISTEN"
2008-06-27T01:33:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	actually I should have said '... | grep 22 | grep LISTEN' :-)
2008-06-27T01:36:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	a remote desktop might get you clipboard sharing, probably not file sharing :-)
2008-06-27T01:38:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	meanwhile, if you can't ssh to yourself that probably needs to be fixed first/also :-) (my guess is sshd isn't running)
2008-06-27T01:43:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	probably sshd is in ssh
2008-06-27T01:43:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	or listen to beli :P
2008-06-27T01:48:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	or, why bother, just set your firewall to only accept to port 22 from your VM
2008-06-27T01:49:00.000Z	mwoehlke	Gaming4JC	that's how my home box is set up, port 22 connect only allowed from the LAN or the IP's my work owns (so I can connect from work)
