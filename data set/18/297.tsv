2012-06-12T03:41:00.000Z	nutty42		I've got a question about 12.10 "Quantal", my distro apparently automatically updated to it. Does anyone have any idea how it could have happened? I installed a few -dev packages today, but other than that I have no idea how it happened. Ideas?
2012-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Ubuntu will not automatically upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu, certainly not to a development version.
2012-06-12T03:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Why do you think you're running Ubuntu 12.10?
2012-06-12T03:45:00.000Z	nutty42	Jordan_U	the TTYs list 12.10 Quantal when I login.. in the Details section of the System Settings it does still list "12.04" however.
2012-06-12T03:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Can you pastebin the output of "lsb_release -a"?

2012-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Could you pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list?

2012-06-12T03:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Odd, that looks correct (except for the few third party repos setup for oneiric).
2012-06-12T03:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	What is the contents of /etc/issue ?
2012-06-12T03:53:00.000Z	nutty42	Jordan_U	Ubuntu quantal (development branch) \n \l
2012-06-12T03:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Can you pastebin the outptu of "apt-cache policy base-files"?
2012-06-12T03:54:00.000Z	nutty42	Jordan_U	I know it seems pretty strange to me considering I hadn't done anything manually

2012-06-12T03:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Does "sudo apt-get install --reinstall base-files" change the contents of /etc/issue ?
2012-06-12T03:59:00.000Z	nutty42	Jordan_U	no it did not change
2012-06-12T04:05:00.000Z	nutty42	Jordan_U	thanks for your help, at this time I don't think the Quantal problem is a huge issue, nothing seems to be broken!
2012-06-12T04:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nutty42	Please file a bug report anyway, just becuase it shouldn't have happened and may be a symptom of something worse.
