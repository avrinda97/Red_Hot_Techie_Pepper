2010-01-22T21:39:00.000Z	_raven_		can audacity split an audio-file into smaller own files by setting markers?
2010-01-22T21:39:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	dunno about markets but i click and audacity splits the files
2010-01-22T21:41:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	ok but i mean one 60 minute file saving into 10 minute files
2010-01-22T21:41:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	i dont see why that would be an issue, but best to have a look at the audacity support docs
2010-01-22T21:42:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	how are you doing it
2010-01-22T21:43:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	i just selected portions of the file and exported those
2010-01-22T21:43:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	ah i see
2010-01-22T21:43:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	but i mean something automatic like wavelab does it
2010-01-22T21:44:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	that i dont know, try the docs or a specific audacity support channel if it exists?
2010-05-20T17:42:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	histo obviously this kernel is not able to work with the network card (asus eee 1005ha)
2010-05-20T17:43:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	obviously, how is reverting to an older kernel going to fix that?
2010-05-20T17:43:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	are you trying to get the ethernet or wirless card to work?
2010-05-20T17:43:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	because it does not work any more since a new kernel was installed
2010-05-20T17:43:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	wired
2010-05-20T17:47:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	best check that its enabled in the bios, fwiw, the kernel updates only pertain to small revisions, so the previous kernel you used is not .31 which isnt even used by ubuntu
2010-05-20T17:47:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	it is how to change the kernel
2010-05-20T17:48:00.000Z	_raven_	acicula	i used the 31.10 rt before and there it worked
2010-05-20T17:48:00.000Z	acicula	_raven_	if it doesnot show in lspci changing the kernel wont fix your problem, to change a kernel install the appropriate kernel version package or build one yourself
