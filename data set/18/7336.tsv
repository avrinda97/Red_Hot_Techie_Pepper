2009-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	is the partition you want to boot hd2 partition 5?
2009-04-07T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	how many physical hard drives do you have?
2009-04-07T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	how many physical drives do you have?
2009-04-07T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	use pastebin
2009-04-07T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	can you pastebin the outrput of sudo fdisk -l  as well please
2009-04-07T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	if you only have 1 HDD the drive number will always be ZERO
2009-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	the partition numbe is the output from fdisk -l. if you look at the partition number you want to boot in the output and minuus 1 you will get the partition number to grub (grub numbers start at 0, not 1)
2009-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	so to boot /dev/sda1  the grub line is (hd0,0)   for /dev/sda2  (hd0,1)  etc
2009-04-07T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	mark /dev/sda6 as bootable then use: (hd0,5)
2009-04-07T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	its a function in fdisk / cfdisk
2009-04-07T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	sudo cfdisk /dev/sda
2009-04-07T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	move cursor down with down arrow to the big linux partition, use lete and right arows to select the word bootable and press enter, I'm unsure if you can do this on a booted system like this so you may want to look at using a live cd of some kind
2009-04-07T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	select the partition with up and down, left and right cursor to choose the bottom option, enter to select, remember to write your changes to the disk
2009-04-07T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	you just need to mark the different partition as bootable, thats all it is
2009-04-07T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	cool, ok so you can see cfdisk with the partitions visible, yes?
2009-04-07T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mib_3y3dl51w	pm?
