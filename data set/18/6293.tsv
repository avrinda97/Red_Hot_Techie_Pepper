2008-05-28T05:12:00.000Z	kavon		Hi, I'm having a problem with my Nvidia drivers. I updated to the -17 kernel recently and my computer boots in low graphics mode in both -17 and -16 kernel verisons. Whichever I choose in Grub. I have an Nvidia Quadro NVS 140M video card. How can I just go about completely reinstalling my Nvidia drivers?
2008-05-28T05:13:00.000Z	fde	kavon	Many are having that issue... many report that using recovery mode and hitting ESC seems to fix things.
2008-05-28T05:14:00.000Z	kavon	fde	recovery mode with the -16 kernel option?
2008-05-28T05:15:00.000Z	fde	kavon	no... -17 ... also, first make sure you have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24-17-generic installed.
2008-05-28T05:16:00.000Z	kavon	fde	yea synaptic says it's installed, i'm gonna reboot in -17 recovery and see how it goes
2008-05-28T05:31:00.000Z	kavon	fde	i'm going to guess ur helping chugg with  the same problem i have. i tried xfix and it didn't work out
2008-05-28T05:33:00.000Z	fde	kavon	you too
2008-05-28T05:33:00.000Z	kavon	fde	yea, i did the recovery and xfix didn't work out with the -17 recovery
2008-05-28T05:36:00.000Z	kavon	fde	i tried regular -16, did sudo nvidia-xconfig, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg, i'll go try -16 recovery and use xfix and see how it goes.
2008-05-28T05:37:00.000Z	fde	kavon	tried -17 recovery mode?
2008-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	kavon	fde	yea i'm in it now after trying it. did all the redetecting thing and I have a proper resolution, but the nvidia menu says it's not in use and to use that nvidia configure ocmmand. glxinfo gives me a lot of missing display stuff
2008-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	kavon	fde	i'll brb and try -16 recovery
2008-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	fde	kavon	-17
2008-05-28T05:43:00.000Z	kavon	fde	-16 recovry using xfix then going resume didn't fix it. nvidia  still complains of not being in use. Should I reinstall the driver in -17? How do i do this cleanly?
2008-05-28T05:44:00.000Z	fde	kavon	sudo aptitude install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24-17-generic
2008-05-28T05:44:00.000Z	kavon	fde	ok done, restart with -17 recovery??
2008-05-28T05:45:00.000Z	fde	kavon	I'm not sure recovery will be required, just restart for now
2008-05-28T05:45:00.000Z	kavon	fde	alright
