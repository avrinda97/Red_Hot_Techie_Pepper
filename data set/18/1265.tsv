2012-08-21T00:09:00.000Z	minashokry		hello, df command reports that "/run" is 100% in use, what can I do to fix this?
2012-08-21T00:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 /run is special
2012-08-21T00:10:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	so is this a problem I need to fix? or this is normal?
2012-08-21T00:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 its normal.. why are you even worried aboiut it?
2012-08-21T00:11:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	because I am trying to run jenkins and it fails to start with a message in logs saying "no space left on device" I am sure I have enough free space everywhere, when I checked df, only /run is 100% used so I thought it can be related

2012-08-21T00:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 /run/ is a special filesystem in ram
2012-08-21T00:13:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	yes, I understand this, my question is that, is this related to my problem that jenkins report that there is no space left on disk or not? and if it is, how can I have more space for this tmpfs?
2012-08-21T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 no idea if its related or not..  no idea what jenkins is..
2012-08-21T00:15:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	don't worry about what jenkins is, can I have more space for this /run fs? how?
2012-08-21T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 no idea.. i dont see why the app would care about /run/
2012-08-21T00:18:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	it seems the app is extracting some files to start running and it seems it is using this path :-S
2012-08-21T00:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 a read of --> http://askubuntu.com/questions/169495/what-are-run-lock-and-run-shm-used-for   shows that /tmp MAY be using /run
2012-08-21T00:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 i would guess thats what its trying to use
2012-08-21T00:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	minashokry	 so move /tmp/ to a real partiion perhaps
2012-08-21T00:20:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	ok, thanks will try
2012-08-21T00:26:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	ok, solved it by configuring the app to extract its files to another path (/tmp) instead of /var/run/
2012-08-21T00:26:00.000Z	minashokry	Dr_Willis	thanks
