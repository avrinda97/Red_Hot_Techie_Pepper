2006-09-12T08:43:00.000Z	_Dink		Who here wants to be stumped with an ati problem :P
2006-09-12T08:44:00.000Z	_Dink		honestly....if you use sparc i would use a kernel from kernel.org ...
2006-09-12T08:45:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	?
2006-09-12T08:46:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	what would the advantaged be of using a kernel from kernel.org?
2006-09-12T08:46:00.000Z	_Dink	Rimtech	you get to tell it what to use and which modules to setup
2006-09-12T08:46:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	what video card ?
2006-09-12T08:47:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	that one is really hard to get working, i spend hours on that card before
2006-09-12T08:47:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	former gentoo user, i know how to compile a kernel
2006-09-12T08:48:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	lemme do a quick google and see if anything sparcs the solution of how i solved it
2006-09-12T08:48:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	I do remember getting it working
2006-09-12T08:49:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	did you use the driver and instructions off of ATI's website?
2006-09-12T08:50:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	do you have /dev/shm support in your kernel?
2006-09-12T08:54:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_ATI_Drivers#Kernel_Configuration
2006-09-12T08:55:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	I know it's a gentoo page but i think that is why my ati drivers weren't working, incorrect kernel config
2006-09-12T08:56:00.000Z	Rimtech	_Dink	on that same page there is also some info concerning config files for x and so on, might be worth it to check that out too
2006-09-12T09:04:00.000Z	_Dink	Rimtech	it all looks fine :(
