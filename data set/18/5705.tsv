2009-03-05T20:37:00.000Z	ChrisW		hey all, I'm looking to replace windows vista on a friend's laptop with Ubuntu, hwo can I resize the existing NTFS partition to make way for an ext3 (I should still pick ext3, right?!) partition?
2009-03-05T20:37:00.000Z	ChrisW		(this is all running off a live cd)
2009-03-05T20:37:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	the installer should be able to do it for you, otherwise use GPARTED.  MAKE. BACKUPS. FIRST.
2009-03-05T20:38:00.000Z	ChrisW	Cycom	I have free reign to destroy the data, but they'd prefer if it survived ;-)
2009-03-05T20:38:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	during the partitioning step it should offer.  or you can pick "manual"
2009-03-05T20:39:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	I'd go with gparted then.  got another blank CD/flash drive?
2009-03-05T20:39:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	also, windows MUST have been shut down properly to repartition.
2009-03-05T20:49:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	personally, I'd worry about getting windows un-broken first.
2009-03-05T20:50:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	fix the virus-ridden windows, then install ubuntu.
2009-03-05T20:50:00.000Z	ChrisW	Cycom	er.... my question was: if linux had mounted the ntfs partition and not closed in cleanly, then what would I do?
2009-03-05T21:03:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mount+unclean+ntfs+partition&l=1
2009-03-05T21:04:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	you get that?
2009-03-05T21:04:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	literally the first hit.
2009-03-05T21:05:00.000Z	ChrisW	Cycom	yeah, I know I can force mount it, but that doesn't help solve the problem... how do I get it so that I don't have to force mount it without using windows?
2009-03-05T21:05:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	if you force mount it, it marks it as clean.
2009-03-05T21:06:00.000Z	ChrisW	Cycom	I did, it hasn't
2009-03-05T21:07:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	then your partition is pretty borked.  I'd just reinstall windows, then install linux.  Maybe mount the partition and copy the data off first.
2009-03-05T21:07:00.000Z	Cycom	ChrisW	you're likely going to have to reinstall windows ANYHOW if it's all virusey.
