2004-11-02T11:52:00.000Z	eclipse		ok, nice
2004-11-02T11:52:00.000Z	eclipse		it's so much easier to install apps with apt than freaking dep. hell rpm
2004-11-02T11:53:00.000Z	eclipse		huh?
2004-11-02T11:54:00.000Z	eclipse		man, i tried to install apt for suse 9.1 but it wouldn't
2004-11-02T11:54:00.000Z	eclipse		dep. hell
2004-11-02T11:55:00.000Z	eclipse		bob2:i'm with u man
2004-11-02T11:55:00.000Z	eclipse		true
2004-11-02T11:56:00.000Z	eclipse		i tried to install mplayer for suse 9.1 and i almost went crazy trying to get it installed
2004-11-02T11:57:00.000Z	eclipse		mafia: what;s that?
2004-11-02T11:58:00.000Z	eclipse		by the way, anyone noticed that xmms on linux sounds better than winamp on windows?
2004-11-02T11:59:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	unless you use dee3 with winamp, i wish there were something similar for xmms or rhythmbox :(
2004-11-02T11:59:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	besides, they are just decoding the mp3 and outputting it to the speakers, if you don't enhance the sound, it should sound the same
2004-11-02T12:10:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	and All In Wonder Radeon...it's PCI, SDR SGRAM, with a Radeon 7200 chipset
2004-11-02T12:12:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	actually, i'm not using radeon drivers, ati provides them only for 8500 and up, i'm using built in X module, that's as far as my radeon specific support goes.
2004-11-02T12:15:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	no, there are no drivers for a card old as mine, you see
2004-11-02T12:15:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	it's just what's built into X
2004-11-02T12:31:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	yes, he's too dump
2004-11-02T12:33:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	eclipse	that or they're just having fun at your expense
