2008-10-22T15:05:00.000Z	jim_p		does anyone know what latex is? a program? a language? a set of both?
2008-10-22T15:05:00.000Z	jim_p		!latex
2008-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	erki	jim_p	I would probably describe it as an environment. It has binary stuff, lots of scripts and I seem to remember that it differs from TeX language-wise.
2008-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	jim_p	erki	so i can say to someone who is looking for some program to do latex in linux, that texlive is one?
2008-10-22T15:09:00.000Z	erki	jim_p	Hmm, I'm not sure texlive includes an editor. But you can definately compile latex using texlive.
2008-10-22T15:10:00.000Z	erki	jim_p	Personally I use Eclipse + TeXlipse for LaTeX editing, but I think some might find that to be excessive :P
2008-10-22T15:10:00.000Z	jim_p	erki	or magnetron : some site that has tex live? i mean the devs site to use it as a reference
2008-10-22T15:11:00.000Z	erki	jim_p	http://www.tug.org/texlive/
