2005-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	pixil9		It's great that dell has the best support.. except they have 100x the problems
2005-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	pixil9		so no shit they need good support
2005-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	pixil9		It's like.. how about we just make a good product from the start and we don't need a 10,000 person support department
2005-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	pixil9		we need 1000
2005-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	pixil9		fucking dell.
2005-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	pixil9		lol
2005-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	pixil9		100 bux for a no name PSU
2005-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	pixil9		ya.. cuz their computer suck so fucking bad.. they need a crazy support program
2005-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	pixil9		All I'm saying is if they'd just get a custom built machine
2005-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	pixil9		they'd have 100x less problems then their dell
2005-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	chazwurth	pixil9	Unfortunately there isn't much in the way of well-built reasonably-priced hardware for home consumers. And you don't 'get' a custom-built machine. You build a custom-built machine. People don't know how and don't have time for the hassle.
2005-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	pixil9	chazwurth	I have about 3 places within 15 minutes that build machines for you. so yes you do "get" them.
2005-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	pixil9		i build mine.
2005-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	pixil9	chazwurth	So i dunno wtf you're smoking.
2005-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	pixil9		but me.. i smoke weed
2005-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	pixil9		and it's doobie time
2005-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	pixil9		later
2005-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	chazwurth	pixil9	I build mine as well. But the average consumer doesn't know what parts are what. And trusting a mom-and-pop shop to choose for them is at least as risky as trusting Dell.
