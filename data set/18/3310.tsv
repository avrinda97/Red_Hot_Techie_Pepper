2010-01-06T05:58:00.000Z	Shwack		I am ready to scrap Ubuntu
2010-01-06T05:59:00.000Z	Shwack		All I wanted to do was change my password....I came in here and asked -  more than 5 people said   "sudo passwd shwack"    i typed it in and everything worked fine.   When I restarted my computer nothing worked.....I get errors after logging in and my dekstop won't show up.   I've tried everything and I've spent more than a few moments in this room earlier trying to figure out my problem.    I need real help...... If you really know what you're doing can yo
2010-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	whomever told you to 'sudo password shwack' to change your own password was ignorant
2010-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	it was more than 5 people in this room
2010-01-06T06:02:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	- i'm guessing typing sudo wasn't the cause of my problem then, as you are basically offering the same advice minus the sudo
2010-01-06T06:02:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	No, I can't conceive of any circumstance where changing one's password would cause a system to become unusuable.
2010-01-06T06:04:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	Sure, if you want to pastebin them, I can take a look.
2010-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	Ah, so it sounds like the password for your encrypted data is your old password, while your login password has been changed.  I would surmise that when you login with your new password, that new password is used to decrypt your home directory and fails.  The solution would be to change the password used to decrypt your data or change your login password back to the old one.  I would suggest doing the latter as a test.
2010-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	I have already done that with no success
2010-01-06T06:08:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	- it advises me to try ecryptfs-mount-private    which fails because I dont know the pass"phrase"  i only know the password.  There is a manual on recovering your passphrase with your password which I followed and that fails as well.
2010-01-06T06:09:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	With both the old and new passwords?
2010-01-06T06:09:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	yes with both old and new passwords - tried 10,000 times and then double checked 20,000 more times
2010-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	I have already tried that
2010-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	How about this one? #
2010-01-06T06:18:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	Have you tried resetting your password back to your old one?  I think you mentioned you have but I wanted to make sure.
2010-01-06T06:21:00.000Z	Shwack	gdb	- ok, but definitely don't think Ubuntu is ready for the average user.
2010-01-06T06:24:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	Here's another resource that may be helpful: http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7568/3/
2010-01-06T06:26:00.000Z	gdb	Shwack	Good luck!
