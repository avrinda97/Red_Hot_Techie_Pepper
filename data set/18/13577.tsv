2005-11-03T14:13:00.000Z	qt2		I was wondering... i've heard about all sorts of horror stories with ATI cards and linux... if they were my only two options, would you reccmoend upgrading to a ATI Radeon 9200 or staying with a Geforce 4 MX 440?
2005-11-03T14:13:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	funny i have a geforce mx 440, i switched it with my radeon 9800 pro for linux lol
2005-11-03T14:14:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	so you're saying it'd be better to keep the geforce?
2005-11-03T14:15:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	well I only barrowd that card from a friend but no, i wouldnt spend money on it
2005-11-03T14:15:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	what do you do in linux that needs such a good card?
2005-11-03T14:16:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	games via wine.
2005-11-03T14:16:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	and i'd be getting the card for free so... :|
2005-11-03T14:16:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	well humm i donnu 9200 is outdated as well so
2005-11-03T14:16:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	i was just wondering weather i should try switching out the geforce or not.
2005-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	well shure if its free then go for it
2005-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	it's not that outdated... not nearly as much as the geforce is. o.O;
2005-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	tru dat '.'
2005-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	Korio		Does anybody now how to launch CXoffice?
2005-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	i was just wondering how horrible installing an ati card is, and what the problems are...
2005-11-03T14:18:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	Well its not that hard lol.... but nvidia is way easier. There is a tutorial for Ati drivers on ubuntuforums.org
2005-11-03T14:18:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	ah, well, i've heard stuff about drivers causing lockups the like.
2005-11-03T14:19:00.000Z	qt2	Korio	however, considering the performance jump, i'm probably going to give it a shot.
2005-11-03T14:19:00.000Z	Korio	qt2	not shure about that i didnt use it for long
