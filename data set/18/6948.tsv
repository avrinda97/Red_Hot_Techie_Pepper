2008-04-16T00:46:00.000Z	Myrtti	scudDA	you probably don't have the repos enabled
2008-04-16T00:46:00.000Z	scudDA	Myrtti	I have normal repos and medibuntu
2008-04-16T00:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	scudDA	gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad is on universe
2008-04-16T00:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	scudDA	so do you have the tick on Community-maintained Open Source software
