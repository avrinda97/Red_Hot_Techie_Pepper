2009-01-08T20:27:00.000Z	fbond		Hi, a colleague's X setup got broken by an update today.  He's using nvidia.  Is anyone aware of this?
2009-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	i have seen it, but i use driver 173, not 177
2009-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	fbond	omnydevi	So switch to 173 will fix the issue?
2009-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	177 wont run on my machine for one reason or another, but 173 is fine too, i think 173 is still in beta
2009-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	most likely, i would use envyng
2009-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	omnydevi		er, 177 is in beta
2009-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	omnydevi		i installed 177 about 2 days ago, took a few hours to get my system graphical again
2009-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	fbond	omnydevi	Um, he's on Hardy.
2009-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	thats fine
2009-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	fbond	omnydevi	There is no 177 in hardy, right?
2009-01-08T20:30:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	envyng will tell you, i dont see why a graphic driver version would be different
2009-01-08T20:30:00.000Z	omnydevi		i use intrepid, so i really cant tell you
2009-01-08T20:31:00.000Z	omnydevi		i know what envy is :D
2009-01-08T20:31:00.000Z	fbond		!envy | fbond
2009-01-08T20:32:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	i would get envyng, uninstall the driver he has now, then run envyng again and install the driver is suggests to use. that did it for me at least
2009-01-08T20:32:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	make sure he reboots after uninstalling the driver, and again after installing
2009-01-08T20:33:00.000Z	fbond	omnydevi	bah, I want to figure out what broke it, not recommened a relatively-inexperienced user to go down an unsupported route.
2009-01-08T20:33:00.000Z	omnydevi	fbond	do what suits you, happy hunting :D
