2009-07-31T19:07:00.000Z	len	nanotube	I have asus g50vt and my numeric pad is not working properly and I got a tutorial who says to modify keyboard on xorg, but the section on my ubuntu doesnt exists
2009-07-31T19:07:00.000Z	nanotube	len	create the section. xorg will parse whatever is there.
2009-07-31T19:07:00.000Z	nanotube	len	and use fancy autoset for everything else
2009-07-31T19:09:00.000Z	len	nanotube	but don really exactly know what params I should put on Input device, the only thing the tutorial ask to do is to put Option  "XkbOptions" "numpad:microsoft" in this section
2009-07-31T19:10:00.000Z	len	nanotube	it's ok to just put this line inside the section?
2009-07-31T19:10:00.000Z	nanotube	len	see this thread, post # 2
2009-07-31T19:10:00.000Z	nanotube	len	for example of section
2009-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	len	nanotube	where's the link?
2009-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	nanotube	len	oh whoops, here's the link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=60336
2009-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	nanotube	len	no you don't want to just stick it into an empty "section inputdevice" section, since then xorg won't know which inputdevice it applies to
2009-07-31T19:12:00.000Z	len	nanotube	i'll try here. Ty for help
2009-07-31T19:13:00.000Z	nanotube	len	also see last post in that thread, for apparently a gui-way to do this
2009-07-31T19:31:00.000Z	len	nanotube	the opt found to do this using UI doenst work, gonna try using xorg
2009-07-31T19:33:00.000Z	len	nanotube	is there anyway to reload xorg without restarting gnome?
2009-07-31T19:33:00.000Z	nanotube	len	no, gnome runs on top of xorg...
