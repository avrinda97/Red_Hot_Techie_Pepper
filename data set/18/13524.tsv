2006-01-10T07:16:00.000Z	Steve|		so whats the advantage of a live cd, other than being able to boot it off the cd
2006-01-10T07:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	only that you don't have to touch your HD to try ubuntu out
2006-01-10T07:19:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	10gigs would be a minimum for desktop use
2006-01-10T07:20:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	it depends what pkgs u want to install
2006-01-10T07:20:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	I'd recommend 10gig for /usr & 2gig for /
2006-01-10T07:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	after u've installed ubuntu - u can add additional packages at any time - just download
2006-01-10T07:22:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	better if you try it out for yourself - the name of the pkg manager is 'synaptic'
2006-01-10T09:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	rubbish
2006-01-10T09:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	Steve|	some 802.11b/g cards don't have linux drivers...
