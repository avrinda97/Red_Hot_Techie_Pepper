2008-06-07T03:39:00.000Z	knight666		i gotta say, windows handles this better!
2008-06-07T03:39:00.000Z	knight666		why is there no "OMG YOU HAVE LESS THAN X MB OF FREE SPACE THIS IS LIKE TOTALLY NOT GOOD" message in ubuntu?
2008-06-07T03:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	knight666	Did you delete something that is still open in some application?
2008-06-07T03:40:00.000Z	knight666		honestly, would you have read it if i didn't cap it?
2008-06-07T03:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	knight666	There is for me, it pops up a little notification widget in the bottom right
2008-06-07T03:40:00.000Z	knight666	Jordan_U	i didn't get any :(
2008-06-07T03:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	knight666	I am having connection problems, so with regards to your deleted file not freeing up space, do any programs have an active file handle to it ( like your torrent program if it's one of your aforementioned torrents ) ?
2008-06-07T03:42:00.000Z	knight666	Jordan_U	is there a command to checking such a thing?
2008-06-07T03:42:00.000Z	knight666		or do i do "jsof | grep"?
2008-06-07T03:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	knight666	lsof | grep /path/to/file
