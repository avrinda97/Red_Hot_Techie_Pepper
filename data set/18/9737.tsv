2009-03-15T21:29:00.000Z	noiz	crdlb	i am guessing it looks messy as hell ,somone told me once it does :d
2009-03-15T21:31:00.000Z	crdlb	noiz	looks good :/ it's even using AGP 8x, which is the fastest mode possible
2009-03-15T21:31:00.000Z	noiz	crdlb	yeah but , when i open " hardware drivers" should there be any drivers there?
2009-03-15T21:31:00.000Z	noiz	crdlb	but i am guessing maby it is because i am not using the latest wine?
2009-03-15T21:32:00.000Z	crdlb	noiz	no, hardware drivers is generally just for proprietary drivers
2009-03-15T21:32:00.000Z	crdlb	noiz	it might help, but it's not the real problem
2009-03-15T21:32:00.000Z	noiz	crdlb	ok ty, but what is the real problem?
2009-03-15T21:32:00.000Z	crdlb	noiz	a not-very-fast video driver
