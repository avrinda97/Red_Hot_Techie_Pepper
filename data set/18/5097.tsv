2008-12-18T11:48:00.000Z	keepsake	sidhrt	Have you tried unplugging/reinserting the USB key?

2008-12-18T11:49:00.000Z	sidhrt	keepsake	yes. i have tried. it was working fine till yesterday.
2008-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	keepsake	sidhrt	Try "rmmod -f ehci_hcd" and see if that allows connection
2008-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	sidhrt	keepsake	it says operation not permitted
2008-12-18T11:51:00.000Z	keepsake	sidhrt	sudo, sorry
2008-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	keepsake	sidhrt	I find ehci_hcd kind of unreliable, sometimes it works perfectly, other times it doesn't work at all.
2008-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	sidhrt	keepsake	nothing happened.
2008-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	keepsake	sidhrt	Try connecting your USB drive again
