2010-09-19T04:25:00.000Z	ntr0py		it eclipse with sun java broken on ubuntu?
2010-09-19T04:26:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	did you get the gcj version of Eclipse, or the regular one?
2010-09-19T04:27:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	i took it from the std repos as i did with sun java on my x64 ubuntu 10.04
2010-09-19T04:28:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	i do get a segfault in com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse
2010-09-19T04:29:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	hmmm, looks like a problem with the xml parser, weird
2010-09-19T04:30:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	do any other Java apps run?
2010-09-19T04:34:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	it worked before but some ubdate seems to have broken thinks badly
2010-09-19T04:35:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	try installing libxerces2-java, maybe eclipse will use that instead of the sun packages classes
2010-09-19T04:36:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	i had installed 2.9.1
2010-09-19T04:39:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	other java apps and browser applets have no probs so far...
2010-09-19T04:41:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	this is what i get when i start eclipse freshly installed http://pastebin.com/cY9v1Wkg
2010-09-19T04:48:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	have you tried the 32bit java?
2010-09-19T04:49:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	not yet, it worked fine with x64 before and other apps have no problems ...
2010-09-19T04:50:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	I see that it's running the server vm, can you tell it to use the client vm?
2010-09-19T04:51:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	i dont know how i can do that
2010-09-19T04:57:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	pass -client to the java command
2010-09-19T04:57:00.000Z	mhall119	ntr0py	but reading the manpage, it seems 64-bit java only has the Server VM
2010-09-19T05:16:00.000Z	ntr0py	mhall119	strange i did reinstall libxerces2-java and tried to reboot with older kernel, couldnt load the nvidia module and rebootet again with current ubuntu kernel and now eclipse starts with no errors??!
