2005-07-08T11:57:00.000Z	zack_		windows can't format a drive > 137gb
2005-07-08T11:58:00.000Z	zack_		why two partitions
2005-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	zack_		windows will recognize it once formatted.
2005-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	zack_		i think.
2005-07-08T12:02:00.000Z	zack_		yes, how does one format a HD in fat 32 in linux.
2005-07-08T12:03:00.000Z	zack_		how do you use qtparted
2005-07-08T12:04:00.000Z	zack_		it comes on the ubuntu livecd?
2005-07-08T12:04:00.000Z	robitaille	zack_	 not sure if it's on the Ubuntu live CD...old habits never die;  I usually use Knoppix to play with my partitions :)
2005-07-08T12:05:00.000Z	zack_	robitaille	i have a knoppix cd too. how can i use it to format my hard drive?
2005-07-08T12:05:00.000Z	robitaille	zack_	 boot with it.  Then select qtparted from one of the application menu in Knoppix.
2005-07-08T12:05:00.000Z	zack_		i don't know how to use qtparted
2005-07-08T12:06:00.000Z	zack_		is it easy to use?
2005-07-08T12:06:00.000Z	zack_		specifically, will it recognize my external hard drive?
2005-07-08T12:06:00.000Z	robitaille	zack_	 qtparted is  pretty straight forward ...it's all graphical similar to parition magic
2005-07-08T12:06:00.000Z	robitaille	zack_	 not sure about the externalHD (never owned one...)
