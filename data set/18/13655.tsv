2008-01-03T06:34:00.000Z	bmk789		is there a good way to setup a proxy i can relay all web traffic through?
2008-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	squid?
2008-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	or tinyproxy
2008-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	or privoxy
2008-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	its pretty much just an install and works out of the box for most simple scenarios
2008-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	check wiki.ubuntu.com
2008-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	you know about tor + torbutton right?
2008-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	bmk789	khermans	tor?
2008-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	onion routing proxy
2008-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	bmk789	khermans	whats the advantage of tor over squid?
2008-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	tor allows you to browse anonymously, and squid is a cahcing web proxy -- litle different
2008-01-03T06:44:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	firefox has a local cache
2008-01-03T06:46:00.000Z	bmk789	khermans	good point
2008-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	if you run squid locally
2008-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	bmk789	khermans	?
2008-01-03T06:58:00.000Z	bmk789	khermans	what do you mean id have to run squid locally?
2008-01-03T06:58:00.000Z	khermans	bmk789	i said "if" you are runing squid locally -- but i think it is better to run it for many LAN hosts
2008-01-03T06:59:00.000Z	bmk789	khermans	but if squid is running on my desktop i could use it to relay traffic from the laptop right?
