2007-03-05T11:05:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	what are you trying to install?
2007-03-05T11:10:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	I can't see your replies easily, just use the persons name and a colon instead of <name>, what type of handheld recorder are you useing?
2007-03-05T11:14:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	when you plug it in, does it not popup like a harddisk?
2007-03-08T13:02:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	once you are in #bash type /topic and look up some of the tutorials listed there
2007-03-08T13:03:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	yes, bash is the shell run by default for all users in ubuntu
2007-03-08T13:03:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	so when you open a terminal you are running gnome-terminal that is running bash inside of it
2007-03-08T13:04:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	bash is the shell that ubuntu uses yes, there are many shells and bash is used in many distrobutions, not just ubuntu
2007-03-08T13:05:00.000Z	kelsin	techie_	yes, you should look at the tutorials listed in the /topic of the #bash channel. There are also ploenty of books. The run I recomend is an O'Reilly book about bash
