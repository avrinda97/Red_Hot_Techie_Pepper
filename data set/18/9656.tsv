2007-03-11T12:26:00.000Z	preVail		agreed
2007-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	preVail		you could always hand edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-03-11T12:29:00.000Z	preVail		so why would you tell other people who came here looking for help to do that?
2007-03-11T12:29:00.000Z	preVail		alright
2007-03-11T12:31:00.000Z	preVail		tommy12796, are you updating your system? or do you have another instance of apt-get running?
2007-03-11T12:33:00.000Z	preVail		ohhhh, ok. try that once it has installed and you have booted from the hard drive. That error message that you recieved indicated that another package manager was running
2007-03-11T12:35:00.000Z	preVail		firefox?
2007-03-11T12:36:00.000Z	preVail		by default i think it saves it to /home/username/Desktop. dont quote me on that but its somewhere in your home folder
2007-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	preVail		open firefox, go to edit->preferences and you should see the default directory that files download to
2007-03-11T12:39:00.000Z	willskills	preVail	oh - I'm not sure.

2007-03-11T12:40:00.000Z	preVail		ok, i asked because the sblive 24-bit doesnt support recording. the emu10k1 does though
2007-03-11T12:41:00.000Z	willskills	preVail	right, well, I still can't get it to record.
2007-03-11T12:41:00.000Z	preVail	willskills	have you configured the card correctly? (alsamixer)
2007-03-11T12:41:00.000Z	willskills	preVail	I think so - do you use an IM at all? rather than continue this convo here :)
