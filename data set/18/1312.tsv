2011-03-28T23:30:00.000Z	drc	ava_	You are really trying to ensure no one pays attention to your question, just your loud mouth :)
2011-03-28T23:30:00.000Z	ava_	drc	... i'm new bie here
2011-03-28T23:31:00.000Z	drc	ava_	You're a RUDE newbie is what...settle down and be patient.
2011-03-28T23:32:00.000Z	drc	ava_	Ask your question..wait, if no one answers in 10 or 15 minutes, ask again...politely
2011-03-28T23:33:00.000Z	drc	ava_	RFemember, people come and go her rather frequently, maybe no one knows the answer to your question, maybe some one who comes in later will, that is why you repeat the question at longer intervals
2011-03-28T23:33:00.000Z	ava_	drc	: you know what i itended to
2011-03-28T23:34:00.000Z	drc	ava_	Yes I do...get the answer to <your> question and forget about everyone else here who needs help, that is what you are trying to do...and everyone here knows it. Be patient.
