2010-08-30T21:34:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	nothing for linux that supports mIRC scripting.
2010-08-30T21:35:00.000Z	Kaolc		Idle0ne, exactly. That's why I need a GUI
2010-08-30T21:35:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	x-chat supports perl scripts and has a gui.
2010-08-30T21:35:00.000Z	Kaolc		I don't need perl scripts, I already made a huge mirc script which I need running 24/7.
2010-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	they WILL NOT run on linux.
2010-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	unless you run mIRC in wine.
2010-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	Kaolc		Idle0ne, wine requires a GUI version of Unbuntu though, right? That's where I get stuck again
2010-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	Kaolc		I mean, to fully operate mirc
2010-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	lol. of course. You need X for anything graphical. (other than ncurses interfaces)
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	Kaolc		idleone, yes
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	Kaolc	sipher	problem is that x isn't working out
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	you have a VPS? from that sounds of it...
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	Kaolc		Idle0ne, are you saying it's not possible to run xserver - > server -> wine -> mirc?
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	sipher		the
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	Kaolc	sipher	yes
2010-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	sipher	Kaolc	ask your hosting provider to re-install the VPS with ubuntu desktop.
2010-08-30T21:38:00.000Z	sipher		that or install X
2010-08-30T21:38:00.000Z	Kaolc	sipher	okay. I wonder if they'll do it, but okay. Thanks.
