2007-07-11T11:45:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	I'd join #ubuntu effects and ask again. Specifiy that you're having a problem with a beryl package.  I'm not sure what to do in this instance.
2007-07-11T11:45:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	Pici	 thanks
2007-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	What do you mean by its still there?
2007-09-08T09:18:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	Pici	 it dident get removed!  I click applications and theres still a thing that says WINE
2007-09-08T09:18:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	Did you expect it to remove any applications that you installed using wine?
2007-09-08T09:19:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	Pici	 i was hoping
2007-09-08T09:19:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	You'd have to run the uninstalls from within wine to completely remove them.
2007-09-08T09:20:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	You could also remove ~/.wine/ and also remove the menu using the menu editor if my suggestion is not an option.
2007-09-08T09:22:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	Pici	 whenever i uninstall things with wine, they dont uninstall eather, they just stay there
2007-09-08T09:22:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	Okay, then remove the entires using the menu editor and also delete .wine out of your home folder.
2007-09-08T09:23:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	Pici	 how do i do that ?
2007-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	Pici	LukeEkblad	Places > Home Folder. Then press ctrl-h to show hidden files.  Then you can delete .wine  This WILL remove everything you installed in wine, so make sure you dont need anything.
2007-09-08T09:27:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	Pici	  awesome dude, it is done :)
