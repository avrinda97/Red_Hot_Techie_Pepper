2005-12-22T09:03:00.000Z	sproingie		dpkg-reconfigure -a is death by tedium.  i rather don't recommend it
2005-12-22T09:04:00.000Z	sproingie		whups, wrong channel ;)
2005-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	sproingie		that's what you get for using dapper
2005-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	sproingie		dapper is a development version.  hint, even ubuntu devs don't upgrade it all at once
2005-12-22T09:06:00.000Z	sproingie		i made a similar mistake with breezy when it was new
2005-12-22T09:08:00.000Z	sproingie		i don't know that lilo could handle it. far as i know it *still* has high-cylinder issues
2005-12-22T09:09:00.000Z	intelikey	sproingie	not unless your bios does iirc
2005-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	sproingie	intelikey	ok.. still it's hard to find a bootloader as featureless as lilo
2005-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	intelikey		maybe that's why i like it sproingie
2005-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	sproingie		i like syslinux.  the multiple screens are really useful
2005-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	sproingie		mostly i like grub because it can actually read a filesystem
2005-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	sproingie		freebsd's bootloader's the best.  got forth?
2005-12-22T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie		it does just fine with windows.  the installer is what's broken
2005-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	sproingie		grub's nicer out of the box for sure
2005-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	sproingie		all i care about bootloaders is that they load and let me pop extra parameters in if i want to
2005-12-22T09:15:00.000Z	sproingie		lilo results in unbootable boxen because it can't find kernels in the filesystem
2005-12-22T09:15:00.000Z	sproingie		that imho makes it fail at the job of a bootloader
2005-12-22T09:16:00.000Z	intelikey	sproingie	then lilo should be your fave  cause adding extras is as easy as just typing ' extras <enter>'
