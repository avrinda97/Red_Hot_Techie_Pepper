2008-08-08T14:51:00.000Z	snadge		is anyone else having problems with using amsn from hardy? .. mine no longer connects anymore on two machines
2008-08-08T14:52:00.000Z	snadge		and if i update amsn from svn.. it then works.. so im presuming there should be some kind of update released
2008-08-08T14:52:00.000Z	snadge		as updating from svn is annoying.. i'd rather just click the update button ;)
2008-08-08T14:53:00.000Z	snadge		hmm.. maybe i should check the bugzilla
2008-08-08T14:55:00.000Z	snadge		amsn is actually a better msn client than pidgin.. imho
2008-08-08T14:55:00.000Z	snadge		but obviously pidgin supports other protocols
2008-08-08T14:56:00.000Z	snadge		web camera maybe.. audio chat
2008-08-08T14:56:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	amsn can be a little buggy i find
2008-08-08T14:57:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	i always liked it but recent versions are a little dodgy personally (since they added webcam, audiochat etc)
2008-08-08T14:59:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	what is your problem with amsn?
2008-08-08T14:59:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	isn't amsn from universe?
2008-08-08T15:03:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	what version of amsn are you on? there's a version in -proposed which might fix your problem
2008-08-08T15:05:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	on a much more productive note. have you tried the version in hardy-proposed (0.97+final-0ubuntu5.1)
2008-08-08T15:05:00.000Z	snadge	rconan	no i havnt.. i have only compiled amsn from svn (made a .deb package) and installed that
2008-08-08T15:05:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	oh... well wth are you complaining about then if it works?
2008-08-08T15:06:00.000Z	snadge	rconan	because i had to compile it from svn.. instead of receive an update ;)
2008-08-08T15:14:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	no
2008-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	rconan	snadge	debian has testing and unstable versions instead
