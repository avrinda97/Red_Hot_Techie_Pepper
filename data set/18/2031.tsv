2010-09-06T11:35:00.000Z	sinman		does anyone else knows how i can change these in plymouth?
2010-09-06T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 theres some alterantive plymouth themes in the repos. and other places
2010-09-11T07:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 which OS is handling the bootloader? is it using Grub1 or grub2?
2010-09-11T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 then you are using grub2 then.  I recall the grub2 docs mention customizing the entries.. or you can cut/paste entries from the /boot/grub/grub.cfg to the /etc/grub.d/40_custome file and alter them how you like. BUt those wont get auto-updated if you upgrade kernel versions
2010-09-11T07:15:00.000Z	sinman	Dr_Willis	when ubuntu update the kernal then I'll have to deal with it at that time
2010-09-11T07:18:00.000Z	sinman	Dr_Willis	by any chance would you have a link on how to make the changes in grub 2
2010-09-11T07:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 the grub2 factoid and forum posts are what i follow.. bookmarked at my delicious page -> http://delicious/com/dr_willis/grub2  (i think)
2010-09-11T07:19:00.000Z	sinman	Dr_Willis	ok
2010-09-14T21:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 then you either dident chmod +x it, or did a typo.
2010-09-14T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 totally depends on what the .bin is exactly
2010-09-14T21:20:00.000Z	sinman	Dr_Willis	it's Regnum Online
2010-09-14T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	  check their docs..  you proberly just run the binary then and i would suggest installing it to the users home dir somewhere if it asks where to isntall to. and dont run the installer as root either.
2010-09-14T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 chmod +x whatever.bin , then .whatever.bin
2010-09-14T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 oops.. ./whatever.bin
2010-09-14T21:22:00.000Z	sinman	Dr_Willis	I get this error ./RegnumOnlineInstall_64.bin: No such file or directory
2010-09-14T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 use the tab key to complete the file name. saves on typos
2010-09-14T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sinman	 or you are not in the same directory as the file.
2010-09-14T21:25:00.000Z	sinman	Dr_Willis	k thanxs i done the tab key and it didn't show a filetype, and now it's instgalling
