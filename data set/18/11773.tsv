2006-06-30T07:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Jack_Sparrow	you do - jsut right click, create folder
2006-06-30T07:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	thoreauputic	That much I know, It will not give permission
2006-06-30T07:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Jack_Sparrow	what does  ls -ld /home say ?
2006-06-30T07:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Jack_Sparrow	and ls -ld /home/jack  ?
