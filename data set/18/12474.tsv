2006-04-18T08:50:00.000Z	blindx	orbin	i've got a foot here and there.
2006-04-18T08:52:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	yeah, flickering is probably the refresh rate
2006-04-18T08:52:00.000Z	blindx	orbin	does it mean it's too high, or too low?
2006-04-18T08:53:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-04-18T08:55:00.000Z	blindx	orbin	http://pastebin.com/656950
2006-04-18T08:56:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	run that
2006-04-18T08:56:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	did what?
2006-04-18T08:56:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	and those are the values you got?
2006-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	means you can't autodetect them
2006-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	at the monitor config, choose the middle option
2006-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	iirc, it prompts you to choose the highest res and rate available
2006-04-18T09:00:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	sudo in front
2006-04-18T09:02:00.000Z	blindx	orbin	pick the middle option where?
2006-04-18T09:11:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	pastebin the new conf file
2006-04-18T09:11:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	i meant the middle option in the monitor config step
2006-04-21T06:53:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	not default technically..that one only has the cdrom enabled iirc
2006-04-21T06:54:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	but those are the official sources.lists
2006-04-30T10:16:00.000Z	orbin	blindx	depends on how you installed it
