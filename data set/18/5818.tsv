2009-09-24T03:22:00.000Z	alokito	demon_	so your sound card is built in in the mainboard?
2009-09-24T03:23:00.000Z	alokito	demon_	do you have any other os and if u have can u hear sound there?
2009-09-24T03:24:00.000Z	alokito	demon_	well vbox uses the host os's sound driver so it doesn't count
2009-09-24T03:24:00.000Z	alokito	demon_	boot from a live cd and see if you can hear sound, if you can't check your bios settings
2009-09-24T03:25:00.000Z	alokito	demon_	in kubuntu right click the sound icon and click Show Mixer Window
