2009-06-30T03:30:00.000Z	alec		I have a question that probably has a simple answer.  Problem: Once I opened firefox thru terminal as SUDO and now if I try to simply open it via the icon, firefox opens as a dummied down version.  I don't even have ability to click on back & forward buttons.

2009-06-30T03:32:00.000Z	boss_mc	alec	make sure the files in ~/.mozilla are owned by you, not root
2009-06-30T03:32:00.000Z	alec	boss_mc	Thanks, checking.
2009-06-30T03:35:00.000Z	alec	boss_mc	Yes, all files/folders in ~/.moziilla are owned by me.
2009-06-30T03:36:00.000Z	boss_mc	alec	hmmmm, and in the sub folders etc I assume...
2009-06-30T03:37:00.000Z	boss_mc	alec	there's your problem, google for gksudo vs sudo for why this happened (if you're interested)
2009-06-30T03:37:00.000Z	alec	boss_mc	as for a fix?  chown?
2009-06-30T03:37:00.000Z	boss_mc	alec	yeah
2009-06-30T03:38:00.000Z	alec	boss_mc	I understand(gksudo) .   trying chown as myusername now.

2009-06-30T03:40:00.000Z	boss_mc	alec	username:username (your name)
2009-06-30T03:40:00.000Z	alec	boss_mc	not permitted.
2009-06-30T03:40:00.000Z	alec	boss_mc	boss_mc
2009-06-30T03:40:00.000Z	boss_mc	alec	you'll have to sudo the command
