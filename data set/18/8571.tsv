2007-07-31T06:21:00.000Z	unagi		oops
2007-07-31T06:21:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	therethinker jmchaffie the problem is, I had no problem installing and setting up Ubuntu 7.04 to dual boot with WinXP Pro SP2, but when I try to do Ubuntu 7.04 with Vista Home Premium, the sound doesnt work, I can't enable the effects, I have no wireless connectivity (with none of the WIFI Managers on the net)
2007-07-31T06:22:00.000Z	unagi	bolingo	i hate to burst your bubble but what you dual boot with has nothing to do with all of those
2007-07-31T06:25:00.000Z	unagi	bolingo	im telling you that it has nothing to do with dual booting
2007-07-31T06:25:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	but the problem is, that, I have another laptop, which has WinXP pre installed, and I've installed ubuntu 7.04 and is dual booting and doing everything fine
2007-07-31T06:26:00.000Z	unagi	bolingo	is that laptop the EXACT configuration as the problem laptop
2007-07-31T06:26:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	the funny thing is, that, the laptop that is giving me problems is a packard bell that came pre-installed with vista
2007-07-31T06:27:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	the problematic one came pre-installed with vista home premium, and the good one, is a toshiba, came with WinXP Pro pre-installed
2007-07-31T06:28:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	nah...the problem is not the computer I guess, because the computer with Vista works incredibly fine, and trust me, I dont like vista, but I gotta admit it :o
2007-07-31T06:28:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	the problem is vista
2007-07-31T06:30:00.000Z	unagi	bolingo	you just dont seem to be listening
2007-07-31T06:35:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	lol...I think i was very clear when I said that I can make ubuntu 7.04 dual boot with WinXp Pro and not with Vista Home Premium and I'm just asking if anyone has sucessfuly made it. if u want to stop talking, fine, feel free, but thanks for the effort anywayz
2007-07-31T06:39:00.000Z	bolingo	unagi	try to understand, that, I didnt say that I'm a complete noob, to the point not to be able to make a sucessfull dual boot with Windows and Ubuntu, I've made that, like 50 times already, what I'm saying is that I made de dual boot for Vista Home Premium/Ubuntu, with the same configurations as WinXP/Ubuntu, and ubuntu didnt work fine.do u still dont understand?
