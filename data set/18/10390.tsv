2006-12-09T14:33:00.000Z	_tcc		Why is vi retarded in Edgy?
2006-12-09T14:33:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Use vim.
2006-12-09T14:33:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Even if it is, it's often configured to react differently depending on how it's called.
2006-12-09T14:45:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Configure your network interfaces to NOT use DHCP?
2006-12-09T14:46:00.000Z	_tcc	bigbro	uh yeah...?
2006-12-09T14:46:00.000Z	_tcc	bigbro	and the file is where?
2006-12-09T14:46:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Depends on the interface. There are graphical tools to do it. Is there a reason you want to modify the scripts directly?
2006-12-09T14:46:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	If so, check out /etc/network/
2006-12-09T14:47:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Generally networking would be set up outside the chroot environment - I'm assuming you're on a Debian / Ubuntu system.
2006-12-09T14:47:00.000Z	_tcc	bigbro	i am now
2006-12-09T14:48:00.000Z	_tcc	bigbro	i don't want it just randomly requesting addresses without the users constent
2006-12-09T14:48:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Networking would be a root level thing - users should not be involved. I don't see the issue.
2006-12-09T14:48:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Either it has DHCP enabled interfaces - which must request an IP if one is required - or it does not.
2006-12-09T14:49:00.000Z	_tcc	bigbro	the issue is you are putting data onto the networking without them knowing
2006-12-09T14:49:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	I'm really not sure what you want to achieve.
2006-12-09T14:49:00.000Z	_tcc	bigbro	NOT REQUESTING AN ADDRESS
2006-12-09T14:50:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	Then don't configure your interfaces to request DHCP addresses. Job done.
2006-12-09T14:51:00.000Z	bigbro	_tcc	All the Debian / Ubuntu networking configuration is available under /etc/network/
