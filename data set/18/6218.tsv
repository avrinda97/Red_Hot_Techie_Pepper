2008-10-11T22:56:00.000Z	joanki123	ActionParsnip	THANKS!  very useful.
2008-10-11T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	all i did was search with www.ask.com
2008-10-11T22:57:00.000Z	joanki123	ActionParsnip	i found a lot of sites, but i still was unsure
2008-10-11T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	i have no idea either
2008-10-11T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	what made you choose ubuntu?
2008-10-11T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	but maybe mandriva is better or fedora?
2008-10-11T22:58:00.000Z	joanki123	ActionParsnip	a lot of people i use use Ubuntu
2008-10-11T22:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	so by that reckoning, see which one is most used between sever and workstation and use that one
2008-10-11T23:00:00.000Z	joanki123	ActionParsnip	you have to start somewhere.  i was using virtualbox but it wasn't working so well for me
2009-04-18T02:04:00.000Z	joanki123	ActionParsnip	all of the "versions" are old.... why?
2009-04-18T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	what i do is pretend i have a card that not working and see if there is a guide to get it working
2009-04-18T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	if lotsa people say "hey, this works out of the box in <whatever>" its usually a good choice
2009-04-18T02:06:00.000Z	joanki123	ActionParsnip	if the ad for the product says that it works with linux, is it a safe bet it works on 8.04?
2009-04-18T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	sure
2009-04-18T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joanki123	also check the tv cards advertised at www.efficientpc.co.uk
