2011-05-23T22:04:00.000Z	CharlieSu		Would someone please test this PPA for me?  I'm trying it, but it doestn' seem to find the package when I use apt-cache search or try to install it..   https://gist.github.com/b77a914daebc6d01bb16   (https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam)
2011-05-23T22:06:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	if you are trying to install on lucid, both lucid versions in that ppa failed to build, so there is nothing to install
2011-05-23T22:06:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	I am trying to use Lucid..  If i build it manually it seems to work
2011-05-23T22:07:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	how did you deduce that?  How would I find that myself?
2011-05-23T22:08:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	click View Package Details, under Build Status
2011-05-23T22:08:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	aha!  thanks..
2011-08-26T23:04:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	you can't find them because they failed to build in that ppa
2011-08-26T23:04:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	what do you mean?
2011-08-26T23:04:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	ahh.. i see now
2012-07-10T23:15:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	please run: apt-get update; first, apache2.2-bin is up to version 2.2.14-5ubuntu8.9 in lucid (it is requesting 2.2.14-5ubuntu8.6)
2012-07-10T23:18:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	dohhh..  newbie move on my part
2012-07-10T23:19:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	happens
2012-07-10T23:21:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	everything i have is automated w/ Chef and I forgot to pull in my apt cookbook
2012-08-31T21:33:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	only a guess, maybe you don't have a shell for the in-target commands, maybe try cp instead?
2012-08-31T21:35:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	good idea..  so you think it is the pipe?
2012-08-31T21:39:00.000Z	trism	CharlieSu	yeah I think so, I notice the same issue here too: http://askubuntu.com/questions/104135/preseed-late-command-not-running though answerer seems to be able to do the redirect from ubiquity/success_command
2012-08-31T21:41:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	cool.. i'll try a 'cp' instead
2012-08-31T22:38:00.000Z	CharlieSu	trism	'cp' worked great in that preseed.. thanks bud!
