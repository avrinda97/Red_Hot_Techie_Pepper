2009-07-03T03:27:00.000Z	doink1212		can anybody help me with PCSX? its a playstation emulator
2009-07-03T03:29:00.000Z	doink1212		i can start up the games but there is no keyboard input... will it only work with a controller?
2009-07-03T03:30:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	unless you actually mean pcsx2, I agree with ZykoticK9.
2009-07-03T03:33:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	I dont think the wine way is worth pursuiting for this purpose.
2009-07-03T03:41:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	I know pcsx2 a little. The SSE messages probably are just for your information.
2009-07-03T03:43:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	On the other hand, well, missing libraries like the libCg.so must matter. But I didn't have this issue in particular, possibly since I built pcsx2 from source (and even some plugins).
2009-07-03T03:44:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	possibly. although, have you used a package for pcsx2 or just downloaded and extracted it?
2009-07-03T03:45:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	the latter would at least require you to manually ensure dependencies are met. I recall they listed what pcsx2 needed on the homepage or maybe their forums.
2009-07-03T03:46:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	and the linux version doesn't appear to be in a .zip, but a .tar.gz
2009-07-03T03:48:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	all right. well, all I know has been said, I guess. good luck.
2009-07-03T03:51:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	from a quick look, that seems better than the instructions I used, although I guess it links to the same instructions for the (possibly) tricky compilation as well.
2009-07-03T03:53:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	found the instructions I used: http://code.google.com/p/pcsx2/wiki/CompilationGuideForLinux
2009-07-03T03:56:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	Hm. Well, I don't have anything better to offer. It was easy enough for me.
2009-07-03T03:58:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	ubuntu is sorta debian-based, many to most things are exactly the same.
2009-07-03T04:00:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	Good luck...
2009-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	Well, if it doesn't seem related to some missing dependency that is not installed, you're quite deep in "experienced user" land now. Need to try different revisions from svn, check snapshots, try different versions of gcc, perhaps grab a debugger and fix source code... that type of stuff.
2009-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	doink1212	Radtoo	i have some errors if you don't mind taking a moment ot look at them?
2009-07-03T04:11:00.000Z	Radtoo	doink1212	okay. chances are low that I can figure out the problem without opportunity and time to tinker, but I can have a look.
