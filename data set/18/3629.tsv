2010-01-20T20:26:00.000Z	cweilem		any thoughts on how to "unmirror" a webcam picture in 9.04?
2010-01-20T20:28:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	i assume you mean in realtime?
2010-01-20T20:28:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 yup
2010-01-20T20:28:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	and hence the suggestion of using gimp is hardly satisfactory
2010-01-20T20:29:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 well, that would work, because what I have setup is motion detector
2010-01-20T20:30:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	expect it wont, since to use gimp to do this you would 1) need to edit each frame manually (time consuming, not practical) 2) setup a pipe from the /dev/somethingsomethingsomething/  folder to have gimp process it in the backgroun (complicated, also might fubar other things )
2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	have you tried using the program called  "cheese" ?
2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 right.  i mean, it's not a huge issue - the bottom line is the camera works and I can catch people stealing stuff off my desk, but it'd be nice if it wasn't mirrored
2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 will cheese work for motion sensing?
2010-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	not sure but there is other projects that do what you want in terms of start recording when enough pixels change in the frame
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 even cheese shows the reverse image, and motion is what I'm using now :)

2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	ok (mention these things it helps )
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 ha, sorry
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	maybe motion has cofig to modify frames as it dumps them ?
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 summary so far - using motion, cheese, ekiga, the camera works, but image is mirrored.  skype works perfectly
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	cweilem	airtonix	 maybe...  i'm wondering now if skype isn't flipping the image for me
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	airtonix	cweilem	it might be (if it is then my assumption is that since its newer than cheese or motion it is sniffing machine ids of your webcam and it knows that it needs to flip the frames)
