2007-02-12T15:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight_		can someone tell me what .m4a format is and what plugin i need to convert it to audio that gnomebaker can burn to cd
2007-02-12T15:55:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	its a DRM ridden aac file from the Itunes music store.
2007-02-12T15:56:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	there is no way to play it in anything other than itunes.
2007-02-12T15:56:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	use itunes to burn them all to a cd, then import the cd, and you'll have usable files.
2007-02-12T15:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	damn, a piece of crap
2007-02-12T15:57:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	don't buy drm music in the future if you plan on using linux, it doesn't work out.
2007-02-12T15:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	i just downloaded it using nicotine off somebody else
2007-02-12T15:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	so, i can play it on my computer but i just can't burn it to cd? weird...
2007-02-12T15:58:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	opposite.
2007-02-12T15:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	but that is how it is here
2007-02-12T16:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	i downloaded the album and can play it but can't burn it
2007-02-12T16:02:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	unless you plan on using itunes, there is no easy way of playing it. you have to use ITUNES <--- to burn them to a cd.
2007-02-12T16:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	i don't know if you are hearing me properly. I am playing the album on ubuntu without a problem, just burning is an issue
2007-02-12T16:08:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	you sure? i think m4a stands for mpeg 4 audio and is not itunes
2007-02-12T16:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	that is why i have no problem playing it. I think the problem is with gnomebaker not being abloeltop burn it
2007-02-12T16:12:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	dude, you've gone very quite on me....
2007-02-12T16:12:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	tom__	i think you were wrong about prempting it to be an itunes drm file
2007-02-12T16:13:00.000Z	tom__	livingdaylight_	there is no support for that format. it may be an unprotected aac file, so install aac support.
