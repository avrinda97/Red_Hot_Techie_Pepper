2006-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	nny_		 does nayone know alot about software raid or know someone who does that wants to make some extra cash?
2006-06-19T13:36:00.000Z	nny_		Warbo.. maybe something from xfce?
2006-06-19T13:37:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	Basically all I want is the menu, not something embedded into a background (because I have ChBg going) so will XFCE's desktop cover my root window (I'm guessing yes)
2006-06-19T13:38:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	yeah
2006-08-04T06:08:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	Dapper is the main Ubuntu release at the moment. There is a seperate Edgy channel
2006-08-04T06:09:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	so who do i talk to about this issue?
2006-08-04T06:09:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	getting tired of hearing myself complain
2006-08-04T06:18:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	ubuntu developers' mailing list?
2006-08-04T06:20:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	I found that nvidia-glx tries to install linux-image-2.6.15-23-386 if you don't have linux-restricted-modules installed, but after that I was fine
2006-08-04T06:21:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	Have you tried module-assistant?
2006-08-04T06:22:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	not only have i not, i have never heard of it and it sounds X based
2006-08-04T06:22:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	It sounds very X based. Until you run it and it gives you an ncurses menu
2006-08-04T06:22:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	and this would help how?
2006-08-04T06:23:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	It builds the nvidia driver for your kernel, then installs it
2006-08-04T06:23:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	ok great!!1 gah... but when i install my kernel it wants to install nvidia-kernel-common, which is a no no cause i don't want the linux based agpart module or anything
2006-08-04T06:27:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	If you wanted a simple thing like nvidia drivers then it would be fine, but what you want is really specific, so no wonder nobody can help you
2006-08-04T06:27:00.000Z	nny_	Warbo	um that logic is bewildering
2006-08-04T06:28:00.000Z	Warbo	nny_	If you don't want to use the regular ways because they install stuff you don't want, then that is very specific. Everyone else makes do
