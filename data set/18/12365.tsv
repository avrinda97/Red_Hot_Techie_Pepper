2006-07-16T08:54:00.000Z	eka	erUSUL	it 's strange... cause when i follow the instructions to find it... i found that killing azureus bittorrent program closed that connection...
2006-07-16T08:54:00.000Z	eka	erUSUL	i did lsof | grep 65000 and found java--- so i killed azureus
2006-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	eka	well where did you dl the java binaries or azureus?
2006-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	eka	erUSUL	from azureus home page
2006-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	eka	erUSUL	the java binaries from sun
2006-07-16T08:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	eka	i recomend using the sun java version of the repos... you can ask in azureus mailing list or in java ones to see if someone has the same problem
2006-07-16T08:58:00.000Z	eka	erUSUL	sorry is from repository
