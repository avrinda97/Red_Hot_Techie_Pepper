2009-06-02T06:37:00.000Z	SeanJM		hello
2009-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	SeanJM		I was wondering if anyone could give me a hand here?
2009-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	SeanJM		I have a minor problem... I hope
2009-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	SeanJM		I backed up my hard drive on hardy
2009-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	SeanJM		then installed jaunty
2009-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	SeanJM		now my hard drive won't read
2009-06-02T06:39:00.000Z	SeanJM		it's a scary problem I have here
2009-06-02T06:40:00.000Z	SeanJM		:-)
2009-06-02T06:41:00.000Z	SeanJM		I backed up my home folder onto my maxtor external, which I usually do. Then I installed 9.04, now my hard drive won't ready. I tried loading it onto my wifes windows machine and it gave me an I/O. I am assuming here that hardware failure is not the issue
2009-06-02T06:41:00.000Z	SeanJM		ready=read*
2009-06-02T06:43:00.000Z	graelin	SeanJM	Is the fs on the drive linux (extX, reiserfs etc) Windows doesn't play nice with them
2009-06-02T06:43:00.000Z	SeanJM	graelin	it's formated NTFS
2009-06-02T06:44:00.000Z	graelin		hmm.. ntfs in Linux is a crapshoot.. reliable overall, but writing to that fs can be problematic sometimes
2009-06-02T06:44:00.000Z	SeanJM	graelin	I've never had an issue before. I reinstalled 8.10 about a month ago with the same procedures with no issues
2009-06-02T06:44:00.000Z	graelin		unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough there to be any help
2009-06-02T06:45:00.000Z	SeanJM	graelin	no worries
2009-06-02T06:45:00.000Z	SeanJM		windows wouldn't read the hard drive either--so I am a little worried, as it was my only backup and has about 4 years of work on it
2009-06-02T06:45:00.000Z	graelin	SeanJM	Agreed... I've never had an issue with it before either, but it's an established warning in all the ntfs linux docs/webpages
