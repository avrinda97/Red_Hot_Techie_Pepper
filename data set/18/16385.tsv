2004-09-29T06:29:00.000Z	minghua		hi, I have a question about LVM support on powerpc
2004-09-29T06:30:00.000Z	minghua		I tried d-i RC1 on i386 machine with root on LVM
2004-09-29T06:30:00.000Z	minghua		and it worked fine
2004-09-29T06:30:00.000Z	minghua		yesterday I tried ubuntu 4.10 preview
2004-09-29T06:30:00.000Z	minghua		and I couldn't have LVM work
2004-09-29T06:31:00.000Z	minghua		not sure about ubuntu
2004-09-29T06:33:00.000Z	Kamion	minghua	sorry, there's an issue with parted on powerpc which means that LVM isn't currently supported on powerpc
2004-09-29T06:34:00.000Z	minghua	Kamion	aha, that explains things well
2004-09-29T06:34:00.000Z	Kamion	minghua	I spent some time debugging it at debconf4, it's not trivial to fix :-/
2004-09-29T06:34:00.000Z	minghua	Kamion	so even d-i powerpc doesn't support LVM?
2004-09-29T06:34:00.000Z	Kamion	minghua	nope
2004-09-29T06:35:00.000Z	minghua	Kamion	I see, thanks for the info.
2004-09-29T06:35:00.000Z	minghua	Kamion	is there any bug number that I can watch on this issue?
2004-09-29T06:36:00.000Z	Kamion	minghua	don't know of one
2004-09-29T06:37:00.000Z	minghua	Kamion	need me to file one? :-)
2004-09-29T06:38:00.000Z	Kamion	minghua	only if you really want to, it's unlikely to make things happen any faster :)
2004-09-29T06:39:00.000Z	minghua	Kamion	I won't bother then.  thanks.
2004-09-29T06:41:00.000Z	Kamion	minghua	(mind you, it would mean you'd be told when it was closed if you filed a bug ...)
