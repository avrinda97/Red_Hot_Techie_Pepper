2011-05-25T02:10:00.000Z	JoeR1		ok now on to ubuntu
2011-05-25T02:11:00.000Z	JoeR1		I installed "lips of suna" but I can't find it anywhere - Why I hat install scripts instead of compiling
2011-05-25T02:11:00.000Z	JoeR1		hate*
2011-05-25T02:13:00.000Z	JoeR1		crap, I feel stupid - I think I just figured out my problem
2011-05-25T02:13:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	maybe this will help
2011-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	JoeR1	Caboose885	- I was being stupid, it says in the README that the game has to be launched in a terminal so of course I didn't find any shorcuts
2011-05-25T02:15:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	that was the next thing I was about to ask ;)
2011-05-25T02:27:00.000Z	JoeR1	Caboose885	thats a good question - Firefox and Opera both run like pure distilled a$$ on my system, do have any recommendations for a resource friendly browser?
2011-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	Chromium is a good browser at least in my experience with it
2011-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	no chromium is not google. It is the parent to Chrome
2011-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	http://www.chromium.org/
2011-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	chrome is google. Chromium is not
2011-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	nah, google is just riding on the coat tails of opensource ;)
2011-05-25T02:44:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	its 6 months
2011-05-25T02:48:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	sarcasm doesn't convey well over text ;)
2011-05-25T02:53:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	You could even get lighter than that with Fluxbox ;)
2011-05-25T02:54:00.000Z	JoeR1	Caboose885	Oh i know I use to use a Box program (I forget the name) and I was sitting at 98 meg on startup
2011-05-25T02:54:00.000Z	Caboose885	JoeR1	there is openbox, fluxbox, blackbox...and probably more...
