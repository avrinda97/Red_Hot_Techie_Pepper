2009-01-11T21:52:00.000Z	papul		can i directly install ubuntu without bootind into the os? it takes a lot of time to boot.
2009-01-11T21:52:00.000Z	jrib	papul	use the alternate cd
2009-07-01T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	papul	system -> administration -> software sources
2009-07-01T17:18:00.000Z	papul	jrib	then?
2009-07-01T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	papul	then remove your custom ones
2009-07-01T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	papul	did I not tell you the procedure before?
2009-12-14T21:01:00.000Z	jrib	papul	xmonad is great, just try it
2010-05-18T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	papul	no
2010-05-18T14:25:00.000Z	papul	jrib	but i will be installing it in my home dir? so i have write access
2010-05-18T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	papul	what is "it" in your sentence?
2010-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	papul	jrib	packages
2010-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	jrib	papul	apt isn't meant for installing to /home and the location it installs to isn't easily changed
2010-05-18T14:27:00.000Z	papul	jrib	ok seems like compiling with prefix is my only option then
2010-05-18T14:27:00.000Z	jrib	papul	why can't you use apt the normal way? And what are you installing?
2010-05-18T14:28:00.000Z	papul	jrib	i have a remote shell and want to install a package in my home dir
2010-05-18T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	papul	yeah, just build it then
2010-05-18T14:29:00.000Z	papul	jrib	ok thanks for the help :)
2010-09-11T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	papul	please not here, this channel is for ubuntu support
