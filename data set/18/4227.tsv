2009-08-14T15:32:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	I'm talking about on the live CD where the hard drives have no entries in fstab. I'm guessing it'd be the same process that handles USB drives
2009-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: still there ?
2009-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	yep
2009-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: create a other squashfs an burn another iso file
2009-08-14T15:42:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: command mksquashfs
2009-08-14T15:42:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	I want to disable access to internal hard drives in the computer and still allow thumb drives to be available
2009-08-14T15:42:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	I'm guessing this is best done through udev at this stage
2009-08-14T15:44:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: even for changing udev rules, you will have to change the squashfs by including the your rules file
2009-08-14T15:44:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	yes, I'm making a live CD
2009-08-14T15:45:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: I thought you were simply using one
2009-08-14T15:45:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	heh, sorry didn't point that out. I'm making a liveCD that will have limited access to media
2009-08-14T15:46:00.000Z	jhesketh_		(well attempting to anyway)
2009-08-14T15:46:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: I would just modify the fstab file and disable root account and sudo command
2009-08-14T15:47:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	I tried that already in practice... seems pmount or gnome-volume-manager or something still has enough permissions to mount it
2009-08-14T15:50:00.000Z	jerroome	jhesketh_	: I don't have more hints, good luck !!
2009-08-14T15:50:00.000Z	jhesketh_	jerroome	no worries. thanks for your help!
