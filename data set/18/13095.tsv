2006-04-24T09:22:00.000Z	btaylor5619		Is there any way to clear the high scores of the games I play?
2006-04-24T09:23:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	fine the file that stores them and delete them?
2006-04-24T09:23:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	ls -a will list hidden files, or ctrl-h in nautilus
2006-04-28T05:39:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	no need to compile, it's in the repos
2006-04-28T05:41:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	is there a reason you don't want to use the xmame in the repositories?
2006-04-28T05:42:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	have you used synaptic before?
2006-04-28T05:42:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	yes
2006-04-28T05:43:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	it seems to be in multiverse, have you enabled it?
2006-05-03T14:52:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	depends on the question
2006-05-03T14:55:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	liferea is a nice one
2006-05-06T16:12:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	state the problem
2006-05-06T16:19:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	have you restarted X?
2006-05-06T16:20:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	no, just X should be sufficient
2006-05-06T16:20:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	save what you are working on, then press ctrl-alt-backspace
2006-05-06T16:23:00.000Z	btaylor5619	_jason	restarting X had no effect; Totem is still giving me the same thing
2006-05-06T16:24:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	did it ever work?
2006-05-06T16:26:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	system > preferences > multimedia selector, what does it say for the video stuff?
2006-05-06T16:29:00.000Z	_jason	btaylor5619	I'll be back in a few minutes
