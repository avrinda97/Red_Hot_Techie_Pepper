2005-10-02T10:29:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	thanks
2005-10-02T10:18:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	thanks was thinking of that... it's just I am already in synapic and thought I ask... I just have a bunch of options
2005-10-02T10:19:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	I'll do that, thanks
2005-10-02T10:22:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	all I found about GPG on the WIKI resembling what I need is how to create a key... I knew that :( What I need to know is that when in Synaptic, searching for GPG and getting a few hits back... what *exactly* do I install?
2005-10-02T10:27:00.000Z	nerp	vbgunz	i'm sorry what did you need to do again
2005-10-02T10:27:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	the wiki talks only about those commands
2005-10-02T10:28:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	I am using synaptic and only need to know which packages do I have to install to use GPG
2005-10-02T10:28:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	do I just install GPG?
2005-10-02T10:29:00.000Z	nerp	vbgunz	no prob
2005-10-02T10:31:00.000Z	vbgunz	nerp	I just remembered why I cam here to ask about GPG... When I looked for GPG in synaptic everything but *GPG* came back... Should I just apt-get install GPG?
2005-10-02T10:33:00.000Z	nerp	vbgunz	i can't recall ecact package name, synaptic search in "descriptions and names " gpg hould have a result
