2007-01-20T17:51:00.000Z	phixnay		hi I'm trying to build wine from source, but I get an error during configure saying C compiler cannot create executables. Do I have to be root or something?
2007-01-20T17:51:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	did you install build-essential?
2007-01-20T17:55:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	apparently you can't build wine from source at all
2007-01-20T17:56:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	apparently needs to be built with gcc-3.4, and you're probably going to have a tough time getting that working
2007-01-20T17:57:00.000Z	phixnay	graft	ah, that would be a problem... oh well i don't really need wine
2007-01-20T17:57:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	err wait someone else claims you just have to install libc6-dev-i386
2007-01-20T17:57:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	what's wrong with wine in the repository?
2007-01-20T17:59:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	uh? sounds like you have bigger problems :P
2007-01-20T17:59:00.000Z	phixnay	graft	could not download all repository indexes
2007-01-20T17:59:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	better fix that... which mirror are you using?
2007-01-20T17:59:00.000Z	phixnay	graft	it might only be for i386
2007-01-20T17:59:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	oh, custom wine repository?
2007-01-20T06:00:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	i386 should work for lotsa stuff... but there's a wine built in the normal ubuntu mirror...
2007-01-20T06:00:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	granted it's from 2004 (!), but...
2007-01-20T06:01:00.000Z	phixnay	graft	I did a search for it and didn't see it in synaptic
2007-01-20T06:21:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	uname -a
2007-01-20T06:25:00.000Z	graft	phixnay	yeah wine needs to be built 32-bit
2007-01-20T07:06:00.000Z	phixnay	graft	nekr0z, I found a guide here http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/2007/01/12/installing-wine-on-ubuntu-edgy-610-64-bit/ but it involves overwriting symbolic links, and I want to know if I can do it in a way where I can undo it if it doesn't work
