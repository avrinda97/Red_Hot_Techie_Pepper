2012-01-25T21:53:00.000Z	nc_		Hi!
2012-01-25T21:55:00.000Z	nc_		I was just wondering, if I were to ssh to a machine in my network from a machine outside my network (i have a static ip adress) would i then "ssh user@my.static.ip.adress"? I mean if I check my ip adress online all the computers have the same one :o (Sorry for being a noob)
2012-01-25T21:55:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	You need to set port forwarding on your router.
2012-01-25T21:55:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	Or even DMZ, if you prefer.
2012-01-25T21:57:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	ActionParsnip: So if I open e.g. port 22 the computers will get their own adress and i will ssh into that?
2012-01-25T21:57:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	You need to forward port 22 to, say, 192.168.1.111:22, that way when you ssh into your public IP address you'll infact ssh into the computer the port is forwarded to.
2012-01-25T21:58:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	Awesome thanks :)!
2012-01-25T21:59:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	If you configure DMZ to 192.168.1.111 then all requests to your public IP will be forwarded to the computer on 192.168.1.111, if that's the right way for you
2012-01-25T22:00:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	Let me get it straight, if i open port 22 and i ssh user1@240.25.21.684:22 i can do another to ssh user2@240.25.21.684:22?
2012-01-25T22:00:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	Sure, as long as the sshd setup allows that.
2012-01-25T22:00:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	the sshd setup? :o
2012-01-25T22:01:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	Well, uh, yeah... You need to configure an ssh server (for instance, sshd or whatever) to access your computer via SSH
2012-01-25T22:02:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	ahh, okay i've got openssh configured :)
2012-01-25T22:03:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	I mean vino, sorry
2012-01-25T22:04:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	Oh, that. You'd need to forward whatever the VNC porn is then
2012-01-25T22:04:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	okay, thanks a lot. Gotta go, have a great day! :)
2012-01-25T22:04:00.000Z	theadmin	nc_	Thanks. Hope you fix your problem.
2012-01-25T22:05:00.000Z	nc_	theadmin	if not I'll be back tomorrow :p
