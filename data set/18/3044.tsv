2009-12-24T23:24:00.000Z	pundyou		Hey on my game it freezes sometimes. How can I quit it without restarting?
2009-12-24T23:25:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	you mean ubuntu freezes? Ctrl + Alt + F2 and kill the process that caused the freeze. then restart GDM. should be enough I guess.
2009-12-24T23:25:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	when I press that it does nothing. I can't get into the terminal. I know in windows you can just click ctrl alt delete.
2009-12-24T23:26:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	you need to login in the terminal when you press Ctrl + Alt + F2 and only then can you kill or whatever.
2009-12-24T23:27:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	It doesn't work when it freezes. It's a fullscreen game
2009-12-24T23:28:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	Ctrl + Alt + F2 is like a boon for killing a process when it stops responding; I've done it for Warzone which is played full screen.
2009-12-24T23:29:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	but it doesn't work. That's the thing
2009-12-24T23:29:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	I'm running age of mythology the titans in wine.
2009-12-24T23:30:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	I'm sorry; I don't have much clue what could be wrong; usually Ctrl + Alt + F2 works no matter what. it's like a keyboard interrupt I think.
2009-12-24T23:33:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	it's a button on the top right corner of the keyboard.
2009-12-24T23:34:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	ok.
2009-12-24T23:46:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	well it doesn't work. It works now, but not when it is frozen.
2009-12-24T23:47:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	I'm really stumped as to why it's not working for you. In fact most stuff that work for me don't seem to work for most people in this support channel:).
2009-12-24T23:47:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	:P
2009-12-24T23:47:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	well I'll try ctrl alt d when it happens
2009-12-24T23:48:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	do tell me if Ctrl + Alt + D works ok
2009-12-24T23:48:00.000Z	pundyou	dnivra	ok
2009-12-24T23:48:00.000Z	dnivra	pundyou	thanks
