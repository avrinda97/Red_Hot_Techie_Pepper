2009-05-11T03:32:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	ok so you want to refresh the package lists?
2009-05-11T03:29:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	wait you mean oher than the package cache?
2009-05-11T03:31:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	apt-get clean clears the package cache, the directory in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2009-05-11T03:31:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	thre's also apt-get autoclean which clears everythign except newest versions of stuff
2009-05-11T03:31:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	what's it leabing?
2009-05-11T03:32:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	that's just apt-get update
2009-05-11T03:35:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	not how it works, and he already parted
2009-05-11T03:36:00.000Z	maco	Soul_Shadow	since youre saying that you arent seeing certain packages available to install, it sounds like you dont want to clear the package cache, but rather refresh the apt cache, and that is "apt-get update"
