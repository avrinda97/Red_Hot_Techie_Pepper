2007-06-10T06:19:00.000Z	cp84		anyone ahve any ideas?
2007-06-10T06:19:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	 as mp3 or as music files playable in a regular player ?
2007-06-10T06:20:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	use gnomebaker
2007-06-10T06:20:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	 sudo apt-get install gnomebaker
2007-06-10T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	install  gnomebaker, open gnomebaker  , select the mp3 files you want to put on the cd , add the files to the cd burning list,   put cd in the cd burner,   burn cd
2007-06-10T06:30:00.000Z	cp84	Pelo	  will it burn it as a audio cd or a mp3 cd
2007-06-10T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	 that will burn as mp3 data cd , do you need to burn as audio cd ?
2007-06-10T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	doyou need to make an audio cd ?  if you want an audio cd  use  menu > application > sound/video > serpentine
2007-06-10T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	 then you can burn as mp3 using nautilus or gnomebaker
2007-06-10T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	 it is very hard to tell you what do do with so little info,  what format will your cd player accept
2007-06-10T06:35:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	then burn your mp3 files to the cd using gnomebaker or nautilus and it should be fine
2007-06-10T06:35:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	use gnomebaker it,s simpler
2007-06-10T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	then use serpentine to make an audio cd
2007-06-10T06:42:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	it will make an audio cd ,  not an mp3 cd
2007-06-10T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	cp84	honestly just try the damn thing , if one doesn't work try the other,  it will take less time then asking over and over again , we do not know, we donT' know what cd player you use and we wouldn'T know if/what even if we did ,   cds are 10 a pcs  just get on with it and try
