2009-02-07T19:09:00.000Z	Tomas___		One last try: Does anyone know a solution to my sound problem? I replaced my internal soundcard with a audigy 2 zs and everything seemed to work perfectly fine until 2 days later. I was playing mp3 as usual and then suddenly sound starts looping and player freezes up. This is not related to the player since it happens randomly after around 2 days no matter what player i am using.

2009-02-07T19:09:00.000Z	Tomas___		not found anything at all using google either
2009-02-07T19:10:00.000Z	Tomas___		one of the main reasons i use linux is because of stability, so rebooting every 2 days is insanely annoying.
2009-02-07T19:10:00.000Z	Tomas___		-is*
2009-02-07T19:12:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	for chat go to #ubuntu-offtopic ;-)
2009-02-07T19:13:00.000Z	Tomas___	hmw	how is that question off topic?
2009-02-07T19:13:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	sorry, i might have overseen your question. even scrolled up. what is your question?
2009-02-07T19:17:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	usually this doesnt happen without reason. if you _really_ didnt change anything, and you didnt update anything, then i would suspect the soundcard to be broken. if you can, get another card of the same model and check it. did you look into the kernel log? did i understand you right, it starts to happen after 2d uptime?
2009-02-07T19:17:00.000Z	Tomas___	hmw	yeah. It works perfectly fine for two days and then just suddenly crashes.
2009-02-07T19:19:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	a problem that starts after 2 days is usually hard do itentify. you could try with a different linux distro, or maybe ubuntu 8.04.
2009-02-07T19:20:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	did you watch the syslog? i'd suggest you let it run with tail and hope for finding a pattern.
2009-02-07T19:22:00.000Z	Tomas___	hmw	not found anything that seems related there.
2009-02-07T19:24:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	hmm... i'd let it run in a terminal anyways, maybe you get lucky. on the other hand, 2 days sounds more like hardware problems than software to me.
2009-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	does restarting X solve the problem, or did you have to do a full reboot?
2009-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	Tomas___	hmw	only full reboot
2009-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	a wild guess: you could put the sound card to another pci slot.
2009-02-07T19:26:00.000Z	hmw	Tomas___	i dont know the sound stuff in linux really. it might be a bug related to your sound card. maybe google tells you more about this.
