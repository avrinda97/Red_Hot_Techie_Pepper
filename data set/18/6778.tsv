2008-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	how do you mean? I want to do it from client side just as in windows
2008-04-20T15:00:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	_Bart_	you still there? so when you try to access the shared folder it askes for password?
2008-04-20T15:00:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	no it loggs in as guest
2008-04-20T15:00:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	so I don't have write rights
2008-04-20T15:02:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	so I need to do that every time I connect to another pc
2008-04-20T15:04:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	_Bart_	I am not sure i am explaining well, you are sharing your file from ubuntu, so setup username access for samba so when you connect from any pc, you use that user and pass you setup
2008-04-20T15:05:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	Ubuntu is the client not the server ;)
2008-04-20T15:06:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	The server is win xp
2008-04-20T15:08:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	_Bart_	up
2008-04-20T15:09:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	_Bart_	sorry tools folder options view
2008-04-20T15:09:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	that is server side?
2008-04-20T15:10:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	yes, but I don't have access to the XP server. I need to do it client side @ ubuntu
2008-04-20T15:13:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	_Bart_	then who ever has access to the Xp server should allow access for the user you are using. there is not much you can do from client side if permission is denied on xp
2008-04-20T15:14:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	I have an username and password to login but where can I enter it?
2008-04-20T15:15:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	I need an "enter your username and password" dialog
2008-04-20T15:16:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	I allready HAVE my own username and password BUT they are NOT the same as my ubuntu username and password
2008-04-20T15:19:00.000Z	_Bart_	jaffarkelshac	my windows does have a dialogbox by default
