2007-07-19T06:17:00.000Z	neozen	asim	reset what settings for which programs?
2007-07-19T06:17:00.000Z	neozen	asim	ah...
2007-07-19T06:20:00.000Z	neozen	asim	sudo apt-get reinstall firefox at the command line
2007-07-19T06:21:00.000Z	neozen	asim	did you delete the .mozilla/firefox folder in your root directory?
2007-07-19T06:21:00.000Z	neozen	asim	do that first
2007-07-19T06:22:00.000Z	neozen	asim	get to a terminal
2007-07-19T06:22:00.000Z	neozen	asim	and type rm -r .mozilla/firefox
2007-07-19T06:23:00.000Z	neozen	asim	ok
2007-07-19T06:29:00.000Z	neozen	asim	sure you don't mean firefox?
2007-07-19T06:46:00.000Z	neozen	asim	couple plugin possibilities for that
2007-07-19T06:46:00.000Z	neozen	asim	right now I'm using mozilla-mplayer
2007-07-19T06:47:00.000Z	neozen	asim	there's also one that uses totem to play videos embedded in pages.... can't really provide an opinion on that
2007-07-19T06:48:00.000Z	neozen	asim	matter of opinion
2007-07-19T06:48:00.000Z	neozen	asim	I happen to think so...
2007-07-19T06:48:00.000Z	neozen	asim	but I'm sure there are others here who could give you reasons why totem is better
2007-07-19T06:48:00.000Z	neozen	asim	saw something a few minutes ago.....
