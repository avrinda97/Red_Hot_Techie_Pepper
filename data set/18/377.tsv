2012-03-14T19:57:00.000Z	pepee	Shotokan81	tried alsamixer?
2012-03-14T20:03:00.000Z	Shotokan81	pepee	launched alsamixer, it recon the card and the chip, I can change the volume on some pieces, but "master" is stuck at 0
2012-03-14T20:05:00.000Z	pepee	Shotokan81	use the up arroy in your keyboard
2012-03-14T20:06:00.000Z	Shotokan81	pepee	yes it works for PCM, MIC & BIP, but no bar for master and impossible to increase the value
