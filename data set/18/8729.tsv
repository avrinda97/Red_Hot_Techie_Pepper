2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		It should tell you that synaptic is already the newest version
2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		Well then you should proabably re-install ubuntu
2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		oh
2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		sudo
2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		or su
2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		Try this
2008-03-15T09:52:00.000Z	NETWizz		sudo -i
2008-03-15T09:53:00.000Z	NETWizz		sudo -i will get you to the #
2008-03-15T09:53:00.000Z	NETWizz		then you don't need a million sudos
2008-03-15T09:53:00.000Z	NETWizz		Just be carful not to stay at the # and think twice each time you execute something
2008-03-15T09:53:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	do u know the difference between sudo -s and sudo -i?
2008-03-15T09:54:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	and btw, ubuntu doesn't support it, you really should not help people with sudo -i. ;)
2008-03-15T09:56:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	tritium it's on Ubuntu Wiki, it should not be used
2008-03-15T09:57:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	tritium Please do not suggest this to others unless you personally are available 24/7 to support the user if they have issues as a result of running a shell as root.
2008-03-15T09:59:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	I do it, but you should not teach people. :P
2008-03-15T10:00:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	people tend to solve most problems by running stuff on a root shell. Sometimes they're not ready. ;P
2008-03-15T10:01:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	I believe this is not the root of all evils, doing and rm -rf on a root shell. Instead, get used to it as the 'Administrator' account on Windows.
2008-03-15T10:02:00.000Z	Lunks	NETWizz	yeah, pain in the ass to do lots of sudos. ;P
