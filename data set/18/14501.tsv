2005-09-06T13:38:00.000Z	h08817		is it possible for your hd to completely stop working from installing operating systems too many times?
2005-09-06T13:39:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	: theoretically, yes, but you'd havta install quite a few
2005-09-06T13:40:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	can u give me an example number b/c i have installed windows ALOT!!! on this one hd due to viruses and stuff then i installed linux 2 times and now i turned it on the other day and it couldn't find certain sectors
2005-09-08T10:07:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	windows boot floppy
2005-09-08T10:07:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	it is installed on a win98
2005-09-08T10:08:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	a windows boot floppy will clean the mbr
2005-09-08T10:08:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	so does it have to be a 98 boot floppy?
2005-09-08T10:08:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	and if so where can i get one?
2005-09-08T10:08:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	use your win98 to make one
2005-09-08T10:09:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	put fdisk.com on it when it's made
2005-09-08T10:09:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	that is the fdisk.com in your c:/windows/ directory
2005-09-08T10:09:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	you DID say win98, right?
2005-09-08T10:10:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	yes 98
2005-09-08T10:11:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	make a boot disk, and find your fdisk.com you have in c:/windows/command and copy that onto it
2005-09-08T10:11:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	boot with the floppy, and type "fdisk /mbr", and that'll do it
2005-09-08T10:14:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	how do i know which version of 98 i have? i know i don't have se but i have custom and OEM to choose from
2005-09-08T10:14:00.000Z	Nalioth	h08817	it doesnt matter
2005-09-08T10:16:00.000Z	h08817	Nalioth	ok thanks
