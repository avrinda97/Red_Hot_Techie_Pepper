2006-06-04T12:10:00.000Z	InvisibleMan		I'm getting this error when I attempt to start the Ubuntu 6.06 demo from a desktop CD I burned: "Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block #" where # is a number from 0 to 15.  Does anyone know how to fix it?
2006-06-04T12:10:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	its a CD rom error = are you on a laptop?
2006-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	 if you are try adding "noapic nolapic acpi=off" as kernel options in advanced boot it may help
2006-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	 Ok, thanks, I'll see if I can do that.
2006-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	but the problem is definately a compatability issue with either your IDE controller or your CD drive itself
2006-06-04T12:12:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	as a last resort, maybe try burning another ISO just incase your install disc is corrupted
2006-06-04T12:14:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	 Where are the advanced boot options?
2006-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	i belive you should be able to press F5 or F6, the result should be that you are able to type words in at the botom of the installer screen
2006-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	do you have a working version of windows etc up?
2006-06-04T12:16:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	 I have windows XP running on that comp, yes.
2006-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	as troy_s said, it might be worth checking the disc before proceeding - if you boot into windows you can use this program http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/%7Efloydian/md5/md5v12005.exe to check that the ISO you downloaded isnt corrupted in any way
2006-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	 When I press F6, this appears at the bottom of the screen: Boot Options .size=1048576 root=/dev/ram rw quiet splash -- <this is where the curser is put, there is nothing after this>
2006-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	yes that is where you put it, just type "noapic nolapic acpi=off" where the cursor sits
2006-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	 It works just fine on this computer.
2006-06-04T12:18:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	the older computer is my "bomb shelter", I'm trying to dual boot XP and Ubuntu on that before I attempt it on my newer one.
2006-06-04T12:19:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	I'll try that boot option now, brb
2006-06-04T12:19:00.000Z	skippy81	InvisibleMan	good luck :)
2006-06-04T12:23:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	skippy81	That didn't work :(
