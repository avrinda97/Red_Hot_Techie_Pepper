2005-12-03T13:08:00.000Z	Hobbsee	slashx1896	you'd have to either use the install cd, and create another one there, or use gparted, and then mount the new partition as /home in /etc/fstab
2005-12-03T13:10:00.000Z	Hobbsee	slashx1896	hit manual partition, and go from there
2005-12-03T13:11:00.000Z	Hobbsee	slashx1896	create a new partition, (you might have to resize another one), and mount it as /home - it's one of the options
2005-12-03T13:16:00.000Z	Hobbsee	slashx1896	do you have any free space?
2005-12-09T06:47:00.000Z	Hobbsee	slashx1896	see your PM's
2005-12-09T06:47:00.000Z	slashx1896	Hobbsee	is that for java runtime evniorment?
2005-12-09T06:47:00.000Z	Hobbsee	slashx1896	yes
2005-12-09T06:48:00.000Z	slashx1896	Hobbsee	the 2nd or first one? or both?
