2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	joshdreamland		haha
2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	joshdreamland		So I'm screwed, essentially.
2010-11-17T08:01:00.000Z	joshdreamland		I don't know what else to say. Lucid worked fine, I updated via the Update Manager, now Maverick is broken
2010-11-17T08:01:00.000Z	joshdreamland		Lucid is the only distro that could recover from blacklist.conf not listing agpgart and intel-agp (neither of which are loaded)
2010-11-17T08:02:00.000Z	joshdreamland		dang, they should really put that in bold print
2010-11-17T08:02:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	upgrades are tough, I upgraded, then I ended up wiping and doing a clean install.
2010-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	you have nvidia?
2010-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	joshdreamland	ubuntu4shane	yes
2010-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	did you upgrade with proprietary drivers?
2010-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	joshdreamland	ubuntu4shane	I have nvidia-glx-173 installed
2010-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	I got dumpped to tty after upgrading with nvidia
2010-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	joshdreamland	ubuntu4shane	How'd you fix it?
2010-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	I don't remember now, but I messed around with installing xorg over and drivers or something
2010-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	I don't remember, but I did get it, I had to uninstall and re-install stuff
2010-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	no, all via command line, I just logged into the tty, and was hardwired, so that wasn't a problem
2010-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	joshdreamland	ubuntu4shane	Did you do it all form tty, or did you have to use a livecd?
2010-11-17T08:23:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	I'm pretty sure, also the nvidia drivers, I don't remember what all I did, but I 'hacked' away and got it
2010-11-17T08:24:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	joshdreamland	I'm about 90% sure it was the xorg-nvidia stuff, I would search, but I"m on my dumb ATI laptop. :)
