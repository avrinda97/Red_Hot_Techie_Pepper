2007-10-21T07:10:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	the brightness settings.
2007-12-08T23:56:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	same advantages. only GUI, and almost no eavesdropping.
2007-12-08T23:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	the keyboard/mouse is locked to the gksudo dialog so as to stop rogue GUI programs from eavesdropping on your password
2007-12-08T23:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	NO NO NO. don't bother. and what you said probably isn't true
2007-12-09T00:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	"the server only can run gui apps via x11 forwarding on ssh"
2007-12-09T00:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	what do you mean?
2007-12-09T00:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	do you have X installed?
2007-12-09T00:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	no.
2007-12-09T00:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	i installed xbase-clients. that allowed me to run gui apps by forwarding them via ssh.
2007-12-09T00:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	ok, safely disregard what i say then, but simply be careful
2007-12-09T00:02:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	so do i install gksudo?
2007-12-09T00:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	go on, but be careful. every encryption algo can be cracked in the future if ppl know how.
2007-12-09T00:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	i'm giving you awareness. encryption is basically math
2007-12-09T00:04:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	ok then.
2007-12-09T00:04:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	yes i know.
2007-12-09T00:06:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kbrooks	the method of encrypting is like documented or what ever and the only this that prevets it from being hacked is the security of the private key
2007-12-09T00:06:00.000Z	kbrooks	Ashfire908	right
