2008-11-03T03:25:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	What do you mean? Have access to a USB drive plugged on another machine?
2008-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	embrik	ldiamond	wait a minute. How do I mount an external usb harddrive on workstation1, which is mounted on workstation2
2008-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	like lavacano201014 said
2008-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	check out samba on google
2008-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	if you want the USB hdd to be mounted automatically on the workstation attatched to it, use /etc/fstab file
2008-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	embrik	ldiamond	not familiar with filesharing protocol - now I use fish and ssh to connect to this medium - it would be a much smoother way to have a mount point on the common server, so all of my user could reach it by pressing this folder. Do you understand my question?
2008-11-03T03:29:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	yes, setup samba.
2008-11-03T03:29:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	samba will allow you to have a folder on your local machine that actually is on the remote machine, and take care of the transfert
2008-11-03T03:30:00.000Z	embrik	ldiamond	I have only got linux workstations and like to use nfs
2008-11-03T03:33:00.000Z	embrik	ldiamond	what I want to do is to mount this folder on workstation2, which points to the usb hd, on my server
2008-11-03T03:33:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	exactly, you cant just mount it using mount, you need to use something like samba
2008-11-03T03:33:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	that will then enable you to mount it
2008-11-03T03:35:00.000Z	embrik	ldiamond	I know this is a bit too tecnical for me, but can't i mount this using ssh?
2008-11-03T03:35:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	I dont think so
2008-11-03T03:36:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	samba is what you need.
2008-11-03T03:39:00.000Z	ldiamond	embrik	I have no other solution. Samba is usually for linux to linux too
2008-11-03T03:39:00.000Z	embrik	ldiamond	Ok, I'll google for it, Thanks :-)
