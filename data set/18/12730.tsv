2006-03-16T12:15:00.000Z	CarinArr		negativespace, you'll want to install tetex-base/utils/extras
2006-03-16T12:15:00.000Z	NegativeSpace	CarinArr	Will that give me everything I need for LaTeX?
2006-03-16T12:15:00.000Z	CarinArr		negativespace, those will give you the texi2pdf and stuff
2006-03-16T12:15:00.000Z	CarinArr		negativespace, well unless you're doing something fancy that requires some obscure environments
2006-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	CarinArr		negativespace, there's also beamer if you're wanting to do slides, that's a separate package
2006-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	CarinArr		tomypreach, is that a laptop?

2006-03-16T12:19:00.000Z	CarinArr		at least you'll be able to log into windows, and download stuff if you need any extras
