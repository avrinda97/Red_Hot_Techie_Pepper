2007-04-01T11:58:00.000Z	colbert	xtknight	I have installed that script using "sudo bash fixamsn.sh" but when I click aMSN from the menu it starts and doesn't go.. I had it working on a previous install, I just need to set the permissions on it again
2007-04-01T11:59:00.000Z	xtknight	colbert	hmm i have no idea.  what permission are you setting?
2007-04-02T14:50:00.000Z	xtknight	colbert	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre
2007-04-06T10:11:00.000Z	xtknight	colbert	sudo chown user:user file
2007-04-06T10:11:00.000Z	xtknight	colbert	if you do user, it will be owned by user.  if you do user:user it will be both owned and created by user (it will look as if it had been created by user originally)

2007-06-15T13:38:00.000Z	colbert	xtknight	wow thanks i'm in and it works great :]
