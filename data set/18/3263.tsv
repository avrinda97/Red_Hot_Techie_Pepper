2010-04-16T06:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	does any mail from command line work?
2010-04-16T06:29:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	I've only tried mail -s test dsnyders@example.com
2010-04-16T06:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	issue the same command, but add -v, that should give you more details.
2010-04-16T06:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	 I get no further details than: Can't send mail: sendmail process failed
2010-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	Are you running sendmail, or sendemail?
2010-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	I have no idea.
2010-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	How do I find out?
2010-05-30T06:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	I had that happen to me yesterday, installed 10.04 server 32bit. The install process claimed to have installed grub, but it apparantly didn't. I can boot into the system from the cd, but the boot just hangs without it. I plan to check it out on Tuesday, and likely have to reinstall grub2.
2010-09-10T06:45:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	don't you have to have a special drive for a 2.88 flop ?
2010-09-10T06:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	this is going to be used as a PXE boot option.
2010-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	see if this helps: http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/DOS_floppy_images
2010-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	thanks.  I'll take a gander
2010-09-10T06:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	don't bother, mostly DOS info!!
2010-09-10T06:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	dsnyders	check this out! http://www.linux-boot.net/Boot/FD/
2010-09-10T06:54:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	thanks.  I am actually looking to create a  DOS bootable floppy image.
2010-09-10T07:08:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	Okay, here's what I did (because my windows box doesn't have a floppy):   dd if=/dev/fd0 of=floppy.img.  Then I copied floppy.img to my windows box and opened it with a program called winimage.  Winimage has a change format tool.  I changed the format to 2.88, and copied the image back to the linux box.
2010-09-10T07:10:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	now all that's left is to add in the files I needed the extra space for, load it into the tftp folder and try a PXE boot.
2010-09-10T08:02:00.000Z	dsnyders	greezmunkey	Hi.  That procedure for expanding the boot floppy image worked like a charm.
