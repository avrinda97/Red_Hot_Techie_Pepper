2007-06-16T07:58:00.000Z	cruteme		is it possible to use iproute in the networking scripts instead of ifconfig?
2007-06-16T07:59:00.000Z	cruteme		also, is it possible to use CIDR notation for IP addresses?
2007-06-16T08:00:00.000Z	cruteme		can somebody at least point me in the direction of a good set of docs for ubuntu networking?
2007-06-16T08:00:00.000Z	cruteme		I've googled and not found anything great
2007-06-16T08:02:00.000Z	cruteme		anybody care to toss an ex-Gentoo guy a bone about ubuntu networking
2007-06-16T08:02:00.000Z	cruteme		I'm kind of lost right nwo
2007-06-16T08:02:00.000Z	cruteme		*now
2007-06-16T08:03:00.000Z	rob_p	cruteme	What do you need to know regarding networking?
2007-06-16T08:03:00.000Z	cruteme	rob_p	I'm trying to figure out how to do cidr style addresses in /etc/network/interfaces
2007-06-16T08:04:00.000Z	cruteme	rob_p	i could do it with the ip command line tool but thats transient
2007-06-16T08:04:00.000Z	rob_p	cruteme	Why not just follow the established convention?
2007-06-16T08:05:00.000Z	cruteme	rob_p	what is that? in the world I live in CIDR IS the accepted standard
2007-06-16T08:05:00.000Z	rob_p	cruteme	'man interfaces' has tons of info regradaing /etc/network/interfaces
2007-06-16T08:06:00.000Z	cruteme	rob_p	ok... I'll give it a try... are there any good web-based docs that you know of?
2007-06-16T08:06:00.000Z	cruteme	rob_p	i'm not opposed to man... the more docs the merrier!
2007-06-16T08:06:00.000Z	rob_p	cruteme	:-)  Yeah.  That should point you in the right direction.
2007-06-16T08:07:00.000Z	cruteme	rob_p	thanks... that should give me a good start
2007-06-16T08:07:00.000Z	rob_p	cruteme	welcome
