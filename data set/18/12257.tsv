2012-02-02T18:11:00.000Z	porkchop85		Hi anyone here work with PXE
2012-02-02T18:12:00.000Z	porkchop85		I have a dell optiplex that wont PXE boot it will pxe boot if i run an Ipxe boot disk
2012-02-02T18:13:00.000Z	porkchop85		is that a firmware issue or a driver issue in the kernel
2012-02-02T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	nothing to do with linux as at that point you're not booting linux, you're pxe booting from the cards firmware
2012-02-02T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	there used to be an old bug on dells that needed to be upgraded, but I've not seen it for a long long time
2012-02-02T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	hence my surprise
2012-02-02T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	it's a very very old bug that I've not seen on anything modern for a long time
2012-02-02T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	as I recall it was on broadcom cards
2012-02-02T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	it may have been realtek, it's been a long long time since I saw it
2012-02-02T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	best suggestion (seriously) is contact dell and just confirm it
2012-02-02T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	this used to be well known with dells but I've not seen it for such a long time, I'm quite surprised
2012-02-02T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	I'm quite surprised by what you are saying, but I suspect dell can either update you/confirm the problem quite easy for you
2012-02-02T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	because that problem disappeared a long time ago
2012-02-02T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	based on the fact that it also boots with ipxe suggests you are setup fine, and this is also the exact same situation I used to see
2012-02-02T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	they probably have an update to allow it to just straight pxe
2012-02-07T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	connecticity to what ?
2012-02-07T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	then that's not an ubuntu issue
2012-02-07T19:40:00.000Z	ikonia	porkchop85	~/IOS and /home/johnny/Downloads/IOS are different directories
