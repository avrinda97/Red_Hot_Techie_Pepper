2005-03-31T09:31:00.000Z	lrojas		i should have installed Warty instead of the stupid preview one
2005-03-31T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	it's called flashplugin-nonfree.
2005-03-31T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	and it's in multiverse
2005-03-31T09:32:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	well have you enabled multiverse?
2005-03-31T09:32:00.000Z	lrojas	crimsun	are you using 5.04?
2005-03-31T09:32:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	~5.04
2005-03-31T09:33:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	either edit /etc/apt/sources.list manually and uncomment the multiverse line, then update && upgrade, or use Synaptic
2005-03-31T09:41:00.000Z	lrojas	crimsun	i am getting an error whith the repositories...
2005-04-01T07:46:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	nope, standard install.  sudo dpkg -i cedega....deb
2005-04-01T07:48:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	cedega is not distributed in an apt-gettable repo.
2005-04-01T07:48:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	you must download the deb manually and install it via dpkg
2005-04-01T07:54:00.000Z	lrojas	crimsun	are you running cedega on hoary ?
2005-04-01T07:54:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	installed but haven't executed in quite some months
2005-04-01T07:54:00.000Z	lrojas	crimsun	but have you ran it under a 2.6 kernel?
2005-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	crimsun	lrojas	yes, the newer versions supposed run fine.  Ask in #cedega if you have questions.
2005-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	lrojas	crimsun	kay will do
