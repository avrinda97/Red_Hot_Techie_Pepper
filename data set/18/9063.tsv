2007-06-27T08:22:00.000Z	gdb	zabin	ah, interesting, well, then dpkg -L on those to see - i don't see a server in there
2007-06-27T08:22:00.000Z	zabin		neither do i .
2007-06-27T08:23:00.000Z	zabin	gdb	i dont think the service is running because i checked to see what services are running from the service option in gonme. any ideas what coudl be causing the problem?
2007-06-27T08:24:00.000Z	gdb	zabin	I'm afraid I've not caught exactly what the issue is other than you're wanting to shut down a running vnc server process.
2007-06-27T08:24:00.000Z	zabin		ok

2007-06-27T08:25:00.000Z	gdb		er I've been a noob since 1994.
2007-06-27T08:26:00.000Z	zabin	gdb	at work i have to tunnel port 5900 and 5901 to vnc in to my computer at home. i can use vnc on a windows machine with just vnc lisner installed on it and it works fine just using the host name as localhost:5900 but when i try to vnc on my linux machine it tries to connect to its self because it thinks thats im referring to it as localhost i believe.
2007-06-27T08:26:00.000Z	gdb	zabin	The Linux system you're trying to connect from is at work?
2007-06-27T08:27:00.000Z	zabin		yes
2007-06-27T08:27:00.000Z	zabin	gdb	the port is blocked at work though but port 22 isnt so i can tunnel 5900
2007-06-27T08:27:00.000Z	gdb	zabin	ie; you have both a windows and linux client at the office, and you're connecting remotely to a linux server at your home?
2007-06-27T08:27:00.000Z	zabin		yes
2007-06-27T08:28:00.000Z	zabin	gdb	the windows client is running on vmware.
2007-06-27T08:28:00.000Z	gdb	zabin	And connecting to port 5900 at localhost on the Linux machine does not work to opena display on your home machine?
