2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	also, please do not paste multiple lines into here, go to #flood or post it on pastebin.com

2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	so you have 2 physical hard disks that you are trying to dual boot?
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	 ok, so instead of (hd0,0), you would use (hd1,0) or if it is not slave, use hd2 or hd3 as appropriate
2005-02-24T08:48:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	heres the grub online manual with the naming conventions: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Naming-convention.html#Naming%20convention
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	here's the configuration section, you can use that as a base guide for adding in the section http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Configuration.html#Configuration
