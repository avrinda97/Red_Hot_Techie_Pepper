2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		I must say...  I am highly impressed
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		The only thing I can't do is run Photoshop
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		Everything else works like a charm.
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		hano: unfortunately, I am running an XP desktop to my right. :)
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		Yes, I'm running WINE.  I can't get PS CS2 to run correctly in it.
2008-02-08T09:32:00.000Z	_Oz_		jack sparrow: CS2?  I found a tutorial, but I can't get it to work the way the tutorial suggested.
2008-02-08T09:32:00.000Z	_Oz_		Thanks, Jacj

2008-02-08T09:33:00.000Z	_Oz_		One other Q: is there any way to get a laptop w/ integrated wireless card onto my network?
2008-02-08T09:33:00.000Z	_Oz_		Ubuntu's biggest weakness seems to be wireless networking
2008-02-08T09:34:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	what kind of wireless chip does your laptop have?
2008-02-08T09:36:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	are you coming from a different linux distro, or from windows?
2008-02-08T09:38:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	then i'll try and make it as simple as i can: "/" is roughly equal "C:\".
2008-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	_Oz_	joh6nn	thanks for the / to c:/ comparison :)
2008-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	no problem
2008-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	you comfortable on the command line?
2008-02-08T09:44:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	if you try the gimp, be sure to try the gimpshop version of it, or you'll be lost
2008-02-08T09:45:00.000Z	joh6nn	_Oz_	www.gimpshop.com. : ) alternatively, try Pixel: http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=12
