2009-05-23T22:08:00.000Z	nel	remoteCTRL	I used ctrl alt f1 and then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-05-23T22:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	how have you installed that one, per package or per menu?
2009-05-23T22:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	you had to install the driver somehow; did you download it or did u use the ubuntu one?
2009-05-23T22:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	not a good thing to do...
2009-05-23T22:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	ubuntu has a menu in system/administration/hardware driver, always use that one;)
2009-05-23T22:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	wth?? the driver hast an uninstall option, something like --remove or so, try to use that one
2009-05-23T22:11:00.000Z	nel	remoteCTRL	that version worked for me before my jaunty upgrade but since on jaunty the hardware driver has never worked properly... no opengl at all
2009-05-23T22:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	 i see, yet still the best recommendation i can give is to uninstall it and use ubuntus own one
2009-05-23T22:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	i doubt that... still better to use the uninstall method of the driver itself, even if you have to reinstall half of gnome after that...
2009-05-23T22:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	what you mean by steal?
2009-05-23T22:19:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	well in that case i cant help you very mucho man...
2009-05-23T22:20:00.000Z	nel	remoteCTRL	you cant because im on wireless internet???
2009-05-23T22:21:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	i cant because i cannot tell you how to configure your wirteless manually
2009-05-23T22:22:00.000Z	nel	remoteCTRL	og hehe no worries then, thought you were being preachy on the ethics of using other peoples wireless heheh   ;) i'ma download a new cd for jaunty and re-install.... hopefully i get this working thanks for the input
2009-05-23T22:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	i sure got my opinion on that but i dont need to share right?;)
2009-05-23T22:24:00.000Z	nel	remoteCTRL	hehe wasnt like I used airo-ng or anything there no security on the network
2009-05-23T22:24:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nel	i frankly spoken relly dont care, dude;)
