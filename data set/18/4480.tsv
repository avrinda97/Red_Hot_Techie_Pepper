2011-01-13T05:43:00.000Z	nunya		I like to use echo "some command here" >> ~/blah/fileneame to write something in a file really quick, but how can I write the output from ifconfig into a file really quick using echo?
2011-01-13T05:45:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	ifconfig >> file && cat file
2011-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	nunya	shcherbak	thank you very much
2011-01-13T05:48:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	ifconfig >> file will also do, drop xchat, use irssi. you can grep logs to show Quit/Joined
2011-01-13T05:50:00.000Z	nunya	shcherbak	I've already set up xchat in such a nice way =/
2011-01-13T05:51:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	do you want to see joined/quit in channel window?
2011-01-13T05:52:00.000Z	nunya	shcherbak	all right, i'll make the jump.. irssi have a config file I can edit?
2011-01-13T05:53:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	check website first, you can do mostly anything with irssi, but how do you want to see those join/quit messsages in xchat: new window, channel wondow?
2011-01-13T05:54:00.000Z	nunya	shcherbak	I don't want to see them at all... although I should probably invest in irssi if it is the super-configurable irc client.  I like to take configurability over ease of use
2011-01-13T05:55:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	you sould have filter option in menu in xchat, one second...

2011-01-21T11:12:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	menu > System > Preferencies > Keyboard Shortcut, to see "button code" an command triggered.
2011-01-21T11:14:00.000Z	nunya	shcherbak	thanks, I'll give it a shot
2011-01-21T11:22:00.000Z	nunya	shcherbak	it doesn't tell me the exact command for the shortcut it just says XF86AudioLowerVolume
2011-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	shcherbak	nunya	amixer let you control volume lever from cli.
