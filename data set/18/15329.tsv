2005-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	tom_neo		msn is crap
2005-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	Ironfrost	tom_neo	- but it's what everyone uses
2005-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	tom_neo	Ironfrost	is it?
2005-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	tom_neo		i know much more ppl using icq
2005-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	tom_neo		you are only supporting this crap by using it
2005-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	Ironfrost		I guess it depends how old you are
2005-04-22T08:30:00.000Z	Ironfrost		I don't know anyone under about 20 who uses ICQ
2005-04-22T08:30:00.000Z	Ironfrost		and all of them have been on the internet for years
2005-04-22T08:30:00.000Z	Ironfrost		all of my non-geek friends use MSN
2005-04-22T08:31:00.000Z	tom_neo	Ironfrost	well non-geeks are easy told to use sth else - you just tell them this is crap and they believe ^^
2005-04-22T08:31:00.000Z	Ironfrost		in fact, the webcam function on MSN is the only reason I'm missing Windows
2005-04-22T08:31:00.000Z	Ironfrost	tom_neo	- the value of an IM protocol is in the people that use it
2005-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	tom_neo	Ironfrost	maybe that's one reason more why i don't use M$N
2005-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	Ironfrost		heh, maybe
2005-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	tom_neo		and where is the problem with a webcam feature in linux?
2005-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	tom_neo		you just have to look which cam to buy, before you buy ^^
2005-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	Ironfrost	tom_neo	there isn't one, that's what the problem is
