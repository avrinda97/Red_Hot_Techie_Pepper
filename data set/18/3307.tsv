2009-12-06T21:53:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	you need to change the permisssion of the HDD, or format it to a filesystem that doesnt support permissions
2009-12-06T21:54:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	The best way is to just chmod 777 it.
2009-12-06T21:54:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	do you know where the HDD is mounted? it should be somewhere in /media
2009-12-06T21:55:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	Okay, Now open a terminal, and type in 'sudo chmod -R 777 /media/sdc2/
2009-12-06T21:56:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	chmoding it to 777 will allow everyone writing access to it
2009-12-06T21:57:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	Then 777 should be OK
2009-12-06T21:57:00.000Z	tottto-drummond	mdeonte	do I need to reboot after ?
2009-12-06T21:57:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	No, now try to access the hdd with nautilus, and make a file
2009-12-06T21:59:00.000Z	tottto-drummond	mdeonte	I do have access to it.. but cannot transfer any file to it
2009-12-06T22:00:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	interesting.. what is the user account you are using it under called?
2009-12-06T22:01:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	what is your acount name
2009-12-06T22:01:00.000Z	tottto-drummond	mdeonte	maurice
2009-12-06T22:02:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	Okay, try the command 'sudo chown -R maurice /media/sdc2/'
2009-12-06T22:14:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	I got your PM, patience
2009-12-06T22:09:00.000Z	mdeonte	tottto-drummond	damn, uh try opening 'gksudo nautilus' and going to the /media folder
2009-12-06T22:14:00.000Z	tottto-drummond	mdeonte	could it be related to users and group ?
