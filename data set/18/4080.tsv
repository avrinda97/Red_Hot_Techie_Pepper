2010-08-01T03:33:00.000Z	LjL		no. this channel is about legal Ubuntu support.
2010-08-01T03:35:00.000Z	LjL		your english isn't very understandable. have you tried #ubuntu-es?
2010-08-01T03:36:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	I sent him !es.  He ignores it.
2010-09-17T00:43:00.000Z	LjL	edbian	i think so, but i'm not familiar with it. i am, however, more familiar with the Minimal CD, which is about 10 megs and gets pretty much everything from the net.
2010-09-17T00:45:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Yeah here's the thing.  I have a netbook.  No CD drive and I don't have a jump drive big enough for Ubuntu.  I just tried unetbootin but the harddrive was mounted (cause that's how it works.  And I couldn't install Ubuntu.
2010-09-17T00:47:00.000Z	LjL	edbian	wait, what do you mean the harddrive was mounted? i assume you copied the CD to a USB stick using unetbootin, and then booted from it?
2010-09-17T00:48:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	No man.  You can use unetbootin to boot an ISO on the harddrive of the machine.
2010-09-17T00:48:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	If I could put Ubuntu on a live USB I'd do that.  I don't have a stick big enough.
2010-09-17T00:49:00.000Z	LjL	edbian	uhm, again though, you only really need a ~10mb stick for minimal.
2010-09-17T00:49:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Anyway, what happens is Ubuntu thinks the HDD is the cd (since it is a live CD iso) and it thinks it's mounted so it won't repartition the drive.
2010-09-17T00:49:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Oh! Duh!  Brilliant
2010-09-17T00:49:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Thanks for that.  forward palm
2010-09-17T00:50:00.000Z	LjL	edbian	of course you don't have all the fancy graphics of the live installer... but it always worked just fine for me. although if you don't have wired ethernet, i guess that might be problematic.
2010-09-17T00:52:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Mmmm, yeah...
2010-09-17T00:52:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Thanks for the help! Sometimes it just takes another pair of eyes
2011-04-18T03:21:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	Bit late don't you think?
2011-04-18T03:22:00.000Z	LjL	edbian	no, especially not when he's still in the channel and PM'ing users
2011-04-18T03:22:00.000Z	edbian	LjL	ahhh
