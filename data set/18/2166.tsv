2012-01-23T14:11:00.000Z	Mcl0vin		but i can still use something.dyndns-server.com to ssh to my box and to NX to my box
2012-01-23T14:13:00.000Z	Mcl0vin		cconstantine: also from inside the lan i tried mydomain.com and it works
2012-01-23T14:15:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	who is your internet service provide I know comcast has issues with ssh
2012-01-23T14:19:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	what is the deal this lan ur on?
2012-01-23T14:24:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	mintman	what do you mean ?
2012-01-23T14:26:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	free internet! be happy. mines not free.  Dad works for Quest they do updates to routers nation wide so u could lose features or have to pay for services. Way for company to feed there cash cow .
2012-01-23T14:27:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	mintman	is there a test i can do to check is they are blocking port 80
2012-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	not sure ? I really believe u have a change in settings
2012-01-23T14:29:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	mintman	coolstar-ipod this is my ISP http://www.egreenfield.com/
2012-01-23T14:31:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	mintman	should i call them and ask if they block port 80
2012-01-23T14:34:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	Heard of this new package sold it with house hadn't seen it personnelly. Form what my father was getting at it was a limited service , but provided a package deal to new housing. Fiber optics gave a great deal.  Just paying for the service up front.
2012-01-23T14:35:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	mintman	but there should be a test i can run to see if they block port 80
2012-01-23T14:39:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	In this case I wouldn't run that test messing with ur contract. Contact company ask if they support ssh.  I wouldn't play with my housing authority.  U belong to a community make sure all my setting are correct first..  This is odd for california to start restrictions.  Those communities are expensive and the house is not cheap.  Uncle owns 2 houses in the palm springs area as well...
2012-01-23T14:40:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	personnelly I think it is a setting in ur linux box
2012-01-23T14:43:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	mintman	coolstar-ipod ^^
2012-01-23T14:46:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	try this http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch19_:_Dynamic_DNS
2012-01-23T14:51:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	well good luck . would contact service provider my have limited contract with housing area
2012-01-23T14:51:00.000Z	mintman	Mcl0vin	got to run :)
