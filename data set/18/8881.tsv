2007-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	tom_24		Phixnay - Yeah - i will give your idea a shot any way - afterall - what have i got to loose?
2007-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	tom_24		Anyone recommend a good partition re-sizer? (particular for NTFS) =D
2007-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	tom_24		Doh! already have it on CD =/
2007-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	tom_24		 Guys i know this is a little off topic - but does anyone know of a good "Software" KVM?
2007-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	comphappy	tom_24	i would look into vertualization VMWare
2007-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	tom_24	comphappy	Well i have 2 computers and i just want to be able to share them both with one keyboard and mouse - i was hoping there was a software version out somewhere =(
2007-06-10T15:18:00.000Z	comphappy	tom_24	you could also do VNC, that is free and i use it at home
2007-06-10T15:19:00.000Z	comphappy	tom_24	it is a server that serve your desktop out to another computer
2007-06-10T15:20:00.000Z	tom_24	comphappy	Thanks Man - shall have a read up on it :)

2007-06-10T15:23:00.000Z	comphappy	tom_24	i think you want vnc
2007-06-10T15:24:00.000Z	tom_24	comphappy	will that offer me a "fluid" move between the 2 machines?
2007-06-10T15:25:00.000Z	comphappy	tom_24	basicly you set up 1 computer, hook monitor and stuff up to it conifigure the vncserver, then disconect monitor go to the other comp, now you will beable to login to the other one, full desktop
2007-06-10T15:25:00.000Z	tom_24	comphappy	- Brilliant! thanks again!
2007-06-10T15:30:00.000Z	tom_24	comphappy	Found what i was after - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynergyHowto - Just thought you might want to know for future reference =)
2007-06-10T15:32:00.000Z	tom_24	comphappy	- the 2 computers will be on a "local" network not connected to the web or anything - so i should be ok =)
