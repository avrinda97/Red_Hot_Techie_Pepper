2008-01-28T04:17:00.000Z	techgeek40		I have a question - under Windows XP and Vista, my network (internet) is FAST - but under ubuntu it is slow - any suggestions?
2008-01-28T04:17:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	MTU settings?
2008-01-28T04:18:00.000Z	techgeek40	bascule	How would I find the MTU - in windows I would know how - but in linux lol nope
2008-01-28T04:18:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	ifconfig

2008-01-28T04:22:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	sudo ifconfig eth0 MTU 1464
2008-01-28T04:22:00.000Z	techgeek40	bascule	what does that do for me?
2008-01-28T04:24:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	well stops packet fragmentation hopefully, which is a guess at the cause of the slowness
2008-01-28T04:26:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492
2008-01-28T04:27:00.000Z	techgeek40	bascule	no errors - also checking some forums on it
2008-01-28T04:27:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	didn't make it quicker then?
2008-01-28T04:27:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	bandwidth or response times?
2008-01-28T04:28:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	try different mtu settings, and download someting via wget so you get feedback on the speeds
2008-01-28T04:31:00.000Z	techgeek40	bascule	Got it - here is the command I used and MUCH MUCH faster now
2008-01-28T04:32:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	well thanks, not one I knew of, jst for my interest can you post the new ifconfig output for me?
2008-01-28T04:34:00.000Z	techgeek40	bascule	here it is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53810/
2008-01-28T04:35:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	MTU:1492 but maybe a coincedence :)
2008-01-28T04:36:00.000Z	bascule	techgeek40	that's some connection :D
