2007-04-03T14:30:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	LeoNz	are you trying the feisty alternate install cd by any chance?
2007-04-03T14:31:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	LeoNz	what error messages did it put out? yes a big difference
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	LeoNz	did you try partitioning prior installation or while installation?
2007-04-03T14:34:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	LeoNz	try this, run sudo gparted from the terminal and see if it has any errors
