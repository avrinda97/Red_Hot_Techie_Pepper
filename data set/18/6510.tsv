2008-05-07T20:08:00.000Z	Deepthought		is it normal for nvidia binary driver to disappear after kernel update (´official´ update in Hardy from .16 to.17) ?
2008-05-07T20:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	if you compiled it yourself yes
2008-05-07T20:11:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	nope, did not; it was in the scheduled updates,   But it´s using normal driver now, and if I start hardware driver manager for restricted it doesn´ t show up, not even un-activated
2008-05-07T20:12:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	no that is not common, as said if you dont manually compile the driver it should be ported with kernel updates
2008-05-07T20:13:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	could it have something to do with adding medibuntu repos to the software sources ?
2008-05-07T20:13:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	as in getting a newer kernel than hardy would normally use, or something ?
2008-05-07T20:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	i cannot tell with certainty but that would of course be a possibility
2008-05-07T20:15:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	if I remove that source again, and rerun updates, would stuff from that repos be removed again ?  guess not huh ?   So is there a way to undo my last updates so I can try again without those repos ?
2008-05-07T20:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	downgrade is of course not automatic, you would need to remove the newer kernel version manually, but what you also can do is download and compile a driver into your newer kernel version and then not download kernel images until hardy catches up
2008-05-07T20:17:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	did you see mipstien is having same issue ?
2008-05-07T20:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	i was just trying to read up what he wrote, yes...
2008-05-07T20:19:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	anyway, compiling the kernel with the driver would of course be an option, but before I get into big-time study sessions like that (I´ m working on my own flavour), I would like to know what caused the problem in the first place, because aas I´ ve always understood updates are not supposed to break the system; so I want the setting that f***d  my rig gone... ya see ?
2008-05-07T20:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	you get a misconception there buddy;)
2008-05-07T20:21:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	what misconception ?
2008-05-07T20:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	if you keep on updating your original hardy image this wont happen, only if you upgrade to something that will not support certain parts of the existing kernel, like upgrading a kernel with nvidia drivers to one that hasnt got the perrequisited dependencies, in that case nvidia will be gone afterwards
2008-05-07T20:22:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	bell is ringing but don´ t quite get it yet  :P
2008-05-07T20:25:00.000Z	Deepthought	remoteCTRL	will do, thanx for getting me on track thoguh !
2008-05-07T20:26:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Deepthought	at your service!
