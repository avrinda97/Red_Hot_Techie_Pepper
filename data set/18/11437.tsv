2006-08-01T11:47:00.000Z	Dattasmoon		can anyone help me with this error? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19412
2006-08-01T11:48:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	what is /dev/storage?
2006-08-01T11:48:00.000Z	Dattasmoon	longwave	a lvm logical drive
2006-08-01T11:48:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	ah ok, sorry i dont know about lvm
2006-08-01T11:49:00.000Z	Dattasmoon	longwave	i don't think it has to do with lvm.. but i could be wrong
2006-08-01T11:49:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	do you have the lvm packages installed? can the lvm tools see your lvm config correctly?
2006-08-01T11:50:00.000Z	Dattasmoon	longwave	i assume so, all the tools seems to work
2006-08-01T11:52:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	is there already a working filesystem on /dev/storage, or did you just create it?
2006-08-01T11:53:00.000Z	Dattasmoon	longwave	it is created by lvm, it is aucutally /dev/stor/storage
2006-08-01T11:53:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	ok, but you have run some form of mkfs on /dev/stor/storage since you created it with the lvm tools?
2006-08-01T11:54:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	hrm, i am not sure then. if nobody else can help in here you should probably ask on the ubuntu forums
2006-08-01T12:06:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	there is a backup (or several backups) of the superblock but i am not sure about recovering it
2006-08-01T12:06:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	does fsck find anything on that volume?
2006-08-01T12:07:00.000Z	Dattasmoon	longwave	nope it is ext3 not reiser
2006-08-01T12:08:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	there is fsck for ext3 too :)
2006-08-01T12:12:00.000Z	Dattasmoon	longwave	yes the e2fsck sees it it says : Superblock has an invalid ext3 hournal (inode 8). Clear<y>? will this delete everything on the drive?
2006-08-01T12:12:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	i am not exactly sure what that message means, sorry..
2006-08-01T12:13:00.000Z	longwave	Dattasmoon	i *think* it is safe to clear an ext3 journal if the drive was properly unmounted last time, but i am not 100% on that
