2007-04-11T15:50:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	i have ntfs-3g installed, however i dont have any hd(a,b,c,etc) in /dev
2007-04-11T15:52:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	are you using ntfs-config? that automatically does it
2007-04-11T15:52:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	if you don't have the /dev/hdx or /dev/sdx, then the system isn't even reconizing those partitions at all
2007-04-11T15:52:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	i have ntfs-config installed, but i guess the more pressing question would be, why dont i see anything like hda or hdb in /dev/ ?
2007-04-11T15:53:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	well its not even seeing hda.. and thats where the system is installed to
2007-04-11T15:54:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	when you run "mount" in terminal, do you see your partitions?
2007-04-11T15:55:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	i got it, thanks for the help, showes up under sda and sdb now
2007-04-11T15:55:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	yeah, you're using SATA harddrives
2007-04-11T15:55:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	no, im just using old ide drives
2007-04-11T15:55:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	my mobo was made before sata even existed
2007-04-11T15:56:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	hum, tha'ts weird.. I thought the "s" prefix was for SATA HDs
2007-04-11T15:56:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	so did i, but it kinda explains alot
2007-04-11T15:57:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	part of the reason i was upgrading was due to a failing drive, which would work fine under the -11 kernel, but under the -14 kernel, wouldnt boot with ata errors, aswell as other issues, so i swapped ide drives, installed fresh, and presto
2007-04-11T15:57:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	ah, well good luck then
2007-04-11T15:58:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	i got it now, i backed up all my data onto a ntfs formatted drive (only thing i had handy, and already had somewhat important data on it) and though, should be simple right?
2007-04-11T15:59:00.000Z	wiseelben	pagan0ne	yeah, you shoudl be able to just copy and paste
2007-04-11T15:59:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wiseelben	yeah, i am now, need to close irc tho, if all goes well i wont be back for a while
