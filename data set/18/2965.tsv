2010-08-19T22:11:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	i understand fstab -- but what's the real question: ****all in one line***
2010-08-19T22:12:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	very good point...sorry!  Ok, I have just done a clean install of 10.04 and used my backup of fstab.  I can see all of my shares listed under 'places'.  This is what I want.  However, when I click any of the shares within Places, it then seems to mount the share and list it twice under places.  Is there any way I can just have them listed under Places, click them and keep the share listed only once?
2010-08-19T22:15:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	sounds like youre mounting the shares twice, how do you have the shared places configured??  Everything in your fstab should have its own mount point and be mounted, must be something with your fstab
2010-08-19T22:16:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	I have created folders relevant to the shares under Media....so I have media > albums, movies, tv shows, etc....would this be a good first point?
2010-08-19T22:17:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	may I go to pm with you, so that I can show you a pastebin of my fstab?
2010-08-19T22:18:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	sorry im kinda busy, your best bet is the room, if I dont reply someone else will
2010-08-19T22:18:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	no worries - ok, so as a first port of call, am I right to create elevant share folders within /media?  so media/albums, etc?
2010-08-19T22:21:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	i dont know what you mean by "shares", what is your definition of a "share"?  A share is usually a folder that you can make accessible to other computers on the network
2010-08-19T22:22:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	ok...On my mac downstairs I have an external HDD connected to it.  This contains a number of folders, such as albums, movies, tv shows, etc.  These have all been shared.  Now, upstairs on ubuntu I have used fstab to access these shares in such a way as they auto mount upon bootup and list under Places...
2010-08-19T22:23:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	so now, I want to be able to click one of these shares under places, and it open up.  This it does, but upon opening up the share it then duplicates the share name within Places.  So if I click on the share "albums", I then see Albums listed twice within Places
2010-08-19T22:24:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	go to your "/etc/fstab",  most likely youre mounting these shares --- you need to make sure the mount points exist in your hard drive,  your fstab should hav ea reference to something like /media/shareone etc. make sure these exist
2010-08-19T22:25:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	yes...I have done this.  In line with fstab I have created relevant 'receiving' folder within 'media'...so on my ubuntu machine I currently have media/albums, media/movies, etc
2010-08-19T22:26:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	chown the mount points to yourself, sudo chown username:username /media/mountpoint
2010-08-19T23:01:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	sorry mate...had to nip away...what is CHOWN?
2010-08-19T23:07:00.000Z	tucemiux	mikebeecham	change of ownership, man chown
2010-08-19T23:08:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	sure...but why?  will this resolve the issue?
2010-09-06T22:38:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tucemiux	is there a way I can change my hostname?
