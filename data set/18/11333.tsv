2007-03-09T16:30:00.000Z	blind	aarohi	try reading up on gftp
2007-03-09T16:32:00.000Z	aarohi	blind	do you have any idea?
2007-03-09T16:32:00.000Z	blind	aarohi	i deal with command line ftp, prolly as simple as right click > copy, go to the new dir, right click > paste
2007-03-09T16:32:00.000Z	aarohi	blind	problem is, there IS no copy, cut, or paste
2007-03-09T16:33:00.000Z	aarohi	blind	could you direct me to the command line way of doing things?
2007-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	aarohi	blind	cp and mv commands don't work.
2007-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	blind	aarohi	sorry, it's ren for rename. and it works cross-directory. ren this /over/here/that
2007-03-09T16:40:00.000Z	aarohi	blind	so that is.. ren <old files> /dir/newnames?
2007-03-09T16:40:00.000Z	blind	aarohi	it may be mren -- check if that's a command.
2007-03-09T16:44:00.000Z	blind	aarohi	are they all in the same directory? if so, try ren * /new/*
2007-03-09T16:46:00.000Z	blind	aarohi	it's referring to the file wp* -- it doesn't see the * as a wildcard, gimme a sec, i will figure this out
