2009-03-11T00:04:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	Are you using a lan or wan address?
2009-03-11T00:05:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	lan
2009-03-11T00:07:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	You're using another box to connect to the machine the vnc-server is on, correct?
2009-03-11T00:10:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	yea im at home on my laptop
2009-03-11T00:10:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	and i want to connect to my desktop downstairs
2009-03-11T00:12:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	I'd install another version of vnc, like tightvnc, and disable the other server to figure out where exactly the issues lies, but that's the lazy-lack-of-thought-processes way out.
2009-03-11T00:13:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	It could be a lot of things: configuration, firewall, laptop, etc, etc.
2009-03-11T00:15:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	Firewalls are finicky.
2009-03-11T00:15:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	thats kinda why i wanted to try to do this internally first so i could weed out any local problems and not have to worry about external ports and such
2009-03-11T00:15:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	Even if you use another version of VNC you can still do it internally.
2009-03-11T00:16:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	Using another version of VNC allows you to decipher whether or not the issue lies with the said vnc-server or whether it exists elsewhere.
2009-03-11T00:16:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	Otherwise you're just poking around in random directions assuming that something here works -- when it may not.
2009-03-11T00:16:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	i suppose
2009-03-11T00:17:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	this would be a lot easier to fix if i could vnc to the computer when i go to work soon but unfortunatly thats the problem :(
2009-03-11T00:18:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	Time is always of the essence, eh? Work isn't fun. :| In my experience though, Tightvnc has always worked right out of the box. ^_^
2009-03-11T00:18:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	Well tightvnc is better for external connections right?
2009-03-11T00:19:00.000Z	Nalfeshnee	ScottG489	I wont claim better or worse, but it has always worked for me. ^_^
2009-03-11T00:21:00.000Z	ScottG489	Nalfeshnee	ok ill apt-get it when im at work and try to configure it from there. i gotta go now. thanks!
