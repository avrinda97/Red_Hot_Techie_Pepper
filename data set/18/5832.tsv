2008-08-15T01:46:00.000Z	matlab		Hello. I have to move about 100 folders into one single folder. However, 6 out of these 100 folders need to stay and cannot be touched because they have very delicate permissions. Is there some way I can move ("mv") ALL (sudo mv *) folders into another folder but exclude some specific ones. For example ("sudo mv * /home/user1/ exclude examplefolder1, examplefolder2, examplefolder3)
2008-08-15T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	matlab	simle loop script, for i in `ls | grep -v folder1 | grep -v folder2 | grep -v folder3` ; do ; mv $i $new_path; done
2008-08-15T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	matlab	that will move everything except for folder1, ,2 and 3
2008-08-15T01:51:00.000Z	matlab	ikonia	so assume I am in the directory that has all the folders I want to move. I type: "sudo mv -r * | grep -v folder1 |  grep -v folder2 | grep -v folder3 ; do ; mv $i $/home/destinationfolder; done"

2008-08-15T01:52:00.000Z	matlab	ikonia	could you please expand I bit? I am lost. Thanks...
2008-08-15T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	matlab	for i in `ls | grep -v ignore_dir | grep -v ignore_dir2` ; do mv $i /home/test/new/dir/$i ; done
