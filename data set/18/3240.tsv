2010-05-03T22:24:00.000Z	Nemurenai		Help - my hard drive is sloooow after installing Lucid - It's a 7200rpm pata drive, and I can't enable dma - I think it's because it's using the new drivers that treats it as a scsi device - what should I do?
2010-05-03T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	those drivers have been used in ubuntu since a lot of releases
2010-05-03T22:25:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	okay. but what can I do?
2010-05-03T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	are you sure the dma is off ?
2010-05-03T22:25:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	yes. hdparm says so. Also, I/O is 16 bit
2010-05-03T22:26:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	I can't do anything because hdparm won't play with scsi devices
2010-05-03T22:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	see if demsg say why they were configured like that
2010-05-03T22:26:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	roger
2010-05-03T22:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	this ---> dmesg | grep -i ata | less
2010-05-03T22:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	anything related ?
2010-05-03T22:30:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	I don't see anything weird...
2010-05-03T22:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	at least you should see [    0.495386] ata5.01: configured for UDMA/133 <<< tha's for my only pata disk
2010-05-03T22:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	something like that
2010-05-03T22:32:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	It says UDMA/100 is enabled
2010-05-03T22:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	then it is ok ?
2010-05-03T22:34:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	I think it's as good as it gets....I think the problem is that it's swapping because of too little ram
2010-05-03T22:34:00.000Z	Nemurenai	erUSUL	thanks - consider the case closed ;)
2010-05-03T22:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Nemurenai	no problem
