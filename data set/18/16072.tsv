2005-03-19T08:25:00.000Z	Amaranth		that blue is ugly
2005-03-19T08:26:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	the one you pasted looks like a blantant mozilla.org ripoff
2005-03-19T08:27:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	you've gotta be kidding me ;)
2005-03-19T08:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	the mozilla site is too cluttered, too
2005-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	tell him to dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg then
2005-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	ha, gtk2
2005-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	heh. haven't seen acroreader 7 have you, you hater!
2005-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	it sure doesn't look like gtk2
2005-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	most of it is
2005-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	the acroread7 phonehome feature is in a seperate package called acroread-plugins
2005-06-17T06:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	If dist-upgrade could figure all that out your computer wouldn't need you to run it. ;)
2005-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	I'd love that
2005-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	Me too, but it isn't possible.
2005-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	let's drop xscreensaver-glx and friends ;)
2005-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	ha
2005-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	eruin	I think if they compress some things with LZMA (7zip) it _might_ fit.
2005-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	eruin	Amaranth	yeah, I noticed that discussion... didn't seem very conclusive on the actual gains though
