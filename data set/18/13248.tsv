2006-06-05T09:10:00.000Z	tRSS		quick question: after I upgraded from breezy to dapper, i am getting this and few more errors when I login to bash: "unknown items QUOTAS_ENAB (notify administrator)". so how can I fix this?
2006-06-05T09:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	look in /etc/logins.def
2006-06-05T09:12:00.000Z	tRSS	thoreauputic	why has the upgrade done to cause this error? i would appreciate your help.
2006-06-05T09:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	you will probably find a debconf file there with the new config ( something like /etc/login.defs.debconf
2006-06-05T09:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	just move that file in place of the old one
2006-06-05T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	you probably answered a config question on it and said to keep your settings
2006-06-05T09:13:00.000Z	tRSS	thoreauputic	and where is the old one?
2006-06-05T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	no, the old one is /etc/login.defs
2006-06-05T09:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	the new one is the one that debconf backed up in case of need
2006-06-05T09:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	try  ls -l /etc/login.def*
2006-06-05T09:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	you should see two files
2006-06-05T09:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	the one with the extra suffix needs to be renamed to /etc/login.defs
2006-06-05T09:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	got it ?
2006-06-05T09:28:00.000Z	tRSS	thoreauputic	thanks, it worked! really appreciate your help
2006-06-05T09:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	no problem - I did the same thing as you on the upgrade - I tried to keep my old config with the result you described
2006-06-05T09:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	evidently the login defs have changed
2006-06-05T09:32:00.000Z	tRSS	thoreauputic	that is interesting, but useful information
2006-06-05T09:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tRSS	usually the default answer is to keep your config but in this case it was a better idea to acept the new one - I should have looked at it more closely I guess :)
