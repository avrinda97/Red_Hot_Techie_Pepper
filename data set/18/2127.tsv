2010-08-13T11:59:00.000Z	the_wench2		the question I asked
2010-08-13T12:00:00.000Z	the_wench2		you said me ok when I said I am giving the corn entry
2010-08-13T12:00:00.000Z	the_wench2		?
2010-08-13T12:00:00.000Z	the_wench2		"hello, in a cron entry can't I use MAILTO along with /dev/null 2>&1 ?"
2010-08-13T12:01:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	redirecting to /dev/null is overthinking it. just use the -q option to wget.
2010-08-13T12:02:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	how would that help ?
2010-08-13T12:03:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	umm, because the point of redirecting to /dev/null is to throw away any output...
2010-08-13T12:04:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	did you read that? too many people speak here so my lines went way abv :P
2010-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	I have no idea what you're trying to do. As far as I can see, you're using wget, which downloads files, except you don't want to download files, and you're redirecting to /dev/null, which throws away output, except you don't want to throw away the output :\
2010-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	that url does some crawling processes and updates the mysql DB
2010-08-13T12:07:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	ah, okay, I see now
2010-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	so ?
2010-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	I'm thinking, one sec
2010-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	no probs,take your time ;)
2010-08-13T12:12:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	"wget --delete-after" will delete any files it creates. "wget -q" stops all output, "wget -nv" shows only basic output, and I don't see anything for "just error output". You could probably do it with shell redirection (which is the >> and > stuff you have in that pastebin), but I'm no good with that, so I wouldn't know how.
2010-08-13T12:15:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	-l --delete-after or just --delete-after ?
2010-08-13T12:18:00.000Z	rww	the_wench2	just --delete-after. I'm not seeing what -l has to do with anything :\
2010-08-13T12:32:00.000Z	the_wench2	rww	any idea?
