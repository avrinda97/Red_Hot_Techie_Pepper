2011-04-20T12:17:00.000Z	zetsu		and relatively easy to install and set up, as I'd be installing it 1-3 times a day
2011-04-20T12:18:00.000Z	zetsu		would there be any better place to ask for that?*
2011-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	zetsu		umm, to put it on older used computers
2011-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	zetsu		1,5ish ghz and up
2011-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	zetsu		256mb ram
2011-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	zetsu		not like, dead ancient but old
2011-04-20T12:20:00.000Z	zetsu		quick-ish to set up, easy to use, pretty light
2011-04-20T12:20:00.000Z	zetsu		for random people
2011-04-20T12:20:00.000Z	zetsu		internetz, basic everyday use
2011-04-20T12:20:00.000Z	zetsu		word process maybe, etc. etc.
2011-04-20T12:21:00.000Z	[deXter]	zetsu	Puppy linux or puppy based distros ould be a good choice
2011-04-20T12:21:00.000Z	[deXter]	zetsu	I would recommend TurboPup.. it uses like 10MB of RAM and runs a modern X.Org server.. you can run all your usual apps and stuff
2011-04-20T12:22:00.000Z	[deXter]	zetsu	In my experience the problem I've had is not with the newbies but with the techies
2011-04-20T12:23:00.000Z	[deXter]	zetsu	because the techies have some obscure windows program/scripts that they're used to and want it to use in Linux.. all the newbies basically use the internet and word
2011-04-20T12:24:00.000Z	[deXter]	zetsu	for the newbies all I do is put aptly named shortcuts "Internet", "Word", "Chat" and they're good to go.
2011-04-20T12:27:00.000Z	[deXter]	zetsu	IIRC the xfce version is just a bit more heavier than the LXDE one..
