2009-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	rob___		Question for anyone who is able to help: I am having trouble starting gnome. I installed dwm but am not ready for it. How do I revert back to gnome from the command line? I don't have a .xinitrc in my home dir. What I need to know is which file runs the command to start dwm, so I can revert it back to gnome
2009-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	rob___	adalal	xfix didn't really do anything - it still goes into dwm unfortunately
2009-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	adalal		how odd
2009-09-06T20:13:00.000Z	adalal		what exactly is happening?
2009-09-06T20:14:00.000Z	adalal	rob___	pm me
