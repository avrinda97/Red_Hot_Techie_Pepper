2011-09-16T01:38:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	Do devices connect to the AP?
2011-09-16T01:39:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	I didn't try 'connect to hidden wireless network' because I don't have a device handy to connect with..
2011-09-16T01:39:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	You could really do with finding out if the AP actually works.
2011-09-16T01:40:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	Yes but I want it to be broadcast first.. I want to find out why it isn't
2011-09-16T01:41:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	I was able to get it to broadcast and connect from a client with hostapd but I'd like the standard way to work
2011-09-16T01:43:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	I can't think what the problem could be I'm afraid.
2011-09-16T01:43:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	What network manager are you using?
2011-09-16T01:43:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	Well I hope it isn't the wifi card or drivers because it seems to do the same in fedora. Creates the ap but does not broadcast
2011-09-16T01:44:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	That sucks.
2011-09-16T01:44:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	I'm using the default network manager in natty
2011-09-16T01:44:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	You could try wicd.
2011-09-16T01:45:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	but IIRC, it was working in fedora a few days ago, at least braodcasting
2011-09-18T00:11:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	The drivers are probably putting the card into a strange state
2011-09-18T00:12:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	Thanks, I'll look into it.
2011-09-18T00:12:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	I wonder if it could be to do with the PC being idle for a long time.
2011-09-18T00:13:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	It's a bug in the driver or kernel. more likely than not, in the driver
2011-10-02T11:48:00.000Z	soreau	benoliver999	Can you repeat it?
2011-10-02T11:48:00.000Z	benoliver999	soreau	Sorry, wrong channel
