2007-10-23T00:57:00.000Z	Trantor		how can I see what is my installed version of ntfs-3g? At the same price... does anyone know which is the ntfs-3g version installed by default in gutsy?
2007-10-23T00:59:00.000Z	Trantor		FN keys in Sony VAIO? Anybody?
2007-10-23T00:59:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	pita
2007-10-23T01:00:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	recent vaio?
2007-10-23T01:00:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	well, not so recent, it's a Pentium M 740... two years maybe, FJ1S
2007-10-23T01:01:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	and sorry... what is 'pita'?
2007-10-23T01:03:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	Pain In The Ass
2007-10-23T01:04:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	so I have no chance to configure FN keys... that's the meaning, not?
2007-10-23T01:11:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	might be worth googling sonylaptop and ubuntu
2007-10-23T01:12:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	yes, that is what I did many times... with no results. There are solutions, but not with my settings (people uses sony-laptop module, but I use sonypi and sonyacpi...)
2007-10-23T01:13:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	Are you trying to config them to lanch applications? Or just to make your screen brightness alterable?
2007-10-23T01:13:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	It would be enough for me being able to set the brightness level and, if possible, sound volume
2007-10-23T01:20:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	you could send it to sleep from the command line maybe
2007-10-23T01:21:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	Ok, but what I want is to avoid it to stop the way it does now. There is a big noise from the 'yet spinning' disk when laptop turns down, I I think it's not healthy for device
2007-10-23T01:22:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	probably it just parking the heads...
2007-10-23T01:23:00.000Z	Trantor	cypher	sorry for my english, maybe I don't express this correctly... In win, it stops spinning when I ask Windows to remove it. In Ubuntu, it never stops, even when I umount it. This is what I mean. And it makes some strange noises when stops suddenly
2007-10-23T01:27:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	that would be too good
2007-10-23T01:27:00.000Z	cypher	Trantor	what Tamale said :)
