2006-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	Dirge		Why can't the GUI have root access?
2006-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	Dirge		That's a temp fix.
2006-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	Dirge		important such as editing files and file transfers?
2006-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	Dirge		Well I want to GIVE permissions.
2006-06-13T11:43:00.000Z	Dirge		For instance, I have a file I want to download, I try yo download then save it, but I can't save it to the external HDD because it's for root only.
2006-06-13T11:43:00.000Z	Dirge		It won't let me log into the GUI as root.
2006-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	Dirge		No thanks.
2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Dirge		Also, it won't let me write anywhere except home.
2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Dirge		Not just the external NTFS HDD.
2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Dirge		Ok, how do I give a user root access?
2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	that's because the system owns /, you don't
2006-06-13T11:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	use sudo in Ubuntu plus your own user pw - there's no need for su by default...
2006-06-13T11:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	why? that's uselessly risky and best avoided...
2006-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	what're you doing that requires so much root access?
2006-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	the Tab key is your friend. /et<tab>X1<tab> will get you /etc/X11 in half the keystrokes...
2006-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	got the Sun Java j2re installed?
2006-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	when you installed Sun Java, did you do the java-reconfigure thing?
2006-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dirge	long URL, but here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Java#head-fef9352fb26820bb774df978180c9dd3a60e777b
