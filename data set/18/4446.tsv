2009-04-09T05:03:00.000Z	IRiX_	Huufarted	ah no using version 8.04
2009-04-09T04:22:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	do you know what wireless chipset it is?
2009-04-09T04:22:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	Atheros, broadcom, or other?
2009-04-09T04:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	the wireless chipset, not the processor
2009-04-09T04:39:00.000Z	IRiX_	Huufarted	i take it that last bit of info i give you dont help
2009-04-09T04:40:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	I apologize, but I didn't see the info.  :(  Please resend?
2009-04-09T04:41:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	I have a potential fix for you.  ath5k drivers worked wonders for me with a similar Atheros chipset.  http://wireless.kernel.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2
2009-04-09T04:42:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	download that file, extract it all, change into the directory and type this:  make && sudo make install && sudo make unload && sudo make load
2009-04-09T04:43:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	it will take awhile to compile them (the first 'make' command)
2009-04-09T04:46:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	then you downloaded it wrong.  :)  From the terminal in Linux:  wget http://wireless.kernel.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2
2009-04-09T04:47:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	ah, gotcha.
2009-04-09T04:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	I'm almost off of work and out of here because of that.  Please see this to help you get the drivers installed fully.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/147299/
2009-04-09T04:50:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	Again, retarded move on my part.  Use this link:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/147300/
2009-04-09T04:55:00.000Z	IRiX_	Huufarted	apparently the kernel is old, have to user the older version
2009-04-09T04:55:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	no worries.  :)  You should find them on http://linuxwireless.org
2009-04-09T04:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	IRiX_	you're not using Intrepid?
2009-04-09T05:00:00.000Z	IRiX_	Huufarted	sorry for asking Intrepid? currently a noob but i hoping thats going to change
2009-04-09T05:16:00.000Z	IRiX_	Huufarted	thanks for the help, hopefully i'l get this sorted, i need to wait to 8.10 to download, only on a 512Kb connection so its going to take a bit of time
