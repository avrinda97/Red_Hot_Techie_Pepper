2008-04-23T07:39:00.000Z	amirman84		jack_sparrow: what kind of stuff?
2008-04-23T07:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	there is a factoid about it..  mostly flash and drivers....
2008-05-18T05:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cp /etc/fstab ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && sudo fdisk -l >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && cat /home/$USER/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt | pastebinit  (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2008-05-18T05:40:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	do i copy and paste that whole thing as one line in the terminal?
2008-05-18T05:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	paste that command without the ( ) at the end .. it will help us halp you
2008-05-18T05:42:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	http://pastebin.com/f6fcb9cf9 you should probably know i already restored my backed up fstab file
2008-05-18T05:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	what was the original question.. sorry if I missed it
2008-05-18T05:45:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	well editing the fstab file seems like it might get messy, ubuntu does a good job of automatically booting the partition with read and write permissions when i click on the partition in my places menu, i was wondering if i could somehow find out what command is being run when i click on it through the places menu so that i could just add that to my sessions menu
2008-05-18T05:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	k.. one sec
2008-05-18T05:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	k..   sudo mkdir /media/sda2-Windows               and make this change to fstab...  with gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2008-05-18T05:50:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	does it matter how many spaces are in between each of the things on the fstab line? also will this give me read/write access?
2008-05-18T05:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	spaces should not count, but cut and paste just to be sure.. and it should do all that you want
2008-05-18T05:52:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	i'm going to try it out, i'll tell you how it goes
2008-05-18T05:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	good luck
2008-05-18T05:52:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	thanks
2008-05-18T05:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	remember sudo nano /etc/fstab if you get locked out
2008-05-18T06:04:00.000Z	amirman84	Jack_Sparrow	i was a little worried that even if this worked i would have this useless link left in my places menu but the link in my places menu goes right to the partition and it looks like everything mounted just fine. thank you very much
2008-05-18T06:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amirman84	I get one right every now and then..  :)
