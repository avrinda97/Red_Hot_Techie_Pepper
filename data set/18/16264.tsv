2004-10-23T09:42:00.000Z	crimsun		it's generally discouraged
2004-10-23T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun		Ubuntu has 'universe', which is Sid packages recompiled for Ubuntu
2004-10-23T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun		but--
2004-10-23T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun		there are notable exceptions
2004-10-23T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun		for instance, Christian Marillat's mplayer repository
2004-10-23T09:44:00.000Z	crimsun		cedega, you mean?
2004-10-23T09:46:00.000Z	dayson	crimsun	so what should I do? I like this distro but I cant install anything and I want to be able to play steam but I cant if winex wont work
2004-10-23T09:47:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	are you trying to compile cedega, or are you trying to install the deb?
2004-10-23T09:54:00.000Z	dayson	crimsun	install the deb
2004-10-23T09:55:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	and which packages is it hitching on?
2004-10-23T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	you need the correct path to the .deb
2004-10-23T10:05:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	well, you have -dev installed.
2005-01-20T14:34:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	would you download a random .exe from a torrent?
2005-01-20T14:35:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	does needing cedega because you want to play games preclude any sense of safety you might have? ;)
2005-01-20T14:36:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	no one can verify that the deb hasn't been created by a malicious user
2005-01-20T14:39:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	you trust a bit too blindly.
2005-01-20T14:41:00.000Z	crimsun	dayson	well, it's your machine and I'm not going to try and prevent you. Just be aware of the pitfalls.
2005-01-20T14:42:00.000Z	dayson	crimsun	thanks for the warning I've lost everything today already so I have nothing to lose other then an hours time
