2007-02-26T15:30:00.000Z	billy		i must've got lost in the shuffle.
2007-02-26T15:32:00.000Z	billy		are GDE and KDE pretty much par for par?
2007-02-26T15:32:00.000Z	billy		KDE seems "prettier" on my LCD.
2007-02-26T15:32:00.000Z	billy		for some reason
2007-02-26T15:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	gnome and kde are quite different. You should use both and see which one you like best.
2007-02-26T15:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	I agree
2007-02-26T15:34:00.000Z	billy	ardchoille	don't you think they have a slightly different "feel" to them though?
2007-02-26T15:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	Oh, I think they entirely different look and feel.
2007-03-05T12:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	:)
2007-03-05T12:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	irssi and bitchx are text mode irc clients. I use irssi
2007-03-15T08:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	You can just remove the word "splash" for the same effect
2007-03-15T08:59:00.000Z	billy	ardchoille	 cool.  learn something new everyday.  :)
2007-04-06T10:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	Did you try to click unmax and then resie the window, and then quit and restart to see if the new size settings kept?
2007-04-06T10:09:00.000Z	billy	ardchoille	yeah.  they never keep over restarts.
2007-04-06T10:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	:(
2010-04-02T11:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	Please don't do that
2010-04-02T11:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	billy	because you're advertising a non-ubuntu channel
2010-04-02T11:48:00.000Z	billy	ardchoille	to clear people with NON-linux related problems
