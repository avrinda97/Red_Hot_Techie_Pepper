2011-01-17T12:09:00.000Z	zetheroo		does MemTest not work on certain systems?
2011-01-17T12:10:00.000Z	zetheroo		I have a HP dv1000 here and MemTest is a no-go ..
2011-01-17T12:11:00.000Z	zetheroo		I just want to run MemTest on this laptop I have here ... but after MemTest loads it seems to just sit there with no menu appearing at the bottom of the screen and the + and - symbols blinking
2011-01-17T12:12:00.000Z	zetheroo		another issue ... I loaded Ubuntu 10.10 on this dv1000 and the Desktop effects don't work ... the gfx are Intel and I am told there is no fix for this ... at least this was the mood on forums etc
2011-01-17T12:14:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	compiz --replace?
2011-01-17T12:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	will that work while using vesa? ... ;)
2011-01-17T12:15:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	well, if i knew there would be no "?"
2011-01-17T12:20:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	I do not think that intel cannot be forced, you may want to test driver solution first, and then mess with metacity (which have compositor too).
2011-01-17T12:20:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	well all I really want to do is load 10.04 now
2011-01-17T12:21:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	if not cd, usb is option.
2011-01-17T12:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	tried USB as well ...  same thing
2011-01-17T12:22:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	alternative? or maybe new image...
2011-01-17T12:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	I have tried about 7 freshly burned DVD's and CD's ... with 3 different ISO's of the same 10.04 release ...
2011-01-17T12:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	I have not tried alternative
2011-01-17T12:23:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	it maybe faster to 9.10 -> 10.04
2011-01-17T12:24:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	however if it don't run off the CD then it will very likely be a headache once it is installed
2011-01-17T12:24:00.000Z	zetheroo	shcherbak	you mean install 9.10 and update to 10.04?
2011-01-17T12:24:00.000Z	shcherbak	zetheroo	yes
