2008-10-14T09:44:00.000Z	james_dean		Anyways, my network is setup like this.   I have a tomato router connecting to the internet, connected to that is my windows pc (gaming) and my linux server is on the router too
2008-10-14T09:46:00.000Z	james_dean		is there a default firewall on hardy server?
2008-10-14T09:46:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	yes... its called iptables, you can use firestarter or ufw to control it
2008-10-14T09:47:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	, just install ufw : sudo apt-get install ufw , then : sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw status.
2008-10-14T09:47:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	to allow traffic on port 80 to enter your machine : sudo ufw allow 80
2008-10-14T09:48:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	take some time to read this page : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=510812
2008-10-14T09:53:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	locate iptables | grep bin
2008-10-14T09:54:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	but as i said...unless you already know how to manipulate iptables with awesome proficiency...you should just stick to ufw
2008-10-14T09:55:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	which leads me to my next point, if your new to networking security then all of this isnt going to be obvious with out some time set aisde to read stuff
2008-10-14T09:56:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	heck *i* dont even know how to manipulate iptables...its a nightmare
2008-10-14T09:56:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	so have a look at installing ufw. sudo apt-get install ufw
2008-10-14T09:57:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	you *should* have iptables as part of the default install....
2008-10-14T09:57:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	this command will tell you if this is true or not : locate iptables | grep bin
2008-10-14T09:58:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	on your hardy run : locate iptables | grep bin
2008-10-14T09:58:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	sudo ufw enable
2008-10-14T09:59:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	now when you want to open a port, say for example , port 9999 you would use : sudo ufw allow 9999
2008-10-14T09:59:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	it will pay to read this page : https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/firewall.html
2008-10-14T10:00:00.000Z	airtonix	james_dean	and this one for general rundown on how security is handled in ubuntu : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=510812
