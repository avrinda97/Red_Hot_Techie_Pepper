2006-11-09T07:36:00.000Z	maria		does anyone know how to change the owner of a folder?
2006-11-09T07:36:00.000Z	maria		to myself from root?
2006-11-09T07:36:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	'sudo chown owner:group foo'
2006-11-09T07:39:00.000Z	maria	Terminus	i did it, and got no error, but the folder still belongs to root?
2006-11-09T07:39:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	what exactly did you type?
2006-11-09T07:40:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	and /media/mydvd is your dvd drive? you'll have to alter fstab for that i think.
2006-11-09T07:41:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	and maria is a valid username? 'try sudo chown maria:maria /media/mydvd'
2006-11-09T07:43:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	what does 'ls -l /media/mydvd' say? sounds more like a permission problem than an ownership problem.
2006-11-09T07:43:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	'ls -l /media' i mean.
2006-11-09T07:43:00.000Z	maria	Terminus	it says its owned by me
2006-11-09T07:44:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	can you paste the line for mydvd?
2006-11-09T07:44:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	'chmod 0755 /media/mydvd'
2006-11-09T07:45:00.000Z	maria	Terminus	hey it worked, i just dont know what i did :) im sure this would of just been easier to mount my dvdrom on my other computer to this one, but im so lost its amazing
2006-11-09T07:46:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	it was a permissions problem. chown changed the owner just fine. =)
2006-11-09T07:46:00.000Z	maria	Terminus	want to help me mount my dvd rom from my windows pc to this one :) ?
2006-11-09T07:53:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	well, that's a bit complicated. =)
2006-11-09T07:53:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	i can't memorize the parameters that i use for mount -t smbfs.
2006-11-09T07:56:00.000Z	Terminus	maria	aptitude install smbfs
