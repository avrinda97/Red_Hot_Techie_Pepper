2011-01-17T02:09:00.000Z	BelkinUSB		hi all, do you think I should be able to run Ubuntu/xubuntu on a portable with a P3 900 Mhz processor, 250 Mb RAM and
2011-01-17T02:10:00.000Z	BelkinUSB		bencahill... yup it looks kinda sloshy now
2011-01-17T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	should be fine, what video card?
2011-01-17T02:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	I'd go with Lubuntu personally but you can install Ubuntu then simply add LXDE ;)
2011-01-17T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	just install lxde  and then log off, click your name, select lxde then enter password and log in
2011-01-17T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	just log off, select LXDE and log in
2011-01-17T02:46:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	ActionParsnip	i did logoff but from the terminal, the gnome desktop is stuck
2011-01-17T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	you select your username first, ten choose the desktop
2011-01-17T02:48:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	ActionParsnip	I can't go back to the Xserver part... the only way I can control the machine is by ctl alt F1 and terminal.. but if i logoff from there it says there are sessions in use and leaves them on
2011-01-17T02:49:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	ActionParsnip	is it ok to reboot or I'll loose stuff by doing so?
2011-01-17T02:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	if you save all work and reboot, sure
2011-01-17T02:50:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	ActionParsnip	nothing really important to save ... as long as the kernel remembers the lxde install I don't need the other stuff
2011-01-17T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	you will need to choose the desktop at the login screen
2011-01-17T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	yikes, Lubuntu slow is pretty bad, could try flwm. Or install puppy as it is super light
2011-01-17T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	different distro, althought it can use Ubuntu repos
2011-01-17T03:05:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	ActionParsnip	well lthat's handy... bencahill. On the other hand Lubuntu does not seem so bad as long as I don't browse the internet....
2011-01-17T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BelkinUSB	You could install arora as browser, its dead light
2011-01-17T03:07:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	ActionParsnip	it's got chromium installed and it performs a little better than firefox.. I'll give arora a try
