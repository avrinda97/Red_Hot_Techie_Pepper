2004-12-20T10:15:00.000Z	arle		Does anyone have an Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 01)?
2004-12-20T10:15:00.000Z	HcE	arle	yes
2004-12-20T10:16:00.000Z	arle	HcE	working...? :-\

2004-12-20T10:16:00.000Z	arle	HcE	wonderful! I wrote to the list minutes ago
2004-12-20T10:16:00.000Z	HcE	arle	I run my own compiled 2.6.8.1 kernel
2004-12-20T10:17:00.000Z	arle	HcE	I see.... What about the default kernel? Were you abel to use the sndcard with it?
2004-12-20T10:17:00.000Z	HcE	arle	Don't know, I always fiddle thing the way I like them
2004-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	arle	HcE	sorry... what's 'fiddle'? :(
2004-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	HcE	arle	but you should be able to get it to work, think I used some standard Intel driver
2004-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	HcE	arle	mess around or something
2004-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	arle	HcE	I have started a thread in the ubuntu-users list just a few minutes ago
2004-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	arle		There I dump my lsmod and lspci
2004-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	HcE	arle	I think I use "Intel i8x0/MX440, SiS 7012; Ali 5455; NForce Audio; AMD768/8111"
2004-12-20T10:20:00.000Z	arle	HcE	How can I change that? I miss Debian's modconf :(
2004-12-20T10:21:00.000Z	HcE	arle	the module is named snd-intel8x0
2004-12-20T10:22:00.000Z	arle	HcE	lsmod shows it at 1st place
