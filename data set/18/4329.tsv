2009-04-26T22:41:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	I'm a fair-weather fan of Ubuntu. I spend 3-4 months exclusively using Windows before I get the urge to try the latest Ubuntu. Started off with a VirtualBox on a remote desktop and now I'm running off an SD card on my laptop.
2009-04-26T22:42:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	i avoid windows whenever i can.
2009-04-26T22:42:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	I'm lazy. I have to use it at work, I do some pretty heavy Excel dev work. I also can't play e.g. Fallout 3 easily unless I install Windows.
2009-04-26T22:43:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	I'd love to go Linux native, but there's always one compelling reason why I just can't manage to do it.
2009-04-26T22:44:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	haven't been able to play games in a while, due to the low-spec gfx on my lappy
2009-04-26T22:44:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	Ah. I have a gaming laptop. Treated myself to it about 18 months ago instead of doing yet another full RAM+MB+GFX upgrade of my desktop machine.
2009-04-26T22:46:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	one of these days, i'm going to have to stop being such a cheap bstrd, i guess
2009-04-26T22:47:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	Don't bother. If you go high-end, you're no longer high-end after 6 months. Plus, whatever you paid for your hardware... you can now get the same (or better) for 20% less.
2009-04-26T22:48:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	yeah, i just need something that can cope with things like Half-Life 2. not such a hardcore gamer, anyway. used to play lots of TFC and NS, but my bandwidth's too low for that, now.
2009-04-26T22:48:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	I paid a silly amount of money but I figured on a 3-year lifespan before I replaced again with a new machine. I'm considering my next upgrade to be a cheap netbook and a decent desktop (quad-core AMD looking like good value for money right now).
2009-04-26T22:49:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	wow, quad.
2009-04-26T22:50:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	Would cost about £650 right now to get the very fastest quad-core AMD (with MB, RAM etc). That will go down by half within the next 18 months (or at least, get a lot cheaper).
2009-04-26T22:51:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	i remember spending a fortune way back, on a K6-2, and then about a couple of years later, my buddy spends much less on a 800MHz Duron :-(  lol
2009-04-26T22:51:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	I realised some years ago that I only did a big upgrade every 2-3 years. Every time I did that, a new technology (new socket, new power supply, new graphics bus) has been released to market. Rendered any incremental upgrades pointless. Might as well limit myself to a 3-year upgrade cycle and replace the whole machine.
2009-04-26T22:52:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	yeah, that sounds sensible.
2009-04-26T22:53:00.000Z	VinylPusher	dayo	I spent £330 on a GeForce 7800GTX some years ago. Fastest card on the market. I felt good... for about 2 months. I can spend £60 now and get a card twice as fast that uses half the power.
2009-04-26T22:53:00.000Z	dayo	VinylPusher	crazy, isn't it? lol
