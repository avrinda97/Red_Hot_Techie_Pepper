2007-10-24T19:55:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		Hi all
2007-10-24T19:56:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		I just updated to gutsy and NOTHING works, I am going crazy after many dependencies
2007-10-24T19:56:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		problems with undefined symbols and dpkg --configure -a quitting
2007-10-24T19:56:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		I don't seem to be able to recover my system
2007-10-24T19:56:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		dpkg --configure -a says there are too many unconfigured packages
2007-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		and quits for that reason
2007-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA		I know but I didn't expect such a great breakage
2007-10-24T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	Le-Chuck_ITA	How did you upgrade?
2007-10-24T19:58:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	Pici	I mean, the update manager crashed
2007-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	Le-Chuck_ITA	Did you use automatix or envy at any point?
2007-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	Pici	no but it's a system which went upgraded from edgy to feisty
2007-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	Pici	I see that cuplrit might be: libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
2007-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	Pici	Le-Chuck_ITA	I dont know what to say, you really shouldnt have that many issues.
2009-05-06T17:41:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	Pici	let's mantain the atmosphere friendly, please.
2009-06-25T23:41:00.000Z	Pici	Le-Chuck_ITA	It should be there
2009-06-25T23:42:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	Pici	so in your opinion is it also "used" by default, that is if an external NTFS is attached the user can directly write to it from the livecd?
2009-06-25T23:43:00.000Z	Pici	Le-Chuck_ITA	You'd probably need to mount it, but it may be visibile under Computer in Nautilus
2009-06-25T23:43:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_ITA	Pici	no it's an external drive so I guess it will just work
