2005-12-27T08:55:00.000Z	daemonic		who here is running the x86 64bit?
2005-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	I was until last friday.
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	what made you stop using it?
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	Lack of support for media
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	hmm, like?
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	video, flash, java
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	hmm, you mean no video?
2005-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	Well, MPEGs played, but couldn't be resized. Not much luck with xvids & oggs.
2005-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	For a server, 64bit is fine. I don't think it's ready yet for day-to-day desktop use.
2005-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	wow that sucks. I just bought this amd 64 and installed ubuntu (only 64bit dist I had around) and was hoping it'd all work.
2005-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	guess I was wrong
2005-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	Well, you can make it work with a 32bit chroot, but that's more hassle than its worth too.
2005-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	Make sure you have /home on a separate partition and upgrading becomes an easy matter.
2005-12-27T09:00:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	yeah. damn, that whole 32bit chroot sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
2005-12-27T09:02:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	don't suppose you know off hand if there's any chance of my nvidia card working in 64?
2005-12-27T09:02:00.000Z	cafuego	daemonic	Yes, they work fine in x64
2005-12-27T09:02:00.000Z	daemonic	cafuego	ahh, good.
