2010-10-16T20:42:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	what problems you having  ?
2010-10-16T20:46:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	very strange adobe flash for linux is normally very good - how did you install flash - did you download it from there site or did you use package manager ?
2010-10-16T20:48:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	can you go into software center under applications and type flash in the search bar for me
2010-10-16T20:49:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	when it comes up look for the one that says 'flash player for mozzila'
2010-10-16T20:50:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	when it comes up look for the one that says 'flash player for mozzila'
2010-10-16T20:52:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	you shouldent need to really if its there, are you using a pc or laptop  ?
2010-10-16T20:54:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	maybee that your laptop is stryggling to cope - is it new or old  ?
2010-10-16T20:57:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	should be ok - you could try taking off adobe flash and installing gnash instead - this is a bit more light weight than adobe flash
2010-10-16T20:57:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	to install it go to software center again remove flash, the search 'gnash' and install this
2010-10-16T20:59:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	this might be your issue
2010-10-16T21:00:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	firefox is probably using the wrong one or trying to use both
2010-10-16T21:02:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	open firefox for me
2010-10-16T21:02:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	then go to 'tools' > 'add ons'
2010-10-16T21:02:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	then click pluggins
2010-10-16T21:03:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	now do you have both adobe flash and gnash i this list  ?
2010-10-16T21:05:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	ok think i see your issue
2010-10-16T21:05:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	go back to software center - uninstall gnash
2010-10-16T21:06:00.000Z	ady01	kira_	then reeboot and them go back to pluggins in firefox - this should then pick up the default 'adobe flash'
