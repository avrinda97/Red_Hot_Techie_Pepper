2010-11-03T16:42:00.000Z	sosaited		How can I check which version of vala I have installed?
2010-11-03T16:42:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 did you try   vala --verson  in terminal?
2010-11-03T16:43:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 rather   vala --version
2010-11-03T16:43:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	vala: error while loading shared libraries: libvala-0.10.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
2010-11-03T16:43:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	But I just compiled 0.10
2010-11-03T16:43:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 ok then open synaptic and hit search and type in  libvala  and install it
2010-11-03T16:46:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	Still the same error :(
2010-11-03T16:46:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 are you compiling this?
2010-11-03T16:47:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 if so  then open synaptic again for libvala but install the   -dev package of it
2010-11-03T16:47:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	I already compiled vala 0.10. I just need to make sure it is compiled because I am getting an error in an autogen.sh
2010-11-03T16:48:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	Installed dev already
2010-11-03T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 right install the  libvala -dev package
2010-11-03T16:48:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	 Installed dev already
2010-11-03T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 or in terminal   sudo apt-get build-dep vala
2010-11-03T16:49:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	 But I didn't get any error when I compiled vala. I just need to make sure it is not conflicting with something from synaptic.
2010-11-16T20:02:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	I've had that happen to me
2010-11-16T20:02:00.000Z	coz_	sosaited	 mm interesting... I will have to deep an eye out fot this
2010-11-16T20:03:00.000Z	sosaited	coz_	I was going to empty the trash anyway, so I didn't think of it as a problem :)
