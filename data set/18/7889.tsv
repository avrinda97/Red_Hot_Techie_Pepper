2007-10-31T12:47:00.000Z	thanius		I started having these problems when I upgraded
2007-10-31T12:48:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	go read what i just said to him
2007-10-31T12:50:00.000Z	macogw		flynsarmy: run "top" in the command line.  is trackerd in there using a lot of CPU?
2007-10-31T12:50:00.000Z	thanius	macogw	Core Duo is the product name of Intel's dualcored CPUs. AMD has a dual core called x2
2007-10-31T12:52:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	right, so it wouldnt be Core 2.  it'd be Turion64 X2 or Athlon64 X2
2007-10-31T12:52:00.000Z	macogw		flynsarmy: ok.  sometimes top shows things different than system monitor does, and ive noticed trackerd can use a LOT of cpu even though it's niced to 19 (which is weird)
2007-10-31T12:53:00.000Z	thanius		Anyways, why is Xorg hogging cpu now again?
2007-10-31T12:53:00.000Z	macogw		flynsarmy: top only shows the top things, and it can show just your user's stuff or everything.  system monitor doesnt show root processes by default, either, i dont think
2007-10-31T12:53:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	desktop effects can do that...
2007-10-31T12:54:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	well, desktop effects with yucky drivers...or even just the yucky drivers
2007-10-31T12:54:00.000Z	thanius	macogw	but it didn't in feisty?
2007-10-31T12:54:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	different driver versions
2007-10-31T12:55:00.000Z	thanius	macogw	can I downgrade then?
2007-10-31T12:56:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	depends on the driver, i think.  if it's ati's binary, not sure how that gets installed outside the distro.  if it's nvidia's binary, compile an older one
2007-10-31T12:56:00.000Z	thanius	macogw	so you can't downgrade from the repo?
2007-10-31T12:58:00.000Z	macogw	thanius	feisty's drivers were compiled against feisty's kernel, not against gutsy's, so they wont work
2007-10-31T12:59:00.000Z	macogw		!ask | redheat
2007-10-31T12:59:00.000Z	thanius	macogw	then I'll just grab the ones from nvidia.com
