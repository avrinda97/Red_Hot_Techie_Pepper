2006-09-15T11:18:00.000Z	Tamale		glxgears is still really choppy, compiz is sluggish, syngery is horrid and is eating all my cpu cycles, nvidia-settings doesn't start properly and this all happens in both the 386 and 686 kernels :[
2006-09-15T11:20:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	I dont know much about sis hw, are you using the right driver for ir?
2006-09-15T11:21:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	 No sis, it's a centrino laptop (banias) with an nvidia FX5200 Go
2006-09-15T11:21:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	using the official nvidia drivers?
2006-09-15T11:22:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	As far as I know.  I just followed the nvidia guide everyone here points people to.
2006-09-15T11:23:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	using the nv or nvidia driver and are the kernel drivers for nvidia stuff?
2006-09-15T11:25:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	I'm using nvidia, not nv
2006-09-15T11:25:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	alright
2006-09-15T11:25:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	I'm not sure about the kernel thing.. that's what I'm thinking might be messed up, but I don't know how to tell.
2006-09-15T11:27:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	did you install linux-restricted-drivers for your kernel?
2006-09-15T11:28:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	nvidia-kernel-common ?
2006-09-15T11:29:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	hrmm damn I dunno then, I havent ever messed with the go cards, try ubuntuforums
2006-09-15T11:29:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	Everything was working fine before I got the 686 kernel too
2006-09-15T11:29:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	is the 386 kernel still installed?
2006-09-15T11:29:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	Yes, but it's sluggish now too.
2006-09-15T11:30:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	And the nvidia-settings program doesn't work in it either
2006-09-15T11:30:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	Tamale	I'm at a loss, mostly because I need some more rest, but check out the ubuntu forums
2006-09-15T11:31:00.000Z	Tamale	Shadowpillar_	Thanks for trying.
