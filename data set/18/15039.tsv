2005-05-14T08:27:00.000Z	tux0010		with the same version of nvidia drivers, this doesn't happen in other distros
2005-05-14T08:27:00.000Z	tux0010		nvidia geforce fx 5600go
2005-05-14T08:29:00.000Z	tux0010		:(
2005-05-14T08:29:00.000Z	tux0010		please can anyone help me?
2005-05-14T08:29:00.000Z	bob2	tux0010	do you have problems with the Free drivers?
2005-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	the nvidia one
2005-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	the strange thing is that i was running arch linux right before this
2005-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	and the exact same drivers worked great
2005-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	bob2	tux0010	no, when you use the normal drivers, do you have problems?
2005-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	could it be because of a different set of refresh rates chosen by ubuntu?
2005-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	i haven't tried it yet
2005-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	should I give it a shot?
2005-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	bob2	tux0010	yes
2005-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	ok brb
2005-05-14T08:34:00.000Z	tux0010	bob2	same problem
