2011-03-27T03:33:00.000Z	Polah		oh
2011-03-27T03:34:00.000Z	Polah		DarkEnvy: You want something for normalisation. I don't know what software there is for that but that's what you want it to do.
2011-03-27T03:35:00.000Z	Polah		DarkEnvy: Not that I am aware of.
2011-03-27T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 still i find its best to unplug the thing from the wall. 'good habbits'
2011-03-27T03:36:00.000Z	Polah	Dr_Willis	Yes, but do the other two things I said as well
2011-03-27T06:04:00.000Z	Polah	Dr_Willis	I'd rather do it cleanly
2011-03-27T06:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 check out /etc/rc.local for a fast and dirty way.
2011-03-27T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 and upstart controlled services are ran from /etc/init/
2011-03-27T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 rc.local is the way to do 'scripts'  services are  where the init.d and init stuff belongs.
2011-03-27T06:05:00.000Z	Polah	Dr_Willis	I need the application to continue running
2011-03-27T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 you are not being very specific. If you want to make a 'service' then yes. you should make a proper /etc/init/whatever.conf to controll your service.
2011-03-27T07:14:00.000Z	Polah	Dr_Willis	Oh, so he can just do grub and not grub2?
2011-03-28T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 what files?
2011-03-28T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 it would depend on how you installed it..
2011-04-01T23:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 ive seen many other people able to IRC but not connect to web sites also..  never have figured how irc works smarter.. or else the irc clients cache the info
2011-05-09T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Polah	 i dont think so.
2011-06-03T23:45:00.000Z	Polah	Dr_Willis	How can it be almost a desktop? It's either an environment and provides as such, or it's a window manager that sits on top of an environment like GNOME. If it managed windows and did some environment stuff it could conflict.
2011-07-14T04:45:00.000Z	Polah	Dr_Willis	GB and Gb are separate things, if your brackets semi-question was actually a question.
