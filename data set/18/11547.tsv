2007-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	Bwaha. I've NEVER seen Debian work worse than Ubuntu.
2007-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	Urthmover		:-)
2007-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	As I said, I'm here only because Ubuntu has better support for some specialized packages I need.
2007-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	Urthmover	ubuntu	is better than windows 95 OSR2
2007-10-27T01:42:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	I'd use Windows 2000, XP or heck ANY windows over default Ubuntu
2007-10-27T01:42:00.000Z	Urthmover		Ubuntu has SCHWINGG
2007-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	I'm installing the very minimal install and then building it up to my preferences - much like I'd do with Debian if I wouldn't have to recompile the kernel for some modules which I can't do.
2007-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	Urthmover		oh don't be a pu$$y  Taza go rebuild a kernel
2007-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	Urthmover		go write some drivers
2007-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	I can't rebuild the kernel on my hardware.
2007-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	Urthmover		it fun
2007-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	Otherwise I would.
2007-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	Urthmover		:-)
2007-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	Urthmover		I learned how to grep the other day
2007-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	Urthmover		lol
2007-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	Urthmover		and threw in some df for good measure
2007-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	Taza	Urthmover	The hardware I'm working is VERY restricted HDD-wise and requires support for encrypted drives.
