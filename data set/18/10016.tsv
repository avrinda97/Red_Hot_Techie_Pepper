2007-01-21T17:24:00.000Z	idea		hello again folks
2007-01-21T17:24:00.000Z	idea		got a couple of minor issues here.. major ones are now fixed.
2007-01-21T17:25:00.000Z	idea		1) when i boot into gnome, i'm seeing the session manager and a number of file browsers every time.. any way to stop these?
2007-01-21T17:25:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	do yoy mean as part of the splash screen?
2007-01-21T17:26:00.000Z	idea	goodgerster	no. splash is disabled.
2007-01-21T17:26:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	hmm, they're being launched when you boot?
2007-01-21T17:27:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	go to sessions and modify your startup programs appropriately
2007-01-21T17:27:00.000Z	idea	goodgerster	yes. normally the session manager and *1* file browser, though last boot it was 4 file browsers.
2007-01-21T17:28:00.000Z	idea	goodgerster	indeed.
2007-01-21T17:29:00.000Z	idea	goodgerster	ok. thanks. i'll have a fiddle and get back if it's not working.
2007-01-21T17:30:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	go on
2007-01-21T17:31:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	did you do anything involving upstart or init?
2007-01-21T17:32:00.000Z	idea	goodgerster	i followed the script the bot recommended in here. so i think no.
2007-01-21T17:35:00.000Z	idea	goodgerster	i'll be back in a sec. just relogging into to test sessions.
2007-01-21T17:35:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	the guide doesn't help a ton
2007-01-21T17:47:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	yeah, you needn't retain the data on the swap disk
2007-01-21T17:48:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	you need to retain the disc itself..
2007-01-21T17:48:00.000Z	goodgerster	idea	the data is not important
