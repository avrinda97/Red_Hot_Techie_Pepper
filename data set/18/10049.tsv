2008-06-22T12:27:00.000Z	Hermes		ok flannel ill check
2008-06-22T12:28:00.000Z	Hermes		that doesnt exist either
2008-06-22T12:30:00.000Z	Hermes		Hey Flannel, .bash_login doesnt exist
2008-06-22T12:31:00.000Z	Hermes		I think I read creating my own .bash_profile would work
2008-06-22T12:32:00.000Z	Hermes		ok flanne;
2008-06-22T12:32:00.000Z	Hermes		flannel
2008-06-22T12:32:00.000Z	Hermes		typo :/
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		So Flannel, I read Invocation, and what is says is that I don't need .bash_profile, .bash_login and .profile?
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		But just one of them?
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	Hermes		It said bash only reads from the first one it finds
2008-06-22T12:34:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	what are you trying to do?
2008-06-22T12:35:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	.bash_profile does not need to exist, if you create one -- bash will use it _only_ when you log on to a system, not otherwise
2008-06-22T12:36:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	if you want to have bash do something everytime you invoke bash, put your commands in ~/.bashrc not ~/.bash_profile
2008-06-22T12:37:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	adding it to profile would not be the best of ideas .. that file is also sourced by other shells like csh, tcsh, zsh .. and the syntax you are using is bash specific
2008-06-22T12:39:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	well, it'll work just as long as you use bash .. but the minute you use another shell, you might run into problems
2008-06-22T12:43:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	create a file if one does not exist - or set times on files if they exist
2008-06-22T12:44:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	it might be possible that you made a typo then and that caused bash to ignore your alias statement
2008-06-22T13:01:00.000Z	unop	Hermes	we did suggest using .bashrc over ~.bash_profile
