2011-06-26T13:29:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh		I have ubuntu 10.04 on my Virtualbox and my OS is the same. I can't change the screen size of my virtual ubuntu!
2011-06-26T13:29:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh		 I went to System >> Preferences >> Monitors
2011-06-26T13:29:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh		but the only option for resulotion is 800*600
2011-06-26T13:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 what version of vbox?
2011-06-26T13:30:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	Virtualbox 4
2011-06-26T13:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 you might need to install the vbox guest addations.. ie not messed with vb4 lately
2011-06-26T13:31:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	but I think it does not work with v4?
2011-06-26T13:33:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	What should I do? there is no way with this version?
2011-06-26T13:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 i havent used vbox4 yet. so  im not sure what may be the issue. Other then installing the proper guest addations in the guest os..  not sure what else to try.
2011-06-26T20:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 clarify what you mean. the term 'boot page' is a little vague
2011-06-26T20:30:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	I'm talking about the page show during ubuntu boot up
2011-06-26T20:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 you mean the ubuntu ....... loading screen?
2011-06-26T20:31:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	yes
2011-06-26T20:31:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	exactly
2011-06-26T20:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 if so thats 'plymouth' there are some plymouth themes.. i just disable plymouth. i find it pointless
2011-06-26T20:33:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	I'm searching for plymouth themes. THNX and I'm sorry because of my english
2011-06-26T20:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	smmsadrnezh	 theres a few in the default repos for  kubuntu and lubuntu i think. but as i said. i dont use them. i think they are pointless
2011-06-26T20:34:00.000Z	smmsadrnezh	dr_willis	I'm redistributing from ubuntu and I shoud change it
