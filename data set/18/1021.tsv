2011-07-01T04:02:00.000Z	hopeandpray		what program was it you suggested? i really don't know what i'm doing.
2011-07-01T04:02:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	'apt-cache search foremost' -> foremost - Forensics application to recover data
2011-07-01T04:03:00.000Z	hopeandpray	BernardV	thanks. i'll try it.
2011-07-01T04:03:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	run like: foremost -t zip -i /dev/vda1
2011-07-01T04:04:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	That will search for "zip" files on interface...
2011-07-01T04:05:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	sudokill has a good point! Best is to boot from a live cd and don't use the drive.. mount it RO
2011-07-01T04:07:00.000Z	hopeandpray	BernardV	i am funning foremost and the terminal says processing: stdin. what does that mean?
2011-07-01T04:07:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	Did you specify -i /path/to/your/drive/in/dev/ ?
2011-07-01T04:09:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	Take the advice KM0201 said... pull out the hdd and go to a friend ;)
2011-07-01T04:09:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	Are you working of that HDD?
2011-07-01T04:10:00.000Z	hopeandpray	BernardV	i don't know what that means.
2011-07-01T04:10:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	Let me rephrase.. Is it you main drive?
2011-07-01T04:11:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	Get another computer, burn a live CD, mount the HDD read only and let the forensic software write all "deleted" bytes to an USB drive or so...
2011-07-01T04:13:00.000Z	hopeandpray	BernardV	ok. I will try it on the desktop.
2011-07-01T04:13:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	But please don't run your computer on a drive which has deleted files (like told before here..). HDD's work like this: If the file is deleted and it needs some space to write it will use that space, so the deleted file will be corrupted and then there is no chance of getting it back. Every command you type in a terminal will write to disk (bash_history, logs, etc..)
2011-07-01T04:14:00.000Z	hopeandpray	BernardV	speaking of our desktop, we re-installed by disk on that coumputer also. it didn't touch our files then, so i'm not sure why it did it to my laptop.
2011-07-01T04:16:00.000Z	hopeandpray	BernardV	escott is right. you didn't have all the info. i really appreciate you trying to help.
2011-07-01T04:19:00.000Z	BernardV	hopeandpray	You have a desktop? If your hdd in your laptop is a sata drive you can connect is easily. And most laptop drives are fixed with 2 small philipsheads..
