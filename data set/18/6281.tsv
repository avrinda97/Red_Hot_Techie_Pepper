2008-06-02T02:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	those icons are in /usr/share/icons/<your-active-icon-theme->/<size>/mimetypes .. haven't found anything easier to do that ..
2008-06-02T02:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	just a sec please, ther's a command to reload the mimetype database, have it somewhere (i think)
2008-06-02T02:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	there's some info at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2953931 that use sudo to get it working, never tested this myself though, a long shot ..
2008-06-02T03:01:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	any luck yet ?
2008-06-02T03:10:00.000Z	scorpionglitch	glitsj16	not yet how do you color your name when its directed at me
2008-06-02T03:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	by putting the persons nickname in your message
2008-06-02T03:12:00.000Z	scorpionglitch	glitsj16	is this one colored
2008-06-02T03:13:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	it is at my end yes
2008-06-02T03:14:00.000Z	scorpionglitch	glitsj16	cool, I've been doing that all along with out knowing, Anyway I haven't found anything that works
2008-06-02T03:15:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	no same here, nothing solid .. looks like they burried those mimetype databases deep and undocumented
2008-06-02T03:16:00.000Z	scorpionglitch	glitsj16	another thing is that my themes are located where the guide said it be
2008-06-02T03:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	can't confirm that, using xubuntu and ubuntustudio myself, so it might be distro-related, it's a guessing game right now it seems
2008-06-02T03:19:00.000Z	scorpionglitch	glitsj16	see you later, i'm going to try and make a svg version of my icon
2008-06-02T03:19:00.000Z	glitsj16	scorpionglitch	bye and thx for the input, gdluck
2008-06-02T03:36:00.000Z	scorpionglitch	glitsj16	I got it to work, but I'm not sure how
