2007-06-13T09:34:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	no, you need a static ip to run a dns server on it. if you have a static ip you can make the dns1 and dns2 point to the same ip.
2007-06-13T09:34:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	ok, so i am better off with CNAME, well i have to configure mail servers after which i will make a CNAME record, thx
2007-06-13T09:35:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	the proper way is make an A entry for yourdomain.foo CNAME for www.yourdomain.foo and add a MX to yourdomain.foo and so on.
2007-06-13T09:36:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	if you want two mailservers you can create another A entry for ie. mail.yourdomain.foo and add a differnt MX.
2007-06-13T09:36:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	what if I wanted the A entry to point to a website in freehostia
2007-06-13T09:37:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	if i understand you correct.. that has nothing to do with the dns anymore. Just point it to the IP of freehostia and they'll have to create a VHOST in the webserver config.
2007-06-13T09:37:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	can i talk to you in pm?
2007-06-13T09:38:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	so that the webserver knows which webpage to serve if someone rquests a webpage on www.yourdomain.foo
2007-06-13T09:38:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	goahead
2007-06-15T08:29:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	torrentflux uses BitTornado.. look it up.
2007-06-15T08:30:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	is torrentflux fast...like can it go to atleast 50kbps...or still bittornado?
2007-06-15T08:31:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	that depends on your connection and a lot of other stuff afaik BitTornado is ok, not good but it works.
2007-06-15T08:32:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	and again torrentflux is just a phpscript it launches BitTornado to do the actual downloading.
2007-06-15T08:32:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	what is a good one for ubunutu-server
2007-06-15T08:32:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	what is a good one for ubuntu-server**
2007-06-15T08:33:00.000Z	DJ-_-	idefixx	really slow, running for 3-5 mins now and going at 7-15kbps
2007-06-15T08:33:00.000Z	idefixx	DJ-_-	i used mldonkey for some time even though the torrent stuff in it is realy crapy but it does ok when it comes to speed.
