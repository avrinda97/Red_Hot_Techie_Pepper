2005-05-22T08:16:00.000Z	sbcl3		i need to reinstally ubuntu
2005-05-22T08:16:00.000Z	sbcl3		does anyone know exactly what the "base system installation" comes with?
2005-05-22T08:17:00.000Z	sbcl3		is it just the linux kernel?
2005-05-22T08:17:00.000Z	sbcl3		(and gnome installation)
2005-05-22T08:19:00.000Z	sbcl3		but I think the regular install is better
2005-05-22T08:19:00.000Z	sbcl3		another question: i can't get internet access when my computer first starts up, therefore, ubuntu spends about two minutes looking for ntp.ubuntulinux.org to set the clock
2005-05-22T08:19:00.000Z	sbcl3		can i disable this?
2005-05-22T08:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	try 'sudo chmod a-x /etc/init.d/ntpdate'
2005-05-22T08:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	at a guess, earthy tones, vaguely african themed
2005-05-22T08:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	*shrug*
2005-05-22T08:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	he's done a custom 1.0.4 install
2005-05-22T08:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	it won't be upgraded. security fixes will be backported
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	well, you can just click on the clock for a simple calendar
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	for more advanced stuff, look at evolution
2005-05-27T15:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	ubuntuguide.org has an example of a "pristine" /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-05-27T15:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	http://ubuntuguide.org/#extrarepositories
2005-05-29T15:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	i would guess there's a latex package for chess symbols
2005-05-29T15:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	sbcl3	googling for 'latex chess package' gives some useful looking pages
