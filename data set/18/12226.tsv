2010-06-07T23:40:00.000Z	caleb_		I have a mac external HD that has a backup file on it.  I can read the backup files by accessing them through gksudo nautilus and browsing to the folder.  It errors saying I do not have permissions when I move them to my /home.  I cannot seem to sudo chown the folders, says its read only.  Any suggestions?
2010-06-07T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	you need write permissions to "move" a file from a device, you need read to copy it from a device
2010-06-07T23:42:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	how do I create those permissions? it says I do not have permissions to read it when I paste it to my /home folder from gksudo nautilus
2010-06-07T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	copy and paste - not cut and paste
2010-06-07T23:43:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	that was from copy and paste
2010-06-07T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	then you either don't have read permissions on the device, or no write permissions on the write device
2010-06-07T23:45:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	ok, how do I create those permissions? the original user account that created/mod'ed the files is gone. the macosx that contained it was reinstalled, replacing the original account and it no longer exists
2010-06-07T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	I'd look at the target device permissions first, what is the target device ?
2010-06-07T23:46:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	any device I can put it on. this is more of restoring files after a system reinstall.  I could place it in my /home for now, but it will eventually go back to her macosx
2010-06-07T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	then look at the write permissons on the device you want to write to
2010-06-07T23:48:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	its my /home folder.  it has the standard user permissions
2010-06-07T23:48:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	so check if you can write to where you want to write to
2010-06-07T23:49:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	I can write to it, but not copy the files from the external to it.  its basically saying that the user "me" cannot read the files that root is transfering from (external)
2010-06-07T23:50:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	I can copy them to my /home/root folder
2010-06-07T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	what ???? you
2010-06-07T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	ok - so what's the problem, they have copied off the external drive, problem solved
2010-06-07T23:50:00.000Z	caleb_	ikonia	I cant read them as "me" only as "root"
2010-06-07T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	caleb_	so change the permissions on them
