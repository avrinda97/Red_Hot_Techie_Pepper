2010-04-23T02:21:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	 if you right click the system clock you can go to preferences
2010-04-23T02:22:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	i have multiple locations set for time, i want to switch one, since i am currently outside my home country

2010-04-23T02:23:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	there's no prioritize button, or "set as default" button :(
2010-04-23T02:23:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	 oh you want set to defaults  ok mmm  hold on
2010-04-23T02:24:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	yes please :)
2010-04-23T02:24:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	 so you want to change the time to where you are located at the moment?
2010-04-23T02:25:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	no i have two locations listed, each have their own time. however, only one of them shows on my panel, i want to switch: instead of location A's time showing, I want to see location B's time
2010-04-23T02:26:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	  mm I am       stumped on this one
2010-04-23T02:27:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	i think the functionality doesn't exist 6__6, but i wouldn't be surprised if the value is stored somewhere in gconf...
2010-04-23T02:27:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	  mm you may be correct ...let me look in gconf hold on
2010-04-23T02:28:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	  if you go to   gconf   /apps/panel/applets/clock_screen0
2010-04-23T02:29:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	 maybe there are settings there
2010-04-23T02:29:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	yeah i'm looking, played around with that entry, changed from "false" to "true" and vice versa, but it didnt work xD
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	do you think it'll work if i restart x? usually gnome settings are instantaneous...
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	 that was going to be my next suggestion  at least for testing those settings
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	taofd	coz_	mm yeah, ill finish what i'm doing and restart x... i'll let you know how that goes xD
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	coz_	taofd	cool
