2012-08-05T08:08:00.000Z	Odra		Hello
2012-08-05T08:08:00.000Z	Odra		How do I upgrade ubuntu?
2012-08-05T08:08:00.000Z	Odra		Lucid
2012-08-05T08:09:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Do you want to change the release to 12.04, or simply upgrade your software packages?
2012-08-05T08:11:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Open "software-properties-gtk" or "software-properties-kde" as root. Go to "Updates", find the release train setting (can't remember the actual name), set it to "Long-term support releases only". Apply. Run "update-manager -d"
2012-08-05T08:12:00.000Z	Odra	theadmin	It worked :O
2012-10-06T00:10:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Most of the time the process is, um, ./configure && make && sudo make install
2012-10-06T00:10:00.000Z	Odra	theadmin	I never reached the make part.
2012-10-06T00:10:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Okay, what does the configure script complain about?
2012-10-06T00:22:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	What are you trying to compile anyway?
2012-10-06T00:40:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Would you please tell what you're trying to compile? There may be prebuilt Ubuntu packages. Search for "application name ppa" on Google
2012-10-06T00:40:00.000Z	Odra	theadmin	Poedit. A po file editor. For translating GNU i18n gettext etc
2012-10-06T00:41:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Okay, sec
2012-10-06T00:41:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Which version are you trying to find?
2012-10-06T00:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	That's in the repos, so run "sudo apt-get build-dep poedit" before compiling, that will fish out the dependencies
2012-10-06T00:43:00.000Z	Odra	theadmin	Like I said it doesn't work D:<
2012-10-06T00:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	Oh >.< Sorry, wasn't really listening, the channel is being too active
2012-10-06T00:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Odra	sudo apt-get install libboost-dev?
