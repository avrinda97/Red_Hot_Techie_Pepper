2011-10-14T18:14:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	oh actually that is for video
2011-10-14T18:15:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	try shutter if you want a dedicated app
2011-10-14T18:16:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	why?
2011-10-14T18:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight	MikeChelen	coz I share screen shots all day
2011-10-14T18:17:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	why using copy+paste?
2011-10-14T18:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	MikeChelen	to share
2011-10-14T18:18:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	how are you sharing them that requires copy+paste? why saving the file to desktop not working
2011-10-14T18:19:00.000Z	livingdaylight	MikeChelen	sving to desktop just to then upload is time-consuming. Plus people prefer having a link they can opoen
2011-10-14T18:20:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	oh ok, you could try pointing the default save directory to a dropbox/ubuntuone public directory and then sharing that link directly
2011-10-14T18:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight	MikeChelen	too slow
2011-10-14T18:21:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	are you pasting the pic into the im or sending a link in the im?
2011-10-14T18:22:00.000Z	MikeChelen	livingdaylight	it would be the same number of clicks then. in each case you press some button for screenshot, then copy+paste a link
2011-10-14T18:22:00.000Z	livingdaylight	MikeChelen	no
