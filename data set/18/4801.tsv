2009-06-18T11:33:00.000Z	rashed2020_		Does it matter what distro a binary is made for?
2009-06-18T11:33:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	yes, it matters a lot usually...
2009-06-18T11:34:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	I'm getting a file not found when I try running the .bin file. Is that the error I'm supposed to be getting?
2009-06-18T11:35:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	back up a bit. What .bin file are you trying to "run", and where did you get it?
2009-06-18T11:37:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	RealNetworks Helix Media Server. It says it's for RHEL, figured I'd try it on Ubuntu instead of downloading CentOS
2009-06-18T11:38:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	brave of you. I'd be surprised it if works. So the .bin file is supposed to be one of those self-extracting install scripts?
2009-06-18T11:39:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	Yep. That's exactly what is.
2009-06-18T11:39:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	try making it executable e.g. chmod +x file.bin then run it ./file.bin
2009-06-18T11:41:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	Tried that. No use. I'm surprised it says file not found. I'm on a 32bit system, so installing ia32-libs isn't the solution to this either :/
2009-06-18T11:42:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	run 'file file.bin' and see what kind of file 'file' thinks it is, if you see what I mean...
2009-06-18T11:44:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	rs1201-ga-linux-rhel5.bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, not stripped
2009-06-18T11:46:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	Hm. I thought it would be a shell script but it's not. There may be no way to force it to execute on your system. Does ldd rs1201-ga-linux-rhel5.bin even find the libraries?
2009-06-18T11:47:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	/usr/bin/ldd: line 117: ./rs1201-ga-linux-rhel5.bin: No such file or directory
2009-06-18T11:47:00.000Z	rashed2020_		I don't know if it's talking about the libraries or the actual file
2009-06-18T11:47:00.000Z	losher		rashed2020_; either way it's bad news....
2009-06-18T11:50:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	Sorry I disconnected by mistake. I asked if it was time to install CentOS.
2009-06-18T11:51:00.000Z	losher	rashed2020_	well that's the one thing that's pretty much guaranteed to work....
2009-06-18T11:51:00.000Z	rashed2020_	losher	Alright. Thanks for all the help!
