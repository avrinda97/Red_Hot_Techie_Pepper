2010-07-28T01:08:00.000Z	b0ot		------ When I plug in some devices via USB nothing happens... is this normal? I thought it would at least say IDK what that is or something. Part 2: How do I find drivers for usb stuff?
2010-07-28T01:08:00.000Z	coz_	b0ot	  it should indeed auto mount for you
2010-07-28T01:09:00.000Z	coz_	b0ot	 what is the usb device ?
2010-07-28T01:11:00.000Z	b0ot	coz_	it would be considered a composite device
2010-07-28T01:11:00.000Z	b0ot	coz_	it connects via usb, but it will actually be doing IP over usb
2010-07-28T01:13:00.000Z	b0ot	coz_	yeah I connected both a logitech webcam, and this other usb device and got no notification from ubuntu 10.04 that anything had been connected
2010-07-28T01:14:00.000Z	coz_	b0ot	  mm  well the web cam wont show up without webcam software like  comorama  or cheese
2010-07-28T01:14:00.000Z	b0ot	coz_	ok, if the webcam won't show up than the other device definitively wouldn't
2011-03-15T16:37:00.000Z	b0ot	coz_	do you know of anyway that might work to start a script @boot with root access when the script fails with crontab, rc.local, and linking it to init.d (it runs but segfaults when it gets to a program) but runs fine when I wait until ubuntu boots and run it in the terminal? I have also tried to manually set the $PATH and $TERM in the script without sucess.
2011-03-15T16:38:00.000Z	coz_	b0ot	 the person here I would trust with script is soreau ,,:)
