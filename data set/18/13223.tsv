2006-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	t35t0r	Tarantulafudge	not true
2006-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	very true
2006-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	I've followed it closely

2006-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	not my fault your using a kernel the drivers haven't been updated for yet
2006-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	did you reinstall the ati-drivers when you updated your kernel?
2006-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	t35t0r	Tarantulafudge	i know how to install the drivers ...
2006-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	t35t0r	Tarantulafudge	that's not the problem
2006-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	it can be
2006-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	t35t0r		yes it can be the problem but in this case it's not
2006-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	also, I found the drivers much more stable if you use the kernel's agpgart and set  Option "UseInternalAGPGART"         "no"

2006-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	t35t0r	Tarantulafudge	adequate means working openglsl
2006-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	I fixed it with the thing I just showed you
2006-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	t35t0r	I used to have that problem
