2006-04-30T15:02:00.000Z	tiggy|lappy	Frogzoo	depends which repos.  There's a special wine repo in the sources-list-generator
2006-04-30T15:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	yes, the sourceforge repo
2006-04-30T15:04:00.000Z	tiggy|lappy	Frogzoo	no need to build it, there's a wine repo listed in the sources.list generator
2006-04-30T15:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	you need to build it to run WoW- :( WoW needs a patch
2006-04-30T15:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	have you tried 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'   ?
2006-04-30T15:06:00.000Z	tiggy|lappy	Frogzoo	that wouldn't help.  KDM works
2006-04-30T15:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	did gnome ever work?
2006-04-30T15:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	I'm thinking move  .gnome -> .gnome.x ; .gnome2 -> .gnome2.x; .gnome_private -> .gnome_private.x ; .gnome2_private -> .gnome2_private.x & retry
2006-04-30T15:08:00.000Z	tiggy|lappy	Frogzoo	I'm not using gnome
2006-04-30T15:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	same applies for .gconf & .gconf.d
2006-04-30T15:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	oh, you mean kde crashes?
2006-04-30T15:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	same deal, try to move aside your kde settings
2006-04-30T15:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tiggy|lappy	ooh, that's not good
