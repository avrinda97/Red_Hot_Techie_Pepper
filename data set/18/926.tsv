2011-07-29T16:51:00.000Z	chrisg4u		can anyone help me figure out why thunderbird keeps crashing?
2011-07-29T16:52:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	have you tried to run it from terminal to get an output?
2011-07-29T16:54:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	Still crashes even ran from terminal :\
2011-07-29T16:54:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	what does the program return? output?
2011-07-29T16:55:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	I get nothing on the terminal just killed
2011-07-29T16:55:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	a good way to fix that is allways just using another email client ;)
2011-07-29T16:56:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	what is the next best thing as I don't like using evolution as I use 3 different mail accounts for different purposes and it merges them together
2011-07-29T16:57:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	or you could try to install a newer version of thunderbird, latest in natty is 3.1.11
2011-07-29T16:59:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	That is the version I am currently using.
2011-07-29T16:59:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	you can try the thunderbird stable channel "ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-stable", their latest version is 5.0
2011-07-29T17:01:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	Where would i type that, sorry, am new to all this :)
2011-07-29T17:03:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	add the line "ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-stable" in the software-sources dialog, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Adding%20Ubuntu%20Software%20Repositories after that just update all packages
2011-07-29T17:04:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	Thanks.
2011-07-29T17:12:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	All packages updated, is that all?
2011-07-29T17:12:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	close all instances of thunderbird, start it again and look in the info dialog if version is now 5.0
2011-07-29T17:14:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	Now using 5.0 will see if problem is resolved
2011-07-29T17:16:00.000Z	chrisg4u	Incarus6	still crashes, I dunno what to try to not make it crash :(
2011-07-29T17:17:00.000Z	Incarus6	chrisg4u	is it crashing while you're trying to read an e-mail?
