2007-01-03T14:36:00.000Z	adaptr		[lynx] _: no, that's pretty much state of the art
2007-01-03T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	why are you using svn when you have no idea what your doing ?
2007-01-03T14:38:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	how do you know *what* I am doing ? thanks for nothing
2007-01-03T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	because your asking how you update it ?
2007-01-03T14:39:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	read some context in the future.. it might save us all some time
2007-01-03T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	pardon ?
2007-01-03T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	I thought it was you who said "how do I update beryl"
2007-01-03T14:41:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	and I know it was not.. that's what that screen-thingy in front of you is for...
2007-01-03T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	there is that much random chatter in this channel - I linked your name to the question. I apologise
2007-01-03T14:41:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	no problem, I'm over it :)
2007-01-03T14:41:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	agree about the noise, though
2007-01-07T17:55:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	he would so its in the same work group  / domain
2007-01-10T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	nope
2007-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	edgy only has "generic", which is supposed to work for everything i686 and K7
2007-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	rats, I thought there was a few packages
2007-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	adaptr	ikonia	none, AFAIK - you're left to your own kernel builds with Edgy
2007-05-19T13:27:00.000Z	ikonia	adaptr	much to my annoyance
