2011-06-02T12:44:00.000Z	d3vlin		Howdy, Xorg spits out error messages that it can't load NVIDIA module (http://paste.ubuntu.com/616475/), however it is loaded and X starts (http://paste.ubuntu.com/616476/)
2011-06-02T12:44:00.000Z	d3vlin		I wonder what's going on
2011-06-02T12:46:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	X seems to trigger the module being loadd, then realizes it it not working, and stops using it. check what dmesg says.
2011-06-02T12:58:00.000Z	d3vlin	tomreyn	here's everything nvidia related from dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu.com/616482/
2011-06-02T13:08:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	the module is being loaded several seconds before X starts and realizes that it "Failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel module"
2011-06-02T13:08:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	anything related in /var/log/kern.log ?
2011-06-02T13:12:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	which ubuntu version are you on and what's the output f this command, when run in a terminal? lspci -knnv | fgrep -B1 -A10 VGA
2011-06-02T13:36:00.000Z	d3vlin	tomreyn	I am running Natty 11.04 x64, here's the output of your lspci query: http://paste.ubuntu.com/616503/
2011-06-02T14:00:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	sorry I got sidetracked there. have you tried noveau?
2011-06-02T14:01:00.000Z	d3vlin	tomreyn	nvidia-current actually works fine for me, it's just that these complaints show up in xorg log
2011-06-02T14:01:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	oh i didn't get this, i assumed it just falls back to vesa.
2011-06-02T14:02:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	just because the kernel loaded the module does not mean that X is using it
2011-06-02T14:03:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	my bet is it is using nouveau as a fallback.
2011-06-02T14:03:00.000Z	d3vlin	tomreyn	here's the full xorg log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/616521/
2011-06-02T14:06:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	why are you using "nomodeset"?
2011-06-02T14:07:00.000Z	d3vlin	tomreyn	nothing specific
2011-06-02T14:08:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	does the nvidia module work in this configuration at all?
2011-06-02T14:10:00.000Z	tomreyn	d3vlin	i see, then i really don't know. maybe the Xorg log file you uploaded is an old one, since this clearly looks like a failed X startup
