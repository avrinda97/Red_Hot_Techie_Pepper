2009-10-28T10:19:00.000Z	nahem		File not found, now I'm really frustrated
2009-10-28T10:21:00.000Z	nahem		I don't know how I lost it, I was trying to do a command in terminal when it said Fork: resources temporarily unavailable, I then checked google and was directed to tasks.h
2009-10-28T10:21:00.000Z	nahem		The file isn't on my computer anymore
2009-10-28T10:22:00.000Z	nahem		I just did a full search, nothing
2009-10-28T10:22:00.000Z	maco	nahem	tasks.h? that sounds like a bit of the kernel. youd only have it installed to compile against or for development
2009-10-28T10:22:00.000Z	maco	nahem	i mean, youd only have it as a .h file for development reasons
2009-10-28T10:22:00.000Z	maco	nahem	just because its what generates the error doesnt mean you need to read the source code. what was the original error that lead you to look it up?
2009-10-28T10:24:00.000Z	maco	nahem	out of memory or PIDs?
2009-10-28T10:25:00.000Z	maco	nahem	what is the path its claiming it should be? if its under /usr/src, NO it does not need to be there
2009-10-28T10:26:00.000Z	maco	nahem	i *guarantee* your server is not parsing a header file real-time
2009-10-28T10:26:00.000Z	maco	nahem	header files are only for during compile
2009-10-28T10:27:00.000Z	maco	nahem	gimme that link?
2009-10-28T10:27:00.000Z	maco	nahem	yes please
2009-10-28T10:27:00.000Z	maco	nahem	because anyone who says its better to modify teh kernel than to fix your own code...
2009-10-28T10:28:00.000Z	maco	nahem	yeah uh dont do that
2009-10-28T10:28:00.000Z	maco	nahem	that is telling you to modify the kernel and recompile your kernel
2009-10-28T10:28:00.000Z	maco	nahem	and no that file is not normally there on a base system
2009-10-28T10:30:00.000Z	maco	nahem	did you write it or get it somewhere?
