2012-05-09T15:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	hays	ok, now just run the "sudo do-release-upgrade" one :)
2012-05-09T15:28:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	how do I update ubuntu from the commandline, I guess I should say
2012-05-09T15:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	hays	oh, sorry, i thought that link had cli instructions
2012-05-09T15:30:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	do I just use apt-get?
2012-05-09T15:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	hays	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades#Server_.2BAC8_Command_line_Upgrade
2012-05-09T15:32:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	hmm i don't appear to hav aptitude
2012-05-09T15:33:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	hays	then use "sudo apt-get install update-manager-core"
2012-05-09T15:34:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	hmm still nothing
2012-05-09T15:34:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	screwit, I will just go over to my desktop i guess
2012-05-09T15:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	hays	please define "nothing"
2012-05-09T15:35:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	I installed that software (update-manager-core) which was already installed and still no aptitude
2012-05-09T15:36:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	maybe its some weird difference since this started out as kubuntu or something
2012-05-09T15:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	hays	I had you use apt-get *instead* of aptitude

2012-05-09T15:40:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	based on google, I think I just use apt-get updgrade

2012-05-09T15:52:00.000Z	hays	DarwinSurvivor	12.04. I just used apt-get update/upgrade
