2007-05-29T05:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		ok, I rebooted to the previous kernel.. will ubuntu always reboot to this kernel in the future or do I have to choose each time from grub
2007-05-29T05:52:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	you have to tell grub to boot the older one
2007-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	each time???
2007-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	no, calm down, extra question marks don't make a difference
2007-05-29T05:54:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	who feckin cares about question marks... get a life
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	I do, I find them annoying, and when I have to erase the answer I was giving you to tell you this, I thought you would care
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	open a terminal, and type "sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"  you have three options, you can remove the options for the new kernel from there, or move the kernel you want to use to the top, or change the default to be the older kernel
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	either help me or clear off :D
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	I was helping you, you need to calm down
2007-05-29T05:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	lack of sleep and a bad temper definitely gonna cause me to loose friends fast
2007-05-29T05:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	this will cause no harm
2007-05-29T05:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	if I put # in front of the kernels that I dont want to boot will that be as good as deleting the entries
2007-05-29T05:59:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	yes
2007-05-29T06:00:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	so If a fix arises in the future for my probs with the .16 kernel it should be simple to get back in to it
2007-05-29T06:01:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	I don't think it will be a fix, just a newer kernel would have it, the drivers are part of the kernel, that is why there isn't a roll-back, the newer kernel might have a newer version of the driver that is better for your sound
2007-05-29T06:02:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	oh, I see.  Is there a release schedule for kernels or are they just released whenever
2007-05-29T06:03:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Paddy_EIRE	I think there is a schedule, but I'm not sure, I don't think that ubuntu releases them right away, I think they test it a bit first
2007-08-28T06:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bobbob1016	not sure it does them sequentially or altogether
