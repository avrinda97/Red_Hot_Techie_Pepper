2005-04-25T12:43:00.000Z	omeg		<Burgundavia> omeg, Synaptic Package Manger <-- I've found Applications --> Accessories --> Package Manager, but not a "Synaptic Package Manager". There's a whole bunch of files in the one I have, and I can't really find Mozilla. :p
2005-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	omeg		Sorry, nevermind, I just found it in Computer --> System Configuration.
2005-04-25T12:45:00.000Z	omeg		I just installed Mozilla. That was the easiest installation ever.
2005-04-25T12:46:00.000Z	omeg		:)
2005-04-25T12:46:00.000Z	omeg		Great system.
2005-04-25T12:47:00.000Z	omeg		I guess that leaves me with just one problem. The resolution of 1920x1200 seems unsupported. I edited my XF86Config-4 file, and added the "1920x1200" resolution to every single mode, but it still won't show up even after a cold reboot.
2005-04-25T12:47:00.000Z	omeg		Thanks, SpaceNuts.
2005-04-25T12:48:00.000Z	omeg		Thanks.
2005-04-25T12:49:00.000Z	omeg		/etc/xorg.org is a "new file".
2005-04-25T12:49:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	either your monitor settings don't allow for such high a resolution, in which case you should fix them, or there's no builtin mode for that (I'm not sure), in which case google for modeline 1920x1200.
2005-04-25T12:49:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	oh yeah, that; it's /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-25T12:50:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	still using warty, then?
2005-04-25T12:54:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	there's also instructions at http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryHedgehog
2005-04-25T14:52:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	I'm still skeptical that it's a vesa mode
2005-04-25T14:55:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	I'd recommend first upgrading to hoary and seeing if the ati driver works there
2005-04-25T14:56:00.000Z	omeg	mjr	can I upgrade to Hoary in Warty itself?
2005-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	I gave you the url to upgrade instructions earlier
2005-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	mjr	omeg	to repeat, see the relevant links at http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryHedgehog
