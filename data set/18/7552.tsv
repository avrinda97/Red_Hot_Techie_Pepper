2008-06-20T02:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Storrgie	The Suspend/Hibernate function stopped working. The problem was due to the new SLUB allocator incorporated in 2.6.22 / 2.6.23 Kernel. The problem has been solved in the AMD Catalyst 7.12 driver release. Suspend/hibernate is not working for FireGL 5250.
