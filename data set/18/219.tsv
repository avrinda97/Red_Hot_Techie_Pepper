2012-06-18T17:04:00.000Z	danawar2	baazigar	Sorry thought you were guy looking for his USB stick lol

2012-06-18T17:05:00.000Z	danawar2	baazigar	you dont want to use a tool like http://www.speedtest.net/ ?
2012-06-18T17:06:00.000Z	baazigar	danawar2	: i want real time speed
2012-06-18T17:07:00.000Z	danawar2	baazigar	From your local machine if you see traffic your going to get a false indication unless your transferring alot of data
2012-06-18T17:08:00.000Z	danawar2	baazigar	Such traffic would be like information going through your internal network not externaly eg your interner
2012-06-18T17:09:00.000Z	baazigar	danawar2	: actually i am sharing wireless internet with someone , and if speed is less, i am not sure if it is because of my downloads or the other person is also using the net
2012-06-18T17:11:00.000Z	danawar2	baazigar	i think programs like ntop will help you there as they will show you on a graph the network usage on each connection/device
2012-06-18T17:11:00.000Z	danawar2	baazigar	not sure about a tool that can stop him from downloading you could block the ports he is downloading on or somthing need to do a quick reset i will be right bcak!
