2005-09-27T15:33:00.000Z	jroes	Seveas	are there mirrors?
2005-09-27T15:33:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	i hope not...
2005-10-06T11:55:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	because your cable is broken, router is malfunctioning, network connection is dead...
2005-10-06T11:56:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	details about your network setup and config will help...
2005-10-06T11:57:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	ok, put the output of ifconfig and iwconfig and sudo iwlist scan on the pastebin
2005-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	if you have a connection now, put your /etc/network/interfaces on the pastebin, it probably has an error
2005-10-06T12:01:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	your dhcp server is broken if it does not assign a gateway...

2006-02-24T15:56:00.000Z	jroes	Seveas	oh, I didn't see that in my apt-cache search, and I have multiverse
2006-02-24T15:58:00.000Z	jroes	Seveas	you sure it's gstreamer0.10-mad?  It doesn't look like it's finding it :X
2006-02-24T15:58:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	looks like I was wrong ;/
2006-02-24T15:58:00.000Z	jroes	Seveas	doh :)
2006-02-24T16:02:00.000Z	jroes	Seveas	fyi - asked them in MOTU, turns out they are separated into good, bad, and ugly.  gstreamer-ugly is the proper one gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
2006-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	Seveas	jroes	packages flex and bison
