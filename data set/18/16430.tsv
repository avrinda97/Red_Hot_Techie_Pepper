2010-05-30T10:49:00.000Z	erick_alcala		ok . uhm is there flashlib for flash10?
2010-05-30T10:51:00.000Z	erick_alcala		but I have flash installed, problem I have is flash plays SLOW!! :S
2010-05-30T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erick_alcala	 blame adobe for the most part.
2010-05-30T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erick_alcala	 there are some newer beta/flash versions. but those may or may not play at all
2010-05-30T10:53:00.000Z	erick_alcala		I dont need who to blame lol , I just need to play flash videos or swfs faster
2010-05-30T10:53:00.000Z	erick_alcala		it lags
2010-05-30T10:53:00.000Z	erick_alcala		it looks like a slideshow
2010-05-30T10:53:00.000Z	erick_alcala		a video!! :O
2010-05-30T10:54:00.000Z	erick_alcala		Intel
2010-05-30T10:54:00.000Z	erick_alcala		I have a emachines T3604 with Ubuntu 10.04  and adobe flash plugin version 10 installed
2010-05-30T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erick_alcala	 theres only so much suggestions we can offer.  Ive noticed sluggish videos on very high end box's and ive noticed it worked good on lower end machines.
2010-05-30T10:55:00.000Z	erick_alcala		on any browser same problem
2010-05-30T10:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erick_alcala	 You could alwyas use some flash-downloader program and download/convert the flash to a better format.
2010-05-30T10:55:00.000Z	erick_alcala		Dr_Wills for videos over an hour not such a good idea =S
2010-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	erick_alcala	peacetara	I assume yes
2010-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erick_alcala	 done it befor.,. If they are not playable now.. then you do it or do without i guess.  You COULD try the latest beta of flash that might help.
2010-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	erick_alcala		yeah?
2010-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erick_alcala	 the latest beta of flash may also not work at all. :)
