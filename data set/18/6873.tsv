2008-03-11T02:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	not really  but you can clone your install
2008-03-11T02:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	YOu may want to consider having a second partition for /home
2008-03-15T22:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	You can try saving your /home folder to a usb or buring it...  but the next time you are editing partitions.. create a seperate /home partition
2008-03-15T22:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	Create seperate home and reinstalling isnt an issue.. it doesnt work quiet the same as windows.. just better
2008-03-15T22:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	See the link on creating a list of all installed packages..
2008-03-15T22:14:00.000Z	micadeyeye	Jack_Sparrow	where is the like?
2008-03-15T22:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	that is cli mode single user root access.
2008-03-15T22:14:00.000Z	micadeyeye	Jack_Sparrow	where is the link?
2008-03-15T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	We strongly advise new users to not do things as root user for a reason..  type man chown in a term for info
2008-03-15T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	all the tools are there.  You just need to learn them.
2008-03-15T22:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	micadeyeye	 you can try this.. depending on how bad everything is it may work  http://linuxfud.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/how-to-reset-ubuntugnome-settings-to-defaults-without-re-installing/
