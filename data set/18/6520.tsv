2010-03-15T23:53:00.000Z	FrozenFire		I just added an ATI Radeon x300 PCI-e graphics card to my system. Can someone point me to the documentation on how to get it going? Searching Google didn't produce.
2010-03-15T23:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	it should just work (tm)
2010-03-15T23:55:00.000Z	FrozenFire	erUSUL	Specifically, I'm looking to use the card's S-Video out to my TV
2010-03-15T23:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	System>Pereferences>screen resolution does not work ?
2010-03-15T23:56:00.000Z	FrozenFire	erUSUL	I assume you mean Display. I'm on 9.10. Nothing shows but my primary onboard graphics.
2010-03-15T23:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	ok try with grandr
2010-03-15T23:57:00.000Z	FrozenFire	erUSUL	I tried xrandr --auto, but it didn't show anything. I'll try grandr, but I am fairly familiar with the CLI, if that's more efficient.

2010-03-15T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	see this wiki it has the xrandr incantations to S-Video
2010-03-15T23:59:00.000Z	FrozenFire	erUSUL	Would I need to install the proprietary driver for radeon?
2010-03-16T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	no; that is not possible for a X300 afaik
2010-08-24T01:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	checked the logs around the time transmission dies ?

2010-08-24T01:52:00.000Z	FrozenFire	erUSUL	switch10_, I'll try checking both. Have to restart my system to get the process to die. Thanks.
2011-01-16T23:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	can you boot a livecd on the machine? to see how the partitions on the disk are; check them if needed etc ...?
2011-01-16T23:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	easy fix depends on what is the problem
2011-01-16T23:54:00.000Z	FrozenFire	erUSUL	Since it's hitting the BusyBox shell, I imagine that the root partition is fine. I'll boot a LiveCD and check each partition, but I think it's probably that some config file got corrupted.
2011-01-16T23:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	FrozenFire	i would help to know what error makes grub or the kernel drop to busybox
