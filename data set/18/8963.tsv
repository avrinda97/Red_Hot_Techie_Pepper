2008-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	ok that worked
2008-12-17T10:11:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	the default is "defaults" and varies based on the filesystem being used
2008-12-17T10:11:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	what does 'defaults' correspond to
2008-12-17T10:11:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	like i just said, it varies based on the filesystem being used
2008-12-17T10:11:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	how do i make it do mount --bind inside /etc/fstab
2008-12-17T10:12:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	try making the filesystem type bind
2008-12-17T10:12:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	no
2008-12-17T10:12:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	bind is rebinding an existing mount to another location
2008-12-17T10:12:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	ok i iwill give it a try
2008-12-17T10:13:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	is this ok /media/Slave/oldhdd /media/OldHDD bind defaults 0 0
2008-12-17T10:13:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	try it and see
2008-12-17T10:15:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	like i already said, try it and see
2008-12-17T10:16:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	that did not work
2008-12-17T10:19:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	specify none as the filesystem, and bind as the option:  /a /b none bind
2008-12-17T10:19:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	ok ill try that
2008-12-17T10:32:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	vlc --fullscreen will start vlc in fullscreen mode
2008-12-17T10:32:00.000Z	Decepticon	fryguy	yes thats true, but my question is how to adapt that so that double clicking a avi file in gnome nautilus will open the file in vlc in fullscreen
2008-12-17T10:33:00.000Z	fryguy	Decepticon	write a wrapper script that runs that command instead of vlc, see if there is an xdefault or rc config that will do it for you
