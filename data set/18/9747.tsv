2007-02-27T14:21:00.000Z	lesshaste		every time I turn my laptop on it starts one more copy of nm-applet. Today I have got up to 5!
2007-02-27T14:21:00.000Z	lesshaste		what can I edit to stop this?
2007-02-27T14:21:00.000Z	lesshaste		which file controls nm-applet loading at startup?
2007-02-27T14:22:00.000Z	marx2k	lesshaste	theres a config in nm-applet for that
2007-02-27T14:22:00.000Z	lesshaste	marx2k	how do I find it?
2007-02-27T14:23:00.000Z	lesshaste	marx2k	I can't see it by clicking on the little icon... is that what you meant?
2007-02-27T14:33:00.000Z	marx2k	lesshaste	'sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude  upgrade'
2007-02-27T14:34:00.000Z	lesshaste	marx2k	what is aptitude?
2007-02-27T15:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	marx2k	no?
2007-02-27T15:20:00.000Z	marx2k	lesshaste	any forum will tell you not to use glxgears to benchmark your vidcard
2007-02-27T15:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	marx2k	sure.. what I meant was that it isn't outputting anything...

2007-02-27T15:24:00.000Z	lesshaste	marx2k	why is that?
