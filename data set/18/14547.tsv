2005-10-17T07:33:00.000Z	wastrel		hello my precious little darlings
2005-10-17T07:35:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	you in the right channel? ;)
2006-02-27T10:25:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	are the dungeons random?  i kept getting stuck with nowhere to go.
2006-02-27T10:25:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 random, but there's always a way through
2006-02-27T10:25:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 search along the walls (s) for secret doors
2006-02-27T10:25:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 #nethack ;] 
2006-02-27T10:26:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	yeah, i remember pressing search at every step though (i just gave up and uninstalled it). :)
2006-03-05T07:42:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 check  settings -> advanced -> url handlers   in xchat
2006-03-05T07:43:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	what should i be looking for?
2006-03-05T07:43:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	!firefox -a firefox -remote 'openURL(%s,new-tab)' lloks right to me...
2006-03-07T08:18:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	never used itunes.  i'm curious.  why can't you play them? what format are they?
2006-03-07T08:18:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 wellsir i don't know- not going to buy unless i know it'll work :] 
2006-03-07T08:19:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 i'm going to google more - the first couple tries didn't turn up anything useful, so i thought someone in here might know
2006-03-07T08:20:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	my guess is either divx avi or .mov.  w32codecs takes care of both
2006-03-07T08:21:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 i believe there's some sort of drm, and it's a new apple video format or so i've heard.
2006-03-13T17:39:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 less filename
2006-03-13T17:39:00.000Z	wastrel	brenner	 or zless
2006-03-13T17:40:00.000Z	brenner	wastrel	cheers
