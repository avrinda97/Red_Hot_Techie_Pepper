2011-04-18T13:10:00.000Z	Sugi		I am having issues maximizing windows/applications on triple monitor setup.  Using Separate X [xinerama] + twinview.  I had it working prefectly with maximizing on dual monitor setup. :S ubuntu 10.10 x64 / nvidia
2011-04-18T13:10:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	complain to nvidia for not supporting xrandr
2011-04-18T13:10:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	you could try nouveau too
2011-04-18T13:13:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	no, it's an open source nvidia driver
2011-04-18T13:21:00.000Z	Sugi	ohsix	hahaha, I just read your comment.  I second that!
2011-04-18T13:37:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	twinview fakes xinerama information so what you're asking should work; twinview is a mess though
2011-04-18T13:38:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	with nouveau and xrandr the monitor applet should work just like you expect, no creating your own xorg.conf
2011-04-18T13:38:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	you really should be talking to nvidia or their forums for information on how to make it work otherwise
2011-04-18T13:39:00.000Z	Sugi	ohsix	Ya, I had it working with my dual-monitor setup perfectly.  In this link, I posted the same problem, but it includes my working xorg or the current non-working xorg. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1732298
2011-04-18T13:48:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	i thought the point of xrandr is to get around the downsides?
2011-04-18T13:49:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	ie. getting rid of xinerama and static configuration
2011-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	Sugi	ohsix	Ok, then what should I go over to, I'm a bit lost and heartbroken to say the less.  This problem is quite problematic
2011-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	shrug,  nvidia won't do xrandr, hope lies in nouveau, try a natty livecd, use the monitor applet
2011-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	Sugi	ohsix	I am really hoping natty will bring some new light to this issue.  This is quite an old issue :SSSSS
2011-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	it's just the nvidia binary driver; only mention natty because xorg-edgers stopped builds for versions older than natty, and it comes with nouveau
2011-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	Sugi	ohsix	Aaa, btw do you have much experience with triple setup in windows envirnoment?  I have heard it's better, but at the same time, ati is winning in surround vision...
2011-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	ohsix	Sugi	it's worse, all you get is a framebuffer
2011-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	Sugi	ohsix	Sigh, that doesn't sound good :SSS
