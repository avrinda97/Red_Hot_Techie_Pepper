2006-05-12T06:06:00.000Z	TiG4		--- When I try the following command with mplayer:    mplayer -dump mms://*****         It returns a "stream not seekable" error.
2006-05-12T06:06:00.000Z	TiG4		Any ideas?
2006-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	TiG4		!wiki mms
2006-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	are you sure it's an error?  I tried it yesterday, saw that message, but it was still dumping.
2006-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	where would it dump
2006-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	in the current directory.  do a "ls -altr" and it's the last file shown
2006-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	i see stream.dump
2006-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	that'll be it I guess
2006-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	is it growing?
2006-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	NICE!
2006-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	thanks
2006-05-12T06:09:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	mplayer will exit when it's finished dumping.  then you can rename the dump file to have the correct extension
2006-05-12T06:09:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	it is a .asf file, do you know of a way to convert to mp3
2006-05-12T06:16:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	mencoder should be able to do that I think
2006-05-12T06:22:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	mencoder says "video stream is mandatory"
2006-05-12T06:22:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	i pass it $mencode stream.dump
2006-05-12T06:23:00.000Z	dooglus	TiG4	I've never tried using mencoder, sorry.
2006-05-12T06:23:00.000Z	TiG4	dooglus	no problem
