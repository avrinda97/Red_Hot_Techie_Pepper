2009-09-17T07:40:00.000Z	systest		ip before = 10.10.10.10,  after = "nothing"  (becuase the DHCP server does NOT give it an address)
2009-09-17T07:41:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	have you disabled the dhcp server on your router?
2009-09-17T07:41:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	no DHCP anywhere other than the one on my server
2009-09-17T07:42:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	linksys router? just login to the default page 192.168.1.1 no user, admin password
2009-09-17T07:43:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	no DHCP servers other than the ubuntu based one I'm running on another box
2009-09-17T07:44:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	ok so one iface gets dhcp address...the other is static?
2009-09-17T07:44:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	y, that's how it's configured on the client side.
2009-09-17T07:45:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	well if the iface is configured to use a static ip...then the dhcp server wont touch it since it wont know to
2009-09-17T07:46:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	k, so that's the problem.  The client is configured to do static on eth1.  It DOES do static on eth1, then 5 minutes later it does DHCP on eth1
2009-09-17T07:46:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	the question is,  WHY does it do DHCP on eth1, it's not configured to and shouldn't be
2009-09-17T07:46:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	/etc/conf.d/net is configured properly?
2009-09-17T07:47:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	there is no  /etc/conf.d on this system, DISTRIB_RELEASE=9.04
2009-09-17T07:47:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	oh...im a gentoo user myself :P
2009-09-17T07:48:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	there must be a simliar file though
2009-09-17T07:48:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	there is, it's /etc/network/interfaces
2009-09-17T07:49:00.000Z	Jyxt	systest	hrm...try adding a line in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-09-17T07:51:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	n8tuser: looks like it's a weird artifact of the DCHP client daemon.  I haven't touchd a think on the config, simply restarted NetworkManger which restarted DCHP client on eth0
2009-09-17T07:51:00.000Z	systest	Jyxt	n8tuser: it seems stable now, i.e. eth1 is static and hasn't been messed with for several minutes
