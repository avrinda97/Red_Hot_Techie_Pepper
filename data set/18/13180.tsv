2005-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	fractalmbrown		if anyone recognizes me from last night, I was the one who had GRUB MBR corruption issues. That has been fixed, and I booted into Ubuntu fine
2005-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	fractalmbrown		my update manager doesn't do anything even when I provide it with the sudo root password
2005-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	have you added repositories?
2005-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	what package?
2005-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	what do you mean? I'm running Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger
2005-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	what are you trying to run? Do you have more than one users on system? Are you logged in as first user created in installation?
2005-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	I am running as the user it created as "michael"
2005-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	was that created in installation?
2005-12-29T08:43:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	is it the first user created in installation? Which app are you trying to run?
2005-12-29T08:43:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	when the setup asked me to create a user, I created a user named michael
2005-12-29T08:44:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	Ok. And what application are you trying to run?
2005-12-29T08:44:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	I am trying to run the update manager
2005-12-29T08:45:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	it asks me for the password, I type it in, then click "ok"... then nothing happens
2005-12-29T08:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	AFAIK, update manager won't comeup if there are no updates. Try running synaptic instead
2005-12-29T08:46:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	there are 37 updates *stares*
2005-12-29T08:46:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	are you already runung synaptic?
2005-12-29T08:47:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	onkarshinde	I don't think so. But that apt-get thing changed the update manager's icon from "37 updates" to "update manager is working"
2005-12-29T08:48:00.000Z	onkarshinde	fractalmbrown	this is weird, you can run apt-get but not update manager
