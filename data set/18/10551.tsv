2007-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	mwe	I think that's wrong, for starters, there's no such thing as ?dm
2007-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	mwe	how do I fix ubotu's description?
2007-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	huh?
2007-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	mwe	type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart
2007-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	mwe	it's gdm, not ?dm
2007-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	try it it works
2007-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	?dm works for gdm, xdm and kdm
2007-01-07T08:27:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	? is a wild card
2007-01-07T08:50:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	always use vipw and vigr for that though
2007-01-07T08:52:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	don't add users like that
2007-01-07T08:52:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	there are programs for that
2007-01-07T08:52:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	useradd
2007-01-07T08:52:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	mwe	yes, but this is the manual way of doing it, incase the other programs aren't present or you don't/can't use them (such is the case with a Knoppix rescue disk)
2007-01-07T08:53:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	you don't edit /etc/passwd without vipw
2007-01-07T08:53:00.000Z	mwe	Ice_Wewe	it might render your system useless if you screw up
