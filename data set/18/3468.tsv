2009-12-24T23:05:00.000Z	chadi		is 20GB space enough for an Ubuntu partition? 18GB space, 2GB swap
2009-12-24T23:07:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	Way more space than you need. My system partition is only 3.94 GiB used out of 9.32 GiB. My home partition is considerably bigger but thats because I have loads of music and videos in it.
2009-12-24T23:08:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	I think 15GB is more fair for a 500GB hdd :P
2009-12-24T23:09:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	You probably wont need swap but if you have the space why not make a swap partition about 1.5x your RAM.
2009-12-24T23:10:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	and dnivra: If you want to hibernate you must have a swap partition bigger than your RAM.
2009-12-24T23:10:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	is hibernation data stored in swap space?
2009-12-24T23:12:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	15GB is plenty big enough for your root partition. More than you need. I recommend you create a separate partition for home so you would have three partitions: root (also shown as /), /home and a swap partition. I have my /home partition on a separate hard disk and I have experimented with about four linux distributions on a 40GB drive (my system drive). I also have swap partitions on both hard disks as I understand linux can optimise load be
2009-12-24T23:15:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	in fact, I am probably not going to installing another distro, and my data are in the windows ntfs partitions. I'll only have ubuntu for testing purposes.
2009-12-24T23:17:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	Thats fine then. But be prepared that if you like ubuntu, you may want to try out the next release when it comes out (every six months) so if you create a dedicated home partition, all your settings and files will be available to the new release. Just leave enough space for another root partition for the next release. I would suggest making your home partition something like between 5 and 10GB
2009-12-24T23:18:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	Sorry root partition should be 5-10GB not the home partition. That might need to be larger depending what you want to store in it
2009-12-24T23:19:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	on my desktop, I have my data in home which is not a separate partition, but I am still able to upgrade to the next release, so what's different?
2009-12-24T23:20:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	It makes it easier to backup the data if you have a separate home partition. Also I have had problems upgrading from one release to another so now I always do a clean install of a new release and just point it at my home partition. That way, if the new release doesnt work out for me its very easy to go back to the old one since its still there.
2009-12-24T23:22:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	You could also point another distro at your home partition and then it would also have access to your files, bookmarks, email and chat accounts etc.
2009-12-24T23:22:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	great, then :) I'll take your opinion in consideration
2009-12-24T23:25:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	thank you for the useful info. Also, I think I'll have my swap size small because I won't use hibernation.
2009-12-24T23:27:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	A pleasure. There is a lot of info about suggested partitioning schemes for ubuntu and for dual booting on the web. I use two swap partitions on both my hard disks as I have an old slow PC so I need every bit of performance gain I can get.
2009-12-24T23:27:00.000Z	chadi	JonathanEllis1	I only have one disk on my laptop, so I can't do that, unfortunately
2009-12-24T23:29:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1	chadi	Unless you have old hardware like I do with only 1GB of RAM its not really necessary
