2006-03-06T06:08:00.000Z	felixfoertsch		Hi there! Is there anyone who could help me installing an ATI graphicscard? I've got an ATI Radeon 9600XT - running on a Asus P4P800 Mainboard. I apt-get'ted the fglrx drivers already.
2006-03-06T06:08:00.000Z	felixfoertsch		But it stil does not work.
2006-03-06T06:10:00.000Z	felixfoertsch		hrm - I'm an absolutly newbie in Linux. Don't know exactly :)
2006-03-06T06:11:00.000Z	felixfoertsch		Oh that page. Jep I ran through it!
2006-03-06T06:12:00.000Z	felixfoertsch		First I tried the second way - with installing the drivers from ati.com - and then the first one.
2006-03-06T06:12:00.000Z	felixfoertsch		Thanks iBalo :)

2006-03-06T06:18:00.000Z	gnat	felixfoertsch	do you know what driver you are using fglrx, ati or radeon?
2006-03-06T06:19:00.000Z	felixfoertsch	gnat	I think I recently installed fglrx - but it seems that it does not work
2006-03-06T06:19:00.000Z	gnat	felixfoertsch	Well I have a Radeon 9000Pro, dual monitors
2006-03-06T06:19:00.000Z	gnat	felixfoertsch	I found flgrx to be a pain
2006-03-06T06:19:00.000Z	felixfoertsch	gnat	my card is a Radeon 9600 XT, single monitor
2006-03-06T06:20:00.000Z	gnat	felixfoertsch	so switched from the fglrx to radeon
