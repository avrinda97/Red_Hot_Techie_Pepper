2008-08-13T22:03:00.000Z	benzss		suppose i want to convert a .mp4 movie to .avi... how would i go about doing this?
2008-08-13T22:03:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	avidemux or ffmpeg
2008-08-13T22:04:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	thanks
2008-08-29T11:42:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	for what it's worth, i missed what you said about alt+f7 (lol) and anyway terminal said 'no such process' or words to that effect
2008-08-29T11:43:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	d'oh!
2008-08-29T11:43:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	sorry, i should have put that on the same line
2008-08-29T11:43:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	no probs, i laughed at myself anyway
2008-08-29T11:43:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	:)
2008-08-29T11:46:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	have you tried vlc?
2008-08-29T11:46:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	yeah it's my default player
2008-08-29T11:47:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	so what do you need mplayer for? :)
2008-08-29T11:47:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	it was worth trying to see if it'd play high def video without being choppy
2008-08-29T11:47:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	i recommend -framedrop :)
2008-08-29T11:48:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	i was trying something like that... well, dropping the resolution to dvd size. unfortunately mplayer threw a wobbly
2008-08-29T12:17:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	do you know if vlc have an equivalent of 'framedrop'?
2008-08-29T12:18:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	you can muck around with the video output settings in the preferences
2008-08-29T12:18:00.000Z	Gnea	benzss	usually the advanced section has the fun stuff :)
2008-08-29T12:19:00.000Z	benzss	Gnea	ok time to fiddle
