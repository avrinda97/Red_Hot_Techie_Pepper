2010-10-14T01:57:00.000Z	Avo		help! my ubuntu partition wont mount!
2010-10-14T01:57:00.000Z	Avo		it's read-only!
2010-10-14T01:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	check it from a livecd;
2010-10-14T01:57:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	Okay, like boot to the ubuntu livecd?
2010-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	And do what exactly? Verify that I can read it?
2010-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	yes; the ubuntu livecd would do
2010-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	fsck; gparted can do it
2010-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	Won't that destroy/have the potential to destroy data..?
2010-10-14T02:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	it all depends on the damage that is already done. you can ru a fsck with options to not touch anything only report problems. if that is ok. run the "repairing" fsck.
2010-10-14T02:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	fsck can move files to /lost+found/
2010-10-14T02:01:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	What do you mean damage done? I was using the computer perfectly fine for like 20 minutes, and now I'm just in windows on the same computer. So it can't be hardware.
2010-10-14T02:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	dunno; root only remounts read only if there is some error
2010-10-14T02:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	check the logs. maybe there is some clue
2010-10-14T02:02:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	And if there is?
2010-10-14T02:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	i can only speculate from here. you have the data to make the decissions. i can take a look to the log if you want
2010-10-14T02:05:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	Okay. Well you've been very helpful; I think I'll reboot to a livecd and check out the logs..
2010-10-14T02:05:00.000Z	Avo	erUSUL	thanks
2010-10-14T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Avo	no problem
