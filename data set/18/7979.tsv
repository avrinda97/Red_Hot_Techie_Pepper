2008-04-07T04:56:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	you have to expect that,   beta get updates to fix every single bug they can resolve before it is officialy out
2008-04-07T04:57:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	I heard you correctly , but like I said , betas get lots of updates to finish fixing the bugs before release
2008-04-12T00:38:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	 dpkg --get-selections > mypackages
2008-05-08T06:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Pelo	/ignore ?
2008-05-08T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	tried , wonT' work
2008-08-16T09:29:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Pelo	winff is pretty nice too. although from my experience converting avi's ought to work with ffmpeg unless the avi is somehow broken?
2008-08-16T09:30:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	I think it's probably just a quesiton of getting the right option,  convertit is just a gui frontend for ffmpeg , saves the trouble
2008-08-16T09:30:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Pelo	so's winff ..
2008-08-16T09:31:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	but it's got  w.i.n in the name, I'll have none of that ;-)
2008-08-16T09:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Pelo	dhcp ?
2008-08-16T09:33:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	the next line when it finaly comes , ( with quiet diswabled) , is my lm-sensors module ident
2008-08-16T09:35:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Pelo	it probes for hardware sensors every boot?
2008-08-16T09:36:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	sounds like it but it's suppposed to be set properly,  I get my fan control and everthing
2008-08-16T09:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Pelo	no idea... my sensors never seem to work, I've given up on fancy stuff likethat
2008-08-16T09:37:00.000Z	Pelo	zcat[1]	thanks anyway, I'll try and ask the #linux-sensors ppl tomorrow when someone seems to be around
