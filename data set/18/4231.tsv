2009-05-27T04:49:00.000Z	Justin10ec		I have a ubuntu server 8.04, how do I upgrade it to 9.04?
2009-05-27T04:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	you need to either upgrade to 8.10 first, or do a clean install
2009-05-27T04:50:00.000Z	Justin10ec	gordonjcp	Is this like "sudo aptitude dis-upgrade"? If so, it didn't really do anything?
2009-05-27T04:50:00.000Z	Justin10ec		dist*
2009-05-27T04:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	kind of
2009-05-27T04:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	dist-upgrade will upgrade your current distro to the latest packages *for that version*
2009-05-27T04:51:00.000Z	Justin10ec	gordonjcp	But there is a way to upgrade to 9.04?
2009-05-27T04:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	you need to specifically tell it you want to upgrade to another version
2009-05-27T04:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	yes, but it involves putting 8.10 on first
2009-05-27T04:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	or - as I said - reinstalling with 9.04
2009-05-27T04:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	when I'm upgrading to an LTS I generally just do a clean install
2009-05-27T04:52:00.000Z	Justin10ec	gordonjcp	I have too much stuff to backup. It wouldn't be worth the time.
2009-05-27T04:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	in which case, if it works don't fix it
2009-05-27T04:53:00.000Z	Justin10ec	gordonjcp	So it's not excessively important to keep the server upgraded at all times?
2009-05-27T04:53:00.000Z	Justin10ec	gordonjcp	Release wise
2009-05-27T04:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	not really
2009-05-27T04:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	if it's the server version it's supported for five years
2009-05-27T04:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Justin10ec	giving you plenty time to back up
