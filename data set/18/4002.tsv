2009-06-15T12:36:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	how exactly are you trying to upgrade?
2009-06-15T12:37:00.000Z	Guest30848	indus	when you put the alt cd in it comes up with the option to upgrade
2009-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	is the apt repo set to upgrade from cd?
2009-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	are you trying to install 9.04 ?
2009-06-15T12:43:00.000Z	Guest30848	indus	yes, 9.04, and im checking repo now

2009-06-15T12:46:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	ok
2009-06-15T12:47:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	i think this method is for upgrading packages and not the system itself
2009-06-15T12:48:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	cant you use boot from cd option to boot?
2009-06-15T12:48:00.000Z	Guest30848	indus	well i chose the update thing in the task tray to try first, and right now itrs doing a 'partial' disto upgrade
2009-06-15T12:49:00.000Z	indus	Guest30848	hmm ok cool
2009-06-15T12:49:00.000Z	Guest30848	indus	would that upgrade and keep my current files?
2009-06-15T13:04:00.000Z	Guest30848	indus	now it came up with a, quite extensive, list of updates it couldnt download
