2007-08-09T10:20:00.000Z	firebird619		Could someone help me? I just installed Ubuntu. I had a different distro installed before and I chose to keep my /home partition unformated to save the data. Now, when I try to login to Ubuntu, it says something about needing 644 permissions. How can I solve this?
2007-08-09T10:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	is your /home directory on a different partition?
2007-08-09T10:21:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	Yes, it is it's own partition.
2007-08-09T10:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	this is what my line in /etc/fstab looks like:     /dev/sda4     /home           ext3    defaults        0       2
2007-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	What do I need to change to get that message away, with it there, I cannot even log in, except to cli, I am on the Live CD right now.
2007-08-09T10:23:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	I had this same issue with another distro and all I had to do was enter a command with the old UID and use 644 as the new id. Is there a command like that for Ubuntu?
2007-08-09T10:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	it should be the same, but i dont know for sure
2007-08-09T10:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	are all the files in there still owned by your user?
2007-08-09T10:25:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	I don't remember what the exact command was though. I know it had to do with chown and so forth. Yes, they are still owned by my user. I used the same user name in Ubuntu as I had in the other distro.
2007-08-09T10:27:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	maybe, use a -R after the chwon
2007-08-09T10:53:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	put your user in the disk group maybe
2007-08-09T10:59:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	shold be 644 i think
2007-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	do you already have a .gnome2 directory?
2007-08-09T11:18:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	It could be that I do. Should I remove it so it can create a new one.
2007-08-09T11:19:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	I just checked, yes, I do already have a .gnome2 directory.
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firebird619	vlc if you have the choice is prolly bets
2007-11-20T09:40:00.000Z	firebird619	MasterShrek	Yes, I think that was a choice, thanks.
