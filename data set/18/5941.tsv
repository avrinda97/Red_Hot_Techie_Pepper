2008-08-12T08:29:00.000Z	dmsuperman		for some reason virtualbox can't see any of the folders i share to it. and i have guest tools installed.
2008-08-12T08:30:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	what OS?
2008-08-12T08:30:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	guest OS, that is
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	minimax	I try to go to \\vboxsvr and it says it can't find it. I try looking in network places, but it can't find anything
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	okay, then Windows
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	What -exact operating system- are you running as a Guest?
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	minimax	Windows XP SP 2
2008-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	okay, not Vista, so not the User Access Control problem
2008-08-12T08:33:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	net use x: \\vboxsvr\share
2008-08-12T08:34:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	where x is an available drive, and share is the name of the share, yes
2008-08-12T08:35:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	you do have to have network connection, and NAT is the easiest to set up
2008-08-12T08:35:00.000Z	dmsuperman	minimax	I have NAT chosen, and the guest has internet access
2008-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	minimax	however, it can't ping my host by it's normal IP
2008-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	minimax	does the host have a special IP inside the guest?
2008-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	no, not with NAT
2008-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	I haven't set up anything besides that
2008-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman	minimax	so do you have any idea why xp can't join the normal network then? what workgroup should the guest be under?
2008-08-12T08:38:00.000Z	minimax	dmsuperman	I haven't used Windows for quite a while, and I'm not even sure changing workgroups does anything
