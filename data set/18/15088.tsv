2005-12-15T15:06:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	define skinned?
2005-12-15T15:07:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	what do you want changed? because everything can pretty much be changed to look like you want it to with enough tweaking
2005-12-15T15:08:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	ok, i'll try helping you then, what do you want changed and have you visited http://www.gnome-look.org yet?
2005-12-15T15:09:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	there's a plethora of options, from a terminal type "sudo apt-get install gnome-art"
2005-12-15T15:10:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	once that's done you should have system->preferences->art manager
2005-12-15T15:10:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	yes, me too :)
2005-12-15T15:23:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	what's the problem? cant install it?

2005-12-15T15:28:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	you download it, then use system-administration-login screen setup to install it
2005-12-15T15:29:00.000Z	Determinist	pete__	system->administration->login screen setup? :)
