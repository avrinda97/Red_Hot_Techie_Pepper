2012-08-17T16:27:00.000Z	`7-Up		Really thought linux users were friendly
2012-08-17T16:27:00.000Z	`7-Up		oh well thanks anyway
2012-08-17T16:28:00.000Z	`7-Up		<`7-Up> anyone in here who can help me figure out how to blacklist nouveau. I have followed all the instructions give on http://linuxers.org/howto/how-remove-nouveau-drivers-ubuntu and still have issues
2012-08-17T16:28:00.000Z	`7-Up		Sorry but I'm frustrated as hell
2012-08-17T16:28:00.000Z	`7-Up		Been working on this for the past 4 hours
2012-08-17T16:28:00.000Z	`7-Up		it isn't working
2012-08-17T16:29:00.000Z	`7-Up		:/
2012-08-17T16:29:00.000Z	`7-Up		all done
2012-08-17T16:30:00.000Z	`7-Up		I already said I'm sorry
2012-08-17T16:30:00.000Z	`7-Up		I guess I am just being pushing cause this is becoming a nuisance ....... sorry for my rudeness
2012-08-17T16:30:00.000Z	k1l	`7-Up	i dont get your problem. if you isntall the nvidia driver package which is in the repos the novou wont be used anyway
2012-08-17T16:31:00.000Z	k1l	`7-Up	so did you install the nviodia-current package?
2012-08-17T16:32:00.000Z	k1l	`7-Up	it is just: apt-get install nvidia-current and everything is done automatic
2012-08-17T16:33:00.000Z	`7-Up	k1l	but it doesn't give me the latest nvidia drivers that are on the website
2012-08-17T16:33:00.000Z	k1l	`7-Up	what is with that page? why dont you want the ubuntu way?
2012-08-17T16:34:00.000Z	`7-Up	k1l	I don't want the repository version
2012-08-17T16:34:00.000Z	k1l	`7-Up	stop that windows behaviour that the latest is the best. that is a totally other way in linux
2012-08-17T16:38:00.000Z	k1l	`7-Up	better ask the pinguy support if they changed smth in their system
