2011-04-18T14:58:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 but it does work
2011-04-18T14:58:00.000Z	kesor	coz_	ok ill try
2011-04-18T14:56:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 yes  hold on
2011-04-18T14:56:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 its called    imagewriter
2011-04-18T14:56:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 also  unetbootin
2011-04-18T14:57:00.000Z	kesor	coz_	wich one is the best?
2011-04-18T14:57:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 mm   well... unetbootin is less picky   but both work
2011-04-18T14:57:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 unetbootin will not reject an iso that is not ubuntu
2011-04-18T14:57:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 its not as "pretty"  as  imagewriter
2011-04-18T15:03:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 ok there is a button on the right labeled  ......
2011-04-18T15:03:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 it has three dots  on the button ,, that will allow you to search where the iso image is
2011-04-18T15:04:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	  actually all you need to do with  this is find the iso image  and click ok  if you want this on a usb flash ,, all the settings  are already set for it
2011-04-18T15:06:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 ok just find the iso ,, with non other settings, , make usre under "Type"  it is the usb driver  then click OK
2011-04-18T15:11:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 to be honest ,, it took me a couple trys to get it right with unetbootin but it does work especially with non ubuntu iso's
2011-04-18T15:17:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 did that work?
2011-04-18T15:18:00.000Z	kesor	coz_	it worked now, i had to install 7zip-full before to get unetbootin to work properly
2011-04-18T15:18:00.000Z	coz_	kesor	 oh!! wow  ok
