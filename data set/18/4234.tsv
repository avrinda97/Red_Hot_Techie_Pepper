2009-05-15T15:55:00.000Z	ShadowSniper	Bischoop	alright thanks, i'll take a look at that, although, is it for kde only?
2009-05-15T15:56:00.000Z	ShadowSniper	Bischoop	is there a comparable program for gnome, i'd rather not have to install the kde support packages if i dont have to
2009-05-15T15:58:00.000Z	Bischoop	ShadowSniper	try: synaptic and you can find some software for gnome, BTW it's doesn matter what window manager u use, at least you'll have to install MAYBE some libraries for KDE
2009-05-15T15:59:00.000Z	ShadowSniper	Bischoop	alright

2009-05-15T16:02:00.000Z	ShadowSniper	Bischoop	i started out tryen to fix a problem with it being only one channel, then realised it wasnt the output it was the jack itself, which is why i had it plugged into another one in the first place lol
