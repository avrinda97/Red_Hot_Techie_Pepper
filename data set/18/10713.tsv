2006-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	the commerical repo for dapper will work for opera
2006-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	Opera 9.x does not work for me on 6.06, I mean, it installs, but is unbelievably slow and has major font issues.  both static-qt and shared-qt.  I have downgraded to 8.54, which is nice and fast again
2006-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	oh i was scanning and read the dependency issues, i thought you were talking about edgy opera
2006-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	you tried both the dapper commercial repo and operas repo?
2006-11-02T14:15:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	I just downloaded the deb from Opera's web site, they have it for several dozen distros, including Ubuntu 6.06 and 5.05 (or whatever the previous one was), but its the transitional-lib that no longer exists which is causing the issue
2006-11-02T14:15:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	oh ok, because i had opera working on dapper about 2 weeks ago
2006-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	no dependency issue
2006-11-02T14:21:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	why don't you try the repos
2006-11-02T14:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	regarding the repos, won't those be for opera 9.x ?
2006-11-02T14:39:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	yes but i make no assumptions about the spped, only that it may solve the dependency issue
2006-11-02T14:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	I had Opera 9.x working without dependancy issues, but something is deeply wrong with it.  it would take 30 seconds to load links, would chug the hard drive for several seconds at random, it would convert a lot of standard fonts to this random hard-to-read font I have installed, etc.
2006-11-02T14:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	and it would often just sit there doing nothing for several seconds at a time, not even using CPU, heh
2006-11-02T14:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	Opera 8.54 is working as expected, half a second to load a new page, switching between tabs is instantaneous, etc.
2006-11-02T14:43:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	you mean opera 9 is seriously broken on *your* comp?
2006-11-02T14:43:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	that sounds pretty difficult to fix though, btw one thing for me that seemed to run away was operapluginwrapper
2006-11-02T14:43:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	I don't know if it is something to do with Ubuntu, my large collection of fonts, something about how I configured the fonts, some library I have installed, gremlins or what
2006-11-02T14:45:00.000Z	nothlit	Samus_Aran	ahh kk its just you seemed to say that the opera package was broken in general, and i found it disconcerting
2006-11-02T14:46:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	nothlit	every version of Opera 9.x is broken for me on Ubuntu 6.06.  Opera 9.x worked fine for me on Arch Linux a few months ago
