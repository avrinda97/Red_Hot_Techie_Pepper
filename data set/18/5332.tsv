2008-11-30T04:50:00.000Z	dmulholland		i just put a process to bg but fg wont bring it to forward again, how do i do it?
2008-11-30T04:52:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	bg then fg works for me
2008-11-30T04:54:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	its not working for me... :S
2008-11-30T04:54:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	the program is still outputting (it outputs each timestep) but I cant get control of it
2008-11-30T04:55:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	hm. i tried with gedit and that worked. you just want contoll back or stop it?
2008-11-30T04:56:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	without stopping it
2008-11-30T04:56:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	isnt there a signal you can send with kill?
2008-11-30T04:57:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	just googled it, apparently kill -STOP
2008-11-30T04:59:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	ssh can compress files too, as scp can:  -C
2008-11-30T05:00:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	ssh will of course not compress but the data stream :-)
2008-11-30T05:01:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	im looking to use disown, any ideas what you would replace [jobspec] with?
2008-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	doesn't "jobs" list the backgrounded processes?
2008-12-14T07:09:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	pm-suspend
2008-12-14T07:11:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	depends on hardware and whatnot. its the utility that is run then you do suspend from X. does it work there for you?
2008-12-14T07:12:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	and.. you have a Zzz key. pressing that one togther with Fn should also suspend
2008-12-14T07:12:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	will try it in a minute, need to finish updating and then ditch X
2008-12-14T07:13:00.000Z	dmulholland	zsquareplusc	trying to see if I can get my EEE running and doing all the functions i need without X, want a boot that I can get wireless and programming from with max batt life
2008-12-14T07:15:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	dmulholland	i'm not sure if a text console really uses less battery than X. at least if you switch off effects and antialised fonts.
