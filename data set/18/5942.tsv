2011-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	lolcat		Hello
2011-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	lolcat		What is that wireless internet sharing program?
2011-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	lolcat		That shares internet through ad-hoc
2011-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	Network manager can do that.
2011-01-27T04:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	System > Preferences > Network Conntections. Create a new shared connection.
2011-01-27T04:36:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	And it works? And I can share my internet? How to I sort out the IP mess?
2011-01-27T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	It's all automagic (it sets up port forwarding, DNS forwarding, and starts a DHCP server automatically).
2011-01-27T04:38:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	I can't see the create a new shared connection
2011-01-27T04:39:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	I see Wired - Wireless - Mobile Broadband - VPN and DLS
2011-01-27T04:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	Sorry, I explained poorly and it looks like there is an easier way than even that. This video shows how to do it: http://magazine.redhat.com/2008/10/16/video-fedora-10-connection-sharing/
2011-01-27T04:41:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	That is fedora!
2011-01-27T04:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	It works exactly the same way in Ubuntu. Both use network-manager.
2011-01-27T04:44:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	I am pretty sure that stuff don't work...
2011-01-27T04:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	I did it just last week.
2011-01-27T04:45:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	My network manager doesn't do anything apparently...
2011-01-27T04:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lolcat	The icon doesn't exist in the pannel? It's frozen? What do you mean by "doesn't do anything"?
2011-01-27T04:46:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	I can open the menu where I select things from nm-applet, but clicking on anything doesn't do anything
2011-09-25T05:37:00.000Z	lolcat	Jordan_U	is a spammer, please ban him
