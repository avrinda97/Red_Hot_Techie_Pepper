2009-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	chocobanana		I have this weird thing going on with 9.04. Whenever I start my computer, networkmanager supposedly connects to my wireless network. However, it won't be able to load any webpages. If access the router configuration page, it goes to a totally different router configuration page, unknown to me. If I fire up the network manager list again and click my network, then it reconnects and it works. If I repeat this, it will take me to the unknown
2009-05-05T14:20:00.000Z	chocobanana		sorry for the long post
2009-05-05T14:21:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	do you happen to have 2 different networks with the same ESSID?
2009-05-05T14:22:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	I thought about that and no, I haven't 2 SSIDs. The unknown router configuration page is also from a router I do not own
2009-05-05T14:23:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	that is what made me think someone could have the same SSID as you have configured, what happens if you change your SSID to something completly different
2009-05-05T14:24:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	haven't tried that yet but that also occured to me... The thing is that I have various computers around, including another machine running 9.04 w/ wireless without any issues whatsoever...
2009-05-05T14:26:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	and it only started happening yesterday. I've been running 9.04 since the RC without any wireless issues...
2009-05-05T14:27:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	that is strange, how many wireless networks does the network applet show you?
2009-05-05T14:28:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	around 10, including 2 or 3 unprotected. I suspect that for some reason it connects to one of the unprotected networks and it makes the connection under mine's name...
2009-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	do you have security on yours?
2009-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	yes
2009-05-05T14:30:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	I have never heard that happening before
2009-05-05T14:31:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	oh wait... I'm looking at my resolv.conf file and it's directing to a specific domain name...
2009-05-05T14:31:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	let me check what's on the other 9.04 machine....
2009-05-05T14:32:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	isn't the resolv.conf re written every time a new connection is made?
2009-05-05T14:32:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	I believe so
2009-05-05T14:33:00.000Z	chocobanana	Mechdave	I'm gonna do some tinkering and I'll be right back
2009-05-05T14:33:00.000Z	Mechdave	chocobanana	right you are :)
