2009-01-09T18:39:00.000Z	jinja-sheep		I can't live without desktop icons.  Everything that goes to the desktop will not appear on the desktop, but rather... on nautilus.  Any idea why this is happening? :\
2009-01-09T18:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	Which release of ubuntu and what were you installing or changing before this started
2009-01-09T18:42:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	 Intrepid64.  I was dd-ing something for DVD media.  Nothing related to Desktop, of course.
2009-01-09T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	as last resort you can reset gnome
2009-01-09T18:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	one sec

2009-01-09T18:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	ctrl-alt f2
2009-01-09T18:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	ctrl-alt f7 to get back
2009-01-09T18:49:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	 Back.  Nothing. <_<
2009-01-09T18:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	but you may still need a restart to reset gnome
2009-01-09T18:50:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	 Sure.  I'll give it a shoot in a bit.
2009-01-09T18:58:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	 FYI -- I'm back.  I have a weird bug then/
2009-01-09T18:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	not so uch of a bug as something you did .. Did you install some tool to rip tha dvd?
2009-01-09T19:00:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	 Sure, some packages.  But that shouldn't conflict with the nautilus... or gnome?  genosismakeiso -- something like that.
2009-01-09T19:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	right, like I said earlier and you said you were just ripping a dvd.. So you did install things form outside the repos based on some tutorial on the web, so
2009-01-09T19:03:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	 I was making an ISO from files on my hard drives -- Using the said command -- mkisofs -o /Desktop/xyzdvd.iso ~/Desktop/xyzdvd/
2009-01-13T08:26:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Jack_Sparrow	  I recently said this -- Maybe you do know?  "Do anybody know how to repair a broken system?  It seems that all of the files in /boot is empty."
2009-01-13T08:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jinja-sheep	too late in my day, winding down.  Without kowing your setups etc I couldnt guess
