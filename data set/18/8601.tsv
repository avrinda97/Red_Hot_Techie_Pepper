2007-07-26T09:32:00.000Z	asisak	Some_Person	right click on unallocated space and "new partiton"?
2007-07-26T09:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	I don't want a new partition
2007-07-26T09:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	I want the ext3 partition to take up the unallocated space
2007-07-26T09:33:00.000Z	asisak	Some_Person	oh, you want to resize partitons? I don't think it works.
2007-07-26T09:34:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	so its impossible?
2007-07-26T09:34:00.000Z	asisak	Some_Person	I am not saying it is impossible, but I would backup everything, create new partiton layout and copy things back.
2007-07-26T09:35:00.000Z	asisak	Some_Person	that is an easy solution.
2007-07-26T09:35:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	I am not deleting everything on my system
2007-07-26T09:38:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	Is there no way to reisize an extended partition?
2007-07-26T09:39:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	nevermind, i got it, i had to do "swapoff" to the swap partition
2007-07-26T09:42:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	now i'm stuck with this: http://img409.imageshack.us/img409/9576/gp2gg6.png
2007-07-26T09:43:00.000Z	asisak	Some_Person	you should 1. backup, 2. resize extended partition, 3. pray, 4. resize ext3 partition, 5. pray
2007-07-26T09:43:00.000Z	Some_Person	asisak	steps 1 and 2 are done, but it wont let me resize the ext3, and i dont believe in god btw
2007-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	asisak	Some_Person	sorry, no more idea
