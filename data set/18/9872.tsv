2007-02-16T06:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	sadistico	ndiswrapper is telling you the drivers you have are not correct for your card.
2007-02-16T06:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	sadistico	Does `lspci' tell you it's a bcm43xx card?
2007-02-16T06:18:00.000Z	cafuego_	sadistico	ok, get rid of that ndiswrapper nonsense and sue the normal driver with its firmware.
2007-02-16T06:19:00.000Z	sadistico	cafuego_	what does sue mean?
2007-02-16T06:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	sadistico	Have a look at http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/dists/edgy-cafuego/bcm43xx/
2007-02-16T06:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	sadistico	There isa file called 'file' in /etc/ndiswrapper probably.
2007-02-16T06:33:00.000Z	cafuego_	sadistico	ls /etc/ndiswrapper
2007-02-16T06:34:00.000Z	sadistico	cafuego_	is that folder supposed to be there?
