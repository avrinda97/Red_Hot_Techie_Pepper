2012-04-05T20:07:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw		I think my grep is broken, is there some way to reinstall?
2012-04-05T20:08:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	what makes you think it's broken?
2012-04-05T20:09:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	because it does not find any matches when it should, and some scripts using it are failing
2012-04-05T20:09:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	can you pastebin some examples?
2012-04-05T20:09:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	what would  good example be?
2012-04-05T20:09:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	one that fails :-)
2012-04-05T20:10:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	i mean, you can just reinstall the grub package, but it might be useful to understand the error, in case it is not limited to grep.
2012-04-05T20:11:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	I have been trying to fix git review for 4 hours now. I want it to work. I don't care why it's broken anymore at this point.
2012-04-05T20:11:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw		And it looks like the issue is coming from grep
2012-04-05T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	you will if it breaks again.
2012-04-05T20:11:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	it did not break, this is a fresh Ubuntu install on which it did not work
2012-04-05T20:12:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	what makes you think reinstalling the package will be of use, in that case?
2012-04-05T20:12:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	I don't think it will, I think it might.
2012-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	well, give it a try.
2012-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	I am not a sysadmin and don't care about dealing with this stuff, I want to get back to my actual job
2012-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw	sipior	how?
2012-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	JeroenDeDauw		if I do sudo apt-get remove grep it gives a warning
2012-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	JeroenDeDauw	"sudo apt-get install --reinstall grep"
