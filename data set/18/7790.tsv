2009-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	Check that the ppp_mppe.ko module is installed.   $ sudo modprobe ppp_mppe
2009-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	i get no output from that command
2009-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	Now run `lsmod` and check for it in the list.  Past that, you'll probably need to pastebin details about the VPN connection.
2009-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	it's there on lsmod
2009-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	Try again.
2009-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	same error
2009-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	Do you need the VPN to connect to your ISP, or to connect to a remote site?
2009-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	it's a remote VPN
2009-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	What is at the far end?   Another Linux computer?  A cisco box?
2009-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	it's IPREDator VPN, i have followed the instructions i've found http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1189343  but it works for those people, but not for me
2009-08-27T23:04:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	Are you behind a NAT?  (eg:  Are you directly connected to the Internet, or do you have a mini-router.)
2009-08-27T23:06:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	i'm not NATted as far as i know, but there maybe a packet shaper on this network before internet, can this be the cause?
2009-08-27T23:07:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	Yes, and you're trying to connect to a politically visible site.
2009-08-27T23:08:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	That site is in blacklists.
2009-08-27T23:09:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	However, your pastebin shows a handshake.  You could have a typo in the ppp conf file.
2009-08-27T23:10:00.000Z	Anarhist	dajhorn	i used the pptp plug-in for network-connections dialogue
2009-08-27T23:11:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	If possible, use another PPTP server to verify that your system can actually connect to that kind of VPN.
2009-08-27T23:11:00.000Z	dajhorn	Anarhist	If not, then you'll need to start reading the troubleshooting howtos:  http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/howto-diagnosis.phtml#lcp_timeout
