2009-07-07T18:18:00.000Z	kaddi		heya, what would be the easiest way to execute a command every 10 minutes, I would like to have a little script that pipes the results from sensors into a txt-file every ten minutes, so that I can check later on how hot it got ...
2009-07-07T18:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 cron
2009-07-07T18:20:00.000Z	kaddi	Dr_Willis	yes that's what I thought ... sadly I don't understand the man-page, which is why I'm here ... how do you tell cron to do something? :s
2009-07-07T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 theres 1000+s of cron example/tutorial sites out there.
2009-07-07T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 rember to give it FULL paths to scripts/commands - 'just in case' :) thats been an issue ive frogotten in the past.
2009-08-14T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 they are allready current/up to date.. so not redownloaded
2009-08-14T17:31:00.000Z	kaddi	Dr_Willis	thanks :)
2010-05-14T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	  you could always do a new install to a flash drive and test it out and decide for yourself
2010-05-14T17:07:00.000Z	kaddi	Dr_Willis	my flash drive is too small and my cd drive broken, so I thought I'd ask and hope that if there are "big" known issues the community would be so honest to admit them upfront :p
2010-05-14T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 may as well go for it then.
2010-10-03T15:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 ive had to use 'winrar.exe' befor and wine. to extract some odd archives.. in the past. :) its a nasty way - but it worked.
2010-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	kaddi	Dr_Willis	do you know if there is a portable version of winrar? or do I need to install the full version
2010-10-03T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 i just get the thing from the winrar homepage. used it to extract the archives i neede then deleted the wine isntall of it.
2010-10-03T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 theres other arvhiver tools out.. but no idwa what ones use   "need PK compat. v6.3 (can do v4.6)"
2010-10-03T15:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 thats possible.
2010-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 could try the latest winzip i guess..  but 'outlook looks bad'
2011-02-05T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 its using ntfs-3g
2011-02-08T22:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaddi	 depends on your irc client
