2010-04-08T12:05:00.000Z	AstroMix		nah i just need IE 6 / 7 / 8
2010-04-08T12:05:00.000Z	AstroMix		7 / Vista is stupid huge, which is why I wanted to install a stripped down XP
2010-04-08T12:06:00.000Z	AstroMix		but I guess I can just do that in VM
2010-04-08T12:06:00.000Z	AstroMix		i had hoped that I might be able to mount my partition through vm so i could access it while in my linux environment
2010-04-08T12:06:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	yes, or not at all.
2010-04-08T12:07:00.000Z	AstroMix	mirsal	 what do you mean?
2010-04-08T12:08:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	I just logged in, I missed all what you said before 9:05
2010-04-08T12:09:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	(win 7 is fat, you want to install XP in a vm)
2010-04-08T12:10:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	My point being: don't install MS Windows.
2010-04-08T12:10:00.000Z	AstroMix	mirsal	never by choice :P
2010-04-08T12:11:00.000Z	AstroMix	mirsal	this all started because I took windows 7 off this machine and wanted to downgrade to Tiny XP
2010-04-08T12:11:00.000Z	AstroMix	mirsal	well, dualboot linux / xp
2010-04-08T12:12:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	What happened ?
2010-04-08T12:12:00.000Z	AstroMix	mirsal	nothing, my old machine's mobo just died, so i went and bought this laptop â€” but it's not built to downgrade to xp
2010-04-08T12:14:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	Oh, I see.
2010-04-08T12:14:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	tpb Then
2010-04-08T12:15:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	depends on what you use it for
2010-04-08T12:15:00.000Z	mirsal	AstroMix	for running another desktop OS, use dynamic
