2006-04-04T06:55:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	doesn't taskbar>System>preferences>menu... do it?
2006-04-04T06:55:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	no it doesn't :)
2006-04-04T06:56:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	ooops, I should of said ...>fonts
2006-04-04T06:57:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	you mean you want to set the font in the window title of a *particular* window?
2006-04-04T06:57:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	no, just for example gnome-panel or other menus .. i remember i need to change something in a .gtkrc file
2006-04-04T07:34:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	hi again
2006-04-04T07:35:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	did you find the answer?
2006-04-04T07:36:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	yes
2006-04-04T07:36:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	it was very easy actually
2006-04-04T07:36:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	but you have to edit the gtkrc of your current theme
2006-04-04T07:39:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	are you talking about ~/.gtkrc or about a file located somewhere else?
2006-04-04T07:41:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	the file in your theme directory, for example /home/user/.themes/bla/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
2006-04-04T07:41:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	then you need to add a few lines, should i send them to you via pastebin?
2006-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	my ~/.themes/ contains only . and ..   Yes, config lines much appreciated.  If < 30 lines, just /query ic56 and paste them to me via IRC.
2006-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	http://www.gfxstyler.de/screenshots/Screenshot.jpg    that's bold-menubars in action :D
2006-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ic56	no its just 5 lines or something like that
2006-04-18T06:39:00.000Z	ic56	gfxstyler	awk is a better tool than sed for getting words out of a line.  But for what you're doing, pgrep and pkill are the right thing.
