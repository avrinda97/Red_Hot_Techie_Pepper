2008-10-26T12:41:00.000Z	su3180		i have troubles playing "alpha centauri" on linux
2008-10-26T12:41:00.000Z	su3180		something about glib library; does any one have a solution?
2008-10-26T12:43:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	with wine?
2008-10-26T12:43:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	- no, native; there is a linux edition
2008-10-26T12:44:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	do you have proper drivers installed?
2008-10-26T12:44:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	proper vga drivers
2008-10-26T12:46:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	- I think so; the game starts without any problem; thing is that at some points exits telling me something about memory issues and glibc 2.something  (which is quite old,so...)
2008-10-26T12:47:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	glxinfo | grep direct
2008-10-26T12:47:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	- yes, i do have direct rendering capabilities
2008-10-26T12:48:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	could it be a module that loads through xorg.conf?
2008-10-26T12:49:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	less likely; perhaps it is better to copy paste the message here, otherwise it's a shot in the dark; just a minute...
2008-10-26T12:53:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	it's a segmentation fault (it was built with glibc 2.1); it also gave me stack dump, but that's not relevant now
2008-10-26T12:53:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	can you show me that?
2008-10-26T12:54:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	the stack dump?
2008-10-26T12:55:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	all that you can get from the terminal
2008-10-26T13:00:00.000Z	jim_p	su3180	i cant say an exact solution, but i am sure that if you make an sl of the current glibc where the game expects to find it, you will be gine
2008-10-26T13:01:00.000Z	su3180	jim_p	hmm... that I have not tried; 10x man ;)
