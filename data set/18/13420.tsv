2005-12-21T10:17:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	sharing the printer isn't difficult
2005-12-21T10:18:00.000Z	dtrostis	sethk	how you do it. I'm very happy is not dificult
2005-12-21T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	to make the printer visible to the xp box you set up samba
2005-12-21T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	webadmin has a nice gui for setting it up.  There are some other admin programs as well.
2005-12-21T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	you install the printer using CUPS first.
2005-12-21T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	two steps.  Install using CUPS to make the printer available to UNIX boxes, and then install samba support for the printer to make it visible to windows
2005-12-21T10:20:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	the wiki thing bimberi posted is a good place to start reading
2005-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	you use samba to do it either way.  To make your linux printer available to windows, you set up the samba server
2005-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	dtrostis	sethk	how do I do that?
2005-12-21T10:23:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	have you installed the samba packages yet?
2005-12-21T10:23:00.000Z	sethk	dtrostis	I believe the wiki article talks about doing it in both directions
