2005-02-09T09:16:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	Ah.. well, install ubuntu??
2005-02-09T09:19:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	so, u want to use the live CD because of security reasons?
2005-02-09T09:20:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	Well, I have no idea if u can save out the data u want when running the live cd or not, since I have not used it at all...
2005-02-09T09:20:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	otoh, why would the live cd be safer then a proper installation??
2005-02-09T09:21:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	may I ask, are you a recent Linux convert, coming in from the windows camp?
2005-02-09T09:22:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	ah, explains it.. Just to say, I've not yet been infected once by a virus in Linux..
2005-02-09T09:25:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	I think you'll be quite safe from viruses, generally speaking...
2005-02-09T09:27:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	not harder to get in, but anything they may wanna "tuck away" would be gone at next reboot, at the latest, depending on how the live cd is done..
2005-02-09T09:29:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	which country do u live in?
2005-02-09T09:29:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	Ok. what type of govt agency does he work for?
2005-02-09T09:30:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	as Nonphasis said, that would be the only reaosn behind it...
2005-02-09T09:31:00.000Z	MainVoid	Looky	so, r those readers or writers?
