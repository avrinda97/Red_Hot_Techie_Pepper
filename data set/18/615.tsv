2011-12-04T01:17:00.000Z	coolstar		Is the gtk 2.0 api fully compatible with 3.0?
2011-12-04T01:17:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	no
2011-12-04T01:18:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	So far as I created a webview, scrolledwindow, and window using the 2.0 code, it works when linked to 3.0
2011-12-04T01:19:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	you should be recompiling. there are differences. also ubuntu ships with both a gtk2 and gtk3 library in 11.10
2011-12-04T01:19:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	I am recompiling using g++
2011-12-04T01:20:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	I'm trying to make the same code work with gtk 3.0 and still be compatible with 2.0
2011-12-18T01:50:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	that's a dead link, uk
2011-12-18T01:51:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	not for me
2011-12-18T01:51:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	it gives an error 403
2011-12-18T02:19:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	you can try unity-2d --replace
2011-12-18T02:19:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	and how do I switch back to normal 3D unity?
2011-12-18T02:19:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	unity --replace
2011-12-18T02:20:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	I just tried that, but its still 2d. should compiz --replace work?
2011-12-18T02:20:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	maybe
2011-12-18T02:22:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	I tried that, and X.Org almost froze until I ssh'ed and killed compiz
2011-12-18T02:27:00.000Z	escott	coolstar	do you really notice that much of a performance difference
2011-12-18T02:27:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	3D games perform 3x faster with 2d unity
2011-12-18T02:28:00.000Z	coolstar	escott	When I play supertuxkart at 1600x1200 with 3D unity, its almost unplayable. However, with unity 2D its snappy
