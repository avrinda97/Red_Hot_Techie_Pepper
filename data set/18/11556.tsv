2006-07-14T10:49:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	do you have a wireless card?
2006-07-14T10:49:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	32bit is more stable and goodfull
2006-07-14T10:49:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	but if you don't have a wireless card, 64bit might be cool
2006-07-14T10:53:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	i believe so
2006-07-14T10:54:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	are you on sixtyfour bit?
2006-07-14T10:54:00.000Z	qwertybob	Spec	im on amd sempron 64
2006-07-14T10:55:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	perhaps the 64bit version of konq is unstable?

2006-07-14T10:55:00.000Z	Spec	qwertybob	hmm, that's unfortunate
