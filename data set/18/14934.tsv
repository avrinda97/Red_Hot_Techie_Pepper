2005-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	othernoob	bob2	i use kubuntu, last night i installed gnome because of a prog that requires gnome, i just tested it, it's not worth it..so )
2005-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	bob2	othernoob	sudo apt-get --purge remove libgtk2.0
2005-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	bob2	othernoob	that will get rid of all of it, tho, so be very very very careful
2005-06-05T15:44:00.000Z	othernoob	bob2	but it will only get rid of all the gnome related progs which were installed last ngiht, right ?
2005-06-05T15:44:00.000Z	bob2	othernoob	nope
2005-06-05T15:44:00.000Z	bob2	othernoob	if you want that, use aptitude in future

2005-06-05T15:45:00.000Z	bob2	othernoob	anything using gtk
2005-06-05T15:45:00.000Z	bob2	othernoob	you said you wanted to get rid of gnome, remember
2005-06-05T15:45:00.000Z	othernoob	bob2	yea. so, since i have a standard kubuntu installation, nothing requires gtk i assume ?
