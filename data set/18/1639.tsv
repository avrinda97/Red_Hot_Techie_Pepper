2012-06-29T07:12:00.000Z	AssociateX		anyone else want to take a stab at my flash issue? I have the flash plugin installed, chromium and firefox see it, but flash does not work in either browser. I've been working on this for 2 days now.
2012-06-29T07:12:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	tried any other browser?
2012-06-29T07:13:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	you name it, I'll install it.
2012-06-29T07:13:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	Opera
2012-06-29T07:16:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	does not show up in synapic
2012-06-29T08:00:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	yeah it is weird.
2012-06-29T07:18:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	echo "deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list; wget -O . http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
2012-06-29T07:18:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install debian-archive-keyring opera
2012-06-29T07:26:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	opera says "plug-in has crashed"
2012-06-29T07:26:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	could try linking the .so to ~/.opera/plugins folder
2012-06-29T07:28:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	I did a ln -s for firefox, mozilla, and chromium, didn't work. Want me to try for opera while I'm at it?
2012-06-29T07:30:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	worth a shot
2012-06-29T07:39:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	i don't see the video crashing flash tbh. Have you tried Unity2D session?
2012-06-29T07:40:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	tbh=to be honest?
2012-06-29T07:40:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	indeed
2012-06-29T07:41:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	I have tried ubuntu2d and also blackbox for the hell of it. No worky.
2012-06-29T07:56:00.000Z	AssociateX	ActionPa1snip	now what? flash does not work in Opera either.
2012-06-29T07:59:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AssociateX	not sure dude, its a weird one
