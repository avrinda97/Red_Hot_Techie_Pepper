2008-11-28T21:02:00.000Z	superkiwi		Hello, I'm on ubuntu 8.10 and my soundsystem is 'hijacked', meaning no program produces sounds atm - Vlc crashed. How do I regain the sound without rebooting?
2008-11-28T21:04:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	yes, it's overkill
2008-11-28T21:05:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	/etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2008-11-28T21:05:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	thanks :]
2008-11-28T21:05:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	yw.
2008-11-28T21:07:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	I didn't work however :+
2008-11-28T21:07:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	hmm ... just a moment
2008-11-28T21:08:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	try: sudo alsa force-reload
2008-11-28T21:08:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	iykrichie sorry, the /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart needed to be run as sudo
2008-11-28T21:09:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	None of them worked. The second one restarted the mixer applet in gnome aswell.
2008-11-28T21:11:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	I'l try restarting X.
2008-11-28T21:12:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	Nothing changed, still no sound.
2008-11-28T21:13:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	maybe it's something wrong with the sound configuration then. IDd you change anything recently?
2008-11-28T21:14:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	I haven't changed anything since last boot.
2008-11-28T21:15:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	sorry, I'm out of my experience now. All I can suggest is searching the forums.
2008-11-28T21:16:00.000Z	superkiwi	Cripps	ok, well thanks for the help. I'l try rebooting the whole machine.
2008-11-28T21:16:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	ouch ... I hope it still fails (because otherwise, it could be something difficult to find)
2008-11-28T21:17:00.000Z	Cripps	superkiwi	if it fails after a restart then maybe an update broke a configuration somewhere or something, but that's all I can think of.
