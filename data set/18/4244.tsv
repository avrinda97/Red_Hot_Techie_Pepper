2009-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	balzac		I need to do a password recovery, but I can't boot to recovery mode
2009-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	balzac		I'd rather not have to re-install my mother's operating system, because I can already see it's shaping up to be very difficult
2009-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	recovery disk?
2009-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	I'd like to make one
2009-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	how do I put it on the USB drive without unetbootin?
2009-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	do you have another computer with  a CD drive?
2009-06-08T06:39:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	x86 apple?
2009-06-08T06:39:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	so get yourself an ISO of jaunty, burn it onto a CD, boot it on the apple (should be able to boot relatively easily - there's prolly some keypress you need at the start)
2009-06-08T06:40:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	ok
2009-06-08T06:40:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	do I find that under administration?
2009-06-08T06:40:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	yep
2009-06-08T06:41:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	then i can boot her netbook from USB, and then reset password from BASH?
2009-06-08T06:41:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	probably
2009-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	another option is to download the ubuntu netbook remix USB image and write that straight to an empty USB driv
2009-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	I'm not inclined to use the netbook remix, because I prefer standard Gnome Desktop
2009-06-08T06:43:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	but you can use that for the installer, then install ubuntu-desktop afterwards
2009-06-08T06:43:00.000Z	balzac	askvictor1	she's already downloaded ubuntu jaunty desktop standard
2009-06-08T06:45:00.000Z	askvictor1	balzac	what's the problem with the bootloader anyway?
