2011-06-28T12:20:00.000Z	cpgo	noisewaterphd	ntfs
2011-06-28T12:21:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cpgo	cause that is where the issue lies. there is some problem with mysql on linux reading from ntfs
2011-06-28T12:21:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cpgo	dont remember the specifics
2011-06-28T12:22:00.000Z	cpgo	noisewaterphd	ok I just copied the datadir to my desktop (in Ubuntu)
2011-06-28T12:23:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cpgo	your datadir should be portable, but trying to read it from the ntfs system is a road I wouldnt travel
2011-06-28T12:24:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cpgo	if you look in the datadir are they there?
2011-06-28T12:24:00.000Z	cpgo	noisewaterphd	yea my tables are in the datadir

2011-06-28T12:28:00.000Z	cpgo	noisewaterphd	how would I get a verbose startup?
