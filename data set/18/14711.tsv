2005-06-27T07:22:00.000Z	chrissturm		how would i use imagemagick to generate thunbnails for a directory full of jpgs?
2005-06-27T07:24:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	for name in *.jpg; do convert $f -scale 100x100 ${f/.jpg/_thumb.jpg}; done
2005-06-27T07:24:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	where 100x100 replaced with dimensions you really want - it will maintain aspect, don't worry about that :)
2005-06-27T07:25:00.000Z	chrissturm	cazabam	thx a lot
2005-06-27T07:25:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	k
2005-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	chrissturm	cazabam	i now get this: convert: option requires an argument `-scale'.
2005-06-27T07:35:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	sorry, popped away for a second... I'll just check...
2005-06-27T07:36:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	sorry, use mogrify rather than convert
2005-06-27T07:38:00.000Z	chrissturm	cazabam	mogrify: missing an image filename `75x75'.
2005-06-27T07:41:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	weird - do any of your images have spaces in the filename?
2005-06-27T07:41:00.000Z	chrissturm	cazabam	nope, i get this error for every filename
2005-06-27T07:43:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	hmm.. bear with me a sec...
2005-06-27T07:46:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	Looks like I was right the first time ... use convert with the scale option. not sure why it didn't work for you
2005-06-27T07:46:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	I just ran the original command line I sent and it seems to work fine for me
2005-06-27T07:50:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	hehe, I just noticed what I did - my sincere apologies - change 'for name in' to 'for f in' and it will work fine... sorry :(
2005-06-27T07:50:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	I need to go to sleep, I htink - deprivation is not good for the mental syntax checker!
2005-06-27T09:46:00.000Z	cazabam	chrissturm	did you get imagemagick to play? I am at work so I had to go do something :(
2005-06-27T09:46:00.000Z	chrissturm	cazabam	thanks, worked great!
