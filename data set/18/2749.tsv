2010-03-05T05:19:00.000Z	mclark1128		Is there anyone who can help me repair my /boot partition?
2010-03-05T05:20:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 What you mean repair? fsck is used to repair filesystem errors.
2010-03-05T05:20:00.000Z	mclark1128	NewWorld	I formatted it
2010-03-05T05:20:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 So what do you want done with it? What is there to repair?
2010-03-05T05:21:00.000Z	mclark1128	NewWorld	Basically I screwed it up while trying to install grub-legacy, and now I am unable to install grub-legacy
2010-03-05T05:22:00.000Z	mclark1128	NewWorld	Actually, let me clarify.  I have installed grub, only I messed it up and when I try to boot I get the error:
2010-03-05T05:28:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 setup (hd0) << installs GRUB to the MBR
2010-03-05T05:31:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 root (hd?,?) <<< where first '?' is the number of the hard drive (start counting at 0) and the second '?' is the number of partition (start counting at 0)
2010-03-05T05:31:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 But that has to be done in GRUB
2010-03-05T05:33:00.000Z	mclark1128	NewWorld	Good news, I just tried the restart after running the grub cmds root (hd0, 0) setup (hd0) and I'm back up and running again!
2010-03-05T05:34:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 I'm glad... but the commands I told you should be issued when you go into terminal and run 'grub' as a command. :S
2010-03-05T05:34:00.000Z	mclark1128	NewWorld	They were, while chrooted to my drive inside the livecd
2010-03-05T05:34:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 That's good so it works? :)
2010-03-05T05:35:00.000Z	mclark1128	NewWorld	Yes, now I just need to get my Win7 partition on the menu
2010-03-05T05:35:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2010-03-05T05:36:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 What you mean graphical? GRUB is menu loader... X server isn't running then.
2010-03-05T05:57:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 Count the partitions, they start at 0. For example in Gparted.
2010-03-05T05:57:00.000Z	NewWorld	mclark1128	 In Gpartedd, from left to right.
