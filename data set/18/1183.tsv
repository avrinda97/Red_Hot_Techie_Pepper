2011-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	correct, pinging google resolves the ip but thats it. default's gateway is correct in route
2011-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	Also, what's in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2011-09-19T12:12:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	ok
2011-09-19T12:13:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	Can you confirm internet is working on another box on same network?
2011-09-19T12:13:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	i set up the wireless card with static ip configuration following some online instructions, its not far off from wired configuration
2011-09-19T12:14:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	do so just to make sure
2011-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	what kind of environment, home network with DHCP router?
2011-09-19T12:19:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	it works fine. the gateway i am trying to use is a windows server with internet connection sharing, network uses static ips
2011-09-19T12:21:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	Well, it does if done correctly ;) It will probably be a "Ahh!"
2011-09-19T12:23:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	as i said, i have configured ubuntu server manually tons of times in the past, this seems like a bug.
2011-09-19T12:24:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	i cant ping external addresses
2011-09-19T12:25:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	Ok? I got it wrong then, thought you said DNS was ok?
2011-09-19T12:25:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	So no traffic whatsoever outside of LAN?
2011-09-19T12:25:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	the dns server is the same windows box that is the gateway, it resolves addresses to ips fine, but ping received no response
2011-09-19T12:26:00.000Z	Defusal	scarleo	exactly
2011-09-19T12:33:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	Don't you have any logs in the gateway box that might reveal what's going on?
2011-09-19T12:33:00.000Z	scarleo	Defusal	Or maybe /var/log/syslog might have something on Ubuntu box?
