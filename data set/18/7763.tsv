2008-05-17T22:33:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	yup :)
2008-05-17T22:34:00.000Z	jack-desktop	bazhang	captail or lowercase P?
2008-07-02T11:05:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	where are you launching it from
2008-07-02T11:06:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	the menu? ie simple-ccsm or other
2008-07-02T11:07:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	what about in appearances
2008-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	jack-desktop	bazhang	what about appearances
2008-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	set to custom (this is gutsy or hardy)
2008-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	jack-desktop	bazhang	it works.... it just stops working after my computer has been online for awhile
2008-07-02T11:09:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	what about alt f2 compiz --replace
2008-07-02T11:09:00.000Z	jack-desktop	bazhang	yeah, that fixed it, i was wondering why it did this though
2008-07-02T11:09:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	were you doing compiz --replace in the terminal?
2008-07-02T11:10:00.000Z	jack-desktop	bazhang	yes, but ... that's not the problem lol
2008-07-02T11:10:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	then that is the source of your problems; do it in run command window not terminal
2008-07-02T11:11:00.000Z	bazhang	jack-desktop	as I said above
