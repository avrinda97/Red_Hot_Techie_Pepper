2007-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	noise		hello
2007-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	noise		anyone there
2007-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	noise		how do i reinstall ubuntu on the partition i already made??
2007-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	noise		like just wipe the partition without disturbing windows one
2007-03-30T11:14:00.000Z	noise		will it format it?
2007-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	noise		last time i tried to format using hte live cdi had to unplug all my harddrives except for one
2007-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	noise		and it caused me grief with windows
2007-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	noise		but it cant format partitions, it only formats driv
2007-03-30T11:16:00.000Z	noise		drives
2007-03-30T11:16:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	you pick what partitions to install it to
2007-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	if you want to do it manually, you can even tell it to delete your current / and swap partitions, and then tell it to automatically install to the free space
2007-03-30T11:18:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	are you trying to make more than one linux partition on different drives, or the same drive?
2007-03-30T11:19:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	you can
2007-03-30T11:20:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	I am guessing that maybe you weren't careful in picking the correct drive when it asked you which one
2007-03-30T11:20:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	it will automatically set up the grub for you
2007-03-30T11:22:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	grub gets installed to the mbr with config files in /boot, so you don't need any extra space
2007-03-30T11:23:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	the only time you run into problems is if you install windows after you install linux, it will usually wipe grub from the mbr and just load windows
2007-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	noise	np :)
