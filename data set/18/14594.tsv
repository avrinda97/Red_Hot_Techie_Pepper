2005-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	bcat		i'm running hoary have included universe and multiverse in my sources. for several days (or weeks?) now package acroread does not update.
2005-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	bcat		i get dependancy errors: acroread: Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.4-1) but 2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu13 is to be installed
2005-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	bcat		            Depends: libgcc1 (>= 1:4.0.0-7) but 1:4.0-0pre6ubuntu7 is to be installed
2005-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	bcat		how can i fix this?
2005-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	Seveas	bcat	don't use random unofficial repositories...
2005-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	np, I'm used to debian, just tell me on what base universe and multiverse is built. ubuntu unstable?
2005-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	yes i know that
2005-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	but universe/multiverse packages are obviously not built on top of hoary (different glibc-version). so what do they use?
2005-07-04T13:18:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	or at least this applies to the acroread package
2005-07-04T13:18:00.000Z	Seveas	bcat	they are...
2005-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	So why is there a dependency problem? how can acroread from multiverse depend on libc6 (>= 2.3.4-1)?
2005-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	when libc6 in hoary is  2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu13
2005-07-04T13:20:00.000Z	Seveas	bcat	that is not acroread in multiverse
2005-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	really? http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/a/acroread/
2005-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	Seveas	bcat	that will be the breezy package you look at...
2005-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	Seveas	bcat	check packages.ubuntu.com or apt-cache search
2005-07-04T13:22:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	ah ok, thanks for the clarification
2005-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	bcat	Seveas	how stable is breezy already? is a switch advisable for a desktop system?
