2012-02-28T03:29:00.000Z	Trevor69420		are you sure it's not youir current user lol

2012-02-28T03:30:00.000Z	Trevor69420	macmartine	are there any cron jobs running as that user possibly?
2012-02-28T03:30:00.000Z	macmartine	Trevor69420	It's just some user I made with ISPConfig, then removed, but apparenly they aren't completely gone. Um, shouldn't be, but I'll check
2012-02-28T03:31:00.000Z	macmartine	Trevor69420	nope, all cron jobs are disabled
2012-02-28T03:31:00.000Z	Trevor69420		man macmartine i dunno strange
2012-02-28T03:31:00.000Z	macmartine	Trevor69420	I don't see anythig running under that user in 'top'
2012-02-28T03:41:00.000Z	macmartine	Trevor69420	Ah, I see they have 2 processes running: https://gist.github.com/1927644 and when I kill them they are recreated. How can I figure out what's starting them?
