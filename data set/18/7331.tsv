2010-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	ActionParsnip	im not running windows period lol
2010-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	then why use crappy NTFS??
2010-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	there are other distros
2011-03-23T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	as long as the kernel is compiled to use the addressing and any features in the CPU then sure
2011-08-30T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	it uses a file in (crappy) ntfs as the NTFS drive, the hardware is accessed natively though
2011-08-30T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	the file is formatted to Ext4 but is still susceptible to the shortcomings of NTFS
2011-08-30T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	sure, its just like a regular install
2011-12-07T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	yes
2011-12-07T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	do you mean for updates?
2011-12-07T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	look into apt-fast :)
2011-12-07T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	use torrents
2011-12-07T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	really, ubuntu torrents successfully max my connection out
2011-12-07T09:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	you can use axel to download the same file from 2 places at the same time
2011-12-07T09:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	there aren't even a billion sockets to use
2011-12-07T09:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DrkCodeman	try axel with 2 sources (of the same file), it will pull it down from both at the same time, apt-fast uses the same method for system updates and installs
