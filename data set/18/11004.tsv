2011-06-18T21:33:00.000Z	ubuntu__		no i updated in live mode and then  log out and log in it doesn't work out..
2011-06-18T21:35:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	have you tried the alternate installer to install ubuntu?
2011-06-18T21:37:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	i haven't tried the alternate disc but i can install with live disc also but the problem remains that the os always boots in low graphics mode..
2011-06-18T21:38:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	you should check your Xorg.0.log then. also: do you use a sandy bridge CPU?
2011-06-18T21:41:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	i don;t have sandy bridge, i am using 10.04 and its working fine the problem is when i try ubuntu 11.04, infact i also tried fedora 15 the new version and i faced the same prob.
2011-06-18T21:41:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	then answer ActionParsnip

2011-06-18T21:47:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	what to do next
2011-06-18T21:49:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	it depends when your screen goes black. I told you to use the alternate installer, you didn't want to. but I don't care: it's not MY problem but yours. if you don't want to take suggestions, no skin off my back
2011-06-18T21:50:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	when i run the live usb and select try ubuntu till then everythig is visibel and after that everything is blackscreen
2011-06-18T21:51:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	so it looks like a X problem. check your Xorg log
2011-06-18T21:53:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	how do i check xorg log
2011-06-18T21:54:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	although there is no problem of x with ubuntu 10.04 then why with 11.04?
2011-06-18T21:58:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	?
2011-06-18T21:58:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	kernel mode setting for example
2011-06-18T21:58:00.000Z	ubuntu__	wols	ok..
2011-06-18T22:08:00.000Z	wols	ubuntu__	yelling won't make us help you but ignore you. what I will do now I think. better people to help than such as you
