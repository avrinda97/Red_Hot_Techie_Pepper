2007-10-24T10:23:00.000Z	Alarictric		I suppose i'll try one more time before i give up for the night, pardon the repeat...
2007-10-24T10:23:00.000Z	Alarictric		I'm trying to get Desktop Effects working in Gutsy, im using an ATI with the 8.42 drivers. this is the method i followed http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=589075  can anybody help?
2007-10-24T10:23:00.000Z	Alarictric		i thought i was being fairly specific, what more do you need to know?
2007-10-24T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	I used that method, but I created a new section called ServerFlags instead of putting the AIGLX option in ServerLayou
2007-10-24T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	and it sucked on my 200m
2007-10-24T10:26:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	i had a serverflags section already with an option in it... let me try that out
2007-10-24T10:28:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	ill try messing around with the options under the two server sections some more
2007-10-24T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	yes, true, on, 1 all are the same
2007-10-24T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	one other thing I did (don't know if it was required) was add a section Module with Option "glx"
2007-10-24T10:31:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	its worth a shot, thanks
2007-10-24T10:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	and joebob777as7 I also added fglrx to the whitelist in /usr/bin/compiz (ug, editing in /usr , that stuff needs to be slid into /etc/default)
2007-10-24T10:34:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	sorry, how do i add something to the white list?
2007-10-24T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	edit /usr/bin/compiz
2007-10-24T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	and joebob777as7 I also added fglrx to the blacklist in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
2007-10-24T10:39:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	woot! the whitelist got me running!
2007-10-24T10:39:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	thanks a bunch man
2007-10-24T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Alarictric	yw, I hope that driver works better for you than it did for me
2007-10-24T10:40:00.000Z	Alarictric	nickrud	ill give it a shot and see, im off to go play with it. that had been bugging me all night trying to get it running. thanks agian
