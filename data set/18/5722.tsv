2008-09-03T12:06:00.000Z	cotton		is there a way to open all the ports in ubuntu? iptables -F is not working, in fact i removed the firewall from the system and i still get All 1714 scanned ports on localhost are close from nmap localhost
2008-09-03T12:06:00.000Z	cotton		cause im making some test
2008-09-03T12:07:00.000Z	cotton		i understand that
2008-09-03T12:07:00.000Z	cotton		but i have to open them
2008-09-03T12:07:00.000Z	cotton		all of them
2008-09-03T12:08:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	then install some service, say opnessh-server
2008-09-03T12:11:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	if the service is running, then it's listening on a port, and nstat and nmap both would show it
2008-09-03T12:12:00.000Z	cotton	eightyeight	ps aux | grep ssh shows /usr/sbin/sshd and ssh running
2008-09-03T12:12:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	netstat -tlpn | grep ssh
2008-09-03T12:13:00.000Z	cotton	eightyeight	tcp6    0    0 :::2222      :::*     LISTEN    4557/sshd
2008-09-03T12:14:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	looks like 2222 is open and listening on all interfaces
2008-09-03T12:14:00.000Z	cotton	eightyeight	nmap tells me everything is closed
2008-09-03T12:15:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	what is the nmap command you are running? nmap only scans the priv ports (up to 1024)
2008-09-03T12:15:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	there you go
2008-09-03T12:16:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	nmap -p 1-2223 localhost
2008-09-03T12:16:00.000Z	cotton	eightyeight	i love you
2008-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	you should learn netstat
2008-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	eightyeight	cotton	nmap is useful, but it's doing syn packet port scanning looking for acks. i could easily block those
