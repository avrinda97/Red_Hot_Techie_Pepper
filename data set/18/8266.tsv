2010-01-26T06:11:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	amarok is great ... although its a KDE app ... I like Banshee, Songbird, Exaile
2010-01-26T06:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	been able to do that for 4 years :)
2010-01-26T06:26:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	depends how you do it
2010-01-26T06:27:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	Windows first and then Ubuntu ... not the other way around
2010-01-26T06:28:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	fails to boot ... how? ... what error?
2010-01-26T06:30:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	ugh ... that is a corruption in Windows ...
2010-01-26T06:30:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	how did you make those partitions? in Windows or in Ubuntu?
2010-01-26T06:32:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	that is defintely a Windows error .. nothing that grub would have caused ...
2010-01-26T06:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	did you resize the Windows partition during install?
2010-01-26T06:35:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	physical partitions
2010-01-26T06:36:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	use our names ;) and yeah
2010-01-26T06:37:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	or just install Windows to the whole drive and let Ubuntu do it all automatically :)
2010-01-26T06:42:00.000Z	zetheroo	camps	good luck ;)
