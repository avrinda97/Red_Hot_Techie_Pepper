2008-12-12T13:54:00.000Z	davguar		Can anyone tell me why when I try to burn 4.5gb of stuff onto a dvd that is supposedly 4.7gb in capacity I am told to ejectr the dick and insert one with 4.5gb capacity or more?
2008-12-12T13:56:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	is the media detected properly in the program?
2008-12-12T13:56:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	I don't know, how do I find out?
2008-12-12T13:56:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	what program are you using?
2008-12-12T13:57:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	nautilus?
2008-12-12T13:58:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	try brasero? there is probably some way in nautilus, i just dont know how
2008-12-12T13:58:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	okay... I've had this problem in previous versions of Ubuntu too.
2008-12-12T13:59:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	could be flaky drive or media, some writeable disk formats are preferred to others
2008-12-12T14:01:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	when I try to use brasero I get this error when I hit burn: the file (null) couldn't be read (Bad address).
2008-12-12T14:03:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	in image burning setup, right before you burn it, click the properties button for the selected media
2008-12-12T14:03:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	okay then what?
2008-12-12T14:04:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	what does it say, does it properly detect the media?
2008-12-12T14:05:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	as far as I can tell... the title of the window is Properties of DVD-RAM UJ-852S
2008-12-12T14:05:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	what format is the image file? try with a different drive or different image file
2008-12-12T14:07:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	in the main window it shows the folder that I want to burn to disk under the files menu and next to the burn button it has a bar that shows 3.3/4.3GiB so I assume that means there is enough room
2008-12-12T14:07:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	I don't see a way to alter the type of image?
2008-12-12T14:08:00.000Z	mchelen	davguar	oh ok so you are doing a data project right?
2008-12-12T14:09:00.000Z	davguar	mchelen	That's what I'm aiming for... I have a folder with a tonne of e-books and I want to burn them
