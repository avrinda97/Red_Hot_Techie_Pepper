2007-03-17T12:02:00.000Z	intelikey		i'm gone for a while. later folks.
2007-03-17T09:15:00.000Z	intelikey		would someone that knows grub take a look at my configs and tell me what is wrong     http://pastebin.ca/398849     if lilo loads the vmlinuz and initrd pair it boots just fine,  if grub loads them  "and it does that ok"  it times out waiting for the root fs then i have to mount it and it continues booting...
2007-03-17T09:16:00.000Z	intelikey		grub help  ?
2007-03-17T09:17:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	i think there's no "boot" at line 15
2007-03-17T09:17:00.000Z	intelikey	phreakazoid	does it need one ?
2007-03-17T09:18:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	yeah, it wont boot if you did tell it to boot, it will just mount the kernel, and the initrd
2007-03-17T09:19:00.000Z	intelikey	phreakazoid	it does that and drops me into a busybox shell after 5 minutes.  i hope it's a simple as one word addition
2007-03-17T09:20:00.000Z	intelikey	phreakazoid	i'll test it but it takes for ever to get back if it fails.
2007-03-17T09:21:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	hold on lemme checks mine
2007-03-17T09:21:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	yup, correct. :D
2007-03-17T09:22:00.000Z	intelikey	phreakazoid	ok edited and going to test.
2007-03-17T09:22:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	cool. hope it works!
2007-03-17T09:38:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	where did it failed?
2007-03-17T09:38:00.000Z	intelikey	phreakazoid	timed out waiting for root fs
2007-03-17T09:43:00.000Z	phreakazoid	intelikey	wow no idea, but here something from the forum, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=164458
2007-03-17T09:45:00.000Z	intelikey	phreakazoid	ok. but i don't use lvm so that's not the issue.
