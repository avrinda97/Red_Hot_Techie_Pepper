2010-03-23T08:29:00.000Z	mikewatt		How can I file a bug of my case?
2010-03-23T08:29:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	sorry my battery died
2010-03-23T08:31:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	if either of the hotkeys you need didnt give anything in showkey, you need to file a kernel bug "ubuntu-bug linux" though testing with the 10.04 beta live cd to see if its already fixed there is recommended
2010-03-23T08:33:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	if they are showing with showkey but not xev, look here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Troubleshooting
2010-03-23T08:35:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	which doent mean its not fixed in 10.04 ;-) it *could* be so its good to test
2010-03-23T08:36:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	we established that xev didnt see them
2010-03-23T08:37:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	so if showkey did show a code when you clicked the hotkey you want, check out that wiki page for the rest of the "how to report it" info
2010-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	ok then in the terminal "ubuntu-bug linux" will let you report a kernel bug to launchpad.net
2010-03-23T08:40:00.000Z	maco2	mikewatt	that wiki page will also tell you that ;-)
