2005-02-01T10:33:00.000Z	tottinge		Can I get help with an XFree86 problem?
2005-02-01T10:34:00.000Z	tottinge		My keyboard is standard 104, /dev/psaux (ms natural)  -- works fine in console, but not gdm or xdm.
2005-02-01T10:35:00.000Z	tottinge		Note: I was running straight debian, and it was fine in gdm/xdm.  I set /etc/apt/sources.list to ubuntu, dist-upgrade, and now this.
2005-02-01T10:35:00.000Z	tottinge		I've tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 -- no joy.
2005-02-01T10:35:00.000Z	tottinge		what might I try next?
2005-02-01T10:36:00.000Z	tottinge		Sorry -- mind went south (too many trips through dpkg-reconfigure) I mean ti's on PS/2 port.
2005-02-01T10:37:00.000Z	tottinge		It still works in console, not in gdm, xdm.
2005-02-01T10:38:00.000Z	mindphasr	tottinge	What does your keyboard input device options say in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4?
2005-02-01T10:39:00.000Z	tottinge	mindphasr	exactly the same as my other (working) libranet debian box.
2005-02-01T10:40:00.000Z	mindphasr	tottinge	Any errors in /var/log/XFree86.0.log?
2005-02-01T10:42:00.000Z	tottinge	mindphasr	none.
2005-02-01T10:43:00.000Z	mindphasr	tottinge	Does your caps lock lights go on and off in X?
2005-02-01T10:44:00.000Z	tottinge	mindphasr	No, no lights.
2005-02-01T10:44:00.000Z	mindphasr	tottinge	Does X even start?
2005-02-01T10:45:00.000Z	tottinge	mindphasr	I get the login screen and the mouse is live.
2005-02-01T10:45:00.000Z	mindphasr	tottinge	That is very strange..I don't know what the deal is there
2005-02-01T10:46:00.000Z	tottinge	mindphasr	gdm responds to mouse events -- I can use 'actions' menu.
2005-02-01T11:03:00.000Z	tottinge	mindphasr	crimsun --- the kernel upgrade did it.  I have keyboard now.
