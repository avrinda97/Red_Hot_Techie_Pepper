2006-06-14T11:04:00.000Z	orbin	chrones	ok, my guess: bad repos.  do you *need* to use that one?  b/c there are other aussie ones available: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive

2006-06-14T11:06:00.000Z	orbin	chrones	oh i see....can you contact them about it?
2006-06-14T11:06:00.000Z	chrones	orbin	i'm confused because the file it says doesn't exist does.. and I can wget them fine
2006-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	chrones	orbin	yeah I can... thanks for helping anyway!
2006-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	orbin	chrones	well the errors say something about backend, not cannot find file or anything like that
