2009-08-06T18:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		don't talk about windows, I need help with ubuntu :-)
2009-08-06T18:56:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	try using teh apt-cache search <package> command
2009-08-06T18:56:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	eg sudo apt-cache search openvas
2009-08-06T18:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	did that, it doesn't show any openvas-plugins package
2009-08-06T19:00:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	I've installed anything related to openvas via synaptic, but there is no openvas-package there
2009-08-06T19:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	pardon, s/openvas-package/openvas-plugins package/
2009-08-06T19:04:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	have you seen this? https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/jaunty-changes/2009-March/006986.html
2009-08-06T19:05:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	certainly not, since I'm following the install guide from the openvas site. hold on, I'll have a look
2009-08-06T19:07:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	i just scanned it but it seems to suggest that you will need to download the plugins seperatley and install them
2009-08-06T19:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	actually openvas-nvt-sync is the command that is supposed to download the plugins
2009-08-06T19:08:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	ahh my bad, I thought you said opnevas------ was *in* the plugins
2009-08-06T19:10:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	the install guide mentions some openvas-plugins package and states that openvas-nvt-sync is supposed to belong to this package. I don't have openvas-nvt-sync and I can't find the openvas-plugins package, that's where I'm stuck
2009-08-06T19:13:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	on the website on the left you can download the openvas-plugins tarball then you will need to compile it manually
2009-08-06T19:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	that's not the ubuntu-way :) going that way is the last resort
2009-08-06T19:14:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	that is how you need to do it, the link I gave you said there was no package for openvas-plugins
2009-08-06T19:15:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	if there is no package you will need to compile from source
2009-08-06T19:15:00.000Z	moncky_	ubuntu_n00b	there are rpm's you could use alien to convert to dpkg if you preferr to run it through that
2009-08-06T19:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	moncky_	oh no, that's even worse than compiling from source
