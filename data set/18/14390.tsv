2005-10-27T08:04:00.000Z	erisco		i logged out a couple times, restarted... are there any other solutions to the signature key problem?
2005-10-27T08:04:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	what's the problem?
2005-10-27T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	it's a Krappy Desktop Environment.  Big bloated windows lookalike thing.  Alternative to GNOME.
2005-10-27T10:11:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	you can install the package.  no need to build it
2005-10-27T10:11:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	the package is 'libxml-parser-perl'
2005-10-27T10:11:00.000Z	erisco	dooglus	i will try that thanks
2005-10-27T10:15:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	there are packages for everything :)
2005-10-27T10:15:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	use 'synaptic' to search for them
2005-10-27T10:16:00.000Z	erisco	dooglus	there is only glibc-doc
2005-10-27T10:19:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	what do you need to install?
2005-10-27T10:21:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	could it be "libglib2.0-dev" that you need?
2005-10-30T06:37:00.000Z	erisco	dooglus	aw comon, what is wrong with it?
2005-10-30T06:37:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	it's like linux-for-dummies.
2005-10-30T06:38:00.000Z	erisco	dooglus	simple is best
2005-10-30T06:38:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	isn't it better to learn the command line than to rely on mc?
2005-10-30T06:38:00.000Z	erisco	dooglus	why strain yourself?
2005-10-30T06:38:00.000Z	erisco	dooglus	well mc has a bit of command line
2006-02-21T14:40:00.000Z	dooglus	erisco	edit /etc/apt/sources.list
