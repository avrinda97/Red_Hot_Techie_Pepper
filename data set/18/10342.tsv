2007-10-21T16:25:00.000Z	stefg	ZaphodBeeblebrox	try again when using a default theme. Gutsy is picky on themes and a lot of apps crash with heavily coustomized gtk-themes
2007-10-21T16:26:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	Theme for Ubuntu or theme for TB?
2007-10-21T16:26:00.000Z	stefg	ZaphodBeeblebrox	theme for ubuntu
2007-10-21T16:26:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	kk, hold on
2007-10-21T16:27:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	I should use Human, than, right?
2007-10-21T16:28:00.000Z	stefg	ZaphodBeeblebrox	yes, or one of the other supplied themes. Human is safe
2007-10-21T16:29:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	nope, didn't solved. Tried with Human and clear looks. Even tried removing the visual effects.
2007-10-21T16:31:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	Any thoughts?
2007-10-21T16:31:00.000Z	stefg	ZaphodBeeblebrox	ok. So to get any meaningful output from Thunderbird run it from the terminal, so you see error logs there. and try a fresh profile for a test, some extension might be misbehaving
2007-10-21T16:32:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	The only error I get is "Segmentation Fault (core dumped)"
2007-10-21T16:32:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	I'll try running with no extensions, good idea
2007-10-21T16:33:00.000Z	stefg	ZaphodBeeblebrox	that's an utterly ugly crash... i guess it's one of the extensions
2007-10-21T16:34:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	bingo
2007-10-21T16:34:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	stefg	Thanks a lot :)
2007-11-04T23:37:00.000Z	stefg	ZaphodBeeblebrox	you are either not using a gpg signed repo, or you didn't add the key
