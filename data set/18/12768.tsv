2006-04-08T15:21:00.000Z	healot		and the good tips from Sun Microsystem, never use/link libraries from com.sun.* :)
2006-04-08T15:22:00.000Z	healot		yes, i know...
2006-04-08T15:22:00.000Z	healot		that's why never compile/link to com.sun.* libraries in the first place
2006-04-08T15:23:00.000Z	healot		!paste
2006-04-08T15:24:00.000Z	healot		what's the use of jar (the real jar) then
2006-04-08T15:25:00.000Z	healot		or that "java" is actually "gcij"?
2006-04-08T15:26:00.000Z	healot		Blackdown's is on another path...
2006-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	healot		"/usr/lib/j2re" or something, not "/usr/bin/java"
2006-04-08T15:28:00.000Z	healot		or just load the Netbeans/JDK bundle. less setup/less pain, bigger file size :)

2006-04-08T15:29:00.000Z	healot		yeah
2006-04-08T15:29:00.000Z	healot		as I said less pain/setup, but bigger file size :)
2006-04-08T15:29:00.000Z	Svennig		heh
2006-04-08T15:30:00.000Z	healot		anyway netbeans is a real good Netbeans
