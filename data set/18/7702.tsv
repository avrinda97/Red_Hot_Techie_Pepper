2012-10-16T17:39:00.000Z	michealPW		In KDE there's a very intuitive mail-envolope that's clearly labeled as KMail and seamlessly integrates with my Live Mail account..
2012-10-16T17:39:00.000Z	michealPW		I log-in to KDE and the mail-envolope shakes, showing a little "1" and a "+" to indicate I have 1 unread new mail..
2012-10-16T17:39:00.000Z	michealPW		I can click it and get my mail... Ubuntu Unity, though? Nope!
2012-10-16T17:40:00.000Z	michealPW		It's some totaly unituitive mail-envolope that does NOT change when I have a new mail, it does NOT integrate at all with my mail it's just a stupid link to Thunderbird haha why not I just open Thunderbird from the Launcher menu??
2012-10-16T17:40:00.000Z	michealPW		It isn't even labeled, I don't even know what program is behind this mail-envolope on Ubuntu 12.04 Unity.
2012-10-16T17:41:00.000Z	michealPW		It's not a problem with KDE, like I just said.. KDE works perfectly fine in that regard and makes perfect sense. It's Ubuntu's UNITY that does not make any sense LOL.
2012-10-16T17:41:00.000Z	michealPW		Anyways nevermind.
2012-10-16T17:41:00.000Z	michealPW		I'll see what I can't figure out on my own ffs.
2012-10-16T17:41:00.000Z	michealPW		Seriously, KDE is not the problem...
2012-10-16T17:41:00.000Z	michealPW		You're missing what I'm saying, or something. Just don't worry about it :P
