2009-07-24T13:38:00.000Z	Ileden		Hi! I'm trying to get my Radeon 9200 to work with 3d support by following the guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver, but while display is otherwise ok, there's no 3d support. 'lshw -C display' reports the display as "UNCLAIMED". My Xorg.0.log has only one error, which reads "(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)". I'm wondering why it refers to NVidia driver, since I have a Radeon card - my previous card tha
2009-07-24T13:40:00.000Z	Spikemcc	Ileden	try on ubuntu 8.04 ...
2009-07-24T13:41:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	are you suggesting downgrading my complete Ubuntu installation?
2009-07-24T13:42:00.000Z	Spikemcc	Ileden	for old Atis only ubuntu hardy heron 8.04.3 LTS is decent for 3d
2009-07-24T13:47:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	really? that's weird. This should probably be mentioned in the RadeonDriver guide.
2009-07-24T13:48:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	is this documented somewhere that can be linked to, so the guide could relfect it?
2009-07-24T13:48:00.000Z	Spikemcc	Ileden	no on all ubuntu sites ...
2009-07-24T13:49:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	I'd also be interested to know what in the upgrade causes it not to work.
2009-07-24T13:49:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	in case there is a workaround.
2009-07-24T13:51:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	yeah, but I'm running 9.04, not 8.10, so it would be a significant downgrade
2009-07-24T13:52:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	anyway, thanks for the infromation.
2009-07-24T13:52:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	the guide does speak about an open source driver, though, not Catalyst (which I assume is ATI prorietary driver)
2009-07-24T13:55:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	the guide lists "Full 3D support" for "9200 / rv280 based cards", and I understand it's talking about the open source "ati" driver
2009-07-24T13:58:00.000Z	Spikemcc	Ileden	try ati catalyst 9.4 on ubuntu hardy heron 8.04.3 LTS
2009-07-24T14:00:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	I don't feel like it's a good idea to downgrade my system. I guess I'll have to fish for another diplay adapter. :-/ But if 9.04 does have the opne source driver, and i's listed as sproviding full 3d support, shouldn't it work?
2009-07-24T14:02:00.000Z	Spikemcc	Ileden	just don't expect 3d gaming ...
2009-07-24T14:02:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	not expecting - I'd get a better card for that. I'd like to get google earth and such, only.
2009-07-24T14:03:00.000Z	Ileden	Spikemcc	yeah, as long as I got it to work...
