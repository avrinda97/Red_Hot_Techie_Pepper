2010-01-10T19:30:00.000Z	komputes	Darkfault	ubuntu support in general
2010-01-10T19:34:00.000Z	komputes	Darkfault	did you write down the exact error message?
2010-01-10T19:37:00.000Z	Darkfault	komputes	No I started crying that I will have to reinstall both ubuntu distros, and went to bed, and today I woke up and it works
2010-01-10T19:38:00.000Z	komputes	Darkfault	ok, next time when you see a grub error message, write it down and report it later. When you boot you may have a choice of many kernels to start from. more info here:
