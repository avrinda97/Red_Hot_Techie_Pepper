2007-01-01T17:34:00.000Z	Aar0n444		I know I need a command to boot ubuntu on my laptop, and I used to have it working, along with my WiFi card too. But now, I try one or two commands and the WiFi card won't work. What commands could I try to boot?

2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	Aar0n444		On my laptop, I've installed using 'pci=noacpi' and that's all fine. Just my NIC doesn't work. It's not even recognised. Any ideas?
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	Aar0n444		Yeah
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	what type of laptop?
2007-01-01T09:38:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	hmm... no experience with an Acer
2007-01-01T09:40:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	install linux-headers
2007-01-01T09:41:00.000Z	Aar0n444	peacekpr	How, when I'm trying to do this so i CAN connect to the net
2007-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	why did you use pci=noacpi ?
2007-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	wouldn't boot meaning it wouldn't detect the hard drive?
2007-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	hmm... not the issue was thinking... if it was your hard drive, i'd suggest using "pci=nomsi" and give it a whirl
2007-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	not going to promise it will work, but worth a shot :)
2007-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	Aar0n444	peacekpr	no luck.
2007-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	bummer
2007-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	and you said you can't get into your BIOS to mess with the power saving options?
2007-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	google turned up no help, eh?
2007-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	dunno what that means ;)
