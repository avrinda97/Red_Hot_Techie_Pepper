2008-04-09T21:57:00.000Z	Danish989		but I'm going to be new at linux and I don't want to try beta software
2008-04-09T21:58:00.000Z	Danish989		Hardy has been in beta for some time now, so i guess it should be stable when it releases in 15 days?
2008-04-09T21:59:00.000Z	Danish989		lol .. I'm still a noob at linux so I just took a guess
2008-04-09T21:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	generaly , once the "official" is released it is stable enough, specialy since we are talking about an LTS
2008-04-09T22:21:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	yes it is,  but bad idea,  I'm no noob and I regret the move
2008-04-09T22:23:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	realy not stable enough yet,   FF3 is quirky, wine also ( but that might just be wine) , no vwmare package yet,   honestly it's not worth the upgrade at this point, wait for the stable
2008-04-14T05:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	you'll need to boot the live cd to do it , you can't do it on a running hard drive
2008-04-14T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	you donT' see the grub menu when you boot your computer ?
2008-04-14T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	it's not finding your ubuntu partion and the /boot/grub folder on it ,  the easiets way I know to fix that is to get the super grub cd and use that to tell it where it is
2008-04-14T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	hold on I 'm gettin hyou a link
2008-04-14T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	join me in grub
2008-05-02T05:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	he probably gets an command prompt , x fails to load because of a bad drier
2008-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	I don't even know what a busybox is , I 've never seen one
2008-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Danish989	Pelo	It's a pain in the ass, that's what it is
2008-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	when do tyou get this , during hte install ?
2008-05-02T05:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	when ?
2008-05-02T05:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	have you recently upgraded ?
2008-05-02T05:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Danish989	try booting the recovery mode ,that's all I can suggest
