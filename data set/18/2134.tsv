2010-09-05T06:26:00.000Z	lnewlfe		im just lookin to get my soundcard to work man lol
2010-09-05T06:26:00.000Z	lnewlfe		...or woman...
2010-09-05T06:27:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	was there ever sound?
2010-09-05T06:27:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	try and reboot: sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic
2010-09-05T06:30:00.000Z	lnewlfe	ilovefairuz	how do you "reply" to a specific person like you are doing to me?
2010-09-05T06:34:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	reboot, run alsamixer, run something that makes sound and toggle controls around alsamixer to check their effect
2010-09-05T06:46:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	yes
2010-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	what are you trying to test sound with? did you install restricted extras?
2010-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	lnewlfe	ilovefairuz	i havnt installed any restricted extracts, and i tried to test sound with alsamixer like you suggested, tweaking levels. I assume it would make a "ping" noise when changed...
2010-09-05T06:57:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	no it doesn't make any sounds by itself..
2010-09-05T06:57:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	told you to run something that makes sound like a music player, AND then tinker with alsamixer
2010-09-05T07:02:00.000Z	lnewlfe	ilovefairuz	no, still no sound, at least from youtube videos...
2010-09-05T07:03:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	unmute (M key) and max everything in alsamixer
2010-09-05T07:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	individual controls could be muted too
2010-09-05T07:23:00.000Z	lnewlfe	ilovefairuz	if i switch off jack detect i am now getting a slight hum from speakers, but that is it. I tried every combo of on/off and i cant get sound to work
2010-09-05T07:24:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	are you running karmic or lucid?
2010-09-05T07:29:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	lnewlfe	try the lucid live cd
