2009-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	sebas		Anybody around who can tell me where flash does send its sound?
2009-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	sebas		I've sound working for skype and the KDE apps but flash is silent
2009-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	sebas		Removed all pulse from my system to make sound work at all
2009-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	sebas		Is it possible to use flash with sound without pulse?
2009-05-22T18:01:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	what version of flash?
2009-05-22T18:04:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	whatever's shipped with jaunty
2009-05-22T18:10:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash
2009-05-22T18:12:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	thanks, looking at it
2009-05-22T18:12:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	that doesn't even have info for jaunty ... it worked fine on older distros
2009-05-22T18:13:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	look at the troubleshooting section
2009-05-22T18:14:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	flash 10 uses pulseaudio
2009-05-22T18:15:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	maybe the old 9 version
2009-05-22T18:18:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	or read this http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup
2009-05-22T18:18:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	I want to get *rid* of pulse, not have what Lennart thinks is perfect
2009-05-22T18:20:00.000Z	HoldenC	sebas	i see but doesn't seem a clever choice to
2009-05-22T18:20:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	pulse doesn't work, clever or not
2009-05-22T18:23:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	I'll give up for now, I'm getting frustrated and that's not helpful when trying to sort this out. I'll be at UDS next week and complain in person :)
2009-05-22T18:23:00.000Z	sebas	HoldenC	thanks for the friendly help anyway
