2005-10-23T08:28:00.000Z	djjason		is there a way to enable the remote desktop in command line
2005-10-23T08:29:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	do you want to set up a cron job to enable vnc at certain times?
2005-10-23T08:31:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	I just want to enable vnc so I can connect to the machine via vnc...and currently I can ssh into the machine
2005-10-23T08:31:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	so thats why I was asking about command line
2005-10-23T08:33:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	the remote desktop is not currently enabled but I want to enable it. Currently I only have ssh access to the machine.....so normally I would just enable vnc access by going to remote desktop in System preferences....but since I dont have vnc access...how can I enable it on the remote machine if I have ssh access
2005-10-23T08:34:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	ok, now I see what you need.  The suggestions I had won't work, but let me look for a moment and see if I can see what to do.
2005-10-23T08:51:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	are you still around?
2005-10-23T08:51:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	yes
2005-10-23T08:54:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	Sure that would be helpful
2005-10-23T08:56:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	there are several keys to be changed.  They are all under   desktop/gnome/remote_access     The main ones are enabled, prompt_enabled, view_only and vnc_password
2005-10-23T08:57:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	ok thanks alot...I will take a look at this...
2005-10-23T08:58:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	do you have a local Ubuntu system so you can play with those settings?  That would probably make it go faster.
2005-10-23T08:59:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	yeah I do......
2005-10-23T09:00:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	do you know how to edit gconf through ssh or do you want me to track that down?
2005-10-23T09:00:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	no no no need......I can manage that...
2005-10-23T09:02:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	thank you very much for your help
2005-10-23T09:03:00.000Z	Severian	djjason	sure, check back if that does not work.  I have not changed the settings that way, but it looks like it should work.
2005-10-23T09:03:00.000Z	djjason	Severian	will do
