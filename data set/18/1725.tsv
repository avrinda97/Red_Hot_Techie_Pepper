2010-12-29T14:58:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	ok im back
2010-12-29T14:58:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	just had to make sure that grub actually came up since i removed burg
2010-12-29T15:05:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	i think it will overwrite the partly finished installation... but im not sure
2010-12-29T15:06:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	well your guess is as good as mine i suppose
2010-12-29T15:06:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	yep :)
2010-12-29T15:08:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	do u think the uuid of my recovery partition would be different than the one of the os partition?
2010-12-29T15:08:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	i think it would
2010-12-29T15:09:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	i swear i had to edit a different file when i did this before
2010-12-29T15:09:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	try sudo blkid
2010-12-29T15:09:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	what exactly are you trying to do now? restore grub?
2010-12-29T15:10:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	no im trying to bring back the listing for my windows recovery partition, and when i had to modify grub before because it had the wrong partition code for windows, i swear it was more straight forward simple than this.
2010-12-29T15:11:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	ok
2010-12-29T15:11:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	also when i run the command u gave me, it list a recovery partition
2010-12-29T15:11:00.000Z	rs0832	glitchd_	yes
2010-12-29T15:13:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	ok ill try that then
2010-12-29T15:15:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	i jus did update-grub and it still only found 1 windows partition
2010-12-29T15:20:00.000Z	glitchd_	rs0832	woot_woot ok im gonna reboot to see if i did it right, brb hopefully with a happy face.
