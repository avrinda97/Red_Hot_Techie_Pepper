2010-09-03T07:43:00.000Z	danes_		hello, Im new to servers and I am barely starting. I want to know if it is possible to run ubuntu in live mode as if it would be a pc using a ubuntu server edition cd in a eserver x335?
2010-09-03T07:44:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	The normal isos sure wont give you that option
2010-09-03T07:45:00.000Z	danes_	etherealite	well, is there something I could do?
2010-09-03T07:47:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	you could try booting the normal desktop iso and installing apache to the ramdisk.
2010-09-03T07:50:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	also try resising your main partition on the server with gparted to make room for a test install
2010-09-03T07:50:00.000Z	danes_	etherealite	well, I am having some problems since it is not similar to a pc, and I am doing my research...
2010-09-03T07:51:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	by pc you mean windows?
2010-09-03T07:51:00.000Z	danes_	etherealite	not precisely I cannot find any option to boot from CD :S
2010-09-03T07:52:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	server iso file doesn't have the option
2010-09-03T07:52:00.000Z	danes_	etherealite	I am trying with a desktop ISO
2010-09-03T07:53:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	is it the 10.4 release?
2010-09-03T07:53:00.000Z	danes_	etherealite	yes
2010-09-03T07:53:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	then its there, its called something like "try ubuntu without installing" or something to that effect.
2010-09-03T07:54:00.000Z	danes_	etherealite	thanks for your help, but I mean, I cannot find how to select the cdrom drive to boot first
2010-09-03T07:55:00.000Z	danes_		mtpbios-im5
2010-09-03T07:55:00.000Z	etherealite	danes_	well that beyond the area covered by this channel
