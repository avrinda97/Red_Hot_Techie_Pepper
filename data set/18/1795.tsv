2011-07-20T07:37:00.000Z	optimad		hey guys really basic question, If i upgrade from 'upgrade manager d' from 10.04 to 11.04, will all my compiz and internet /drivers all still stay and work?
2011-07-20T07:37:00.000Z	optimad		I'm on a laptop and it took me awhile to get things running like internet, etc
2011-07-20T07:39:00.000Z	optimad		If you upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04, are all your settings preserved such as internet drivers, graphic drivers, etc????
2011-07-20T07:40:00.000Z	nit-wit	optimad	should be but you can back all that up including imaging 10.04 just to be safe.
