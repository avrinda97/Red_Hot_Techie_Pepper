2007-12-04T07:03:00.000Z	matttis		what happened to my kaffeine player ? It doesn't play anything... same with totem
2007-12-04T07:03:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	what does it do, just freeze up?
2007-12-04T07:04:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	yeah, freezes
2007-12-04T07:04:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	i had a similar problem with rhythmbox...it wouldnÂ´t play any songs or anything
2007-12-04T07:05:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	what did you do ?
2007-12-04T07:05:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	for rhythmbox, i had to enable this verbose thinger lol it was confusing as all hell
2007-12-04T07:06:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	i do not know if kaffeine uses gstreamer...does it?
2007-12-04T07:06:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	i think so
2007-12-04T07:07:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	ok, one second...
2007-12-04T07:08:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	ok, what program are you having a problem with? kaffeine?
2007-12-04T07:08:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	kaffeine and totem
2007-12-04T07:08:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	ok...type in terminal: kaffeine --gst-plugin-spew then restart your system, it should work...it worked for me
2007-12-04T07:11:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	but you used it with another programm right ? kaffeine doesnt know that option
2007-12-04T07:12:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	check totem --help-all and see if there is gstreamer options
2007-12-04T07:13:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	seems to be a sound daemon problem
2007-12-04T07:13:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	oh...well i dont know anything about that :/
2007-12-04T07:14:00.000Z	matttis	Ongaku	with which program did you use your option ?     and what do you mean with "via places" ? the button next to the k menu ?
2007-12-04T07:15:00.000Z	Ongaku	matttis	i used it with rhythmbox...and via places i mean places in between system and apps
