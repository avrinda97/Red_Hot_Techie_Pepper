2008-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	ToastGuy_		I have a series of commands I need to execute using a on a schedule... I understand I will use a cron job to execute the schedule... what do I do about the commands?
2008-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	ToastGuy_		I know in windows it would be something like a Batch file

2008-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	a simple shell script does the same thing as a batch file...
2008-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	ToastGuy_	mdemocritus	ah, Shell Script... I've heard that term before... thanks
2008-03-11T11:56:00.000Z	ToastGuy_	mdemocritus	are there a GUI for creating a cron job in ubuntu?
2008-03-11T11:57:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	i would imagine there's several, but i don't know any off the top of my head
2008-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	try searching in the synaptic package manager or add/remove for cron
2008-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	simple shell scripting is really easy... create a file, add the commands, one per line, and make sure the file has execute permissions
2008-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	add "#!/bin/bash" or "#!/bin/sh" to the top of the file (without quotes)
2008-03-11T12:01:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	you can use regular expressions and logic and all that complicated bs, but if you just want to run a few commands at once, there's nothing special to do
2008-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	here's a really nice guide for shell scripting http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html
2008-03-11T12:05:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	yes, as long as the systems you'll be running it on all have bash... nearly all linux distros have it
2008-03-11T12:07:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	check out that link i gave if you want to do more complicated stuff than just run explicit commands... bash is very powerful at scripting... cgi uses perl, which is another scripting language, hence the similarities
2008-03-11T12:08:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	right
2008-03-11T12:09:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	if you're not using bash syntax, technically you don't need the bang at the top (#!/bin/bash), but get in the habit of it, as it is good practive
2008-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	cd to the directory and run ./script.bash or whatever, or run it with the absolute path
2008-03-11T12:26:00.000Z	mdemocritus	ToastGuy_	to make it executable, the command is chmod u+x /path/to/file.bash
