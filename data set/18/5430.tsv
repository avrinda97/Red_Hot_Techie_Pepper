2009-04-04T21:23:00.000Z	darkvertex		anyone can point me to any good gnome programming books?
2009-04-04T21:23:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	: learnC++ and looks for stuff on GTK
2009-04-04T21:25:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	_CommandeR_: well I know a little bit about c++, its the gnome specific libs usage that I'm trying to find out :P
2009-04-04T21:28:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	you need to learn the system language first that would be C++ and then anything you can on GTK+ cause thats the frame ork most commonly used in gnome
2009-04-04T21:32:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	:  I went to gnome.org and saw "GTK+ / Gnome Application Development".  Are there any better or newer books that you can recommend?
2009-04-04T21:33:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	... im not aware of many development books for linux/oss stuff
2009-04-04T21:35:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: right ... thanks anyway
2009-04-04T21:35:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	: what are you wanting to accomplish any how
2009-04-04T21:36:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: I like to learn how to convert a program from SDL to gnome is all
2009-04-04T21:37:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: a smallish game
2009-04-04T21:40:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: There is this an old game called netwalk, which runs fine under SDL when compiled in ubuntu. I just want to learn to convert it into gnome, since there is a KDE based netwalk in kubuntu.
2009-04-04T21:40:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	: what dev skills you got that you are good with to work with
2009-04-04T21:41:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: Just as an exercise. I already know c and c++. Did some programming under wind0ze and such
2009-04-04T21:43:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	if your just looking for a frame work to convert it to your going to hav to learn GTK and if you looking for a more updated solution to SDL your gonna have to learn OpenGL
2009-04-04T21:45:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: I wish you could point me to some books on GTK+ and gnome, for reference purposes
2009-04-04T21:46:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	hit barns and noble and search these is litterly only 4 books on the subject
2009-04-04T21:46:00.000Z	slacker_	darkvertex	http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Foundations-of-GTK-Development/Andrew-Krause/e/9781590597934/?itm=1  word press normally does good job
2009-04-04T21:46:00.000Z	darkvertex	slacker_	: will do that. thanks for your info
