2008-02-06T19:41:00.000Z	Photo1		Sorry about the sad smiley, just need to change keymap :)
2008-02-06T19:43:00.000Z	Photo1		A quick question - I'm installing Ubuntu over my age old SUSE 10.0 - will it replace GRUB with a boot menu that recognizes the other OSes on my PC?
2008-02-06T19:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	Yes
2008-02-06T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	I dont understand that question.. xp cant read ext3 by default without ext2ifs
2008-02-06T19:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	The installer will let you format partitions to whatever you want.. but you need to rephrase your question about what all you want to do.  brb
2008-02-06T19:49:00.000Z	Photo1	Jack_Sparrow	Current issue: Can only transfer files from Linux to XP, XP doesn't see it. Do I need to do something special in the Ubuntu installer for XP to see it?
2008-02-06T19:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	You cannot make windows see ext3 without a driver in windows
2008-02-06T23:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	YO mean a copy of your xorg.conf ?
2008-02-06T23:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	When you say monitor config, which file are you refering to
2008-02-06T23:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	So the file you want to edit and or copy is xorg.conf right
2008-02-06T23:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/Desktop/Jacks-Notes/xorg.conf.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)   will create copy on your desktop
2008-02-06T23:50:00.000Z	Photo1	Jack_Sparrow	(in xorg.conf)
2008-02-06T23:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	I have told you a few different times.. you would need to do it in xorg
2008-02-06T23:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	That indicates you have not set the v/h rates correctly for your monitor
2008-02-06T23:57:00.000Z	Photo1	Jack_Sparrow	No, the ones in Gnome are incorrect. My modelines were generated from a system tool called PowerStrip.
2008-02-06T23:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	Sorry cant help you
2008-02-07T18:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Photo1	it looks for the cd, since the cd is still in your list.. go to synaptic - repos and de-select it
