2007-07-22T11:59:00.000Z	Nemes	unimatrix9	how? I cant find nothing at "Users and Groups"
2007-07-22T12:00:00.000Z	unimatrix9		nemes , i think you boot up the user you like to use and set language there
2007-07-22T12:01:00.000Z	unimatrix9	phixnay	there is an program called smartbootmanager that can be run from floppy to boot cdrom
