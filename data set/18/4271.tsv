2009-09-12T02:21:00.000Z	fccf	six	the second link explains how
2009-09-12T02:23:00.000Z	fccf	six	that doesn't sound right
2009-09-12T02:28:00.000Z	fccf	six	failed download .. or you wrote to the file i.e. touched while it was writing ... either way download again
2009-09-12T02:28:00.000Z	fccf	six	should be 700megs ish
2009-09-12T02:29:00.000Z	six	fccf	i am not sure of the options in the page which one i need
2009-09-12T02:30:00.000Z	six	fccf	i have a PC with no hdd, so i want to run ubuntu from a usb drive for a while
2009-09-12T02:31:00.000Z	six	fccf	but under the second link there are some options
2009-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	fccf	six	read the instructions here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
2009-09-12T02:42:00.000Z	fccf	six	persistant means it writes to the USB disk .... get it
