2011-03-28T20:50:00.000Z	eoin_	divamiller	Try sigil...
2011-03-28T20:52:00.000Z	eoin_	divamiller	take a look at sigil and calibre for e-book creation and management, respectively.
2011-03-28T20:53:00.000Z	divamiller	eoin_	the point is i don't know programming
2011-03-28T20:55:00.000Z	divamiller	eoin_	now how do i design my book cover
2011-03-28T20:57:00.000Z	eoin_	divamiller	Depends, calibre can do it automatically, or you could design on yourself in any image editor (like the gimp, for example)
2011-03-28T20:57:00.000Z	divamiller	eoin_	which app do you recommend calibre or sigil
2011-03-28T20:58:00.000Z	eoin_	divamiller	sigil to create books (epub format) caliber to manage and convert books.
2011-03-28T20:59:00.000Z	eoin_	divamiller	epub is several html files all archived together...
2011-03-28T21:01:00.000Z	eoin_	divamiller	like I said you can convert to any other format with calibre.
