2011-07-02T09:17:00.000Z	nicolas		After restart system wont launch shotwell, I have updated sources, reinstalled from source and still no luck, any thoughts?
2011-07-02T09:19:00.000Z	confezzor	nicolas	did you try to uninstall it and than reinstall it again before doing it from source
2011-07-02T09:20:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	that was my first plan of action, still no luck, so I got the newest ppa source and tried that, last resort was from source
2011-07-02T09:23:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	after seaching and seeing some complaint about shotwell with AMD 64 I thought that might be my prob, but it ran before just fine
2011-07-02T09:25:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	- yup
2011-07-02T09:25:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	the shotwell viewer works, but not the manager
2011-07-02T09:28:00.000Z	confezzor	nicolas	you can check out this one
2011-07-02T09:29:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	- awesome, I will check them out - thanks

2011-07-02T10:23:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	I like the dark table, but still wanting to fix this version of shotwell, you have any ideas that I could try?
2011-07-02T10:31:00.000Z	confezzor	nicolas	did you download all the dependencies for shotwell
2011-07-02T10:33:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	- 64 bit

2011-07-02T10:40:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	worked out of the box, I tried importing some photos and it crashed, after restart the launcher and app were all still there, but it is like its a dead link
2011-07-02T10:46:00.000Z	nicolas	confezzor	no beans, still dead
