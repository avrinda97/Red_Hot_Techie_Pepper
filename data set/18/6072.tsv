2008-07-06T22:43:00.000Z	Fryguy--	army	why are you sure he's using fakeraid?
2008-07-06T22:45:00.000Z	army	Fryguy--	for one reason, the device is only a sata-controller and two they never build hardware controllers in the segment and third I inspected enough of those devices to know this is fakeraid
2008-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	army	Fryguy--	another hint, start looking into the driver
2008-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	army	my controller card implements pure hardware raid, why can't his?
2008-07-06T22:47:00.000Z	army	Fryguy--	my controller card also implements it, but they're somewhat more pricy
2008-07-06T22:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	army	how much did tommck pay for his?
2008-07-06T22:48:00.000Z	army	Fryguy--	but hardware raid is something for in a SAN, for normal situations software a better solution
2008-07-06T22:48:00.000Z	army	Fryguy--	list price is about 115 a 125
2008-07-06T22:49:00.000Z	Fryguy--	army	there are plenty of pure hardware cards in that space.  Mine happened to cost significantly more than that, but i digress
