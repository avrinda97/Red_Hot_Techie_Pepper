2007-03-31T07:57:00.000Z	sanityx		why would 6.06 boot fine on a system, where 6.10 fails? Don't newer versions usually work better?
2007-03-31T07:57:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	if only that were true... :)
2007-03-31T08:31:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	well maybe so, but the newer versions should at least support newer hardware . . .
2007-03-31T08:31:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	and break some of the older in the process - it's not like this never happened before... new kernels, new bugs
2007-04-28T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	i disagree. but in any case, that doesn't mean offtopic stuff should be brought here.
2007-04-28T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	aquarius: or you could use the minimal cd
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	Is the minimal cd like the debian web based install cd
2007-04-28T09:52:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	and where do i get it
2007-04-28T09:52:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	yes but smaller (just 8 megs). it's linked from the page the bot gave
2007-05-04T05:46:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	no, fairly madly unsafe
2007-05-04T05:46:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	Really?
2007-05-04T05:46:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	Well I know that 2 days ago proposed updates fixed my iPod.
2007-05-04T05:46:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	i've no idea why they're even listed in the GUI. yes, really. i tried to fix someone's broken systems more than once, due to using the proposed updates. there's a reason they're just "proposed"
2007-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	well you could just have waited a couple more days until they had been tested and put in the actual updates. if you like to run risk, that's fine, but proposed updates are mostly *lacking testing*, and might break things badly
2007-05-04T05:48:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	Well let me ask you this. If I remove that repository, adn then apt-get update apt-get upgrade, will it downgrade the packages?
2007-05-04T05:49:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	Actually it is trivial.
2007-05-04T05:49:00.000Z	LjL	sanityx	depends who's doing it, adding a repository to sources.list is far from trivial for quite a few people.
2007-05-04T05:50:00.000Z	sanityx	LjL	Oh right, ntfs-3g isnt in the main repositories. I always forget that since I always add all the extra repositories right away
