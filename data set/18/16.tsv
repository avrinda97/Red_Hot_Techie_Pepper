2005-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	jdub	Evaso	you're probably better off asking daniels
2005-02-21T17:23:00.000Z	Evaso	jdub	i running debian from several years, but i installed ubuntu as the first linux distro for a medium skills windows user
2005-02-21T17:23:00.000Z	Evaso	jdub	all works fine but one weeks ago motherboard crashed
2005-02-21T17:24:00.000Z	Evaso	jdub	he changed the motherboard in a computer shop, then at home power up the pc with the new motherboard and ubuntu boot up fine/all works fine
2005-02-21T17:26:00.000Z	Evaso	jdub	but some days ago the nvidia card crashed then he was gone on the pc shop bought a base video card (ati), mounted on the pc, then he go to home, power up the pc and naturally X won't start
2005-02-21T17:27:00.000Z	jdub	Evaso	run 'dpkg-reconfigure --priority=high xserver-xfree86'

2005-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	Evaso	jdub	i know how to do that and i fixed it, but do u tink that is a good choiche for a newbie medium user that approach to ubuntu go to console and run 'dpkg-reconfigure --priority=high xserver-xfree86'?
2005-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	jdub	Evaso	no, and we'll fix that eventually
2005-02-21T17:29:00.000Z	Evaso	jdub	i want to help you with this (and also for debian) how can i do?
2005-02-21T17:29:00.000Z	jdub	Evaso	it's a hard problem, and one we might come back to for our next release; right now, we're focusing on fixing bugs :)
