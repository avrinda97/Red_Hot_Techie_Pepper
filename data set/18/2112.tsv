2011-09-10T04:01:00.000Z	axel		Hallo!
2011-09-10T04:01:00.000Z	axel		I try to encrypt a partition with luks but it doesn't seem to work:
2011-09-10T04:01:00.000Z	axel		sudo cryptsetup -c aes-xts-plain -s 512 luksFormat /dev/sda2
2011-09-10T04:03:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	I think you have to use -s 256 since it does it twice or something
2011-09-10T04:03:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	And you forgot what you want it named
2011-09-10T04:04:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	sudo cryptsetup luksFormat -c "aes-xts-plain" -s 512 /dev/sda2 LUKS01
2011-09-10T04:04:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	Or something like that
2011-09-10T04:04:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	it will show up in /dev/mapper/LUKS01
2011-09-10T04:08:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	Sorry. It didn't work.
2011-09-10T04:10:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	Did you try it with -s 256?
2011-09-10T04:11:00.000Z	rypervenche	axel	And what is it showing when you try the command?
2011-09-10T04:11:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	Yes, I tried that, too.
2011-09-10T04:11:00.000Z	axel		Nothing.
2011-09-10T04:11:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	Nothing.
2011-09-10T04:17:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	I've got it. I've read to fast:
2011-09-10T04:17:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	"Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes):"
2011-09-10T04:17:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	I've typed "yes" istead of "YES".
2011-09-10T04:18:00.000Z	axel	rypervenche	Thank you for your help. But sorry for disturbing you with such a mistake of mine.
