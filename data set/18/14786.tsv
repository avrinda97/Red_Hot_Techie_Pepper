2005-07-25T11:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	the file is /etc/apt/sources.list; you can also use synaptic (system -> admin -> synaptic) to change you sources
2005-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	there are some pages on the wiki to help you with repositories
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	oh, you're on kubuntu *oops*
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	i think 'kate' might be in the default install
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	'sudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list'
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	you can try vi, but it's a bit rough going for new users; if kate doesn't work, try 'sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list'
2005-10-12T13:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	joe_	sudo /etc/init.d/samba start
2005-10-12T14:01:00.000Z	joe_	HappyFool	thanks
