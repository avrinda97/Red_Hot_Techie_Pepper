2008-06-01T01:37:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		'lo. I just did an upgrade on linux [apt-get upgrade] and now all of a sudden grud fails to see my windows installation. On top of this, my xserver has crashed... I need to fix the windows problem first though....
2008-06-01T01:39:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		sudo
2008-06-01T01:40:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	Do you just need to put Windows back in your /boot/grub/menu.lst or what are you looking for?
2008-06-01T01:41:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	Yeah. Basically. I'd like that. Like, when I installed it did that for me, so I'd rather have an automated program, than have to guess where the file is.
2008-06-01T01:42:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	Well, I don't know of any GUIs for Grub (if you find a good one let me know), but I could give you the syntax to put in that menu.lst to get Windows going.
2008-06-01T01:43:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	I would love that.. Thing is I have like 5 harddrives.. so I'm not in a guessing mood :D
2008-06-01T01:44:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	No problem, first "sudo fdisk -l" and look for the Windows partition (ntfs).
2008-06-01T01:45:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	I'll look in fstab.. I have it mounted just remembered lol..
2008-06-01T01:45:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	fdisk -l doesn't pick it up.
2008-06-01T01:46:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	You have to put sudo in front--did you do that?
2008-06-01T01:48:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	That should be enough. Do you have an sdaX? In other words, is sdbX your second drive or something?
2008-06-01T01:49:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	Yeah.. Second drive... First drive has a borked and old copy of windows installed, sdb1 has this linux os and the working windows OS
2008-06-01T01:49:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	So Windows is on your second HD, on the first partition? Is that corrrect?
2008-06-01T01:50:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	Yes.
2008-06-01T01:51:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Stevethepirate	OK, just add the following in your /boot/grub/menu.lst and it should work, assuming your Windows is OK: http://pastebin.com/d3829ccf4
2008-06-01T01:52:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	Soz, I can't open up graphical stuff [xserver is broken]
2008-06-01T01:53:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	To clarify, I'm also behind a university firewall with a random ISA proxy, so I can't even use lynx / links :(
2008-06-01T02:09:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Steve-Cal	Nope, doesn't work... :(
