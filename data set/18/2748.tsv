2010-03-03T09:34:00.000Z	kyle2		is there a proper channel to get help with network printing?
2010-03-03T09:34:00.000Z	kyle2		Im trying to get cups running, I did it a few weeks ago before i was forced to reinstall. The first time, in the end, all I needed to do was to change the listening port from loclhost to * then I ran a single cups command that enabled network printing. For the life of me I can't find that command again. Any one have any ideas?
2010-03-03T09:35:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	cups can easily be handeled in Ubuntu Gui
2010-03-03T09:35:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	let me demonstrate
2010-03-03T09:35:00.000Z	brandon__		kyle2:
2010-03-03T09:36:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	on the host PC (PC with printer to be shared) go into printing from System > Admin > Printing
2010-03-03T09:36:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	Tell me when done
2010-03-03T09:36:00.000Z	kyle2	brandon__	done...
2010-03-03T09:37:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	You should see a window that says Printer Configuration - Local Host
2010-03-03T09:37:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	Click Server > Settings
2010-03-03T09:38:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	Click Server > SettingsThen Check (Show Printers, Publish Shared Printers, Allow Printing from the Internet, Allow Remote Admin then hit ok
2010-03-03T09:38:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	State when done
2010-03-03T09:38:00.000Z	kyle2	brandon__	there it is
2010-03-03T09:39:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	Also make sure under Server > connect you have (Without Quotes "/var/run/cups/cups.sock"
2010-03-03T09:40:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	then on the Pc's to be hooked up check mark Server > Setting > (Show Printers Shared By other Systems, Allow Printing From Internet)
2010-03-03T09:40:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	Then your other pcs should detect the printer on the same network automatically
2010-03-03T09:41:00.000Z	kyle2	brandon__	thank you sir
2010-03-03T09:41:00.000Z	brandon__	kyle2	 No Problem, printing was my hardest step in learning ubuntu, but its actually quite simple
