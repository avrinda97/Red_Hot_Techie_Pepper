2007-04-16T08:21:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	nv with an Nvidia GeForce 6200. When booting from liveCD, it did the same thing...should i try another driver? the propietary?
2007-04-16T08:22:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	new card, ive installed ubuntu with an ATI card, but now ive switched to nvidia to have dual monitors with beryl....
2007-04-16T08:24:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	the nvidia card with the nv driver, even in livecd mode...
2007-04-16T08:24:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	im downloading the nvidia-glx driver, lets see if it works. What do you think?
2007-04-16T08:29:00.000Z	Nachtengel	qatsi	the glx stuff works pretty well with my 6800
2007-04-16T08:30:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	what driver are you loading with your xorg.conf, the "nvidia" driver ?
2007-04-16T08:33:00.000Z	Nachtengel	qatsi	you still here?
2007-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	yes, i think the nvidia-glx driver worked.,...
2007-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	nope, im working on that....maybe 10 or 15 minutes with beryl running on dual screen :)
2007-04-16T08:38:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	yes, first the normal setup, then the eye candy :)
2007-04-16T08:38:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	ok, thanks for the tip...
2007-04-16T08:55:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	twinview isnt working
2007-04-16T08:58:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	forget it, now i have dual monitors with direct rendering...ill go ahead with beryl...
2007-04-16T09:16:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	it works great!!!!!
2007-04-16T09:17:00.000Z	qatsi	Nachtengel	at last i have dual monitors with beryl....ati sucks big time with drivers...though i have to admit, the card is great...
