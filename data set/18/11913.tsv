2006-08-30T09:42:00.000Z	wsg		OK, wow, just tried Ubuntu 6.06 DVD release, sucks how to discover the new Gnome ability's
2006-08-30T09:43:00.000Z	wsg		Anyone got screenshots of the new gnome in action ?
2006-08-30T09:44:00.000Z	wsg		Anyone got URL'sto the new gnome "screenshots" ?
2006-08-30T09:46:00.000Z	wsg		dont see screenshots there ?
2006-08-30T09:48:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	that has a lot of modifications done to it. If you want the base look of it, might want to try to find something else
2006-08-30T09:50:00.000Z	wsg	bruenig	yea, I know, I have OSX running on a INTEL PC, be nice to get Linux with the look, linux provides better "Support" but OSX is nice to try .
2006-08-30T09:51:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	check out dreamlinux. Looks nearly identical http://www.dreamlinux.com.br/english/saiba-screen.html
2006-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	wsg	bruenig	"sweet" like to install Ubuntu with that look.
2006-08-30T09:54:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	if you do like dreamlinux I would caution you in using it as a lot of the documentation is in portugeese
2006-08-30T09:54:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	oh yeah, that would take quite a bit of work
2006-08-30T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	that is xfce, ubuntu uses gnome, you could use gdesklets if you want for the dock but it won't look as polished as that
2006-08-30T09:56:00.000Z	wsg	bruenig	this looks sweet ?  http://art.gnome.org/preview.php?image=screenshots/gnome214/CompizCubeEffect.png
2006-08-30T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	xgl and compiz, that is a headache
2006-08-30T10:00:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	that is compiz, that is a seperate thing from gnome altogether perhaps it will be integrated into the next gnome, kind of doubt it
2006-08-30T10:00:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	use that link but be really careful, you could mess a lot up
2006-08-30T10:02:00.000Z	wsg	bruenig	"Linux Pro Magazine" shows it as part of Gnome and part of the Dapper Release, Includes the Dapper Drake ubuntu on a DVD for you... So I got to disagree, they say it's in Gnome now
2006-08-30T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	ok well then why aren't you doing it
2006-08-30T10:04:00.000Z	bruenig	wsg	perhaps because it doesn't exist by default, you need to add things but you already are certain it is integrated which since it is, all of those people who wrote that guide must be retarded, I mean you wouldn't write a guide to do something that already exists by default
