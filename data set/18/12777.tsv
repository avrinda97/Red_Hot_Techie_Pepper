2007-12-24T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	why not use the original oggenc??
2007-12-24T03:21:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	no particular reason. i just think that if ffmpeg claims to support ogg vorbis, it just should work correctly :)
2007-12-24T03:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	what command line are you using?
2007-12-24T03:22:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	ffmpeg -i rnrrobot.wav -ab 160k -vn rnrrobot.ogg
2007-12-24T03:22:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	it picks the bitrate correctly, and displays it. but then uses a different one when encoding
2007-12-24T03:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	well everything seems ok dunno why it fails... maybe there's some ffmpeg specific channel...
2007-12-24T03:24:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	yup, but they don't support packaged versions
2007-12-24T03:25:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	take a look at http://pastebin.ca/830357
2007-12-24T03:25:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	see at line 13, it says 160 but then at line 17 you see the actual bitrate
2007-12-24T03:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	i've done a little research you have to use "-aq n" with n between 10 and 30 -ab will be ignored by the ogg encoder
2007-12-24T03:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	ffmpeg -i input.wav -acodec vorbis -aq 50 output.ogg
2007-12-24T03:28:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	can you give a me link where it says that? i've been looking for 3 days!
2007-12-24T03:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	i've just closed the firefox window... hold on
2007-12-24T03:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t48898.html
2007-12-24T03:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	they say that the quality of the encoder is low... you are better using oggenc
2007-12-24T03:32:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	thanks *a lot*, that helps a lot
2007-12-24T04:09:00.000Z	^Useless^	erUSUL	well, thanks again for your help, i am making some tests and oggenc actually encodes much better. plus i am really surprised by the Vorbis quality even at very low bitrates!
2007-12-24T04:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	^Useless^	glad to be helpfull XD
