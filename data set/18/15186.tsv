2006-03-09T10:53:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	that is one big old page :)
2006-03-09T10:55:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	do you want to preserve your windows install ?
2006-03-09T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	ok, identify which partitions have the windows stuff you want to save
2006-03-09T10:58:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	then, what's left?
2006-03-09T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	and, as mustard5 said, back that stuff up
2006-03-09T11:00:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	do you care if those partition's data are lost forever?
2006-03-09T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	then, use those partitions for installing ubuntu. It'll boot windows for you just fine when you're done
2006-03-09T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	iG-Shoot-Me	the steps are pretty simple, just repetitive: select a partition, set it as root. Select another partition, set it as swap. Continue thru install
