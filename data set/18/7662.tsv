2008-01-10T21:35:00.000Z	vishal		Hi, Im trying to assign 2 mouse buttons to initiate rotate cube, but it only accepts one, it did work before but no longer works?
2008-01-10T21:36:00.000Z	viking	vishal	try the #compiz-fusion channel
2008-01-10T21:36:00.000Z	vishal	viking	just came from there, no one there
2008-01-10T21:37:00.000Z	viking		oh ok... ya wasn't that populated earlier either
2008-01-10T21:37:00.000Z	vishal	viking	i managed to do it before but its wont accept it anymore, weird
2008-01-10T21:40:00.000Z	viking	vishal	I am looking at it now... I will let you know if I get it.
2008-01-10T21:41:00.000Z	vishal	viking	thank you
2008-01-10T21:47:00.000Z	viking		veshal: well that was interesting. I was rotating the cube and used some keys to freeze it then couldn't unfreeze it to get it back to normal and had to reboot.
2008-01-10T21:48:00.000Z	vishal	viking	does cccm allow you to put 2 buttons in to the button field?
2008-01-10T21:49:00.000Z	viking		veshal: well all I have seemed to accomplish so far is bind it to <alt>Button1... can't even get it to go back to the <Ctrl><Alt>Button1
2008-01-10T21:49:00.000Z	viking	vishal	couldn't tell you honestly. Still learning it myself.
2008-01-10T21:50:00.000Z	vishal	viking	double click and broom it, when i put in button8+button9 it saves it as button8 on its own
2008-01-10T21:50:00.000Z	vishal	viking	yeah im pretty new aswell, anyway no worries, i'm gonna try manually edit the ini file ;)
2008-01-10T21:50:00.000Z	viking	vishal	ya, same thing with the <Ctrl><Alt> for me
2008-01-10T21:51:00.000Z	viking	vishal	where's the ini saved?
2008-01-10T21:51:00.000Z	vishal	viking	~/.config/compiz/compizconfig
2008-01-10T21:52:00.000Z	vishal	viking	hmm its nearly empty lol
2008-01-10T21:52:00.000Z	vishal	viking	bak in a bit
