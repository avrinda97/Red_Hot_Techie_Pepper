2008-02-29T08:44:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x		I am having a lot of issues, but they've only developed recently.
2008-02-29T08:45:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	Could you be more specific?
2008-02-29T08:46:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	(1) every time I start the laptop, most of the stuff on the panels freezes... when I restart them, nm-applet never comes back
2008-02-29T08:47:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	(2) I have system sounds, pidgin sounds, but no sounds in games or audacious.
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	(3) and ntos_wq seems to be eating approx. 3-5% of my CPU...
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	(1) You'll probably have to delete your .gconf and .gconf2 folders and go back to a default GNOME configuration. I'm sure there are other ways, but they're difficult at best.
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	(2) Are you using anything like, say, Pulse Audio?
2008-02-29T08:49:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	(1) OK, I'll do what i can regarding that.  (2)  No, I use ALSA.  And it worked until just yesterday.
2008-02-29T08:50:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	(3) I don't know what that is. D:
2008-02-29T08:50:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	yeah, most I've talked to have no idea.
2008-02-29T08:50:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	(2) Do you have a lot of things configured to use ESD or OSS?
2008-02-29T08:51:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	not a thing, actually.
2008-02-29T08:51:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	So they're all calling ALSA... or should be.
2008-02-29T08:52:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	yup.  If I start, say, Audacious from terminal, I get a message about the device not being available.
2008-02-29T08:52:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	Sounds like something is using ALSA that shouldn't be.
2008-02-29T08:53:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	ugh.  That's what I was hoping you wouldn't say.
2008-02-29T08:54:00.000Z	yaro	xTheGoat121x	Try to find what else uses ALSA on your system and kill it before using the "offending" applications.
2008-02-29T08:55:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	yaro	I will do what I can.
