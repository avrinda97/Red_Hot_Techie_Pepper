2008-08-10T06:58:00.000Z	paradizelost		howdy all
2008-08-10T06:58:00.000Z	paradizelost		i'm trying to install 8.04 on an Nvidia 680i RAID, and ubuntu only sees 2 separate hard drives
2008-08-10T06:58:00.000Z	paradizelost		anyone know where i should look?
2008-08-10T06:59:00.000Z	paradizelost		benny, that's not an address, that's a server
2008-08-10T06:59:00.000Z	paradizelost		you'd use /server irc.whatnet.org
2008-08-10T07:00:00.000Z	paradizelost		the standard irc port IIRC
2008-08-10T07:01:00.000Z	paradizelost		anyone have experience installing 8.04 on an nvidia 680i raid?
2008-08-10T07:01:00.000Z	paradizelost		SuSe works out of the box
2008-08-10T07:01:00.000Z	paradizelost		but i don't want suse...
2008-08-10T07:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	paradizelost	no, but if you are interested in trying some neat drivers (probably with NDISWrapper) I might be able to tell you site to download them
2008-08-10T07:02:00.000Z	paradizelost	gaelfx	 umm ndiswrapper is for wifi drivers isn't it? :P
2008-08-10T07:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	paradizelost	it's a different raid driver than nvidia gives, but it's supposed to be better
2008-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	paradizelost	you can use it for other drivers too
2008-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	paradizelost	ndis is just a prog to make the driver think it's running in win, doesn't matter that much what the driver is for
2008-08-10T07:04:00.000Z	paradizelost	gaelfx	the fakeraid will probably do the trick
2008-08-10T07:04:00.000Z	gaelfx	paradizelost	ooh, haven't heard of that, do you have url for it?
2008-08-10T07:05:00.000Z	paradizelost	gaelfx	 it's one of the links that Sylphid sent
2008-08-10T07:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	paradizelost	ah, cool, got it, thanks
