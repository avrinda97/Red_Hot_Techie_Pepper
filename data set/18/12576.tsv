2006-04-02T11:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	this is quiet
2006-04-02T11:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	irssi also hightlights if so configured
2006-04-02T11:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	try typing /help in irssi :)
2006-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	it does if you run ivman or gnome-volume-manager
2006-05-04T10:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	only if the ISP does not block 25 outgoing
2006-05-04T10:53:00.000Z	harisund	thoreauputic	Oh ISP's can do that too? How do I verify that?
2006-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	ask the ISP I guess :)
2006-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	harisund	thoreauputic	Good idea :) Wonder why I din't think of that before.
2006-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	mine blocks 25 outgoing but allows you to opt out if you wabt
2006-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	harisund	thoreauputic	oh ok. Thanks ...
2006-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	mind you , there isn't much point for most people
2006-05-04T10:56:00.000Z	harisund	thoreauputic	oh ok. I was just curious. I have a webserver, SSH server, FTP server, and all that .. but not the email one and wanted to have one of those too :)
2006-05-04T10:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	well, if you run a mail server make sure you know what you are doing, or your ISP will be very upset with you ;)
2006-05-04T10:57:00.000Z	harisund	thoreauputic	Really? Wow .. thanks for the warning :) Maybe I shouldn't be overambitious
2006-05-04T10:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	I suggest you forget it unless you have a specific reason to do it, frnakly
2006-05-04T10:58:00.000Z	harisund	thoreauputic	Well, I wanted an email server to be able to send out stuff, not receive any. But I think I will follow your advice.
2006-05-04T10:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	you can send whatevr you like through the ISP mail server - so why bother ?
2006-05-04T11:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	harisund	there are whole IP blocks blacklisted as "residential" or "dynamic" etc
