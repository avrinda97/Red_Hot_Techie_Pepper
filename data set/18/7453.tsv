2008-01-13T19:02:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	what does that mean?
2008-01-13T19:02:00.000Z	erawfish	Ruud	you really wnat to have only read-only access to that usb stick?
2008-01-13T19:04:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	what should my options be instead of what I typed??
2008-01-13T19:04:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	I want to try: defaults,noauto,umask=007,gid=1000
2008-01-13T19:04:00.000Z	erawfish	Ruud	"ntfs" can only do read-only access
2008-01-13T19:07:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	as I tried the options like I showed now I get: "You are not privileged to mount the volume 'TargetDrive'."
2008-01-13T19:08:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	using "ntfs-3g" made some scary noises but still no mount!!!
2008-01-13T19:08:00.000Z	erawfish	Ruud	"user" is missing
2008-01-13T19:08:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	should I add uuid:1000
2008-01-13T19:09:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	Ok! getting somewhere but still no mount
2008-01-13T19:10:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	Before I didn't need the mountpoint to exist, do I now?
2008-01-13T19:13:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	Created the dir, but now I get: "fuse: failed to open /dev/fuse: Permission denied FUSE mount point creation failed Unmountin /dev/sdc1 (TargetDrive)"
2008-01-13T19:16:00.000Z	erawfish	Ruud	what perms does /dev/fuse have? does mounting as root work?
2008-01-13T19:18:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	permissions to /dev/fuse are rw rw none. Mounting as root is done in what way??
2008-01-13T19:19:00.000Z	erawfish	Ruud	man sudo. and permissions include the ower and group
2008-01-13T19:20:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	You want me to manually mount the drive?
2008-01-13T19:25:00.000Z	Ruud	erawfish	I don't have the time today anymore.... I plugged the drive into my windows laptop and it works :P (like it once did in ubunto as well)
