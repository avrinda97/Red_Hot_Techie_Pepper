2010-05-23T19:20:00.000Z	tmas		I have a MacBook Pro with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and rEFIt. When it boots, it goes to the rEFIt menu. I select Ubuntu and it goes to a black screen with a white underscore-style cursor. I can't type any commands. Oh, my install CD was perfectly good, MD5 matched.
2010-05-23T19:20:00.000Z	tmas		Please help.
2010-05-23T19:21:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	can you boot to the cd and have everything work?
2010-05-23T19:23:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	is this a fresh install (first time booting to it) or has it worked previously and has recently stopped working?
2010-05-23T20:19:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	please correct me if I'm wrong: using rEFIt, you're trying to boot from /dev/sdb, right?
2010-05-23T20:21:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	I'm not familiar with rEFIt, but the website specifically says "This is not explicitly supported by rEFIt at this time" (primarily because the author doesn't have a suitable test system and can't verify it), though Apple's Boot Camp FAQ says it should be feasible.
2010-05-23T20:22:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	okay, well, for that the website says that this is not well-supported by Apple's firmware.
2010-05-23T20:23:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	the boot CD is able to install to drives that the computer is unable to boot to
2010-05-23T20:26:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	you said the console was blank/black with a flashing cursor ... that tells me it never found the linux kernel itself and therefore the boot process isn't making it that far
2010-05-23T20:26:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	... which is consistent with the (paraphrased) statements "it is quirky in the firmware and I haven't been able to test it well"
2010-05-23T20:28:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	it may be possible using initrd images and such, but I'm certainly not a pro at that and I'm not even positive rEFIt supports that. (An initrd image loads enough drivers into memory -- without access to the actual root filesystem -- so that the kernel can get started and itself find the root drive that the boot manager couldn't.)
2010-05-23T20:29:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	I have not looked into it, but is it feasible to use grub instead of rEFIt? My quick 15-sec of surfing leads me to believe rEFIt won't do it for you.
2010-05-23T20:30:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	simplest way to start learning is to google "grub mac" and go from there ... you're not the first to do it :-)
2010-05-23T20:31:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	I've been able to boot to a USB drive on a computer whose firmware didn't support it ... it took a little initrd magic (that I can't remember offhand and am not colocated with it anymore), but it was certainly feasible.
2010-05-23T20:33:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	huh?
2010-05-23T20:33:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	okay, I'm out ... haven't read about that yet
2010-05-23T20:34:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	yes ... and I agree with compaq in that they all have one.
2010-05-23T20:35:00.000Z	r2pashto	tmas	... they may just make it harder to know much about it. (I like Apple's stuff but their tactics are sometimes suspect *shrug*)
