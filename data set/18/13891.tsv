2007-01-30T15:36:00.000Z	ndlovu		any suggestions how to find the device path of a USB device? I can see it in lsusb, but I need to address it as /dev/???
2007-01-30T15:37:00.000Z	ndlovu		The device is recognised in lsusb as "Bus 001 Device 003: ID 051d:0002 American Power Conversion Back-UPS Pro 500/1000/1500"
2007-01-30T15:37:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	"lsusb" just shows what is connected, not whether a driver is loaded for it. What kind of device?
2007-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	it's a ups
2007-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and note any messages as you plug the usb in
2007-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	s/usb/ups/
2007-01-30T15:39:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	it does say which driver was loaded... lemme check...
2007-01-30T15:40:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	does this answer any questions? "hiddev96: USB HID v1.10 Devic
2007-01-30T15:41:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	it's a pointer...
2007-01-30T15:41:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	"registered new driver usbhid"
2007-01-30T15:42:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	it's probably one of the devices in /dev/input/
2007-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	try 'ls -lrt /dev/input' to see which was most recently created
2007-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	all at the same time, the last system startup - before plugging in the UPS
2007-01-30T15:45:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	there is a package to support USB-connected UPSs:
2007-01-30T15:46:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	hmm, tried "ls -lrt /dev/ | grep 10:" and got vcs7 and vcsa7 at about the right time
2007-01-30T15:47:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	I've installed apcupsd, which should be able to do more or less the same thing (I think)
2007-01-30T15:48:00.000Z	ndlovu	soundray	ah. just found /dev/usb/hiddev0. will try that
2007-01-30T15:49:00.000Z	soundray	ndlovu	it doesn't explicitly mention USB though. Check the docs in /usr/share/doc/apcupsd/
