2005-07-09T10:47:00.000Z	blueyed		what's better? sharing a fat32 partition between winXP and Ubuntu or an ext3 (I have a driver for XP that can read/write ext3)?
2005-07-09T10:48:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	the fat32 method is better  (depend on windoze for nothing)
2005-07-09T10:48:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	are you wanting to access the drive from windoze and linux?
2005-07-09T10:50:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	then i'd recommend the fat32 method (i don't want windows having the ability to read/write to my linux stuff)
2005-07-09T10:50:00.000Z	blueyed	nalioth	it would be a shared partition, just for data..
2005-07-09T10:50:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	then fat32 i'd recommend
2005-07-09T10:54:00.000Z	blueyed	nalioth	bluefoxicy, Hentai: this is the driver: http://www.fs-driver.org/download.html - it was reviewed in the german c't magazine.
2005-07-09T10:54:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	bluefoxicy i dont recommend enabling windows to read/write to your linux stuff
2005-07-09T10:55:00.000Z	blueyed	nalioth	as said, it's just a data partition thingie.
2005-07-09T10:57:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	using only linux, ext3 is great, but having other non-*nix OS' sharing is diffecult
2005-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	copy what?
2005-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	blueyed	nalioth	I meant ChurcH_of_FoamY.
2005-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	church is learning atm
2005-07-11T09:46:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	that is a very good question
2005-10-24T14:16:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	have you checked your md5s on the disc?
2005-10-24T14:17:00.000Z	blueyed	nalioth	k3b has checked them before burning, will do it now with the image.
2005-10-24T14:17:00.000Z	nalioth	blueyed	yes ubuntu likes to be burned sloooowly for tasty ubuntu goodness
2005-10-24T14:22:00.000Z	blueyed	nalioth	damn, the .iso torrent was not completely received by azureus.. another one has finished and I did not look close enough.. %-/
