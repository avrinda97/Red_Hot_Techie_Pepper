2011-01-06T22:23:00.000Z	crawler		hi there.  what is the terminal command equivalent to reloading/refreshing the nautilus desktop? in other words, when i focus on a nautilus window, what happens internally when F5 is pressed?
2011-01-06T22:24:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	Well you'd have to look at the source code to know that.  It probably makes some calls similar to ls (I'm not sure if it actually makes kernel calls or if it calls ls or if there is something that both ls and nautilus F5 use)
2011-01-06T22:25:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	What is the ultimate goal here?
2011-01-06T22:27:00.000Z	crawler	edbian	 well, i'm making a bash script that does many things, one of which uses sed to search within a .desktop file to change the icon.  it works all well, but the icon doesn't refresh until i use f5
2011-01-06T22:28:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	Ahhh, so you wanna force that right away...
2011-01-06T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	yeah, the real problem is that there is no API for nautilus (that I know of)
2011-01-06T22:30:00.000Z	crawler	edbian	yea, it would complete my script :-)  i tried a couple of methods, on was xrefresh (doesn't seem to work at all) the other used gconftool-2 to toggle the showing of the nautilus desktop (which crashed nautius).  so yea, i'll need to find another way to do this.  i posted in nautilus' IRC channel, but no reply yet
2011-01-06T22:31:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	there is an API for C and python!  http://projects.gnome.org/nautilus-python/

2011-01-06T22:31:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	I suggest you switch your script to python (probably will make the whole thing easier)
2011-01-06T22:33:00.000Z	crawler	edbian	ahh, well i don't know if i have the time to learn python, i'm just barely starting to learn bash..but thanks for pointing me in the right direction
2011-01-06T22:33:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	sure.  have fun learning!
2011-01-06T22:36:00.000Z	crawler	edbian	this looks promising: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1063300
2011-01-06T22:37:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	Yes it does.
2011-01-06T22:38:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	sending the F5 signal is a good idea
2011-01-06T22:38:00.000Z	crawler	edbian	yes, i guess now the only problem is somehow bringing focus to nautilus
2011-01-06T22:49:00.000Z	crawler	edbian	got it!! wmctrl -k on xsendkeycode 71 1 xsendkeycode 71 0  (focus the desktop, press F5, release F5) thanks again for your input, i could not have done it without you
2011-01-06T22:49:00.000Z	edbian	crawler	haha, I didn't do anything!  good job :)
