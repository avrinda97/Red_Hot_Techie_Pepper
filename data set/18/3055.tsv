2010-08-17T06:43:00.000Z	st__		hibernate is suspend-to-disk
2010-08-17T06:44:00.000Z	st__		how can I format the disk so it's UUid would stay the same?
2010-08-17T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 you can set the UUID with the tune2fs command aferwards if you want to.
2010-08-17T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 tune2fs --help --> the -U option
2010-09-05T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 if they are written properly they would disable the feature for the dependencies not installed.. but some programs require some dependencuies to function.. so proberly not.
2010-09-05T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 use the build-deps feature of apt.. and it  can normally grab them all. if the progam is allready in the repos
2010-09-05T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 now you know why  the package manager binaries is perffered over 'source'
2010-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 its normal here. i see mesages about that all the time
2010-09-22T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 modules get loaded as needed. thats one of the main points of modules
2010-09-22T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 the hardware 'system' watever that is.. loads them for the proper devices as needed normally.
2010-09-22T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 'dmesg' will mention devices seen, that may not even have linux support or modules loaded for them.
2010-09-25T11:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 depends on your needs..
2010-09-25T11:39:00.000Z	st__	Dr_Willis	does qcad do dwgs?
2010-09-25T11:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 no idea. I dont need that feature
2010-09-25T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 so...
2010-09-29T22:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 what modules are you refering to?
2010-10-02T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	st__	 i recall the last release (or 2 releases ago) they trimmed down the # of kernels.  Never paied much attention to smp or other kernel features. I would guess its built into the defaults now.
2010-11-20T15:39:00.000Z	st__	Dr_Willis	never
