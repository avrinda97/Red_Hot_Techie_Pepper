2011-01-01T17:55:00.000Z	sresu_		How do I start crond daemon??
2011-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	Should already be installed.
2011-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	Yes, it is. Im asking about starting it
2011-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	See crontab -i
2011-01-01T17:57:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	crontab: usage error: file name must be specified for replace
2011-01-01T17:57:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	Correction:  crontab -l   (not -i)
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	No crontab for user. Don't you know about the change that crontab is been made system wide?
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	cat /etc/crontab
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	Oh, no, I guess not.
2011-01-01T18:00:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	It says - /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab' command to install the new version when you edit this file and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields, that none of the other crontabs do.
2011-01-01T18:00:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	You can't just do   crontab -e  ?
2011-01-01T18:00:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	I just want to start it
2011-01-01T18:01:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	I do not think  you need to start it.
2011-01-01T18:02:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	Maybe there is an error in the script?  Show us.  Pastebin the output of crontab -l
2011-01-01T18:03:00.000Z	usr13	sresu_	Have you tested them?
2011-01-01T18:03:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	One moment
2011-01-01T18:06:00.000Z	sresu_	usr13	geirha: Yes I tested that last script - gadmin one, its running. cat /etc/crontab - http://pastebin.com/H0uyaEM4
