2010-07-18T13:18:00.000Z	troopperi		evelyette:sudo apt-get dist-upgrade <- terminal
2010-07-18T13:19:00.000Z	evelyette	troopperi	well I just installed it, but I would rather run dist-upgrade
2010-07-18T13:20:00.000Z	troopperi		evelyette:hope you have fast internet connection, its might take time
2010-07-18T13:22:00.000Z	evelyette	troopperi	what's the name of the ubuntu distro, that doesn't install X server by default ?
2010-07-18T13:23:00.000Z	troopperi		evelyette:do you mean latest version?
2010-07-18T13:23:00.000Z	evelyette		no
2010-07-18T13:23:00.000Z	evelyette		a fresh installation
2010-07-18T13:24:00.000Z	evelyette	troopperi	there's fluxbuntu, xubuntu ...
2010-07-18T13:25:00.000Z	troopperi	evelyette	its just ubuntu, there is many variations with lightweight desktops etc. xubuntu is with xfce and kubuntu is with kde
2010-07-18T13:26:00.000Z	evelyette	troopperi	would you recommend ubuntu for a server...so far I was running gentoo, but grew tired of it
2010-07-18T13:26:00.000Z	troopperi		!alternate
2010-07-18T13:26:00.000Z	evelyette		and I would like to install freebsd, ubuntu, debian, or some other, but don't know which one to pick
2010-07-18T13:27:00.000Z	troopperi	evelyette	when you etc. install ubuntu, you can install virtualbox and test there what is your favorite distro.
2010-07-18T13:28:00.000Z	evelyette		well I don't know if I can trust ubuntu for possible break-in attempt
2010-07-18T13:31:00.000Z	troopperi	evelyette	do you have your own server running?
2010-07-18T13:33:00.000Z	evelyette	troopperi	yes
2010-07-18T13:35:00.000Z	troopperi	evelyette	have you readed this? http://www.ubuntu.com/server/features
