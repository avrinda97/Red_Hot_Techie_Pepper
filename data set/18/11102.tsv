2006-09-18T06:09:00.000Z	bbrazil		which VTs?
2006-09-18T06:10:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	im talking about console, ctrl+alt+F1 etc, switching from desktop
2006-09-18T06:12:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	the consoles are known as virtual terminals (VTs)
2006-09-18T06:12:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	something up with /etc/inittab?
2006-09-18T06:13:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	check for stuff in syslog, possibly about respawning too fast. Is there a blinking cursor in the top left?
2006-09-18T06:15:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	the only repeating message in /var/log/messages is "Sep 18 12:04:40 localhost kernel: [17190674.996000]  sr 1:0:0:0: Device not ready"
2006-09-18T06:16:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	that's scsi iirc
2006-09-18T06:17:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	try sudo init q
2006-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	nothing happens :o
2006-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	however, i found out that if i press enter a few times in the blank screen, my X shuts down, or restarts
2006-09-18T06:23:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	that's quite odd, I'm not sure what's happening. do gettys show up in ps aux ?
2006-09-18T06:25:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	try crtl-q
2006-09-18T06:26:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	ulfar    tty1     -                12:25    5.00s  0.23s  0.21s -bash
2006-09-18T06:26:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	so it's working?
2006-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	well... screen is blank
2006-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	but i can login, ye lol
2006-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	ulfar	bbrazil	well, lunch, bbl thanks for the help
2006-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	bbrazil	ulfar	anything else running on that tty?
