2010-06-07T23:51:00.000Z	bhawna		hi, my /etc/fstab loads the d drive but I can not write into the drive , any help?
2010-06-07T23:52:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	paste your /etc/fstab on paste.ubuntu.com and highlight which one is the d drive
2010-06-07T23:53:00.000Z	bhawna	cousteau	here it is -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/446254/
2010-06-07T23:54:00.000Z	bhawna	cousteau	/media/sda5 is d drive
2010-06-07T23:55:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	I have a FAT32 drive and the options line is "utf8,umask=000,fmask=111,gid=46,shortname=mixed"
2010-06-07T23:55:00.000Z	cousteau		dunno which of them are included in the current one
2010-06-07T23:55:00.000Z	bhawna		well let me try with your options
2010-06-07T23:57:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	to test it:   sudo umount /dev/sda5; sudo mount -a
2010-06-08T00:00:00.000Z	bhawna		what is gid 46?
2010-06-08T00:00:00.000Z	bhawna	cousteau	what is gid 46?
2010-06-08T00:01:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	group id = 46, it means that the owner of the disk is the "plugdev" group
2010-06-08T00:01:00.000Z	cousteau		maybe it's different on other machines... no idea
2010-06-08T00:03:00.000Z	bhawna	cousteau	well it worked for now
2010-06-08T00:03:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	glad to hear that :)
2010-06-08T00:04:00.000Z	bhawna	cousteau	I will reboot and get back to you, I have a bad experience to see things stop working after reboot
2010-06-08T00:07:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	so?
2010-06-08T00:07:00.000Z	bhawna	cousteau	thanks pal, it worked this time, I have spent more than 4 hours on it :-)
2010-06-08T00:07:00.000Z	cousteau	bhawna	great! you're welcome
