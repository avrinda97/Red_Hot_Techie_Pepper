2008-03-26T11:40:00.000Z	sap		What is the difference between "make clean" and "make distclean" ?
2008-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	distclean will remove cache files etc... and will remove your makefile
2008-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	it returns it to the state it was for distribution
2008-03-26T11:42:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	brent113 so will using both make clean and make distclean equivalent to uninstall ?  i guess not ?
2008-03-26T11:43:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	not even remotely. no.
2008-03-26T11:43:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	oh I thought brent113 meant that
2008-03-26T11:43:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	make clean/distclean has nothing to do with any install binaries
2008-03-26T11:44:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	btw I also went into the source folder and did make uninstall... and it displayed some code .. so has my previos pidgin version been uninstalled?
2008-03-26T11:44:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	probably... if not... why do you care?
2008-03-26T11:45:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	so u mean just continue running with the latest version whilst leavign the old one there?
2008-03-26T11:45:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	the new one will have overwritten the old one
2008-03-26T11:45:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	no it didnt , i used the /opt directory for the new one .. dunno where the old one was?
2008-03-26T11:46:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	well just make sure you run the one from opt and you'll be fine... unless you're worried about hdd space
2008-03-26T11:46:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	yeah i changed the path in applications to the new path
2008-03-26T11:47:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	u mean i create my own .deb ?
2008-03-26T11:48:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	and my .deb would remove the old version ?
2008-03-26T11:48:00.000Z	sbingner	sap	if it was installed by a .deb yes
2008-03-26T11:49:00.000Z	sap	sbingner	yeah i learnt it that one has to remember the location while installing for a good and efficient removal
