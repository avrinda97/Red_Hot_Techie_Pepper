2008-05-03T10:04:00.000Z	opop	keith	it's in each folder's properties.  i did notice a lot of that configgy stuff is gone--where's the dialog to change my video driver?  gone
2008-05-03T10:05:00.000Z	keith	opop	Are you referring to Screens and Graphics?
2008-05-03T10:05:00.000Z	opop	keith	yeah, i think
2008-05-03T10:05:00.000Z	opop	keith	sounds familiar.  did they move it?
2008-05-03T10:05:00.000Z	keith	opop	That was moved to Applications->Other
2008-05-03T10:06:00.000Z	opop	keith	i'm not seeing it
2008-05-03T10:06:00.000Z	keith	opop	look in System->Preferences->Main Menu, it might be hidden
2008-05-03T10:07:00.000Z	opop	keith	i'll be durned.  thanks.
2008-05-03T10:07:00.000Z	keith	opop	Why it is there, I haven't the foggiest...
2008-05-03T10:08:00.000Z	opop	keith	remote desktop viewer....ha!  they hid "report a problem..."
2008-05-03T10:09:00.000Z	keith	opop	I think some of that is influenced by Debian... not sure to what extent though
2008-05-03T10:10:00.000Z	keith	opop	lol... it wasn't hidden in the beta or whenever  it first changed... that is the only reason I knew...
2008-05-03T10:11:00.000Z	opop	keith	well, danke.
2008-05-03T10:12:00.000Z	keith	opop	Bitte ;)
2008-05-03T10:17:00.000Z	opop	keith	it should have been "insidious iguana"
2008-05-03T10:18:00.000Z	keith	opop	lol... I'm still not sure what an Ibex is...
2008-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	keith	opop	lol... I guess they will need a new wallpaper for it since a heron isn't too similar to an Ibex...
