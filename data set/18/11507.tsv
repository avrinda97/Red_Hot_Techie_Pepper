2007-07-26T11:09:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dr_willis	yes they do
2007-07-26T11:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	zoidberg_	 can they ping each other? (network testing 101) :)
2007-07-26T11:10:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dr_willis	i'm not sure...how can i check
2007-07-26T11:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	zoidberg_	 ping ip#.oif.the.machines
2007-07-26T11:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	zoidberg_	 then - you DID isntall ssh on the machines?
2007-07-26T11:11:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dr_willis	both of these machines connect to this other linux computer on campus via ssh
2007-07-26T11:11:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dr_willis	however i didnt install anything on them...i just installed feisty out of the box
2007-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dr_willis	do i need to install an ssh server on both?
2007-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	zoidberg_	 then you dont have a ssh server installed on them yet.
2007-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	zoidberg_	 the ones you wan tto ssh to.. yes
2007-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	zoidberg_	 may as well put it on both. :)
2007-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dr_willis	ok i thought that was the problem...what is the name of the ssh server package so that i can download it from apt?
