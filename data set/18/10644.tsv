2007-01-11T15:21:00.000Z	rohan		hi .. what program does ubuntu use to automatically configure laptop keys ?
2007-01-11T15:22:00.000Z	rohan		thanks a lot, stefg
2007-01-11T15:23:00.000Z	rohan		but how do kubuntu and ubuntu do it automatically / they use keytouch ?
2007-01-11T15:24:00.000Z	rohan		because i want to use ubuntu's method to set up my hotkeys in other distros
2007-01-11T15:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	Just use your Ubuntu xorg.conf in your other distro, AFIK it should work and that is where hot keys would be configured, but I am not 100% sure
2007-01-11T15:25:00.000Z	rohan	Jordan_U	will try .. thanks a lot
2007-07-13T15:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	They don't just see and add each other's kernels?
2007-07-13T15:30:00.000Z	rohan	Jordan_U	no, unfortunately not .. they both want to keep the other outside the autoconfig are
2009-07-12T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	The server kernel can support up to 16 GIG of RAM, though any one app can only access 4 GIG at a time
2009-07-12T11:25:00.000Z	rohan	Jordan_U	ah ok, so server kernel has PAE enabled, but not the generic kernel?
2009-07-12T11:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	Yes
2009-07-12T11:26:00.000Z	rohan	Jordan_U	are there any disadvantages of using the server kernel on a general "desktop" system?
2009-07-12T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	None that I know of, PAE itself slows things down if you don't need it ( though obviously you do ) and there may be other tweaks that are slightly detrimental to Desktops but I don't think there is anything that won't work with -server and the performance difference is probably negligable
2009-07-12T11:30:00.000Z	rohan	Jordan_U	ok, thanks a lot, i will try the server kernel then.
2009-07-12T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	If you don't have your heart set on Ubuntu Fedora 11 actually uses a 64 bit kernel on 64 bit CPUs even in the 32 bit version, which is the ideal thing to do ( 64 bit kernels work fine with fully 32 bit userland )
2010-11-04T10:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	sudo apt-get install rtorrent
2010-11-04T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	Now rtorrent is installed.
2010-11-04T10:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rohan	Why not use rtgui or rtpg-www? They are both available in the repositories.
