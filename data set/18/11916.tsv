2008-02-25T21:17:00.000Z	steven_		hi, after I installe the nvidia restricted driver on Xubuntu 7.1 AMD64 the text size shrunk in everything and even when I decrease the resolution it statys  small.  help please
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	You could try going into your display settings and change the font size, but probably what happened is that your resolution got changed to something besides 96dpi which is the default for most monitors.
2008-02-25T21:20:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	can't quite find where to do that it xfce
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	in xfce, it's under Settings>User Interface Settings
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	Oh sorry, that's for changing the font size.... which won't fix your problem
2008-02-25T21:23:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	that fixed it in most places but text in apps like xchat is still small
2008-02-25T21:23:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	you might need to restart xchat for things to take effect. Can you restart X and come back in and tell me if everything stayed the same?
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	ok one sec
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	still small text in the pane that shows the ongoing conversation
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	did you close xchat?
2008-02-25T21:26:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	yes, for some reason this seems only to happen in xfce but not gnome
2008-02-25T21:27:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	This happened to me on my laptop. Before we change the dpi resolution, try to change the refresh rate around in XFCE>Settings>Screens and Graphics
2008-02-25T21:30:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	how's that working out? I am gonna go take a smoke break, I'll be back in 10.
2008-02-25T21:30:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	the only resolution that made any difference was going down to 320x240 and then the text just got big and blurry
2008-02-25T21:31:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	Don't change the resolution, change the refresh rate, say if you are running, 50 Hz, try 53 and so on... one of them might make a difference
2008-02-25T21:32:00.000Z	neeto		I am trying to run MAME, and even with no controller/keyboard plugged in, something seems to be stuck pointing up, because when I get into the menu, the selection is scrolling to the next item faster and faster, and it accellerates. This seems to happen on xmame, sgl-mame, xmess and even the windows version of mame running over wine. does anyone have any ideas as to how to fix this?
2008-02-25T21:33:00.000Z	steven_	neeto	went down to 50 Hz and up to 110 Hz still no change
2008-02-25T21:34:00.000Z	neeto	steven_	word, we will have to change the dpi resolution. Sorry to leave you hanging, but I'll be back in 10 minutes. Try asking someone else how to change your dpi resolution back to 96.
