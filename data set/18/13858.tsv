2005-10-08T08:28:00.000Z	cius		anyone know how to get an Intel ICH5's  surround functionality to work properly?
2005-10-08T08:28:00.000Z	cius		damn rear channel is silent as my dead grandmother
2005-10-08T08:28:00.000Z	cius		sound debug wiki didn't help
2005-10-08T08:29:00.000Z	tristanmike	cius	try alsamixer but play around with the "Wave" settings
2005-10-08T08:30:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	I've played around with alsamixer till I'm sick in the head and I can't get the rear channels to peep
2005-10-08T08:31:00.000Z	tristanmike	cius	I couldn't either, untill I played with "Wave", I would never have even touched it untill, well, unitll I came here
2005-10-08T08:32:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	I'm just looking at it now and it appears I don't even have a "wave" option...
2005-10-08T08:34:00.000Z	tristanmike	cius	I have "Wave", "Wave Surnd" and other stuff like that, untill I raised the bar on those, I had no rear speakers
2005-10-08T08:34:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	I'll try to play around some more.  I have a lot of different settings in there, but none of them say anything about wave.  I'll look again though, just to make sure.
2005-10-08T08:35:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	I appreciate your help.

2005-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	found something interesting, I've got a setting called Exchange front/surround, its default off, but when i turn it on, my front channels go out and my rears come on...
2005-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	cius	do you have a "fader" button on your speakers, may have to toy with that, it always goes out on me without my knowledge
2005-10-08T08:44:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	AH!  found it! a setting with the obscure name "spread front to suround and center/LFE.  now all speakers work.  But, I though LFE was supposed to be some kind of software surround, not hardware...  maybe I don't know my own chipset well enough.
2005-10-08T08:44:00.000Z	cius		there was supposed to be an end quotation in there somewhere...
2005-10-08T08:44:00.000Z	tristanmike	cius	see, that was my problem, like why would "Wave" control my surround, oh well, it does
2005-10-08T08:45:00.000Z	cius	tristanmike	yea, I suppose the important thing is that it now works.  thanks again for you help!
