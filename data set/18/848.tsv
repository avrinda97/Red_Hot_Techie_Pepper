2011-12-15T19:18:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	explaine please?
2011-12-15T19:20:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	I will check it out now. just need a backgroud how it is done (That's why I wanted a Exe compiler)
2011-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	seriously ill get kicked, but basically task scheduler allows to run any program as superuser, without the uac prompt popping up, by making a shortcut
2011-12-21T00:48:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	google vmdk to iso
2011-12-21T00:49:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	Googled, no help there
2011-12-21T00:50:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	this is the first result http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/convert-vm-iso
2011-12-21T00:50:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	Look http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/convert-vm-iso and Look http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/convert-vdi-vmdk None of them worked.
2011-12-21T00:55:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	sounds like that patch is the problem (if its not installing)
2011-12-21T00:55:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	its not, It doesnt even find it in the packetkit
2011-12-21T00:55:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	any other way to help me around?
2011-12-21T00:57:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	if you can access the vmdk from a vboxed windows it might be easier
2011-12-21T01:00:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	There is a way to make the vm VB mount it in the system itself, I saw it throw Google but I had a problem with the old version of VB there (witch didnt help me with my version)
2011-12-21T01:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	oh so you trying to get vbox to mount it?
2011-12-21T01:02:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	i know theres a vmware converter for windows idk if it makes iso or not
2011-12-21T01:03:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	try what ssta said
2011-12-21T01:04:00.000Z	GaRRu	Gentoo64	Well I need it for everything, not only mounting it. The mounting thing is the only way I see that I can convert it to ISO file. Its mostly for just making the images Iso. (as you know vmdk doesnt work on all systems)
2011-12-21T01:06:00.000Z	Gentoo64	GaRRu	no its to convert vmdk to vdi, which vbox can read
