2009-06-12T21:33:00.000Z	ddaygold		what are the big diffrences between KDE, GNOME, and the one for xubuntu
2009-06-12T21:33:00.000Z	ddaygold		ya
2009-06-12T21:35:00.000Z	ddaygold		i've heard that KDE is supposed to be "windows like" and GNOME is "Mac like"... is that true?
2009-06-12T21:36:00.000Z	ddaygold		i know "windows like" is not the most loved term in the ubuntu community... but still, it has the same layouts?
2009-06-12T21:36:00.000Z	JabberWalkie	ddaygold	really, you can make it have whatever layout you want, with a bit of work of course
2009-06-12T21:37:00.000Z	ddaygold		so i was told wrong, thanks
2009-06-12T21:37:00.000Z	ddaygold		pretty much anything is better than windows... (vista)
2009-06-12T21:39:00.000Z	JabberWalkie		lets say I upgrade to 9.04 and I dont like it, is it possible to downgrade back to 8.04??
2009-06-12T21:39:00.000Z	JabberWalkie		ahh, fiar enough
2009-06-12T21:39:00.000Z	JabberWalkie		*fair
2009-06-12T21:39:00.000Z	ddaygold	JabberWalkie	why would u want to downgrade?
2009-06-12T21:40:00.000Z	JabberWalkie	ddaygold	in case I dont like 9.04
2009-06-12T21:40:00.000Z	JabberWalkie	ddaygold	also, i have had bad experiences upgrading other linux distros that totally broke my system
2009-06-12T21:41:00.000Z	ddaygold	JabberWalkie	9.04 is great, it starts in like 20 seconds and feels just like any (recent) other version
2009-06-12T21:42:00.000Z	ddaygold		ya, that would be a problem
2009-06-12T21:43:00.000Z	ddaygold	JabberWalkie	the only real reason i upgraded was to take advantage of the insanely fast startup
2009-06-12T21:43:00.000Z	ddaygold	JabberWalkie	i haven't found much diffrence other than that
2009-06-12T21:44:00.000Z	JabberWalkie	ddaygold	ahhh, well I only start my sysem up about once per day, if that....so its not a big deal
