2006-09-04T12:56:00.000Z	anon32		um, is dualbooting with dual hard drives any different than with partitioning?
2006-09-04T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	nope.
2006-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-09-04T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	read that link
2006-09-04T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	it's not a 404, its a bit slow though: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	anon32	Flannel	because then I'd have to deal with exiting out of a root shell
2006-10-02T14:57:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	you dont
2006-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	why not just use su, in that case?
2006-10-02T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	use nano instead of vim
2006-10-04T15:46:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	I believe so, yes.
2006-10-04T15:47:00.000Z	anon32	Flannel	in that case, can I at least get it to stop playing DVDs automatically?
2006-10-06T15:56:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	not usually
2006-10-06T15:56:00.000Z	anon32	Flannel	ok, so if I were to deinstall evolution?
2006-10-06T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	that'd be fine.  You'll be forced to remove ubuntu-desktop (the meta package) but you'll still be fine.  You'll need to reinstall ubuntu-desktop (and therefore evolution) to upgrade to edgy and beyond and stuff though
2006-10-06T15:57:00.000Z	anon32	Flannel	so, I need it for dist-upgrade?
2006-10-06T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	you'll need the meta packages, yes.
2006-10-08T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	nope, 8mb looks right
2006-10-11T15:22:00.000Z	Flannel	anon32	apt-cache show [package]  or apt-cache showpkg [package]  depending on what info you want
