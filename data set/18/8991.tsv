2007-05-26T12:24:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	assuming you want to format it for msdos, you should do mformat a:
2007-05-26T12:25:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	but first install mtools -> sudo apt-get install mtools
2007-05-26T12:27:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	what do those do?
2007-05-26T12:30:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	hoiw do mtools work?
2007-05-26T12:30:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	you just refer to the drive like you would under ms-dos or windows
2007-05-26T12:32:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	how do I use it to format a floppy? It's done installing
2007-05-26T12:32:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	mformat a:
2007-05-26T12:32:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	 I'll try that
2007-05-26T12:32:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	I'm on Linux, not DOS.
2007-05-26T12:32:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	did I give you ms-dos instructions or what?
2007-05-26T12:33:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	just try what I told you
2007-05-26T12:33:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	ok
2007-05-26T12:34:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	mformat adds a DOS filesystem to a diskette, not format it
2007-05-26T12:35:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	and why do you think you need anything else?
2007-05-26T12:35:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	I'm going to use this on Linux
2007-05-26T12:35:00.000Z	ultrajumboshrimp	Znuff	not DOS
2007-05-26T12:36:00.000Z	Znuff	ultrajumboshrimp	then just add whatever filesystem you want to it. use mkfs.
