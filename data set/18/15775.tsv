2005-05-01T09:59:00.000Z	unperson		Hi.  I'm trying to run mathematica over a remote X connection.  This works fine, except that mathematica requires special fonts.  I downloaded the fonts from Wolfram Research (the guys who make Mathematica), but I don't know how to install them properly.  I've tried a few things, but I don't really know what I'm doing.
2005-05-01T09:59:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	you need to follow the instructions on the mathematica site.
2005-05-01T10:00:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	put the fonts into /usr/share/fonts
2005-05-01T10:00:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	them run: cd /usr/share/fonts ; fc-update
2005-05-01T10:01:00.000Z	unperson	sobersabre	 Ah, ok.
2005-05-01T10:02:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	you can test, by running xterm, and then: xlsfonts | grep <name_of_wolfram_font>
2005-05-01T10:02:00.000Z	unperson	sobersabre	 I put the type1 fonts under /usr/share/fonts/type1/mathfonts, but I still didn't have any luck.  I didn't know about the fc-update command.
2005-05-01T10:02:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	it's not "fc-update" it is "fc-cache"
2005-05-01T10:03:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	did u get the unix fonts.. right ?
2005-05-01T10:04:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	i have installed these once on Slackware, there was no problem.
2005-05-01T10:06:00.000Z	unperson	sobersabre	 Yes, I got the unix fonts.  I also got the windows fonts.  I attempted to install each.  No luck with either.  I'm going to try your suggestions now.
2005-05-01T10:07:00.000Z	unperson	sobersabre	 So I have downloaded tarballs of the BDF, PCF, and Type1 fonts.  I don't really get if these are the same fonts in 3 different storage formats or if I need to install all of these.
2005-05-01T10:07:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	if you want to be sure, you can check /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see if it has paths related to fonts.
2005-05-01T10:08:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	use the directions on site. i don't remember because i didn't think or work hard on it :-)
2005-05-01T10:08:00.000Z	unperson	sobersabre	 Ok, well, I'll look a bit further for instructions.  I looked a bit yesterday, but I didn't find anything apparently useful.
2005-05-01T10:18:00.000Z	unperson	sobersabre	 Well, it looks like this page basically says use the xset command to add it to your font path:  http://support.wolfram.com/mathematica/systems/unix/general/xsetfonterror.html
2005-05-01T10:19:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	xset +fp is the rough way.
2005-05-01T10:19:00.000Z	sobersabre	unperson	disregards just this.
