2007-03-28T05:33:00.000Z	xtknight	mihailo	why not just talk here?
2007-03-28T05:33:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	so... i need to have a xorg.conf for my monitor and tv
2007-03-28T05:34:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	and i only need the tv to duplicate the monitor picture
2007-03-28T05:34:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	i have a geforce 6800 with a tv out
2007-03-28T05:34:00.000Z	xtknight	mihailo	ok are you using the 'nvidia' drivers or the 'nv'..
2007-03-28T05:35:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	nvidia
2007-03-28T05:35:00.000Z	xtknight	mihailo	does 'nvidia-settings' help you?
2007-03-28T05:36:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	under display device, it just lists my monitor, and i cant find an option to add the tv
2007-03-28T05:36:00.000Z	xtknight	mihailo	did you force tv detection?
2007-03-28T05:37:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	how do i do that?
2007-03-28T05:37:00.000Z	xtknight	mihailo	wish i could tell you but i dont have nvidia-setings up right now
2007-03-28T05:37:00.000Z	xtknight	mihailo	just assume the tv is a secondary mointor, maybe youll get somewhere then
2007-03-28T05:38:00.000Z	mihailo	xtknight	there is no add monitor, nor force tv anywhere
