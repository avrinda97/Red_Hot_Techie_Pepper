2006-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	I have already installed it on the computer.
2006-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	what are you trying to do?
2006-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	ok, then whats the issue?
2006-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	it works fine but occasionally seems to overheat
2006-09-26T15:22:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	I have heard that this is a common issue with the hardware. Is there a way to manually control the fan?
2006-09-26T15:22:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	(or in any other way control power management by hand, so that it does not overheat?
2006-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	are you using the stock fans?
2006-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	what do you mean?
2006-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	what fans are you using?
2006-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	the ones that came with the cpus or what?
2006-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	Yes
2006-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	The ones that are built into the compy
2006-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	you might want to try to get some better fans and see if that helps, i don't think its a control of the speed that you can control
2006-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	Sivik	hahafaha	stock fans suck
2006-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	hahafaha	Sivik	OK, thanks.
