2011-09-14T19:59:00.000Z	brack9		Is Ubuntu going to run significantly slower off a SD card vs a SSD hd?
2011-09-14T20:00:00.000Z	brack9		Yeah.  It's taking forever to boot
2011-09-14T20:00:00.000Z	brack9		dammit.. I have a 4 gig SSD but an 8 gig SD card
2011-09-14T20:00:00.000Z	brack9		so I tried installing it on the SD card
2011-09-14T20:00:00.000Z	brack9		since I kept running out of space
2011-09-14T20:01:00.000Z	brack9		The SD card shouldn't be so slow that it takes like 10 minutes to boot though right?
2011-09-14T20:01:00.000Z	brack9		It's a decent card, I think it's like a sandisk
2011-09-14T20:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	i really wouldn't be surprised at all
2011-09-14T20:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	vendor has very little to do with actual performance/speed/specs
2011-09-14T20:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	well on a 4G drive, of course you keep running out of space
2011-09-14T20:02:00.000Z	brack9	abstrakt	it's a netbook.
2011-09-14T20:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	again that means pretty much nothing to ubuntu
2011-09-14T20:03:00.000Z	brack9	abstrakt	I was answering your question of why someone might use less than 32g
2011-09-14T20:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	uhh... not a very good answer?
2011-09-14T20:04:00.000Z	brack9	abstrakt	it has a built in 4 gig hard drive, the only other storage is removable
2011-09-14T20:05:00.000Z	brack9	abstrakt	I got it for free
2011-09-14T20:06:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	ahh, well there ya go... can't complain much then, can ya :)
2011-09-14T20:06:00.000Z	abstrakt	brack9	try something else then, like damn small linux and then install openbox or whatever
