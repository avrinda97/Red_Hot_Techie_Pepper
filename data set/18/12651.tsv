2007-08-02T09:10:00.000Z	Stoffer		is there a way to remove flash by itself, or is it embedded in firefox?
2007-08-02T05:22:00.000Z	Stoffer		if I want to use synaptic to remove firefox, why the hell does it want to take all of gnome with it?
2007-08-02T05:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	what do you mean 'all of gnome'?
2007-08-02T05:23:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	you know how it lists other stuff to remove?  In that list is gnome, gnome-desktop-environment, etc
2007-08-02T05:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	that might be a meta package like ubuntu-desktop
2007-08-02T05:24:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	anyway around it?  I want to install firefox from source, hoping to fix my flash issue...
2007-08-02T05:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	what flash issue?
2007-08-02T05:25:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	flash maxes out my CPU when it's running.... such as watching videos on youtube
2007-08-02T05:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	are you running flash 9? I don't seem to have this problem.
2007-08-02T05:27:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	I have no idea what I'm running.  The reason I wanted to uninstall firefox is that I can't find any standalone installation of flash anywhere... I think it's just embedded into firefox
2007-08-02T05:27:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	not installed in synaptic, and not as a plugin in firefox that I could find
2007-08-02T05:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	have you read the wiki yet?
2007-08-02T05:28:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	I couldn't find any relevant entries
2007-08-02T05:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	it is under RestrictedFormats
2007-08-02T05:29:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	are you referring to the flashplugin-nonfree package?
2007-08-02T05:30:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	it was never installed.  I'm trying to get rid of flash, not add another one.  Plus, I tried installing that package for kicks to see if it would do anything, but it didn't help a bit.
2007-08-02T05:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Stoffer	follow the instructions on that site.
2007-08-02T05:33:00.000Z	Stoffer	fyrestrtr	ok, thanks
