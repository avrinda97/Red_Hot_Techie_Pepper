2011-03-27T04:11:00.000Z	Kioko_		Anybody want to help me troubleshoot a Think Centre
2011-03-27T04:12:00.000Z	Kioko_		I cant get it to boot from the ubuntu live usb becausae it has the "No OS" error
2011-03-27T04:12:00.000Z	Kioko_		Anybody have any idea why?
2011-03-27T04:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 sounds like the bootloader is not installed properly on the flash drive.
2011-03-27T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 try it in other machines see if it works in them. the creator tool can mess up
2011-03-27T04:14:00.000Z	Kioko_	Dr_Willis	but it doesnt work on the think centre
2011-03-27T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 some machines are picky about what fhasl drives they can boot.
2011-03-27T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 ive had older box's not work with some flash drives.. but work with others.
2011-03-27T04:15:00.000Z	Kioko_	Dr_Willis	The thing is, it will boot, just wont recognixze the OS
2011-03-27T04:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 be sure its trying to boot the proper device..
2011-03-27T04:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 sounds to me like its booting some OTHER device.
2011-03-27T04:16:00.000Z	Kioko_	Dr_Willis	It is, im getting some CDs soon, so it may work from that, wubi will not work because its a limited account on XP but will Ophcrack help that?
2011-03-27T04:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 id use virtualbox over wubi.
2011-03-27T04:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 you can also make a usb flash drive that uses grub2 to boot an iso file.
2011-03-27T04:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kioko_	 huh? i run ubuntu in vbox all the time.
2011-03-27T04:18:00.000Z	Kioko_	Dr_Willis	its for a kids computer, and for skype, though the ethernet on the acc is disabled, so they want ubuntu but i am having trouble installing it
