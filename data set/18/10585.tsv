2006-11-12T06:17:00.000Z	bipinu2	MarcN	ompaul  is something wrong with the sound driver? do i need to add any other packages?
2006-11-12T06:17:00.000Z	MarcN	bipinu2	open the volume applet and look at preferences.  Should let you 'select tracks' -- Master, Headphone, PCM, Line-In, etc.  If not checked, they aren't displayed.
2006-11-12T06:18:00.000Z	MarcN	bipinu2	doubt it.  probably just volume control set too low.

2006-11-12T06:19:00.000Z	MarcN	bipinu2	right click on the volume applet, select open volume control.   Then select Edit->Preferences and get a listbox.
