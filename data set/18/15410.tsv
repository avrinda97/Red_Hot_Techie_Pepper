2006-04-21T06:12:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	Windows XP works the same way actually... It stores user settings in hidden folders under the user's Documents and Settings dir. same concept really.
2006-04-21T06:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	no they aren't in Windows. Cookies are stored per user in Windows and Linux.
2006-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	if you have IE and Firefox, they each have separate cookie stores.
2006-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	you don't know jack.
2006-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	what are you trying to accomplish anyway?
2006-04-21T06:17:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	let's take this to a private channel. I'll help you.
2006-04-21T06:19:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	I'm trying to help you in a query window. Do you see it?
2006-04-21T06:19:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	XJ	if not, you probably have to register your nickname on the server.
