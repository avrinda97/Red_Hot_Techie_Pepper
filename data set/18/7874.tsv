2007-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	windego40		anyone with some time want to help me set up WoW on abuntu 7.10?
2007-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	windego40		i mean i have it set up its just running really slow
2007-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	windego40		yeah :\
2007-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	ati or nvidia?
2007-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	i dont use it, sorry man. which drivers dont work? nvidia binary?
2007-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	yeah i go to add/ remove applications and install the legacy driver but its still running very slow
2007-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	what card is it?
2007-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	xfx6800 xtreme
2007-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	well the others cant be installed for some reason
2007-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	i would sort out why, the legacy is not correct for that card
2007-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	for the other drivers it says"NVidia binary X.Org driver ('new' driver) cannot be installed on your computer type (i386). Either the application requires special hardware features or the vendor decided to not support your computer type."
2007-11-19T12:00:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	dont know, thats very odd. computer type has to be supported.... are you up to date with anything
2007-11-19T12:00:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	i believe so
2007-11-19T12:01:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	is there a way to make sure i am?
2007-11-19T12:01:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	any idea what version of a) xorg you're running / b) nvidia-drivers its trying to install?
2007-11-19T12:01:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	update manager?
2007-11-19T12:03:00.000Z	MidnighToker	windego40	sorry, i'm really new to ubuntu, i have no idea.  -could talk you through it in a couple of others, but you want someone who's familiar with ubuntu
2007-11-19T12:06:00.000Z	windego40	MidnighToker	ive tried enabling the accelerated graphics driver but it doesnt let me
