2011-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	darkstar999	earlten	don't feed the trolls
2011-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	earlten		apparently
2011-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	earlten	darkstar999	would you happen to have a suggestion for me that might help my situation?
2011-11-23T11:47:00.000Z	darkstar999	earlten	I haven't been watching. what's your problem?
2011-11-23T11:48:00.000Z	earlten		it worked right before the ati drivers were installed........\
2011-11-23T11:48:00.000Z	earlten		okay, let's try *another* question. When I install the ATi catalyst drivers... I have 2 displays connected.both samsung..  DVI to my 24" monitor and VGA to my 37" television. Why is it that I can move the desktops around to that the mouse moves from one to the next properly, but I can't force the primary display to be the TV?
2011-11-23T11:48:00.000Z	earlten		wrong order
2011-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	darkstar999		you are on ubuntu 11.10?
2011-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	earlten		using KDE oneiric and the latest catalyst drivers
2011-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	earlten		I've been trying to set it via the GUi, and it won't force anymore
2011-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	earlten	darkstar999	yes
2011-11-23T11:50:00.000Z	darkstar999	earlten	i have my own problems with dual displays! sorry, don't know how to help you
2011-11-23T12:02:00.000Z	earlten		useless as tits on a boar
2011-11-23T12:07:00.000Z	earlten		friendly?
2011-11-23T12:08:00.000Z	earlten	darkstar999	was friendly..  but so far, he's been in the minority, and out of the half dozen problems I have had to solve on my own so far..  helpful has not come close to even being near this equation
