2011-05-30T19:15:00.000Z	boris		thats what i thought : i think my install is messed up . i tried with a different sh script earlier today . went into the path . tried to type the file name . and it didnt run
2011-05-30T19:17:00.000Z	boris		when i type sudo ./vino-server it says it cannot open display... should i just install tightvnc?
2011-05-30T19:19:00.000Z	boris		trying to get the vnc server to run... it worked fine but after the reboot it stopped working
2011-05-30T19:20:00.000Z	boris		i would love to know how .. i cant even start it manually by writing ./vino-server
2011-05-30T19:21:00.000Z	boris		onse sec
2011-05-30T19:22:00.000Z	boris		it says command not found
2011-05-30T19:22:00.000Z	boris		i am using chicken of the VNC for OSX
2011-05-30T19:22:00.000Z	boris		as the client
2011-05-30T19:23:00.000Z	boris		can one of you guys type in sudo gdmsetup .. for me it says cannot open display .. it does that for me on quite a few commands
2011-05-30T19:24:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	are you connected via ssh?
2011-05-30T19:24:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	are you using x-fowarding?
2011-05-30T19:25:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	you cant open up graphical applications in ssh without x fowarding
2011-05-30T19:25:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	i dont know about osx
2011-05-30T19:26:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	you could always try to use its none-graphical counterpart
2011-05-30T19:27:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	you would either have to pass the command variables, or execute the correct command.
2011-05-30T19:27:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	i dont know what gdmsetup does, but it sounds graphical to me.
2011-05-30T19:28:00.000Z	jack_^	boris	you'll need to use x-forwarding or setup vnc to remotely connect to the box to execute that command
