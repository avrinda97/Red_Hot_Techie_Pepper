2007-04-15T16:47:00.000Z	SubMOA		how can you run multiple programs on a BASH shell or the cli
2007-04-15T16:48:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	screen
2007-04-15T16:48:00.000Z	SubMOA	kritzstapf	sorry, screen?
2007-04-15T16:48:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	yes, its a "windowmanager" for terminals
2007-04-15T16:49:00.000Z	SubMOA	kritzstapf	oOO, and I use the F keys to switch, right?
2007-04-15T16:49:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	no, you are talking about ttys
2007-04-15T16:50:00.000Z	SubMOA	kritzstapf	 rausb0 whats the difference?  I thought F8 was the GUI and the others were the virtual terminals
2007-04-15T16:50:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	yes and whats your question now? i thought you wanted to spawn different programms in ONE terminal
2007-04-15T16:52:00.000Z	SubMOA	kritzstapf	well, maybe... I just want to run multiple programs and be able to interact w/ them... like a music player, instand messenger, email client, web browser, etc.  how would I go about that?
2007-04-15T16:53:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	just use the ttys on the F-keys
2007-04-15T16:57:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	youve got the different tty-terminals on the f-keys and can spawn virtual terminal-sessions in ONE of those ttys using screen
2007-04-15T16:57:00.000Z	SubMOA	kritzstapf	hmm... I think I'm getting it
2007-04-15T05:11:00.000Z	kritzstapf	SubMOA	rausb0: what are you doing? ;D
