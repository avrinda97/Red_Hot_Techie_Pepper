2010-12-14T21:54:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	You should copy everything in your /home
2010-12-14T21:54:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	It is likely that is the only place that is different between the two.
2010-12-14T21:55:00.000Z	bidaboy	edbian	no i installed a lot of softs on the old one
2010-12-14T21:55:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	Then you need to copy all of /usr and all of your home folder
2010-12-14T21:56:00.000Z	bidaboy	edbian	that will work ?
2010-12-14T21:56:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	Umm, I've never tried it.  Now that I think about it, that will probably freak out the package manager.
2010-12-14T21:57:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	You could copy the entire install to the new machine.  (they won't remain syncronized)
2010-12-14T21:57:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	Connect both of the hdd's to the same computer some how.
2010-12-14T21:57:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	boot that computer with a live CD, use gparted to copy the partition from one hdd to another, install grup.  Fix any small bugs that might be left over
2010-12-14T21:58:00.000Z	bidaboy	edbian	how about users account and theire passwords?
2010-12-14T21:58:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	Well if you copy the entire system that will be taken care of
2010-12-14T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	If you copy individual folder and files and stuff then you'll need that to.  The more I think about it though copying this way is a bad idea
2010-12-14T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	BTW that stuffs in /etc/group, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow
2010-12-14T21:59:00.000Z	bidaboy	edbian	ok i will try gparted
2010-12-14T22:00:00.000Z	bidaboy	edbian	thaks
2010-12-14T22:00:00.000Z	edbian	bidaboy	It will take a long time.  Have fun!
2010-12-14T22:00:00.000Z	bidaboy	edbian	ok
