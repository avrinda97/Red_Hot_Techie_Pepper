2012-11-19T15:32:00.000Z	devswap		I realise this is slightly off topic but is a 5400rpm usb2 hard disk fast enough to play full def 1080p mp4 videos?
2012-11-19T15:33:00.000Z	devswap		actionparsnip: thanks - wasnt sure if a 7200 would be needed. There isnt a particular screen - I just didnt know if it would be fast enough and hence the question
2012-11-19T15:35:00.000Z	devswap		actionparsnip: you got any experience of samsung drives - I always buy western digital but the samsung is cheaper
2012-11-19T15:35:00.000Z	devswap		will do thanks
2012-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	devswap		actionparsnip: most probably wont be but as I was asking the question I picked that as probably most resource hungry
2012-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	its fast enough in most cases (for AVC bitrates)
2012-11-19T15:38:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	it should get about 160 Mbits/s, and avc video is usually no more than 25 Mbits/s
2012-11-19T15:39:00.000Z	devswap	brontosaurusrex	ok thanks - just the brand to choose now
2012-11-19T15:40:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	i have bunch on wds, all still working
2012-11-19T15:40:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		of*
2012-11-19T15:41:00.000Z	devswap	brontosaurusrex	yes I love WD but tempted by cheaper samsung
2012-11-19T15:42:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	id go with whatever has better replacement policy
2012-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	always test them when brand new (copy few mp3s or whatever and check md5sums)
2012-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	i had a noname drive that would copy like 4 of 5 files correcly, no system errors reported, but md5 was my return tool
2012-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	devswap		anyone here in the uk and can recommend a good manufacturer of 2.5inch disk enclosures that are strong and built well
2012-11-19T15:46:00.000Z	devswap		sorry all - I know off topic but we are all techies - wont ask again :)
2012-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	devswap		member:brontosaurusrex: may I pm you
2012-11-19T15:52:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	devswap	sure3
