2007-12-27T05:38:00.000Z	Jangari		anyone have any idea why a single machine runs xp at lightning speed, speeds i've never witnessed on any windows installation ever, while gutsy on the same machine is running at a snail's pace?
2007-12-27T05:39:00.000Z	Jangari		is that directed to me, pgjensen?
2007-12-27T05:39:00.000Z	Jangari		udma, eh?
2007-12-27T05:39:00.000Z	Jangari		but bruenig, i've been running ubuntu on several machines, and this is the fastest machine on paper,
2007-12-27T05:39:00.000Z	Jangari		all other machines run ubuntu without any performance problems,
2007-12-27T05:40:00.000Z	Jangari		is that the command, pgjensen? hdparm?
2007-12-27T05:41:00.000Z	Jangari		is there a forum on error 17?
2007-12-27T05:41:00.000Z	Jangari		because it seems heaps of people would benefit
2007-12-27T05:43:00.000Z	Jangari		oh, another thing, how do i set up an automount for a hdd partition?
2007-12-27T05:43:00.000Z	Jangari		ntfs
2007-12-27T05:44:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	put it in your fstab
2007-12-27T05:45:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	no, well there you go, for ubotu :)
2007-12-27T05:54:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	isn't one,  set it by sudo passwd
2007-12-27T05:55:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	yep, that's the way they set it up
2007-12-27T06:06:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	you see the fstab link ubotu did?  basically  /dev/sda3 /mountpoint options
2007-12-27T06:20:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	windows will get irked
2007-12-27T06:22:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	true, but windows is hardcoded to look for those files i think.  Renaming them on the ubuntu box might freak it out
2007-12-27T06:46:00.000Z	glycerine	Jangari	gnome-terminal
