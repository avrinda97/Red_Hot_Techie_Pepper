2011-05-01T19:41:00.000Z	gdea73		Having really weird keyboard input errors
2011-05-01T19:41:00.000Z	gdea73		When I boot up, it goes to GRUB menu. but every key except the arrow keys work
2011-05-01T19:41:00.000Z	gdea73		when I select ubuntu 10.10 (because that's all I can select), it gives me an error...
2011-05-01T19:41:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	what kind of keyboard?
2011-05-01T19:42:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	these generalised terms arent helping. what's the error?
2011-05-01T19:45:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	"out of disk"? are you sure you have that right
2011-05-01T19:46:00.000Z	gdea73	gartral	yes. I get three lines of error, I will send them to you in PM
2011-05-01T19:46:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	no, pastebin them.

2011-05-01T19:51:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	i've never seen that before.. what kind of hard disk do you have?
2011-05-01T19:53:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	it looks like your install got hosed. is this a fresh install?
2011-05-01T19:53:00.000Z	gdea73	gartral	Yes, I just installed this morning :P
2011-05-01T19:53:00.000Z	gdea73	gartral	I'v been having some really odd issues lately, ...
2011-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	do you remember if you told the partitioner too do anything other than the recommended install?
2011-05-01T19:55:00.000Z	gdea73	gartral	Yes, I did configure them manually. I told it to format partition one (then 11.04 which I didn't like), to ext4, and install the bootloader to /dev/sda1 (partition 1).
2011-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	gartral	gdea73	AHHA! there's your mistake. grub should allways be in the MBR of the hdd. IE /dev/sda NOT /dev/sdaX
2011-05-01T19:58:00.000Z	gdea73	gartral	also having GRUB issues. my arrow keys don't work. they come up as letters, P, H, W or something.
