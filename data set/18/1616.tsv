2011-01-23T00:24:00.000Z	ronr__		Hi everyone. Is anyone familiar with a guide to completely eliminate pulseaudio and use pure alsa in ubuntu 10.10?
2011-01-23T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	probably not a good idea actually
2011-01-23T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	that's why i said probably not a good idea - it will kill "Ubuntu" sound.
2011-01-23T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	i had an emulator that wouldn't work with Pulse installed too - i stopped using it.
2011-01-23T00:30:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	but how can I solve the issue with xbmc otherwise? from what I understand, pulseaudio doesn't allow spdif passthrough audio.
2011-01-23T00:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	have to tried starting xbmc with "padsp XBMC_BIN"? worth a shot.
2011-01-23T00:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	i don't know what the xbmc binary is called - replace with the proper executable
2011-01-23T00:31:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	what would that do? as it may already be obvious, I'm quite new to ubuntu and xbmc:)
2011-01-23T00:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	padsp will try to emulate the old sound system for whatever command follows it
2011-01-23T00:33:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	yeah, just man'ed it. not sure it makes sense but is there a simila command with alsa?
2011-01-23T00:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	even better!  try pasuspender
2011-01-23T00:34:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	great! I'll reinstall pulseaudio and give it a try. Thanks! :)
2011-01-23T00:36:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	btw, do you have a suggestion for an alternative terminal app that would be good for my htpc? I've tried konsole (which I use at work) but it doesn't seem to have good zooming features like terminal-gnome has.
2011-01-23T00:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	? i used gnome-terminal on former MythTV setup
2011-01-23T00:38:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	Duh! I missed the tabs feature in it. nevermind ;)
2011-01-23T00:49:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	hi again. tried both commands you suggested but then there's no sound in xbmc's menu and when I try to play a video, the whole application halts :-/
2011-01-23T00:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ronr__	sorry i don't have any other suggestion - sorry man, best of luck. (i don't use xbmc so don't have any personal experience)
2011-01-23T00:51:00.000Z	ronr__	ZykoticK9	that's ok, thanks for trying to help
