2011-09-26T22:50:00.000Z	scarleo		Hi, I have an unfinilized cd-rom with images on that I want to try to recover. It's unmountable so how can I read from it?
2011-09-26T22:51:00.000Z	allowoverride	scarleo	there are forensics software you may wish to try, as well as disk-utility. anyone else?
2011-09-26T22:51:00.000Z	allowoverride	scarleo	is it mouting?
2011-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	allowoverride		opps, you said unmounted.
