2012-02-29T12:38:00.000Z	recognosco		did anyone here build a gcc-4.7 snapshot on ubuntu successfully? i have tried quite a few times... and failed :(
2012-02-29T12:40:00.000Z	recognosco		ps. the gcc-snapshot package that is currently installable from oneric is from october 2011
2012-02-29T12:41:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	whats the problem?
2012-02-29T12:45:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	failing to build gcc-4.7 snapshot
2012-02-29T12:45:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	had any success with it?
2012-02-29T12:46:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	well there not guaranteed to build at all. Ill try the latest and see what happens
2012-02-29T12:47:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	ill try with GCC 4.7-20120225 Snapshot
2012-02-29T12:47:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	i am trying that myself. thanks.
2012-02-29T13:04:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	im failing at building libiberty, most likely due to new code only partially being introduced. there could be a patch on the mailing list. but Im not going to search for it.
2012-02-29T13:12:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	i just downloaded the frozen 4.7 snapshot for ubuntu from launchpad. which is supposed to be patched. or so i assume. building it now. *crossed fingers*
2012-02-29T13:12:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	thanks anyways.
2012-02-29T13:41:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	why exactly are you trying to build a snapshot?
2012-02-29T13:42:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	crti.o would be created while building, it looks like someone messed up the makefile
2012-02-29T13:42:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	playing with c++11 features... hehe
2012-02-29T13:42:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	why not use a stable build of gcc?
2012-02-29T13:43:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	4.6 doesn't support a lot of the new C++11 things... like regex or using typedef
2012-02-29T13:44:00.000Z	pfifo	recognosco	i thought there were patches for them?
2012-02-29T14:53:00.000Z	recognosco	pfifo	got to build 4.7 finally :-D
