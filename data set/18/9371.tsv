2007-06-15T08:58:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	you dont want to remove locales... unless you want to remove all these packages 'apt-cache rdepends locales'
2007-06-15T08:58:00.000Z	jetscreamer	idefixx	i just want to remove the ones i don't know the language
2007-06-15T09:07:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	oh, sry didnt read that properly. take a look at 'man locale-gen' and /var/lib/locales/supported.d
2007-06-15T09:07:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	not sure about that though.. could be i dont remember that right.
2007-06-15T09:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer	idefixx	i found those... haven't seemed to do anything though :/
2007-06-15T09:08:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	hmm let me see
2007-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	odd, i just removed most of the stuff from /var/lib/locales/supported.d/ and it still compiles the same locales.
2007-06-15T09:15:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	im guessing it has something to do with utf8 because im pretty sure it worked in debian some time ago.
2007-06-15T09:17:00.000Z	jetscreamer	idefixx	it works flawlessly when you take the debian locales package and do what it takes to install it in an ubuntu install... :)  but ubuntu has made changes to the locales packages it seems
2007-06-15T09:19:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	yep i just saw the use belocs-locales-bin..
2007-06-15T09:19:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	it states they made slight improvment... whatever that means.
2007-06-15T09:22:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	did you use the etch locales package?
2007-06-15T09:31:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	i think i figured it out.. /var/lib/belocs/list cointains the exact list of locales compiled on my system... im not sure what generates it though.
2007-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	jetscreamer	idefixx	good find... editing it and reconfiguring locales still gives same though :/
2007-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	jetscreamer	idefixx	time to drop this for now :/ ... moving on
2007-06-15T09:36:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	take a look at the dependency file... im guessing its check pre-compile.. so what get compiled are dependecys
2007-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	idefixx	jetscreamer	well what else can you do.. im not gonna look through the locale-gen source :)
2007-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	jetscreamer	idefixx	:) me neither
