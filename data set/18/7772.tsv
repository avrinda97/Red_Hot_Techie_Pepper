2007-12-11T09:33:00.000Z	RedHeron		Can anyone offer me help in the way of a crash course in Linux scripts? I need to run a bunch of commands a whole bunch of times.
2007-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	anything you would enter on the command line can be used in a script
2007-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	RedHeron	Agent_bob	I'm aware of that part, but how do I make it a script?
2007-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Agent_bob		sky then it's up to date    stop whining
2007-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	?
2007-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	it is a script if it's writen     what are you asking ?
2007-12-11T09:35:00.000Z	RedHeron		How do I make a script that executes a bunch of command lines and then stops when a particular return is given?
2007-12-11T09:35:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	    until blah ;do something ;done
2007-12-11T09:36:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	if you simply want it to loop until the exitcode is 0   until command ;do : ;done
2007-12-11T09:37:00.000Z	RedHeron	Agent_bob	what I'm more interested in is something that tells me more in-detail what I need to know, since it's security-related and not appropriate for a public channel.
2007-12-11T09:37:00.000Z	RedHeron	Agent_bob	Google isn't really being helpful.
2007-12-11T09:37:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	well i can't answer specific questions if all you ask are general ones.      if you have an "example" we can work on...
2007-12-11T09:38:00.000Z	RedHeron	Agent_bob	hard to provide an example when I don't know how to ask for what I want... what I want is general assistance in creating scripts.
2007-12-11T09:39:00.000Z	RedHeron	Agent_bob	May I PM?
2007-12-11T09:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob		sky stop whining.  several of us have assured you that if apt-get dist-upgrade said 0 to upgrade  then there are none
2007-12-11T09:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	i'm not regestered, so i cant pm back
2007-12-11T09:40:00.000Z	RedHeron		Is there anyone *else* who can help me with maybe a URL to provide a general introduction to Linux scripting?
2007-12-11T09:40:00.000Z	Agent_bob	RedHeron	and i'm not going to register either.
