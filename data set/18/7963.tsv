2008-09-10T08:05:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		hey if how do i tell what partitions i have on my system?
2008-09-10T08:06:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	df -h
2008-09-10T08:06:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	does that show swap?
2008-09-10T08:07:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	fdisk -l will show swap
2008-09-10T08:07:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	as root of course
2008-09-10T08:08:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	good -- i just did an install with encrypted lvm want to make sure everything came out ok
2008-09-10T08:09:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	fdisk -l is not showing swap
2008-09-10T08:10:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	do you see swap in /etc/fstab?
2008-09-10T08:11:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	i see / /boot /home and then a comment with swap in it with a mount point of none
2008-09-10T08:11:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	then you don't have swap.
2008-09-10T08:12:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	let me come back logged in on my new install and paste my fstab
2008-09-10T08:16:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/45155/
2008-09-10T08:18:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	line 13 shows your swap.
2008-09-10T08:18:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	13 appears to be cdrom; 11-12 are swap?
2008-09-10T08:19:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	13. UUID=8306b27d-b783-4793-b57c-8b8b151c4d3b none            swap    sw
2008-09-10T08:20:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	either way -- i have swap right?  don't want to have to reinstall, but want suspend to ram to work...
2008-09-10T08:20:00.000Z	joeb3_	hvgotcodes	yes you have swap.  It's lvm.
2008-09-10T08:21:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	joeb3_	sweet
