2010-10-19T23:09:00.000Z	blipX		Trying to get Nomachine NX (commercial version) to work on Ubuntu 10. Been through http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1546856 and the Nomachine isntall guides. When I attempt to connect though Im getting what appears to be an auth issue with nxnode. Anyone have this working by chance? TIA
2010-10-19T23:11:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	I'm working on a different problem with NX client but I was able to get it to work on 10.10 -- just needed to make sure to import the correct key into your client
2010-10-19T23:11:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	I have the correct key. Its something freaking out sever side with "nxnode".
2010-10-19T23:11:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	I have even tried it without changing keys so nothing should have to be done. Does the samething.
2010-10-19T23:12:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	What problem are you having?
2010-10-19T23:14:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	I have been running Fedora 10 for a while and using NX to connect to the FreeNX server and it's very fast and looks awesome. Almost like being at the desktop.  I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 and when I run NX /FreeNX it's almost unusable. The two servers are on the same internet switch and being accessed from the same external computer so I'm very confused.
2010-10-19T23:15:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	Seems ive read something about that along the way. I seem to recall a mention of disabling some kind of Rendering attribute for the X server.
2010-10-19T23:15:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	Yah Im using Nomachine with RHEL and Fedora with no issues. Im trying ubuntu because I want to try Biolinux which is ubuntu based.
2010-10-19T23:16:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	Are you referring to the Xdamage option in Ubuntu? I tried that but it made an extremely minor positive change.
2010-10-19T23:16:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	No. Let me see if I can find it again...
2010-10-19T23:17:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1590440   At least I dont think its the samething.
2010-10-19T23:20:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	that is a different option - I am trying it now
2010-10-19T23:24:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	Just logged out and back in again to test it.  No difference unfortunately :(
2010-10-19T23:25:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	with respect to your nxnode issue, I'm not sure what to recommend. I didn't have any issue getting it running. I did install it using apt-get rather than downloading anything from freenx or so. (I understood there were different ways to get it installed)
2010-10-19T23:25:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	Bummer. Running compiz by chance?
2010-10-19T23:25:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	nope - all desktop effects are off
2010-10-19T23:25:00.000Z	blipX	TheProf	Yah Im running NoMachine NX not FreeNX.
2010-10-19T23:26:00.000Z	TheProf	blipX	ah sorry I misunderstood
