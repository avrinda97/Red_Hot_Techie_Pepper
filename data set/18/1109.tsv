2011-05-26T09:58:00.000Z	guglu		wait, let me explain
2011-05-26T10:00:00.000Z	guglu		the GRUB loader comes, i choose UBUNTU, then the KUBUNTU loader is shown and after that a black screen that says "fsck from util-linux-ng 2.16\r\n/dev/sda5: clean xxxx/xxxxx files, xxxx/xxxx blocks
2011-05-26T10:00:00.000Z	guglu		i have pressed ctrl + alt + delete and restarted 5-6 times, but same thing happens everytime
2011-05-26T10:01:00.000Z	guglu		right now i am using webchat, so if i ignore someone's reply please pardon me
2011-05-26T10:01:00.000Z	guglu		also i am so tensed :S
2011-05-26T10:01:00.000Z	guglu		its not a prompt, because i cant execute any command
2011-05-26T10:01:00.000Z	guglu		yes, it is restarting the system
2011-05-26T10:02:00.000Z	guglu		just normal terminal like black screen, dont know what it is called
2011-05-26T10:02:00.000Z	guglu		i also choose recovery mode from the GRUB but same thing (just few more extra lines :( )
2011-05-26T10:03:00.000Z	WhoAmIHere	guglu	it is called "this shit can't work"
2011-05-26T10:06:00.000Z	WhoAmIHere	guglu	exactly what happens when you boot your system?
2011-05-26T10:06:00.000Z	guglu	WhoAmIHere	the GRUB loader comes, i choose UBUNTU, then the KUBUNTU loader is shown and after that a black screen that says "fsck from util-linux-ng 2.16\r\n/dev/sda5: clean xxxx/xxxxx files, xxxx/xxxx blocks
2011-05-26T10:08:00.000Z	WhoAmIHere	guglu	and after that, remains the message at the screen?
2011-05-26T10:08:00.000Z	guglu	WhoAmIHere	yes
2011-05-26T10:12:00.000Z	WhoAmIHere	guglu	possibly your BIOS isn't well supported and it may represent a bug with fsck... try to use an interactive startup
2011-05-26T10:13:00.000Z	WhoAmIHere	guglu	fsck is an utility that checks the disk drives when booting
2011-05-26T10:13:00.000Z	guglu	WhoAmIHere	so what should i do now ?
