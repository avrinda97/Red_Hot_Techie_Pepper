2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		i have a question about groups in ubuntu - why does the installer create a group of the same name as my user, and add me to that group?
2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		doesn't it make more sense to simply add my user to the 'users' group, as would be the case on most other *nixes?
2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		debian? really? i used to use debian and never noticed it do that
2005-04-16T10:13:00.000Z	pressureman		so every new user will get a group of the same name created too?
2005-04-16T10:14:00.000Z	pressureman		so, (sorry for a swathe of dumb questions), essentially each new user has no groups in common until the admin puts them in the 'users' group?
2005-04-16T10:16:00.000Z	pressureman		btw, i am running a fujitsu siemens amilo M 1425 notebook, and i was blown away by how everything "just works" with ubuntu
2005-04-16T10:16:00.000Z	pressureman		right down to 1280x800 on my widescreen LCD (ATI Mobility Radeon 9700)
2005-04-16T10:18:00.000Z	pressureman		can anybody offer a rough approximation of the amount of time it would take to do a debian install, and bring it up to the level of polishedness of ubuntu?
2005-04-16T10:19:00.000Z	pressureman		(being that i'm a die hard debian admin, and would still use it for console only servers, but i'm liking ubuntu more and more on my laptop)
2005-04-16T10:20:00.000Z	pressureman		i guess what i'm really asking is, is there any reason why in some situations debian might be better suited to a desktop?
2005-04-16T10:21:00.000Z	topyli	pressureman	it would take an hour, give or take. intall the woody base install, edit sources.list, upgrade to hoary ;)
2005-04-16T10:21:00.000Z	pressureman		no, i used debian sarge on about 30 servers in russia
2005-04-16T10:22:00.000Z	pressureman		i'm just trying to decide whether to stick with debian (at least on desktops) since it's what i know and use, or venture out into the unknown with ubuntu
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	pressureman		(admittedly, installing ubuntu is a much nicer thought than installing fedora core)
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	topyli	pressureman	the only thing that comes to mind for debian on the desktop is the long release cycle -> long support, stable boxen for years without bothering users with any changes in their lives
2005-04-16T10:23:00.000Z	pressureman	Dreamer3	it is for me - i've only really discovered it!
2005-04-16T10:24:00.000Z	pressureman		apt is the most brilliant package system i've ever seen, so any distro that uses it wins my approval
2005-04-16T10:24:00.000Z	topyli	pressureman	yeah, go for lindows ;)
