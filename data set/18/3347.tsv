2010-09-25T04:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	bazhang	thnks
2011-01-16T16:37:00.000Z	bazhang	almoxarife	yes. do NOT do it.
2011-12-04T11:46:00.000Z	bazhang	almoxarife	the ppa are disabled on upgrade of version, so it's not an issue
2011-12-04T11:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	bazhang	the issue is not disabling ppa's, the issue is that once the ppa cripples the virgin expected install, the upgrade script hangs
2012-01-06T15:09:00.000Z	bazhang	almoxarife	sure it is
2012-11-13T10:58:00.000Z	almoxarife	bazhang	you forgot 'please'
