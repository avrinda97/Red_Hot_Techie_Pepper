2011-01-24T07:33:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	at chance do you speak german
2011-01-24T07:33:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	i need take my ubuntu transfer on the primary hard drive.
2011-01-24T07:33:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	transfer from secondary drive = slave.. to primary hard disk C:
2011-01-24T07:33:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	and you totally want to erase windows? no data there to save?
2011-01-24T07:35:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	maybe to keep a backup or something so i can restore configurations on the VMware on my ubuntu.
2011-01-24T07:36:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	to be hosten, i am not 100% sure about your plans/settings: you have 2 hard discs. one is used for windows, one is used for ubunut. now you want to use both harddsiks for ubuntu. is that correct?
2011-01-24T07:38:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	yes the hdd0 using winxp the second i dont know if is important who is second and who first using ubuntu. now i want erase my winxp and transfer to the primary the ubuntu and give all space to them.. dunno if im making any mistake..
2011-01-24T07:40:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	there is no need to copy ubuntu fomr hdd1 to hdd0. just keep ubuntu the way it is and format hdd0 so that i can be used by ubuntu. there is no practical difference in having the OS at hdd0 or hdd1
2011-01-24T07:41:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	the only thing you might have to consider is the booting progess. but i guess that you use grub to start windows too so everything should be fine
2011-01-24T07:41:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	thanks.. now second question. i have gived i remember 40gb on my ubuntu with gparted when i was installed them, how i can give them full space on the hd ?
2011-01-24T07:42:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	i have formated twice my hd and reinstalled grub, i dont want grub i dont want second OS i will install vmware.
2011-01-24T07:44:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	i understand that. the only thing i wanted to say, that in a very strange case the removal of windows might influence your ubuntu install. formating cna not be undone, so now mistakes are allowed. now, the best thing you can do is to use the gparted live cd. boot from that cd and you will be able to change the partitioning
2011-01-24T07:46:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	i have formated twice or 3 times the "windows" hd. i have know that trick with live CD with gparted, ill read some on ubuntu wiki so i will not do mistakes.
2011-01-24T07:47:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	ok, good luck. the gparted cd is not very big, so i can be downloaded fast. so the main message: no need to reinstall ubuntu. jsut leave it as it is, becuase it doesn't amtter on what hard disk it is
2011-01-24T07:48:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	thanks, i just need gparted cd right ? not ubuntu live ?
2011-01-24T07:50:00.000Z	Benkinooby	x0x	gparted cd can only be used for making partitions. it can not be used for installing ubuntu. but because it is only for partitioning, it is small and faster than the ubuntu live cd. of course you can use the ubuntu live cd too, if you allready have one. i think the live cd has gparted on it
2011-01-24T07:52:00.000Z	x0x	Benkinooby	so when i format the windows hd it will start on ubuntu right?.. also a guy gived me a code and my windows HD is automount and i can see all windows files can be that create an error when i format?
