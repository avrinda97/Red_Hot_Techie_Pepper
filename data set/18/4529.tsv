2010-02-01T08:09:00.000Z	tweaksource		I'm running 8.04 and trying to upgrade to 9.04.  sudo do-release-upgrade Checking for a new ubuntu release No new release found. Is this still the correct wayto upgrade?
2010-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	that's, because 8.04 is a LTS release  and  by default it only shows other LTS as upgrade
2010-02-01T08:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	why do you want to upgrade to 9.04?
2010-02-01T08:11:00.000Z	tweaksource	sebsebseb	To get my Canon mx700 working
2010-02-01T08:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	What?  that doesn't sound right,  Canon aren't exactly Linux friendly
2010-02-01T08:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	so if it doesn't work with 8.04, it probably won't in 9.04 or 9.10 either
2010-02-01T08:13:00.000Z	tweaksource	sebsebseb	Canon AU has linux drivers for it. Found several sets of instructions on the forums claiming it works in the "9" releases
2010-02-01T08:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	ok uhmm  normalley I would just tell people to stay on 8.04  that have it at the moment, want to know why?
2010-02-01T08:14:00.000Z	tweaksource	sebsebseb	GO ahead...
2010-02-01T08:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	I mean stay on 8.04,  untill 10.04, which they can then directly upgrade to since it's the next LTS, that's released end of April
2010-02-01T08:14:00.000Z	tweaksource	sebsebseb	I am just trying to get an old machine running with the printer as a print server. My other machines are 8.04
2010-02-01T08:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	upgrading to 9.04,  that should work no problem,  but upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10, might go wrong on you
2010-02-01T08:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	yes you can
2010-02-01T08:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	you just got to get it showing non LTS releases
2010-02-01T08:16:00.000Z	tweaksource	sebsebseb	Any idea how?
2010-02-01T08:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tweaksource	kind of, but I am not on Ubuntu right now, ( another distro actsaully )
2010-02-01T08:18:00.000Z	tweaksource	sebsebseb	I'm checking it out. Thanks.
