2007-07-22T08:59:00.000Z	allquixotic		maybe someday when the developers get around to improving their GUIs and encryption abstraction layers or whatever, it will be usable :)
2007-07-22T09:00:00.000Z	allquixotic		I have not found a respectable wifi GUI for Linux yet
2007-07-22T09:00:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	if you can do all that, why not help with the development?
2007-07-22T09:01:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	that's a nice attitude :) yes I'd love to fix every single little problem I ever have with every Linux utility, but "diminishing returns" comes to mind
2007-07-22T09:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	if you can do it, you should for the mere fact that it's giving back to the community
2007-07-22T09:03:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	I give back to the community 8 hours a day at work :-) I come home, hack on my own hobby projects, and help in IRC where I can. at this point if I *start* any new project work, I'll have to curtail my efforts elsewhere, so it would be a zero net-gain
2007-07-22T09:03:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	ooooooh
2007-07-22T09:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	thank you for contributing :)
2007-07-22T09:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	i wish i had some programming or scripting skills...i would be happy to contribute in my free time
2007-07-22T09:04:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	it's nice to work for a company that owns an open-source project. http://www.hikerproject.org
2007-07-22T09:05:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	that's pretty awesome ^_^
2007-07-22T09:08:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	due to the method of firmware loading into the wireless chipset, any 100.0% Free Software wireless stack would be a violation of intellectual property and significantly more illegal than, say, libdvdcss2 (which itself is probably illegal in many interpretations of the DMCA)
2007-07-22T09:08:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	There are many "mostly open-source" wireless drivers for Linux but at some point you have to use proprietary firmware, I think
2007-07-22T09:09:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	would you need ndiswrapper to get them working?
2007-07-22T09:09:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	I am using a driver that is not ndiswrappered right now.
2007-07-22T09:10:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	there *are* native Linux wireless drivers, and they're open source. they have a "firmware loading utility" that injects volatile firmware into the wireless chipset which enables it on the hardware side. on the CPU/kernel side, the driver there is open
2007-07-22T09:10:00.000Z	bluefox83	allquixotic	that's very cool...i intend to buy a laptop at some point, and i wanted to make sure i'd be able to find one with wireless that would just work when ubuntu is installed
2007-07-22T09:11:00.000Z	allquixotic	bluefox83	oh if all you want is "just works", I hear rumor that certain ndiswrapper drivers "just work" without any changes. but I don't own a card that requires ndiswrapper, so
