2007-03-10T17:52:00.000Z	profx		whats a good choice to install linux on, for file systems ?
2007-03-10T17:52:00.000Z	profx		ext2?
2007-03-10T06:28:00.000Z	profx		so there are two screens leading me into ubuntu, the first, has a progress bar, it reaches the end, then freezes, anything I can do to troubleshoot it, besides installing another OS?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		why is ubuntu this hard to install?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		is it because I have a Nvidia card?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		really?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		prove it?
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	profx		your all geniuses
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	LordLimecat	profx	i just started using ubuntu
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	profx	Biscuitian_Warhe	why?
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	profx		well, do I have to use a new CD this time?
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	profx		this is the second one, same results
2007-03-10T06:32:00.000Z	profx	Biscuitian_Warhe	I have no OS
2007-03-10T06:32:00.000Z	profx		so that would mean your info is disregarded
2007-03-10T06:32:00.000Z	profx		not the sharpest tool in the shed
2007-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	profx		maybe you need to stop listening then
2007-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	profx		so i keep freezing as ubuntu loads
2007-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	LordLimecat	profx	when you first boot, do a cd check
