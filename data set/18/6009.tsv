2008-10-26T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	msi dont make linux drivers
2008-10-26T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	you should run a live cd to see what you have and see what works and what doesnt
2008-10-26T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	they have weird power management so you'll need acer_acpi
2009-09-20T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	avoid what?
2009-09-20T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	if you run: sudo fdik -l    you can se what the ntfs partition name is and avoid it

2009-12-11T04:24:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	ActionParsnip	says no to intel core family thermal sensor, meaning i am sol?

2009-12-11T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	if you buy with a cooler, it will be suitable (just) for the chip.
2009-12-11T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	buyh a decent cooler and you dont have to even worry
2009-12-11T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoeSomebody	then dont worry about sensors ;)
