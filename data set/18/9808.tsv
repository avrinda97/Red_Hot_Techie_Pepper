2008-07-09T03:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	System/Admin/gparted or disk manager
2008-07-09T03:22:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	it's not in there
2008-07-09T03:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	try gparted from terminal
2008-07-09T03:23:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	it wasn't installed.. installing
2008-07-09T03:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	It should show up on the menu when done.. where I mentioned before.
2008-07-09T03:25:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	which disklabel should i use if i just want to use the disk as storage?
2008-07-09T03:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	you can leave the label blank or call it "storage" if you want.
2008-07-09T03:29:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	primary or extended partition? also what filesystem? ext3?
2008-07-09T03:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	if it's a separate drive then primary and being sata you can use ext3 or ReiserFS.. I found Reiser to be faster on sata drives .. especially if they are larger.  If you want the drive to have compatibility with Windows (after installing the appropriate driver) go with ext3..
2008-07-09T03:31:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	thanks i appreciate the help
2008-07-09T03:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	np
2008-07-09T03:36:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	i formatted it and restarted and it's still not showing up, ne ideas?
2008-07-09T03:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	you have to add a line in your /etc/fstab for the system to recognize it on boot. Hang on and I'll get you a line to use..
2008-07-09T03:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	UUID=put in uuid number here /media/sd?#     ext3    defaults        0       2
2008-07-09T03:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	you can find what the sd referance is by typing fdisk -l.... then the uuid nmuber by typing blkid
2008-07-09T03:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	mecha	you also have to create a directory called sd?# in /media ... as in.. /media/sdc1
2008-07-09T03:42:00.000Z	mecha	Scunizi	why is this not an automatic process yet?
