2011-06-05T00:47:00.000Z	Tuplad1		I'm really hopeless, I can't install nvidia drivers. I've read all manuals, installed EVERY-THING possible for nvidia
2011-06-05T00:47:00.000Z	Tuplad1		yet, I can't get a normal resolution AND can't get unity working
2011-06-05T00:48:00.000Z	KM0201	Tuplad1	i wouldn't consider that hopeless.. there's a lot more to ubuntu than unity
2011-06-05T00:48:00.000Z	Tuplad1		 KM0201: without drivers, it's pretty hopeless :D
2011-06-05T00:49:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	my monitor has a wrong resolution etc.
2011-06-05T00:49:00.000Z	KM0201		not really, which nvidia device did you have, and what happens when you enable the driver?
2011-06-05T00:50:00.000Z	KM0201	Tuplad1	what happens when you enable the driver?.
2011-06-05T00:50:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	nothing, screen is still shitty
2011-06-05T00:50:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	nvidia geforce gt540m
2011-06-05T00:50:00.000Z	KM0201	Tuplad1	well... w/ explanations like that, its no wonder you still have a problem... people can't read your mind...
2011-06-05T00:50:00.000Z	KM0201	Tuplad1	did the driver activate?
2011-06-05T00:50:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	yes
2011-06-05T00:51:00.000Z	KM0201		ok, and what happened when you set your resolution in nvidia-settings?
2011-06-05T00:51:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	I can't access the settings, it tells me to sudo nvidia-xconfig, but it doesn't help.
2011-06-05T00:51:00.000Z	KM0201	Tuplad1	you need to be in console when you run that command.
2011-06-05T00:52:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	xorg.conf sets Driver "nvidia", but it seems it's not the right one ... because if I reboot, the screen goes black. So I commented ou that line and I have a shitty resolution now but it kinda works
2011-06-05T00:52:00.000Z	KM0201	Tuplad1	you don't just run it from a terminal
2011-06-05T00:52:00.000Z	Tuplad1	KM0201	yes, I know
