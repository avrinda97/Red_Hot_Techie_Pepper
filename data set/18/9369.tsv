2007-04-15T11:14:00.000Z	carpola		i just switched to ubuntu and i love it so much more than windows
2007-04-15T11:15:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	so do I, but now I'm in the middle of a love-hate feeling
2007-04-15T11:16:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	Now I'm not able to login, actually now I only get a text interface
2007-04-15T11:17:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	how can I start gdm again
2007-04-15T11:17:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	I did a new partition for the /var folder, with GParted using the live CD, now I get a text interface telling me there's an error.
2007-04-15T11:21:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	Ok, it seemed to work, how do I restart or what do i do to see If I got the graphic interface again?
2007-04-15T11:21:00.000Z	carpola	Juanca	if you started it, it should go to the main login screen
2007-04-15T11:22:00.000Z	carpola	Juanca	what happened when you entered the start command?
2007-04-15T11:22:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	It didn't. I only have a response: * Starting GNOME Display Manager...   and the $ again
2007-04-15T11:23:00.000Z	carpola	Juanca	hmmmm i had that problem yesterday and i ended up reformatting. do you know how you go to that problem in the first place?
2007-04-15T11:24:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	no I've been through a lot of different problems, I'm only trying to not format because I have important information saved inside a virtual machine
2007-04-15T11:25:00.000Z	carpola	Juanca	are you dualbooting with vista?
2007-04-15T11:25:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	that's why I'm hating ubuntu by now
2007-04-15T11:25:00.000Z	Juanca	carpola	no I was running VMWare with Windows XP as guest in Ubuntu
2007-04-15T11:26:00.000Z	carpola	Juanca	hmm i had that problem yesterday but i didn't know how to fix it. i accidentally deleted my windows partition trying to merge an empty HD so i just reformatted.
2007-04-15T11:26:00.000Z	carpola	Juanca	 i would ask someone else here because i just started with ubuntu
