2011-03-27T18:57:00.000Z	Monster		you guys are useless
2011-03-27T18:57:00.000Z	Monster		yes!
2011-03-27T18:57:00.000Z	Monster		I did updates last night and now I can't get past the login screen in 10.10
2011-03-27T18:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Monster	that's areal smart attitude ..it'll get attenyion , but not much help
2011-03-27T18:58:00.000Z	Monster		I have plenty of space, I've been running Ubuntu fine for a year now
2011-03-27T19:01:00.000Z	Monster		I get a dark screen with a blinking cursor and then it brings the login screen back up
2011-03-27T19:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Monster	try the recovery kernel ay boot , then choose "fix broken packages " in dialog , then try to boot normally
2011-03-27T19:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj		ay=at
2011-03-27T19:04:00.000Z	Monster		I've got a GUI up in recovery mode, I think the problem might be a kernel mismatch
2011-03-27T19:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Monster	entirrely possible ..I had to remove a new kernel that wouldn't boot..my HW is probly too old
2011-03-27T19:06:00.000Z	Monster		my hardware is only 2 years old, and I had issues with a kernel 2 revisions back so my boyfriend rolled my kernel back, I'm going to get him to take a look
2011-03-27T19:07:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Monster	did you do the fix broken packages in the dialog ?
2011-03-27T19:08:00.000Z	Monster	BluesKaj	nope, I've got a desktop now so I'm going to leave it alone, I tend to bork systems very easily
2011-03-27T19:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Monster	well keep it in mind for your next boot
2011-03-27T19:09:00.000Z	Monster		I will
2011-03-27T19:09:00.000Z	Monster		is there any way to do that from command line?
2011-03-27T19:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Monster	well only in the kernel your booted into , sudo dpkg --configure -a , might help
2011-03-27T19:10:00.000Z	Monster	BluesKaj	Thanks
