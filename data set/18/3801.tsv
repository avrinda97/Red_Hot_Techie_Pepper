2009-08-04T00:08:00.000Z	magical_walrus		Can someone please answer my question?
2009-08-04T00:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	don't know via the shell, but via the GUI    system > preferences > apperance and put none
2009-08-04T00:09:00.000Z	magical_walrus	sebsebseb	I cannot access the gui
2009-08-04T00:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	why not?
2009-08-04T00:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	did you install graphics card driver recently?
2009-08-04T00:12:00.000Z	magical_walrus	sebsebseb	Yes, today
2009-08-04T00:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	  which graphics card?
2009-08-04T00:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	  Raenr    both of you  do the recovery mode from Grub the bootloader and do an xfix,  that should take care of your issue I think
2009-08-04T00:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	  Nivida?  ATI?  Intel?  what card you got?
2009-08-04T00:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	same question for you, have you been on that page before
2009-08-04T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	Raenr if you don't install graphic card drivers in the recommended way things can go wrong
2009-08-04T00:18:00.000Z	magical_walrus	sebsebseb	So how can I fix this?
2009-08-04T00:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	 don't know
2009-08-04T00:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	why?
2009-08-04T00:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	,but yes it may work better with your card
2009-08-04T00:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	it will stop being supported on the desktop  next April though, but oh well  9.10 is out at the end of October,  with default Ext4 support :)  for those that clean install  (and don't optionally select some other file system that isn't Ext4)
2009-08-04T00:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	clean installing is the only way to get full support
2009-08-04T00:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	magical_walrus	I read something about  having fixes for the Intel cards, so maybe your as well
