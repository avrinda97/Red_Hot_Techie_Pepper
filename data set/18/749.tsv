2011-09-28T17:14:00.000Z	notlostyet		Hey, I've just added the firefox-stable PPA but no Firefox 7? What gives?
2011-09-28T17:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	run:  sudo apt-get update    then retry
2011-09-28T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc     please
2011-09-28T17:16:00.000Z	notlostyet	ActionParsnip	natty
2011-09-28T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	ok then visit https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/firefox-stable    notice which releases are supported....
2011-09-28T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	which (If you'd actually checked the PPA) you would have seen. That's "what gives"
2011-09-28T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	its a 3rd party PPA, there is no control
2011-09-28T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	firefox 7 is in Oneiric
2011-09-28T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	that PPA is maintained by some dude, its not an official repo so there is zero jusistiction of what releases they have to support
2011-09-28T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	its nothing to do with canonical
2011-09-28T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	so you "makes sense" comment is worthless
2011-09-28T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	how is it elitism?
2011-09-28T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	no, this is the official support channel for ubuntu
2011-09-28T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	lets break it down: you assed a 3rd party repo maintained by a non-canonical member and then moan it doesn't support your release. Think about it....
2011-09-28T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	you can add it manually if you want, there are downloadable binaries on the firefox site
2011-09-28T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	I have instructed how to get it
2011-09-28T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	i'll write you a script
2011-09-28T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	notlostyet	OerHekscheck what releases the PPA uses
