2009-12-29T16:02:00.000Z	Psinetic	bazhang	ubuntuce is ubuntu christian edition. www.ubuntuce.com
2009-12-29T16:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Psinetic	then you should seek help on their support forums; derivatives are not supported here
2009-12-29T16:03:00.000Z	Psinetic	bazhang	there's no one in their support forums, never is. i have to seek support somewhere or i'm never going to get support.
2009-12-29T16:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Psinetic	then perhaps ##linux ; this is for ubuntu only not derivatives
2009-12-29T16:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Psinetic	no its not. www.ubuntu.com is ubuntu; that is not.
2009-12-29T16:05:00.000Z	Psinetic	bazhang	please define a "derivative". i understand what "distributions" are, but what's a "derivative"?
2009-12-29T16:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Psinetic	its not supported here.
