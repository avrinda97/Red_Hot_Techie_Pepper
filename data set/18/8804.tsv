2008-01-23T14:13:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	interactively....mmm..what do you mean ? ..I just try to modify boot command line, whithout success
2008-01-23T14:14:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	yes it's true, but after ?
2008-01-23T14:16:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	mm ok, but I can do this here (=>xubuntu livecd)
2008-01-23T14:17:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	with tab completion I see several command , but I don't see The good
2008-01-23T14:18:00.000Z	bidossessi	napnap	typical procedure would be "root (hd{tab}"
2008-01-23T14:18:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	no, doesn't work, complete nothing
2008-01-23T14:20:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	thx for the help, I will say you all in 5 minutes, I come back
2008-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	I do reboot X, I can't write anythin on terminal now..:-S
2008-01-23T14:29:00.000Z	bidossessi	napnap	try rebooting in level 3
2008-01-23T14:31:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	I send you PM with command line
2008-01-23T14:33:00.000Z	bidossessi	napnap	i believe grub accepts extra arguments before booting your system. just add "3" (without the quotes). that should send you to a cli login. from there, do your thing
2008-01-23T14:50:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	re, just to say you : all works fine, I'm on xubuntu harddrive system now, thanks for your help
2008-01-23T14:50:00.000Z	bidossessi	napnap	glad to hear it, especially since i don't use ubuntu myself :)
2008-01-23T14:54:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	you have forgot user pwd ?
2008-01-23T14:56:00.000Z	napnap	bidossessi	or I think if you chroot on your installed system with your livecd, you can change pwd with command line passwd...
