2006-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	HotDrive		how to see witch one is it?
2006-06-02T05:50:00.000Z	johnnybong	HotDrive	if it's a cheapo SAA7134 card like I've got (some K-World / Medion thing), probable that it isn't telling Ubuntu that it's got a tuner fitted, in which case you have to explicitly tell Ubuntu.
2006-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	how do I "tell ubuntu"?
2006-06-02T06:18:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	still there?
2006-06-02T06:30:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	I did that... long message...
2006-06-02T06:32:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	I also found this: [4302868.087000]  saa7134[0] /alsa: saa7134[0]  at 0x24000000 irq 11 registered as card -1
2006-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	do I need to roll the driver like you said?
2006-06-02T07:04:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	still there?
2006-06-02T07:07:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	I think tomorow will be a better day to try other options. Thanks a lot
2006-06-02T12:59:00.000Z	HotDrive	johnnybong	are you there?
