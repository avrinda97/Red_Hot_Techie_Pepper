2009-10-26T20:19:00.000Z	Kingsy101		ok now I have managed to get it to load youtube without crashing but now the video is just a black box
2009-10-26T20:20:00.000Z	d9500	Kingsy101	what version of flashplayer are you using?
2009-10-26T20:21:00.000Z	Kingsy101		10.0.32.18
2009-10-26T20:21:00.000Z	Kingsy101	d9500	- ^^^^
2009-10-26T20:22:00.000Z	d9500	Kingsy101	that's the most recent one. you're not trying to use the 32-bit flash plugin on a 64-bit OS, by any chance, are you?
2009-10-26T20:22:00.000Z	Kingsy101		no, my operating system is 32bit
2009-10-26T20:24:00.000Z	d9500	Kingsy101	did you do the initial flash plugin install from within firefox ( by choosing adobe plugin when you first got prompted for a plugin when trying to play youtube), from synaptic, or from terminal?
2009-10-26T20:24:00.000Z	Kingsy101	d9500	- I cant remember does it matter?
2009-10-26T20:26:00.000Z	d9500	Kingsy101	theoretically, it shouldn't, but I do recall reading somewhere that users were experiencing problems--granted, on an earlier ubuntu version--when installing directly from firefox. Why that would happen, I do not know.
2009-10-26T20:26:00.000Z	Kingsy101	d9500	- its a stupid problem to have really.. maybe I should just upgrade my distro
2009-10-26T20:27:00.000Z	Kingsy101		I just recall having issues with the new ubuntu version
2009-10-26T20:27:00.000Z	Kingsy101		it randomly crashed
2009-10-26T20:27:00.000Z	Kingsy101		when does 9.10 come out?
2009-10-26T20:27:00.000Z	Kingsy101		hmm I might just wait till then.. just install 9.10
2009-10-26T20:29:00.000Z	d9500	Kingsy101	well, a wipe and reinstall, using Karmic this time, would probably fix the problem, but that would be awfully drastic. Maybe you should just purge the adobe plugin and its config files, add a repo for firefox 3.5, install ff 3.5, and then reinstall adobe, using the tar-gz manually downloaded from adobe's site to make sure there's no problems with putting it in the wrong place when installing?
2009-10-26T20:29:00.000Z	Kingsy101	d9500	- I wasnt going to wipe it, I was just going to upgrade
2009-10-26T20:29:00.000Z	Kingsy101		using the package manager
2009-10-26T20:32:00.000Z	d9500	Kingsy101	ok, just make sure you run "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade" in the terminal instead of "update manager -d" as the former allows for installs of new packages if needed. I learned that the hard way going  from Intrepid to Jaunty on a laptop i was upgrading.
