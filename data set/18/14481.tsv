2006-12-26T11:27:00.000Z	marty		netapplet is saying wireless is disabled
2006-12-26T11:28:00.000Z	marty		Is ndiswrapper something I should look into here?
2006-12-26T11:29:00.000Z	marty		Nope, still stating wireless as disabled.
2006-12-26T11:30:00.000Z	marty		Hrm, I went into BIOS earlier and made sure that the radio is turned on by default.
2006-12-26T11:32:00.000Z	marty		In the normal applet in GNOME, it says under status of the eth1, the wireless, as "Disconnected".
2006-12-26T11:32:00.000Z	marty		So, they're confirming one another, at least.
2006-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	marty		What's the command line way of activating a NIC?
2006-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	marty	tried network-manager?
2006-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	marty	funkyHat	apt-getting it right now, I guess
2006-12-26T11:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	marty	get network-manager-gnome too (there's a kde version of the applet too but I can't remember what it's package name is)
2006-12-26T11:35:00.000Z	marty	funkyHat	done
2006-12-26T11:35:00.000Z	marty	funkyHat	now what/
2006-12-26T11:36:00.000Z	funkyHat	marty	log out and back in and it will appear in your notification area
2006-12-26T11:37:00.000Z	marty	funkyHat	it's only showing "Wired Connection" as an option
2006-12-26T11:38:00.000Z	funkyHat	marty	:-( oh no
2006-12-26T11:38:00.000Z	marty	funkyHat	oh no?
2006-12-26T11:39:00.000Z	funkyHat	marty	means your card most likely isn't supported by network-manager yet, so you'll have to carry on doing it the harder way... I doubt I'll be able to help you much with that
2006-12-26T11:40:00.000Z	marty	funkyHat	do you know anyone who will be able to help?
