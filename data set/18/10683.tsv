2007-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	hrm, dunno then, sorry, you could try sudo apt-get remove [those two packages that are giving you trouble] 
2007-01-13T15:00:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	i can't remove it coz it's not yet even installed
2007-01-13T15:00:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	and yet it's saying they have unmet dependancies?
2007-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	yep
2007-01-13T15:02:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	couldn't find package... errr
2007-01-13T15:03:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	i assume you've got universe and multiverse?
2007-01-13T15:04:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	dunno, im just new to linux
2007-01-13T15:05:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	ah, can you do me a favor and gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and paste it at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-01-13T15:05:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	ok wait
2007-01-13T15:06:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1415/
2007-01-13T15:09:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	well apt-get can fetch from ftp, http, probably ssh and a bunch of other things, so that shouldn't be an issue as long as it's correct
2007-01-13T15:10:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	ok
2007-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	ah one thing i didn't pick up on was you're running dapper
2007-01-13T15:12:00.000Z	jedrick	ademan	actually im running breezy.. im about to upgrade to dapper then edgy but i got errors on update
2007-01-13T15:12:00.000Z	ademan	jedrick	ah, well honestly, i tried to upgrade from dapper to edgy, it was a pain in the butt
