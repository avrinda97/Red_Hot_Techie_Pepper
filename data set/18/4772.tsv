2009-02-17T09:26:00.000Z	bullgard4		Where can I find a manual for gnome-settings-daemon?
2009-02-17T09:27:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	there may not be one (it's probably not recommended to run it directly, with it sitting in /usr/libexec/)
2009-02-17T09:29:00.000Z	bullgard4	mzz	Even if it is not recommended to run it directly, this should be written in a manual.
2009-02-17T09:30:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	perhaps (I actually do exactly that)
2009-05-02T00:35:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	I don't speak perl, but I'm pretty sure those have to do with conversion between character sets, not locale data. Why do you want them gone?
2009-05-02T00:35:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	(I wouldn't delete them, scripts could fail confusingly)
2009-05-02T00:36:00.000Z	bullgard4	mzz	My root partition overflows. I need to remove files there.
2009-05-02T00:36:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	recommend you fix that by moving some things to a different partition, not by removing things
2009-05-02T00:37:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	(or by removing unused packages, of course, but not by manually deleting files)
2009-05-02T00:37:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	you can move a directory tree to a different partition, then mount that partition in the spot those things were initially located
2009-05-02T00:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	mzz	Thank you for advising.
2009-07-12T14:26:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	are you trying to fix some problem or are you just curious?
2009-07-12T14:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	mzz	My Ekiga 3.2.0 loads my processor (centrino Mobile Technology) with 82% of its time.
2009-07-12T14:36:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	are you sure this is alsa-related? did you profile it or something?
2009-07-12T14:36:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	also, the files below /proc/asound probably tell you what's what in /dev/snd/.
2009-07-12T14:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	mzz	I am not sure. I am trying to find out why this happens. I do not know what the verb "to profile" means. Can you elaborate.
2009-07-12T14:38:00.000Z	mzz	bullgard4	sorry, nontrivial, can't walk you through that
2009-07-12T14:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	mzz	Ok.
