2009-11-04T07:14:00.000Z	btakita		man. i'm a little pissed that Ubuntu went with beta (as in not working) software for something as important as the boot loader
2009-11-04T07:15:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	um, you havent used linux for very long have you?
2009-11-04T07:15:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	I only used it as long as the boot loader worked
2009-11-04T07:15:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	I tried when it didn't work and stuck with Windoze
2009-11-04T07:15:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	and I have had no issues with GRUB2
2009-11-04T07:16:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	Yeah, lucky you. It's just seems a bit rushed to me
2009-11-04T07:16:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	well, you can still use Jaunty
2009-11-04T07:17:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	I will. Going to install 9.04 just to upgrade to 9.10 with the *old* boot loader
2009-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	upgrading to GRUB2 is rather painless, mate
2009-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	just whatever you do, follow the directions in the ubuntu HOWTO
2009-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	I wish what you said applied to my situation
2009-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	I did
2009-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	a few times
2009-11-04T07:47:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	others are having issues too, so it's not just me
2009-11-04T07:48:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	suck. :/
2009-11-04T07:49:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	What?
2009-11-04T07:50:00.000Z	btakita	syn-ack	yeah. It does. I'm motivated enough at this point to add to any relevant bug reports though
2009-11-04T07:50:00.000Z	syn-ack	btakita	Please do! we need all we can get
