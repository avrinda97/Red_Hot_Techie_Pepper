2007-02-02T10:15:00.000Z	dimeo		logite: there are some very good games for linux
2007-02-02T10:16:00.000Z	dimeo		quarupt; virtualbox installs the os to a virtual HD 'file" you can copy and paste inside linux....
2007-02-02T10:17:00.000Z	dimeo		quarupt: no don't think it can
2007-02-02T10:19:00.000Z	dimeo		logite: if your gonna install another os... make some room on the HD for a second partition to play with
2007-02-02T10:20:00.000Z	dimeo		a handy tool:   download the qtparted boot disk iso and burn it
2007-02-02T10:22:00.000Z	dimeo		well.. there are a growing number of mac users who are installing ubuntu instead.... I think that says something!
2007-02-02T10:23:00.000Z	dimeo		yea... dual boot is quite handy
2007-02-02T10:23:00.000Z	coach_z	dimeo	i think that is due to the growing popularity of macs over the past year
2007-02-02T10:23:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	 agreed.. pretty good hardware
2007-02-02T10:24:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	however I opted for the dell xps over the mac notebooks
2007-02-02T10:25:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	so you're triple boot on those intel macs?  Vista, Ubuntu and mac osx?
2007-02-02T10:25:00.000Z	coach_z	dimeo	those xps notebooks are about in the same catevgory, but if my memory serves me right they are just a bit more configurable than the macbook pro's
2007-02-02T10:25:00.000Z	coach_z	dimeo	no way man!!! osx is the only thing on my macs, plus they are PPC so no real dual boot options....
2007-02-02T10:25:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	the xps m1210 was a hell of alot cheaper and state of the art...
2007-02-02T10:26:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	I stuck ubuntu on an old imac... green jellybean color... mac os 9 wouldn't even boot!
2007-02-02T10:27:00.000Z	coach_z	dimeo	i ran ubuntu on my old titanium powerbook for a while ....deleted it and put osx back on....still as fast
2007-02-02T10:27:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	 my second pc was a mac 040  ... fun fun... ohh and it had a cd 'multimedia' drive!
2007-02-02T12:09:00.000Z	dimeo	coach_z	older system?
