But I cannot accsess any network resource or any local ip address or any local webservers so its like its not even on the network.
2006-09-08T11:34:00.000Z	Adam		there are 3 rules setup in ip tables erm could take some typing into here because I dont have a pastebin. Lets see if remote ssh works
2006-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	Adam		pinging the box remotley I get nothing
2006-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	Adam		I dont have internet accsess on the box as its a network issue

2006-09-08T11:39:00.000Z	Adam		never had anything like this before. Any way to check the itnerface is actually working?
2006-09-08T11:40:00.000Z	Adam		ifconfig shows its working but I cannot get accsess to any network resource but ifconfig shows its sending and reciving data

2006-09-12T06:55:00.000Z	Adam	Jack_Sparrow	is it risky?  any reason to refrain?
2006-09-12T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Adam	or partition magic if you have it
2006-09-12T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Adam	Working with partition tables always carries some risk
2006-09-12T06:56:00.000Z	Adam	Jack_Sparrow	ok, thanks for the tip
2006-09-12T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Adam	In this case. slight. but you should have a backup..
