2010-06-03T17:24:00.000Z	hellwolf06		how should i part it??
2010-06-03T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 you did a normal nstall to the flash drive? or using the usb-creator tool to make a bootabel-live-cd-flash drive?
2010-06-04T19:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 usb flash drive?  install a bootloader, configure bootloader.
2010-06-04T19:45:00.000Z	hellwolf06	Dr_Willis	i mean Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Linux mint
2010-06-04T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 You will need to  learn how to configure bootloaders. or use the iso files and grub2 and set grub2 up to boot the iso files. (thats not too hard to do)
2010-06-04T19:48:00.000Z	hellwolf06	Dr_Willis	i have drive on 4 GB
2010-06-04T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 check the pendrivelinux web site, and google for 'multi disrto flash drive' scripts - ive seen some that can put more then 1 disrto on a flash drive HOWEVER. mixxing in 2+ ubuntu and ubunti varants often cause issues.
2010-06-04T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 i put about 4 differnt ubuntu iso files on a flash drive and set up grub2 to boot the one i needed at the time.
2010-06-04T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 yes?
2010-06-04T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 what about it? its a guide.. try it and see.
2010-06-04T19:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 depends on your needs
2010-06-04T19:55:00.000Z	hellwolf06	Dr_Willis	i have already installed system on my flash how can i make an iso from it and copy to multi
2010-06-04T19:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 installed how?   I download the iso files and  set up grub2 to boot the differnt iso files.
2010-06-04T19:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hellwolf06	 i dont convert a 'normally installed system' to an iso file.
