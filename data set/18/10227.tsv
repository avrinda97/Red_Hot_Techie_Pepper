2007-03-07T17:51:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	I already got it, but I still can't compile xchat 2.8
2007-03-07T17:52:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	Ahh, in that case, you might like this...
2007-03-07T17:54:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	thanks
2007-03-07T17:58:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	I still get the "pixmaps.c:103: error"
2007-03-07T17:58:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	Can you pastebin the error and as much context as you can?
2007-03-07T17:58:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	aye
2007-03-07T06:00:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9020/
2007-03-07T06:03:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	Do you have libdevel/libgtk2.0-dev installed, and a program called /usr/bin/gdk-pixbuf-csource on the disk?
2007-03-07T06:06:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	Yes.
2007-03-07T06:08:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	OK, in that case, try cd src/pixmaps; make clean; make
2007-03-07T06:10:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	Seems like it's working this time
2007-03-07T06:10:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	It does that sometimes, no idea why
2007-03-07T06:11:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	Well, thanks :)
2007-03-07T06:11:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	If there're further problems, try unpacking the source, run make distclean, then run ./configure etc.
2007-03-07T06:12:00.000Z	Nitro	Ferret	No it worked, I'm on 2.8 now :)
2007-03-07T06:13:00.000Z	Ferret	Nitro	Excellent. :)
