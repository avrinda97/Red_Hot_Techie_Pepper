2007-08-04T16:03:00.000Z	emark2k		hello.  After a bios update, xserver has been failing to start.   I have booted in recovery mode successfully. Need to reconfigure xserver -- anyone able to suggest steps to force some auto-reconfig, or can steer me in the right direction to manually config?
2007-08-04T16:05:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg will get you a reset X
2007-08-04T16:15:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	Thanks for tip.  I typed it a few times,  am getting error message:  "conflicting actions -e (--control) and -r (--remove)     [ command was:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg will get you a reset X]    do I need to break apart or parse this?
2007-08-04T16:16:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	a sec I'm at work :)
2007-08-04T16:17:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	 many thanks...take your time...grateful for help
2007-08-04T16:18:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	are you in recovery mode right now?
2007-08-04T16:18:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	yes, looking at :~#
2007-08-04T16:18:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	try again without the sudo
2007-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	GREAT! not using sudo was key.  allowed me to select default "vesa", then pick resoultions and defaults were correct.  I clicked OK and command line came back.
2007-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	good. You should be able to get back into Gnome and set things up better
2007-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	rebooting, I mean
2007-08-04T16:23:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	excellent.  do I type exit or just power off....
2007-08-04T16:30:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	was away from the desk; reboot is the command
2007-08-04T16:33:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	 thanks for the followup!.  trying to repeat process now...  somehow I fudged it up
2007-08-04T16:39:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	that pass definitely reconfigured the system.  but the error message came back (though it looks different--screen behind it is blue)... I wonder if perhpas I should repeat, but try a different driver than "vesa"  this laptop uses intel integrated 820830 graphics.  I saw a choice for i810 that looked like maybe it was in the same class, if you will?  does this make sense?
2007-08-04T16:40:00.000Z	nickrud	emark2k	sounds right, but I don't have an intel
2007-08-04T16:41:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	 great, will give it a go.
2007-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	emark2k	nickrud	 wanted to pop back to say thanks for the help!  haven't had luck yet, but on the right track...have a great night!
