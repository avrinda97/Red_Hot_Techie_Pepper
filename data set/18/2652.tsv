2010-05-25T09:55:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	so I should do the memtest again then? It got 2 errors in different spots. I heard the memtest should run for hours.
2010-05-25T10:12:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	Thanks I'll do it again. How long should it run?
2010-06-06T14:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	How much ram do you have?
2010-06-06T14:04:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	I have 1.2 or 1.3 G of ram.
2010-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	You should initially see this: http://jordanu.dyndns.org/tmp/Screenshot-1.png for about the first 5 seconds, if you press any key within that time you should see this: http://jordanu.dyndns.org/tmp/Screenshot-2.png and after selecting English, this: http://jordanu.dyndns.org/tmp/Screenshot-3.png
2010-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	thanks. I'm off to look at it.
2010-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	YES.  #1 is the (film to little man). Is it too much to ask to "Use Words!".  Manatee! I've been asking about that image here for weeks. I'll go reboot and see if I can get the choice to test the cd. -/me exclaims "Louise!"

2011-02-17T07:48:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	sounds simple. I've been getting lost in trying to understand find command as in the undefined, yes I looked it up on google, "symbolic link".  Is that the filename? the icon?

2011-05-31T04:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	Do you have any USB drives? Try plugging one in and see if "ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/" proves enlightening.
2011-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	Try an Xubuntu LiveCD (I'd go with Xubuntu 11.10 personally).
2011-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	I've never used xubuntu. Would I also feel confused?
2011-12-20T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	Xubuntu is very similar to GNOME2's interface, and has the advantage that it will stay that way far into the future (whereas GNOME2 is pretty much dead, for any distribution).
2011-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	LUbuntu is the lightest option when it comes to Ubuntu. It will run the fastest on old hardware with low RAM. Completely separate from that though, be prepared for Ubuntu (any variant) to not work properly on their hardware. There is a chance (though probably pretty low at this point) that the graphics drivers available for their hardware will be bad enough that it's slower than Windows, and there could be bugs that in the worst case prevent ...
2011-12-20T11:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tripelb	And if you're trying to get people to use Ubuntu be honest about these types of problems. If they find out from experience that it's not quite as perfect as it was advertised to them it could seriously put them off Ubuntu.
2011-12-20T11:01:00.000Z	tripelb	Jordan_U	so you are telling me that natty is more likely to work than lubuntu. -- these are not really old computers with low ram. these are normal windows systems. Which get buggy.
