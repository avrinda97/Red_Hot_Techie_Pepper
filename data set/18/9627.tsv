2007-03-18T11:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	~/.wine
2007-03-18T11:20:00.000Z	snaidis	Madpilot	it is not there, I installed it by sudo aptitude install wine
2007-03-18T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	.wine is where wine installs the Windows apps - wine itself is whereever it needs to be, I've no idea where it is.
2007-03-18T11:22:00.000Z	snaidis	Madpilot	but there should be a wine folder at Home, why isn't it there?
2007-03-18T11:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	it'll be created when you first install something via wine
2007-03-18T11:31:00.000Z	snaidis	Madpilot	Do you know ho to install ventrilo by wine?
2007-03-18T11:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	no idea, I've used wine exactly once, and it failed to install anything that time...
2007-03-18T11:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	in Ubuntu's file manager, use Ctrl+H to show hidden files
2007-03-18T11:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	dotfiles are only created after the app has run for the first time. if you've never run wine, .wine won't exist
2007-03-18T11:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	you can create it, it won't be destroyed when you do first run wine
2007-03-18T11:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	anything - or you can just create .wine manually, and wine will use it
2007-03-18T11:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	snaidis	I've no idea what you should install - like I said, I've used wine exactly once
