2006-04-15T11:34:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Anyone know if Screen Resoltion reads a file other than xorg.conf? Mine has a resolution that's not in my xorg.conf file, and I want to add a resolution...but it's not listing it in Screen Resolution when I add the value to xorg.conf.
2006-04-15T11:36:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		So happy.
2006-04-15T09:55:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Hey everyone. I'm just curious...even with graphical acceleration enabled, I still notice tearing and other visual glitches when I move, resize, and mess around with windows. Compared to an OS like OS X, where this never happens, can this be accomplished in Linux?
2006-04-15T09:56:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	what kind of glitches
2006-04-15T09:56:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	yeah
2006-04-15T09:56:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	its called XGL
2006-04-15T09:56:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	Killgore	cool, so is Xgl sort of becoming the new standard for desktop compositing?
2006-04-15T09:57:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	no not for people with good graphics cards. Is kinda like Vista, nice looking and all
2006-04-15T09:57:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	XGL is on top of Ubuntu
2006-04-15T09:58:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	Killgore	okay, cool. Yeah, I suppose my GPU is slightly old.
2006-04-15T09:58:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	what is it?
2006-04-15T09:58:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	Killgore	Legacy nVidia TNT2 Model 64.
2006-04-15T09:59:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	yeah it probably wouldnt run 2 well on that
2006-04-15T09:59:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	not yet
2006-04-15T10:02:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	Killgore	It's supposed to look like a titled smiley.
2006-04-15T10:07:00.000Z	Killgore	GuardianAtomos	sudo /etc/init.d/sshserver restart
2006-04-15T10:11:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	Killgore	I always got flamed in IRC channels when I would ask a question in the past for other distros.
2006-04-15T10:11:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	Killgore	because everyone thinks they're so "l33t" to be bothered by "n00bs"...
