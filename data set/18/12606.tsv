2006-03-29T08:24:00.000Z	AnsiC		i runned some chown user:user *

2006-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	AnsiC		that is sudo -i
2006-03-29T08:25:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	then it is best to make it owned by root again, eh?
2006-03-29T08:26:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	chown and chgrp, since you own the file anyway
2006-03-29T08:27:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	you must "man chown" and "man chgrp" - then apply newfound knowledge
2006-03-29T08:27:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	and your system is basically just crazed now if your user owns every file on it
2006-03-29T08:27:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	i thing that too
2006-03-29T08:28:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	and next time, dont do this again
2006-03-29T08:29:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	dont sudo chown you dont need to you already own the file
2006-03-29T08:31:00.000Z	kingspwned	AnsiC	i think you should try to back up what you need, and do a reinstall
