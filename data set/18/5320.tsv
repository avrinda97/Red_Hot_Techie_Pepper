2011-10-31T00:51:00.000Z	Roasted		So, one thing I'm not sure of, before I installed libdvdcss just now, I was still able to PLAY DVDs on my computer. How was I able to if libdvdcss was originally needed?
2011-10-31T00:52:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	already had it?
2011-10-31T00:53:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	never had it. although, does installing restricted-extras enable me to play dvds similar to what libdvdcss does?
2011-10-31T00:53:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	I thought restricted-extras included libdvdcss
2011-10-31T00:54:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	I don't think it INCLUDES libdvdcss, unless I was doing something wrong. I was just ripping a live concert DVD I had for my HTPC and I had to install libdvdcss separately.
2011-10-31T00:54:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	but once I installed libdvdcss I was able to rip it. That being said, I wonder if ubuntu-restricted-extras provided me with enough functionality to play DVDs without issue?
2011-10-31T00:55:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	so it is separate.
2011-10-31T00:55:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	ah wait
2011-10-31T00:56:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	read that wrong. I thought it said by entering it and the following... meaning... libdvdcss AND restricted extras.
2011-10-31T00:56:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	right, I just read it wrong.
2011-10-31T00:56:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	already had it?
2011-10-31T00:57:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	I see. I must have had unencrypted DVDs then. A lot of them. In fact, a truckload of them, even new ones. Because I had restricted extars installed but I wa able to play DVDs fine. However once I tried to rip a DVD, I could not, and I had to install libdvdcss separately.
2011-10-31T00:58:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	there's nothing to believe. that's the only explanation, as libdvdcss was not installed. otherwise it would have returned with it already being installed, whcih, it did not. Not to mention, once I installed it, handbrake operated predictably.
2011-10-31T00:59:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	only you can confirm that
2011-10-31T01:00:00.000Z	Roasted	reisio	I was just responding in reference to the "if that's what you want to believe." Point being, this isn't a religious discussion. It's how things happened on my system.
2011-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	it's not so much that it exists, rather that it isn't automatically run in some distros
2011-11-28T06:06:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	probably on irc.gnome.org
2011-11-28T06:06:00.000Z	reisio	Roasted	yes
