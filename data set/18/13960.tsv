2010-01-16T15:22:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		I want to know why loading firefox takes longer
2010-01-16T15:22:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		when running as user then root
2010-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		it use to run fast as user too
2010-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		until I changed the firefox executabvle to fire
2010-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		I
2010-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		heard running a graphical program with sudo messes it up
2010-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		3.0? I got 3.5
2010-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		I run firefox as root
2010-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	Pathero-ng		changing the icon properties I don't use console
2010-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	That's extremely dangerous
2010-01-16T15:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	trust me, you don't want to run any internet apps as root user.
2010-01-16T15:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	you probably have an extension that is slowing down firefox
2010-01-16T15:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	yes
2010-01-16T15:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	my only advice is to rename ~/.mozilla, open the browser with a fresh config and set it up again
2010-01-16T15:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	I use adblock and noscript and my firefox is fast
2010-01-16T15:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	you can go into your firefox options and block 3rd party cookies, that will help with that
2010-01-16T15:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Pathero-ng	nothing in your home diredtory should be owned by root
