2007-06-18T13:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jordan_U	clearing out /tmp on a running machine isn't a good plan
2007-06-18T13:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	Sorry, Rictoo see Frogzoo's comment

2007-07-07T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	pmi action suspend didn't suspend the computer successfully but choosing suspend from Gnome does ( it just doesn't resume, which I think is a problem with fglrx, which is why I am trying to suspend without X running to check )
2007-07-07T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	I used sudo
2007-07-07T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	The screen went blank and the computer froze but it wasn't suspended
2007-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jordan_U	x won't start without xorg.conf
2007-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	Want to bet ? :)
2007-07-10T12:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jordan_U	deep fried?

2007-09-08T12:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jordan_U	when's this new high performance fglrx driver coming?
2007-09-08T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	Don't remember, Betas are out for some though
2007-09-08T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frogzoo	I am referring more to the "releasing" of specs ( though a NDA is less than ideal )
2007-09-08T13:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jordan_U	ok, thanks
