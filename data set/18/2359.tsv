2010-08-12T14:28:00.000Z	MadRobot		Hi all.
2010-08-12T14:29:00.000Z	MadRobot		Is the Python2.6 installation that comes with Ubuntu be default incomplete or something?\
2010-08-12T14:30:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	I don't think so.. although there are lots of extra stuff that isn's installed by default
2010-08-12T14:31:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	I'm trying to install Plone4rc1, and when I point it to the Python installation that I have already, it fails and tells me that there some Python headers missing.
2010-08-12T14:32:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	does it specify which headers it is missing?
2010-08-12T14:33:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	one moment.
2010-08-12T14:34:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	it says it's missing Python.h and import.h.
2010-08-12T14:34:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	hmm.. you're compiling something? those doesn't look like python source files..
2010-08-12T14:35:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	no. Actually that's how Plone is installed.
2010-08-12T14:36:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	hmm.. let me search around for a bit.. I'll get back to you
2010-08-12T14:37:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	thanks.
2010-08-12T14:39:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	try installing the package python-dev and then try again
2010-08-12T14:41:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	right. Thanks.
2010-08-12T14:41:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	and then point the plone installer to whereever that source is installed.. /usr/include/python2.6/ or something like that
2010-08-12T14:46:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	It seems to be working now, but I'm still not sure.
2010-08-12T14:49:00.000Z	MadRobot	Slart	It worked! Thanks! :D
2010-08-12T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	yay
2010-08-12T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	MadRobot	you're welcome
