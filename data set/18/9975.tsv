2007-01-24T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	uhm, are you sure that sort of thing isn't handled by NetBIOS rather than DNS?
2007-01-24T14:20:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	?
2007-01-24T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	names or Windows networks are handled by NetBIOS as far as i know, not by DNS
2007-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	what?  usernames are handled by the login server
2007-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	yes, and names and domains by NetBIOS
2007-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	i mean, i have a machine called "ljlbox", and i can type "\\ljlbox" from another machine *without* "ljlbox" being anywhere in a DNS record
2007-01-24T14:22:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	ah... uh. well yes.
2007-01-24T14:22:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	:P
2007-01-24T14:34:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	guess so, but i suggest you just leave it the way it is by default. if you need to *stay* root for a while, you can simply use "sudo -i", that's as easy as it gets
2007-01-24T14:35:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	that's what I thought... :P
2007-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	oh geez...oh Lord have mercy on my computer's soul!
2007-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	what's described in the howto is correct
2007-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	at any rate, just using sudo really works fine if you can take my word for it
2007-01-24T16:41:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	hehe
2007-01-24T16:41:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	the HD temperature is *one* SMART parameters (though HDs also report it separately, i believe), but it's far from the *only* important parameter about your drive's health
2007-01-24T16:43:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	well, how does one get ALL of the SMART parameters?
2007-01-25T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	AWOSDev7360	useless, been done already N times
2007-01-25T17:25:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	LjL	sorry, didn't know
