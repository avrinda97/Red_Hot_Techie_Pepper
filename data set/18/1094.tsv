2011-06-01T01:38:00.000Z	hal2100		I need help to track down a Out of Memory Bug
2011-06-01T01:39:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	what application is it?
2011-06-01T01:40:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	Thats exactly what I would like to find out
2011-06-01T01:41:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	so your oom killer went to work?
2011-06-01T01:41:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	yes, but it is a little bit crazy.
2011-06-01T01:42:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	did you see http://linux-mm.org/OOM
2011-06-01T01:43:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	I have two accounts on this machine, mine and the one of my girlfriend. Mine never had this issue, but only the account of my girlfriend has.
2011-06-01T01:44:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	I disabled all panels for mine account, because I use AWN. that is the only difference between mine account and the other (except the other cannot sudo)
2011-06-01T01:46:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	And swap is disabled for all accounts (system wide)
2011-06-01T01:47:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	I never had that problem, I am reading that page myself now
2011-06-01T01:52:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	here is what I would do: install htop, and watch the display (sorted by memory) you should see which process takes up more...
2011-06-01T01:55:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	that is not the problem. The problem is, that I cannot experience the error, but only my girlfriend can. And this does not happen all the time...
2011-06-01T01:55:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	The hunting is the problem
2011-06-01T01:56:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	I guess so - I'm searching for a tool that can be used with watch
2011-06-01T02:01:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	I found something for a start: http://unixlive.editboard.com/t5-how-much-ram-is-used-per-program  and http://unixlive.editboard.com/t4-memory-usage-retrieval-on-linux-process-wise-and-general  -- not sure if it will help :)
2011-06-01T02:08:00.000Z	hal2100	guntbert	Thank you! will try it later, now it is too late... N8!
2011-06-01T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	hal2100	Good luck :-)
