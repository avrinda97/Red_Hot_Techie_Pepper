2011-02-25T02:46:00.000Z	gwz	guntbert	I have like 3 times but here it is again
2011-02-25T02:47:00.000Z	gwz	guntbert	gparted during installation is messing up my partitions, it displays I have 5 of them wheN I only have 2
2011-02-25T02:48:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	did you boot with the gparted CD to see how your HD is set up? or: how does the live system see it?
2011-02-25T02:49:00.000Z	gwz	guntbert	yes
2011-02-25T02:50:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	and what were those results? the expected ones?
2011-02-25T02:51:00.000Z	gwz	guntbert	they all show my partitions wrong
2011-02-25T02:51:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	what system is running now?
2011-02-25T02:52:00.000Z	gwz	guntbert	windows, it doesn't help that I am unable to use wifi on ubuntu
2011-02-25T02:54:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	well - if you want to diagnose the partition issue you should boot into some live linux, start an irc client, pastebin the output of   sudo fdisk -l  and put your question to the channel again (along with the link to the pastebin)
2011-02-25T02:56:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	I may not be awake by then but others will take up
2011-02-25T03:01:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	sudo fdisk -l                 that gives a list of all partitions on all disks, send it to a pastebin
2011-02-25T03:05:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	now start gparted, check what it is seeing, compare the two views - if they differ please pastebin the text output and send a screenshot of gparted to a picturebin
2011-02-25T03:09:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	ouch, the warning from fdisk doesn't look nice
2011-02-25T03:12:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table, I have no idea how you could get such a partition table
2011-02-25T03:13:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	according to the wiki gdisk understands GPT...
2011-02-25T03:17:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	neither am I -- sorry -- but I'd be rather careful :-)
2011-02-25T03:19:00.000Z	guntbert	gwz	sorry that I couldn't really help - but I'm definitely off to bed
