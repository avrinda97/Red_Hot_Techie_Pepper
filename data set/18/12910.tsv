2007-02-09T16:58:00.000Z	_james	mneptok	 im just new to linux :(
2007-02-09T17:00:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	if i were you, i would not try VMware and WINE and all that stuff until you have a little experience. crawl before you try and walk. or run.
2007-02-09T17:01:00.000Z	_james	mneptok	how bout qemu?
2007-02-09T17:01:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	why do you need hardware virtualization?
2007-02-09T17:02:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	well, have you *tried* Linux apps?

2007-02-09T17:03:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	so .... why are you trying Linux?
2007-02-09T17:04:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	i see no point in running Linux if all you do is run Windows apps.
2007-02-09T17:04:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	it's a fair question.
2007-02-09T17:05:00.000Z	mneptok	_james	it's not rude. it's understandable confusion.
