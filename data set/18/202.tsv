2012-06-13T01:43:00.000Z	Tux_1		are you shure you did not boot into rescue mode my mistake, try rebooting and hold the shift key down and select the latest kernel from the grub list.
2012-06-13T01:43:00.000Z	Kev421		ill try that
2012-06-13T01:43:00.000Z	Tux_1		brb
2012-06-13T01:54:00.000Z	Kev421	Tux_1	it only have generic-pae and recovery mode
2012-06-13T01:54:00.000Z	Tux_1	Kev421	did you select generic?
2012-06-13T01:55:00.000Z	Kev421		yea just comes back to commaqnd line
2012-06-13T01:56:00.000Z	Kev421		it just had the new ubuntu background and said 12.04 in the middel and then poped on to command line
