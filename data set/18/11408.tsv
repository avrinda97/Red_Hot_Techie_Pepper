2008-09-24T05:18:00.000Z	Elda		Oh poo... I just set the wrong set of codecs to download :(  Is there a *HUGE* difference between ubuntu-restricted-extras and kubuntu-restricted-extras?
2008-09-24T05:19:00.000Z	Elda		Okay well have you tried uninstalling it through wine?
2008-09-24T05:20:00.000Z	Elda		If it's a windows client I assume she would use either wine or yucky cedega :|
2008-09-24T05:21:00.000Z	Elda		It's not that hard to install, hehe
2008-09-24T05:21:00.000Z	Elda		Just download the file like you would in windows and do sudo wine "nameofimVUinstallerhere.exe"

2008-09-24T05:22:00.000Z	Elda		!dualboot
2008-09-24T05:22:00.000Z	Elda		You might find that useful alms
2008-09-24T05:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Elda	Possibly.  Ubuntu will have things specific to Totem and Gstreamer, and I'm not sure what Kubuntu uses.  Many likely will be the same, but there is definitely the possibility of differences.
2008-09-24T05:23:00.000Z	Elda		Would I be okay in just installing the kubuntu restricted drivers then after this installs? Or should I yank out the ubuntu restricted codecs frist?
2008-09-24T05:23:00.000Z	Elda		drivers = codecs
2008-09-24T05:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Elda	just do both.
2008-09-24T05:24:00.000Z	Elda		alms what do you mean?
2008-09-24T05:25:00.000Z	Elda		In just do both do you mean that I should remove it?  Or just install them both
2008-09-24T05:27:00.000Z	Elda	tonyyarusso	In just do both do you mean that I should remove it?  Or just install them both
2008-09-24T05:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Elda	install both.  The only harm it will do is use an extra 20 MB or disk space or whatever, so I'm guessing that's not a big deal.
2008-09-24T05:28:00.000Z	Elda		Yep, thought so but not in the mood to muck around if I break something hehe... thanks for the info :D
2008-09-24T05:29:00.000Z	Elda	tonyyarusso	 Actually hehe it actually only took up 1290k more ;)
