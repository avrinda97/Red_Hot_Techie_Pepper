2012-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	 I went to do the nomodeset thing, so I turned on the computer, hit Shift a bunch but the grub loader didn't come up, instead an error came up saying "Checking for running unattended-upgrades"python: can't open file '/usr/share/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrade-shutdown': [Errrno 2] No such file or directory
2012-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	I don't have a idea on a fix for that, do you have a ecternal HD?
2012-02-27T07:55:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	i have an external usb harddrive yeah, not currently in use with the computer that is having these problems
2012-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	if it was me I measure the time to reinstall aaginst the fix which ever is shortest I do.
2012-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	but I also clone all installs.
2012-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	i have done extensive tweaking and stuff to this OS, and, this is already my 2nd go... I tried and tried and spent a bunch of time with mythbuntu and hit a wall of something i couldnt make work, so then i went to Lubuntu. I have spent craploads of time on this lubuntu, and since if i was to redo things i did before i would be doing the same things then its just as likely that i will
2012-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	if you mix desltops and apps like that without cleaning them out your asking for trouble really, customizing is great but do it carefully.
2012-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	i did not mix desktops and apps, this was a clean lubuntu install, formatted machine
2012-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	if you had a clone of when it worked you would be way ahead of the game.
2012-02-27T08:01:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	i had no idea i could do a "clone"
2012-02-27T08:01:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	clonezilla.org
2012-02-27T08:03:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	do it when it seems appropriate to you, nice insurance really.
2012-02-27T08:03:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	you might also try posting on the ubuntu forums the IRC is hit and miss really.
2012-02-27T08:16:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	have to changed the grub timeout?
2012-02-27T08:16:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	certainly not wittingly no
2012-02-27T08:17:00.000Z	urfr332gO	bludshot	cool.
2012-02-27T08:17:00.000Z	bludshot	urfr332gO	I mean I can try to restart the computer and hit shift to get the grub menu again, and maybe succeed if that is the right thing to try next. But now im like .. what is up with this other error
