2009-06-21T20:00:00.000Z	Dougal		But my hard drive *was* very full for a while, and i have a feeling I might be running a different file system How can I find out if I need to defrag, because *something* is slowing my computer to a crawl.
2009-06-21T20:00:00.000Z	Dougal		*sorry, that's half a question* reposting...
2009-06-21T20:00:00.000Z	Dougal		I'm told that ubuntu doesn't need to be defragged if you're using the usual filesystem, or your drive has become *very* full at some stage.

2009-06-21T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	ext3 then =)... the only way I know that you can defrag it.. is by moving files.. manually
2009-06-21T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	I think there is a way to check how fragmented a certain file is..or to get a list of the most fragmented files.. do that, move those to another drive.. move them back.. hopefully that will improve things
2009-06-21T20:03:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	the best way would be to just clear out the entire fs.. but that might be hard to do, depending on how much stuff you've got on it
2009-06-21T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	filefrag is the name of the command to get fragemtation for a file
2009-06-21T20:04:00.000Z	Dougal	Slart	I'll consider that a last resort. In the mean time, that leaves me with my first question: How to find out if/how many files are fragmented
2009-06-21T20:04:00.000Z	Dougal	Slart	ooh, thanks
2009-06-21T20:05:00.000Z	Dougal		*BUT* When I had someone help me set up the system, I was hoping to make it a dual-boot with Windows, we *may* have put a different file system on to make things easier. I forget.
2009-06-21T20:06:00.000Z	Dougal		Is there an easy way to check what filesystem I'm running?
2009-06-21T20:06:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	I ended up writing a script that moved the files with more than N fragments to a tmp drive and back.. I let that run for a while.. speeds improved after that
2009-06-21T20:08:00.000Z	Dougal	Slart	thank you, I will remember that for future. Sadly, I wouldn't even know how to write a script yet. Very new to that sort of aspect to Linux
2009-06-21T20:08:00.000Z	Dougal		In the mean time, filefrag checks one file, any simple way to use it to check *all* files? I'm not going to type in the same command a thousand times to do all the files
2009-06-21T20:11:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	let me setup a very simple script to at least get you a list of the most fragmented files
2009-06-21T20:11:00.000Z	Slart	Dougal	it will take me a minute.. I'll get you a link when I'm done
2009-06-21T20:13:00.000Z	Dougal	Slart	thank you, you've been *very* helpfull
