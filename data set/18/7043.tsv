2008-02-14T15:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	what was the exact command that gave you the error message
2008-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	 sudo apt-get install whatver_you_want_to_install
2008-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	that's why you got an error
2008-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	jay-oh-en	prince_jammys	i tried that but it cant find lamp-server
2008-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	jay-oh-en	prince_jammys	why?
2008-02-14T15:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	i may be wrong on this, but i don't think there is a single command to install a lamp server. you need to install apache, mysql, php etc... there is a tutorial on the internet called ubuntu server guide
2008-02-14T15:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	there is also something called xammp
2008-02-14T15:08:00.000Z	jay-oh-en	prince_jammys	mind giving me the link? i looked for it on google but i dont know which one was the right onme
2008-02-14T15:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	you can even get the whole server guide like this: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-serverguide
2008-02-14T15:08:00.000Z	jay-oh-en	prince_jammys	lol
2008-02-14T15:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	once you have installed the guide, view it in a browser by pasting: /usr/share/ubuntu-serverguide/html/en_GB/index.html
2008-02-14T15:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	other guides that are useful for a lamp server:    sudo apt-get install mysql-doc-5.0 php-doc            <-this will download two guides, the mysql reference manual(includes tutorials) and the php reference manual
2008-02-14T15:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	np, lots of great free documentation available
2008-02-14T15:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	once you "install" those (installing in this case is really just copying document files), they are stored in /usr/share or /usr/share/doc
2008-02-14T15:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	usually they come in both html, for a browser, or pdf to print out
2008-02-14T15:20:00.000Z	jay-oh-en	prince_jammys	your too helpful lol
2008-02-15T12:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jay-oh-en	as far as i know, you don't
2008-02-21T23:06:00.000Z	jay-oh-en	prince_jammys	thanks lol i was almost finished typing when you said that too
