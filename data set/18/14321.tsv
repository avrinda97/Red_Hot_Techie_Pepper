2005-08-22T13:09:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	perhaps mplayer can't handle sound if you're using the sound server
2005-08-22T13:10:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	Sound server? does mplayer require working sound card configuration?
2005-08-22T13:17:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	how can I be sure if I am using sound server and what other options do I have?
2005-08-22T13:19:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	in system -> preferences -> sound
2005-08-22T13:21:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	Can't mplayer work with sound server enabled?
2005-08-22T13:22:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	And can gnome use sounds without sound server?
2005-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	mplayer can use the server. and yes, gnome sounds work but only one at a time. the server is for playing multiple sounds simultaneously
2005-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	like if you're listening to music and an alarm sound goes off
2005-08-22T13:25:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	You suggested than mplayer might hang because sound server was used? What you ment with that?
2005-08-22T13:26:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	mplayer hangs because the it tries to use the sound device, but the device is busy because the server is using it. so, mplayer should use the server, not talk to devices directly
2005-08-22T13:27:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	how can I enable that?
2005-08-22T13:27:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	what's with mplayer anyway? you said totem works. anyway, it's an mplayer configuration option, tell it to use "esd"
2005-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	Totem is fine, but Im going to use the vdr mplayer plugin and I think that mplayer should work before I try that.
2005-08-22T13:29:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	ok. does mplayer hang immediately or can you get to the GUI?
2005-08-22T13:33:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	It opens but hung when tried to open file. Now I changed sound to esd but now it firt says about interrupt 11: decode_audio and then crashed to fatal error.
2005-08-22T13:34:00.000Z	topyli	OrpoU	hrmpf. then i don't know, sorry. i don't use mplayer :)
2005-08-22T13:34:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	I also tried null audio but it still complains about interrupt 11: decode_audio
2005-08-22T13:34:00.000Z	OrpoU	topyli	ok, thanks for help
