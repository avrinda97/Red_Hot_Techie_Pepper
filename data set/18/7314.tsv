2009-07-18T20:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	can you please give us a pastebin of: sudo apt-get update
2009-07-18T20:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	make sure you do not have any other package apps open (like synaptic)
2009-07-18T20:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	you will need sudo for those
2009-07-18T20:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	do you have synaptic running?
2009-07-18T20:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	you need sudo to use apt-get, add it to each command
2009-07-18T20:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	i hope only sudo -i   and not logged in as root and running an irc client
2009-07-18T20:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	run: sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock; sudo dpkg --configure -a
2009-07-18T21:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lolo	try running the commands as you instead of root, ubuntu is designed to be used as users running stuff as sudo
