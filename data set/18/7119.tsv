2008-05-02T19:15:00.000Z	amenado		mystic can you paste in pastebin the /boot/grub/menu.lst  ?
2008-05-02T19:17:00.000Z	amenado		azexian-> thats not too odd, your cdrom being /dev/sr0
2008-05-02T19:18:00.000Z	amenado		neeto-> you can do a ps aux| grep gdm  to search for it?
2008-05-02T19:19:00.000Z	amenado		azexian-> well things do changed, perhaps if you look into udev, but thats one thing i dislike of ubuntu using udev, its much more difficult to find out hte rules and events
2008-05-02T19:20:00.000Z	amenado		mystic-> im wanting to see your menu.lst
2008-05-02T19:20:00.000Z	amenado		mystic-> not here, in pastebin okay?
2008-05-02T19:21:00.000Z	amenado		azexian-> are you sure you can use hdparm on a ide? not sure if thats okay to use with scsci
2008-05-02T19:21:00.000Z	amenado		amro-> yes, you have a linux now? then you can download debootstrap and use that
2008-05-02T19:22:00.000Z	amenado		azexian-> i would google for more info on that if I were you, not too sure right of what causes that issue for you
2008-05-02T19:23:00.000Z	amenado		mystic paste in pastebin  both..we will get an idea
2008-05-02T19:23:00.000Z	amro	amenado	yes. I see one on Debian- is there an ubuntu version or will that work fine?
2008-05-02T19:23:00.000Z	amenado		fed  use also dd :P
2008-05-02T19:25:00.000Z	amenado	amro	then download debootstrap and use that to install ubuntu from the net..its the most basic one and i dont think it even have a kernel
2008-05-02T19:26:00.000Z	amro	amenado	I found a MinimalCD
2008-05-02T19:26:00.000Z	amenado		mystic we will take a look, and maybe there are some thing you can do find out which is which
2008-05-02T19:27:00.000Z	amenado	amro	thats a possibility, like the mini.iso, but i myself have not used those to install yet, other than debootstrap
2008-05-02T19:27:00.000Z	amro	amenado	thanks for the debootstrap hint. I'll use that if mini.iso proves impractical
2008-05-02T19:28:00.000Z	amenado	amro	good luck, and share the know how to us later
