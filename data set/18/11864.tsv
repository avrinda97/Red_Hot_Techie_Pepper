2008-03-09T04:28:00.000Z	Bruno_		how do i mount cds?
2008-03-09T04:29:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	they should mount automatically. The setting is in System-Preferences-Removable Drives
2008-03-09T04:29:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	ok thanks
2008-03-09T04:30:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	im trying to mount and os x 10.2 instalation disk unto qemu but i dont know how, can you help me?
2008-03-09T04:31:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	I don't think I can, but I could imagine that the disk is HFS rather than ISO9660
2008-03-09T04:32:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	i dont know what that means. qemu askas for a path to boot from cd, but i dont know it. do you know where it normally is?
2008-03-09T04:33:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	Scunizi: thanks
2008-03-09T04:34:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	normally, data CDs are formatted with a iso9660 file system. Some Apple disks have their Hierarchical Filesystem (=HFS) instead. You need to mount these manually with -t hfs
2008-03-09T04:34:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	 ok thanks
2008-03-09T04:34:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	just run 'mount' by itself in a terminal to see if Scunizi is right
2008-03-09T04:36:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	i got this http://pastebin.com/d415f5b05
2008-03-09T04:38:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	it doesn't look like you have a CDROM mounted
2008-03-09T04:40:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	after doing the mount -t hsf i got this http://pastebin.com/d1911328b
2008-03-09T04:41:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	you weren't supposed to enter that. It was just a command fragment
2008-03-09T04:41:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	ok
2008-03-09T04:42:00.000Z	soundray	Bruno_	anyway, booting OS X in a virtual machine is really beyond me -- I won't be much help there.
2008-03-09T04:42:00.000Z	Bruno_	soundray	ok, thanks for your time anyway
