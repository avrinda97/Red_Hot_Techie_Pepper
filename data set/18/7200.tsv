2008-01-24T19:35:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	wot r u trying to update?
2008-01-24T19:37:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	it looks like ur trying to specify which package u want updated ,.,. in a terminal type      cd ./         then hit enter ,. now type sudo apt-get update
2008-01-24T19:39:00.000Z	makasd0	bod_	still the same problem. Never mind that, but how to apt-get install <package>? Whatever package I try install can't be found...
2008-01-24T19:39:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	System-->admin-->Synaptic package manager
2008-01-24T19:40:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	thats in the gui not terminal
2008-01-24T19:41:00.000Z	makasd0	bod_	I got that. but in synaptic package manager I can only find installed packages...how do I install new ones?
2008-01-24T19:42:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	 try clicking the reload button in the top left corner
2008-01-24T19:43:00.000Z	makasd0	bod_	I can't find new packages...
2008-01-24T19:44:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	in synaptic go     Settings-->Repo's   make sure you have some repositories and the boxes ticked
2008-01-24T19:46:00.000Z	makasd0	bod_	that made it. Now will I be able to apt-get via terminal? Since that what I'll need
2008-01-24T19:47:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	if you can now see packages in synapti run this in terminal       sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-01-24T19:47:00.000Z	makasd0	bod_	thanks it worked :D <3
2008-01-24T19:48:00.000Z	bod_	makasd0	no probs
