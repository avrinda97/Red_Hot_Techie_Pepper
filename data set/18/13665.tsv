2009-08-10T17:48:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2		hi anyone using Avidemux 2.4.1 ? I am planning to convert a .mkv to avi but I got error on audio decoder.No audio decoder found for this file
2009-08-10T17:48:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2		Save (A+V) will generate bad AVI. Save audio will work.
2009-08-10T17:48:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2		thank you
2009-08-10T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	  depends on the audio codec the thing is using. You may need some extra libs..  run the acidemux command from a termianal look for any error messagtes that may give a clue. and/or try 'winff'
2009-08-10T17:49:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	audio format
2009-08-10T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	 i tend to use 'winff' more and more these days.. and avidumux less and less..
2009-08-10T17:50:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	I had install winff but I can't find any avi format converting
2009-08-10T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	 i convert stuff to/from avi with it all the time.  avi is just a container.. it depends onwhat codecs you want to use for the most part.
2009-08-10T17:52:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	I dont understand what do you mean . Using avidemux , it can't decode MP4A audio.Which winff doesn't even show anything at all
2009-08-10T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	 its possible you need some extra libs like 'libfaad' for the mp4a,    ive had to track down some extra libs befor for some videos i converted.
2009-08-10T17:54:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	I had libfaad installed too
2009-08-10T17:55:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	I think I had install almost all of the code
2009-08-10T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	 could be some other libs. I dont  have all the codecs/libs memorized.
2009-08-10T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	 perhaps theck the forums for the avidmux tool. searcing for that codec.   ages ago i had to recompile memcoder, or somthing  because the default dident have support for all the audio formats.
2009-08-10T17:56:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	I just use ubuntu a month ago , knowing nothing about compiling
2009-08-10T17:56:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	:-(
2009-08-10T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunewbie2	 it could be the support programs (mencoder/ffmpeg) may not have support for that format, I use the ones from medibuntu repos if possible. could be support libs missing. I do know I convert mkv to other formats here all the time.    You will just have to do some research.
2009-08-10T17:59:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2	Dr_Willis	can't find anything about mp3a at http://avidemux.org/admForum/index.php
