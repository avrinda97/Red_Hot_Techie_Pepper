2005-04-27T15:15:00.000Z	daven		remenic: i'm not particularly good with usb, but just to make sure you've checked this: it still works on other computers, right, it's not the hardware?
2005-04-27T15:15:00.000Z	daven		remenic: :)
2005-04-27T15:16:00.000Z	daven		remenic: just think of how much you're learning ;)
2005-04-27T15:17:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	heh, I'm learning I shouldn't have moved to ubuntu :P
2005-04-27T15:18:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	true, I like synaptic :)
2005-04-27T15:18:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	it's the only thing I like over gentoo and archlinux though
2005-04-27T15:19:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	in gentoo and archlinux I had a much more 'just works' feeling :/
2005-04-27T15:19:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	yeah, package management is good in ubuntu
2005-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	ah :) yeah, gentoo requires you to do more things manually
2005-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	something I secretly like very much...
2005-04-27T15:24:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	you might also want to check archlinux. The software repository leaves much to be desired, but it's a lot faster to install, and has a pretty good 'gentoo' feel :)
2005-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	ok :) rebooting now, brb.
2005-04-27T15:32:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	well, after rebooting everything works like it should
2005-04-27T15:32:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	problem solved :P
2005-04-27T15:32:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	I think the problem can be reproduced by leaving the usb stick in it for a LONG time
2005-04-27T15:33:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	I'll do that now :)
2005-04-27T15:34:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	yeah that's something that's always been difficult
2005-04-27T15:34:00.000Z	Remenic	daven	even after years :)
