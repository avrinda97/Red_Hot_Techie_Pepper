2006-08-20T11:37:00.000Z	ese5		has anyone with ipw3945 built their own custom kernel?
2006-08-20T11:37:00.000Z	verbose	ese5	i have with an ipw2200
2006-08-20T11:38:00.000Z	verbose		they use the same driver i believe
2006-08-20T11:38:00.000Z	ese5		krakensden:  it crashes when compiling
2006-08-20T11:38:00.000Z	ese5		krakensden:  undefined references to ieee80211 stuff
2006-08-20T11:39:00.000Z	ese5		krakensden: whose?
2006-08-20T11:39:00.000Z	ese5		:-/
2006-08-20T11:39:00.000Z	ese5		krakensden: but why would ubuntu patch a broken kernel?
2006-08-20T11:40:00.000Z	verbose	ese5	http://ipw2200.sf.net has latest ieee80211 stack, driver and firmware
2006-08-20T11:41:00.000Z	verbose	ese5	i'm using those with 2.6.17
2006-08-20T11:41:00.000Z	ese5	verbose	but where would I put it as far as compiling the kernel
2006-08-20T11:41:00.000Z	ese5	verbose	i have a tar of the ieee80211 1.1.14
2006-08-20T11:42:00.000Z	verbose	ese5	in the README's it says to not compile the in-tree ieee80211 or intel driver
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	verbose	ese5	all the information should be in the README of the driver source
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	ese5	verbose	yeah but I already tried compiling 2.6.17.8 without the ipw3945 and then installing it afterwards
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	ese5	verbose	and the wep/wpa wouldn't work
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	ese5	verbose	i screwed with it for 2 days
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	ese5	verbose	and i've given up
