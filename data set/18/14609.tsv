2006-08-22T05:02:00.000Z	tjs		is it possible to get a cut down image that will bootstrap the dapper install from a usb keyring?
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	I did that. used the netinstall image
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	tjs		ah
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	oh
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	I don
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	tjs		Im not sure of the brand, its a small SBC, p2 equiv
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	tjs		:)
2006-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	the dapper kernel is not suitable for embedded devices I think
2006-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	tjs		it has a CF slot
2006-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	tjs		and also a notebook drive in it
2006-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	that kernel has EVERY possible option turned on. you don't want that in a tiny system
2006-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	tjs	mwe	ah
2006-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	dapper is not the best choice for embedded linux
2006-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	tjs		Im not developing a platform for anything serious, I have picked up this machine and I want to turn it into a fileserver for home
2006-08-22T05:06:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	specs?
2006-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	tjs	mwe	arm processor, x86 emulation, p2 equiv, 256 ram, 40gig notebook drive
2006-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	forget about ubuntu and look for distro for embedded devices
2006-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	mwe	tjs	I don't think dapper will even work on that
