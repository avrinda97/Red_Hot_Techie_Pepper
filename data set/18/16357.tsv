2005-09-02T16:37:00.000Z	Tadej`Certanc		clamav-daemon: Depends: clamav-base (= 0.85.1-2~5.04ubp1) but 0.83-2ubuntu1 is to be installed
2005-09-02T16:37:00.000Z	Tadej`Certanc		but I have installed clamav-base
2005-09-02T16:37:00.000Z	Tadej`Certanc		ok
2005-09-02T16:38:00.000Z	Tadej`Certanc		thanks
2005-09-02T16:38:00.000Z	topyli	Tadej`Certanc	as you can see, it's the wrong version. disable backports and fix broken packages first. then install clamav if it is removed
