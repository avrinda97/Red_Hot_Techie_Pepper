2010-11-15T07:14:00.000Z	Big_Al		Question about 10.10
2010-11-15T07:15:00.000Z	Big_Al		New to Ubuntu...when I uploaded the latest version, 10.10, the fonts on firefox are messed up. Any ideas?
2010-11-15T07:16:00.000Z	Big_Al		10.10 only I think.
2010-11-15T07:17:00.000Z	xscroll	Big_Al	do you know where the news about that is?
2010-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	no, news?
2010-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	is it a common issue?
2010-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	xscroll	Big_Al	the news about software center.  I'm looking at the wiki page now for it
2010-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	can you give me the link?
2010-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	xscroll	Big_Al	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Software_Center
2010-11-15T07:21:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	this page is going to tell me about the font issues?
2010-11-15T07:22:00.000Z	xscroll	Big_Al	you asked me about a link for app center and I gave you a link
2010-11-15T07:23:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	 Sorry, I was looking to see if someone knew about the broken up fonts I get.  It oonly started when I upgraded to 10.10.
2010-11-15T07:25:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	Also, I'm very new to Ubuntu, so i'm still learning (if I sound ignorant it's because I am...on this issue).
2010-11-15T07:25:00.000Z	xscroll	Big_Al	it may be a bug - if you file a bug it may get fixed sooner
2010-11-15T07:26:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	thanks, I'll try that.  Have you seen what I'm talking about?
2010-11-15T07:27:00.000Z	xscroll	Big_Al	no, I haven't tried 10.10 yet
2010-11-15T07:27:00.000Z	Big_Al	xscroll	 Thanks...
