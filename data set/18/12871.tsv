2006-04-10T11:45:00.000Z	bluey		excuse my ignorance, but why does sudo apt-get install w32codecs return "E: Couldn't find package w32codecs" ?
2006-04-10T11:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	bluey	they are not in repos
2006-04-11T06:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	bluey	can you pastebin me what it wants to remove please
2006-04-11T06:45:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	ok
2006-04-11T06:46:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	http://rafb.net/paste/results/eavPVU21.html - it seems a little excessive don't you think? :p
2006-04-11T06:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	bluey	all those packages depend on that lib please do not uninstall it. (is there a reason why you want to uninstall it?
2006-04-11T06:48:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	ye, after i installed the ati fglrx driver, xv can not be used
2006-04-11T06:48:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	xvinfo says there are no adapters present

2006-04-11T06:50:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	i thought re-installing it might fix it
2006-04-11T06:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	bluey	looks like you are missing something x-video needs to run
2006-04-11T06:50:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	ye, but i don't know what, i have the ati driver setup correctly, glxinfo says direct rendering is enabled
2006-04-11T06:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	bluey	yes i saw that thats why i think something is missing but im not sure either
2006-04-11T06:51:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	i thought xv just uses the xorg video driver module to do rendering which is all setup correctly
2006-04-11T06:53:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	although i do get a strange thing with mplayer when i try and use xv, it says it can't access /dev/3dfx. which makes me think xv is trying to use the wrong video card
2006-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	bluey	could be that i would look for in the config files for xv you should beable to find them in home  ~/.xvideo
2006-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	ok
2006-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	bluey	gnomefreak	there is no config file for it
