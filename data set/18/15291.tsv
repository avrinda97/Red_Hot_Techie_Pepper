2005-05-04T06:52:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser		are the apt repositries for breezy badger up yet?
2005-05-04T06:53:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser		cool. thanks
2005-05-04T06:54:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	please don't switch to it
2005-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	bob2	why not use it, becuase its unstable?
2005-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	because things will break
2005-05-04T07:41:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	right, the single cpu kernel will work fine on dual systems, but only one cpu will be visible
2005-05-04T07:41:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	bob2	what we are dealing with is a SMP kernel on a HT system, and HT counts as one cpu (at least for me)
2005-05-04T07:42:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	it should work on any version
2005-05-04T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	you're checking the output of 'cat /proc/cpuinfo', right?
2005-05-05T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	do you have them in /etc/fstab?
2005-05-29T12:22:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	roughly 4700MB
2005-05-29T12:23:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	it's ~4GB, I don't know the exact number
2005-06-19T13:44:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	bob2	is there an easy way to remove locales?
2005-06-19T13:46:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	localepurge, if you know exactly what ou're doing
2005-06-19T15:58:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	hoary
2005-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	no, they're both in ubuntu
2005-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	Kamping_Kaiser	in universe
2005-09-07T13:50:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	bob2	me? im still trying to work out what could be causing it
