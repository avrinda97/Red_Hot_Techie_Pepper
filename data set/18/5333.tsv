2008-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	make sure your /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts file agree on the name of your computer
2008-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	you can do it from recovery mode (select it on grub menu)
2009-02-15T03:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	app > text_file
2009-02-15T03:23:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	what if im trying to do - time app > textfile - will that work?
2009-02-15T03:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	you want the output of time or the output of app in the log file
2009-02-15T03:24:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	the output of time mainly - the app doesnt output anything :)
2009-02-15T03:29:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	the output of time mainly - the app doesnt output anything :)
2009-02-15T03:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	ok time can do it... use "time -o log.txt program"
2009-02-15T03:33:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	thanks, didnt think of looking for that, should have
2009-02-15T03:35:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	time -o not working...
2009-02-15T03:35:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	although man time is telling me it should
2009-02-15T03:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	i suspect bash has built in time that is getting in the way use /usr/bin/time -o log.txt appname
2009-02-15T03:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	sometimes shells s**k
2009-02-15T03:37:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	that's a good idea, will have a look
2009-02-15T03:37:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	yeah /usr/bin/time is working, time to add an alias :D
2009-02-15T03:39:00.000Z	dmulholland	erUSUL	thanks for the help
2009-02-15T03:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	dmulholland	no problem
