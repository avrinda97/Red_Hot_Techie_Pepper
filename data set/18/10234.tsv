2006-12-30T11:43:00.000Z	siv0x	Adramelech	k its installed.
2006-12-30T11:47:00.000Z	siv0x	Adramelech	What does this mean: Now run wine without any parameters. When wine is run for the first time, it creates all necessary directories, including your fake C: drive, which is per default located in ~/.wine/drive_c.
2006-12-30T14:03:00.000Z	siv0x	Adramelech	Yes.. but what would it be if i want to just tamper with wine?
