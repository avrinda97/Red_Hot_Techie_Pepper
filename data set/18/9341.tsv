2007-10-01T08:08:00.000Z	aata		i was thinking of trying to get it included in gutsy gibbon

2007-10-01T08:10:00.000Z	aata		anyone know any bar type window navigators?
2007-10-01T08:10:00.000Z	aata		better looking than avant, but less resource heavy than kiba?

2007-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	yes
2007-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	no , it's recommended that you don't use it
2007-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	it may damage your system and make it inrepairable
2007-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	also, it is unnecessary
2007-10-01T08:23:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	srsly, "add/remove applications" is much better than automatix
2007-10-01T08:23:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	+ it wont break your setup
2007-10-01T08:26:00.000Z	magnetron	aata	fstab
