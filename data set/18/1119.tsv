2011-05-23T08:34:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	It should do, yes. Re-add the PPA using the information on http://launchpad.net/people/+me/+archivesubscriptions/ and reinstall the relevant package.

2011-05-23T08:35:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	I'm aware.
2011-05-23T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu		There was no PPA information?
2011-05-23T08:36:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	Did you look at that page?
2011-05-23T08:36:00.000Z	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu		It said I couldn't access the page rww

2011-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	what's the exact message you get?
2011-05-23T08:38:00.000Z	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu		"You do not have any current subscriptions to private archives. "
2011-05-23T08:38:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	Beautiful. I guess Software Center has multiple ways of dealing with this stuff, then, because the one I got used a PPA.
2011-05-23T08:38:00.000Z	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu		Yeah, I paided for Darwinia and then it just downloaded
2011-05-23T08:40:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	the way it works with Vendetta is that it adds access to a private PPA to your LP account, adds the PPA to your sources.list, and then downloads the package. It's all transparent so that you just see it downloading stuff.
2011-05-23T08:40:00.000Z	rww	ubuntuuuuuuuuuuu	if you don't have any PPA subscriptions on the LP account you put into Software Center, I guess Darwinia is different, and I'm not about to drop $10 to check that ;)
