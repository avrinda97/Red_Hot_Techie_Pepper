2007-03-23T14:31:00.000Z	massctrl		hi all, can I replace the uid's in my fstab with the actual names of the partitions such as sda1 sda5 etc,...?
2007-03-23T14:32:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	yes you can
2007-03-23T14:32:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	but why?
2007-03-23T14:32:00.000Z	massctrl	diepruis	because i'm going to try to make my current ubuntu install run inside a xen environment,...
2007-03-23T14:33:00.000Z	massctrl	diepruis	and the classic naming scheme just works easier with the xen config files
2007-03-23T14:33:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	ahhh okay, yes you can do that
2007-03-23T14:33:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	this way just prevents headaches with "moving" partitions and such
2007-03-23T14:34:00.000Z	massctrl	diepruis	yeah, i've read about it, makes sense in a way,...
2007-03-23T14:34:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	but if the old way works better for you then it should still work, some of the lines in my fstab are like that and it still functions
2007-03-23T14:35:00.000Z	massctrl	diepruis	cool, when booting does ubuntu allways probe for the installed hardware and loads the modules respectively?  Or is all this more or less determined and fixed at install time ?
2007-03-23T14:36:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	I'm not certain, probably a mix of both
2007-03-23T14:36:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	you can blacklist certain modules
2007-03-23T14:37:00.000Z	massctrl		depruis, cafuego_ good, I'm wondering if it will work out more or less just copying my partition into a xen partition and boot the whole thing
2007-03-23T14:37:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	good luck :)
2007-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	massctrl	diepruis	hehe yeah thanks
2007-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	I'm not entirely sure whether the xen server will provide hw interfaces the same as the bios or whatever
2007-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	massctrl	diepruis	i've done exactly the same with gentoo, and there it works,
2007-03-23T14:39:00.000Z	diepruis	massctrl	shouldn't be a problem then
