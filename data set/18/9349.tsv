2007-04-18T11:48:00.000Z	soundray		helix: it's an uptime-related timestamp. You can filter it away with sed or awk.
2007-04-18T11:50:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	the uptime-relation is obvious. but i'm looking for a way to deactivate it
2007-04-18T11:51:00.000Z	soundray	he1ix	another suggestion: "dmesg | cut -d " " -f 2-"
2007-04-18T11:51:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	it eats up space on my screen...
2007-04-18T11:52:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	i'm *not* looking for a method to filter them out on a running system. i don't want to have them at boot-time...
2007-04-18T11:52:00.000Z	soundray	he1ix	boot with "quiet" then
2007-04-18T11:52:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	is this a ubuntu-applied kernel-patch?
2007-04-18T11:53:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	i want to see the messages, not the splash-screen. and the timestamp-stuff is annoying (and useless for me)
2007-04-18T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	he1ix	I don't think there is a kernel option. You can always modify the kernel source, of course
2007-04-18T11:55:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	vanilla doesn't display them, but ubuntu does. so they won't come out from nirvana...
2007-04-18T11:56:00.000Z	soundray	he1ix	how is that sentence logically connected to what I said?
2007-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	i asked if this is a ubuntu patch, since this makes searching the sources easier
2007-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	and the standard-sources from kernel.org dont have the timestamps
2007-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	soundray	he1ix	this is the first time you're asking that
2007-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	19:52 < he1ix> soundray: is this a ubuntu-applied kernel-patch?
2007-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	he1ix	I take it back and apologize
2007-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	anyways... there seems to be no obvious way to deactivate it. i'll fetch the sources and look there...
2007-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	he1ix	soundray	thanks
