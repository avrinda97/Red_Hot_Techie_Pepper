2012-02-28T05:45:00.000Z	jaequery		hey all, ive just bought a new hard drive and plugged it in, when i do fdisk -l, i see the device and says Not a valid partition table. it's an SSD, and I want to set it as EXT4. how can I do this?
2012-02-28T05:46:00.000Z	calamari	jaequery	do you want a partition table?
2012-02-28T05:46:00.000Z	jaequery	calamari	yes, so i can mount it
2012-02-28T05:47:00.000Z	calamari	jaequery	you can run fdisk and choose option c to create a partition
2012-02-28T05:47:00.000Z	jaequery		i dont have GUI
2012-02-28T05:48:00.000Z	calamari	jaequery	(run it interactively I mean)
2012-02-28T05:48:00.000Z	calamari		err hang tight
2012-02-28T05:48:00.000Z	calamari		I may have told you the wrong letter
2012-02-28T05:49:00.000Z	calamari	jaequery	yes, I apologize.. n, not c
2012-02-28T05:49:00.000Z	jaequery	calamari	ok so i did that now what?
2012-02-28T05:49:00.000Z	calamari	jaequery	do a p and make sure it has Id 83
2012-02-28T05:50:00.000Z	calamari	jaequery	then if you're satisfied, w to write changes and q to quit
2012-02-28T05:51:00.000Z	jaequery		how can i set 83 ?
2012-02-28T05:51:00.000Z	jaequery		if i do L, it shows a bunch of fs types
2012-02-28T05:51:00.000Z	jaequery		and i do see 83 there
2012-02-28T05:51:00.000Z	jaequery		how do i select it
2012-02-28T05:51:00.000Z	jaequery		damn its been such a while i used fdisk ...
