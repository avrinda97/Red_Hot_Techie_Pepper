2007-10-18T14:49:00.000Z	dooglus		if I update to gutsy now, will I get the same as the final release?
2007-10-18T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus		the topic says " Official Ubuntu Support Channel | Please be patient and read the FAQ: https://h
2007-10-18T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus		on a standard 80-column terminal
2007-10-18T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus		will gutsy have a defrag program?  that's something I miss in feisty
2007-10-18T14:54:00.000Z	dooglus		!defrag
2007-10-18T14:54:00.000Z	dooglus		seems to be a common misconception
2007-10-18T14:56:00.000Z	dooglus		gutsy took 10 minutes to download, and reckons it's going to take 2 hours to install...
2007-10-18T14:56:00.000Z	jhaig	dooglus	Depends on your hardware, but I've installed the RC a couple of times and it took about half an hour each time.
2007-10-18T14:57:00.000Z	dooglus	jhaig	my hard disk is very fragmented.  it keeps getting slower and slower.  I think that's the problem.
2007-10-18T14:57:00.000Z	dooglus	jhaig	it's quite a new fast machine, with loads of RAM
2007-10-18T14:57:00.000Z	jhaig	dooglus	I don't think you mean fragmented, but maybe the disk is failing.
2007-10-18T14:58:00.000Z	dooglus	jhaig	I don't think it's failing - I can read and write data with perfect accuracy.  but it's over 10% fragmented according to fsck
2007-10-18T14:58:00.000Z	jhaig	dooglus	If it were just a matter of fragmentation, a reformat would fix it.
2007-10-18T14:58:00.000Z	dooglus	jhaig	reformatting has other side-effects though, like potential data loss
2008-09-13T14:15:00.000Z	jhaig	dooglus	Not about recording, but listening to.
2008-09-13T14:22:00.000Z	dooglus	jhaig	I wrote a script a few months back to listen to BBC radio.  I'll see if I can find it
2008-09-13T14:24:00.000Z	dooglus	jhaig	I found it, and it doesn't work any more sorry
2008-09-13T14:25:00.000Z	jhaig	dooglus	Thanks, but I really need something easy to use.  It is not for me - I would be happy running a script like that.
