2012-01-12T11:25:00.000Z	xtgyal		I did, "Hello how can I transfer files to and from an MP3 player plugged in via USB?  Rhythmbox can read the files, but I cannot find the player in the file explorer.  I'd like to copy the files on it to my hard drive and then transfer new files to the device.'
2012-01-12T11:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	did you look in /media?
2012-01-12T11:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	your player sees the files?
2012-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	so you know where they are located locally
2012-01-12T11:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	the app must show a location for the file being played

2012-01-12T11:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	unless you just love the cli version of getting anything done, cause if thats true you would hate it, its a gui
2012-01-12T11:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	perhaps, but teamplayer works, and it is free for 'personal' use
2012-01-12T12:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	nope, remote desktop has to get thru a firewall
2012-01-12T12:05:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	unplug the device and plug it back in
2012-01-12T12:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	xtgyal	get off the spamming
