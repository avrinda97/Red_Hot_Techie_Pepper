2005-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	usual	Riddell	are the kubuntu kde packages pulled from sid or are they not associated with debian at all?
2005-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	Riddell	usual	we make them based on the debian ones
2005-03-29T09:20:00.000Z	usual	Riddell	ok, for some reason I didn't think debian was up to 3.4
