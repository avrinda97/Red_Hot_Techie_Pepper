2010-08-07T22:22:00.000Z	sje46		hey, so my question...is it possible to install an application without using root?
2010-08-07T22:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	yes you can compile your own aplication in your own space and run it
2010-08-07T22:24:00.000Z	sje46	sacarlson	any application?
2010-08-07T22:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	any application that doesn't need access to forbiden files and things
2010-08-07T22:25:00.000Z	sje46		thanks sacarlson
2010-08-07T22:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	in fact you can run your own virtualbox and run anything in your space
2010-08-07T22:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	best to try things in virtualbox you can't break anything you can't delete and try again later
2010-08-07T22:26:00.000Z	sje46		well, what if you use a webhost?
2010-08-07T22:26:00.000Z	sje46		do they allow you to install applications?
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	webhost what is it?
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	sje46		dreamhost, sacarlson
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	does your account have access to what you need?
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	sje46		i have no idea, sacarlson
2010-08-07T22:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	if it's an internet thing and all you need is access to it then maybe
2010-08-07T22:28:00.000Z	sje46		what do you mean, an internet thing, sacarlson ?
2010-08-07T22:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	you would need to be able to setup the nat to let people come in from the outside
2010-08-07T22:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	sje46	something that needs internet access
