2006-01-26T14:55:00.000Z	christopher		+ the disk shows up in gparted, and i can format it to ext3 there.. but i can't mount it. nothing except gparted seems to recognise the hard drive.
2006-01-26T14:57:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	  Did you try to mount the partition in a 'terminal' window?
2006-01-26T15:04:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	i've tried mounting it manually before, and it hasn't worked, but when i did it now it DID. however when remounting my fstab (sudo mount -a) it complains the line containing my 2nd hd is incorrect.
2006-01-26T15:05:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	but... i can't see anything wrong with it
2006-01-26T15:06:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	 I would suggest that you mount it in a 'terminal' until you can consistantly 'mount' and 'umount' it.  Then you know what really works.
2006-01-26T15:06:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	 Thne go after the  /etc/fstab  content with some confidence.
2006-01-26T15:08:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	hmm. yeah. well, "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 ~/hd1" works, however the line "/dev/hdb1 /home/christopher/hd1/ ext3 defaults 0 0" in fstab does not... i see no incosistency there.
2006-01-26T15:09:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	 Understood.  Could it be that fstab needs    TAB    between each entry?
2006-01-26T15:09:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	i don't think so. does it?
2006-01-26T15:10:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	 Also:  I see that there is the entry         /home/christopher/hd1/          that does not need a       /       at the end.
2006-01-26T15:10:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	sorry, that was a typo
2006-01-26T15:12:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	 Well   I use     TAB   between each entry.   Maybe they are not necessary.  But I agree.  I see nothing wrong with your entry.
2006-01-26T15:13:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	  hdb1   would be the slave connector of the primary IDE cable.  The first partition on that drive.  Is that the cable connection of the drive physically?
2006-01-26T15:15:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	yeah that's the primary slave. and the partition is formatted as "primary" ext3 in gparted. it shows up in gparted, but nowhere else.
2006-01-26T15:15:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	  And I assume the diretcory  /home/christopher/hd1    actually exists.
2006-01-26T15:16:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	yes
2006-01-26T15:16:00.000Z	jbzz	christopher	  I am stumped.  Good luck!
2006-01-26T15:16:00.000Z	christopher	jbzz	thanks!
