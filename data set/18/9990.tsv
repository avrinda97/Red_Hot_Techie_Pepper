2007-12-02T06:06:00.000Z	kriel		I'm trying to follow a forum topic at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=120615 and I got to the part where I'm supposed to 'make depend && make' in the installation, however make pukes up with an error shown at http://pastebin.com/m3ff648ac . Any ideas on what I should try and do to let make go on?
2007-12-02T06:06:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	that's from 2005
2007-12-02T06:07:00.000Z	kriel	kelsin	I... so forgot to check the date... Thank you.
2007-12-02T06:07:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	once you install wine from the repos start at the "winecfg" line in that tutorial
2007-12-02T06:08:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	cause from slightly looking at it, the instructions after that (the few) are what I do when trying to get wow working, it's worked really easily for me recently at least :) good luck
2007-12-02T06:09:00.000Z	kriel	kelsin	Thank you, very much.
2007-12-02T06:10:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	you've already run a "make install" command>
2007-12-02T06:10:00.000Z	kriel	kelsin	oh. No. Duh, I was just compiling it. -slaps face- Thank you...
2007-12-02T06:10:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	then you should be good :)
2007-12-02T06:51:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	do you mean zombie processes that list as "Z" in a ps command?
2007-12-02T06:51:00.000Z	kriel	kelsin	as in system>admin>system monitor lists them as zombie
2007-12-02T06:56:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	ps will list processes, once you see the zombie one you can just type "kill <pid>" to kill it, if that doesn't work you can try "kill -9 <pid>" or "sudo kill <pid>" and "sudo kill -9 <pid"
2007-12-02T06:56:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	if it's an actual zombie process according to the kernel (with a Z flag in the ps output) you might not be able to kill it
2007-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	"ps aux" or "ps -ef"
2007-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	kriel	kelsin	the first time i did that it just spit out a help file mabob...
2007-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	does ps list it as a zombie? Z in the status columb?
2007-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	kriel	kelsin	2015 status: Zl+
2007-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	kelsin	kriel	http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/zombies.html you can probably log out and log back in to clear it, but kill and sudo kill and sudo kill -9 might not do it
