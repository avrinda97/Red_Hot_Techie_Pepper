2005-05-10T06:21:00.000Z	boredofthesane		hello I have a question, I just installed a new video card and its an nvidia 6600gt (yeah!!) and my previous card was an ati x600, my monitor supports 1920x1440 resolution which it was set to with the x600, but when I installed the new nvidia driver it won't let me get that high anymore, is there a reason why?  The video card supports this resolution as well...
2005-05-10T06:23:00.000Z	boredofthesane		maybe i need to generate a new xorg.conf? but how?
2005-05-10T06:23:00.000Z	boredofthesane		the ati driver overwrote my old one, so maybeit has something in there
2005-05-10T06:23:00.000Z	boredofthesane		I'm going crazy, i need my high res back, hehe!

2005-05-10T06:41:00.000Z	dcraven	boredofthesane	can you post your xorg.conf in pastebin.com? I'll see if I can spot anything.
2005-05-10T06:41:00.000Z	boredofthesane	dcraven	sure

2005-05-10T06:45:00.000Z	dcraven	boredofthesane	First thing I'd do is put some refresh and synch rates for my monitor in that file.
2005-05-10T06:46:00.000Z	boredofthesane	dcraven	how would i go about doing that?
2005-05-10T06:47:00.000Z	dcraven	boredofthesane	Checkout the section entitled "Undetected Monitor Specs" --> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2005-05-10T06:47:00.000Z	boredofthesane	dcraven	thanks for your help, I appreciate it
2005-05-10T06:48:00.000Z	dcraven	boredofthesane	No sweat, but don't thank me 'til it works ;)
2005-05-10T06:48:00.000Z	dcraven	boredofthesane	even if it doesn't, you display will look better and give you less headaches likely.
2005-05-10T06:55:00.000Z	boredofthesane	dcraven	nope, didn't work
2005-05-10T06:56:00.000Z	boredofthesane	dcraven	where does the gnome screen resolution program read its list of resolutions, I have a feeling thats causing the problem
2005-05-10T06:57:00.000Z	dcraven	boredofthesane	Crap, I was hoping that was it.. I don't know anything about a GNOME screen resolution program though.
2005-05-10T06:57:00.000Z	boredofthesane	dcraven	no worries
