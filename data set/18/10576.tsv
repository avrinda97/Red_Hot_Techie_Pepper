2006-11-20T06:46:00.000Z	ironfroggy		im so closed to buying a copy of XP right now
2006-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	why ??
2006-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	ive spent three days now just trying to get this box to boot.
2006-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	grub issue ??
2006-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	bad ones, yes.
2006-11-20T06:48:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	not possible to ssh the machine ?
2006-11-20T06:48:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	it wont boot, what would i ssh into?
2006-11-20T06:49:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	Wont even boot .. I see did you switched it off with the plug ?
2006-11-20T06:50:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	what do you mean? only when its unresponsive after failing to boot.
2006-11-20T06:52:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	i did not do that. it doesnt boot. therefore ubuntu doesnt have anything to do with it.
2006-11-20T06:53:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	Hum ..
2006-11-20T06:56:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	do you know much about grub beyond the usual? is there a way to get some kind of debug mode or extra verbosity at boot time?
2006-11-20T06:57:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	unfortunately i spent loads of time to fix it without luck i had to re-install
2006-11-20T06:58:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	reinstalling is what caused this mess :-/
2006-11-20T06:58:00.000Z	jumassillia	ironfroggy	was it only ubuntu or a dual boot ?
2006-11-20T06:59:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jumassillia	nothing else. one OS, one hdd, one partition. very simple setup. im completely positive its not a configuration issue. im doing something else wrong or there is something im missing that is very subtle.
