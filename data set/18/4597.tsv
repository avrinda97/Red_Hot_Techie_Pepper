2009-03-20T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	you need real player
2009-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	the links are for a reason
2009-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	if it was in synaptic id have said "check synaptic"
2009-03-20T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=3&q=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RealPlayerInstallationMethods&ei=D27DSd6_FMWktwflhrnJCg&usg=AFQjCNEYc3rHlaSnkz2Vy7Xv-CE3CRDyvg
2009-03-20T14:22:00.000Z	Kimi	ActionParsnip1	but no version for IBEX is mentioned there
2009-03-20T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	its on the medibuntu repo: http://packages.medibuntu.org/intrepid/realplayer.html
2009-03-20T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	no, real player is proprietary
2009-03-20T14:26:00.000Z	Kimi	ActionParsnip1	what do that mean ?
2009-03-20T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	proprietary is the opposite of open sourced
2009-03-20T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	a company makes it and only they have the code so noone but them can improve it
2009-03-20T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	once you get the codec you can use mencoder / ffmpeg to convert to the well documented / tried and tested avi
2009-03-20T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	windows is proprietary, MAC OS is proprietary, flash is proprietary, Linux is not, firefox is not
2009-03-20T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	oh yes youcan use it FOR free, but the source is not FREEly available
2009-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	you'll need a bash script
2009-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	its like a dos batch file but far more powerful
2009-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Kimi	i'd suggest you jump into #bash
