2008-01-13T21:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	what do you want to run on wine?
2008-01-13T21:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	wine should pick up widow apps when you double click them but you should check their website to see if the app you got is compatible
2008-01-13T21:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	well I would advise to check online cause if im not mistaken there is a tutorial to get that game running on linux especially if it was made for linux and you should't use wine for that
2008-01-13T21:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	wine = windows apps and not really suitable for gaming in my opinion unless you want to fork out money for Cedega
2008-01-13T21:42:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	right click the .exe file > choose to open with other app> you may have to click on the drop down arrow to type wine
2008-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	terminal is like msdos on windows but looks better hopefull you should be alright... a good advice you should read more on linux and its command and a hang on how it works
2008-01-13T21:56:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	how do you get what back??? please explain?
2008-01-13T21:59:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	system>pref>resolution near the bottom

2008-01-13T22:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	BlackSunrise	you need to research online most question have been asked, you come here only once you've researched, attempted it, it didnt work or something went wrong
