2005-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	x86i		Stupid question. I installed Ubuntu using the 'server' option, did what I was playing around with, now I want gnome. I've installed with 'apt-get install gnome-core' , now how do I start it?
2005-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	x86i		ah
2005-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	x86i		thanks, was unaware of that option
2005-11-09T14:20:00.000Z	x86i		Where might I have found that package, without asking? I didnt see it in the documention
2005-11-09T14:22:00.000Z	x86i		Another question, to add to my previous. Is there an option to install the ubuntu desktop without all the applications already there?
2005-11-09T14:23:00.000Z	topyli	x86i	desktop, no apps? perhaps installing gnome-core or something
2005-11-09T14:23:00.000Z	x86i	topyli	I've done the apt-get install gnome-core , but I cant start it.
2005-11-09T14:24:00.000Z	topyli	x86i	i guess it doesn't install a proper X. try installing x-window-system or some such metapackage also
2005-11-09T14:26:00.000Z	x86i	topyli	Hrm, thanks. I guess I was looking for an overly simple way to get the Ubuntu Desktop, with all the admin features, but minus the 'apps'
2005-11-09T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	x86i	the admin features are there without X :)
2005-11-09T14:27:00.000Z	x86i	topyli	Well, I mean like the Synaptics, and all that stuff. Just didnt wanna have all those games installed, dont need any audio software.
2005-11-09T14:28:00.000Z	topyli	x86i	aptitude does the same thing in console
2005-11-09T14:30:00.000Z	x86i	topyli	I know, its more to the point, I want the Gnome GUI, without the uneeded apps. Im installing it on my laptop, I have limited space. Was hoping I could choose what gets installed.
2005-11-09T14:31:00.000Z	topyli	x86i	not really. you can use the "server" install of course, and then add what you want just like in debian. well, that's what you're doing right now?
2005-11-09T14:31:00.000Z	x86i	topyli	Aye, I was hoping gnome-core would do it, but it doesnt seem to have x or anything
2005-11-09T14:34:00.000Z	topyli	x86i	gnome doesn't mean X. you can run X apps to run them on a remote X server. X is a network protocol, remember? =)
2005-11-09T14:39:00.000Z	x86i	topyli	Thanks for the help, I figured out what Im trying to do. I was making it too complicated in my head lol. I just installed -gnome-core and -x-system-core
