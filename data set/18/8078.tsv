2010-10-25T01:23:00.000Z	apparle		I have done a minimal install of ubuntu, now how do I start X?
2010-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	i don't think it comes with X... it's the minimal install :P
2010-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	install x
2010-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	I mean installed it
2010-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	uhm... ubuntu-desktop is a huge meta package.  kinda defeats the purpse.  there's guides out there.
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	I didn't install ubuntu-desktop
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	that's a package too friend.
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	you can try just installing xserver-xorg, not sure how well that works.
2010-10-25T01:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	startx
2010-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	did startx not work?
2010-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	after I do startx , I get a new small terminal in left top quarter of my screen, but in this terminal, there are no sound drivers
2010-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	you need alsa... c'mon man you installed -minimal
2010-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	I did install alsa, and if x is not started, it works fine, but after startx it says no soundcards found
2010-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	hum... that's odd.
2010-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	why the hodge-podge system anyways?
2010-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	means?
2010-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	apparle	you seem to be trying to fit a square peg into a round hole for some odd reason.  i'm just wondering why.
2010-10-25T01:31:00.000Z	apparle	arrrghhh	just to see how minimal stuff works.
