2005-08-31T08:42:00.000Z	juri		hey, decided to give the official kernel a go for the first time, and ran into some problems i'm having trouble solving as i'm not familiar with initrd, lvm or even udev very much
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	juri		it tells me, while trying to boot, that /dev/cdrom: open failed: No medium find, Unable to find volume group 306 and 306 does not exist
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	juri		i found some hits with google, but nothing very helpful
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	This is breezy, riht?
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	juri		yes
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	Which CD did you install from?
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	juri		just apt-get dist-upgraded
2005-08-31T08:43:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	When was this?
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	juri		i don't think i've reinstalled this box since debian 0.93 or something like that :-)
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	juri	jbailey	er, yesterday or the day before
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	That problem ought to have been fixed as of yesterday afternoon. =)
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	juri		oh, great
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	juri		will have to try it the next time i reboot
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	juri		thanks :-)
2005-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	The trick now is to upgrade your initramfs-tools to 0.23, and then regenerated the initramfs.
2005-08-31T08:45:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	You can either do that through apt-get --reinstall the kernel, or just mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.10-7-686 2.6.10-7-686  (Substituting the appropriate version for your setup)
2005-08-31T08:45:00.000Z	juri		ok, thank you!
2005-08-31T08:46:00.000Z	jbailey	juri	No prob.  Please ping me if you have further problems.
