2011-10-27T23:03:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	from the website
2011-10-27T23:04:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	do you *need* that version?
2011-10-27T23:05:00.000Z	sandra_	Gentoo64	I did google the subject but didn't find anything aside from using PPA's which I do now wish to do at this juncuture yet.
2011-10-27T23:05:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	whats wrong with the current driver?
2011-10-27T23:07:00.000Z	sandra_	Gentoo64	Yes I need nvidia 290.03 the current default drivers provided are buggy and from what I read nvida 290.03 driver has the bug fixes I need.
2011-10-27T23:08:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	290 isnt even on nvidias website as stable or beta...
2011-10-27T23:09:00.000Z	sandra_	Gentoo64	I dowloaded w/out any issues.
2011-10-27T23:09:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	link?
2011-10-27T23:09:00.000Z	sandra_	Gentoo64	I just need to know how too install it properly w/in Ubuntu 11.10
2011-10-27T23:09:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	if so, then extract it and cd into it, then run sh install.sh
2011-10-27T23:12:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	what bugs are affecting you btw? or do you just want the latest version?
2011-10-27T23:13:00.000Z	sandra_	Gentoo64	at this time I would just like to know how to install nvidia latest driver  lol
2011-10-27T23:14:00.000Z	Gentoo64	sandra_	like i said, extract the file, cd into it (in terminal) run ls -a and you'll see an install.sh
