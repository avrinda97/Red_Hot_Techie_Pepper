2006-01-19T14:29:00.000Z	emdash	pro	for what it's worth i didn't configure my aterm
2006-01-19T14:29:00.000Z	emdash	pro	i just aliased it in my shell and modified it's entry in the menu system
2006-01-19T14:30:00.000Z	emdash	pro	if you're using ubuntu go into i think it's /usr/applicatoins and look for aterm's .desktop file
2006-01-19T14:31:00.000Z	pro	emdash	yep i know it's invisible with the . but still it's not there
2006-01-19T14:31:00.000Z	emdash	pro	open it and change the exec= line
2006-01-19T14:31:00.000Z	pro	emdash	oh ty, let me try that
2006-01-19T14:34:00.000Z	pro	emdash	i found a file in /usr/lib/menu that contains this ?package(aterm):needs="X11" section="XShells"\
