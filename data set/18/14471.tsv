2005-11-26T17:31:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		totem says "your trying to watch encrypted DVD's without libdvdcss!"
2005-11-26T17:31:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 so what do i do?
2005-11-26T17:32:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 any guidance you can give would be great.  im lost
2005-11-26T17:32:00.000Z	redguy	shadeofgrey	read /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/README.Debian
2005-11-26T17:34:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 I DID use that script to install it and it didnt woirk at all
2005-11-26T17:34:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 it gave me the same damn error
2005-11-26T17:34:00.000Z	redguy	shadeofgrey	Erm, so you managed to install it? My mistake then, thought you were looking for it and could't find it. Maybe you want regionset?
2005-11-26T17:34:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 i never had to use that before
2005-11-26T17:35:00.000Z	redguy	shadeofgrey	sorry, can't help you then...
2005-11-26T17:35:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 look - there are 2 versionas of libdvdcss : one for breezy which is just libdvdcss and one for pre breezy called libdvdcss2
2005-11-26T17:35:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 i need to know where to getthe second one.
2005-11-26T17:36:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	redguy	 do you know the name of the marrialat or whatever repo?  i think thats where i got it last time...
