2011-11-27T08:44:00.000Z	escott	melkor	yes vfat is generic fat and includes just about everything except exfat
2011-11-27T08:45:00.000Z	melkor	escott	I am trying to boot from a usb drive and I don't know if I should try to reformat it.
2011-11-27T08:48:00.000Z	escott	melkor	i wasnt following all your questions but the liveusb process should format the disk as needed
2011-11-27T08:49:00.000Z	melkor	escott	it seems to work correctly but then I start into my normal grub.
2011-11-27T08:50:00.000Z	escott	melkor	so whats the question
2011-11-27T08:50:00.000Z	melkor	escott	and I did check the bios to mak sure I am booting from a usb device first.
2011-11-27T08:50:00.000Z	melkor	escott	I cannot boot from my usb device.
2011-11-27T08:53:00.000Z	escott	melkor	so what happens when it fails to boot. what is the last thing you see
2011-11-27T08:53:00.000Z	melkor	escott	it goes to my normal grub.
2011-11-27T08:54:00.000Z	escott	melkor	what kind of boot option does it have for the usb
2011-11-27T08:54:00.000Z	escott	melkor	in the bios that is
2011-11-27T08:54:00.000Z	melkor	escott	actually it looks like it didn't edit my grub.cfg because there wasn't a usb option.
2011-11-27T08:56:00.000Z	melkor	escott	external media, and then it lets me select my usb device.
2011-11-27T08:56:00.000Z	escott	melkor	if you have multiple usb ports it might be that you need to try a different one
2011-11-27T08:56:00.000Z	melkor	escott	I'm going to try rebooting again.
2011-12-04T22:13:00.000Z	escott	melkor	no. apparmor should not be starting dhclient. apparmor may be restricting files accessed by dhclient
2012-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	escott	melkor	on the other hand the ntfs-3g drivers are used by virtually every ubuntu and every mac osx user, while the windows drivers for ext* are only used by a few poeople
