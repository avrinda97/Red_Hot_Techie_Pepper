2006-12-11T16:33:00.000Z	Arwen	lupine_85	I'm stuck with ATi - the open drivers work, but transparency spikes my CPU usage
2006-12-11T16:35:00.000Z	Arwen	lupine_85	I want kubuntu too... but I'd have to download it, lol
2006-12-11T16:35:00.000Z	Arwen	lupine_85	is he using beryl? that tends to make scrolling slow
2006-12-11T16:37:00.000Z	lupine_85	Arwen	0.1.3 is a fair bit faster

2006-12-12T17:26:00.000Z	lupine_85	Arwen	not really, but it helps if it is
