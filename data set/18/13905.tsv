2007-12-12T00:14:00.000Z	balzac		hello
2007-12-12T00:14:00.000Z	balzac		I used the tasksel feature to install my LAMP Server
2007-12-12T00:15:00.000Z	balzac		now it says 100% on the progress bar, but it doesn't revert back to a menu
2007-12-12T00:15:00.000Z	balzac		does tasksel installation end like that?
2007-12-12T00:16:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	how long have you waited?
2007-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	does Ctrl-L do anything (redraws the screen normally)
2007-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	Ctrl-G ?
2007-12-12T00:18:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	in that case, you should Ctrl-C it and run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a ; sudo apt-get -f install'
2007-12-12T00:18:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	don't please
2007-12-12T00:19:00.000Z	balzac	soundray	i just did that
2007-12-12T00:19:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	if there were errors, repeat the 'apt-get -f install' and put it on the pastebin please
2007-12-12T00:19:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	tasksel is ancient
2007-12-12T00:20:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	apt-get -f install logs all interesting output to stdout/stderr (in the terminal)
2007-12-12T00:24:00.000Z	balzac	soundray	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47850/
2007-12-12T00:25:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	is that all the output from sudo apt-get -f install?
2007-12-12T00:26:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	your installation has succeeded.
2007-12-12T00:27:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	it's hard to tell what happened, but apparently it was just a hiccup.
2008-09-25T23:44:00.000Z	soundray	balzac	not me, I've got one
