2009-04-25T14:45:00.000Z	minimec	archman	'right click' on the network applet, 'Edit COnnections', 'Wireless', then edit your connection --> 'Connect automatically'
2009-04-25T14:49:00.000Z	archman	minimec	thanks, and for lan? maybe?
2009-04-25T14:49:00.000Z	archman	minimec	i dont get it why it won't work anymore
2009-04-25T14:50:00.000Z	minimec	archman	Same thing, but in the 'Wired' tab.
2009-04-25T14:52:00.000Z	archman	minimec	but i could connect to the network without turning on nm applet, until today...
2009-04-25T14:52:00.000Z	archman	minimec	lan
2009-04-25T14:52:00.000Z	minimec	archman	Yeah... You can do it the old Debian way, configuring /etc/network/interfaces.
2009-04-25T14:54:00.000Z	minimec	archman	That would be something like 'auto eth0' 'iface eth0 inet dhcp'
2009-04-25T14:54:00.000Z	archman	minimec	what line do i need? my interface is eth0
2009-04-25T14:54:00.000Z	archman	minimec	oh ok, thanks!!!
2009-04-25T14:55:00.000Z	archman	minimec	rebooting
2009-04-25T14:55:00.000Z	minimec	archman	good luck  ;)
2009-04-25T15:09:00.000Z	archman	minimec	auto eth0 worked, thanks; even though i don't get it why it orked if i didn't have it in it...
2009-04-25T15:10:00.000Z	minimec	archman	They changed that.. The network-manager is handling everything now... That's why. I think they changed it with INtrepid...
2009-04-25T15:11:00.000Z	archman	minimec	but i was on intrepid for 3 months...
2009-04-25T15:11:00.000Z	archman	minimec	not from yesterday
2009-04-25T15:12:00.000Z	minimec	archman	Who cares... :) It works now.
