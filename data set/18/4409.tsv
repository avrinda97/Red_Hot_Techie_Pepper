2010-05-22T09:06:00.000Z	Clouse		Hi there all fellow Ubuntu people
2010-05-22T09:08:00.000Z	Clouse		 I am having a hell of a time trying to mount my encrypted home folder from my old laptop that die.
2010-05-22T09:08:00.000Z	Clouse		Anyone care to chime in?
2010-05-22T09:09:00.000Z	studentz	Clouse	what did you use tru crypt LUKE ?
2010-05-22T09:12:00.000Z	Clouse		students: Hi there and thank you for responding, when I was setting up the the account on install it asked me if I wanted to make my data private and I choose yes. So I guess what every one Ubuntu 10.04 uses.
2010-05-22T09:12:00.000Z	studentz		That is LUKE
2010-05-22T09:13:00.000Z	studentz	Clouse	just a silly q Do you remember the pw?
2010-05-22T09:14:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	Thanks for the into, and yep looks like I'm in the trouble zone right now :)
2010-05-22T09:15:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	I am following this guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Recovering Your Data Manually
2010-05-22T09:16:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	And I am getting this error: Error mounting eCryptfs: [-2] No such file or directory Check your system logs.
2010-05-22T09:16:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	What do you think? Any hope?
2010-05-22T09:16:00.000Z	studentz		clouse there are different algorithms for encryption
2010-05-22T09:17:00.000Z	studentz	Clouse	ecryptfs is totally diff from LUKE
2010-05-22T09:17:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	Ubuntu must use one by default.
2010-05-22T09:18:00.000Z	studentz	Clouse	if you use the encryption during installation you  use LUKE
2010-05-22T09:18:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	I mentions AES in the guide.
2010-05-22T09:19:00.000Z	Clouse	studentz	Ok thanks, sorry for being slow
2010-05-22T09:21:00.000Z	studentz	Clouse	try "sudo cryptsetup luksOpen  /dev/path/to/your/home/dir"
