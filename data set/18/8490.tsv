2007-10-05T08:05:00.000Z	excalibas		please help, is it possible to install an .obj file?
2007-10-05T08:05:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	what obj file?
2007-10-05T08:08:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	well, what's the OBJ file intended for? it's obviously not an ELF shared library
2007-10-05T08:10:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	what's the OBJ even for, and how is it connected to Puredata?
2007-10-05T08:10:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	what are you trying to get accomplished, really?
2007-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	i am trying to install the wiimote external for puredata  http://mikewoz.com/index.php?page=pd-stuff
2007-10-05T08:12:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	but it gives lots of errors, so i found this page http://lists.puredata.info/pipermail/pd-list/2007-05/049792.html
2007-10-05T08:12:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	it should have the compiled external
2007-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	or am i very wrong?
2007-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	i dunno, never used Puredata
2007-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	ok, but have you used .obj files?
2007-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	nope
2007-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	hehehe ok
2007-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	seems specific to w/e Puredata is
2007-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	no, .obj is not puredata file...
2007-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	well, something related to Puredata, because .obj files don't really have much meaning in the Linux world :)
2007-10-05T08:16:00.000Z	excalibas	scguy318	ok, i will try to find something more, thanks for the pacience
2007-10-05T08:16:00.000Z	scguy318	excalibas	np
