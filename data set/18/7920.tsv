2007-10-26T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	lucianno	you should learn to use synaptic, it's your centralized software source.
2007-10-26T08:41:00.000Z	lucianno	nickrud	nice
2007-10-26T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	lucianno	open synaptic, ctl-f icewm, when it shows on the screen right click the box next to it and select install

2007-10-26T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	lucianno	when you have it installed, log out, and select it under sessions

2007-10-26T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	lucianno	system->admin->software sources, make sure that main, universe, restricted, and multiverse (in parens at the end of each line) is checked
2007-10-26T09:16:00.000Z	lucianno	nickrud	i want move the file for other package?
2007-10-26T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	lucianno	you should read that message from ubotu, it'll tell you a bit about how software is organized in ubuntu
2007-10-26T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	lucianno	then you'll have a better idea about using synaptic to install
