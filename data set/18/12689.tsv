2006-04-29T14:43:00.000Z	pvd2006	gnomefreak	mozplayerxp is  a alternative to mplayer-plugin
2006-04-29T14:43:00.000Z	pvd2006	gnomefreak	it shows up under about:plugins when I install mplayer, and it shows that all file formats are supported and enabled but when I try to open something firefox and mozilla just crash with a segmentation fault
2006-04-29T14:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	pvd2006	im thinking they would beable to help more because breezy nor dapper have that in repos
2006-05-17T05:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	pvd2006	you can try removing the gnomeconfig file and restarting gnome
2006-05-17T05:32:00.000Z	pvd2006	gnomefreak	is that ok to remove th file?
2006-05-17T05:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	pvd2006	it regenerates itself when you restart
