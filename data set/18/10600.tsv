2008-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		the grapical mode of Ubuntu is not liked by my monitor
2008-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		is there any way I can force a resolution and refreshrate during the install, when I boot from the live cd ?
2008-10-12T03:14:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		once Linux goes graphical, my monitor goes blue and proclaims "Not Supported"
