2006-04-23T15:21:00.000Z	beasty		morning all
2006-04-23T15:22:00.000Z	beasty		i got like probs installing it :p
2006-04-23T15:23:00.000Z	beasty		isn't it based on debian ?
2006-04-23T15:23:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	correct. It is based off debian
2006-04-23T15:23:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	the first release was largely binary-compatible with Debian
2006-04-23T15:25:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	I would expect so
2006-04-23T15:25:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	a lot of packages use debconf (i.e. xorg for one)
2006-04-23T15:27:00.000Z	beasty	jdong	got X ?
2006-04-23T15:28:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	huh?
2006-04-23T15:28:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	most graphical linux installs will have X :)
2006-04-23T15:32:00.000Z	beasty	jdong	can you help me ? :p
2006-04-23T15:33:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	with what?
2006-04-23T15:33:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	your kernel failed to install for some reason
2006-04-23T15:33:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	try ALT+F3 or ALT+F4
2006-04-23T15:34:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	one console should have some logs
2006-04-23T15:34:00.000Z	jdong	beasty	see if any of those provides a better reason why linux-386 didn't install
2006-04-23T15:36:00.000Z	beasty	jdong	it says md5 missmatch
2006-04-23T15:40:00.000Z	beasty	jdong	isn't there some sort of netinstall iso ?
