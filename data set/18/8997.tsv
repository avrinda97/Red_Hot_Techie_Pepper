2007-05-31T13:03:00.000Z	Kjellviz	wols_	logitech quickcam pro 5000, have read every howto i can find, they are all greek to me, have downloaded UVC driver from BerliOS, changed the makefile according to this info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCamerasLogitech   then did make and make install
2007-05-31T13:05:00.000Z	wols_	Kjellviz	is that uvc driver loaded as a kenrel module?
2007-05-31T13:06:00.000Z	Kjellviz	wols_	not sure how to check that, but i think thats what a lsmod does ?

2007-05-31T13:08:00.000Z	wols_	Kjellviz	check dmesg if it tells you its device file
2007-05-31T13:08:00.000Z	wols_	Kjellviz	and error messages would really be nice...
2007-05-31T13:10:00.000Z	Kjellviz	wols_	are there any easier ways to read the output from dmesg than the all black text on the all white background in my terminal ?
2007-05-31T13:10:00.000Z	wols_	Kjellviz	dmesg |less
