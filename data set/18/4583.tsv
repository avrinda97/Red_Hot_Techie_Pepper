2009-04-12T03:58:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	will defining search <domain> in resolv.conf fix it?
2009-04-12T03:58:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	i'm not sure if thats a valid config option for resolv.conf but if it is, yes
2009-04-12T03:59:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	lol, of course it is, its a local override for what youve been talking about
2009-04-12T03:59:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	ok then, try that :)
2009-04-12T04:14:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	multiple samba servers on a subnet should hold an election and choose a master
2009-04-12T04:15:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	will it still work without a DC and that stuff? SMB used to be windows stuff
2009-04-12T04:17:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	yea, it should work regardless of the DC, its a WINS thing
2009-04-12T04:18:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	ive tried to steer clear of that stuff, always made me cringe, WINS, NetBIOS, errrrgh
2009-04-12T04:18:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	i hate them both :)
2009-04-12T04:20:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	is WINS server part of samba install ?
2009-04-12T04:20:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	yes
2009-04-12T04:20:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	i think its called winbind
2009-04-12T04:20:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	is its configurable? ohhh, so i can install winbind without smb ?
2009-04-12T04:21:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	scratch that winbind is something else
2009-04-12T04:21:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	though from experience with bind9, i dont think i want to go to a place similar to that ever again
2009-04-12T04:23:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	roasted: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/NetworkBrowsing.html#id2577509
2009-04-12T04:24:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	fx3	roasted: thats the election i was referring to
2009-04-12T04:25:00.000Z	fx3	mrsteveman1	ahh that rings some bells, i came accross it, thanks
