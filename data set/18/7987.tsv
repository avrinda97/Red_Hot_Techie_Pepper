2008-05-22T06:14:00.000Z	AbyssGer	onthefence928	it was no copy&paste code
2008-05-22T06:15:00.000Z	AbyssGer	onthefence928	the first was the url of codeblocks where u can download the deb packages and the second one was to get the needed compiler
2008-05-22T06:16:00.000Z	AbyssGer	onthefence928	http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/5 <-- there u can find the packed ubuntu package
2008-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	AbyssGer	onthefence928	unpack it and install the 6 deb packages
2008-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	AbyssGer	onthefence928	not if you download the binary version
