2009-08-07T09:02:00.000Z	warrier		I am running the Ubuntu LiveCD
2009-08-07T09:02:00.000Z	warrier		and love it so far
2009-08-07T09:02:00.000Z	warrier		only I like the app menu and control center on Mint
2009-08-07T09:03:00.000Z	warrier		any idea how i can make ubuntu menu and control center look like that on mint?
2009-08-07T09:03:00.000Z	warrier		anyone know?
2009-08-07T09:04:00.000Z	warrier		oh....
2009-08-07T09:04:00.000Z	warrier		hellothar,were you responding to my q?
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	hellothar	warrier	 lol sorry no
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	warrier		oops :)
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	warrier		anyone know how to make ubuntu ui look like mint?
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	hellothar	warrier	thats pretty much mints thing
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	hellothar	warrier	why dont you just use mint
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	warrier		coz ubuntu provides security updates and mint doesnt
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	warrier		also i keep having issues with network connectivity when using mint]\
2009-08-07T09:06:00.000Z	warrier	hellothar	I was hoping the Mint UI was either a customized windowmanager
