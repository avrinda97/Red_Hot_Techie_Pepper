2007-06-18T12:04:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs		   shiester_miester: i'm not sure ubuntu would even allow an install without a swap partition, will it??
2007-06-18T12:04:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	no idea
2007-06-18T12:05:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	as long as you don't run out of ram :P say you had a huge amount of ram, a swap partition would be useless
2007-06-18T12:05:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	I thought it was a system requirement that the install specifically checks for
2007-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	curious: why do u have such a funky set up??  for what??
2007-06-18T12:13:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	it all just kind of happened by accident :P and it worked at one point so i just left it
2007-06-18T12:13:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	well, you're  a braver man than me.  I'm just happy having XP and ubuntu finally set up.  took me 3 complete format/reinstall.
2007-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	its not my primary computer.  i dont have anything important on it anyway, if it all broke i would just reinstall the OSs
2007-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	OK.  u must be one bad ass programmer!  I'm still a noob.
2007-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	i wouldnt say im bad-ass :P im certainly not familiar with most of the languages used in ubuntu
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	u have certification plans??
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	nah certifications are a waste of time, ive already got an I.T degree so i dont see why i would need any more
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	u work it IT then?
2007-06-18T12:17:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	nice!  expect to see your face on WIRED mag very soon! :)
2007-07-06T10:59:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	why do you have to defrag?
2007-07-06T10:59:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	hidden files are all across the disk.  moving them avoids conflicts
2007-07-06T11:00:00.000Z	shiester_miester	MISTERTibbs	thats interesting
2007-07-06T11:00:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	shiester_miester	wha'ts really puzzling is that u DON'T have to defrag linux!
