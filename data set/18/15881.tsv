2005-01-19T15:51:00.000Z	setite		thats what hotswapping hotplugging etc imply... that the system is running(hot)
2005-01-19T15:51:00.000Z	setite		kosmo agreed
2005-01-19T15:52:00.000Z	setite		thing is that when i click download ppd it just displays it as a text file
2005-01-19T15:53:00.000Z	setite		well the link for download ppd is not a file link
2005-01-19T15:53:00.000Z	setite		can i just make a text file and change the extension?
