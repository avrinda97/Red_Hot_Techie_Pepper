2007-01-04T17:53:00.000Z	adaptr		oh he's gone again
2007-01-04T06:01:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	alot might depend on what service he uses for internet too :)
2007-01-04T06:01:00.000Z	adaptr	coz_	yes, okay, fair nuf
2007-01-04T06:03:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	I think everyone needs to be fair to the newer users ... they really may have no idea what is going on and may also be embarrased by that so maybe go a little more gently ??? just my opinion :)
2007-01-04T06:04:00.000Z	adaptr	coz_	ademan: well, I'm not sure.. I think he wanted 5-second soundbite answers, and when he didn't get them he started to complain about the *conversation*, not working towards a solution for him... I think he pissed himself off
2007-01-04T06:05:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	yeah i got that but it appeared to me that he ws a frustrated new guy who didn't want to sound like he didn't know anything
2007-01-04T06:05:00.000Z	adaptr	coz_	wow.. I certainly don't read that into people's writing ;-)
2007-01-04T06:05:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	well I have been helping on other channels and i find that alot
2007-01-04T06:06:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	I can remember when i started and how little Iknew and understood, it was clear to many that I ws new, otheres had little patience for that
2007-01-04T06:06:00.000Z	adaptr	coz_	that may be it, then - I personally prefer people who come right out and say: hey, fsckers, I have no idea what I'm doing here, can someone help me do X ? to people who feel they need to pretend they're not totaaly clueless....
2007-01-04T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	well depends on from which OS they are coming from, a windows user has a difficult time understanding the procedures of linux
2007-01-04T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	it is confusing for them
2007-01-04T06:08:00.000Z	adaptr	coz_	ademan: you're both very right.... and I agree that Debianers can be quite straightlaced at times (not to say straightedged ..)
2007-01-04T06:09:00.000Z	adaptr	coz_	 of course there is
2007-01-04T06:22:00.000Z	coz_	adaptr	thanks guy I am exhausted not thinking too clearly about details :)
