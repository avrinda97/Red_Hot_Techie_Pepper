2011-08-04T04:13:00.000Z	allandee_		hi, I just installed Natty, switching applications is kind of slow.  nvidia geforce gtx460, nvidia drivers installed, i3-box, 8gb ram
2011-08-04T04:13:00.000Z	allandee_		any tips?
2011-08-04T04:13:00.000Z	allandee_		compositing_manager is off
2011-08-04T04:13:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	8 gb of ram.. that system should be flying
2011-08-04T04:14:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	yea, it is in general, but app switching is slow.  like, less than a second, but more than half a second
2011-08-04T04:14:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	you're trying compiz?
2011-08-04T04:15:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	no customizations yet
2011-08-04T04:15:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	make sure you're using the best video driver.. see the url link ubottu gave above
2011-08-04T04:17:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	grep -i radeon /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-08-04T04:18:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	try grepping nvidia..
2011-08-04T04:19:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	so it must be using nvidia driver
2011-08-04T04:20:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	yes, which is good since I have an nVidia GeForce GTX460.  it's the latest driver I can install via apt-get
2011-08-04T04:26:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	I take it it's not a common problem that Unity switches between windowed apps slowly, then?
2011-08-04T04:34:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	that'd be me, I'm not sure compiz is the culprit though
2011-08-04T04:38:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	i believe simpla is talking about ssh
2011-08-04T04:38:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	yes
2011-08-04T04:38:00.000Z	yagoo	allandee_	are you asking about resuming "screen" .. often one would use "screen -RR" after an ssh disconnecdt
2011-08-04T04:39:00.000Z	allandee_	yagoo	no, the issue is interactive operation on a non-controlled (virutally hosted) box, specifially apt-get and dpkg-reconfigure
