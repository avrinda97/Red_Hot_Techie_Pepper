2011-02-10T00:23:00.000Z	tomasm-		i am using fedora 12 right now and want to upgrade to a newer distro - i was wonderin what some of the advantages of ubuntu might be... i'm a web developer so I'm needing some dev tools/services but also want something with a nice gui and application set, etc.
2011-02-10T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	what tools do you use?
2011-02-10T00:25:00.000Z	tomasm-	ActionParsnip	well i code in php, so it would be nice to have some IDE tools.... plus gimp, inkscape, and other graphic stuff.... i dont think it's anything too different - just wondering about comparing fedora to ubuntu in general
2011-02-10T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	there are lots of IDEs in ubuntu
2011-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	tomasm-	ActionParsnip	does ubuntu have a comparable package repository compared to fedora? i know some distros like to be stripped down, forcing you to install from source individually
2011-02-10T00:30:00.000Z	tomasm-	ActionParsnip	and also multimedia - ie movies, mp3's, etc..
2011-02-10T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	there is a handy pair of packages which will pull in pretty much all you can need:  ubuntu-restricted-extras    and by adding the medibuntu repo: w32codecs
2011-02-10T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	desktop has a desktop, server doesn't and is also optomised for background processes
2011-02-10T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	if you want a mouse based interface to the system, install the desktop
2011-02-10T00:38:00.000Z	tomasm-	ActionParsnip	now if i have an AMDx64 chip, should i still get the 32-bit version?
2011-02-10T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	yes, most 64bit CPUs can emulate 32bit, which is why you could run 32bit XP on your 64bit CPU. If you have more than 3Gb RAM you may want to look at 64bit ubuntu. You can se 32bit Ubuntu with PAE kernel and access 64Gb RAM though
2011-02-10T00:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	squashfs
2011-03-10T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	if you install vlc and gnome-mplayer it will pull in a tonne of codecs. You can also add the w32codecs package from medibuntu repo to maybe get what you need
2012-05-31T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	use ALT+F2 instead
2012-05-31T05:05:00.000Z	tomasm-	ActionParsnip	how come that's not mentioned in the shortcuts screen?
2012-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	not sure dude, sorry
2012-05-31T05:07:00.000Z	tomasm-	ActionParsnip	was just curious how to find out what the shortcuts are.... seems to all be listed under the system settings
2012-05-31T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tomasm-	hold superL (aka 'windows key') and you'll see them
