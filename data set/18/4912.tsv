2009-01-17T01:39:00.000Z	JessicaParker		hi looked in google & forums no joy,  done an auto update recently and now have two problems  Error : Opening the cash could not open file /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin open(13 permission denied)
2009-01-17T01:40:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	check the permissions on that file
2009-01-17T01:42:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	srcpkgcache.bin is 644 and owned by root
2009-01-17T01:44:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	and it's 644 ?
2009-01-17T01:44:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	the directory apt is also root-owned and 755
2009-01-17T01:47:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	are u trying to install something?
2009-01-17T01:50:00.000Z	JessicaParker	dayo_	no but i've got a red no entry sign on the top left of my screen

2009-01-17T01:53:00.000Z	JessicaParker	dayo_	deleted the files does it say to delete the entire directory ?
2009-01-17T01:54:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	they're saying remove srcpkgcache.bin and pkgcache.bin, then run sudo aptitude update
2009-01-17T01:54:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	JUST the files
2009-01-17T01:54:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	it didn't work?
2009-01-17T01:56:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	did u click it?
2009-01-17T01:57:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	apt dir should be 755 not 777
2009-01-17T01:59:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	yes, but i don't know if that will solve the issue.
2009-01-17T02:01:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	now it's 755. When did this issue first crop up?
2009-01-17T02:03:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	u did a month's worth of updates? is that right?
2009-01-17T02:06:00.000Z	dayo_	JessicaParker	cool :-)
