2006-10-08T08:52:00.000Z	MissLady		I installed Ubuntu on my HDD...I need help to config my USBcableModem... it worked fine and automatically with live-cd. So i did dmesg live-cd vs installation to compare what was different.I saw different things between both modes. Can anyone would help me please ?
2006-10-08T08:52:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	on the live cd, do lsmod, and write down the modules that are in use.
2006-10-08T08:54:00.000Z	MissLady	sethk	i did lsmod and installed modules who's missing and reboot but nothing worked so i did dmesg to compare and i see now errors in installation
2006-10-08T08:54:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	you are ahead of me.  :)
2006-10-08T08:54:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	I didn't mean to imply that dmesg wasn't a good thing to do, just that lsmod provides useful info also
2006-10-08T08:55:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	when you say errors in installation, what do you mean specifically?
2006-10-08T08:56:00.000Z	MissLady	sethk	USB HC takeover failed! (BIOS/SMM bug)
2006-10-08T08:56:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	hmm, that's nasty.
2006-10-08T08:57:00.000Z	MissLady	sethk	0000:00:01.2: Can't reset
2006-10-08T08:57:00.000Z	MissLady	sethk	ohci_hcd 0000:00:01.2: init 0000:00:01.2 fail, -16
2006-10-08T08:57:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	you might try unloading and reloading the main usb module, which might be uhci
2006-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	MissLady	sethk	ok but how to unload ?
2006-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	rmmod
2006-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	it won't let you unload, without unloading things that depend on it first.
2006-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	so you would have to rmmod a bunch of stuff.
2006-10-08T08:59:00.000Z	MissLady	sethk	k thx :)
2006-10-08T08:59:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	you might do a considerable amount of work and end up back exactly where you are at this moment
2006-10-08T08:59:00.000Z	sethk	MissLady	it's worth trying, but it isn't odds on.
