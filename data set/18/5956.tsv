2008-07-25T11:30:00.000Z	ahorner	stage73	yes and its been on for a few days but i just noticed this. i know for sure my pc can handle it
2008-07-25T11:31:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	i imagine it can, but i would turn that stuff off just to see what happens
2008-07-25T11:31:00.000Z	ahorner	stage73	how would i do that from terminal

2008-07-25T11:36:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	blind leading the blind, but i do know the ubuntu option to turn things off in a cmd prompt is gnome-appearance-properties
2008-07-25T11:36:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	np wish i could be of more help, does it start?
2008-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	try alt-f2 and gnome-appearance-preferences
2008-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	!
2008-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	- yes, that would be my short term memory failing

2008-07-25T11:44:00.000Z	stage73	ahorner	y'know that's pretty much what you'd be doing anyway
