2012-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	cowsquad		i follow instructions on ubuntuforums, but i did not get the upgrade option on Update Manager
2012-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	you know its in develoment still?
2012-09-09T05:04:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	you probably need to go to softwrae sorces and set it as any release, to see the 12.10.
2012-09-09T05:05:00.000Z	cowsquad	wilee-nilee	I had, but i keep checking and it wont show me the upgrade. lAME
2012-09-09T05:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	IF you want all of it removed read carefully. http://bigbrovar.aoizora.org/index.php/2010/01/10/how-to-safely-remove-ppa-repository-from-ubuntu/
2012-09-09T06:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	the channel you want is #uibuntu+1
2012-10-20T22:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	That can be a per computer model issue.
2012-10-20T22:36:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	Concerning the suspend topic I see somestuff on the web, may be a bug. I'm on a a205 right now I use the dropdown top right to suspend myself.
2012-10-24T02:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	You have like noscript installed blocking flash?
2012-10-24T02:31:00.000Z	cowsquad	wilee-nilee	what is that noscript installed blocking flash?
2012-10-24T02:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	noscript is a FF addon that blocks flash, if you don't know what it is then I would think you have not installed it.
2012-10-24T02:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	The main question here is there any add ons that would be blocking what you need like adblock...etc.
2012-10-24T02:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	Hehe starbucks I use opera to sign in there my FF has a bunch of block addons,
2012-10-24T02:37:00.000Z	cowsquad	wilee-nilee	is there any way to fix the blocking thing on ubuntu
2012-10-24T02:38:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	I'm talking about installed add ons that block.
2012-10-24T02:39:00.000Z	cowsquad	wilee-nilee	You i disable my add ons then?
2012-10-24T02:40:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	 I don't know what your add ons are, take a look at what they do I guess, this may or may not be the problem. You suggest chrome does not work as well, check add ons there if you have any, we have to somewhat guess here.
2012-10-24T02:41:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	cowsquad	Check with the IT department there.
