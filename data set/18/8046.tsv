2007-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	no, nothing requires 64-bit :) some software requires 32-bit tho
2007-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	beanage	Evanlec	googles not turning up much but feisty fawn crap.
2007-10-10T07:46:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	i think beryl might suit your version better, im not sure about compiz on dapper, try here http://forum.beryl-project.org/
2007-10-10T07:46:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	if i can answer them i will
2007-10-10T07:47:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	what kinda vid card ya got?
2007-10-10T07:50:00.000Z	beanage	Evanlec	if I was using windows I would use run and through up dxdiag to get a direct X diagnostic, how do I do that on linux?
2007-10-10T07:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	you can try 'lspci' on the command line
2007-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	beanage	Evanlec	>> So how do I update the video card drivers? Or use linux to check what it thinks I'm using?
2007-10-10T07:56:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	you know how to open the terminal?
2007-10-10T07:57:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	try typing lspci at your terminal
2007-10-10T07:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	yea, see if u can find something that looks like your vid card
2007-10-10T07:59:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	okay, well, here's where you get to edit your xorg.conf file...and trust me you'll probably do it atleast a few times before you get things right :)
2007-10-10T08:00:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	its a lot of fun trust me lol....*sarcasm*
2007-10-10T08:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	the rescue from that is 'sudo dpkg reconfigure xorg-server' from the terminal
2007-10-10T08:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	beanage	not reinstall but reconfigure, but read this page first: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
