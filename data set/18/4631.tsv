2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	swoody		I'm dual booting Ubuntu and FreeBSD, but I need to add FreeBSD to the GRUB menu, anyone know how?
2009-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	of course
2009-06-05T04:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	gksudo /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-06-05T04:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	oh  put gedit in that
2009-06-05T04:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-06-05T04:08:00.000Z	swoody	sebsebseb	kitche what do I add to the menu, then?
2009-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	similar to the  Ubuntu entry, just change it,  for the other partition
2009-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	and the name or you might get confussed
2009-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	well I assume  it's like booting another Linux distro, when it comes to FreeBSD,  but by the sounds of what kitche is saying I might be wrong
2009-06-05T04:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	virtual machines :) so much better than dual or triple or whatever boot, normalley
2009-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	when trying out  Linux or BSD
2009-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	swoody	sebsebseb	 haha, but where's the sense of adventure in that??
2009-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	 I suppouse,  but nice to have a good host OS, and then try other OS's out in it
2009-06-05T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	only thing with doing that though, is you woudn't know how well it would really run on your hardware if it was psyically installed
2009-06-05T04:14:00.000Z	swoody	sebsebseb	 true, true
2009-06-05T04:15:00.000Z	swoody	sebsebseb	 I just like playing around ;)
2009-06-05T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	yeah same here, and  my partition set up and that is a bit uh. so I am better off doing most of my playing around with vm's
2009-06-05T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	swoody	doing that again soon, anyway off topic now
