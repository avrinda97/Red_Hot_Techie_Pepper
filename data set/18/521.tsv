2012-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	khaos_		hi
2012-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	khaos_		I have a problem with fn keys for brightness with my laptop and nvidia propertiary driver
2012-08-08T13:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	what make and model laptop?>
2012-08-08T13:21:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	sony vaio vgn fz31z
2012-08-08T13:21:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	and im using nvidia propertiary driver version current (recommended one)
2012-08-08T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	try the boot option: acpi_backlight=vendor
2012-08-08T13:44:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	i have added acpi backlight for vendor i have updated grub but the keys are not working
2012-08-08T13:45:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	my grub cmd line linxu default : quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor
2012-08-08T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	try the boot option: acpi_osi=LINUX
2012-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	ok i must remove the acpi_backlihgt/
2012-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	I'd also report a bug
2012-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	could try Quantal liveCD to see if the newer kernel plays nicer
2012-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	I think that is a nvidia problem with the propertiary
2012-08-08T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	possibly, or it could be acpi based
2012-08-08T13:49:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	ok thank you i must remove the previous about the vendor ok?
2012-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	could try both and then just one
2012-08-08T13:52:00.000Z	khaos_	ActionParsnip	thanks for the help.Trying now.Is there any other same bug report for vaio/
2012-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	khaos_	ubuntu-bug acpi    will start the process
