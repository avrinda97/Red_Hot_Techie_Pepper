2010-09-27T22:31:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila		I need some help with "systemconfigurator --runboot". It says "Error: None of the following bootloaders were successfully setup on your system: YaBoot,Iseries,EFI,Elilo,Lilo,Grub,Palo,Aboot,ZIPL,Kboot", but I obviously have Grub installed.
2010-09-27T22:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 it may be not set to handle 'grub2' thats the default in ubuntu now
2010-09-27T22:32:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	Oh well
2010-09-27T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 and that program may not support grub2... Ive never used systemconfigurator
2010-09-27T22:33:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	Oh well. Thanks anyways
2010-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 You need to have  the disk partioned in a way that windows has a space tio install to.
2010-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 you have just linux on the machine now?
2010-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	Yes
2010-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	Any program I could burn and boot from a disk?
2010-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 then you need to resize your partitions and make a unallocated space for windows to format/install to. gparted can do that.
2010-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	What if I want to remove linux completely, a fresh start?
2010-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 then delete all partitions. and reboot windows installer cd.
2010-11-06T13:08:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	So are you telling me to start Gparted while I've booted from my linux HDD?
2010-11-06T13:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 yes. or use a live cd.
2010-11-06T13:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 if you want to delete linux and install windows. You basically erase the HD and let windows repartition it.. windows instller can proberly do it also.
2010-11-06T13:10:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	The windows installer has the Format option but it's gray, not clickable
2010-11-06T13:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JohnHeikkila	 delete the partitons via gparted then i guess.
2010-11-06T13:11:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Dr_Willis	Okay.
