2007-12-06T00:36:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	no, you have to do it manually, I did it yesterday
2009-09-16T02:07:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	er, yes, thanks :)
2010-01-12T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	h00k	/var/log/Xorg.0.log may be needed too
2010-01-12T20:42:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	it'd be here, if you're interested: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/355568/
2010-01-12T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	h00k	there is no erros there ... maybe you ca try to run « compiz --replace » from a terminal and see if it is some error reported ?
2010-01-12T20:50:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	Well, it did crash, but the history was left in the terminal, I had to log back out and then back in, I'll see if I can reproduce it
2010-01-12T20:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	h00k	next time do « compiz --replace &> compiz-error-log.txt » to capture the errors
2010-01-12T20:51:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	yeah, when I did this, there were none.
2010-01-12T20:52:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	I am now in a fresh session, I can try to pipe it to a file
2010-01-12T20:52:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	so, window decorations are now broken
2010-01-12T21:01:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	starting from freshly-logged-in-session and running compiz --replace, I get: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/355578/
2010-01-12T21:01:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	and compiz does, in fact, work, change Desktop Effects to the third box.
2010-01-12T21:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	h00k	so the problemis that it does not work at first log ...  use compiz fusion icon
2010-01-12T21:02:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	I can, but that just seems to be a bandaid for something I didn't previously need
2010-01-12T21:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	h00k	yep :/ dunno what else to do sorry
2010-01-12T21:03:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	it's alright, I'll keep asking around
2010-01-12T21:25:00.000Z	h00k	erUSUL	acicula: FYI, I removed ~/.local/share/applications/compiz.desktop, logged out, back in, and everything is back to normal.
2010-01-12T21:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	h00k	congrats and noted
