2011-07-13T09:26:00.000Z	Wulf		Hello
2011-07-13T09:27:00.000Z	Wulf		I'm trying to get ubuntu kickstart (with pxe boot) running. The new machine always connects to gb.archive.ubuntu.com to retrieve the file, although I specified a proxy server and an URL
2011-07-13T09:27:00.000Z	Wulf		what am I doing wrong?
2011-07-13T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wulf	you need to change the server to your server
2011-07-13T09:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wulf	the proxy is simply the server use to get web access
2011-07-13T09:28:00.000Z	Wulf	ActionParsnip	where?
2011-07-13T09:28:00.000Z	Wulf	ActionParsnip	the proxy is not used.

2011-07-13T09:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wulf	it's in /etc/apt
2011-07-13T09:29:00.000Z	Wulf	ActionParsnip	please reread my question
