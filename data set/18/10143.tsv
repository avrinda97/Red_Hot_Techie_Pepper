2007-03-18T08:20:00.000Z	Netham45		Im just wonderin
2007-03-18T08:20:00.000Z	Netham45		g
2007-03-18T08:20:00.000Z	Netham45		BASIC or ASM?
2007-03-18T08:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	Yes.  But that's a better question for #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-03-18T08:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	uh, no?  You could... run irssi in a gnome terminal
2007-03-18T08:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	for regular 'xchat', you'll need to enable universe
2007-03-18T09:47:00.000Z	Netham45	Flannel	not true, Desktop has a GUI
2007-03-18T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	but you can remove it.  There's absolutely no difference in the systems, except the default grouping of packages installed.
2007-03-18T09:49:00.000Z	Netham45	Flannel	yup.
2009-01-11T08:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	parted is the correct way.
2009-01-11T08:03:00.000Z	Netham45	Flannel	I asked if there was an easier way, I'm unfamiliar with parted.
2009-01-11T08:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	Nope, nothing easier in the CLI
2009-01-11T08:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	sudo parted
2009-01-11T08:04:00.000Z	Netham45	Flannel	that's what gave me the error
2009-01-11T08:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Netham45	try cfdisk
2009-01-11T08:07:00.000Z	Netham45	Flannel	that's exactly the type of utility I was looking for.
