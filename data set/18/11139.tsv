2006-10-23T14:44:00.000Z	pike_	silox	you could maybe add a sym link under /dev/dsp pointing to the other sound card but im sure there is a better solution
2006-10-23T14:44:00.000Z	silox	pike_	interesting, but how do i do that :)
2006-10-23T14:44:00.000Z	pike_	silox	you only have the usb sound card?
2006-10-23T14:45:00.000Z	silox	pike_	yes ive disabled the other becaus i cant use headphones in that, the sound worked with that but not on this..
2006-10-23T14:46:00.000Z	pike_	silox	and if you type cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp you get no sound right?
2006-10-23T14:46:00.000Z	pike_	silox	i dont want to tell you do do something that might break sound
2006-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	silox	pike_	it says that the drive is full :/
2006-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	silox	pike_	any new ideas how i can fix this? :)
2006-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	pike_	silox	ok that is an odd message so im not going to lead you any further down that road :)
2006-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	silox	pike_	okay ^^
2006-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	silox	pike_	any other ideas?
2006-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	pike_	silox	if it were regular hardware of this were solaris maybe but im not sure how ubuntu handles that usb device
2006-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	pike_	silox	sry
2006-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	silox	pike_	okay thx anyway (C-Media Headphone Set) its the drivers..
2006-10-23T14:54:00.000Z	pike_	silox	sblive cards are pretty cheap :)
2006-10-23T14:55:00.000Z	silox	pike_	okay but if i can listen on music and all it should work in AA also, right? :/
2006-10-23T14:56:00.000Z	pike_	silox	ive never had a sblive problem in ubuntu that wasnt just a matter of playing witht he volume and other stuff in alsamixer
