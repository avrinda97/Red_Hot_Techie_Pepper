2009-03-04T22:10:00.000Z	LjL	corey	it can be, if programs are holding stuff there.
2009-03-04T22:11:00.000Z	LjL	corey	why would you do that anyway? it's done automatically on reboot
2009-03-04T22:12:00.000Z	LjL	corey	daftykins gave you the correct answer to your question on how to empty /tmp. whether doing that can be a bad thing is an entirely different matter
2009-04-16T20:05:00.000Z	LjL	corey	there are flowcharting programs - but you're looking for one that will basically let you write a program *and execute it* by just making a flowchart?
2009-04-16T20:07:00.000Z	corey	LjL	I know that it sounds stupid but, I am using one on windows right now. You dont write code in it, just logic operations like math, equal to and < > as well as setting variables and making decisions
2009-04-16T20:07:00.000Z	LjL	corey	yes, ok, i wasn't sure i understood. not sure there is such a thing, but let me search... sounds "interesting"
2009-04-16T20:17:00.000Z	corey	LjL	Did you find anything?
2009-04-16T20:21:00.000Z	LjL	corey	no, couldn't find anything much
2009-04-16T20:22:00.000Z	corey	LjL	fantastic. I guess I will just have to waste space by adding a windows virtual machine...
2009-04-16T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	corey	or try WINE?
2009-04-16T20:24:00.000Z	corey	LjL	I tried but, it didnt work.
2009-10-16T04:20:00.000Z	LjL	corey	have you tried asking in #ubuntu-offtopic ? this channel is about *Ubuntu* support
2009-11-21T22:57:00.000Z	LjL	corey	you do realize that KDE represents the bulk of one's operating environment, and it's unrealistic to just "download it and run it"...?
2009-11-21T22:58:00.000Z	LjL	corey	then if you want it, install it from the repositories
