2011-04-14T00:51:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	would there be any change in performance? I'd imagine that the live usb is better suited to running on a usb drive than a normal install

2011-04-14T01:08:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	the liveusb stick or cd contains a compressed filesystem that is mapped onto a root mount point
2011-04-14T01:10:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	yeah, so it has to uncompress. but also doesn't it try to make a FS in the RAM so there aren't too many reads/writes to the usb, which slow it down?
2011-04-14T01:11:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	it overlays a virtual memory based filesystem on top of the existing static filesystem
2011-04-14T01:14:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	would you recommend installing natty to a usb then? or modifying the liveusb?
2011-04-14T01:15:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	prolonged use of a usb stick as an os is something i advise against
2011-04-14T01:16:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	not for production, but for familiarizing myself with natty before its released. Would you still advise against it
2011-04-14T01:17:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	id just make a  usb stick from the overnight build
2011-04-14T01:17:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	a live cd stick i mean
2011-04-14T01:17:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	ok that's what i was doing
2011-04-14T01:18:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	but i wanted to install programs on it, update it, and boot straight to ubuntu desktop. Is that possible
2011-04-14T01:19:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	well it used to be possible to persist changes to a usb live stick
2011-04-14T01:19:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	what do you mean "used to?"
2011-04-14T01:19:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	it used to be possible
2011-04-14T01:19:00.000Z	semitones	acicula	is it not anymore?
2011-04-14T01:21:00.000Z	acicula	semitones	as far as i can tell yes
