2006-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	MaHaGoN		Why does it say that about automatix, geez, someone really really needs to change that, lol
2006-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	MaHaGoN		automatix2 is quite good, I just used it actually on this computer
2006-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	MaHaGoN		everything is fine
2006-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	MaHaGoN		I have yet to see any problems arise from it
2006-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	MaHaGoN		!ubotu I am a freaking loser that doesn't use automatix
2006-11-13T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	MaHaGoN	automatix has the ability to hose a system. It finally hosed one of mine after using it on 8 or 9 installs flawlessly. The point in discouraging here is that since there is a fullproof way to do it yourself. Why even risk it, especially when you have 20+ people in here that could get it working for you for sure.
2006-11-13T10:17:00.000Z	bruenig	MaHaGoN	you can get konqueror if you want it
2006-11-13T10:18:00.000Z	MaHaGoN	bruenig	yeah, I know.. I actually did on my laptop, haven't gotten around to it on this desktop
2006-11-13T10:18:00.000Z	bruenig	MaHaGoN	sudo aptitude install konqueror, it is waiting for you
2006-11-13T10:19:00.000Z	bruenig	MaHaGoN	I generally prefer apt-get because of its Super Cow Powers but on apps like konqueror where you have to install nearly all of the KDE libs to get it working. Auto dependency tracking is nice
2006-11-13T10:20:00.000Z	MaHaGoN	bruenig	hence why I shall stick with nautilus now that I can just.. you know, type instead of aimlessly search for folders
2006-11-13T10:20:00.000Z	bruenig	MaHaGoN	the terminal works well. cd /wherever
2006-11-13T10:21:00.000Z	MaHaGoN	bruenig	oh dont get me started on the terminal.. I just spent 5 hours staring at the terminal trying to set up an AP with dhcp... I dont want to open a terminal for a while, lol
2006-11-13T10:21:00.000Z	MaHaGoN	bruenig	I actually didn't even get anywhere :-/
