2007-09-21T11:22:00.000Z	Some_ux		how do i remove a user from a group ?
2007-09-21T11:22:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	deluser user group
2007-09-21T11:27:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	cat /etc/group
2007-09-22T08:34:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	you could kill their shell's process i suppose
2007-09-22T08:35:00.000Z	Some_ux	LjL	is there no specific command to kicking users from the system ?
2007-09-22T08:36:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	if there is, i don't know about it
2008-11-07T23:43:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	out of curiosity why do you need to *compile* it rather than just install it?
2008-11-07T23:44:00.000Z	Some_ux	LjL	The reason I am saying this is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xl2tpd/+bug/247783
2008-11-07T23:46:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	ok so the bug seems fixed in intrepid, why don't you try recompiling the *intrepid* package
2008-11-07T23:46:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	you could also request a backport
2008-11-07T23:50:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	it's actually pretty straightforward to compile an Intrepid package on Hardy, if dependencies haven't changed [much]. 1) add the relevant *source* repository line to /etc/apt/sources.list 2) do "sudo apt-get update" 3) do "sudo apt-get build-dep packagename" 4) do "sudo apt-get --build source packagename" 5) remove the line from sources.list
2008-11-07T23:54:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	i've never used prevu, but you can also do what i explained for the hardy version (except drop the "--build", because you'll need to edit stuff before building)
2008-11-07T23:58:00.000Z	Some_ux	LjL	I have another problem, the machine I am using is not connected to the web (in part, due to the fact that the xl2tp is faulty) So Can i still do the steps you suggested ?
2008-11-07T23:59:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	no you cannot, not on that machine
2008-11-08T00:00:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	you can move stuff manually to that machine, i guess, but it'll be quite cumbersome to do, because you'll also have to get the various build dependencies installed
2008-11-08T00:04:00.000Z	Some_ux	LjL	Am I correct in assuming all i need to compile that package is libc6 and ppp ?  (http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/net/xl2tpd)
2008-11-08T00:05:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	well, you also need "build-essential" (which every package needs to compile, since it includes, among other things... the compiler). but still, no, those two dependencies listed are just the *runtime* dependencies, not the *build* dependencies
2008-11-08T00:07:00.000Z	LjL	Some_ux	i don't know how to list the build dependencies, i just know that "apt-get build-dep" will install them
