2010-07-31T19:34:00.000Z	Traveler7		Hi! How can I use my pendrive from ubuntu? /var/log/messages shows the new usb device, but after the usb-storage don't show the partitions.
2010-07-31T19:35:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	whats a pendrive?
2010-07-31T19:37:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	have a look on /dev
2010-07-31T19:37:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	Simple usb-stick. Should be recognized as sd device.
2010-07-31T19:38:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	with what program du u try do access?
2010-07-31T19:42:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	oCean: The kernel can not recognize it. /var/log/messages shows ehci messages, "new speed USB device,. ..".
2010-07-31T19:44:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	ignoring that fact, just try to mount per console manualy
2010-07-31T19:45:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	often, it return messages much more useful to u
2010-07-31T19:45:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	oCean: Curious, that now it recognizes the pendrive..., Usually after bootup it doesn't work.
2010-07-31T19:46:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	oCean: When it works, /var/log/messages seems the partitions, and nautilus opens the drive automatically. After bootup (when doesn't work) it knows the usb device, but not the partitions, etc.
2010-07-31T19:47:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	i hate runtime system cahcnges -.-
2010-07-31T19:50:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	oCean_: I hate it too. I don't know, why is this. Maybe uhci driver gets to work later. Is it required?
2010-07-31T19:51:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	oCean_: I try a reboot, maybe I will have more data. It's really weird.. Thanx the help.
2010-07-31T20:15:00.000Z	Traveler7	ixbidie	oCean_: Thanks the help! I do a reboot to test it.
2010-07-31T20:06:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	Maybe nautilus itself ... :P
2010-07-31T20:08:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	oCean_: How can i add a usb storrage by hand in the /etc/modules?
2010-07-31T20:09:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	oCean_: Just -> cat >> /etc/modules?
2010-07-31T20:10:00.000Z	ixbidie	Traveler7	Don't know, just edit it wit htexteditor :P
