2011-08-16T17:47:00.000Z	jerriy1		Hi chatters, can any of you help me on Amarok?
2011-08-16T17:47:00.000Z	jerriy1		Amarok is totally bust
2011-08-16T17:48:00.000Z	jerriy1		It crashes EVERYTIME I want to play something
2011-08-16T17:48:00.000Z	jerriy1		My system is Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid)
2011-08-16T17:49:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	tried other players? some corrupt music files in there perhaps? rebuilt the library?
2011-08-16T17:50:00.000Z	jerriy1		 bazhang: I do have other players but they don't play all the files so I'm trying to see what happens with Amarok
2011-08-16T17:51:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	what are the problematic ones? got the w32codecs installed as well?
2011-08-16T17:51:00.000Z	jerriy1		 bazhang: what's w32codecs?
2011-08-16T17:51:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	from medibuntu.org , you can download the .deb from there
2011-08-16T17:52:00.000Z	jerriy1		 bazhang: yes i have those but I'm not able to play something called windows media files
2011-08-16T17:52:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	wma?
2011-08-16T17:53:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	sounds like a drm issue rather than a amarok issue frankly
2011-08-16T17:54:00.000Z	jerriy1	bazhang	it's QTL
2011-08-16T17:55:00.000Z	jerriy1	bazhang	by that I mean a streaming file (that ends in .qtl)
2011-08-16T17:58:00.000Z	jerriy1		bazhang:?
2011-08-16T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	those are quicktime streaming files, seems totem can play them if ubuntuforums post is still applicable. did not see anything about amarok supporting them as of yet though
2011-08-16T18:01:00.000Z	jerriy1	bazhang	qtl and also ASX
2011-08-16T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	jerriy1	no idea with amarok, totem and mplayer can however
