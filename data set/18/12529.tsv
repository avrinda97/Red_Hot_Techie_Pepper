2006-04-07T08:32:00.000Z	holycow	th0un	i do.  in breezy by default you cant start it up automatically.  you need to download the prism FIRMWARE and put it in the right place,then ifup will work.  google up the prism website firmware and they will have instructions for this on there
2006-04-07T08:34:00.000Z	th0un	holycow	thank god! You are an angel on earth haha, ive been tackling this issue for a few hours now - okay so I have the firmware, do you know where to put it and what to call it? the wiki isnt specifying
2006-04-07T08:35:00.000Z	holycow	th0un	no i forget, its on their website, its a directory nested like 5 dirs deep or something
2006-04-07T08:35:00.000Z	th0un	holycow	alright, remember the website?
2006-04-07T08:35:00.000Z	th0un	holycow	just want to make sure im not going to the wrong one
