2007-09-02T10:45:00.000Z	raynerd		can you install dependencies via a shell?
2007-09-02T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	Yes, just install the package with apt-get, dependencies are installed automatically
2007-09-02T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	What are you trying to install?
2007-09-02T10:48:00.000Z	raynerd	Jordan_U	if you can do it please talk me through !
2007-09-02T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	Edubuntu seriously may not be the right choice
2007-09-02T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	The install is text only and it is made more for thin clients, if you just want Ubuntu + Educational apps it's easier to start from the standard LiveCD
2007-09-02T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	Yes, but it is just an apt-get away
2007-09-02T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	raynerd Depending on what you mean though, it has many networking tools
2007-09-02T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	raynerd	What type of splash are you looking for? You might find something good on art.gnome.org
