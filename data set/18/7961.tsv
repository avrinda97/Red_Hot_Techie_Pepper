2007-10-21T06:55:00.000Z	asbani	Vlet	you checked it?
2007-10-21T06:56:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	lol... what zone are you in? I'm leveling a pally alt in STV ;)
2007-10-21T06:57:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	anyway, that's weird - I don't recall having to do that on my system at work with vbox on it... have you tried doing what it said?
2007-10-21T06:57:00.000Z	asbani	Vlet	nop
2007-10-21T06:58:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	well, give it a shot. If I remember correctly, I had to restart my system after installing vboxx
2007-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	asbani	Vlet	I done it. now it wants me to put a group add or something
2007-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	hang on - I have to install virtualbox too, so let me try this too
2007-10-21T07:06:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	okay, yeah, that's easy... do you know how to add yourself to a group?
2007-10-21T07:07:00.000Z	asbani	Vlet	I done that. i added myself to vboxuser group from system > admin > Group managing
2007-10-21T07:07:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	and it works now?
2007-10-21T07:07:00.000Z	Vlet	asbani	good :)
