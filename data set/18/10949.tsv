2006-10-02T10:47:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	you do have 'twm' installed?
2006-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	eracc	Not sure, should I try to get it through apt?
2006-10-02T10:49:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	yes.
2006-10-02T10:49:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	eracc	Installing now.
2006-10-02T10:50:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	it appears that your vncserver default window manager is twm. You can change that by editing /home/funnyman3595/.vnc/xstartup.
2006-10-02T10:53:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	so, did it start?
2006-10-02T11:05:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	hmmm, do you have X11 fonts installed?
2006-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	eracc	Looks like not.
2006-10-02T11:09:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	eracc	What's the package name?
2006-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	then you need to "sudo apt-get" some fonts for X11. That is required for using X even over vnc. There are many font files.
2006-10-02T11:12:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	hmmm, try installing xfonts-100dpi and xfonts-75dpi.
2006-10-02T11:14:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	eracc	Yeah, that particular dir isn't where the fonts are, for some reason.
2006-10-02T11:15:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	eracc	They're hiding over in /usr/share/X11
2006-10-02T11:15:00.000Z	eracc	FunnyMan3595	yes. I saw them here on /usr/share. Just wondered if perhaps a symlink had gone missing or something.
