2011-06-01T21:55:00.000Z	erle-		can root change the password of a user with an encrypted directory?
2011-06-01T21:55:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	yes the password for an account is seperate from the home dir, they are not related at all
2011-06-01T21:56:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	and how is the home dir decrypted then?
2011-06-01T21:57:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	isnt it decrypted at login with help of the login password?
2011-06-01T21:57:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	on login the password is checked, then used to decrpyt the home dir, then mounted where it's supposed to be
2011-06-01T21:57:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	but the password for login is not kept in the encrypted volume
2011-06-01T21:58:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	but there must be a secret to protect the encrypted dir
2011-06-01T21:58:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	of course not, i didnt say anything like that
2011-06-01T21:59:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	if the users login password is not needed vor decryption, than root can decrypt any encrypted home dir
2011-06-01T22:00:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	yes, root is the superuser, it has all access, to everything.  How else would you fix things when they get borked
2011-06-01T22:01:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	you should not be able to access an encrypted file without the secret
2011-06-01T22:01:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	they should not call in encryption then
2011-06-01T22:01:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	afaik the password is the secret, and root has access to that
2011-06-01T22:03:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	yeah sipior is right, root can change the password, but you'd need to input the old one so it can decrpyt the volume and reencrypt the volume with the new password
2011-06-01T22:03:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	i wasn't clear enough in my description of the login/decrpytion process
2011-06-01T22:04:00.000Z	erle-	Dulak	how is it implemented? is the user asked at login for both passwords?
2011-06-01T22:05:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	the password is asked for once, it's hashed and matched to the password hash that root has access to, if it matches, the password is passed to the decrypt to be used as the secret.  root only has access to the hash, not the original password
2011-06-01T22:06:00.000Z	Dulak	erle-	so root can change the login password, but without the original password, root cannot decrpyt the volume, since the hash of the password is not the password itself
