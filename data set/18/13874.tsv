2006-06-05T08:05:00.000Z	danfg		Why is ubuntu missing /dev/hda1, hda2, etc. files? damn, it only makes mounting harder. how do i create a /dev/hd#? i've tried using mknod, but the device i create can't be mounted: "/dev/hda1 is not a valid block device"
2006-06-05T08:06:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	if everything is working correctly then it will only create the nodes in /dev/ for things that actually exist
2006-06-05T08:06:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	what is the disk you're trying to mount?
2006-06-05T08:06:00.000Z	danfg	Ng	it's an ntfs disk, does ubuntu autodetect and mount these?
2006-06-05T08:07:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	I don't think so. I meant more is it IDE, SATA or SCSI/USB?
2006-06-05T08:09:00.000Z	danfg	Ng	one is IDE, another is SATA (i guess its SCSI because its /dev/sda), both are NTFS. i'm trying to mount them, but the /dev/hda and /dev/sda are "busy", even though i cant umount them
2006-06-05T08:09:00.000Z	danfg	Ng	if i try mounting /dev/hda1, the device doesnt exist (no /dev/hda1 file)
2006-06-05T08:10:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	you might want to run "sudo fdisk -l" - that will show you all the partitions on all disks the system is aware of
2006-06-05T08:12:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	hmm, that's quite strange
2006-06-27T08:36:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	ubuntu doesn't use RPMs, it uses DEBs
2006-06-27T08:37:00.000Z	danfg	Ng	yeah, Sci-freak is telling me to do some wierd voodoo hacking and create deb from an rpm
2006-06-27T08:37:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	that's a terrible idea
2006-06-27T08:38:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	http://people.ubuntu.com/~seb128/deb/
2006-06-27T08:38:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	you should just need the gaim and gaim-data ones for i386
2006-06-27T08:38:00.000Z	danfg	Ng	i need gaim 2.0
2006-06-27T08:38:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	read the version number more closely
2006-06-27T08:39:00.000Z	danfg	Ng	i will, thanks, gtg!
2006-06-27T08:39:00.000Z	Ng	danfg	it's 2.0beta3, which is the most recent release. 2.0 is not out yet
