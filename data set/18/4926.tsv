2009-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	V0iD_	eseven73	Finally someone who makes sense, any suggestions for using wine.
2009-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	eseven73	V0iD_	I feel your pain, even more so because I don't even know simple HTML that well :)  so I just use Kompozer
2009-05-27T07:21:00.000Z	V0iD_	eseven73	Thanks Dude i'm determined to get it on linux, wine seems my best option. VM would be to easy.
2009-05-27T07:22:00.000Z	eseven73	V0iD_	hehe yeah there'd be no challenge with vbox you're right :D
2009-05-27T07:22:00.000Z	eseven73	V0iD_	I got CS2 working in wine, if you're a photoshop junky :D
2009-05-27T07:23:00.000Z	V0iD_	eseven73	I love PhotoShop !  : )
2009-05-27T07:23:00.000Z	eseven73	V0iD_	yea cs3/4 no worky, but CS2 no prob :D
2009-05-27T07:24:00.000Z	eseven73	V0iD_	and theres inkscape that does a fairly good job of replacing Illustrator.
2009-05-27T07:24:00.000Z	V0iD_	eseven73	Why no CS3 / CS4? Inkscape sounds good
