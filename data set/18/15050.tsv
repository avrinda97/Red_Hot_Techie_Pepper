2005-05-12T14:49:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	it depends on what kind of package you are going to install
2005-05-12T14:47:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	what do you wanna do? play videos?
2005-05-12T14:50:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	what exactly are you trying to install?
2005-05-12T14:50:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	90%+ of all software you will ever use you can find in synaptic with apt
2005-05-12T14:52:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	window?
2005-05-12T14:53:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	no.. if you have download you need to know what kind of package is it
2005-05-12T14:56:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	if it is a tar.gz just type tar xzvf package.tar.gz
2005-05-12T14:56:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	the "cd package" or whatever folder it creates...
2005-05-12T14:57:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	then just read the README or INSTALL file
2005-05-12T15:03:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	installing things in linux isnt that dificult
2005-05-12T15:04:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	the commom packages are:
2005-05-12T15:04:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	.deb -> "dpkg -i package.deb"
2005-05-12T15:05:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	.rpm -> "alien package.rpm" it will creat a .deb with the same name then just install it
2005-05-12T15:05:00.000Z	fsapo	alotti	.tar.gz -> extract with "tar xzvf package.tar.gz" and read the README or INSTALL file
