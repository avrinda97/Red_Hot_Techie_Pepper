2011-12-25T03:07:00.000Z	Raliegh		Oh that's what I've already got, lol. At least I'm pretty sure, since I use Putty to throw commands and whatnot.
2011-12-25T03:08:00.000Z	Raliegh		Works fine so far... I just can't figure out proper code to setup VLC for live transcoding, so I tried to get a GUI up to do it that way... But that didn't work, haha. I just ultimately need to figure out a proper way to do live Icecast transcoding. x.x
2011-12-25T03:09:00.000Z	Raliegh		It looked pretty during the time I could see it though. :D
2011-12-25T03:11:00.000Z	Raliegh		I don't have lubuntu (I assume that's short for light ubuntu) but I wish I did, lol.
2011-12-25T03:11:00.000Z	Raliegh		BRB, smoke break before I go through the process of figuring out how to properly transcode live streams. x.x
2011-12-25T03:11:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	It's ubuntu with the LXDE desktop env  (this is lighter)
2011-12-25T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	what issue are you having?
2011-12-25T03:19:00.000Z	Raliegh	edbian	nothing regarding Ubuntu anymore really. I'm tying to get VLC to do live transcoding of an Icecast stream in OGG to MP3 and push it to another Icecast mount... But I can't figure out the code for command-line. I tried installing a GUI to use VLC's GUI but that ate too much RAM and made my system unuseable, so I'm back at step one, lol.
2011-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	do you have 32 or 64 bit Ubuntu?
2011-12-27T11:01:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	then get i386
2011-12-27T11:01:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	amd64 if for 64 bit soft/hard ware
2011-12-27T11:04:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	can you re-link your pastebin ?
2011-12-27T11:05:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	with the packages we can't install?
2011-12-27T11:05:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	hopefully won't be necessary
2011-12-27T11:08:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	where did you get liquidsoap from?  the version in the repos does not depend on libao2
2011-12-27T11:08:00.000Z	edbian	Raliegh	http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/liquidsoap
