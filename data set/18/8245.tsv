2008-07-13T09:06:00.000Z	pavel989	nhaines	whats a realtime kernel? (i was pvl1)
2008-07-13T09:06:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	It means the kernel can guarantee certain programs that it will give them a certain amount of time slices.
2008-07-13T09:07:00.000Z	pavel989	nhaines	oh i never knew that
2008-07-13T09:07:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	very good for sound processing.  :)
2008-07-13T09:07:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	It's not common in desktop OSes and so Ubuntu isn't set up that way by default.  But if you need it, there's a specially compiled kernel for you waiting in the repositories!  :D

2008-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	yes, but you can't program a device driver in Python!
2008-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	pavel989	nhaines	im sure out there, there is  a way
2008-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	I doubt there is.  It's not why Python is "for".  I love Python.  :)
2008-07-13T09:14:00.000Z	pavel989	nhaines	very glad i learned it
2008-07-13T09:14:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	Python was like a life-changing experience for me. :)

2008-07-13T09:16:00.000Z	pavel989	nhaines	just kinda read through
2008-07-13T09:17:00.000Z	nhaines	pavel989	I haven't played with Ruby but I understand that it's very nice as well.  :)
2008-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	pavel989	nhaines	is there a good c++ ide not surrounded around .net?
