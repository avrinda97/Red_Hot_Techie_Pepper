2005-12-22T07:10:00.000Z	grabakov		Hi, I found this channel through the ubuntu support page.
2005-12-22T07:10:00.000Z	grabakov		I have just installed ubuntu and I am have some problems.
2005-12-22T07:11:00.000Z	grabakov		When the install has finished, I get an xwindows error.
2005-12-22T07:11:00.000Z	grabakov		It states that it cannot load gdm.
2005-12-22T07:11:00.000Z	grabakov		I have no idea where to go from here :(
2005-12-22T07:13:00.000Z	grabakov		It is strange, I have installed ubuntu three times now and I get the same error.
2005-12-22T07:13:00.000Z	grabakov		Does anybody have an idea?
2005-12-22T07:13:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	grabakov	 what kind of graphics hardware are you using?
2005-12-22T07:14:00.000Z	grabakov	shadeofgrey	It's bog-standard radeon crap for laptops.
2005-12-22T07:14:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	grabakov	 if its ati anything, go buy an nvidia card.  ati linux support blows rancid ardvark balls
2005-12-22T07:15:00.000Z	grabakov	shadeofgrey	So I won't be able to run Ubuntu on Radeon?
2005-12-22T07:15:00.000Z	grabakov	shadeofgrey	not even with drivers?
2005-12-22T07:15:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	grabakov	 in my persdonal opinion, you should ditch the ati shit if you can
2005-12-22T07:16:00.000Z	grabakov	shadeofgrey	it's a laptop ;)
2005-12-22T07:18:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	grabakov	 no you have it backwards.  ati hasnt weritten GOOD linux drivers ever
2005-12-22T07:18:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	grabakov	thats why they suck rancid ardvark balls from here to wherevver and back again
2005-12-22T07:19:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	grabakov	 usa.
2005-12-22T07:19:00.000Z	grabakov	shadeofgrey	then I need a new computer...
