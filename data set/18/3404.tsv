2010-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		is there a way to create a "pointer" from one folder to another?
2010-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		like a virtual folder?
2010-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	A link?
2010-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	ln -s '/path/to/target/folder' linkname
2010-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	would that be still in place after a reboot?
2010-03-13T13:08:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	Yep
2010-03-13T13:08:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	so would the "linkname" be the source folder?
2010-03-13T13:09:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	Uh, no. I meant to say this: ln -s 'path/to/source' linkname. Linkname is generally the name of the, how you called it, virtual folder
2010-03-13T13:09:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	so could i just simply put the path to the "virtual folder"
2010-03-13T13:10:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	Ugh. Give me the path to the real folder, and path where you want the virtual one, and i'll give ya the command
2010-03-13T13:10:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	ln -s '/media/exthdd/movies' '/var/www/movies'
2010-03-13T13:11:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	Looks right
2010-03-13T13:11:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	cool thanks, i tried using fstab but that didnt work... i had the source folder path in place of the device path
2010-05-13T18:04:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	i am having major problems with apt-get, whenever i upgrade this package fails: libatk-1.0-dev_1.30.0-0ubuntu2_i386.deb
2010-05-13T18:04:00.000Z	theadmin	ae86-drifter	I didn't break it, why me? o_O
2010-05-13T18:04:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	theadmin	because you seem helpful.. :)
