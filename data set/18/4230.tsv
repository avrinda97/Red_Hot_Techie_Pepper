2009-05-15T03:54:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		but one thing drives me nuts - broken hibernate and suspend mode. It just doesnt work on my laptop. I wanted to ask if it was fixed in version 9.04?
2009-05-15T03:56:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		k thanks for tips..... bummer, it probably doesnt work because i have a weird laptop assembled in russia
2009-05-15T03:58:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		But is it worth to upgrade to 9.04 now? or is it better to wait a bit?
2009-05-15T03:59:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		yep
2009-05-15T04:01:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		Good things come at a price, I guess. Still, no way i am going back to XP. Thanks for pointers, guys
2009-05-15T04:02:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		i didnt mean price like money, heh.
2009-05-15T04:02:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		I meant like you have to work for it
2009-05-15T04:02:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		never paid for windows anyway))
2009-05-15T04:03:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		Oh, sorry. I live in russia
2009-05-15T04:03:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		No one fights software piracy here
2009-05-15T04:03:00.000Z	leagris	RUbuntuNooB	to ease suspend working, you may choose to significantly enlarge the swap partition
2009-05-15T04:04:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		Alright
2009-05-15T04:04:00.000Z	leagris	RUbuntuNooB	like 4x the RAM at least
2009-05-15T04:04:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB	leagris	 wow, i thought 1.5 ram would be enough
2009-05-15T04:05:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB		i will give it a try
2009-05-15T04:05:00.000Z	leagris	RUbuntuNooB	suspend to disk swap all RAM to the swap partition + some state metadata
2009-05-15T04:06:00.000Z	leagris	RUbuntuNooB	to that you have to add already used swap during runtime
2009-05-15T04:06:00.000Z	RUbuntuNooB	leagris	ok, i ll try that
