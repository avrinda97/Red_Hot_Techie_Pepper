2007-07-23T12:29:00.000Z	WGGM1		Im having an issue with ALSA inside of WINE. When running 'winecfg' and selecting the 'Audio' tab, I recieve a dialog box stating: "Found drive in registry that is not available! Remove "alsa" from registry?" Any thoughts??
2007-07-23T12:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	ask in #winehq
2007-07-23T12:31:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	i have.. they referred me to the ubuntu channel cause they think im missing 32bit alsa libs
2007-07-23T12:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	sudo chown -r  or sudo chmod -R
2007-07-23T12:34:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	wrong person
2007-07-23T12:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	can you play music ?
2007-07-23T12:34:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	yes, and skype. my sound is good, just not in WINE
2007-07-23T12:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	well it might be a packaging problem if it works on other distros but not ubuntu
2007-07-23T12:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	this is feisty?
2007-07-23T12:36:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	aye, amd64 7.04
2007-07-23T12:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	you're running 64 bit ??
2007-07-23T12:36:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	yes
2007-07-23T12:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	didn't think wine ran at 64 bit at all - you're using a 32bit chroot?
2007-07-23T12:37:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	negative. installed ia32-libs and runs. Diablo 2 + LOD (expansion) are installed, runs fine, just no sound
2007-07-23T12:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	but also would be 64 bit libs??
2007-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	but alsa would be 64 bit libs??
2007-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	WGGM1	Frogzoo	lib32asound2
2007-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	WGGM1	ok, dunno
