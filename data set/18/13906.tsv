2006-05-16T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	you will probably find some diagnostic information in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-05-16T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	reboot to recovery mode or install a Windows ext2 driver to read the log.
2006-05-16T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	no trailing /
2006-05-16T05:28:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	either that or a filesystem driver for Windows.
2006-05-16T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	in recovery mode, you could try tweaking X settings with 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2006-05-16T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	for an ext2 driver for Windows, you'd have to search the web or ask the channel again.
2006-05-16T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	what kind of graphics card?
2006-05-16T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	you could try installing ati drivers by following the wiki
2006-05-16T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuUserX	no, look at ubotu's line
