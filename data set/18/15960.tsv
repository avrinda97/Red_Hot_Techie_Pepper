2004-12-15T11:42:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	upgrade to a kernel for your cpu, ie i686 or k7, default 386 kernel cannot see all the ram
2004-12-15T11:43:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	theres a thing called google
2004-12-15T11:43:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	well start getting used to reading information
2004-12-15T12:34:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	sees all the ram now yeah?
2004-12-15T12:37:00.000Z	winnipegm	linux_mafia	whats a good dvdr player and also a dvdr burning program
2004-12-15T12:37:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	totem-xine to play, and i use k3b for burning
2004-12-15T12:44:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	totem-gstreamer is installed by default, it wont play restricted formats, hence you need totem-xine, plus a couple of libs from christian marillats repo
2004-12-15T12:46:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	it will be working fine, but 3d acceleration will not be enabled, since ati drivers are proprietary, and the ones they do provide for *nix are for a small range of cards, and apparently not that good
2004-12-15T12:47:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	they wont work at all without 3d drivers
2004-12-15T12:49:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	if you wanna play games, you are better off to play in win, especially with an ati card, do the owners, and former owners of ati's agree?
2004-12-15T13:03:00.000Z	winnipegm	linux_mafia	where do i get that totem-xine i searched on google not much help
2004-12-15T13:11:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	totem-xine? just apt-get it
2004-12-15T13:15:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	get rid of the shit before mount
2004-12-15T13:19:00.000Z	linux_mafia	winnipegm	and no errors or nothing when you do that
