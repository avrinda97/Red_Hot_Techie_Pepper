2009-08-26T18:54:00.000Z	cheezespread		Hi all . a small question regarding the updates in Ubuntu . I am getting updates for packages which are part of KDE . Is there anyway i can disable this and recieve only relevant ones ?..
2009-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	Halitech	cheezespread	do you have any kde apps installed?
2009-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, i haven;t installed anything apart from the default ones.
2009-08-26T18:56:00.000Z	Halitech	cheezespread	no k3b or any other apps?
2009-08-26T18:57:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, let me check once . WIll update now. Thanks
2009-08-26T18:59:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, I just checked . No, i dont have k3b installed . Are there any KDE apps installed by default ?. Just wondering
2009-08-26T18:59:00.000Z	Halitech	cheezespread	shouldn't be by default
2009-08-26T19:00:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, ok . I was wondering why i am getting the KDElib updates . Any way to turn these specific ones off ?. ( I dont mind installing them though .. still )
2009-08-26T19:01:00.000Z	Halitech	cheezespread	if you are getting updates for kde libs then there must be something you have installed from the kde side
2009-08-26T19:01:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, Ok .. will check . Thank you .
2009-08-26T19:02:00.000Z	Halitech	cheezespread	not that its a problem to run kde apps in gnome or xfce, I use xfce and I use gnome and kde apps
2009-08-26T19:03:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, ok. Not that I have a problem with that ;) ..
2009-08-26T19:20:00.000Z	cheezespread	Halitech	, I have klibc-utils installed in Synaptic. Any way i can check which application needs the package for ?
2009-08-26T19:21:00.000Z	Halitech	cheezespread	according to http://packages.debian.org/sid/klibc-utils it's used with initramfs
