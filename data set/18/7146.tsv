2008-02-29T19:45:00.000Z	Corty		http://paste.debian.net/50172 <- any ideas?
2008-02-29T19:47:00.000Z	waylandbill	Corty	those modules compiled against the current running kernel?
2008-02-29T19:47:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	ehm, yes?
2008-02-29T19:48:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	8999329      0 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root src         22 2008-02-28 21:56 linux -> linux-headers-2.6.24.3
2008-02-29T19:50:00.000Z	waylandbill	Corty	2.6.24? you using hardy or backports?
2008-02-29T19:51:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	compiled myself
2008-02-29T19:51:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	but as i read that... would be a better idea to use a hardy package?
2008-02-29T19:53:00.000Z	waylandbill	Corty	should be okay as long as the kernel and modules were built from the same code and headers.
2008-02-29T19:53:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	ok. :)
2008-02-29T19:54:00.000Z	waylandbill	Corty	you may try building both again.
2008-02-29T19:54:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	got the vanilla sources, and built my own .deb packages for headers and image
2008-02-29T19:54:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	ok, just startet with that
2008-02-29T19:55:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	what else, if that will not solve it?
2008-02-29T19:55:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	i did that yesterday and forgot to deactivate a few conflicting modules, so i could not insert the module. but today it's throwing other errors, as you can see at the pastebin
2008-02-29T19:56:00.000Z	waylandbill	Corty	I saw the errors. The missing symbols suggest code not in the kernel that the headers say there are.
2008-02-29T19:57:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	ok
2008-02-29T19:57:00.000Z	waylandbill	Corty	you may want to see if someone in #linux would know more about it.
2008-02-29T19:57:00.000Z	Corty	waylandbill	ok, thanks :)
