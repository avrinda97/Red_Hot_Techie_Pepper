2009-09-08T15:26:00.000Z	simplexio	eni23	i would use -m 1
2009-09-08T15:27:00.000Z	simplexio	eni23	but in other hand if md0 hasnt nay other data than mysql stuff then -m 0 would be my choice
2009-09-08T15:29:00.000Z	simplexio	eni23	and man says also that that reserved are is used also to decrease fragmentation
