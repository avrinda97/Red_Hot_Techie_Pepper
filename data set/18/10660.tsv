2010-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	Taev		for Lucid
2010-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	Taev		well i guess ill just use bluefish
2010-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	Taev		to be honest I am really not feeling that great about Lucid, nor am I happy about being forced to upgrade my server from 8.04 or stop receiving updates.
2010-06-12T12:24:00.000Z	Taev		yeah well that still doesn't solve my dilema. the "upgrade operating system" feature stinks
2010-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	Taev		I've hosed about 5 installs trying it
2010-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	Taev		as a test before I did it with my server
2010-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	Taev		i really don't want to reconfigure apache, MySQL databases, and everything else on my server
2010-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	Taev		I use plain old 8.04 as my web server and other stuff
2010-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	Taev		just because Im serving stuff doesn't mean I don't want a GUI to do other stuff
2010-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	Taev		I'm chatting on my server right now.
2010-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	8.04 server will be supported untill 2013.
2010-06-12T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	You can also catch some upgrade problems before hand with "do-release-upgrade --sandbox"
2010-07-17T14:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	What exactly isn't working about grub?
2010-07-17T14:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	Sorry, I thought you were DiRaOL since your answer matched my question to him :)
2010-07-17T14:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	You chose to use the desktop installer.
2010-07-17T14:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	It's the exact same installer.

2010-07-17T15:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taev	No flags needed, rc.local is the last script run at boot, and is a normal shell script.
