2010-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	Henry_BR		:-( My Ubuntu Lucid looks like an Alpha System.
2010-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	then get theming :)
2010-05-06T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	it is a good OS if you deem it so, some people hate it
2010-05-06T06:56:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	here people, free software community, says that gnu/linux should be used... in schools, home, etc... But, I feels like it cause more hating than loving... I feels like first the community should implement a better OS before want people, simple users, using it. I don't know...
2010-05-06T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	thats the goal of ubuntu
2010-05-06T06:58:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	but Ubuntu has many bugs... I'm considering try another system. I don't know. With 9.10 i didn't have problems, but now... 10.04 is fucking stressing me
2010-05-06T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	windows also has many bugs
2010-05-06T07:01:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	for me it is only more slowly, and things works, splash works, msn works, webcam works, etc... (little things like webcam and msn are keys to conquer people). or... internet banking, for exemple... i have to boot in windows to login in my account. I'd like to remove windows, but... I can't. :\
2010-05-06T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	webcams are hugely supported, if you run lsusb you will see identifiers which you can use to find guides
2010-05-06T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	for msn there is amsn and emesene and even pidgin
2010-05-06T07:04:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	I tried many times, spend many hours to make my webcam works. In skype, now, it works. But... try http://twitcam.com/. or another websites with language learning or something like, that use flash, etc, with webcam...
2010-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	the flash plugin can use webcam afaik
2010-05-06T07:09:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	how? in skype I have to write "x=yyy/zzz    skype" in terminal for it works with webcam... but with flash i don't know. And x=yyy/zzz... is not human being =\
2010-05-06T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	just remember what ubuntu is and the masses of money which other OS developers have
2010-05-06T07:10:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	and about webcam in flash...
2010-05-06T07:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	not sure, i dont use webcams. I think they are creepy
2010-05-06T07:12:00.000Z	Henry_BR	ActionParsnip	:O but video is a good thing in learning languages or when your mother lives 30hour from you :S
2010-05-06T07:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Henry_BR	i guess
