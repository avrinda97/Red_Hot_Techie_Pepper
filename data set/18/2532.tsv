2010-04-30T06:49:00.000Z	dominicdinada		p7zip is the gui?
2010-04-30T06:50:00.000Z	dominicdinada		Today someone just gave me a barricuda 500gig to add to the fileserver when i get time to put it together
2010-04-30T06:51:00.000Z	dominicdinada		LOL i keep getting the errors ( UNRAR not found in the path ) after i threw in 7zip let me download unrar
2010-04-30T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 i always use the 'unp' script. theres also the specific rar and unrar binaries you may want to use instead of 7zip
2010-05-20T06:42:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	I am not happy with VLC*
2010-05-20T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 ive rarely had issues with vlc. I use it 99% of the time these days
2010-05-20T06:44:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	linuxmonster I dont prefer VLC but totem even following restricted formats howto still does not play anything EVERY time i load a video in it it always wants a plugin
2010-05-20T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 totam has always had that 'trying to be smart but failing'  with codecs and stuff..  Ive not had it nag me lately.. but i rarely use it.
2010-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	I beg to differ in Karmic i had to add the codecs and then it played everything with out a problem for me
2010-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 even then i would have it ask a few times.. of course I normally  had allready installed the other players. so i dont pay much attention to totem any more
2010-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	See i have so much  video audio etc i got from school/alum or what not that i got over a TB of various videos and well never had an issue before :(
2010-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 one reason i stick with vlc - i never have issues.. i got tons of videos also. some are a bit obscure. I have had totem not like a lot of them. (not tried them all in 10.04's totem however) Then again Theres other features I like in vlc that are not in totem.
2010-05-20T06:49:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	sigh i know... and Lucid for me has not correctly ever saved associations of files...
2011-01-30T22:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 webmin was getting phased out of ubuntu and debian befor upstart was even implimented I belive.
2011-01-30T22:02:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	funny alot of webmin still works just a few areas dont now ebox wants to take control of the system 100% and works like Sh*t and ZERO support
2011-01-30T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 personally.. i dont use eitehr one.
2011-01-30T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dominicdinada	 webmin has also been noted for security issues in the past.  so use what you want.
2011-01-30T22:03:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Dr_Willis	Security problems or not if i am blocking all inbound packets from outside the lan then whats the problem
