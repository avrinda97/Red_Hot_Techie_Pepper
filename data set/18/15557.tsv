2005-02-28T17:12:00.000Z	randabis		livecd != install cd by any means
2005-02-28T17:13:00.000Z	randabis		you should also try the amd64 hoary install cds...I hear they work better than the old warty one
2005-02-28T17:13:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	Well... isnt it logical to assume that if the LiveCD boots fine with no errors that the regular install will be based on at least the same BASIC components?
2005-02-28T17:15:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	the livecd you used could have been for i386
2005-02-28T17:15:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	okay. i can accept that
2005-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	again, I recommend the newer hoary cds and not the warty ones for amd64
2005-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	where do i get the hoary CD's?
2005-02-28T17:18:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	which array should i get?
2005-02-28T17:19:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	the latest 4...or you could see if anything newer is in current...array 4 should be good though
2005-02-28T17:22:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	have any idea why it wouldnt in my case?
2005-02-28T17:36:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	it only does that if an internet connection is detected
2005-02-28T17:36:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	doubtful...warty only have i386 livecds
2005-02-28T17:40:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	I mean ours is better by leaps and bounds
2005-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	ah.. the OTHER type of own
2005-02-28T17:56:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	SuperKaramba and gDesklets are what make those mac-like docks
2005-02-28T17:58:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	either/or
2005-02-28T06:00:00.000Z	randabis	ShadeofGrey	just keep in mind that using an AMD64 build limits you in software that you can use
2005-02-28T06:51:00.000Z	ShadeofGrey	randabis	im just REALLY worried about the bootloader probs i had using the warty 64bit
