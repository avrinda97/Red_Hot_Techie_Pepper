2012-09-16T16:18:00.000Z	randomstuff		I've really tried anything I could think of (Including resetting the network accesibility altogether).
2012-09-16T16:19:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	basically,whats your need?
2012-09-16T16:20:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	My Ubuntu 12.04 is unable to both load anything related to the internet, and also unable to show any errors to do with it.
2012-09-16T16:21:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	are you using dhcp server ?
2012-09-16T16:22:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	Am I using what-now?
2012-09-16T16:30:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	set to nat on networking type
2012-09-16T16:31:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	I'll see of Nat works.
2012-09-16T16:31:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	Nope... Nat made it lose what little connection it had.
2012-09-16T16:39:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	It didn't work... Now what?
2012-09-16T16:43:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	if your host can connect to internet, and your guest has been setup to nat networking,you should can connect to net
2012-09-16T17:00:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	Got an error: "Write failed: Broken pipe"
2012-09-16T17:02:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	like a bad things
2012-09-16T17:02:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	So I am not able to fix it?
2012-09-16T17:04:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	try to look at virtualbox documentations, or their forums, how to fix it.. I think that was related corrupted local pipe..maybe reboot can fix them
2012-09-16T17:05:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	Shall I also do that, when it's the terminal that gives the error?
2012-09-16T17:06:00.000Z	blackshirt	randomstuff	try to shutdown your vm and start again
2012-09-16T17:06:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	I'll try.
2012-09-16T17:09:00.000Z	randomstuff	blackshirt	Same story... Just says "Connecting".
