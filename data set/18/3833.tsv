2011-05-19T21:40:00.000Z	alesan		how can uninstall the ubuntu-font?
2011-05-19T21:40:00.000Z	alesan		I did not have it before the upgrade and now it's creeping in
2011-05-19T21:40:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	I don't know why you'd want to uninstall it when you can just change your font
2011-05-19T21:41:00.000Z	alesan	xrdodrx	I do not understand, you are saying yuo do not know how to uninstall it?
2011-05-19T21:41:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	I do know how, remove the ttf-ubuntu-font-family package.
2011-05-19T21:42:00.000Z	alesan	xrdodrx	thanks!
2011-05-19T21:42:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	which are?
2011-05-19T21:43:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	"accidental comeback"?
2011-05-19T21:43:00.000Z	alesan	xrdodrx	Kubuntu-desktop, Kubuntu-default-settings
2011-05-19T21:43:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	those are called
2011-05-19T21:44:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	"meta packages", they aren't actually anything
2011-05-19T21:44:00.000Z	alesan	xrdodrx	so why I did not have this font before, and after the upgrade many programs use it?
2011-05-19T21:44:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	because Canonical designed the Ubuntu font family and incorporated it into the system.
2011-05-19T21:44:00.000Z	alesan	xrdodrx	that is not new in 11.04
2011-05-19T21:45:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	It's safe to remove kubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-default-settings packages, that would happen any time you remove a default component of the system.
2011-05-19T21:45:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	that's probably not smart
2011-05-19T21:46:00.000Z	xrdodrx	alesan	I don't use KDE, but go into appearance settings.
