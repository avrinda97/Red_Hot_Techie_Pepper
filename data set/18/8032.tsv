2008-03-06T10:20:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	np
2008-03-06T10:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	It is a .wav. Yes you can change it
2008-03-06T10:22:00.000Z	cjae	Odd-rationale	is there a limit to size?
2008-03-06T10:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	I don't think so...
2008-03-06T10:23:00.000Z	cjae	Odd-rationale	ok now im pushing question limit, app to rip it off movie since I have whole movie theme going?
2008-03-06T10:24:00.000Z	cjae	Odd-rationale	did I make much sense last question?
2008-03-06T10:25:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	I think I know of an app. I've never tried to rip music of video, so I don't how that would work... Let me get link...
2008-03-06T10:28:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	Try this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=652843
2008-03-06T10:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	It is not in the repos...
2008-03-06T10:34:00.000Z	cjae	Odd-rationale	ok so I would load dvd in there and sift to which part of movie would like out and extract?"
2008-03-06T10:35:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	Like I said, I never used it for that purpose before. But it claims to be able to do so...
2008-03-06T10:51:00.000Z	cjae	Odd-rationale	ok where are the login wavs kept?
2008-03-06T10:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	/usr/share/sounds
2008-03-06T10:53:00.000Z	cjae	Odd-rationale	so just rename new file to login.wav and delete old one?
2008-03-06T10:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cjae	No. Go to System --> Pref --> Sounds and change the login sound
