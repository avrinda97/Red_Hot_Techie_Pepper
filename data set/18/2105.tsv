2012-02-17T13:20:00.000Z	beasty		s/nio/ion/
2012-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	beasty		i have a 128gb ssd on sda1
2012-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	beasty		but also a 128gb on sdb
2012-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	beasty		can i mirror sda to sdb ?
2012-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	NixGeek	beasty	are you talking about a mirror type raid?
2012-02-17T13:27:00.000Z	NixGeek	beasty	if you do raid1 and sda goes down, you might have problems booting from sdb if you just replaced sda with it (since it will now see nothing for sdb)... you might be able to use a usb stick or cd to boot from, using mdstat to remove to unused drive
2012-02-17T13:27:00.000Z	beasty	NixGeek	ok
2012-02-17T13:28:00.000Z	beasty	NixGeek	i'll look if i can setup raid on my motherboard
2012-02-17T13:29:00.000Z	NixGeek	beasty	hardware raid from the mobo is the way to go because then you could remove the bad drive (ie sda) from the equation before boot time.  That being said, I like niklasfi's suggestion of proper backup.  Just replace drive with known good one and restore data
2012-02-17T13:31:00.000Z	beasty	NixGeek	€€€ is no issue
2012-02-17T13:33:00.000Z	NixGeek	beasty	good luck
2012-02-18T00:11:00.000Z	beasty	NixGeek	still alive ?
