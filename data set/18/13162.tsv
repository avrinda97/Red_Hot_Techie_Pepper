2006-02-19T17:26:00.000Z	anap		highvoltage, i'm trying to follow the instructions from this page, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=557274
2006-02-19T17:26:00.000Z	anap		download a macro and put it in a folder in usr/share,
2006-02-19T17:26:00.000Z	anap		but i can't, it tells me i don't have permission, even though i have gone to a shell as root
2006-02-19T17:27:00.000Z	anap		how do you change this so i can put files in /usr ?
2006-02-19T17:29:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	unless that path is set as ro, you can write stuff as such
2006-02-19T17:33:00.000Z	anap	hatake_kakashi	it is set up as read only for ;group', i.e. any one who is not owner, no?
2006-02-19T17:34:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	if you can't do it even with root, then imo, there is something wrong
2006-02-19T17:35:00.000Z	anap	hatake_kakashi	thanks...
2006-02-19T17:36:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	imo, root has control over any sort of restrictions imposed, by general means that is. If root cannot do it, then there is something not set up correctly.. maybe you have /usr as a different hdd/partition and that it is mounted as ro?
2006-02-19T17:37:00.000Z	anap	hatake_kakashi	 i do not have partitions or differeng hard drives
2006-02-19T17:37:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	ok I presume / has mount settings as rw?
2006-02-19T17:38:00.000Z	anap	hatake_kakashi	sorry for being to beginner here... you refer mount as the directory, mnt?
2006-02-19T17:39:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	no mount as in the program 'mount'
2006-02-19T17:43:00.000Z	anap	hatake_kakashi	if it is the mount executable file in bin, it is read and executable for group and others, but only write by owner
2006-02-19T17:44:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	what I mean is type 'mount| grep /'
2006-02-19T17:44:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	and tell me the output of that
2006-02-19T17:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	anap	np
2006-02-19T17:46:00.000Z	anap	hatake_kakashi	i have put it in a private window
