2009-06-04T18:53:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		can anyone solve my problem which i posted here  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1170177
2009-06-04T18:54:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	looks like catkiller had some good advice... about as good as it comes
2009-06-04T18:55:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	just buy nvidia
2009-06-04T18:56:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	because Intel graphic are bottom rung, they for lack of better words "suck"
2009-06-04T18:57:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	been running ubuntu for 1.5 yr so i am still green, but yes vast majority of graphic issues come from intel, ATI second to that , and nvidia seems to be the best so far.. i just got an nvidia 9500gt card that i love
2009-06-04T18:59:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	 just a series
2009-06-04T18:59:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	if you can afford a card... no thought needed
2009-06-04T19:12:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	just a thought... did you try booting to recovery and then selecting fix-x? caution tho, back up /etc/X11/xorg.conf first as it will be replaced
2009-06-04T19:14:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	not much luv for intel in the room atm lol
2009-06-04T19:15:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	if your following the other discussions... intel graphics issues
2009-06-04T19:16:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	as in intel sux if you watch long enough you will form the same opinion
2009-06-04T19:20:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	for kicks pastebin your xorg.conf plz
2009-06-04T19:21:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	in fact google returned your trouble thread lol
2009-06-04T19:22:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	yes
2009-06-04T19:24:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	can you pastebin your current xorg.conf ?
2009-06-04T19:26:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	yes i know... that was a week ago, updates, your fiddling, anything could have changed
2009-06-04T19:34:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	yes i am trying to find something
2009-06-04T19:34:00.000Z	tj83_	PerryArmstrong	k
