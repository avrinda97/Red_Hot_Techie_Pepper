2006-06-23T06:11:00.000Z	cookiecaper		:\ I'm having problems with my new ATi card ... it keeps telling me no GL support is present for a lot of things, although I've installed all the fglrx stuff I can find and the official drivers.
2006-06-23T06:12:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	what sort of errors are you getting? API errors or something of that nature?
2006-06-23T06:14:00.000Z	cookiecaper	dicesquirrel	stellarium says, sdl: Couldn't set 1024x768 video mode: Couldn't find matching GLX visual!, mplayer -vo gl says [gl]  no GLX support present, tuxkart PW: Unable to open a suitable graphics window,
2006-06-23T06:14:00.000Z	cookiecaper	dicesquirrel	I might be missing some stuff too, I haven't ever had functional 3d acceleration on here ... I just got this ATi card today.
2006-06-23T06:15:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	ahh, there's a wiki entry that should work for you, it did for me... one sec

2006-06-23T06:36:00.000Z	cookiecaper	dicesquirrel	It didn't work : ( fglrxinfo returns Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual! and none of the stuff opens ; (
2006-06-23T06:37:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	hmm.... I'm combing the forums
2006-06-23T06:38:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	could you open your xorg.conf (in /etc/X11/ ) and tell me what driver it says you're using?
2006-06-23T06:38:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	and is this after a restart of xorg?
2006-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	okay, let me post my xorg.conf to a pastebin, and you can compare yours to mine
2006-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	what card are you using?
2006-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	cookiecaper	dicesquirrel	9600 Pro
2006-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	not too terribly far off from mine. I'm using a 9000 Mobility
2006-06-23T06:41:00.000Z	cookiecaper	dicesquirrel	ok, I'll check it out
2006-06-23T06:45:00.000Z	cookiecaper	dicesquirrel	they're the same with the exception of the monitor's and your touchpad, although you load module i2c and I don't.
2006-06-23T06:47:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	you can always give it a try, backup backup backup :D
2006-06-23T06:48:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	cookiecaper	I have to be off, but if you want to talk with me some more if this problem persists, you can talk to me on AIM. Same name as here. :)
