2005-06-09T10:24:00.000Z	dooglus		but I won't kiss you.
2005-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	dooglus		I just looked in /usr/local for files and found one:
2005-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	dooglus		chris@chrislap:~$ find /usr/local -type f
2005-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	dooglus		/usr/local/share/fonts/fonts.cache-1
2005-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	dooglus		how did that get there?  in fact, how did all those empty directories get there too?
2005-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	DanielC	dooglus	My thoughts exactly.  :)
2005-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	dooglus		apt-file search /usr/local/ finds nothing - no package puts anything there?
2005-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	dooglus	DanielC	do that "find /usr/local -type f" - how many does it find?
2005-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	dooglus		(-type f is "just show files, not symlinks or directories")
2005-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	DanielC	dooglus	one
2005-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	dooglus	DanielC	the same one as me?
2005-06-09T10:27:00.000Z	DanielC		yup
2005-06-09T10:28:00.000Z	dooglus	DanielC	I'm running a program called 'cruft' which checks your filesystem against the packages you've installed, and tells you which files you're missing, and which ones it can't account for.
2005-06-09T10:29:00.000Z	DanielC	dooglus	ok
2005-06-09T10:29:00.000Z	dooglus	DanielC	doh.  it took ages to run, and output to standard output, scrolled off the top of the screen...
2005-06-09T10:29:00.000Z	dooglus		running it again to a file.
2005-06-09T10:30:00.000Z	DanielC	dooglus	Thanks for the help.
