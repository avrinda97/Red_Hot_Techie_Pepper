2010-05-14T15:17:00.000Z	hmw	chouchou	what is it anyways?
2010-05-14T15:19:00.000Z	hmw	chouchou	ah, I didn't see the "it" in "how do i set it lpls" - thought you asked for a "LPLS" program *grin* So your problem is, that you already made a user and set the wrong dir?
2010-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	chouchou	hmw	exact
2010-05-14T15:22:00.000Z	hmw	chouchou	i don't know either. It should be /etc/passwd - sudo gedit /etc/passwd - but be careful, messing this file up might render your box inaccessible
2010-05-14T15:23:00.000Z	hmw	chouchou	you did create a user and gave it a home folder, as far as i could see
2010-05-14T15:23:00.000Z	chouchou	hmw	I want to change the home folder
2010-05-14T15:23:00.000Z	hmw	chouchou	i don't know either. It should be /etc/passwd - sudo gedit /etc/passwd - but be careful, messing this file up might render your box inaccessible
2010-05-14T15:25:00.000Z	hmw	chouchou	this command creates an entry in /etc/passwd, there you will find that wrong home directory
