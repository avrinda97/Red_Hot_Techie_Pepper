2005-01-12T17:21:00.000Z	emanuelez		trying to convert a RedHad friendly demon start script... any simple way to convert it?
2005-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	opi	emanuelez	start-stop it's something like /etc/init.d/scripts?
2005-01-12T17:23:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	exactly
2005-01-12T17:27:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	go to #flood then :)
2005-01-12T17:29:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	i found drivers for this printer... but only in rpm format
2005-01-12T17:30:00.000Z	opi	emanuelez	convert it with Alien
2005-01-12T17:30:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	that's what i did
2005-01-12T17:30:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	but alien doesn't convert daemon start stop scripts
2005-01-12T17:30:00.000Z	opi	emanuelez	sure it dosne't :)
2005-01-12T17:30:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	:)
2005-01-12T17:31:00.000Z	opi	emanuelez	so convert it to tgz, unzip, grab driver and put in Ubuntu's CUPS
2005-01-12T17:31:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	all the files and setup is aready done... i just need to convert the start script
2005-01-12T17:32:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	i bet there is an elegant debian way to do it
2005-01-12T17:32:00.000Z	emanuelez	opi	i wish it was that simple. it's a winprinter so it needs more drivers than a ppd file
