2005-08-08T15:23:00.000Z	hmrocha		hi
2005-08-08T15:24:00.000Z	hmrocha		i just installed breezy colony-2 from the cd, and it's all fucked up
2005-08-08T15:24:00.000Z	hmrocha		i installed it in another partition because i have an hoary2breezy here
2005-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	hmrocha		i upgrades X and now i have all this fucked up too
2005-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	hmrocha		i deleted xorg.conf and did an dpkg-reconfigure to create a new one
2005-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	hmrocha		but X still doesn't work
2005-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	hmrocha		i know some people that have breezy working
2005-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	hmrocha		what can i do to make X work?
2005-08-08T15:26:00.000Z	hmrocha		it tries to start the graphic mode, switches to text again, this is repeated 3 times i guess, then the system crashes
2005-08-08T15:27:00.000Z	om_	hmrocha	you have something messed up somewhere, why not try a fresh install?
2005-08-08T15:27:00.000Z	hmrocha	om_	i did a fresh install of breezy colony-2 moments ago
2005-08-08T15:28:00.000Z	hmrocha		it's all fucked up
2005-08-08T15:28:00.000Z	om_	hmrocha	why not use hoary?
2005-08-08T15:28:00.000Z	hmrocha	om_	because breezy uses gtk2.8
2005-08-08T15:29:00.000Z	om_		yes, and?
2005-08-08T15:29:00.000Z	hmrocha	om_	and i want to try to use the new version of gnome
2005-08-08T15:31:00.000Z	hmrocha		i guess i'll have to wait for breezy colony-3
2005-08-08T15:52:00.000Z	hmrocha	om_	it's working now
