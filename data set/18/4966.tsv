2009-01-21T06:34:00.000Z	VaxNam		Hey everyone, Wondering how to remove something from the startup menu. Everytime I start Ubuntu the Install menu shows up, but I allready have the OS Installed. I installed Easy Peasy distro for ubuntu. Anyone have Ideas?
2009-01-21T06:35:00.000Z	VaxNam		Hmm, any help?
2009-01-21T06:36:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	Startup stuff?
2009-01-21T06:37:00.000Z	VaxNam	vigo	Any Ideas?
2009-01-21T06:37:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	There is a GUI in System> Admin that is a clicky to stop or start programs on boot
2009-01-21T06:39:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	it worked for me and was easy.
2009-01-21T06:39:00.000Z	VaxNam	vigo	I'm using a Easy Peasy
2009-01-21T06:40:00.000Z	VaxNam	vigo	I don't have an option like that, but I tried Session > Startup and it wasn't there.
2009-01-21T06:40:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	whoops,, look at what Flannel popped on
2009-01-21T06:45:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	okee dokee,,was Flannel that suggested it, but that is a fix that I have seen work
2009-01-21T06:50:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	what version?
2009-01-21T06:52:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	uhm ok,,let me look up easy peasy
2009-01-21T06:55:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	Okay, is at sourceforge, is not an official Ubuntu package, but heck, back-up, re-install
2009-01-21T06:57:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	Ubuntu does have some PPC and other distros that may work,,if you go Terrminal, yes, they might could be removed,,but without proper documentation it is a tough call.
2009-01-21T06:58:00.000Z	VaxNam	vigo	I see
2009-01-21T07:07:00.000Z	VaxNam	vigo	and IndyGunFreak: Thank You so much for the help. I'm very greatful for the help!
2009-01-21T07:09:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	it works, so all good
2009-01-21T07:09:00.000Z	vigo	VaxNam	Make a backup first!
