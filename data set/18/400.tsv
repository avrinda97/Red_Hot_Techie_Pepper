2012-05-14T22:28:00.000Z	phunyguy	Captain_Proton	banshee goes through the motions, but it doesnt really add themusic.
2012-05-14T22:29:00.000Z	phunyguy	Captain_Proton	 it's almost as if the music gets added to the filesystem, but not added to the database properly on the phone
2012-05-14T22:31:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	phunyguy	 have you seen this
2012-05-14T22:31:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	phunyguy	http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/transfer-music-media-ipod-ios-device-linux/
2012-05-14T22:33:00.000Z	phunyguy	Captain_Proton	that software package is already installed and a newer version than the one in the ppa.
2012-05-14T22:34:00.000Z	phunyguy	Captain_Proton	i can see the phone in banshee, and can browse the filesystem, but music wont add properly.
2012-05-14T22:35:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	phunyguy	well in the end you could install wine then Itunes
2012-05-14T22:35:00.000Z	phunyguy	Captain_Proton	if I was to do that, I would just load up the macbook I got for free as well, but I hate that thing.
