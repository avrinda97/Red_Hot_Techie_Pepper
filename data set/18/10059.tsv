2007-08-23T09:09:00.000Z	perka		Is it possible to run ubuntu from a USB drive? I have a fully working installation on a HDD that I have put in a USB-box.
2007-08-23T09:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	yes
2007-08-23T09:11:00.000Z	perka	Jack_Sparrow	anything in particular I need to consider?
2007-08-23T09:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	Not really, other than having it use vesa driver for use on different systems
2007-08-23T09:12:00.000Z	perka	Jack_Sparrow	So how do I start it, do i need to install grub on the computer I am running it from?
2007-08-23T09:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	google linux on usb and you should find a good tutorial... sorry I dont have access to the link atm... I hate to tell people go google this or that.
2007-08-23T09:14:00.000Z	perka	Jack_Sparrow	It is the installation from my laptop, I do now wish to reinstall or reformat or anything, it is just temporary until my computer is back from repairs.
2007-08-23T09:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	That site will tell you how to create a ubuntu usb ... and it works... I thought I used the install cd to create it...  HAve you considered running livecd  with a persistent usb.... it is quick to set up.
2007-08-23T09:17:00.000Z	perka	Jack_Sparrow	the live cd sounds like a plan. Can I configure the livecd to use the root filsystem (or at least home directory) from my usb drive?
2007-08-23T09:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	yes
2007-08-23T09:17:00.000Z	perka	Jack_Sparrow	cool, thanks!
2007-08-23T09:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	The base image for persistent is just over 40 megs
2007-08-23T09:18:00.000Z	perka	Jack_Sparrow	yeah but I do not want it to use an image I want it to use the already present home directory on the usb drive
2007-08-23T09:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	If you need help .. just ask...  I made an ISO of basic persistent flash so I can stamp copy on usb for friends
2007-08-23T09:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	Create persistent drive... then copy over home to the usb
2007-08-23T09:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	Any changes on persistent drive are same as a hd install
2007-08-23T09:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	You will run into a couple issues with permissions... as the default user on persistent is "Ubuntu"
2007-08-23T09:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	perka	Once you create PER. usb then boot to it and create user name from other system
