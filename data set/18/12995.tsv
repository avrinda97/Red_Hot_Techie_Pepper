2006-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	GKJ		I am back everyone
2006-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	GKJ		Who installed Ubuntu recently
2006-01-28T13:20:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 I installed it a couple of days ago, but not for the first time.
2006-01-28T13:22:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 What are you trying to do?
2006-01-28T13:23:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	I want to typeset my articles and download video and audio and chatting on the net and do some math job
2006-01-28T13:23:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	is it too much for Ubuntu
2006-01-28T13:23:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 http://ubuntuguide.org will help you set up a lot of things
2006-01-28T13:24:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 I don't know much about typesetting under linux.  Chatting is certainly possible.  Video and audio work well.  Math, I don't know about, depends on the specific task and whether software exists
2006-01-28T13:24:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 First of all, chatting is easy.  What protocol do you use to chat?
2006-01-28T13:24:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	thanks for the site, I will browse it and if any question, I will bother you, hope you are available :p
2006-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	latex works perfect under linux, so it is the main reason I want to migrate from windows to linux
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 Great.  I didn't know you knew how to use latex, I wouldn't exactly point the general population at it :-)
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	I want to use irc client to chat and gaim, math job will use matlab
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 Sounds like you have all those tasks nailed down, then
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	ok, I will turn to other for help, but thanks all the same
2006-01-28T13:27:00.000Z	mitrovarr	GKJ	 For audio and video, that guide should explain how to get the codecs.  I recommend Xine and Kaffeine.
2006-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	thanks for your recoomendation, I will google them and download to try
2006-01-28T13:29:00.000Z	GKJ	mitrovarr	entertainment is not the first thing I will take care of, math work and typeset will be first
