2008-04-14T19:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	nothing jumps out at me there.  have you edited out sources you have used in the past..
2008-04-14T19:42:00.000Z	Morydd	Jack_Sparrow	no. I'm just getting used to ubuntu from debian, so I haven't started experimenting yet. :)
2008-04-14T19:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	what have you installed manually?
2008-04-14T19:45:00.000Z	Morydd	Jack_Sparrow	several things from .deb files.
2008-04-14T19:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	was this a feisty install you upgraded to gutsy?
2008-04-14T19:45:00.000Z	Morydd	Jack_Sparrow	yes.
2008-04-14T19:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	Ok, one of those debs is what is messing you up..
2008-04-14T19:46:00.000Z	Morydd	Jack_Sparrow	Is there a simple way to hunt through them, or am I likely going to have to uninstall each and test for the broken one?
2008-04-14T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	no easy way to do it..
2008-04-14T19:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	SOunds like you used a deb from debian repo that was not available in ubuntu.. (for a reason)
2008-12-16T20:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Morydd	Did you look at the webcam help page here
2008-12-16T20:18:00.000Z	Morydd	Jack_Sparrow	where is "here"
