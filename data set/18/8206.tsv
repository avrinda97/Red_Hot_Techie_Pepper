2007-09-25T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	secher	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization claims the processor doesn't support it
2007-09-25T07:12:00.000Z	secher	jrib	lol@dell then! Telling me i can run a virtual machine on an m1330 with basic specs, and sell me a processor on it that doesnt support it...
