2008-04-11T18:17:00.000Z	jack_spratt		ok, this is frustrating, 1233 users, many or most of whom have used ndiswrapper i imagine, none of whom are prepared to even aknowledge as much or give me a few simple replies

2008-04-11T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	jack_spratt	if no one knows how to help you, no one will answer.  Try again later or try the other !support options
2008-04-11T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	jack_spratt	have you read the wiki page on wifi however?
2008-04-11T18:21:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	i think so, can you link?
2008-04-11T18:22:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	i read the help pages associated with the apps
2008-04-11T18:22:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	ok
2009-09-20T19:16:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	Thanks
2009-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	when I do 'find /boot/grub/stage1
2009-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	which should I use?
2009-09-20T19:19:00.000Z	jrib	jack_spratt	the one you were using before :)  compare /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-09-20T19:19:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	ah OK, makes sense
2009-09-20T19:22:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	how am I supposed to identify from menu.lst which is the correct one? of the two that grub lists (hd2,0 and hd3, 0) only hd2,0 is mentioned, and that appears to be a vista loader
2009-09-20T19:22:00.000Z	jrib	jack_spratt	use the one for your main system, it doesn't really matter
2009-09-20T19:24:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	well there is only one gnu/linux install that I care about attached to this machine, so I can't do too much damage right? I mean if I specify the important one the I've got the right drive, and if I don't then it probably refers to a redundant install anyway that is no longer functional
2009-09-20T19:26:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	should I install grub on both hd3 and hd2 just to be on the safe side? or do one at a time and reboot?
2009-09-20T19:28:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	ok well I'm going to restart now and see if it worked. Thanks for your help
2009-09-20T19:41:00.000Z	jack_spratt	jrib	et.al.: that didn't work :( despite apparently succesfull grub reinstall via CLI I still get error17
