2010-04-13T13:56:00.000Z	Shafiei		:(
2010-04-13T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	exactly, it's an X server
2010-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	it's the visual aspect, the "windows" if you like
2010-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	Shafiei	ikonia	: you mean something like kubunto
2010-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	no, the Xserver is the visual aspect of Linux, the "engine" that runs the windows
2010-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	Shafiei	ikonia	: or what!!
2010-04-13T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	what do you mean "or what ?"
2010-04-13T13:58:00.000Z	Shafiei	ikonia	: aha. something like visual machine in windows
2010-04-13T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	yeah
2010-04-13T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	no
2010-04-13T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	sorry - not virtual machines
2010-04-13T13:59:00.000Z	Shafiei	ikonia	: hmm
2010-04-13T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	think of the visual aspect of Windows, the actual windows on screen, X is the driver of the "windows" in linux, the engine that draws them
2010-04-13T13:59:00.000Z	Shafiei	ikonia	: o0ps! i think  i gotcha
2010-04-13T14:00:00.000Z	Shafiei	ikonia	: never tried to use it un fortunately
2010-04-13T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	that's not really on topic for this channel, this channel is for ubuntu support discussion only
2010-04-13T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Shafiei	try ##hardware
