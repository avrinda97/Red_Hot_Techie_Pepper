2009-12-29T17:02:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	you can add your extra repository in the third party tab ,
2009-12-29T17:03:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	where is the third party tab ? Im on 9.10
2009-12-29T17:03:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	hold on
2009-12-29T17:04:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	yes my apologies, you were right, "other software" ( I'm using a french version here and they've changed the tab names, sorry)
2009-12-29T17:04:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	ok np
2009-12-29T17:05:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	can u help me edit my sources file? Im using the docs from torproject.org
2009-12-29T17:06:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	that software sources app edits the source list for you , that's why I told you about it , I don'T play in /sources.list myself, too easy to mess up
2009-12-29T17:07:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	oh i see .. so where should go in Software sources ? I got tabs: ubuntu software;other software;updates;authentification;statistics
2009-12-29T17:09:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	 if you need to add a repository that is not from canonical go to the "other software" tab
2009-12-29T17:11:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	i added this deb     http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <karmic> main   so how to proceed ?
2009-12-29T17:13:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	hit the close-finis-exit-end button, what ever that is and you will be asked if you want to reload the repos, say yes , be patient it might take some time,  that is the same as doing "sudo apt-get update" in the terminal
2009-12-29T17:14:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	 i reloaded and i got the same msg: "cant index the repo" and error with the gpg line .. same thing when I tried to gedit the sourcef file
2009-12-29T17:14:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	hold on, let me try on my end
2009-12-29T17:17:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	I'M getting the same,  what is he url to the guide you are following for this ?
2009-12-29T17:18:00.000Z	zer0_mood	Pelo	its http://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en but i will try with this http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-tor-to-surf-anonymously-in-ubuntu-feisty-with-firefox.html
2009-12-29T17:19:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	 hold on , I think I found the problem
2009-12-29T17:22:00.000Z	Pelo	zer0_mood	first do the gpg lines a bit further down the the sources.list stuff,  just put each line in the terminal and hit henter,   then before you get to the apt-get upgrade stuff,   this is the line you want to use in software sources  ---->     deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org karmic main
