2007-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	blrich		can someone tell me how to install a package from packages.ubuntu.com?  i have a package.orig.tar.gz containing a bunch of .pkg files and i have no idea how to install it with dpkg
2007-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	blrich		i am in a real bind, if anyone can help that would be great
2007-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	apt-get install [packagename] 
2007-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	er, with sudo
2007-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	and that'll work even with an orig.tar.gz in the same directory?
2007-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	do i have to put the tar.gz in the package repository dir or something?
2007-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	no.  That works through the internet.  Package.ubuntu.com is a place to browse.  You don't need the tar.gz
2007-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	well i downloaded the package because i don't have the internet, i need to install it manually before i get drivers support for my network card to get on to the net
2007-04-20T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	ah.  You need to download the .debs, that gz you have now is a list of names of packages.
2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	okay cool, but where do i find the .deb downloads? there doesn't seem to be any links to a .deb on the individual package pages
2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	on each package's page, at the bottom, is a little table with different arches.  Click your arch, and you'll be able to choose a mirror to download a specific .deb file. install that with dpkg (don't forget dependencies!)
2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	OH wait.
2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	You need ndiswrapper?
2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	ah cool thankyou!
2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	no i have nforce 430 chipset, i need restricted drivers, which i *think* will work
2007-04-20T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	Restricted drivers?  That's not a package.  But, ndiswrapper is on the CD you have, you dont need to sneakernet, youve already got it
2007-04-20T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	blrich	you might be interested in ndiswrapper
2007-04-20T10:00:00.000Z	blrich	Flannel	RAOF, SuperLag, the problem is when i run lspci, it just has tonnes of 'unknown nvidia device'. the built in ethernet on the board has drivers for it, but (i think) because i don't have drivers for the system bus (nforce 430 drivers) i can't even get the system to see the ethernet either
