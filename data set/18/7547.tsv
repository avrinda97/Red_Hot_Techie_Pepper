2008-01-10T22:27:00.000Z	Murdoc650		I need helping accessing my XP HD from Ubuntu, can anyone help me out?
2008-01-10T22:27:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	what's the problem?
2008-01-10T22:27:00.000Z	Murdoc650		I need to get stuff off my XP HD and put it on my Ubuntu one, but I'm not sure how
2008-01-10T22:28:00.000Z	Murdoc650		about 100GB
2008-01-10T22:28:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/<windows device and partition> /<mountpoint>
2008-01-10T22:29:00.000Z	Murdoc650	inxane	is that a code I have to use? cus I have yet to figure out most of Ubuntu
2008-01-10T22:30:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	you have to use it from the terminal.  Applications > Acessories > Terminal
2008-01-10T22:30:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	but you have to know the device and partition for your XP drive
2008-01-10T22:30:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	such as, /dev/hda1
2008-01-10T22:31:00.000Z	Murdoc650	inxane	its ntfs partition, not sure what you mean by device
2008-01-10T22:31:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	i hate to say it, but you need to do a little bit of research on basic linux administration first.
2008-01-10T22:31:00.000Z	Murdoc650		yeah tell me about it, with work and school finding the time is hard though
2008-01-10T22:32:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	this isn't exactly something that is easy to explain, if you don't really have any idea...
2008-01-10T22:32:00.000Z	Murdoc650		well I know alot about computers, but I'm not sure what you mean as device, its a WD250GB SATA drive
2008-01-10T22:33:00.000Z	Murdoc650		so this drive would be /dev/sda/sdal?
2008-01-10T22:33:00.000Z	Murdoc650		yeah
2008-01-10T22:34:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	but in linux, every device is a file. so the physical representation of your drive is a file... such as /dev/hda represents the primary master PATA drive in your system
2008-01-10T22:34:00.000Z	inxane	Murdoc650	and /dev/hda1 would be the first partition of that device
