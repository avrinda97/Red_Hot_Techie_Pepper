2005-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		Only reason I'm in the shell is because x refuses to start
2005-09-18T07:40:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		normaly I just use xchat
2005-09-18T07:41:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		So... I installed the updates today, and all of the sudden after turning my comptuer back on after the update, my computer won't start X
2005-09-18T07:42:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		are other poeple experiancing the same problems?
2005-09-18T07:42:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I'm pretty helpless in the shell, It took me 15 min to figure out how to connect to this irc server
2005-09-18T07:44:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I don't think Xchat will work in the shell
2005-09-18T07:44:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I accutally had to boot into recovery mode or something
2005-09-18T07:45:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I don't even know what this client is. I just typed irc and hoped something would run, lucky me I have a shell irc client
2005-09-18T07:46:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		this one suits my purposes
2005-09-18T07:47:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		When I boot normaly It goes allthe way to where it starts X then it freezes. And my keyboard stops responding completly
2005-09-18T07:48:00.000Z	cevizoglu	JairunCaloth	you should try going through the terminals and see if it's displaying any other errors
2005-09-18T07:48:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I can't
2005-09-18T07:48:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I can't switch terminals, everything locks up
2005-09-18T07:49:00.000Z	cevizoglu	JairunCaloth	ctrl-option-F1 does nothing?
2005-09-18T07:49:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I rebooted into recovery mode, but I still can't switch terminals. Which makes it really hard for me to fix whatever is going on. Nornally I have #ubuntu and the internet to help
2005-09-18T07:50:00.000Z	JairunCaloth	cevizoglu	nope
2005-09-18T07:50:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I can't even get numlock to light up
2005-09-18T07:51:00.000Z	cevizoglu	JairunCaloth	are you in breezy, warty or hoary?
