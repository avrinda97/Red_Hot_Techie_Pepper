2010-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd		should be an example file in your profile dir
2010-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd		userChrome-example.css
2010-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	PingFloyd		seriously though, the userChrome.css file is optional
2010-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	PingFloyd	if I rename it nothing happens..
2010-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	try creating a new profile
2010-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	firefox -P
2010-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	PingFloyd	I know - but as mentioned, I can't see anything I type in firefox...
2010-01-30T06:48:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	PingFloyd	no, I made a new profile and it stayed the same, even after using the example userchrome and userContent
2010-01-30T06:49:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	PingFloyd	I think it's just that those files don't have the things that I need changed in them - I fixed this before a loooong time ago by getting a userchrome.css from another gtk theme - but I can't find one now :/
2010-01-30T06:51:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	yeah, the userChrome.css controls what the ui fonts and colors are etc.
2010-01-30T06:51:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	sounds to me that the gtk theme you're using isn't mixing so well with how firefox uses it, no big surprise though with firefox
2010-01-30T06:52:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	firefox does some pretty silly things
2010-01-30T06:52:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	like how it totally ignores font hinting set by gnome
2010-01-30T06:53:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	the example files you can use as a base
2010-01-30T06:53:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	one sec
2010-01-30T06:55:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html
2010-01-30T06:55:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	the example file doesn't have anything set, everthing is commented
2010-01-30T06:55:00.000Z	PingFloyd	shazbotmcnasty	you can use that as a template though (cp it to userChrome.css) and then edit it from there
