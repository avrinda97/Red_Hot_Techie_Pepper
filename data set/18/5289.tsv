2008-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	Vinceman		hi, how do you change your menu-links?
2008-11-24T09:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	the gnome menu? right click the menu and choose "edit menus"
2008-11-24T09:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	yep :)
2008-12-08T01:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	that's just a version number, doesn't tell you much about the file
2008-12-08T01:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	it should
2008-12-08T01:29:00.000Z	Vinceman	ardchoille	unless there are copyrights?
2008-12-08T01:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	Well, if an app is in the repos, then it should install.. even the licensed stuff asks you to agree with the license before it will install
2008-12-08T01:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	which app from the repos?
2008-12-08T01:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	that's a lib, not sure if it will have an executable
2008-12-08T01:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	libboost-graph looks like it is more something to use coding C++ rather than an app you can run
2008-12-08T01:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	 open a terminal and run: apt-cache show libboost-graph
2008-12-08T01:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	look at the description
2008-12-08T01:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	how did you install it?
2008-12-08T01:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	I thought you said you installed it from the repos, if you installed it manually, then apt-cache isn't going to help
2008-12-08T01:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	apt-cache search -n libboost-graph
2008-12-08T01:42:00.000Z	Vinceman	ardchoille	http://paste.ubuntu.com/82115/
2008-12-08T01:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	yes, look at the description, it's not an app you can run
2008-12-24T17:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	Vinceman	you also must consider that some of use don't even use sound, I'm not even sure if mine works
