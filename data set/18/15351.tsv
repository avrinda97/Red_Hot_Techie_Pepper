2005-04-09T11:18:00.000Z	kpeterson		When I try to change my resolution in the gnome screen resolution preferences GUI, the options presented only go as high as 1024x768.  I have tried editing my xf86config-4 file but have been unsuccessfull... any ideas?
2005-04-09T11:19:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	Are you using livecd?
2005-04-09T11:20:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	No i Have hoary installed
2005-04-09T11:20:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	hold on a minute...
2005-04-09T11:25:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	You might look at the settings in a livecd boot and compare to your install. I had to make certain cheat codes to get ubuntu to see my screen as 1280x1024. When I then installed the settings were 1280x1024 on the install.
2005-04-09T11:26:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	I am not farmiliar with the concept of cheat codes
2005-04-09T11:28:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	So what I gather is that I need to boot from a live CD, find that xf86conf4 file and compare it to my installed version?  Then what do I do?
2005-04-09T11:28:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	look at knoppix and the knoppix home page.  http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Cheat_Codes    some are xres=1280x1024, screen=1280x1024,   vga=794,   these are some for different distros using that technology.
2005-04-09T11:29:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	OK so when I boot the live CD a present a cheat code, THEN check out the conf file and do a little copy/paste
2005-04-09T11:30:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	Get it up on livecd in hte mode you want, yes, copy off the settings in the config file, I forget which... I'm not in Ubuntu right now, but I did get Warty to install with 1280x1024.
2005-04-09T11:30:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	So it would be unwise to do a complete copy/paste?  I only want to replace a certain section?
2005-04-09T11:36:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	Thanks for your suggestions
2005-04-09T11:36:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	Compare and it should help you figure it out if noone gives a direct answer here.  I jumped in becaused you asked and weren't getting an answer right away. I recall having some difficulty getting it going and now I don't recall which of those cheat codes was the one.
2005-04-09T11:37:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	Oh allright, thank you very much, hopefully i can figure it out
2005-04-10T07:26:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	Hi, did ou get your screen resolution worked out?
2005-04-10T07:27:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	Ah, nice to see you again! I did get the live version working in the correct res, but have not had luck editing the XF86Config file.  Randy_345 says that i should edit xorg.conf so I will try that
2005-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	HillTop	kpeterson	looks like some more help here. :)
2005-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	kpeterson	HillTop	Indeed, thanks for you help!
