2011-07-21T06:06:00.000Z	Guest51695		10.04 is cool.
2011-07-21T06:07:00.000Z	Guest51695		11.04 has given me 12 hours of problems so far.
2011-07-21T06:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	most problems w/ 11.04, are unity related, not kernel related...
2011-07-21T06:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	so your problem is pretty irrelevant to his.
2011-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	why were you using su anyway?
2011-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	then you should have read his whole comment.. he wants to try 10.04, becuase 11.04 is having kernel issues,  so i asked, why does he think 10.04 will fix the prob.
2011-07-21T06:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	not really.
2011-07-21T06:11:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	if you think i was being a dick, then that just shows your misunderstanding of what i said.
2011-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	guess the same thing applies to being clueless, huh?
2011-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest51695	that simply proves my point
