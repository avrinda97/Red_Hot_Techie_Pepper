2006-10-05T13:44:00.000Z	KEA0463		this is the best working version of linux i tried
2006-10-05T13:44:00.000Z	KEA0463		i tried gentoo
2006-10-05T13:44:00.000Z	KEA0463		but it said it didnt ahve wireless support
2006-10-05T13:44:00.000Z	KEA0463		so i installed ubuntu
2006-10-05T13:44:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	it does if you want to install it :)
2006-10-05T13:46:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	it doesn't have wireless support by default you have to install everything from scratch
2006-10-05T13:50:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	umm it depends on preference it's easy to just try out browsers
2006-10-05T13:57:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	no Gentoo has the biggest support but then again they hate rest of the distros
2006-10-05T13:59:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	gentoo is harder then most distros but then again LFS is harder
2006-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	to run wine you open up a terminal and do wine <program>
2006-10-09T10:10:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	umm no sicne it will be just black but you can make it have a background
2006-10-09T10:33:00.000Z	kitche	KEA0463	it's more like Unix instead of like linux
