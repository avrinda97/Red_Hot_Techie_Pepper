2009-03-21T02:16:00.000Z	mralexandro		how do i open the nvidia control panel in ubuntu hardy heron 8.04
2009-03-21T02:16:00.000Z	ahlala	mralexandro	: did you have the latest drivers installed ?
2009-03-21T02:17:00.000Z	ahlala		got nvidia Ge Force4Ti 4200
2009-03-21T02:18:00.000Z	mralexandro		<ahlala> i dont know about the latest driver. since this is a laptop the graphic driver is listed as prohibited or something. but i downloaded trough hardware drivers manager. is there a place i can find the latest?
2009-03-21T02:21:00.000Z	ahlala	mralexandro	: my experience is : debian, ubuntu. ubuntu studio after the install (8.10) and the upgrade, the update manager notified me an upgrade for my graphic card's driver, done it, and it installs automatically The Nvidia Driver Settings (v96) in order to use correctly my card with twinview, etc.
2009-03-21T02:22:00.000Z	ahlala	mralexandro	: accessible in the Gnome Menu, under administration
2009-03-21T02:22:00.000Z	ahlala		after the install reboot and you'll enjoy
2009-03-21T02:25:00.000Z	mralexandro	ahlala	no i do not have that under administration. but i have installed the nvidia driver. it is a prohibited driver or something. what that means i do not quite understand except it is because brands like dell and hp make drivers specifically for their laptops themselves
2009-03-21T02:26:00.000Z	mralexandro	ahlala	proprietary drivers they are called
2009-03-21T02:26:00.000Z	mralexandro		yeah i have proprietary DasEi
2009-03-21T02:26:00.000Z	ahlala	mralexandro	: don't worry about the message, if the system detects a driver update, try to enable it, reboot, and go under the administration->Nvidia server settings and try to configure
2009-03-21T02:27:00.000Z	ahlala		if it doesn't work, just deactivate trhe driver and reboot
2009-03-21T02:28:00.000Z	mralexandro	ahlala	i have restarted and compiz fusion effects work good. like cube etc. the graphic card works. it is just that i think i remember that first time after installing ubuntu hardy heron on a computer you have to activate the nvidia controll panel
2009-03-21T02:28:00.000Z	mralexandro		with a command in terminal
2009-03-21T02:29:00.000Z	ahlala	mralexandro	: if it works..it's cool !!! :)
2009-03-21T02:30:00.000Z	mralexandro	ahlala	yeah but i want control panel, so i can configure hdmi settings and stuff
2009-03-21T02:30:00.000Z	ahlala		so you got to have access to the Nvidia driver settings and configure it!
2009-03-21T02:36:00.000Z	mralexandro	ahlala	in my case the nvidia controll panel was not installed when i installed the nvidia drivers. the drivers work, but the control panel or settings manager is not included. any clue on how to "activate it" or something?
