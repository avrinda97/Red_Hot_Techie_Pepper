2007-02-11T07:05:00.000Z	Alzi2	jrib	Not really private, but.. kind of illegal (it's a rom.....) but my grandma has it so i think it's legal
2007-02-11T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	Alzi2	ok, well you might have to add it to the mime database.  Are you familiar with doing that?
2007-02-11T07:06:00.000Z	Alzi2	jrib	Nope.
2007-02-11T07:06:00.000Z	Alzi2	jrib	Wait.. it's in KDE.. you know that, right?
2007-02-11T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	Alzi2	join me in #ubuntu-classroom please
2007-02-11T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	Alzi2	oh, no I didn't know it was in kde
2007-02-11T07:07:00.000Z	Alzi2	jrib	Sorry for the misunderstanding, then.
2007-02-11T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	Alzi2	does that work?
2007-02-11T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	Alzi2	try that konqueror menu that ubotu mentioned
2007-02-11T07:12:00.000Z	Alzi2	jrib	Yes, i did, but what to do in that section?
2007-02-11T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	Alzi2	I'm not sure, I don't use kde.  If it isn't clear and no one here knows, you might try #kubuntu
