2011-02-09T13:25:00.000Z	Abinadai	YankDownUnder	I'll try that first thanks
2011-02-09T13:28:00.000Z	Abinadai	YankDownUnder	I'm reading the site that you pointed me to, but it appears they are talking about tweaking windows versions of FF.  Am I lucid after being at the computer for 18 hrs?
2011-02-09T13:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Abinadai	Keep reading - it gets directly into tweaking the browser via the "about:config" URL.
2011-02-09T13:29:00.000Z	Abinadai	YankDownUnder	ok
2011-02-09T14:04:00.000Z	Abinadai	YankDownUnder	thanks

2011-02-09T14:05:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Abinadai	Um...what are you trying to ping?
2011-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	Abinadai	YankDownUnder	I was just trying to find my ip address outside of my router.
