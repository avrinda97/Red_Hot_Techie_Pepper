2009-10-21T03:55:00.000Z	dpanda		windows 7 is releasing tomorrow, ubuntu 9.10  in next 8 days & i'm in a dual state of mind :)
2009-10-21T03:55:00.000Z	dpanda		i need to buy a new computer, and i will assemble it myself, so how do i ensure to get compatible hardware
2009-10-21T03:57:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	i just set up a new comp with ubuntu actually!
2009-10-21T03:58:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	oh nice! share the specs please :)
2009-10-21T03:58:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	im using core i5 on asus p7p55d pro
2009-10-21T03:59:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	how much for the core5
2009-10-21T03:59:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	cheap
2009-10-21T04:01:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	and significantly better [faster in layman's words] then a core 2 duo?
2009-10-21T04:01:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	its a 4 core, so yes
2009-10-21T04:03:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	i5 cpu and 1156 board is the 'mainstream' 4 core system
2009-10-21T04:03:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	fiding the right motherboard might be a problem in my city though :)
2009-10-21T04:05:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	oh no no i am not from the US
2009-10-21T23:48:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	hey remember yesterday u mentioned core i5, spent quite few hours checking prices, they are still quite costly here in india man
2009-10-21T23:49:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	but cheaper than i7
2009-10-21T23:50:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	go amd then
2009-10-21T23:51:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	thinking to settle with a core2duo
2009-10-21T23:52:00.000Z	snellcode	dpanda	for a bit more $ you can get a lot more value with i5
2009-10-21T23:53:00.000Z	dpanda	snellcode	actually as they are pretty new around here, prices differ a lot [in india] & shipping from US is not practical :(
