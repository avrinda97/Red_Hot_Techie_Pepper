2010-06-03T11:00:00.000Z	eveningsky_		Sorry if someone already answered this, I lost my connection:  Is there some way to trace what app or service is intercepting a keyboard shortcut?
2010-06-03T11:01:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	its most likely your window manager or desktop environment. What keycombo is it?
2010-06-03T11:02:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	alt+(left or right) arrow. I don't see it in metacity. It could be in compiz somewhere, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to search what it is doing.
2010-06-03T11:03:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	there is. ccsm>advanced search and click on the keyboard icon in the Filter box there then do the keybinding
2010-06-03T11:05:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	:( no keyboard filter.
2010-06-03T11:06:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	install sexy-python package
2010-06-03T11:10:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	No matches. I sure wish I could just give shortcut priority to the active window. I use a lot of app specific shortcuts, and try to map most of the os shortcuts that I actually use to the super-key.
2010-06-03T11:11:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	Well that was my only idea :)
2010-06-03T11:11:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	thanks anyway. what else did I install with sexy python?
2010-06-03T11:11:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	No idea, but you need it for that keyboard icon feature
2010-06-03T11:16:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	hehe
2010-06-03T11:19:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	onetinsoldier, "No doc available yet, but the function name should be pretty self-explanative." ?????
2010-06-03T11:29:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	onetinsoldier, Basically it looks like python-sexy gives python bindings to libsexy, which makes 4 features available to gtk dialogs. So, I guess, Compiz is just written with some features that take advantage of libsexy if it's
2010-06-03T11:30:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	Does that solve any of your problem?
2010-06-03T11:33:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	does alt+r/l work without compiz enabled?
2010-06-03T11:34:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	interesting. yes, not only that, but it it works after re-enabling compiz too.
2010-06-03T11:35:00.000Z	soreau	eveningsky_	cool :)
2010-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	eveningsky_	soreau	I guess I need to write some kind of script to kill and restart compiz on startup. I did that for several weeks as the only way to get jack to work with the pulse-jack script. but after a couple rounds of updates that started working right.
