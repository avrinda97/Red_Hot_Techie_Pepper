2008-10-31T20:08:00.000Z	erisco		how do I find out what device my usb stick is using?
2008-10-31T20:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	 check dmesg right after you plug it in. is one way
2009-01-07T06:57:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	thanks
2009-01-07T07:00:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	I have to do setup on the client as well?
2009-01-07T07:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	  not messed with that in ages.. i dont recall much setup needed on the client end..  Perhaps set the gateway/dns to be the ics server..
2009-01-07T07:01:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	I have zero ability to setup anything on the client. its DHCP or nothing
2009-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	 no idea then.  of course you could set up a dhcp server :)
2009-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	is this easier with firestarter?
2009-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	I tried firestarter in the past but it completely screwed up iptables and I couldn't connect to anything anymore
2009-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	 no idea.  firestarter does the exact same 'commands' it just has a gui to them..
2009-01-07T07:03:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	and I couldn't find anyway to set iptables back to the default
2009-01-07T07:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	 'sudo iptables --flush' i recall. :)
2009-01-07T07:04:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	will this remove important things I need though?
2009-01-07T07:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	 it fluses out/removes all existing iptables rules that you have setup..   check iptables docs/guides to see how it works..
2009-01-07T07:06:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	firestarter is freezing on me
2009-01-07T07:06:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	whenever I try to select a list of devices it freezes for a few seconds
2009-01-07T07:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	erisco	 i never use firestarter.. so no idea. could be its doing some scanning/work
2009-01-07T07:06:00.000Z	erisco	dr_willis	it is running very very slow
