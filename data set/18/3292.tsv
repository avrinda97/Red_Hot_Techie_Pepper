2010-02-16T06:44:00.000Z	LordHawke13		I want the BASH script to change the ownership of the resulting DMG file to the person who typed `$ sudo makedmg . . . . .`
2010-02-16T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 make use of the $USER variable
2010-02-16T06:46:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	Since SUDO is used, ${USER} = root
2010-02-16T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 incorrect... try 'sudo echo $USER'
2010-02-16T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 if you did 'sudo su' -> USER = root
2010-02-16T06:49:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	You have to type SUDO to run the script. That makes the $USER variable root when it's used in the script.
2010-02-16T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 it dosent seem to do that here.  let me try it with a script
2010-02-16T06:50:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	You got email or IM? I could send this to you.
2010-02-16T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 Hmm. yep. a seperate script does do it that way but not via the commandline.. Interesting  how its doing that.
2010-02-18T17:28:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	you're here!! Can you help me?
2010-02-18T17:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 depends on the problem.
2010-02-18T17:28:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	Is there anyway I can enclose each LINE of output from `$ find <DIR>` in double-quotes? I need to put them through `$ stat -c%s <OUTPUT>` but stat won't do spaces unless the item is enclosed in parentheses.
2010-02-18T17:29:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	I tried `$ for SIZES in `find <DIR>`; do stat -c%s "${SIZES}"; done` but for processes for each word and not each line.
2010-02-18T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	 im not clear on what the actual probl3m is.
2010-02-18T17:30:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	stat won't stat anything with a space in it's name or full path.
2010-02-18T17:31:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	So I need to enclose the output in double-quotes.
2010-02-18T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LordHawke13	  to handle spaces in filenames/paths you need to tack on quotes normally single quotes mey be better then double quotes
2010-02-18T17:31:00.000Z	LordHawke13	Dr_Willis	It's for a script. Each ";" would be a line return, but this is how it's written in the BASH history.
