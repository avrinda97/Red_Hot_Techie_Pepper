2005-04-14T16:16:00.000Z	bob2`	pastyhermit	woody gets security updates very quickly, and as far as i know has no outstanding serious security issues
2005-04-14T16:17:00.000Z	pastyhermit	bob2`	ahh ok, cause thats contrary to what I was reading, I read a review that said it hadnt been updated since 2002
2005-04-14T16:17:00.000Z	pastyhermit		I will download woody theyn
2005-04-14T16:17:00.000Z	pastyhermit		thanx
2005-04-14T16:17:00.000Z	bob2`	pastyhermit	? woody was released in 2002, and thus has only been updated for security issues since then.
