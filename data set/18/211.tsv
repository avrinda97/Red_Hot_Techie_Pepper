2012-07-14T06:01:00.000Z	mpwd		Oh, like KDE vs. GNOME vs. XMonad or whatever
2012-07-14T06:03:00.000Z	mpwd		And the instructions are the same
2012-07-14T06:03:00.000Z	mpwd		Here's XMonad (my favorite): http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_Gnome
2012-07-14T06:04:00.000Z	mpwd		Here's some other alternatives: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-alternatives-unity-ubuntu-users-linux/
2012-07-14T06:04:00.000Z	mpwd		(although the instructions are for v11)
2012-07-14T06:05:00.000Z	mpwd		IDK I just use XMonad and Unity
2012-07-14T06:05:00.000Z	mpwd		Depending on my mood/what I am doing
2012-07-14T06:07:00.000Z	mpwd		And take less memory
2012-07-14T06:08:00.000Z	mpwd		Myhero:  Well, it has a lot of features that are nice
2012-07-14T06:08:00.000Z	mpwd		Unity is similar to OS X in some respects
2012-07-14T06:08:00.000Z	unodx	mpwd	unity sucks and you know it
2012-07-14T06:09:00.000Z	mpwd	unodx	 Yeah, but it's shiny and makes newcomers to the OS feel better about themselves
2012-07-14T06:09:00.000Z	unodx	mpwd	it sucks for previous users and we are jumping ship
2012-07-14T06:10:00.000Z	unodx	mpwd	so you never really gained anything except loosing self respect for trying to imitate another os which we used to look down upon
2012-07-14T06:12:00.000Z	mpwd	unodx	Well… I frankly just run ubuntu in VirtualBox on my mac.  Mostly for grad school stuff.
2012-07-14T06:13:00.000Z	mpwd	unodx	Mind you, I'm not a mac fanboy… but… netflix :(
2012-07-14T06:14:00.000Z	unodx	mpwd	yea, i'm not a fan of ubuntu either...i have no loyality, i use whatever gives me the most secure and efficient platform
2012-07-14T06:14:00.000Z	mpwd	unodx	ditto
