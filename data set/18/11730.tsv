2006-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	stefg	feihung	no.... please ignore my last comment... i just got a strange behaviour of *my* chat client
2006-06-29T12:13:00.000Z	stefg	feihung	BTW , what kernel are you using?
2006-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	feihung	stefg	my kernel is 2.6.15-23-386
2006-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	stefg	feihung	Ok... because with the -25 there are a lot of difficulties reported. Can you paste your /etc/fstab and and the output of sudo fdisk -l to  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ ?
2006-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	feihung	stefg	I just unplug all harddrive and plug only cdrom with ubuntu dapper live cd, the result is same it "Hangs" for 3 minutes in mounting root file system do you think this still from Harddrive problem or Bios problem thanks.
2006-06-29T12:22:00.000Z	stefg	feihung	no, i think it's a bug in the ubuntu kernel. I have issues with this, too. try booting without 'quiet splash' boot-parameters, that helped in my case.
2006-06-29T12:25:00.000Z	stefg		Does hdparm do this?
2006-06-29T12:25:00.000Z	feihung	stefg	yes I did it and it hangs between these lines ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7 on irq 14, hdc=noresponse (status=0x67) ,
2006-06-29T12:28:00.000Z	stefg	feihung	does this sound familiar? https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/6157
2006-06-29T12:31:00.000Z	stefg	feihung	maybe try 'noacpi' as a boot option
2006-06-29T12:37:00.000Z	feihung	stefg	yes I did all this options noacpi noapic or nolapic
2006-06-29T12:42:00.000Z	feihung	stefg	this is my /var/log/messages http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16778
