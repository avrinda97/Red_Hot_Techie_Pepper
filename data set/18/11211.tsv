2007-06-08T10:58:00.000Z	puff		Something odd is going on with my dvd burner, no matter what disk I put in, it tells me it's a bad disk.
2007-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	puff		This is frustrating... my hard drive is full and I can't get ntfs write or CD burning to work.
2007-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	install ntfs-3g
2007-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	I did.  the external drive doesn't show up when I run ntfs-config.
2007-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	does it get mounted though?
2007-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	The ntfs?  For read, yes.
2007-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	install ntfs-config.. it'll let you control how the ntfs partition is mounted
2007-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	I did. The external drive doesn't show up when I run ntfs-config.
2007-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	Though it shows up in /media/LACIE.
2007-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	wierd.. unmount it and remount it with the ntfs-3g driver
2007-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	i'm guessing you just don't mount the ntfs partition with write support but you have the drivers to do that
2007-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	How do I remount it with the ntfs-3g driver?  That is, am I supposed to see it in ntfs-config then, or do I need to edit /etc/mtab?
2007-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	it's better to put it in /etc/mtab
2007-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	Hokay.
2007-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	i thought you should put it in /etc/fstab
2007-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	but i'm not that geeky to know
2007-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	puff	nuked_omen	Yeah, sorry, mtab is generated automagically IRRC.
2007-06-08T11:10:00.000Z	nuked_omen	puff	also, make sure you turn off windows by shutting it down.. if you don't follow the right procedure for shutting down windows, it'll be hard to mount the ntfs partition on linux
