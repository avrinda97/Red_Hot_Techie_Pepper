2006-08-27T08:27:00.000Z	lupine_85		different features :)
2006-08-27T08:27:00.000Z	lupine_85		joe, vi, nano are all ok as well
2006-08-27T08:28:00.000Z	lupine_85		the only time I use vi is on my SBC
2006-08-27T08:28:00.000Z	lupine_85		it's not smart enough to have vim
2006-08-27T08:28:00.000Z	lupine_85		All that I can figure out is that the ext2fs partition "thinks" that it's 900MB in size
2006-08-27T08:28:00.000Z	lupine_85		when the physical disc space allocated to it is much higher
2006-08-27T08:29:00.000Z	lupine_85		e2fsresize can rejig the partition so that it takes up more space
2006-08-27T08:29:00.000Z	lupine_85		it can also trash your installation
2006-08-27T08:29:00.000Z	lupine_85		SBC-single board computer
2006-08-27T08:29:00.000Z	lupine_85		(use it as a router)
2006-08-27T08:30:00.000Z	matthewf	lupine_85	ahh.. i have a VIA EPIA system here... bigger then a SBC but not by much heh
2006-08-27T08:32:00.000Z	matthewf	lupine_85	i have this Mini ITX board installed in a full ATX case... it looks werid
2006-08-27T08:32:00.000Z	lupine_85	matthewf	mine is about 8"x6" alu case
2006-08-27T08:33:00.000Z	matthewf	lupine_85	well Mini ITX cases are expensive, picked up a small ATX mini tower for much less
2006-08-27T08:34:00.000Z	matthewf	lupine_85	to get a nice Mini-ITX case + PSU would have cost me over 100 .. this case cost me 60 .. w/ 300w PSU
2006-08-27T08:36:00.000Z	matthewf	lupine_85	and oh my god that is the most getto case ive ever ever seen, infact why didnt you just run it caseless ?
2006-08-27T08:36:00.000Z	lupine_85	matthewf	not mine ;)
