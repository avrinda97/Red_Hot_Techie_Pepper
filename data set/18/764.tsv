2011-09-21T17:26:00.000Z	xannen		Question: Postgresql: How to change user password with password prompt, securely?
2011-09-21T17:27:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	try sudo -u postgres psql postgres
2011-09-21T17:31:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	"ALTER ROLE myuser WITH PASSWORD 'hu8jmn3';" BUT it's sent in clear-text, not secure
2011-09-21T17:32:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	I understood that command and am aware of the clear text problem.  I'm googling about it, and haven't found an answer yet.
2011-09-21T17:35:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	i think you might be able to do this: "ALTER ROLE myuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'md5-of-password'"
2011-09-21T17:39:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	how do I get the md5-of-password?
2011-09-21T17:40:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	It is surprising that something this simple is not implemented or can be easily found out.
2011-09-21T17:41:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	online service, one of many: http://www.md5.cz/
2011-09-21T17:41:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	you could also make a simple script to do it
2011-09-21T17:43:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	jwrigley : Specifically how do I integrate the md5 generation digest within the psql command line mode.
2011-09-21T17:43:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	if you're using psql, why don't you just use /password? :s
2011-09-21T17:45:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	I guess I could.  Just wondering if SQL-standard command covers it.
2011-09-21T18:05:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	i don't know if it's random or blank, but you can log in only locally using Ident (e.g. using sudo -u postgresql psql) until you set a new password
2011-09-21T18:05:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	that's what I do.  But just curious.
2011-09-21T18:06:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	it would be wrong to allow outside access to your pg server without any password :)
2011-09-21T18:08:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	I have read that ident could also pose security risk, and there are suggestion to change mode to md5 in the hba.conf file and restart postgresql.
2011-09-21T18:10:00.000Z	bilygates	xannen	i don't see how it could be a security risk, but maybe someone from #postgresql can answer to that
2011-09-21T18:11:00.000Z	xannen	bilygates	I do not know exact details either.  I'm still learning and exploring.  :-0
