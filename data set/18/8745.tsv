2007-07-03T11:20:00.000Z	Stwange		how do I list all .pl files in a directory, including in sub directories? I tried ls -R "*.pl" but it didn't work
2007-07-03T11:22:00.000Z	Stwange		ls: *.pl: No such file or directory
2007-07-03T11:22:00.000Z	Stwange		but there are definately .pl files in the sub directories
2007-07-03T11:23:00.000Z	Stwange		with the command ~/Desktop$ ls -R *.pl
2007-07-03T11:24:00.000Z	Stwange		james@ubuntu-desktop:~/Desktop$ ls -R *.pl
2007-07-03T11:25:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	"ls -R | grep .pl"
2007-07-03T11:26:00.000Z	Stwange	vox754	the grep didn't work I don't think, it listed everything
2007-07-03T11:27:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	works for me
2007-07-03T11:27:00.000Z	Stwange	vox754	- did I need the quotes?
2007-07-03T11:28:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	no, but now that you mention it. Yes "find" is the proper solution.
2007-07-03T11:28:00.000Z	Stwange	vox754	 yeah you're right actually your's does work - it lists the .pl at the top, but then lists everything else. I could have worked with that
2007-07-03T11:31:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	well for me, it doesn't list everything, just the files with extension .pl, although you have to remember that grep searches regular expressions which means they can appear in the middle of a file name.
2007-07-03T11:32:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	it can be improved with "grep .pl\> " I think, so you can select starting or ending of a word.
2007-07-03T11:33:00.000Z	Stwange	vox754	- yeah, they all had .pl in it :) thanks
2007-07-03T11:47:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	maybe "gcc-4.1-doc"
2007-07-03T11:48:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	use "aptitude search" and "apt-cache search" as much as you can
2007-07-03T11:49:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	but first "man aptitude" and "man apt-cache"
2007-07-03T12:26:00.000Z	vox754	Stwange	maybe with "aptitude purge <package>"
