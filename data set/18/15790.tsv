2005-04-06T15:47:00.000Z	bi3zt		what r the files bash_profile and bashrc ?
2005-04-06T15:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 read the first few lines of each, should describe
2005-04-06T15:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 bash is he default shell for most every distro, but is not mandatory, one could install zsh and remove bash, perhaps
2005-04-06T15:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 sudo /etc/init.d/...
2005-04-07T16:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 what is it that you are worried about in your $HOME ?
2005-04-07T16:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 and a dot in front, right?
2005-04-07T16:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 your home directory is where you store per-user configuration data
2005-04-07T16:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 those files are your configuration for the shell, not something to worry about
2005-04-07T16:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 no, the shell is the shelll, the user uses the shell to get things done
2005-04-07T16:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 those files are your configuration for the shell, not something to worry about
2005-04-07T16:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 they store your personal preferences, and modifying them allows you to change the behaviour of the shell
2005-04-07T16:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 read through them and you will see they are not a danger to you
2005-04-07T16:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 what gave you the idea that those files were a danger to you?
2005-04-07T16:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 watch them?
2005-04-07T16:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 iyou can chmod them to 600 if you like, though i don't see why
2005-04-07T16:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 chmod 600 ~/.bash*
2005-04-07T16:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 no sudo on that
2005-04-07T16:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	bi3zt	 then only you can read or write to them
