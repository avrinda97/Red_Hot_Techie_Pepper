2008-09-14T10:21:00.000Z	TrustNoOne		i have an .iso image that is a video file, how can i view it in linux without burning it? I want to have a virtual drive mount it...
2008-09-14T10:22:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	mount -o loop -t iso9660 file.iso /mnt/test
2008-09-14T10:22:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	thx ill try that
2008-09-14T10:22:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	there are some GUI programs to do that as well ifyou prefer
2008-09-14T10:26:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	gmount-iso
2008-09-14T10:26:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	thank you
2008-09-14T10:33:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	the iso i mounted is all vob files (for a dvd) how can I play them without having to individually click each one? (like in windows, WMP would do that)
2008-09-14T10:37:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	you need something that will play DVDs, check out https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html#dvdplayback or give VLC a try
2008-09-14T10:37:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	tried VLC... will only play 1 vob at a time
2008-09-14T10:37:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	ill check the linkg thx
2008-09-14T10:38:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	i think there is some way using VLC to get it to to play the whole thing, but i don't remember exactly
2008-09-14T10:40:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	Acetar thanks you guys, it worked by opening the disc in VLC player...
2008-09-14T10:40:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	great to hear, VLC is a nice bit of software :)
2008-09-14T10:41:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	well i must use totem over the network on my windows shares, as VLC will not play anything over my network (gives error messages)
2008-09-14T10:41:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	but I use totem for that so it's not a huge deal :p
2008-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	ah yeah, that is a nice feature of totem, if you want to do that with VLC you can use smbfs, try installing PyNeighborhood for a nice interface
2008-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bringatowel	i have the shares mounted using smbfs...
2008-09-14T10:43:00.000Z	bringatowel	TrustNoOne	oh well that is strange then, as long as the shares are mounted properly VLC should have no problems...
