2009-12-19T23:37:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	lol, is that like street cred in the linux community?
2009-12-19T23:42:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	ubuntu-restricted-extras?
2009-12-19T23:43:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	that doesn't sound like it, had something to do with multimedia
2009-12-19T23:43:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	that package has a ton of multimedia codecs
2009-12-19T23:44:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	yeah, the one with all the multimedia codecs, that's the one.
2009-12-19T23:45:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	I want to be able to watch dvd's on my box, and I'm thinking there may be some stuff in there to help with my AMD64 ATI driver woes.
2009-12-19T23:45:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	google around for medibuntu. That might help you a lot.
2009-12-19T23:46:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	YESS, medibuntu was it.
2009-12-19T23:46:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	thankya.
2009-12-19T23:46:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	np, hope it works for you
2009-12-19T23:48:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	how quaint.  google search for medibuntu leads me to medibuntu.com lol
2009-12-19T23:48:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	that was unexpected. I didn't know they had their own site; I was expecting some helpful blogs
2009-12-19T23:49:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	Same, seems when it was referenced the other day here, it was an obscure blog/wiki site.
2009-12-19T23:50:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	if you have logs, open them and Ctrl+F or / or whatever
2009-12-19T23:51:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	Still haven't gotten around to learning where all the logs are kept for what, not really how to read them well.  AND, I'm sitting on a fresh install, because that's usually easier than doing a lot of research or forum/irc channel trolling trying to get an answer how to fix what I just broke. ;)
2009-12-19T23:53:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	irc logs are probably kept in a dot file in your home dir, i.e. ~/.xchat2/Logs or something like that
2009-12-20T00:08:00.000Z	Surlent777	jmyers	that was my reason for loving KDE =D
2009-12-20T00:09:00.000Z	jmyers	Surlent777	To each his own I presume.  They are all very familiar, just minor differences.  Or they were years ago when I was into linux more heavily.
