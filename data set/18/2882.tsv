2010-01-30T19:31:00.000Z	bitplane		Hi. I'm having network problems. I rebooted and everything stopped working, it doesn't get ethernet. I've tried my cable in a Windows machine, works fine. I tried a live CD which used to work, but it doesn't anymore.
2010-01-30T19:32:00.000Z	bitplane		I'm looking for some tips, what should I do next? If the MAC address got scrambled, would that break ethernet access?
2010-01-30T19:32:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	what is the output of ifconfig -a?
2010-01-30T19:33:00.000Z	bitplane	mmvv	one moment... it's tehre but says "carrier:0"
2010-01-30T19:34:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	you've rather lost me. ifconfig -a should list all devices and their current status
2010-01-30T19:36:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	you say it works in windows?
2010-01-30T19:36:00.000Z	bitplane	mmvv	the status of eth0 has no ip4 address, I looked in the filesystem place and read some stuff online, carrier should be = 1 if it has a cable
2010-01-30T19:37:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	I have an ethernet port of my laptop that I have to set up with ethtool No link until I do so
2010-01-30T19:38:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	which is why I was asking about the windows installation that you mentioned apparently worked
2010-01-30T19:38:00.000Z	bitplane	mmvv	I mean the hardware doesn't physically have link lights at either end, too damn cheap
2010-01-30T19:38:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	I got you. So linux sees the port because it is listed in ifconfig -a
2010-01-30T19:39:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	and when you unplug the cable from the linux box and plug it in another machine, that one gets link?
2010-01-30T19:39:00.000Z	bitplane	mmvv	yes, works on this laptop here in Windows, so it's not the cable
2010-01-30T19:40:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	Ubuntu in their wisdom took ethtool out of the standard installation
2010-01-30T19:41:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	does the machine have wireless access to the net?
2010-01-30T19:41:00.000Z	bitplane	mmvv	Ubuntu doesn't recognise my wifi card :(
2010-01-30T19:41:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	is this a laptop?
2010-01-30T19:42:00.000Z	mmvv	bitplane	you can download ethtool from the repos on the windows machine and stick it on a usbstick
