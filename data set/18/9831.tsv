2007-02-19T16:36:00.000Z	lisapc		where can I download ubuntu torrent pls?
2007-02-19T16:37:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	ubuntu.com is quicker to download from
2007-02-28T15:17:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	i run with 512 with no problem. xfce on 256 is smooth
2007-03-15T14:36:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	if you do 'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart' does that fix sound?
2007-03-15T14:36:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	im not sure if thats alsa-util or utils
2007-03-15T14:37:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	never tried it
2007-03-15T14:37:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	sound works great, but just not at the very first boot of the day
2007-03-15T14:38:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	that is very odd :)
2007-03-15T14:38:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	yeah. sound works great!  but not when I do the first boot of the day!  any ideas why?
2007-03-15T14:38:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	so I always have to boot Ubuntu twice each morning
2007-03-15T14:39:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	shall I try your clommand at the fuirst boot?
2007-03-15T14:39:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	i would. i honestly dont know though if that is the case.
2007-03-15T14:40:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	any other ideas to try as well?
2007-03-15T14:40:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	would save me having to rebooot each morning
2007-03-15T14:41:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	restarting that should work. maybe running alsamixer in terminal and messing with volumes while playing an mp3 or something. thats a very strange problem not sure
2007-03-20T15:12:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	is that one of those geek languages? like klingon?
2007-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	dyrne	lisapc	after all that work with the dictionary? :)
2007-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	lisapc	dyrne	 well it doesnt work
