2007-07-20T14:10:00.000Z	jjlee		how does one tell synaptic that one wishes it to install security updates?
2007-07-20T14:10:00.000Z	jjlee		the manual seems chock-full of manual package management stuff
2007-07-20T14:10:00.000Z	jjlee		but I never do that
2007-07-20T14:10:00.000Z	ror	jjlee	repositories
2007-07-20T14:11:00.000Z	jjlee		I install things with aptitude install, and install updates when prompted to do so
2007-07-20T14:11:00.000Z	jjlee	ror	strawberries
2007-07-20T14:11:00.000Z	ror	jjlee	try clicking options > repositories; then the third tab or something you can choose what updates it installs
2007-07-20T14:11:00.000Z	ror		and you can choose on other tabs where to get updates from
2007-07-20T14:12:00.000Z	ror		for example you can turn on backports
2007-07-20T14:12:00.000Z	jjlee		I don't know where ubuntu wants me to install updates from
2007-07-20T14:12:00.000Z	jjlee	ror	I'm happy to trust the ubuntu people as to which packages it's sensible to update
2007-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	jjlee	ror	but it seems aptitude doesn't want to tell me
2007-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	jjlee	ror	(I'm on kubuntu at home, so can't just click the orange icon that pops up on ubuntu proper)
2007-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	jjlee		s/aptitude/synaptic/
2007-07-20T14:14:00.000Z	jjlee	ror	so what am I supposed to do with a list of repositories?
2007-07-20T14:14:00.000Z	ror		ok jjlee open synaptic; click settings then repositories; then click updates; then under Automatic updates tick "check for updates" every X days; then "only notify about updates" or whatever
2007-07-20T14:15:00.000Z	ror		^^ that
2007-07-20T14:17:00.000Z	jjlee	ror	there is no updates button in the repositories dialog that I can see
