2008-11-25T20:27:00.000Z	reaktae		Hi guys. I'm trying to get ubuntu studio installed without partitioning my xp boot drive. Couldn't get wubi to install it for me and now I'm wondering if there's a way to install a boot loader that will mount a loop device and boot from it. Any ideas?
2008-11-25T20:29:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> wuvi is for temporary demo kind of thing, you dont want that to become permanent eh?
2008-11-25T20:31:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	i haven't had a chance to five ubuntustudio a try yet. If i can run it outside of a vm and make it happen with my firewire sound hw then I'll be more than happy to kill my xp for good...
2008-11-25T20:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> come again? can you clarify?
2008-11-25T20:39:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	i need a solution (preferably a bootloader) to load an image file, mount it as a loop device and install a system on that device
2008-11-25T20:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> umm, bootloader do load the image file, but not as loop device,-- you can not load bootloader at the same time installing
2008-11-25T20:42:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	sorry for the confusion - basically i'm trying to manually do what wubi does... i can't seem to find the right tools though
2008-11-25T20:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> you want to re-invent wubi? why not go see how the wubi code work?
2008-11-25T20:47:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	does wubi listen for any command lines params? i don't think i'll understand its c++ code but i read that it combines a few other existing tools - i was hoping to just follow wubi's steps using those. do i make any sense?
2008-11-25T20:49:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> i dont know the intimate details of wubi, but at the macro level, it seems one has to understand the ntfs and xp bootloader mechanism..
2008-11-25T20:53:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	i believe i do understand the mechanism pretty good. it just sounded dumb the way i worded what i was trying to do..
2008-11-25T20:53:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	thanks for your help tho :)
2008-12-26T21:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> 802.11n  am not sure if that is even really a standard, would another 802.11n device to talk to it?
2008-12-26T21:43:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	-> it's a draft, though well supported accross $m platform. i've got it nice and running at over 250MBps in XP...
2008-12-26T21:44:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> draft is not a standard,  and you really expect me to believe you are speeding at 250MBPs in the microsoft world?  hehe
2008-12-26T21:46:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	-> i know... so you're not aware of anything then, huh? i got a little further with smc's usb stick that comes with 2.6 compilable drivers but was hoping for something more polished....
2008-12-26T21:47:00.000Z	n8tuser	reaktae	-> nah, i seriously doubt it if you can find any that supports it
2008-12-26T21:48:00.000Z	reaktae	n8tuser	-> thanks anyway homie!
