2010-10-17T04:20:00.000Z	rockets		:-P
2010-10-17T04:21:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rockets	if you want maximum space, learn about tiling WMs
2010-10-17T04:21:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	Yeah, I used awesome for a long time.
2010-10-17T04:22:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	I used Awesome + Arch Linux for a long time.
2010-10-17T04:22:00.000Z	rockets		I like having a more normal window manager, that still gives me maximum window space.
2010-10-17T04:22:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rockets	lol, i'm on dwm and arch right now, slightly ot but what made you switch to ubuntu?
2010-10-17T04:22:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	got tired of having to hand configure every little thing.
2010-10-17T04:23:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	I have actual work to do.
2010-10-17T04:23:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rockets	have you tried openbox and pytyle?
2010-10-17T04:24:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	no desire to.
2010-10-17T04:24:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	also, arch is great with its AUR, but having to use the AUR on a slow netbook sucks. Takes forever to compile things.
2010-10-17T04:25:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rockets	yeah i suppose, its kinda like ppas but easier for the devs to distribute rather than having it easier for the users
2010-10-17T04:25:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	yeah well, having the huge repo of precompiled apps just makes netbook life easier.
2010-10-17T04:26:00.000Z	rockets	aeon-ltd	and with my compulsive tinkering, I never get any work done on arch.
2010-10-17T04:26:00.000Z	rockets		Speaking of work, it's time for me to go.
2010-10-17T04:26:00.000Z	rockets		Later y'all.
