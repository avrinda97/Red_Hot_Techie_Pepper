2006-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	ablomen		btw, is there a xgl .deb package or a repository that has it already? im not the compile from source type
2006-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	I think it made it to dapper
2006-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	dapper?
2006-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	http://packages.ubuntu.com/xserver-xgl
2006-02-21T10:53:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	thanks ill look there
2006-02-21T10:53:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	you'll probably run into dependancy hell
2006-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	yeah i figure, but it looks neat enough to try
2006-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	from what I've seen with NLD 10 it's great ...
2006-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	yeah the 3d and transperency stuff looks great, to bad we have to wait till version 6.* before its included in ubuntu
2006-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	switch to the dapper release and try the devel version ;)
2006-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	do i just change breezy into dapper in sources.list at the universe part?
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	yes it should work more or less , atleast that's what i did. had to work around a few problems with the packages
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	ok thanks ill do that and hope for the best ;)
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	and if you're new to this sort of thing , the kernel doesn't install right, it has a problem with mkinitrd
2006-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	so you can't boot :)
2006-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	do i have to update to that new kernel? should be optional isnt it?
2006-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	prada	ablomen	well ... just be careful ..
2006-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	ablomen	prada	lol ok thanks for the advies :)
