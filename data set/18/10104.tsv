2007-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	camerong		hey i need some help.. i am trying to get my ATI card to work (via https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ) and have learned that i need to run the command "sudo aptitude install module-assistant build-essential debhelper debconf dh-make fakeroot libstdc++5" and then "linux-headers-$(uname -r)" to acquire some things from a server.. however i do not have internet connection on my ubuntu box so i plan to download the fi
2007-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	you can't
2007-01-13T17:41:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	not unless you download the packages and burn them onto a cd
2007-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	you can use xorg - do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	then select "vesa"
2007-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	it will give poor performance but usable
2007-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	i am currrently set to vesa, i stil lneed the drivers for "startx" to do anything but return errors.. ive talked to 3 or 4 other poeple here about this and the only way i can really fix it is by setting up my internet on my ubuntu box by using commands at the "command prompt/bash/terminal/whatever its called"
2007-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	fair enough
2007-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	so how would i go about setting up my wifi at the terminal, do you think? and thank you for your help
2007-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	the guide on the forums does mention how to do it with the console
2007-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	thanks i will search the forums now unless you have the link offhand
2007-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	really, sorry  - not to hand
2007-01-13T17:47:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	thanks again il update you on my progress later
2007-01-13T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	also edgy uses the knew block id method of identifying disks - which may or may not make it upstream into the kernel
2007-01-13T17:48:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	i dont know what you mean about block ids and identifying disks etc.. but i can't find the wifi thread on ubuntuforums.org - i just searched
2007-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	camerong	check the wiki
2007-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	thanks, will do
2007-01-13T17:52:00.000Z	camerong	ikonia	before i can setup my wifi i need to download a package to use with the adaptor.. thats ahell of a catch 22 (so il never get it to work) guess il jkust uninstall ubuntu and find a new distro
