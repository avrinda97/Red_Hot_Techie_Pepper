2008-10-15T16:35:00.000Z	ziroday	tyberion	you might want to install the package nvidia-settings it contains an easy application for configuring externel monitors
2008-10-15T16:36:00.000Z	tyberion	ziroday	alrihgt, thanx, should an external monitor be working as soon as I plug it in, DVI output that is?
2008-10-15T16:36:00.000Z	ziroday	tyberion	if that is the only monitor then it "should" but sometimes may not
2008-10-15T16:36:00.000Z	ziroday	tyberion	make sure you have the nvidia drivers installed
2008-10-15T16:37:00.000Z	tyberion	ziroday	I have...
2008-10-15T16:37:00.000Z	ziroday	tyberion	you have what sorry?
2008-10-15T16:39:00.000Z	tyberion	ziroday	nvidia drivers installed, else I wouldnt be able to use compiz... so I just have to plug in my laptop to my dockingstation, connect the ds with the monitor via DVI, and select nvidia-settings in order to change to external?
2008-10-15T16:39:00.000Z	ziroday	tyberion	yep, its that easy :)
2008-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	tyberion	ziroday	will it automatically use 1280x800 for laptop and 1920x1200 for external?
2008-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	ziroday	tyberion	if you configure it so in the nvidia-settings then yes
