2008-10-28T17:23:00.000Z	KDB9000		hey everyone. I am having some trouble installing 8.10 into my Hardy system after a kernal update (not to Intrepid). I have an install log and it has "Failed to build fglrx-8.542 with DKMS". Any thoughts?
2008-10-28T17:23:00.000Z	KDB9000		Sorry, 8.10 is the for the ATi Driver
2008-10-28T17:24:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	are you doing a clean install or an upgrade?
2008-10-28T17:24:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	I removed the old version from DKMS so I would say clean. I had an old version for one of my other kernals but it broke after the kernal upgrade.
2008-10-28T17:25:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	so you want to upgrade to intrepid/
2008-10-28T17:25:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	not right now. Right now I just want to get my ATi card working with direct rendering again.
2008-10-28T17:28:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	one, it isn't fully released and isn't fully released till the 31 of this month plus I already have 8.04 and haven't seen the upgrade button yet, second, it won't solve my problem, I will still need to install the ATi drivers.
2008-10-28T17:30:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	right above you said "hey everyone. I am having some trouble installing 8.10 into my Hardy system after a kernal update (not to Intrepid)" I have no clue what you are trying to do b/c 8.10 is INTREPID
2008-10-28T17:31:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	and then i send another message clearing that up, saying 8.10 for the ATi driver
2008-10-28T17:32:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	so you want to install the ATI driver in hardy right?
2008-10-28T17:33:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	yes. I know ATi driver 8.10 has a GUI install and used that but I get an error. I also tried building the deb but I get an error.
2008-10-28T17:33:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	have you tried envy?
2008-10-28T17:34:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	envy?
2008-10-28T17:34:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	you can use EnvyNG to install the driver for you
2008-10-28T17:36:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	will it install the ATi drivers or the generic one?
2008-10-28T17:36:00.000Z	cambridgecow	KDB9000	it will install the LATEST ATI drivers
2008-10-28T17:37:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	I will give it a try and see what I get.
2008-10-28T17:48:00.000Z	KDB9000	cambridgecow	well it isn't completely up to date. ATi released 8-10,envy only shows 8-6
