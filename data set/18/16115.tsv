2005-04-24T13:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Hello, I want Ubuntu to automatically mount a folder on the file server (samba) on startup. I'm in fstab now, and I've configured it, I just want to check what I've done is correct
2005-04-24T13:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_		For filesystem I have //192.168.2.254
2005-04-24T13:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_		for mount point I have: /home/ubuntu/fileserver
2005-04-24T13:47:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	paste the whole line here (with fake username and password of course)
2005-12-12T15:36:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	format your /home partition and restore your data from a known good backup
2005-12-12T15:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_	topyli	i cant do that.. i dont have partition its one HD and plenty of important stuff on it.. isnt there any other way?
2005-12-12T15:36:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	if you think you're been cracked, you have to reinstall too
2005-12-12T15:39:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	you can try running chkrootkit and rkhunter. of course, you could run a virus scanner as well
2005-12-12T15:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_	topyli	i tried chkrootkit
2005-12-12T15:40:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	anyway, since someone has gotten into your system, you should take it offline and reinstall
2005-12-12T15:41:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	if you think they didn't get to the system itself, it's just your data
2005-12-12T15:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_	topyli	but how can i know that
2005-12-12T15:42:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	logs, modification times, dunno, it does seem like it's just your /home
2005-12-12T15:43:00.000Z	ubuntu_	topyli	its just that this command ./vadimII keeps running by itself.. thats about it
2005-12-12T15:47:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	just don't run services until you've set them up right. the permission thing can happen to anyone
2005-12-12T15:47:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	once :)
2005-12-12T15:47:00.000Z	ubuntu_	topyli	okay man, thanks.
2005-12-12T15:48:00.000Z	topyli	ubuntu_	you can test run services locally if you set up a firewall. firestarter is a nice one for that
