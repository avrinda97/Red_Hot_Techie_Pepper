2009-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Joeseph		Hi.   I am trying to recover some data from my friend's old broken Windows box.   In live, I can see both his hard drives, but they will not mount.  They give a long error message about an unclean shutdown and NTFS already being in use.   It gives 2 options: one for windows and linux.  The linux one says "You can use the 'force option for your own responsibility"  , but I don't want to break his data.   Any ideas?
2009-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Uplink	Joeseph	what does "sudo fdisk -l" say?
2009-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Joeseph	Uplink	Do you want me to pastebin it?
2009-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Uplink	Joeseph	yea
2009-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Joeseph	Uplink	It'll be just a second, I have to use a flash drive to transfer the info... no internet on the other pc.
2009-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Uplink	Joeseph	oh man... ok just tell me if you see NTFS on the list
2009-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Joeseph	Uplink	I'm working on getting internet up now, but I see no NTFS
2009-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Uplink	Joeseph	hmm then the drive is unreadable... try putting it on a ziplog bag and put it on a freezer for a night
2009-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Joeseph	Uplink	what?
2009-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Joeseph	Uplink	I take that back, I see two NTFS, but they are both in the 'boot' label part of the device.
2009-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Uplink	Joeseph	lol thats good
2009-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	Joeseph	Uplink	what else could be wrong?

2009-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	Uplink	Joeseph	WebcamWonder is right... whenever i hibernate my windows and boot on linux the partition wont mount
