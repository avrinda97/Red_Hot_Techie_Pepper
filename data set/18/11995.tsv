2007-04-29T13:19:00.000Z	Bulltitan		helllllp!! i cant uninstall a program it says post-removal script returned error code 1
2007-04-29T13:20:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	paste the whole output to a pastebin.
2007-04-29T13:20:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	it probably wants to remove a file that isn't there.
2007-04-29T13:24:00.000Z	Bulltitan	delire	what can i do
2007-04-29T13:25:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	paste the output and then i can help
2007-04-29T13:25:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	not here.. ouch.
2007-04-29T13:27:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	'sudo dpkg -P --force-all conexant'
2007-04-29T13:30:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	this connexant package is very annoying like this. try 'sudo aptitude remove connexant'
2007-04-29T13:30:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	if it wants to remove other packages though, don't say Yes.
2007-04-29T13:32:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	this package has been poorly put together.
2007-04-29T13:33:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	have you rebooted since installing it?
2007-04-29T13:34:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	this isn't normally necessary but i notice that it wants to remove something from /proc..
2007-04-29T13:34:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	have you tried removing it through synaptic?
2007-04-29T13:35:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	well you can be _very careful_ and 'sudo dpkg -L connexant' and then remove all the files by hand. once done you'll need to then tell apt to forget about that package though.
2007-04-29T13:35:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	but this is an extreme measure, i haven't had to do this in years.
2007-04-29T13:37:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	it's best to get software through Ubuntu repositories. externally packaged software can sometimes be a bit dodgy.
2007-04-29T13:38:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	you can always try to reinstall it first.. do you know where the package is?
2007-04-29T13:39:00.000Z	delire	Bulltitan	eg install and then uninstall it. 'sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file' and then 'sudo dpkg -P connexant'
