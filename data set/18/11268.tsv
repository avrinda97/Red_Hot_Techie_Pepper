2006-08-21T13:33:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha		Hi. I have Ubuntu 6 LTS Desktop AMD64. It worked fine during instalation (LIVE CD); I could start FireFox and Help. But, now (when it's installed), when I start help i get "application yelp has quit unexpectedly". When I start firefox in terminal I get "segmentation error". Help!

2006-08-21T13:42:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha		I also looked in a log after starting firefox: kernel: [1633.328617]  firefox-bin [8725] : segfault at 00...somenumbersandletters..0 rip 00002aaa...3298 rsp 0007ffffff98dc40 error 4

2006-08-21T13:45:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	is it only firefox and yelp?
2006-08-21T13:45:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	rkd	I don't know
2006-08-21T13:46:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	do most other programs work?
2006-08-21T13:47:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	see if "sudo aptitude reinstall yelp; sudo aptitude reinstall mozilla-firefox" fixes anything
2006-08-21T13:50:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	hmm, that's odd
2006-08-21T13:52:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	does it work when you try reinstalling firefox instead of yelp?
2006-08-21T13:54:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	oh, the package name is firefox, not mozilla-firefox, sorry
2006-08-21T13:58:00.000Z	rkd	Andy_Alpha	no problem, glad to be useful
