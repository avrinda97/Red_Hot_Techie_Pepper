2012-03-11T19:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	iLogical	 or plug it in and type sudo fdisk -l
2012-03-18T19:02:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	iLogical	 it's the normal behaviour - what goes wrong? is it wifi?
2012-03-18T19:02:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	it's regular router wireless
2012-03-18T19:07:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	I've found it :p
2012-06-19T02:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	iLogical	 logout, choose gnome shell, login
2012-06-19T02:10:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	There is 3 GNOME options, none of them says GNOME Shell
2012-06-19T02:10:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	iLogical	 try the one that wasnt there before you installed gnome shell
2012-06-19T02:11:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	I have tried it already
2012-06-19T02:15:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	:'-(

2012-06-19T02:18:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	maybe my hardware doesn't support it, how can I know?
2012-06-19T02:18:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	iLogical	 what three options do you see?
2012-06-19T02:20:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	iLogical	 logout and watch, 'something like that' is not valid
2012-06-19T02:24:00.000Z	iLogical	MonkeyDust	GNOME, GNOME Classic, GNOME Classic (No effects)        I've choosen GNOME Classic now, and I am thinking in sticking with it
