2006-01-10T11:58:00.000Z	Linuturk		can anyone point me to the contents of the ubuntu install DVD's? I've searched the wiki and forums with no results.
2006-01-10T11:59:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	what do you mean?  Please rephrase your question.
2006-01-10T11:59:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	I need to know what packages are on the DVD to see if it will help me with my problem
2006-01-10T12:00:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	have you got Ubuntu installed?
2006-01-10T12:00:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	no, i don't. I've got to use ndiswrapper-utils for my wireless before I can get net access with linux
2006-01-10T12:01:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	so, I've got to see if that package is on the DVD
2006-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	it should autorun so you can browse it under window, but you'll h ave to know the specific filesnames of the packages you are looking for.
2006-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	I haven't downloaded it yet. I want to make sure it's worth the several hours it's going to take to download. and, I've searched ubuntu.com
2006-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	ndiswrapper-utils
2006-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	just bite the bullet
2006-01-10T12:04:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	I could, or I could just go to work Friday and use the LAN. I'd rather not spend my time at work though
2006-01-10T12:05:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	the DVD is 2.8 Billion bytes and the rest of the available packages are on repositories or CVS.
2006-01-10T12:06:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	I won't have internet access until my wireless is working. so I don't have access to those repositories unless the ndiswrapper-utils package is on that DVD
2006-01-10T12:08:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	why don't you just d/l the ndiswrapper source while you're dling the Breezy ISO -- then youknow you have it for sure.  I'll check my apt-cache too for you.
2006-01-10T12:08:00.000Z	Linuturk	quacker	because I have no idea how to compile it, and that leaves tons of room for error on my part
2006-01-10T12:11:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	can't you just the darn thing inwhile installing so you can pull your Broadcom gak (or whatever) directly off the repos on t3h Intarweb?
2006-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	I meant at work -- you said you were going to go there anyhow
2006-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	quacker	Linuturk	did you catch what he said?
