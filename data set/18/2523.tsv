2010-07-16T07:23:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	I've never done it, but this page talks about formatting a usb: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2010-07-16T07:27:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	I've never done it :-). Does gparted see the device?
2010-07-16T07:28:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	is there an error message?
2010-07-16T07:30:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	try 'sudo fdisk -l' <--- that's a lower case L. Wanna pastebin the output?
2010-07-16T07:32:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	yep, first time's that hardest...
2010-07-16T07:33:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	now tell us the url it gave you :-)
2010-07-16T07:34:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	good, your device is /dev/sdb1. You can try 'sudo fsck /dev/sdb1' but I don't know how much checking you can do on a FAT16 filesystem...
2010-07-16T07:36:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	well, what happened when you typed 'sudo fsck /dev/sdb1' ?
2010-07-16T07:38:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	see, told you first time was the hardest! That's a perfectly good fsck, since the word 'error' doesn't appear anywhere. Go on to the next step in your instructions. Which web page are you using, btw?
2010-07-16T07:41:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	a fedora system? Or are you using fedora instructions on Ubuntu :-)
2010-07-16T07:47:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	I'm not convinced the instructions are valid for lucid. What about https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick instead?
2010-07-16T07:51:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	well, it's already formatted to fat16 according to fdisk, and fsck thinks it's ok. so does unetbootin read it?
2010-07-16T07:58:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	please rerun 'sudo fdisk -l' again and repaste...
2010-07-16T08:10:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	I'm not qualified to advise you any further. In your place, I'd google the error message and see if anything useful shows up...
2010-07-16T08:37:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	way to go!
2010-07-16T08:39:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	yup, that'
2010-07-16T08:39:00.000Z	Loshki	deexannihilate	yup, that's pretty conclusive. Good to know for future reference too...
