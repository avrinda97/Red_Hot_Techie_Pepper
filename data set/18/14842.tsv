2005-06-14T05:37:00.000Z	ck2	caine	did you make the floppy?
2005-06-14T05:38:00.000Z	ck2	caine	with some work you can make a bootable usb thumb drive - got one of those?
2005-06-14T05:39:00.000Z	ck2	caine	 no win98 CD?
2005-06-14T05:58:00.000Z	ck2	caine	can you get dad to turn it off or even just disconnect it from the LAN?
2005-06-14T06:12:00.000Z	ck2	caine	it isn't too hard to put the boot loader back either
2005-06-14T06:12:00.000Z	ck2	caine	but installing win, then Ubuntu is "easiest"
2005-06-14T06:16:00.000Z	ck2	caine	best is to reserve a partition Linux, but if the win Install wipes it out, the Ubuntu Installer will llet you shrink the windows partition
2005-06-14T06:17:00.000Z	ck2	caine	then intall windows however it wants to, and shrink it later
2005-06-14T06:18:00.000Z	ck2	caine	the Ubuntu Installer will llet you shrink the windows partition
