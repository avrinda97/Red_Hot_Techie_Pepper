2007-08-15T14:49:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	Linux can resize partitions upon installing. It's really easy.
2007-08-15T14:49:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	You choose your slave HD, then you can do it guided from there and make sure it does it right from what it gives you.
2007-08-15T14:53:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	Do the slave.
2007-08-15T14:53:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	What's next?

2007-08-15T14:57:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	On the slave, I think. I have to look at the install screen to know for sure.
2007-08-15T14:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	Right.
2007-08-15T14:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	Did you choose the manual partitioning option?
2007-08-15T14:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	jimm	Okay then choose your slave and see what it says next.
