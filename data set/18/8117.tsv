2010-08-04T10:11:00.000Z	alesan		is there a way to see if a specific file belongs to a package?
2010-08-04T10:11:00.000Z	alesan		for example, /usr/lib32/libgphoto2/2.4.8/ptp2.so
2010-08-04T10:13:00.000Z	alesan		ia32-libs has /usr/lib32/libgphoto2/2.4.8/ptp2.so ??? and the whole /usr/lib32/libgphoto2 in general??
2010-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	alesan		Shuttleworth is the guy that went to the space???
2010-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	alesan		and Antarctica?

2011-03-16T10:40:00.000Z	bazhang	alesan	check the ppa search page, its completely unsupported and at your own risk however
2011-03-16T10:41:00.000Z	bazhang	alesan	its at launchpad

2011-07-13T08:16:00.000Z	bazhang	alesan	use the name of the program, what version of ubuntu by the way
2011-07-13T08:16:00.000Z	alesan	bazhang	yes, what is the "name of the program?"
2011-07-13T08:16:00.000Z	alesan	bazhang	ubuntu 11.04
2011-07-13T08:16:00.000Z	bazhang	alesan	libreoffice is in 11.04 for example, thus my asking version of ubuntu
2011-07-13T08:17:00.000Z	alesan	bazhang	can I get the rgular openoffice instead of "libreoffice" that sounds south-american?
