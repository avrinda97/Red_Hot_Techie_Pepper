2011-12-18T08:47:00.000Z	mrmj		i need support
2011-12-18T08:48:00.000Z	mrmj		:)
2011-12-18T08:48:00.000Z	mrmj		i tried that but i dont think it works
2011-12-18T08:49:00.000Z	mrmj		then tried the nvidia-96 same result
2011-12-18T08:49:00.000Z	mrmj		says the driver is activated but not currently in use...
2011-12-18T08:50:00.000Z	mrmj		videos play fine in like ubuntu 6 or 8, but lag badly in 11.1 and i think it must be a driver issue
2011-12-18T08:51:00.000Z	mrmj		or is it the unity desktop?
2011-12-18T08:51:00.000Z	mrmj		the computer im using is ancient like 900mz 512 ram
2011-12-18T08:52:00.000Z	mrmj		well i think im on the unity 2d it never had an option for 3d
2011-12-18T08:52:00.000Z	mrmj		is the pc too slow for ubuntu 11.1, is that why my videos lag so bad?
2011-12-18T08:53:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	take a look at the RAM and CPU usage statistics during idle
2011-12-18T08:53:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	i.e., when you're not using the pc
2011-12-18T08:54:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	yes
2011-12-18T08:54:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	no it's in Ubuntu by default. you can enable this at your login screen. Simply click the gear icon, and select Ubuntu 2D
2011-12-18T08:55:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	they are not the same
2011-12-18T08:55:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	in addition to this, you can also use another Window Manager or Desktop Envionment
2011-12-18T08:56:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	most probably
2011-12-18T08:56:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	mrmj	if you are low on resources, Ubuntu 2D uses less resources, leaving more for playing videos and such :)
