2012-08-08T07:53:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	installed windows first then installed ubuntu?  Dual boot NOT wubi?
2012-08-08T07:55:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	and windows appears in the grub menu, right?
2012-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	...
2012-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	why would you need to reinstate the mbr ...
2012-08-08T07:58:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	don't know enough about winRE to comment, but normal dual boot requires only that win7 be installed BEFORE ubuntu.  AFter that, absent weird configuration, ubuntu detects win7, configures grub and you're off to the races.
2012-08-08T07:59:00.000Z	hirsty_	cfhowlett	would a bootinfo log help?
2012-08-08T07:59:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	paste the bootlog.  to fix?  As I said, never used winRE.  I'd suggest first boot your windows CDROM and running the repair function.  Yes, this WILL wipe out ubuntu, but then you live boot ubuntu cdrom and reinstall grub.  Fixed.
2012-08-08T08:00:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	ah.  of course.  OK.
2012-08-08T08:01:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	for the record, repairing windows only wipes out Ubuntu bootloading/grub.  Data and systems are still in place.
2012-08-08T08:03:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	indeed it is.
2012-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	Fix the windows boot first, then restore your ubuntu stuff.  I had WinRE but couldn't get any use from it.  The utilities on the win7 disk finally fixed my triple boot.
2012-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	cfhowlett	hirsty_	worst case; reinstall windows.  don't touch the ubuntu partition.  after windows is back, reinstall grub to pick up windows.
