2008-12-21T14:22:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	that's me, previously kanchana, someone is playing with me
2008-12-21T14:22:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	so do you think you could help me?
2008-12-21T14:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	Only if you can explain what your setup is better.
2008-12-21T14:23:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	I didnt understand your question
2008-12-21T14:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	Okay, the DSL bit helps...
2008-12-21T14:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	So you aren't dealing with the modem at all, but an ethernet card.
2008-12-21T14:24:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	probably yes, I think from the http://pastebin.com/m7346a9bf you can get to know, I am a newbie, I dont know.
2008-12-21T14:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	by any chance is the port you're using on a removable card?
2008-12-21T14:28:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	yes, of course. I can remove the card during the run of the Ubuntu system. No problem :-)
2008-12-21T14:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	aaaah, okay.
2008-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	do you have any idea?
2008-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/Thinkpad600E suggests that you will need to use ndiswrapper with the Windows driver and turn ACPI off.  See http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_6.06_on_a_ThinkPad_600E#Get_PCMCIA_to_work and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper.
2008-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	I doubt I'll know much about the details of the process, but that should at least point you in the right direction.
2008-12-21T14:33:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	ndiswrapper? but this is for wireless connection, isnt it? I want to connect by wire...
2008-12-21T14:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	Most people only need it for wireless, but the concept can apply to various sorts of drivers.
2008-12-21T14:34:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	and doesn't it help. that the ethernet card is well recognised in lshw? I found that it was well recognized...
2008-12-21T14:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bhikkhusarana	It's a start, yes, but given that it's not completely working it seems like you'll need to try a few things, unless there's just a totally unrelated issue going on.
2008-12-21T14:37:00.000Z	bhikkhusarana	tonyyarusso	fantastic... so another hours... :/ at least I will learn something more... :/
