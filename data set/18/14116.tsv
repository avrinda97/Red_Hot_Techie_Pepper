2007-03-25T16:27:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	no.  Only 16.  e17 is still a development release, and won't be in the repos.
2007-03-25T16:27:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	bummer
2007-03-29T08:07:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	#winehq is probsbaly your best bet
2007-03-29T08:07:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	my thanks
2007-04-12T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	if youre connecting on the same LAN, why do you have an non-subnet IP?
2007-04-12T10:47:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	that is an excelent question
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	well, how are you choosing what to connect to?
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	the ip that smbmount returns in it's error message is not one from my subnet, and not the ip of the server I'm trying to connect to
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	smbmount //<server>/<share>
2007-04-12T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	and what <server> are you using?
2007-04-12T10:49:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	one called purple, the slackware box
2007-04-12T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	What happens when you put the IP in there?
2007-04-12T10:49:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	it connects fine
2007-04-12T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	so, your issue is with the lookup of purple.  And... well, I have no idea how that works ;)  But at least you know where it is
2007-04-12T10:51:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	that's what I thought, but google isn't being much help.
2007-04-12T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	shnastybiznastic	what about man smbmount?
2007-04-12T10:51:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	Flannel	I hadn't thought of that, I'll check what it says about lookups.  thanks
