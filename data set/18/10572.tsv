2006-11-30T15:38:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	Its similar but much more powerfull
2006-11-30T15:38:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	i cant find info and how to for it...
2006-11-30T15:39:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	system links are files that explorer reads and follows, where as the linux ones are built into the basic file system, so you can systemlink stuff and applications will read the file it points to rather than the systemlink file itself
2006-11-30T15:39:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	If you are ok with the console 'ln -s sourcefile destinationfile', otherwise im sure theres an easy way to do it in nautilus or other filemanagers
2006-11-30T15:41:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	may i create a symlink for my windows drives ? i wanna have a shortcut in my kde desktop
2006-11-30T15:42:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	Yep that should work fine, just make a link to their mount points
2006-11-30T15:43:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	mount point ?  you mean this ? this is my c drive in windows /dev/hda1
2006-11-30T15:44:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	thats the raw device. not the mount point, check in /media
2006-11-30T15:45:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	/media/hda1      is it ok ?
2006-11-30T15:45:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	yep
2006-11-30T15:46:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	sudo ln -s  /media/hda1    /home/user/Desktop     // is it ok ?
2006-11-30T15:47:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	Looks fine to me
2006-11-30T15:48:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	Although the sudo bit is probally not required
2006-11-30T15:50:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	thank you, i created two symlink for my both drives in windows, lastly is it symbolic link or system link ?
2006-11-30T15:51:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	Its a symbolic link because of the -s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link you use it when linking to files on the same device
2006-11-30T15:52:00.000Z	eilker	H3g3m0n	thank you very much
2006-11-30T15:52:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	eilker	nps =)
