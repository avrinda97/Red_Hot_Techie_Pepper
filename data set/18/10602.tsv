2006-11-10T08:22:00.000Z	paul71		did anyone get any of what I just said?
2006-11-10T08:24:00.000Z	paul71		I tried to install 6.06 over my 6.10 system, and the installer doesn't seem to want to work, it gets to 15% and just stops.
2006-11-10T08:24:00.000Z	paul71		does anyone know why?
2006-11-10T08:24:00.000Z	variant	paul71	how long did you wait?
2006-11-10T08:25:00.000Z	paul71	variant	I left it running overnight
2006-11-10T08:25:00.000Z	variant	paul71	did you choose to format all the partitions?
2006-11-10T08:26:00.000Z	paul71	variant	i just chose the wipe disk, and write 6.06 command
2006-11-10T08:26:00.000Z	variant	paul71	automatic parititoning?
2006-11-10T08:27:00.000Z	paul71	variant	um, yeah, i didn't choose to use the partitioner
2006-11-10T08:27:00.000Z	variant	paul71	ok, try booting in to the live cd again and manualy formatting the whole disk, then run the installer again
2006-11-10T08:28:00.000Z	variant	paul71	but as hakrzcode says, you should also runt he disk checker int he startup menu of the live cd
2006-11-10T08:28:00.000Z	variant	paul71	sure
2006-11-10T08:28:00.000Z	variant	paul71	sudo mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda1/2/3
2006-11-10T08:28:00.000Z	variant	paul71	be carefull though
2006-11-10T08:28:00.000Z	variant	paul71	wait
2006-11-10T08:29:00.000Z	variant	paul71	if you have any data on the partiitons that you runt hat command on it will be wiped
2006-11-10T08:30:00.000Z	paul71	variant	so if i don't want to keep any data, i can go ahead and do it?
2006-11-10T08:30:00.000Z	variant	paul71	ye[-
