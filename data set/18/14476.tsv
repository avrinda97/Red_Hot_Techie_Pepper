2007-08-04T10:40:00.000Z	variant	linux_	most applications are added to the gnome menu. those that are not are not packaged correctly, or don't have anything that can be "launched".. like fonts etc
2007-08-04T10:40:00.000Z	variant	linux_	make your own shortcut
2007-08-04T10:41:00.000Z	variant	linux_	in terminal type "which mysql"
2007-08-04T10:42:00.000Z	variant	linux_	so, cd ~ in each of them
2007-08-04T10:57:00.000Z	variant	linux_	click the empty icon in the launcher editor and it will show you a list of options
2007-08-04T11:04:00.000Z	variant	linux_	where are you from?
2007-08-04T11:04:00.000Z	variant	linux_	yes
2007-08-04T11:06:00.000Z	variant	linux_	because your english scentances are not well formed and you would be better off asking your questions in a localised ubuntu channel
2007-08-04T11:08:00.000Z	variant	linux_	tell me what country you come from and i will tell you where to talk to people about your issues in your own language, your english questions are hard for me to understand as you seem to need a bit of practise with the language
2007-08-04T11:09:00.000Z	variant	linux_	more evidence of the rubbish english education system then!
2007-08-04T11:15:00.000Z	variant	linux_	you appear to be from israel
2007-08-04T11:17:00.000Z	variant	linux_	your isp/wherever you are connecting from at least
2007-08-04T11:17:00.000Z	variant	linux_	or the ip owner :)#
2007-08-04T11:18:00.000Z	variant	linux_	try #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-08-04T11:19:00.000Z	variant	linux_	what is your first language?
