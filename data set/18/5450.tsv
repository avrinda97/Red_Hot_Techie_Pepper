2009-12-29T12:01:00.000Z	s00p		how do I tell whether my processor is 64-bit or 32-bit?
2009-12-29T12:01:00.000Z	s00p		is there some sort of hmm... gcc switch that will tell me sizeof(void *)?
2009-12-29T12:01:00.000Z	s00p		ty c3101
2009-12-29T12:02:00.000Z	s00p		I don't see this info there c3101
2009-12-29T12:03:00.000Z	kandjar	s00p	what the model name?
2009-12-29T12:03:00.000Z	s00p		Intel(R) Pentium(R) Dual  CPU  T3200  @ 2.00GHz
2009-12-29T12:04:00.000Z	s00p		I'll just gcc a printf("%u", sizeof(void *))
2009-12-29T12:05:00.000Z	kandjar	s00p	i believe it's a 64b
2009-12-29T12:05:00.000Z	s00p		sizeof(void *) == 4
2009-12-29T12:06:00.000Z	kandjar	s00p	that wont be necessary right :)
2009-12-29T12:06:00.000Z	s00p		meh, I know :(
2009-12-29T12:06:00.000Z	kandjar		if it said 8 that would have solved the problem :)
2009-12-29T12:06:00.000Z	s00p		what will happen if I install 64-bit drivers on a 32-bit FreeBSD platform?
2009-12-29T12:07:00.000Z	s00p		yeh that's what I was hoping for
2009-12-29T12:07:00.000Z	s00p	mechcozmo	lol I know... but... will it kill my system? D:
2009-12-29T12:08:00.000Z	kandjar	s00p	http://processorfinder.intel.com/DetailsPrinterFriendly.aspx?sSpec=SLAVG
2009-12-29T12:09:00.000Z	s00p		yes kandjar I checked that
2009-12-29T12:10:00.000Z	kandjar	s00p	and ur not convinced?
