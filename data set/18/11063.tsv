2006-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	SpudDogg		Does anyone here know if it is possible to stream movies from a windows share in ubuntu?  Is there a particular movie player I need for that?
2006-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	VLC works pretty well for streaming video cross-platform
2006-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	 Isn't VLC for remote desktop?
2006-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	Nope that's VNC

2006-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	 Ahh, ok...Sorry, lol
2006-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	 Thanks man
2006-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	No problem :)
2006-09-27T06:35:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	I have, it's a pretty cool live CD but I was a huge fan of Whax and Whoppix too. backtrack is better
2006-09-27T06:36:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	 My concern is that I'll need to update drivers, etc for my wireless devices.  How is that done when just running on a livedisc?  Maybe it has everything you need for the most common devices? Atheros, Ralink, etc?
2006-09-27T06:37:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	actuall backtrack is based of Slax which has a really easy way of adding files to the livecd check out the slax website for how to add custom modules
2006-09-27T06:37:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	well, I'm just going to burn the disc and get a feel for it.  If I like the way things work, I'll work on using it.
2006-09-27T06:38:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	not a bad idea, I'm using it for a USB/QEMU stick computer when I travel to Japan
2006-09-27T06:38:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	 Also, is there a way to install the distro?  Maybe on another partition?
2006-09-27T06:38:00.000Z	Gekitsuu	SpudDogg	I'm not sure I don't think I ever tried it
2006-09-27T06:39:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	yea, I've never tried dual-booting linux and linux, lol
2006-09-27T06:39:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	I guess that your be kinda dumb to do...I would imagine most things I can do in backtrack can be done in Ubuntu...Maybe just a little easier?
2006-09-27T06:40:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Gekitsuu	sorry i meant to say that would be kinda dumb...
