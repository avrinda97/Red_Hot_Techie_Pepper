2010-11-11T00:10:00.000Z	r3in		hey,
2010-11-11T00:10:00.000Z	r3in		sorry to bother you guys
2010-11-11T00:11:00.000Z	r3in		I seem to be having a problem with using multiple wlan adapters in ubuntu 8.10. I can use one adapter, with no problem (doesnt matter which) and configure the second, but cannot connect with it
2010-11-11T00:11:00.000Z	r3in		I have tried on three Pcs in different order
2010-11-11T00:11:00.000Z	r3in		and cant figure it out on any
2010-11-11T00:12:00.000Z	r3in		but on 10, they work fine
2010-11-11T00:12:00.000Z	r3in		any suggestions/help wouldbe greatly appreciated
2010-11-11T00:13:00.000Z	r3in		belive me, If I thought that was a solution, I would of already :P
2010-11-11T00:14:00.000Z	adrian15	r3in	So you want to use two wlan adapters at the same time ?
2010-11-11T00:15:00.000Z	r3in	adrian15	correct
2010-11-11T00:15:00.000Z	adrian15	r3in	And network-manager switchs off one adapter when connecting to the other one ? Or how?
2010-11-11T00:16:00.000Z	r3in		only use console,
2010-11-11T00:16:00.000Z	r3in		in 10, it works fine though
2010-11-11T00:16:00.000Z	r3in		(no network manager) iw, iwconfig, and dhclient3
2010-11-11T00:17:00.000Z	adrian15	r3in	You do not use graphical interface in any way ?
2010-11-11T00:18:00.000Z	r3in	adrian15	on that box, and on the others (using a livecd for test) no
2010-11-11T00:19:00.000Z	adrian15	r3in	You might have installed an alternate ubuntu instead of a server edition one. I recommend you to uninstall network-manager package to avoid any misterious problem
2010-11-11T00:19:00.000Z	r3in	adrian15	sorry, thought stated before, am using BT with a patched 8.10 kernel
