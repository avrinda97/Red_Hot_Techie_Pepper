2008-12-14T15:00:00.000Z	m0t0n`_		what's the best torrent client for ubuntu?
2008-12-14T15:00:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	what kind of experiene do you want?
2008-12-14T15:01:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	do you want a minimalistic, highly configurable, command-line client
2008-12-14T15:01:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	do you want...azureus (aka meth lab)
2008-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww
2008-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	it uses way too many resources in my experience, java is ew...
2008-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	and az devs don't really agree with ubuntu devs
2008-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	someone in #ubuntu-devel explained recently
2008-12-14T15:04:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	rtorrent is a nice cli client :D
2008-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	of course. but vlc is bleh
2008-12-14T15:10:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	i'd recommend trying mplayer first. if you don't like the cli, try one of the many guis
2008-12-14T15:15:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	sigh.
2008-12-14T15:16:00.000Z	raylu	m0t0n`_	vlc uses its own decoders, so i don't recommend it
