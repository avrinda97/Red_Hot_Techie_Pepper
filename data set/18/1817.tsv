2010-11-05T02:32:00.000Z	photofroggy		how do I turn on network discovery? There are machines on the network that I can't see and they can't see me either
2010-11-05T02:34:00.000Z	nothingspecial	photofroggy	all linux, or some others?
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	What?
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	oh, mainly windows
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	I'm the only one on Linux
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	I can see one other computer, that's it
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	nothingspecial	photofroggy	all your computers - linux or some windows, mac .....
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	nothingspecial	photofroggy	Ah I see
2010-11-05T02:35:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	I reckon it could be something to do with workgroup settings on the windows machine but I dunno
2010-11-05T02:36:00.000Z	nothingspecial	photofroggy	no nothing of windows, sorry
2010-11-05T02:36:00.000Z	nothingspecial		no >> know
2010-11-05T02:36:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	well, know anything about an easy way to turn network discovery on/off?
2010-11-05T02:37:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	googling it gives me loads of stuff about installing random crap
2010-11-05T02:37:00.000Z	photofroggy		tbh there should be something that comes with ubuntu
2010-11-05T02:37:00.000Z	photofroggy		it seems like a basic thing
2010-11-05T02:37:00.000Z	nothingspecial	photofroggy	My netbook sees all my machines, have you tried ssh?
2010-11-05T02:38:00.000Z	photofroggy	nothingspecial	? nope
2010-11-05T02:38:00.000Z	nothingspecial	photofroggy	I believe that works with windows
