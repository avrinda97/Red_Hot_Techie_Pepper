2005-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	can you load any other terminal?
2005-08-05T11:44:00.000Z	skalpel	gradzac	yes, i can use xterm
2005-08-05T11:44:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	start an xterm, type "gnome-terminal" and see if it gives you any error messages
2005-08-05T11:45:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	same result?
2005-08-05T11:46:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	not much I can tell you unless you can supply and error message or something
2005-08-05T11:46:00.000Z	skalpel	gradzac	it started after i turned transparency on
2005-08-05T11:47:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	turn transparency off?
2005-08-05T11:51:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	you said your problem started after you turned on transparency, right?
2005-08-05T11:51:00.000Z	skalpel	gradzac	yes
2005-08-05T11:52:00.000Z	skalpel	gradzac	i turned it off and it still closes
2005-08-05T11:52:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	do you have any other profiles you could use that don't have transparency enabled?

2005-08-05T11:55:00.000Z	gradzac	skalpel	glad to hear it, what did you change?
2005-08-05T11:55:00.000Z	skalpel	gradzac	i had gradzac: i just had 'run a custom command instead of shell' turned on
