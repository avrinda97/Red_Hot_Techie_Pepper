2005-04-20T05:17:00.000Z	vessuvius81		cool
2005-04-20T05:17:00.000Z	vessuvius81		thnx Flonne
2005-04-20T05:19:00.000Z	vessuvius81		is it a bad idea to format /boot as fat32? I want to be able to copy the first 512 of it for a dual boot system, and I don't want to have to try to get it with a rescue disk
2005-04-20T05:19:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	why do u need to format as vfat for dual boot?
2005-04-20T05:20:00.000Z	vessuvius81	roo_	I don't need to... but I need to get the first 512 off of /boot to give to ntldr so it will load ubuntu
2005-04-20T05:21:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	ah. so why not use Grub to load ntldr/windows?
2005-04-20T05:21:00.000Z	vessuvius81	roo_	because I never found a good how-to on that... I've found one and worked one for starting with ntldr
2005-04-20T05:22:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	its trivially easy, Ubuntu does it all automagically if u tell it to install grub.
2005-04-20T05:22:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	yes, it does :)
2005-04-20T05:22:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	dont feel too worried about installing Grub onto the MBR either, ive done that since my linux time began  and its never caused me a problem.
2005-04-20T05:23:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	usual disclaimers apply tho :)
2005-04-20T05:23:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	yep.
2005-04-20T05:24:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	it'll auto detect windows and Ubuntu, u dont have to do anything.
2005-04-20T05:24:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	u'll be presented with a nice grub menu
2005-04-20T05:25:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	try it using the install cd. if it doesnt detect, just ESC out and look at solutions. but it'll detect it; trust me :)
2005-04-20T05:37:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	:D
2005-04-20T05:37:00.000Z	roo_	vessuvius81	grub++
