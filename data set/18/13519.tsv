2005-11-09T12:36:00.000Z	ahoora		but what about libraries like conio.h and others does it accept them by default?
2005-11-09T12:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	that depends on you
2005-11-09T12:37:00.000Z	ahoora	thoreauputic	do you knowo any good online source for starters? i have started with linux.org lessons
2005-11-09T12:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	how much you learn and how fast depends on your effort
2005-11-09T12:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	for basic commands try http://tuxfiles.org
2005-11-09T12:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	if you are planning to stick with ubuntu or debian google for "apt howto" or install the  apt-howto package
2005-11-09T12:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	if you install that package and run the command  apt-howto it will open in a browser
2005-11-09T13:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	rather the reverse
2005-11-09T14:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	 build-essential  actually
2005-11-09T14:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	maybe you would get more help in a C++ channel
2005-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ahoora	pay attention to the ops :)
