2008-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	hatter		dns has one purpose, map human readable names to ip addresses
2008-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	hatter		no an internet dns does not resolve a name to an internet non-routable address
2008-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	hatter		that is not the point
2008-02-21T09:59:00.000Z	hatter		the point is, he is trying to get to his router via an ip address
2008-02-21T09:59:00.000Z	hatter		to which, dns has no part
