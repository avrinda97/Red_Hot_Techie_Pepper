2007-05-30T12:21:00.000Z	HardDisk	HKJGN	lovely :) well you can reconfigure your gfx again in terminal, and then see what the problem is, OR if you have an older kernel installed boot into that from grub.
2007-05-30T12:22:00.000Z	HKJGN	HardDisk	nope, its not my xorg.conf file, already looked at that, and i dont have an older kernel
