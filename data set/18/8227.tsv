2008-04-28T04:46:00.000Z	xubean		wyzard: oh ok.. so how can i free up space in "/" ? i try to remove old packages? from synaptic package remover?
2008-04-28T04:46:00.000Z	xubean		wyzard: but I've already removed as much as i can!
2008-04-28T04:47:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	try apt-get autoclean
2008-04-28T04:47:00.000Z	xubean		pelo: just delete stuff from there?
2008-04-28T04:47:00.000Z	xubean	MarcN	I did do autoclean, but I need to cleanup 450 mb, and not just a few mbs
2008-04-28T04:48:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	do you have the development tools installed?  Remove them and add them afer upgrading.  KDE too if you have it installed.
2008-04-28T04:49:00.000Z	xubean		marcn: oh yeah, i could remove kde i guess... what's the command for that, if you know that?
2008-04-28T04:50:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	Try: dpkg --list |grep kde   and then apt-get remove kde or kde-base or whatever
2008-04-28T04:53:00.000Z	xubean		marcN: thanks a lot man, I think that's gonna work for me
2008-04-28T04:54:00.000Z	xubean		marcn: i still can't upgrade, says I need to free an additional 440 m fo disk space on '/'... how do I free space in '/'?
2008-04-28T04:55:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	remove more packages.  Do you have lots of stuff in /var/cache/?
2008-04-28T04:55:00.000Z	xubean		marcn: no.. i don't have anything!!!
2008-04-28T04:55:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	dpkg --list|grep ^ii | wc -l      gives what?
2008-04-28T04:56:00.000Z	xubean		marcn: 1897
2008-04-28T04:57:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	I have ~2k packages in ~5.6G on /   My /home is elsewhere
2008-04-28T04:58:00.000Z	xubean		marcn: sorry, and that means?
2008-04-28T04:58:00.000Z	xubean		marcn: as far as i know, my home is elsewhere in /home as well..
2008-04-28T04:59:00.000Z	MarcN	xubean	how much disk is used on your / ?  I have ~2000 packaegs which consume ~5.6G of space. I could remove the dev tools to make it smaller.
