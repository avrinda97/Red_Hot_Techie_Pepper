2005-05-26T06:12:00.000Z	anto9us	gusto5	doesn't it run from your menu?
2005-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	gusto5	anto9us	it only runs 1.0.2
2005-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	gusto5		the one that comes with 5.04
2005-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	gusto5		ubuntu
2005-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	anto9us		well, I think, there's a simlink in your bin directory, you need to replace it but it's not an exercise I've carried out
2005-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	gusto5		a what?
2005-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	anto9us	gusto5	a shortcut
2005-05-26T06:15:00.000Z	anto9us	gusto5	although, it may run from a script, I'm not sure, there may be further help in the release notes, have you read them?
2005-05-26T06:15:00.000Z	gusto5	anto9us	they confuse me. thats why im here :)
2005-05-26T06:16:00.000Z	anto9us	gusto5	well, if I'd done it I may be able help but I've not bothered upgrading it yet
