2007-09-08T14:39:00.000Z	scguy318	realshiva	not rly, you can add a reg entry to have it use times new roman or somethin
2007-09-08T14:39:00.000Z	realshiva	scguy318	but i think you need it to compilate
2007-09-08T14:40:00.000Z	scguy318	realshiva	you dont need tahoma.ttf for steam, just do the reg patch as documented in Wine AppDb
2007-09-08T14:40:00.000Z	scguy318	realshiva	just add some font substitute reg entry
