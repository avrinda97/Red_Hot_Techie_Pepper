2005-04-30T07:46:00.000Z	Ekaitza		Hello everybody....
2005-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	Ekaitza		I guess you have listened to this question more than once
2005-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	Ekaitza		I have got an Ibook G4 with an airport extreme
2005-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	Ekaitza		Ubuntu works great in it
2005-04-30T07:48:00.000Z	Ekaitza		but although the airport extreme apears in the confuguration it doesn't work
2005-04-30T07:48:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	i'm sorry but it doesn't work with ubuntu
2005-04-30T07:49:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	there are no drivers for it, its a broadcom device
2005-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	the annoying thing is that on a pc broadcom works via ndiswrapper
2005-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	but apparently on ppc this won't work
2005-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	i have a G4 ibook
2005-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	as well
2005-04-30T07:51:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	what i did though to get wireless is to get a cheap usb dongle
2005-04-30T07:51:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	and the drivers work for that
2005-04-30T07:52:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	true, ironically the usb dongle doesn't work in osx
2005-04-30T07:52:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	while the airport does
2005-04-30T07:52:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	i dual boot
2005-04-30T07:52:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	ain't any drivers :)
2005-04-30T07:53:00.000Z	whiteknight	Ekaitza	the usb dongles are seriously cheap 15 (gbp)
