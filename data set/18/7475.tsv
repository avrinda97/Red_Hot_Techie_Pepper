2008-01-04T00:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	Is this a new install
2008-01-04T00:16:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	It could be the res issue Pelo is suggesting, or you might need to use the 'savage' driver
2008-01-04T00:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	To remove the trouble some res from your xorg.
2008-01-04T00:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	Try using the savage driver first
2008-01-04T00:18:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	The .1, .3 are backups, you want xorg.conf
2008-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	mib_ck8hc77C	Yes
