2006-07-28T14:43:00.000Z	J-_		how do i format my NTFS external hard drive to fat32?
2006-07-28T14:44:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	mkfs.vfat
2006-07-28T14:44:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	but try gparted for a nice gui
2006-07-28T14:46:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	not with winxp
2006-07-28T14:46:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	and I would seriously consider another file system
2006-07-28T14:47:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	EXT3, XFS, JFS. EXT3 can be accessed natively on Windows, it works great
2006-07-28T14:52:00.000Z	J-_	sanmarcos	can i ask for your opinion then? all my files are stored on xp currently(did a back up). now i want to format the external hdd to a filesystem so i can use both linux and xp with it. what's the better filesystem to use, since there are valued files in the backed up data.
2006-07-28T14:52:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	as a filesystem FAT32 is very antiquated, but it will work fine. Though Windows XP has some issues with disks >130gb, might want to google
2006-07-28T14:53:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	its either FAT32 or EXT3, I'll go with FAT
2006-07-28T14:53:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	if you want more information, check the Excellent comparison of file systems on the english wikipedia
2006-07-28T15:19:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	if you have fs-driver yes
2006-07-28T15:19:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	if not, it will just say the drive has no formatting, and will ask you to format it, do not..
2006-07-28T15:20:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	for all purposes, fs-driver works great for me. But if you want to be on the safe side, just use vfat
2006-07-28T15:24:00.000Z	J-_	sanmarcos	well, it seems like ext3 has a lot more options than fat32, and linux uses ext3, i just want to format the drive so i can use it with linux, since i'm putting linux on both of my computers, i just need to get onto xp to transfer the files, and possible if i go somewhere and i need to use a windows system, i can use the external drive. i think i'm going to go with ext3, hopefully it's the better choice and the hard drive doesn't go 
2006-07-28T15:24:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	well if you are going to use the external as a travel drive. I would suggest FAT32
2006-07-28T15:25:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	or even, just make a small 100mb parittion of FAT32 to store fs-driver in there, or some other windows file
2006-07-28T15:28:00.000Z	J-_	sanmarcos	thanks for the information, much appreciated.
2006-07-28T15:28:00.000Z	sanmarcos	J-_	sure man, any time
