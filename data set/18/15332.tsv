2005-04-10T15:00:00.000Z	topyli	libben	you're going to have to go to nvidia pages to fetch them if you want the latest
2005-04-10T15:01:00.000Z	topyli	libben	while you're at it, tell them how much you appreciate their work for the free software community
2005-04-10T15:01:00.000Z	libben	topyli	 well yeah =) but how do i update it easy ? =) read something about modprobe or something.. im totally new to this =) except i know around installing debian and playing with the files and doing alot MAN and everything except getting X =)
2005-04-10T15:02:00.000Z	topyli	libben	i always buy matrox cards, i cannot answer questions such as yours :)
2005-04-10T15:02:00.000Z	topyli	libben	at work, they gave me a box with an ati card, and it's pure hell
2005-04-10T15:04:00.000Z	topyli	libben	i bet you can get a decent refresh rate with the drivers that you can get from hoary restricted-area
2005-04-16T15:01:00.000Z	topyli	libben	i use it all the time
2005-04-16T15:09:00.000Z	topyli	libben	same here :)
