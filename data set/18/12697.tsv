2006-03-24T14:13:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	don worry about lost+found
2006-03-24T14:13:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	in extreme cases of crashes
2006-03-24T14:13:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	there is the place where the files restored are moved
2006-03-24T14:14:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	yes... that is the good answer
2006-03-24T14:14:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	But he wants to show to you that change is permanent :)
2006-03-24T14:21:00.000Z	DBO	ciplogic	should I chown the new drive to my user, or should I just chown specific directories?
2006-03-24T14:22:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	you should specify for every file: chown -R dbo.dbo
2006-03-24T14:25:00.000Z	ciplogic	DBO	wait to answer to sledge
