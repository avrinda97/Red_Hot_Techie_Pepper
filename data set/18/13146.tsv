2010-05-26T21:13:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		I got ubuntu 9.04 and I've seen theres wine 1.2 rc1 out, but I have no idea how to install it
2010-05-26T21:13:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		I have an older version in the repositories
2010-05-26T21:14:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		so no wine 1.2 for 9.04 ?
2010-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		because of improved 3d support. need to get sculptris running
2010-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		a sculpting programm
2010-05-26T21:16:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		and I can't switch to 10.04 coz its freakn unstable right now
2010-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		yaI know I updated mysources for repos, but all I get is an older version
2010-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		and they say wine 1.2 rc1 for 9.10 and 10.04 so Im confused
2010-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		10.04 freezes all the time on my machine. its a confirmed bug. so not yet ;)
2010-05-26T21:18:00.000Z	ubuntuChick		had similar probs with 9.10. 9.04 seems rock solid
