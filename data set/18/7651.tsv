2010-05-04T05:35:00.000Z	MikeH_		out of curiosity
2010-05-04T05:35:00.000Z	MikeH_		what do I need to run after updating grub config?
2010-05-04T05:37:00.000Z	MikeH_		what the hell
2010-05-04T05:37:00.000Z	MikeH_		where has menu.lst gone in 10.4?
2010-05-04T05:39:00.000Z	MikeH_		apparently what would normally be in menu.lst should be in .etc/default/grub yet theres nno entries?
2010-05-04T05:40:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	Actually, Grub2 is quite nice, if you check out the wiki, you'll see the menu list is generated and uses defaults and things you change in /etc/default/grub and then there are other ways to customize the entries
2010-05-04T05:40:00.000Z	MikeH_	h00k	I want to add vga= to kernel params
2010-05-04T05:40:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	you can do that!
2010-05-04T05:41:00.000Z	MikeH_	h00k	I've yet to find my default entry yet?!
2010-05-04T05:41:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	in /etc/default/grub, check line 8
2010-05-04T05:42:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	you can add that to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
2010-05-04T05:42:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	you should see 'quiet splash' there right now, you can just add more stuffs after that
2010-05-04T05:43:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	once you do that, do sudo update-grub and it will generate a new grub menu
2010-05-04T05:44:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	so, that line would look like blablabla="quiet splash VGA=yourptionshere"
2010-05-04T05:44:00.000Z	MikeH_	h00k	yeah. done that, just rebooting now to see
2010-05-04T05:44:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	you can
2010-05-04T05:45:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#User-defined%20Entries
2010-05-04T05:45:00.000Z	h00k	MikeH_	did you do a sudo update-grub after?
