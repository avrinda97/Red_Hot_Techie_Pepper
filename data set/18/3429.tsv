2010-03-24T03:41:00.000Z	EruditeHermit		hey, does anyone know of an up to date ffmpeg ppa?
2010-03-24T03:42:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	the medibuntu ppa
2010-03-24T03:43:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	they seem to have only ffmpeg 0.5.1 which I am told is a year old
2010-03-24T03:43:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	hmm let me check that
2010-03-24T03:44:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	 .5.1 was released on march 2nd
2010-03-24T03:44:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	here is the official link http://ffmpeg.org/
2010-03-24T03:45:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	according to the guys in #ffmpeg it was a bugfix release of 0.5.0 which was released a year ago. Therefore none of the changes that occurred in the master tree are in there
2010-03-24T03:45:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-0.5.1.release
2010-03-24T03:45:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	apparently i need to dig deeper lol *rolls up sleeves*
2010-03-24T03:47:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	you are correct but from what i see no other release has been made since .5.1 so that is the most current
2010-03-24T03:48:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	true, but I think that is the only release ffmpeg has ever made. I think they are a project that doesn't release much so people are expected to use svn
2010-03-24T03:49:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	atleast for the codec I want, I need ffmpeg newer than 09/2009
2010-03-24T03:49:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	darn if that's the case it may be difficult to track down the "real" current i'll explore some code sites
2010-03-24T03:49:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	atleast thats what the ffmpeg guys told me. So I was trying to find a way not to have to compile it myself
2010-03-24T03:50:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	just to explain my predicament. Thanks for helping me, I appreciate it a lot btw.
2010-03-24T03:50:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	according to launchpad the latest for karmic was rolled 10/13/2009, and for lucid was 3/4/2010
2010-03-24T03:52:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Mage__	yeah but the wrong branch of their tree. 0.5.1 is a bugfix release of 0.5 which is march 3 2009. 09/2009 or newer of MASTER is what I am looking for
2010-03-24T03:53:00.000Z	Mage__	EruditeHermit	i think your best option would be to probably just dowload the code from there repository on the site and compile it.  Since everything i am seeing is the .5.1
