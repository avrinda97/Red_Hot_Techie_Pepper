2010-02-25T01:30:00.000Z	jolaren		Greetings. I have a Hauppage wintv nova-t 500 pci card.. and by default ubuntu loads the 1.20 driver, how can I make it stop using that driver and instead use the older one?
2010-02-25T01:31:00.000Z	jolaren		If anyone knows the answer to my question I'd be very glad
2010-02-25T01:32:00.000Z	jolaren		How do I uninstall a driver provided by the KERNEL? I want to use an older driver because this is buggy as hell
2010-02-25T01:33:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	the drivers are part of the kernel, what you want to do is blacklist a module
2010-02-25T01:33:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	if I roll back to a older driver and the module is blacklisted - what happends?
2010-02-25T01:34:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	I am not sure what you mean by "older driver" can you be more specific
2010-02-25T01:34:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	There's a driver for my hauppage card which is verison 1.20 I want to use version 1.10
2010-02-25T01:38:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	did you manually install this driver or did it ship with ubuntu.  I have 3 hauppauge cards collecting dust, it has been a couple of years since I have used them
2010-02-25T01:38:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	I did not manually install the 1.20 driver, it comes by default with ubuntu
2010-02-25T01:41:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	what is the module name used?
2010-02-25T01:42:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	I don't know, how do I look?
2010-02-25T01:43:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	I seem to remember the hauppauge drivers being called iv<something>.  What do you get when you type "lsmod |grep iv"
2010-02-25T01:44:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	i belive this is the module - dvb-usb-dib0700-1.20
2010-02-25T01:44:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	that does not look like a module name, try "lsmod |grep dvb"
2010-02-25T01:45:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	dvb_usb_dib0700 and alot of dif who look alike but that's the most common
2010-02-25T01:46:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	btw iv doesnt give me anythin
2010-02-25T01:48:00.000Z	meganerd	jolaren	then whatever you had before.  The hauppauge cards I have are all PCI and are all a few years old
2010-02-25T01:48:00.000Z	jolaren	meganerd	I see, mine is also pci aja
