2010-02-20T11:00:00.000Z	tm512		i need to get it on the internet for dhcp
2010-02-20T11:01:00.000Z	tm512		i need to ssh into this laptop
2010-02-20T11:01:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	install openssh on the laptop
2010-02-20T11:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	what do you mean "card"? ssh is not tied to a card
2010-02-20T11:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	the problem is not with ssh, first get your ethernet card working, go fix your ethernet card then come back and ask away
2010-02-20T11:08:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	is it internal or external ethernet card?  what machine do you have? name and model please
2010-02-20T11:10:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	youre going to have a good time trying to figure that one out them, sorry i wont be much help with your pcmcia card, keep asking again, this time mention your pcmcia manufactuer and model, if i find something in the forum ill let you know
2010-02-20T11:15:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	the only solutionI found requires you to compile the driver intot he kernel
2010-02-20T11:15:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	have you tried booting up to your laptop with the pcmcia plugged in?
2010-02-20T11:19:00.000Z	mezquitale	tm512	do not despair, I suggest you open a thread in the forum, since it's an old card then most likely youll find someone who can help you
