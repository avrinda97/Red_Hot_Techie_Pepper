2007-03-24T14:23:00.000Z	zoli21		Hi! Is there an apache 2.2 bacport for edgy?
2007-03-24T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	nope
2007-03-24T14:25:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	if you want apache 2.2 you'll have to (possibly wait to) upgrade to Feisty.
2007-03-24T14:26:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	I built a usb distro based on edgy, it is not so easy uprgrade everything and apache 2.0 doesn't work if I run it on the live usb.
2007-03-24T14:27:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	Why doesn't apache work?  What makes you think 2.2 will?
2007-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	If I request files from apache2 on the server side i got that everything is tranfared but on the other site data with zero length is received.
2007-03-24T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	and what makes you think 2.2 would fix that?
2007-03-24T14:29:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	some types of files are transferred (php, gif) and som not (jpg,png)
2007-03-24T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	sounds like a misconfiguration, not a versioning thing.  If it is a bug, file a bug, and Im sure it'll get fixed.
2007-03-24T14:30:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	I am not sure if it will fix something, but I tried almost everything.
2007-03-24T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	If you can be sure it's a bug (ask in #apache, they might be able to figure out whats going on), file a bug report on launchpad.net, and it'll get fixed.
2007-03-24T14:30:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	I am sure that a bug for a derived distro is not acceptable
2007-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	Well, if it's something you did, then presumably, when you upgrade to Feisty, you'll do the same thing.  Why dont you just fix whatever you broke?
2007-03-24T14:32:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	With clean installation i got the same error
2007-03-24T14:32:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	and I am unable to locate the source of the problem
2007-03-24T14:33:00.000Z	Flannel	zoli21	if, with a clean install you get the same error, then it's a bug.
2007-03-24T14:33:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	Ok, I write a submission on launchpad
2007-03-24T14:47:00.000Z	zoli21	Flannel	I have found the solution, the apache is unable to read files from UnionFS with default configuration :) yes, it is a bug :)
