2012-10-10T02:41:00.000Z	_alpha_		I tried purging xserver-xorg and then reinstalling that and ubuntu-desktop
2012-10-10T02:41:00.000Z	_alpha_		do I need to do some other packages as well?
2012-10-10T02:41:00.000Z	_alpha_		yes
2012-10-10T02:42:00.000Z	_alpha_		or whatever the default is
2012-10-10T02:43:00.000Z	schultza	_alpha_	who is the owner (user:group) of the file .Xauthority in the user who's graphic session is crashing?
2012-10-10T02:43:00.000Z	_alpha_	schultza	seems to be root owned, should it be owned by the user?
2012-10-10T02:44:00.000Z	_alpha_		hmm on this machine it is owned by the user, I'll try switching that
2012-10-10T02:45:00.000Z	schultza	_alpha_	Yes
2012-10-10T02:45:00.000Z	schultza	_alpha_	$ chown user:user .Xauthority
2012-10-10T02:46:00.000Z	schultza		from root of course.. .you may need to use sudo or sudo su -
2012-10-10T02:46:00.000Z	_alpha_		it works!
2012-10-10T02:47:00.000Z	_alpha_		I'm in now with that fixed, thanks both
2012-10-10T02:47:00.000Z	_alpha_		that must have got messed up by one of my earlier attempts
2012-10-10T02:47:00.000Z	schultza		 /ʊˈbuːntʊ/ (using IPA) is how you pronounce ubuntu
2012-10-10T02:47:00.000Z	_alpha_		found something online that suggested running startx from the recovery console (as root), guess that was a bad idea
2012-10-10T02:48:00.000Z	_alpha_		and is it true that nvidia optimus is the root cause of all problems?
2012-10-10T02:48:00.000Z	_alpha_		as it's causing me some grief on this machine
2012-10-10T02:48:00.000Z	schultza	_alpha_	thats what i did.. and how i corrected it after hours of research
