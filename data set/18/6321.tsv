2008-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	arab-boy		one more question please, how do i view my ubuntu from Windows? I am on a dual boot.
2008-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	arab-boy		my Ubuntu files*
2008-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	read only (don't need write)?
2008-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	what do u mean? :)
2008-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	that would be fine, read and write into my files, but how? please? :)
2008-05-24T10:43:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	I'm not sure if there is any ways of writing without losing permissions, but if you want to just view there is Linux Reader by diskinternals. (assuming you're using ext3)
2008-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	there is a driver for ext3 but it messes up the permissions
2008-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	am i going to loose the permissions even if i got my windows repaired?
2008-05-24T10:45:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	I missed part of the earlier conversation. please explain. Are you trying to work with linux files out of windows or the other way around?
2008-05-24T10:46:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	yes, view my linux files from windows environment. I know how to read my windows ( Documents) from hardy
2008-05-24T10:46:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	what did you mean even if you get your windows repaired?
2008-05-24T10:48:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	I mean, if my Windows crashes, this will mess up with my files.. right? but repairing windows is going to fix the issue again? am I right. sorry I am kinda new into this.
2008-05-24T10:49:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	I meant that if you use the windows ext2/ext3 driver you lose the access permissions on the linux files you modify. (such as read only to all but root)
2008-05-24T10:49:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	ah, ok ok
2008-05-24T10:49:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	if you just want to look, but not change, explore2fs or linux reader can help.
2008-05-24T10:53:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	& nickrud: http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/ (linux reader, stand alone program) or http://www.chrysocome.net/explore2fs (explore2fs, integrates into explorer)
2008-05-24T10:54:00.000Z	arab-boy	bombuxp	hey thanks. lemmes have a look :)
2008-05-24T10:55:00.000Z	bombuxp	arab-boy	no problem
