2010-09-02T18:15:00.000Z	lestat		is it possible when you boot up from the livecd to copy all the livecd in ram, so that you can remove the cdrom and for example burn a cdrom from here ?
2010-09-02T18:16:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 not that I am aware of ...the entire live cd is not copied over to ram when running it  I dont think
2010-09-02T18:17:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 the other option is the minimal install cd ...however.. what is it you want to do ?
2010-09-02T18:19:00.000Z	lestat	coz_	i need to burn a cd, but the only burner i have is on a computer with no OS yet
2010-09-02T18:19:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 oh
2010-09-02T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	  mm   well you could try it with live cd  although I have never done this ...download the iso you want  ...depending on the amount of memory you have,,  and maybe try to burn it
2010-09-02T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	  this iso is not another ubuntu disk  ...yes?
2010-09-02T18:21:00.000Z	lestat	coz_	no it's not, my problem is i have only one cd player
2010-09-02T18:21:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 ok... do you know how large the iso you want to download is?
2010-09-02T18:21:00.000Z	lestat	coz_	around 700MB
2010-09-02T18:22:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 ok and ubuntu live cd may take up half of that
2010-09-02T18:22:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 it may work... but the only way to find out is to try it :)
2010-09-02T18:22:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 remember that the burn itselft is going to create a temp file also
2010-09-02T18:23:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 I would attempt it and see :)
2010-09-02T18:23:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	  is this system capable of booting from  usb??
2010-09-02T18:24:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 that would be noted in the bios hopefully,,,if so you could ...while running live cd ...download a very tiny linux like damnsmall linux if they have it for usb and go from there
2010-09-02T18:24:00.000Z	lestat	coz_	yup at worst i'll do that
2010-09-02T18:25:00.000Z	coz_	lestat	 again ,,, I have not attempted this but would be interesting with a smaller footprint linux from usb to see if it works
