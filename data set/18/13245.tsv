2009-04-01T02:13:00.000Z	clam		yeah nvidia-xconfig did not work
2009-04-01T02:13:00.000Z	clam		man i hate linux >_<
2009-04-01T02:13:00.000Z	markl_	clam	what are you trying to do?
2009-04-01T02:14:00.000Z	markl_	clam	what card is it, and what do you mean by "initialize"
2009-04-01T02:14:00.000Z	markl_	clam	which nvidia card is it?
2009-04-01T02:15:00.000Z	markl_	clam	wow i would expect that one to be supported by now :)
2009-04-01T02:17:00.000Z	markl_	clam	did you install nvidia-glx
2009-04-01T02:17:00.000Z	markl_	clam	ideally it would help if we could see your Xorg log file
2009-04-01T02:18:00.000Z	markl_	clam	/var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-04-01T02:19:00.000Z	markl_	clam	the first thing to look for is if it detects the card, e.g. mine says (II) NVIDIA(0): NVIDIA GPU Quadro FX 1500M (G71GL) at PCI:1:0:0 (GPU-0)
2009-04-01T02:21:00.000Z	markl_	clam	not sure, maybe start by just grepping the lines with NVIDIA in them
2009-04-01T02:22:00.000Z	markl_	clam	grep NVIDIA /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-04-01T02:28:00.000Z	markl_	clam	can you do the same with your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-04-01T02:28:00.000Z	markl_	clam	you should see a line that says something like     Driver         "nvidia"
2009-04-01T02:35:00.000Z	markl_	clam	that is a weird problem, the PCI looks right
2009-04-01T02:36:00.000Z	markl_	clam	there is always a way to fix it.  you may want to try joining #nvidia, and save those pastebin addresses
2009-04-01T02:36:00.000Z	markl_	clam	those guys can tell you for sure if there is an incompatibility
2009-04-01T02:37:00.000Z	markl_	clam	cool, good luck
