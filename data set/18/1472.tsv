2011-02-07T21:55:00.000Z	LIJI1		Or a virtualization software
2011-02-07T21:56:00.000Z	LIJI1		Where can I get support for Ubuntu?
2011-02-07T21:56:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	LIJI1	Here.  That's kinda th epoint.
2011-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	LIJI1		No one seems to answer
2011-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	LIJI1		Neither here nor the forums
2011-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	LIJI1	Patience is a virtue.  Have you attempted disabling ACPI?
2011-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	LIJI1		How do I do this?
2011-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	LIJI1	And when rebooted, does the system log or dmesg show anything diagnostically useful?
2011-02-07T21:58:00.000Z	LIJI1		After the message appears, I push the power button and the machine continues as if it woke up
2011-02-07T21:58:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	LIJI1	I'd also poke around in Launchpad and see if anyone else has reported this issue.
2011-02-07T21:59:00.000Z	LIJI1		I've seen other issues related to this message, but they didn't have anything to do with not being able to sleep
2011-02-07T21:59:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	LIJI1	Time to start poking around in dmesg.  And google disabling ACPI, I forget the exact kernel string you have to pass it.
2011-02-07T21:59:00.000Z	KB1JWQ		!acpi
2011-02-07T21:59:00.000Z	KB1JWQ		Bah, ubottu's striking out today.
2011-02-07T22:00:00.000Z	LIJI1		I'll google it, thanks
2011-02-07T22:20:00.000Z	LIJI1	KB1JWQ	Disabled ACPI (I think I did) and I still get the same message
