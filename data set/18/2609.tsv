2010-04-07T06:30:00.000Z	gdory		seriously
2010-04-07T06:30:00.000Z	gdory		i want to TEST ubuntu
2010-04-07T06:30:00.000Z	gdory		not it rape my integrity
2010-04-07T06:30:00.000Z	gdory		lol hmw
2010-04-07T06:31:00.000Z	gdory		sadly to say, windows is performing better than ubuntu atm
2010-04-07T06:31:00.000Z	gdory		im asking a question here
2010-04-07T06:31:00.000Z	gdory		i want to know why ubuntu devs made 9.04+ rape HD's when testing the live cd
2010-04-07T06:32:00.000Z	gdory		a live cd needs no disks, should not touch any disks other than those needed
2010-04-07T06:32:00.000Z	gdory		nothing like that
2010-04-07T06:32:00.000Z	elky	gdory	can you find another word to use that doesn't trivialise that particular assault.
2010-04-07T06:35:00.000Z	elky	gdory	stop using that word.
2010-04-07T06:35:00.000Z	elky	gdory	the latter.
2010-04-07T06:36:00.000Z	elky	gdory	I'm not an ubuntu dev. chastising people here, who are volunteer support givers, isn't going to help any
2010-04-07T06:36:00.000Z	gdory	elky	my point is to the devs
2010-04-07T06:37:00.000Z	elky	gdory	then raise it on the devel lists or in the -devel channel. chastising volunteer support folk isn't helping.
2010-04-07T06:37:00.000Z	gdory	elky	i would have though this channel be filled with devs
2010-04-07T06:37:00.000Z	elky	gdory	why? it's the /support/ channel.
