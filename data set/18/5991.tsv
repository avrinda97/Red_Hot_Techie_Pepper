2008-09-16T10:23:00.000Z	kaiwen		Hi guys, I need help, my gdm and kdm have the wrong resolution for my monitor, and configuring the xorg.conf in /etc/X11 doesn't do anything, even by setting the correct modeline
2008-09-16T10:24:00.000Z	kaiwen		The desktop itself is the correct resolution, just the gdm and kdm isn't
2008-09-16T10:24:00.000Z	iFvwm	kaiwen	delete all resolution higher than your want.
2008-09-16T10:24:00.000Z	iFvwm		in xorg.conf
2008-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	they are
2008-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	iFvwm		del 1280 lines
2008-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	They originally didn't have them
2008-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	iFvwm	kaiwen	you can add yourself
2008-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	that's what I did, but still the same problem
2008-09-16T10:26:00.000Z	iFvwm	kaiwen	if here some higher resolution in xorg.conf? or paste your xorg.conf
2008-09-16T10:27:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	the other computer doesn't have internet access, but let me try one thing and i'll get back to you.
2008-09-16T10:29:00.000Z	kaiwen		lol
2008-09-16T10:30:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	the new intel driver was the problem
2008-09-16T10:30:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	i switch to i810 driver.
2008-09-16T10:30:00.000Z	iFvwm		.
2008-09-16T10:30:00.000Z	kaiwen	iFvwm	now everything is pretty again :D
2008-09-16T10:30:00.000Z	iFvwm		:D
