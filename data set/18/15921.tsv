2005-01-26T14:01:00.000Z	benkong2		I have seen quite a few posts in the forum on the FATAL shpchp and pciehp boot messages but no real solutions. Anyone here know how to get rid of them?
2005-01-26T14:01:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	ignore them
2005-01-26T14:02:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	and it's in the FAQ, add the modules to /etc/hotplug/blacklists
2005-01-26T14:02:00.000Z	benkong2	bob2	that basically was the answer I got from the web search
2005-01-26T14:05:00.000Z	benkong2	bob2	in the FAQ...looking
2005-09-10T11:50:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	so, don't do that
2005-09-10T11:50:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	since 2.6.11 is known broken and not in the supported section of ubuntu
2005-09-10T11:54:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	no, go back to 2.6.10
2005-09-10T11:54:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	one of the many unpleasant things about 2.6.11 is that it has no binary drivers built for it
2005-09-10T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	no...
2005-09-10T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	if you don't know what you're doing, just leave it
2005-09-29T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	no
2005-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	"crud" is a verb?
2005-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	you can make an apache-admin group own the apache config files
2005-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	absolutely not
2005-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	www-data should never own anything
2005-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	if you want a group of people to be able to edit the config files, make a new group, add people to it, then give that group permission to touch the files
2005-10-15T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	benkong2	change the docroot in apache2.conf to that dir then
