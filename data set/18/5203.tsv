2009-01-02T18:24:00.000Z	lesshaste		I am using ipp:localhost

2009-01-02T18:24:00.000Z	lesshaste		I am just using the printing menu in hardy
2009-01-02T18:25:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	you using the IP or hosname?
2009-01-02T18:25:00.000Z	lesshaste	mrwes	I literally put in ipp://localhost into the URI field
2009-01-02T18:26:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	is this printing to a shared printer?
2009-01-02T18:26:00.000Z	lesshaste	mrwes	no it's directly connected by an ethernet cable
2009-01-02T18:27:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	You need to add /Printers/PRINTERNAME
2009-01-02T18:30:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	it's connected to the computer or router via cable?
2009-01-02T18:30:00.000Z	lesshaste	mrwes	directly connected via an ethernet cable
2009-01-02T18:54:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	and if you're using DHCP, you're going to run into problems with the IP not being static
2009-01-02T18:56:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	the printer has a menu correct? I bet you can set the IP from there
2009-01-02T18:56:00.000Z	lesshaste	mrwes	I seem to have the address.
2009-01-02T18:57:00.000Z	lesshaste	mrwes	grr.. I can't ping it!!
2009-04-20T00:00:00.000Z	mrwes	lesshaste	Kung Fu for Ubuntu is a good book too
