2005-12-03T09:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 #ubuntu,#linux,#HotLinuxBabes
2005-12-03T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 gnome has 'gesklets'
2006-04-10T11:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 you are referng to the azureus auto-update feature?
2006-04-10T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 correct - it dont work right.. let me guess.. your menu items/text are gone?
2006-04-10T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 totally close azaurus. make sure its not in the system tray.
2006-04-10T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 and either restart it and see if it works.. or install it on a PER user basis.
2006-04-10T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 or just dont use the auto-update thing. :P
2006-04-10T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 i ment the .azurus config dirs
2006-04-10T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 in the users home dir of course.. with all the other .CONFIGTYPEDIRS
2006-04-10T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 its a CONFIG dir for your user.. uninstalling a program wont search through the users home dirs..
2006-04-10T11:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 there was no need to Uninstall azurus :P that i know of.
2006-04-10T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 try making a new user and starting azarus as that user and see if it works.
2006-04-10T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 that imples that its some config file you need to cleanout/remove
2006-04-10T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 see if theres a .Azarus (or whatever als0)
2006-04-10T11:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	  you deleted that earlier correct?
2006-04-10T11:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	giany911	 could try again i guess also there may be a .java
