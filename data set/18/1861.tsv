2011-01-19T08:44:00.000Z	cryptodira		toshiba satellite, amd64, 10.04 ....  external speakers and earphones WORK.... microphone does not... suggestions?
2011-01-19T08:46:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	go to sound preferences, then input tab, and try changing the "microphone" setting, and ee if you can get it working
2011-01-19T08:51:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	yepper, been there done that... the input level indicators do NOT change/light up....the microphone worked when the machine arrived and had windows* on it... nuked the hd and did fresh install of 10.04... slowly getting things working... sound is ok... microphone not, nor does backlit keyboard work.
2011-01-19T21:37:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	whats it say in "connector"
2011-01-19T21:42:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	what is your sound device, do you know?
2011-01-19T21:43:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	and your sound device?
2011-01-19T21:44:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	hmmmm... realtek... tho i am under the impression that the radeon card also did sound
2011-01-19T21:46:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	look at the "hardware" tab... and what is that set to
2011-01-19T21:48:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	internal audio / 1 output 1 input Analog Stereo duplex... the other choice there is for the HDMI stereo output... internal audio is checked
2011-01-19T21:48:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	what do you have ti set to now?
2011-01-19T21:49:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	settings for that is analog stereo duplex
2011-01-19T21:49:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	i honestly don't know, sounds like your mic is not supported yet, is this a fairly new laptop?
2011-01-19T21:53:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	fairly new toshiba satellite A660D laptop, all AMD 64d,  came with windows 7 which was nuked in a format... 10.04 is the only OS... i have gotten sound to work in both the onboard speakers and earphones.... the backlite screen works... the microphone and the backlit keyboard are the only 2 issues left to fix.
2011-01-19T21:54:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	i dunno.. sometimes hardware support is a little better on the 32bit end, maybe boot a 32bit live cd and see if the mic works?..
2011-01-19T21:56:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	 hmmm... i know the mic works... at least in windows... as did everything else... i do not have  a 32 version of 10.04 and not sure if i have enough d/l capacity left for the month on my wildblue connection... any other suggestions?
2011-01-19T21:57:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	try 10.10 maybe... it's a fairly new laptop, maybe it's supported better in 10.10
2011-01-19T21:58:00.000Z	cryptodira	KM0201	 that would be my next choice... as soon as my d/l numbers for the month drop... being on satellite does have drawbacks.  :)   Thank You for your help.
2011-01-19T21:58:00.000Z	KM0201	cryptodira	no prob, hope it works out
