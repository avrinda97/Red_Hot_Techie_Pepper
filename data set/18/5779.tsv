2009-12-16T17:05:00.000Z	abhi_		iceroot_:ya
2009-12-16T17:06:00.000Z	abhi_		i need a good download manager for ubuntu like IDM
2009-12-16T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	gwget
2009-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	there is no better, or best
2009-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	try them to see what YOU like, then stick with the one YOU like
2009-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	gwget has a gnome frontend
2009-12-16T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	or there jdownloader
2009-12-16T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	its another downloader app
2009-12-16T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	sure does
2009-12-16T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	you are using an OS with LOTS of posibilities and choices
2009-12-16T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	wget is as light as it comes
2009-12-16T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	so find out whats available and try a few rather than relying on strangers to tell you what to think
2009-12-16T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	cool
2009-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	again, there is no best
2009-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	try both see which you like
2009-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	abhi_	with software there is NEVER a best, the differences in user requirements is huge so the best for one will be the worst for another
