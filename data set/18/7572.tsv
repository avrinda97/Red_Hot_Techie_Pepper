2009-02-10T16:59:00.000Z	etfb	ikonia	Where, though?  xorg.conf is a shadow of its former self.

2009-02-10T17:12:00.000Z	etfb	ikonia	Seems to be some kind of bug in the WINS name server lookup (or something like that).

2011-08-19T11:37:00.000Z	etfb	ikonia	I only mislead very very stupid people.

2012-09-21T16:10:00.000Z	etfb	ikonia	have a look at the article on "strong" passwords linked above.  It is dangerously out of date.  Security is an important issue; this channel is giving people the wrong information.
2012-09-21T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	etfb	I don't need to read it thank you
2012-09-21T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	etfb	this channel is for ubuntu support, not generic password cracking, please stop
2012-09-21T16:11:00.000Z	etfb	ikonia	What the -- ?
2012-09-21T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	etfb	sorry, if that's not clear I suggest you join #ubuntu-ops and don't speak in this channel again until it is clear.
2012-09-21T16:11:00.000Z	etfb	ikonia	It looks like you *do* need to read, because you just accused me of discussing a topic that is the diametric opposite of what I was talking about.
