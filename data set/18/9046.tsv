2007-05-16T12:55:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	Either you have only partitons declared adding up to 80G or your bios may not understand drives > 80Gb
2007-05-16T12:58:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	Alls well then
2007-05-16T13:00:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	The bloat could be anyplace, unfortunately. But I usually find a horrible cause of disappearing space is humungous logs
2007-05-16T13:01:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	Usually they are all in /var/log
2007-05-16T13:01:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	(and various subdirs of that)
2007-05-16T13:02:00.000Z	mosibfu	genii	about 750 mb in var. cant be missing 100 gb in there i guess..
2007-05-16T13:04:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	There was some command I previously did to discover the large files but offhand forget atm. May be ls -Rh variation with grep for Gb   or similar
2007-05-16T13:08:00.000Z	mosibfu	genii	stupid me did that in /   i have 450 gb total...
2007-05-16T13:09:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	I'm thinking something like ls -lRSh /<somedir>     that will sort by size
2007-05-16T13:10:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	Be prepared to go have a snooze! ROFL
2007-05-16T13:13:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	My next box will be some dual-core thing. I'm looking at a dual cpu mb which would wourk out to quad core
2007-05-16T13:15:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	I'm still researching :) I like to get a bleeding edge box every 5 yrs then run it to the ground LOL
2007-05-16T13:19:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	Did you find what was chewing up space?
2007-05-16T13:20:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	You could always just pipe the ls results to a file then look with some editor
2007-05-16T13:32:00.000Z	genii	mosibfu	Hah :) Well, good thing you tracked it down anyhow
