2010-06-08T00:46:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	when you say you 'installed the proprietary driver', which one was that?
2010-06-08T00:48:00.000Z	fidormula	nuboon2age	Broadcom B43legacy Wireless driver... it shows up under Hardware Drivers
2010-06-08T00:50:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	did it say anything about fwcutter?
2010-06-08T00:50:00.000Z	fidormula		yes, it says that in the description
2010-06-08T00:51:00.000Z	nuboon2age		Hmmm... the name of the Hardware Drivers program is 'jockey'.  I wonder if jockey succeeded in installation of fwcutter
2010-06-08T00:52:00.000Z	fidormula		well, it says it did
2010-06-08T00:52:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	I've seen that greyed out thing before but I'm not sure what it indicates.
2010-06-08T00:52:00.000Z	fidormula		it indicates that my wireless isn't working properly
2010-06-08T00:53:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	were you connected to the internet (by ethernet) when you ran jockey?
2010-06-08T00:53:00.000Z	fidormula		yes, I certainly was
2010-06-08T00:53:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	that's good because it will have problems if not... so let's see
2010-06-08T00:55:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	I think I would try using ndisgtk to make sure the driver is properly installed (which includes modprobe and blacklisting irrelevant drivers and more)
2010-06-08T00:58:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	the ndisgtk approach will work IF its a proprietary windows driver that you need.  Here's how that approach workehttp://tinyurl.com/2angqpzd for me:
2010-06-08T01:01:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	I guess even before trying ndisgtk I'd just try reinstalling modem-manager.
2010-06-08T01:01:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	Here's a relevant resource: http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43
2010-06-08T01:01:00.000Z	fidormula		oh, OK, I think I can figure that out
2010-06-08T01:03:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	do you know exactly which chip it is?  You can run lspci and find out...
2010-06-08T01:04:00.000Z	nuboon2age	fidormula	When I said I don't know what it indicates I mean when its greyed out but not enabled.  I don't know exactly how it gets in that state.
