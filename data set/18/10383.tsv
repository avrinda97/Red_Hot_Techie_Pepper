2007-05-23T15:45:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	cool.  Thanks
2007-05-23T15:49:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	so the email signing thing only works if I send it to someone else who has the same email signing thing set up?
2007-05-23T15:50:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	no, I think if they have PGP, they will be able to verify your GPG signature, too. (But I haven't tried)
2007-05-23T15:50:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	ah.  Ok.  cool.  well thanks again
2007-06-28T16:18:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	what's the error? Use a pastebin please.
2007-06-28T16:18:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	I've googled the error that's not what I need... is there a way to purge all of my un-needed packages?
2007-06-28T16:19:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	sure, you can feed multiple package names as arguments to 'sudo apt-get --purge remove'
2007-06-28T16:20:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	yep, tried that not working though.... is there a way to purge all of the ones that aren't needed?
2007-06-28T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	what do you mean by "aren't needed"? Do you mean packages that have no reverse dependencies?
2007-06-28T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	if that's the issue, deborphan may come in handy
2007-06-28T16:22:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	I think that after I've removed a package before it told me that to uninstall all of the no-longer-needed files there was some command
2007-06-28T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	do you mean apt-get autoremove ?
2007-06-28T16:23:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	yup that was the one I was thinking of... but that didn't work either... crap
2007-06-28T16:25:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	 :-) but that autoremove gave me a different error message which gives me more google results :-)
2007-07-31T12:44:00.000Z	soundray	hendrixski	with bash rather than sed, 'tac filename | head -n 2 | tail -n 1' :)
2007-07-31T12:44:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	oh... I'll try that
2007-07-31T12:54:00.000Z	hendrixski	soundray	the tac | head | tail thing only prints out the last few lines... is there a way I can then add a line of my own text just before the last line?
