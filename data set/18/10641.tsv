2006-11-06T10:55:00.000Z	Vuen		my hard drive is a total disaster
2006-11-06T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	I'd just use gparted
2006-11-06T10:57:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	tried that, gparted gives some cryptic error
2006-11-06T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	Can you pastebin that cryptic error?
2006-11-09T12:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	Sorry, I should know better, sombody did that to me when I was new :(
2006-11-09T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	I am probably going to sleep soon, please give my apologies if he comes back.
2007-02-06T10:17:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	does it work with the right ctrl? my left ctrl is broken :(
2007-02-06T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	I don't have a right control :) try it?
2007-02-06T10:18:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	doesn't seem to work :(
2007-02-06T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	remap your control key :)
2007-02-06T10:18:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	really i should just buy a new keyboard
2007-02-06T10:19:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	i'm having trouble parting with this one because i spraypainted it white
2007-02-06T10:19:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	so there are no key labels
2007-02-06T10:19:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	it's just a panel of a hundred unlabeled keys. it's totally awesome
2007-02-06T10:19:00.000Z	Vuen	Jordan_U	but it was a lot of work, and i don't want to have to do that to a new keyboard :p
2007-02-06T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	they make keyboards like that, the ones I have seen are overpriced
2007-02-06T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vuen	My typing teacher probably did it before you were born :)
