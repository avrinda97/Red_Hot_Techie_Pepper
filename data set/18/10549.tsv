2006-11-17T10:29:00.000Z	distrbnce		can someone help me manually set the resolution and refresh?
2006-11-17T10:29:00.000Z	distrbnce		the default options suck
2006-11-17T10:29:00.000Z	distrbnce		one is 1024, and the higher resolution has a super low refresh
2006-11-17T10:30:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	what are your monitor and graphics card capable of?
2006-11-17T10:32:00.000Z	distrbnce	soundray	a lot of options... it's a geforce 5200 and a normal monitor... but i only get 4 options in the display options
2006-11-17T10:33:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	do you have the horizontal sync and vertical refresh ranges for your monitor? Then use "Advanced" for setting up the Monitor section as you go through 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2006-11-17T10:35:00.000Z	distrbnce	soundray	i don't have a list of them or anything. i just want to use 1152864 with a decent refresh rate
2006-11-17T10:35:00.000Z	distrbnce	soundray	i have what you told me open now though
2006-11-17T10:38:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	to set your resolution that way, use "Medium" in the Monitor section
2006-11-17T10:38:00.000Z	distrbnce	soundray	in the configuration, the bus driver is set at PCI:1:0:0  should i change it if it's an AGP card?
2006-11-17T10:39:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	no, leave the defaults for everything except the Monitor stuff.
2006-11-17T10:39:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	the AGP card has a PCI ID
2006-11-17T10:41:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	you won't, if you stick with the defaults for everything else. They are from your current configuration.
2006-11-17T10:42:00.000Z	distrbnce	soundray	Write default Files section to configuration file? Yes/No
2006-11-17T10:42:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	either, it won't change anything
2006-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	distrbnce	soundray	i'm done, should i restart gnome?
2006-11-17T10:47:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	yes. After that, you should see more options in System-Preferences--Screen Res
2006-11-17T10:55:00.000Z	soundray	distrbnce	it worked then?
