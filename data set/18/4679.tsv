2010-01-23T08:02:00.000Z	wasutton3		i think i might have changed the permissions of /bin/bash how would i go about fixing that?
2010-01-23T08:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	"ls -l /bin/bash" should be root:root rwxr-xr-x
2010-01-23T08:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	tried "sudo apt-get install dash"?
2010-01-23T08:17:00.000Z	wasutton3	ZykoticK9	i got dash installed
2010-01-23T08:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	tried "sudo apt-get install bash" then?
2010-01-23T08:19:00.000Z	wasutton3	ZykoticK9	i tried that, ill paste it really quick
2010-01-23T08:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	i imagine your error is caused because one of the install scripts is trying to call /bin/bash - which isn't there
2010-01-23T08:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	certainly worth a try -- you MIGHT even try linking dash to bash to test
2010-01-23T08:28:00.000Z	wasutton3	ZykoticK9	you are brilliant, i linked it, then was able to install and everything was fine again, no errors, thanks
2010-01-23T08:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	glad you got it :)
2010-01-23T08:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	research the sudoers file
2010-07-23T19:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	that might be a compiz limitation, you might want to also as in the #compiz channel.  good luck.
2010-07-23T19:35:00.000Z	wasutton3	ZykoticK9	Yea im working on that now
2010-07-23T19:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	it might be that too.  never used that many buttons ;)
2010-07-23T19:36:00.000Z	wasutton3	ZykoticK9	yea, the mx revo has quite a few problems
2010-07-23T19:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	i'm using a Logitech MX 518 and all buttons work by default.
2010-07-23T19:37:00.000Z	wasutton3	ZykoticK9	yea, mines the MX Revolution, has like 15 buttons on it
2010-07-23T19:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	wasutton3	that's a lot more then the 8 on mine (and 2 are hardware only)
