2007-10-16T05:32:00.000Z	mzuverink	_Lucretia_	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-10-16T05:34:00.000Z	mzuverink	_Lucretia_	provided you have the proper repos enabled, you should be able to get java via "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts" which will also add the firefox plugin
2007-10-16T05:34:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	mzuverink	I'm getting this error: com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath
2007-10-16T05:35:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	mzuverink	and no java6 plugin, that's why I installed 1.4

2007-10-16T05:42:00.000Z	mzuverink	_Lucretia_	looks like you have everything, you could try going to suns java site and installing the official from them, but first uninstall any java you already have installed via apt
2007-10-16T05:42:00.000Z	mzuverink	_Lucretia_	beyond that I do not know what to tell you, sorry I could not be more help than that
