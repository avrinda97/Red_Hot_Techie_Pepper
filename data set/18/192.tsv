2012-09-17T20:09:00.000Z	mnice		hello
2012-09-17T20:09:00.000Z	mnice		is supported upgrade from 10.4 -> 12.4 ?
2012-09-17T20:09:00.000Z	mnice		seems like not .. my actual attempts end up with errors
2012-09-17T20:10:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	What errors do you get?
2012-09-17T20:11:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	One thing I would recommend, is to start with a fully updated system.
2012-09-17T20:11:00.000Z	mnice		okay, thanks .. will do
2012-09-17T20:11:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	In other words, if you have updates to do on your 10.04 system, you should do them first.
2012-09-17T20:12:00.000Z	mnice	usr13	i can't show right now .. doing backup .. i wouldn't bother with backup if it works .. now there's some live knoppix running
2012-09-17T20:12:00.000Z	mnice		but generally it wanted bigger APT::Cache-Limit.
2012-09-17T20:12:00.000Z	mnice		and increasing didn't take affect
2012-09-17T20:13:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	Check to see if your disk space is not low.  *df*
2012-09-17T20:14:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	You should only need to backup /home/  or /home/mnice/  and you don't need to use a LiveCD for that.
2012-09-17T20:14:00.000Z	mnice		i did all of these "obligatory" steps
2012-09-17T20:15:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	So your system is actually 10.04.1 right now?
2012-09-17T20:15:00.000Z	mnice	usr13	the first attempt ended up with message that however upgraded passed it went with some errors and the system might be thus left in unstable state
2012-09-17T20:15:00.000Z	mnice		**upgrade passed
2012-09-17T20:16:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	ActionParsnip's suggestion is a good idea:  sudo apt-get clean
2012-09-17T20:17:00.000Z	usr13	mnice	And make sure it ifishes without errors.
