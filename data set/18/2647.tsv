2011-02-13T05:22:00.000Z	magicianlord	soreau	he may not feel safe yet with replacing Vista
2011-02-13T05:23:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	He has 1TB hdd, I don't think he needs to replace anything
2011-02-13T05:24:00.000Z	magicianlord	soreau	it's not about space. its aboutcompatibility and knowing how to navigate
2011-02-13T05:24:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	How do you know what he wants?
2011-02-13T05:24:00.000Z	magicianlord	soreau	it's obvious
2011-02-13T05:27:00.000Z	magicianlord	soreau	what is the default log in pas on the live session
2011-02-13T05:27:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	nothing
2011-02-13T05:28:00.000Z	magicianlord	soreau	maybe
2011-02-13T05:32:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	After he gets his drivers loaded and compiz running
2011-02-13T05:37:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	I didn't know he was on a live cd so I had him update :p
2011-02-13T05:38:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	Nah, it could mess up the system
2011-02-13T05:38:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	Bad habit to make too - stopping the package manager in the middle of updating
2011-02-13T05:39:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	No it wont, the packages are already d/l'd and he has a reasonably fast system
2011-02-13T05:47:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	lol
2011-02-13T05:48:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	I think it counts down to 10 and auto logs in, or if you hit enter it will log in right away
2011-02-13T05:49:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	Well it's kinda obvious with the time out thing.. if anything the nvidia drivers probably just exploded on him
2011-02-13T05:50:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	failsauce :)
2011-02-13T05:51:00.000Z	soreau	magicianlord	I'm having him test the gdm login again
