2011-05-24T01:56:00.000Z	jsuhde		I have a question if someone has some free time.
2011-05-24T01:56:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	best to just try asking
2011-05-24T01:57:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	up to you, but how much memory do you have?
2011-05-24T01:58:00.000Z	jsuhde	LjL	4 gigs
2011-05-24T01:58:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	the only real issue with 64bit is that sometimes you might find software (if you are adventurous and install software from outside the repositories in the first place) that only comes compiled for 32bit
2011-05-24T01:59:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	on the other hand, if you use 32bit you won't be able to access all of your 4gb of RAM, unless you use something called PAE (which is probably enabled by default these days, but i think it's sort of slowish and hackish)
2011-05-24T01:59:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	you'll only access like 3.5gb or so
2011-05-24T01:59:00.000Z	jsuhde	LjL	so a bit more speedy if I go with 64, but may run into compatability issues down the line?
2011-05-24T02:00:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	basically. but do keep in mind that the more time passes, the more likely you will be to find stuff compiled for 64bit in the first place
2011-05-24T02:00:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	i'm using 64bit now, for what it's worth
2011-05-24T02:01:00.000Z	jsuhde	LjL	once more quick question, and thanks BTW. I already have Slackware and win7, I want to replace Slackware with Ubuntu, will the install walk me through that. Also I'm currently using lilo.
2011-05-24T02:02:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	uhm it will walk you through replacing it, but i'm not really sure it'll walk you through importing your old data, at least unless you have a separate /home partition. it'll just wipe out Slackware.
2011-05-24T02:02:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	well actually it won't even really walk you through replacing it i suspect, as the options are "install alongside another OS", "remove all your OS's and replace them with Ubuntu", and "configure manually". but the manual configuration is easy.
2011-05-24T02:03:00.000Z	jsuhde	LjL	yeah I got everything on a external drive, so no worries there. is it going to replace lilo though?
2011-05-24T02:03:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	yes
2011-05-24T02:03:00.000Z	jsuhde	LjL	i'm assumeing with a new bootloader? I just want to make sure I can still dual boot. Thanks!
2011-05-24T02:04:00.000Z	LjL	jsuhde	it'll replace it with GRUB2. if everything goes well (it always did for me), GRUB2 will automatically be configured to boot every operating system you have installed.
2011-05-24T02:04:00.000Z	jsuhde	LjL	sweet thanks for your help
