2012-07-05T04:04:00.000Z	danub		where do i go to get unity help?
2012-07-05T04:05:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	here is a good start
2012-07-05T04:05:00.000Z	danub	ulugbek	thats what i thought, but no one knows the answer
2012-07-05T04:08:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	you had this issue before or after reset?
2012-07-05T04:12:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	sounds like compiz borkery, are you using the same configuration files before/after the upgrade?
2012-07-05T04:12:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	ie the ones in you home directory
2012-07-05T04:15:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	there are some subtle differences, if you do not have heavy environmental customization, i would suggest using gconf (or preferred) to send everything to 'defaults'
2012-07-05T04:16:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	as I suspected it is compiz
2012-07-05T04:17:00.000Z	danub	ulugbek	so what? remove and reinstall compiz?
2012-07-05T04:17:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	try to disable then re-enable rather than install/uninstall
2012-07-05T04:18:00.000Z	danub	ulugbek	got a link? i know jack about the x subsystem. up until i installed ubuntu, i was always a headless redhat guy
2012-07-05T04:19:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	one moment, i just had to do this a couple weeks ago, looking for my txt file
2012-07-05T04:33:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	well i cant find my howto, must be at work, but -
2012-07-05T04:33:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	something to try maybe to reset compiz to defaults via
2012-07-05T04:33:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1 -and then-
2012-07-05T04:34:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/compizconfig
2012-07-05T04:37:00.000Z	danub	ulugbek	2 questions. 1, in your dash home, do you get a scroll bar? can you scroll that window? and 2 where can i set keyboard shortcuts? i looked in the keyboard settings but nothing is there for my shortcuts
2012-07-05T04:38:00.000Z	ulugbek	danub	no scroll, and i have no idea about shortcuts, sry :(
