2007-02-27T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 asking a more specific question - does wonders...
2007-02-27T10:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 i woudl think a read of the qemu docs would be in order.. you have to run qemu with the proper options to tell it to use the .iso files as the cd drive.. I reccomend you just go get vmware-server and use it instead.. or that other Virtuilixation tool.. (but i forget the name)
2007-02-27T10:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 huh.. why cant you just  download the virtualbox deb and sudo dpkg -i virtualbox.deb (or whatever its called)
2007-02-27T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 time to read some begainner guides i guess. :)
2007-02-27T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 "sudo dpkg -i PACKAGENAME.deb"   for installing things you download.
2007-02-27T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 assuming ya got all the other dependencies installed if any are needed.
2007-02-27T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 exe? you dident want a exe ya wanted the .deb :)
2007-02-27T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 one thing about virtual box.. you will need to edit the /etc/group file, (as root) and the last line     vboxusers:x:1003:willis  , (willis is my username) you will need to add your own user names there (instead of willis) to let users run VIrtualbox.. (or use sudo Virtualbox)
2007-02-27T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 you realize that command you used said basicially 'look in the current directory for the Virtualbox.deb file?"
2007-02-27T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 if its not in the current dir.. give the full path, or cd to where the file is at THEN use the command.. bash 101.
2007-02-27T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 if you cant handle the idea if 'current directory and paths' well i suggest reading a few bash beginner guides.
2007-02-27T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	superlinux	 hint... do a 'cd Desktop' THEN run that  sudo dpkg -i Whatevercommand
