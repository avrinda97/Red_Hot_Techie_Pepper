2006-08-31T07:59:00.000Z	mowgli		hello all! novice Linux user here! I've been fighting for the last 2 days to get Ubuntu find my SAGEM FAST 800 with eagle-usb driver. today i did clean reinstall of Ubuntu (Dapper) from an Alternate ISO and installed all needed dependencies for eagle-usb-data, eagle-usb-utils and eagle-usb-modules-source with 'sudo aptitude', plus build-essential and linux-headers. after installing the first...
2006-08-31T07:59:00.000Z	mowgli		...2 .deb files I tried to build the modules with 'sudo module-assistant', as indicated in the README.Debian file. But that gave me a report with at least these 2 errors: 'libxslt-proc missing' and 'eagle-usb driver already installed; do a make uninstall'. is that a bug (all dependencies were correct!)? and how can I find this supposedly installed driver in the system??
2006-08-31T08:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	in the wiki you can find detailed instructions....
2006-08-31T08:02:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	url or domain for search, pls?
2006-08-31T08:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	i'm searching now but today the wiki is painfully slow
2006-08-31T08:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/EagleUsb
2006-08-31T08:08:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	thx!!
2006-08-31T08:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	no problem. i'm sure you read it but note that you must follow the instruucions of the section installing from source
2006-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	packages.ubuntu.com also offers a .deb file called 'eagle-usb-modules-source', which is the one I tried to build with 'module-assistant'. Is that file that the wiki calls 'broken'? is the gna.org source better?
2006-08-31T08:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	i supose bu i have not read the wiki hold on a moment...
2006-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	at paragraph 'Installing from source'
2006-08-31T08:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	yes do what the wiki says dl the sourcecode from gna.org and build it. before just do 'sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)'
2006-08-31T08:23:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	2 questions: should I first try to uninstall the eagle-usb driver that 'module-assistant' found? how do i do that? and: WinRAR asks me if I want to replace the file 'eagle-usb-2.3.3\utils\scripts\common.pm', which means there are 2 files with the same name in the tarball. could that be a bug or a security risk?
2006-08-31T08:23:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	winRAR during extraction, of course...
2006-08-31T08:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	i do not think so... regarding the rar... in the wiki they point to a tar.bz2 not to a rar file http://download.gna.org/eagleusb/eagle-usb-2.3.0/eagle-usb-2.3.3.tar.bz2
2006-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	WinRAR can handle both bz2 and tar files (i'm on WinXP right now...), that's why i was using it to test and extract the files. shouldn't i?
2006-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	mowgli	maybe winrar got confused somehow... i don't know
2006-08-31T08:44:00.000Z	mowgli	erUSUL	WinRAR mixed up files 'common.pm' and 'Common.pm', which in Windows means the same thing. thx again! i'll give it a shot now. bye!
