2009-01-31T22:38:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	Unfortunately, I cannot get the PC to properly boot with the nvidia driver.
2009-01-31T22:39:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	sorry, missed that I think. I've had some odd situation like this with my laptop where it would boot up and just hate my nvidia driver
2009-01-31T22:40:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	Well, the PC will boot, but X tries 3 times to initialize the video with my xorg.conf. Then gives the option to use "safe mode" and I choose shutdown. Then it transfers into a low VGA mode, shows the Ubuntu login screen, starts playing the login sound and locks up entirely.
2009-01-31T22:40:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	If I remember correctly, I nuked my xorg.conf, kicked X, and prayed for good fortune. Thankfully the nVidia gods smiled on me the last time it happened.
2009-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	yeah I think i'll have to do that as well. I'm going to keep my current xorg.conf for backup and start working on a new one. Unfortunately I've been unable to find really good documentation on writing an xorg.conf from scratch.
2009-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	I know it's "cheating" but I let the 'nvidia-settings' app write my conf's for me. Just don't have time to fuss with that crap anymore :)
2009-01-31T22:42:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	Yeah I did that this last time too, but it epic failed.
2009-01-31T22:44:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m41112a66 <--- behold the failed nvidia-xconfig attempt
2009-01-31T22:45:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	want mine?
2009-01-31T22:46:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	I'm using dual monitors on a laptop, should be similar enough for a starting point.
2009-01-31T22:46:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	Yeah, that'd be great. I could use a reference point.

2009-01-31T22:49:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	Merci! :)
2009-01-31T22:50:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	Np!
2009-01-31T23:01:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	Apparently, nvidia has a forum for this kinda stuff. http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=14
2009-01-31T23:02:00.000Z	f4nt	sholsinger	when did nvidia start helping people? :)
2009-01-31T23:02:00.000Z	sholsinger	f4nt	I know! ;P
