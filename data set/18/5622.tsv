2010-06-18T06:17:00.000Z	grumbly		hello.  I need help, and I don't know that the terms I'm using are the correct ones...  I'm trying to set up a way to control what music is playing from my laptop remotely, but not play using the remote
2010-06-18T06:19:00.000Z	grumbly		the setup i've got is a laptop, lets call it musicplayer and a cash register with a kiosk interface-  it can access a couple web pages within the network.  I want to be able to change the music without leaving the register.
2010-06-18T06:20:00.000Z	aplund	grumbly	what music player are you using?
2010-06-18T06:20:00.000Z	grumbly	aplund	none as of yet.
2010-06-18T06:21:00.000Z	grumbly	aplund	the name of the laptop is musicplayer
2010-06-18T06:22:00.000Z	aplund	grumbly	rhythmbox has a rhythmbox-client command to do stuff like that
2010-06-18T06:22:00.000Z	grumbly	aplund	is it web-based?
2010-06-18T06:23:00.000Z	aplund	grumbly	but if you prefer another player... then I dunno
2010-06-18T06:23:00.000Z	aplund	grumbly	no.  it's a command
