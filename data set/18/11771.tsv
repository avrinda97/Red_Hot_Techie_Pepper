2006-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jared	to delete a file you MUST write to a drive
2006-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jared	ntfs is read only
2006-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	jared		what do you mean i must write to a drive?
2006-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		deleting a files means you must write to the file allocation table that the file no longer exists..
2006-08-06T07:56:00.000Z	jared		oh
2006-08-06T07:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jared	you dont have write access so you can not delete a file
