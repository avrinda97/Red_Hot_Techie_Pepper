When i first tried to boot i got "cylinder is too large;not supported by BIOS" twice and the third time i tried to reboort my BIOS didn't recognize my HDD at all, 4th time it worked fine, except that I keep getting IO errors no matter what i do
2009-04-19T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	run an fsck
2009-04-19T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	you should only use su to change to a different user, use sudo -i if you want a root-like terminal
2009-04-19T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	get it fsck'd in live cd
2009-04-19T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	the name of your drive, /dev/sda /dev/hda etc
2009-04-19T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	can you run: sudo fdisk -l
2009-04-19T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	ok, get into live cd and run sudo fdisk -l   the partitions will be named /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 etc (for exemple). These are partitions on /dev/sda
2009-04-19T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	you need to use that in the command, you will need to run all this form the live cd as you cannot run commands currently on nyour installed system
2009-04-19T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	sudo fdisk -l   (minus ell)
2009-04-19T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	you can then fsck that disk
2009-04-19T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	and the partitionsin your system
2009-04-19T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	you can also rum smartctl -H /dev/<drive name
2009-04-19T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	then you can boot to root recovery console, umount all the partitions and check them there
2009-04-19T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	press esc when grub loads, select recovery mode for your kernel, then select root console, youu will be dropped to sinle user console mode
2009-04-19T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	you will need to unmount all partitions which you can nthen run with fsck
2009-04-19T17:10:00.000Z	Scription	ActionParsnip	can u pm me that thing u posted about hitting esc and all that?
2009-04-19T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	reboot pc, start hammering ESC key on the keyboard and you will be away
2009-04-19T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scription	thats all there is to it
