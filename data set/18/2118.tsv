2011-04-04T06:47:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	I have no idea, it should, but it doesn't detect the NAP service unless I start PAND on one of the PCs, and when I do, blueman-applet detects the NAP service, but it doesn't connect because it says connection refused
2011-04-04T06:48:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	I've also tried using the NM plugins and the non-NM plugins on blueman-applet, and it's the same result
2011-04-04T06:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	DARKGuy	How odd.. I've managed to share a ubuntu netbook's network with something running arch just fine without network manager..
2011-04-04T06:49:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	I personally hate NM :P do you know how to do it without it?
2011-04-04T06:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	DARKGuy	I'm trying to say Blueman-applet it supposed to just work!
2011-04-04T06:49:00.000Z	Diamondcite	DARKGuy	Assuming it's a paired device and is active
2011-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	oh, yeah, it should, but I don't know why I get the connection refused error :/
2011-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	they are :S
2011-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	I even try to remove them, start up pand on both comps and they ask to pair up before making the connection
2011-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	Diamondcite	DARKGuy	I have never heard of pand personally.. it just kinda worked... *researches*
2011-04-04T06:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Diamondcite	lucky you :P
