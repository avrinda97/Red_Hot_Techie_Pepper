2006-11-16T11:30:00.000Z	Kris		damn
2006-11-16T11:31:00.000Z	Kris		is that you soundray?
2006-11-16T11:31:00.000Z	Kris		Ah right.
2006-11-16T11:32:00.000Z	Kris		I can't find out my ESSID, and thus can't connect to my wireless network.
2006-11-16T11:32:00.000Z	Kris		I'm just not sure if there's anything I can do without the essid.
2006-11-16T11:34:00.000Z	Kris		Could you elaborate minimec?
2006-11-16T11:35:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	You can have a look at the current settings by typing 'iwconfig' in a gnome-terminal
2006-11-16T11:39:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	Is that the correct one? ;)
2006-11-16T11:40:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	So your card works and recognices the network ... the problem is elsewere.
2006-11-16T11:43:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	Do you use the network-manager in the systray?
2006-11-16T11:45:00.000Z	Kris	minimec	What do you mean?
2006-11-16T11:46:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	How do you try to connect to your network?
2006-11-16T11:47:00.000Z	Kris	minimec	I go to network settings -> wireless connection. Is that what you mean?
2006-11-16T11:48:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	Do you have an icon in your panel, indicating the network connection? Clicking once on it should give you the wifi networks around, or the connected network.
2006-11-16T11:53:00.000Z	Kris	minimec	I don't have the icon in my panel.
2006-11-16T11:54:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	ok. It could be, that you don't have the nm-applet installed. This software is quiet nice to have. Load synaptic (sudo synaptic) and search for nm-applet. If it is not installed, install it.
2006-11-16T11:55:00.000Z	Kris	minimec	I can do that from the Ubuntu installation CD?
2006-11-16T11:56:00.000Z	minimec	Kris	I guess you can.
