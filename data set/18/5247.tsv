2008-11-20T01:43:00.000Z	omenek		Hi, got a q: How to downgrade wget?
2008-11-20T01:44:00.000Z	omenek		Hmm, someone knows how to   d o w n g r a d e   w g e t ?
2008-11-20T01:45:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	remove it, get an older release, compile the older release, install the older release
2008-11-20T01:46:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	how i remove it? cause when i write apt-get remove wget it wants to remove sth more than only wget
2008-11-20T01:46:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	ah tricky
2008-11-20T01:47:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	you could of course install the older release _over_ the newer one
2008-11-20T01:47:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	I don't know how that affects dpkg though
2008-11-20T01:48:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	and how to do that? i tried dl'in that older ver i want and compiling it, but it errors at make
2008-11-20T01:48:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	you probably lack dev-packages
2008-11-20T01:49:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	why an older one btw?
2008-11-20T01:49:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	the 1.10 ver supports dl'in from rapidshare :P
2008-11-20T01:50:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	and the newer one has problems with loggin
2008-11-20T01:52:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	I still suggest installing wget OVER what you have now
2008-11-20T01:53:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	ok, but exactly how? (sry im a real newbie)
2008-11-20T01:53:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	i got the ver i want in tar.gz
2008-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	what do i need to do now
2008-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	quilzo	omenek	we'll do this in query, as not to pollute the channel
2008-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	omenek	quilzo	k
