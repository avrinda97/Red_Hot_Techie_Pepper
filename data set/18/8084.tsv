2007-10-03T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	#epiphany on gnome irc
2007-10-03T07:02:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	the gnome server is not listed on the xchat menu, do you know the address to it?
2007-10-03T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	irc.gnome.org should work
2007-10-03T07:29:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	you should wait more than 6 minutes.... see: http://www.gnome.org/~nigeltao/epiphany_extensions/bookmark-shortcuts/
2007-10-03T07:30:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	sorry. and thanks for the link!
2007-10-03T07:37:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	i already have smart bookmarks enabled on epiphany, though it does not exhibit the corresponding behavior. do i need to install it again manually?
2007-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	well what does it do?
2007-10-03T07:40:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	it runs a google search with the inputted text as a string, which is fine usually, but if i type for example "ubuntu forums" in the address bar, i would like it to directly go to ubuntuforums.org. is that possible?
2007-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	read the txt file for the extension I linked you to
2007-10-03T07:44:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	or change the about:config key for the search
2007-10-03T07:45:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	i tried the about:config page but i cannot find a corresponding string

2007-10-03T07:47:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	thanks
2007-10-03T07:47:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	i will look through that now
2007-10-03T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	iobelisk	http://kb.mozillazine.org/Keyword.URL
2007-10-03T07:50:00.000Z	iobelisk	jrib	aha! it worked! keyword.url . man, all this while i had been searching about:config for "find" or "search" or "address bar". thanks a lot!!
