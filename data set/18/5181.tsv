2008-11-30T10:36:00.000Z	terryx		can't install ubuntu
2008-11-30T10:37:00.000Z	rww	terryx	some of us are. If you're having a problem, say what it is, giving as much relevant information as possible.
2008-11-30T10:40:00.000Z	rww	terryx	what's the first option? Try Ubuntu without making changes to your computer or something like that?
2008-11-30T10:41:00.000Z	terryx	rww	then it starts loading..
2008-11-30T10:42:00.000Z	rww	terryx	what's on the screen when it hangs? any error messages, or just a blank screen, or just the Ubuntu loading screen?
2008-11-30T10:44:00.000Z	rww	terryx	I'm familiar with vmware, yes
2008-11-30T10:45:00.000Z	rww	terryx	there's a bunch of options you can change on that first screen (the one where you pressed Enter at the first option). Probably setting one of those would solve your problem.
2008-11-30T10:47:00.000Z	rww	terryx	that's not enough RAM to install Ubuntu. Xubuntu could manage it with the Alternate (text-based) CD, but it'd be tight. You may want to go with a more cut-down distribution.
2008-11-30T10:54:00.000Z	rww	terryx	Sorry, had to restart. As I said already, hit F6 at that bootup screen to get to the More Options page. Read the information there. One of them should tell you how to turn off the Ubuntu loading bar, so you'll see whatever error is happening. Come back with that error.
2008-12-24T13:34:00.000Z	terryx	rww	there is a folder called host, i want to copy my some files to host
2008-12-24T13:35:00.000Z	rww	terryx	I haven't used Wubi recently, either, so I'm not sure how to help. Are the files you're copying from readable by you? Are you able to create new files in the directory you're copying to? (issue "touch /host/path/to/directory/test" to check)
2009-01-09T13:12:00.000Z	rww	terryx	that's a known bug and shouldn't stop dpkg from running, if i remember correctly
2009-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	terryx	rww	u mean no problem...its continue installing updates...
2009-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	rww	terryx	It should do, yes.
2009-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	rww	terryx	is it? or is it stopping after that error?
2009-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	terryx	rww	how can i install languages, indian languages in ubuntu?
