2007-12-27T10:19:00.000Z	Onyx		looking for some help
2007-12-27T10:19:00.000Z	Onyx		I just hit something+r (on the keyboard) and it zoomed my screen in... how the hell do I get it back to normal zoom?
2007-12-27T10:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Onyx	what is the issue?
2007-12-27T10:20:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	nah, I don't think it's compiz... it's like the entire screen is zoomed
2007-12-27T10:23:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	Nah, it's the entire desktop environment...
2007-12-27T10:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Onyx	then it must be compiz
2007-12-27T10:23:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	Ahhhh, there we go.
2007-12-27T10:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Onyx	nice work
2007-12-27T10:24:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	thanks for the direction :P
2007-12-27T10:24:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	That sure was annoying... ;)
2007-12-27T10:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Onyx	and that is the Super key now :}
2007-12-27T10:24:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	What does that key do for me now?
2007-12-27T10:25:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	Been about six years since I last used Linux (just installed Ubuntu this morning), and that key didn't do anything for me back in the day.
2007-12-27T10:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Onyx	try super e, super q; if you have the ccsm extensions checked it is the master of key combox
2007-12-27T10:26:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	super q does nothing, but super e is pretty badass.
2007-12-27T10:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Onyx	try and enabling it then :}
2008-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	Onyx	bazhang	Will this replace the current version?
