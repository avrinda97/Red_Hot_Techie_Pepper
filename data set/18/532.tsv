2012-01-05T13:54:00.000Z	Chipzzz		shouldn't sudo apt-get install -f openssh fix it?
2012-01-05T13:56:00.000Z	Chipzzz		he's already root, isn't he? ... so just apt-get -f install openssh?
2012-01-05T13:56:00.000Z	Chipzzz		it depends on pan, doesn't it?
2012-01-05T13:56:00.000Z	Chipzzz		(pam)
2012-01-05T13:58:00.000Z	Chipzzz		lol
2012-01-05T14:00:00.000Z	Chipzzz		lol... that's a point
2012-01-05T14:01:00.000Z	Chipzzz		it's easy enough to see if it installs the missing lib, though
2012-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	Chipzzz		good question, Zyclops1
2012-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	Zyclops1	Chipzzz	this is development server which mainly just sits around does nothing.. except accept git pushes and runs our software management stuff
2012-01-05T14:03:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	Oh, all sorts of strange things happen on dev servers
2012-01-05T14:04:00.000Z	Zyclops1	Chipzzz	ah right.. i suppose ti probably has lots of programming packages installed
2012-01-05T14:04:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	if anyone's writing c code or assembly, there's no telling what might happen to the server
2012-01-05T14:05:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	Oh, that's a bit harder to explain, then
2012-01-05T14:08:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	didn't sound like an error that could be ignored
2012-01-05T14:09:00.000Z	Zyclops1	Chipzzz	haha guess not
2012-01-05T14:14:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	:)
2012-01-05T14:14:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	:(
2012-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Zyclops1	I'm guessing you still have some 32 bit software that should be 64 (hence the segfault)
