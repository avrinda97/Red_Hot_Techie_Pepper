2005-04-26T05:32:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	ups	how can i check if nautilius exist at start ?
2005-04-26T05:33:00.000Z	ups	Sp4rKy	when u login, do u see nautilus in the splash screen?
2005-04-26T05:33:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	ups	how can i add it ?
2005-04-26T05:38:00.000Z	ups	Sp4rKy	i'm not really sure, sorry. it is supposed to start by default
2005-04-26T05:39:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	ups	ok, but it's possible i 'd remove it, or do you think gdesklet could do this ?
2005-04-26T05:40:00.000Z	ups	Sp4rKy	don't think gdesklets removes it, but you might have changed some settings perhaps?
2005-04-26T05:40:00.000Z	ups	Sp4rKy	although i cant find where it is specified
2005-04-26T05:41:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	ups	perhaps, i 'll try to add nautilius again, thx
2005-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	ups	do you think it could be /apps/nautilius/start-state ?
2005-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	ups	Sp4rKy	ec, lemme check
2005-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	ups	Sp4rKy	prolly not, as it is empty for me too
