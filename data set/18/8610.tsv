2007-07-25T07:44:00.000Z	Tomo_		can anyone recommend a reference book that covers most topics on linux but isnt too technical... just something to help a beginner get out of trouble if they need it
2007-07-25T07:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Tomo_	I find Oreilly books to be good, but better if you already have an idea what you're doing.  I was thinking "Running Linux" as it was my first book, but thought the dummy book for RH7.3 was better for a newb
2007-07-25T07:47:00.000Z	Tomo_	craigbass1976	 haha i have not a clue what im doing.. i just migrated to ubuntu yesterday after a lifetime on windows
2007-07-25T07:48:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Tomo_	Well, you're most of the way there then.  What in particular are you looking for?
2007-07-25T07:48:00.000Z	Tomo_	craigbass1976	 just want to understand what the commands are that im typing in... i know i can just do them but i feel better if i have a small understanding of them
2007-07-25T07:49:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Tomo_	what have you been typing?
2007-07-25T07:49:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Tomo_	Have you discovered the man pages yet?  Not always very helpful, but sometimes they're a start
2007-07-25T07:50:00.000Z	Tomo_	craigbass1976	 well the tutorials on how to get certain things working.. i just type in the code they give me without second thought of what its doing

2007-07-25T08:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Tomo_	I have a book that gives pretty detailed descritions of commands, but it's a big 'un.
