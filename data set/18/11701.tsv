2006-06-25T16:29:00.000Z	finalbeta		is Xchat gnome diffrend from the normal Xchat? Because I can't seem to find how to auth after connecting to a server.
2006-06-25T16:29:00.000Z	finalbeta		crippeled :p
2006-06-25T16:30:00.000Z	finalbeta		ok, cu in 5 mins then. yep
2006-06-25T07:26:00.000Z	finalbeta		I want to move my Desktop from XP to ubuntu, but first I would like to test wetter ubuntu can use the TV card. Can I test this from the live CD? what software do I need?
2006-06-25T07:27:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	what tv card is it?
2006-06-25T07:27:00.000Z	finalbeta	Bazzi	sry can't even say, it's a medion PC.
2006-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	then just try with the livecd and hope it is recognized automagically
2006-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	you can see by using "lspci" or similar commands whether it has been detected
2006-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	finalbeta	Bazzi	I'm running the live cd on it now. Impressed it even booted up correctly, don't know where to go look for the card tho.
2006-06-25T07:29:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	theres also a device manager like in windows
2006-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	finalbeta	Bazzi	stefg : SAA7134 Video Broadcast Decoder, Philips Semiconductors, Creatix Polymedia GmbH , in the device manager it does seem to have a driver linked to it.
2006-08-11T15:52:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	money, being not free
2006-08-11T15:52:00.000Z	finalbeta	Bazzi	propetarie drivers don't cost money, they just are not opensource
2006-08-11T15:52:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	codecs have license costs, though
2006-08-11T15:54:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	linspire (freespire) has spent money on codec licensing
2006-08-11T15:55:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	and it shouldn't take you hours to setup.
2006-08-11T15:56:00.000Z	Bazzi	finalbeta	my suggestion is to just give a new user some hints already.
2006-08-11T15:57:00.000Z	finalbeta	Bazzi	after installation they should give new users some sort of automatix.
