2007-03-28T10:49:00.000Z	greddy		Can i Shift my Ubuntu6.06 to Edgy? i have a Edgy CD.
2007-03-28T10:51:00.000Z	greddy		i d0nt want to upgrade my 6.06 to edgy c0z i d0nt have bandwidth or high speed connection.. i just want to upgrade my edgy through CD?
2007-03-28T10:52:00.000Z	cables	greddy	there are instructions there. You'll still have to download the CD though
2007-03-28T10:52:00.000Z	greddy	cables	 i have the Edgy CD
2007-03-28T10:52:00.000Z	cables	greddy	I just want to tell you that unless you have a broken "o" key, seriously don't use zer0.
2007-03-28T10:53:00.000Z	greddy	cables	 i just want to upgrade my 6.06 to edgy from Cd.
2007-03-28T10:53:00.000Z	cables	greddy	you can backup your files and reinstall from scratch, otherwise you're out of luck.
2007-03-28T10:53:00.000Z	cables	greddy	because you need the Edgy Alternate CD in order to do an upgrade.
2007-03-28T10:54:00.000Z	cables	greddy	if you're unwilling to download an additional ISO or perform an internet upgrade, you'll have to install Edgy from scratch.
2007-03-28T10:55:00.000Z	greddy	cables	if i just use my 6.06 version partition for edgy .. then edgy format it self its valid way?
2007-03-28T10:55:00.000Z	cables	greddy	edgy will overwrite your data. You'll need to back it up before installing Edgy
2007-03-28T10:56:00.000Z	greddy	cables	 i d0nt have anything on that partition just Except Ubuntu dapper-drake
2007-03-28T10:56:00.000Z	cables	greddy	and all your files, right?
2007-03-28T10:57:00.000Z	greddy	cables	 yes in that partition i just have Ubuntu-dapper files .. not any my personal fiels
2007-03-28T10:57:00.000Z	cables	greddy	in that case, you can go ahead and install. You should back up your /home folder, unless it's already on a separate partition, because that contains all your program settings and stuff.
2007-03-28T10:58:00.000Z	greddy	cables	 i am using Redhat linux too.. But using Ubuntu grub. is there any problem if i use edgy on that partition?
2007-03-28T10:59:00.000Z	cables	greddy	probably not
