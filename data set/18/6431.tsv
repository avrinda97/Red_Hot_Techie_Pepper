2009-03-06T01:36:00.000Z	sint		hey, i've reinstalled my system a few weeks back and since then it hangs from time to time. but its not frozen at all, it runs fine, i just can't use keyboard and mouse! but i can login with ssh and do everything.
2009-03-06T01:36:00.000Z	sint		anyone knows how to fix this?
2009-03-06T01:36:00.000Z	daftykins	sint	you tried restarting X from your SSH session when it goes like that?
2009-03-06T01:36:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	ya, works fine
2009-03-06T01:37:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	but X is not really frozen as well, cause i can see incomming messages in chats and stuff
2009-03-06T01:37:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	ya
2009-03-06T01:37:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	just the mouse. i am on a laptop
2009-03-06T01:38:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	i can move the courser but i can't click
2009-03-06T01:38:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	no! both the same
2009-03-06T01:38:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	:(
2009-03-06T01:39:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	is there maybe a logfile i could check?
2009-03-06T01:41:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	ok, i'll check this. but i think its an X issue, cause the system itself is fine and after restarting X its fine again. until crash
2009-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	i will search the internet, maybe someone has the same problem! thanks anyway :)
2009-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	daftykins	sint	check your xorg.conf for any ATI driver configuration and remove it, so it only runs with the VESA driver or some such
2009-04-30T16:11:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	my xorg.conf only contains random stuff. nothing really important, but sections with identifier. thats all
2009-04-30T16:15:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	i did, but maybe i did it wrong. freeze again. i can login with ssh but can't shut down gdm. just a second, i'll try to get it with vesa
2009-04-30T16:15:00.000Z	daftykins	sint	it should happily restart from "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
2009-04-30T16:19:00.000Z	sint	daftykins	it does not, i don't know why
