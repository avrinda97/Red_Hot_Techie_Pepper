2010-08-20T14:45:00.000Z	Renski		Hey all. Im trying to install ubunutu-netbook onto a netbook, which works fine after a little messing around with the wireless card. However, id like to have full disk encryption but all the guide ive read say 'use the alternative install disk'. However thats only for server and desktop ubuntu. How can I get LVM encryption with netbook-ubuntu?
2010-08-20T14:47:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	you can do it by hand, but that's quite a complicated think, I'd rather use the alternate and then re-set the repos afterward to get the x for netbooks back
2010-08-20T14:49:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	yeah, that sounds easier
2010-08-20T14:49:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	if you want to do it by hand, half to do install ubu on one half of disk, then crypt the other half, then copy it over... not worth the work, and also tell grub to use the mapper then, real no quick walk
2010-08-20T14:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	just for a try, didi you try to boot the regular desktop cd (concerning usability of your screen ) ?
2010-08-20T14:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	so check that out first, if you can still get by with scrolling on it, try the textinstaller
2010-08-20T14:52:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	and if your book supports boot from usb, save some disks
2010-08-20T14:52:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	my flat is full of old CD-Rs
2010-08-20T15:02:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	yeah, just working across the room on the netbook
2010-08-20T15:03:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	lucky day, I just do an install by alternate and saw it's got option netbook !!
2010-08-20T15:03:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	Sweet
2010-08-20T15:03:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	I figured it only had desktop
2010-08-20T15:04:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	lates 10.04.1, just d/l  it today.. expert install lets you set just the soft you want, and netbook is a possible option :)
2010-08-20T15:14:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	: yes, /boot remains plain, rest is crypted and done by lvm
2010-08-20T15:15:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	Do you know what form of encryption it uses?
2010-08-20T15:15:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	yes, luks, aes256 in default
2010-08-20T15:15:00.000Z	Renski	DasEi	ah cool, same as true crypt then
2010-08-20T15:16:00.000Z	DasEi	Renski	the aes, yes, but a different way to open partitions (luksopen, whereas tc has it's own syntax)
