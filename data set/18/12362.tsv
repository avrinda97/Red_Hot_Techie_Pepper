2006-11-19T08:34:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	thank you - but why has this change been implimented
2006-11-19T08:35:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	that is to ease the transition to new IDE drivers (which will use /dev/sd* names instead of /dev/hd*), as well as to make things easier when you move drives around IDE slots
2006-11-19T08:35:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	I've noy seen that change on the ata LKML branch
2006-11-19T08:35:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	it's not pointless, although those long UUIDs can be sort of annoying - drives being referenced uniquely rather than by their physical location is a good idea
2006-11-19T08:36:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	it's an Ubuntu change AFAIK
2006-11-19T08:36:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	thanks for the info - that at least explains why I've not seen it on the LibATA kernel branch

2006-11-19T08:40:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	thank you, I'll have a read now
2006-11-19T08:41:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	whoaaa thats a bold move
2006-11-19T08:43:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	honestly i think it was about time we stopped referring to drives based on what end of a cable they happened to be found at. UUIDs don't look that cute, but at least
2006-11-19T08:44:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	I totally see the point, but the letter hd or sd was never determained by the position on the cable, but the actual chip driver, so while I admire the point of removing that distinction, I also don't see the point of making everything /dev/sdX it really didn't matter
2006-11-19T08:47:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	well, skimming through google's hits for kernel lists, it seems to me they're likely to be including that in the mainstream kernel sooner than later, anyway
2006-11-19T08:48:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	possibly, I'v found a debate on it, Alan cox seems keen but Jeff Garitz seems against it
2006-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	well, time will tell... but anyway, i agree with what someone's seems to be saying, i.e. that any app that relies on whether something is called "hda" vs "sda" is a broken app - then in this view, the "bold move" doesn't look too bold anymore
2006-11-19T08:51:00.000Z	mooky	LjL	 I can't argue with that
2007-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	bauer77, goodgerster, etc: please stop this discussion please, or bring it to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	mooky	that's agreed
