2007-10-09T08:05:00.000Z	madnez		ok how about enabling write on partitioned drives?
2007-10-09T08:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	let me get this straight, you have 1 drive, with Windows and Ubuntu, and now you have a second drive, and you want to set it up XP on one drive, and Ubunntu on the other?
2007-10-09T08:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	ko, and how is this different fromw hat i said?
2007-10-09T08:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	i said that
2007-10-09T08:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	why don't you jsut download gparted live, and delete your ubuntu partitions ont eh 80gig drive, and format them as NTFS(thus turning them back over to XP))
2007-10-09T08:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	so let me understand this, you want to keep the partitions on your 80gig drive, but you want to remove Ubuntu?
2007-10-09T08:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	ok, then format the two partitions on the 80gig drive(assuming you have swap and ext3), as ext3, adn Windows will never see them, but they'll be there if you want them
2007-10-09T08:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	no
2007-10-09T08:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	madnez	don't know.
