2007-05-21T05:03:00.000Z	Malachi		How can I edit video tags "Title," "Author," etc
2007-05-21T05:05:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	Look in on the file:   mpgtx
2007-05-21T05:06:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	it's real easy the way I found that info........  I open Synaptic and used the search   :)
2007-05-21T05:07:00.000Z	Malachi		SonsofAtreus: Thanks. I'll try it out
2007-05-21T05:11:00.000Z	Malachi		SonsofAtreus: I'm not sure how it works...
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	see if it opens a gui when you enter mpgtx in a terminal
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	or maybe if it has a link in the menu section
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	Malachi	SonsOfAtreus	It doesn't. It's cln based.
2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	has it got a man page?
2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	Malachi		Yeah
2007-05-21T05:17:00.000Z	Malachi	SonsOfAtreus	All id3 capabilities are for mp3 ;( And it's pretty much for splitting/joining MPGs
2007-05-21T05:17:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	you want what?  dvd? or something else?
2007-05-21T05:18:00.000Z	Malachi		SonsOfAtrues: Have a movie file on hand?
2007-05-21T05:18:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus		malachi, on a dvd disc
2007-05-21T05:18:00.000Z	Malachi	SonsOfAtreus	Nope. I'll just show you. Give me a sec

2007-05-21T05:20:00.000Z	Malachi	SonsOfAtreus	I want to edit that info
2007-05-21T05:25:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Malachi	I would guess there should be a file already loaded that would do something like a key combo to unlock that page
