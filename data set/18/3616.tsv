2009-09-17T21:23:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	you might try reinstalling the ca-certificates package. also, which bios setting did you touch?
2009-09-17T21:25:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	I reset the jumper. How do I reinstall the certs?
2009-09-17T21:26:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	all my borwsers are borken. I have no SSL support. Cnat log in to anything
2009-09-17T21:26:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates
2009-09-17T21:27:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	prefixed with sudo, of course
2009-09-17T22:03:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	tricky problem. what time does your computer think it is? (date and time)
2009-09-17T22:04:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	well, it varies... FF tells me one thing, but then one of my addons say another... let me check.
2009-09-17T22:05:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	Okay, Surfcanyon says that the cert is invalid until 2/11/09 6:00 PM
2009-09-17T22:06:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	okay, but what is the current time and date of your system?
2009-09-17T22:06:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	Come to think of it... I did take out my RAM to give my board a cleaning-dusty- perhaps I put them back into the wrong slots? WOuld that cause this?
2009-09-17T22:06:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	Sept 17, 12:06pm. And I had to set it there, because I reset the mobo jumper(hardware installation problems)
2009-09-17T22:07:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	2009? (that's not an idle question...)
2009-09-17T22:07:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	Yes... 2009.
2009-09-17T22:09:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	hmm. i'm going to have to mull this over. unfortunately, it's the end of the day for me; best of luck getting your problem sorted (it's quite a head-scratcher)
2009-09-17T22:10:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	Um... I think i just fixed it... I went to about:config and looked thigns over. I saw that browser.xul.error_pages.enabled was set to false.
2009-09-17T22:10:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	and how did that happen?
2009-09-17T22:11:00.000Z	sipior	Quasar1048	bizarre...well, file it away for next time i suppose...
2009-09-17T22:12:00.000Z	Quasar1048	sipior	Yeah, will do... I was wondering... because the error seemed so silly to me, haha. Thanks for the help anyway!
