2010-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	right, can you pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l please
2010-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	right, give me a sec
2010-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	made a mount point?
2010-01-23T09:31:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	okay, well where do you want to mount the partitions? Normally I would create a folder like /media/oldfolder
2010-01-23T09:32:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	and so for your first fstab line it would be UUID=AC88BCB688BC807E /media/oldcomputer ntfs defaults 0 0
2010-01-23T09:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	sure, if you are not sure feel free to paste your entire fstab after
2010-01-23T09:36:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	ziroday	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m5b91ef4
2010-01-23T09:37:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	looks perfect
2010-01-23T09:38:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	ziroday	what about for the other one? :P
2010-01-23T09:38:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	well similar thing, just change out the UUID, mount point and possibly filesystem. Feel free to go ahead and then pastebin when you are done
2010-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	ziroday	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m5c6f2906
2010-01-23T09:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	err why are you trying to mount the drive that is running ubuntu?
2010-01-23T09:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	err I would double check your UUID's on that last one
2010-01-23T09:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Screamo_Smurf	it appears you're trying to mount the same drive twice
2010-01-23T09:50:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	ziroday	UUID=91a46e4b-4651-4b1d-a2a1-2c0e833c555e /media/ubuntu ext4 defaults 0 0
