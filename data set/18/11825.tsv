2007-06-25T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	did you install it to ~/.mplayer/skins ?
2007-06-25T07:24:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	you create it
2007-06-25T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	stick to putting things in your HOME until you are more comfortable
2007-06-25T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	what did you install using apt-get?
2007-06-25T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	that installs the skins, it doesn't have any tar.gz
2007-06-25T07:29:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	go to your home directory, view -> show hidden files, go to .mplayer (create it if it does not exist), then inside go to "skins" (create it if it does not exist).  Then extract in here
2007-06-25T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	close mplayer and start it again
2007-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	Cain_UnAbel	join me in #ubuntu-classroom
