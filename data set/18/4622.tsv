2009-11-14T02:45:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	excuse me? Im trying to enable directX by using Wine's OpenGL wrapper or something like that... So i can use Aero and other fancy stuff
2009-11-14T02:45:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	well i did install that stuff, but havent tried it out yet
2009-11-14T02:47:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	yeh
2009-11-14T02:47:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	how did you install it? I cant get admin privileges any way
2009-11-14T02:48:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	drop to safe mode and install
2009-11-14T02:51:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	i have, but i still have 'access denied' !
2009-11-14T02:51:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	from safe mode also
2009-11-14T02:52:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	in windows?
2009-11-14T02:52:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	what do you mean? I run virtualbox and start windows in safe mode. yes
2009-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	do you get access denied inside the windows host
2009-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	im not sure what you mean, but i think yes, access denied if from within the windows os.
2009-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	dunno then, you should have the proper rights in safe mode
2009-11-14T02:55:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	what OS do you run in vbox, windows 7?
2009-11-14T02:56:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	not yet :(, just windows XP atm
2009-11-14T02:56:00.000Z	lovre	acicula	that may be the reason why...
2009-11-14T02:56:00.000Z	acicula	lovre	it very well may be :)
