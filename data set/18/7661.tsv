2008-01-10T19:52:00.000Z	viking		where do I change my startup script?
2008-01-10T19:54:00.000Z	viking		need to add emerald themes to my startup =P
2008-01-10T19:55:00.000Z	viking		got to add 'compiz --replace' and 'emerald --replace' to my startup script so emerald themes will start all the time... I just need to know the location and name of my actual startup script
2008-01-10T19:56:00.000Z	viking		good idea... I will check with them.  Thanks
2008-01-10T19:56:00.000Z	crdlb	viking	why do you need to do that? just use system > preferences > apperarance > visual effects
2008-01-10T19:58:00.000Z	viking	crdlb	I am having a hard time finding themes for ubuntu... so I was just gonna use the emerald onces.
2008-01-10T19:58:00.000Z	viking		ones*
2008-01-10T19:58:00.000Z	crdlb	viking	with emerald installed, the compiz wrapper automatically uses emerald instead of gtk-window-decorator
2008-01-10T19:58:00.000Z	crdlb		upon restart of compiz
2008-01-10T19:59:00.000Z	viking		oh... that I did not know...
2008-01-10T19:59:00.000Z	viking	crdlb	I did not see it use a emerald theme until I used the command 'compiz --replace -c emerald &'
2008-01-10T20:00:00.000Z	crdlb	viking	that's only with trevinho's repo
2008-01-10T20:00:00.000Z	viking		oh... is there another one I need to be getting?
2008-01-10T20:01:00.000Z	crdlb	viking	that's what you're using now?
2008-01-10T20:02:00.000Z	viking	crdlb	I am using compiz-fusion. I am not sure exactly one you mean by trevinho;s repository.
2008-01-10T20:02:00.000Z	crdlb	viking	in gutsy?
2008-01-10T20:02:00.000Z	viking		yes in gutsy
2008-01-10T20:03:00.000Z	crdlb	viking	that command you gave with the '-c emerald' is only required with a repo you're not using
