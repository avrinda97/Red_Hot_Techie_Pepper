2011-06-18T01:32:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		hey guys, im rather new to ubuntu and i was wondering if there is a easy GUI frontend that can be "bolted" to any termial program
2011-06-18T01:33:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		like for example, slapping a GUI ontop of Diablo the bitcoin miner and have all the options listed as a check list
2011-06-18T01:33:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		and the outcome can be written in plain english, before you execute
2011-06-18T01:33:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	wouldnt be to hard to write one with zenity i guess...
2011-06-18T01:34:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		do you think that would be a good program for new users? ones that are bad at writing out commands?
2011-06-18T01:34:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		like me
2011-06-18T01:35:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	zenity is a tool for scripting frontends. but you still have to script it. then you could hand it out to friends
2011-06-18T01:35:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		hmmmm what language?
2011-06-18T01:35:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	shell
2011-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	you'd write a shell script that calls into zenity to say "make a checkbox!" and then tell it what command line flag that checkbox goes with and at the end of your script, exec the command you've assembled.... should be possible
2011-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	but MagicallyMakeGUIForCmd $cmd      that doesnt exist
2011-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		i think i will give that a shot, because Diablo miner would be 1000x easyer if there was a front hend
2011-06-18T01:37:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		hell most everything is awkward in the terminal for me
2011-06-18T01:37:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_	scriptwarlock	hi dr nick!
2011-06-18T01:37:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	if zenity's not powerful enough, pygtk and pyqt are also both fairly easy to use (and ubuntu's Quickly project makes it easy to get started with rapid app development)
2011-06-18T01:38:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		ill copy their names down.
2011-06-18T01:38:00.000Z	PwnusMaximus_		is PYQT a fork of QT?
2011-06-18T01:38:00.000Z	maco	PwnusMaximus_	its the python bindings for Qt
