2008-02-01T05:43:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	avahi is a zero configuration service for netwrok discovery. i don't think you absolutely need it, but it's what is used to automatically detect network shares and printers
2008-02-01T05:44:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	Automatically detect network shares? Isn't that samba?
2008-02-01T05:45:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)
2008-02-01T05:46:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	Yeah I was reading that,I swear. but I have no idea what multicatst DNS/DNS-SD is, nor do I even know if I use it. I just know it runs in the background
2008-02-01T05:46:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	And I don't want to remove it just in case it's some vital pillar keeping my network connection afloat
2008-02-01T05:47:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	samba is used to communicate with windows network shares. avahi is a general system. i wouldn't remove it because apparently it integrated with gnomes VFS
2008-02-01T05:47:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	I don't use gnome, though. I installed a cli system and installed fluxbox on top
2008-02-01T05:48:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	then you probably don't need it. it's used by KDE and gnome, but if you use another system for network discovery (like manually adding network shares) then it doesn't really matter.
2008-02-01T05:49:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	I don't even think I 'add network shares' at all.
2008-02-01T05:50:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	here is a much better description of what exactly avahi does: http://avahi.org/
2008-02-01T05:52:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	I was reading that before, and it was just a tad over my head. I know it's for discovering computers on the network now, but I don't think I've ever done that outside of samba. I guess I can't imagine a situation in which it would be used
2008-02-01T05:54:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	imagine you had a network attached printer to your router. avahi would be the one to recognize the printer automatically so that it can be added to CUPS. Same with a NAS deviced attached to your local network
2008-02-01T05:55:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	I see. And how would the NAS device be recognized? If the printer is recognized with cups, that is... also avahi = dbus, just over the network?
2008-02-01T05:55:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	rpj8	basically. it's like dbus for the network. actually, i think it might pass to dbus, not sure. haven't buried deep enough to find out really
2008-02-01T05:56:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	I read that it does, indeed, pass to dbus
2008-02-01T05:56:00.000Z	rpj8	jeffMASTERflex	I apologize for my quizing. I swear I read these man pages, but sometimes the things in them are just over my head... I need like, a situation specific example for these programs in order to understand what they are haha
