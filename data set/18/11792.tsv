2009-05-16T21:53:00.000Z	space_cadet		i need to launch a dialog box from CLI without installing anything
2009-05-16T21:54:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	your question makes no sense...
2009-05-16T21:54:00.000Z	space_cadet		really
2009-05-16T21:54:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	ya you said you dont want to install anything, but then you list your kernel... obviously you installed something
2009-05-16T21:55:00.000Z	space_cadet		must I state the obvious?
2009-05-16T21:55:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	its not just that
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	what application are you trying to configure?
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	space_cadet		i want to display a dialog box from STOCK ubuntu 9.04
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	space_cadet		from the CLI
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	your question still makes no sense
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	space_cadet	jbmigel	i don't want to configure a program
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	how are you going to display a dialog box in cli... ever/
2009-05-16T21:56:00.000Z	space_cadet	jbmigel	i want to display a dialog box
2009-05-16T21:57:00.000Z	space_cadet	jbmigel	not configure a program
2009-05-16T21:57:00.000Z	jbmigel	space_cadet	the CLI does not have dialog boxes... thats madness... you need X and stuff
2009-05-16T21:57:00.000Z	space_cadet	jbmigel	please stop trolling
2009-05-16T21:57:00.000Z	space_cadet	jbmigel	yes but the terminal works in x
