2008-09-16T03:45:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	i would suggest setting up LAMP the 'ubuntu way' :)
2008-09-16T03:46:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	/msg ubottu !lamp
2008-09-16T03:42:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	 sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
2008-09-16T03:43:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	everything just mentioned is already in the repos
2008-09-16T03:44:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	well, you'll have to source support for this lampp package from the author/vendor - we can only really support ubuntu packages/setups here
2008-09-16T03:44:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	for what it's worth, if you setup LAMP as per the howto for ubuntu - you won't need to enter a password
2008-09-16T03:47:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	because we can then support it in here .. and it will work quite simply
2008-09-16T03:48:00.000Z	unop	Pnux	your choice - but we can't really support what you have - so anything further on it is offtopic
