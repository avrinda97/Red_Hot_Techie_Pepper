2010-02-08T23:50:00.000Z	Garnasha		*drops back into the convo* you're a Python user, trism?
2010-02-08T23:50:00.000Z	trism	Garnasha	yes, what's up?
2010-02-08T23:51:00.000Z	Garnasha		I have a problem where python 3 under ubuntu 9.10 freezes up my keyboard
2010-02-08T23:51:00.000Z	trism	Garnasha	ahh, I haven't migrated to python 3 yet, too lazy to port all my scripts
2010-02-08T23:51:00.000Z	Garnasha		easy to fix by clicking anywhere outside the window, but it happens everytime an argument list tooltip closes
2010-02-08T23:52:00.000Z	Garnasha		and, as you know, those tend to open and close quite a lot
2010-02-08T23:52:00.000Z	trism	Garnasha	is this in idle?
2010-02-08T23:52:00.000Z	Garnasha	Trek	I'm almost certain it's a bug
2010-02-08T23:52:00.000Z	Garnasha		yes
2010-02-08T23:53:00.000Z	Garnasha		IDLE for Python 3
2010-02-08T23:53:00.000Z	Garnasha		didn't do that under 9.4 either
2010-02-08T23:53:00.000Z	Garnasha		for a bug report you need to list a package right?
2010-02-08T23:53:00.000Z	Garnasha		anyway, wanted to ask here in case I was being stupid about something
2010-02-08T23:54:00.000Z	Garnasha		installing IDLE gets you about 4 packages
2010-02-08T23:55:00.000Z	Garnasha		and I wouldn't know which contains the bug
2010-02-08T23:55:00.000Z	Garnasha		on top of that, maybe it isn't even IDLE that's bugging up but some obscure package it uses
2010-02-08T23:56:00.000Z	Garnasha		so basically, I want to file a bug report but don't know what to put in it
2010-02-08T23:56:00.000Z	trism	Garnasha	it would be best to file it against idle, you may want to try another ide while you're at it though
