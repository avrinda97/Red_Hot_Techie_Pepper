2005-02-21T16:54:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb	bloggs	thanks, i disabled it yesterday, but it took weeks to discover those were related

2005-02-21T16:54:00.000Z	bloggs	mjt	- whoosh, in English please :)

2005-02-21T16:57:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		[Spooky]  if i remember correctly, yes

2005-02-21T16:57:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		[Spooky]  apt-get install openssl    and then man enc
2005-02-21T16:58:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		It does symmetrical encryption and decryption in all  supported algos
2005-02-21T16:59:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		then man enc
2005-02-21T17:00:00.000Z	bloggs	mjt	- The guide basically says that in firefox address box type "about:config" and you get heaps of firefox options - find "network.dns.disableIPv6" and set it to true.
2005-02-21T17:03:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		[Spooky]  openssl enc commands
2005-02-21T17:04:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		[Spooky]  from the man page: The program can be called either as openssl ciphername or openssl enc
2005-02-21T17:04:00.000Z	Guybrush|Numb		       -ciphername.
