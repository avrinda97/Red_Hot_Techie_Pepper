2006-10-06T05:32:00.000Z	airox		Hello.
2006-10-06T05:33:00.000Z	airox		I'm using Ubuntu right now and am wanted to know if there is a way of opening files with the application that's normally used for it but as root.
2006-10-06T05:33:00.000Z	airox		Right now the only way I can open files that I can't access is by using some console commands.
2006-10-06T05:33:00.000Z	airox		I want something like: "Open as root"
2006-10-06T05:34:00.000Z	airox		Is there some nautilus script for it ?
2006-10-06T05:34:00.000Z	airox		Ubuntu should do this by default imho.
2006-10-06T05:34:00.000Z	timalot	airox	well ive got a "edit as root" nautilus script.... but i dont know about the file assoc... thing
2006-10-06T05:35:00.000Z	airox		Woulnd't it be a great idea that if the files aren't readable to place a gksudo nautilius script in between ?
2006-10-06T05:35:00.000Z	airox		So someone can edit and maybe even browse the whole filesystem.
2006-10-06T05:35:00.000Z	airox		Or open a file etc.
2006-10-06T05:36:00.000Z	airox	timalot	That would be a self installed script I guess ?
2006-10-06T05:38:00.000Z	timalot	airox	yes... i found the command now... if u use the command gnome-open <file> then it will open it withe the associated program ... use this with gksudo ... to do what u want
2006-10-06T05:38:00.000Z	airox	timalot	Exactly.
2006-10-06T05:38:00.000Z	airox		It would be nice to put a gksudo gnome-open on every file or folder that isn't readable.
2006-10-06T05:38:00.000Z	airox		So users CAN browse and edit.
2006-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	airox		I wonder how much work this would be.
2006-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	airox		Sounds like a small script :)
2006-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	timalot	airox	just use a nuatilus script....
