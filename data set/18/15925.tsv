2004-12-28T08:47:00.000Z	abrotman		If the liveCD goes right to grub, am i out of luck?
2004-12-28T08:47:00.000Z	abrotman		It's a laptop
2004-12-28T08:47:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	you should be able to do what you need from grub, though it's only geek-friendly.  what's the issue?  why would you be "out of luck"?
2004-12-28T08:48:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	well .. i'm not a grub person .. normally lilo
2004-12-28T08:48:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	the issue is i'm assuming the kernel doesn't have some driver to use the CD drive
2004-12-28T08:48:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	the CD works fine .. tested in another machine
2004-12-28T08:49:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	if you type 'c' at the grub menu, you'll get a grub prompt, from which you can set your kernel boot string (including parameters) and anything else.
2004-12-28T08:49:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	ok .. do you what it would be? ..
2004-12-28T08:51:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	i'm basically trying to debug a wifi nic .. i think warty has the madwifi drivers
2004-12-28T08:51:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	and i'm at the grub prompt .. but i don't know the line for the kernel(as i said .. i'm more of a lilo person)
2004-12-28T08:51:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	hoary has the madwifi drivers, too, though (for some odd reason) i haven't gotten them to work.  !!
2004-12-28T08:52:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	right - I'm trying to find a grub conf file online that you can look at, so I don't paste junk in here.
2004-12-28T08:52:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	ok
2004-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	(assuming you can browse...): http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/topic-132.html
2004-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	see the 'kernel' line under # Linux OS
2004-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	moquist	abrotman	aw, hell.  pm.
2004-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	but how would i know which device the CD drive is?
2004-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	abrotman	moquist	ok
