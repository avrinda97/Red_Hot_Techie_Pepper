2007-03-10T13:25:00.000Z	AlexC_	_F00BaR	we install software differently in Linux, we don't go to websites and downloading random files, and double clicking on them.
2007-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	AlexC_	_F00BaR	we have a central 'repository' system, that you can access thousands of software by going to "System-->Admin->Synaptic"
