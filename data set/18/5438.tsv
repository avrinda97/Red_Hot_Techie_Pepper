2008-12-27T14:07:00.000Z	KillerOrca		Is there a full-proof way to clone a ubuntu install from one HDD to another?
2008-12-27T14:08:00.000Z	KillerOrca		well I can't boot with both HDDs installed, and I can't seem to run a livecd that has mount and rsync
2008-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	you can install rsync on the live cd
2008-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	but ive never really heard of a live cd that lacks mount...
2008-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	KillerOrca	maco	I can't run a normal livecd, had to install with alternate
2008-12-27T14:27:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	yes
2008-12-27T14:28:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	believe so
2008-12-27T14:31:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	yes
2008-12-27T14:31:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	but!
2008-12-27T14:31:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	if you have thing on your panel that arent installed by default, youll get errors in gnome tilyou install them
2008-12-27T14:32:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	i suggest using "dpkg --get-selections >> packages.list" on the old machine and "dpkg --set-selections < packages.list" on the new machine, then install and run "sudo dselect" and tell it to install. itll reinstall everything you had before. do that from a terminal before logging into gnome
2008-12-27T14:32:00.000Z	KillerOrca	maco	what about things like window managers and stuff? I messsed around with blackbox and am still using it
2008-12-27T14:33:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	whatver you have set to run by default when you login ought to be installed when you first login if you want to avoid errors
2008-12-27T14:33:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	yeah its fine just listen
2008-12-27T14:34:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	that dpkg stuff i said will make whats installed on the new one match what was on the old one
2008-12-27T14:34:00.000Z	KillerOrca	maco	what about the configurations I've made, how do I keep those?
2008-12-27T14:35:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	if theyre for your user, they are in your home directory
2008-12-27T14:35:00.000Z	maco	KillerOrca	if they're for the system, theyre in /etc
