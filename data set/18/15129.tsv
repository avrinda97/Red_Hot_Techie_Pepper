2007-03-12T09:15:00.000Z	Merlin_		hey - can anyone help me change my WM? I'm in the gnome default and I'd like to move to Ion3.
2007-03-12T09:16:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: if you don't know how to use Ion, then Ion is not for you.
2007-03-12T09:16:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	I've used it for six months on my gentoo box.
2007-03-12T09:16:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	I've also tried editing and modifying my ~/.xinitrc
2007-03-12T09:17:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: then what problem do you have? Just create a startup entry for it
2007-03-12T09:17:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	which did *not* work.
2007-03-12T09:17:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: gdm doesn't read .xinitrc
2007-03-12T09:17:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	the problem is I do not know ubuntu. and the gdm config program doesn't run.
2007-03-12T09:18:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	so how do I configure gdm by hand?
2007-03-12T09:18:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: you have to look under /usr/whatever/folder where the desktop entries are stored for gdm to list
2007-03-12T09:22:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: its /etc/xsessions/
2007-03-12T09:23:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: just model a new entry after the exisiting ones, and make it launch your xterms and what not, and finally the Ion wm
2007-03-12T09:23:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: works like a .xinitrc
2007-03-12T09:23:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: the Exec= entry is your ".xinitrc" script, which can be anything.
2007-03-12T09:25:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	seems an ion3.desktopo entry is already there.
2007-03-12T09:26:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: then the entry is in some way incorrect, if it's not listed on the gdm session chooser menu
2007-03-12T09:27:00.000Z	leafw	Merlin_	: in any case, you can always use a different tty and run startx manually. And sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop to get rid of it (I do, for dwm)
2007-03-12T09:29:00.000Z	Merlin_	leafw	trying something.
