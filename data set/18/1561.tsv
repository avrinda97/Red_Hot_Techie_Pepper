2011-01-19T19:46:00.000Z	RaidZoft		not working on the same desktop
2011-01-19T19:47:00.000Z	RaidZoft		so what is it? I'll go google it
2011-01-19T19:47:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	you're looking for something like NXmachine
2011-01-19T19:48:00.000Z	RaidZoft	mbeierl	does that have windows clients?
2011-01-19T19:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	http://www.nomachine.com/  there's a free version which installs as a service
2011-01-19T19:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	YES!
2011-01-19T19:48:00.000Z	RaidZoft		awesome then I'll check that out
2011-01-19T19:48:00.000Z	RaidZoft		ty
2011-01-19T19:49:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	post #5 on the thread from s3r3n1t7 mentions freenx - the nomachine I was talking about
2011-01-19T19:49:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	BUT... I think the free version restricts you to two simultaneous logins
2011-01-19T19:50:00.000Z	RaidZoft		2 logins would be fine
2011-01-19T19:50:00.000Z	RaidZoft		I need 1 local login and 1 remote login
2011-01-19T19:50:00.000Z	RaidZoft		separate from eachother, of course
2011-01-19T19:53:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	it also has the advantage of being able to disconnect the session and leave it running in the background until you come back for it.  XDMP will kill your session if you attempt to do that
2011-01-19T19:53:00.000Z	RaidZoft	mbeierl	ah yeah that is a requirement for my needs that the session keeps running
2011-01-19T19:53:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	this should get you started: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
2011-01-19T19:55:00.000Z	RaidZoft	mbeierl	ty, I'll be back if I get stuck ;P
2011-01-19T19:55:00.000Z	mbeierl	RaidZoft	it's a good product.  I've used it before.  Good luck!
