2006-10-02T12:57:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		Why are people trying edgy?
2006-10-02T12:57:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		Isn't it just being tested now?
2006-10-02T12:57:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	people are impatient. It's human nature :-)
2006-10-02T12:57:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	as soon as I go back home, I'm upgrading to edgy too :-)
2006-10-02T12:58:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	besides, it's only by "people trying edgy" that it can be tested
2006-10-02T12:58:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	what's buggy with dapper?
2006-10-02T13:01:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	sound worked fine for me out-of-the-box. So it's probably "hardware support" that's buggy, and that will always remain so. There is only so much linux developers can reverse-engineer if the hardware mfrs don't release drivers for linux (or even specs on what their hardware does)
2006-10-02T13:03:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	who knows? maybe people are trying edgy because this thing is fixed in edgy? ;-)
2006-10-02T16:27:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	what deb do you want?
2006-10-02T16:28:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	it's usually not a good idea to compile anything, unless you're sure it's not there in any repo (or it's a program you wrote ;-))
2006-10-02T16:28:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	ok, so dpkg -i will install the .deb
2006-10-02T16:29:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	at least, there is no other way to do it :-)
2006-10-02T16:29:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	try it and see. It's the only way to install a .deb, so ....
2006-10-02T16:29:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	it won't appear in synaptic
2006-10-02T16:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	synaptic is for managing/downloading/installing the packages that *are* in the repos
2006-10-02T16:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	dpkg -i will exit without printing any errors :-)
2006-10-02T16:34:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	what's last exit, BTW?
2006-10-02T16:39:00.000Z	hastesaver	Sktfeelsdapper	why doesn't last.fm work?
