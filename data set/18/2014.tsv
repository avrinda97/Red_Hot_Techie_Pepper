2010-09-20T13:45:00.000Z	MissingPerson	airtonix	lol, i had no problems between feisty to gutsy, but since then i have had a score of problems.
2010-09-20T13:45:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	you might like to make your /home on a separate partition this time round so that clean is not so imposing
2010-09-20T13:46:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	i assume you know the easy way to specify that home goes on a separate partition during clean install ?
2010-09-20T13:48:00.000Z	MissingPerson	airtonix	have no clue on how to specify.
2010-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	the stage where you choose how the drive will be partitioned, choose advanced and then you create a partition (a large one) and say that this partition will mount at /home...
2010-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	MissingPerson	airtonix	how big would you suggest to make root?
2010-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	then next time you do clean isntall, go the same route partitions > advanced : you should see the existing large partition which you just need to say that it will mount at /home (and not to format it)
2010-09-20T13:50:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	through my five years, i've found that it depends on what you do with your machines, generally i recommend that you put aside 15gb (since there are some sections on the root that get used for some large files if you dont put those directories on their own partition also)
2010-09-20T13:51:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	but if you run a dev server (mysql, apache, etc etc) then you will want to think about putting /var on its own partition also (with about 30gb for it )
2010-09-20T13:51:00.000Z	MissingPerson	airtonix	mainly i use it for desktop work, word processing, graphics, video editing, gaming (wine), and web browsing
2010-09-20T13:52:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	you should be ok with : swap (2gb) / (15gb) /home (the rest)
2010-09-20T13:53:00.000Z	MissingPerson	airtonix	and that would leave enough space for multiple DEs?  I switch from Gnome/*box/KDE occasionally?
2010-09-20T13:54:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	default gnome only install is happy with 5gb if you know exactly what you need to install. if you want more DE and you think you might start installing just about every thing , then you really want enough space for the entire repo (which is around 20-30gb)
2010-09-20T13:54:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	reason why i mention 15gb is that over a long period of time, log files, and deb files etc build up
2010-09-20T13:55:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	23gb should be good.
2010-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	MissingPerson	airtonix	command to do that?
2010-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	airtonix	MissingPerson	have a look at commandlinefu.com
