2008-11-12T14:35:00.000Z	laurent9238		I can't start mysqld
2008-11-12T14:36:00.000Z	laurent9238		tried reinstalling with different methods (dpkg, etc) but it didn't work
2008-11-12T14:36:00.000Z	laurent9238		if someone can take a look please : http://rafb.net/p/WI1Xbp39.html
2008-11-12T14:37:00.000Z	laurent9238		I read many forums for that issue but can't get it to work
2008-11-12T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	run the /etc/init.d/mysql-server start script and see what the error is
2008-11-12T14:39:00.000Z	laurent9238	ikonia	: mysql-server doesn't exists, but when I try /etc/init.d/mysql-server start it says "fail"
2008-11-12T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	type stop
2008-11-12T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	now try start
2008-11-12T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	don't forget to use sudo
2008-11-12T14:40:00.000Z	laurent9238	ikonia	: yes I use, thanks :)
2008-11-12T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	ok, so open the msql-server script and walk through the "start" commands manually to see what the issue is
2008-11-12T14:42:00.000Z	laurent9238	ikonia	: ok, how I do it ? where do I find the script ?
2008-11-12T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	you know where it is - /etc/initd
2008-11-12T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	laurent9238	you know where it is - /etc/init.d
2008-11-12T14:43:00.000Z	laurent9238	ikonia	: yes, sorry I di'nt realized it was a script :)
2008-11-12T15:02:00.000Z	laurent9238	ikonia	: can't get it to work, nevermind, I delete everything and reinstall it from scratch...
