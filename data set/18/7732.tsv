2009-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	what's the issue ?
2009-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	the oracle client is nothing to do with php
2009-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	or do you mean the oracle RDBMS extentions for php
2009-08-21T01:48:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	the drive oci8 is not working when I try to connect
2009-08-21T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	I suggest trying to connect using the Oracle client first to make sure you have a valid platform to connect from
2009-08-21T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	what is the error you get then you try to connect
2009-08-21T01:50:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	Fatal error: Call to undefined function oci_connect()
2009-08-21T01:51:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	php_oci8.so in on /ext directory ok
2009-08-21T01:51:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	what do you mean on /ext directory ?
2009-08-21T01:52:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	the php extensions directory
2009-08-21T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	that looks like an Oracle 8 client library
2009-08-21T01:53:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	what is your extensions directory full path
2009-08-21T01:53:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	is /usr/lib/php5/extension/
2009-08-21T01:55:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	is the client libarary Oracle 8 ?
2009-08-21T01:55:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	is instantcliente 11.1
2009-08-21T01:55:00.000Z	spynes	ikonia	oci8 is a generic name
2009-08-21T01:56:00.000Z	ikonia	spynes	not used the 11 client, 8,9.10 only, I know there was problems connecting from 8 clients to 10 database, hence my question
