2009-04-04T23:23:00.000Z	ibeekman		how can I get openssl-0.9.8j  ?
2009-04-04T23:24:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	what version is in the repos?
2009-04-04T23:26:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	if it's an important fix it will show up in the regular repos.. you could try find a package with the newer version but it's not recommended
2009-04-04T23:40:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	I need openssl-0.9.8j in order to connect to the clusters I need to work on.
2009-04-04T23:41:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	then you either get the source directly and compile or find a packaged version.. have you checked what jaunty uses?
2009-04-04T23:43:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	packages.ubuntu.com would be one way
2009-04-04T23:46:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	no openssl-0.9.8j in any ubuntu packages
2009-04-04T23:46:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	for any distros
2009-04-04T23:47:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	maybe I should go to the debian website and check there?
2009-04-04T23:47:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	then you would have to download the source and compile it yourself.. you'll have to take care of updates, keep up to date on security issues and such yourself after that, ubuntu cannot update stuff you've compiled yourself
2009-04-04T23:47:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	debian packages shouldn't really be installed on an ubuntu system.. there might be differences and if stuff stops working it might be hard to find out why
2009-04-04T23:48:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	so no hope of finding a package somewhere?  The security stuff should be OK, I need it to connec t to some very powerful machines so if a vulnerability is found they will make me upgrade (probably by hand again before anyone packages it :(
2009-04-04T23:49:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	the DoD has an rpm of the package I need but I don't think that will help me on Ubuntu...
2009-04-04T23:50:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	the internet is a big place.. but if you're being security concious you really shouldn't trust some 3rd party to build your software
2009-04-04T23:50:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	rpms can be more problems than they're worth..
2009-04-04T23:51:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	download the source, read the instructions, compile, install http://www.openssl.org/source/
2009-04-04T23:51:00.000Z	ibeekman	Slart	that's been my experience..... well I'll be wary and probably end up building from source
2009-04-04T23:51:00.000Z	Slart	ibeekman	good luck
