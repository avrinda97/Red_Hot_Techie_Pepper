2006-05-13T08:16:00.000Z	graft		why is your computer crippled, sp3tt?
2006-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	graft		he's reinstalling because X doesn't work?
2006-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	graft		that seems highly unnecessary
2006-05-13T08:19:00.000Z	sp3tt	graft	because the crappy os known as ubuntu can't start x?
2006-05-13T08:19:00.000Z	graft	sp3tt	i'm sure we can get X working, no problem... did you pastebin your X log file somewhere?
2006-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	sp3tt		No.
2006-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	graft		why don't you do that, then :P
2006-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	graft		ah
2006-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	graft		ah well
2006-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	graft		in the future i'd merely advise more patience with trivial problems
2006-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	sp3tt	graft	because it is quite, gone?
2006-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	sp3tt		A computer so messed up it won't boot is hardly a trivial problem.
2006-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	graft		not being able to run X is not the same as not booting
2006-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	graft		X is a single application, and the fact that it won't run is probably due to simple misconfiguration
2006-05-13T08:22:00.000Z	graft		or possibly incorrect or missing drivers for your video card
2006-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	graft		yeah, vesa ought to have worked... although maybe you need fb support in the kernel
2006-05-13T08:25:00.000Z	sp3tt	graft	it is, when x kills your keyboard.
2006-05-13T08:27:00.000Z	graft	sp3tt	no, it's not... booting has a very specific meaning, and your problem is not the same as 'not booting'
