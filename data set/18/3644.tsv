2009-08-27T12:45:00.000Z	innomen5		ahh ok
2009-08-27T12:45:00.000Z	innomen5		can i just uninstall it? is that possible/ will that work?
2009-08-27T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	that will work also, yes
2009-08-27T12:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	the file needs a .conf ending
2009-08-27T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	if you READ the error it is referencing /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrappe
2009-08-27T12:59:00.000Z	innomen5	ActionParsnip	yea i READ the error, look if you think i'm a moron and you're wasting your time, don't help ne, it's cool man
2009-08-27T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	well you gave me an error then start talking about someother file, it doesnt make sense
2009-08-27T13:00:00.000Z	innomen5	ActionParsnip	i pasted you the exact error it gave me in responce ot the command you gave me to type (sudo modprobe ath9k)
2009-08-27T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	yes and the error which was outputted stated a specific filename needs the extension
2009-08-27T13:01:00.000Z	innomen5	ActionParsnip	then you told me something vague about some "file" need a .conf i dont see a spesific filename i see a directory
2009-08-27T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	all the files in /etc/modprobe.d are files
2009-08-27T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	i just hate when people only look at the screen but dont read, there is a difference
2009-08-27T13:04:00.000Z	innomen5	ActionParsnip	well i can read pretty fast, so i read it, i just wasnt born with this knowleged in my head like a bee knowing how to fly :)
2009-08-27T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	sudo mv  /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper  /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.conf
2009-08-27T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	nice randomness. i applaud :)
2009-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	innomen5	if its uneeded then sure
2009-08-27T13:07:00.000Z	innomen5	ActionParsnip	no i'm saying i did uninstallit and the error mention a folder named wrapper, no biggie i'll brb
2009-08-27T13:11:00.000Z	innomen5	ActionParsnip	ok mod probe completed (i guess)
