2009-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	mrh		Hi all - Bittorrent keeps crashing my system. What should I do?
2009-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	are you using transmission?
2009-05-13T09:35:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	I was, and switched to ktorrent, but, it has done it again
2009-05-13T09:35:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	does it give a specific error message?
2009-05-13T09:36:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	No, the system simply locks up all the way, even the clock
2009-05-13T09:36:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	for any torrent?
2009-05-13T09:36:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	yeah
2009-05-13T09:36:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	or it seems that way anyway, real hit and miss
2009-05-13T09:39:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	you could try uninstalling and reinstalling maybe? sudo apt-get --purge remove ktorrent (this purge will remove all configuration files too)
2009-05-13T09:39:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	I have considered it, however, I did just that for transmission, and . . .
2009-05-13T09:39:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	I guess it is one of its components
2009-05-13T09:41:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	did you try removing the hidden files/folders that it uses for your account (then when it launches it will recreate them)
2009-05-13T09:41:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	hmmm, well, I used the CL command you suggested when I removed transmission
2009-05-13T09:42:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	think I will check and see if those are gone
2009-05-13T09:42:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	well, there's a difference between the configuration files that the app stores in /etc/ (usually) and the files it stores for your account username (usually /home/username/.hiddenfolder  ) or whatnot
2009-05-13T09:43:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	I see, I thought purge would take care of all those,I will look into this
2009-05-13T09:43:00.000Z	mrh	firefly2442	thanks friend
2009-05-13T09:43:00.000Z	firefly2442	mrh	np, good luck
