2008-01-27T12:07:00.000Z	Askato		im currently booting ubuntu from usb its not that hard
2008-01-27T12:07:00.000Z	Askato		but limited space
2008-01-27T12:09:00.000Z	Askato		does anyone know if it is possible to install apps to a drive other than the one ubuntu is installed on?
2008-01-27T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	  Proberly not very easially.   You could always mount /usr or other dirs on the other hd.
2008-01-27T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 ive seen some live cd disrtos that can do that however. :)
2008-01-27T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 Well you may be 'stuck' you need to do sudo chmod +s /whatever/sudo I think... :) but you cant do that.. bnecause its not suid
2008-01-27T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 sets the Suid bit.
2008-01-27T12:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 with the 'sudo chmod +s whatever' command.
2008-01-27T12:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 but you will need to do it from a livecd most likely
2008-01-27T12:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 of course there may be other programs that should of been 'suid' that are now not...
2008-01-27T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 lets ask this.. HOW did you copy your /usr over to the new hd?
2008-01-27T12:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	   How did you get the stuff from /usr to  /media/Local Disk/ubuntu-usr
2008-01-27T12:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 you could just 'link' the things with ln -s :)
2008-01-27T13:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 if you dident copy everything from flash  /usr to the  hd's /usr properly - You may of also messed up a lot of permissions
2008-01-27T13:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 egads... thats not going to work then at all.
2008-01-27T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 I know of no way to set the suid or other special permissions on a nfts filesystem
2008-01-27T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 no... theres no permissions = NO permissions to allow it = all problems..
2008-01-27T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Askato	 im suprised any of your binaries work at all.
