2005-03-16T17:00:00.000Z	njs12345		this might be a bit of an obvious question
2005-03-16T17:00:00.000Z	njs12345		but how can I install ubuntu as a server?
2005-03-16T17:02:00.000Z	jintxo	njs12345	well you don't actually insall it as a server, you just install it and then install whatever services you want it to run
2005-03-16T17:02:00.000Z	njs12345		oh
2005-03-16T17:02:00.000Z	njs12345		ok
2005-03-16T17:02:00.000Z	njs12345		I was just wondering.. that's ok, I guess
2005-03-16T17:03:00.000Z	jintxo	njs12345	you want to do anyhting specific with it (dns, dhcp, whatever)?
2005-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	njs12345	jintxo	I'm going to set it up as a router for my home network
2005-03-16T17:08:00.000Z	njs12345		I'm absolutely positive it'll do a better job of it then Windoze does atm ;)
2005-03-16T17:09:00.000Z	jintxo	njs12345	for that you really don't need to much, is it going to do nat? I think you'll need to learn som iptables for that. I don'thave any experience with iptables (I use *BSD for the routers) but I understand it's fairly easy :-)
2005-03-16T17:10:00.000Z	njs12345	jintxo	I've done some iptables before, it's fairly insanely eas
2005-03-16T17:10:00.000Z	njs12345		*easy
2005-03-16T17:10:00.000Z	njs12345		I found a howto and set up a basic NAT in something like 20 secs before ;)
2005-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	jintxo	njs12345	great, I don't htink you'll have any problems then :-p
2005-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	njs12345		it'll also do DHCP as well, which I have no experience with, but hopefully it's not too hard
2005-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	jintxo		just out of curiosity, I ran into a floppy linux router distro the other day that looked nice, coyote linux
2005-03-16T17:12:00.000Z	njs12345		anyone here have a fujitsu fdx310 ADSL modem?
2005-03-16T17:12:00.000Z	jintxo	njs12345	dhcp is easy, just edit 1 config file (after apt-get install dhcpd)
