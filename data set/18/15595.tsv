2006-10-01T10:50:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	it is suggested you dontdo that
2006-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	you don't need to
2006-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	read that web page that the bot sent to you - it will tell you how to enable it and disable it but why you sould not use it
2006-10-01T10:58:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	sudo -i gets you uid 0 and then you can echo to the console of your choice
2006-10-01T10:59:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	assuming you have permission to
2006-10-01T11:00:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	cron
2006-10-01T11:01:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	or as sudo -i and sit there and exit
2006-10-01T11:02:00.000Z	ompaul	mike_stern	you are asking about something called setuid root as far as I can see - you will need to google that with the word security
