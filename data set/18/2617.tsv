2010-04-14T06:01:00.000Z	m477		 i need help with mount iso
2010-04-14T06:01:00.000Z	m477		sudo mount -o loop Diablo2LOD.iso /media/cdrom0/
2010-04-14T06:02:00.000Z	m477		mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2010-04-14T06:04:00.000Z	alpicola	m477	What does file say the image is?
2010-04-14T06:05:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	what do you mean ?
2010-04-14T06:06:00.000Z	alpicola	m477	Type this into a terminal and paste the result: file Diablo2LOD.iso
2010-04-14T06:07:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	Diablo2LOD.iso: data
2010-04-14T06:09:00.000Z	alpicola	m477	Interesting.  Looks like your image file is bad / corrupted.  file should have said something more like "ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data"
2010-04-14T06:09:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	this file work on windows so isnt corrupted
2010-04-14T06:12:00.000Z	alpicola	m477	Not sure, then.  I suppose you could always specify the filesystem when you try to mount the thing and maybe that'll work.  (mount -t iso9660)
2010-04-14T06:13:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	i tried sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 Diablo2LOD.iso /media/cdrom0/
2010-04-14T06:13:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	but doesnt work
2010-04-14T06:14:00.000Z	alpicola	m477	Definitely not sure, then.  What are you using in Windows to load the image?
2010-04-14T06:14:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	daemon
2010-04-14T06:14:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	but it isnt first time when i can mount
2010-04-14T06:15:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	i recently got note that i have to specify file type
2010-04-14T06:16:00.000Z	m477	alpicola	maybe can you recomend some other program which can do that
2010-04-14T06:19:00.000Z	alpicola	m477	Don't really know any, I'm afraid.  Loop mount has always worked for me.
