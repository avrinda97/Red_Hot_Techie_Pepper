2009-02-15T05:20:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	haven't tried much, it simply doesn't output sound, I have a GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3L LGA 775 Intel P35 ATX motherboard, lscpi says: 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02)
2009-02-15T05:21:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	newegg.com says the audio chipset is: Realtek ALC888
2009-02-15T05:22:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Ax4	sudo lsmod <-- see if audo stuff shows up
2009-02-15T05:23:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	lots of stuff
2009-02-15T05:23:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Ax4	put it on pastebin

2009-02-15T05:25:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Ax4	you have more than 1 soundcard ?
2009-02-15T05:25:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	yes, I have an old AudigyZS2 in the box
2009-02-15T05:26:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Ax4	that one is recognised and will work
2009-02-15T05:26:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	so I should switch to the old one and forget about the onboard?
2009-02-15T05:27:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Ax4	hmmm i also so intel hda support so maybe you should check you mixer settings
2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	i've toggled it every which way lol
2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	but thanks for looking i appreciate it
2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	Ax4	nightrid3r	i'll stick with the older soundcard for now I guess
2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Ax4	yes, see if that works for you
