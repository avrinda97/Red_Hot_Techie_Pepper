2008-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	yes
2008-07-01T22:35:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	why are you copying the CDROM drive?
2008-07-01T22:35:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	becuase its a dvd data
2008-07-01T22:37:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	 mounting the DVD will place it directly as if it's a partition and work smoother
2008-07-01T22:39:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	run a df and what does the file size read for the mounted DVD?
2008-07-01T22:40:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	my mounted dvd is 4.5GB in size
2008-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	did you try a sudo cp -r?
2008-07-01T22:45:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	what about putting the DVD into another system and FTP'n the info over?  it will take some time, but no much over a local lan.
2008-07-01T22:46:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	I dont have another system heh :/
2008-07-01T22:46:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	I only run linix as my main os on this cp
2008-07-01T22:47:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	 *applause*  too bad my games won't run on it.  I need a new laptop for my copy, the keyboard's dying and my wife won't let me change the one I got her.
2008-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	thanks but im not that great either, I used to run windows a few weeks ago, I started using linux in 05, went back to win in early 07, but i couldnt take it anymore, ps buy an xbox360 prob solved :D
2008-07-01T22:50:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	thanks for the tip, but I'll stick with the PC, everything eventually comes out on the PC plus I can't stand using a controller for a FPS.  The DVD is an ISO?  I'm wondering if the drive doesn't like the media even though it read the TOC.
2008-07-01T22:50:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	no sir, the dvd is just a bunch of folders, but I m using the iso command jacksparrowd gave me
2008-07-01T22:51:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	its going very slow but right now the iso is 1GB 3GB remaining
2008-07-01T22:51:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	true, just give it time, 4.5 gigs of data does take time to sift through
2008-07-01T22:52:00.000Z	greenfishx3	MaarekStele	actually it usually takes less tehn 4 minutes when i cp my discs, something is indeed weird here
2008-07-01T22:54:00.000Z	MaarekStele	greenfishx3	alright, back to work I go.
