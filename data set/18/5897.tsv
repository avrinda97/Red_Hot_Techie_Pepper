2009-11-16T10:55:00.000Z	billybigrigger		anyone here familiar with bash scripting? #bash is dead
2009-11-16T10:56:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	i can help whats the prob
2009-11-16T10:57:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	ok, and the prob?
2009-11-16T10:59:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	looks like gksudo thinks -c is for itself but -c is for stunnel right?
2009-11-16T10:59:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Billiard	yes -c is for stunnel
2009-11-16T11:02:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	you could try gksudo -i 'nohup stunnel ....'
2009-11-16T11:20:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Billiard	i can't for the life of me get gksu to not recognize that -c command
2009-11-16T11:21:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	did you try what i suggested?
2009-11-16T11:22:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	run it in a terminal, it does absolutely nothing?
2009-11-16T11:23:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Billiard	when i run gksu -i 'command' it pops open the gksu dialog window with a run dialog
2009-11-16T11:23:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Billiard	and it still complains about the -c option
2009-11-16T11:23:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	ok gksu -i is different from sudo -i i guess
2009-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	no
2009-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	show me the command you use with gksu -i
2009-11-16T11:25:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	i said put it in single quotes
2009-11-16T11:25:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Billiard	putting the command in single quotes opens the gksu run dialog window
2009-11-16T11:26:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	show me what you typed
2009-11-16T11:27:00.000Z	Billiard	billybigrigger	i dont think there is a mv -r
