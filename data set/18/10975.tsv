2007-08-25T07:48:00.000Z	scratchme		Hi all.  Because I like to share solutions, if anyone ever gets an error running SQL Developer from Oracle that looks like this:   error instantiating 'java.util.logging.FileHandler,' referenced by handlers, class not found
2007-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	scratchme		Just be sure your java home is set correctly.  Use env to see if you have the JAVA_HOME.  If not, add it using:   export JAVA_HOME=jdkfolderhere
2007-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	Pelo	scratchme	  put it in the forum,  use the error as the title of your post
2007-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	scratchme	Pelo	what forum?
