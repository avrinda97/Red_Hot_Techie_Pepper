2006-03-02T14:19:00.000Z	peppo		hello
2006-03-02T14:20:00.000Z	peppo		a friend has installed 5.10 on a machine with a voodoo3 card. he's only getting 640x480 in X... does anyone know if the version of X that comes with 5.10 has the "tdfx" graphics driver?
2006-03-02T14:20:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	yes, he needs to correct the horizsync & vertrefresh in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-03-02T14:21:00.000Z	peppo	nickrud	doh
2006-03-02T14:21:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	if he wants open gl as well, point him at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Voodoo3doesnotdo3d
2006-03-02T14:22:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	I've run a voodoo3 under ubuntu, it's there
2006-03-02T14:23:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	I'll add it ;)
2006-03-02T14:23:00.000Z	peppo	nickrud	it doesn't work out-of-the-box
2006-03-02T14:24:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	no, it doesn't, or not well. read the voodoo page, it'll explain a bit
2006-03-02T14:25:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	all you need to do is edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and insert the correct HorizSync & VertRefresh under the Monitor section
2006-03-02T14:35:00.000Z	peppo	nickrud	did you have those modelines?
2006-03-02T14:35:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	you probably don't want to add modelines; if you like, you can pm me & I'll walk you through it
2006-03-02T14:39:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	the monitor section should look like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9316 ; be SURE to use values that are correct for his monitor
2006-03-02T14:42:00.000Z	peppo	nickrud	cool, thanks, just have to find some good specs for this monitor
2006-03-02T15:01:00.000Z	peppo	nickrud	thanks, using those horiz/vertical freqs worked. danke!
2006-03-02T15:01:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	yw
2006-03-03T16:15:00.000Z	nickrud	peppo	synaptic!
