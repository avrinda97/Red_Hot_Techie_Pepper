2005-07-28T14:22:00.000Z	prodigy		Okay, I just downloaded jdk-1_5_0-linux-i586.bin and my terminal is telling me it doesn't exist
2005-07-28T14:22:00.000Z	prodigy		why is this happening?
2005-07-28T14:22:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	then it's in another directory
2005-07-28T14:23:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	if you downloaded it with firefox, it'd be in ~/Desktop by default
2005-07-28T14:25:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	cd ~/Desktop
2005-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	which step on the howto is confusing you?
2005-07-28T14:28:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	so, cd ~/Desktop, then run it
2005-07-28T14:32:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	presumably right click on it
2005-07-28T14:32:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	the shell has nothing to do with the trash, tho
2005-07-28T14:34:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	dude, be a lot more careful
2005-07-28T14:34:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	running random commands from strangers that you're not even typing correctly is VERY dangerous
2005-07-28T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	then the java instructions are wrong
2005-07-28T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	because users don't screw around in /usr/, which is what the broken java software is trying to do
2005-07-28T14:44:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	"etc.bin"?
2005-07-28T06:37:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	you complain to whoever gave them to you
2005-07-28T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	what are you trying to do now?
2005-07-28T09:34:00.000Z	bob2	prodigy	nicotine is in Ububuntu already
