2010-11-07T18:11:00.000Z	collabra	westmi	I don't have an answer for why.... i use it and it works for me,...(not intended to rub it in)
2010-11-07T18:14:00.000Z	collabra	westmi	if you are vboxing xp or some sort of windows,... the drivers needed to use your usb devices need to be installed within xp or whatever version you are using.
2010-11-07T18:14:00.000Z	collabra	westmi	that's all i got
2010-11-07T18:17:00.000Z	westmi	collabra	 but would'nt ubuntu automatically download what it needs, like it does for my graphics?
