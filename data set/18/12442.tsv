2006-04-19T10:57:00.000Z	Reivec	arrick	will do, appreciate the link
2006-04-19T10:58:00.000Z	Reivec	arrick	that link doesn't seem to mention anything about RAID1, which is the bulk of my problem, not dual booting
2006-04-19T10:59:00.000Z	arrick	Reivec	^^
2006-04-19T11:11:00.000Z	Reivec	arrick	check this link. http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-7933.html  That is exactly the issue I am having but I don't see any replies to this question
2006-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	arrick	Reivec	did you choose the manual partition config, or the edfault?
2006-04-19T11:14:00.000Z	Reivec	arrick	dunno man.... I tried installing to one drive even though it saw it as 2 and wasn't mirroring but then when I rebooted grub never kicked in. Went straight back to windows
2006-04-19T11:15:00.000Z	Reivec	arrick	I figured if I could get it on the one I could figure out making the raid work later
2006-04-19T11:15:00.000Z	arrick	Reivec	when it asked if you wanted grub to install to the mbr did you tell it yes or no?
