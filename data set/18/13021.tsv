2006-01-24T06:47:00.000Z	fid|sn		what's the easiest way to rip an mp3 with a stock install of breezy?
2006-01-24T06:47:00.000Z	fid|sn		lame's not available, to build it i need to first install a bunch of build tools.  toolame is available -- how do i use it with sound juicer?
2006-01-24T06:48:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	if you fire up synaptic and search for lame, it should come up, iirc. so there is no need to compile it from source.
2006-01-24T06:49:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	did you remember to add the universe and multiverse repositories?
2006-01-24T06:50:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	i've added universe, i didn't add multiverse.  is it in there?  i'll check...
2006-01-24T06:50:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	yes, its in multiverse (i just checked) :)
2006-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	i've just checked, i had already enabled multiverse (and i'm still not seeing it ??)...
2006-01-24T06:52:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	the only repository still commented out in sources.list is "breezy-security universe"
2006-01-24T06:53:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	when i search in my synaptic for lame, by name, lame comes up. so i do not know what's up. did you try "reload" to refresh package list?
2006-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	it's updating every time i click "reload"...  is that correct?
2006-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	when I search by name for "lame" i get [flamethrower, glame, systemimager-server-flamethr, toolame] 
2006-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	and no just "lame" eh? hmm...
2006-01-24T06:59:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	nope.  let me see if it's on the cd...
2006-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	if you go to settings -> repositories in synaptic, does it list multiverse, under breezy badger (binary) ?
2006-01-24T07:01:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	i have "http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy-backports (Binary) main restricted universe multiverse"
2006-01-24T07:06:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	that's what i have too. i can't think why you are having problems...
2006-01-24T07:07:00.000Z	fid|sn	nanotube	well, i appreciate your help
2006-01-24T07:08:00.000Z	nanotube	fid|sn	sorry i couldnt be of more useful assistance. :| but at any rate, even if you cant get at it from repository, you could find the binary .deb package for ubuntu and install it using dpkg, rather than compiling source.
