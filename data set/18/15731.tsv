2005-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	Rattboi		Reiser :P
2005-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	It is the one I have ;-)
2005-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	however, they say that the number of writes is limited at USB-flash drives
2005-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	so the journal thing is not a good thing for a USB-flash... Is that right??
2005-02-15T15:06:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	I have created 2 partitions so I have fat32 and reiser
2005-02-15T15:10:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	Windows only sees the first one ;-)
2005-02-15T15:11:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	ext2 was very slow when writting
2005-02-15T15:12:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	I think it is something related to the kernel version. In fact reiserfs is fast in ubuntu but slow in SuSE
2005-02-15T15:12:00.000Z	Rattboi	prego	are you putting more than data on there?
2005-02-15T15:13:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	software development trees
2005-02-15T15:16:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	the problem is that with ext3/ext2 for some reason the stick behaves slow
2005-02-15T15:16:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	I also tested udf, but I didn't manage :-((
2005-02-15T15:17:00.000Z	Rattboi	prego	so are you having issues with Reiser?
2005-02-15T15:17:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	none ;-) but I am scared about reducing the operating life of the stick
2005-02-15T15:18:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	in fact, with reiser, the stick behaves almost twice speed than with fat ???
2005-02-15T15:19:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	20000 writes to journal area may be not so much
2005-02-15T15:20:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	wich leads me to two questions: a) is it possible to disable journal in reiser? b) how can I enable "noatime" option at mount? (at automagic mount)
2005-02-15T15:23:00.000Z	prego	Rattboi	flodin, if you know spanish, you may see what I've done at "www.barrapunto.com/~prego/journal
