2009-05-06T04:05:00.000Z	olmari	lukinfore	dd if=/dev/srX I think...
2009-05-06T04:06:00.000Z	lukinfore	olmari	yea i thought so too, but it says"no medium found"
2009-05-06T04:07:00.000Z	olmari	lukinfore	well try /dev/dvd I seem to have one and dvdrw... But maybe if the media is so broken a drive can't even regonize it as media then you have bigger problem
2009-05-06T04:07:00.000Z	lukinfore	olmari	exactly bigger
2009-05-06T04:08:00.000Z	lukinfore		and crappy google just gives me free download best recovery tool
2009-05-06T04:08:00.000Z	lukinfore		tons of it
2009-05-06T04:10:00.000Z	olmari	lukinfore	I think still that no program will help you if the _drive_ doesn't wanna see your media
2009-05-06T04:11:00.000Z	lukinfore	olmari	uhm, you may be right, but I believe should be a way to force it to just read all it can
2009-05-06T04:13:00.000Z	olmari	lukinfore	well the only way I can think is professional retrieving company.. consumer drives doesn't wanna try committing suicide :p
