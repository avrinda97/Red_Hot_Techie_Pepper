2005-06-17T14:00:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		I had a debian server
2005-06-17T14:00:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		so I ran the dist-upgrade and it went ok
2005-06-17T14:00:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		until it came back up and kernel panic
2005-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		tried to recover
2005-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		but nothing
2005-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		went online for help in the irc.debian.org
2005-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		and boom..nothing
2005-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		got kinda screwed...but it was a test box before it goes into production
2005-06-17T14:02:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		nevertheless...the original point is...is Ubuntu going to pick up the slack from debian
2005-06-17T14:02:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		this group seems to me more active in correcting problems or fixing them as soon as they can
2005-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	hondje	Nightcr8w	What slack from debian?
2005-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	Nightcr8w	hondje	??? explain
2005-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	hondje	Nightcr8w	You said 'is Ubuntu going to pick up the slack from debian'
2005-06-17T14:04:00.000Z	hondje	Nightcr8w	Debian isn't dead, or dying, or anything. They just don't focus on the desktop
2005-06-17T14:04:00.000Z	Nightcr8w	hondje	debian has always been slow to update anything and if there is a problem..it takes forever to get corrected in the next release
2005-06-17T14:04:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		it seems that in this group..things seems to move quicker
2005-06-17T14:04:00.000Z	Nightcr8w		you are planning another release in october
2005-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	hondje	Nightcr8w	yeah, slow to make stable, but if you're an admin you want that...important things get fixed
