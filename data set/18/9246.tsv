2007-05-08T12:02:00.000Z	coolgeek	soundray	trying to find out a bit more about changing the usplash
2007-05-08T12:03:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	sorry, I haven't done this myself, just happened to know about the factoid
2007-05-08T12:03:00.000Z	coolgeek	soundray	do you know where the defualt usplashs are kept?
2007-05-08T12:06:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	no. 'locate usplash' reveals /usr/share/doc/usplash/README which you should probably have a look at. It may be located in /usr/lib/usplash/
2007-05-08T12:12:00.000Z	coolgeek	soundray	do you know where the defualt usplashs are kept?
2007-05-08T12:12:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	just install the package ^^
2007-05-08T12:13:00.000Z	coolgeek	soundray	with what command im trying...
2007-05-08T12:13:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	are you aware that this is not usplash-related?
2007-05-08T12:16:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	what's wrong with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto ?
2007-05-08T12:16:00.000Z	coolgeek	soundray	it doesnt have the sufficient info im lookin for
2007-05-08T12:17:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	why don't you ask a specific question then? "Does anybody know"-type stuff only annoys people here.
2007-05-08T12:22:00.000Z	coolgeek	soundray	presuming you cannot help with this?
2007-05-08T12:23:00.000Z	soundray	coolgeek	try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure usplash', and failing that, 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install usplash'
