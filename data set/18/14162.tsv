2008-10-08T20:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	keneda	KDE is another desktop manager.
2008-10-08T20:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle	keneda	A desktop manager handles the window placement and decorations along with (in most cases) panels where clocks, menus and minimized windows are shown.
2008-10-08T20:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle	keneda	For example when you start windows the first explorer.exe instance acts as a desktop manager displaying icons and the start menu and the toolbar.
2008-10-08T20:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle	keneda	Ahh, as maniheer correctly pointed out. The correct name for it is "window manager", not desktop manager as I said.
2008-10-08T20:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	keneda	Do you mind if I send you some private messages?
