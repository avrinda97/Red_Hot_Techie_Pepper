2006-01-26T14:40:00.000Z	KSean		9 hours today
2006-01-26T14:40:00.000Z	KSean		5 hours yesterday
2006-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	KSean		I dunno
2006-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	KSean		Yes, you're correct Term[Away] 
2006-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	KSean		I found some old CD-Rs and they wouldnt work
2006-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	KSean		They made a scratching noise when I tried to copy the iso
2006-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	KSean		lol.
2006-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	KSean		only the cd-rws would work
2006-01-26T14:43:00.000Z	KSean		I tried one cd-r and it didn't work though
2006-01-26T14:44:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	how about a new CDR? :)
2006-01-26T14:45:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	the I/O errors sound fishy too so i'm guessing it has something to do with either your cable or IDE controller. :/
2006-01-26T14:47:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and remove all cd references. :)
2006-01-26T14:48:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	try using nano. :)
2006-01-26T14:48:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-01-26T14:48:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	get ready for some command line stuff then. :)
2006-01-26T14:49:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	yeah... to be safe, don't delete them, just comment them out with a hash. :)
2006-01-26T14:49:00.000Z	Terminus	KSean	hope it works. :)
