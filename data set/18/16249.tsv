2005-01-29T13:05:00.000Z	maximaus		Hi everyone. :-) I was wondering if there was a way to add Swedish language support if I forgot to add it during install.
2005-01-29T13:06:00.000Z	maximaus		I see ispell and OpenOffice dictionaries, but was wanting to have an actual gnome session in Swedish.
2005-01-29T13:06:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	dpkg-reconfigure locales helps at least a bit
2005-01-29T13:07:00.000Z	maximaus	topyli	will that remove english support? or can I safely run it without borking my system?
2005-01-29T13:07:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	no, you can add more locales without removing others. then choose default
2005-01-29T13:08:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	i have everything in english, i just have finnish support here :)
2005-01-29T13:10:00.000Z	maximaus	topyli	well it seems to have worked--doesn't the system need to d/l the language files sor anything?
2005-01-29T13:11:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	no, the locales package has all locales
2005-01-29T13:11:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	in fact, i think glibc has them, and locales just configures them
2005-01-29T13:12:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	heh. they do look a bit like me but that's a disguise :)
2005-01-29T13:17:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	it might have it after you restart gdm or perhaps after next boot. this box has a finnish option
2005-01-29T13:18:00.000Z	maximaus	topyli	no it's working great, GDM gives me the choic of English or Swedish now.
2005-01-29T13:19:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	oh, you mean it didn't have swedish right from day one? maybe fedora has all locales configured by default, and debian doesn't
2005-01-29T13:20:00.000Z	maximaus	topyli	exactly. No matter, I'm guilty of doing an incorrect install. Thank you. That was simple. :)
2005-01-29T13:21:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	np. now you can help me configure my bloody infrared dongle :)
2005-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	maximaus	topyli	I wish I could return the favour, but I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. :P
2005-01-29T13:24:00.000Z	topyli	maximaus	everywhere i look on the web, all i can see is "it's simple" and "it should work very well" :/
2005-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	maximaus	topyli	it's more comforting when it's difficult for everybody, but easy for you. :D
