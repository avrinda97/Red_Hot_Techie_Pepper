2005-04-17T14:58:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	not on ubuntu
2005-04-17T14:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	yeah, but how often does that happen?
2005-04-17T14:59:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	ubuntu is young, it has few users
2005-04-17T14:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	most Ubuntu users will be coming from Windows
2005-04-17T14:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	most Windows users will be used to their machines getting it up the jacksie from malicious web pages, malformed MIME and so on
2005-04-17T14:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	none of these are really a problem in Linux
2005-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	and anyone stupid enough to run arbitrary code without understanding it deserves to lose
2005-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	no
2005-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	yes, of course, but who in their right mind would do that?
2005-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	no, they need to learn
2005-04-17T15:01:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	sorry mate, lack of skills is not the right argument
2005-04-17T15:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	if someone walked up to you and told you to run over your hand with a car, would you do it?
2005-04-17T15:03:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	not a very accurate analogy, sudoing everything is like giving a drunk keys to their car
2005-04-17T15:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	not really
2005-04-17T15:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	you still need to deliberately run things in sudo
2005-04-17T15:04:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	*nod* i don't disagree, some things need sude, printing, ect.
2005-04-17T15:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	holycow	not using wheel is madness
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	holycow	gordonjcp	oh i agree with you, not having root from what i see is definately an improvement *nod* ... perhaps just having sudo for things relavent to a restricted user might be better maybe?
