2006-11-12T06:27:00.000Z	Bauke		Help pls: During an fresh install of Edgy my ps/2 keyboard fails. Is there a boot parameter to fix this?
2006-11-12T06:27:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	at what point does it fail?
2006-11-12T06:28:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	you enter your it wont let you enter the username or the password?
2006-11-12T06:28:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	you tried pluggin/unpluggin your keyboar?
2006-11-12T06:29:00.000Z	Bauke	variant	yes, and a different keyboard also. They both work with dapper
2006-11-12T06:29:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	so.. that fixed it?
2006-11-12T06:30:00.000Z	Bauke	variant	plug/unplugging didn't fix it. They both work with dapper
2006-11-12T06:30:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	thats very odd
2006-11-12T06:30:00.000Z	Bauke	variant	i was hoping to find a boot prm
2006-11-12T06:30:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	are you sure it just doesnt echo the password ? you shouldnt see anything (no ****)  when you type the password
2006-11-12T06:31:00.000Z	Bauke	variant	any other keystroke fails, numlock hangs and nothing happens
2006-11-12T06:31:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	mad..
2006-11-12T06:31:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	you might have a dodgey port?
2006-11-12T06:31:00.000Z	Bauke	variant	when i boot back to dapper, everything's allright
2006-11-12T06:31:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	annoying
2006-11-12T06:32:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	cehck for a bug report.. i havent heard of this before though
2006-11-12T06:32:00.000Z	Bauke	variant	anyway, thanks for your help man. I'll file the bug then
2006-11-12T06:32:00.000Z	variant	Bauke	np
