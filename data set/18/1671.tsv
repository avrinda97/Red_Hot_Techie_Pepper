2011-01-05T10:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	oh, usb-creator
2011-01-05T10:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	ok, did you MD5 test the ISO before using it?
2011-01-05T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	did you check the ISO you downloaded before transferring to the USB device?
2011-01-05T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	ok what happens when you try to boot?
2011-01-05T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	sdoes the system say the device isn't bootable, do you just get a black screen?
2011-01-05T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	ok then it is booting, you just need the nomodeset boot option
2011-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest83473	its not bios, the bios is doing its job, its a video issue
