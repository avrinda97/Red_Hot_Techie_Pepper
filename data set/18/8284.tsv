2009-11-08T21:53:00.000Z	dan_		Hello, does anyone know of a way to set a universal proxy for Ubuntu. I am tethered to my iphone via SSH and it requires me manually configuring a proxy for every Application i use for it to connect to the internet .
2009-11-08T21:55:00.000Z	bitmonk	dan_	the application can't be subliminally forced to use a proxy if it doesn't look in a common place, but you can capture outgoing ports such as 80 with iptables
2009-11-08T21:55:00.000Z	bitmonk	dan_	you may be able to set a SOCKS_PROXY env var or something which some apps may respect..
2009-11-08T21:57:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	I cant even use "add/remove applications" software because its not configured to use a proxy
2009-11-08T21:57:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	the iphone uses port 3023 127.0.0.1 i configured xchat and firefox to use them so i can get internet on those but on nothing else i actually need internet on lol
2009-11-08T21:59:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	well my main concern in all honesty is not having to configure each app individually to use a proxy :\
2009-11-08T21:59:00.000Z	bitmonk	dan_	i gave you as much info on that as possible above, 2 or 3 potential solutions..
2009-11-08T22:00:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	By capturing outgoing ports you mean redirect common ports to 3023 ?
2009-11-08T22:01:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	Any suggested reading for redirecting "through" 3023 ?
2009-11-08T22:03:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	unfortunatly there is no real broadband connection available to me :\
2009-11-08T22:04:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	Nah man i live in the middle of no where lol hence why i have to relye on tethering in the first place
2009-11-08T22:05:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	The fact that i got it working via SSH in the first place without is a fete all in its own lol , i had to download packages on my phone and SSH them to my computer
2009-11-08T22:07:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	I can setup a wifi hotspot on my phone as well , i Lack a wifi card on my desktop. Its a DELL XPS 400 ;\
2009-11-08T22:08:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	I have a wireless router but no way to actually go in and share the 3G connection :\
2009-11-08T22:08:00.000Z	bitmonk	dan_	yeouch.. anyway, what i meant is that you can tether without a proxy, i'm not sure that is possible on att network.  you really kinda dove all into a super expensive and impractical purchase, i think.. even as much as i enjoyed my iphone, it would be a sad waste if i lived in the middle of nowhere.  like some star trek communicator in alameda. ;d *ducks*
2009-11-08T22:10:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	: Yea it sucks quite hard to be honest lol.  I have had the Iphone and just recently moved. And the only broadband option requires buying a 400$ modem and paying 60$ a month
2009-11-08T22:11:00.000Z	bitmonk	dan_	yeah i know the options can be tough, a friend and i are actually working on a rural 900mhz isp.  the investment to get cable lay out in rural areas is still astronomical.
2009-11-08T22:14:00.000Z	dan_	bitmonk	: I have not even upgraded to 9.10 yet :\ still on 9.04
