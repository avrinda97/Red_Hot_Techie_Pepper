2007-10-24T05:05:00.000Z	i_		Where can I find some LTSP experts?
2007-10-24T05:06:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	that may be of interest
2007-10-24T05:06:00.000Z	i_	scguy318	Thanks, I'm need to know why upgrading to Gutsy screwed up my school computer lab setup!
2007-10-24T05:07:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	what exactly is the issue?
2007-10-24T05:09:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	what exactly is the issue you get?
2007-10-24T05:09:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	like specifically what occurs when more than 6-8 try to log in
2007-10-24T05:11:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	perhaps try bringing up and down the interfaces? is there anything of interest in syslog
2007-10-24T05:11:00.000Z	i_	scguy318	what would I be looking for in the logs?
2007-10-24T05:11:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	not sure, pastebinning dmesg may be of interest
2007-10-24T05:12:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	other than that maybe people in #edubuntu may be able to assist
2007-10-24T05:12:00.000Z	i_	scguy318	sorry, I'm a relative noob ... what would be the specific command, if you don't mind...
2007-10-24T05:12:00.000Z	i_	scguy318	tried #edubuntu but hardly anyone is around
2007-10-24T05:13:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	i dunno, pastebin dmesg
2007-10-24T05:13:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	dmesg | tail
2007-10-24T05:14:00.000Z	i_	scguy318	Perhaps you can help from another angle - what files do I need to save so that I don't have to setup 80+ user accounts when I rebuild the server?
2007-10-24T05:15:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	lemme see, probably you'd want to preserve the chroot
2007-10-24T05:15:00.000Z	i_	scguy318	Sorry again, where the chroot is?
2007-10-24T05:17:00.000Z	scguy318	i_	/opt/ltsp/i386 I think
