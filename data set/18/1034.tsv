2012-04-19T22:56:00.000Z	frustrateduser		hi guys i installed LAMP on ubuntu server 10110 and then put drupal in /var/www but when i go to the website it wants to download the files instead of showing the site. any ideas?
2012-04-19T22:56:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	php is probably not installed, or you have to restart apache
2012-04-19T22:57:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	service apache restart
2012-04-19T23:04:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	what does it try  download, when you don't specify the page?
2012-04-19T23:06:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	it doesnt say the filename it just says type is application/x-trash
2012-04-19T23:06:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	if you try to save it it will suggest you a name which should be the filename
2012-04-19T23:07:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	had the same thing with wordpress so i figured it was server problem
2012-04-19T23:11:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	did you use the install.php installer?
2012-04-19T23:11:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	yep went through the install proccess no problem
2012-04-19T23:11:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	had to type /install.php though
2012-04-19T23:12:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	check out on /var/www if you have nothing else with index.htm name, maybe that's where apache sends you
2012-04-19T23:13:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	thanks ill check and let you know
2012-04-19T23:19:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	there was an index.html.old file in the directory and that seemed to be the issue, thanks for the suggestion
2012-04-19T23:19:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	anytime ^^ Next tme deploy your CMS on a fresh subdir until you're sure it's working, then pull it to www
2012-04-19T23:20:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	problem with that is im not technically deploying it just assisting on the one
2012-04-19T23:21:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	since your here and helpful do you know how to add json support to a LAMP server?
2012-04-19T23:22:00.000Z	apwbdjp	frustrateduser	not really, sorry
2012-04-19T23:23:00.000Z	frustrateduser	apwbdjp	oh darn
