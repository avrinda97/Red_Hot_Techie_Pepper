2006-11-13T06:22:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	someone else told me to edit gconf, but i have no idea where it would be in that
2006-11-13T06:22:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	do you mean you cannot get the "Open With" tab to take?
2006-11-13T06:24:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	are you turning on the radio button?
2006-11-13T06:24:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	hmmm ok
2006-11-13T06:25:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	you know other way to do it (in command prompt, or gconf?)
2006-11-13T06:25:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	will look
2006-11-13T06:25:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	thansk so much for help
2006-11-13T06:33:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	have you tried making changes with right clicking on the icon then "Open With" then "Open With Other Application"?
2006-11-13T06:34:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	that just opens it with that applicatoin one time
2006-11-13T06:35:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	i want to change the default
2006-11-13T06:37:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	how many choices with radio buttons were there for the file you are wanting to change?
2006-11-13T06:37:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	10
2006-11-13T06:38:00.000Z	tom47	rc-1	the way you are doing it is the right way/easiest way .... i cannot find any other way it can be achieved other than as we discussed .... its odd that it stopped working though
2006-11-13T06:39:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	:( thanks anyways
2006-11-13T06:39:00.000Z	rc-1	tom47	surprised theres not a command line to change that!
