2012-05-13T03:05:00.000Z	DjKiDD		Greetings! My friend updated her ubuntu to the newest version and now she can't login to the desktop... everything work fine up to the login screen, after entering the password it looks like it is about to switch to desktop but then it goes back to the login screen.... You have any idea how to fix this?
2012-05-13T03:07:00.000Z	DjKiDD		so I'm not the only one?
2012-05-13T03:08:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	delete the ~/.Xauthority file
2012-05-13T03:09:00.000Z	DjKiDD	wylde	ya?
2012-05-13T03:09:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	you'l probably have to adjust you x settings but that will get you logged in.
2012-05-13T03:09:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	yep, you're the 3rd today I've seen with that problem.
2012-05-13T03:12:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	/home/$user yes
2012-05-13T03:23:00.000Z	DjKiDD	wylde	I don't see any file called .Xauthority in /home/$user/
2012-05-13T03:23:00.000Z	DjKiDD	wylde	I don't see any file called .Xauthority in /home/$user/
2012-05-13T03:26:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	$user is the username of the account you can't get into.
2012-05-13T03:27:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	.Xautority is a protected file yes. You'll need to use sudo rm to remove it
2012-05-13T03:30:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	for example my .Xauthority is at /home/wylde/.Xauthority
2012-05-13T03:31:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	ls -a | grep .X
2012-05-13T03:37:00.000Z	DjKiDD	wylde	where is this mkxauth located?
2012-05-13T03:38:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	the only file you should need to touch, is the /home/username/.Xauthority file. Or follow what Tigerboy is suggesting :)
2012-05-13T03:43:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	ps aux | grep dm
2012-05-13T03:45:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	yeah that's just your grep....
2012-05-13T03:46:00.000Z	wylde	DjKiDD	what's the output of 'lsb_release -rc'
