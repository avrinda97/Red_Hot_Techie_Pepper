2007-06-05T05:09:00.000Z	Declan		hey people I'm wondering if someone could give me a hand. I set up a previous ubuntu but i had a keyboard AND mouse problem and I was wondering will this new release, 7.04, be any different? :S
2007-06-05T05:10:00.000Z	Declan		wow thats pretty gay
2007-06-05T05:11:00.000Z	Declan		i'v had SuSe for a wile but i miss pretty ubuntu
2007-06-05T05:12:00.000Z	Declan		an now GRUB wont load cause I had to open recovery console and do chkdsk on my harddrive
2007-06-05T05:13:00.000Z	Declan		i no
2007-06-05T05:13:00.000Z	Declan		but it refuses to load grub now
2007-06-05T05:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	Declan	it's documented in the ubuntu wiki how to restore grub. all you need is a boot disk (install live cd would do)
2007-06-05T05:23:00.000Z	Spliffster	Declan	i hear different stories. ppl on recent hardare with 64bit vistas prais it, others on older hardware and/or 32 bit vista hate it. it defenately burns a lot of ressources.
2007-06-05T05:23:00.000Z	Spliffster	Declan	on a side note, it was also reported o swallow little kittens alive, so it must be evil:-P
2007-06-05T05:24:00.000Z	Declan	Spliffster	lmao
2007-06-05T05:24:00.000Z	Declan	Spliffster	I'l definitely stay away from it now
2007-06-05T05:25:00.000Z	Declan	Spliffster	It looks so shiny even though I've heard it has immense driver incompatibility
2007-06-05T05:26:00.000Z	Spliffster	Declan	it seems to me, that there is really no need for the latest and greates from redmond. they have stripped all innovative features from vista, so it's basicly an XP with a 3d desktop. and as i keep saying: never change a winning system. why upgrade t obeta test another 2 years? but ths is something fro #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-06-05T05:27:00.000Z	Declan	Spliffster	thanks man. much appreciated
2007-06-05T05:27:00.000Z	Spliffster	Declan	i keep calling it VistaME :)
2007-06-05T05:28:00.000Z	Declan	Spliffster	*noobish confusion* :S
2007-06-05T05:28:00.000Z	Spliffster	Declan	if you had windows ME you' know .. otherwise when bored some day, install it ... you'll be surprised how stable xp is :)
2007-06-05T05:29:00.000Z	Declan	Spliffster	ahhh right. I think I get you now
