2010-06-24T13:07:00.000Z	VanessaE_		nope, no good.  There are definitely no USB settings in there other than an emulation setting for keyboard/mouse
2010-06-24T13:07:00.000Z	VanessaE_		(nothing that would turn the device on/off)
2010-06-24T13:08:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 do you have a) usb keyboard b) usb stick ?
2010-06-24T13:08:00.000Z	VanessaE_	AAA	no and no.
2010-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 can you boot to the install CD with usb mouse plugged in and see if dmesg/lsusb see's it?
2010-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	VanessaE_	AAA	I could try, sure.
2010-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 and do you have a card for your card reader? anything you could put in it?
2010-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 before reboot. unplug the reader, put a card in it and re-insergt
2010-06-24T13:11:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 you said 10.4? karmic is 9.10
2010-06-24T13:12:00.000Z	VanessaE_	AAA	indeed I did.  I am running Lucid, but at present I only have a Karmic disc handy to boot from
2010-06-24T13:13:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 I'm very curious to see dmesg and lsusb when the card is in the usb reader
2010-06-24T13:16:00.000Z	VanessaE_	AAA	ok, before the reboot as requested - plugging the reader in with the card already inserted does nothing at all - no response from the kernel in dmesg
2010-06-24T13:18:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 crazy.... try to reboot to the CD and see if lsusb/dmesg sees it. it is really starting to sound like a hw problem.  that chipset is new enough to work with a 2.6.2x kernel
2010-06-24T13:18:00.000Z	VanessaE_	AAA	here's lsusb, before I reboot:  http://pastebin.com/3FLP3pcF
2010-06-24T13:19:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 also, can you change your bios boot order to boot from usb? try that with the reader and a card plugged in
2010-06-24T13:19:00.000Z	VanessaE_	AAA	 The card contains no bootable imagery.  Will that matter?
2010-06-24T13:20:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 shouldn't to the bios, no
2010-06-24T13:21:00.000Z	AAA	VanessaE_	 the excercise is to see if the bios sees the device
