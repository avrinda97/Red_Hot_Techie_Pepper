2005-04-19T15:50:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	you can have xv without xshm
2005-04-19T15:52:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	I know, xv on its own will fuck up my display and freeze my cpu beyond the ability to CTRL ALT BKSP out of X
2005-04-19T15:52:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	xshm just runs slow enough to get warnings
2005-04-19T15:52:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	same with opengl
2005-04-19T15:53:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	well you can use gstreamer and set the Multimedia System selector to use ximagesink
2005-04-19T15:53:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	with totem
2005-04-19T15:53:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	it will then do software scaling
2005-04-19T15:53:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	Yeah, but gstreamer doesn't support many codecs
2005-04-19T15:53:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	install gstreamer-ffmpeg
2005-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	it will then support the same things than others
2005-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	Hmm...cool, thanks.
2005-04-19T15:55:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	xine, mplayer vlc.. everybody use ffmpeg :)
2005-04-19T15:55:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	so they all support the same things in the end
2005-04-19T15:55:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	Yeah, I compiled ffmpeg when I was fiddling with mplayer.  Can I just use that compiled version?
2005-04-19T15:56:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	well you better use the package
2005-04-19T15:56:00.000Z	dolphy	sataere	hoary's package of gstreamer are working really well
2005-04-19T15:56:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	I seem to remember having tried it, and not having it work for quicktime files
2005-04-19T16:04:00.000Z	sataere	dolphy	totem-gstreamer has failed to play ogm
