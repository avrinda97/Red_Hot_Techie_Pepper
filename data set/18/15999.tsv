2004-12-06T16:06:00.000Z	imi		how do i copy an install cd? do i have to create the image first?
2004-12-06T16:07:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	just do a cd copy.
2004-12-06T16:08:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	I mean your cd burning program should be able to do cd copies.
2004-12-06T16:11:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	how did you manage to get a 900 mb CD? that's kind of weird. I wasn't aware that there were 900Mb CDs.
2004-12-06T16:13:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	Oh ok... :) The thing is, if you try to simply do a cd copy, it will try to copy the cd as is. What you'd need to do is redownload the iso or do a net install, if that's possible.
2004-12-06T16:14:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	that's the best solution.
2004-12-06T16:14:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	vector linux? if so, pretty nice distro for a laptop. Ran it on mine. When it was working.:)
2004-12-06T16:16:00.000Z	imi	cyberdrek	it's probably the only way to get a 233mhz 64mb ram laptop working :)
2004-12-06T16:18:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	there are other ways. I had a similar laptop but mine was an AMD 200 something, 64mb, 800x600 max. :( but it did the job for me. I ran Vector and QNX(Momentix)
2004-12-06T16:25:00.000Z	imi	cyberdrek	what's momentix?
2004-12-06T16:25:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	it's a version of QNX
2004-12-06T16:26:00.000Z	imi	cyberdrek	never heard of qnx.
2004-12-06T16:27:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	what epod said.
2004-12-06T16:28:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	no, it's simply an os for embeded components.
2004-12-06T16:29:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	it's not related to linux so don't bother. I ran it for my job.
2004-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	imi	cyberdrek	i hope it'll work with a 700mb cd. i'm really eager to install linux on a laptop
2004-12-06T16:32:00.000Z	cyberdrek	imi	ubuntu fits on a 700mb cd. That's what I used to install on my system.
