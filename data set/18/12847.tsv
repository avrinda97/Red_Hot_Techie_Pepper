2006-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	Badm4n		maybe there is a more "good" partitiion cause i heard /var and /tmp must be in different partition

2006-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	Badm4n		if i want to create squid/proxy... can i use that partition ? or i must have a new partition ?
2006-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	noiesmo	Badm4n	squid/proxy cache should be on seperate partition
2006-03-01T14:46:00.000Z	noiesmo	Badm4n	not essential but better performance if cache is own partition
2006-03-01T14:46:00.000Z	Badm4n	noiesmo	: can you explain why that must be ?
