2006-03-15T14:51:00.000Z	SpComb		but wouldn't it be more sensible to only set the bootable flag on the ubuntu partition at a later stage?
2006-03-15T14:51:00.000Z	SpComb		say, at GRUB install
2006-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	SpComb		it's just a bit silly that if it fails, you have to manually set windows to boot again
2006-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	SpComb		and most people wouldn't know how to do that
2006-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	SpComb	that's why there is a support channel.
2006-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	SpComb		what if someone has a single computer?
2006-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	SpComb		it's not too much fun
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	soundray	SpComb	Live CD?
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	SpComb		uhm
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	SpComb		how to download/burn it?
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	SpComb		just in theory
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	SpComb		it's not fun to have a computer that doesn't boot
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	SpComb		and setting a empty partition to boot isn't too nice
2006-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	soundray	SpComb	in theory, the problem will be solved in dapper, where the install CD is also the live CD.
2006-03-15T14:54:00.000Z	SpComb		huh?
2006-03-15T14:54:00.000Z	soundray	SpComb	I would argue that installing OSs isn't for the timid, anyway.
2006-03-15T14:54:00.000Z	SpComb		`the issue is that the boot flag on the windows partition is unset, and set on the soon-to-be linux partiion
2006-03-15T14:54:00.000Z	SpComb	soundray	isn't ubuntu meant for the timid?
