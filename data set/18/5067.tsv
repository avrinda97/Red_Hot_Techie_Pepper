2008-12-20T19:29:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	If you have to use 32bit and 64bit, recommend you use a chroot'ed env - take a look at debootstrap... dpkg and apt do not support multiarch
2008-12-20T19:31:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	no... ia32-libs is a bandaid over the lack of multiarch support in dpkg/apt... if there was real support, those packages wouldn't be necessary
2008-12-20T19:32:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	Because Debian guys decided not to support it until after Lenny is released, and they've been trying to release Lenny for about 2 years now
2008-12-20T19:33:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	http://wiki.debian.org/multiarch/ for the status upstream
2008-12-20T19:35:00.000Z	LynggaardDk	fde	what is the holdup ? and can't ubuntu include it anyway =?
2008-12-20T19:37:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	the hold up is due to Lenny release, I already told you that... afaik, Ubuntu has hired the guys that wrote dpkg and apt, but I think they just don't want to fork the two packages.
2008-12-20T19:42:00.000Z	LynggaardDk	fde	but what is the holdup with the Lenny release ? why can't they get that out the door ? you said they tried for 2 years now
2008-12-20T19:43:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	about 200 release critical bugs
2008-12-20T19:43:00.000Z	LynggaardDk	fde	yes but 2 years ?...
2008-12-20T19:43:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	2 years ago, there was around 1500
2008-12-20T19:45:00.000Z	LynggaardDk	fde	do you know the current estimate ? will it be in ubuntu 9.10 ? or will it be even later ?
2008-12-20T19:45:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	certainly later
2008-12-20T19:46:00.000Z	LynggaardDk	fde	so basicly multi arch is a dead horse...
2008-12-20T19:48:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	They want to do it after Lenny... which is likely to be released in the next couple months... so there might be the starts of it in 9.10... Debian tends to have higher technical standards though than most distros, so there is no time frame... just "when its ready"
2008-12-20T19:49:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	In Ubuntu, not even main needs to be free of release critical bugs - its a time based release... in Debian, there has to be no release critical bugs in any of the 25,000 packages in their repo
2008-12-20T19:51:00.000Z	LynggaardDk	fde	Debian might have that, but their release planning and scoping of features still hurts the progress as the schedule drags out for many year.. from what I have learned today, 64bit is a nogo unless you only have 1 max 2 apps... otherwise you need to do chroot and such, because the ia32-libs approach is a dud
2008-12-20T19:52:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	pretty much correct... yes
2008-12-20T20:00:00.000Z	fde	LynggaardDk	just replace the fiesty command with whatever dist you want... it works exacty the same way
