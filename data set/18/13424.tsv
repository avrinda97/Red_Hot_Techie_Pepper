2006-03-29T15:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	Badm4n	You don't need more free memory
2006-03-29T15:38:00.000Z	Badm4n	Chousuke	is ubuntu will do that 4 me ?
2006-03-29T15:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	Badm4n	if some app requires more memory, the OS will free some from the cache.
2006-03-29T15:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	Badm4n	Linux always uses all the RAM it can
2006-03-29T15:39:00.000Z	Badm4n		is this good or bad ?

2006-03-29T15:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	Badm4n	if apps don't need it, Linux caches stuff so you can access it faster.
2006-03-29T15:40:00.000Z	Badm4n		sorry
2006-03-29T15:40:00.000Z	Badm4n		btw is that good ?

2006-03-29T15:40:00.000Z	Chousuke		maybe Linux just hasn't found use for it yet :/
