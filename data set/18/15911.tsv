2005-01-06T09:43:00.000Z	drspin		now if only iTunes...
2005-01-06T09:44:00.000Z	drspin		useless...
2005-01-06T09:44:00.000Z	drspin		but show promise...
2005-01-06T09:45:00.000Z	drspin		no ID3 editing -- searching sucks -- no support for AAC
2005-01-06T09:46:00.000Z	drspin		heh XMMS is very simple - but how do I manage my library??
2005-01-06T09:46:00.000Z	drspin		I didn't use iTuned because it was pretty -- I used it because it allowed me to manage my music library easier than anyone else
2005-01-06T09:47:00.000Z	drspin		LOL
2005-01-06T09:47:00.000Z	drspin		;)
2005-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	drspin		LOL - yup but my library is so large that there's no searching through folders --
2005-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	drspin		over 6000 MP3 and at least half that AAC ;)
2005-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	housetier	drspin	how did you manage before?
2005-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	drspin		no way - I didn't say iTunes was a superior application - I said that it made managing my music library easier than any other application that I have tried... it does have it's downsides
2005-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	drspin		before iTunes my music collection never peaked far above 250 - 300 songs so they were all in 1 folder with no ID3 information
2005-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	drspin		;)
2005-01-06T09:51:00.000Z	drspin		even if I could find just a kickass library manager I would be stoked
2005-01-06T09:52:00.000Z	housetier		my kickass library manager is "rm"
2005-01-06T09:52:00.000Z	housetier		I only have mp3 I like
2005-01-06T09:53:00.000Z	drspin	housetier	heh maybe that's what I should consider
