2005-05-14T15:41:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	but instead of using dpkg-reconfigure run fglrxconfig
2005-05-14T15:41:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	run fglrxconfig and make sure you remove the nvidia module
2005-05-14T15:42:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	also, go into the file that it made called XFree86Conf-4 or whatever and change Keyboard to keyboard
2005-05-14T15:42:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	just pick ps/2 with a wheel
2005-05-14T15:50:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	#flood you bitch!
2005-05-14T15:51:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	put yes
2005-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	go in and change, Keyboard to keyboard
2005-05-14T15:53:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	then after you change Keyboard to keyboard rename it to xorg.conf... and yes the second line
2005-05-14T15:54:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	remove nvidia.ko first!
2005-05-14T15:55:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/kernel/drivers/video <-- has the nvidia.ko file
2005-05-14T15:57:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	sudo rm nvidia.ko
2005-05-14T15:59:00.000Z	transgress	gazzie	yes
