2007-08-20T07:18:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	first do gksu nautilus. Then create a new folder in /home. Right click on it, and adjust the permissions so all users have read and write access
2007-08-20T07:18:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	I think that will work
2007-08-20T07:22:00.000Z	godofredo	phixxor	i'm trying to run a server from a different home folder...and when i go to run it via the terminal (after doing what you said) i get this:  /usr/local/bin/tc-eliteded: line 25: ./etded: Permission Denied
2007-08-20T07:23:00.000Z	godofredo	phixxor	any ideas?
2007-08-20T07:24:00.000Z	godofredo	phixxor	you there? (uh oh)
2007-08-20T07:24:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	I'm here
2007-08-20T07:25:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	is running whatever command with sudo a possibility?
2007-08-20T07:25:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	that might be your whole problem
2007-08-20T07:25:00.000Z	godofredo	phixxor	same error
2007-08-20T07:25:00.000Z	godofredo	phixxor	first thing i tried.
2007-08-20T07:26:00.000Z	godofredo	phixxor	is this bad?
2007-08-20T07:27:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	maybe you could just create a new account and run the server from there (I'm not exactly sure what you're doing)
2007-08-20T07:27:00.000Z	phixxor	godofredo	I have no idea what /usr/local/bin/tc-eliteded is, though
