2007-03-01T06:54:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	try dpkg -L iptables
2007-03-01T06:55:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	you will find where the files had been delivered by iptables
2007-03-01T06:55:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	try dpkg -L iptables
2007-03-01T06:59:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	you will know what and where files were delivered from iptables package
2007-03-01T07:05:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	most probably something that ends with the name iptables ?
2007-03-01T07:06:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	you need to read how to configure iptables
2007-03-01T07:06:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	/sbin/iptables
2007-03-01T07:06:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	but i thought ipchains was integrated into linux kernel
2007-03-01T07:09:00.000Z	cypher1	yakumo	check what ubotu told you
