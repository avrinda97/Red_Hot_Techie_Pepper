2008-01-31T13:55:00.000Z	kaizoku		Does anyone here know anything about the kernel..?
2008-01-31T13:55:00.000Z	kaizoku		And whether or not the CONFIG_X86_PAE symbol is ubuntu specific?
2008-01-31T13:57:00.000Z	soren	kaizoku	It's not.
2008-01-31T13:57:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	Do you know why I might not see it in the vanilla config?
2008-01-31T13:57:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	*vanilla sources
2008-01-31T13:57:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	Is there something else I need to enable first?
2008-01-31T13:58:00.000Z	soren	kaizoku	enable X86_32 and disable HIGHMEM4G.
2008-01-31T14:01:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	I still don't see it.
2008-01-31T14:01:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	It's not even commented out in .config
2008-01-31T14:03:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	Is there anything else that might be blocking it?
2008-01-31T14:04:00.000Z	soren	kaizoku	You sure you don't have HIGHMEM4G enabled?
2008-01-31T14:04:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	Yes, I have  172 CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
2008-01-31T14:04:00.000Z	soren	kaizoku	There's your problem.
2008-01-31T14:04:00.000Z	soren	kaizoku	Why do you care about PAE anyway?
2008-01-31T14:05:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	What should I have enabled..?
2008-01-31T14:05:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	I need PAE because xen won't accept a non-PAE guest kernel.
2008-01-31T14:05:00.000Z	soren	kaizoku	Ok.
2008-01-31T14:06:00.000Z	kaizoku	soren	Oh, thanks!
