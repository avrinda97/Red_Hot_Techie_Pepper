2006-12-10T13:56:00.000Z	sonicGB		 FirstStrike: I personally don't like Gnome because it reminds me of a confused user.
2006-12-10T13:57:00.000Z	sonicGB		:-)
2006-12-10T13:58:00.000Z	gephalt	sonicGB	yeah- perhaps- but I've installed gnome for a few kids with really old systems and they couldn't be happier with the gloss and the glitter. :D
2006-12-10T13:58:00.000Z	sonicGB	gephalt	I'm not having a go at anyone in particular... Gnome doesn't float my boat, but I'm sure plenty of other folks are perfectly happy.
2006-12-10T13:59:00.000Z	sonicGB		today I'm on my third day with my first ever mac... believe me, at this point in time I'd be more comfortable with winders!!!
2006-12-10T14:00:00.000Z	gephalt	sonicGB	yeah. no worries- am not a DE-fanatic and gnome-foot-logo flag waving jingoist.
2006-12-10T14:00:00.000Z	sonicGB		(I already set it up to triple boot osx, winders and kubuntu, mostly just to prove it could be done!)
2006-12-10T14:00:00.000Z	gephalt		whats winders? windows?
2006-12-10T14:00:00.000Z	sonicGB		yeah
2006-12-10T14:00:00.000Z	gephalt		;P i've heard 'em call winbl0ws or something most of the time
2006-12-10T14:01:00.000Z	sonicGB		lol!
2006-12-10T14:01:00.000Z	sonicGB		I think that "winders" is appropriately polite, and appropriately disrespectful at the same time! :-)
2006-12-10T14:03:00.000Z	gephalt	sonicGB	so how does OS X compare to linux- i know- not the same material. But i'm really tired of apple-junkies trying to convince me that I'll never go back to any other OS if I tried it.
2006-12-10T14:03:00.000Z	sonicGB	gephalt	the jury is still out here. It's only been about three days for me so far, and it's tough going.
2006-12-10T14:04:00.000Z	sonicGB		I won't be truly happy until I can survive without a mouse... the lack of knowledge of keyboard shortcuts is driving me nuts so far!
2006-12-10T14:05:00.000Z	sonicGB	gephalt	I think that gnome or kde (ubuntu/kubuntu) are a lot more windows-like than mac. mac, so far, seems to be out there on its own with a whole bunch of new windowing-environment stuff that doesn't correspond to the rest
2006-12-10T14:05:00.000Z	gephalt		Yeah, reminds me of this bit in the TrueX mouse website about how windows users have stronger index fingers with all the mouse-clicking
2006-12-10T14:05:00.000Z	sonicGB	gephalt	I can get around winders quite happily with no mouse... that's what's bugging me here on osx.... can't manage wihtout a mouse
