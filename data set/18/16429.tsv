2009-05-22T20:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 thats what we do all day in here. :)
2009-05-22T20:22:00.000Z	iTomb		excellent
2009-05-22T20:23:00.000Z	iTomb		I just installed 9 on a 2nd ntfs drive and now getting grub error 17
2009-05-22T20:25:00.000Z	iTomb		xp on primary drive / ubuntu on alt drive.  Grub Error 17 at boot
2009-05-22T20:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	  are you saying you have 2 seperate hard drives? or one drive with several partitions?
2009-05-22T20:25:00.000Z	iTomb		2 drives
2009-05-22T20:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 is the 2nd drive just for 'linux' or dose it share some  partitions with windows also?
2009-05-22T20:26:00.000Z	iTomb		dedicated to linux
2009-05-22T20:27:00.000Z	iTomb	furythor	-> Ctrl-X
2009-05-22T20:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 could try in bios/menus to boot that hard drive.. not the windows drive.. it may be the grub installer got confused.  Other then that.. not sure of a proper/easy way to tell you to fix  it. I know enoguh grub to fix things If i was sitting at the machine.. but not via irc. :)
2009-05-22T20:30:00.000Z	iTomb		any idea how I could get in to grub to make changes?
2009-05-22T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 grub is well doucmented all over.. the menu.lst file is at /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-05-22T20:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 now what to change.. is the issue... the grub docs/ubuntu grub wiki pages may have some tips
2009-05-22T20:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		!grub | iTomb
2009-05-22T20:32:00.000Z	iTomb		Ubottu: no, XP is on my main drive.  I installed Ubuntu on a dedicated 2nd drive.  Now getting error 17.  Not finding any docs on it thus far.
2009-05-22T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 ubottu is a bot.. it just spits out factoids and urls
2009-05-22T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iTomb	 the offical grub home page proberly has info on that error
