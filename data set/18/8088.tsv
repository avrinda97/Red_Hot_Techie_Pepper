2007-10-02T12:06:00.000Z	Absolute0		any cool game providided with apt-get?
2007-10-02T12:07:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	yes, theres stuff like Tremulous, Freeciv, etc.
2007-10-02T12:07:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	and apt-get is just an APT frontend ;)
2007-10-02T12:07:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	the real meat is dpkg and the repos that it manages
2007-10-02T12:08:00.000Z	Absolute0	scguy318_2	i just got used to apt-get
2007-10-02T12:08:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	some people here recommend aptitude, but all the same for me :P
2007-10-02T12:09:00.000Z	Absolute0	scguy318_2	does tremulous require opengl?
2007-10-02T12:10:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	of course, its a 3D game, there are tons of other games tbh
2007-10-02T12:10:00.000Z	Absolute0	scguy318_2	i got an ati card and its not supported on linux :(
2007-10-02T12:10:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	that do not require 3D
2007-10-02T12:10:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	well, i hear the latest ATI driver due sometime this month may rectify that
2007-10-02T12:15:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	they are
2007-10-02T12:16:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	the driver packages in the repos are obviously not the latest
2007-10-02T12:16:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	but a better bet of working a-ok
2007-10-02T12:16:00.000Z	Absolute0	scguy318_2	i dont need latest i need working
2007-10-02T12:24:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	aptitude has a CLI interface
2007-10-02T12:24:00.000Z	Absolute0	scguy318_2	isnt apt-get cli as well?
2007-10-02T12:25:00.000Z	scguy318_2	Absolute0	yeah, but aptitude has more of an interface, so to speak, so if you typed aptitude, you would get a window that looks similar to dpkg-reconfigure
