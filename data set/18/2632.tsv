2011-01-24T20:27:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Greetings Ubuntu
2011-01-24T20:27:00.000Z	livingdaylight		I have jpg for background where I canst put it?
2011-01-24T20:29:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	Put it in ~/Pictures/
2011-01-24T20:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	is there not one folder where are all other backgrounds are kept?
2011-01-24T20:30:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	You're talking about system-wide configuration. Yeah, few backgrounds are kept in there -- but that's also the reason why you can't delete them. Put it in ~/Pictures/ and select it from there.
2011-01-24T20:31:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	i thought I was master of my computer
2011-01-24T20:31:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	You are. If you had to ask us where -- then you're not really a master. :)
2011-01-24T20:33:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	no, I am measly servant <sniff>
2011-01-24T20:35:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	http://tinyurl.com/qg7kdq -- Look at /usr/share/ -- It is there for a reason -- So the other users can have that sweet wallpapers too.
2011-01-24T20:38:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	yes, another reason I want to put picture with other wallpapers, so ALL users can have that sweet experience. Do, they have to png or is jpg ok?
2011-01-24T20:39:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	I think either will work fine. However, /usr/share/ is not the place where you should put your wallpapers in. I have mine in /home/chris/Pictures/Backgrounds/ -- This way, I can sync the backgrounds across multiple machines. :)
2011-01-24T20:39:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	You can do /home/chris/Backgrounds/ -- That's fine too.
2011-01-24T20:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	i make /home/livingdaylight/.wallpapers
2011-01-24T20:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	how do you sync your desktop across other machines?
2011-01-24T20:41:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	You want to hide that folder. That's fine. :) As long as it's in $HOME.
2011-01-24T20:41:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	lsyncd -- It is similiar to Dropbox.
2011-01-24T20:42:00.000Z	red2kic	livingdaylight	http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/
2011-01-24T20:43:00.000Z	livingdaylight	red2kic	thx
