2005-11-16T15:50:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Install a video card, plug in a monitor, and run, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" from the command line and follow the prompts. :-)
2005-11-16T15:50:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	Thanks
2005-11-16T15:50:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	I'll try
2005-11-16T15:51:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 That assumes you installed a graphical environment, etc.
2005-11-16T15:51:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	I have gnome and kde both installed
2005-11-16T15:52:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Then you should be in business :-)
2005-11-16T15:54:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	I hope so :(
2005-11-16T16:00:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	I did the reconfig and I still get the same error reports
2005-11-16T16:03:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Bummer!  Is the video adapter being recognized during autodetection?  If not, you might need to edit your xorg.conf file manually and enter the bus id for it.
2005-11-16T16:03:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	It recornizes it
2005-11-16T16:03:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 What is the error you get when gdm tries to start?
2005-11-16T16:05:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	it saus that no symbols found, no devices found, no sreens found
2005-11-16T16:05:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Also, what video adapter are you using?
2005-11-16T16:10:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Did you install xorg-driver-fglrx yet?
2005-11-16T16:13:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Well anyway, good luck with it... I'm off to bed now!
2005-11-16T16:13:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	yep
2005-11-16T16:13:00.000Z	DJHasis	QRZ	Okay
2005-11-16T16:14:00.000Z	QRZ	DJHasis	 Wish I had time to help further but I have to be up in 5 and a half hours!
