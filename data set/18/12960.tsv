2012-03-14T07:39:00.000Z	WilsonBradley		12.04 works nice with Compiz
2012-03-14T07:40:00.000Z	WilsonBradley		After install, had to update Compiz to weekly build, drivers, and  latest Unity
2012-03-14T07:41:00.000Z	WilsonBradley		OK, im using Pidgin, seems to crash when I try to enable google account. Also IRC Channel window  Like this one, I can't read what I type. the bottom bar is to thin to read.
2012-03-14T07:43:00.000Z	WilsonBradley		I remember Beryl
2012-03-14T07:44:00.000Z	WilsonBradley		seemed like Beryl=Compiz
2012-03-14T07:44:00.000Z	WilsonBradley		Whats the best chat client?
2012-03-14T07:44:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	I have been using X-Chat for years. I lurves it.
2012-03-14T07:47:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	It's a bit more hands-on. If you set your favorite network to autojoin with some good channels and whatnot, and tell the network dialog to skip on startup, you're in good shape. I also recommend switching from tab to tree view.
2012-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	It's in the view options. Channel Switcher
2012-03-14T07:49:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	No, X-Chat
2012-03-14T07:52:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	What are you setting? You have to click "Edit" after you type the network name.
2012-03-14T07:58:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	It's irc.freenode.net
2012-03-14T08:01:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	You mean it's just doing that?
2012-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	Have you tested your hard drive recently? If the config file for X-Chat is giving you issues, I'd worry about write errors on the disk.
2012-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	You should check dmesg for I/O error reports just in case. It seems like the settings aren't sticking in X-Chat.
2012-03-14T08:08:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	Okay, so in X-Chat you closed the Network Connection dialog and went to the bottom of the window, clicked on the text area, typed "/server irc.freenode.net" and it said it was connecting to gamesnet?
2012-03-14T08:10:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	Got any firewalls? That could do it I guess. I don't know at this point. Maybe your computer is possessed. Call an exorcist.
2012-03-14T08:11:00.000Z	Draconicus	WilsonBradley	Are you on wireless? Can you open a termianl and ping 85.94.204.146?
