2009-11-17T17:51:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	what are you trying to do, view a movie file?
2009-11-17T17:52:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	Do you have anything important on your system? (I.e., is it your main system with all your documents?)
2009-11-17T17:53:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	Because if it's just a test system for trying out Ubuntu, I would just say, reinstall.
2009-11-17T17:54:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	Of course, you can load up the install live CD or another recovery CD and try to muck around
2009-11-17T17:56:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	By the way, do you have a separate partition for home? If you do, you're in luck, just reinstall to your system partition, and leave your home partition alone. *note: you have to specify your partitioning scheme in the setup, though.
2009-11-17T17:57:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	I have a couple of 16GB system partitions (for trying out different distributions, and different versions of Ubuntu), and a 800GB home partition. That way, no matter what system I'm in, I still have access to my files. Also, I can fully blow away a system installation, and still have my files.
2009-11-17T17:59:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	I would say, copy your important files to a USB flash disk, and reinstall, this time with a couple of system partitions, and a separate home partition. You can do this during the installation (which will be easiest).
2009-11-17T18:03:00.000Z	starhash	ubuntu	By the way, here's something else you can do besides reinstall: Run a live CD, and install Start Up Manager. sudo apt-get install startupmanager
