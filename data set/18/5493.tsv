2010-03-18T15:15:00.000Z	stanley_		i have a question,if anyone could help me,that would be nice!
2010-03-18T15:16:00.000Z	stanley_		lspci can display any hardware infomation, for example, ethernet card,and ifconfig displays any infomation about interface such as eth0. if i have more than one card, how could i know which one use the specify card.
2010-03-18T15:18:00.000Z	stanley_		anyone?
2010-03-18T15:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	stanley_	of the same chipset/driver?
2010-03-18T15:19:00.000Z	stanley_	psycho_oreos	oh,no,for example, i have 2 cards with different chipset.
2010-03-18T15:20:00.000Z	stanley_		and i have interface eth0 and eth1. how do i know which card does eth0 use?
2010-03-18T15:21:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	stanley_	well usually the first one detected via kernel and outputted via dmesg indicates that should be specified as eth0 whilst the second detected chipset/driver by kernel will become eth1
2010-03-18T15:21:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	stanley_	to resolve that I'd modify udev rules
2010-03-18T15:22:00.000Z	stanley_	psycho_oreos	thanks. let me check my dmesg log.
2010-03-18T15:22:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	stanley_	though I can see your problem, it'll be even worse when the drivers alternate between eth0 and eth1
2010-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	stanley_	psycho_oreos	it's boring. sometimes you don't know which interface is used.
2010-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	stanley_	there are a few solutions but I don't know of an easy way apart from getting dirty with linux CLI
2010-03-18T15:26:00.000Z	stanley_	psycho_oreos	just now i check my dmesg log, find this "[    1.598582] eth0: RealTek RTL8139 at 0xd800, 00:e0:4c:3c:ad:14, IRQ 19
2010-03-18T15:26:00.000Z	stanley_		"
2010-03-18T15:26:00.000Z	stanley_	psycho_oreos	that's great! thanks a lot!
2010-03-18T15:26:00.000Z	stanley_		10.04 is excellent
2010-03-18T15:27:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	stanley_	hopefully the drivers won't alternate between ethX
