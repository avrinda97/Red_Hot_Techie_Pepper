2010-04-07T06:24:00.000Z	gdory		any ubuntu devs behind 10.04 live disk explain why when i boot into the live cd, it changes data on all installed/attached hard drives?
2010-04-07T06:25:00.000Z	gdory		i have two disks, a vfat & an ext3, both on a system which i ran the live cd on.. i noticed they thrashed my HD's, so i sha1summed the disks before and after, and the 10.04 disk changes data on them? why is this & why is this not in any agreement?
2010-04-07T06:26:00.000Z	gdory		even the 9.10 live cd does similar?
2010-04-07T06:26:00.000Z	gdory		why are live disks altering data on hard drives which are not needed?
2010-04-07T06:26:00.000Z	gdory		but does not answer why ubuntu has been doing it since 9.04
2010-04-07T06:26:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	did you mount them?  if so then access timestamps would be updated on ext3
2010-04-07T06:28:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	again, did you mount it?  did you open the drive in the places menu?
2010-04-07T06:29:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	does it have a swap partition?
2010-04-07T06:29:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	if you have a swap partition on the disk then the livecd will use it
2010-04-07T06:32:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	no, you're ranting and spouting bs... "what is it changing on my hd" would be a question, one which we were trying to help you answer
2010-04-07T06:32:00.000Z	gdory	psusi	no
2010-04-07T06:33:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	the most likely answer to that is either because it found a swap partition, or because you asked it to mount the filesystems
2010-04-07T06:33:00.000Z	gdory	psusi	this disk has two paritions
2010-04-07T06:34:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	and was the ext2fs cleanly unmounted?  you checked the two partitions independently?
2010-04-07T06:34:00.000Z	gdory	psusi	yes it was
2010-04-07T06:36:00.000Z	psusi	gdory	one guess would be that it was not cleanly unmounted so it fscked it
2010-04-07T06:36:00.000Z	gdory	psusi	besides the point
