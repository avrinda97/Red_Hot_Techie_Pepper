2010-07-16T03:33:00.000Z	webPragmatist		how can i make a init.d script start at boot
2010-07-16T03:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 this is a script you made?
2010-07-16T03:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 runlevel 2 is the default
2010-07-16T03:33:00.000Z	webPragmatist	Dr_Willis	yea
2010-07-16T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 you may want to learn to do things the upstart way then.
2010-07-16T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 or just start the script from /etc/rc.local
2010-07-16T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 see /etc/init for upstart init scripts
2010-07-16T03:34:00.000Z	webPragmatist	Dr_Willis	what do you mean upstart way? â€¦ i just followed http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s-/etc/init.d for the most part and was able to use the start-stop-daemon thingy ant it worked :)
2010-07-16T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 ubuntu is slowly getting away from usign the sysv init system. and is using 'upstart' now.
2010-07-16T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 so that guide is proberly a bit out of date for ubnuntu.
2010-07-16T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 with each release fewer and fewer services use the sysv methods.
2010-07-16T03:35:00.000Z	webPragmatist	Dr_Willis	well do you have something else i can read? or an example?
2010-07-16T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 look at the scripts in /etc/init
2010-07-16T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 and check the ubuntu forums/wiki pages for upstart docs. I only dable with it a little.
2010-07-16T03:38:00.000Z	webPragmatist	Dr_Willis	oh i see so each rc* would be a certain point at which it starts...
2010-07-16T03:40:00.000Z	webPragmatist	Dr_Willis	have you built init.d scripts before?
2011-02-25T22:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 carefull use of 'find'
2011-02-25T22:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	webPragmatist	 i would make it 'mv' the files to some directory first.. so you can double check.
