2006-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	PulsatingPenguin		can anyone help me with my error?  "Buffer I/O error on device dm-1, logical block xxxxx"?
2006-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	jbmigel	PulsatingPenguin	can you boot from cd and mount that drive?
2006-10-24T16:20:00.000Z	PulsatingPenguin	jbmigel	I have no live CD but I could burn one
2006-10-24T16:20:00.000Z	jbmigel	PulsatingPenguin	unless you have another drive around with some linux on it
2006-10-24T16:21:00.000Z	jbmigel	PulsatingPenguin	ya then id make a boot disk
2006-10-24T16:22:00.000Z	jbmigel	PulsatingPenguin	could be a smart error, or hardware failure who knows... mount the drive and it might go away
2006-10-24T16:23:00.000Z	PulsatingPenguin	jbmigel	ok, thanks.  I will try burning a liveCD and booting from that...then removing the option to mount my windows partition at boot, in case that is it, I will also fsck the drive :)
2006-10-24T16:24:00.000Z	jbmigel	PulsatingPenguin	you might want to add, mounting the drive and backin up your data in there somewhere
2006-10-24T16:25:00.000Z	PulsatingPenguin	jbmigel	ok, I will.  Thanks :)
