2009-12-10T03:37:00.000Z	wrb1234		is arno-iptables-firewall the package name for iptables
2009-12-10T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	nope
2009-12-10T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	I mean.. that's not the base package for iptables.. if that's what you're asking
2009-12-10T03:38:00.000Z	wrb1234		hmm
2009-12-10T03:39:00.000Z	wrb1234		ah okay, slart i just started an unmanaged vps and need to figure out what to do to get iptables up and secure my stuff
2009-12-10T03:39:00.000Z	wrb1234		:P
2009-12-10T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	hmm..iptables should be installed by default afaik.. regardless of what ubuntu version you're using
2009-12-10T03:40:00.000Z	wrb1234		how can i check?
2009-12-10T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	try running "sudo iptables -L"
2009-12-10T03:41:00.000Z	wrb1234		sudo: iptables: command not found (Slart)
2009-12-10T03:42:00.000Z	Slart		!info iptables | wrb1234
2009-12-10T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	this one looks promising
2009-12-10T03:43:00.000Z	wrb1234		hmm
2009-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	Slart		!ru | bhychik
2009-12-10T03:45:00.000Z	wrb1234		sudo apt-get install iptables then? that wouldnt hurt anything?
2009-12-10T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	I have no idea what kind of setup you have.. you will probably need to reboot.. not sure what it will do to your servers network stuff
2009-12-10T03:47:00.000Z	wrb1234	Slart	i understand... thanks, i just got a 540MB Linode and im playing with it :D i appreciate your help so far
2009-12-10T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	wrb1234	you're welcome
