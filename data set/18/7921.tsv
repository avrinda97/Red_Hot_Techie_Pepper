2007-12-12T18:31:00.000Z	sharpie		is there any way to connect my phone to the pc? (Nec 411i). in windows you need some nec software to do it, any equivilant program in linux?
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	what are you talking about
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	deleting xorg.conf
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	he doesn't need to delete or re-install
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	deleting it is just as good \=
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	no its not
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	as nothing is configured
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	yes, so you reconfigure it
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	takes 2 minutes through the config wizard
2007-12-12T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	you don't need to delete or re-install though
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	if you have nvidia-glx-new, the driver's section in xorg.conf will be lost
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	so you need to reinstall
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	no you don't
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	it will get put back when you do dpkg-reconfigure
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	ok, that's how i solved my problems anyway \=
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	actually, not reinstall, just re-check it in the restricted drivers
2007-12-12T18:36:00.000Z	sharpie	ikonia	as far as i recall
2007-12-12T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sharpie	you don't need to do anything other than "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
