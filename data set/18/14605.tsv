2006-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	use sudo modprobe
2006-01-11T14:56:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	pastebin dmesg|tail -n 20
2006-01-11T14:57:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	pastebin is a place to paste on the web. I want you to paste the output of "dmesg|tail -n20"
2006-01-11T14:58:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	read /msg from ubotu
2006-01-11T14:59:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	well if you can't paste the log I don't know how to help
2006-01-11T15:00:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	that's not an error message. I need the output of dmesg and you can't paste it in here or people get pissed
2006-01-11T15:02:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	I can't say anything unless I see what dmesg says
2006-01-14T17:44:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	what chip is that?
2006-01-14T17:45:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	no model number or anything?
2006-01-14T17:45:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	in that case I'd first try the laptop wiki
2006-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	a wiki search came up with this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/CompaqPresarioM2000
2006-01-14T17:48:00.000Z	mwe	Tyrsis	it says the wifi works with ndiswrapper, you probably gotta check the ndiswrapper.sf.net page for the correct driver to use though
