2004-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	punkass		its an pretty slick way of mounting shares
2004-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	punkass		it finds all shares on the network
2004-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	punkass		then u can just select them and it mounts them to a directory of your choice
2004-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	punkass		yeah..it works good..
2004-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	punkass		but
2004-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	punkass		say in rhythm box i wanna import a folder from a share
2004-09-28T11:29:00.000Z	punkass		when i get the dialog box there is no "network" menu item
2004-09-28T11:30:00.000Z	punkass		so i get browse to them
2004-09-28T11:30:00.000Z	punkass		get = cant
2004-09-28T11:30:00.000Z	punkass		you understand what i mean?
2004-09-28T11:31:00.000Z	whiprush	punkass	if it's mounted it shows up in the bookmark section of the file selector when you want to import music in rhythmbox.
2004-09-28T11:34:00.000Z	punkass	whiprush	well i can go to the shared music folder in nautilus no prob, but i can not see it in the file selector of rhythmbox
2004-09-28T11:36:00.000Z	whiprush	punkass	go to file->connect to server in nautilus, choose "windows share" as service type, type in your info.
2004-09-28T11:36:00.000Z	whiprush	punkass	then all your gnome apps will have a cool little shortcut to it in the file selector.
2004-09-28T11:37:00.000Z	whiprush	punkass	the cool thing is, you can do that with ftp, ssh, etc. etc.
2004-09-28T11:46:00.000Z	punkass	whiprush	thanks for that...works like a charm..
2004-09-28T12:05:00.000Z	punkass	whiprush	am i able to view those bookmarks i made other than in a file dialog box?
2004-09-28T12:05:00.000Z	whiprush	punkass	in your "network" icon in the menu
