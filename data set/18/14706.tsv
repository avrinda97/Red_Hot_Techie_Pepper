2005-06-30T13:28:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	what is your problem exactly ?
2005-06-30T13:35:00.000Z	ChurcH_of_FoamY	eks	well i'm trying to set it up to check my email with firefox and every 120seconds it opens up firefox
2005-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	it's normal that it open firefox if you ask it to verify your mails with firefox
2005-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	remove the name off firefox in the configuration
2005-06-30T13:38:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	where is your mailbox ?
2005-06-30T13:40:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	just add your account in the milboxes to check
2005-06-30T13:42:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	be sure to remove messages from the server when downloading them in thunderbird
2005-06-30T13:46:00.000Z	eks	ChurcH_of_FoamY	right
