2009-09-04T06:40:00.000Z	arand	graphic	I think the color stuff mught be dependent on some package as well...
2009-09-04T06:42:00.000Z	graphic	arand	but it works for the admin account just none of the new accounts
2009-09-04T06:43:00.000Z	arand	graphic	and the .bashrc is available to those users, and readable?
2009-09-04T06:43:00.000Z	graphic		seems so
2009-09-04T06:44:00.000Z	graphic		the users own them
2009-09-04T06:45:00.000Z	arand	graphic	if you do "source ~/.bashrc with the user?
2009-09-04T06:45:00.000Z	graphic		nope haha
2009-09-04T06:45:00.000Z	graphic		let me trys that
2009-09-04T06:46:00.000Z	arand	graphic	but if you login with the user I think it's done automatically...
2009-09-04T06:47:00.000Z	arand	graphic	worth a try though, you might even get an error to hunt...
2009-09-04T06:48:00.000Z	graphic		bash cant find source on those users logged in
2009-09-04T06:55:00.000Z	arand	graphic	so those users are not allowed to use source?
2009-09-04T06:56:00.000Z	graphic	arand	I dont know bash just cant seem to find it
2009-09-04T06:58:00.000Z	arand	graphic	hmm, source is a natvie bash command... I'm just as confused here... you could ask in #ubuntu-server
2009-09-04T07:00:00.000Z	graphic		arand:
2009-09-04T07:00:00.000Z	graphic		$ source
2009-09-04T07:00:00.000Z	graphic		-sh: source: not found
2009-09-04T07:02:00.000Z	graphic	arand	figured it out, my users were in /etc/passwd all those users are set to use sh not bash, quick edit and it works
