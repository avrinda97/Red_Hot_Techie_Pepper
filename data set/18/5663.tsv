2008-09-20T00:41:00.000Z	omac	babaklinux	how are you doing?  Have you added the line 'deb http://parsix.org/packages ramon main' to your /etc/apt/sources.list yet.
2008-09-20T00:41:00.000Z	babaklinux	omac	this is for parsix ﻿ etc/apt/sources.list file:  deb http://parsix.org/packages ramon main no ubuntu
2008-09-20T00:46:00.000Z	omac	babaklinux	please understand .deb files are debian based files.  The ubuntu is debian based also.  You may use this repository for installing xfardic.  It may have conflicts, but I read somewhere that others have succeeded in installing xfardic on ubuntu.
2008-09-20T00:59:00.000Z	babaklinux	omac	what command doid you use for install?
2008-09-20T01:00:00.000Z	babaklinux	omac	i used this command for install but don't work apt-get install xfardic
2008-09-20T01:02:00.000Z	omac	babaklinux	use synaptics or aptitude instead.  Once you are more comfortable, you may return to using the commandline
2008-09-20T01:03:00.000Z	babaklinux	omac	did you install it from ﻿synaptics ?
2008-09-20T01:03:00.000Z	omac	babaklinux	no.  I am not running farsi language stuff.
2008-09-20T01:05:00.000Z	babaklinux	omac	now do i have to insert this line deb http://parsix.org/packages ramon main  to sources.list  ??
