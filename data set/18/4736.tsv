2009-05-20T11:50:00.000Z	maco	hegde	you can set a FAT32 label on it, but those only go up to like 8 characters or something...
2009-05-20T11:52:00.000Z	hegde	maco	okay...the if i insert any sdcard having any name will that be mounted in /media as the one we give as a FAT32 label???
2009-05-20T11:55:00.000Z	hegde	maco	then if i insert any sdcard having any name will that be mounted in /media as the one we give as a FAT32 label???
2009-05-20T11:56:00.000Z	maco	hegde	it'll still be /media/disk or /media/disk-1 or whatever, but on the desktop it'll show the FAT32 label as its name
2009-05-20T11:58:00.000Z	maco	hegde	^
2009-05-20T11:59:00.000Z	maco	hegde	AH well hm....
2009-05-20T11:59:00.000Z	maco	hegde	i think if you get rid of the FAT32 label it'll go with /media/disk
2009-05-20T12:00:00.000Z	maco	hegde	you could also setup in /etc/fstab for /dev/sdb1 to *always* be /media/disk or something
2009-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	hegde	maco	fstab works but evertime i insert and remove an error that only root can do it occurs
2009-05-20T12:41:00.000Z	maco	hegde	can mount w/ "sudo mount" but um....system -> administration -> authorizations might be able to let hal do it automagic
2009-05-20T12:41:00.000Z	hegde	maco	i have written a GUI program that shud read from a SDCARD and display the text and image files in it
2009-05-20T12:43:00.000Z	hegde	maco	i want my code to be such that it shud be same always
2009-05-20T12:43:00.000Z	hegde	maco	shud i go writing a device driver kind of thing.?>
2009-05-20T12:44:00.000Z	maco	hegde	no!
2009-05-20T12:45:00.000Z	maco	hegde	you either need to manually mount the card each time, or you need to go in authorizations and give hal permission to mount it iwhtout asking
2009-05-20T12:45:00.000Z	maco	hegde	putting "user" in the mount options in fstab should also let you mount without sudo
2009-05-20T12:45:00.000Z	hegde	maco	nice two options then :) thanks i will try now... :)
