2010-07-24T15:24:00.000Z	J_Brady		May I ask something that's probably an FAQ?
2010-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	J_Brady		... I have a machine with five HDD's in it currently (two are linked together in raid 1) ... Windows XP Pro SP3 is installed on the raid 1 array.  Windows 7 is installed on another drive, and was installed second.  When I boot, I get a menu where I can select either Windows 7 or "previous version of windows" ...am I able to install Ubuntu from within windows?
2010-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	J_Brady		I'm just wondering if Ubuntu will be able to set up a three-way boot, with access to both win7 and winxp..
2010-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	J_Brady	should be fine
2010-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	J_Brady		should be, or definitely?
2010-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	J_Brady	install the two windows first, then ubuntu and it should detect them find
2010-07-24T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	J_Brady	it can boot any ammount of OS's, manually set them up, the should part is the auto detect
2010-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	J_Brady		If I install Ubuntu from the windows 7 desktop, will I be able to see if it autodetects both operating systems before choosing to install?
2010-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	J_Brady		Or would I be able to see that from the liveboot?
2010-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	J_Brady	no, that will be using wubi
2010-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	J_Brady	pallgone	are you talking to me?
2010-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia		!cn | acer_
2010-07-24T15:32:00.000Z	J_Brady		Well, ikonia seems to have gone afk.  Can someone tell me what wubi is?  Sorry, I'm a mostly a Linux noob, considering installing Ubuntu in a three-way boot.
2010-07-24T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia		!wubi | J_Brady
2010-07-24T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia		!install | J_Brady
2010-07-24T15:33:00.000Z	J_Brady		I mean, windows 7, windows xp and ubuntu all installed on the same machine, but installed to different hard drives.
2010-07-24T15:34:00.000Z	J_Brady		I know you can also install more than one operating system to the same hard drive with partioning, but I would prefer seperate drives.
2010-07-24T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	J_Brady	that a fine configuration, no issue with 3 seperate drives
