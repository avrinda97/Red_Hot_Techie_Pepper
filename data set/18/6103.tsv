2008-06-30T03:48:00.000Z	bminuk2		are daily livecd builds safe for use?
2008-06-30T03:49:00.000Z	bminuk2		What is being released on July 3rd?
2008-06-30T03:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bminuk2	daily builds of betas are not going to be stable enough for for your everyday system unless you dual boot and use ti for testing etc
2008-06-30T03:52:00.000Z	bminuk2		ok
2008-06-30T03:52:00.000Z	bminuk2		Will all ubuntus be updated on the 3rd?
2008-06-30T03:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bminuk2	where are you looking that you see this info
2008-06-30T03:53:00.000Z	bminuk2	Jack_Sparrow	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyReleaseSchedule
2008-06-30T03:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bminuk2	what are you looking to accomplish
2008-06-30T03:55:00.000Z	bminuk2	Jack_Sparrow	I am trying to get a novice onto ubuntu.  Step 1 is to get a current (bug fixed, ssl ok) image of xubuntu.  Step 2 is to remote control it to manage the install
2008-06-30T03:56:00.000Z	bminuk2		I don"t think I can remote control using ssh if the livecd is not updated
2008-06-30T03:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bminuk2	Remote control of install..  Why when it is so easy...?  July 3rd should be stabel.. I thought you were looking at +1 daily builds..
2008-06-30T03:58:00.000Z	bminuk2		I guess I should just try it the old way (over the phone..)
2008-06-30T03:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bminuk2	Have they even run livecd yet
2008-06-30T03:58:00.000Z	bminuk2		But it would be nice if all ubuntus had user initiated (outgoing connection) help facilties
2008-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	bminuk2	Jack_Sparrow	they are currently using a xubuntu 7.10 livecd
2008-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	bminuk2		I have to get the new cd to them
2008-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	bminuk2		they seem to like ubuntu , but find it slow (running on the livecd) and limited (no flash on the livecd)
2008-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bminuk2	Once they update that they will have 8041
