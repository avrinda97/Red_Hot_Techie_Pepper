2007-03-14T07:39:00.000Z	MKR	sorush20	that should do it. That makes the tail command watch for changes to the messages log

2007-03-14T07:40:00.000Z	MKR	sorush20	it has nothing to do with your network. /var/log/messages should show a very distinct message when you plug the device in
2007-03-14T07:40:00.000Z	MKR		Somwthing like "device found on /dev/whatever"
