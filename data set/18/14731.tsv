2005-06-20T16:43:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	is this after wiping out the partition table and starting anew or is this just a freeze/error in the installer?
2005-06-20T16:44:00.000Z	Alia25	mae	it starts, but error stops the installer after 33%
2005-06-20T16:45:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	probably an issue with the new installer on that hardware. look at the boot options on the installer setup.. i think its f5 or something like that.. try acpi=off
2005-06-20T16:45:00.000Z	Alia25	mae	Hey now, i'm not that technical :D
2005-06-20T16:46:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	well sometimes you gotta be :) linux isn't that polished yet, just give it a shot, when it says "press enter to boot" try this option: acpi=off
2005-06-20T16:46:00.000Z	Alia25	mae	ok.. one sec :D
2005-06-20T16:49:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	at the command line just try "acpi=off" without the quotes
2005-06-20T16:49:00.000Z	Alia25	mae	hmm: "could not find kernel image: acpi=off"
2005-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	try "noacpi"
2005-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	sorry its pci=noacpi
2005-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	actually try all this on one line mineaswell turn off all the buggy stuff: "noapic nolapic pci=noacpi"
2005-06-20T16:54:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	ya it looks like you do need the "linux" preceding the parameters
2005-06-20T16:54:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	any luck?
2005-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	Alia25	mae	nope :(
2005-06-20T16:56:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	try wiping out the entire partition table and starting from scratch.. i think the "automatic" option will do that.
2005-06-20T16:57:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	with the partitioner do you choose the "automatic" option or do you do it manually
2005-06-20T05:19:00.000Z	mae	Alia25	did you get your installation going?
2005-06-20T05:19:00.000Z	Alia25	mae	no me and moquist is working on it in private
