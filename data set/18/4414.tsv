2009-05-07T16:50:00.000Z	RAMco		hi there
2009-05-07T16:51:00.000Z	RAMco		i removed ubuntu and resized the harddisk to reinstall windows but the windows installer dose not detct it, and when i boot up with out the CD i get the linux boot screen :S
2009-05-07T16:52:00.000Z	RAMco		can anyone help ?
2009-05-07T16:52:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	sounds like a windows problem . it should detected the hard drive no matter what in the installer
2009-05-07T16:54:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	to get rid of the linux boot screen you need to probably use grub uninstall but it's just residual linux cruft
2009-05-07T16:54:00.000Z	RAMco	peaches	 i dont think so i belive so, i have a live CD for windows and it dose not detct the harddisk, the only system detecting the disk now is linux
2009-05-07T16:55:00.000Z	RAMco	peaches	 how do i unistall the grub ?
2009-05-07T16:55:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	did you mess with the hardware itself at any point in the installation?
2009-05-07T16:56:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	well the grub thing shouldn't matter for anything but if microsoft installer sucks that much and you need to, you can probably boot the live CD and do it but would require some comman line ninjitsu
2009-05-07T16:56:00.000Z	RAMco	peaches	 the live CD is only a system restore not infatct the whole windows system
2009-05-07T16:57:00.000Z	RAMco	peaches	 the live CD is winternal :S
2009-05-07T16:57:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	i'm thinking what you can do is boot the liveCD and do "sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/my/disk bs=512 count=1" to completely destroy the mbr or fiddle around with cfdisk on it
2009-05-07T16:59:00.000Z	RAMco	peaches	 i do NOT have any data on the disk i need so i can do what ever to restore it
2009-05-07T16:59:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	well either way the microshaft installer shouldnt be so finicky, unless the system restore is so anal that it requires some indication youre not trying to just restore onto another disk other than the original and checks mbr for that
2009-05-07T17:00:00.000Z	RAMco	peaches	 dose the fact that the drive is SATA efect anything ?
2009-05-07T17:00:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	in which case you may be able to restore a DOS mbr with fdisk or cfdisk or something. either way it's a microshaft problem
2009-05-07T17:00:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	it could who knows what microshaft does
2009-05-07T17:01:00.000Z	peaches	RAMco	just put windows 7 RC on there for a year for now
