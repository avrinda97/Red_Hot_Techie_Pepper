2005-11-16T08:37:00.000Z	_Dez		how do i delete DRivers??
2005-11-16T08:38:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	what are you really trying to do?
2005-11-16T08:39:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	im trying to remove fan.ko | thermal.ko
2005-11-16T08:40:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	to remove them from use, sudo rmmod fan ; sudo rmmod thermal
2005-11-16T08:40:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	you man need to remove modules that depend upon them first.
2005-11-16T08:41:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	how do i do that
2005-11-16T08:42:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	do sudo rmmod thermal   complain?  if so it will say what depends on it.
2005-11-16T08:45:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	i get ERROR: MOdule fan does not exist in /proc/modules | module thermal does not exist in /proc/modules
2005-11-16T08:46:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	use:    sudo lsmod   to get a list of what is currently loaded
2005-11-16T08:50:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	its not loaded b/c it wont load on boot
2005-11-16T08:51:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	i thought you wanted to remove a driver module.
2005-11-16T08:58:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	when i boot up my pc it says Fatal eRror no device */acpi/fan.ko same with thermal
2005-11-16T08:59:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	so the fan and thermal drivers can't find your hardware.  supported?  some module configuration file needed?
2005-11-16T09:00:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	my LAptop doesnt have ACPI
2005-11-16T09:00:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	perhaps that is the problem.
2005-11-16T09:01:00.000Z	_Dez	MarcN	i dont want it tto try to load them at all.
2005-11-16T09:01:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	they aren't getting successfully loaded.  doesn't cause a problem,  just the message on boot, right?
2005-11-16T09:04:00.000Z	MarcN	_Dez	are you sure that that is what is slowing down?  could be the next thing starting up.  You could muck around in /etc/mod* to remove them.  Been a while since i needed to mess with module configuraiton
