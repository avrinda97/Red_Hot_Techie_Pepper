2006-04-14T10:54:00.000Z	Matadamas	_jason	you know? i tried with GAIM and it is same thing, same problem.
2006-04-14T10:55:00.000Z	_jason	Matadamas	by pictures you mean buddy icons or people sending you pictures through direct connect?
2006-04-14T10:55:00.000Z	Matadamas	_jason	it is not msn client, i think some is bad in ubuntu configuration.
2006-04-14T10:56:00.000Z	_jason	Matadamas	I see.. do the buddy icons work if you connect to the aim network?
2006-04-14T11:00:00.000Z	Matadamas	_jason	yes, i used Gain and it is same.
2006-04-14T11:00:00.000Z	_jason	Matadamas	are you sure your buddy has an icon?
2006-04-14T11:00:00.000Z	_jason	Matadamas	/msg me your name and I'll IM you.  Then you can tell me if you see it
2006-04-14T11:00:00.000Z	Matadamas	_jason	100% sure
2006-04-14T11:01:00.000Z	_jason	Matadamas	if you are sure, then try asking the guys in #gaim , they would know better
2006-04-14T11:02:00.000Z	Matadamas	_jason	it is rare thing, i was on amsn channel but nobody knew it. it is stupid idea for getting solution formatting my pc. i think it should be some configuration. but it is not on amsn, it is in ubuntu.
2006-04-14T11:03:00.000Z	Matadamas	_jason	thanks a lot.
