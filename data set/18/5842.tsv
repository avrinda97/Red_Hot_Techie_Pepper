2009-02-18T12:00:00.000Z	spree		I have an issue. I have an OOOOOLD Automatix installation. I installed Swiftweasel with it. I want to remove swiftweasel and install the new version properly. I am running Intrepid. I also need to uninstall Automatix and have no clue how to go about doing it
2009-02-18T12:01:00.000Z	spree		remember Automatix? from 7.10? I still have it and i want rid of it
2009-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	spree		tripps, well what do you want me to do
2009-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	There's no way to remove Automatix, you have to reinstall.
2009-02-18T12:03:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	that's just one of the many reasons we recommend against it.
2009-02-18T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	The Ubuntu community has been crusading against Automatix for a long time now (well, while it was still active).  But, we can't raise awareness everywhere, obviously.
2009-02-18T12:04:00.000Z	spree	Flannel	show me where I am advocating the use of automatix
2009-02-18T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	I never said you were.  I just said we've tried to raise awareness as much as we could.
2009-02-18T12:06:00.000Z	spree	Flannel	you're like the guy who tells a guy who just got hit by a truck that he should avoid being hit by trucks
2009-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	If you want to manually delete lots of files, go right ahead.  There's no easy way for us to explain to you how to restore your system to a state before it was installed.
2009-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	Ok, fine:  Get a vanilla install of Ubuntu, get a list of files on it (ls -lR /) install Automatix (the same version), install all of the software you installed with automatix.  Get another file listing.  Delete the differences.
2009-02-18T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	Other than that, we have no idea, since we don't deal with it.  You wouldn't call up Dell and ask them how to remove some random third party program.
2009-02-18T12:13:00.000Z	spree	Flannel	actually yeah i would because if i were into the whole Dell thing i would pimp that warranty support out as much as possible and they would do it. :)
2009-02-18T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	It's extremely likely that it won't actually work.  Because the automatix repositories and such have been taken offline, and I'm sure URLs of other things have changed as well.  But sure, if you're willing to actually do that, byall means, knock yourself out.  It'll be faster, and cleaner (and you'll have fewer problems) to just reinstall (since automatix not only added files, but *modified* files)
2009-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	Again, please stay on topic.  That topic is: Ubuntu support, not badgering people doing the support.
2009-02-18T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	Actually, being unhelpful is against the channel rules, so no, you won't.
2009-09-22T23:00:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	Please be helpful when helping.
2009-09-22T23:07:00.000Z	Flannel	spree	Drop it.
