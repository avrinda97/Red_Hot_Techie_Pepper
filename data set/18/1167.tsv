2012-06-02T07:34:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	see what it says for a folder that doesnt have all those special mounts underneath it
2012-06-02T07:22:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	what file is this?
2012-06-02T07:28:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	and @sacarlson: this is happening with all my files. using lubuntu 12.04 on a 40gb ext4 hdd
2012-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	can you maybe send a screenshot or something
2012-06-02T07:32:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	can't send you a screenshot, sorry, but the file properties for / say 7.2 GB total size of files and 48.4 GB size on disk. (installed the os yesterday)
2012-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	its probably just confused by some of the stuff in /proc or /sys
2012-06-02T07:35:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	well, /proc and /sys return ~1.6 GB total size and no size on disk
2012-06-02T07:37:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	while the rest of the directories is 5.7 GB total size of files and 48.6 GB size on disk
2012-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	baobob can help you narrow down where this is coming from. do you have encrypted home?
2012-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	and my nearly-empty-except-for-configs home directory is 104.8 MB total size and 820.6 MB size on disk
2012-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	no my /home is not encrypted
2012-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	maybe someone forgot to divide by 8 in the code. i dont know what filemanager you are using that is reporting these numbers but try baobob
2012-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	using pcmanfm 0.9.10
2012-06-02T07:42:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=115516
2012-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	thank you so much
2012-06-02T07:56:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	did you say chromium or chromium-browser?
2012-06-02T07:59:00.000Z	mahir256	escott	i tried both chromium and chromium-browser. anyway the problem has been rectified - in other news, why is seamonkey no longer part of the main repositories?
2012-06-02T08:00:00.000Z	escott	mahir256	chromium is a 2d side scroller.... fun but not a browser
