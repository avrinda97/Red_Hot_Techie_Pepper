2007-01-21T06:23:00.000Z	Enverex		Am I going insane or did the "What packages do you want to see added to Feisty?" thread dissapear?
2007-01-21T06:23:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	I suspect it disappeared. feisty will be out in less than three months, I suspect they've stopped with that kind of thing.... you could report a "request"-level bug
2007-01-21T06:24:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	I'm just supprised, I went to post in it as it was just a normal thread on the forum, but I can't find it, I would have thought it would be locked or something
2007-01-21T06:24:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	true.
2007-01-21T06:44:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	Exactly the same as if they did "sudo rm -rf /" heh
2007-01-21T06:44:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	yes, but presumably they don't know the password that sudo then demands
2007-01-26T17:04:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	you can run it from a livecd if you like...
2007-01-26T17:05:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	I'd rather not try and fish one out. I mean this should be pretty simple, is there no way of sing it?
2007-01-26T17:05:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	Yeah I know the Syntax, I've been using Linux for 6 years
2007-01-26T17:06:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	in that case, edit your initfile to include it and then remove it next book
2007-01-26T17:22:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	we've been through this. modify your initscripts or use a livecd
2007-01-26T17:22:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	I was just wondering if there was any simple obvious way of doing it. Editing the firstrun initscripts could easily bork the system and I have little free time to unbork
2007-01-26T17:23:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	livecd it is then
2007-01-26T17:29:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	?
2007-01-26T17:30:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	then it's clean, surely
2007-01-26T17:30:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	That's not the point, I WANT a check and I don't believe that it is clean
2007-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	goodgerster	Enverex	why do you not trust the system? it knows rather more about itself than you do... nevertheless, I'm sure man or google will supply a switch to force it
2007-01-26T17:32:00.000Z	Enverex	goodgerster	I've encountered enough different issues over the many years and I had to do some funky things to get Ubuntu installed in the first place with filesystems
