2010-06-08T19:05:00.000Z	selenia		I have a very weird problem with an old pc with i810 graphics. It works fine with the original Ubuntu user, but if I create any new accounts, then I will get lockup messages about drm when starting gdm, and it will crash back to login screen
2010-06-08T19:05:00.000Z	selenia		restarting gdm I should say
2010-06-08T19:05:00.000Z	selenia		the additional users can be logged into from cli just fine
2010-06-08T19:07:00.000Z	selenia		Does anyone have a solution to this either? I posted this in a big forum-over 30 uniqs, no replies
2010-06-08T19:08:00.000Z	selenia		so, in other words, X only locks up with additional gnome users-not the original gnome user. However, the additional users can be logged into from anything else, like an xterm
2010-06-08T19:10:00.000Z	selenia		I checked that, the additional ones seem to be added to all the relevant groups
2010-06-08T19:10:00.000Z	selenia		including video
2010-06-08T19:10:00.000Z	DSpair	selenia	There is an open issue with this for Lucid.
2010-06-08T19:10:00.000Z	selenia		I can't even login to the new user from gnome
2010-06-08T19:10:00.000Z	selenia		I get the res change
2010-06-08T19:10:00.000Z	selenia		then it crashes back to gdm login
2010-06-08T19:11:00.000Z	selenia		I mean I checked all the groups that seem related to video issues
2010-06-08T19:11:00.000Z	selenia		and they all checked out fine

2010-06-08T19:13:00.000Z	selenia	DSpair	my issue seems a bit different,. It seems it actually crashes and goes back to login screen
2010-06-08T19:13:00.000Z	selenia		gnome-screensaver does not even get a cgance to display the screensaver
2010-06-08T19:14:00.000Z	DSpair	selenia	OK, wish I could have been more helpful
2010-06-08T19:15:00.000Z	selenia	DSpair	it's ok. Just wish I could solve this thing because I can't imagine what's wrong with an unused user that is not wrong with my main user
