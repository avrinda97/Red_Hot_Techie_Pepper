2007-07-02T05:48:00.000Z	Aghaster		I've killed gdm and opened another terminal screen to edit xorg.conf
2007-07-02T05:48:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	check to see if you are using the nvidia driver, not the nv driver
2007-07-02T05:49:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	okay...are you running any desktop effects?
2007-07-02T05:49:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	(i.e. beryl/compiz/compiz-fusion)
2007-07-02T05:50:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	okay, what nvidia card do you have?
2007-07-02T05:50:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	(I'll need the model)
2007-07-02T05:52:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	give me a second to check your model...you may need a different nvidia driver
2007-07-02T05:55:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	I'm not sure...that's why I'm checking...please be patient.
2007-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	I can't seem to find the list I used to have of which cards should get which driver... give me the output of
2007-07-02T05:59:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	okay, give me a minute...I'm going to try to find that list one more time...
2007-07-02T06:02:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	I still can't find that list :( but can I assume you can survive in a terminal (just in case you need to reset to the nv driver if one of the suggestions doesn't work)
2007-07-02T06:04:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	okay, I'm not saying you should switch back, just if it doesn't work.
2007-07-02T06:04:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	and you can't get into the gui
2007-07-02T06:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	yeah, okay. I just wanted to make sure you wouldn't get lost if you had to use a terminal to recover
2007-07-02T06:06:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	I remember there was a kernel module problem when doing this...so give me another minute to check how I circumvented that.
2007-07-02T06:08:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	okay, so you need to install nvidia-glx-new
2007-07-02T06:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	that might fix it. But...if you get an X error about a version mismatch or something to that effect...
2007-07-02T06:10:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Aghaster	you will need to reinstall nvidia-kernel-common and linux-restricted-modules-386 . That should do it...Good Luck
