2007-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	yes i know about that - it doesnt help
2007-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	he simply needs the i386
2007-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	why not?
2007-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	why "simply"?
2007-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	it's complicated but his system needs the i386 to do what he needs to use it for
2007-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	I don't believe you :P
2007-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	if that's really true, then install the 32bit version of ubuntu, or do a chroot
2007-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	ok, thats fine. however, the problem still remains that i need to get him to i386 and burning another iso is not an option
2007-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	he can go i386 by doing a chroot?
2007-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	then order one off of shipit or make a chroot
2007-06-08T15:28:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	know a guide to what we'd be doing here? :)
2007-06-08T15:29:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	thank you ma'am!
2007-06-08T15:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	steady ;)
2007-09-15T06:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	i bet there's something.... somewhere :)
2007-09-15T06:07:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	yeah, apparently i can use bchunk to convert it to iso but i dont want to convert it
2007-09-15T06:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	DarkED	whoops that wasn't to you :P
2007-09-15T06:08:00.000Z	DarkED	PriceChild	oh, sorry :)
