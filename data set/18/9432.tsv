2007-04-12T14:54:00.000Z	niriven		Yeti: Ah, thanks. Thats what i figured. Can i convert my jfs to ext3?
2007-04-12T14:56:00.000Z	niriven		JFS seems ok, i just dont like how slow it is with large amounts of small files
2007-04-12T14:58:00.000Z	niriven		Yeti: Yeah :), thanks
2007-04-12T14:58:00.000Z	niriven		Yeti: I guess ill go format under ext3
2007-04-12T14:59:00.000Z	niriven		Now does xfs acutally lose data, or can you recover it?
2007-04-12T15:01:00.000Z	niriven		I really like ufs on my freebsd machine, too bad linux doesnt have built in support for it
2007-04-12T15:01:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	it does just readonly
2007-04-12T15:01:00.000Z	niriven	kitche	Ah
2007-05-28T08:08:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	with your mouse at least it works for me
2007-05-28T08:08:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	with vlc
2007-05-28T08:09:00.000Z	niriven	kitche	No id on teven see menus, it just plays the full dvd
2007-05-28T08:10:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	des the dvd show the menu on a dvd player?
2007-05-28T08:10:00.000Z	niriven	kitche	Yup, im using totem for playback
2007-05-28T08:10:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	try with vlc
2007-05-28T08:11:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	just to see if it's totem or something else since I don't use totem so I can't debug a problem with it
2007-05-28T08:11:00.000Z	niriven	kitche	k, ill give it a try, brb
2007-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	you are missing the headers/source
2007-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	kitche	niriven	umm it doesn't hold old archives sicne the sources and headers are still installed if you install them
