2007-11-27T08:36:00.000Z	qah661		I have a question about Ubuntu. Can someone help me with it?
2007-11-27T08:37:00.000Z	qah661		I have Windows XP on my notebook right now, and I want to keep it. I was wondering though, can I install Ubuntu on another External hard drive and still run it without Overwriting XP?
2007-11-27T08:38:00.000Z	qah661		Yes my laptop can boot from USB within the BIOS.
2007-11-27T08:38:00.000Z	qah661		Okay, thats cool. This is my first time ever using Linux!
2007-11-27T08:39:00.000Z	qah661		Can you install Microsoft Internet Explorer on Linux by any chance?
2007-11-27T08:40:00.000Z	qah661		Well, I don't like Firefox like I do IE. So this is possible?
2007-11-27T08:42:00.000Z	qah661		Also, what programming languages can you use to delvelop software using Linux?
2007-11-27T08:42:00.000Z	qah661		I mean, for linux
2007-11-27T08:43:00.000Z	qah661		How about C#
2007-11-27T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	yes, you can use C#.  See the "mono" package
2007-11-27T08:41:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	no
2007-11-27T08:41:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	if you really like internet explorer, you'll have to surf from windows
2007-11-27T08:41:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	unless you want to run it under an emulator
2007-11-27T08:42:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	all of them
2007-11-27T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	c++, java, perl, python, ruby, haskell, ocaml, to name a few
2007-11-27T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	lisp, scheme
2007-11-27T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	qah661	it implements C# libraries and infrastructure for linux
