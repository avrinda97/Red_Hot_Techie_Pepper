2012-06-18T14:36:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	That was rather rude. Ubuntu is a newbie-friendly OS, to the extent I wouldn't be surprised if man-pages won't come installed by default with the next release ;) Therefore, don't just send people off when they don't know how to ask or such.
2012-06-18T14:37:00.000Z	vampirnata	theadmin	i am not rude at all... you haven't been in here since this morning
2012-06-18T14:38:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	Err, I didn't quite understand that last sentence. I'm visiting this channel quite often since 2010 if that's what you mean :/
2012-06-18T14:38:00.000Z	vampirnata	theadmin	i meant you were not online this morning when others were trying to help
2012-06-18T14:38:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	Ah... ok.
2012-06-19T11:22:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	Nobody feels like buying an ssh client though
2012-06-19T11:23:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	Ah, guess I didn't read much
2012-06-21T13:52:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	There's MATE-Desktop which is an exact GNOME 2 replica, you may enjoy using it if you're fan of the "classic" Ubuntu look (circa 10.04)
2012-06-21T13:53:00.000Z	vampirnata	theadmin	yah i have mint mate on one of my laptops
2012-06-22T11:53:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	find your_dir -type f -exec chmod -x '{}' \;
2012-06-22T11:54:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	Yes, if you want to do it unrecursively use -maxdepth 0 (I think)
2012-06-22T11:58:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	No problem. Read "man find", it can solve you a lot of headache with complicated file operations.
2012-06-26T17:50:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	That looks good to me.
2012-06-26T17:50:00.000Z	vampirnata	theadmin	Great, thank you :) I was worried I was using an option I was not supposed to be.
2012-06-26T17:51:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	On the other hand, I don't see why you'd "remount-ro" it if it's external, but that's all up to you
2012-06-26T17:52:00.000Z	vampirnata	theadmin	i have some programs writing to the disk periodically and didn't want them to write if there are errors on the disk, i'd rather the scripts fail
2012-06-26T17:53:00.000Z	theadmin	vampirnata	Ah, makes sense then.
