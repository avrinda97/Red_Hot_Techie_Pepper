2011-11-30T11:53:00.000Z	cf_		hello, i need some help getting sound to work; ubuntu 10.10, (i just upgraded from 10.04 where it didn't work either but the hdmi was not detected)
2011-11-30T11:54:00.000Z	x_	cf_	no sound over hdmi is your issue?
2011-11-30T11:54:00.000Z	cf_	x_	yes; i see the devices in aplay -l
2011-11-30T11:55:00.000Z	cf_	x_	but when i try to do the aplay test wav on each of them one by one.... no sound every comes out, and i have also un muted the devices in alsamixer
2011-11-30T11:55:00.000Z	x_	cf_	what is it like an nvidia card w/ hdmi output
2011-11-30T11:56:00.000Z	cf_	x_	yea
2011-11-30T11:59:00.000Z	x_	cf_	so everything is unmuted and you are connecting the card to what device, and what are you using to test sound besides aplay. if you go to your speaker icon in task manager or however else you get to your settings make sure that you view the controls for every thing related to that hdmi (mine is an gf108 nvidia with just a master control.
2011-11-30T11:59:00.000Z	cf_	x_	output of aplay -l and -L; http://pastebin.com/PZMptiUX
2011-11-30T12:00:00.000Z	cf_	x_	i was trying to test with this method: aplay -D plughw:1,3 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav   also 1,7; 1,8; 1,9
2011-11-30T12:02:00.000Z	x_	cf_	in alsamixer do you have spdif options.
2011-11-30T12:02:00.000Z	cf_	x_	all are set to 00, not MM
2011-11-30T12:02:00.000Z	x_	cf_	hrmmm...
2011-11-30T12:03:00.000Z	x_	cf_	your analog out works?
2011-11-30T12:03:00.000Z	cf_	x_	the only output i have is the hdmi.... well i haven't tried testing the analog
2011-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	x_	cf_	and have you muted everything if you have an intel integrated sound chip or something.
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	cf_	x_	i didn't actively mute the intel ones
2011-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	x_	cf_	i'd try it and disable any iec958 checkboxes for it
2011-11-30T12:06:00.000Z	cf_	x_	hmm kk; gonna pass out for now (2AM here) but i'll try it
