2009-08-29T06:01:00.000Z	Lars_G		is there any way I can get 2.6.29 or .30 compiled and packaged for jaunty?
2009-08-29T06:03:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 you could check the following-- under software sources--  Pre-released updates as well as unsupported updates-  then close and let the list reload (it is possible that what you are looking for may be in those)
2009-08-29T06:04:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	Ok, is this the same as backports?
2009-08-29T06:04:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 I think I remember on my other install that it updated to the 2.6.28  when I clicked the pre-released
2009-08-29T06:05:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	2.6.28 is not enough :(
2009-08-29T06:05:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 it may have the 2.6.29 or .30 there but only way it to check
2009-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	I will. thanks
2009-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 only other way is to download the compiler and compile it yourself
2009-08-29T06:07:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 I have yet to compile my own kernel - (only done it for a few apps as well as wine)
2009-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	I've done it lots of times but long ago and I wanted to avoid it right now
2009-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	specially since this is for/in a netbook
2009-08-29T06:10:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 If it exists it is possible it is in the Pre-release updates in the software sources
2009-08-29T06:11:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	sigh it's not, they're all 2.6.28 there
2009-08-29T06:12:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 one thing you may or may not want to do
2009-08-29T06:12:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 go into room #ubuntu+1 and ask them what kernel karmic is
2009-08-29T06:12:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 then you may want to update to the Alpha of Karmic--
2009-08-29T06:14:00.000Z	redvamp128	Lars_G	 though it may be your only option to get that kernel short of compiling
2009-08-29T06:14:00.000Z	Lars_G	redvamp128	yeah, thanks
