2008-05-09T17:51:00.000Z	v0lksman		hey all!  I've seen a lot of people complaining that their Hardy setups "freeze or lockup" every couple minutes for no apparent reason.  Is this actually a known issue or due to many different causes?
2008-05-09T17:51:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	it happens sometimes with me, I thought it might have to do with compiz
2008-05-09T17:52:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	did you happen to use Wubi for an installer?
2008-05-09T17:52:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	no, I swear by normal partitioning
2008-05-09T17:53:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	yeah....I normally would however for this case it was much easier to use wubi...however it is behaving quite poorly compared to any other install of hardy I have...
2008-05-09T17:54:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	I haven't tried wubi. is it really that bad?
2008-05-09T17:54:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	not 100% sure but I think so....I think it could lead a lot of people to think Ubuntu is slower than it really is....
2008-05-09T17:55:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	I'm running a backup right now and will create a partition and restore to that...see if its any better...
2008-05-09T17:56:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	should be, according to wiki
2008-05-09T17:56:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	which wiki?  wubi wiki?  they say "slight" I would say "major"  hahahaha
2008-05-09T17:57:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	wikipedia
2008-05-09T17:57:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	makes sense since it likely uses fuse to book off the ntfs partition...
2008-05-09T17:58:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	it uses ext2 as filesystem, doesn't it?
2008-05-09T18:00:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	once you are in the OS yes...but when it boots it says that the native partition is ntfs...I think that is where you get the performance hit....
2008-05-09T18:00:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	I think... ;)
2008-05-09T18:00:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	lol
2008-05-09T18:01:00.000Z	sofiankr1	v0lksman	so everything goes berzerk if the computer is shut down forcefully?
2008-05-09T18:03:00.000Z	v0lksman	sofiankr1	haven't been in that boat yet...might be worth a try just before I wipe everything out anyways....just don't want to hurt the windows partition cause its a work laptop and my boss will poop an egg if he finds out I put linux on it..hence the Wubi easy un/install...
