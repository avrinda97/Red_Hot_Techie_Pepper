2007-10-22T01:37:00.000Z	Tranto1		Does anyone know how to save my current Ubuntu Feisty installation in a some sort of disk image? I would like to try a Gutsy installation, and if I get errors or I'm not able to configure all the options for my laptop on it, get back to my current OS. Any idea?
2007-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	so long as you save your home directory, the rest isn't very important
2007-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	something like tar jcvpf $HOME /tmp/home-backup.tbz2
2007-10-22T01:40:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	thanks, I can make a copy of /home directory, but I've configured many other things, like kernel boot options (specifical of my laptop), and I would like to preserve all these options if I can't configure all of them in Gutsy. I heard about 'ghost', but not sure if that would be helpful
2007-10-22T01:42:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	oh.   if you boot a SysRescCd or similar live cd distro, you can mount your partitions and backup the information from them.  You can just do a full gzip compressed disk image, a tarball, or whatever.  Tar at least knows how to preserve file permissions if you tell it to
2007-10-22T01:42:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	the functionally easy way to do this is borrow a spare hard disk
2007-10-22T01:45:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	I have a 250 Gb external disk, but I would like to go back to my previous system using some kind of wizard, and seems that partimage can do this...
2007-10-22T01:45:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	oh, "wizard" hmm.  don't know of any
2007-10-22T01:45:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	you know what I mean... Next -> Next -> Finish :)
2007-10-22T01:46:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	I just memorized some commands, I do this all the time.  Too lazy for GUI
2007-10-22T01:48:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	I'm too lazy for commands :) well, really what I want is a process that configure Grub in a correct way, and restore the system. I'm not sure I'm able to do this only making a copy of the files in my linux partition
2007-10-22T01:49:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	there's nothing too special about a linux setup. Files with permissions on ext3 filesystem, sockets, device nodes. Then you want to have some way to chroot into that after restoring the data and run grub to install it to the MBR
2007-10-22T01:50:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	really though, borrow somebody's hard disk and install to that, if you are doing this for work
2007-10-22T01:50:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	I don't have the expertise in this kind of things... MBR and so on
2007-10-22T01:51:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	if you can figure out how to boot a SysRescCD and talk to me via IRC using irssi client on it, then I won't mind to walk you through the process in privmsg
2007-10-22T01:53:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	thanks, I can't do this right now, but I have copy/pasted your previous message :)
2007-10-22T01:55:00.000Z	Tranto1	jnc	and this is not for work... in fact, my job encourages me to use Windows, but I really want to use Ubuntu with VirtualBox (as I need to use Visual Studio)
2007-10-22T01:55:00.000Z	jnc	Tranto1	ah.  Well good luck
