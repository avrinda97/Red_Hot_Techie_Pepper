2006-10-11T08:29:00.000Z	tamacracker		Can someone please help me remount my secondary hard drive?
2006-10-11T08:30:00.000Z	tamacracker		What's more stable than Ubuntu?
2006-10-11T08:31:00.000Z	tamacracker		I'm findin that Ubuntu's becoming unstable... atleast with keepin the secondary hard drive mounted.
2006-10-11T08:31:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	is it in your fstab?
2006-10-11T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	don't paste here.  that's what the pastebin is for
2006-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	it's most likely a fault in ntfs-3g then.  Which is still experimental
2006-10-11T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	there is no stable NTFS writing available at the moment.
2006-10-11T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	most likely, yes.  You could try updating your ntfs-3g (and submit a bug report to them too, they can't fix bugs they don't know about)
2006-10-11T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	However you installed it, you'd download a new versoin, and install that.
2006-10-11T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	ntfs-3g isn't provided by ubuntu, I have no idea.
2006-11-11T13:35:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	you need a hotmail scraper sort of thing.  There's one in the repository, I believe.
2006-11-11T13:36:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	Ah, the one I was thinking about is for yahoo:  http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/mail/fetchyahoo  I imagine it's possible with hotmail too
2006-11-11T13:38:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	heh, google?  Here's one:  It's just a perl script, so even though the deb is for debian, it should work... or, well, in theory ;)  http://dir.filewatcher.com/d/Debian/all/mail/gotmail_0.6.6-6_all.deb.17386.html
2006-11-13T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	You need to have grub installed on whichever your BIOS boots to though, unless you want to tweak your BIOS each time you want to switch
2006-11-13T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	grub overwrites the windows MBR, which then allows you to boot into whichever you'd like
2006-11-13T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	ah, sorry.  you don't need my banter ;)
2006-12-20T17:36:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	adept and synaptic feed from the same package repositories, so yes ;)
2007-01-30T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	tamacracker	correct, everything on linux is just a file (well, and directories)
