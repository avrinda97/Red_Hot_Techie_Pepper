2008-08-06T10:33:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Not Firefox bookmarks.  Filesystem location bookmarks.
2008-08-06T10:35:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	??
2008-08-06T10:36:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	didn't understand fs-bookmarks
2008-08-06T11:06:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	When you click the "Places" menu on the top panel it will list filesystem locations like "Pictures", "Documents", etc.
2008-08-12T06:33:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Uhm... why are you trying to show me how to compile?  Do you even read questions or just every other word? lol
2008-08-12T06:35:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	read install tar.gz; left-click mouse, extract
2008-08-12T06:35:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Extract to where?
2008-08-12T06:35:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	read install tar.gz; right-click mouse, extract
2008-08-12T06:36:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	to where u want to save ur themes
2008-08-12T06:36:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Uhm... I don't KNOW where I need to save them.  I want to have this icon pack available in the "Customize" dialog for the Appearance app.
2008-08-12T06:37:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	And if I extract it to ~/.icons/, it will replace my existing icons.
2008-08-12T06:39:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Right... the archive has an "Icons" folder.  I also have a ~/.icons/Icons/ containing all the same filenames.
2008-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	see, then unpack them to desktop first and manually rename them
2008-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Dude... there's like a hundred of them.
2008-08-12T06:41:00.000Z	Reformer81	alraune	Well, I still extracted them to ~/.icons/Icons/... they're all there, but I don't know how to set them as my system icons.
2008-08-12T06:43:00.000Z	alraune	Reformer81	?? too late anyway ? else see jrib above your last post
