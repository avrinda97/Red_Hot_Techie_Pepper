2007-11-30T03:49:00.000Z	perrako		Ugh -- I just got a new 1920x1200 monitor and ubuntu's not behaving well with the resolution
2007-11-30T03:50:00.000Z	wabiD	perrako	it should just be one line you need to add to xorg.conf
2007-11-30T03:51:00.000Z	perrako	wabiD	-- as far as I can tell, it's got that line already.
2007-11-30T03:51:00.000Z	wabiD		if its the only resolution you want, remove all the other lines
2007-11-30T03:51:00.000Z	wabiD		in section screen and subsection display have only this
2007-11-30T03:51:00.000Z	wabiD		  Modes  "1920x1200"
2007-11-30T03:51:00.000Z	perrako		well, i'm seeing about 3 different screens come up
2007-11-30T03:52:00.000Z	wabiD		then it has no choice
2007-11-30T03:52:00.000Z	wabiD		identifier=default screen?
2007-11-30T03:52:00.000Z	perrako	wabiD	I'll try that, sec
2007-11-30T03:53:00.000Z	wabiD		i had problems in the past, but now i just give it no other option except 1920x1200 and it doesnt ever complain
2007-11-30T03:54:00.000Z	perrako	wabiD	I tried that, but I still am in 1024 x 768. I've got a "Section 'Monitor'" with a bunch of modelines
2007-11-30T03:54:00.000Z	perrako		with resolutions and a lot of other info
2007-11-30T03:54:00.000Z	perrako		k
2007-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	wabiD	perrako	try commenting out all the modelines
2007-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	wabiD		x shoud detect that stuff automatically now, its not really needed
2007-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	wabiD		just mode "resolution" should work
2007-11-30T04:03:00.000Z	perrako	wabiD	I'm even more lost now. I tried using the KDE command center to set up the monitor
