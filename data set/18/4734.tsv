2009-02-20T18:56:00.000Z	pjsturgeon		I am just trying to add a new drive. I first need to run a command to list all my partitions and drives so i can see what the name is to mount it
2009-02-20T18:57:00.000Z	pjsturgeon		bloody hell sudo! im used to having root permissions
2009-02-20T18:57:00.000Z	pjsturgeon		thank you (and sorry for swearing in here :p)
2009-02-20T18:58:00.000Z	pjsturgeon		sudo !! is my best friend recently ;)
2009-02-20T18:58:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	sudo -i    might make you happy. sometimes there's no getting around several root commands in a row
2009-02-20T18:52:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	"umount" not "unmount"
2009-02-20T18:53:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	then you run fdisk on the device,not the mount point.
2009-02-20T18:53:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	RussM	earlier I just ran fdisk -l and it showed all drives and all partitions
2009-02-20T18:54:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	RussM	this is also not mounted. I need to find the partition number to mount it
2009-02-20T18:55:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	Sorry, I missed the very beginning, I was sleeping. Can you repeat what you're trying to accomplish?
2009-02-20T19:03:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	I think mount shows the valid fs type name strings.
2009-02-20T19:03:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	sorry, the mount man page.
2009-02-20T19:04:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	RussM	didnt spot it if it was there. Mounted now, just fiddling with fstab :)
2009-02-20T19:27:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	you may want to  set uid and gid options on the  mount point
2009-02-20T19:29:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	Hmmm. My  mac died.
2009-02-20T19:31:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	I just  wish  Apple would let me copy the OSX over into a virtual machine on my 'buntu server. :)
2009-02-20T19:32:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	RussM	im thinking of going the other way. Putting ubuntu on my macbook >.<
2009-02-20T19:39:00.000Z	RussM	pjsturgeon	Glad to hear its working. Gotta run.
