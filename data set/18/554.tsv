2011-12-28T11:39:00.000Z	sue_		hi. I upgraded to 10.04 LTS, from 9.10. I can't get the gnome-screensaver to activate anymore.. I even set it to 1 minute and waited and it doesn't work. I checked and the gnome-screensaver process is running. any ideas?
2011-12-28T11:41:00.000Z	metaspike	sue_	does xscreensaver-demo   in console do anything?
2011-12-28T11:41:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	1 minute, it wasn't installed
2011-12-28T11:43:00.000Z	metaspike	sue_	sudo apt-get install xscreensaver-gl && sudo apt-get install xscreensaver-gl-extra
2011-12-28T11:53:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	I ran xscreensaver and that crashed my computer
2011-12-28T11:54:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	it went to  console screen for a moment and then it started blinking corrupted textual/colors over and over.. fortunately ctrl-alt-del rebooted
2011-12-28T11:55:00.000Z	metaspike	sue_	if it makes you feel better.
2011-12-28T11:55:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	I'm asking, I don't know..
2011-12-28T11:56:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	why would xscreensaver crash my computer.. seems weird
2011-12-28T11:59:00.000Z	metaspike	sue_	nvidia, ati?
2011-12-28T12:02:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	looks like it is using the intel(0) driver
2011-12-28T12:03:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	intel: Driver for Intel Integrated Graphics Chipsets: ... 845G ... so that is the right one
2011-12-28T12:04:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	was a good idea to check though!
2011-12-28T12:07:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	I'm still not sure what that had to do with lts.. I guess it was an abbreviation?
2011-12-28T12:07:00.000Z	metaspike	sue_	even better, but gnome might pack a hissy. should be interesting.
2011-12-28T12:07:00.000Z	metaspike	sue_	lol no, i gave you a console command
2011-12-28T12:09:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	maybe you didn't realize you typed it, never mind :)
2011-12-28T12:10:00.000Z	sue_	metaspike	yeah I was running 9.04 and upgraded to 10.04 and that's when I started having trouble
