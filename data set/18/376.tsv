2012-03-15T00:03:00.000Z	frisx		How do I unlock the www folder so I can move a folder into it?
2012-03-15T00:03:00.000Z	Seidr	frisx	I'm guessing you'd have to check the ownership of the www folder
2012-03-15T00:03:00.000Z	frisx		I have tried chmod 777 www but that does not work
2012-03-15T00:04:00.000Z	Seidr		hm :\
2012-03-15T00:04:00.000Z	frisx	Seidr	how do I check ownership
2012-03-15T00:04:00.000Z	Seidr		ls -alh will display group/user ownership
2012-03-15T00:05:00.000Z	Seidr		you can change ownership with chown <user>:<group> www
2012-03-15T00:07:00.000Z	frisx	Seidr	current owner is root root
2012-03-15T00:07:00.000Z	Seidr		and I guess you're currently root?
2012-03-15T00:09:00.000Z	frisx	Seidr	I am not sure how to check that. chown--- Operation not permitted
2012-03-15T00:09:00.000Z	Seidr		type whoami - it will tell you the user you're currently logged in as
2012-03-15T00:09:00.000Z	Seidr		sounds like you don't have permission to modify the folder..although if you couldn't chown you shouldn't of been able to chmod..I think
2012-03-15T00:09:00.000Z	frisx	Seidr	I am not root at the moment.
2012-03-15T00:10:00.000Z	Seidr	frisx	ok, to change the owner you'd have to be root..but I agree, 777 should of done the trick
2012-03-15T00:11:00.000Z	frisx	Seidr	I do not know how to change myself to root.
2012-03-15T00:11:00.000Z	Seidr		if you're logged in as a user that can su, you can type 'sudo su', and provide your current accounts password
2012-03-15T00:12:00.000Z	Seidr		that can sudo even
2012-03-15T00:14:00.000Z	frisx	Seidr	sudo did the trick. Me so happy, thanks!
