2010-04-08T02:21:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	you dont need ssh just to share files
2010-04-08T02:23:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	please elaborate.  Hwo do I connect two computers without SSH?
2010-04-08T02:23:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	are they on a network?
2010-04-08T02:24:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	no.  They both get wired internet from the same router, but they are not networked to share files.  I want to connect via the internet to the other machine. SSH is what I need help with.
2010-04-08T02:25:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	ok, my mistake, thought you wanted to share between them
2010-04-08T02:25:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	I do want to share between them.
2010-04-08T02:26:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	have you tried - in terminal "shares-admin"?
2010-04-08T02:27:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	no, what is it?
2010-04-08T02:27:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	controls shares on computer
2010-04-08T02:28:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	its installed by default i believe, for ubuntu anyway
2010-04-08T02:29:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	thats not what I asked.  I asked if both PCs need the EXTRA packages that shares-admin installs.
2010-04-08T02:29:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	both linux machines?
2010-04-08T02:30:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	yes.
2010-04-08T02:30:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	and the only thing it installs is whats required to share on windows network
2010-04-08T02:31:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	why would I want to share with windows?  Who mentioned windows?
2010-04-08T02:36:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	did you just walk me through a bunch of nonsense about Windows sharing for nothing, or does that stuff work for linux sharing?
2010-04-08T02:36:00.000Z	mkquist	wizard_	just try it
2010-04-08T02:38:00.000Z	wizard_	mkquist	Just try it?  Is that seriously how you give help out to people?  you give them shotty responses to complex questions when you have no idea what you're talking about, and then jus tell them to "try it"?
