2006-01-13T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	sorry, connection problems.
2006-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	I forgot to quote the 's
2006-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	that needs to be for i in Surround Center LFE; do amixer sset \'$i\' on; done
2006-01-13T13:15:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	ok, whatever works for you.
2006-01-13T13:15:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	I'd appreciate the output from amixer regardless
2006-01-13T13:16:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	no, not the old amixer values. The new ones after you selected OSS mixer.
2006-01-13T13:17:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	no, leave the controls as is. Just open a terminal and type amixer
2006-01-13T13:24:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	just use another pastebin, like pastebin.ca
2006-01-13T13:30:00.000Z	Dave|id	crimsun_	http://pastebin.ca/36160
2006-01-13T13:30:00.000Z	Dave|id	crimsun_	they are amixer results from both OSS and HDA Intel
2006-01-13T13:31:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	right, they shouldn't differ, and they don't. The results are as I expected. Thanks.
2006-01-13T13:32:00.000Z	Dave|id	crimsun_	do you have those instructions on the web anywhere, so when i rebuild this machine i can get my sound working again?
2006-01-13T13:32:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	I can put them in a factoid
2006-01-13T13:35:00.000Z	Dave|id	crimsun_	if you could that would be fantastic. If you need any specs or anything from my machine just ask. I am more than wlling to help you out with your bugzilla problem
2006-01-13T13:37:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	#15031 has already been resolved.
2006-01-13T13:38:00.000Z	crimsun_	Dave|id	I've placed instructions in the "alsa-source" factoid. /msg ubotu alsa-source
2006-01-13T13:40:00.000Z	Dave|id	crimsun_	Thank you so much for your time and help! if you ever in brisbane i'll buy you a beer
