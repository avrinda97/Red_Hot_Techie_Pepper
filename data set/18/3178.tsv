2009-11-23T04:53:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	maybe try a netstat?
2009-11-23T04:53:00.000Z	billiard_junkee		or nslookup
2009-11-23T04:53:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	what is netstat
2009-11-23T04:54:00.000Z	billiard_junkee		!netstat
2009-11-23T04:54:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	it's a utility that will show you what connections are listenening connected and the ports that they are connected through, among many other things
2009-11-23T04:55:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	'man netstat'  I would say tat 'netsat -ar' should show what you want to see
2009-11-23T04:57:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	I issued netstat -nr and I got results, one of them for my destination [work domain] but how can that help me to resolve the problem. I do not know!
2009-11-23T04:57:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	forgive me, but in the mix of everything, I forget what  you were trying to do.  I just remember that you could not ping....that is why I mentioned netstat
2009-11-23T04:59:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	I established a VPN connection to my work network, and I am connected. However I can not access any resource or even ping the work domain!
2009-11-23T05:00:00.000Z	billiard_junkee		gosh, ibrahimmufeed...I have no experience with that.  Sorry...
2009-11-23T05:00:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	no problem thank you :)
2009-11-23T05:02:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	this looks like it could be promising...wish I could actually help.  ;)  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=887062
2009-11-23T05:02:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	I will check it
2009-11-23T05:05:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	she said :{finally found the solution! you just have to configure your routing tables after logging into your vpn server.} . then how can I do that? do you have any idea?
2009-11-23T05:06:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	the best that I have for you is 'man route'   I use 'route add default gw 192.168.0.1'  to add my wireless.
2009-11-23T05:07:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	that is just an example.  And the only working one that I can give you...  :-/
2009-11-23T05:08:00.000Z	ibrahimmufeed	billiard_junkee	I will work on that, thank you
2009-11-23T05:09:00.000Z	billiard_junkee	ibrahimmufeed	no prob... at least you have a little different angle on it, and know what it is you are looking to find information on!
