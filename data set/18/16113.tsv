2005-05-18T12:51:00.000Z	Zotnix		Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2005-05-18T12:51:00.000Z	Zotnix		Getting that though
2005-05-18T12:51:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	how about pasting your config to pastbin or something ?
2005-05-18T12:51:00.000Z	Zotnix	ohgood	k
2005-05-18T12:55:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	checking mine...
2005-05-18T12:55:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	glx is fine
2005-05-18T12:57:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	it looks fine. what errors do you have ?
2005-05-18T12:58:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	glxgears works though ?

2005-05-18T12:58:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	permissions on /dev/nvidia maybe, or have you: modprobe nvidia            yet ?
2005-05-18T12:59:00.000Z	Zotnix	ohgood	It's loaded. lsmod shows it. I didn't check permissions though
2005-05-18T13:00:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	iirc i chmod'd mine to 666 or something for all /dev/nvidia* then it worked fine
2005-05-18T13:00:00.000Z	ohgood	Zotnix	or it's a pam thing. can't remember exactly
