2008-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	OddlotX4		Hey guys, me again.  I've been having problems with .avi files in Intrepid.  Is there possibly a diffrent .avi decoder I could use to probably solve this problem?  Or am I missing something?
2008-11-06T06:16:00.000Z	OddlotX4		Thanks guys.
2008-11-06T06:17:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	or try mplayer, it plays almost anything you throw at it.
2008-11-06T06:21:00.000Z	OddlotX4		Alright, the MPlayer didn't solve the problem.
2008-11-06T06:21:00.000Z	OddlotX4		The main problem is that the video flickers.
2008-11-06T06:22:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	what gpu you have?
2008-11-06T06:23:00.000Z	OddlotX4	Skry^	Radeon 2600XT, PCI-e.
2008-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	does mplayer -vo x11 file.avi work?
2008-11-06T06:28:00.000Z	OddlotX4	Skry^	Thanks, that worked :D
2008-11-06T06:29:00.000Z	OddlotX4	Skry^	I don't appear to be able to turn off the subtitles, nor enter into full screen though.
2008-11-06T06:29:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	that's kinda bad solution, try disabling compiz or if you're using it and try if it works without -vo x11
2008-11-06T06:32:00.000Z	OddlotX4	Skry^	It seems that the X11 will work in other players.  Thanks for the help!
2008-11-06T06:33:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	yeah, but it doesnt change the fact that your video drivers are broken. thats a known bug in ati drivers and there's fix coming.
2008-11-06T06:33:00.000Z	OddlotX4		Alright, one last simple question.  How do I change the default video player to vlc?
2008-11-06T06:34:00.000Z	OddlotX4	Skry^	I noticed ATi doesn't exactly have good drivers for much anything in the firstplace.
2008-11-06T06:35:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	true :) luckily i'm using nvidia ^^
2008-11-06T06:36:00.000Z	OddlotX4		Thanks for solving my problems guys.  Much appreciated.
2008-11-06T06:37:00.000Z	Skry^	OddlotX4	 but hey, if you see updates to ati when upgrading, try changing x11 back to xv as it is accelerated and x11 is not.
