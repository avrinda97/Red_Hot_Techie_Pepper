2009-03-26T04:19:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	is the ssh server running? Is it listening at port 22 ?
2009-03-26T04:19:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	well i set it to 512 but im setting it back to 22
2009-03-26T04:20:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	Your client will by default try port 22
2009-03-26T04:20:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	okay so how can i find out if its listening?
2009-03-26T04:21:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	After start (/etc/init.d/sshd start) check "sudo netstat -anp |grep 22"
2009-03-26T04:21:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	To make sure it works, try ssh locally (On your server, do 'ssh localhost' for example)
2009-03-26T04:23:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	 it worked i logged int from localhost
2009-03-26T04:24:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	after changing port to 22 ? And re-tried from the other server?
2009-03-26T04:24:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	 i didnt retry from the other sever yet
2009-03-26T04:25:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	i did from putty from my windows computer but it wont work
2009-03-26T04:26:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	is it possible to ping the laptop from the other box?
2009-03-26T04:26:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	 let me try that
2009-03-26T04:27:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	 all 4 icmp packets were sent and replied
2009-03-26T04:28:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	ok. Using ssh (putty) do you get a login prompt?
2009-03-26T04:28:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	no i type in my ip and press ok and it comes up with a box witha green square and i get error connection refuesed
2009-03-26T04:29:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	well, then it seems it might have something todo with the router (in between) and/or firewall (on the laptop)
2009-03-26T04:30:00.000Z	Guest8485	oCean_	how can i fix that? im using a linksys wrt150n
2009-03-26T04:32:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest8485	I really have no clue as to the capabilities of that router. But if you get a denied error, even before it connects, the cause has to be somewhere 'before' the sshd. So you did change back to port 22 and restarted sshd-server, right?
