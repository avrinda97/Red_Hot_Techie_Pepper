2009-11-17T06:54:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	What type of mouse?
2009-11-17T06:54:00.000Z	luist_	Taim	neither notebook one or usb are working
2009-11-17T06:55:00.000Z	luist_	Taim	hm... ill update system to see if it solves my problem... :(
2009-11-17T06:55:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	Good first start.  What make model on the laptop and the mouse?
2009-11-17T06:56:00.000Z	luist_	Taim	well my laptop is a sony vaio fw139e.. i dunno if theres an specific model for the touchpad mouse :P
2009-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	Let me do a bit of digging.  It does help to google around for "fw139e" and "Ubuntu"
2009-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	luist_	Taim	its not that eazy to google around without using the mouse :P
2009-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	True, but it CAN be done :)
2009-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	luist_	Taim	but its not a problem related to the mouse model... it just worked fine before i reinstall
2009-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	Something must have changed then.
2009-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	Outside of the install.  Unless there was something you did custom after the install?
2009-11-17T06:59:00.000Z	luist_	Taim	well ill just wait for the update to finish... 250mb of packages must do something about it :P
2009-11-17T06:59:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	Let me know how it goes.  I am still digging.
2009-11-17T07:00:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	expand apps
2009-11-17T07:00:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	ignore that last.
2009-11-17T07:14:00.000Z	Taim	luist_	No luck finding anything yet on the mouse...
