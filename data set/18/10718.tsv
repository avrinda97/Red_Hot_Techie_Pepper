2006-10-31T10:53:00.000Z	nothlit		that should d/l it
2006-10-31T10:55:00.000Z	xipietotec	nothlit	he allready has it installed
2006-12-03T16:48:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	I like that choice
2006-12-03T16:49:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	people wouldn't have their fancy beryl to show off without that choice, and you wouldn't be able to run linux on legacy hardware without lightweight wms
2006-12-03T16:50:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	why wouldn't you do it the other way around?
2006-12-03T16:50:00.000Z	xipietotec	nothlit	I'm not knocking the variety =) I'm explaining that the variety is what makes linux different than OSX.
2006-12-03T16:50:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	less options in both applications/configuration confuses non techies
2006-12-03T16:51:00.000Z	xipietotec	nothlit	KDE's interface bugs me, looks too much like windows, and while it has several applications I like, it also has application overload, it's also overly complex to configure (.e.g., window customization etc.), but the application suites and the fact it looks like windows makes it easier for business integration
2006-12-03T16:52:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	you can modify gnome-panel, and theres gcontol and gnome-control-(center)
2006-12-03T16:53:00.000Z	xipietotec	nothlit	I'm well aware (I have a severely modified gnome).
2006-12-03T16:53:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	also, sabayon and pessulus make it easier for business now
2006-12-03T16:59:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	whats wrong with kdebase + install one by one then?
2006-12-03T17:01:00.000Z	xipietotec	nothlit	I'm talking about just creating a light weight version of KDE with certain aspects of gnome (like easy drag and drop installation of themes, wallpapers, etc, most common customization options being default, with all the advanced ones that KDE has being thrown under advanced tabs).
2006-12-03T17:08:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	what you want sounds like it would take an incredible amount of hacking or starting from scratch
2006-12-03T17:08:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	correct me if i'm wrong of course
2006-12-03T17:12:00.000Z	xipietotec	nothlit	BSD = Do whatever you want. GPL = "Your free do what you want, so long as you make sure others are too."
2006-12-03T17:13:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	i was just referring to the original bsd license which has a phrase you had to put in every advertisement, that people modified several times
2006-12-13T10:44:00.000Z	nothlit	xipietotec	/mnt? :P
