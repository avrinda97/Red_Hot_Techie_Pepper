2005-08-10T08:59:00.000Z	rapha		Is it possible to remotely lock the display over an SSH session?
2005-08-10T08:59:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	Good question :D
2005-08-10T08:59:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	You can start the VNC server, then lock it the way you always would... but I wonder if there's a command.
2005-08-10T09:01:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	well, the person using the PC would be able to prevent that, right? :-)
2005-08-10T09:02:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	Yes.
2005-08-10T09:05:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	I've found something... xlockmore or xlockmore-gl
2005-08-10T09:08:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	Not installed on a default Install, right?
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	nope
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	Can you tell the prog what screen to lock?
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	doesn't matter though, I'm on the machine by SSH
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	let me see...
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	Because if you lock the current screen with SSH, it won't lock the one somebody else is using...
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	Well, you just need to export DISPLAY accordingly
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	Alright then... should work. :)
2005-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	Does work. I just tried it.
2005-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	rapha	Tomcat_	My girl friend asked me to lock her screen after some time, so her little brother doesn't spend all day playing some game
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	rapha		Is there another BitTorrent tracker for the Breezy Colony 2 CD, or just the one from cdimage.ubuntulinux.org? Because there's no seeders left for that one :-/
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rapha	:D
