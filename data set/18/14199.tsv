2005-09-01T13:34:00.000Z	GlenC		can anyone suggest a way to make this old box serve files faster?
2005-09-01T13:35:00.000Z	GlenC		I might as well just buy a new computer then
2005-09-01T13:35:00.000Z	GlenC		will that help serve files faster?
2005-09-01T13:36:00.000Z	GlenC		because I'm trying to stream a movie and it's pretty choppy
2005-09-01T13:36:00.000Z	GlenC		it's over my lan, too
2005-09-01T13:37:00.000Z	GlenC		!ping
2005-09-01T13:39:00.000Z	GlenC		so no one can think of a way to get better speeds from this box?
2005-09-01T13:41:00.000Z	auTONYmous	GlenC	kill any unnecessary process (free up CPU cycles), get a 10/100 "switch" (not a "hub"... big difference), try using a different file access method (do you HAVE to use SMB?)
2005-09-01T13:41:00.000Z	GlenC		thanks auTONYmous, but how can I not use smb?
2005-09-01T13:42:00.000Z	GlenC		and how do I kill/find processes?
2005-09-01T13:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous		all the other boxes Windblows, huh?
2005-09-01T13:42:00.000Z	GlenC		yup
2005-09-01T13:42:00.000Z	GlenC		and linux isn't an option
2005-09-01T13:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous		you're stuck with it, so look at the server's processes first, then be sure the network is optimized (the "switch" I referred to a minute ago will help GREATLY)
2005-09-01T13:44:00.000Z	GlenC		what is the switch?
2005-09-01T13:44:00.000Z	auTONYmous		glenc: it's the central network device that ALL your other PC's are plugged into to create the "network"
2005-09-01T13:45:00.000Z	auTONYmous		glenc: if you have a "hub" now, all your pc's are sharing the total network speed...
2005-09-01T13:45:00.000Z	GlenC	auTONYmous	pm?
