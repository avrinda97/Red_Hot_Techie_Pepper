2005-03-22T16:51:00.000Z	RarLukT		Quick question; Is there a standard root-password?
2005-03-22T16:52:00.000Z	RarLukT		sudo?
2005-03-22T16:53:00.000Z	RarLukT		Zeedo: What do you mean by sudo?
2005-03-22T10:01:00.000Z	RarLukT		Ok... I need help. I've installled Ubuntu, and choosed not to have any username. Now I cannot log in
2005-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	RarLukT		Then what is sudo?
2005-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	RarLukT		It sounds like some kind of weird japaneese sexual tecnique....
2005-03-22T10:04:00.000Z	RarLukT		I get this loginscreen, but i cannot log in... Is there a way I can add users after i
2005-03-22T10:04:00.000Z	RarLukT		After I have installed it...
2005-03-22T10:05:00.000Z	RarLukT		Where?
2005-03-22T10:05:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	you didn't create a normal user?
2005-03-22T10:06:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	no
2005-03-22T10:09:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	I hope you didn't think to use Root for X?
2005-03-22T10:10:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	never use root for X
2005-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	root is a "use this only if necessary" thingy...
2005-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	also...the applications often asks for the root password if they need it...and then you just type the user password in there instead
2005-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	RarLukT	scizzo	I tried that. Like a billion times. Didn't work... (The caps-lock was not on... I swear to god)
2005-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	well did you add a new user? and used that user?
2005-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	scizzo	RarLukT	the thing is that the user that you create during install....that one is added automatically to sudoers....but if you create a new later...that one is not added auto to the file...you need to add it yourself
