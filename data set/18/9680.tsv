2007-03-16T10:31:00.000Z	dougie		i have a printer i'm trying to setup. It's a canon IP4000r it has built in wireless and is connected through my AP how would i add it in ubuntu?
2007-03-16T10:32:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	I have a PIXMA printer, too. I bought the driver from Turboprint to make it work.
2007-03-16T10:32:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	feisty (pre-release ubuntu) comes with a driver for it.
2007-03-16T10:33:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	(which, incidentally, works better than the closed source one)
2007-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	deal with the driver problem first. You can then set it up as an LPD printer.
2007-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	dougie	soundray	couldn't i install the driver without fiesty?
2007-03-16T10:35:00.000Z	dougie	soundray	is fiesty pre release real buggy?
2007-03-16T10:35:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	no
2007-03-16T10:35:00.000Z	dougie	soundray	i'm guessing thats to the buggy question :) can i upgrade my current install to fiesty?
2007-03-16T10:35:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	be prepared to help debugging it, but it's reasonable stable.
2007-03-16T10:36:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	with a fresh install, you'll have fewer problems. But, yes, you can upgrade.
2007-03-16T10:36:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	join #ubuntu+1, look at the topic and follow the conversation for a bit to see what's going on.
2007-03-16T10:37:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	back it up so you can revert if necessary.
2007-03-16T10:37:00.000Z	dougie	soundray	they don't seem to be to sure that its very usable at all
2007-03-16T10:38:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	yes, but my experience is that it mostly just works.
2007-03-16T10:38:00.000Z	soundray	dougie	backup, then all you're risking is your time.
2007-03-16T10:39:00.000Z	dougie	soundray	is there not a pixma driver i could install?
2007-03-16T10:42:00.000Z	dougie	soundray	well i got the printer to work through usb.... with the High Quality Image (Gutenprint) (en) driver
