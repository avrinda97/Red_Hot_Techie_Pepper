2007-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	Meyvn		 i have a dual-boot system, and after a crash last night, GRUB is no longer responding to the arrow down key (arrow up strangely works), i looked at /boot/menu.lst but couldn't find anything out of the ordinary
2007-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	Meyvn		 here's the menu.lst pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30688/
2007-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	perhaps your key is not working at all, tested it to be sure it works?
2007-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	heh, it doesn't seem to work in emacs either
2007-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	unplug the keyboard maybe?
2007-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	or use a hammer? :)
2007-07-21T07:41:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	might be able to use the number pad direction keys, be sure the numlock is OFF an they should act as the direction keys
2007-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	ill shut down an replug keyboard, first if it works I'll let you know :)
2007-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	it's working again, solution: 1) hold keyboard upside down 2) shake it :D
2007-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	lol, good job!
2007-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	a Hammer would have been more fun imo :)
2007-07-21T07:54:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	often the problem is simpler then I think :P i was thinking something was wrong with GRUB, when it in fact was fine. thanks a lot )
2007-07-21T07:54:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	anytime :)
2007-07-21T07:54:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	and yes a hammer would have been more fun ^^
2007-07-21T07:54:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	it's not too late!!! :)
2007-07-21T07:56:00.000Z	royel	Meyvn	I been using the same keyboard for close to 10 years, I have bought dozens of replacements an never liked the feel of any new ones, I will die when this one gives out.
2007-07-21T07:56:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	lol
2007-07-21T07:56:00.000Z	Meyvn	royel	yeah, i <3 my keyboard
