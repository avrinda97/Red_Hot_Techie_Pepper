2010-02-26T05:38:00.000Z	teage		I extracted a virus from virtual box running windows. Im running Ubuntu 9.10 and i want to know if its possible to open a .exe file to view whats inside.
2010-02-26T05:38:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	with a hex editor yes
2010-02-26T05:40:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	you said look inside how do you mean how it works?
2010-02-26T05:41:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	then a hex editor is what you need but you need knowledge of assembley language
2010-02-26T05:42:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	google serves me well and what i cant find or learn, someone from the channel might now. I will find what i need to know.
2010-02-26T05:43:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	have you ever programmed?
2010-02-26T05:44:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	i have read a bit though about programming
2010-02-26T05:46:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	well thats what i mean, windows uses c++ do they not, specially for exes
2010-02-26T05:46:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	yeah but you cant reverse it to the language you have to reverse it to machine code
2010-02-26T05:49:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	no harm in trying it might be over your head but you get familar with it so if you want to learn its not totally foreign
2010-02-26T05:51:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	either way its not going to infect your linux box unless its a root kit which is unlikely
2010-02-26T05:53:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	.adata .aspack .data .rdata .rsrc .text
2010-02-26T05:55:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	I tried. Itried gedit and geany
2010-02-26T05:55:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	open in gedit
2010-02-26T05:56:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	cant. says  could not open the file, select a charater coding from the menu and try again
2010-02-26T06:06:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	windows has its uses cant beat it for gaming
2010-02-26T06:06:00.000Z	teage	Gstar	i do agree with the gaming.
2010-02-26T06:15:00.000Z	Gstar	teage	the language dont make much difference when reversing its all hex
