2010-10-05T18:15:00.000Z	chek0v		gentlemen, is there any real reason the website is saying 64bit is NOT recommended for daily desktop use? i dont recall seeing that on any prior ubuntu releases
2010-10-05T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chek0v	 its idiot proofing .. and asked in here all the time.
2010-10-05T18:16:00.000Z	chek0v	Dr_Willis	im running 64bit now, so i assume its bogus
2010-10-05T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chek0v	 if a user dosent know if their cpu is 64 or 32bit.. then its best for them to get 32bit..
2010-10-05T18:16:00.000Z	chek0v		just wondered
2010-10-05T18:16:00.000Z	chek0v		fair enough
