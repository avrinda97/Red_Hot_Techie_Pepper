2009-05-15T20:54:00.000Z	tokyoahead		guys my linux install on a new laptop freezes w/o starting xorg... how can I switch off the progress screen so I can see how far it boots up and what is actually causing it to crash?
2009-05-15T20:55:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	Try hitting F2 during boot, and it should display the normal console output during startup.
2009-05-15T20:57:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	vasi: mbeier: I tried to remove "quiet" from the boot line and hiut F2 and F6 but nothing changed. I see the ubuntu logo with the progress indicator moving from left to right and back and the na black screen comes and its stuck there
2009-05-15T21:00:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	Sounds to me like the build is boned. Did you just install or upgrade?
2009-05-15T21:00:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	I installed on a virgin drive with a newly downloeded CD
2009-05-15T21:00:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	(vista is already installed however
2009-05-15T21:01:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	talking to me about 8.1? did not try it yet. the machine is brand-new
2009-05-15T21:02:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	you recommend me to try and download it?
2009-05-15T21:02:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	I'm not an expert, but I would say if 8.10 works and 9.04 doesn't, maybe there's a different build/driver that changed between the old and new versions that is causing you problems.
2009-05-15T21:02:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	hmm ok... let me try 8.1... thanks
2009-05-15T21:03:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	Might be able to narrow it down to a build/driver problem, and in which case you could find out what your video card/chip is and people might be able to help you solve that compile/config problem.
2009-05-15T21:04:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	ok good to know
2009-05-15T21:04:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	Hope that helped. :)
2009-05-15T21:05:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	actually ust started in recovery mode and it seems to work :-)
2009-05-15T21:05:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	now I have to find out what does not work in normal mode :-)
2009-05-15T21:06:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	We'll be here. :)
2009-05-15T21:06:00.000Z	tokyoahead	e1nh4nd3r	thanks for the help :-)
2009-05-15T21:07:00.000Z	e1nh4nd3r	tokyoahead	No problem! Amatueurs helping amateurs. :)
