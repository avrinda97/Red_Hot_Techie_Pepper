2005-04-19T08:34:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	hehe.. Thanks.
2005-04-19T08:35:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	beats 'Debian/Ubuntu'.
2005-04-19T09:46:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	have you toyed with Luminocity at all? It's quite fun for a short while :)
2005-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	I wish I could... I'm using a radeon 9700 mobility though :(
2005-04-19T09:48:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	the level of elasticity they've given to the windows in the shots is fun, but a little silly. They must like playing with them at that level :)
2005-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	yeah good for testing, but not very practical. The way it was set when I tried it, the windows never actually did stop moving even when at rest.
2005-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	and you'd be surprised how fun it is with even poor 3d hardware... You can make the windows smaller. There is a good walkthrough to get it going on the Gentoo forums.
2005-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	Well, they're turning it down for the merge I believe. And its an original and good idea
2005-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	When I saw the videos I just went 'ah... that's why windows always felt so clunky and harsh'
2005-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	I'd hope they would turn it down.hehe.. Apparently you need little motion to get some effect.
2005-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	I'd never thought that real world objects almost always have a certain give to them :)
2005-04-19T09:53:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	yeah I read on one of the dev-blogs that they were suprised how much more "tangible" windows felt with even a little motion. Pretty exciting really.
2005-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	I can see some people moaning though :)
2005-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	probably bundled with the reduced_resources one.
2005-04-19T09:57:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	Yeah... and if people need the setting enough then it will get put in a capplet. I like that way of doing things (starting minimal and only adding options people have been proven to need)
2005-04-19T09:58:00.000Z	dcraven	Arnia	that philosophy seems to be working pretty well.
2005-04-19T09:59:00.000Z	Arnia	dcraven	Yeah, it definitely stops option bloat
