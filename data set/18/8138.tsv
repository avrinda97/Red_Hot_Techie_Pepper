2009-06-25T05:48:00.000Z	RealKillaz		hi there. I would like to install a newer version of a package then the one that is available in Synaptic is there a way to do this? I'm actually referring to the package maven
2009-06-25T05:49:00.000Z	RealKillaz		now Synaptic has 2.0.8, but I would like to install 2.0.9
2009-06-25T05:49:00.000Z	RealKillaz		is there a way to find out if there is a newer version in Synaptic...
2009-06-25T05:51:00.000Z	RealKillaz		intrepid has maven 2.0.9
2009-06-25T05:51:00.000Z	RealKillaz		but I'm still on hardy, but would like the version 2.0.9 of maven
2009-06-25T05:52:00.000Z	RealKillaz		is there a way to get the intrepid version installed?
2009-06-25T05:52:00.000Z	bazhang	RealKillaz	don't mix version repos, a very bad idea
2009-06-25T05:52:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	so I need to install it manually? why don't ubuntu make 2.0.9 available for hardy?
2009-06-25T05:53:00.000Z	bazhang	RealKillaz	mixing those packages is not supported and will lead to problems
2009-06-25T05:53:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	ok I unerstand, but what is the policy of ubuntu of packages update?
2009-06-25T05:54:00.000Z	bazhang	RealKillaz	it might be in backports, otherwise the only option is to upgrade versions
2009-06-25T05:57:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	ok in backport. I will take a look at backport
2009-06-25T06:00:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	should I look in the hardy backports repos if I'm using hardy?
2009-06-25T06:00:00.000Z	bazhang	RealKillaz	yep
2009-06-25T06:01:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	one more Q how can I find out that I'm really using hardy.
2009-06-25T06:02:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	just to remove any uncertainty :-)
2009-06-25T06:02:00.000Z	bazhang	RealKillaz	lsb_release -a in terminal
2009-06-25T06:05:00.000Z	RealKillaz	bazhang	is there a way to propose a new package in the backport?
