2007-01-17T08:56:00.000Z	Jon335		how do I make Ubuntu turn the backlight of my LCD off after a certain amount of time?
2007-01-17T08:56:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	sys -> prefs -> power
2007-01-17T08:56:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	thanks!
2007-01-17T08:57:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	don't see anything there
2007-01-17T08:57:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	also check screensaver preferences
2007-01-17T08:57:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	I've looked in both
2007-01-17T08:57:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	edgy?
2007-01-17T08:57:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	yes
2007-01-17T08:57:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	"put display to sleep..." under ac & battery
2007-01-17T08:58:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	hmm, that's set but it doesn't work. the command 'xset dpms force off' does what I want it to do
2007-01-17T08:59:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	in screensaver, set "consider computer idle when inactive for.."
2007-01-17T09:00:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	that's set too, it just gives a blank screen with the backlight still on
2007-01-17T09:00:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	wheras 'xset dpms force off' actually does it
2007-01-17T09:01:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	also select under general "dim panel when idle"
2007-01-17T09:01:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	don't see that option
2007-01-17T09:02:00.000Z	frogzoo_	Jon335	power -> general
2007-01-17T09:02:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	that option isn't there
2007-01-17T09:05:00.000Z	Jon335	frogzoo_	and bulmer, '/usr/share/acpi-support/screenblank' does the trick, any ideas how to use it?
