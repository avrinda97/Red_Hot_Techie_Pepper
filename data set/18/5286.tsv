2011-02-17T06:10:00.000Z	needhelp1		i know how to read the man files but
2011-02-17T06:10:00.000Z	needhelp1		like with rm ... help rm ... rm help
2011-02-17T06:11:00.000Z	Pici	needhelp1	man rm
2011-03-02T21:51:00.000Z	Pici	needhelp1	If all the files are spread out in multiple subfolers you can use: find /path/to/files/ -type f -exec mv {} /path/to/newfolder/ \;
2011-03-02T21:53:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	 so .. find oldfolder -type f exec mv {} newfolderwithjustfilesnodirectorys
2011-03-02T21:54:00.000Z	Pici	needhelp1	yes, but you'll need the \;    at the end of the command, and a - in front of exec.
2011-03-02T21:55:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	 so .. find oldfolder -type f -exec mv {} newfolderwithjustfilesnodirectorys \
2011-03-02T21:55:00.000Z	Pici	needhelp1	no: find oldfolder -type f -exec mv {} newfolderwithjustfilesnodirectorys \;
2011-03-02T22:00:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	well, it preformed the task but all the files are gone
2011-03-02T22:02:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	i see what i did wrong, the directory i sent all the files to didnt exist, so it created the new folder on my desktop as a .mp3 file
2011-03-02T22:02:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	can i make this into a folder and hope like heck the files are still there?
2011-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	nevermind, the file it created is only 3.5 mb, it should be around 32 gigs
2011-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	i could cry :(
2011-03-02T22:03:00.000Z	Pici	needhelp1	Not really.
2011-03-03T10:29:00.000Z	needhelp1	Pici	hey
