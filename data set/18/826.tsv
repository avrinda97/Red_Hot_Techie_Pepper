2011-08-24T00:31:00.000Z	Mimoso98		Hi all
2011-08-24T00:32:00.000Z	Mimoso98		Is there any good server software for multi-way synchronization files between remote locations? We have two offices, one in Europe and another one in USA. Both offices need to share the same files, but locally.
2011-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	BobSapp	Mimoso98	that sounds like dropbox
2011-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	BobSapp		alternatively you can use unison
2011-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	BobSapp		but you have to be careful about who can use what
2011-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	BobSapp		and make updates
2011-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	Mimoso98	BobSapp	exactly! but we want a private DropBox in our servers...
2011-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	BobSapp	Mimoso98	what servers are you running?
2011-08-24T00:35:00.000Z	Mimoso98		Location USA has a Windows Server machine, with several network units to store information. EU office so far needs to connect to a VPN tunnel provided by USA in order to access those folders. In EU we have a Ubuntu server for some tasks. We wonder if there is a software we can install at US and at EU that will sun US's folders into the EU server, so European guys can access them locally without the need of using the VPN any m
2011-08-24T00:35:00.000Z	Mimoso98		ore.
2011-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	Mimoso98		* that will update
2011-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	BobSapp	Mimoso98	yeah unison will do that.
2011-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	Mimoso98		a kind of midnight update or something like that
2011-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	Mimoso98	BobSapp	is Unison stable and serious?
2011-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	BobSapp		just have it run periodically it will automatically calculate the files that have been updated and download them
2011-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	BobSapp	Mimoso98	uhhhhh yes?
2011-08-24T00:37:00.000Z	Mimoso98	BobSapp	Unison is the only option in Linux/UBuntu?
2011-08-24T00:37:00.000Z	BobSapp	Mimoso98	if you want something that IT people will already know use rsync and just take a copy down
