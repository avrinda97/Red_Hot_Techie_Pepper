2005-12-30T13:40:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	explain please
2005-12-30T13:40:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	you want to access a dir on a linux machine from windows?
2005-12-30T13:42:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	Yes. I am sharing a directory on this computer (running Ubuntu 5.04), and I want to access this directory from a Windows machine
2005-12-30T13:43:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	you need samba server on the linux machine and just use the built-in smb/cifs client in windows
2005-12-30T13:43:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	I have installed Samba
2005-12-30T13:44:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	server or client? to share folders you need the server on the linux machine. to access shared folders from a linux machine you need the client. i'm willing to guess you have the client installed
2005-12-30T13:45:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	Hmm okey, i'll check that out
2005-12-30T13:46:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	I have the server installed
2005-12-30T13:47:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	did you set up smb.conf?
2005-12-30T13:47:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	No, where do I find that?
2005-12-30T13:47:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	/etc, i'm willing to assume :)
2005-12-30T13:50:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	Windows finds the directory which is shared, the only problem is that the Windows machine needs a password to access the directory. I don't have that password (yes im administrator)
2005-12-30T13:50:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	have you tried your user and password?
2005-12-30T13:51:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	Yes I have. And also root username and password
2005-12-30T13:51:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	sorry then mate, i dont know :)
2005-12-30T13:51:00.000Z	Determinist	salah	try #samba tho, these guys may know
2005-12-30T13:51:00.000Z	salah	Determinist	thanks anyway
