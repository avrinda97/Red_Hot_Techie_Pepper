2005-02-19T06:46:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	should prevent him from hurting himself
2005-03-20T15:09:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	normally the reg files are located in \windows\config
2005-03-20T15:09:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	or \windows\system\config\ or something
2005-03-20T15:09:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	thanks
2005-03-20T15:10:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	not sure if you can open them using wine
2005-03-20T15:10:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	ya it seems the fake drive c has worked against me
2005-03-20T15:11:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	is there a dir called windows on that fake c drive?
2005-03-20T15:11:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	yes
2005-03-20T15:12:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	can you locate the files I told you
2005-03-20T15:13:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	im trying to access the keys from a mounted win partition, shouldve mentioned that
2005-03-20T15:13:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	no, I think you can access the normal win registry files somewhere on c:\windows\config
2005-03-20T15:13:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	these files are called CONFIG SYSTEM etc
2005-03-20T15:14:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	if I remember right
2005-03-20T15:14:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	looking
2005-03-20T15:15:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	im guessing i have to import the keys with wine first (its not there by default)
2005-03-20T15:15:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	its ok ill just copy the files to the wine c drive
2005-03-20T15:16:00.000Z	ubuntu	Coily	try that, I am not too familiar with that stuff, but on your normal real (not fake) c drive these files should exist
2005-04-05T15:11:00.000Z	Coily	ubuntu	is pretty pre-packaged...
