2009-08-06T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	chmod +x <flename>
2009-08-06T03:04:00.000Z	Zobin	ActionParsnip	It says that it cannot access the file
2009-08-06T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	your wd needs to be the sam as the fle, you alo need to replace <filename> with te actual filename
2009-08-06T03:05:00.000Z	Zobin	ActionParsnip	yeah I did all of that
2009-08-06T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	if you get no output then the fil will be marked as executable
2009-08-06T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	you need to ha the direcory you are working in, in the terminal the same as the containing folder of the file
2009-08-06T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	e.g.   if the file is on the desktop you ill need to type:   cd ~/Desktop
2009-08-06T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	then chmod +x the file
2009-08-06T03:08:00.000Z	Zobin	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I am in the same folder as well
2009-08-06T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	dont forget linux i case sensitie, use tab to complete the filename
2009-08-06T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	it means make it executable, its an option of chmod
2009-08-06T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	chmod +x ATi....  whtever the filenmae is. I dont know te exact name of the file so you ill have to be the smart one here
2009-08-06T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	no, its your file so you do not need sudo
2009-08-06T03:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	yes
2009-08-06T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	if you dnload stuffto the root of home instead of the desktop, your system will look neater and you will know exactly whee stff is
2009-08-06T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zobin	open nautilus and drag the file off the desktop to the nautilus window. The default location for nautilus to start is ~/ so is easy to locate
