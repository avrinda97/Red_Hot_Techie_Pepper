2012-03-07T10:01:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	i have experience with efi bootloaders do you need some help?
2012-03-07T10:03:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	Yes.         I'm now confused whether or not if  EFI partition needs a boot flag.        And if it also needs EFI flag.
2012-03-07T10:06:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	are you running a mac?
2012-03-07T10:07:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	No. It's suppose to be a 64bit server, using an i5 processor.        (Harddrive size is 2TBs).
2012-03-07T10:08:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	is it Mac intel hardware? why is it efi?
2012-03-07T10:10:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	I thought uefi/efi is pretty much similar/same.
2012-03-07T10:10:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	not really Mac implements it slightly differently on some hardware
2012-03-07T10:11:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	I've always used this tutorial to chroot install Ubuntu: http://forum.ovh.co.uk/showthread.php?t=3787                 <---- But with this new server here, I can't for the life of me make it boot.
2012-03-07T10:11:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	that said, i have created a livecd that boots mac natively on efi
2012-03-07T10:12:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	Now I decided to use this http://forum.ovh.co.uk/showthread.php?t=5616         to work on grub-pc install, and I'm still having issues.
2012-03-07T10:13:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	if your hardware is UEFI you cant use grub/grub-pc you need grub-efi
2012-03-07T10:16:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	So I'm better off just deleting boot partition and reinstall the grub?
2012-03-07T10:16:00.000Z	Ho^Oh		Along with the kernel?
2012-03-07T10:19:00.000Z	damo22	Ho^Oh	the important part is that the grub efi executable needs to be on a FAT partition (on mac anyway) under the path /efi/boot/bootx64.efi
2012-03-07T10:20:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	I don't think my server is mac o_O
2012-03-07T10:20:00.000Z	Ho^Oh		I'll try out grub-efi now.
2012-03-07T10:20:00.000Z	damo22		ok, im not sure you might need to read the manual for your server
2012-03-07T10:22:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	damo22	The host pretty much spoon feeds me, To prevent that, I have to chroot install Ubuntu.
