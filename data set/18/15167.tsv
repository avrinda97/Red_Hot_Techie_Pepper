2005-06-12T16:33:00.000Z	pusling	limer	dvd do not get mountet. Pint your mediaplayer to /dev/hdc
2005-06-12T16:33:00.000Z	limer	pusling	I've done that and vlc just flashes a bar for a second and then nothing
2005-06-12T16:34:00.000Z	limer	pusling	let me give you totem's error
2005-06-12T16:34:00.000Z	limer	pusling	could not read from resource
2005-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	pusling	limer	have you decss and stuff installed ?
2005-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	limer	pusling	looking into it now, I assumed it was by default
2005-06-12T16:36:00.000Z	pusling	limer	decss is kind of non-free ;)
2005-06-12T16:36:00.000Z	limer	pusling	gotcha.  I knew that it was but thought the *AAs had just given up
2005-06-12T16:36:00.000Z	limer	pusling	that'll be the day ;)
2005-06-12T16:38:00.000Z	limer	pusling	package is missing
2005-06-12T16:40:00.000Z	pusling	limer	I think it is called libdvdcss or something like that
2005-06-12T16:40:00.000Z	limer	pusling	yes, but it is gone from the repositories now
2005-06-12T16:41:00.000Z	pusling	limer	you might be able to install from marillat archive, but be carefull
2005-06-12T16:42:00.000Z	limer	pusling	not sure what that is.  I will look around for deb binaries me thinks
2005-06-12T16:42:00.000Z	pusling	limer	ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat i think
2005-06-12T16:43:00.000Z	limer	pusling	ok, execute dpkg -i ?
2005-06-12T16:43:00.000Z	pusling	limer	something like that. yes
