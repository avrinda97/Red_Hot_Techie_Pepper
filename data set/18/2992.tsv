2010-01-07T20:14:00.000Z	ivanatora		I'm used to have a root account to do the root stuff and also using a separate root account is more secure, IMHO
2010-01-07T20:15:00.000Z	ivanatora		now I'm using sudo bash to get interactive su session
2010-01-07T20:16:00.000Z	ivanatora		about security what if someone knows my user account password? he will have root access, too
2010-01-07T20:16:00.000Z	ivanatora		bb to check the man page
2010-01-07T20:17:00.000Z	ivanatora		I can't see how sudo -i is revelant to me
2010-01-07T20:19:00.000Z	ivanatora		yes, it simulates login session - executes shell startup scripts and runs interactive session, right?
2010-01-07T20:19:00.000Z	ivanatora		almost like sudo bash
2010-01-07T20:20:00.000Z	ivanatora		btw what happens if I add more users to that machine? Will all of them get sudo permissions?
2010-01-07T20:21:00.000Z	ivanatora		%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
2010-01-07T20:21:00.000Z	ivanatora		aah, right
2010-01-07T20:21:00.000Z	usr13	ivanatora	YOu have to edit /etc/group
2010-01-07T20:22:00.000Z	usr13	ivanatora	do not do it
2010-01-07T20:23:00.000Z	usr13	ivanatora	su -i    # Will give you root shell.
2010-01-07T20:24:00.000Z	ivanatora	usr13	yes, I'm not so concerned in having a root shell as a using it as a separate account (with its own home dir and password)
2010-01-07T20:24:00.000Z	usr13	ivanatora	sudo -i    # Will give you root shell.
2010-01-07T20:24:00.000Z	usr13	ivanatora	Sorry  su -i  was mistake.
2010-01-07T20:29:00.000Z	ivanatora	usr13	yep, sure
2010-01-07T20:30:00.000Z	usr13	ivanatora	you can also do  sudo su -  but sudo -i is fewer keystroks.
