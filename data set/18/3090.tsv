2009-12-30T21:06:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A		why is gparted installed on the live-cd when it is missing programs to actually work>
2009-12-30T21:07:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A		is there a way to resize the root partition with help of the live cd?
2009-12-30T21:07:00.000Z	c3101	PrototypeX29A	is your root partition a LVM device ?
2009-12-30T21:08:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	does that mean any partition with a number of 5 or more?
2009-12-30T21:08:00.000Z	c3101	PrototypeX29A	erm, no, it means "logical volume mangament", and by that i believe that your's isn't
2009-12-30T21:09:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	i don't know
2009-12-30T21:09:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	i just want to resize /dev/sda1
2009-12-30T21:10:00.000Z	c3101	PrototypeX29A	firstly, do you want to make it bigger or smaller ?
2009-12-30T21:10:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	i want to make it bigger
2009-12-30T21:11:00.000Z	c3101	PrototypeX29A	please supply the output of fdisk -l
2009-12-30T21:12:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	hmm it looks like gparted thinks the change has been made
2009-12-30T21:12:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	although it complained earlier, that it could not do the job
2009-12-30T21:12:00.000Z	c3101	PrototypeX29A	well then , no problem
2009-12-30T21:14:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	well i will reboot to see whether it fucked up my partition table
2009-12-30T21:14:00.000Z	c3101	PrototypeX29A	hope you had BACKUPS !!
2009-12-30T21:14:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	usually an errormessage while repartitioning scares me
2009-12-30T21:15:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	c3101	of course not :)
