2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	no... that just allows for you to keep using the terminal
2007-08-12T11:46:00.000Z	brunotvrs		ohh
2007-08-12T11:46:00.000Z	brunotvrs		What's the option to close the terminal without closing the programme?
2007-08-12T11:46:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	the program will stay open for as long as you have the terminal open but you can still use the terminal
2007-08-12T11:47:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	Are you using kdm?
2007-08-12T11:48:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	might want to try gmrun
2007-08-12T11:49:00.000Z	brunotvrs	ash_	blackbox, the terminal is gnome-terminal, or xterm
2007-08-12T11:50:00.000Z	brunotvrs	ash_	is gmrun a terminal?
2007-08-12T11:50:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	if you run gmrun then you can run a program in the background and close the terminal... I'm new to linux myself too but yeah
2007-08-12T11:50:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	gmrun is like a "Run command" window
2007-08-12T11:50:00.000Z	brunotvrs		oh
2007-08-12T11:50:00.000Z	brunotvrs		works with blackbox?
2007-08-12T11:51:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	just type in the name of the program like... firefox.. and firefox runs and you can close the terminal you are working with... I'm not sure about blackbox.. but I think so.. just sudo apt-get install gmrun and give it a try
2007-08-12T11:52:00.000Z	brunotvrs		Thanks a lot ash_ !
2007-08-12T11:52:00.000Z	ash_		Anyone know the standard way to run a command as a shell process kinda think so it doesnt close when you close terminal?
2007-08-12T11:52:00.000Z	brunotvrs		It works :)
2007-08-12T11:52:00.000Z	ash_	brunotvrs	sure dude
