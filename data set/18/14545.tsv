2005-07-14T08:04:00.000Z	znh_		hmm.. why can't I update libc6 to the newest version?
2005-07-14T08:05:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	because you already have the newest version?
2005-07-14T08:05:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	false
2005-07-14T08:06:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	are you using hoary?
2005-07-14T08:06:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	yes I do
2005-07-14T08:07:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	if you install in some fashion a newer libc6 you'll kill your hoary
2005-07-14T08:07:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	aw :(
2005-07-15T11:50:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	back out of the dir, and do an ls
2005-07-15T11:50:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	already did that
2005-07-15T11:51:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	no 'extra' similarly named folders?
2005-07-15T11:51:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	only if you're using 'locate'
2005-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	you are not the first, nor will you be the last
2005-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	create what in rm?
2005-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	such a fast deletion function
2005-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	oh, yes, lol
2005-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	I only renamed the directory, and everything was lost in 2ms
2005-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	nalioth	znh_	thats crazy. did you use terminal or gui?
2005-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	znh_	nalioth	the terminal.. but now I use du -c -h, I see everything is in one dir
