2006-10-25T09:56:00.000Z	lwizardl		is apt down?
2006-10-25T09:57:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	that does not mean anything. apt is a program on your comptuer that conencts to servers. depending on what servers you have there, those could or not be down
2006-10-25T09:58:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	what issue are you seeing?
2006-10-25T10:00:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	yet you can surf, right? run gksudo /etc/apt/sources.list and remove the gb. from evey line that has that(gb.archive...) then run sudo aptitude update, and it should have been fixed. the commands are ran in a terminal, in apps>accessories.
2006-10-25T10:04:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	cat /etc/resolv.conf will show you your dns servers
2006-10-25T10:06:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	like I said, just archive.ubuntu.com
2006-10-25T10:13:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	can you post your sources.list file to paste.ubuntu-nl.org?
2006-10-25T10:18:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	this is what mine looks like. I strongly suggest you make yours look like that as well, since this is not readable, and you have repositories enabled that you should not have. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28268/
2006-10-25T10:22:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	tell me whether that actually fixed it, cause it is likely not gonna fix it just yet.
2006-10-25T10:25:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	post the exact error, and try pinging archive.ubuntu.com
2006-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	pastebin
2006-10-25T10:30:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	how about ping 195.248.90.23 ?
2006-10-25T10:32:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	can you browse web sites on that computer by dns names?
2006-10-25T10:32:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	or even just try ping google.com
2006-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	does browsing work on this computer?
2006-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	lwizardl	dabaR	don't know its headless
2006-10-25T10:36:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	we should have checked that first, cause that would have made this shorter. Well, what then, how are yuo going to fix the DNS issue? add a host entry to /etc/resolv.conf? You can add a line like nameserver 4.2.2.1
2006-10-25T14:22:00.000Z	dabaR	lwizardl	but you can ping IP addresses
