2005-10-27T09:14:00.000Z	KinkoBlast		i want to install "khelpcenter" for a few apps I use designed for KDE. How do I install that without the rest of KDE?
2005-10-27T09:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	you will need the libs at least
2005-10-27T09:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	are you low on space?
2005-10-27T09:14:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	Only arround 700 megs left. That's the broblem with a 3 gig hard drive.
2005-10-27T09:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	get a new one ;-). They're dirt cheap these days
2005-10-27T09:16:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	Not worth it. I also have a pentium 2 2**mhz processer.
2005-10-27T09:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	it's less than a  a gig. Definitely worth it =)
2005-10-27T09:17:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	I have a second (2 gig) FAT drive I haven't figured out how to use in Ubuntu yet.
2005-10-27T09:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	is it all plugged up?
2005-10-27T09:17:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	It was working in windows....
2005-10-27T09:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	/msg ubotu windowsdrives. Download and run that script -- it'll do it all for you.
2005-10-27T09:18:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	I don't have any information on it that I want to keep, though. Would It work better if I reformated it to some other file system?
2005-10-27T09:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	not if you want to transfer easily between windows and linux
2005-10-27T09:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	then go for ext3, sure
2005-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	OK. How do I do that, then set it up to work on here?
2005-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	use gparted, then /msg ubotu windowsdrives for the automount script
2005-10-27T09:22:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	apokryphos	OK, thanks
2005-10-27T09:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	KinkoBlast	actually... that script might just look for ntfs/fat drives. Better to automount it, I guess; I can talk you through it later
