2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	Lordveda		hello world
2007-05-01T11:45:00.000Z	Lordveda		I have noticed that any usb stick that I insert in my PC is mounted as root, is there a way to make it mounted as my user account???
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	Lordveda		including amarok,
2007-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	Lordveda		Exaile and Listen project work with Gnome
2007-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	Lordveda		seems that no one can answer my question
2007-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	Lordveda		well is there a faq to read in order to solve my problem?
2007-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	Lordveda		I need to make usb sticks to be automounted via my account not through root account
2007-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	Lordveda		It does but not for the user
2007-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	Lordveda		it auto mounts it with root permissions
2007-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lordveda	You are looking to mount a pen-drive?
2007-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	Lordveda	PurpZeY	usb mass storage
2007-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	Lordveda		usb flash
2007-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lordveda	I am looking to do the same thing...It's my USB Flash drive in Fat32...Ubuntu doesn't recognize it automatically?
2007-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	Lordveda	PurpZeY	It auto recognizes it but mounts it using root permissions.
2007-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	Lordveda		seems that this is a dbus,hal problem
2007-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lordveda	I am new to all this linux business. What is the problem with the drive mounting as root?
2007-05-01T11:55:00.000Z	Lordveda	PurpZeY	you can't manipulate things on the disk by deleting unneeded files or folders
2007-05-01T11:56:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lordveda	But I'd be able to just put it in the USB slot and read files without damaging the data? and if so, what is the safe way to disconnect it?
