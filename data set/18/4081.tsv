2010-10-30T21:27:00.000Z	fazl		i mean, even my device /dev/sr0 says 660 root.cdrom
2010-10-30T21:27:00.000Z	fazl		Mono, Fish, you two still there?
2010-10-30T21:28:00.000Z	fazl		ok, thanks fish
2010-10-30T21:28:00.000Z	fazl		I think my problem has managed to confuse everyone
2010-10-30T21:30:00.000Z	fazl		hey Fish, any idea what this means "/var/tmp/kdecache-fazl" is owned by uid 1000 instead of uid 0.
2010-10-30T21:30:00.000Z	fazl		i'm seeing that in the command prompt
2010-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	fazl		when i run K3B
2010-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	fazl		it looks like an ownership problem
2010-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	fazl		can i use the CHOWN command to change ownership?
2010-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	fazl		how would i do that?
2010-10-30T21:31:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	sudo chown <yourUserName> /var/tmp/kdecache-fazl
2010-10-30T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	typo before sudo chown root /var/tmp/kdecache-fazl
2010-10-30T21:43:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	cd /var/tmp
2010-10-30T21:43:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	Look at the file using ls -l   who owns it?  What are the permissions on it?
2010-10-30T21:45:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	ha :)  cd /var/tmp
2010-10-30T21:45:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	That moves the cli around the filesystem.
2010-10-30T21:45:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	ls -la  lists everything in the folder you're in with the permissions
2010-10-30T21:46:00.000Z	edbian	fazl	don't paste a ton of stuff in this channel!
