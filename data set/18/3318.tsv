2010-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	thanks
2010-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	where are you having trouble?
2010-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	no trouble, but the structure is very strange. Why should it seperated
2010-01-03T09:19:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	why design the structure like this
2010-01-03T09:20:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	are you trying to develop for this? I'm not much of a developer
2010-01-03T09:21:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	that is homework. Teacher ask us to think about that question? I have no idea why it will be like that.
2010-01-03T09:21:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	Which two fields are strange to you?
2010-01-03T09:22:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	it is continuous
2010-01-03T09:22:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	it is in 3 different fields
2010-01-03T09:23:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	two bases, I see that
2010-01-03T09:23:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	notice how it's 31-24 and 7-0
2010-01-03T09:23:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	the base is the LSB + the MSB, of the high byte
2010-01-03T09:23:00.000Z	chenwl	Broam	3 fields
2010-01-03T09:24:00.000Z	Broam	chenwl	base 31:24, base 23:16, base 15:00, right?
