2007-04-08T11:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto		does anyone now why my network domain (in resolv.conf) disappears on reboot? I set it in the network manager, and even manually edited /etc/resolv.conf to put it back but when i reboot, it's gone. This is in feisty. i asked in #ubuntu+1 but no definitive answer
2007-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	maybe because of dhcp
2007-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	it's a static config
2007-04-08T11:52:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	try chmod a-w /etc/resolv.conf as a workaround
2007-04-08T11:53:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	well... i already tried putting the domain entry back in the file manually (sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf) and it still disappeared again on reboot. Something is automatically setting this up and removing the entry.
2007-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	ahhh, maybe i should put the domain in the /etc/network/interfaces file for that adapter, along with the other static entries (ip, gateway, dns, etc). i don't know why network manager failed to do that though
2007-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	if it is a static configuration, why do you use network-manager?
2007-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	because you can configure your wired network with it, and you can set up all your static config with it
2007-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	if it can't really do that correctly, it should not pretend to :)
2007-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	network-admin should be enough
2007-04-08T11:58:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	oh, my mistake (not familiar with gnome)  i WAS using network-admin. sorry for the confusion
2007-04-08T11:58:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	ok
2007-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	yes, this is feisty  (i chose the system/administration/network, which is network-admin)
2007-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	there is a problem of network-manager overriding the static configuration... i have to restart networking after booting to get online
2007-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	borschty_	mister_roboto	i just asked if there is a launchpad entry, because that seems to be a known bug, but i couldn't find one
2007-04-08T12:03:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	in my case, everything sets up ok except for the missing "domain" entry, which causes me problems until i add it back again
2007-04-08T12:04:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	i tried adding it to /etc/network/interfaces for that nic, but the /etc/resolv.conf still lost it :\   (resolv.conf generated by NetworkManager according to a comment at the top of the file)  I wish it would quit breaking my setup :)
2007-04-08T12:04:00.000Z	mister_roboto	borschty_	so you say networkmanager is known to break static configs but there is no logged bug for it?
