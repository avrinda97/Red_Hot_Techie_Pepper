2006-03-25T08:27:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	the numbers sure are growing.
2006-03-25T08:53:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	it happens quite a lot, just randomly. secondly, it might be a freenode thing./

2006-03-27T17:54:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	close all open firefoxes. if none are open, remove the lock file
2006-03-27T17:55:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	lock file is at ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/lock
2006-03-29T10:35:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	you won't have to close programs.
2006-03-29T10:36:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	binaries are loaded into memory, the actual file isn't locked when you're casually using programs, unlike in Windows.
2006-03-29T10:39:00.000Z	neo911	YukiCuss	can i rephrase to make sure i understand... so windows lock the binaries in primary storage when it loads the app while ubuntu just loads the binary into ram but does not lock the copy in primary storage??
2006-03-29T10:39:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	correct.
2006-03-29T10:39:00.000Z	YukiCuss	neo911	Windows also loads it into RAM, but for some reason locks the copy on disk too.
2006-03-29T10:41:00.000Z	neo911	YukiCuss	ahh :-)
