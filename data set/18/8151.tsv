2009-11-17T08:41:00.000Z	bazhang	omedlomis	dont use the enter key so much, its hard to read your posts
2009-11-17T08:42:00.000Z	bazhang	omedlomis	I suggest you take a look at the guide I linked you
2009-11-17T08:44:00.000Z	bazhang	omedlomis	I suggest you slow down and read up on it.
2009-11-17T08:44:00.000Z	bazhang	omedlomis	I gave you a very good guide to peruse, you should first do so.
2009-11-17T08:46:00.000Z	bazhang	omedlomis	not really , especially if you dont know what you are doing
2009-11-17T08:47:00.000Z	bazhang	omedlomis	use the guided installer
