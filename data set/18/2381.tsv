2012-04-27T07:08:00.000Z	dforthman		sorry. i went to the restroom. did we determine if gogeta's cpu was 64-bit?
2012-04-27T07:09:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	some where yes but they where athlon64 not septrons
2012-04-27T07:09:00.000Z	dforthman	gogeta	this will tell you if it's 32 or 64-bit: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep clflush\ size
2012-04-27T07:10:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	not always my atom comes up 64 bit with that
2012-04-27T07:10:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	its not 64 it has some 64 support
2012-04-27T07:12:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	the septron was made before 64 bit was thought of
2012-04-27T07:14:00.000Z	dforthman	gogeta	sorry, i was thinking of the wrong command. it's getconf LONG_BIT
2012-04-27T07:14:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	32 on that
2012-04-27T07:15:00.000Z	dforthman	gogeta	this will tell you also: sudo lshw -C cpu | grep width
2012-04-27T07:16:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	thats 64
2012-04-27T07:16:00.000Z	dforthman	gogeta	ha
2012-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	i have 2 like that my n270 and this 3200+
2012-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	i looked it up before and its some odd set they used when 64bit was starting up
2012-04-27T07:18:00.000Z	dforthman	gogeta	gotcha. gotta love the emulations. messes everything up
2012-04-27T07:18:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	i think they where bad 64 bis rebranded 32
2012-04-27T07:18:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	thats pretty normal fo prosser makers
2012-04-27T07:19:00.000Z	dforthman	gogeta	yeah. that seems normal
2012-04-27T07:21:00.000Z	gogeta	dforthman	i popped in my 64 cd my mastake once and it did not work so who knoes
