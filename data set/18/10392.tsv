2006-12-14T11:32:00.000Z	lovloss		Im mostly here to see if i can answer questions, since im always asking. I try so many things, lol. Beryl one day. C++ the next. Rendering. New motherboard.
2006-12-14T11:33:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	lovloss	Hehe same here I experiment so much, its not even funny, an IT manager would look at my style of computing and probally stroke out
2006-12-14T11:34:00.000Z	lovloss	jb0nd38372	I live by the philosophy that making mistakes is better for learning than research =) Ive reinstalled ubuntu 4 times. I leave my system files on a seperate partition specifically for those mess-ups
2006-12-14T11:36:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	lovloss	Ditto... right now i'm running beryl, with kiba dock, running world of warcraft under wine emulation , my windows friends come over and trip out when I cube the desktop and start rotating it... esp when world of warcraft is on one of the sides full screen
2006-12-14T11:36:00.000Z	lovloss	jb0nd38372	lol :D Thats awesome. i need to figure out Wine
2006-12-14T11:38:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	lovloss	me too , the current version of wine .0.9.2 I think actually runs wow, without any other configuration other than running wine wow.exe -opengl.  Back a couple wine builds ago, lotsa editing was required, maybe they can implement .net structures someday soon
2006-12-14T11:39:00.000Z	lovloss	jb0nd38372	Whenever i install anything in Wine, the program wont start. Says that the file is a bad exe.
2006-12-14T11:41:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	lovloss	Ehh, I've not had that issue as of yet... I did most of my installs in ubuntu with automatix, and with wine, just ran ./winecfg after it installed and setup wine with basic options... , did a mime type to tell wine to7 handle *.exe's when clicked in natulas, and most things try and run that way for me, otherwise I jump to howto's.
2006-12-14T11:42:00.000Z	lovloss	jb0nd38372	hmm... i hope i get it configured right someday
2006-12-14T11:42:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	lovloss	you will.. :) got faith!
