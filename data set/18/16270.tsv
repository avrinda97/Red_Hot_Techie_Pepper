2004-11-13T12:33:00.000Z	mirak		ubuntu doesn't support kde, but i it possible to install kde with debian sources ?
2004-11-13T12:33:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	you can install KDE 3.2 from universe
2004-11-13T12:34:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	I also have some KDE 3.3 debs but they don't work just now
2004-11-24T09:28:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	why would they need an absolute path to the icon, that would go against the icon spec and good practice
2004-11-24T09:29:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	ask gnome devs, it's gnome that uses absolute path
2004-11-24T09:30:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	hum no sorry
2004-11-24T09:30:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	eclipse.desktop have absolute path to the icon
2004-11-24T09:31:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	that's crazy and I refuse to believe the spec allows or encourages it, it should be an icon name and the icon loader looks in the relevant paths to find it
2004-11-24T09:32:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	amarok could find is icon
2004-11-24T09:32:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	so I put the absolute path ad it workd
2004-11-24T09:33:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	what did it have before and what did it have after?
2004-11-24T09:34:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	just amarok
2004-11-24T09:34:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	and now the full path
2004-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	anyway I don't like how ubuntu handle aliens applications to gnome
2004-11-24T09:39:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	what is the full path?
2005-11-24T10:10:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	knetload
2005-11-24T10:10:00.000Z	mirak	Riddell	?
2005-11-24T10:10:00.000Z	Riddell	mirak	kubuntu dapper runs fine for me
