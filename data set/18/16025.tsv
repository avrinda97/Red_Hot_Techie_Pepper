2004-11-29T16:10:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	yep, worked fine as soon as I installed it.
2004-11-29T16:11:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	then I installed Firefox 1.0, Screem, ummm... courier-imapd...
2004-11-29T16:11:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	let's see... Firefox may have installed a few dependencies, I dunno
2004-11-29T16:11:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	that's right, from the hoary repository
2004-11-29T16:12:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	in the sense of adding non-Ubuntu repositories?
2004-11-29T16:13:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	kay
2004-11-29T16:13:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	worked fine before...
2004-11-29T16:13:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	any simple way of reverting packages?
2004-11-29T16:14:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	could be... I wonder if that's true. Is there a quick way of reverting to the packages from an older repository?
2004-11-29T16:14:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	(I'm new to Debian)
2004-11-29T16:16:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	funky... but... I can't get X started, so I'm relegated to aptitude
2004-11-29T16:17:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	thanks; I'll poke around in aptitude and see what I can find.
2004-11-29T16:55:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	does that allow you to change gstreamer's sink and source settings though?
2004-11-29T16:56:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	oh, not sure; I'm using irssi and I don't know how to scroll up
2004-11-29T16:57:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	not fun being in the console
2004-11-29T16:57:00.000Z	paul_	ogra	everything's weeeeeird
