2007-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	CuriosCat		How about this "unknown error executW: GPG error: http://security.ubuntu.com feisty-security Release: Unknown error executing gpgv
2007-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	CuriosCat		any insight on that one?
2007-05-26T16:39:00.000Z	CuriosCat		and doing sudo apt-get remove ethereal followed by sudo apt-get install ethereal didn't resolve it either
2007-05-26T16:40:00.000Z	CuriosCat		Yeah, ethereal needs a lot of stuff.
2007-05-26T16:40:00.000Z	CuriosCat		"dummy" ?
2007-05-26T16:40:00.000Z	CuriosCat		it seems instead of installing ethereal, it installed wireshark.
2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	CuriosCat		I strongly disapprove. That's the distro not only telling me that it knows better than me what software it wants me to run...but it doesn't even INFORM me of that fact.
2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	CuriosCat		that's kind of like microsoft distributing a "dummy firefox installer" that actually installs IE
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	kitche	CuriosCat	ethereal doesn't exist anymore
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	CuriosCat	kitche	The web site with source was there two hours ago :P
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	kitche	CuriosCat	it's called wireshark now
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	kitche	CuriosCat	they changed names a while back
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	CuriosCat	kitche	However, my point is, I should get something like "This product is obsolete and no longer included with Ubuntu. You may want to consider Wireshark instead."
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	CuriosCat		oh, it's the same product?
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	CuriosCat		I suppose that's different then :P
2007-05-26T16:44:00.000Z	kitche	CuriosCat	yes wireshark=ethereal with a new name pretty much and better coding :)
2007-05-26T16:45:00.000Z	CuriosCat	kitche	Same developers?
2007-05-26T16:45:00.000Z	kitche	CuriosCat	pretty much
