2006-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	everton137		hi, when I try to use "sudo", it writes "Broken pipe". Any tip for what is happening?
2006-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	bbrazil	everton137	what's the full command you're using?
2006-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	sudo vi /ect/modules, for example
2006-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	or sudo su, I cannot use sudo
2006-05-12T08:50:00.000Z	bbrazil	everton137	how about sudo -l ?
2006-05-12T08:50:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	Sorry, user everton may not run sudo on brussell.
2006-05-12T08:50:00.000Z	everton137		was me removed from sudoers list?
2006-05-12T08:51:00.000Z	bbrazil	everton137	any recent changes? In particular to security stuff (PAM etc.)
2006-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	I upgraded to dapper. I began to have sound problems and I justy booted in security mode. Sound problem  is fixd, but I have this sudo problem now
2006-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	I just dpkg --purge --force-all sudo ; apt-get install sudo
2006-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	everton137		after all this
2006-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	I guess I was removed from admin ist
2006-05-12T08:53:00.000Z	everton137		list
2006-05-12T08:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	everton137	yes, the purge would have emptied sudoers
2006-05-12T08:53:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	do you know how make user everton a sudoers again? add on admin group?
2006-05-12T08:54:00.000Z	bbrazil	everton137	run visudo as root and add yourself back in
2006-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	everton137	bbrazil	thanks! :)
2006-05-12T08:56:00.000Z	bbrazil	everton137	if you run into problems, ask someone (not me) for the relavent line from their sudoers file
