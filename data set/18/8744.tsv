2007-07-02T08:54:00.000Z	Stwange		any idea on transferring files from NTFS?
2007-07-02T08:56:00.000Z	Stwange		:)
2007-07-02T08:56:00.000Z	Stwange		annoying too heh
2007-07-02T08:57:00.000Z	Stwange		this could get to the point where I don't understand what you're saying anymore
2007-07-02T08:59:00.000Z	Stwange		is there a different way to access the mounted partitions? Instead of going through /dev/sda1 - am I looking in the wrong place?
2007-07-02T09:00:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	if its mounted it should be under /media
2007-07-02T09:06:00.000Z	Stwange	macogw	- thanks, I found it under media. This new fs is confusing. It still won't let me copy images across through, it says access denied
2007-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	open a terminal and "cd /media" then do "ls -l
2007-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	that's "ls -l" with no quotes...ditto the no quotes on cd
2007-07-02T09:15:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	some advanced things are only in synaptic, not in add/remove
2007-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	Stwange	macogw	I can find the program in synaptic, but the only options are remove and complete remove, I just want to open them heh
2007-07-02T09:19:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	thats for installing/uninstalling though...try typing the name of the program in the terminal
2007-07-02T09:20:00.000Z	Stwange	macogw	It found it :) and there are hundreds and hundreds of options to play with :) any idea how I can run the GUI that is definately there somewhere?
2007-07-02T09:20:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	the manpage might have directions
2007-07-02T09:21:00.000Z	Stwange	macogw	I tried that, but they are so varied I couldn't figure it out. Nevermind, having to use terminal is better than not being able to use it at all. Thanks
2007-07-03T09:11:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	no that's fine.  when there's more its usually for servers
2007-07-03T09:12:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	because /var can grow with error logs so to avoid root filling up, that's put separate on servers.  /home is separate so that if you reinstall your stuff's still there.  /usr can be separate on servers sometimes too to save the installed programs (ditto on /opt)
2008-02-27T08:44:00.000Z	macogw	Stwange	with compiz it does. if you switch to metacity, it doesnt
