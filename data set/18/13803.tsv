2005-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	cronic		How can I autodetect a new NIC in console?
2005-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	cronic		yessir
2005-10-30T07:42:00.000Z	CosmoDad	cronic	lspci and modprobe maybe?
2005-10-30T07:42:00.000Z	cronic		read errors are baaaad
2005-10-30T07:42:00.000Z	cronic	CosmoDad	lspci doesn't see it..... odd.
2005-10-30T07:43:00.000Z	CosmoDad	cronic	is it an PCI card actually?
2005-10-30T07:43:00.000Z	cronic		Yes.
2005-10-30T07:43:00.000Z	cronic		There is one onboard, and another PCI slotted
2005-10-30T07:43:00.000Z	cronic		It sees the onboard one, but not the carded NIC
2005-10-30T07:43:00.000Z	CosmoDad	cronic	and "lspci|grep -i ethernet" doesn't yield anything?
2005-10-30T07:44:00.000Z	cronic	CosmoDad	it's Ethernet -- and no it only shows the onboard
2005-10-30T07:44:00.000Z	cronic		I already did that. ;-p
2005-10-30T07:44:00.000Z	CosmoDad	cronic	what about dmesg?
2005-10-30T07:44:00.000Z	cronic		Nothing.
2005-10-30T07:44:00.000Z	cronic		Only shows ETH0
2005-10-30T07:44:00.000Z	CosmoDad	cronic	sounds like a hardware issue to me..
2005-10-30T07:45:00.000Z	cronic		I know the card is good, I just pulled it out of a machine....
2005-10-30T07:45:00.000Z	CosmoDad	cronic	maybe switch pci slots to make sure it's no IRQ conflict or something
