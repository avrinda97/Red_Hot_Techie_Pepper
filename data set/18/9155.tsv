2007-05-08T10:56:00.000Z	rubberducky		Can anyone help me with my file sharing problems?
2007-05-08T10:57:00.000Z	rubberducky		Can anyone help me transfer files from a windows xp box to my ubuntu computer
2007-05-08T10:57:00.000Z	rubberducky		I have samba installed and ubuntu sees the windows computer on the network
2007-05-08T10:57:00.000Z	rubberducky		However when i click to go to the computer...it just loads up a blank screen and doesn't show the files
2007-05-08T10:58:00.000Z	rubberducky		aliden8ed: what'd you put in?
2007-05-08T10:58:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Make sure you have smbclient installed as well, and a file explorer which supports smb://
2007-05-08T11:00:00.000Z	rubberducky	GenNMX	I have samba installed and im using naut from gnome
2007-05-08T11:00:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Try smb://windows box ip address
2007-05-08T11:01:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Also, make sure Samba is properly configured, such that at least Samba and the Windows Box is in the same group
2007-05-08T11:02:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Yes, you need to configure samba for client connections too...
2007-05-08T11:02:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	SWAT
2007-05-08T11:03:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Yes.
2007-05-08T11:06:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Are you using irssi in a ssh session from your Windows machine, or on the machine through X, or at the console?
2007-05-08T11:06:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	For the first two situations, your problem is not irssi.
2007-05-08T11:07:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Are you using Gnome Terminal box?
2007-05-08T11:08:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	Gnome terminal had weird font and colour defaults for me, you probably need to tweak it for your video card + monitor + X general settings
2007-05-08T11:09:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	xchat has nothing to do with gnome, except there is a gnome branch
2007-05-08T11:09:00.000Z	GenNMX	rubberducky	xchat is also very minimalist, except it runs in X. Although personally I use irssi in a screen session, since I switch to different computers as I roam around the house.
