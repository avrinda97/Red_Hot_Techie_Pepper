2011-03-17T20:57:00.000Z	PeaceMaker	SITZ	I had a mouse failed to connect often, and tried another mouse with the same model, works fine. It turns out the USB connector wore out.
2011-03-17T20:58:00.000Z	SITZ	PeaceMaker	well, I don't want to lose my this one ... any other suggestion ?
2011-03-17T20:58:00.000Z	PeaceMaker		The thin copper foil on USB was gone.
2011-03-17T20:59:00.000Z	SITZ		it seems to work fine when connected
2011-03-17T20:59:00.000Z	SITZ		like right now, i'm using it and its working fine :)
2011-03-17T21:04:00.000Z	PeaceMaker	SITZ	just use your mouse on another computer to see if works.
2011-03-17T21:05:00.000Z	PeaceMaker		My apartment is pested with mice recently.
2011-03-17T21:05:00.000Z	SITZ	PeaceMaker	works, and the same problem is there with windows too :(
2011-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	PeaceMaker	SITZ	if the same problem is there with windows, why not go to microsft and ask them as well?
2011-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	SITZ	PeaceMaker	Now, I think I  gotta do that :|
