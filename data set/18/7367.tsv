2009-05-08T11:42:00.000Z	gasull		Anybody knows how I can ignore the auth error above?  Thanks
2009-05-08T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	uninstall network-manager maybe
2009-05-08T11:43:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	it isn't installed
2009-05-08T11:43:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	Actually I'm trying installing those packages before upgrading
2009-05-08T11:43:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	right now
2009-05-08T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	just uninstall whatever it doesnt like first
2009-05-08T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	you can also speed up the wole thing with: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get install deborphan; sudo apt-get --purge remove `deborphan`
2009-05-08T11:45:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	thanks
2009-05-08T11:46:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	Actually the problem was fixed after installing the packages
2009-05-08T11:46:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	but I didn't start the upgrade so I'll do what you say too
2009-05-08T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	if its gonna roll then go for it
2009-11-13T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	sure, if you can get the debs, it'll be the same difference
2009-11-13T00:12:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	I mean if there is something like an alien command for Python so the package is now tracked by dpkg
2009-11-13T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	you could install it then lock the version....
2009-11-13T00:14:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	I didn't understand that
2009-11-13T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	you can tell apt to not download new versions of a package by locking the version number so it will not get updates, technically it is ignored
2009-11-13T00:16:00.000Z	gasull	ActionParsnip	thanks, but not what I'm looking for
2009-11-13T01:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gasull	reinstall ubufox
