2005-01-30T15:33:00.000Z	Xerbee		Hi all, im rather noob on this thing but i need some help with x-server
2005-01-30T15:34:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	what is that exactly?  You need help getting it setup?
2005-01-30T15:35:00.000Z	Xerbee	october	hmm sry for bad english first :) It says something like "Cant start your x-server plz reconfigure" but in swedish :)
2005-01-30T15:35:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	try this:   dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2005-01-30T15:35:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	that might help you out.  and don't worry my english isn't so good either, and it's my native toungue :)
2005-01-30T15:36:00.000Z	Xerbee	october	must be run as root...
2005-01-30T15:36:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	oops
2005-01-30T15:36:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	add sudo in front of that.
2005-01-30T15:37:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	you can always do:  sudo su -   (allows you to become root)  and then do things as root.
2005-01-30T15:37:00.000Z	Xerbee	october	ok its running.. now i have to select drivers... i have a ati card so i should select ati?
2005-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	that would be my guess ;)
2005-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	I saw something on here about ati before though.   Someone said they just released new ATI drivers for Linux.
2005-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	Xerbee	october	Ok i have tested that already, ati and then vga nothing works
2005-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	check out what Hwolf  said
2005-01-30T15:41:00.000Z	Xerbee	october	Should i use Kernel framebuffer?
2005-01-30T15:42:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	I'm thinking no...
2005-01-30T15:42:00.000Z	october	Xerbee	do you have another box?  that is online connected to the net at the moment?  (windows or another linux box?)
2005-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	Xerbee	october	Im on my laptop now, and installing on another box
