2006-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		anybody know how can I record stuff in ubuntu? neither audacity or sound recorder works
2006-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	what are you recording with?
2006-03-15T06:51:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	have you selected the mic for recording (toggled it with the spacebar in alsamixer/F4 and unmuted it 'm')?
2006-03-15T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	what is System> Preferences> Multimedia Systems Selector> Default audio source set to?
2006-03-15T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	does setting it to esd or oss resolve that issue?
2006-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	you should be able to test System> Preferences> Multimedia Systems Selector> Default audio source> esd/oss [Test] 
2006-03-15T06:58:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	set it to oss, then use audacity to record something
2006-03-15T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	yes
2006-03-15T07:00:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	turn off esd first, then
2006-03-15T07:00:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	System> Preferences> Sound> disable sound server startup
2006-03-15T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	and make sure you close all other open sound apps
2006-03-15T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	generally, no, but for audacity, yes
2006-03-15T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	have you tried arecord directly from the cli?
2006-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	there are lots of possible reasons; have you checked Malone?
2006-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	and no, you shouldn't be forced to stop esd
2006-03-15T07:11:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	perhaps you can test with flight 5 tomorrow
2006-03-15T07:12:00.000Z	crimsun	pinkisntwell	it's the very basic ALSA recording tool. Yes.
2006-03-15T07:12:00.000Z	pinkisntwell	crimsun	okay, thanks for all the help
