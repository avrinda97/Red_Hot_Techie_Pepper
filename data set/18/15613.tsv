2005-09-27T16:24:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	is it NTFS?
2005-09-27T16:24:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	you can't write to an NTFS partition in Linux
2005-09-27T16:24:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	should be able to do that fine
2005-09-27T16:25:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	yeah.. what shawarma said
2005-09-27T16:27:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	assuming you are in Gnome.. it should open up a window that you can drag your files to and then burn
2005-09-27T16:27:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	are you sure it's blank, and that you put it in the correct drive?
2005-09-27T16:29:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	well... open up a nautilus window and go to Go->CD/DVD Creator
2005-09-27T16:30:00.000Z	meuserj|work	ShadeZeRO	drag your files there and then click "write to disc" when you are done.. and choose your DVDRW drive on the next dialog
