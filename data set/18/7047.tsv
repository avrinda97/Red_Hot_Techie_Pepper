2010-06-11T09:49:00.000Z	jack_		Why does the computer shut down when I try to burn a DVD-Video?
2010-06-11T09:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	see if your logs reveal anything. this used to happen to me (overheat)
2010-06-11T09:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	less /var/log/dmesg.0 , for example
2010-06-11T09:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	gnome may come with a graphical log viewer, see the menus.
2010-06-11T09:54:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	I found the log file viewer. What do I look for that says my computer overheated?
2010-06-11T09:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	look for 'CPU' to begin with
2010-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	specifically, look for the log entries at the time you shut down
2010-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	None of the log files have "cpu" in them.
2010-06-11T10:04:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	I found a log entry in syslog: "Critical temperature reached (102 C), shutting down."
2010-06-11T10:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	there you go, overheating.
2010-06-11T10:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	perhaps your fan[s] is bad.
2010-06-11T10:06:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	That might be the problem, but when I set my computer down, I set it on a towel (don't ask why).
2010-06-11T10:07:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	I set the computer on my desk chair which is very uncomfortable.  This is why I put towels on it.
2010-06-11T10:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	i really don't know what effect that might have :)
2010-06-11T10:08:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	I'm sorry.  I didn't know if that might absorb heat or something.
2010-06-11T10:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	time to experiment :)
2010-06-11T10:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	jack_	try leaving ample space for air to circulate
2010-06-11T10:13:00.000Z	jack_	prince_jammys	not a bad idea
