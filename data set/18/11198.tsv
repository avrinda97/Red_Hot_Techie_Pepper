2007-06-26T15:22:00.000Z	aggiz		When i have untared a tar.gz what do I write to install? its 3 different files inside
2007-06-26T15:23:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	a .tar.gz file is just an archive -- if it contains source code, you normally run 'make' or './configure; make'
2007-06-26T15:24:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	you need to have the necessary libraries to compile source code though, you might need the build-essential package, and probably some others
2007-06-26T15:28:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	most likely, you want to just install packages through Applications -> "Add/Remove"
2007-06-26T15:28:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	as a new user, you probably should avoid compiling programs or trying to download them from their official webpages...
2007-06-26T15:28:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	in Ubuntu (and Linux in general), users don't download programs from websites like Windows users do -- we keep it all centrally located.
2007-06-26T15:29:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	imagine that *every* program you needed in Windows was available in Windows Update
2007-06-26T15:30:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	anyway, you can 'add and remove programs' to install developer packages that are necessary to install programs from source (if as tarzeau said, they're not available in ubuntu officially)
2007-06-26T15:31:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	in that case, 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'  then cd into your source code directory, run ./configure; make
2007-06-26T15:31:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	(*most* have configure/make, but some packages are different.. python programs are usually  'python setup.py install', perl programs are 'perl Makefile.pl; make'
2007-06-26T15:32:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	if in doubt, read the file "INSTALL"
2007-06-26T15:35:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	well, the thing is, when you're compiling and installing source code, each package is different, but most include a file called "INSTALL"
2007-06-26T15:36:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	you might be better off trying to start with something more "normal" like  Pidgen or the Gimp.
2007-06-26T15:37:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	generally, its best to first try compiling some popular programs first, they're most likely to have a large number of experienced programmers that "did it right".  Smaller programs might not have as many (if any) experienced programmers.
2007-06-26T15:37:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	Pidgen is what used to be called Gaim. It is a popular instant messenger
2007-06-26T15:48:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	personally, I recommend just running a 32-bit install of Linux on your 64-bit hardware... but if you're gonna run 64-bit, setup a 32- bit chroot and install firefox and flash in there
2007-06-26T15:51:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	^^^
2007-06-26T15:52:00.000Z	ericrw	aggiz	I haven't used any of these instructions myself (I already knew what to do and haven't personally written instructions
