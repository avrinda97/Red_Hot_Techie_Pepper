2008-06-27T20:24:00.000Z	adred		hi, what is the command to find a folder? i can't seem to find "phpmyadmin" folder. anyone know where it is located?
2008-06-27T20:25:00.000Z	oskude	adred	if you installed it from repos, it should be at http://localhost/phpmyadmin (but its a redirect or something, so it doesnt live in /var/www, check the apache config files)
2008-06-27T20:27:00.000Z	adred	oskude	yup i installed it from the repo. i get an error message when i enter that in the url bar. i guess something is wrong..
2008-06-27T20:28:00.000Z	oskude	adred	what error do you get ? does http://localhost work ?
2008-06-27T20:29:00.000Z	adred	oskude	something to do with Port 80..localhost is fine.
2008-06-27T20:30:00.000Z	oskude	adred	hmm, is it an error _in_ the browser or do you get a popup window with the error ? could you paste that error on some paste service ?

2008-06-27T20:34:00.000Z	adred	oskude	yup it is installed. says the one installed it already the latest.
2008-06-27T20:34:00.000Z	oskude	adred	then try: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart (i assume you installed apache2)
