2012-03-10T04:32:00.000Z	tete_		hi, i would like to configure my apache with vhosts, and i did it... i think, but when i open the browser and browse the ip of the server, i get the same as would i browse the domain... thats not what i want. i want to get a blank page displayed when someone tries to open the url directly
2012-03-10T04:33:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	virtual hosts is name based and depends on the host headers in the http get request

2012-03-10T04:33:00.000Z	tete_		this is my config
2012-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	tete_	ikonia	i know that and i hoped it would work when i call: http://$myip to get the default /var/www/index.html displayed instead of /var/www/blah.de/index.html
2012-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	how is $myip a name
2012-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	it's NAME based
2012-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	tete_		and how to configure apache to handle it that way i would like to have it?
2012-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	you can't it's NAME based
2012-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	tete_		it must work as i have seen this before
2012-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	no, it will go to the default host unless you use a NAME
2012-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	or you use IP based hosting instead of name based
2012-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	tete_		hm
2012-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	tete_		i only have 1 ip
2012-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	tete_		isnt there any "default" which should be used when no name is used (when a ip is entered) ?
2012-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	tete_		i cant believe theres no way to do this
2012-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	ikonia	tete_	no
