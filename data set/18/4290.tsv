2009-11-03T08:10:00.000Z	MoTec		Not too impressed with UNR 9.10, honestly.. Wireless didn't work out of the box, and there is no desktop-switcher - the package is missing.. has no installation canidate.  I don't understand why 8.04 worked great 'out of the box', wireless and all, and all I had to do to get a real gnome desktop was go to system - options - switch desktop mode... I thought newer versions would be better.
2009-11-03T08:10:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	What unit?
2009-11-03T08:11:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	dell mini 9.   I had to update packages over an ethernet connection then enable to wireless driver.
2009-11-03T08:11:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	no big deal.. but annoying.
2009-11-03T08:11:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	Just upgraded my Dell mini 9 today.
2009-11-03T08:12:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	You get the wireless to work?  It's not hard.. But it doesn't work after the initial install.
2009-11-03T08:12:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	Haven't tried, honestly.
2009-11-03T08:13:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	Although it DID see all the nearby networks, so... :-)
2009-11-03T08:14:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	just make sure you update packages.. then you go into system - hardware drivers and enable the proprietary broadcom sta wireless driver.
2009-11-03T08:14:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	Welp, it worked out of the box for me, is what I'm saying.
2009-11-03T08:14:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	I'm pitching in to help you out here, my box works fine. :-)
2009-11-03T08:14:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	That's really odd.. because I installed from a fresh download about 3 hours ago.. I had to update my packages before it showed under hardware drivers...
2009-11-03T08:15:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	I'm on the HP Mini 1000.
2009-11-03T08:15:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	Aaah.. A little different then... I found a lot of threads on the wireless on the mini-9 requiring an update before they worked.
2009-11-03T08:15:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	Yeah, I went the HP direction.  It runs OS X nicely too, but it's not made for screens that tiny.
2009-11-03T08:16:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	you using the UNR desktop thingy or you get a real gnome desktop somehow?
2009-11-03T08:16:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	MoTec	The former.  Works better that way.
2009-11-03T08:17:00.000Z	MoTec	KB1JWQ	the lack of a 'close' button in the upper right of the windows drives me nuts..
