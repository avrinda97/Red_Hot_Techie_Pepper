2009-01-05T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	nillerz	stop all uneeded services
2009-01-05T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	nillerz	all about the same, they all have X11 interfaces etc etc, there is a console one, but that will still open an xterm
2009-01-05T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	nillerz	if you do that your cd drive will eat the battery
2009-01-05T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	nillerz	still a power eater
2009-01-05T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	nillerz	the partition size doesn't matter
2009-01-05T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	nillerz	still running an X environment though, = more power
