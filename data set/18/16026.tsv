2004-12-01T14:27:00.000Z	s0cks	mirak	: Get a paperclip, straighten it out, and push into the small hole by the LED.
2004-12-01T14:28:00.000Z	mirak	s0cks	I have nothing thin enough
2004-12-01T14:28:00.000Z	s0cks	mirak	: A paperclip should do it, but in the case that it doesn't, you could certainly use a really small drill bit or perhaps a staple.

2004-12-01T14:29:00.000Z	s0cks	mirak	: Good greif, where are you from, mars?

2004-12-01T14:30:00.000Z	s0cks	mirak	: I dunno, beat it on a rock or something.

2004-12-01T14:31:00.000Z	s0cks	mirak	: Prison Bastille. Bound to be some shrapnel there.
