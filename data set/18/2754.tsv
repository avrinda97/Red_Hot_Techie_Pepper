2011-07-09T23:09:00.000Z	erle-	dork	but every other distro has it like that
2011-07-09T23:09:00.000Z	dork	erle-	environmentally speaking you'll be creating a lot of residual problems in doing that
2011-07-09T23:09:00.000Z	erle-	dork	the ubuntu case is a special configuration, it shouldnt be hard to change
2011-07-09T23:09:00.000Z	dork	erle-	ubuntu isn't oriented around that
2011-07-09T23:10:00.000Z	erle-	dork	ubuntu uses the same tools like any distro, if i configure sudo correctly everything should work
2011-07-09T23:12:00.000Z	dork	erle-	yes bottom line a kernel is a kernel, so you want a strong su password and the ability to make it strong and sudoers use their own pass?
2011-07-09T23:12:00.000Z	dork	erle-	i'm trying to understand what you want to do
2011-07-09T23:13:00.000Z	erle-	dork	that doesnt make anything secure, because sudoers can just change the strong pw
2011-07-09T23:13:00.000Z	dork	erle-	so why aren't you creating a chroot environment
2011-07-09T23:13:00.000Z	dork	erle-	why not jail off accounts?
2011-07-09T23:15:00.000Z	erle-	dork	what for?
2011-07-09T23:15:00.000Z	erle-	dork	i just want a stronger password for root-operations
2011-07-09T23:15:00.000Z	dork	erle-	because you're trying to give pseudo-permissions?
2011-07-09T23:16:00.000Z	dork	erle-	so don't give them root permissions?
2011-07-09T23:17:00.000Z	erle-	dork	i want to give them root permission if they know the root password
2011-07-09T23:17:00.000Z	erle-	dork	and nothing for their own password
2011-07-09T23:20:00.000Z	dork	erle-	i'm thinking, but introducing the concept to ubuntu is problematic, or any debian based distro...
2011-07-09T23:21:00.000Z	dork	erle-	what did you do?
