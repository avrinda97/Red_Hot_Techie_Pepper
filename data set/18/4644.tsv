2009-03-10T22:03:00.000Z	thatryan		ok I am really lost on installation here, I keep getting " GRUB  loading please wait...  Error 18 " on boot up after install completes
2009-03-10T22:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	some info on your Grub error 18 - http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB#Error_18
2009-03-10T22:05:00.000Z	thatryan	ZykoticK9	thanks.  how do I control where the boot partition goes though?
2009-03-10T22:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	do you already have Windows installed on the system?
2009-03-10T22:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	so this is the ONLY os on the drive?  that doesn't make much sense, as ubuntu would start at the begining of the drive, and we wouldn't expect this problem?
2009-03-10T22:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	it's MUCH easier to let the installer do the partitioning (i know you just had a problem with it, but...)
2009-03-10T22:12:00.000Z	thatryan	ZykoticK9	I have tried twice to no avail.. :(  would it be worth it to try reformatting the whole thing again with gparted, make it all ext3 or what?
2009-03-10T22:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	ANYONE have an idea, Ubuntu install gives Grub error 18 (re - Selected Cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS) when there are no other OSs are on the drive?  Hopefully someone here will have an answer, as I don't.
2009-03-10T22:14:00.000Z	thatryan	ZykoticK9	thanks.  Is there a way to tell it where to put the boot sector?
2009-03-10T22:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	Grub should be installed to the MBR and the files into /boot - don't know why that is outside your BIOSs range?  It's a mystery to me.
2009-03-10T22:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	how big is the drive your using?
2009-03-10T22:19:00.000Z	thatryan	ZykoticK9	20 GB  I just booted gparted live cd and it shows only unallocated 1.96GB space, wtf
2009-03-10T22:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	a 20GB hd should NOT be causing this problem, that's not a particularly large drive by todays standards.
2009-03-10T22:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	you there man?
2009-03-10T22:29:00.000Z	thatryan	ZykoticK9	sorry, had dog and mailman issue :)
2009-03-10T22:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	Incarus is it difficult to create a small boot partition with the Ubuntu Install CD?
2009-03-10T22:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thatryan	Incarus has the idea that perhaps creating a small boot partition might help with you issue, also it was asked if you had LBA enable in your BIOS?
2009-03-10T22:35:00.000Z	thatryan	ZykoticK9	Incarus  sipior , thanks for all your help, Ill get back at it later, gonna be late for work :)
