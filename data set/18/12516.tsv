2009-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	devnull_		ljl i figured as much
2009-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	devnull_		wether copy protected or not
2009-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	devnull_		on 2 seperate computers
2009-12-19T22:50:00.000Z	devnull_		with fully functioning DVD burners .... just get the no media found
2009-12-19T22:50:00.000Z	devnull_		but that isn't my main concern ... i am more worried with all this USB enumeration in my log files that only started in8.10
2009-12-19T22:51:00.000Z	devnull_		ljl that looks like one that I have followed ... sorry for the typing .. my display is so laggy I am a minute ahead of my screen
2009-12-19T22:51:00.000Z	devnull_		how i hate ATI with the most passion
2009-12-19T22:52:00.000Z	devnull_		and another note ... I do blame the industry for the DVD issues ... but if windows can read it Linux can ... and if Linx isn't reading it than it is a Ubuntu problem
2009-12-19T22:52:00.000Z	devnull_		internal readeon express 200m on my Laptop
2009-12-19T22:52:00.000Z	devnull_		how i wish :)
2009-12-19T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	devnull_	 ive seen some quirks with the player programs accessing dvd's if i mount them and tell the player to 'play the directory' they can play them. Not sure what the deal was with it. in 9.10 i had the issue.. then it started working properly
2009-12-19T22:53:00.000Z	devnull_	Dr_Willis	if i could mount the dvd i would be happy
2009-12-19T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	devnull_	i also had a odd quirk where i installed with a flash drive installed.. and the dvd device /dev/XXXX was some how confused with the one of the usb device in the fstab
2009-12-19T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	devnull_	  if you cant even mount it. thats a deeper issue then
2009-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	devnull_	Dr_Willis	yea there is something up ... it sounds like the DVD reading libs are not installed but I have installed them multiple times
2009-12-19T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	devnull_	 but to read them as a data disk.. theres no real libs needed. Does the disk read normal dvd data disks yuve made? how about data cd's ?
2009-12-19T22:56:00.000Z	devnull_	Dr_Willis	the drive reads everything but Movie DVDs
2009-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	devnull_	 the only differnce i can think of is the dvd;s are using the UDF filesystem
