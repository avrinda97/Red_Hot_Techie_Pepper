2011-01-10T04:42:00.000Z	zaery		anyone a data recovery expert here?
2011-01-10T04:43:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	no expert but ask anyway
2011-01-14T06:48:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	looks like a windows share
2011-01-14T06:50:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	then what if i wanted to mount the folder "/home/zaery/share" on the IP "192.168.1.45" onto the point /mnt/share on my laptop, would i do "//192.168.1.45/home/zaery/share /mnt/share ....."?
2011-01-14T06:51:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	if your samba is configured correctly it might work. but you really shouldn't share / via samba
2011-01-14T06:52:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	there's no samba involved, i'm just naming the folders "share"
2011-01-14T06:52:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	so how do you do it? via nfs?
2011-01-14T06:54:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	normally, i hit ctrl+L in nautilus and type "sftp://zaery@192.168.1.45/" but i want it to be mounted automatically
2011-01-14T23:56:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	did you import the password?
2011-01-14T23:57:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	prolly not, what do you mean by that, and how do i do it?
2011-01-14T23:59:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	man ssh-add
2011-01-15T00:12:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	that only works for someone with the same username on both computers, right? I want multiple computers to all automatically mount my network user
2011-01-15T00:14:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	no you can specify the username you want to login with
2011-01-15T00:17:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	how would i specify what username to login with?
2011-01-15T00:18:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	<username>@<host>:/<path>
2011-01-15T00:22:00.000Z	zaery	sam-_-	so i don't specify the username in the ssh key, but instead in fstab?
2011-01-15T00:22:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	yes
2011-01-15T00:23:00.000Z	sam-_-	zaery	but i see you did that already. so there shouldn't be a problem
