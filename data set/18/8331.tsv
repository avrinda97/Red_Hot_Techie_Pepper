2008-02-03T13:43:00.000Z	nemilar		yeah, most lexmark printers are paper-weights when it comes to linux
2008-02-03T13:43:00.000Z	nemilar		they're win-printers, like winmodems
2008-02-03T13:43:00.000Z	nemilar		yeah, exactly, brizben
2008-02-03T13:44:00.000Z	nemilar		lol
2008-02-03T13:45:00.000Z	nemilar		every once and a while someone will try to paste their entire xorg.conf or something
2008-02-03T13:45:00.000Z	nemilar		:( no clue about the wifi
2008-02-03T13:45:00.000Z	nemilar		ok, my darn nautilus is broken
2008-02-03T13:46:00.000Z	nemilar		b/c nautilus is junk, like most linux software
2008-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	nemilar		thunar is pretty nice
2008-02-03T13:48:00.000Z	nemilar		I don't think it's nautilus that's causing the problem for me right now, though.... I'm pretty sure it's GnomeVFS
2008-02-03T13:48:00.000Z	underwatercow	nemilar	are you using hardy?
2008-02-03T13:49:00.000Z	nemilar	underwatercow	I have HH on a testing partition though
2008-02-03T13:49:00.000Z	underwatercow	nemilar	ah.... I'm having some nautilus issues due to the GnomeVFS changes they are making
2008-02-03T13:50:00.000Z	nemilar	underwatercow	on HH?  HH uses GVFS, not GnomeVFS
2008-02-03T13:50:00.000Z	nemilar	underwatercow	and the bugs are plentiful
2008-02-03T13:50:00.000Z	underwatercow	nemilar	are they not the same?
2008-02-03T13:50:00.000Z	nemilar	underwatercow	no, GVFS is the replacement for GnomeVFS
2008-02-03T13:51:00.000Z	underwatercow	nemilar	right... well, you know what I meant. :-p
