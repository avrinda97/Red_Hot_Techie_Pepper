2008-11-04T22:32:00.000Z	KX		Anyone use Pidgin, I can't find how to tell it where to save transfers
2008-11-04T22:33:00.000Z	KX		Right now it's using an non-existent directory which is kind of a problem
2008-11-04T22:33:00.000Z	KX		obviously
2008-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	KX		or etc. etc. the list goes on
2008-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	KX		Settings > Advanced > CTCP Replies?
2008-11-04T22:35:00.000Z	KX		Wait, whois...
2008-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	lianimator	KX	pidgin asks you before you accept the transfer, no?
2008-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	lianimator	KX	if you did auto-accept, then a folder with that user's email is created on the desktop
2008-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	KX		That's a network thing, no?
2008-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	KX		I'm lost, whois is like when I do /whois nick and it gives me information from NickServ?
2008-11-04T22:38:00.000Z	KX	lianimator	Err it does but the directory is non-existent so it just failed instantly without asking me anything
2008-11-04T22:39:00.000Z	lianimator	KX	look in Plugins
2008-11-04T22:39:00.000Z	lianimator	KX	the first one, auto-accept.
2008-11-04T22:39:00.000Z	lianimator	KX	configure it to another folder.
2008-11-04T22:39:00.000Z	KX		err
2008-11-04T22:40:00.000Z	KX	lianimator	there is no configure...
