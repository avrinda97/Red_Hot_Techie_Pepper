2011-04-30T01:06:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	 can you burn a disk there?
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	truepurple	coz_	 I can not burn any disks unless it is possible to revert back to 10.10 or otherwise get ubuntu to work
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	  well it should work,, what are your system specs?   cpu   video memory
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	truepurple	coz_	I listed it in the thread link

2011-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	 ok that seems like it definitly should work,, the only think i personally would question is the ati card since I know nothing about ati
2011-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	truepurple	coz_	 With facing these strange blinking dashes, does that mean it is not installing?
2011-04-30T01:12:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	 blinking dashes... I suppose you could try  rebooting holding down the left shift key to get to grub menu,, hit   "e"  to edit the kernel stanza adding   nomodeset  just before quiet splash and see if it boots then
2011-04-30T01:12:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	  not sure that will help but cant hurt either
2011-04-30T01:13:00.000Z	truepurple	coz_	 Could it possibly be installing at the moment behind this blank screen? If it is installing at this moment, restarting could screw it up
2011-04-30T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	 actually, probably not
2011-04-30T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	  it would be showing an idication of what is being installed if it were installing and you have a text terminal / black screen with cursor blinking
2011-04-30T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	  seems something is hanging
2011-04-30T01:18:00.000Z	coz_	truepurple	 ooo even if you hold down shift?
2011-04-30T01:19:00.000Z	truepurple	coz_	 I will try holding down shift
2011-04-30T01:20:00.000Z	truepurple	coz_	 KrisDouglas  Ok, got to a grub menu, I see a "previous linux version" option, should I pick it?
