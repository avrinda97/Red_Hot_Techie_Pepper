2010-01-19T23:32:00.000Z	Leonard_		Guys, I've been using Ubuntu a while now, but I have a lovely new machine, which is 64bit, and wanted your opinions on whether it's worth going 64bit ubuntu instead of 32?
2010-01-19T23:33:00.000Z	Leonard_		I have been trying it out - and it seems certain things don't work [as well] in 64 bit
2010-01-19T23:33:00.000Z	Leonard_		I have exaclty 4GB memory
2010-01-19T23:33:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	Then yes, still.
2010-01-19T23:33:00.000Z	Leonard_		things like Adobe Air (tweetdeck), flash
2010-01-19T23:34:00.000Z	Leonard_	michaell_	oh really?
2010-01-19T23:34:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	Some of your address space is actually taken up by device mapping. You're not going to get access to the full 4G of RAM until there's room for both your RAM and your devices in your address space.
2010-01-19T23:34:00.000Z	Leonard_		That's important to me
2010-01-19T23:34:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	Well, unless you play around with pae, but that's not necessary any more.
2010-01-19T23:35:00.000Z	Leonard_		Can anyone, off the top of their heads, mention things what work less well in 64-bit versions?
2010-01-19T23:35:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	Anything that involves tons and tons of pointers?  On the whole, the impact is negligible.
2010-01-19T23:36:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	About the only problem I've noticed is that Adobe Flash likes to hang more frequently.  But it's Adobe Flash, so what do you expect? :)
2010-01-19T23:36:00.000Z	Leonard_		So in theory, codecs, flash support, air support, java support, etc, should all work the same?
2010-01-19T23:36:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	I've been running 64-bit exclusively at home since Nov 2008.  Haven't seen any real issues with it for over a year.
2010-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	Leonard_		I know - flash is a pita - and of course silverlight is pretty slow on here but I mean I will probably run Win7 in virtualbox for photoshop/fireworks/sky player/etc that just run more smooth in that
2010-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	shortcircuit		Ok, mild clarification: I've been running a 64-bit Linux OS, but some apps may still be 32-bit.
2010-01-19T23:38:00.000Z	Leonard_		Well, I really appreciate your answers guys. Take care, and I think I'll stick around in here:)
2010-01-19T23:38:00.000Z	shortcircuit	Leonard_	I'm actually running Win7 inside libkvm right now.  Don't have Aero, but I don't know whether or not I'm going to need to fix that.
