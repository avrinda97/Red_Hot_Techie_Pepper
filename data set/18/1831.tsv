2011-07-31T18:56:00.000Z	diverdude		What should i install to get the entire compile environment with gcc and cc ?
2011-07-31T18:56:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	build-essential
2011-07-31T19:05:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	How about installing SVN from repositories?
2011-07-31T19:05:00.000Z	diverdude	theadmin	well i cant because i have a non-default installation of apache
2011-07-31T19:06:00.000Z	diverdude	theadmin	i am using an bitnami ubuntu image
2011-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	That's Ubuntu.
2011-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	We don't support derivatives, and I know it is stupid
2011-07-31T19:19:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	This is NOT a forum, even.
2011-12-30T19:02:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	Yep, that'll work
2011-12-30T19:02:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	It's just a storage unit, lol, how can it POSSIBLY not work?
2011-12-30T19:03:00.000Z	diverdude	theadmin	ok thats nice. Where will it then be located? And can i make it so that a specific user has access to 90% of the harddisk?
2011-12-30T19:03:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	"90%"? Huh?
2011-12-30T19:03:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	And it will be located whereever you mount it. You need to format it first though
2011-12-30T19:08:00.000Z	diverdude	theadmin	do i manually have to mount it every time i turn on the system?
2012-01-09T22:46:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	It means it can't find some file
2012-01-13T00:29:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	"crontab -e" will open an editor with a text file to which you would add the stuff you need.
2012-08-22T20:56:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	Dunno about "checkinstall" but all packages = dpkg -l
2012-10-22T22:54:00.000Z	theadmin	diverdude	No, the first one was right, lol
