2012-09-08T06:23:00.000Z	Leidenfrost		This is making me mad. I'm trying to change the firefox language to spanish. However, It just ignores what I specify in language settings, kde control panel and about:config
2012-09-08T06:24:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	do you have the firefox spanish locale package installed
2012-09-08T06:24:00.000Z	tomreyn		?
2012-09-08T06:25:00.000Z	Leidenfrost	tomreyn	yes.
2012-09-08T06:26:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	and your users' default locale is?
2012-09-08T06:26:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	have you restarted firefox since installing the locale package?
2012-09-08T06:26:00.000Z	Leidenfrost	tomreyn	I guess spanish, looking from the kde locale configuration. And yes, I restarted even the computer.
2012-09-08T06:27:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	run this in a terminal, and post its output: echo $LANG
2012-09-08T06:27:00.000Z	Leidenfrost	tomreyn	I was looking into it. en_US.UTF-8
2012-09-08T06:28:00.000Z	Leidenfrost		I don't remember how to specify LANG in a user-specific way.
2012-09-08T06:28:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	do you have a firefox extension installed for switching locales by chance?
2012-09-08T06:29:00.000Z	Leidenfrost	tomreyn	Nope.
2012-09-08T06:29:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	and firefox menus are currently in english?
2012-09-08T06:29:00.000Z	Leidenfrost	tomreyn	Yes. KDE is in spanish but firefox is in english.
2012-09-08T06:31:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	hmm if you hadn't told me differentl i would noiw assueme you don't actually have the locale package installed.
2012-09-08T06:31:00.000Z	Leidenfrost	tomreyn	I'm sure I have installed it. Aptitude shows it as installed.
2012-09-08T06:31:00.000Z	Leidenfrost		brb
2012-09-08T06:31:00.000Z	tomreyn	Leidenfrost	that's not a proper fix, just a workaround, but you could install the "Quick locale switcher" addon for firefox to make it work for now.
