2007-02-06T12:28:00.000Z	freezey		whats the best FTP service for ubuntu?
2007-02-06T12:28:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	FTP is inherently insecure, recommend you don't use it.
2007-02-06T12:28:00.000Z	freezey	Quintin	the ftp service is just used to host videos inside of a firewalled network
2007-02-06T12:29:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	Why not SMB?
2007-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	I see.  I would use SMB.  There is proftpd, vsftpd, wuftpd for linux.
2007-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	Samba.
2007-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	sso?
2007-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	You can make a public share quite easily.
2007-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	That's why you tell them where to shove the policy, that it's your way or no way, and that this is how it's going to be done!
2007-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	I'm not into GUIs on servers.  GUI for what ??  Admin of the ftpd?
2007-02-06T12:34:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	For what?
2007-02-06T12:38:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	audio yes.  video, not so much
2007-02-06T12:41:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	sorry, didn't see question.  If you use samba they can just open the file like it is local
2007-02-06T12:43:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	Click what kind of link?  What are the client computers running?
2007-02-06T12:45:00.000Z	freezey	Quintin	say i have a website and i have a videos linked to numerous websites all over the place... and the person just wnats to watch the commercial video i have on my website... without having to download it.. it will just open up in a designated player whichever one they use to watch videos...
2007-02-06T12:46:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	really depends on how the clients are configured.
2007-02-06T12:47:00.000Z	freezey	Quintin	with the windows machine we have right now it acts as a streaming server... we have the files setup on an FTP and they are linked to a website... and then they click on the video and it plays in like windows media player
2007-02-06T12:50:00.000Z	Quintin	freezey	Dunno.  Are you sure it is streaming and is not downloaded first on the machines now?  How large are the files?  I would really just use samba.  If this is a local webpage you can make your web urls \\myserver\myfile.ext
