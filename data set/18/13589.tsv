2006-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	VSpike	LjL	sweet..thanks
2007-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	LjL	VSpike	still anyway, it breaks systems.
2007-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	LjL	VSpike	... the link in the factoid?
2007-11-20T21:18:00.000Z	VSpike	LjL	I'm referring to the analysis in the factoid for automatix, wondering if anyone has analysed envy in a similar way
2007-11-20T21:20:00.000Z	LjL	VSpike	ah. perhaps not, there's not so many ubuntu developers with enough free time to thoroughly check all the dubious scripts that people write. anyway, there's nothing particularly mysterious: what we *always* recommend here is to use proper packages, and even then, only ever use third-party packages for things that are *applications*, and never libraries that are depended upon by other stuff
2007-11-20T21:20:00.000Z	LjL	VSpike	so a script that installs something in awkward ways is simply bad from our POV.
2007-11-20T21:22:00.000Z	VSpike	LjL	you're right, although it always strikes me that it tries to be as good as it can be, givem what it does.  It's probably better than people trying to install the nvidia binaries by hand.
2007-11-20T21:23:00.000Z	LjL	VSpike	still worse than people installing them from relatively reputable third-party repositories, although such repositories have not always been available
2007-11-20T21:24:00.000Z	LjL	VSpike	also, i don't agree it's necessarily better. if they installed it manually, they'd at least know (at least so one would hope) what they did. using such scripts, we simply have no idea what happened on their system
2007-11-20T21:24:00.000Z	VSpike	LjL	yeah I could never get third party repos to work for me, but that would be a better option its true
2007-11-20T21:24:00.000Z	VSpike	LjL	it would depend on the level of the user
