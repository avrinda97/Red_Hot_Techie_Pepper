2008-11-06T08:33:00.000Z	memeemeee		ok so I am back to square one here. my computer refuses to contact the router. I'm running Kubuntu 8.04 my hardware LEDs are working, I have set static ip info in /etc/network/interfaces and I have now tried 2 different ethernet cards (in different slots) with the same results! please help me! people last time seemed to think it was a hardware problem but I'm sure there's something were missing here!
2008-11-06T08:35:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	what type of network cards did you try?
2008-11-06T08:35:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	well the real tek should definately work
2008-11-06T08:36:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	perhaps you are setting a static ip outside of the routers range
2008-11-06T08:36:00.000Z	memeemeee	histo	that's why I purchased it. is sky2 the driver?
2008-11-06T08:36:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	no it should be like rt something or other.
2008-11-06T08:37:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	try pcimodules
2008-11-06T08:38:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	that will show you modules running for all pci hardware
2008-11-06T08:38:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	no idea what sky2 is sry
2008-11-06T08:39:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	you can rmmod the module you don't want.
2008-11-06T08:41:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	rmmod will not remove it on next boot only immediately
2008-11-06T08:41:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	you would have to blacklist it to remove on boot
2008-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	which device?
2008-11-06T08:47:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	network support should just be working right out of the box for the card you described. Your problem is lying elsewhere. Like settings etc... Try DHCP'ng from the router instead of static.
2008-11-06T08:47:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	then if that works then you can play with settings
2008-11-06T08:50:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	Sry I can't help you more right now i'm kind of distracted perhaps someone else can get you on the right track.
2008-11-06T09:33:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	sudo is saved for 15minutes
2008-11-06T09:33:00.000Z	histo	memeemeee	you don't need to retype your password everytime.
