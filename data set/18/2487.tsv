2010-05-05T14:24:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	Eh download the cd at ubuntu.com and install it?
2010-05-05T14:25:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	You need to tell your bios to boot from the SB card
2010-05-05T14:26:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	Yes, but then it still boots XP, even if I select "removable USB device".
2010-05-05T14:26:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	Usually you press F11 or F12 during bios image
2010-05-05T14:26:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	Indeed, but it still boots XP...
2010-05-05T14:27:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	SD card is not removeable USB
2010-05-05T14:27:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	I can try a 1GB USB.
2010-05-05T14:27:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	Good
2010-05-05T14:28:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	But it's not best quality and I'm trying to get it to work.
2010-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	I can't see it in Windows.
2010-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	What are you using now on the irc machine?
2010-05-05T14:30:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	Windows XP.  My only choice.  USB drive doesn't even appear in drive manager,
2010-05-05T14:31:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	Is the netbook only machine you have?
2010-05-05T14:31:00.000Z	LetsGo67	kjele_	And a laptop and an old IBM PC I'd rather not turn on.
2010-05-05T14:32:00.000Z	kjele_	LetsGo67	Well it is up to you to find which machine you can use your USB on
