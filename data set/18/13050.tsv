2006-03-06T14:04:00.000Z	progrock		Is there any software for playing TV with an ATI AIW card?
2006-03-06T14:05:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	have you tried tvtim?
2006-03-06T14:05:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	nope... ws just inquiring.. since im about to install ubuntu on my desktop
2006-03-06T14:06:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	er, tvtime. i'm not claiming it will work with the AiW, but it's what I would start with
2006-03-06T14:07:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	ok, thanks.. .was hoping someoen could point me in a direction.. whether it be the right one or not, lol
2006-03-06T14:09:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	do you know what chipset it uses?
2006-03-06T14:09:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	ummi can probably find out... its the AIW x600
2006-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	I know the brooktree chipsets tend to be well supported. but i haven't used a tv tuner in a long time
2006-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	true.. yeah.. to be honest im not to optimistic, lol.... but it would make it so i could get rid of windows... which would be amazing
2006-03-06T14:24:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	just google codeweavers
2006-03-06T14:24:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	OpenOffice probably handles most of what you would need, though
2006-03-06T14:25:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	yeah i figured.... but i have the teachers that want MSoffice docs only... and if im not mistaken corssover office will create documents closer to that
2006-03-06T14:26:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	crossover will run MS Office. but OpenOffice can create MS Office docs. I've never have anyone know that I created a .doc with OpenOffice rather than Word
2006-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	if you're more comfortable using vmware, go with that. crossover is exactly [tweaked/customised]  wine + office
2006-03-06T14:40:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	you could mute it in whatever volume mixer you prefer
2006-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	really? and that will mute it during startup?
2006-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	fangorious	progrock	maybe, no harm in trying
2006-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	progrock	fangorious	actually its already muted i think.. which would mean it doesnt work
