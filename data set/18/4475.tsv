2009-04-06T03:04:00.000Z	leonardof		Hi there. I installed Wubi 8.10 on a Windows Vista, and since then I can't get an internet connection *on windows*. Any idea of why?
2009-04-06T03:04:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	i dont think ubuntu caused that,could u give us more info?
2009-04-06T03:09:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	I don't think it was Ubuntu, but maybe Wubi
2009-04-06T03:09:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	the issue started after installing wubi
2009-04-06T03:09:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	well i dont,give us some more info about what's the problem you are having with your network
2009-04-06T03:09:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	I'm afraid of uninstalling wubi because then I might end with no internet at all
2009-04-06T03:11:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	normally after booting windows a couple of applications connect to their servers: msn messenger, skype etc. Now they just can't connect. And I can't browse, there's an error page asking if I typed the email correctl. f I'm connecte etc.
2009-04-06T03:13:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	@ your taskbar,down right corner,does the icons shows that you are connected to your network ?
2009-04-06T03:14:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	no they don't
2009-04-06T03:14:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	try unplugging your ethernet and then plug it back in,are you sure that cables are all set up ?
2009-04-06T03:15:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	I tried that, and rebooting and shutting everything off, and trying the other day... no luck, but if I reboot into ubuntu I can use the web (like right now)

2009-04-06T03:24:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	did u try restarting ur modem/router?Or trying to connect to it?
2009-04-06T03:24:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	i tried restarting, no luck. and i don't know its IP
2009-04-06T03:25:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	i dont think that wubi or ubuntu is what caused ur problem,maybe u should try getting some help for windows not ubuntu.
2009-04-06T03:25:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	thanks. I agree the issue would be very unlikely and sort of inedit. I'll see what I can do
2009-04-06T03:26:00.000Z	KiRiLoS	leonardof	sorry for not being able to help ya
2009-04-06T03:26:00.000Z	leonardof	KiRiLoS	btw, not my computer. I'll have a hard time trying to fix windows :D
