2012-10-30T15:02:00.000Z	offed		I want to install the latest kernel (3.7) on my Ubuntu 12.04.1 . I usually use 32 bit Ubuntu. But i am not sure which to download from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/daily/current/ . Can anyone help me please?
2012-10-30T15:03:00.000Z	jrib	offed	i386 is for 32-bit; amd64 is for 64-bit
2012-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	offed	jrib	I am on Core i7 Laptop...  is http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/daily/current/linux-headers-3.7.0-999_3.7.0-999.201210230406_all.deb for me ?
2012-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	jrib	offed	I don't know what you want to do.  Why do you want this new kernel?
2012-10-30T15:08:00.000Z	offed	jrib	My Laptop get freeze if it is Idle .... Some guys said installing latest may fix the problem . So i searched about the 3.4 but seems the problem still exist(Not sure though)
2012-10-30T15:08:00.000Z	jrib	offed	did you find a bug at launchpad?
2012-10-30T15:10:00.000Z	offed	jrib	Unspecified bug. Many peoples having the same problem. Let me search it again

2012-10-30T15:14:00.000Z	jrib	offed	most of those comments refer to a driver issue.  If you really want to try the newer kernel, then you don't want the "headers" package
2012-10-30T15:15:00.000Z	offed	jrib	From #ubuntu-bug someone linked to me a troubleshooting and in that guide said, these may happened for kernel issue .... that is why
2012-10-30T15:16:00.000Z	offed	jrib	I am using DEll L502 ... The Wifi is not working really
2012-10-30T15:16:00.000Z	offed	jrib	what i need then ?
2012-10-30T15:33:00.000Z	offed	jrib	see here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12045993&postcount=12 . The same thing happening for me
2012-10-30T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	offed	you can install the kernel using the deb on that page you linked to before.  Just grab the one that says "i386" and is not a headers package
2012-10-30T15:37:00.000Z	offed	jrib	please don't mind for too many questions i am asking, just trying to make system more stable to work for long time. Can you suggest me please that which version i should install(3.4 or 3.7) ? I am sorry for not having experienced installing kernel
2012-10-30T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	offed	try both :/
2012-10-30T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	offed	it shouldn't be an issue to install many kernel, you'll just get a list at the grub screen as to which on you want to boot
2012-10-30T15:42:00.000Z	offed	jrib	thanks , i will try both
