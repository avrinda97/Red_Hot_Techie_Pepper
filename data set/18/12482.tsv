2008-08-16T23:16:00.000Z	gnlnx	dabbu	I use gvim since I work mostly in gnome and don't usually run vi/vim on console
2008-08-16T23:16:00.000Z	gnlnx	dabbu	it's vim on a window
2008-08-16T23:17:00.000Z	gnlnx	dabbu	yeah...like MrElendig said
2008-08-16T23:19:00.000Z	gnlnx	dabbu	try typing gvim in console...it might be installed already
2008-08-16T23:19:00.000Z	gnlnx	dabbu	if not installed you can find it on Synaptic
