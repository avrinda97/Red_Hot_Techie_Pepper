2010-09-29T00:11:00.000Z	sirninja		I'm about to do a fresh install of ubuntu, but I need a proprietary driver for my wireless, where do I go to download a .deb so I can install it?
2010-09-29T00:11:00.000Z	Ken8521	sirninja	whats your wireless device
2010-09-29T00:11:00.000Z	sirninja	Ken8521	broadcom
2010-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	Ken8521	sirninja	there's a couple different broadcom chipsets
2010-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	sirninja		I need the package bcmwl-kernel-source
2010-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	Ken8521	sirninja	that should be on the live cd if i recall correctl
2010-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	sirninja		that's what I installed to get it working.. I just won't have an internet connection this time
2010-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	Ken8521		no internet connection required
2010-09-29T00:12:00.000Z	Ken8521		!broadcom | sirninja
2010-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	sirninja		is there a place I can download the .deb?
2010-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	sirninja		just in case it isn't on the cd?
2010-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	Ken8521	sirninja	you shouldn't need the deb.. iirc, it's on the CD, so just apt-get it
2010-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	sirninja		I'll try that first, but just in case that doesn't work, I need a backup plan
2010-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	sirninja		I don't want to be stuck without internet
2010-09-29T00:14:00.000Z	Ken8521	sirninja	look at that link i gave you, and there's "b43/STA - No Internet Access" it tells you how to do it.
2010-09-29T00:15:00.000Z	sirninja	Ken8521	didn't see that part.. that's exactly what I need
2010-09-29T00:15:00.000Z	sirninja	Ken8521	now that broadcom is making it open source, hopefully this is the last time I'll have to do this. :P
2010-09-29T00:16:00.000Z	Ken8521	sirninja	hopefully... i'm fortunate, all atheros here.. so they just work
