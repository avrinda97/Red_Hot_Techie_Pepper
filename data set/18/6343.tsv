2008-05-26T17:21:00.000Z	hp		hey guys. i just installed ubuntu 8.04 on an external usb hard disk (freeagent go 160gig) and during install i opted to install the bootloader on the usb disk (since the computer's not mine). while booting, though, i get a "grub loading stage 1.5. error 2" message

2008-05-26T17:24:00.000Z	hp	robg_	well, i used a livecd
2008-05-26T17:25:00.000Z	hp	robg_	which worked fine. and installed to the usb disk
2008-05-26T17:25:00.000Z	robg_	hp	so what went wrong ?
2008-05-26T17:25:00.000Z	hp	robg_	the install process went through, and i got to the point where i'm asked to reboot from the hard drive. doing that gives me a grub "error 2" message
2008-05-26T17:26:00.000Z	robg_	hp	you are doing something that the developers did not intend you to do.
2008-05-26T17:27:00.000Z	hp	robg_	installing to a usb disk?
2008-05-26T17:27:00.000Z	robg_	hp	what are you attempting to install on USB ?
2008-05-26T17:27:00.000Z	hp	robg_	ubuntu 8.04
2008-05-26T17:28:00.000Z	robg_	hp	I do not think it is possible, however if you succeed then it is possible. If you fail it is not possible.
