2007-12-27T17:07:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	does your bios support usb boot?
2007-12-27T17:08:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	well..i installed the bootloader on the usb drive. now the bootloader loads, but when i try to boot, it says "Grub error 17: cannot mount selected parittion"
2007-12-27T17:10:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	any idea mate?
2007-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	what filetype is the usb drive formatted ?
2007-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	the linux partition is ext3
2007-12-27T17:12:00.000Z	antixpaul		I think those usb images are meant to be fat paritosh1010_
2007-12-27T17:13:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	its an external hard disk. not a pen drive? i created an ext3 partition on it.
2007-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	ahh I see, so you just used a normal install cd to install onto the external usb drive?
2007-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	yes
2007-12-27T17:18:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	have you tried booting manually from the grub command line?
2007-12-27T17:18:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	no
2007-12-27T17:22:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	when grub first pops up press c to get to the command line then type 'root (scd0,x)' where x is your usb drive
2007-12-27T17:22:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	ok
2007-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	then if it mounts kernel <path to kernel>
2007-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	antixpaul	paritosh1010_	then 'boot'
2007-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	paritosh1010_		ok
2007-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	paritosh1010_	antixpaul	ill try that
