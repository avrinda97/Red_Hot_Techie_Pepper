2011-08-10T08:52:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	OK, I'll be working with you then ... it looks like ...
2011-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	the UUIDs will NOT be the same!
2011-08-10T08:54:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	OK.  thanks for the info.  here is my pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu.com/662350/
2011-08-10T08:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	this is some squashfs project you are working on?  sorry I have no idea what that is (other then the FS used on LiveCDs), so i really don't think I can help you.  Good luck.
2011-08-10T09:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	anything with # at the beginning is a comment (meaning it is ignored)
2011-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	if the fstab you pasted was from the LiveCD that would explain the squashfs stuff that surprised me
2011-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	I am pretty darn that is the same contents I had prior to working off the live CD (i.e. after I made the erroneous edit) ...
2011-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	for fstab, I mean ...
2011-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	i HIGHLY doubt that
2011-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	a regular fstab would NOT have squashfs stuff
2011-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	k.  well, at any rate I just need to add a couple lines to my fstab.  If I reboot and take out the live CD ... can I do this via command line?  Or does it have to be done off the live CD?
2011-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	it does NOT have to be done from LiveCD, IF you can boot your regular Ubuntu
2011-08-10T09:15:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	no - you actually were right - those results of "sudo blkid" are reading it from the live CD.  I just need the UUID from this, though ...
2011-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	i "believe" but am not 100% that the UUID values should be the same LiveCD or actual install
2011-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	OK, I am rebooting and taking the live CD out.  Can you help me do the proper edits for fstab via terminal commands?
2011-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	wsbl-uhpd651	hopefully ;)
2011-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	thanks.  and you have been very patient and helpful too :)
2011-08-11T09:16:00.000Z	wsbl-uhpd651	zykotick9	Thanks for your help last night.  I finally fixed the problem by editing the fstab file in the 9.10 live CD.  Took a few tries, but I finally got everything entered back into the fstab file correctly ...
