2004-11-08T08:59:00.000Z	fluoro		I don't think Rhythmbox is a crappy app.
2004-11-08T08:59:00.000Z	fluoro		It's missing a couple things that I would like though.
2004-11-08T09:00:00.000Z	fluoro		What kind of sound preferences?
2004-11-08T09:00:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Such as choosing the output sink!
2004-11-08T09:01:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	What else would you want to output to other than the sound card?
2004-11-08T09:02:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Well, there's esd, alsa and oss emulation, often one works better than the others for people
2004-11-08T09:02:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	But we don't want to have all of those.  We want OSS and ESD to die.
2004-11-08T09:02:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Uhm, so?
2004-11-08T09:03:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	I think having that in the sound player app is bad.  There should just be a "sound configuration" dialog somewhere that sets your sound system, and then all audio players use that setup.
2004-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	What's great about amaroK?  I've never seen it.
2004-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Check out their website amarok.kde.org iirc
2004-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Look at the feature list and screen shots.
2004-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Oh yeah, and the devs are great fun:)
2004-11-08T09:07:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	At a glance, it looks pretty cool.  Except that I'm not sure if I like the browser-style interface for a music player.
2004-11-08T09:07:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	There is the player-window only mode
2004-11-08T09:08:00.000Z	Pizbit	fluoro	Basically browser + player window, player window or browser window, three combinations:)
2004-11-08T09:08:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	Sounds potentially confusing. =)
2004-11-08T09:08:00.000Z	fluoro	Pizbit	But still does look pretty nice.
