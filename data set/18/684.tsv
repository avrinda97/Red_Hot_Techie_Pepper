2011-10-28T03:39:00.000Z	tjkent		ok so is there anyone that might be able to tell me why my log-in screen isn't showing up, I am not on the computer that is having the problem and I have run dmesg can any help please ubuntu 11.10
2011-10-28T03:39:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	sorry sounds like the same problem I am having
2011-10-28T03:39:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	probably don't have GRUB working right
2011-10-28T03:41:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	I don't understand the specific problem...no gui for login?
2011-10-28T03:42:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	what about ctrl+alt+f2
2011-10-28T03:42:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	does that get you a shell?
2011-10-28T03:43:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	what is your display manager?
2011-10-28T03:44:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	Do you have all of the dependencies for gnome, I mean did it work prior?
2011-10-28T03:47:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	well, a missing dependency would not give a dmesg error I don't think...have you tried to stop and restart gdm to see if it gives you an error?
2011-10-28T03:47:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	no
2011-10-28T03:47:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	let me see if I can find it
2011-10-28T03:48:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2011-10-28T03:58:00.000Z	tjkent	Boontoo	no such luck
2011-10-28T03:59:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	what was the output?
2011-10-28T04:02:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	have you tried re-installation of gnome
2011-10-28T04:13:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	hds are divided into sections called blocks, the superblock describes the filesystem as a whole
2011-10-28T04:14:00.000Z	tjkent	Boontoo	well do you have any ideas
2011-10-28T04:16:00.000Z	Boontoo	tjkent	I would try using a default display manager, instead of gnome
