2009-11-02T16:32:00.000Z	JordanC		MAMORY, boobs on the brain
2009-11-02T16:32:00.000Z	JordanC		Memory*
2009-11-02T16:34:00.000Z	JordanC		But it might not work because it feels lonely, then, who knows. WD Drives do have sentience :P
2009-11-02T16:35:00.000Z	JordanC		Ugh, double avash, double trouble :P
2009-11-02T16:35:00.000Z	JordanC		The double avash dash
2009-11-02T16:37:00.000Z	JordanC		Should help you :)
2009-11-02T16:37:00.000Z	JordanC		Hyello JohnFlux_ :)
2009-11-02T16:38:00.000Z	JordanC		If you're using a windows CD, you need to do a little messing around to get it to auto-boot, JohnFlux_
2009-11-02T16:38:00.000Z	JordanC		Since on the Windows CD, the INI files declare that the setup should use the CD drivers, but that's another channel :)
2009-11-02T16:39:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	JordanC	any ideas what the messing around is?
2009-11-02T16:39:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	JordanC	I'm also interested why it doesn't just work
2009-11-02T16:40:00.000Z	JordanC	JohnFlux_	Because the setup on the disk defines the drivers it should use to run from CD and use hardware, and so on. And since the INI files are on the CD, and the setup runs from it, they choose the default CD ROM driver
2009-11-02T16:42:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	JordanC	Just so that we're clear, I want to put a windows install disk image on a usb key, and do that using Linux
2009-11-02T16:42:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	JordanC	I'm trying to repair a windows netbook :-/
2009-11-02T16:43:00.000Z	JordanC	JohnFlux_	Yep, it's possible. You just need to extract the windows files from the CD, then change some INI values, then boom.
2009-11-02T16:45:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	JordanC	I think you need to make the usb key "bootable" somehow
2009-11-02T16:46:00.000Z	JordanC	JohnFlux_	Not if all you're doing is restoring data to a hard disk
