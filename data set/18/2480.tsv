2010-05-06T01:47:00.000Z	KRiMoRaL		I guess I can see the use for the on the left... to open the right side of the bar like they said in the link, but I guess we'll have to see. For now, I'll probably be moving it back to the right ;)
2010-05-06T01:49:00.000Z	KRiMoRaL		Nope. That was it.
2010-05-06T01:49:00.000Z	KRiMoRaL		You pick after it starts up _pg_
2010-05-06T01:50:00.000Z	KRiMoRaL		On the first window that pops up, there is a button near the top that lets you load live
