2009-11-26T02:59:00.000Z	Alan502		it doesnt seem like a question that cant be answered, erUSUL
2009-11-26T02:59:00.000Z	Alan502		but thanks !
2009-11-26T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alan502	well; maybe a openoffice channel ?

2010-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alan502	use iptables ?
2010-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	Alan502	erUSUL	what should i do with iptables?

2010-06-29T01:56:00.000Z	Alan502	erUSUL	thanks
2010-06-29T01:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alan502	from that how to « iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128 » that's supposing the proxy is in the same machine in port 3128
2010-06-29T01:58:00.000Z	Alan502	erUSUL	i gues i should only change the 3128 to whatever port i want
2010-06-29T01:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alan502	correct; if the proxy software is running in the same machine as the destination
2010-06-29T01:59:00.000Z	Alan502	erUSUL	so technically the VM is using the same ip adress as the host
2010-06-29T02:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alan502	!!??  i was answering this question « 22:55 < Alan502> Is there i way i can redirect all my web traffic to a proxy server?  » if your set up has other complexities (multiple machines or vm's etc) you have to describe it in your questions
2010-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	Alan502	erUSUL	xD well, but i don't know if it's too different since i'm using NAT port forwarding for my single VM and it uses the same ip adress as the host
2010-06-29T02:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alan502	see iptables-save
