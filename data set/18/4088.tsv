2009-07-22T22:50:00.000Z	SnakePlisken	RenagadeX	Its hard to learn it all on a single hackout eh ? :)
2009-07-22T23:02:00.000Z	SnakePlisken	RenagadeX	dbus running ?
2009-07-22T23:02:00.000Z	RenagadeX	SnakePlisken	I have no idea
2009-07-22T23:03:00.000Z	SnakePlisken	RenagadeX	ps ax | grep dbus
2009-07-22T23:04:00.000Z	SnakePlisken	RenagadeX	if you get more then 1 line itll be ok, most likely
2009-07-22T23:04:00.000Z	RenagadeX	SnakePlisken	well, nautilus is working now
2009-07-22T23:05:00.000Z	SnakePlisken	RenagadeX	Im not following, why do you involve nautilus in this ?

2009-07-22T23:11:00.000Z	RenagadeX	SnakePlisken	I was downloading a file using firefox and ran out of disk space so I moved the file to my external. now I need for firefox to understand part of the file has been downloaded, and not start the download again
2009-07-22T23:13:00.000Z	SnakePlisken	RenagadeX	Dl again, this is a mis-directed question and completely out of this scope
2009-07-22T23:14:00.000Z	RenagadeX	SnakePlisken	yes it is out of scope, but its a 7gig file and ive downloaded4 gb of it already
2009-07-22T23:14:00.000Z	RenagadeX	SnakePlisken	and my internet is horrid
2009-07-22T23:14:00.000Z	RenagadeX	SnakePlisken	so its a rather large problem
