2011-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	Ben65	pw-toxic	1) probably has a driver somewhere, seems crazy it wouldn't. 2) blu ray is playable 3) ... 4) cs1-5 work 5) sc2 works fine
2011-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	there is a native driver from creative which made it possible to use at least 5.1 sound, but im missing all the configuration i can do by software to the sound which i really need, because im a very music and sound addicted person - i have a very good sound system here and i can not allow any quality issues to my sound
2011-03-06T08:36:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	how about 3)? can you solve this?  this is the one keeping me the most from using ubuntu
2011-03-06T08:37:00.000Z	Ben65	pw-toxic	depends what cards, i don't see why it wouldn't work though
2011-03-06T08:37:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	actually can you tell me if i can use 4 screens with ONE AMD card which works with compiz? i could afford buying a new graphics card
2011-03-06T08:37:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	at the moment i have one AMD and one NVidia ... its hard for ubuntu to have two different graphic drivers work out of the box
2011-03-06T08:38:00.000Z	Ben65	pw-toxic	sorry, i'm not the best at amd/ati cards
2011-03-06T08:39:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	still 1) kills my idea of switching to ubuntu.. i nee full access to all creative options for my x-fi
2011-03-06T08:39:00.000Z	Ben65	pw-toxic	what options are on it that you need?
2011-03-06T08:40:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	toggle X-Fi Crystalizer; configure X-FI CMSS-3D; bass settings and advanced settings for each of my 6 sound channels (loudness)
2011-03-06T08:41:00.000Z	Ben65	pw-toxic	hm, you could try yelling at creative to make a better driver?
2011-03-06T08:41:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	LOL ...
2011-03-06T08:42:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	i was running ubuntu with my onboard card for about a year .. after 2 years of watinig creative released an official linux driver which actually worked with the card but there were zero options... no chance to get creative make linux support... stupid bastards...
2011-03-06T08:42:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	x-fi is super proprietary so nobody else can write drivers for it... many people tried but no one succeeded
2011-03-06T08:43:00.000Z	Ben65	pw-toxic	well i tend to avoid companies that don't play nice : /
2011-03-06T08:43:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	well but still creative had the best quality at that time
2011-03-06T08:43:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	i guess asus released a good sound card with linux support but im not sure
2011-03-06T08:49:00.000Z	pw-toxic	Ben65	actually im getting interested into reinstalling ubuntu and to by an eyefininty AMD card ;)
