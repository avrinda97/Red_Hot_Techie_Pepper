2007-11-03T20:38:00.000Z	needhel2		I've got a problem with my internet configuration in ubuntu 7.10. I just plugged out my internet cable and plugged it back in, and whops, it didn't work any longer :S I've got 3 network cards(eth,eth1 and eth2(the wireless card). I've always used eth0 as it has always been working until i plugged it out and plugged it in. can't figure out whats the problem. I can ping other computers on my network and I can access the internet through wind
2007-11-03T20:39:00.000Z	needhel2		but yeah, I can't access the internet through ubuntu
2007-11-03T20:40:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	Have you tried to restart the net with sudo /etc/networking/restart?
2007-11-03T20:40:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	 yeah, tried that :/
2007-11-03T20:41:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	Have you tried to restart the net with sudo /etc/init.d/networking/restart   rather...
2007-11-03T20:42:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	I've tried /etc/init.d/networking, but not /etc/networking/restart
2007-11-03T20:42:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	or is that the same?;p
2007-11-03T20:43:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	The second is right the first will do nothing...  netowrking is in the init.d dir.  Is it just eth0 that's borked?
2007-11-03T20:43:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	well, all the 3 network cards were working before.. I can connect with my wireless card too, but I can't get on the internet with it
2007-11-03T20:44:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	Are these all static IP's or dhcp?  And do you have all nic's activated in linux?
2007-11-03T20:45:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	Well, their configured as "enabled roamin mode" all of them. It has always been working:x
2007-11-03T20:47:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	but I think their dhcp?
2007-11-03T20:48:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	Try sudo /etc/init.d/networking force-reload  If that doesn't work you might need to reboot to get the netowrk to correctly assign the ip's.  Yes, roaming would be dhcp.
2007-11-03T20:50:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	I got this error when running the command sudo /etc/init.d/networking force-reload :  Igorning unkown interface eth2=eth2. Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1. igoring interface eth0=eth0.
2007-11-03T20:52:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	got that?
2007-11-03T20:52:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	 You might need to coldstart the computer...  Turn it all the way off wait 30 secs and fire it back up.  It'll clear the cards from the router too this way.
2007-11-03T20:53:00.000Z	phaedra	needhel2	Want to go to pm?  There's too much traffic right now...
2007-11-03T20:53:00.000Z	needhel2	phaedra	sure
