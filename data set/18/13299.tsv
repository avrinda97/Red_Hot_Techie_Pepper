2005-12-08T08:49:00.000Z	holycow	Zilenos	damn i wish i could remember what i did ... what are you uising to record?
2005-12-08T08:49:00.000Z	Zilenos	holycow	audacity
2005-12-08T08:49:00.000Z	holycow	Zilenos	oh i used that too, but it's been so long
2005-12-08T08:50:00.000Z	holycow	Zilenos	if i remember correctly and i could be wrong i had to turn up the mic volumes to actually hear the guitar versus simple miced voice
2005-12-08T08:51:00.000Z	Zilenos	holycow	yeah that works to, having the sound of amp go through mic then to computer, but i wanted the guitar plugged in directly to the computer, i can get the guitar to work with the speakers but when i record the sound onnly comes off the speakers only and does not record
2005-12-08T08:52:00.000Z	holycow	Zilenos	no no i meant with a 1/4 to 1/8th converter into the mic jack
2005-12-08T08:52:00.000Z	holycow	Zilenos	it comes off the speakers and doesn't record?
2005-12-08T08:52:00.000Z	Zilenos	holycow	yes
