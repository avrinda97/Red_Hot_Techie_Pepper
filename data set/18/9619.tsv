2007-05-23T14:36:00.000Z	ladonna		to use ssh to connect to one computer from another, do I need accounts setup on both with the same username?
2007-05-23T14:36:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	no just on the ssh server
2007-05-23T14:38:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	I'm ladonna@ubuntu2 but the server is something different tbuss@homeServer
2007-05-23T14:38:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	use ssh <user>@<other server>
2007-05-23T14:38:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	I tried that but received error: Name or service not known
2007-05-23T14:39:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	then the server does not having sshd running most likely or something else
2007-05-23T14:40:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	I'm sorry, typo on my part, your suggestion worked just fine, thank you
2007-05-23T14:40:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	you could have done another way but I tend to do the <user>@server way
2007-05-23T14:44:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	I'm just looking for a easy way to edit web pages stored on the server without physically having to go to that computer
2007-05-23T14:45:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	ssh and nano :)
2007-05-23T14:46:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	anything but nano :0
2007-05-23T14:46:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	wellyou could use vi or emacs but I m not getting into that war :)
2007-05-23T14:46:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	or if you want a gui way you can look into freenx
2007-05-23T14:47:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	ok, but is it possible to open these remote html files with a html editor such as quanta or bluefish
2007-05-23T14:47:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	well they are gui apps so you need freenx I don't recommand vnc much sicne it has many holes
2007-05-23T14:53:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	thank you for you help
2007-05-24T16:01:00.000Z	kitche	ladonna	nothing but html files should go into htmldocs or something close to that
2007-05-24T16:05:00.000Z	ladonna	kitche	this is an issue because I can't make changes when I use ssh. I don't have the perms to save the edited file
