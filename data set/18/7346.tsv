2010-05-17T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gps23: sure, you can use them as you like as long as the packages are not locked
2010-05-17T23:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Maximus__: try a different burning app. Ubuntu defaults with brasero which I have never had any luck with and I use gnomebaker instead
2010-05-17T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Guntbert: the user may still want the packages installed, the user may be reinstalling the app at a later date and will require the packages to be redownloaded again when they could be just left in place
2010-05-17T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gps23: as you use the OS you will probably help others too, makes the world go around
2010-05-17T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Maximus__: is the drive ok? Maybe you could use hdparm to enable dma if its not already
2010-05-17T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gps23: ubuntu isn't always the answer ;)
2010-05-17T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tweepcat: did you MD5 test the ISO you used?
2010-05-17T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gps23: maybe so but an OS is a tool for a job. Sometimes windows is more appropriate
2010-05-17T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!md5 | tweepcat
2010-05-17T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tweepcat: without md5 test you have no way of knowing the iso you downloaded is good
2010-05-17T23:54:00.000Z	dancek	ActionParsnip	i think unetbootin checks md5 automatically
2010-05-17T23:56:00.000Z	dancek	ActionParsnip	oh, ok. I'd call that a bug.
2010-05-17T23:59:00.000Z	dancek	ActionParsnip	doesn't it allow you to choose the distro you want from a menu? It knows the URIs for the images, it could know the URIs for the md5sums, too.
2010-05-17T23:59:00.000Z	dancek	ActionParsnip	I'm not saying it should md5 check any iso *you* give it
2010-05-18T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dancek	see what I mean
2010-05-18T00:04:00.000Z	dancek	ActionParsnip	hmm ok... i think i'll file a bug report for unetbootin. As for your suggestion, I'd rather that torrents were suggested as the primary download and the http downloads came with a big warning about corruption and MD5s.
2010-05-18T00:05:00.000Z	dancek	ActionParsnip	as for the basic principle of always checking md5 or sha1 etc before using an image, I *totally* agree.
2010-10-15T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dancek	that factoid is gone
