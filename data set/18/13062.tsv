2007-04-18T10:51:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	a firewall is essential..
2007-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	yes, it happens all the time.
2007-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	they would probably use it as a zombie host to send spam or as a point of attack to attack somone else
2007-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	a firewall is important on any os
2007-04-18T10:53:00.000Z	sorcerer	variant	what do you use to secure yourself ?
2007-04-18T10:53:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	a hardware firewll
2007-04-18T10:53:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	firewall
2007-04-18T10:54:00.000Z	sorcerer	variant	umm hardware .. like what a router ?
2007-04-18T10:54:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	check out netscreen.. they have some nice cheap (ish) and decent firewalls.. there are ones based on gnu/linux that are probably better though
2007-04-18T10:54:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	no, a dedicated hardware firewall.. thats all it does
2007-04-18T10:54:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	that goes to a router
2007-04-18T10:55:00.000Z	sorcerer	variant	i mean iam new to linux .. ubuntu .. do i need to be messing with firewalls and stuff coz i woudlnt have a clue
2007-04-18T10:55:00.000Z	variant	sorcerer	just install firestarter and start it up.. shouldn't have any problems as its a lot easyer to use than most other firewall software
