2006-11-30T08:37:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 don't paste like that.
2006-11-30T08:38:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 sudo executes a command.  are you trying to execute the command "r00t"?
2006-11-30T08:38:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 yes to me?
2006-11-30T08:39:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 where is the command "r00t" located?
2006-11-30T08:39:00.000Z	st3v3n_r0y	lullabud	 is works
2006-11-30T08:40:00.000Z	st3v3n_r0y	lullabud	 ofcourse .
2006-11-30T08:42:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 i really think r00t isn't a command.  what are you even trying to do?
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	st3v3n_r0y	lullabud	that is a user name
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 then running it with sudo isn't going to do much good.  sudo runs a command.
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 as in `sudo command --switch`
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 as in `sudo whoami`
2006-11-30T08:44:00.000Z	lullabud	st3v3n_r0y	 the way i get a root shell is `sudo su -`
2006-11-30T08:45:00.000Z	st3v3n_r0y	lullabud	 lol
2006-11-30T08:45:00.000Z	st3v3n_r0y	lullabud	 please . i am talking to other :)
