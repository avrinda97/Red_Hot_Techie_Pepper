2008-04-10T00:37:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	network-admin uses dhclient which uses avahi. Don't remove it
2008-04-10T00:41:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	you removed avahi-daemon?
2008-04-10T00:41:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	then reinstall it. From my experience you should leave it.
2008-04-10T00:42:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	what do you run? gutsy or hardy? From my experience it is needed on both.
2008-04-10T00:44:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	did you remove it? then reinstall it please.
2008-04-10T00:45:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	ok good. Then can you run those 3 commands again that you were given by jonaskoelker and pastebin them?

2008-04-10T00:55:00.000Z	Mr_Bad_News	hischild	i read something about wpa_supplicant causing conflict issues
2008-04-10T00:55:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	==>killall nm-applet && screen nm-applet <== to restart nm-applet. Then select your network manually.
2008-04-10T00:56:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	then  just everything after the &&
2008-04-10T00:57:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	ugh ... well if wpa_suppliant is causing you issues like you suspect, then kill the process and attempt to connect again.
2008-04-10T00:58:00.000Z	hischild	Mr_Bad_News	to be honest i'm kind of out of resources then :(
