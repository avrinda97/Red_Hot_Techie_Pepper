2007-02-26T16:20:00.000Z	mneptok	yomm	in Edgy and forwords Ubuntu uses dash for sh. most Unices use bash. i use zsh.
2007-02-26T16:20:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: I still use sh a lot to install things , would that be dangerous & why ?
2007-02-26T16:21:00.000Z	mneptok	yomm	learning about a shell is not a single book, but ther are some good ones. search for "bash z shell" on Amazon
2007-02-26T16:22:00.000Z	mneptok	yomm	sh does not exist. it is symlinked to another shell. on Edgy, that's dash. dash does not support all bash operands. so, if your script depends on bash syntax, call it explicitly.
2007-02-26T16:23:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: so for Ubuntu , I'd better drop all the sh'ing :)
2007-02-26T16:23:00.000Z	mneptok	yomm	no, just use #!/bin/bash for your bang
2007-02-26T16:25:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: I don't really recall ever having problems using sh though .. just lucky ?
2007-02-26T16:25:00.000Z	mneptok	yomm	thus far, yes, you are.

2007-03-08T15:59:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: And the blank screen was the default setting :/
2007-03-08T16:04:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: He could use credentials , no ?
2007-03-08T16:23:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: so the answer to my former question to you would be a big yes ?
2007-03-08T16:57:00.000Z	yomm	mneptok	: having said that imo Beryl has come a long way ,and is quite close to stable imo
