2005-04-07T14:55:00.000Z	Dalkus	kakalto	wrong channel to ask in :)
2005-04-07T14:55:00.000Z	kakalto		is it?
2005-04-07T14:55:00.000Z	kakalto	Dalkus	?
2005-04-07T14:55:00.000Z	Dalkus	kakalto	try in #CSS
2005-04-07T14:56:00.000Z	kakalto	Dalkus	lol, thanks
2005-04-07T14:56:00.000Z	Dalkus		Np.
2005-04-07T14:56:00.000Z	kakalto	Dalkus	does that include problems with programs crashing when editing a css file?
2005-04-07T14:57:00.000Z	Dalkus		Er, depends on the program :)  Which program?
2005-04-07T14:57:00.000Z	kakalto	Dalkus	the thing is, nautilus crashes when inside a directory with a css file
2005-04-07T14:57:00.000Z	kakalto	Dalkus	which is why I thought this was the channel for help
2005-04-07T14:57:00.000Z	Dalkus		You know how you have to go down the list each time, and hit enter on the part of the install you would like to continue with? I seem to remember lilo being after grub
2005-04-07T14:58:00.000Z	Dalkus	kakalto	In that case, sorry this is the right channel... but your problem isnt a CSS one, its a nautilus one :)
2005-04-07T14:58:00.000Z	kakalto		Dalkus; except it also happens with gedit and the archive program
2005-04-07T14:59:00.000Z	Dalkus	kakalto	have you searched google for the problem?
2005-04-07T14:59:00.000Z	kakalto	Dalkus	yes, with no success
2005-04-07T14:59:00.000Z	kakalto		I also searched the forums, with no success
2005-04-07T14:59:00.000Z	Dalkus	kakalto	sorry try asking in a few hours :)
