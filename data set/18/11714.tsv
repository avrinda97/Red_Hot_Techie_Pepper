2006-12-15T17:20:00.000Z	dope		is there a way to associate a domain to an IP like how localhost goes to 127.0.0.1
2006-12-15T17:22:00.000Z	vlt	dope	/etc/hosts
2006-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	vlt	dope	The one you tel it to use.
2006-12-15T17:36:00.000Z	vlt	dope	default is 5900
2006-12-15T17:36:00.000Z	dope	vlt	one more question.  how do i set system variables like $local
2006-12-15T17:36:00.000Z	vlt	dope	In a shell script?
2006-12-15T17:37:00.000Z	dope	vlt	so i can access the variable from the console.  it's for an ip and it's easier to remember a name instead of an ip address
2006-12-15T17:37:00.000Z	vlt	dope	FOO="123.13.123.123"
2006-12-15T17:38:00.000Z	vlt	dope	'vncviewer $FOO`
2006-12-15T17:38:00.000Z	vlt	dope	or better 'vncviewer ${FOO}`
2006-12-15T17:38:00.000Z	vlt	dope	?
2006-12-15T17:39:00.000Z	dope	vlt	like $foo:80
2006-12-15T17:39:00.000Z	vlt	dope	or better 'vncviewer ${FOO}:80`
2006-12-15T17:39:00.000Z	dope	vlt	how do i delete the variable?
2006-12-15T17:39:00.000Z	vlt	dope	FOO=""
2006-12-15T17:40:00.000Z	vlt	dope	don't know if there's a better way#
2006-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	dope	vlt	when i set the variable it's only active for as long as that command window is open
2006-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	vlt	dope	Don't know very much abou that. Google for "export" ... or if it's onyl for IP addresses: list them in /etc/hosts
