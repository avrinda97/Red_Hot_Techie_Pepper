2006-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	Tomcat__	SMAX	What happens on "sudo apt-get -f install libstdc++"? I hope you already took the 3rd party repository out of apt.
2006-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	SMAX	Tomcat__	It's said that libstdc ( but I wrote libstdc++) can't be find

2006-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	Tomcat__	SMAX	Take the 3rd party repo out of /etc/apt/sources.list. Then, what does "dpkg -l | grep libstdc++" say?
2006-09-23T06:14:00.000Z	Tomcat__	SMAX	Dapper release?
2006-09-23T06:14:00.000Z	SMAX	Tomcat__	Yes
2006-09-23T06:15:00.000Z	Tomcat__	SMAX	Output of "sudo apt-get -f install libstdc++6"?
