2008-11-13T17:27:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Is it good practise to have a dedicated boot partition? Currently I have winxp on a primary partition which is also the boot partition. Of course, when I eventually get round to deleting windows then I will need to rebuild GRUB so wondered if I should be proactive and make a small partition just for that. By the way, what is the point of primary partitions instead of making one extended partition and then making all partitions logical ones?

2008-11-13T17:31:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	I can't think of a reason you couldn't. What I would recommend (since you can only have three primary partitions) is one primary boot partition, one primary partition for whatever your current OS is (that way, if you need Windows in the future you can easily reinstall) and one extended partition for everything else
2008-11-13T17:34:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	adam7	At the moment, I have a primary partition with winxp on it. Thats my boot partition. Then I have an extended partition with Hardy on a logical partition and another logical partition for swap. Then i have a separate hard disk with a large extended partition with a logical partition mounted as /home and another logical partition for swap. I was told there are speed advantages to spreading swap across two separate physical devices
2008-11-13T17:37:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	if you use a lot of swap, having two hdds are a major advantage. If you plan to wipe your Windows install, what I would do is wipe it, then use gparted to resize that parition so that it's about 40MB smaller, and then make a 40MB boot partition at the beginning of the disk (assuming 40MB is enough for /boot)
2008-11-13T17:37:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	if you never use swap, then there is no advantage to having it on two disks (ie, you have 6 GB of ram)
2008-11-13T17:40:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	yeah, 1GB is enough for nearly everything.
2008-11-13T19:27:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	/boot is where the grub configuration file lives, and where the init images (not the right word) live

2008-11-13T19:39:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	adam7	Yes I saw that answer, thanks. Hence my next question
2008-11-13T19:39:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	oops, sorry, I can't read :)
2008-11-13T19:40:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	one advantage is that /boot/grub/menu.lst will be shared among all distros
2008-11-13T19:41:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	adam7	Thanks. But wouldnt it be a bad thing for the kernels to be shared?
2008-11-13T19:41:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	I *think* (I'm by no means an expert) that each distro has a different kernel naming scheme
2008-11-13T19:53:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	Maybe that would work better for what you want
2008-11-13T20:04:00.000Z	adam7	JonathanEllis	I'm not exactly sure, to be honest. I need to go though, but I'm sure someone else here knows.
2008-11-13T20:04:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	adam7	Thanks
2008-11-13T20:09:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	adam7	Thanks for all your help
