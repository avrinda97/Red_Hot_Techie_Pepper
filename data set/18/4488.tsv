2009-04-05T04:54:00.000Z	happy-dude		hiya, I have an issue: Swiftweasel will not execute on my computer: http://ompolicy.altervista.org/ubuntu/index.php?dir=intrepid/&file=swiftweasel-3.0.8-intel-pgo_x86_ubuntu.deb
2009-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	happy-dude		can anyone help diagnose my -swiftweasel-not-starting-even-though-installed issue?
2009-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	run it in a terminal
2009-04-05T04:57:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	here is what happens (I installed the deb, so swiftweasel3 command is recognized)
2009-04-05T05:10:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	i'd consider compiling from source. it sounds like a 64/32-bit incompatibility issue... maybe
2009-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	and compiling from source is always faster :D
2009-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	I'm sure I picked the right one (32-bit)
2009-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	uname -a?
2009-04-05T05:12:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	can you try it out yourself? I can't even start the issue [-_-]
2009-04-05T05:12:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	huh?
2009-04-05T05:13:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	what does running "uname -a" give you?
2009-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	Linux Ubuntu 2.6.27-11-generic #1 SMP Thu Jan 29 19:24:39 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux
2009-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	then i'm not sure and the only thing i can think of is compiling from source
2009-04-05T05:18:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	perhaps you can try out the tar files and see if it works -- it certainly isn't for me: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=195473
2009-04-05T05:22:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	by the way, i'm on 64-bit
2009-04-05T05:25:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	runs fine for me
2009-04-05T05:26:00.000Z	raylu	happy-dude	also, they have repos
2009-04-05T07:07:00.000Z	happy-dude	raylu	I'm sorry, I was afk -- my name was called, what was the issue?
