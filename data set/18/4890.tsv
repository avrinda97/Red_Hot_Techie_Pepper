2011-01-03T08:33:00.000Z	trisquel		hi! I wanted to dd over 500GB to mz external drive, did "sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=backup.img"
2011-01-03T08:33:00.000Z	trisquel		it stiopped after 4GB saying file too big
2011-01-03T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	trisquel	Is the enternal drive formatted as FAT?
2011-01-03T08:34:00.000Z	trisquel	Flannel	zes fat32
2011-01-03T08:34:00.000Z	Flannel	trisquel	FAT32 has a 4GB filesize limit
2011-01-03T08:34:00.000Z	trisquel	Flannel	drive has lots of free space, i could reduce partition and create a new one. what file szstem would zou recommend for mz external usb hdd?
2011-01-03T08:36:00.000Z	trisquel	Flannel	I was told ext was preferrable on external drives, dunno why
2011-01-03T08:36:00.000Z	trisquel		what should i use?
2011-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	trisquel	ext3 would work just fine, yeah.
2011-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	trisquel	Also, using dd probably isn't the best way to back stuff up anyway, since any unused space wont be compressed/ignored
2011-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel		!backup | trisquel
2011-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	trisquel	Flannel	thx, itÇs reallz to be fast as IÇm late on it. ThereÇs onlz 100 MB of free space, and I want a one command backup that does all persoanl data, szstem,, /boot, MBR, encrzption, so I guess dd is fine for that. itÇs not meant to be for incremental backups or so, just as i need to hand in my laptop for repair and later want to copy back
2011-01-03T08:40:00.000Z	trisquel		and should be bootable again withou new installation
2011-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	trisquel		Flannel or is it insecure?
2011-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	trisquel	Flannel	would you rather recommend me using ext3 pr ext4?
2011-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	trisquel	Not at all.  Just wasteful, but if its just a small bit, or infrequent, it's fine.  You seem to understand that already.
2011-01-03T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	trisquel	Whichever you'd prefer.  ext3 is supported on more platforms (older ones), but if you're in a well controlled environment, it doesn't matter a whole lot
2011-01-03T08:45:00.000Z	trisquel	Flannel	thank you. you helped me a lot. :D  am repartitioning now.
