2012-08-27T22:47:00.000Z	TaJMoX		Sorry, XORG crashed on me because of ... well what else, graphics problems. If anyone responded to my question about add/edit/remove of Dash applications, please respond again =)
2012-08-27T22:47:00.000Z	TaJMoX		fglrx is the only graphics driver available for me that 'works' ...
2012-08-27T22:47:00.000Z	netmk	TaJMoX	to the side bar?
2012-08-27T22:47:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	no that's easy...
2012-08-27T22:47:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	the dash
2012-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	netmk		oh the dashboard
2012-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	when you press the Dash button and type something
2012-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	netmk		hmm, aren't those just "frequent" apps?
2012-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	TaJMoX		I installed some apps with Wine and some via tar.gz ... there's no way for me to add/edit/remove those netmk
2012-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	I have to launch WhatPulse via terminal every time I start my computer ... that's silly.
2012-08-27T22:49:00.000Z	netmk		try launching it a few times from ALT+F2
2012-08-27T22:49:00.000Z	netmk		(or ALT+F1, dont remember which)
2012-08-27T22:49:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	and yes I know how to edit "start up items" but apparently WhatPulse launches BEFORE the panel so it crashes because it needs panel
2012-08-27T22:49:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	Yeah that works if I run it a FEW times ... seriously...?
2012-08-27T22:50:00.000Z	netmk		if you run it from there a few times, I think you'll see it in the dashboard.
2012-08-27T22:50:00.000Z	netmk		since it becomes a "frequent" app
2012-08-27T22:51:00.000Z	netmk	TaJMoX	if you don't like Unity though, feel free to use another window manager
2012-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	TaJMoX	netmk	I like Unity. Just wondering if I can change an icon really is all I want to do. I want to add "WhatPulse" to the applications. Shouldn't be hard.
