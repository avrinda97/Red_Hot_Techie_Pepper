2006-09-15T16:18:00.000Z	Tonren		Does anyone know exactly what LVM and EVMS are, what they do, and how I know if I'm using them, or need them?
2006-09-15T16:20:00.000Z	vcolombo_	Tonren	afaik lvm is logical volume manager and I don't think Ubuntu (or any flavor thereof) uses it by default.
2006-09-15T16:20:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	Well, EVMS is causing quite a delay on my bootup.  If I only have 4 major partitions on my HD - i.e., no logical partitions - can I remove them from bootup?
2006-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	vcolombo_		Toren: and according to Google EVMS is Eastern Virginia Medical School ;)
2006-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	Oh dear... there's a school on my computer!
2006-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	vcolombo_		Toren: actually it's Enterprise Volume Management System I guess
2006-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	vcolombo_		Toren: do you have raid at all?
2006-09-15T16:21:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	Nope.
2006-09-15T16:22:00.000Z	vcolombo_		Toren: Did you install them manually? I don't think they're installed by default, so if they're installed on your system and you didn't install them manually they may have gotten installed for a reason
2006-09-15T16:23:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	I certainly didn't...
2006-09-15T16:23:00.000Z	vcolombo_	Tonren	Hmmm. Then I'd be a bit leary about removing them just yet
2006-09-15T16:24:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	Hmm.
2006-09-15T16:24:00.000Z	vcolombo_	Tonren	you said you have four partitions?
2006-09-15T16:24:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	Yep, all of 'em primary
2006-09-15T16:25:00.000Z	vcolombo_		tonren: does your system maybe have raid capability that you're just not using?
2006-09-15T16:25:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	I doubt it.  Since when do mid-range laptops have RAID?
2006-09-15T16:26:00.000Z	vcolombo_		tonren: heh, just making sure
2006-09-15T16:26:00.000Z	Tonren	vcolombo_	Hehe
