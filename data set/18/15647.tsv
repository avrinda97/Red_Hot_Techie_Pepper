2005-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	tuananh		hi all, does anyone know how to install an downloaded deb package?
2005-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	Orcrist	tuananh	use dpkg -i packagename.deb
2005-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	tuananh		ok thanks
2005-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	tuananh		let me try
2005-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	tuananh		I thought apt-get is the tool, hence could not figure out how
2005-02-18T14:30:00.000Z	Orcrist		lol apt can install things as well, but it's more of a repository/package tracking/searching/updating/installing tool
2005-02-18T14:30:00.000Z	Orcrist		apt-get rather
2005-02-18T14:31:00.000Z	Orcrist		what's hald?
2005-02-18T14:32:00.000Z	tuananh	Orcrist	I still don't understand what is the boundary between apt and dpkg
2005-02-18T14:32:00.000Z	Orcrist	tuananh	they're different programs
2005-02-18T14:33:00.000Z	Orcrist		there are probably 5 different ways to install programs with debian... dpkg, dselect, apt, apt-get, aptitude, synaptic
2005-02-18T14:33:00.000Z	Orcrist		apt/apt-get are dpkg extensions
2005-02-18T14:33:00.000Z	Orcrist		but can be run separately
2005-02-18T14:33:00.000Z	Orcrist		yeah, waht jim said
2005-02-18T14:33:00.000Z	tuananh		isn't it confusing :)
2005-02-18T14:34:00.000Z	tuananh		yeah
2005-02-18T14:34:00.000Z	tuananh		after so long now I found Ubuntu
2005-02-18T14:34:00.000Z	Orcrist	tuananh	synaptic is a program that can handle just about all that... it's a frontend in your desktop... very nice
