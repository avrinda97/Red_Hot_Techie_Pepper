2008-06-02T09:56:00.000Z	neohaven		on a stock Ubuntu 8.04 (64-bit) LTS Machine, where is the OpenSSH server found?
2008-06-02T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	It isn't.  You'd have to install it
2008-06-02T09:57:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	then why isn't it in the "add/remove" app?
2008-06-02T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	No idea?  Its not somethign normal desktop users want.  You want the openssh-server package
2008-06-02T09:58:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	a search for openssh, ssh, or sshd doesn't return anything except clients.
2008-06-02T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	Are you connected to the internet?
2008-06-02T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	Have you hit "update"?
2008-06-02T09:59:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	Update? in the Add/Remove app?
2008-06-02T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	no, in Synaptic
2008-06-02T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	system > admin > synaptic package manager
2008-06-02T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	Add/Remvoe is just a tiny fraction of the stuff you can install
2008-06-02T10:00:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	then I probably will find openssh in Synaptic... but why have 2 distinct apps?
2008-06-02T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	Because the server and the client are different
2008-06-02T10:02:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	not what I meant. What is the purpose of having 2 different apps managing packages? Both Synaptic and the Add/Remove one?
2008-06-02T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	Add/Remove is dumbed down, its simplfiied so if you don't know the name of something, you can find it (and it only shows the stuff most people find interesting), Synaptic is everything (not just apps, but libs, etc, etc)
2008-06-02T10:03:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	Meh, I probably would have implemented a menu option with "Advanced..." or something, but ok, I get that. :)
2008-06-02T10:03:00.000Z	Flannel	neohaven	Add/remvoe is a custom app for Ubuntu, Synaptic is a stadnard one
2008-06-02T10:04:00.000Z	neohaven	Flannel	ok :)
