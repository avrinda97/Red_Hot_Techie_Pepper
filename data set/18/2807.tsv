2010-02-15T17:44:00.000Z	Mateo_		hi everyone !
2010-02-15T17:45:00.000Z	Mateo_		i was wondering if it is possible to simulate a domain name, and replace localhost/ by mysite.com/  , with an alias by exemple i don't know
2010-02-15T17:46:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	You could add "mysite.com" after "localhost" in your "/etc/hosts" file - just remember to switch it back later
2010-02-15T17:47:00.000Z	Mateo_	dawning	and it would do the trick without anything else ? if i type mysite.com  as a url, i will browse through the site that is in my localhost ?
2010-02-15T17:48:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	That'd only apply to your workstation, the first place the system looks for a domain name when resolving it is that file, so you can override stuff there
2010-02-15T17:49:00.000Z	Mateo_	dawning	yep, i only need this for my computer
2010-02-15T17:49:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	So give it a try, it'll work, unless you screw it up :)
2010-02-15T17:51:00.000Z	Mateo_	dawning	yep i need to try :)  and if i want to add an alias to another folder ? like localhost/mysite ?
2010-02-15T17:52:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	What I've told you only applies to domain names.
2010-02-15T17:52:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	so, in "http://clownpr0n.com/wrinkles" - the domain name is "clownpr0n.com"
2010-02-15T17:55:00.000Z	Mateo_	dawning	and is it possible to make it work to the whole domain ? like when i type mysite.com/wrinkles  it browses to localhost/wrinkles ?
2010-02-15T17:56:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	"whole domain"? The domain ends at the TLD, in this case ".com". Are you using Apache as your webserver?
2010-02-15T17:57:00.000Z	Mateo_	dawning	yep i'm using apache.  maybe i have to explain myself better... i would like to fake mysite.com to mirror localhost/ ONLY on my computer
2010-02-15T17:58:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	K, so try what I told ya right from the start. Just add "mysite.com" or whatever the domain you're overriding the IP address of in your "/etc/hosts" file
2010-02-15T17:59:00.000Z	Mateo_	dawning	ok, thanks, i will give it a try
2010-02-15T17:59:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	You can verify it's working by pinging that domain.
2010-02-15T17:59:00.000Z	Mateo_		thanks for your help !
2010-02-15T17:59:00.000Z	dawning	Mateo_	You're welcome, have fun
