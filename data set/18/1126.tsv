2011-05-22T01:36:00.000Z	MK44		im trying to install the wifi drivers in 11.04 and following the tutorial at http://bit.ly/iXGWEt but im stuck at step 5. "Run Administration -> Update manager" where is Administration on 11.04??
2011-05-22T01:36:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	run it through the menu.  It will ask for a password.  After entering the password you are on 'administrator'  in the linux world it is called root
2011-05-22T01:37:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	which menu do I run it through sorry?
2011-05-22T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	system -> admin
2011-05-22T01:38:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	Are you on 11.04  ??  Then it's in the unity bar
2011-05-22T01:38:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	yes im runing 11.04, so I click on the ubuntu icon to get system??
2011-05-22T01:39:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	ignore the system thing.  That's for 10.10 and down.  In 11.04 the update manager is on the left side (the unity bar) and it looks like a box with an orange arrow
2011-05-22T01:40:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	thanks, and in the tutorial step 7 you must go to "7. Highlight Administration -> Hardware Drivers" where do i find this?
2011-05-22T01:41:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	Upper left corner.  Power button -> system settings -> additional drivers
2011-05-22T01:42:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	thanks!
2011-05-22T01:42:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	sure
2011-05-22T01:44:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	when I open "additional drivers" nothing shows up in the list...
2011-05-22T01:45:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	That means that there are no proprietary drivers available for any of the hardware on your system.  Is your wifi kill switch on?  Perhaps the OS just didn't see your wifi card cause the switch was set to off.
2011-05-22T01:46:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	no the light is on for the wifi driver. I have also installed "Wifi Radar" in the past, but it does not connect to any networks (Ive tested it on a few working networks" it tries to detect the dhcp settings, and sticks on the loading bar
2011-05-22T01:47:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	Then I suspect your wifi card does not have any proprietary drivers written for linux
2011-05-22T01:47:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	it worked in 10.10! im running acer aspire one netbook
2011-05-22T01:48:00.000Z	edbian	MK44	There are probably open source drivers
2011-05-22T01:48:00.000Z	MK44	edbian	what do you reccomend for getting the wifi to work? im seriously considering switching back to 10.04 LTS
