2006-08-28T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 its a iso image youy burn to cd and boot.. use a tool like 'burn at once' to burn it. the just reboot with it in the hd.
2006-08-28T14:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 your use of the term 'extract' is confuseing.. what do you mean extract?
2006-08-28T14:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 a message under windows pops up?
2006-08-28T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 there are some GPL windows apps on the cd.. but you REBOOT with the cd in the drive to install the OS.
2006-08-28T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 if you burnt it correctly.
2006-08-28T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 you do NOT use winrar, you do NOT extract it.. you use a tool like 'burn at once' to burn it to a cdrom
2006-08-28T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 or some other cd burning tool.
2006-08-28T14:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Computerex	 if you just burnt the FIles to a cdrom with window's tools - it dident do it right.
