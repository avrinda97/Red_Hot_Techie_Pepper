2009-01-28T05:27:00.000Z	geoffrian		can anyone help with a technical problem?
2009-01-28T05:28:00.000Z	geoffrian		I have a Via processor in my netbook which has 1.2Ghz, but Ubuntu only uses 599Mhz and says its 100%
2009-01-28T05:29:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	try cat /proc/cpuinfo and see what it says there
2009-01-28T05:31:00.000Z	geoffrian		I did that.  It said 599Mhz
2009-01-28T05:32:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	And you're bios info also says 1.2GHz or 599MHz?
2009-01-28T05:34:00.000Z	geoffrian		The BIOS says that it is a 1.2Ghz processor along with the Gnome System Monitor, but typing that code into the terminal says 599.8Mhz
2009-01-28T05:35:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	I am thinking it was just a fluke
2009-01-28T05:36:00.000Z	geoffrian		The gnome applet CPU Freq Scaling Monitor says 599Mhz.  That is when I first discovered it
2009-01-28T05:38:00.000Z	geoffrian	JesperHansen	It's confusing why Ubuntu doesn't use the full power.
2009-01-28T05:39:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	does the Via processor scale speed?
2009-01-28T05:39:00.000Z	geoffrian		The Via website says it does.
2009-01-28T05:39:00.000Z	geoffrian		Ubuntu does not support it though, or I have the wrong kernel.
2009-01-28T05:41:00.000Z	geoffrian	JesperHansen	Maybe there is a system library I need or a different kernel or something else...?
2009-01-28T05:42:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	uhmmm... can you pastebin your entire cpuinfo?
2009-01-28T05:43:00.000Z	geoffrian		Sure.  I'll IM you.
2009-01-28T05:45:00.000Z	geoffrian	JesperHansen	Did you get it?
2009-01-28T05:46:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	yes, left a comment
2009-01-28T05:46:00.000Z	JesperHansen	geoffrian	gotta check something though with my statement
