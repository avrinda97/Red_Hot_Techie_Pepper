2012-01-27T16:37:00.000Z	daschel		I'm getting fed up with ubuntu support.  I've only had 5 problems/questions over the last two years that I've had to post to support forums or irc channels.  It seems that anything not quickly solvable by searching google gets ignored.  A simple, "I'm stumped" would suffice, but when I say I've tried their solution already or that it didn't work, I'm met by silence.  It's unprofessional and off putting.
2012-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	well keep in mind the support here and in the forums is just users like trying to help one another.  And on irc, if you don't get an answer, that means no one knows
2012-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	like you*
2012-01-27T16:40:00.000Z	daschel	jrib	fair enough.  Just needed to vent some frustrations.
2012-01-27T16:41:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	yeah, I understand sometimes it is frustrating to not get feedback on irc with so many users, but it's really not feasible to have everyone answer "I don't know" to a question if they don't know.  In any case, what's your question/issue? :)
2012-01-27T16:44:00.000Z	daschel	jrib	I'm trying to remove the key bindings from alt+[left click].  I've tried CCSM and gconftool, but neither have worked.
2012-01-27T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	what does it currently do?
2012-01-27T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	you're using unity?
2012-01-27T16:46:00.000Z	daschel	jrib	gnome3
2012-01-27T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	gnome-shell?
2012-01-27T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	with mutter as window manager?
2012-01-27T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	hmm, so what window manager?
2012-01-27T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	according to wikipedia gnome-shell uses mutter as the window manager but I've never used gnome-shell
2012-01-27T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	alt-left-click doesn't affect windows for me; I do think it's a window manager feature
2012-01-27T16:54:00.000Z	daschel	jrib	I misunderstood you.  I was thinking 'file manager' instead of windows manager.  if mutter is the default windows manager, then that's what I'm using.  I know I haven't changed anything in that regard
2012-01-27T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	daschel	ok, well in that case we need to figure out how to configure mutter :P
2012-01-27T16:57:00.000Z	daschel	jrib	thanks.  I'm going to install the Xorg software updates and restart in case metaspike is right.   If not I'll do some digging around on mutter, and let you help others. I should be able to take it from here.  I just needed a starting point.  Thanks for your help
2012-01-27T17:02:00.000Z	daschel	jrib	good news and badnews.  alt-left no longer moves windows but now my wacom tablet isn't recognized :)
