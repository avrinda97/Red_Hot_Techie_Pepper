2008-03-14T02:06:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	Plug cable modem into wan port.  plug computer into lan port.  and use the web browser to goto the default gateway address
2008-03-14T02:07:00.000Z	TrueNme		i have on windows and it works fine
2008-03-14T02:07:00.000Z	TrueNme	ubuntu	dont even give me lights on my router
2008-03-14T02:07:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	Then I would think its a network driver issue
2008-03-14T02:08:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	Are you running desktop or server?
2008-03-14T02:08:00.000Z	TrueNme		desktop
2008-03-14T02:08:00.000Z	TrueNme		no
2008-03-14T02:08:00.000Z	TrueNme		i cant do anything network related
2008-03-14T02:09:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	I'm going to guess its because Ubuntu didn't load the network card driver for whatever reason (doesn't have it, not supported, some other error)
2008-03-14T02:09:00.000Z	TrueNme		°~° triorieel °~° ok how do i download it and install it on linux
2008-03-14T02:09:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	I honestly don't know...I myself would scrounge around on the net to see if that nic is supported or throw another nic in the machine
2008-03-14T02:10:00.000Z	TrueNme		°~° triorieel °~° ok once i get the driver how do i install it ?
2008-03-14T02:10:00.000Z	TrueNme		°~° amenado °~° if i use eth0 yes
2008-03-14T02:10:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	Chances are, if its a popular nic...its supported.  And the install directions for the driver should come with it
2008-03-14T02:11:00.000Z	triorieel	TrueNme	anything more then that, and you will have to ask someone else for assistance
