2007-03-25T05:43:00.000Z	rickyfingers	comlag	what I'm thinking is the way you bring gnome-desktop all the way down is sudo /etc/initid/gdm stop
2007-03-25T05:44:00.000Z	rickyfingers	comlag	so those /etc/init.d/ files get executed at start up, so if you just move it out of there, gnome-desktop will never start, and there you go.
2007-03-25T05:46:00.000Z	rickyfingers	comlag	what I said will give you that then you just type startx after logging in...you'll be good to go.
2007-03-25T05:46:00.000Z	comlag	rickyfingers	is there any way to just have it "startx" after i login?
2007-03-25T05:48:00.000Z	rickyfingers	comlag	I'm thinking, it would go in something like the ~/.bashrc file, but I'm not sure that's where you want it, because it'll run startx every time you start another instance of bash
2007-03-25T05:49:00.000Z	rickyfingers	comlag	looking at the man page real fast, I'd say you'd want to put startx in the last line of ~/.bash-login
2007-03-25T05:49:00.000Z	rickyfingers	comlag	excuse me, I meant ~/.bash_login - underscore not a hyphen
