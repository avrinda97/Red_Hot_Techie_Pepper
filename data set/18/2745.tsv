2011-10-31T07:02:00.000Z	DarkStar1		hi guys. \i know this isn't the channel for it but I thought \i'd ask for a professional opinion anyways. Of the versioning tools which is the easiest to use? (CVS, Git, Mercurial or subversion) I've never used any such tool before.  Or can someone direct me to a comparison site between git, subversion, cvs and mercurial. Thanks
2011-10-31T07:03:00.000Z	DarkStar1		I'm uding netbeans andI'm trying to decide which of the four to use
2011-10-31T07:04:00.000Z	_r00t_	DarkStar1	ouch ! You could start a flame with that one .... I've used all of them and still get laughed at for using SVN and CVS
2011-10-31T07:09:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	which would you recommend I use? I've decided I'm going to commit to using netbeans dev IDE and it comes with all 4
2011-10-31T07:10:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	 but it will also have t be something that I can scale up for use by a team of say 5 devs

2011-10-31T07:12:00.000Z	_r00t_	DarkStar1	what's the project language
2011-10-31T07:12:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	I tried that on a linux install and it gave me no end of problems. vbox was a breeze so I stuckk with vbox

2011-10-31T07:14:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	I am a virtualisation amateur
2011-10-31T07:20:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	tbh last time I tried installing a vmware guest ( January I think) It gave me no end of problems. in the end I just dumped it and went vbox route
2011-10-31T07:22:00.000Z	_r00t_	DarkStar1	I used vmware from 1999 till 2004ish or whenever vbox came around. I've dumped vbox a couple of weeks back in favour of vmware. Decent vt-x and software acceleration. Vbox has lagged behind over the years
2011-10-31T07:25:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	 I'n any case I have to experiment with hyper-virtualisation soon. but I think for destop virtualisation in the home vbox rules. Especially since I just want an easy install process with the vm-ware headache
2011-10-31T07:26:00.000Z	_r00t_	DarkStar1	Hyper-V is a windows thing ... I'm not longer your friend :)
2011-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	sorry I meant type 1 virtualisation
2011-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	I wuldn't touch MS stuff for server side stuff
2011-10-31T07:28:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	 Or what ever it is called when you virtualise hardware without the need for host Os
2011-10-31T07:30:00.000Z	DarkStar1	_r00t_	for that I hear I have to go back to vmware. This is something I'm dreading given my install experience so far :)
