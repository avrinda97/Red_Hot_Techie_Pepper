2007-08-07T12:18:00.000Z	mattgyver83		has anybody here been able to make vnc connections from Windows to Linux?
2007-08-07T12:20:00.000Z	mattgyver83		I can make connections from Windows to Windows, and Linux to windows... but when i try to go from windows to linux i just get a terminal type screen
2007-08-07T12:21:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	what kind of connection? samba?
2007-08-07T12:21:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	or ssh/telnet
2007-08-07T12:21:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	ok, so probably samba then. you mean to view files like they were local to the machine?
2007-08-07T12:22:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	ahha
2007-08-07T12:22:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	you are probably using vnc then
2007-08-07T12:23:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	you should make sure that the programs you are using are all compatible, also, make sure compiz/beryl is not running on the linux box as they are generally not compatible with vnc
2007-08-07T12:23:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	you can also try ms terminal services, that is quite efficient and there is free software support for it in ubuntu although the server is not there to be set up by default afaik
2007-08-07T12:24:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	tightvnc is good, are the port settings on the server and clients all the same?
2007-08-07T12:24:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	and also the server(s) are set to accept incoming connections
2007-08-07T12:25:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	maybe you set it wrongly on one of them?
2007-08-07T12:25:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	you should be able to, take a look at the command line options
2007-08-07T12:25:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	you are using xvnc yes?
2007-08-07T12:26:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	which is it that wont connect?
2007-08-07T12:27:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	yes, i gatherd that. best to get rid of all the possibilities though
2007-08-07T12:27:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	i did say, disable beryl and compiz :)
2007-08-07T12:28:00.000Z	variant	mattgyver83	:) glad you fixed it
