2005-01-15T12:50:00.000Z	skreet		:D
2005-01-15T12:52:00.000Z	skreet		Man this is such a hard decision.
2005-01-15T12:52:00.000Z	skreet		I love linux, but I love gaming.
2005-01-15T12:52:00.000Z	skreet		And uh.. I cant have the best on both.
2005-01-15T12:52:00.000Z	xed	skreet	dual boot.
2005-01-15T12:53:00.000Z	skreet	xed	Yes, but I dont like shutting down.
2005-01-15T12:53:00.000Z	xed	skreet	I have the same issue, so I've given up gaming.
2005-01-15T12:53:00.000Z	skreet		Also, for some reason when I have a linux desktop with firefox, gaim and mplayer, and i have a windows desktop with WoW, CS:S, Half Life 2, gaim, firefox and Media Player Classic... I really dont feel like waiting 7 minutes to go online.
2005-01-15T12:53:00.000Z	skreet		All the software I use on linux is available for windows and I keep on my windows desktops as well
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	skreet		So I *never* go back.
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	skreet		:P
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	xed	skreet	why go linux at all then?
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	skreet		I like the console.
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	skreet		:D
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	xed		..
2005-01-15T12:54:00.000Z	skreet		Powerful.
2005-01-15T12:55:00.000Z	xed	skreet	lacking power elsewhere? =P
