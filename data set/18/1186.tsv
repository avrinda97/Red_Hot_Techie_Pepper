2011-05-04T14:47:00.000Z	Blackflowers		Hi, I am looking for user input, I have been using fedora linux the last couple of days and have had nothing but lock-ups have to manually go out and reset the computer and nobody seems to be able to help me, I am curious is ubuntu support more reliable? I've got a computer that I have been trying to get setup for weeks now. Althought it does have some additional hardware which may not be supported by linux.
2011-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	Blackflowers		It freezes up, typically under wine that I noticed but then it froze up under gkrellm, a friend said that it could be video related.
2011-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	What was installed on the box before Linux?
2011-05-04T14:49:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	Did it lock up in Win 7/
2011-05-04T14:50:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	So it doesn't sound like a HardWare issue
2011-05-04T14:50:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	It sounds like a driver issue
2011-05-04T14:50:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	Maybe a video card?
2011-05-04T14:51:00.000Z	Blackflowers	chrisbster	: It had onboard video ati 4200 hd
2011-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	Next time you lock up, see if you can punch  ctrl-alt-shift F2
2011-05-04T14:55:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	If that works, it means X (The graphics rendering program) is frozen, but your hardware is fine
2011-05-04T14:56:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	To back back to your frozen screen, press CTRL-ALT-F7
2011-05-04T14:56:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	The command I gave you will get you to a terminal
2011-05-04T14:57:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	if that works, all hope is not lost
2011-05-04T14:57:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	come back here, and we can probably sort you out, just tell them you have an issue with X locking up
2011-05-04T14:58:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	If it doesn't, it means you either have an issue with memory or your HD that windows isn't noticing yet
2011-05-04T14:59:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	I don't want to dig around yet until we figure out which one it is
2011-05-04T15:00:00.000Z	Blackflowers	chrisbster	well Fedora wasn't my choice I let someone talk me into it and they promised they would help and now I just want to choke them, Ubuntu was my original but like always I let someone convince me what to run.
2011-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	chrisbster	Blackflowers	I really am sorry BlackFlowers, I prefer Ubuntu build to the Fedora one anyways
