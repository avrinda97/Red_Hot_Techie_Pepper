2007-03-17T06:39:00.000Z	brando		is there another install method
2007-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	brando		cant access tty; job control turned off
2007-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	brando		on initial boot
2007-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	brando		thx for the help
2007-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	brando	the o/s didn't come up fully into multiuser mode
2007-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	brando	any error messages?  run dmesg, look for something helpful
2007-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	brando		no multiuser mode
2007-03-17T06:41:00.000Z	brando		i have (initramfs) up right now
2007-03-17T06:41:00.000Z	brando		gets there every time
2007-03-17T06:41:00.000Z	sethk	brando	this is seen when using the busybox shell; that in turn happens when boot up doesn't complete normally
2007-03-17T06:43:00.000Z	brando		maybe this will help.   cp: unable to open'/root/var/log/' no such file than it tries to mount 3x and fails
2007-03-17T06:44:00.000Z	sethk	brando	it's all part of the same problem.  The failure to mount /var/log isn't the cause, though.  The cause will be much earlier
2007-03-17T06:44:00.000Z	sethk	brando	can you paste the dmesg output to the paste web site?
2007-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	brando	sethk	pls hold my hand quick on this
2007-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	sethk	brando	you can capture dmesg output to a file, as follows:      dmesg > filename
2007-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	brando		ok
2007-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	sethk	brando	then, hopefully, you can get that file onto a machine where you can edit the file, and copy and paste into your browser to put it up on the paste site.
2007-03-17T06:46:00.000Z	sethk	brando	the paste site URL is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org, I believe
