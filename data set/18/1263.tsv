2011-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	jam2011		I was formatting my existing ubuntu 10.04 and doing a fresh install (last time it was an upgrade) . I am run into a problem. I got the message "Unable to install grub in /dev/sda".. I selected the option of continuing without a bootloader option...Now I need to mannually install the bootloader.. how do I do it?
2011-04-17T12:51:00.000Z	jam2011		how can I manually install a bootloader in ubuntu
2011-04-17T12:52:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	you can't if you can't boot into ubuntu...you'll have to boot into another system if you have dual/multi-boot
2011-04-17T12:53:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	I do not have dual boot
2011-04-17T12:57:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	I have the installation CD. do you think I can manually install the boot loader from the installation CD
2011-04-17T12:58:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
2011-04-17T12:58:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	thanks
2011-04-17T13:03:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	I was checking the version of grub on my machine and it says GNU GRUB 1.98-1ubuntu10.
2011-04-17T13:09:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	Neither can I find menu.lst nor grub.cfg when I mount the hard drive from the install CD
2011-04-17T13:10:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	did you try the steps on the web page listed above?
2011-04-17T13:11:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	I was trying the steps in the website. One of the steps was to "Go into boot/grub directory and check for the existence of the files menu.lst and grub.cfg.   "
2011-04-17T13:11:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	ok, and which /boot/grub dir did you try? the live cd or your installed partition?
2011-04-17T13:12:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	installed partition
2011-04-17T13:13:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	remind me again - did you install grub before?
2011-04-17T13:14:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	I had been using this version of ubuntu for some time now. I wanted to do a fresh install. So I formatted the whole disk from the installation CD..
2011-04-17T13:17:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	and when you installed afresh, did you not install grub?
2011-04-17T13:18:00.000Z	jam2011	dEhiN	Thats when I got a fatal error. so I had to skip the grubn installation
2011-04-17T13:19:00.000Z	dEhiN	jam2011	then in that case, ignore steps in the web page instructions relating to previous grub installations...you don't have a previous install, so there would be no /boot/grub menu
