2008-02-18T13:34:00.000Z	Shay2		Hi, does anyone know how to get hp pavillion dv2745se's wireless driver to work on ubuntu
2008-02-18T13:35:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	Better if you find out what chipset that computer uses for wireless
2008-02-18T13:38:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	You want to seach for broadcom ubuntu wireless .. should be some forums for that what release are you using?
2008-02-18T13:39:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	already tried ndiswrapper ...hmm..
2008-02-18T13:40:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	good question
2008-02-18T13:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	could have rebooted without proper close down from win
2008-02-18T13:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	I haven't used my wireless card in a while so I haven't had to mess with it
2008-02-18T13:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	Maybe it is the access point
2008-02-18T13:42:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	I mean when you were asking fbern if he was dual-booting
2008-02-18T13:43:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	is there another wireless manager you can use? I remember using a different wireless manager when I had to use my card
2008-02-18T13:43:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	Oh... yah I remember something about having to set up the restricted-manager too.... hmmm
2008-02-18T13:44:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	I don't think it has to do with that, i think it is a header file or something.. been a long time
2008-02-18T13:49:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	Im sure there is a way to get it to work.. what is the access point config yo are trying to connect to
2008-02-18T13:50:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	But what type of encryption are you using
2008-02-18T13:50:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	do you have option for wpa?
2008-02-18T13:51:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	For some odd reason my brain is telling me I had better luck with WPA than with wep..ie.. I could only connect when using wpa
2008-02-18T13:51:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	Im saying maybe the wireless is working but not able to connect cause its wep
2008-02-18T13:53:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Shay2	oh ha.. i gotta reboot brb hopefully!
