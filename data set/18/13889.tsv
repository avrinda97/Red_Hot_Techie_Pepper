2010-02-16T07:49:00.000Z	unperson		A related question:  Is it possible to use, say, an external drive for swap (I would think so), and if so, any idea what would happen should that disk be absent at boot?
2010-02-16T07:50:00.000Z	grndslm	unperson	external drive = bad idea, for usb is slow
2010-02-16T07:50:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	Yes, I agree with you as a general matter.
2010-02-16T07:51:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I'm debating what to do with my eeepc 4G.  It has 2 GB of RAM and only 4 GB of internal SSD storage.  I was thinking of using an SD card for swap.
2010-02-16T07:52:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I don't actually know about how the throughput to each of those compares on the eee (obviously depends in part on the SD card).
2010-02-16T07:52:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I suspect you're right that it would be a bad idea in any case.
2010-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	grndslm	unperson	go with out it!  just reboot when necessary... like right-click the panel and add the system monitor... right click that and enable the "memory, swap, network, disk, etc." graphs
2010-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	grndslm	unperson	is hibernating really necessary when you've got an ssd?
2010-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I think it would be faster than the boot process (which may limited by the CPU rather than the storage speed).
2010-02-16T08:01:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I don't know how the boot speed for UNR would compare to the speed of resuming from hibernation.  I guess ideally I'd like to install such that I can try out both options, so I'm trying to figure out what would be the best way to enable hibernation.
2010-02-16T08:03:00.000Z	grndslm	unperson	gotcha... i wouldn't even be using UNR... so we clearly have different tastes -_-
2010-02-16T08:07:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	Perhaps.  The thing is that the eee has a) a slow CPU, b) a very small screen, and c) not much internal storage space, so it seems that an OS that takes those limitations into account is desirable.
2010-02-16T08:07:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	Point b) is sometimes the biggest problem, strangely.
2010-02-16T08:12:00.000Z	grndslm	unperson	right... i'd buy a $100-130 SSD (30-60gb OCZ with rebates) and drop that in there.... reinstall real ubuntu... and if you have issues with the lesser pixels (screen res), you can always *hold* ALT + CLICK anywhere on the window and DRAG with mouse whenever you'd like!
2010-02-16T08:12:00.000Z	grndslm	unperson	the screen res is the reason a netbook + windows are no fun.... but on linux, you can drag windows around by holding alt, and clicking anywhere in the window to drag... very nice! :)
2010-02-16T08:13:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	Yeah. I know about the alt key thing, but that gets old fast, trust me.
2010-02-16T08:13:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I mean, if it's a dialog in an app you use often.
2010-02-16T08:19:00.000Z	unperson	grndslm	I do agree that the problem is VASTLY better with ALT for move.  Having not used Windows in years now, I can't comment on how it does in that regard.
