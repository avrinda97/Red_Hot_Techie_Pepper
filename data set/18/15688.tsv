2005-02-17T15:05:00.000Z	CreeVal		Anyone who can help me with automounting an NTFS volume? Ive added the line found on www.ubuntuguide.org , but when booting it says that special device /dev/sda1 does not excist... Wich it does because i can mount it when i enter gnome desktop... Any ideas?
2005-02-17T15:06:00.000Z	syn-ack	CreeVal	Yeah, like Im sure the manual on line states, do you have a SCSI device installed?
2005-02-17T15:06:00.000Z	CreeVal		Yeah its a SATA drive...
2005-02-17T15:06:00.000Z	syn-ack		are the sATA drivers installed, CreeVal
2005-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	CreeVal		Yes... Because i can mount it in gnome desktop... But not "premount" it...
2005-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	syn-ack		So you are having issues with /etc/fstab
2005-02-17T15:08:00.000Z	CreeVal		Yeah...
