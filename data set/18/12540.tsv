2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		well, I installed the NIS server
2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		and I need the solaris NIS clients to work with it
2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		and from what I can tell, md5 is my problem.
2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		although not sure.
2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		I can run 'ypcat hosts' and stuff just fine.
2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		but I can't log into the solaris machines.
2006-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	brasko		so, I want to try disabling the md5 passwords
2006-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	brasko		http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.solaris/browse_thread/thread/ee651f24b5ae0ad9/f15b30cf40cd11b7?lnk=st&q=nis+login+solaris+client+linux+server&rnum=1&hl=en#f15b30cf40cd11b7
2006-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	brasko		That's what this person had to do.
2006-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	brasko		So, anyone know how to disable md5 passwords on ubuntu?
2006-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	iegary	brasko	dpkg-reconfigure passwd
2006-04-24T09:08:00.000Z	brasko	iegary	thanks.
2006-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	brasko	iegary	hmmm, it didn't ask me about md5
2006-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	brasko	iegary	Do I have to update the verbosity somehow?
2006-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	brasko	iegary	it only asked me about the shadow passworsd
2006-04-24T09:18:00.000Z	iegary	brasko	oops :) Okay, try removing 'md5' from the end of one of the lines in /etc/pam.d/common-password
2006-04-24T09:18:00.000Z	iegary	brasko	but make sure to reset your password before logging out, so you set a new DES password
2006-04-24T09:21:00.000Z	iegary	brasko	i.e. if you log out when your password entry still starts with $1$, you won't be able to log back in.
