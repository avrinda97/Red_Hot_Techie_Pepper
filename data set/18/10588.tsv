2008-12-22T21:32:00.000Z	nblracer		need some help, i\mounting a raid; it is a hardware base promise fastrack tx2000, the os is on another drive
2008-12-22T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	the way I'm reading the info on your device it is a windows fakeraid device
2008-12-22T21:32:00.000Z	nblracer		i would like to mount it as read only, btw
2008-12-22T21:33:00.000Z	nblracer	ikonia	meaning? i saw that there was linux drivers
2008-12-22T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	the device is classed as a "fake raid" controller from teh documents I'm reading, there are linux drivers but they are VERY old and don't look compatible with modern kernels from what I'm reading
2008-12-22T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	I'm just reading a little more on them now
2008-12-22T21:34:00.000Z	nblracer	ikonia	 thanks; ubuntu seems to see the hardware fine each drive.partition, just not as a single raid disk
2008-12-22T21:35:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	I've just read on teh release notes that the drivers are only for the 2.4 kernel so the fake raid setup from your windows build won't be visable
2008-12-22T21:35:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	it also appears that the drivers for linux where very bad anyway even if they where usable in a 2.6 kernel
2008-12-22T21:37:00.000Z	nblracer	ikonia	 is there any work around, should i down grade kernels, an Open source software drivers that can be used
2008-12-22T21:37:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	don't downgrade the kernel, a 2.4 kernel won't work and open soruce software won't work on it
2008-12-22T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	there are notes of using the 2.6 kernel to get a fake raid array built but it has to be assembled from scratch (wiping the disks) and doesn't seem to support rebuilding existing arrays
2008-12-22T21:38:00.000Z	nblracer	ikonia	or is my best bet to part ion my drive and install win Xp on it?
2008-12-22T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	I don't know how that card works in windows, but I it seems a better option than linux
2008-12-22T21:40:00.000Z	nblracer	ikonia	last question, you have been a great help; will a bootable version of Windows like BartPe see the raid
2008-12-22T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	no idea
2008-12-22T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	I suspect not
2008-12-22T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	nblracer	the guys in ##windows may help better than that
