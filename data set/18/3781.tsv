2010-01-25T03:07:00.000Z	nagle		hi: I am trying to delete a partition from ubuntu, and I can't see it via gparted or df -h. Any ideas for how to find it / delete it?
2010-01-25T03:08:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	hmm.. gparted doesn't usually miss partitions... you sure it's not there? you've looked at the right hard drive?
2010-01-25T03:10:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	I'm sure. I made the partition in Windows XP -- I don't know if somehow that would be invisible to ubuntu?
2010-01-25T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	I doubt it.. if you boot into windows can you see the partition there?
2010-01-25T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	can you create a screenshot with the gparted window?
2010-01-25T03:12:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	I can't boot into Windows anymore, hence wanting to delete it.
2010-01-25T03:19:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	I'll try. I wanted to delete the windows partition cause I'm out of space on my ubuntu partition ... and it's tricky right now to make room! Should be able to figure this out, but it may be a few min.
2010-01-25T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	no worries

2010-01-25T03:35:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	ok.. so you've got one hard drive.. 37 GB? odd size... ntfs ... /boot /host? are you running wubi?
2010-01-25T03:36:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	Is /boot, or /host? a question?
2010-01-25T03:36:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	I did install ubuntu via wubi from XP.
2010-01-25T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	just me talking to myself =)  .. I have no idea how wubi does it's thing or if it's even possible to remove the windows partition that you used for the wubi install
2010-01-25T03:38:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	Ah! =). Mmm. Yeah ... strange it doesn't show up, eh?
2010-01-25T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	I'm not sure how wubi does it's think but it looks like it's running in some kind of virtual space.. ie it doesn't see the real hardware
2010-01-25T03:41:00.000Z	nagle	Slart	Ah! wubi's faq says that ubuntu is installed within a file on windows.
2010-01-25T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	yup.. that sounds like what I've heard
2010-01-25T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	nagle	I can't really help you any further with this as I have to get to bed. Ask the channel again
