2006-10-21T07:09:00.000Z	black_13		ok this is a stretch but can rpms be installed on ubuntu
2006-10-21T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	not recommended
2007-01-19T15:09:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	it's open by default
2007-03-25T15:42:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	yes, you should be able to view avi's after following the steps in the wiki.  Note that avi is only a container format
2007-03-25T15:43:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	yeah i am worried about avi's that is im worried that i would be able to find the needed codec
2007-03-25T15:44:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	does it still not work after following the wiki page?
2007-03-25T15:44:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	would you mind if we spoke privately
2007-03-25T15:44:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	here is better
2007-03-25T15:45:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	i dont know if this channel frowns on torrents of tv shows
2007-03-25T15:46:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	im download the avi now
2007-03-25T15:46:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	so i havent tried it yet
2007-03-25T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	ok
2012-10-03T19:18:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	try #kubuntu to see if they know the "right" way.  But if you just want it off and don't care how, use xset
2012-10-03T19:18:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	would it be "xset s off"
2012-10-03T19:19:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	maybe.  It may also be dpms settings
2012-10-03T19:20:00.000Z	black_13	jrib	here is what i found http://www.shellperson.net/prevent-screen-blanking/
2012-10-03T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	black_13	yes, that's good information
