2007-05-25T12:03:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	i think that it is.
2007-05-25T12:05:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	nope. primary
2007-05-25T12:06:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	or well..
2007-05-25T12:06:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	isn't primary used only when you use extended partitions?
2007-05-25T12:06:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	*logical
2007-05-25T12:06:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	why would you create an extended partition if you have enough spaces for primaries?
2007-05-25T12:07:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	aw.. I don't know about that.. But what's your problem?
2007-05-25T12:08:00.000Z	habeeb	und3ad	I'm not sure. Sorry.
