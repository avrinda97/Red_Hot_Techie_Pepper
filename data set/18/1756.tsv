2011-01-13T21:40:00.000Z	bencahill		hey guys, could i write a script to ignore middle click duplicates?
2011-01-13T21:42:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	That would be really hard unless you modified the mouse driver.  If you stay out of the driver you'd have to figure out what the double click did and then undo it everytime.
2011-01-13T21:43:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	The problem is that the mouse has a hardware problem, and unless you are very very careful when middle-clicking, you will often get two or three clicks almost instantly (I only middle-click in ff, so it only really needs to be fixed for that)
2011-01-13T21:44:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	Can you change the settings in System -> Preferences for double click speed?  Will that help?
2011-01-13T21:44:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	let me check, but i don't think that would affect middle mouse, and not affect opening multiple tabs when clicking on a link...
2011-01-13T21:45:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	That gui is the easiest way to edit the driver (obviously it's very limiting)
2011-01-13T21:46:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	what gui?
2011-01-13T21:46:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	oh, system > preferences > mouse ?
2011-01-13T21:46:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	yeah
2011-01-13T21:46:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	ah
2011-01-13T21:47:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	ne2k: I suppose since my problem is only with ff, I'll jump over there to see if they have any suggestions :)
2011-01-13T21:47:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	perhaps you can mess with some settings in firefox
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	php counts, basic does not
2011-01-13T21:49:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	you could make anything open links in a new tab in ff.  Maybe there is some other mouse button you could you or something
2011-01-13T21:49:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	well, this mouse only has three :)
2011-01-13T21:49:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	:)
2011-01-20T08:35:00.000Z	edbian	bencahill	definitely
2011-01-20T08:35:00.000Z	bencahill	edbian	jk ;)
