2005-12-31T16:51:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		I haven't had this kind of difficulty installing linux in many years.
2005-12-31T16:51:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		Not a good sign for the "grandma" distro
2005-12-31T16:52:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		well, it took a while to figure out, but the machine froze up partway through booting, before even getting to the installer
2005-12-31T16:52:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		figured out that it needs all of "noapic nolapic pci=noacpi"
2005-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		yes, breezy
2005-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		from ship-it cd's
2005-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		very new... Asus P5LP-LE
2005-12-31T16:54:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		So I managed to get the livecd to boot, got into gnome fine, but had no mouse... no big deal, I want to install completely anyway
2005-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		went to install from the install disc, and first was getting "could not write partition changes to kernel, please reboot asap" etc, couldn't get past that... finally figured it out (not really sure how) and getting through the install, and it complained that tar wasn't available, somehow got past that
2005-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	GnarlyBob		and now it's complaining about missing dependencies that won't be installed
2005-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	I had the same problems on a new Pentium 4 system.
2005-12-31T16:56:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	I solved it by resetting the ACPI tables.
2005-12-31T16:56:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	A friend of mine actually did it; if you want, I can ask him how he did it.
2005-12-31T16:56:00.000Z	GnarlyBob	paulproteus|lapt	I was able to boot into the install with disabling the apic/acpi stuff on the kernel params
2006-01-01T17:00:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	Go to your BIOS and reset the ECSD data.
2006-01-01T09:38:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	Still having troubles with that ACPI computer?
2006-01-01T09:39:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	My advice is that you go to the BIOS and hit the "Set to Factory Default" switch.
2006-01-01T09:39:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	GnarlyBob	That's what fixed the ACPI tables on th eother system.
