2006-05-27T07:35:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	what model of modem are you using?
2006-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	i think the newer firmwares disable one or the other, but there may be a configuration setting in the web UI to allow both.  there used to be.
2006-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	it's easy to forward ports if you have the right firmware.
2006-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	who's your provider?  are you using pppoa or pppoe?
2006-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	or rfc1483?
2006-05-27T07:40:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	is 209.181.2.222 the IP# of the modem or your PC?
2006-05-27T07:41:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	then yeah, you should be fine.  as long as the computers can talk to each other you're good.
2006-05-27T07:43:00.000Z	lullabud	vars	you have to go into the web UI for the router, then tell ports 80 and 443 to forward to the 192.168.x.x address of the server you're running.
