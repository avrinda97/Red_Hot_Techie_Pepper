2008-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	Alex6691		It support's exe file's so im happy.
2008-04-18T05:40:00.000Z	Alex6691		Well how do i do it? cuz when i connect my ipod it doesnt give me an option or anything.

2008-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	Alex6691		Thanks though :)
2008-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Alex6691	newer ipods need the latest libgpod deb or just wait 6 days for next release
2008-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	Alex6691		Mine the old Nano.
2008-04-18T05:45:00.000Z	Alex6691		It's really annoying, i've not been able to Update my iPod since i've deleted Windows. ;/
2008-04-18T05:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Alex6691	not sure about rhythmbox; amarok does it fine for me with all my older ipods
2008-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	Alex6691	bazhang	if i search amarok in synaptic, will i find it?
2008-04-18T05:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Alex6691	should do; though if you are using gnome it will install some kde stuff
2008-04-18T05:47:00.000Z	Alex6691		Any way i can download it through terminal?
2008-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Alex6691	sure sudo apt-get install amarok
