2008-02-18T15:22:00.000Z	jeeaar		hmm
2008-02-18T15:22:00.000Z	jeeaar		quick question...
2008-02-18T15:22:00.000Z	jeeaar		will anybody here be willing to support a noobie vnc question?
2008-02-18T15:24:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	well, ask ;p
2008-02-18T15:28:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	hmm, have the video player always on top ;p
2008-02-18T15:28:00.000Z	jeeaar	faileas	but id likke to be actively say.. web browsing, through my desktop... getting downloads and stuff started.
2008-02-18T15:29:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	didn't do it with VNC but i watch movies and IRC that way ;p
2008-02-18T15:30:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	only real issue would be screen real estate. i doubt either of them can be transpareant
2008-02-18T15:32:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	wait. is the PC a linux one?
2008-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	jeeaar	faileas	no. the laptop is, though.
2008-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	gah, a pity
2008-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	jeeaar	faileas	indeed. im working on the switch slowly.. been getting used to linux with the laptop.. not quite ready to make the leap on my desktop, though.
2008-02-18T15:34:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	sad thing is there's a GREAT terminal services package for linux that can work headless
2008-02-18T15:36:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	also, VNC is probably the worst way to remote access a system ;p
2008-02-18T15:37:00.000Z	jeeaar	faileas	yes yes... security blah blah blah. its only inside a local network. my router has a moderate level of external security
2008-02-18T15:38:00.000Z	jeeaar	faileas	though.. what would you suggest in its place?
2008-02-18T15:40:00.000Z	faileas	jeeaar	on windows, RDP is best, but i never worked out how to set it up on XP (it SHOULD be doable), on linux freenx whips everything else
2008-02-18T15:41:00.000Z	jeeaar	faileas	cool. well.. im off to play. thanks for the advice.. Planning a trip to defcon this year.. i figure ive got a few tricks to learn.
