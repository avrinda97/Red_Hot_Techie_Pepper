2012-03-30T22:32:00.000Z	pgimeno		how can I get full descriptions of packages for oneiric?
2012-03-30T22:33:00.000Z	pgimeno		err brb
2012-03-30T22:34:00.000Z	pgimeno		sorry, again, how do I get package descriptions in oneiric?
2012-03-30T22:35:00.000Z	pgimeno		what is Ubottu?
2012-03-30T22:35:00.000Z	ironm	pgimeno	apt-cache search <package_name> will give you a one line description
2012-03-30T22:35:00.000Z	ironm	pgimeno	what package?
2012-03-30T22:36:00.000Z	pgimeno	ironm	yes, I am looking for full descriptions for all packages Lucid had them but it seems Oneiric doesn't
2012-03-30T22:36:00.000Z	ironm		!aptoncd
2012-03-30T22:37:00.000Z	pgimeno	ironm	was that for me?
2012-03-30T22:37:00.000Z	ironm	pgimeno	an example
2012-03-30T22:38:00.000Z	pgimeno	ironm	my problem is that apt-cache show packagename shows one-line description in oneiric where it showed the full description before, how does APTonCD solve that?
2012-03-30T22:39:00.000Z	ironm	pgimeno	sorry for confusion. APTonCD is only one package name
2012-03-30T22:42:00.000Z	pgimeno	ironm	ah, but where do I get descriptions myself? I can't be connected to this channel 24h, should I use http://packages.ubuntu.com/ every time I want a description?
2012-03-30T22:43:00.000Z	ironm	pgimeno	I don't know how to solve your issue .. sorry
2012-03-30T22:44:00.000Z	pgimeno		thanks anyway ironm
2012-03-31T02:52:00.000Z	pgimeno	ironm	thanks for your help before, in case you care, the problem was that my hosting service's mirror lacked the directory i18n, which is where the package descriptions are now placed
2012-03-31T02:55:00.000Z	ironm		thank you for the info pgimeno  :)
2012-03-31T02:58:00.000Z	pgimeno	ironm	yw, now my problem is that dselect doesn't work with the new files and thus lacks the descriptions, but I'm working now in a program that will merge the descriptions into /var/lib/dpkg/available and friends. Sigh, I fear dselect will cease to be maintained soon... it was my package manager since Debian 1.1 :')
