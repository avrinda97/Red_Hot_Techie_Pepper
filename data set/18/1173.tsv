2011-05-09T10:49:00.000Z	justen5342		@lorenz... is there a switch for your wifi on you pc?..(is it a laptop?)
2011-05-09T10:49:00.000Z	lorenz	justen5342	yep, the light is blue
2011-05-09T10:50:00.000Z	justen5342		ok .. just wondering... i freaked..  and took a couple hrs but had a switch on the "laptop"
2011-05-09T10:51:00.000Z	justen5342	lorenz	 have you tried a "wrapper"?
2011-05-09T10:52:00.000Z	lorenz	justen5342	no I have not--the install worked out of the box six months ago--but then stopped about 4 days ago...you think a wrapper is the right choice?
2011-05-09T10:54:00.000Z	justen5342		lorenz.. you never know.. if you updated, i have problems each time.. . (downloading one now)
2011-05-09T10:55:00.000Z	justen5342		i think it's "NDISWRAPPER" that works with all most any wireless card..(but you need the driver)
2011-05-09T10:56:00.000Z	lorenz	justen5342	do you think a re-install might fix it?
2011-05-09T10:57:00.000Z	justen5342	lorenz	... VERY POSSIBLE.. maybe some packages didn't get installed right..
2011-05-09T10:58:00.000Z	justen5342		@lorenz.. but i'd have to know what PC you're working with
2011-05-09T10:59:00.000Z	lorenz	justen5342	a compaq presario cq60
2011-05-09T11:02:00.000Z	justen5342	lorenz	how did you install ubuntu?.. from boot?.. or with the windows "install disk"?
2011-05-09T11:03:00.000Z	lorenz	justen5342	ubuntu live cd with the gui
2011-05-09T11:03:00.000Z	justen5342		Lorenz, is this the first time you installed it?
