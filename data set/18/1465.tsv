2011-02-11T11:47:00.000Z	wiblewoble	xs1	have you tried the sound recorder and alsamixer for your sound levels
2011-02-11T11:47:00.000Z	xs1		not the alsamixer

2011-02-11T12:10:00.000Z	xs1		Hi, I'm currently using maverick. I was messing around with ALSA while trying to make my mic detect sound, and now there is no sound from my speakers either
2011-02-11T12:12:00.000Z	xs1		bulgard, went through it. I think all I have to do is reset alsa to default. I'm just not clear how to do that
2011-02-11T12:13:00.000Z	wiblewoble	xs1	what did you do ?
2011-02-11T12:14:00.000Z	xs1	wiblewoble	i followed this until the ./configure near the end. It said command not found. I rebooted after that

2011-02-11T12:21:00.000Z	wiblewoble	xs1	why ?  you stoped alsa to install that version thats why theres no sound. so you rebooted have you got sounnd?
2011-02-11T12:22:00.000Z	xs1	wiblewoble	It wouldn't recognize the command for some reason. I didn't really have another option, and no I don't
2011-02-11T12:23:00.000Z	wiblewoble	xs1	which command did you get stuck on?
2011-02-11T12:24:00.000Z	xs1		./configure , 3 steps before reboot
2011-02-11T12:24:00.000Z	xs1		near the end
2011-02-11T12:27:00.000Z	xs1	wiblewoble	I think I reinstalled it. I tried reinstalling the ALSA drivers from a fresh kernal. I'll come back and let you know. Thanks a lot for the help.
