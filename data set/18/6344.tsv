2008-05-25T15:56:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	do go medibuntu.org and follow instructions
2008-05-25T16:01:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	go to medibuntu.org and activate medibuntu repository.
2008-05-25T16:02:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	now doing that
2008-05-25T16:06:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	what do i actually want from medibuntu
2008-05-25T16:06:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	you want Sun Java, w32codecs, libdvdcss2, media players,
2008-05-25T16:07:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	but it's my video drivers that aren't working?
2008-05-25T16:08:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	try the medibuntu stuff and if you cannot get it to work then your system could be broken.
2008-05-25T16:08:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	i know my system is broken, it fails to load the gl drivers
2008-05-25T16:09:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	wat about a re-install ?
2008-05-25T16:09:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	i'm considering it
2008-05-25T16:09:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	only takes 1 to 2 hours.
2008-05-25T16:09:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	just i'll have to buy a ne HDD to do that to back up all my data
2008-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	cannot you write your data to CDs ?
2008-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	lots of cds
2008-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	I have little cabinets with 50 CDs in each
2008-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	Caf-Fiend	robg_	yeah but  burning many cds is horribly tedious
2008-05-25T16:13:00.000Z	robg_	Caf-Fiend	we must plan for future failures and future re-installs. I have my system not in my computer but on CDs. I can rebuild immediately.
