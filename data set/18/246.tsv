2012-10-06T14:42:00.000Z	bz0b		hey guys. i have a few questions about setting up HA on ubuntu 12.04 lts. anyone here have any experience with that?
2012-10-06T14:42:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	as in High Availability?  That and Ubuntu don't exactly mix.
2012-10-06T14:42:00.000Z	bz0b		High Availablitiy
2012-10-06T14:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	speak to Canonical about getting support for that.  They will provide all the help you need
2012-10-06T14:43:00.000Z	bz0b		Well I was going to use heartbeat and pacemaker
2012-10-06T14:43:00.000Z	bz0b		really?
2012-10-06T14:43:00.000Z	bz0b	WarOfTheNerd	How would I contact them?
2012-10-06T14:44:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	have a look at canonical.com
2012-10-06T14:45:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	you could also fill out:  http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/contact
2012-10-06T14:45:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	when it comes to mission-critical, don't skimp on support =]
2012-10-06T14:46:00.000Z	bz0b	WarOfTheNerd	The problem with that is I have to have this done today and I don't think that gives me a large enough window of time to get support.
2012-10-06T14:48:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	ah, that's a bit tight.  If you're not tied to any particular distro, you could always ask the #centos folks how you'd do it if you used their distro
2012-10-06T14:49:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	the reason I say this is because although Ubuntu is awesome, it isn't popular with large-scale clustering, HA or big private virt farms yet
2012-10-06T14:49:00.000Z	bz0b	WarOfTheNerd	So basically I need to setup 2 hp servers with 24tb disk arrays that need to be clustered for HA, authenticated via AD, and setup with an NFS, AFP (netatalk), and Samba Share, and they all have to be highly available, and synced through both servers, and all authenticated with AD
2012-10-06T14:50:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	got a budget?  If you need faster support you could ring up Red Hat and get a quote if Canonical support isn't quick enough
2012-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	bz0b		Yes, It's probably along the lines of $500 USD
2012-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd		ouch
2012-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	bz0b	if you need a free/community solution, you're probably better off with CentOS, they have people who deal with this sort of thing
