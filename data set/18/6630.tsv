2008-05-10T18:36:00.000Z	mr_boo		do you guys ever manipulate the modelines in xorg.conf?
2008-05-10T18:37:00.000Z	mr_boo		i'd like to tune my monitor old-school style
2008-05-10T18:37:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	you could trash X, but sure, the good ol' unix way.
2008-05-10T19:09:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	yes. The ##asm channel is also small for its language type.
2008-05-10T19:10:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	besides, CRT is like sitting in front of a baggage scanner all day. Unless you think screenburn is exciting...
2008-05-10T19:10:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	where did assembler come into the picture
2008-05-10T19:10:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	no one bothers with these things anymore.
2008-05-10T19:10:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	you remind me of the old era.
2008-05-10T19:11:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	that had it's advantages
2008-05-10T19:11:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	besides, what do you expect to get out of tuning your monitor...
2008-05-10T19:11:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	i want the optimal refreshrate for high resolutions at the expense of image sharpness
2008-05-10T19:13:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	I have never seen a person want to benchtune a CRT box before, honestly.
2008-05-10T19:13:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	and you want an application to do this for you? Well, the Internet is big, but not that big.
2008-05-10T19:14:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	tune it with experimental modelines would take forever
2008-05-10T19:14:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	besides, edid and other stuff inhibits me from using certain resolutions
2008-05-10T19:15:00.000Z	Jafet	mr_boo	well, all I can say is that I'm almost certain you're SOL in this business.
2008-05-10T19:15:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	well, that kind of science only applies to crt monitors
2008-05-10T19:16:00.000Z	mr_boo	Jafet	any lcd i want would be too expensive
