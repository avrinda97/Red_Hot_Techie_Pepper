2008-05-28T16:21:00.000Z	cj_		sweet thanks
2008-05-28T16:23:00.000Z	cj_		now if i could only get wine to run guild wars right id be set but i think i need to go to wine for that though
2008-05-28T16:23:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	Try forcing it to run in OpenGL mode.
2008-05-28T16:26:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	I see.  It is in the wine settings.  For me, Guildwars ran right out of the box.  The trick is to download the installer from the website instead of using the CD.  :)
2008-05-28T16:28:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	What happens when you tell guildwars to start?
2008-05-28T16:38:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	Let me bring it up.
2008-05-28T16:38:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	What kind of graphic card do you have?
2008-05-28T16:40:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	:/  let me see what I fan find.  ATI doesn't leave a lot of promise for games under Linux because of their crappy support of the community.  (Someone PLEASE correct me if I am wrong here.  It has been a while since I personally saw a driver release for ATI).
2008-05-28T16:41:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	mrynit : mrynit There are new binaries?  cj_ If there are new binaries get them.
2008-05-28T16:42:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	Ubuntu MIGHT have packages for them, depending on the licensing, but there is a a good chance you will have to go straight to the web site.
2008-05-28T16:43:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	Follow the install instructions.
2008-05-28T16:45:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	 basically if it is like the ones in past (I have not looked so I am not sure) you will want to run them using sudo, or as root for the install, because it is going to put stuff places that your regular account can't go.  go into xterm, then in the directory it is in run ./ati-driver-installer-8-5-x86.x86_64.run
2008-05-28T16:47:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	Where did you download it too?
2008-05-28T16:52:00.000Z	Emry	cj_	That means you are probably in your home dir.  Type cd Desktop
