2009-05-24T08:30:00.000Z	zeromod		only thing I could think of is that mount is dated? I assume that's what would have the heaviest hand in this working or not, but it mounts it just fine without the -3g added to ntfs
2009-05-24T08:30:00.000Z	zeromod		I don't see 3g in man only a gid reference. Is anyone familiar if it's really needed for read write of ntfs mount?
2009-05-24T08:30:00.000Z	zeromod		oh i hope not I don't feel like building a kernel tonight lol
2009-05-24T08:31:00.000Z	zeromod		ntfs access isn't that new though
2009-05-24T08:31:00.000Z	zeromod		wow frigging sshd died it didn't like me doing that lol
2009-05-24T08:32:00.000Z	zeromod		so ill skip the -3g flag
2009-05-24T08:32:00.000Z	zeromod		I probably don't have fuse then
2009-05-24T08:32:00.000Z	zeromod		it's a minimal breezy server install
2009-05-24T08:34:00.000Z	zeromod		thanks jamed ill get it :)
2009-05-24T08:34:00.000Z	zeromod		it's illegal if you are playing games you don't own which is why you would mod it in the first place because xbox has crap for homebrew community. SIlly argument
