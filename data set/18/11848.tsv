2006-10-02T14:07:00.000Z	tonedahl		Hi, I'm in bitchx in tty1 and need serious help. When I type the correct login information in the loginscreen, gdm restarts. And I return to the login scren.  What should I do?!
2006-10-02T14:07:00.000Z	tonedahl		Please - please, help me :(
2006-10-02T14:07:00.000Z	tonedahl		I hate bitchx in tty1 :p
2006-10-02T14:09:00.000Z	tonedahl		Please? :(
2006-10-02T14:09:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	I'm not running ubuntu right now so I'm not the best person to help, but I think the first thing to try is to check the X log files to see what the error is
2006-10-02T14:10:00.000Z	tonedahl	jp	but X must be working since it is able to show the login..?
2006-10-02T14:10:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	or you can just type startx and I think the errors will be displayed on the screen (you can do that on a diff console so you don't have to close bitchx)
2006-10-02T14:11:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	good point. Well, if startx works then you know it's a gdm problem. If it doesn't, then it's probably a X problem
2006-10-02T14:11:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	did you change your .xinit file recently?
2006-10-02T14:11:00.000Z	tonedahl	jp	not that I know of...
2006-10-02T14:12:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	ok. Too bad, that would be a good candidate for the breakage ;)
2006-10-02T14:12:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	try startx, let us know what that does
2006-10-02T14:12:00.000Z	tonedahl	jp	okay! Start X prob. gave me the error
2006-10-02T14:13:00.000Z	tonedahl	jp	it cant write to /var. Its full..?
2006-10-02T14:13:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	df -h will show free space. If var's full, then it would make sense that you can't login
2006-10-02T14:15:00.000Z	tonedahl	jp	thanks ;) Trying to free some space by removing amarok
2006-10-02T14:16:00.000Z	jp	tonedahl	glad I was able to help! And thanks for letting me know you  figured it out :)
2006-10-02T14:16:00.000Z	tonedahl	jp	it worked! :D Thanks!
