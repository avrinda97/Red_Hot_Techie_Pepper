2010-02-20T08:57:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	kareeser	should i delete them from .themes and start over?
2010-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	kareeser	yeah i had errors (newbie) looking for a cool theme
2010-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	kareeser	JoeSomebody	it depends... I usually go the direct route and extract the files straight to /usr/share/themes
2010-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	kareeser	JoeSomebody	less of a headache, because I ran into the same probs. as you
2010-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	kareeser	JoeSomebody	yes... so clear your .themes first
2010-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	kareeser	ok , all of them?
2010-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	kareeser	JoeSomebody	whichever ones don't show up in appearance settings :)
