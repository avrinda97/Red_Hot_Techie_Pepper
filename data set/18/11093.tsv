2006-09-15T13:29:00.000Z	E_r_i_K		medic: have you tried ssh-copy-id ?
2006-09-15T13:30:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	i cannot get that to work
2006-09-15T13:30:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	always permission denied
2006-09-15T13:31:00.000Z	E_r_i_K		medic: what are your permissions on the ~/.ssh on the remote box?
2006-09-15T13:31:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	currently 600
2006-09-15T13:31:00.000Z	medic30420		ownership under my username
2006-09-15T13:31:00.000Z	medic30420		tried under root
2006-09-15T13:32:00.000Z	medic30420		read / write
2006-09-15T13:33:00.000Z	E_r_i_K		medic: after ssh-copy-id does it put something in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys?
2006-09-15T13:34:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	no, it gives an access denied
2006-09-15T13:36:00.000Z	E_r_i_K	medic30420	 my usual next move is to rename ~/.ssh and then retry, but that is just me
2006-09-15T13:36:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	i will give it a try
2006-09-15T13:37:00.000Z	E_r_i_K		medic: if that works, you can compare the permissions and merge accordingly
2006-09-15T13:39:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	hey, that worked
2006-09-15T13:40:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	wierd, let me go look at the permissions
2006-09-15T13:40:00.000Z	E_r_i_K		medic: :)
2006-09-15T13:41:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	execute was checked, other than that everything the same
2006-09-15T13:41:00.000Z	medic30420	E_r_i_K	thanks a bunch
