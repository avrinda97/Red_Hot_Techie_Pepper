2005-11-06T10:35:00.000Z	BinkS		yes i am running gnome
2005-11-06T10:36:00.000Z	BinkS		installing now :)
2005-11-06T10:36:00.000Z	dcatdemon		um... that's in the universe repo.
2005-11-06T10:36:00.000Z	BinkS		huh iceman?
2005-11-06T10:39:00.000Z	BinkS		back soon, trying et :/
2005-11-06T10:41:00.000Z	BinkS		Back
2005-11-06T10:41:00.000Z	BinkS		Still no sound :/
2005-11-06T10:41:00.000Z	BinkS		any ideas?
2005-11-06T10:42:00.000Z	BinkS		ok thanks thirso
2005-11-06T10:43:00.000Z	BinkS		doesnt work?
2005-11-06T10:43:00.000Z	dcatdemon		Binks: that is strange.  I had this problem when I tried playing Cube or Tuxracer when most of the forums gave advice on quitting esd "to get sound".  I got fed up of quitting esd everytime so I installed the SDL with esd support.
2005-11-06T10:44:00.000Z	dcatdemon	BinkS	that seems to be the closest scenario that you described (everything else has sound only ET doesn't).
2005-11-06T10:45:00.000Z	BinkS		still doesnt thirso, nothing happens :/
2005-11-06T10:45:00.000Z	BinkS	dcatdemon	yes. Explain what you did to sort it lol
2005-11-06T10:46:00.000Z	BinkS		then what thirso, or is that work?
2005-11-06T10:47:00.000Z	dcatdemon		Binks: sorry, gtg. better luck with the others.
2005-11-06T10:47:00.000Z	BinkS	dcatdemon	nps, thanks
