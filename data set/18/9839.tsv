2008-10-10T09:00:00.000Z	lwizardl		anyone here have any experience configuring retail point of sale systems on linux?
2008-10-10T09:00:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	what POS system are you working with?
2008-10-10T09:01:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	I've tried about 10 different applications and don't like any so far
2008-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	which ones?
2008-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	what are you trying to do? is this app for restaurants, etc?
2008-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	nope i'm opening a retail store
2008-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	well on windows i've only tried openbravo
2008-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	i'm assuming you need to do credit card processing?
2008-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	inventory control, etc.
2008-10-10T09:04:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	yes i need credit cards, inventories, etc
2008-10-10T09:05:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	for me i just called up one of these credit card processing companies and they gave me the libraries to program the credit card processing stuff
2008-10-10T09:06:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	then you can hire a programmer to program the rest of your requirements
2008-10-10T09:06:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	yeah but about 99% of the people i've talked to are windows only
2008-10-10T09:08:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	do you own a store?
2008-10-10T09:09:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	umm let's take this offline because if you can tell me some info like average, high, low
2008-10-10T09:09:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	no but i'm heavily involved with CC transactions
2008-10-10T09:10:00.000Z	dasickis	lwizardl	i'm involved with mobile transactions i.e. NY taxi cabs
2008-10-10T09:10:00.000Z	lwizardl	dasickis	can I pm you?
