2005-07-25T06:26:00.000Z	X3N	admrl_	do you know how to use vi ?
2005-07-25T06:28:00.000Z	X3N	admrl_	because what you need to do now is edit /etc/X11/xorg.con and replace where it says "nv" to "nvidia"
2005-07-25T06:29:00.000Z	X3N	admrl_	ah ok then
2005-07-25T06:29:00.000Z	X3N	admrl_	you'll have to restart X i'm affraid
