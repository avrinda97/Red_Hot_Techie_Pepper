2010-03-23T01:35:00.000Z	Mike____		I've had a problem with intermittent extra mouse clicks (moving a window maximize instead) (problem selecting text) since updating to 2.6.31-20-generic last week.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1429091&highlight=click+drag+broken describes it well.  Anyone else seen this?  have a fix?
2010-03-23T01:36:00.000Z	Mike____		any details zoug_ ?
2010-03-23T01:37:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	i want to run sudo commands, but it doesnt work..
2010-03-23T01:37:00.000Z	Mike____	zoug_	your SOL on that one.  Run them in root's cron if you can.
2010-03-23T01:38:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	on a diff tty perhaps?
2010-03-23T01:38:00.000Z	Mike____	zoug_	you can make sure sudo doesn't prompt for a password etc and may get somewhere with it.
2010-03-23T01:38:00.000Z	Mike____		Cron doesn't need a tty
2010-03-23T01:39:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	why would it ask password if i run it with sudo?
2010-03-23T01:39:00.000Z	Mike____		sudo prompts for password to verify the user's identity matches up in the sudoers file for that command.
2010-03-23T01:40:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	so i have to login to root..thats the only way?
2010-03-23T01:40:00.000Z	Mike____	zoug_	you can turn that off by adding   Somthing like "Defaults:ALL            !authenticate"  to your sudoers file.
2010-03-23T01:41:00.000Z	Mike____	zoug_	as these are cron jobs you want to run as root, put them in root's crontab.  If that's not what you want.  Please clarify.
2010-03-23T01:41:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	okay, i'l try to mess with that
2010-03-23T01:41:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	yeah, i want roots jobs to run from my account
2010-03-23T01:42:00.000Z	Mike____	zoug_	I don't see why you would want to do that.  You want them to be in your cron jobs but run as root.  Is this a desktop or a shared server?
2010-03-23T01:44:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	its a desktop. i want to shutdown my system while i'm still in my account. and halt needs root
2010-03-23T01:44:00.000Z	Mike____	zoug_	cron jobs run for the user whether they are logged in or not.  root's cron jobs will run as scheduled no matter who is logged in.
2010-03-23T01:45:00.000Z	zoug_	Mike____	thats right
