2007-03-13T14:50:00.000Z	CheshireViking	nospi	i used to use Gaim and switched over to aMSN because I found that Gaim wasn't showing my online/busy/away status to msn users
2007-03-13T14:50:00.000Z	nospi	CheshireViking	does gaim show your display pic to other msn userS?
2007-03-13T14:50:00.000Z	nospi	CheshireViking	i couldn't see my friend's just then
2007-03-13T14:51:00.000Z	CheshireViking	nospi	i don't know about the display pictures, its something i've never tried
2007-03-13T14:52:00.000Z	nospi	CheshireViking	i know that trillian does, but i don't know if you can get it for linux
2007-03-13T14:55:00.000Z	CheshireViking	nospi	i've got a feeling that gaim is more like windows messenger, while aMSN logs in as though its a windows live messenger equivalent
2007-03-13T14:56:00.000Z	nospi	CheshireViking	cool, i'll get aMSN then
2007-03-13T14:57:00.000Z	CheshireViking	nospi	i've seen a suggestion on forum that kopete is supposed to be similar to trillian - but i've not used trillian for a long time & only gave kopete a very quick look
2007-03-13T15:11:00.000Z	CheshireViking	nospi	lol
