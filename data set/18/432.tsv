2012-02-20T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phpn00b	so like a timer, see how long things take to happen
2012-02-20T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phpn00b	so you want to see how long a certain task takes?
2012-02-20T02:55:00.000Z	phpn00b	ActionParsnip	I would like to know how productive I am e.g. over the last 2 weeks
2012-02-20T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phpn00b	productive in what way?
2012-02-20T02:55:00.000Z	phpn00b	ActionParsnip	time spent on work
2012-02-20T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phpn00b	^ maybe
2012-02-20T02:57:00.000Z	phpn00b	ActionParsnip	I don't need a timer. I only need an app to keep tracks of records and can build stats
2012-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phpn00b	how do you mean 'track records'?
2012-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	phpn00b	ActionParsnip	e.g. 20/02/2012: 8 hours @ work; 4 hours @ study
2012-02-21T01:52:00.000Z	phpn00b	ActionParsnip	I don't want to backup my whole system. Only my home folder
2012-02-21T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phpn00b	then just copy it all to a removable storage device, I use a cron'd cp job which runs and copies the lot
