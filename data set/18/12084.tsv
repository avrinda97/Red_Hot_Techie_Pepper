2008-04-23T13:41:00.000Z	tmroland		pls tell me something to do at comand line that takes a lot of time to perform and intensively uses system resources.. something like a simple benchamark or similar
2008-04-23T13:41:00.000Z	tmroland		using aa standard comand
2008-04-23T13:42:00.000Z	tmroland		something else
2008-04-23T13:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	what do you want to benchmark?
2008-04-23T13:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	sudo hdparm -tT /dev/blah to benchmark a hdd
2008-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	why do you want it to work like that?
2008-04-23T13:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	you want a benchmark that just goes on forever?
2008-04-23T13:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	for what purpose?
2008-04-23T13:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	cat /dev/urandom > /dev/null ?
2008-04-23T13:47:00.000Z	tmroland	dystopianray	: i did that comand. tell me what does it do ? generate random numbers and send them to the black hole ?
2008-04-23T13:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	basically
2008-04-23T13:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	check top
2008-04-23T13:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	try this as well: cat /dev/sda > /dev/null
2008-04-23T13:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	replacing sda with whatever your hdd is
2008-04-23T13:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	that's right
2008-04-23T13:51:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	it writes the entire contents of the drive to /dev/null
2008-04-23T13:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	tmroland	it simpy reads the contents of the drive and writes it to /dev/null
