2007-04-12T16:14:00.000Z	ROnewbie		Hi there; I'm trying to get sound on a Gateway 3040GZ laptop. Any help ?
2007-04-12T16:16:00.000Z	ROnewbie		Sound on laptops? Anyone?
2007-04-12T16:17:00.000Z	elifed	ROnewbie	my experience has been if it's AC97 it just works
2007-04-12T16:21:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	I'm right now going through the forums, trying to get the basics of this; what is AC97 ?
2007-04-12T16:24:00.000Z	elifed	ROnewbie	integrated audio chipset spec
2007-04-12T16:25:00.000Z	elifed	ROnewbie	how old is this laptop?
2007-04-12T16:25:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	aaa .... about a year and half
2007-04-12T16:25:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	2005 or so
2007-04-12T16:27:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	"intel 82801db ICH4" - I think that's the sign of the beast. / crank handle ? sorry, me newbie.
2007-04-12T16:27:00.000Z	elifed	ROnewbie	he was joking
2007-04-12T16:28:00.000Z	elifed	ROnewbie	okay, ironically intel designed the AC'97 spec
2007-04-12T16:30:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	I ran a couple of weeks ago, last time I had the patience to go through this (I really want to quit windows), into a forum post where a guy with a similar problem solved it by playing with the alsamixer - he just turned some switches on and off again; I turned all of mine on in alsamixer, just in case. Nada. Zip.
2007-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	following a wifi and a widescreen 3-day-long troubleshooting session, this is really annoying.
2007-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	elifed	ROnewbie	as in muted?
2007-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	yes
2007-04-12T16:32:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	can you recommend anyone with audio experience around here ?
2007-04-12T16:33:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	forums don't help.
2007-04-12T16:33:00.000Z	ROnewbie	elifed	on this issue
