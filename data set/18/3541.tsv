2009-10-01T20:33:00.000Z	gwydionwaters		hey
2009-10-01T20:34:00.000Z	gwydionwaters		sometimes zip files, that previously open, will not open claiming they are incomplete
2009-10-01T20:34:00.000Z	gwydionwaters		any ideas?
2009-10-01T20:34:00.000Z	gwydionwaters		these are very large and on dvd
2009-10-01T20:35:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	what do you mean by very large, precisely?
2009-10-01T20:36:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	and how did you attempt to unzip them, before and now?
2009-10-01T20:36:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	you might try "unzip", from the terminal. if nothing else, you might get a clearer error message.
2009-10-01T20:37:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	might also simply be that the dvd is damaged
2009-10-01T20:38:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	i'm sure it did.
2009-10-01T20:39:00.000Z	gwydionwaters	sipior	lol is this a common problem?
2009-10-01T20:39:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	not to my knowledge.
2009-10-01T20:40:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	optical media can be maddeningly fragile at times.
2009-10-01T20:40:00.000Z	gwydionwaters	sipior	i think osx's zips just suck. or the application 'burn'
2009-10-01T20:43:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	you mentioned an upgrade before. what exactly did you upgrade between the time you successfully opened this zip file and now?
2009-10-01T20:44:00.000Z	gwydionwaters	sipior	i upgraded from ubuntu 8.10 to 9.04 which went bad so i installed a clean 8.10 again, which was what i had when it did work. same install cd and all
2009-10-01T20:46:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	you might try accessing it from another machine. can you access the archive from the os x machine that wrote it?
2009-10-01T20:46:00.000Z	gwydionwaters	sipior	it does have some minor scratches in a bunch so i am going to try fixing them with a kit i have
2009-10-01T21:10:00.000Z	sipior	gwydionwaters	ouch. hate to see that.
