2005-02-15T17:45:00.000Z	hizz		evening
2005-02-15T17:46:00.000Z	hizz		has anyone managed to get intel's ipw2100 working out of the box?
2005-02-15T17:47:00.000Z	hizz		i can't for the life of me get wireless lan running
2005-02-15T17:48:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 what's your card?
2005-02-15T17:49:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 is this a centrino card or a pcmcia?
2005-02-15T17:51:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 it shouldn't.  is your wireless eth1?
2005-02-15T17:52:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 do an lsmod and see if it's loaded.
2005-02-15T17:55:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 does ifconfig eth1 give you anything?
2005-02-15T06:37:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 great!
2005-02-15T07:04:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 add umask=022
2005-02-15T07:04:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	no, ntfs write support in the kernel is still experimental/very dangerous.
2005-02-15T07:06:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	you could can use defaults options as well
2005-02-15T11:08:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 in firefox, go to a page that needs it and it should prompt you to install.
2005-02-15T11:09:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 so you need shockwave, not flash?
2005-02-15T11:19:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 sudo apt-cache search flashplayer
2005-02-15T11:19:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 make sure again your line with universe is uncommented, try updating.
2005-02-15T11:20:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 you could also try multiverse if you're feeling daring.
2005-02-15T11:20:00.000Z	ewhitten	hizz	 but the flash installer straight from macromedia is fine as well.
