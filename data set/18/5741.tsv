2008-08-31T02:23:00.000Z	RB2	natnay1	are you sure you mysqld installed?
2008-08-31T02:23:00.000Z	natnay1	RB2	where can i get it, synaptic doesnt seem to have it
2008-08-31T02:24:00.000Z	natnay1	RB2	there are other versions like the python-mysqldb ones
2008-08-31T02:25:00.000Z	RB2	natnay1	mysql is in synaptic... it's mysql-server-5.0 And as far as python-mysqldb, that's the mysql adapters for those languages.
