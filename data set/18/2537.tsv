2010-04-27T08:09:00.000Z	TomJ		is Netbook remix generally recommended? I am considering it for use on my Mum's Dell Latitude, it's a proper laptop, but a Celeron, and slow as hell in XP. she just needs firefox and openoffice
2010-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	TomJ		oh, actually, maybe not - "the whole thing [clutter interface] is a bit too sluggish and processor-hungry."
2010-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	TomJ		shame, the interface looks nice. i need something as simple as possible for my mum :)
2010-04-27T08:12:00.000Z	TomJ		ok thanks h00k
2010-04-27T08:14:00.000Z	TomJ		although actually I supppose xubuntu would probably be the lightest resource usage, of the three?
2010-04-27T08:14:00.000Z	TomJ		actually that's a good point, KDE 4 is a bit of a dog. I'm still using KDE 3.5 personally.
2010-04-27T08:16:00.000Z	eoeas	TomJ	Check: http://fluxbuntu.org/
2010-04-27T08:17:00.000Z	TomJ	eoeas	thanks, yeah fluxbox is the lightest of them all I guess
2010-04-27T08:28:00.000Z	eoeas	TomJ	You're a funny character, don't wind the guy up :-D
2010-04-27T08:23:00.000Z	eoeas	TomJ	Just tell her about lynx and leave her to the terminal, ya can't go lighter than that :p
2010-04-27T08:24:00.000Z	TomJ	eoeas	hahaha, yeah.. actually, she still hasn't quite got hte concept of windows and how to maximise them, so perhaps a non-windowed system would work :)
2010-04-27T08:24:00.000Z	eoeas	TomJ	lol
2010-04-27T08:31:00.000Z	TomJ	eoeas	who? :) hiexpo?
