2011-08-12T05:53:00.000Z	DigDug		Anyone have a reccomendat
2011-08-12T05:55:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	finish the question
2011-08-12T05:56:00.000Z	DigDug	ObrienDave	sorry 'bout that.
2011-08-12T05:57:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	any ubuntu liveCD distro woorks pretty good. been trying them all for a month or so
2011-08-12T05:58:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	you can try the alternate install. seem to be on the slim side
2011-08-12T05:59:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	I'm running regular ubuntu on a 16GB stick right now.
2011-08-12T06:00:00.000Z	DigDug	ObrienDave	Oh, nice. I tried Slitaz, and while its really light (whole thing loads into RAM!), it didn't have the drivers for my my WiFi.
2011-08-12T06:03:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	2x4GB about $125
2011-08-12T06:04:00.000Z	DigDug	ObrienDave	DDR2 for laptop?
2011-08-12T06:04:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	yep
2011-08-12T06:05:00.000Z	DigDug	ObrienDave	But I have a Dell Promo Gift Card. :(
2011-08-12T06:05:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	yep for laptop
2011-08-12T06:07:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	yes and no. you won't notice a performance issue unless your running apps that swap memory a lot.
2011-08-12T06:07:00.000Z	DigDug	ObrienDave	I Was thinking that with 8GB I could run the whole OS in RAM (i.e. no swap)
2011-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	don't know enough about linux to tell you about that one
2011-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	seems right though
2011-08-12T06:09:00.000Z	DigDug	ObrienDave	No worries, I appreciate the help. I remember reading about the "Is the Swap Necessary?" issue. People argue it back and forth.
2011-08-12T06:11:00.000Z	ObrienDave	DigDug	same argument over windows vs. linux. personal preference really. you will ALWAYS have naysayers on both sides of the fence
