2006-08-31T13:32:00.000Z	qazwsx		i realy ned help to reset permissions of /usr and its sub folders
2006-08-31T13:33:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	when you did your chmod you used -R ?
2006-08-31T13:34:00.000Z	qazwsx	StoneNote	yes
2006-08-31T13:35:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	ouch.  yeah that would do it.  without know what folders you have under /usr/ we'd just wind up breaking more stuff.  755 looks right for /usr/ but it might NOT be right for one of the subfolders
2006-08-31T13:35:00.000Z	qazwsx	StoneNote	yeah. The bigest problem is i cant use sudo
2006-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	hold one a sec
2006-08-31T13:38:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	open a console and cd /usr/bin and then ls -l sudo  and paste me what you get
2006-08-31T13:38:00.000Z	qazwsx	StoneNote	"-rwxrwx--- 1 root root 93844 2006-05-17 10:41 sudo
2006-08-31T13:39:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	mine is  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 93844 2006-05-17 04:41 sudo so I can see you've done major damage with chmod -R commands, and more than one at that
2006-08-31T13:41:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	use chmod to fix the programs you need from /usr/bin and back up any data you need, your bookmarks and whatever because it doesn't look good from where I'm sitting.  Maybe you can find someone who has a quick fix for you.  I'm sorry to say I do not.
2006-08-31T13:41:00.000Z	qazwsx	StoneNote	how do i change mine to be like your?
2006-08-31T13:46:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	chmod 755 sudo
2006-08-31T13:46:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	make sure you are in /usr/bin
2006-08-31T13:47:00.000Z	qazwsx	StoneNote	thanks. I will just reinstal the system
2006-08-31T13:47:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	_lupine is correct.  I would try to back up any files I absolutely needed before I did anything else
2006-08-31T13:47:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	look at what _lupine posted
2006-08-31T13:48:00.000Z	StoneNote	qazwsx	did you export your bookmarks and back them up too? just in case
2006-08-31T13:50:00.000Z	qazwsx	StoneNote	let me check if all is ok now
