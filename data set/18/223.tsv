2012-06-02T23:42:00.000Z	Slow		Can anyone help with a wubi instalation that errors out after a reboot?
2012-06-02T23:43:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	depends on the error of course
2012-06-02T23:44:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	lines?
2012-06-02T23:47:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	if you type 'rei' then hit TAB, what happens?
2012-06-02T23:48:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	no here :p
2012-06-02T23:48:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	aha :)
2012-06-02T23:49:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	didn't seem like you knew how to do that
2012-06-02T23:51:00.000Z	Slow	reisio	other than installing ubuntu manually... well, from a disk, any suggestions?
2012-06-02T23:52:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	you don't want to do an ordinary install?
2012-06-03T01:03:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	not saying much, though :p
2012-06-03T01:00:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	probably has more to do with your Windows installation than wubi itself
2012-06-03T01:00:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	why not do a normal install
2012-06-03T01:00:00.000Z	Slow	reisio	you said that earlier... and I'm not sure I understand what you mean
2012-06-03T01:01:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	you can install Ubuntu to a dedicated partition or two instead of via Wubi (to a file)
2012-06-03T01:01:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	:D
2012-06-03T01:02:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	or you could go buy another disk
2012-06-03T01:02:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	you'll need another eventually anyways
2012-06-03T01:02:00.000Z	reisio	Slow	you using Vista? :p
