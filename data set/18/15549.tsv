2005-03-07T17:10:00.000Z	bborkk		Is anyone successfully using wxPython 2.5.3 on Ubuntu?
2005-03-07T17:11:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	I am, sort of
2005-03-07T17:11:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	with the musicbrainz 'picard' tagger
2005-03-07T17:11:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	So, I was too until I upgraded to Hoary.
2005-03-07T17:12:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	You're not at ML are you?
2005-03-07T17:12:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	ML?
2005-03-07T17:12:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	Guess not.  :)
2005-03-07T17:13:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	Anyway, I'm using Python 2.4 and it has access to wxPython 2.4.2.4, but not to 2.5.3.1.
2005-03-07T17:14:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	You mean, the package doesn't install, or .. ?
2005-03-07T17:15:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	I have wxpython2.5.3, libwxgtk2.5.3, and libwxgtk2.5.3-python installed.  No problems there.
2005-03-07T17:21:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	so, what problems are you running into w/ wxpython?
2005-03-07T17:22:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	 wx.VERSION returns (2,4,2,4) instead of (2,5,3,1)... Python doesn't seem to know about wxPython2.5.3
2005-03-07T17:26:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	wx.VERSION gives 2,5,3,2,'pre' for me
2005-03-07T17:26:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	Which repository did you get it from?  Do you have wxpython 2.4 installed as well?
2005-03-07T17:30:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	universe...
2005-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	I do not have wxpython2.4 installed as well (and don't see the option to do so)
2005-03-07T17:34:00.000Z	bborkk	hawke_	Are you using Python 2.4?
2005-03-07T17:34:00.000Z	hawke_	bborkk	Yup
