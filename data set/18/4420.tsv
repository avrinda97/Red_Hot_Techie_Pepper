2012-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	ajah		how to remove on startup network configuration
2012-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 you do not wish to get assigned dhcp address?
2012-01-02T14:22:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	is this what is doing waiting for dynamic address on eth0?
2012-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 is it possible that your problem actually is that you can not get assigned an ip, therefore it is hanging?
2012-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	how to disable this thing
2012-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	if u tell me which script is in /etc/init.d/
2012-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	 i would be glad
2012-01-02T14:24:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 perhaps look at /etc/network/interfaces and comment auto eth0 dhcp
2012-01-02T14:27:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	i don`t have such line in this file
2012-01-02T14:28:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 the init script is /etc/init.d/networking i think but i wouldnt want to disable mine :D
2012-01-02T14:29:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	i disable it with now success
2012-01-02T14:29:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 is eth0 the only interface other than lo0
2012-01-02T14:30:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	nope
2012-01-02T14:30:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	do we talk on the configuration before i log in or something else?
2012-01-02T14:31:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 i was just wondering if you are perhaps trying to get an ip address from the wrong card, as in if you have more than one network card available
2012-01-02T14:32:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	i really don`t need to worry about this on previous version of ubuntu there were no such thing u just need to disable it
2012-01-02T14:33:00.000Z	Fudge	ajah	 disable the init script then with the above update-rc.d networking remove command
2012-01-02T14:35:00.000Z	ajah	Fudge	sudo update-rc.d networking remove -f
