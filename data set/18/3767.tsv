2010-01-25T22:29:00.000Z	The_ManU_212		i've seen that in my music collection all mp3 files had the x-bit for execution, i recursively removed it but then i had no permission for subfodlers too, so i added the x bit for directories manually
2010-01-25T22:30:00.000Z	trism	The_ManU_212	I find: find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} + ; to be useful in that situation, it will only change the files not folders
2010-01-25T22:30:00.000Z	The_ManU_212		my questions are, is it ok to remove the xbit for mp3 files and add it for directories? is there an option to exclude dirs from permission changes, and can i save files from being deleted but i have the right to add files in fodlers and change existing files? (only deletion is  not possible)?
2010-01-25T22:38:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	thx and can u help me with my other 2 questions?
2010-01-25T22:40:00.000Z	trism	The_ManU_212	I don't understand what you're asking in the last one
2010-01-25T22:42:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	1st: is it ok to remove the x-bit from mp3 files and adding it to directories (if removed) to open them?
2010-01-25T22:42:00.000Z	trism	The_ManU_212	yes, it is actually a good idea, don't want files being executable that shouldn't be
2010-01-25T22:43:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	2nd: is with it possible with rights-managment, to allow creation of files and editing existing oens, but to delete them is denied?
2010-01-25T22:43:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	what could be the reason that they were executable, that they were some time ago on fat32 aprtition?
2010-01-25T22:44:00.000Z	trism	The_ManU_212	you probably copied them from a windows partition, they are mounted by default as 777 (I had to do the same with my music collection)
2010-01-25T22:45:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	yeah the fat was mounted rw
2010-01-25T22:45:00.000Z	trism	The_ManU_212	as for the other question, I'm really an expert on permissions, although I think if you have permissions to create files in a directory, you have permission to delete them too, one goes with the other
2010-01-25T22:45:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	ok
2010-01-25T22:45:00.000Z	trism	The_ManU_212	that should be not an expert
2010-01-25T22:46:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	trism	what shouldnt be an expert?
2010-01-25T22:46:00.000Z	The_ManU_212		thx Enigmator
