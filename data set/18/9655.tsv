2007-03-11T08:29:00.000Z	allyer		the md5sum?
2007-03-11T08:29:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	go to the cdrom mount point and do md5sum -c md5sum.txt to see if anything fails
2007-03-11T08:33:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	on the page you got the image there's an MD5SUM file
2007-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	sorry, on the CD image, there's the file md5sum.txt which has md5 of all other files
2007-03-11T08:35:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	execute "md5sum -c md5sum.txt "
2007-03-11T08:36:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	i mean do that in the cd's mount point
2007-03-11T08:38:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	after you burned the disk, that's the only way i know to check integrity, other than boot it and do CD Test
2007-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	i have a samsung HD1600JJ works fine
2007-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	Rooy	allyer	have you checked md5sum of files on the burned disk?
