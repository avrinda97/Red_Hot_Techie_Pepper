2007-12-19T00:55:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	mine does the same.  I run "luvcview -d /dev/video1" and click the 'reset to defaults' button
2007-12-19T00:55:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	ill give it a try
2007-12-19T00:56:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	it says it cannot find the command
2007-12-19T00:56:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	install it
2007-12-19T00:56:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	sudo apt-get install lucview cannot find it.
2007-12-19T00:58:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	I got it here I think: http://packages.debian.org/luvcview
2007-12-19T00:58:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	thank you
2007-12-19T00:58:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	got the source and built it myself
2007-12-19T00:58:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	I don't know how well the debian packages would work
2007-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	it gives me the following error: http://rafb.net/p/FJqFEV76.html
2007-12-19T01:03:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	do you have some other cam app connected?
2007-12-19T01:03:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	luvcview wants to be the only one
2007-12-19T01:03:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	which others could be messing with it?
2007-12-19T01:05:00.000Z	dooglus	midgetnator	I don't understand how ubuntu works with webcams at all.  I tried 10 or so apps and luvcview was the only on I could get to work.  I guess your mileage is different :(
2007-12-19T01:06:00.000Z	midgetnator	dooglus	thank you .. ill google for it
