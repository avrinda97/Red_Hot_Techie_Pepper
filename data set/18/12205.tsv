2006-05-14T08:45:00.000Z	hollowlife1987		um...how would it know where the start of the drive to use and the end without a partion table
2006-05-14T08:45:00.000Z	hollowlife1987		even if you have one partion it puts it in the mbr
2006-05-14T08:46:00.000Z	hollowlife1987		thats a partion
2006-05-14T08:46:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	are you trying to say something ?
2006-05-14T08:50:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	so does a floppy disk have a partition table ?
2006-05-14T08:59:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	if you were trying to ask why grub cant install itself to the mbr of a drive it can
2006-05-14T09:01:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	i wasnt. asking that.  i was asking why with my root /  on /dev/hda  grub-install /dev/hda  fails.   even if i swap the drives around and make / dev/hdc  and try grub-install /dev/hda  it still fails.     so i was wondering why grub can't use whole disks like lilo can.
2006-05-14T09:04:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	when you install lilo to /dev/hda it installs to the master boot record
2006-05-14T09:07:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	'grub-install /dev/hda' SHOULD work, if not somethings wrong
2006-05-14T09:10:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	then i'd say something is wrong.
2006-05-14T09:10:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	are you doing 'sudo grub-install /dev/hda'
2006-05-14T09:36:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	how old is that document on grub you pointed me to ?
2006-05-14T09:39:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	the manual i pointed you too was last updated almost a year ago
2006-05-15T14:39:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	what do you mean by that?
2006-05-15T14:39:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	just what i asked,   am i the only one that ever did that ?
2006-05-15T14:40:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	you do know that you can mkfs /dev/hda  and have a filesystem on the disk without any partition,  don't you ?
2006-05-15T14:42:00.000Z	hollowlife1987	intelikey	any reasoning behind it?
2006-05-15T14:42:00.000Z	intelikey	hollowlife1987	it is very buggy.   don't try it with anything you dont want to loose.
