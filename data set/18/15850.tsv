2005-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i thought the whole point of having things like /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin was that i could compile from source without fear of mucking up packaged stuff.
2005-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		is it inadvisible to compile things yourself in debian/ubuntu?
2005-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		this is causing me a huge headache.
2005-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		oh my gawd
2005-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		they can't co-exist?!
2005-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		doesn't that defeat the whole point of /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin?
2005-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	the advice is to compile up to a package..
2005-10-02T08:11:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	there should be, but how?
2005-10-02T08:14:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	This device is not created when the USB Harddrive is used.
2005-10-02T08:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	pschulz01	hmm..
2005-10-02T08:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	pschulz01	i get that with my dap actually.  /dev/sda1
2005-10-02T08:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	pschulz01	i'm going to reboot just for the heck of it.  i plugged the camera in before i had loaded usb_storage and sd_mod so that could have done something.  who knows..
2005-10-02T08:15:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	I'm going to plug in the USB HDD, create the 'sda1' device (maj 8, min 1) and see if I can mount via that.
2005-10-02T08:17:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	No luck... mount: sda1 is not a valid block device
2005-10-02T08:31:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	The USB HDD looks to be a problem with the disk itself.
2005-10-02T08:32:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	pschulz01	with the actual camera?
2005-10-02T08:33:00.000Z	pschulz01	BROKEN_LADDER	Soorry.. this is with the HDD, not camera.
2005-10-02T08:34:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	pschulz01	what did the problem appear to be with the hdd.
