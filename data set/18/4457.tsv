2010-07-17T00:34:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	...or start the application that doesn't work from the shell using "pasuspend nameofgame"
2010-07-17T00:35:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	try pasuspend first, it helps with applications that can't talk to a sound server and will allow them to talk to the audio card directly.
2010-07-17T00:36:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	hang on, let me see what package has that command.
2010-07-17T00:38:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	packages.ubuntu.com claims it never heard of it, which is a lie. I deinstalled pulseaudio (because of an incompatible application that I use a lot), so I can't check locally, but I think it was in pulseaudio-utils
2010-07-17T00:39:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	ah, correct, pulseaudio-utils it is, but the command is called "pasuspender" (note the "er" at the end).
2010-07-17T00:41:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	find the command used to start your game, let's say /usr/games/mygame, then start it using "pasuspender /usr/games/mygame" and see if you got audio. If yes, great. If not, kick computer.
2010-07-17T00:48:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	good catch!
2010-07-17T00:48:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	OpenAL is an audio library. Whatever that means. I bet it's related to not having... audio.
2010-07-17T00:49:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	best case would be that the game is just missing a dependency (ie. a hint to automagically install a certain package). Then you would just have to find that package and install it.
2010-07-17T00:49:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	perhaps "sudo apt-get install libopenal1"?
2010-07-17T00:50:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	best case: it installs something. worse case: it tells you the package is already installed and up-to-date.
2010-07-17T00:52:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	excellent. If you want to spare others this pain, report "missing dependency for libopenal1" as a bug for the game.
2010-07-17T00:54:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	somewhere around here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ - but there's probably also a local Ubuntu command and someone can tell a bot to explain it to us.
2010-07-17T00:55:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	so it's "ubuntu-bug alien-arena"
2010-07-17T00:56:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	no, enter as a command: ubuntu-bug alien-arena - and then answer a few questions.
2010-07-17T00:56:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	...and then enjoy the game. :)
2010-07-17T01:00:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	yoshie	my pleasure
