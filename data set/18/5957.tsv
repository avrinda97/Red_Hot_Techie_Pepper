2008-07-26T01:05:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	I think  you could define it in fstab, that a user can mount
2008-07-26T01:05:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	actually ntfs-3g doesn't look at fstab as i've been told by the internet, but i've done it anyways just in case
2008-07-26T01:06:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	[to no effect]
2008-07-26T01:06:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	you can define it in  fstab for shure
2008-07-26T01:07:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	well, here's my fstab: /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g user,noauto,rw 0 0
2008-07-26T01:08:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	o.k.
2008-07-26T01:08:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	what's that big number?
2008-07-26T01:10:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	ok, but i don't think that's the problem, it mounts fine when i sudo it, but then i don't have the access i'd like
2008-07-26T01:11:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	 o.k. I'm not 100% shure, a user can mount
2008-07-26T01:12:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	hmmmmmm, not the strength i was looking for, hahaha. alright, i'll keep trying stuff
2008-07-26T01:12:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	 but I thought the user parm is for that
2008-07-26T01:12:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	sorry, I mount it when system starts.-)
2008-07-26T01:12:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	yeah, but ntfs-3g is dumb and does it's own thing
2008-07-26T01:16:00.000Z	pogay	jazzwhiz	 what error do you get? may be a user can mount, but he has no access rights. I had issues with sshfs like this
2008-07-26T01:16:00.000Z	jazzwhiz	pogay	nah, i'm pretty sure it's an ntfs-3g thing, i'll paste
