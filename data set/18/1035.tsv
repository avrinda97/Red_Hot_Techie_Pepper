2011-06-25T11:00:00.000Z	NBFlyacker		my buddy has an  older AMD 64 machine, but only has an AGP port on his mother board.  What is the best AGP card he can get to support unity?
2011-06-25T11:01:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	##hardware is more appropriate, but the best agp card one can get is a radeon 4670, however many many other agp cards are good enough too
2011-06-25T11:04:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	why wouldn't it work? not even with the nvidia restricted drivers?
2011-06-25T11:05:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	any DX9 capable card then should work fine
2011-06-25T11:07:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	It wouldn't.   We tried restricted drivers and without.  When we first loaded his machine it said that because of his hardware it couldn't use unity and reverted back to the Gnome desktop.  3d is still enabled though, because it is showing the default flashes when he clicks on fire fox, and such.
2011-06-25T11:07:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	check glxinfo if it's enabled, not firefox
2011-06-25T11:09:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 I'm fairly new myself.  I converted when Natty came out.  How would I do that?  I didn't have any issues when I switched.
2011-06-25T11:09:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	glxinfo |grep direct
2011-06-25T11:10:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 let me check.
2011-06-25T11:10:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 we just tried it.  It said yes.
2011-06-25T11:12:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 Since it booted him into Gnome when we first installed, do we need to go back to the login screen and change it to Unity?  Maybe it didn't think unity would work after the initial login?
2011-06-25T11:14:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	gf4200 is a dx8 card and has no proper shaders IIRC (dunno the opengl equivalent right now), so that's why it might not work with unity. any DX9 card which means any radeon 9xxx or later or any gf5xxx or later. maybe look at the ubuntu HCL
2011-06-25T11:16:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 thank you.  We'll check it out.  One other question.  Since the rendering is working and we installed compiz config manger, would he still be able to get the "burn effect"?  It's not showing up either, but we can change other things.  Its just not showing up as an option at all.
2011-06-25T11:16:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	considering how cheap DX10 cards are, better get one of those tho. no use to buy the oldes stuff available
2011-06-25T11:17:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	dunno what this special effect needs.
2011-06-25T11:17:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 DX = "Direct X"?
2011-06-25T11:18:00.000Z	wols_	NBFlyacker	yes. no card maker really cares about opengl, so if you go shopping you need to check DirectX versions supported. cause that'S what they tell you
2011-06-25T11:18:00.000Z	NBFlyacker	wols_	 Awesome.  Thank you for you help.
