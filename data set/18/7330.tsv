2012-02-14T18:13:00.000Z	ubernoob		hi, is it normal for VirtualBox to take ages to install an OS from disc? I'm only 3% of the way through an installation of PCBSD9 and it seems to be dragging on inordinately. I did select a lot of packages but, I think there should have been more progress than this.
2012-02-14T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	did you MD5 test the ISO too?
2012-02-14T18:14:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	nope, I downloaded it from their mirror and burned it to a disc without doing any checks. I don't think there's anything wrong with the image as such.
2012-02-14T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	then how did you know the ISO was complete and consistent?
2012-02-14T18:15:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	good point but tbh I've never burnt an image from there or ubuntu or debian that wasn't working perfectly.
2012-02-14T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	if you don't use torrents, the data needs to be checked so you know the data isn't damaged
2012-02-14T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	I'd give it a while but I'd check the ISO
2012-02-14T18:17:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	I'll keep that in mind, once this installation completes/falls over.
2012-02-14T18:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	urbanterror :0
2012-02-14T18:27:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	is that a fps of some sort?
2012-02-14T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	it is, is counterstrike like but based on the unreal engine :)
2012-02-14T18:29:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	sounds like good fun. Will it work well on an old athlon x2 with an Nvidia GT400 gfx card?
2012-02-14T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	runs well on my GF6150LE onboard
2012-02-14T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	with single core sempron am2 @ 1.6Ghz and 2Gb DDR2
2012-02-14T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	did you check if it was cmpatible on the virtualbox website?
2012-02-14T21:06:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	nope, I checked in the help files within VirtualBox
2012-02-14T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubernoob	i suggest you check stuff before takinbg on projects, as wel as test ISOs
2012-02-14T21:07:00.000Z	ubernoob	ActionParsnip	I should do that, yes.
