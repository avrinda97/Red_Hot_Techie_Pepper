2005-03-10T07:16:00.000Z	Blues-Man		is there a debina cd ..only one?

2005-03-10T07:18:00.000Z	Blues-Man		openbsd is too difficulut for me :)
2005-03-10T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Blues-Man	should work with debian minimal install + say fluxbox or openbox (maybe windowmaker)
2005-03-10T07:19:00.000Z	Blues-Man	thoreauputic	so can I use ubuntu cd do that?
2005-03-10T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Blues-Man	don't know - probably with a custom install : it's just the debian sarge installer, basically
2005-03-10T07:21:00.000Z	Blues-Man	thoreauputic	if true could you link me plaese?
