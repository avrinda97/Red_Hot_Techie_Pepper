2010-03-13T20:30:00.000Z	abhifx_		hi there! i am having a major problem while installing nvidia drivers. can someone help me plz?
2010-03-13T20:30:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2010-03-13T20:31:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	its a bit long to explain
2010-03-13T20:31:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	summarize it in one line and provide relevant details in pastebin
2010-03-13T20:33:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	Lazy^ and it didnt worked because of wrong kernel version. now even if i install correct drivers, it wont work
2010-03-13T20:33:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	if you're using lucid, this is not the right channel.  Lucid is in development
2010-03-13T20:34:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	i am on karmic
2010-03-13T20:35:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	didn't you just say you used lucid repos?
2010-03-13T20:36:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	only if you answer questions...
2010-03-13T20:36:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	yes, but i didnt do a complete distro upgrade
2010-03-13T20:37:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	... because if you upgraded with lucid repos, you probably have a pretty broken system at this point
2010-03-13T20:37:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	just my nvidia drivers are not working
2010-03-13T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	read what I just said
2010-03-13T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	just adding lucid repos to a karmic repository and running upgrades is a recipe for disaster
2010-03-13T20:39:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	i havent done any upgrades, just few softwares. my mistake was to using the nvidia drivers
2010-03-13T20:39:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	"i havent done any upgrades, just few softwares" -- softwares with dependencies
2010-03-13T20:40:00.000Z	abhifx_	jrib	thx for listning
2010-03-13T20:44:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx_	if you have some sort of hybrid karmic-lucid install at the moment, I would recommend you just reinstall and not mix repositories like that anymore
