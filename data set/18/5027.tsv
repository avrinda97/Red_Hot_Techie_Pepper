2009-12-17T04:52:00.000Z	grandrew		hi all! how can I find what packages are libGLU and libGLCore in? I have a mess with open/proprietary drivers :-(
2009-12-17T04:52:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	apt-cache show
2009-12-17T04:54:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	no package named libGL
2010-03-03T00:20:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	what does htop report ?
2010-03-03T00:23:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	cat /proc/meminfo
2010-03-03T00:23:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	last line saying ?
2010-03-03T00:25:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	DirectMap2M:           0 kB  DirectMap4k:     2805120 kB
2010-03-03T00:26:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	so it's there, htop is nice for it's sorting function, look what's eating up there
2010-03-03T00:26:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	hmm that sounds different from my another machine which has different things there :-\
2010-03-03T00:27:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	you mean that some kernel-level task is eating memory?
2010-03-03T00:36:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	do you use shared memory for graphics or a ramdisk ?
2010-03-03T00:40:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	I guess not.. gfx memory shows 124 MB. How can I figure out if there is a ramdisk?
2010-03-03T00:40:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	htop says ?
2010-03-03T00:41:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	htop says nothing about where my memory has gone :-( just 328/1304MB in Mem row
2010-03-03T00:43:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	and you say there are ~2.6 g installed, whille free reports just the half ? checking syslog or even memtest for faulty / unmatching stripes (timings?)
2010-03-03T00:45:00.000Z	grandrew	DasEi	the most intersting part is that dmesg says: [    0.000000] Memory: 2665604k/2813312k available. So it seems that kernel does really find it but does not make it available for userspace
2010-03-03T00:46:00.000Z	DasEi	grandrew	and the amounts in meminfo ? maybe paste it
