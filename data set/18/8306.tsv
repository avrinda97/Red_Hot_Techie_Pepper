2007-09-07T14:21:00.000Z	vreer		huh? afeter upgrading breezy to feisty Xorg.0.log says "failed to load module "i810" (module doesn't exist,0)
2007-09-07T14:22:00.000Z	vreer		tho under Breezy it did work
2007-09-07T14:22:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	did you first upgrade to edgy?
2007-09-07T14:22:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	 no
2007-09-07T14:23:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	you probably miss a whole lot of stuff. better to re-install faisty.
2007-09-07T14:23:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	kinda difficult: I have no cd player
2007-09-07T14:23:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	how about re-installing ubuntu-desktop? see if you get more packages to install.
2007-09-07T14:24:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	 will try
2007-09-07T14:24:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	otherwise I think the package name is xserver-xorg-video-i810
2007-09-07T14:25:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	 will check :)
2007-09-07T14:33:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	that message was for me?
2007-09-07T14:35:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	 yes
2007-09-07T14:35:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	what is eepro100? ;)
2007-09-07T14:36:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	see if network-admin sees it.
2007-09-07T14:38:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	can't use it; X doens't work
2007-09-07T14:40:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	ok. I'm trying to help but I can't say I'm too optimistic about it since I don't think your upgrade went well at all. you probably need to load the module for it. to see which driver you need to modprobe see here: http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
2007-09-07T14:42:00.000Z	Jowi	vreer	I would try to borrow an external cd drive and install feisty from scratch...
2007-09-07T14:47:00.000Z	vreer	Jowi	lke I thought - i need eepro100 or ee100; eepro100 is inserted en listed in lsmod
