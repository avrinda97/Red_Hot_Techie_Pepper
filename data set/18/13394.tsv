2006-11-09T12:48:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	you could manually install a minimal ubuntu system
2006-11-09T12:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	that done, though i cant find a good way of turning it into a workng live system
2006-11-09T12:49:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	install the minimal metapackage I think it was
2006-11-09T12:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	live=bootable cd
2006-11-09T13:00:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	ahhhhh you really want to pare down the livecd?  I see
2006-11-09T12:52:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	chroot into the target after debootstrap and apt-get install ubuntu-minimal
2006-11-09T12:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	im sorry, but i dont see how that is going to help me... say i mount, extract and chroot the live cd image, how is installing ubuntu-minimal going to give me a smaller system?
2006-11-09T12:53:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	wait, are you trying to make a livecd or are you trying to get a very small installation base on the hard disk?
2006-11-09T12:55:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	a live cd :)
2006-11-09T12:55:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e06
2006-11-09T12:55:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	thats what ive been trying, but things go pearshaped...
2006-11-09T12:59:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	stripping down the obvious packages from the live cd still turns out to be to big, and hunting and findigt all the thousands of tiny packages that make up all that extra weight is several days of work. changing the system in the squashfs file to the one ive got working on a virtual hdd fails to boot :)
2006-11-09T13:01:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	then it sounds like you need to build your own livecd from scratch, rather than modify the existing one
2006-11-10T11:15:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	but i wasnt sure she was using gnome ;)
2006-11-10T11:16:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	not in xfce, fluxbox or icewm ;)
2006-12-13T15:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	might you know of a good way to defragment jfs2 filesystems?
2006-12-13T15:43:00.000Z	psusi	nolimitsoya	I don't know much about jfs, sorry...
2006-12-13T15:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	psusi	ok, thank you anyways :)
