2009-06-09T17:34:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	Does the user still need to be able to ssh in to the server in question?
2009-06-09T17:35:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	ssh in, but no shell.. i 'disabled' the shell by replacing bash with cat.. my goal is to have it just do port forwarding
2009-06-09T17:36:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	Then change the user's shell to, "/bin/false" and that should take care of it.
2009-06-09T17:37:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	i've tried that.. won't that just close the session? i want it open for port forwarding
2009-06-09T17:38:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	That disables interactive login shell for the user.  Works to also keep them from using sftp.
2009-06-09T17:38:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	Explain the port forwarding bit.  What are you trying to do?
2009-06-09T17:39:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	well, you know how you can use ssh to do port tunneling*.. forwarding might have been the wrong word.. i want the user to be able to do tunneling
2009-06-09T17:39:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	just not shell or sftp
2009-06-09T17:39:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	I see.  That complicates things...
2009-06-09T17:41:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	i know i can just disable sftp altogether.. there's no way to do it per user?
2009-06-09T17:41:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	or even, enable it per user
2009-06-09T17:42:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	I've never had a requirement to do that so not sure.  Google may turn up something though.
2009-06-09T17:42:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	i've been googling :)
2009-06-09T17:42:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	I'll join you and if I come up with any suggestions, I'll post back...
2009-06-09T17:43:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	thanks
2009-06-09T17:54:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	Not turning up much here.  But although I cannot swear to it, I thought I was able to do ssh tunneling with the user's shell set to /bin/false.
2009-06-09T17:54:00.000Z	rob_p	cyphase	I gave up ssh tunneling when I discovered openvpn...
2009-06-09T17:55:00.000Z	cyphase	rob_p	maybe there's an option to leave it open..
