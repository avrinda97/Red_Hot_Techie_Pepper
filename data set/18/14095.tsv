2006-11-04T06:00:00.000Z	MattJ		Is XDMCP secure?
2006-11-04T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	XDMCP uses UDP, so you can't really do it from the internet
2006-11-04T06:03:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	you could tunnel it through something like ssh, which would also make it secure

2006-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	braddockbr, no.
2006-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	?
2006-11-13T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	it does, he must not have build-essential installed
2006-11-13T16:04:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	erm... why?
2006-11-13T16:04:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	I have it...
2006-11-13T16:05:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	right, he doesn't have b-e installed
2006-11-13T16:06:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	I thought you just said...??!?!
2006-11-13T16:06:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	What?
2006-11-13T16:07:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	I thought you were saying he shouldn't have build-essential
2006-11-13T16:07:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	I told him to install it
2006-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	I said nothing of the sort.  Just that he doesn't necessarily need it.  He should have it.  He shouldn't symlink to get around him not having gcc
2006-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	Yeah well, I said do that if build-essential didn't :) I'm surprised the gcc package doesn't
2006-11-13T16:09:00.000Z	Flannel	MattJ	gcc package does, gcc4.1 package doesnt
2006-11-13T16:09:00.000Z	MattJ	Flannel	Ah, I see
