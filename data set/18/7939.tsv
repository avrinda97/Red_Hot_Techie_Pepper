2007-10-23T12:57:00.000Z	skiff		hey guys anyone knows how to make ATI x1950 work in 7.10 with restricted drivers, I tried the forums and nothing works :////
2007-10-23T12:59:00.000Z	mao42	skiff	I had a lot of difficulty getting them to work properly. I first installed the drivers via the updater with Ubuntu, then used Envy, then made a clean xorg.conf, did a sudo aticonfig --initial, and restarted
2007-10-23T12:59:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	whats envy?
2007-10-23T12:59:00.000Z	mao42	skiff	I'm using an x1650, dunno how it'd fair on your card.
2007-10-23T13:00:00.000Z	mao42	skiff	A script for installing the latest video drivers
2007-10-23T13:01:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	do you mind if I msg you here ?
2007-10-23T13:02:00.000Z	mao42	skiff	If you want to avoid Envy, try installing from the binary installers directly from AMD ATI
2007-10-23T13:03:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	thas what I did now
2007-10-23T13:03:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	unfortunately it didnt work
2007-10-23T13:03:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	I see UBUNTU loading screen, then the black screen
2007-10-23T13:04:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	could it be something to do with the dual monitors?
2007-10-23T13:04:00.000Z	mao42	skiff	No idea, but try getting just one of them to work for now
2007-10-23T13:06:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	I need to restore my old xorg.conf for now lol
2007-10-23T13:06:00.000Z	mao42	skiff	Good idea. ATI cards on linux suck, it's sad.
2007-10-23T13:07:00.000Z	skiff	mao42	have you followed any guide or something to do what you did I need more detailed instructions
