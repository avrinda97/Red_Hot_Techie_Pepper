2008-03-06T07:26:00.000Z	cellofellow		hello. I'm having a bit of trouble with Firestarter.
2008-03-06T07:27:00.000Z	cellofellow		I have a laptop, so I want to lock it down while on the road, but NetworkManager scews around with Firestarter. Firestarter refuses to start at boot, for one. It also complains about my two NIC's (one Wireless using NDISWrapper, the other is a regular onboard Ethernet.)
2008-03-06T07:29:00.000Z	cellofellow		ok, this makes sense
2008-03-06T07:29:00.000Z	cellofellow		but I'm thinking that the firestarter daemon does something special. Does it set up the iptables stuff?
2008-03-06T07:30:00.000Z	cellofellow		I have usplash disabled, so I see my init output, and firestarter fails when booting.
2008-03-06T07:31:00.000Z	cellofellow		Firestarter I don't like. I wish there was a slightly smarter firewall for linux.
2008-03-06T07:32:00.000Z	cellofellow		I mean, why does it have to interface dependant? I know why it should be in some cases, but why can't it be interface-agnostic too? (So as to protect on both eth0 and wlan0)?
2008-03-06T07:33:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	man iptables, have fun
2008-03-06T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	use iptables
2008-03-06T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	if the dinky front end doesn't do it, use the real thing
2008-03-06T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	static?
2008-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	cellofellow	bruenig	set the conf file, and it can't dynamically adapt to needs. Static. I might be wrong, maybe being dynamic is a bad thing.
2008-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	how does it know what needs are
2008-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	where does it get this information?
2008-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	cellofellow	bruenig	I get it.
2008-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	so you want the yet to be contrived off omniscient firewall
2008-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	cellofellow	perhaps there is a firewall that has a conf file that you just type "do good stuff" in it and it works
2008-03-06T07:38:00.000Z	cellofellow	bruenig	please cut the sarcasm. I get it, ok? I'm not a newb, at least with most things. iptables I'm a little woozy of.
