2005-06-30T14:44:00.000Z	Yuki-San		doesn anyone here run a ununtu server, so if i run into trouble they can maybe help me ^^
2005-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	lots of people run Ubuntu as some sort of server
2005-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	like all *.ubuntu.com domains :)
2005-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	I use it as server too :)
2005-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	makes no difference for servers :)
2005-06-30T14:56:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	if you want to run both the gui and some services, you should just use the standard install
2005-06-30T14:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	if you want a machine without GUI, type server as boot option
2005-06-30T14:57:00.000Z	Yuki-San	Seveas	i did
2005-06-30T14:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	then you'll just have to install the services you want :D
2005-06-30T14:58:00.000Z	Yuki-San	Seveas	or something similar
2005-06-30T14:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	you are missing some clue here :)
2005-06-30T14:58:00.000Z	Yuki-San	Seveas	t ejected the cd and is doing a bunch of stuff now
2005-06-30T14:58:00.000Z	Yuki-San	Seveas	eha?
2005-06-30T14:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	then you'll just have to aptitude install apache2 after the thing has setup the base systen
2005-06-30T15:00:00.000Z	Yuki-San	Seveas	eh? whats that?
2005-06-30T15:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	the command 'aptitude install apache2' will install apache 2
2005-06-30T15:02:00.000Z	Yuki-San	Seveas	it's pluged into a router, can i check with that?
2005-06-30T15:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Yuki-San	what wants to be root?
