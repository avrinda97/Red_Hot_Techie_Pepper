2007-10-03T14:04:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	i am also using vlc, i never had problems with cpu (other than the obvious speed lack problems with my 1800+ amd for hd)
2007-10-03T14:05:00.000Z	ardin	ProN00b	ok, let me explain this slowly. the files i'm having problems with ARENT HD. the ones that i wasnt having problems with, ARE HD
2007-10-03T14:05:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	yes, i understood that the first time, that is why i said i never had problems like that
2007-10-03T14:06:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	as you can see i said i had problems with hd
2007-10-03T14:06:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	what is your cpu and more importantly graphics processor ?
2007-10-03T14:06:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	and where are you playing the files from ?
2007-10-03T14:07:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	and the cpu and gpu ?
2007-10-03T14:08:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	got hardware acceleration enabled in the blob driver manager ?
2007-10-03T14:10:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	sorry, its "Restricted Drivers Manager"
2007-10-03T14:11:00.000Z	ardin	ProN00b	if by that, you mean am i using nvidia's x server, yes, i set that up first thing after installing
2007-10-03T14:11:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	nvidias x server ?
2007-10-03T14:13:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	i could suggest you get mplayer and play with its -vo (video output) commandline parameter to see if there are problems with only some ways of displaying or if it is a vlc problem completely; also are you on a 64bit platform ?
2007-10-03T14:14:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	mplayer has the same problem/problems ?
2007-10-03T14:15:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	well, did you try mplayers -vo option ?
2007-10-03T14:15:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	well, try others x11, gl, gl2
2007-10-03T14:16:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	also watch mplayers output, does it tell you that your machine is too slow to play the media
2007-10-03T14:17:00.000Z	ardin	ProN00b	 yes, which is strange, because the same machine worked fine under windows
2007-10-03T14:18:00.000Z	ProN00b	ardin	try the other vo options, also try a null sound output or null video renderer and see if either fixes the problem
