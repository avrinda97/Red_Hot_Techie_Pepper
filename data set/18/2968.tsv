2010-01-17T04:48:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	right click on the little speaker on the top right of the screen and hit sound preferences... navigate to the hardware tab

2010-01-17T04:52:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	then you hit the profile button at the bottom and you can switch between the installed sound systems
2010-01-17T04:53:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	If I'm correct :)
2010-01-17T04:55:00.000Z	Dextronaught	Thunder_Drop	when I open Firefox, whichever runs first (Java or Flash), only 1 of them can have sound, or else I need to restart the browser. I'm not sure if you know what I mean. This is on Karmic. Is this typical? any fix?
2010-01-17T04:56:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	so whichever gets used first is the only one that can funtion untill firefox is restarted?
2010-01-17T04:58:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	Do you have the newest versions of firefox, java and shockwave?
2010-01-17T05:00:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	try hitting tools add-ons and then go to the plug-in tab... from there see if there are multiple versions of either flash or java enabled... try disabling everything except for the two that you want to use and see if the problem persists
2010-01-17T05:03:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	see if the problem still exists when everything is disabled except the two you want to use
2010-01-17T05:07:00.000Z	Dextronaught	Thunder_Drop	no fix
2010-01-17T05:09:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	well the only suggestion that I can give you is that I currently have java and shockwave flash running at the same time.  I do not think that your problem is from within linux but within firefox itself.  To eliminate the possiblity of it being a linux issue you could use a different browser and see if the problem still exists
2010-01-17T05:10:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	from without a browser?
2010-01-17T05:12:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Dextronaught	pulseaudio is not used by default if I'm correct so uninstalling it will just force every application to use the default
