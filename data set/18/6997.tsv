2008-05-21T22:46:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	did you choose a picture for your account?
2008-05-21T22:46:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	and in gdmsetup
2008-05-21T22:47:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	did you choose theme with face?
2008-05-21T22:47:00.000Z	lun4tic	pen_	of course... i'm not stupid
2008-05-21T22:48:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	do you have chosen a picture for your account?
2008-05-21T22:49:00.000Z	lun4tic	pen_	yes
2008-05-21T22:49:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	have you tried the default face theme? the blue one
2008-05-21T22:50:00.000Z	lun4tic	pen_	yes i tried the whole list
2008-05-21T22:50:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	did you say it doesn't choose the face theme?
2008-05-21T22:54:00.000Z	lun4tic	pen_	the theme can be selected but when gdm shows up i have no users to select
2008-05-21T22:55:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	is it the same one you choose?
2008-05-21T22:55:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	maybe  you accidentally choose random from selected
2008-05-21T22:56:00.000Z	pen_	lun4tic	have you tried human list theme?
