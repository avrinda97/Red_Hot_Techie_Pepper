2006-06-16T16:05:00.000Z	krazykit	eclypse	apt-get it, kill the current one, run the new one.
2006-06-16T16:05:00.000Z	eclypse	krazykit	I'm kind of a noob at this so, how exactly would I kill one, and what is the name of the package of a window manager
2006-06-16T16:06:00.000Z	krazykit	eclypse	well, the window manager is up to you.  you'd open a console, `killall metacity && $window manager`
2006-06-16T16:08:00.000Z	krazykit	eclypse	as long as you don't save the session, it shouldn't.
2006-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	eclypse	krazykit	what do yu mean save the session?
2006-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	krazykit	eclypse	when you log out, there should be a checkmark that says "save this session".  make sure it's unchecked
2006-06-16T16:10:00.000Z	krazykit	eclypse	um, it saves what all programs are running, and runs them again next time you log in
2006-06-16T16:26:00.000Z	krazykit	eclypse	because most users don't need to build software?
