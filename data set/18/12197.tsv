2006-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	osubuck		i don't want to have to burn another cd if possible
2006-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	osubuck		thanks
2006-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	change your repos /etc/apt/sources.list to point to dapper isn't of breezy
2006-05-14T14:37:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	/etc/fstab
2006-05-14T14:42:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	sudo cfdisk
2006-05-14T14:45:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	either permissions or you didn't mount it correctly
2006-05-14T14:45:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	add user,users in /etc/fstab options for windows mount
2006-05-14T14:47:00.000Z	osubuck	wendigo	 how do i do that
2006-05-14T14:47:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	sudo nano -w /etc/fstab
2006-05-14T14:48:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	you added windows mount in fstab already right?
2006-05-14T14:49:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	/dev/<partition name> /mnt/windows ntfs defaults,user,users,umask=000 0 0
2006-05-14T14:49:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	add line in fstab
2006-05-14T14:51:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	ok, paste the contents of your fstab in paste bin
2006-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	i don't use that script so i couldn't comment
2006-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	wendigo	osubuck	easier to hand edit :)
