2007-03-29T14:43:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: sorry tht should have read as I'm a testing a new driver, in place of old driver

2007-03-29T14:45:00.000Z	shirish		WaZ: tutorial for dpkg or what?
2007-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: I don't know. I just made a comment in https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-i810-modesetting/+bug/90213
2007-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: and there somebody has got a bleeding edge driver out
2007-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: the only thing I wanna know is what the overwrite flag is for, whether the driver works or not, tht's equally good. I can easily remove the old driver & do an apt-get for the older driver.
2007-03-29T14:48:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: I know but I don't want to lose Xserver till then, I wanna over-ride the conflict
