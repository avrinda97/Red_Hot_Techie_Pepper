2005-09-24T08:09:00.000Z	joseduenas_		I need a skype-like but with webcam support, do you know any?
2005-09-24T08:09:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	who do you need to be compatible with?
2005-09-24T08:10:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	gnomemeeting is compatible with netmeeting, and it looks like they're solving the issues with NAT
2005-09-24T08:11:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	but I need some without problems with NAT
2005-09-24T08:11:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	not yet
2005-09-24T08:11:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	who do you need to talk to?
2005-09-24T08:11:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	with another person who is also behind NAT
2005-09-24T08:12:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	what's wrong with skype?
2005-09-24T08:12:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	I want video
2005-09-24T08:12:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	can either of you get into the DMZ?
2005-09-24T08:13:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	no, is a student dorm (not access to router)
2005-09-24T08:13:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	if I could access I know what ports redirectr
2005-09-24T08:14:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	you might be able to get a more bleeding edge build of gnomemeeting with more support for rendevous/zeroconf/upnp/blah
2005-09-24T08:14:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	yes i know, I'll try to build a cvs version
2005-09-24T08:15:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	other than that it sounds like you're out of luck: roll on IPv6
2005-09-24T08:15:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	in my dreams... hehe
2005-09-24T08:16:00.000Z	djm62	joseduenas_	you're not in the same NAT-ed network or anything handy like that?
2005-09-24T08:17:00.000Z	joseduenas_	djm62	no
