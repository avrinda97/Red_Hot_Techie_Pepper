2009-05-05T12:09:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	then you are not using swap
2009-05-05T12:09:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	swapon -a
2009-05-05T12:10:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	first thing I tried after reboot :(
2009-05-05T12:11:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	are you sure cat /proc/swaps didn't give anything ?
2009-05-05T12:11:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	positive
2009-05-05T12:12:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	my fault; had forgotten the final s
2009-05-05T12:12:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	mzz same output as swapon -s
2009-05-05T12:12:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	so there is a swap..
2009-05-05T12:12:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	so whats the problem again ? :D
2009-05-05T12:13:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	with swappiness 100, it is not used
2009-05-05T12:13:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	so ?
2009-05-05T12:13:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	and no resume from hibernate :(
2009-05-05T12:13:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	aah
2009-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	mzz maybe its because your swap seems to be on an lvm ? .. does hibernate work wth that ?
2009-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	I am trying to overflow ram, but with swappiness 100 it still should start to use swap earlier
2009-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	it is really hard on modern systems to make the kernel use the fs swap .. I have never managed it :D
2009-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	luca__	duryodhan	could you please check with gparted what flags does your partition have?
2009-05-05T12:15:00.000Z	duryodhan	luca__	not on ubuntu right now
