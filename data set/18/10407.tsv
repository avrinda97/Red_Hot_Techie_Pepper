2007-09-10T12:50:00.000Z	Bakefy		bjornalf, I would really like to create a shortcut (link) to a folder so that I can easily drag things often.
2007-09-10T12:52:00.000Z	png	Bakefy	you can try smbfs and smbmount . example:  mount -t smbfs //ipaddress/folder  /home/Desktop/test
2007-09-10T12:52:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	oh sweet, that might work!
2007-09-10T12:52:00.000Z	png	Bakefy	first you ve install smbfs
2007-09-10T12:53:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	okay
2007-09-10T12:53:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	i might already have it... I can access the files.

2007-09-10T12:55:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	thanks!
2007-09-10T13:01:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	I am getting errors like "could not resolve mount point //192.168.1.6/xampp/"
2007-09-10T13:02:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	I also tried the computer name in place of the IP address.
2007-09-10T13:06:00.000Z	png	Bakefy	what does "smbclient //192.168.1.6/xampp/" says?
2007-09-10T13:07:00.000Z	Bakefy	png	Domain=[OFFICE]  OS=[Windows 5.1]  Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager]
