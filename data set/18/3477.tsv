2009-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	ibkanat		I want to upgrade my kernel is this the easiest way? http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2009-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	ibkanat		it fails on inserting my nvidia and vbox modules
2009-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	ibkanat		anyone know?
2009-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ibkanat	no, those kernels wont work for nvidia, etc
2009-12-22T09:12:00.000Z	ibkanat	ChogyDan	which ones will?
2009-12-22T09:12:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ibkanat	why do you want to upgrade your kernel?
2009-12-22T09:12:00.000Z	ibkanat		vbox performance on guest is terrible I improved it with a build but read that upgrade fixes
2009-12-22T09:13:00.000Z	ibkanat	ChogyDan	where should I look for a 64 bit build?
2009-12-22T09:13:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ibkanat	is it the 32bit kernel?   I know that is in lucid
2009-12-22T09:13:00.000Z	ibkanat		I would like 2.6.33
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ibkanat		http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/drm-next/current/
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ibkanat		?
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ibkanat		what are the drm and drm-next?
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ibkanat	I don't really know, but those mainline kernels won't work with the nvidia drivers.  You may be able to install the drivers manually, and virtualbox by grabbing it from the website
2009-12-22T09:15:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ibkanat	you could also try just installing the lucid kernel.  You could also just upgrade to lucid, but it is in the very early stages, and will suffer breakage
2009-12-22T09:16:00.000Z	ibkanat		is there another safe place to look for recent kernels?
2009-12-22T09:16:00.000Z	ibkanat	ChogyDan	is there a list of whats broke?
2009-12-22T09:16:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ibkanat	nope
