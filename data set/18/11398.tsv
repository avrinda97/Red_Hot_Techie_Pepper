2006-07-31T10:12:00.000Z	spring		just 1 more silly question, is ubuntu safe for commercial deployment of web app?? I spent so much time getting used to it, will be a shame if it's not
2006-07-31T10:14:00.000Z	spring		anyone got vmware running on ubuntu?
2006-07-31T10:14:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	yep
2006-07-31T10:15:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	depends on your computer i'm sure... vmware server works fine for me
2006-07-31T10:19:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	haven't run windows with subversion... but i've run windows under vmware and subversion on linux. then i had the windows clients connect to subversion through eclipse
2006-07-31T10:20:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	i've run subversion client on windows though.. and tortoise-svn
2006-07-31T10:20:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	running the subversion server on linux is the way to go
2006-07-31T10:26:00.000Z	spring	joshuapurcell	running subversion on win too slow compared with linux?
2006-07-31T10:29:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	i don't know if it's too slow, it's just that it seems subversion is more targeted for a UNIX-like host OS in my opinion. subversion server can make good use of the the permissions of a Linux filesystem, Linux system users, etc. it's just something I couldn't imagine running on Windows. it's an open-source server meant for an open source OS
2006-07-31T10:29:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	of course I guess there is an install for svn on windows... i wouldn't know that for sure though truthfully... never looked into it
2006-07-31T10:31:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	subversion.tigris.org says the server doesn't run on Windows
2006-07-31T10:31:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	look at bottom of downloads section where it mentions running the client on Windows
2006-07-31T10:31:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	first line in that section
2006-07-31T10:33:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	tortoise-svn rocks for windows, i use the eclipse plugin under Linux
2006-07-31T10:33:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	which also rocks
2006-07-31T10:34:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	subclipse.tigris.org
2006-07-31T10:35:00.000Z	spring	joshuapurcell	Thanks
2006-07-31T10:35:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	spring	np
