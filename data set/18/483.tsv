2012-01-31T04:00:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	ok, so this _is_ hardware raid.  what controller chipset?
2012-01-31T04:02:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	AMD SR5670 + SP5100
2012-01-31T04:02:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	if it sees the two drives individually, and you are intending to use hardware raid, then your controller is misconfigured
2012-01-31T04:03:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	Thank you, we will look into that to see.
2012-01-31T04:04:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	if you intend to use software raid, then you are basically all set, beside configuring md/dm-raid
2012-01-31T04:04:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	I know many of those raid controllers give you a chance to configure the controller when the machine boots
2012-01-31T04:05:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	That is where it was configured. I guess we messed up the configuration.
2012-01-31T04:05:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	yes, probably have it configured as JBOD right now
2012-01-31T04:07:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	We are looking around the controller and it shows as RAID1 and the gloriously translated: "There is no any JBOD disk"
2012-01-31T04:08:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	The configuration in the raid controller looks correct. Is there anything else that could be wrong?
2012-01-31T04:08:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	perhaps it is configured as two RAID1 each of size 1?
2012-01-31T04:08:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	does the raid configuration show the disks and that they are healthy?
2012-01-31T04:09:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	The controller shows only one raid array, then when you go into that array it shows the two disks.
2012-01-31T04:09:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	odd..  the controller should not (correct me if I'm wrong) expose the individual drives, only the composite arrays
2012-01-31T04:10:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	It's in the RAID controller configuration that it shows. In the BIOS it only shows up as one drive.
2012-01-31T04:11:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	WEIRD, but then in linux you see the individual drives as separate /dev/sdX blocks?
2012-01-31T04:12:00.000Z	pgib__	syddraf	and "fdisk -l" verifies that those blocks are the ones you think they are?
2012-01-31T04:12:00.000Z	syddraf	pgib__	Correct. /dev/sda is my thumb drive, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdbc are the 500GB drives.
