2008-06-17T09:03:00.000Z	kranklin		Why do i have artifacts in my virtual/psuedo terminal?
2008-06-17T09:03:00.000Z	kranklin		and when i shutdown
2008-06-17T09:03:00.000Z	kranklin		the terminals are unusable, but i can get back with ctrl atl f7
2008-06-17T09:03:00.000Z	kranklin		i think its somethign with the nvidia driver, (restricted) i see lines drawn down the screen
2008-06-17T09:04:00.000Z	kranklin		agent_bob: i don't know much about frame buffers, but that sounds right... how do i fix it?
2008-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	kranklin		agent_bob: ok, thanks for the tip
2008-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	philsf	kranklin	are you using a vga= parameter in grub?
2008-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	kranklin	philsf	how would i know?
2008-06-17T09:06:00.000Z	philsf	kranklin	did you ever edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, and add a parameter to change font/resolution in the console there?
2008-06-17T09:06:00.000Z	kranklin		i have edited it before, to remove the quiet and splash....
2008-06-17T09:07:00.000Z	kranklin	philsf	before hardy, i had to use a noapic / noirqlpoll for ubuntu to work

2008-06-17T09:08:00.000Z	philsf	kranklin	check if your kernel image lines have a vga= parameter, maybe if you change the parameter, it gets better.

2008-06-17T09:09:00.000Z	philsf	kranklin	you can see a list of the framebuffer modes for your hardware with sudo hwinfo --framebuffer
2008-06-17T09:09:00.000Z	kranklin	philsf	ok thanks, will try different values for it
