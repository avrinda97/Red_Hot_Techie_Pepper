2008-02-23T08:26:00.000Z	wease|		but the license is virtually non existent
2008-02-23T08:27:00.000Z	wease|		prince, no it isnt
2008-02-23T08:27:00.000Z	wease|		torvalds even says it isnt important to follow the license
2008-02-23T08:28:00.000Z	wease|		its just a statement
2008-02-23T08:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	wease|	well i don't know if you are referring to "linux" as only the kernel or as all the GPL software you have in your OS
2008-02-23T08:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	wease|	but the license is key to open source
2008-02-23T08:29:00.000Z	wease|	prince_jammys	i run open source and i disagree completely. the "license" is just a small agreement that you will do well to to the software and community in promoting changes and sharing said changes

2008-02-23T08:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	wease|	read the leaked MS documents that show how GPL ruins what would be their attempts at using, rebranding and closed-sourcing opensource software

Ubuntu wouldnt be around without it. so you can argue it is very important but it really is a very miniscule event when you call it a license.....it is a free agency license that a

2008-02-23T08:36:00.000Z	wease|	prince_jammys	exactly
2008-02-23T08:36:00.000Z	wease|	prince_jammys	anybody using open source keeps it as such. we're not talkin SCO
