2008-01-29T16:56:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	mount -t filesystem
2008-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	kaboombob	goodhabit	that didt do anything for me
2008-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	try to explaing what are you trying to do.
2008-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	do you know what filesystem there?
2008-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	kaboombob	goodhabit	nope
2008-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	what device is it?
2008-01-29T17:00:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	maybe player cannot be usable as normal flash-storage? Default flash fs can be mounted with "vfat"
2008-01-29T17:01:00.000Z	kaboombob	goodhabit	what would the command look like for that?
2008-01-29T17:02:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	$ sudo mount -t vfat /dev/??? /whatever/where/you/are/mounting

2008-01-29T17:13:00.000Z	kaboombob	goodhabit	how do i do that?
2008-01-29T17:14:00.000Z	goodhabit	kaboombob	because you may have troubles with gnome. system - administraton - users and groups.
