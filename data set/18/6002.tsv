2008-07-16T02:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	I know there's a better way to find out what driver you're using, but I usually just use compiz-check
2008-07-16T02:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	wget http://blogage.de/files/4359/download -O compiz-check && chmod +x compiz-check && ./compiz-check
2008-07-16T02:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	Saw a forum mod post a link to it once and I've used it since ;)
2008-07-16T02:52:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy1	what is that file for and what does it do?
2008-07-16T02:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	That tells you what driver you're using, whether it's fglrx or vesa
2008-07-16T02:56:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	So you're using the open source radeon driver, not ati's proprietary fglrx driver
2008-07-16T02:57:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	So if you thought you were using fglrx, you're doing it wrong ;)
2008-07-16T02:57:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy1	Right and that means squat because?
2008-07-16T02:57:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy1	I've been using a bit of everything been as though I don't know wtf to do to fix this
2008-07-16T02:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	So you're not in low graphics mode then, that's a plus
2008-07-16T03:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	alraune didn't do anything to your xorg.conf, you did?
2008-07-16T03:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	Right, but you were still the one who made the changes, don't blame others :) If you're having this much trouble with the radeon driver, I'd consider just using vesa and be done with it
2008-07-16T03:01:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy1	err that person pastebinned the file and I just copied it
2008-07-16T03:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	Sure you did, you copied them in
2008-07-16T03:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	Just change the line driver    "radeon" to driver    "vesa" and call it a day. Hard is relative ;)
2008-07-16T03:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	alraune says he's got the original xorg.conf saved... Have you tried just using that?
2008-07-16T03:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	You could just use the one alraune posted and add Driver    "vesa" in the screen section...
2008-07-16T03:07:00.000Z	ASULutzy1	Xavura	It's really not that complicated. I would first try using alraune's saved xorg.conf (that he was nice enough to save for you since you didn't make a backup.) and if that doesn't work just add the line Driver    "vesa" in the screen section of xorg.conf and reset X
