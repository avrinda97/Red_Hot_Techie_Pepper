2011-04-24T05:24:00.000Z	Juest		hey
2011-04-24T05:24:00.000Z	Juest		help here
2011-04-24T05:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	read some docs, you need to specify another port for the new X instance to run on.
2011-04-24T05:25:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	what are you trying to do anyway? There's probably an easier way to do this.
2011-04-24T05:25:00.000Z	Juest	magn3ts	i just want to run another x server and get into it and else
2011-04-24T05:26:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	you can run Xephyr
2011-04-24T05:26:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	that will run X inside a window in your current X instance.
2011-04-24T05:27:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	using "kill" :P
2011-04-24T06:25:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	so?
2011-04-24T06:25:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	I don't see how you can get that script to not output a url
2011-04-24T06:25:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	jesus. We need that output to help you.
2011-04-24T06:26:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	if you want, you can skip the auto upload and upload it yourself then.
2011-04-24T06:27:00.000Z	magn3ts	Juest	say "no", then upload the file somewhere.
