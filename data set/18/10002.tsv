2007-01-21T16:47:00.000Z	ernz		This is probably going to make me look really stupid, but I recently reconfigured my xorg to include the 2048x1024 option, and now the caps lock key doesn't work. Can someone please advise?
2007-01-21T16:47:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	 edit it back
2007-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	Dunno what I did :)
2007-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	 localtion is /etc/X11
2007-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	 know how to in vi?
2007-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	gedit* - Sort of.
2007-01-21T16:49:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	nah gedit is X apps, talking bout vi
2007-01-21T16:49:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	- Why can't I edit it in X, and then reboot X?
2007-01-21T16:50:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	 u can go for it , if x should not have issue, y should i :)
2007-01-21T16:50:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	cause X always gives issues wheather x on linux or x -gf's :(
2007-01-21T16:50:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	Fairy muff :) - Why doesn't sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg bring up the file?
2007-01-21T16:51:00.000Z	gb_	ernz	 cause file name is xorg.conf
2007-01-21T16:51:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	- That'll be why.
2007-01-21T16:56:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	- That's it sorted, cheers. Turns I was using "uk" when I should have been using "gb" - WHATS THE DIFFERENCE?!
2007-01-21T16:57:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	UK/GB same thing?
2007-01-21T16:58:00.000Z	ernz	gb_	- Who would have thunk it? - Fixed now anyways so cheers.
