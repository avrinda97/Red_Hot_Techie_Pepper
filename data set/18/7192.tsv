2008-01-26T08:52:00.000Z	Tempete		I think you have to sudo make install for Ubuntu.
2008-01-26T08:53:00.000Z	Tempete		Read the last few lines - anything about them?
2008-01-26T08:53:00.000Z	Tempete		Or paste them at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	its libgtk2.0-dev
2008-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	Thanks. singlesun: sudo aptitude install libgtk2.0-dev
2008-01-26T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	the /usr/local will work fine
2008-01-26T08:59:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	Thanks.
2008-01-26T09:05:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	no ... there's a lot of xml libs, hard to know which one.
2008-01-26T09:05:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	shouldn't the web page he got it from list the dependencies
2008-01-26T09:05:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	It should.. But lots don't. singlesun: What's the app called?
2008-01-26T09:06:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	it was a should, I hope you noticed :)
2008-01-26T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	the general rule of thumb for finding headers is add lib to the beginning,  apt-cache search <construct> | grep dev
2008-01-26T09:32:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	Mm, I'm a bit newer than you think I am. Haha. Not sure what to do with that information.
2008-01-26T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	like   for xml , ac search libxml | grep dev  . That will narrow the list.  Shows  libxml2-dev
2008-01-26T09:34:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	Just to make this easier.. Happen to know of any timer app in Ubuntu's repositories?
2008-01-26T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud_	Tempete	itools does the job that singlesun is trying to do, muslim prayer times. But it's command line only
2008-01-26T09:36:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	Mm, that's no fun. So long as it's a timer and he sets the time that should work - I'll take a look for a GUI app.
2008-01-26T09:48:00.000Z	Tempete	nickrud_	Hurray! Nice find.
