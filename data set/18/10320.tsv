2007-12-31T09:32:00.000Z	fotoflo		hi all - got a question: just got ubuntu server installed and by default root login is enabled and sudo is wierd
2007-12-31T09:33:00.000Z	fotoflo		im reading the ubuntu docs and it says root login should be disabled by default
2007-12-31T09:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	fotoflo	where did you get that version of ubuntu? because root is disabled by default in ubuntu
2007-12-31T09:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	fotoflo	ubuntu.com has a nice default ( not broke ) download
2007-12-31T09:36:00.000Z	fotoflo	IdleOne	got a link handy?
2007-12-31T09:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	fotoflo	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2007-12-31T09:39:00.000Z	fotoflo	IdleOne	you mean download ubuntu to my workstation and copy files off it?
2007-12-31T09:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	fotoflo	well if you can fix it then do that. or do a fresh install. who knows what else they decided to mess with in the version of ubuntu you got
2007-12-31T09:40:00.000Z	fotoflo	IdleOne	i cant do a fresh install without them
