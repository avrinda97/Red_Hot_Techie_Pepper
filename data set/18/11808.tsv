2006-12-21T08:06:00.000Z	AlexC_		Hey,
2006-12-21T08:06:00.000Z	AlexC_		I have a problem with Gnome themeing. My GTK Controls are no longer working correctly. If I change theme they always stay the same style
2006-12-21T08:07:00.000Z	AlexC_		Last thing I did was install kubuntu-desktop, which I have now removed - and since then it's mesed the GTK Controls up
2006-12-21T08:08:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	see if gtk2-engines-gtk-qt is installed and remove it
2007-01-15T14:33:00.000Z	AlexC_	jrib	:P
2007-04-28T10:51:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	nvidia-settings is included in nvidia-glx
2007-04-28T10:51:00.000Z	AlexC_	jrib	haha, never knew that!
2007-05-05T07:59:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	you just use chmod and chwon on the files in your mounted parititon, same as usual
2007-05-05T07:59:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	chown even
2007-05-05T07:59:00.000Z	AlexC_	jrib	but will that take effect each bootup?
2007-05-05T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	yes, ext3 stores permissions
2007-05-05T08:00:00.000Z	AlexC_	jrib	cool, thats ok
2007-05-05T08:00:00.000Z	AlexC_	jrib	so, sudo chown -R alex:alex /media/web-dev ?
2007-05-05T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	sure, if you want that
2007-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	ps or top
2007-10-11T06:30:00.000Z	AlexC_	jrib	aye, I understand permissions - though I've never had to change them before when mounting a partition so I can write to it,
2007-10-11T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	you change permissions after you mount
2007-10-11T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	AlexC_	you want execute permissions on directories
