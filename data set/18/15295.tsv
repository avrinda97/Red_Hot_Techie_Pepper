2007-09-18T07:46:00.000Z	Okami		my display is a tad hazy, looks a bit cartoony
2007-09-18T07:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Okami	LCD?
2007-09-18T07:46:00.000Z	Okami		Gordonjcp: yep :)
2007-09-18T07:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Okami	resolution is wrong
2007-09-18T07:47:00.000Z	Okami		Jordan_u: nope
2007-09-18T07:47:00.000Z	Okami		Gordonjcp: Awesome..what should i set it to sir?
2007-09-18T07:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Okami	depends on what your monitor is capable of.  LCDs have a "native" resolution that corresponds to the number of physical pixels on the screen
2007-09-18T07:49:00.000Z	Okami		Gordonjcp: ok well im not sure i understand what to do here to fix this, ive tried auto adjusting, and my monitor handles 1024x768 fine usually
2007-09-18T07:49:00.000Z	Okami		Gordonjcp: but not on ubuntu apparently...
2007-09-18T07:51:00.000Z	Okami		Fermatstheorem: done that already...not much... i just changed the res to 800x 600 and its looking fine now....but then again its 800x600...
2007-09-18T07:52:00.000Z	Okami	fermatstheorem	nope...
2007-09-18T07:53:00.000Z	Okami		not as sudo
2007-09-18T07:53:00.000Z	Okami		how should i run it as sudo? i just ran the restricted drivers...
2007-09-18T07:54:00.000Z	Okami		wheres that at if you dont mind explaining
2007-09-18T07:56:00.000Z	Okami	fermatstheorem	ok well im at the xorg.conf
2007-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	Okami	fermatstheorem	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2007-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Okami	maybe refresh rate, my monitor doesn't do 1680x1050 at 50Hz correctly but does 1680x1050 at 54Hz
