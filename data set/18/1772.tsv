2011-04-26T23:09:00.000Z	cache_surplus		whats the best most easiest way in cmdline to reinstall ubuntu gnome desktop?
2011-04-26T23:09:00.000Z	cache_surplus		what other directories like .hidden should i remove as well?
2011-04-26T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop           normally
2011-04-26T23:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 what are you trying to acomplish exactly>?
2011-04-26T23:10:00.000Z	cache_surplus	Dr_Willis	that will just install, i said reinstall
2011-04-26T23:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 are you sure its a system setting/gnome issue and not a user setting issue?
2011-04-26T23:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 try adding a new user - see if it works for them
2011-04-26T23:12:00.000Z	cache_surplus	Dr_Willis	i dont want to add another user
2011-04-26T23:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 its trivial.. but whatever.. move the users .whatever dirs to some othe rsubdir..  and test out gnome
2011-04-26T23:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 You are trying to reinstall all of gnome. when it may be a simple user setting.
2011-04-26T23:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 you could use metacity instead of compiz.  iF compiz is the issue.
2011-04-26T23:17:00.000Z	cache_surplus	Dr_Willis	ok,,, good point, which works better, and do they both load when i install
2011-04-26T23:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 compiz is a widnow maanger with all the eyecandy. it requires the 3d video drivers.. metacity is the older gnome window manager. not as much eyecandy. You use one or the other.
2011-04-26T23:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 then somthing may be wrong with them if they are not working with compiz. or they got disabled.
2011-04-26T23:18:00.000Z	cache_surplus	Dr_Willis	when i right click the desktop and change to desktop background and then visual effect, the 3rd option, is that Metacity?
2011-04-26T23:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 metacity would be no effects
2011-04-26T23:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 alt-f2  run 'metacity --replace' to   be sure its using metacity
2011-04-26T23:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cache_surplus	 any effects will be using compiz with differnt settings. NONE = metacity
