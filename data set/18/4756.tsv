2009-02-25T06:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	guess it all depends, does it have an SSD, or a regular hard drive
2009-02-25T06:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	if you're not going to answer a response, then why repeat the question?
2009-02-25T06:53:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	sorry i missed that : (
2009-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	its a Eee pc 1000 ha so its a 160 gb hd
2009-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	then i don't think you'd see a difference between any ubuntu, eeeubuntu or xubuntu... my AAO runs fantastic w/ 8.10
2009-02-25T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	why don't you just either 1... boot an ubuntu cd, or 2... put ubuntu on a thumb drive, and boot it, and see how it goes.
2009-02-25T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	id o know, your wireless probably isn't going to work out of the box... do you know if you have the atheros wireless device, or the realtek one?
2009-02-25T07:00:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	i belive its the realtek one
2009-02-25T07:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	yeah, those are kind of a pain
2009-02-25T07:00:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	i've search the forum and apparently they do run with the eeebuntu mod kernel
2009-02-25T07:01:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	hows the boot time one Aao
2009-02-25T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	well, you can get it to work w/ "regular" 8.10... just take some works, but that might be one reason to choose eee, is for the kernel w/ the realtek driver
2009-02-25T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	i have no complaints about its boot time.. i've never timed it, but its similar to my workhorse laptop.
2009-02-25T07:02:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	thats amazing
2009-02-25T07:04:00.000Z	topo_	IndyGunFreak	fearful: i'm going to go with the eeebuntu version thx for all the help, my only concern is that the win xp versions boots on la 35 seconds hope i can match it
2009-02-25T07:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	topo_	probably a good idea w/ that realtek deiice good luck
