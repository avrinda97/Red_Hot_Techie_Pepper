2008-07-10T07:26:00.000Z	djhash	IndyGunFreak	I have ATI on all of my 3 ubuntu installations and I have compiz easily installed
2008-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	djhash	on some of them, there's a lot of problems w/ ATI and compiz however... white screen, etc.. it can be made to work, but i've saw many reports here w/ limited success.
2008-07-10T07:28:00.000Z	djhash	IndyGunFreak	 i'm aware of all the reports.. which confuses me since the only problem I am having or ever have is that the svideo out on my laptop is a little wacky..
2008-07-10T07:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	djhash	if he tabs just dj, he gets someone else..lol
2008-07-10T07:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	djhash	well, new users need to understand.. 1. use the package manager until you're comfortable w/ how things work, then move on to compiling, etc.
2008-07-10T07:47:00.000Z	djhash	IndyGunFreak	yeah i know.. but seriously.. i am impatient.. but their impatience superceeds mine... lol..
