2007-07-18T07:30:00.000Z	unagi		anyone know if its possible for ubuntu to automatically put the icons on the right?
2007-07-18T07:31:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	I don't think so - there might be a way - you can ask over at #gnome
2007-07-18T07:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Yep - where you been :)
2007-07-18T07:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	October
2007-07-18T07:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Of course if you're feeling "Gutsy" you can upgrade now :)
2007-07-18T07:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Just upgrade, but if you're fairly new , I would recommend it...
2007-07-18T07:42:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Yeah it won't nuke anything but Gutsy is not ready for general consumption... so unless you know what you're doing...
2007-07-22T05:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	You can use gaprted for that - just have to boot from live cd and unmount drives :)
2007-07-22T05:16:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Admin - > Software Sources..
2007-07-22T05:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	gparted not working to resize those partitions? That's surprising...
2007-07-22T05:36:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	If you can mount the drive you should be able to back up :)
2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Though yeah maybe some corruption there...
2007-07-29T05:45:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Quicktime works - I think it's one of the gstreamer packages ...
2007-07-31T06:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	and vice versa :P
2007-07-31T06:29:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	I'm lost but bolingo is not using strong logic...
2007-08-04T06:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	man blah | grep -i word
2007-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	Try VLC...
2007-08-05T14:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	unagi	You want to change to the directory where the stuff your building is..
