2006-11-06T10:28:00.000Z	kitche	tsoler	hmm that should allow you to connect to it, you can also try nxclient since I believe that will allow you to connect to TS servers as well
2006-11-06T10:29:00.000Z	tsoler	kitche	: what about the protocolls?
2006-11-06T10:29:00.000Z	kitche	tsoler	nxclient should have an option that will let you specify TS connection
2006-11-06T10:30:00.000Z	tsoler	kitche	: i see many protocolls here what is the correct one?
2006-11-06T10:30:00.000Z	kitche	tsoler	It's been so long sicne I used a linux TS client
2006-11-06T10:31:00.000Z	tsoler		whts the differnce between rdp and vnc?
2006-11-06T10:31:00.000Z	tsoler		vnc
2006-11-06T10:31:00.000Z	kitche	tsoler	think you want rdp vnc is used to vnc servers and such
