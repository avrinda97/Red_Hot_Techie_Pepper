2012-08-11T14:05:00.000Z	martin__		hey guys, can sb help? I've just installed Xubuntu 12.04 but after first start up, there was a crash report. Graphic is very poor, icons are missing, no sound. I already upgrated the system but no change.
2012-08-11T14:07:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	clean install or upgrade
2012-08-11T14:08:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	so installed xubuntu?  Y U NO just install xfce and keep kubuntu?
2012-08-11T14:09:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	first I had clear install, first start up... after that I tried to restar my EEEpc- everything the same even the report. so I saw there are available updates, then I upgrated - no change after that
2012-08-11T14:11:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	missing icons & such suggest a graphics issue.  Settings or non-compatible gpu come to mind...
2012-08-11T14:12:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	hmmm, I've tried live USB and Xubuntu ran perfectly. Is there anything I can do? or do I have to install another distro
2012-08-11T14:13:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	clarify: you clean installed xubuntu?
2012-08-11T14:16:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	how clean do u mean? 2 hours ago I had Kubuntu 12.04 but was heavy for my EEEpc, so I decided to install xubuntu. I've formated the partition and install there xubuntu. there is nothing but xubuntu a ist basic sw
2012-08-11T14:17:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	clear and concise.  I'm going to suggest 2 options: reinstall kubuntu and pay particular attention to installing 3rd party drivers/codecs.  Also, consider the other "light" distro: lubuntu.
2012-08-11T14:20:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	I dont wanna kubuntu anymore. If I try reinstall Xubuntu and leave out the field of using 3rd party drivers/codecs? Might that help? I dont lik LXDE, I prefer XFCE, so maybe Linux Mint might be good for me, as well
2012-08-11T14:21:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	your choice.  in you reinstall, pay careful attention to what you select.  I'm pretty sure you should be able to configure a solution.  But first *you DID ensure you got a good iso with md5checksum* right?
2012-08-11T14:24:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	i did not check the iso. Now I'm downloading it again and I will make live USB pen from the new downloaded ISO. In installation I will not choose the option to install 3rd party drivers/codecs
2012-08-11T14:24:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	how can I check the isto?
2012-08-11T14:24:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	so you checked the iso you downloaded previously and it's bad?
2012-08-11T14:35:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	checksums are identical!
2012-08-11T14:35:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	means you got a good download.  Proceed as planned.
2012-08-11T14:37:00.000Z	martin__	cfhowlett	OK, so there's no need to download it again... I'll try to reinstall it without 3rd stuff, thx
2012-08-11T14:37:00.000Z	cfhowlett	martin__	best of luck
