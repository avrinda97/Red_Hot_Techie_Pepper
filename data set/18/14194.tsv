2005-09-02T12:39:00.000Z	RageLinkX	eklektik	tried to reload the GDM?
2005-09-02T12:39:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	any idea why that happened?
2005-09-02T12:39:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	sorry, I'm a n00b, no idea how to do that
2005-09-02T12:41:00.000Z	RageLinkX	eklektik	how did yours turn out? is it when you log in or did it disappear
2005-09-02T12:42:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	I get the login screen, then it goes further. I even get my desktop, but after that nothing. my hard disk keeps reading, but nothing. no Applications. Places or System
2005-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	RageLinkX	eklektik	replaced any libraries?
2005-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	Nope. none that I can recall. Have you  been able to fix your problem
2005-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	RageLinkX	eklektik	still on that... i think it might be sorta the same issue... i already restarted GDM (removed it and re-installed it ) same with Gnome, and Nautilus, and the xorg packages
2005-09-02T12:45:00.000Z	RageLinkX	eklektik	i believe someof the subservices are just not loading
2005-09-02T12:45:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	oh ok. So how do I do that? I can boot into the terminal using the (recovery) option, yeah? then what's the procedure?
2005-09-02T12:48:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	good for you, I had to resort to Windoze :s
2005-09-02T13:10:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	how's it going with ya?
2005-09-02T13:11:00.000Z	RageLinkX	eklektik	im about to bak everythign up and re-install
2005-09-02T13:12:00.000Z	eklektik	RageLinkX	not good at all. I still don't have the applications panels :(
