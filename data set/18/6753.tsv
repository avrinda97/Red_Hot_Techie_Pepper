2008-04-16T08:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Zelta	 automatix? why?
2008-04-16T08:14:00.000Z	Zelta	bazhang	[22:10] <Zelta> Pelo: I had used Automatix2 (stupid, I know) to install multimedia codecs. Should I first uninstall automatix2 and everything I installed with it?
2008-04-16T08:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Zelta	automatix is a system breaker; best to back up and reinstall
2008-04-16T08:15:00.000Z	Zelta	bazhang	How should I go about installing necessary codecs?  Is there a documentation page for it?
2008-04-16T08:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Zelta	until you get rid of all the damage automatix has caused (reinstall) then you will get more breakage--just a word of warning
2008-04-16T08:18:00.000Z	Zelta	bazhang	I know.  I am going to reinstall before doing anything else.
