2006-07-20T15:58:00.000Z	ironfroggy		is there a grub command to look at what is installed at the MBA currently?
2006-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	no, but you can use dd + xxd to get a hexdump
2006-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	it wont be understandable tho will it?
2006-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	like dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 | xxd
2006-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	ironfroggy		i just want to verify that grub actually worked.
2006-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	well, only if you know what should be there :)
2006-07-20T16:00:00.000Z	ironfroggy		well, is it bad if i see both LILO and GRUB in the first block of the drive?
2006-07-20T16:00:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	they can't be both there
2006-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	i just see both strings in the block
2006-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	don't care, if your bootloader works
2006-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	the second is within "GRUB .Geom.Hard Disk.Read. Error."
2006-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	it doesnt work.
2006-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	reinstall grub then
2006-07-20T16:02:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	thats why im trying to verify grub is successfully installing or not.
2006-07-20T16:02:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	done it several times.
2006-07-20T16:02:00.000Z	telmich	ironfroggy	how?
2006-07-20T16:02:00.000Z	ironfroggy	telmich	reran the install and did it manually
