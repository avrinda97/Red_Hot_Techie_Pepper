2010-04-27T01:02:00.000Z	_0R10N		<navatwo> during which step does it crash??
2010-04-27T01:04:00.000Z	navatwo	_0R10N	installing the base system
2010-04-27T01:04:00.000Z	navatwo		The hash is off..
2010-04-27T01:05:00.000Z	navatwo		nvm the hash is fine
2010-04-27T01:05:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	if all the DVD/CDs you had tried were burned  with the same device, then I have to agree with some guy that told you earlier about a burner problem
2010-04-27T01:06:00.000Z	navatwo		it was burned with brasero...?
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	I was asking about the hardware... it was the same everytime?
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	navatwo	_0R10N	yes. I've burned other live cd's though, no problem
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	navatwo		:S
2010-04-27T01:08:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	you could try setting an usb pendrive to install the OS from it
2010-04-27T01:10:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	it's weird, man! it looks to me like a hardware failing (in this case the burner) or the ISO corrupted
2010-04-27T01:10:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	did you check the integrity of the file downloaded???
2010-04-27T01:10:00.000Z	navatwo		yea
2010-04-27T01:10:00.000Z	navatwo		its fine
2010-04-27T01:12:00.000Z	navatwo		hm
2010-04-27T01:12:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	well, try installing on a virtual box, or something like that...
2010-04-27T01:12:00.000Z	navatwo		I had to download a new version, the old file was corrupt, i'll check the new
2010-04-27T01:13:00.000Z	_0R10N	navatwo	the point is you can't run any sort of test, but trying with another iso, or installing on another computer
