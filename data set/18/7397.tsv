2008-02-03T02:03:00.000Z	LurkersA	batis610	What is your computer like? Is it a new one or an old one?
2008-02-03T02:04:00.000Z	batis610	LurkersA	a new one with dual core 3ghz, 1go of ram .....;
2008-02-03T02:05:00.000Z	LurkersA	batis610	Hmmm. Well I'm not sure why it wouldn't be working. Did you use the restricted driver management option to install driver, or did you install manually?
2008-02-03T02:06:00.000Z	batis610	LurkersA	i used  the restricted driver management to install
2008-02-03T02:07:00.000Z	LurkersA	batis610	Hmm. I used Envy to install the latest drivers for me, and that worked fine, but again, I've never had any problems with the OSS Drivers. Do you know how well your card is supported?
2008-02-03T02:08:00.000Z	batis610	LurkersA	yes it is... ATI Radeon x1650
2008-02-03T02:09:00.000Z	LurkersA	batis610	Well I'm not sure mate. Try ubuntuforums, you may get help there from people who know about that stuff.
2008-02-03T02:10:00.000Z	batis610	LurkersA	thks any way :)
