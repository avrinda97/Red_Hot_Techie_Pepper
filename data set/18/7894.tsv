2008-06-05T22:19:00.000Z	idzied		where can I get some help on FTP?
2008-06-05T22:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	depends what you're trying to do
2008-06-05T22:21:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	i need to download a directory tree to my computer from a hosting site, but it seems that the ftp client hasn't got enought privileges  to create the tree on local, even if I run it with gksudo
2008-06-05T22:22:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	Using gFtp Client
2008-06-05T22:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	pretty much like any other ftp client
2008-06-05T22:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	ftp is dead now though
2008-06-05T22:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	use scp or sftp
2008-06-05T22:24:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	should those fix the problem?
2008-06-05T22:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	what's the problem?
2008-06-05T22:25:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	I cannot download whole directories, and got about a houndred in a tree, so I need to download all of them altogether
2008-06-05T22:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	that should be possible with ftp
2008-06-05T22:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	not sure how though, I haven't used ftp for about a decade
2008-06-05T22:26:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	gftp says: Loading directory listing /public_html/... but it does nothing, just stops
2008-06-05T22:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	sounds like you need to check the "Passive" settings - are you behind a firewall?
2008-06-05T22:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	idzied	got to go, but look for something marked "Passive" or "PASV" and fiddle with it
2008-06-05T22:28:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	OK gonna have a look, cheers
2008-06-05T22:31:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	One last question, It seems that the directory I'm downloading to hasn't got the right privileges. Does it need to have certain permissions?
2008-06-05T22:42:00.000Z	idzied	gordonjcp	I solved the problem with FileZilla ;)
