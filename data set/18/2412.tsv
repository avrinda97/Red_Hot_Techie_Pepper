2010-05-21T22:14:00.000Z	jack_boss		why does locate irssi for ex. still list files in /var/ after using apt-get purge?
2010-05-21T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 the locate command uses a database. that database gets updated like 1 a day
2010-05-21T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 use 'sudo updatedb' to force a update of the locate database
2010-05-21T22:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 locate uses the database. :) so its as acurate as the last time it got updated..
2010-05-21T22:18:00.000Z	jack_boss	Dr_Willis	how does purge work
2010-05-21T22:19:00.000Z	jack_boss	Dr_Willis	does it look for every related file to the programm being removed?
2010-05-21T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 purge removes config files for apps as well as the app.
2010-05-21T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 just the config files..   the idea of 'every related file' is a little broad. :)
2010-05-21T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 and its just the SYSTEM config files. not custome user configs.
2010-05-21T22:20:00.000Z	jack_boss	Dr_Willis	well i compiled a file and installed it with apt-get and found some hidden file in my home dir
2010-05-21T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 files in the users HOME dir are NOT going to be removed by the package manager system
2010-05-21T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 unless you did somthing very.. weird..
2010-05-21T22:21:00.000Z	jack_boss	Dr_Willis	uhm, what if its something like ./irssi/config
2010-05-21T22:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 double check that path..  if you mean .irssi/stuff in the users home.. the package manager should NOT be affecting files/dirs in the users home dirs.
2010-05-21T22:24:00.000Z	jack_boss	Dr_Willis	i didnt do anything funny i just dont want files spread like config files that would have stuff like auto connect
2010-05-21T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 the users keep track of their own config files in their home dirs.. not the system package manager.
2010-05-21T22:29:00.000Z	jack_boss	Dr_Willis	do programs keep track of files in home dir if they were remvoed with pruge? and if it was placed the in the first place does it get overwritten
2010-05-21T22:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack_boss	 no they dont that ive ever seen.. and they really shouldent..
