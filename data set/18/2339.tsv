2012-04-17T22:28:00.000Z	Areckx		I want to do everything in terminal ideally
2012-04-17T22:28:00.000Z	Areckx		it has the fewest errors if done correctly
2012-04-17T22:29:00.000Z	Areckx		gvo::  I:ve always thought that was a cool feature. I want to learn more about it.
2012-04-17T22:29:00.000Z	Areckx		well there are applications that are streamlined for GUI interface.
2012-04-17T22:30:00.000Z	Areckx		So while it would be ideal to configure the program in terminal, the program runs most comfortably in GUI interface
2012-04-17T22:30:00.000Z	Areckx		gvo::  yeah, I would like to create custom applications.
2012-04-17T22:31:00.000Z	Areckx		gvo::  For example...
2012-04-17T22:31:00.000Z	Areckx		gvo::  I would like to be able to run a program natively under ubuntu 10.04 that was only designed for windows xp
2012-04-17T22:32:00.000Z	Areckx		gvo::  that is, only if there is no equal or greater alternative already compiled for linux
2012-04-17T22:32:00.000Z	Areckx		gvo::  the source is the .bin or the converted .exe?
2012-04-17T22:32:00.000Z	akem	Areckx	waist of time if it was really only designed for Win32, use Wine or VirtualBox
2012-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	Areckx		auronandace::  I was reffering to running it as if it were compiled for linux, not under a virtual environment. I have had many proiblems with WINE in the past.
2012-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	akem		even with the source, good luck porting Win32 API stuff.
2012-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	akem		Wine FTW.
2012-04-17T22:34:00.000Z	Areckx		akem::  why is it a waste of time exactly?
2012-04-17T22:34:00.000Z	Areckx		akem::  I  may have to answer this is in essay form.
2012-04-17T22:35:00.000Z	Areckx	deb0	what are the major compare/contrast points between WINE and VirtualBox?
2012-04-17T22:35:00.000Z	akem	Areckx	Windows programs are usually using non portable code/API calls.
