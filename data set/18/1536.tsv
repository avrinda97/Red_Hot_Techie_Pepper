2011-01-27T06:57:00.000Z	joeoshawa		torsion did you try dvd rip i am a bit of a noob at it myself
2011-01-27T06:57:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i can author and such just haven't pulled them off dvd's really
2011-01-27T06:58:00.000Z	torsion	joeoshawa	only s/w I tried so far was handbrake. Will try ogmrip now or dvdrip now; so I rip the video to mp4 files, then dvdauthor/style to make new iso?
2011-01-27T06:59:00.000Z	joeoshawa		yeah well i go and make new menus and such but you'll have to read the online tutorials its a bit much to go into here
2011-01-27T06:59:00.000Z	joeoshawa		but yes
2011-01-27T06:59:00.000Z	joeoshawa		but you rip them into whatever file you wish to use
2011-01-27T07:00:00.000Z	joeoshawa		another format may give you a much better image
2011-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	joeoshawa		if youtube fullscreen is a problem bring up the video pause it and when the red line gets all the way to then end browse file system and go to /tmp take the flash file and copy it to desktop
2011-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	joeoshawa		then you have it forever rename it and move it whereever you wish
2011-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	torsion	joeoshawa	can you recommend a better format?
2011-01-27T07:06:00.000Z	joeoshawa		looks as though mp4
2011-01-27T07:06:00.000Z	joeoshawa		mpeg4
2011-01-27T07:08:00.000Z	joeoshawa	ubu_ply	i have the same problem i ended up buying speakers with a headphone jack to do the same thing my headset port doesn't work at all in linux
2011-01-27T07:09:00.000Z	joeoshawa		linux sound is a disaster unfortunately but it is being worked on
2011-01-27T07:11:00.000Z	joeoshawa	ubu_ply	not to rtfm but unfortunately this is the best answer i got for you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure
2011-01-27T07:12:00.000Z	joeoshawa		actually there is an autodetect feature but like i said linux sound is a mess
2011-01-27T07:13:00.000Z	joeoshawa		init 6 =runlevel 6 restart your computer from command line
2011-01-27T07:15:00.000Z	torsion	joeoshawa	tried to rip using "standalone DVD" setting on ogmrip, got error, log: http://pastebin.com/uDYP4SZV
