2008-07-10T21:02:00.000Z	chad_		can someone explain something to me
2008-07-10T21:02:00.000Z	chad_		ok, how come i cant watch dvds on my computer?
2008-07-10T21:02:00.000Z	chad_		is this so it dosent affect copyright laws?
2008-07-10T21:03:00.000Z	chad_		hello?
2008-07-10T21:03:00.000Z	chad_		sorry, i didnt mean to sound impatient
2008-07-10T21:05:00.000Z	chad_		right, so copyright laws? its just that i watched a DVD that was not cp righted, and it worked
2008-07-10T21:05:00.000Z	chad_		but not a cp one
2008-07-10T21:06:00.000Z	chad_		btw, sorry if i sounded ignorant
2008-07-10T21:06:00.000Z	chad_		right
2008-07-10T21:07:00.000Z	chad_		i heard that linux was pulled up for having a software that illegally decoded DVDs and copied them
2008-07-10T21:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chad_	in some countries, they actually allow patents on software
2008-07-10T21:08:00.000Z	chad_		o...k.....
2008-07-10T21:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chad_	for most people it won't affect them
2008-07-10T21:08:00.000Z	chad_		so who manages it then?
2008-07-10T21:08:00.000Z	chad_	RAdams	i agree
2008-07-10T21:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chad_	now, the idea is that DVD uses some super seekrit patented algorithm, not entirely unlike ROT13, to scramble content
2008-07-10T21:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chad_	and the DVD Consortium got all upset when it turned out that most of the world doesn't work the way they think it does, and threw a hissy fit
2008-07-10T21:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chad_	so in conclusion, it's an issue for people in the US, but they can't afford DVDs anyway
