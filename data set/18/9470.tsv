2008-05-10T00:00:00.000Z	tanath		can MS Word open OpenOffice docs?
2008-05-10T00:01:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	no its the other way around
2008-05-10T00:01:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	?
2008-05-10T00:05:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	why do you need a windows doc?
2008-05-10T00:05:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	because that's what most offices use
2008-05-10T00:07:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	how bout you make it html?
2008-05-10T00:07:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	it needs to be doc
2008-05-10T00:09:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	no
2008-05-10T00:10:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	?
2008-05-10T00:10:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	i think the .doc format is what you want but it might be the wordpad instead of msword
2008-05-10T00:11:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	i'm using OO
2008-05-10T00:11:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	save it to all kinds, doc, rtf, msdoc etc. and find out which one works
2008-05-10T00:12:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	as i said, i need to be .doc
2008-05-10T00:13:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	well if it isnt working, try abiword
2008-05-10T00:15:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	abiword?
2008-05-10T00:16:00.000Z	spiderfire	tanath	try saving it and OO then open it in abiword then save as .doc
2008-05-10T00:16:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	could try that
2008-05-10T00:17:00.000Z	tanath	spiderfire	rpj8, another thing i noticed is that while it may look fine even as .doc in OO, when it's opened in word, it's messed up
