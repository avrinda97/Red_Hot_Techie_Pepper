2005-03-23T09:37:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	Not a problem.
2005-03-23T09:40:00.000Z	geneo93	karsten	 why wont kppp work
2005-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	NFC.
2005-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	You're not paying it enough.
2005-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	Run from a terminal.  Look at its error output.
2005-03-23T10:59:00.000Z	geneo93	karsten	 i have 4.6 gig root partition and no office apps and i run out of disk space thats crazy
2005-03-23T11:00:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	For a current Linux install, I'd start at around 6 GB myself.  'df -h' will show a summary of free space in your partitions.
2005-03-23T11:00:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	'du -s <dirlist>' will give a summary of usage by directory.  There's also an interactive GUI tool, 'filelight' which shows disk usage.
2005-03-23T11:02:00.000Z	geneo93	karsten	 but thats crazy i did fine last round with this
2005-03-23T11:14:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	Arguing with your filesystem about how much free disk you've got is sort of pointless.
2005-03-23T11:15:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	Anyway, google "linux partitioning" if you want my view on things.
2005-03-23T11:57:00.000Z	geneo93	karsten	 this is crazy i cant belive this thing has used all that space heres mdk root   /dev/hdb1             7.5G 1019M  6.2G  15% /mnt/mdkrt2
2005-03-23T11:58:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	...and?
2005-03-23T11:58:00.000Z	geneo93	karsten	 something is being reported wrong got to be
2005-03-23T11:59:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	Got any open, but deleted files?
2005-03-23T12:00:00.000Z	karsten	geneo93	lsof and du are your friends.  I'm busy with other stuff, RTFM or ask the channel.
