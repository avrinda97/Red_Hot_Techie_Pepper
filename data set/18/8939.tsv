2007-06-03T15:48:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	are you trying to record from any specific source? or just being able to record sound and listen to it at the same time in general?
2007-06-03T15:49:00.000Z	baldie	haydnc	I want to record from a flashplayer.. so I want to record the output to the speakers
2007-06-03T15:50:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	I've never actually tried it, but I do remember seeing a link about an easy way to record sound from an app the other day
2007-06-03T15:50:00.000Z	baldie		oh?
2007-06-03T15:50:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	it wasn't flash, but let me see if I can find it again
2007-06-03T15:50:00.000Z	baldie		cool
2007-06-03T15:52:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	http://porpoisehead.net/hi/?q=node/23   it relates to skype, but at a quick glance the same theory looks like it should work for pretty much anything. Someone else here might have a better suggestion though
2007-06-03T15:53:00.000Z	baldie		thx haydnc, i'll look at it
2007-06-03T16:01:00.000Z	baldie	haydnc	i got it to work finally. But the gnome-sound-recorder is somewhat flawed. I can record and save it. But if I press "playback" in the sound recorder, just after recording, it doesn't play anything.
2007-06-03T16:01:00.000Z	baldie		anyways it works :>
2007-06-03T16:04:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	like I said it's not something I've ever tried. presumably if the basic concept works and you can set one program to record from the sound output of another it would be possible to force something like Audacity to record from capture also
2007-06-03T16:06:00.000Z	baldie		uhm I get a rather poor quality. 3min soundfile is 8MB in wav format? -_- and it obv sounds as crap
2007-06-03T16:07:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	that would at least see to it that you were using a slightly more comprehensive piece of audio editing software to do the job
2007-06-03T16:08:00.000Z	baldie		yea.. but audacity doesn't work, it says in the guide
2007-06-03T16:08:00.000Z	baldie		gotta do some Google I guess, for an audio app
2007-06-03T16:09:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	so it does. I didn't see that... I wonder if there are any other options
2007-06-03T16:12:00.000Z	baldie	haydnc	I'm looking into Ardour... it's a pro audio thingy supplied with UbuntuStudio
2007-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	haydnc	baldie	it turns out that Audacity can be made to use ALSA instead of OSS, but it looks like it requires a rebuild and more effort than I'm willing to put in to test it, but Audacity's wiki page mentions it :)
