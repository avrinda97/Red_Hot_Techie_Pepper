2005-08-10T15:45:00.000Z	Syco54645		how how do i burn cds with the live cd?
2005-08-10T15:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	which drive is your burner?
2005-08-10T15:46:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	actually you can try cdrecord -pad dev=/dev/cdroms/cdrom1 some.iso
2005-08-10T15:47:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	ok i just did a scanbus on cdrecord and it yelled at me... i never got it to work with ide drives though
2005-08-10T15:47:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	that is what it does at me but that command works :)
2005-08-10T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	and just for fun I burn lots of linux and ubuntu for peeps
2005-08-10T15:48:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	if you want to have alot of fun why not get me a harddrive :P that way i dont need to use a live cd for a computer
2005-08-10T15:49:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	cds cheap :) hard drives expensive here - 250 for 120
2005-08-10T15:50:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	wow i get a 200 gig for 100 usd here
2005-08-10T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	well a live CD is not a full install
2005-08-10T15:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	only if the doc is there
2005-08-10T15:52:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	when i type cdrecord --help it displays stuff
2005-08-10T15:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	wrong stdout - emm - the other one prints and emm --- grep is not > or < so I have a lot of trouble with that idea
2005-08-10T15:55:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	i know what i mean, i just dont feel like explaining it... basically it is that it is grepping something that isnt there because it is using a different stdout or some crap
2005-08-10T15:56:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	then redirect it to echo
2005-08-10T15:56:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	yeah that is a fix, but considering that i am on a live cd id rather not fix it now
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Syco54645	mount and /etc/fstab
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	Syco54645	ompaul	thanks
