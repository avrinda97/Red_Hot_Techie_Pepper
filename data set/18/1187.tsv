2011-05-03T21:31:00.000Z	pentos	Krishnandu	I may hava  similar prob
2011-05-03T21:31:00.000Z	Krishnandu		I've NVIDIA card, and when I go to Additional Drivers it says It's activated but not in use...why so?? And what's being use if NVIDIA Driver is not getting used??
2011-05-03T21:31:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	Yup, I found many in ubuntuforums, but no one has solution to this...
2011-05-03T21:32:00.000Z	pentos	Krishnandu	is thee a roll back option ?
2011-05-03T21:33:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	Nope, uninstall option is there, though I'm not very much into it, the main concern is, it doesn't boot with the newest kernel, Black Screen...
2011-05-03T21:33:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	But boots fine with the Previous Kernel(Last kernel of maverick update)
2011-05-03T21:34:00.000Z	pentos	Krishnandu	so maybe boot from a disk and do a fresh install?
2011-05-03T21:35:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	I don't think so, it's my primary OS, and I don't want to loose all the data...
2011-05-03T21:35:00.000Z	Krishnandu		I'm using it since Lucid
2011-05-03T21:35:00.000Z	pentos	Krishnandu	me too. so what's the fix? any idea?
2011-05-03T21:36:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	Nope, lets wait...as we are traveling in the same boat.!! :)
2011-05-03T21:36:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	Lauchpad already has many reports regarding this, lets see what happens...if they can fix it up...
2011-05-03T21:37:00.000Z	pentos	Krishnandu	i hope its soon - i got a lot to do
2011-05-03T21:38:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	Same here...!! Wish they fix it soon, but I strongly think it's not a general bug, and has something to do with NVIDIA Cards, and as far I know they have modified the Graphics thing, and something is creating this problem. As all of us are able to boot using previous kernel
2011-05-03T21:40:00.000Z	pentos	Krishnandu	could be - I have an invidia card too. bugger
2011-05-03T21:40:00.000Z	Krishnandu	pentos	Just got this...check it out : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1743386
