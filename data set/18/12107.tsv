2006-05-27T06:13:00.000Z	bodog		hey everybody
2006-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	bodog		i got a question
2006-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	bodog		i'm using ubuntu... and i was wondering what the best torrent program was
2006-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	bodog		and how to get it
2006-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	dust	bodog	i like azureus.
2006-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	dust		i don't know if it is the best but i like it.
2006-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	bodog	dust	is there a way to unblock ports in azureus?
2006-05-27T06:16:00.000Z	bodog	dust	coz i dont know how to use different ports on bittorrent... and the torrent i'm using blacklists port 6882
2006-05-27T06:16:00.000Z	dust		you can pick specific ports but i don't know exactly what you mean by unblock
2006-05-27T06:16:00.000Z	bodog		well, "unblock": isn't the right term to use i guess
2006-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	dust		to 'unblock' ports you would have to change settings in your firewall
2006-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	bodog		yeah.. unblock is the wrong word
2006-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	bodog		i meant... use a different port other than 6882
2006-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	dust		i believe that bittorrent uses a whole range of ports from 4000-8000 or something at (near) random
2006-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	bodog		coz the one crazy port is blacklisted for some odd reason
2006-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	dust		but azureus you can pick your port in the options
2006-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	bodog		thx brotha
2006-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	dust	bodog	no problem
