2009-07-23T01:32:00.000Z	vladimir		hi. my laptop gets stuck about an 20 mins of use. i tried to install older versions of nvidia driver as someone told me yesterday ( instead of 180 i installed 173 ) an it didn't help. i have ubuntu 9.04.
2009-07-23T01:33:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 hardware failure (overheating?)
2009-07-23T01:33:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	no win xp works just fine
2009-07-23T01:35:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 is it always 20 min?  logs give any clue?
2009-07-23T01:36:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	no it varies sometimes its nah 60 mins and sometimes its 10
2009-07-23T01:36:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 do you have additional memory in the machine?  perhaps remove the 2nd stick, see if that helps?
2009-07-23T01:37:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	no i have attached only optical device and eth.
2009-07-23T01:38:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	but friend told me it wasn't only my graphics stuck
2009-07-23T01:38:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	but friend told me it wasn't only my graphics stuck
2009-07-23T01:38:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	ssh also didnt work
2009-07-23T01:38:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 it sure radiates some sort of hardware issue to me, fire up xp, and run a stress test see if it fails.
2009-07-23T01:39:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 ssh?
2009-07-23T01:39:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 ssh crashies it?
2009-07-23T01:40:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	no we were in the middle of some work over it when my pc stuck. it wasnt working then either ( before it worked ). and before that ssh wasnt even working ( on previous crashes
2009-07-23T01:40:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 just remove the ssh package and reinstall, shoudl fix
2009-07-23T01:43:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	i installed ssh because it was getting stuck and friend tried to help
2009-07-23T01:43:00.000Z	vladimir	numa	i think it is not ssh
2009-07-23T01:43:00.000Z	numa	vladimir	 i understand, however, if ssh quit working that would imply some sort of hdd corruption, whatever
