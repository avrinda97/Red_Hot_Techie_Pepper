2008-10-28T09:35:00.000Z	LF|Irssi		im having probs trying to get this .sh script working on a cron, it's not chmod'ing 777 the chat3.html file like it's supposed to heres the paste http://pastebin.com/d7b30dbf8
2008-10-28T09:36:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	and it's being run as root?
2008-10-28T09:36:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	yep
2008-10-28T09:38:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	what's the ls -l /opt/lampp/htdocs/chatlogs/chat3.html | awk '{print $1}'
2008-10-28T09:39:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	-rw-------
2008-10-28T09:40:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	and if you chmod 777 from the commandline right now? is there some other program that's changing it to 600 like that?
2008-10-28T09:40:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	not that im aware of,
2008-10-28T09:41:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	well, i figure the /opt/lampp/ is in relation to some sort of program, so i'm figuring on dynamic content
2008-10-28T09:41:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	im assuming the cron is running as root since i did "crontab -e" in a root terminal
2008-10-28T09:41:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	it's Xampp for Linux
2008-10-28T09:42:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	what is the result of:  crontab -e -u root
2008-10-28T09:42:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	i'm sorry - crontab -l -u root
2008-10-28T09:43:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	http://pastebin.com/d3d0189d5
2008-10-28T09:44:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	hrm, perhaps it got put into your normal user's crontab, i don't see a single chmod entry there
2008-10-28T09:45:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	the chat.sh is the script that sets the chmodding
2008-10-28T09:46:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	take a look at the order you're doing this in - you're changing the mode, removing it, and then recreating it - when you recreate it, it's turning up as 0600 - you'll need to re-chmod it after you've recreated it.
2008-10-28T10:06:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	Gnea	thanks for your help earlier, the prob was how i had the cron's in order, thanks very much :)
2008-10-28T10:08:00.000Z	Gnea	LF|Irssi	cheers :)
