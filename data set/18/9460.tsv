2008-04-30T01:51:00.000Z	ror		thanks guys!
2008-04-30T01:53:00.000Z	ror		I don't remember 704 to 710 being this big an upgrade?
2008-04-30T01:53:00.000Z	ror		I guess this means good stuff is coming our way? :)
2008-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	ror		AHHHHH
2008-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	ror		the upgrade manager is trying to convert me to the server edition?
2008-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	ror		no wonder it's gone mad
2008-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	ror		how do I stop it after saying I wanted it to continue?
2008-04-30T01:55:00.000Z	ror		*hits cancel button and hopes
2008-04-30T01:55:00.000Z	ror		thanks white_eagle
2008-04-30T01:55:00.000Z	ror		how come the upgrade manager thought I had server edition?
2008-04-30T01:56:00.000Z	Pelo	ror	got the server edition metapackage installed ?
2008-04-30T01:57:00.000Z	Pelo	ror	you sure ? that would be my guess,  if you installed  ubuntu-server at some point in the past ( I think that's the name of the package) ,  the upgrade looks for metapackages to do it's work I beleive
2008-04-30T01:57:00.000Z	ror	Pelo	I've never installed ubuntu-server unless it's a requirement for SQL server
2008-04-30T01:58:00.000Z	Pelo	ror	that's the only thing I can think of that would do that
2008-04-30T01:58:00.000Z	Pelo	ror	x is getting upgraded as well
2008-04-30T01:58:00.000Z	ror	Pelo	but it wants to *remove* loads of stuff, not upgrade, or install new
2008-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	Pelo	ror	itremoves then it installs,  but at this point I'm not sure what is going on ,  you can always   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop once you are done and rebooted if the desktop stuff is gone,  your settings and data are safe on your /home
2008-04-30T02:03:00.000Z	Pelo	ror	generaly it is a good idea to disable extra repos and  to reinstalll  ubuntu-desktop to make sure all those pacakges are available for upgrade
