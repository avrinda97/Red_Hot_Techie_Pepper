2007-10-30T00:33:00.000Z	tuna-fish		anyone know what optimized firefox builds are available now?
2007-10-30T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	what do you mean by optimised
2007-10-30T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	why do you want that ?
2007-10-30T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	processor optimisation on a web browser will get you nothing
2007-10-30T00:35:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	because the standard firefox build is completely unresponsive for 15 secs when I try to open all my procrastination bookmarks into new tabs, while swiftfox used to only take 3 secs or so
2007-10-30T00:35:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	thats going to be nothing to do with processor optimisations at build time
2007-10-30T00:36:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	invstigate the problems with firefox
2007-10-30T00:37:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	it's just slow when it opens 50+ tabs. nothing to do about it...
2007-10-30T00:37:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	50+ tabs ! of course its going to be slow
2007-10-30T00:38:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	using sse2 really helps firefox render stuff
2007-10-30T00:38:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	but swiftfox isn't
2007-10-30T00:38:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	just don't open 50 tabs at once
2007-10-30T00:38:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	why not if it can be done?
2007-10-30T00:38:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	because the hassle of maintaing a specific package for a minimal user base is crazy
2007-10-30T00:39:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	but it has been done, in swiftfox and swiftweasel
2007-10-30T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	tuna-fish	then why are you asking what the products are ?
2007-10-30T00:39:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	as said, i didn't know the name of swiftweasel, just knew it existed
2007-10-30T00:40:00.000Z	tuna-fish	ikonia	and swiftfox has licensing issues
