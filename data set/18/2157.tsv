2011-07-06T20:54:00.000Z	tilerendering		hi
2011-07-06T20:54:00.000Z	tilerendering		ouch - my root pwd seems to be gone
2011-07-06T20:54:00.000Z	tilerendering		any idea how to recover that
2011-07-06T20:54:00.000Z	tilerendering		?
2011-07-06T20:54:00.000Z	scorchgeek	tilerendering	well, usually in ubuntu you don't have a root password...
2011-07-06T20:54:00.000Z	tilerendering		well but... I cant figure the pwd for sudo either :/
2011-07-06T20:55:00.000Z	scorchgeek	tilerendering	it's your own
2011-07-06T20:55:00.000Z	scorchgeek		if you don't know your own password, well, that's another problem :)
2011-07-06T20:55:00.000Z	tilerendering	scorchgeek	the problem is, I dont have my own pwd anymore :/
2011-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	tilerendering		yes
2011-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	scorchgeek	tilerendering	if you boot in recovery mode you should get a root prompt with no password
2011-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	tilerendering		ouch
2011-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	tilerendering		ouch ouch ouch :/
2011-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	tilerendering		itÂ´s an amazon ec2 instance...
2011-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	tilerendering		I dont want to reboot before saving everything, which means I need su ;/
2011-07-06T20:57:00.000Z	scorchgeek	tilerendering	doesn't ec2 have an option to reset your password somewhere?
2011-07-06T20:57:00.000Z	tilerendering		:/ damn...
2011-07-06T20:57:00.000Z	scorchgeek	tilerendering	(no idea, just thinking it seems like there should be)
