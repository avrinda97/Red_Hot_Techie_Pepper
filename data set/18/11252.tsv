2006-08-24T08:04:00.000Z	Don_jr		Any aproximates on how long the install could take?
2006-08-24T08:06:00.000Z	Don_jr		So the spyware and virus problems that windows has is not as great on the *nix systems?
2006-08-24T08:07:00.000Z	Don_jr		I won't have the problems with spyware and virus's in unix for browsing around?  That sounds nice.
2006-08-24T08:08:00.000Z	Don_jr		I just want to try it out.  Been using windows for ever and I"m tired of the microsoft monopoly.
2006-08-24T08:08:00.000Z	Don_jr		That's great.  I"m liking this more and more.  And Iv'e heard it's fairly simple to run a web server on a unix system aswell?
2006-08-24T08:09:00.000Z	Don_jr		apache I believe was the name used?
2006-08-24T08:09:00.000Z	Don_jr		Only thing that get's me is how much am I going to have to learn to program in c or any other language to make things work.
2006-08-24T08:10:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	none.
2006-08-24T08:10:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	but if you know any programming, you can have a lot of fun in linux
2006-08-24T08:10:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	you may have to compile a program here and there but its not difficult
2006-08-24T08:12:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	ls is a command, bash is the shell in which you execute that command
2006-08-24T08:12:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	kind of like how COmmand.com is the shell you execute the "dir" command in at a dos promp
2006-08-24T08:13:00.000Z	Don_jr	tnzr	thanx, that makes sense
2006-08-24T08:13:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	no prob
2006-08-24T08:14:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	you only need to know how to program in bash if you want to write scripts to automate certain tasks
2006-08-24T08:15:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	its not for troubleshooting but it can be.. you can do all sorts of stuff with bash once you get good at it.. but its not a requirement.  lots of weathered *nix users dont know the first thing about shell scripting
2006-08-24T08:27:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	if you installed X without a window manager, youd start it up and see a black/white crosshatched pattern as the background with a little "x" mouse cursor
2006-08-24T08:27:00.000Z	tnzr	Don_jr	then you run something like gnome or KDE or Fluxbox or what have you, and suddenly it becomes pretty
