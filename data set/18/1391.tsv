2011-05-30T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	install lshw-gtk

2011-05-30T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	some commands have /help or --help
2011-05-30T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	its worth a try
2011-05-30T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	sudo lshw -C sound
2011-06-03T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	look into chown
2011-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	can you expand on "root folder" as well, chowning the system will make it not work
2011-06-03T22:40:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	ActionParsnip	In properties?
2011-06-03T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	what are you intending to chown
2011-06-03T22:41:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	ActionParsnip	I recently removed windows and backed up my files, I just want to put some CAD files back into the folder so I can access them from that program (running under wine)
2011-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	then put them in ~/.wine/drive_c
2011-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	there is no root folder involved
2011-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	ActionParsnip	im not able. theyre in the root folder and it is locked
2011-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Trfsrfr	then chown your home folder back to your user, thats all
2011-06-03T22:43:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	ActionParsnip	you make it sound so easy...
2011-06-03T22:47:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	ActionParsnip	thanks! I think I figured it out.
