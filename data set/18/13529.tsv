2005-12-21T07:53:00.000Z	GameCat		hi - anyone in who knows about the hotplug system?
2005-12-21T07:53:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	noone :D
2005-12-21T07:53:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	or at least not you :)
2005-12-21T07:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	just tell us what is the problem
2005-12-21T07:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	try this command on main user 'groups' - then you'll see your problem
2005-12-21T07:55:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	I will, ta...
2005-12-21T08:03:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	checked the groups, but don't think it helps - it was working for all users until I added another hdd to the computer (which isn't mounted at all when booted to linux) - any other ideas?
2005-12-21T08:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	there will be error messages in /var/log/messages
2005-12-21T08:04:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	first place i looked - no errors shown
2005-12-21T08:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	& you have tried a reboot?
2005-12-21T08:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	cold boot that is
2005-12-21T08:06:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	yeah, it's been a week since the new hdd, and no joy - machine is turned off at night
2005-12-21T08:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	idea - are both these disks IDE on the same channel? if so, might be jumpering problem - slave/master?
2005-12-21T08:09:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	the new disk is a sata, the usb is a thumbdrive
2005-12-21T08:10:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	but the usb loads as sdb1 for the main user - when anyonme else plugs in it still shows on the desktop, but clicking gets error about sdb1 not existing
2005-12-21T08:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	GameCat	oh - looks like the one user can access the thumb drive - & other users fail perms for some reason & the rest of hotplug craps out - I'm guessing here
2005-12-21T08:11:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	one user can indeed use the usb socket for stuff, all others fail, with thumbdrives/removable hdds/CF reader (all the stuff i have to test)
2005-12-21T08:12:00.000Z	GameCat	frogzoo	it's not JUST the thumbdrive, and it's very annoying :/
