2009-08-16T08:31:00.000Z	Uberoff		I prefer the clean dynamic interface of openbox, personally. I find gnome repugnant in the extreme.
2009-08-16T08:31:00.000Z	Berzerker	Uberoff	openbox?
2009-08-16T08:31:00.000Z	Uberoff		but live and let live, I say ;)
2009-08-16T08:32:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	openbox is a lightweight wm
2009-08-16T08:32:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	window manager. It's the only wm i use anymore
2009-08-16T08:32:00.000Z	Berzerker	Uberoff	looks interesting.
2009-08-16T08:32:00.000Z	Berzerker	Uberoff	would you mind helping me get it setup on my comp?
2009-08-16T08:33:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	well, to tell you the truth, it's the kind of window manager that if you can't install and configure it yourself, your probably better off using a "bigger" wm. Or maybe even XFCE4 or something
2009-08-16T08:34:00.000Z	Berzerker	Uberoff	what's so different about it?
2009-08-16T08:35:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	 install it and see. You can switch between wm's when ubuntu boots
2009-08-16T08:35:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	 "sudo apt-get install openbox" I imagine
2009-08-16T08:35:00.000Z	Berzerker		ok
2009-08-16T08:36:00.000Z	Berzerker	Uberoff	then just log out and switch VMs?
2009-08-16T08:36:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	yeah. It's WMs (Window Managers)
2009-08-16T08:36:00.000Z	Berzerker		ok. thanks
2009-08-16T08:36:00.000Z	Berzerker		brb
2009-08-16T08:38:00.000Z	Uberoff	Berzerker	 chances are you won't like it at first. Most ppl don't. I probably didn't. As you get more experienced with *nix it grows on you
2009-08-16T08:39:00.000Z	Berzerker	Uberoff	lol you said lightweight. you weren't kidding.
