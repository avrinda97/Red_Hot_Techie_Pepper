2008-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	cshadowrun		anyone know a nice media player with support for shout/ice streams, and global hotkeys?
2008-08-26T05:55:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	I use MPD and audacious
2008-08-26T05:55:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	audacious doesn't work with streams :o
2008-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	pastebin the error.
2008-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	kk, i'll get the lastest version from their site too
2008-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	btw audacious is meant to work identically like winamp... that means playing streams and such.
2008-08-26T05:58:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	it even is able to use winamp skins :P

2008-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	buffer underrun... sounds like a bug.
2008-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	and it works fine if i play a .ogg file
2008-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	i know, it's with every stream i've tried
2008-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	i went to the audacious channel and asked them about it, they told me that they didn't care, and that i should use a diffrent media player... -.-
2008-08-26T06:13:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	theres already a bug report open on there forum for my bug, i don't think they are going to bother to fix it
2008-08-26T06:13:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	also baring in mind i had a developer tell me that "I don't care" and "Go and use something else then"
2008-08-26T06:13:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	its the best you can do then unfortunately.
2008-08-26T06:14:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	have you tried VLC?
2008-08-26T06:14:00.000Z	cshadowrun	Expl01ted	yea, i applied a theme and it broke, :(
2008-08-26T06:14:00.000Z	Expl01ted	cshadowrun	dude your luck is crap.
