2008-12-26T04:02:00.000Z	justizin	arbir	what sequence of events led up to this message, say, roughly since the last working upgrade? :)
2008-12-26T04:03:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	well.. around 10 days, back, in the middle of an update my PC just rebooted. and then i used somebody's advice here, to somehow resume update.. now again i am having this problem
2008-12-26T04:03:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	can i not rebuild that file ?
2008-12-26T04:04:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	i backed up the status file... but that backed up status file was not a good one. we made changes to the status file and re-ran apt-get update
2008-12-26T04:05:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	and now, i am not able to install any application , or update ...
2008-12-26T04:05:00.000Z	justizin	arbir	ouch, that doesn't sound fun.  also i'd need to know what changes you made.  any idea who helped you?
2008-12-26T04:05:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	is there no way to rebuild this file ? googling made me find this perl script which does it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474587     But i am not trusting it
2008-12-26T04:05:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	it was somebody called tinman
2008-12-26T04:06:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	some, onetinman, or something like that.
2008-12-26T04:09:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	what do i do now ?
2008-12-26T04:09:00.000Z	justizin	arbir	sorry, juggling convos, let me scroll a bit ;)
2008-12-26T04:09:00.000Z	justizin	arbir	do you have a log of your past convo?  also, have you considered reading this script you don't trust and trying to learn more.
2008-12-26T04:11:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	reading through past things..... i dont really understand that.....
2008-12-26T04:11:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	and i was always wondering, is there no way to rebuild this file ?
2008-12-26T04:12:00.000Z	arbir	justizin	even if it takes 1 hr to rebuild this file.. i am prepared to do this
2008-12-26T04:12:00.000Z	justizin	arbir	sure, i just don't know how, you need to take this opportunity to learn more about apt, what that file is.
