2006-01-02T17:07:00.000Z	cloudeh		hi guys. I need some help :(
2006-01-02T17:08:00.000Z	cloudeh		I was introduced to linux by my friend storm. But i can't install it. the partitioner won't work. I have 25GB free space but the partitioner will only let me resize my HDD by a few MB. I've tried defragmentation but that didn't help.
2006-01-02T17:09:00.000Z	pashaw	cloudeh	  freee space inside another partition  or  unformatted sitting there?
2006-01-02T17:10:00.000Z	pashaw	cloudeh	  youll need to make backups  then  resize that partition
2006-01-02T17:10:00.000Z	pashaw	cloudeh	  your friend should come over and help you seriously   you could lose everything
