2007-11-04T14:25:00.000Z	Wikzo		Can anyone tell me where my home made Emblems are stored in Ubuntu 7.10?
2007-11-04T14:26:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	since you asked so many times now i'm curious... what are Emblems?
2007-11-04T14:28:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	This is an Emblem. http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/10/23/find-files-with-an-emblem
2007-11-04T14:29:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	ooo... i'm on kde, that's why i didn't know, thx
2007-11-04T14:29:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	Heh :)
2007-11-04T14:29:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	I use them as tags for my school work
2007-11-04T14:30:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	ok... i'm willing to risk they are in a hidden folder in ~
2007-11-04T14:30:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	probly smth like /home/wikzo/.emblems
2007-11-04T14:30:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	One with "Math" and one with "Danish" etc.
2007-11-04T14:30:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	I know, something like that. I have tried to search, but there is many folders with default Emblems
2007-11-04T14:31:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	well, i really can't help you there, i never used gnome
2007-11-04T14:31:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	:)
2007-11-04T14:36:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	See this. The Emblem function is really smart :) http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=49042&d=1194168920
2007-11-04T14:37:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	i wonder if there's anything like that in kde... those might prove useful. can you organize by emblem through nautilus?
2007-11-04T14:37:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	Yep. I am almost sure it is only a GNOME function - maybe there is a port or something for KDE?
2007-11-04T14:38:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	like a plugin for konqueror or smth
2007-11-04T14:38:00.000Z	Wikzo	leo_rockw	I dunno anything about KDE, so can't help with that :)
2007-11-04T14:38:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Wikzo	i shall ask my friend google about it, haha
