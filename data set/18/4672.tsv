2010-09-29T00:56:00.000Z	gmaculo		how do i disable the default sorting of hidden files and case insensitivity in ls? -- also noticed command line regexp are also case insensitive.. how do i turn that crap off?
2010-09-29T00:56:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	what do you mean by "command line regexp are also case insensitive"?
2010-09-29T00:57:00.000Z	gmaculo		like when i do cp [a-f]* , it copies files starting with A-F also
2010-09-29T00:58:00.000Z	gmaculo		---on ext3, not fat
2010-09-29T00:59:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	that's globbing, not regexp.  I didn't know that was enabled by default, what does this return: shopt nocaseglob
2010-09-29T01:00:00.000Z	gmaculo		says on...
2010-09-29T01:00:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	turn it off I suppose.  What version of ubuntu is this?
2010-09-29T01:00:00.000Z	gmaculo		10.04
2010-09-29T01:02:00.000Z	gmaculo		doing the same regardless of that setting
2010-09-29T01:02:00.000Z	gmaculo		:P
2010-09-29T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	pastebin a series of commands that shows that
2010-09-29T01:08:00.000Z	gmaculo	jrib	http://pastebin.com/C7tY77FD
2010-09-29T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	this shows me nothing...
2010-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	gmaculo	jrib	ideally, it is supposed to sort with . first, caps next, then lowercase. the cp [a-z]* test2 is ONLY supposed to copy files starting with lowerase
2010-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	you need to show the nocaseglob setting, then run some simple command that shows it globbing with case insensitivity or whatever
2010-09-29T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	we're talking about globbing not sorting
2010-09-29T01:12:00.000Z	gmaculo		ugh. nevermind ..
2010-09-29T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	gmaculo	why?
