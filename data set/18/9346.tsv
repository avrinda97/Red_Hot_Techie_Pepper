2007-04-19T06:36:00.000Z	Scombr0_		i tried all things i thought could fix.. but my options are goe now :S
2007-04-19T06:36:00.000Z	Scombr0_		now i can see the screen but is all grey and dark :S
2007-04-19T06:36:00.000Z	Scombr0_		im on the console thru SSH with my laptop
2007-04-19T06:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	boot in recovery mode and edit xorg.conf to use the vesa driver
2007-04-19T06:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	yeah, that works too
2007-04-19T06:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	what video card?
2007-04-19T06:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	should work great with the nvidia-glx package
2007-04-19T06:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	unless installing the .run file broke something
2007-04-19T06:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg
2007-04-19T06:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	yeah
2007-04-19T06:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	as long as it's less than 3
2007-04-19T06:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	don't use nvidia-xconfig
2007-04-19T06:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	I told you _not_ to run nvidia-xconfig
2007-04-19T06:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg
2007-04-19T06:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	that should at least give you a working X
2007-04-19T06:52:00.000Z	Scombr0_	Amaranth	it works.. but looks all grey.. with a really really poor definition and very dark
2007-04-19T07:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	Scombr0_	I don't know what you've done to your system
