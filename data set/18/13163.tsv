2005-12-31T08:27:00.000Z	jana		yay, works! Thanks :D
2005-12-31T08:29:00.000Z	jana		Another silly question: I have a FAT32 partition and i can't add and/or delete files, because i have no permission. Is there any other way to change it besides logging as root and changing permission manually?
2005-12-31T08:29:00.000Z	jana		i need to run visudo first
2005-12-31T08:30:00.000Z	jana		oh wait, i need to run visudo before su -s, sorry :/
2005-12-31T08:30:00.000Z	jana		sudo works
2005-12-31T08:32:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	you appear to have something a bit mixed up, visudo is for editing /etc/sudoers file - that has little or nothing to do with the fat32 partition
2005-12-31T08:32:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	the fat32 partition is owned by a user >> ls /media/ -l <<and see who owns it
2005-12-31T08:35:00.000Z	jana	ompaul	the disk i need is owned by root
2005-12-31T08:38:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	so do this >> chmod 777 /media/whatever<< that will allow you deal with it any as any user - but if there are scripts there any user on the machine can use them
2005-12-31T08:40:00.000Z	jana	ompaul	"Operation tnot permitted" :-/
2005-12-31T08:41:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	sorry I assumed you would know stick a sudo infront of that command to get it again uparrow and press the home key and type sudo space :)
2005-12-31T08:43:00.000Z	jana	ompaul	 oh O_O
2005-12-31T08:44:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	no working for you?
2005-12-31T08:52:00.000Z	jana	ompaul	nothing happened, permission didn't change :/
2005-12-31T08:54:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	okay so >>mkdir fatimage<< in your home directory >>cd /home/username/fatimage ; cp -R /whereverfatis/* .<< then >>chown -R username:username * << that will copy all the files into your home dir and allow you to do anything you want with them
2005-12-31T08:56:00.000Z	jana	ompaul	that won't work, my FAT32 partition is 62GB big, and this  one is 16GB + 30% used
2005-12-31T08:57:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	so copy what yoiu need
2005-12-31T09:00:00.000Z	ompaul	jana	sorry that was for you >>>> http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/winmac_fstab
