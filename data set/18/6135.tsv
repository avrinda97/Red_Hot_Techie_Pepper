2008-08-01T01:32:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	this does not sound like a mp3 problem at all
2008-08-01T01:33:00.000Z	Blaqlight	anirudh0	now its someone else's problem :P
2008-08-01T01:46:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	 which also rocks :)
2008-08-01T01:50:00.000Z	Blaqlight	anirudh0	I route mine to my 60 inch plasma tv :D
2008-08-01T01:50:00.000Z	Blaqlight	anirudh0	as long as you have the video outs...

2008-08-01T01:51:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	nice..thanks
2008-08-01T01:51:00.000Z	Blaqlight	anirudh0	try to use the monitor bale though if your tv supports it.
2008-08-01T01:52:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	you mean to say that a plain old tv would work?
2008-08-01T01:52:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	my tv is ancient..not even flat
2008-08-01T01:52:00.000Z	Blaqlight	anirudh0	it would look like garbage... but if you have the right cables...
2008-08-01T15:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	160 GB is a marketing gimmick
2008-08-01T15:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	no drives ever have the full capacity..always in powers of 2
2008-08-01T16:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	Blaqlight	conveniently taking 1000 instead of the real binary closest value, that is 1024
