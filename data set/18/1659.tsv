2012-08-26T18:59:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	what is not working?
2012-08-26T19:00:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	installing the 12.04.1-alt-amd64. Failes on "Select and install software"
2012-08-26T19:00:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	did you make a integrity check? md5sum bla.iso?
2012-08-26T19:01:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	syslog shows "xserver-xorg-video-radeon" is not installable
2012-08-26T19:01:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	coze i had a similiar problem during the installation. I tried to install from ubs-stick. but the used program for the usbstick made a mistake
2012-08-26T19:02:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	from dvd/cd or usbstick? if usb-stick use unetbootin
2012-08-26T19:02:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	I'll re-make and give it a shot. I'll try anything at this point.
2012-08-26T19:02:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	so youre trying it from usb-stick?
2012-08-26T19:02:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	yes.
2012-08-26T19:03:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	used the build in usb-stick-maker of ubuntu?
2012-08-26T19:03:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	used another app "Live linux usb creator" I've always used it.
2012-08-26T19:04:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	just try it with unetbootin. It took hours for me to figure out, that the build in usb--stick-maker was fu**** up
2012-08-26T19:05:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	thanks. I'm downloading it now.
2012-08-26T19:05:00.000Z	subz3r0	systemd0wn	you're welcome
2012-08-26T19:17:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	haha! Used unetbootin, then when loaded i did a media integrity check and it failed.
2012-08-26T19:19:00.000Z	systemd0wn	subz3r0	compairing it against: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04.1/MD5SUMS yes it is.
