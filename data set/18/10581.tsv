2006-11-12T10:26:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan		yes
2006-11-12T10:26:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan		folders there
2006-11-12T10:27:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan		but slow load
2006-11-12T10:27:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan		on safari too
2006-11-12T10:29:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan		can't change my hostname by changing /etc/hosts... any ideas?
2006-11-12T10:30:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan		Alethes... did that... still showing original hostname even after restart.  strange
2006-11-12T10:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mjmtaiwan	What's /etc/hostname read now?
2006-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan	tonyyarusso	get that?
2006-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mjmtaiwan	ya
2006-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mjmtaiwan	That's your hosts file, not hostname
2006-11-12T10:34:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan	tonyyarusso	$hostname mmorrison-desktop (that is what I set it during desktop install)
2006-11-12T10:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mjmtaiwan	So you just need to change the /etc/hostname file still
2006-11-12T10:38:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan	tonyyarusso	I'm following this howtoforge prefect ubuntu setup and it says to modify the /etc/hosts.  Then use hostname to confirm.
2006-11-12T10:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mjmtaiwan	You have to change both files.  hostname specifies the name.  hosts specifies what computers your computer knows about, and it's usually a good idea for it to know itself.
2006-11-12T10:41:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan	tonyyarusso	Hmm... they must have missed that step.  So change /etc/hostname and restart. (I already installed the rest of the vmware files already... I don't need to redo the whole thing I guess?)
2006-11-12T10:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mjmtaiwan	I don't even think you have to restart, but maybe.
2006-11-12T10:42:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan	tonyyarusso	Thanks... restarting... I'll let you know.
2006-11-12T10:44:00.000Z	mjmtaiwan	tonyyarusso	Well done... thank you!
