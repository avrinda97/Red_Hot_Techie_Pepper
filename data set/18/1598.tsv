2011-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	ubottu: I'm not  even talking about file sharing. Just simple DNS recognition, so I can ping, ssh (and later git) from Windows peer machines
2011-05-26T13:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	only thing is setup up your network correctly. Do you have a IP already?
2011-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	Do have an IP. Able to ping to IP address. However, doesn't appear in DNS server. I've seen many discussion on dhcp3 configuration files, but no luck.
2011-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	paste sudo cat /etc/resolv.conf
2011-05-26T13:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	can you ping the IP's of the nameservers?
2011-05-26T13:24:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	able to ping
2011-05-26T13:26:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	so what happens when you do a: ping google.com
2011-05-26T13:27:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	problem is pinging FROM peer Windows machine to the Ubunto box (by name. by IP works).
2011-05-26T13:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	 so your DNS resolving works
2011-05-26T13:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	you need a local DNS that can resolve the names
2011-05-26T13:28:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	I do have a DNS locally on my local network. Problem is that my ubuntu box isn't registered there. I don't know why. All other Windows boxes are there
2011-05-26T13:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	is it a real DNS server or something in a DSL-Router?
2011-05-26T13:31:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	it is a very real DNS server: Window server 2008. The DHCP service is on the same box.
2011-05-26T13:33:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	Aaah, Okay thats a totally different thing. Not shure how to tweak the Windows stuff, it's possible but I don't know how.
2011-05-26T13:34:00.000Z	uri	schnuffle	Do you know anything about the Ubuntu: /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file? There are few pages on the Internet that suggests the problem is there.
2011-05-26T13:35:00.000Z	schnuffle	uri	could be but I'm familliar enough with it. I have  Win2008 servers running but the DNS is made by my linux boxes
