2010-11-23T11:42:00.000Z	randall84_		Question: I want to change the display settings when browsing the file system via firefox for uploading photos. Currently display is a tiny thumbnail that I can't even see, but mainly in list form. I want to be able to make the thumbnail bigger. Any suggestions?

2010-11-23T11:43:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	I'm on a laptop, so I have no mouse wheel
2010-11-23T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	ctrl + shift + plus then
2010-11-23T11:44:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	Thanks... I'll give it a try
2010-11-23T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	its also available in the view menu
2010-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	Negative on  ctrl, shift, plus symbol
2010-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	I'm using ubuntu 10.10 with GNOME
2010-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	the DE is moot
2010-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	where can I find the view menu
2010-11-23T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	look at the top ofthebrowser...next to edit...
2010-11-23T11:48:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	on the photo uploader, there are no menu options at the top the way they typically are in a browser
2010-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	if its in firefox, its there
2010-11-23T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	view a regular web page and look at the top, a stock firefox hasit
2010-11-23T11:50:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	yes, typical firefox browser has it... however the facebook photo uploader does not
2010-11-23T11:52:00.000Z	randall84_	ActionParsnip	the zoom function works on regular sites, but not for increasing thumbnail size on the photo uploader
2010-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	use the basic uploader, could try the zoom feature in compiz if you use it
2010-11-23T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randall84_	moan to the site then
