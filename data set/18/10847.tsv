2007-04-25T14:24:00.000Z	Kim^J		Who broke Postgresql 8.2???
2007-04-25T14:24:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	someone did?
2007-04-25T14:25:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	It's not starting.
2007-04-25T14:25:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	I would suppose someone checked if it worked before it was released, but I don't use it
2007-04-25T14:26:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	I don't know anymore, both Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora have really low quality on some packages.
2007-04-25T14:26:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	sudo invoke-rc.d postgresql start maybe. if it doesn't work I'd check the log file in /var/log
2007-04-25T14:27:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	I see
2007-04-25T14:27:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.2 start doesn't give ANYTHING at all.
2007-04-25T14:27:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	maybe it started then
2007-04-25T14:27:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	Nope.
2007-04-25T14:27:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	log files?
2007-04-25T14:28:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	No /tmp/postgresql.sock thing
2007-04-25T14:28:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	log files?
2007-04-25T14:28:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	None
2007-04-25T14:30:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	ps -e|grep postgres? nothing?
2007-04-25T14:30:00.000Z	Kim^J	mwe	Nope, nothing.
2007-04-25T14:30:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	really odd.
2007-04-25T14:31:00.000Z	mwe	Kim^J	I doubt someone has been so retarded to release a not working program
