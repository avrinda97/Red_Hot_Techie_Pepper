2007-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	mikubuntu		i have an iso downloaded to my desktop... how do i get it onto cd?
2007-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	right click -> burn to disc
2007-08-21T16:58:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	thanks, will try that
2009-12-10T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	is anything on your desktop?  Can you right click on your desktop?
2009-12-10T06:16:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	and mMezquitale, no nothing happens when i right click on desktop, and well, i guess each thing i had on the desktop is actually a link to its location in the filesystem
2009-12-10T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	run nautilus
2009-12-10T06:17:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	and .. ?
2009-12-10T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	and report result?
2009-12-10T06:20:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	don't know what to report, i typed nautilus in a terminal, and the nautilus filesys opened
2009-12-10T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	well now see if the problem persists or if anything changed
2009-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	voila, they're all back .. but WHY?
2009-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	nautilus handles that stuff, it crashed for some reason
2009-12-10T06:22:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	it would be nice to toggle that on and off, is there a way?
2009-12-10T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	toggle what exactly?
2009-12-10T06:22:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	having all that mess i have on my desktop on and off
2009-12-10T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	you can use toggle the gconf key that has nautilus show_desktop on and off (use gconftool-2 command)
2009-12-10T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	mikubuntu	you want to toggle the show_desktop key.  Of course, you want to learn to use gconftool-2 instead of the gconf-editor to do it
2009-12-10T06:31:00.000Z	mikubuntu	jrib	thx i will check out the page
