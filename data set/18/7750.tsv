2007-12-02T09:17:00.000Z	linux88		when i go to www.whatismyip.com it is giving me i believe my dslam ip, and not a lan ip like 192.168.1.., so i was wondering why is that
2007-12-02T09:18:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	also 192.168.x.x is one of 3 private address ranges, these are not allowed and not valid on the public internet
2007-12-02T09:19:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	i see, so it's getting the ip from the server im goig through to get to the internet?
2007-12-02T09:20:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	that IP is the one your ISP gives you
2007-12-02T09:20:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	oh, ok so thats some how a static ip?
2007-12-02T09:20:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	you have a router?
2007-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	yes i do
2007-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	it's most likely dynamic
2007-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	ya i use dhcp
2007-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	im just trying o figure out if someone somehow got that ip, could they scan my local network?
2007-12-02T09:22:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	your router will block everything unless you forward ports
2007-12-02T09:22:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	dutchie86 ya it is
2007-12-02T09:23:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	dutchie86  how can i check how many server i go through before i get to the internet
2007-12-02T09:24:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	you can trace the path between you and a server with traceroute, e.g. traceroute google.com
2007-12-02T09:25:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	ok, but how can I tell which servers im going through are form my network,say att, until i get ou into the open?
2007-12-02T09:26:00.000Z	astro76	linux88	it will probably be clear from the results
2007-12-02T09:26:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	ok
2007-12-02T09:27:00.000Z	linux88	astro76	yes it was thanks. i always knew how traceroute worked but never used it ;)
