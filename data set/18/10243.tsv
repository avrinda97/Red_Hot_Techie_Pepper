2006-12-28T09:53:00.000Z	genius314		How do I know the BudID of my video cards?
2006-12-28T09:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	Using the "lspci" command.
2006-12-28T09:55:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	The value is in hexadecimals, right? So 0d is 13, and 0f is 15?
2006-12-28T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	...what?
2006-12-28T09:56:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	the values it gives me are 00:0d.0 and 00:0f.0
2006-12-28T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	I have no idea; never messed around with those values.
2006-12-28T09:58:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	Ok. Well, I think I can figure it out from here.
2006-12-28T10:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	I don't, and I'm fine.
2006-12-28T10:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	I use pandora, it works fine for me; konqueror is KDE's browser.
2006-12-28T10:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	Because the format is free and the compression is bette.r
2007-01-03T06:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	Do you have a hardware midi mixer?
2007-01-03T06:46:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	I guess
2007-01-03T06:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	Oh, then I can't help you. Sorry. :(
2007-01-03T06:46:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	What is a hardware midi mixer?
2007-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	Uh... like, your sound card is capable of playing midi files, I think.
2007-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	Then yeah, I have that.
2007-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	genius314	...I really don't know much or anything about midi. Wikipedia will tell you what a hardware mixer is.
2007-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	genius314	arrenlex	Ok.
