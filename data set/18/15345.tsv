2005-05-20T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2005-05-20T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	also, it was explained to you during the install
2005-05-20T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	and it's in the FAQ
2005-05-29T07:53:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	you will need to configure it carefully
2005-05-29T07:53:00.000Z	bitsmash	bob2	a config file?
2005-05-29T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	yes, because ubuntu-base Depends on mutt
2005-05-29T08:22:00.000Z	bitsmash	bob2	: how come? mutt is a mail program no?
2005-05-29T08:25:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	you already have X installed
2005-05-29T08:25:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	ubuntu-base Depends on mutt because ubuntu-base is designed to provide a nice text unix system
2005-05-29T08:26:00.000Z	bitsmash	bob2	how you know i have x installed?
2005-05-29T08:27:00.000Z	bitsmash	bob2	server
2005-05-29T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	install ubuntu-desktop then
2005-05-29T08:30:00.000Z	bitsmash	bob2	thats a lot of packages
2005-05-29T08:30:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	yes

2005-05-29T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	bitsmash	but be warned the binary flash plugin is pretty crap and will make firefox quite crashy
