2008-06-08T02:49:00.000Z	sensae		I just reinstalled Windows and overwrote GRUB - I tried reinstalling grub to the MBR and now when I boot I can see my old grub items, but none of them will boot
2008-06-08T02:49:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	what error do you get?
2008-06-08T02:50:00.000Z	sensae	cycom	Error 22
2008-06-08T02:50:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	what does error 22 mean? do you know?
2008-06-08T02:53:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	ok. what that means is that your menu.lst is likely pointing to the wrong partition
2008-06-08T02:53:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	what does your /boot/grub/menu.lst say for your root?
2008-06-08T02:53:00.000Z	sensae	cycom	Let me mount the partition real quick
2008-06-08T02:53:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	no prob.
2008-06-08T02:54:00.000Z	sensae	cycom	I think I found the problem. It's pointing to (hd0,3) for some reason. It should be 0,1
2008-06-08T02:54:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	bingo :)
2008-06-08T02:55:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	what do you think happened? did you alter any partitions when you re-installed windows?
2008-06-08T02:56:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	huh. wonder why it was pointing to (hd0,3) then...
2008-06-08T02:57:00.000Z	sensae	cycom	Dunno. I'm on the same system I'm working on though, so I'll restart and see if it works - thanks for the help
2008-06-08T03:03:00.000Z	sensae	cycom	Well now I'm booted into my drive, but my X server has magically stopped working
2008-06-08T03:03:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	hehe. lucky you!
2008-06-08T03:04:00.000Z	sensae	cycom	Yeah. My monitor goes into standby on VT7
2008-06-08T03:04:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	check to see if your video card has jumped PCI ids or something, or if it has the right pci id in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-06-08T03:07:00.000Z	cycom	sensae	how's the video problem coming?
