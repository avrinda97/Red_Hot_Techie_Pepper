2006-06-19T09:13:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	yeah it's telling me all kinds of dependencies aren't met, including ones that are saying that dep. isn't met
2006-06-19T09:14:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	yah
2006-06-19T09:15:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	There are about 45. I tried installing eclipse-sdk, and it tells me Dependencies not met. eclipse-sdk, eclipse-jdk
2006-06-19T09:16:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	- I'm not spending 20 minutes pasteing all the errors. I'll just install it from source.
2006-06-19T09:16:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	Pasting ONE error does, not about 20
2006-06-19T09:17:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	But it was going through a dependency loop. It was telling me that the dependency I was installing was needed to install it.
2006-06-19T09:21:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	yeah. Eclipse is the only one that's doing it.
2006-06-19T09:22:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	- Look at the site that's got the stuff to put in there, I copy pasted it exactly from there
2006-06-19T09:24:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	http://pastebin.com/718554
2006-06-19T09:25:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	because that's what the website said to include
2006-06-19T09:26:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	http://pastebin.com/718558

2006-06-19T09:28:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	That's the website I went to
2006-06-19T09:30:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	Actually, they do. They have a URL for two different distro's.
2006-06-19T09:31:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	I'm at the right one now.
2006-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	already done and installed
2006-06-19T09:35:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	NoUse	bad thing about doing reverse deps, is that some other deps rely on a dep that's also installed so when you aptitude remove it, i'm sure the others will be removed or stop working
