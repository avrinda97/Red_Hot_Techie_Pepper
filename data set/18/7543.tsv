2008-01-21T06:06:00.000Z	punkshui		hello i'm having problems gaining write access to my hfsplus partition. actually i'm looking for a good way to share files between linux and os x. ideally i would like both operating systems to be able to read and write to all my partitions
2008-01-21T06:07:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	i did that for my girlfriend
2008-01-21T06:08:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	the way i ended up doing it was all through the terminal. it wasn't very stable for me
2008-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	ok, so i've disabled journaling on my os x partition and i can see the partition in ubuntu i've also put it in my fstab but it doesn't load automatically first i have to authenticate as root.
2008-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	have you enabled read / write permissions on the drive?
2008-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	from in os x or ubuntu?
2008-01-21T06:11:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	well I put rw in my fstab line
2008-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	what does the fstab line look like?
2008-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	/dev/sda2       /mnt/osx        hfsplus ro,exec,noauto,users 0  0
2008-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	looks like i just answered my own question there
2008-01-21T06:15:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	okay still no write access.
2008-01-21T06:15:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	did you remount the drive?
2008-01-21T06:15:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	or try to write something as root from the terminal to it
2008-01-21T06:15:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	here is my fstab /dev/sda2       /mnt/osx        hfsplus rw,exec,noauto,users 0  0
2008-01-21T06:16:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	I'll remount now (umount ... && mount ... ) ??
2008-01-21T06:16:00.000Z	Marfi	punkshui	should work. also, check that you have hfsutils installed
2008-01-21T06:20:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	okay now I have read/write access to my hfsplus drive in ubuntu... not to my Users directory but oh well.
2008-01-21T06:37:00.000Z	punkshui	Marfi	I'm now in os x and was wondering how you got the ext3 partition to mount in os x?
