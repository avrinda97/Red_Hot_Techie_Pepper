2005-12-31T11:08:00.000Z	Fixion		does anyone know why sound would not work for a user, and work for admin?
2005-12-31T11:08:00.000Z	pestilence	Fixion	they are not in the audio group
2005-12-31T11:08:00.000Z	Fixion		if I add a user to the audio group, gnome hangs at login
2005-12-31T11:08:00.000Z	Fixion		^when that user logs in
2005-12-31T11:08:00.000Z	pestilence	Fixion	sudo vim /etc/group
2005-12-31T11:09:00.000Z	pestilence	Fixion	hmm
2005-12-31T11:09:00.000Z	Fixion		and when I do add a user to the group (after gnome starts), xmms can't find the pcm device, or the soundcard... nothing
2005-12-31T11:10:00.000Z	Fixion		or the mixer...
2005-12-31T11:10:00.000Z	Fixion	crimsun	a blank screen with the background color...
2005-12-31T11:10:00.000Z	Fixion	crimsun	... and a cursor
2005-12-31T11:10:00.000Z	Fixion	crimsun	0 [CS46xx         ] : CS46xx - Sound Fusion CS46xx Sound Fusion CS46xx at 0x50100000/0x50000000, irq 10
2005-12-31T11:11:00.000Z	Fixion		right now its working (because I started xmms as root)
2005-12-31T11:11:00.000Z	Fixion		but not for any users
2005-12-31T11:12:00.000Z	Fixion	crimsun	as a user... no
2005-12-31T11:12:00.000Z	Fixion		auido open error: permission denied (after some cryptic errors)
2005-12-31T11:12:00.000Z	Fixion		alsa
2005-12-31T11:12:00.000Z	Fixion	crimsun	or it's supposed to be, I'm using alsa as root and it works
2005-12-31T11:13:00.000Z	pestilence	Fixion	what does "groups" return
