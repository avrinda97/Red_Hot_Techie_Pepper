2011-07-25T14:32:00.000Z	Milp_main		thank you
2011-07-25T14:33:00.000Z	Milp_main		the thing is that im looking for a really lightweight browser that is actually useful on common modern sites, like facebook. Because the normal smartphone browsers are really useless and things like chrome or firefox are way too heavy
2011-07-25T14:33:00.000Z	Free-man	Milp_main	opera?
2011-07-25T14:34:00.000Z	Milp_main	Free-man	uh i don't think opera will be that much faster if firefox or even chrome already takes 5 minutes to start
2011-07-25T14:49:00.000Z	Free-man	Milp_main	get PID of server, kill $PID
2011-07-25T14:49:00.000Z	Milp_main	Free-man	how do i get the PID?
2011-07-25T14:49:00.000Z	Free-man	Milp_main	be root
