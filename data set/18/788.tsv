2011-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	thevinci		another question, right now, I have it mounted in 3 different places, /mnt, /svr/ftp/mnt, and /Ant/Music/mnt, when I unmount it, and then eventually remount, I would like it to mount to those same places again automatically, is there a config file i can edit for this?
2011-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	make a batch script
2011-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	ryannathans		bash *
2011-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	thevinci		never made a bash script myself... I'll google it, see if I can come up with something...
2011-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	something like sudo mount /dev/sd? /mnt && sudo mount /dev/sd? /svr/ftp/mnt && sudo mount /dev/sd? /Ant/Music/mnt or use symlinks
2011-10-11T07:39:00.000Z	ryannathans		\o/ wrote a bash script in one line
2011-10-11T07:40:00.000Z	thevinci	ryannathans	how do I make that run automaticly when I plugin my usb HD?
2011-10-11T07:40:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	that's pushing it a bit far ;)
2011-10-11T07:40:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	create an autorun on the hdd and set it up to run that bash script
2011-10-11T07:41:00.000Z	thevinci		haha, alright, I'm sure I can figure something out from here, thanks alot. :)
2011-10-11T07:41:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	the hdd needs to be mounted tho... ;d
2011-10-11T07:41:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	no problem
2011-10-11T07:41:00.000Z	thevinci		<--- lazy and abusing quick and easy solutions on IRC lol
2011-10-11T07:42:00.000Z	ryannathans	thevinci	i practically wrote the bash script for you
2011-10-11T07:42:00.000Z	ryannathans		just replace teh ? with the drive letter
2011-10-11T07:42:00.000Z	ryannathans		and run it when you plug it in
2011-10-11T07:46:00.000Z	thevinci	ryannathans	that you did. But that little seed is all I needed.
