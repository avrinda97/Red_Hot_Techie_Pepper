2006-08-16T16:58:00.000Z	Aranel		Quick question... LTS means that the Ubuntu Dapper repositories will be updated for three years, correct? So it would continue to have the newest versions of software like GNOME, Firefox, MPlayer, etc. until those three years are up?
2006-08-16T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	no, I believe you will only get security updates
2006-08-16T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	but you can always upgrade to the next release every 6 months
2006-08-16T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	correct, edgy is not planned to be LTS
2006-08-16T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	#ubuntu+1 is dedicated to edgy, maybe someone there can help you out
2008-04-27T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	refer to them using UUID instead
2008-04-27T19:54:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	how can I do it ?
2008-04-27T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	what exactly do you want to do that depends on the names?
2008-04-27T19:56:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	I want to stop them or change fstab for UUIDs. but I dont know to do it.
2008-04-27T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	what version of ubuntu?
2008-04-27T19:56:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	hardy heron
2008-04-27T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	if you look at your fstab, you should see the partition for / being referred to with a UUID.  That shows you the syntax.  To determine the uuid of a partition, you can use the blkid command
2008-04-27T19:57:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	in my ftab not uuids referred, i'm using /dev/sda1 etc. instead.
2008-04-27T19:58:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	instead of /dev/sda1 you would have:  UUID=long_string_that_is_the_uuid_for_the_partition
2008-04-27T19:59:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	 ok. i used "blkid /dev/sda1" now for gathering uuid. but it didnt give me.
2008-04-27T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	Aranel	just 'sudo blkid'
2008-04-27T20:00:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	ok, thanks :) im trying it now.
2008-04-27T20:10:00.000Z	Aranel	jrib	thank you :) solved.
