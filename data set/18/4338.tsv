2009-07-19T03:41:00.000Z	VCoolio		in bash, how to refer to variable from cli? Like I run "sh script.sh something" how to refer to "something"?  Or is this going to be complex?
2009-07-19T03:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	$1 is the first command line option $2 is the second one an so on
2009-07-19T03:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	$0 is the entire comman line option
2009-07-19T03:42:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	great, will try that, thanx
2009-07-19T03:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	success! thx again (about the $1 etc)
2009-07-19T03:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	no problem
2009-10-19T02:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	hmm, that's quick and disappointing, but clear. thx
2009-10-19T02:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	no
2009-10-19T02:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	those programs save and load the settings via said daemon. one con not function without the other
2010-01-02T22:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	probably you need to pass it as a variable
2010-01-02T22:04:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	do you have an example? I've googled a bit but I can't get it to work
2010-01-02T22:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	the zenity man page has an example
2010-01-02T22:08:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	that's only an example where the options are hardcoded; I want something flexible so the amount of options can vary depending on the input
2010-01-02T22:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	zenity --list --text="Dirs in current folder" --column="NAME" echo */
2010-01-02T22:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	hmm that's new, let me check again
2010-03-09T00:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	pgrep <whatever> or directly pkill <whatever> :)
2010-03-09T00:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	erUSUL	ah, yes; always forget that, having aliases
2010-08-27T02:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	VCoolio	yes ~/bin is added to path if it exist. see ~/.profile
