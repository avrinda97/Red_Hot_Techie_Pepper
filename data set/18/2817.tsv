2010-06-30T12:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abhi_nav	If he knows how to enable VNC in windows you can use Wubi.
2010-06-30T12:35:00.000Z	abhi_nav	Jordan_U	i need to install ubuntu in his pc. not wubi
2010-06-30T12:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abhi_nav	Wubi is Ubuntu.
2010-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abhi_nav	You can also make an OEM install CD, which would basically boot and install without any user interaction.
2010-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	abhi_nav	Jordan_U	ok will see that option too. thanks
