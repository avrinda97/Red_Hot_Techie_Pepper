2007-12-31T02:23:00.000Z	liquidengineer		Hello
2007-12-31T02:23:00.000Z	liquidengineer		I'm setting up a fresh Ubuntu box, and I've got it on my home network
2007-12-31T02:23:00.000Z	liquidengineer		It's got a hostname defined in the Network Setting app
2007-12-31T02:23:00.000Z	liquidengineer		shouldn't I be able to ping that hostname?
2007-12-31T02:23:00.000Z	liquidengineer		right now I get a host not found error
2007-12-31T02:23:00.000Z	liquidengineer		we're on the same local network
2007-12-31T02:25:00.000Z	liquidengineer		I can, however, use the machine's IP address to connect
2007-12-31T02:25:00.000Z	liquidengineer		Am I doing something wrong?
2007-12-31T02:26:00.000Z	nickrud	liquidengineer	you need some kind of domain name resolution, the names are not automatically broadcast to the other machines
2007-12-31T02:27:00.000Z	liquidengineer	nickrud	how do I set that up?
2007-12-31T02:27:00.000Z	liquidengineer		(I can VNC into the computer using its IP easily)
2007-12-31T02:28:00.000Z	nickrud	liquidengineer	I don't know how to do it with windows;  on a standard linux box you can do something like       192.168.1.104  machinename  in /etc/hosts , then the machine with the hosts file would know the name corresponding to that ip address

2007-12-31T02:29:00.000Z	liquidengineer	nickrud	there's not some way to make the ubuntu box broadcast its IP?
2007-12-31T02:30:00.000Z	nickrud	liquidengineer	no, it doesn't work that way.
2007-12-31T02:31:00.000Z	liquidengineer	nickrud	I'm a little confused now. Then what's the point of giving the ubuntu box a hostname at all?
2007-12-31T02:31:00.000Z	nickrud	liquidengineer	unix (and therefore linux) is network oriented, the name is used internally a lot
2007-12-31T02:33:00.000Z	nickrud	liquidengineer	for example, google.com doesn't broadcast it's name, somewhere out on the network there's a file that does exactly what /etc/hosts does. Your computer asks for the ip address of a dns server, then connects to the number it gets back
