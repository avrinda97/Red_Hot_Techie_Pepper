2010-06-29T14:02:00.000Z	ohoj		Ahoi, ist es möglich, im Nautilus (Dateimanager) sich eine bitgenaue Dateigröße anzeigen zu lassen?
2010-06-29T14:03:00.000Z	ohoj		Is it possible to get shown the bitexact size of a file in Nautilus?
2010-06-29T14:05:00.000Z	ohoj		ok, that's what I meant, sry.
2010-06-29T14:05:00.000Z	ohoj		byteexact
2010-06-29T14:05:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	right-click -> Properties -> look at size field
2010-06-29T14:06:00.000Z	ohoj	rww	is exactly not what I was looking for ...
2010-06-29T14:06:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	what exactly are you looking for, then?
2010-06-29T14:08:00.000Z	ohoj	rww	do you want to kidding me?
2010-06-29T14:09:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	no, I'm not. you can't add size in bytes to list view in Nautilus.
2010-06-29T14:10:00.000Z	ohoj	rww	'add ...' Haeh? Are u sure u understand me?
2010-06-29T14:10:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	yes
2010-06-29T14:10:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	feel free to ask #ubuntu-de, they'll tell you the same thing.
2010-06-29T14:11:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	again, this is not something you can do in Nautilus' list view.
2010-06-29T14:12:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	because nobody programmed it as an option
2010-06-29T14:13:00.000Z	ohoj	rww	ok so far, thx anyway :)
2010-06-29T14:20:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	it's mentioned in #ubuntu's terms of service, which are linked from the channel entry message.
2010-06-29T14:21:00.000Z	ohoj	rww	in a second level of reachability ... that means not existant
2010-06-29T14:22:00.000Z	rww	ohoj	considering that "Use of this channel implies acceptance of terms at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/TermsOfService", users should read that page and be aware of it anyway.
