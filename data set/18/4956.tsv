2009-03-16T08:52:00.000Z	Cpudan80		for a single entity that talks to nobody 255..... would be valid ;-)
2009-03-16T08:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80		hacked by the localhost!
2009-03-16T08:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80		you has the spyware !
2009-03-16T08:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80		192.168.1.1 is a good guess ;-)
2009-03-16T08:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80		in most case
2009-03-16T08:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80		192.168.1.255 for broadcast
2009-03-16T08:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80		192.168.1.0 for loopback
2009-03-16T08:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80		255.255.255.0 for submask
2009-03-16T08:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80		that should cover you I think ;-)
2009-03-16T08:55:00.000Z	Cpudan80		127.0.0.1 for the localhost address ;-)
2009-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	racecar56	Cpudan80	they can also be 127.0.0.2 to 127.0.0.8 i believe
2009-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80		hmm
2009-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80		didnt know that
2009-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80		makes sense, 127 is reserved
2009-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	racecar56		yeah
2009-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ScottG489	you need to add a route
2009-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ScottG489	netstat -r
2009-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	racecar56	Cpudan80	127.x, even 127.255.255.255 is loopback
