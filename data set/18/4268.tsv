2009-09-04T22:14:00.000Z	Coilette		when your screen locks up.. what is crashing, and how do i figure out what is crashing it
2009-09-04T22:16:00.000Z	Coilette		yes fccf i can because im not crashed right now
2009-09-04T22:18:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	when it crashes you can drop to a terminal and login... then run top to see what is using up memory or is zombiefied
2009-09-04T22:15:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	can you get to a terminal Ctrl-Alt-F1... If so let's find out
2009-09-04T22:18:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	What are you doing that is causing it to crash... Can you re-create the problem?
2009-09-04T22:20:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	i was just on xchat, and kopete
2009-09-04T22:21:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	when i crashed last i was accpeting a transfer of a picture, but it happens somewhat randomly
2009-09-04T22:23:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	any ideas?
2009-09-04T22:24:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	I am of the opinion that a lot of the software on ubuntu is not stable/complete/ready for real world... so I use the default apps, or I compile what I need... What dist are you running Hardy/Intrepid/jaunty ??
2009-09-04T22:25:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	uh whats 9.04?
2009-09-04T22:25:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	thats Jaunty,
2009-09-04T22:25:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	yeah i like this cuz my wireless card works!!
2009-09-04T22:26:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	I am using 8.04 Hardy Long Term Support, mainly because it is a lot more stable, depending on your wl card you can get it working in Hardy
2009-09-04T22:27:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	it worked in edgy, but not fiesty, or any of the following distro i used
2009-09-04T22:27:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	anyways.. how do i find whats killing my computer, and remove it
2009-09-04T22:39:00.000Z	Coilette	fccf	when my screen locks up.. what is crashing? is it X or what?
2009-09-04T22:40:00.000Z	fccf	Coilette	rather something is causing X to crash, you might look @ /var/log/Xorg.0.log
