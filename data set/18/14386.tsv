2005-08-07T16:56:00.000Z	ma3x	LinuxJones	it's already installed but how can i reinstall it?
2005-08-07T16:56:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	right click the package in synaptic and do reinstall
2005-08-07T05:00:00.000Z	ma3x	LinuxJones	when i reinstall kmail, it asks me for the cd, and i insert the cd and it doesn't show in the menu
2005-08-07T05:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	ok first thing to do is comment out the cd reference in the file /etc/apt/sources.lst
2005-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	you might have to manually add the menu entry, best to ask in #kubuntu to be sure.
2005-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	ma3x	LinuxJones	now i reinstalled it from the internet, but kmail still doesn't show in menu
2005-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for it to appear
2005-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	ma3x	LinuxJones	when i add it under menu, what do i type in the command field, only 'kmail' ?
2005-08-07T05:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	have you done an apt-get update and apt-get upgrade on your system yet since you installed ?
2005-08-07T05:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	yes that outta do it
2005-08-07T05:04:00.000Z	ma3x	LinuxJones	apt-get upgrade not yet, it's 120 M
2005-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	best to get that done if your can
2005-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	it may already be fixed in the upgrade
2005-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	ma3x	LinuxJones	ok, I thank you very much for the assistance!

2005-08-07T05:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ma3x	ok first thing to do is comment out the cd reference in the file /etc/apt/sources.lst  >> sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.lst
