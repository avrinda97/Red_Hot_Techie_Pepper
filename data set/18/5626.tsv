2008-09-26T10:24:00.000Z	yowshi		grrr something is jamming my sound driver and i cant figure out the problem
2008-09-26T10:24:00.000Z	yowshi		i was just listening to something playing on vlc i close it and now i cant play anything else
2008-09-26T10:25:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	yowshi	if i dont use pulseaudio, that happens if i have a browser open like firefox (it locks my audio). also happens with amarok and VirualMachines etc (anything that could use sound)
2008-09-26T10:25:00.000Z	yowshi	Daft_Punk	ooook so mind running me through getting pulse audio to replace alsa? i atempted this once before and it led to disaster and me uninstalling every reference to pulse audio
2008-09-26T10:26:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	yowshi	all i did was System>Preferences>Sound then change the first 3 on the devices tab to PulseAudio

2008-09-26T10:29:00.000Z	yowshi	Daft_Punk	since playing with it when i was using SL buggered my sound system on a repeated basis i went through system package manager and uninstalled every reference to pulse audio i could find and installed everything alsa
2008-09-26T10:30:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	yowshi	when i use alsa, i notice issues with the sound locking, so if i was playing amarok music, then open youtube, i cant listen to youtube. i changed to pulseaudio (on the suggestion of someone else) and now i can listen to both at the same time, but i dont know why it doesnt work for u :( sorry
