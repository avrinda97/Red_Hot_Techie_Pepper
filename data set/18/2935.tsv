2010-01-27T05:29:00.000Z	MrUnix	nickkontos	that's it?
2010-01-27T05:22:00.000Z	MrUnix	nickkontos	what's the -w option supposed to be?
2010-01-27T05:24:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	i donno! :(
2010-01-27T05:24:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	 i found it here http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/debian-ubuntu-linux-configure-pinnacle-pctv-tuner.html
2010-01-27T05:24:00.000Z	MrUnix	nickkontos	your man page (see in your pastebin) doesn't list it as an option. Just remove it and try running the same command.
2010-01-27T05:26:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	well, cool! now i only get this "sox FAIL formats: no handler for given file type `ossdsp'"
2010-01-27T05:26:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	I had to remove both -w though
2010-01-27T05:27:00.000Z	MrUnix	nickkontos	what's the command you're running?
2010-01-27T05:27:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	sox -c 2 -s -r 32000 -t ossdsp /dev/dsp1 -t ossdsp -r 32000 /dev/dsp
2010-01-27T05:28:00.000Z	MrUnix	nickkontos	run the command and paste me the output
2010-01-27T05:29:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	the output is this --> sox FAIL formats: no handler for given file type `ossdsp'
2010-01-27T05:30:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	yeah, that's pretty it...
2010-01-27T05:30:00.000Z	MrUnix	nickkontos	every other command before this one on that page worked?
2010-01-27T05:31:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	well, yeah, it hasn't got anything important though
2010-01-27T05:32:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	I mean, I've done all these my self before and the outputs are the same as far as the tvcard's spec are conserned, except...
2010-01-27T05:34:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	http://paste.ubuntu.com/363551/
2010-01-27T05:45:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	It worked! i just had to install libsox-fmt-oss!
2010-01-27T05:47:00.000Z	nickkontos	MrUnix	so now when i run "sox -c 2 -s -r 32000 -t ossdsp /dev/dsp1 -t ossdsp -r 32000 /dev/dsp"  and then open another terminal and run  "sudo tvtime -d /dev/video1"  i can see tv and hear audio! Now, how can I avoid typing all these commands? can I save them somewhere so when i load tvtime they'll load automaticaly?
