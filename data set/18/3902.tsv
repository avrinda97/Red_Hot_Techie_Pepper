2009-08-28T01:23:00.000Z	llua		i have ubuntu xp and vista in a triple boot, i wanna remove vista, how do i go about that without messing things up?
2009-08-28T01:23:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	you can just destroy the whole partition and delete the entry from menu.lst
2009-08-28T01:24:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-08-28T01:28:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	type `blkid` into the terminal, and whichever partition is NTFS would be vista
2009-08-28T01:30:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	it should tell you which partition belongs to Vista
2009-08-28T01:30:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	then you can go on to delete that partition
2009-08-28T01:31:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	it shows a list with like /dev/blah UUID=asdkfa;lebaofibaoe right?
2009-08-28T01:31:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	just type blkid
2009-08-28T01:33:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	okay.. now you know /dev/sda5 belongs to vista, all you have to do is delete that partition
2009-08-28T01:33:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	i don't know if this'll work, but you can try `dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sda5
2009-08-28T01:34:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	nope.. you have to edit your menu.lst file to remove it from the boot menu
2009-08-28T01:34:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	`sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst` then scroll down to the windows entry and delete it
2009-08-28T01:35:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	you can delete it.... title VISta blah blah chainloader +1 and all that stuff right?
2009-08-28T01:38:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	yup, delete that... but what bothers me is that your menu.lst has the wrong partition .. it says /dev/sda1 while your blkid output says that Vista is on /dev/sda5... and it'd be horrible if i made you delete the wrong partition
2009-08-28T01:52:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	really? then there's no point in deleting the entry from menu.lst
2009-08-28T01:50:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	yup all you're doing is deleting the vista entry from your menu.lst, XP uses a different bootloader i believe.
2009-08-28T01:52:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	but deleting your vista partition could still be a good idea if you want more harddrive space..
2009-08-28T02:32:00.000Z	moymoy	llua	purplenurple_: wait.. how does deleting the vista partition mess up grub?
