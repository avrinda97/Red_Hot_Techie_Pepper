2010-01-06T11:08:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	and even then it fails at being quick, so he might as well use compiz
2010-02-17T23:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	theadmin sudo vi /etc/default/grub
2010-02-17T23:22:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	Meh, don't like complex editors as vi. nano and gedit are my favorites.
2010-02-17T23:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	vi isn't complex, but use whatever you are most comfortable with
2010-02-17T23:23:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	Okay, thanks
2010-03-05T11:58:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	security patches
2010-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	What IS "cups" anyway
2010-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	common unix printing services
2010-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	...I don't need that... lol
2010-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	then why do you have it?
2010-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	i use a minimal iso install and only install what i want. the default install is very bloated
2010-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	Maybe it came defaultly. I don't need empathy either, but i knew i don't need it at least
2010-03-05T12:00:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	Meh, default is a good enough for me
2010-03-05T12:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	ok, if you can deal with all the bloat and unneeded services and updates that you don't even know what they are
2010-03-05T12:01:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	If UBUNTU is bloated... lol, better don't even touch Linux Mint
2010-03-06T10:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	actually you can install os x on a "normal machine"
2010-03-27T10:12:00.000Z	blakkheim	theadmin	just use iptables
2010-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	theadmin	blakkheim	Hm, good point
