2006-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	pippijn		hi all
2006-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	pippijn		can I install ubuntu from a usb hdd?
2006-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	I think so.  I might even have directions on that around here somewhere.  One moment.
2006-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	would be great
2006-10-24T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	Okay, obviously the target machine will need to be able to boot from a usb device.  Now, what you'll need to do is "burn" the installation cd to that drive.  Theoretically the following works, although I haven't tried it yet:
2006-10-24T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	If your .iso image file is located in /foo and you have a mount
2006-10-24T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		point /mnt/bar, do this:
2006-10-24T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	sudo mount /foo/file.iso /mnt/bar -t iso9660 -o loop=/dev/loop1
2006-10-24T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	The extracted image is in /mnt/bar
2006-10-24T14:31:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	yeah, seems okay, but how do I start the setup?
2006-10-24T14:31:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	what is the setup program called?
2006-10-24T14:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	Should be able to just boot the device and away you go.  Same as the CD.
2006-10-24T14:32:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	you mean really burn it to the hdd?
2006-10-24T14:32:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	I doubt that works
2006-10-24T14:32:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	cdfs or rather iso9660 works completely different from any other fs
2006-10-24T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	pippijn	That's what someone told me.  Like I said, I haven't gotten around to testing it yet.
2006-10-24T14:33:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	they got some TOC that is in the first few circles
2006-10-24T14:33:00.000Z	pippijn	tonyyarusso	I'll try
