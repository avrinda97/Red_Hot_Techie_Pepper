2010-07-04T03:09:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I'm serioius
2010-07-04T03:10:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I'm not trolling I've been working on this for the entire day and it keeps hanging right after the BIOS splash screen
2010-07-04T03:10:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Black and with a flashing udnerscore
2010-07-04T03:11:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I have just restored the grub, it booted after showing me some unknown error code that flashed by and then I restarted to make sure all was well, and then it went right back to the blank screen
2010-07-04T03:12:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I don't know exactly what it said but it flashed by with a URL and said something about needing correct firmware?
2010-07-04T03:12:00.000Z	linuxnoob		yeah I can get into recovery
2010-07-04T03:13:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I went to recovery and its stuck at [    2.26.2377] ata4: DUMMY
2010-07-04T03:14:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I have a HP mini 110. I couldn't have possibly read all of what flashed on the screen it was up for a second or two and then went to the login
2010-07-04T03:15:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Bios update maybe?
2010-07-04T03:17:00.000Z	linuxnoob		:D Can't wait to get this running, I ditched Window 7 Starter because for pretty much any purpose it was completely useless.
2010-07-04T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	linuxnoob	ah yes indeed
2010-07-04T03:17:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I'll get back to you on that Pirate
2010-07-04T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	linuxnoob	starter editions of Windows three apps open at once and thats it, yeah?
2010-07-04T03:18:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I don't know what graphics drivers it would use, I assume it uses intel graphics accelerator if anything at all. Its got the Intel Atom
2010-07-04T03:20:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Clean install.
2010-07-04T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	linuxnoob	your on a netbook?  so did the netbook edition?
