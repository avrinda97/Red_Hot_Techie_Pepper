2008-09-09T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	`man rm` is safe.
2008-09-09T13:20:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	See I knew you would be the right man to ask :) you answer things straight forward & easily, thanks
2008-09-09T12:58:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	that is what I am using
2008-09-09T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	Read the wiki page, it explains a number of the commands
2008-09-09T12:59:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	 O alright thanks
2008-09-09T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	Why are you trying to clear everything out, by the way?
2008-09-09T13:03:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	because isn't it good to clean out your system every once in a while?
2008-09-09T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	I think you're confused about what caches accomplish.  Cleaning them is good, but generally not needed, and certainly not needed frequently enough to warrant the automation that you were suggesting
2008-09-09T13:20:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	gparted on a liveCD (includes the Desktop CD), since you can't fiddle with partitions when they're mounted.  And, for the record, a good number of people in this channel could've answered that.
2008-09-09T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	That's not really called for
2008-09-09T13:10:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	I agree it wasn't, he shouldn't
2008-09-09T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	holyguyver_	If you have an issue with the operators, take it up in #ubuntu-ops.  This channel is the wrong place for it.  Also, ops are just doing their jobs, you shouldn't make it personal.
2008-09-09T13:15:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	I agree I think all that is sayable has been said
2008-09-09T13:19:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Flannel	you seem to be an intellagent & reasonable man, so I will address my next question to you. What is the easist & safeest way to shrink & expand partisions including my system partision, or can you give me a link that tells me in lamen terms how to move my home folder onto a different partision?
