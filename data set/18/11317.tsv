2008-07-30T13:46:00.000Z	magneticubuntu		Any PPC Ubuntu users around?
2008-07-30T13:48:00.000Z	magneticubuntu		great i'm using a rare PPC box and have some questions about Hardy
2008-07-30T13:48:00.000Z	magneticubuntu		its a Pegasos 2 G4 @ 1ghz
2008-07-30T13:48:00.000Z	magneticubuntu		only Non Mac that can run Tiger
2008-07-30T13:49:00.000Z	magneticubuntu		http://pegasosppc.com/ if you are interested
2008-07-30T13:49:00.000Z	magneticubuntu		kind of cool
2008-07-30T13:49:00.000Z	Flannel	magneticubuntu	do you have a question?
2008-07-30T14:16:00.000Z	Flannel	magneticubuntu	Because for people who don't speak english as their first language, slang is difficult or impossible to understand
2008-07-30T14:17:00.000Z	magneticubuntu	Flannel	though a lot of irc channel goers who are intl tend to speak multiple languages
2008-07-30T14:28:00.000Z	magneticubuntu	Flannel	if you a distro upgrade can you use an older kernel to boot?
2008-07-30T14:28:00.000Z	Flannel	magneticubuntu	you mean upgrading from say, gutsy to hardy?
2008-07-30T14:28:00.000Z	magneticubuntu	Flannel	no Dapper to Hardy
2008-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	magneticubuntu	that'd be the same.  You... might be able to.  I wouldn't count on it though.
2008-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	magneticubuntu	the issue is they're definately compiled against different libc6s, and I'm sure the ABI has been broken during that time.
2008-07-30T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	magneticubuntu	But, it might work, I'm really just guessing
2008-07-30T14:30:00.000Z	magneticubuntu	Flannel	yeah i dont want to risk it but i need to sym-link the kernel becauase of my proprietary PPC box
2008-07-30T14:30:00.000Z	magneticubuntu	Flannel	well thanks i'll have to google it
