2008-04-21T20:49:00.000Z	drivetrax		look man, I booted up this morning.. and the username changed...
2008-04-21T20:49:00.000Z	drivetrax		which is not good
2008-04-21T20:50:00.000Z	drivetrax		i do not know what i did to change the user name
2008-04-21T20:50:00.000Z	drivetrax		but, I did try to change the name@hostname
2008-04-21T20:50:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	What did your username change in? Your login?
2008-04-21T20:51:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	you need to be more specific.
2008-04-21T20:51:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	So, type in whatever your normal login is.
2008-04-21T20:55:00.000Z	drivetrax	Pici	 I do not know the hostname of this machine on the ATT/bellsouth network the DSL is plugged into.
2008-04-21T20:56:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	For the most part, desktop computers' hostnames are inconsequential
2008-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	drivetrax	Pici	 - why does my workspace only show "desk 1"
2008-04-23T16:15:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	Perhaps you only have one workspace?
2008-04-23T16:15:00.000Z	drivetrax	Pici	 - if I click on it, it zooms to the other windows
2008-04-23T16:15:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	What is 'it'?
2008-04-23T16:16:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	Do you mean that it slides the desk to the left or right?
2008-04-23T16:16:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	Thats normal, if you want to customize that action, you can install compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	It sounds like compiz is enabled, have you asked the folks in #compiz-fusion about changing the configuration to enable the cube?
2008-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	drivetrax	Pici	 - I am looking for extra desktops, virtual space, not eye candy
2008-04-23T16:18:00.000Z	Pici	drivetrax	In the general tab of ccsm you can increase the number of virtual desktops... Horizontal size I believe it is called.
