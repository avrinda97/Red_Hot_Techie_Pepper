2007-06-09T16:46:00.000Z	gonzoism		or not
2007-06-09T16:46:00.000Z	gonzoism		?
2007-06-09T16:48:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	that script will install automatix2 !!!
2007-06-09T16:50:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	don't hand that script out, it may seriously damage ppls computers
2007-10-06T12:32:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	slackware is good for older boxes.  also mepis has antiX.  you might have to play with it to install on anything less than 64mb but i bet it would run fine.  it has X on it, even though it is called antiX.
2007-10-06T12:33:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	there is also www.linuxfromscratch.com   when i was on 32 mb with a 73mhz intel, linuxfromscratch ran great after i got it all installed.  and i learned a /whole lot/ about linux doing it.
2007-10-06T12:34:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	oh, great
2007-10-06T12:34:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	will take a lifetime to install all the apps i guess
2007-10-06T12:36:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	doing linuxfromscratch would take me about 2 weeks to get a complete system with everything i needed and the majority of the stuff fine tuned.
2007-10-06T12:36:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	but i was experienced and going through that stuff fast.
2007-10-06T12:36:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	gah
2007-10-06T12:36:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	  oh hey.  there is another way....
2007-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	gentoo
2007-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	gentoo would probably be the perfect one for it.
2007-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	but slack only requires 8mb i think.
2007-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	magnetron	gonzoism	yeah, but i need X
2007-10-06T12:39:00.000Z	gonzoism	magnetron	slackware has X  so does gentoo.
