2004-12-20T10:04:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		to show what they are workign on?
2004-12-20T10:05:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	thanks for bringing that up, Mark says "that's a really good point"
2004-12-20T10:05:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	what is?
2004-12-20T10:05:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	we do keep private logs, but hopefully we'll be turning those into public weblogs soonish
2004-12-20T10:05:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	:)
2004-12-20T10:05:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	thanks
2004-12-20T10:07:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	while i have you in here, is there any progress in plans for a kde release?
2004-12-20T10:10:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	we need community help for that
2004-12-20T10:11:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	in what ways?
2004-12-20T10:13:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	Canonical only have the resources to deal with one desktop environment, but if people want a KDE version of Ubuntu - and they do - we'd welcome it, and we have tools in progress that will help out people who want to create derivatives
2004-12-20T10:13:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	ohhh, i got it.... how did Canonical chose gnome over kde?
2004-12-20T10:14:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	well, we employ the GNOME release manager ... :-) I think it was originally because their release process was a good fit for what we wanted too
2004-12-20T10:14:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	makes sense :)
2004-12-20T11:59:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	are you at canonical right now or the conference?
2004-12-20T12:07:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	"at Canonical" doesn't have a meaning :-)
2004-12-20T12:07:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	we don't have offices
2004-12-20T12:08:00.000Z	Kamion	|QuaD-_	(well, we do if you count Mark's house) - I'm at the conference
2004-12-20T12:11:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Kamion	oh i didn't realize :)
