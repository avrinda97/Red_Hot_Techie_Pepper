2007-12-10T10:05:00.000Z	astro76	narothepharoh	I can login too actually, seems to be working
2008-01-19T13:04:00.000Z	astro76	narothepharoh	yes assuming you've done 'chmod +x armyops250linux.run' first
2008-01-19T13:06:00.000Z	astro76	narothepharoh	then the file isn't in the current directory, specify proper path or cd first
