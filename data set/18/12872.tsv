2006-07-02T16:54:00.000Z	akcom		I was attempting to install Ubuntu after having already installed windows so I could dual boot.  I think when I installed Ubuntu I accidentally put GRUB on the MBR because it refuses to work.  Is there anyway to correct this?
2006-07-02T16:54:00.000Z	akcom		When I attempt to boot, GRUB dies at step 1.5
2006-07-02T16:55:00.000Z	akcom		haha, fair enough
2006-07-02T16:55:00.000Z	akcom		I'm running from the live cd right now
2006-07-02T16:56:00.000Z	akcom		I'm not reinstalling...
2006-07-02T16:56:00.000Z	akcom		I doubt that's necessary.
2006-07-02T16:57:00.000Z	akcom		how would I get the HD installed version to run if I can't even get GRUB working?
2006-07-02T16:57:00.000Z	akcom		It's a superb language
2006-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	akcom		I can't see myself going back to C++ after D

2006-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	akcom	penguin42	I don't see how that's relevant
2006-07-02T16:59:00.000Z	penguin42	akcom	If the partition grub installs its stage 1.5/2 on is somewhere the BIOS can't find then things break wonderfully
2006-07-02T16:59:00.000Z	akcom	penguin42	the box is no older than 3 years, the hd is 200gb, split evenly into 98 for windows and 98 for xfs + swap
2006-07-02T05:00:00.000Z	penguin42	akcom	Hmm OK, not too unreasonable - you using xfs as your root file system?
2006-07-02T05:00:00.000Z	akcom	penguin42	yes, I will be once I fix my install
2006-07-02T05:01:00.000Z	penguin42	akcom	That's a little unusual - its the only unusual thing I can see; make a /boot partition, and make that something more common, ext3 say
2006-07-02T05:01:00.000Z	penguin42	akcom	Bonus points if you put the /boot nearer the start of the disc
2006-07-02T05:02:00.000Z	penguin42	akcom	In principal I don't think it should - but I've had bad look with xfs and it is the only unusual thing I can see in your install
