2008-12-06T22:57:00.000Z	guest6294		anyone here using wicd on ubuntu 8.10? and possibly even wpa2?
2008-12-06T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	have you installed wpasupplicant
2008-12-06T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	and configured it
2008-12-06T22:58:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	the wpasupplicant is installed by default, the trouble is, whenever I boot the laptop I CAN connect to my WPA2 network, however when I disconnect from the network and try to login again, it does not work
2008-12-06T22:59:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	so I can only log into my network once, after I boot the computer, when I disconnect and let's say I want to reconnect, it does not work anymore
2008-12-06T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	its optional so is not installed by default
2008-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	im unsure as i dont use wpa, too much faff
2008-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	I swear to god that on my alternate install disk wpasupplicant is installed by default!!!
2008-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	what do you use for security though?
2008-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	well im going by the official info bot
2008-12-06T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	hidden and obscure ssid, disable dhcp, mac filtering, subnet only permits 3 systems to connect using a weird ip address range
2008-12-06T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	and wep
2008-12-06T23:02:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	I use the same stuff, wep is strong than wap2?
2008-12-06T23:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	no, wpa2 is stronger
2008-12-06T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	but unless you know my network inside out you wont get in basically
2008-12-06T23:05:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	got the point, since it succesfully connects the first time only, I guess the wicd messes with some config file, and after reboot, it is reseted to the config file that works, other explanation I could found not
2008-12-06T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	guest6294	try sudo /etc/init.d/network restart then connect
2008-12-06T23:12:00.000Z	guest6294	ActionParsnip	nope, it does not work :(
