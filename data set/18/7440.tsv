2009-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	frostburn		what's a text editor that can open up text files over a few hundred megabytes, gedit and jedit both choke at the task
2009-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	vi
2009-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	frostburn		vi chokes too
2009-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	frostburn		vim as well
2009-09-08T19:39:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	when editing with vi, /var/tmp needs to be about twice the size of the file you are working with.
2009-09-08T19:42:00.000Z	frostburn	winky	it's fairly sizable, but whenever it gets to a long hex string, vi takes up 100%cpu on my dualcore and just spins... =|
2009-09-08T19:45:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	what type of file is this?  Do you need to perform alot of editing or just make a single change etc ?  maybe thinking of running it through sed or something ?
2009-09-08T19:46:00.000Z	frostburn		Winkie, it's a database dump, any stream programs work fine, more/less/sed it's just cumbersome to use, i may create a new file by grepping out the hexbinary

2009-09-08T19:55:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	is the file on your local filesystem?
2009-09-08T19:55:00.000Z	frostburn	winky	yes
2009-09-08T19:56:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	how big is the file?
2009-09-08T19:57:00.000Z	frostburn	winky	111mb
2009-09-08T19:57:00.000Z	winky		:q
2009-09-08T19:57:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	open vi and type :set directory
2009-09-08T19:58:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	that will show where the temporary location is
2009-09-08T19:58:00.000Z	frostburn	winky	hmm, i could just use a ramfs for editing this
2009-09-08T19:58:00.000Z	winky	frostburn	yea 111mb, it should laugh at that, i was thinking it was gigabytes.
