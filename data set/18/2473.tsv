2010-05-07T19:42:00.000Z	fax		I installed ubuntu from the CD onto my computers but I can't boot into it (It just gives a black screen and nothing happens) - any ideas what to do
2010-05-07T19:42:00.000Z	fax		?
2010-05-07T19:44:00.000Z	fax		yes
2010-05-07T19:45:00.000Z	boxenlude	fax	can you se the grub boot menu?
2010-05-07T19:45:00.000Z	fax		it's got the correct md5
2010-05-07T19:46:00.000Z	fax		so maybe I have to edit some of these options
2010-05-07T19:46:00.000Z	boxenlude		fax : yes, you could try acpi=ogg, for example
2010-05-07T19:46:00.000Z	boxenlude		sorry, acpi=off
2010-05-07T19:46:00.000Z	fax		no I don't get grub
2010-05-07T19:47:00.000Z	boxenlude	fax	what do you see? anything?
2010-05-07T19:47:00.000Z	fax		no it's just a black screen
2010-05-07T19:47:00.000Z	fax		it's odd because try ubuntu on the install CD worked
2010-05-07T19:49:00.000Z	boxenlude		fax : dou you ahve another system installed? Windows or another Linux?
2010-05-07T19:49:00.000Z	fax		mac os
