2012-04-17T19:02:00.000Z	intelligentfool		hello all, newb here, trying to setup phpmyadmin on my ubuntu 11.04 server and keep getting 404 errors. I've added the include to my apache.conf file but still no luck. can anyone help me out?
2012-04-17T19:03:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	all you need to do is make a symlink from /etc/apache2/conf.d/ to point at /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf and then reload apache.
2012-04-17T19:03:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	i've already done that as well
2012-04-17T19:06:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	any other suggestions? :(
2012-04-17T19:07:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	what url are you trying to load it with? (feel free to obsfucate the domain if its publically facing)
2012-04-17T19:08:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	it should.
2012-04-17T19:08:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	are there any errors in /var/log/apache2/ ?
2012-04-17T19:14:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	"ls -ll /etc/apache2/conf.d/" shows "phpmyadmin.conf -> ../../phpmyadmin/apache.conf", is that not right?
2012-04-17T19:14:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	thats right.  And the www-data user can read the file?
2012-04-17T19:15:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	stupid questionâ€¦. how do i check? :)
2012-04-17T19:15:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	Just paste the full output of ls -ll for that file.
2012-04-17T19:17:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	you mean from where the symlink is or the actual real file?
2012-04-17T19:18:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	the actual file, not the symlink. sure you can.
2012-04-17T19:19:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	Its in /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
2012-04-17T19:20:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	i get this - http://pastebin.com/qXdsTJE3
2012-04-17T19:21:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	thats fine, and the permissions look fine too.
2012-04-17T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	intelligentfool	You installed phpmyadmin from the package repositories, right?
2012-04-17T19:26:00.000Z	intelligentfool	Pici	you've been a great help so far and i've got to run but any other things i should be checking?
