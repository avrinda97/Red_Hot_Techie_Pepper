2010-05-07T07:24:00.000Z	sassinoogi		Anyone know how to load an ipod from Ubuntu?  I know you need to change the format of the songs to a .wma file, but when I go to load the song onto it, they never show...any ideas?
2010-05-07T07:25:00.000Z	aeron	sassinoogi	the ipod cant play wma, try converting to mp3 first
2010-05-07T07:25:00.000Z	sassinoogi		OH--thanks!  mp3, huh?
2010-05-07T07:25:00.000Z	aeron		yes, i believe the ipod supports mp3 and aac
2010-05-07T07:30:00.000Z	sassinoogi		Aeron: When I used the "sound converter", it says that source files cannot be converted--is there another way to switch the files from .ogg to mp3?
2010-05-07T07:30:00.000Z	aeron	sassinoogi	are the files currently in .wma? you might need to download a codec before you can convert them
2010-05-07T07:30:00.000Z	sassinoogi		no
2010-05-07T07:31:00.000Z	sassinoogi		I just downloaded sound converter to try to remedy this
2010-05-07T07:31:00.000Z	aeron	sassinoogi	what format is your music in right now?
2010-05-07T07:32:00.000Z	sassinoogi		off
2010-05-07T07:32:00.000Z	sassinoogi		oops!!  .ogg
2010-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	aeron	sassinoogi	try running "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras" without the quotes and try sound converter again
2010-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	sassinoogi	aeron	so, what "patch" am I downloading this time [to convert to ogg]
2010-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	sassinoogi		ok
2010-05-07T07:35:00.000Z	sassinoogi	aeron	now what...should this do it?
2010-05-07T07:36:00.000Z	aeron	sassinoogi	try converting the files to mp3 now. they should play on the ipod now
2010-05-07T07:37:00.000Z	sassinoogi	aeron	THANKS!!:-D
