2010-09-02T00:48:00.000Z	slops17		hey i am trying to set up vnc4server onmy ubuntu 10.4 box and have folled all the instructions i can find to comment out lines in .vnc/xstartup and i keep getting a grey screen
2010-09-02T00:49:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	At a minimum, you need to call gnome-session in the vnc startup script so that the desktop environment ships.  The empy gray screen is the default X11 window.
2010-09-02T00:52:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	You cut-and-pasted from a not-Ubuntu tutorial.   You need to change this script to do it The Ubuntu Way.  Mostly, replace everything with `gnome-session` and see if you get any further.
2010-09-02T00:53:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	it works on 9.10 just not 10.4
2010-09-02T01:04:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	do you have a tut i should follow
2010-09-02T01:05:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	Did you try what I suggested?
2010-09-02T01:06:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	yes and still get the same result
2010-09-02T01:07:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	Look in /usr/share/doc for the sample configuration file.  Start from scratch.
2010-09-02T01:08:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	Double check that you have the ubuntu-desktop meta package installed.  VNC needs everything that a regular desktop uses.
2010-09-02T01:09:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	it needs some packages
2010-09-02T01:10:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	i had removed openoffice
2010-09-02T01:16:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	that didnt fix it maybe i need to reboot
2010-09-02T01:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	No, if OpenOffice was the only thing missing, then you have another problem.
2010-09-02T01:17:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	i just rebooted ill test it when it comes back up
2010-09-02T01:18:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	yeah that didnt fix it
2010-09-02T01:19:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	If the sample configuration file doesn't work, then you should check your system for sanity.  Try VNC through System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop.
2010-09-02T01:20:00.000Z	slops17	dajhorn	right now the box is headless so i can only get to it via ssh
2010-09-02T01:21:00.000Z	dajhorn	slops17	Doesn't matter.  Shell into the computer with `ssh -X` and run `vino-preferences`.
