2009-09-24T04:01:00.000Z	Blankman		What is the SIMPLEST way to format a drive?  I want to wipe 100% of the usable drive.  I don't need it to be super secure, I just want to wipe and start over.
2009-09-24T04:01:00.000Z	Blankman		I want to load up ubuntu with xfce... if that matters
2009-09-24T04:02:00.000Z	Blankman		Anyone use dban?  I need to wipe my drive so I can install ubuntu
2009-09-24T04:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	What's the issue?
2009-09-24T04:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	What's the matter with Gparted?
2009-09-24T04:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	When your on the Live CD?
2009-09-24T04:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	Ok so there are currently partitions on it?
2009-09-24T04:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	 Windows partitions or?
2009-09-24T04:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	and you want to get rid of all of these partitions?
2009-09-24T04:10:00.000Z	Blankman	sebsebseb	yes, i want to wipe 100% of the drive.  I don't need to over write the drive 5 times or anything, I just want to start fresh.   with 100% of the drive.
2009-09-24T04:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	maybe booting up the Live CD again will help
2009-09-24T04:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	also there's a Gparted Live CD
2009-09-24T04:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	np
2009-09-24T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	good luck
2009-09-24T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	How much RAM do you have?
2009-09-24T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	4GB  SWAP I think then
2009-09-24T04:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	some say  SWAP is only really needed for hibernation these days,  as long as got like 1GB or more RAM,    others say still needed even with 4GB RAM,  basicalley
2009-09-24T04:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Blankman	if you got a big enough USB stick you can also run a persistent install from that
