2008-04-08T18:31:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	you would require root access but you need to know lots before doing such things. I messed up a system by using GUI apps as root and did fall into inextricable problems.
2008-04-08T18:35:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	i thought its okay and i dont know the reasons why. I thought because synaptic uses root privileges and works, other apps should work too. But it doesnt. After reboot i had no internet access, xsession did not start up and grub configuration was overwritten by default values.
2008-04-08T18:36:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	you indeed had some serious problem in there....oh lol....
2008-04-08T18:36:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	so its completely messed up and fresh installing the entire system would be the easiest to repair
2008-04-08T18:39:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	yes, it is really remarkable how much has been done inside that short time since ubuntu is in wider use. I have used mandrake since 1999 and am impressed from ubuntu as well
2008-04-08T18:40:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	how the new version coming along....has it been alot of corrections?
2008-04-08T18:45:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	i have installed ubuntu 7.10 on my 600E thinkpad and on a compaq evo. As on all distributions sound did not work on my laptop (while with windows it does). I only get these beep beep beep sounds out of it. Power management is still an issue. Else, nearby everything worked very well.
2008-04-08T18:48:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	I especially wonder because of the sound. i wonder why this is still that complicated. It is a nearby 10 year old laptop and a very popular one too. And still unresolved issues.
2008-04-08T18:49:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	you will be alright.....
2008-04-08T18:50:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	but like i already mentioned, its on all distributions. Therewith not ubuntu specific i would say.
2008-04-08T18:54:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	it's okay....I am being forced to learn linux...for a software I have use and learn....but first Ubuntu for the next 3 months.....
2008-04-08T18:58:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	would be interesting to hear which app it is that inspired you to join the ubuntu community :)
2008-04-08T19:00:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	is open software for telephony to go around the world....
2008-04-08T19:01:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	: using servers established allover..
2008-04-08T19:03:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	i am using wengophone to connect my mobile with the computer. It was astonishingly easy to set up. It detected my phone automatically and knew how to communicate without any separate software from the manufacturer itself :)
2008-04-08T19:03:00.000Z	andax	Nasra	else i havent done anything related with phones
2008-04-08T19:04:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	: there is an open source telephony software called: Asterisk that is what I am interested about to learn.....
2008-04-08T19:05:00.000Z	Nasra	andax	is called future of telephony by O'reilly...is amazing very powerful
