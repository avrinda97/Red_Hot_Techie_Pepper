Have a 2ndary drive in a 2ndary machine that i want to serve to my main destop and the wifes laptop. it always askes me to either login from the windows machine or won't allow entry to the dir from the windows machine.
2007-05-04T11:43:00.000Z	chip		[00:24:25]  <chip> even tho it's kde, i'm not afraid of cli action
2007-05-04T11:45:00.000Z	chip		before, they're 777. after, it's . . .
2007-05-04T11:45:00.000Z	z0x1c	chip	is your username and password the same under Samba and Windows?
2007-05-04T11:50:00.000Z	z0x1c	chip	have you checked /var/log/samba/log.smbd immediately following a failed login attempt?
2007-05-04T11:51:00.000Z	chip	z0x1c	i'll do that right now.
2007-05-04T11:55:00.000Z	chip	z0x1c	the last entry is the last time i restarted samba
2007-05-04T11:55:00.000Z	z0x1c	chip	strange... so, to be sure, it prompts you for a password but then never lets you in? what error message does Windows give you?
2007-05-04T11:55:00.000Z	chip	z0x1c	windows doesn't prompt.
2007-05-04T11:56:00.000Z	z0x1c	chip	what error message do you receive? also, try accessing via IP address - \\192.168.whatever
2007-05-04T12:49:00.000Z	z0x1c	chip	have you tried accessing via IP address \\192.168.whatever? I find it strange that log.smbd is empty.
