2012-01-30T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	sudo kill -9 12828
2012-01-30T22:42:00.000Z	Guest15276	ActionParsnip	Chromium works for most everything, except sites using http auth (like our internal site)
2012-01-30T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	use some real force
2012-01-30T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	never had an issues
2012-01-30T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	yes, will kill any users processes
2012-01-30T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	it's also the parent of plugin containier, so that should die too
2012-01-30T22:44:00.000Z	Guest15276	ActionParsnip	tried killing 12922 nothing
2012-01-30T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	then try:  sudo kill -9 12922    then rerun:  ps -ef | grep -i fire   fo make sure that has gone
2012-01-30T22:46:00.000Z	Guest15276	ActionParsnip	plugin is gone, still can't kill 12828
2012-01-30T22:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest15276	I can't think of a bigger hammer than -9
