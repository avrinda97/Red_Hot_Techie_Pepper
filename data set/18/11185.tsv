2006-11-06T11:09:00.000Z	Skyrail		oh...I wish people didn't make flash for the newest of the new, there are still thousands without the newest versions :(

2006-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	Skyrail	Agrajag	ok :D wait a minute sorry I think I may have foiund an answer
2006-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	Agrajag	Skyrail	ok
2006-11-06T11:56:00.000Z	Skyrail	Agrajag	actually maybe not, do you use flash 9?
2006-11-06T11:56:00.000Z	Agrajag	Skyrail	yes
2006-11-06T11:57:00.000Z	Skyrail	Agrajag	do you have any audio problems?
2006-11-06T11:57:00.000Z	Agrajag	Skyrail	nope
2006-11-06T11:58:00.000Z	Skyrail	Agrajag	hmm ok, its just that when I open something that requires flash its ok for about 30 seconds or so and then the audio just crashes and repeats the same little bit over and over again...
2006-11-06T11:59:00.000Z	Agrajag	Skyrail	don't know what to tell you, flash is still beta, could be a bug in that, or your sound drivers
2006-11-06T12:00:00.000Z	Skyrail	Agrajag	hmm, ok thats the problem, its still in beta...well I'll have to wait until it drops out of beta, any idea how long that will be?
2006-11-06T12:01:00.000Z	Agrajag	Skyrail	no clue, don't know if that's where your problem lies either. Anyway, meeting time.
2006-11-06T12:02:00.000Z	Skyrail	Agrajag	er ok
