2007-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	evan_		screen refresh rate is being set incorrectly to 50Hz, should be 60 Hz, I've already tried changing it in graphical properties and Xorg, not sure what to do
2007-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	pastebin your xorg.conf and your xorg logs
2007-12-19T09:16:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	also, is your monitor a LCD screen?
2007-12-19T09:16:00.000Z	evan_		yea, its a quadro.  I was also wondering if the quadro can be used to do double buffering of windows and such
2007-12-19T09:16:00.000Z	evan_		yes, a laptop screen
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	then 50Hz is normal and you cannot change it nor you'd want to
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	evan_	wols_	Iim not sure what "pastebin" is
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	evan_		no, 60 Hz is normal
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	no need anymore. you cannot go above 50Hz on a LCD
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	LCDs have one exact refresh rate and that's it. usually 50 or 60Hz
2007-12-19T09:18:00.000Z	evan_		all computer lcds afaik have 60 hz refresh rates
2007-12-19T09:18:00.000Z	evan_		thats what it is in windows too
2007-12-19T09:18:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	not everyhwhere. and I told you, you cannot set any refresh rate with LCDs. just not possible due to the way their work
2007-12-19T09:18:00.000Z	wols_	evan_	what windosw tells you and what it uses are possibly different things.
2007-12-19T09:19:00.000Z	evan_	wols_	ok, I guess i should be happy its even working, buy I know full well about refresh rates on both lcds and crts
2007-12-19T09:20:00.000Z	evan_		wols_:thanks though, sounds like I shouldn't mess with it
2007-12-19T09:20:00.000Z	evan_		or cant, even
