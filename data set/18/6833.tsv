2012-09-09T14:40:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		Can anyone tell me if apt-get remove/install is a working way of downgrading php, apache and mysql?
2012-09-09T14:41:00.000Z	jrib	PeterGriffin	why?  What exactly do you need to downgrade to and why?
2012-09-09T14:42:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		this is what http://openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/HP
2012-09-09T14:43:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		and because i have an application, sugarCRM, an archivet database for an older version, and need to install it
2012-09-09T14:43:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		no no
2012-09-09T14:43:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	jrib	the link is wrong, sorry
2012-09-09T14:44:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1194388/
2012-09-09T14:46:00.000Z	jrib	PeterGriffin	well where do you plan on getting those earlier versions?
2012-09-09T14:46:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		I havent planned this one yet
2012-09-09T14:46:00.000Z	jrib	PeterGriffin	you should do that
2012-09-09T14:46:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		it wont happen from apt-get, will it?
2012-09-09T14:47:00.000Z	jrib	PeterGriffin	ideally you would ask sugar crm to support the versions in ubuntu 12.04 by default.  No, you won't find the earlier versions in your pastebin in the 12.04 repositories
2012-09-09T14:50:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	jrib	I have started to install the new version of sugar, but I realised that the base is for the older version, and the compatibility requirements say that I need these earlier versions for the earlier version of sugarcrm.
2012-09-09T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	PeterGriffin	you're on your own as far as getting those earlier versions.  You're likely going to have to compile them yourself (or maybe you can find some debs and then force apt to ignre upgrades to them). In any case, make sure those old versions don't have any security vulnerabilities.  And if they do, patch them.  Again, I strongly recommend you tell sugar crm they should be supporting the versions in
2012-09-09T14:55:00.000Z	jrib		12.04.  Those are not bleeding edge versions.  12.04 has been around for 5 months
2012-09-09T14:58:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	jrib	So do you think that removing newer and compiling older should work?
2012-09-09T14:58:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		despite of the security issues
2012-09-09T14:59:00.000Z	jrib	PeterGriffin	sure.  Just don't ignore the security issues.
