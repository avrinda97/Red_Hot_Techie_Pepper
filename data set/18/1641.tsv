2011-01-02T07:14:00.000Z	Whitehat		Hello. I'm new to irc, And I was wondering where I might find technical type help.

2011-01-02T07:15:00.000Z	Whitehat		sorry
2011-01-02T07:15:00.000Z	Whitehat		oh ok
2011-01-02T07:16:00.000Z	Whitehat		is there a way to move a linux installation to a different harddrive?
2011-01-02T07:16:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	yep.  Using gparted
2011-01-02T07:18:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	use gparted, install grub on the target hdd, you're done
2011-01-02T07:20:00.000Z	Whitehat	edbian	What I have is a linux installation on a partition on sdb and I want it moved to a partition on sda
2011-01-02T07:21:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	great, launch gparted.  It should be pretty obvious how to copy
2011-01-02T07:21:00.000Z	Whitehat	edbian	ok thats easy enough.
2011-01-02T07:22:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	the only hard part is installing grub.  but you can just google that
2011-01-02T07:23:00.000Z	Whitehat	edbian	Ok, thanks for your help. And how do You like reply to my posts?
2011-01-02T07:23:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	You're doing it to me.  You just start with my name.
2011-01-02T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	The IRC client actually highlights it.  There is no set rule, it's more like standard practice.
2011-01-02T07:24:00.000Z	Whitehat	edbian	oh lol thanks
2011-01-02T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	sure
2011-01-02T07:30:00.000Z	Whitehat	edbian	I just remembered I had tried doing this before and Already have everything transferred to sda. What I was having trouble with is getting grub2 to install on sda and look for its files on the sda partition.
2011-01-02T07:31:00.000Z	edbian	Whitehat	That's the hard part!
