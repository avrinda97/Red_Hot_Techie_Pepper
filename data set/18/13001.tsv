2006-08-20T09:48:00.000Z	BlueEagle		mrparanoia: that is strange. :/
2006-08-20T09:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle		mrparanoia: Which mag did you get the image off?
2006-08-20T09:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle		mrparanoia: ok.
2006-08-20T09:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle		Anyways I'm off.
2006-08-20T09:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle		You all have a good one.
2006-08-20T07:59:00.000Z	BlueEagle		tle: I packed a car when two friends moved a couple of weeks ago.
2006-08-20T08:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle		tle: I've also sendt a great deal of stuff in the mail.
2006-08-20T08:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle		oobermick: There are typing tutors availible that might improve your speed. :)
2006-08-20T08:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ouch
2006-08-20T08:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ubuntubantu: ntfs is write enabled? o.O
2006-08-20T08:02:00.000Z	TLE	BlueEagle	Sorry I wasn't being specific enough. What I meant was does anybody have any experience packaging software into .deb's ?
2006-08-20T08:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ubotu	tell tle about anyone
2006-08-20T08:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ubuntubantu: and nothing in /etc/fstab about sde1?
2006-08-20T08:05:00.000Z	TLE	BlueEagle	What? was I being grammatically incorrect or did I do something which is not allowed ?
2006-08-20T08:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ubuntubantu: open a terminal and cd /etc/ then run rgrep sde1 *
2006-08-20T08:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ubuntubantu: You will get a couple of access denied I guess but look for anything other than that.
2006-08-20T08:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle		tle: It's better to ask the question about what the problem is, not if anyone has got any experience with a general procedure. For example if you're getting any error messages then that's often useful to include. If you're just looking for a tutorial then ask for a tutorial on the subject.
2006-08-20T08:07:00.000Z	TLE	BlueEagle	Ok ok, got it. I'm new to this irc client, so I hadn't seen the new message
