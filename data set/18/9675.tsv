2007-03-09T09:15:00.000Z	VII		hm, I have a hdd with mp3s on, its not my windows drive, how do I access it?
2007-03-09T09:15:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	what filesystem
2007-03-09T09:16:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	the easy (one time) way is to create a directory called /media/mp3s and then use sudo mount /dev/<your hdd> /media/mp3
2007-03-09T09:18:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	How can I find out what drive that is?
2007-03-09T09:25:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	ah...that's cause you don't have permissions for /media.  just type sudo mkdir /media/mp3s (or whatever you want to call it) into a terminal
2007-03-09T09:29:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	if it's empty, just use sudo rmdir <file name>  if it's not empty, then use sudo rm -R (but do this only if you want to get rid of everyting in it)
2007-03-09T09:35:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	sudo mount /dev/<drive name> /media/mp3s (or whatever you called it)
2007-03-09T09:39:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	actually, I see the filesystem is HPFS/NTFS if that matters
2007-03-09T09:40:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	no error while mounting it, just when trying to take a look in the folder
2007-03-09T09:41:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	the command I used was: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /share
2007-03-09T09:43:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	yes please =)
2007-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	when you're done, close your file browser with the mp3s and unmount them by typing "sudo unmount /share" and then type "sudo mount -a" in the terminal
2007-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	I will still beable to reach it from windows right?
2007-03-09T09:50:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	when I tried to unmount it said: "sudo: unmount: command not found"
2007-03-09T09:50:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	sorry umount not unmount
2007-03-09T09:51:00.000Z	VII	carlosqueso	woho! works like a charm. next question, and hopefully the last...... :D How do I play mp3s?
2007-03-09T09:52:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/MP3 can help...it's for dapper, but should work on edgy too
2007-03-09T10:30:00.000Z	carlosqueso	VII	file-roller will do it...you should be able to just double-click on them
