2011-04-20T06:01:00.000Z	aaron_wayne		ok, i have a network, is there a way to increase the speed of a download, or to dedicate a certain amount of bandwidth to a download?
2011-04-20T06:02:00.000Z	aaron_wayne		network question*
2011-04-20T06:02:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	priority for that type of thing is sometimes done in your router.. for large legal downloads sometimes torrents help alot
2011-04-20T06:04:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	well, i am trying to download frostwire, and normally my rate is up around 700-800kb or so, i am pulling excellent speed on the downside right now, 6m, but trying to download that my rate is like under 10k, i dont know whats up, its taking for ever to download a 6.3mb file
2011-04-20T06:05:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	has to do with the servers you're connected to.. why frostwire? you have a torrent app built in that's pretty good
2011-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	not very familiar with it, do u recommend what comes installed or is there a better one out there?
2011-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	you on unity?
2011-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	nope maverick, but still running gnome
2011-04-20T06:07:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	transmission is the default torrent program that's installed.. I've never really had an issue with it.
2011-04-20T06:08:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	k, i will check that out, any other idea with the download issue, while that is my current problem, i have run into it before and never really understood why i have a 6m downstream but cant actually download at that, you say it should be setting in router?
2011-04-20T06:09:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	you could be choked by your isp.. lots of them don't like torrents
2011-04-20T06:10:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	well, this isnt a torrent, just a regular old download through a browser
2011-04-20T06:10:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	then it's server related.. maybe someone else on your LAN is playing xbox, streaming video,music etc ??
2011-04-20T06:11:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	nah, cant be that, no one else on here but me, and i ran speedtest, shouldnt be any traffic issues, stats look real good, low ping times and pullin about 6m down
2011-04-20T06:12:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	then it has to be the server you're connected to for the download..
2011-04-20T06:13:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	k, thats cool, i have one more question for you if you dont mind
2011-04-20T06:14:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	izinucs	actually, nevermind, i appreciate the help, i can probably find some info for this, thanks :)
2011-04-20T06:16:00.000Z	izinucs	aaron_wayne	yep..np
