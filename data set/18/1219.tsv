2011-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	velociostrich		I'm having trouble getting gnome-settings-daemon to work in my FVWM session since I went and screwed around with some packages in synaptic. Gnome-settings-daemon is still installed, but when I try to run it, it says "The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files"
2011-12-05T01:38:00.000Z	velociostrich		I don't know jack about dbus or how to fix this
2011-12-05T01:38:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	sounds like gnome-session is not installed/not running
2011-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	That's all I could make of it, and I installed gnome-session and even rebooted but to no avail
2011-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	you are in a weird position. you are trying to run dbus, gnome-session, but you want fvwm as your WM
2011-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	I'm not trying to run gnome-session, just gnome-settings-daemon. I have done this successfully on the latest Ubuntu and for years prior. I don't know what I did in installing/removing packages, but I can't get gnome-settings-daemon to work.
2011-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	what version of ubuntu are you running
2011-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	11.10
2011-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	It worked up until I made those changes. I was attempting to remove some superfluous (mainly unity-related) packages. Do you know of a package list for a clean install that perhaps I could compare mine to?
2011-12-05T01:43:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	there is a change with the gnome settings. the backend is switched to dconf from gconf, and there is this gsettings utility which is new
2011-12-05T01:44:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	the package list for a clean install is ubuntu-desktop. what unity stuff were you removing?
2011-12-05T01:44:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	Plenty, like the overlay scrollbars, unity2d, unity related libraries, etc., which tries to install gnome-shell, which I avoided somehow. I thought I had removed most of the cruft before but there were a few packages that I then tried to remove. That was perhaps two hours ago, and since then I've been having trouble getting thins to work again.
2011-12-05T01:45:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	I did accidentally remove the lightdm greeter package not realizing what it was and had some difficulty reinstalling it (but it works now)
2011-12-05T01:46:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	im not sure what to tell you. you obviously broke something. unless your hard drive is running out of space what exactly is the problem with having stuff installed if you dont use it. and the correct way to disable those scrollbars is to use an environment variable
2011-12-05T01:47:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	I was unaware of the environment variable, and yes, disk space is a bit of an issue. (I don't need to be told how cheap HD's are these days, though). I don't know a thing about dbus, or I wouldn't be asking
2011-12-05T01:48:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	I can't find any real information on D-Bus besides high level talk. I don't know how its configured or anything
2011-12-05T01:49:00.000Z	escott	velociostrich	the complexity in dbus is in the interaction between applications, not dbus itself. so understanding it means understanding all the interactions between all the applications
2011-12-05T01:50:00.000Z	velociostrich	escott	Well, I don't understand why gnome-settings-daemon would report that gnome-session "was not provided by any .service files". I don't know what those .service files are or where they might be, but I do know that I have gnome-session-bin installed. I don't know if perhaps I need that daemon running as well; I don't know what those .service files provide
