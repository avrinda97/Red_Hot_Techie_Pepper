2012-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	it depends of your video card
2012-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	chronos		Nvidia GTX 360M
2012-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	chronos	joseluis64	I already have proprietary drive,
2012-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	chronos		but splash and terminals are at very lower resolution
2012-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	chronos		and I can't set wide resolution
2012-04-29T23:45:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	it is normal, the propietary drivers have this problem with plymouth
2012-04-29T23:45:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	but yu can fix it
2012-04-29T23:45:00.000Z	chronos	joseluis64	what I found to try is scripts from 2010..
2012-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	chronos	joseluis64	no very confident
2012-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	it doesn't matter
2012-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	joseluis64		well, at least with Ubuntu 11.10
2012-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	chronos		and hwinfo don't show widescreen resolutions
2012-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	chronos		so teorically it will not work..?
2012-04-29T23:47:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	if hwinfo does not show widescreen resolutions, then is not posible to make plymouth run in widescreen with propietary drivers
2012-04-29T23:47:00.000Z	chronos		hm, and can make plymouth use nouveau while x use nvidia?
2012-04-29T23:48:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	I don't know if that is possible
2012-04-29T23:48:00.000Z	chronos		thx joseluis64
2012-04-29T23:48:00.000Z	joseluis64	chronos	you're welcome
