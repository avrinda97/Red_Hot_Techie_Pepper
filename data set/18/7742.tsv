2008-04-21T21:04:00.000Z	wild_oscar		greetings!
2008-04-21T21:05:00.000Z	wild_oscar		I have a problem in my 7.10 - my xorg randomly just restarts
2008-04-21T21:05:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	it may be segfaulting
2008-04-21T21:05:00.000Z	wild_oscar	dav7	how can I backtrace it?
2008-04-21T21:05:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-04-21T21:05:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	(probably)
2008-04-21T21:06:00.000Z	wild_oscar	dav7	I looked at it, but can't seem to find any error
2008-04-21T21:06:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	:/
2008-04-21T21:07:00.000Z	wild_oscar	dav7	well, I have something at .old
2008-04-21T21:08:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	ah, that's perfect

2008-04-21T21:10:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	wow, all the errors are IN X itself... but FontFileCompleteXLFD often sets my copy of X up the bomb... so it may be your graphics card.
2008-04-21T21:11:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	POSSIBLY. Disable compiz, xcompmgr, everything else, switch off stuff like AIGLX and stuff, and see how that goes.
2008-04-21T21:13:00.000Z	wild_oscar	dav7	that would leave ubuntu pretty stripped down
2008-04-21T21:13:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	true... I know...
2008-04-21T21:13:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	X randomly crashes here, and it started when I enabled xcompmgr, sooo... :/

2008-04-21T21:22:00.000Z	dav7	wild_oscar	ahhh, I see.
