2010-01-05T21:28:00.000Z	om26er		how can i make a /boot partition in ubuntu after installation
2010-01-05T21:29:00.000Z	mkanyicy	om26er	why do you want to do this? for fun?
2010-01-05T21:29:00.000Z	om26er	mkanyicy	install ubuntu on a memory card that my netbook don't boot but if /boot is on the SSD then i can boot
2010-01-05T21:30:00.000Z	mkanyicy	om26er	are you sure that will work?
2010-01-05T21:30:00.000Z	om26er		i did not make /boot during install because partman was crashing during setup if i do custom partition
2010-01-05T21:31:00.000Z	om26er	mkanyicy	wokred before
2010-01-05T21:31:00.000Z	mkanyicy		ok om26er here we go
2010-01-05T21:31:00.000Z	mkanyicy	om26er	use gparted to resize and create a big enough partiton to dedicate it to /boot
2010-01-05T21:32:00.000Z	om26er		ok
2010-01-05T21:32:00.000Z	mkanyicy	om26er	and boot on liveCD and copy the /boot files to that partition and create the mount line in /etc/fstab for /boot
2010-01-05T21:33:00.000Z	om26er	mkanyicy	without UUID in fstab?
2010-01-05T21:33:00.000Z	mkanyicy		with UUID in fstab of course om26er

2010-01-05T21:34:00.000Z	om26er	mkanyicy	grub?
2010-01-05T21:35:00.000Z	mkanyicy	om26er	ahaaa! grub! but you said it worked before, how did you do it?
2010-01-05T21:36:00.000Z	om26er	mkanyicy	it worked before meant that when i installed before and made a /boot during install..(but this time ubiquity is crashing)
