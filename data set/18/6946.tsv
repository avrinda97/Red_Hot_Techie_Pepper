2008-03-31T04:28:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	if you used sudo -- yes .. dont use su.. ubuntu has no root password
2008-03-31T04:41:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	are you renting out a machine or something?
2008-03-31T04:41:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	It's a cheap unmanaged VPS plan that I bought so I could learn how to setup a server.
2008-03-31T04:42:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	it's not surprising then that everything's not as it should be -- its not that the install is faulty, you just have to know how to workaround all these anomalies
2008-03-31T04:43:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	Yes, that's what I've been doing all day. So was the OS installation (via my control panel) some sort of bare minimum Ubuntu installation?
2008-04-02T11:12:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	if you use the 'who' or 'w' commands, you should see how exactly the various users are interacting with the system .. it is quite normal to see yourself logged in multiple times
2008-04-02T11:12:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	I think that instead of su <user>, I should have typed exit to prevent this from occurring.
2008-04-02T11:13:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	you shouldn't be using su anyway, always use sudo
2008-04-02T11:13:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	ah..no wonder I see several <user> and root in ps aux
2008-04-02T11:13:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	Thanks.
2008-04-02T11:14:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	Now is there a way to delete these superfluous login names?
2008-04-02T11:15:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	you don't need to delete the 'superfluous' user sessions because they are you interacting with the system in different ways
2008-04-02T11:16:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	Okay, thanks.
2008-04-02T11:16:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	like i said, use 'who' or 'w' to see how they are working with the system
2008-04-02T11:17:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	Okay, I see. Each <user> is using a different screen window.
2008-04-02T11:17:00.000Z	unop_	LainIwakura	right, so that's why you see your current username logged in thrice
2008-04-02T11:17:00.000Z	LainIwakura	unop_	Great, thanks for your help.
