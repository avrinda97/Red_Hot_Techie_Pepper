2008-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 can use keyboard in the bios, but not in grub?
2008-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 try enabling 'legacy usb support' in the bios..  I got a machine with the identical issue.. i had to use a ps2 keyboard for it.
2008-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 if i enabled legacy usb - then  the thing wouldent boot Windows OR linux right. :(
2008-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 check out the bios settings menus..
2008-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 rember where its at.. You may have to reneable it. :)
2008-05-25T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 that sounds weird and convulated...
2008-05-25T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 the live cd and alt-cd install the same os. just different installers. so if the live cd works.. use its installer tool
2008-05-25T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 the live cd CAN install to the hard drive. . You dont need the alt cd to install.
2008-05-25T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 last i looked the live cd even had a 'install' option in the boot menus. or you can use the install icon on the desktop.
2008-05-25T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 try the 'install'  option in the boot menu?
2008-05-25T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 ahh the install option was at the GRUB menu i belive which you cant mess with.
2008-05-25T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 its the first menu you see. I noiticed the kubuntu live dvd here -  flasked that lanugage dialog up real fast. I had to hit the escape key to see the actual menu under it.
2008-05-25T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	  sort of annoying it asked for the language so fast. that you dont see the menu under it.
2008-05-25T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 You DONT.  its a menu befor the kernel even loads.
2008-05-25T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	  its weird that the installer on the desktop is not working. I guess your only other option is to try burning the alt-cd to a disk and booting from it
2008-05-25T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 of course.. it installs an identical os to the live cd
2008-05-25T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 no idea.  its possible perhaps to boot from a usb driuve..but i dont mess with that stuff.
2008-05-25T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shervin	 i ran out of cd's so i gtrabbed the dvd release this time. :) i got stacks of dvds
