2009-03-08T07:27:00.000Z	Dreamglider		Can anyone tell me how i could salvage some data on a 60Gb NTFS partition where some 40Gb of data had been written on it (The data has been written from the very beginning of the partition out to about 40Gb)
2009-03-08T07:28:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	what happened to it?
2009-03-08T07:29:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	i dd'd is and messed up on the soure destination
2009-03-08T07:29:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	so you used dd to do what?
2009-03-08T07:30:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	the ntfs is 60Gb after that there was a ext3 of about 15Gb which i managed to save (the Ubuntu installation im on now :) )
2009-03-08T07:31:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	i saw gone clone a disk
2009-03-08T07:31:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	you tried to clone a disk and did what? I am sorry that I do not understand
2009-03-08T07:33:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	i did a dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda to clone a disk right? And messed up on the sda and sdb part and copied 40Gb of a new empty drive to the drive i was gona clone. (is this better, Sry but my native language is not English)
2009-03-08T07:34:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	yeah, now I understand
2009-03-08T07:34:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	you can not get anything from the first 40GB of the disk
2009-03-08T07:35:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	unlike a normal delete, this actually made your disk zeroed out
2009-03-08T07:35:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	yea i know that, i was thinking about the last 20Gb of the partition whitch should be there
2009-03-08T07:36:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	you can use programs like photorec to try to recover data from there
2009-03-08T07:39:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	i know the NFTS begins at the very beginning of the disk and goes out to 60Gb CHS 7648-254-63 (Where the EXT3 stars at 7649-0-1)
2009-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	there are some programs online. photorec can find your photos. There are also other programs out there. I do not remember any of them
2009-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	Dreamglider	tekteen	what was that program u mentioned again ?
2009-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	photorec finds pictures
2009-03-08T07:46:00.000Z	tekteen	Dreamglider	photorec can find these files http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/File_Formats_Recovered_By_PhotoRec
