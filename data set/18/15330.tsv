2006-09-04T13:56:00.000Z	holycow		well ubuntu now is not only the biggest distro outside of maybe debian, it has THE BEST documentation wiki anywhere
2006-09-04T13:56:00.000Z	holycow		this distro really can help noobs just get in there and start hacking away at it to make stuff work for the  most part

2006-09-04T13:57:00.000Z	mopflite	holycow	ubuntu has taken over from suse in that respect
2006-09-04T13:57:00.000Z	holycow	mopflite	*nod* indeed
2006-09-04T13:57:00.000Z	holycow	mopflite	just goes to show that novel would of been better off doing what mark has done
2006-09-04T13:58:00.000Z	mopflite	holycow	novell are hopeless at marketing, full stop - from experience, they would struggle with any product, no matter how good it was
2006-09-04T13:59:00.000Z	holycow	mopflite	i'm starting to think the same
2006-09-04T13:59:00.000Z	holycow	mopflite	they have such an amazing distribution system
2006-09-04T14:00:00.000Z	mopflite	holycow	for example, novell groupwise is a great product - it should have higher market share than microsoft exchange - the only reason it isn't is due to novell's marketing and commercial shortcomings
2006-09-04T14:00:00.000Z	holycow	mopflite	indeed
