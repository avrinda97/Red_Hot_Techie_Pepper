2007-05-01T10:22:00.000Z	pr0nGuy		How can I install the help packages for gimp on Edgy?
2007-05-01T10:23:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 look in synaptic for gimp you'll be able to tell which package it is I am sure,  probably with a doc at theend
2007-05-03T07:30:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 might be case related,   pdf is not the same as PDF in linux
2007-05-03T07:32:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	it said pdf.  my bad.  I thought they were the same.
2007-05-03T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 in windows it would not matter,  but it linux is does
2007-05-03T07:33:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	what's the diff?
2007-05-03T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 you can still open the file by opening it from the app,
2007-05-03T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	  linux is case sensitive
2007-05-03T07:34:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 I'm not saying it's the problem but it is a possibility
2007-05-03T07:34:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	i understand the case sensitivity
2007-05-03T07:34:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	but I should probably open the pdf reader and then open it from there?
2007-05-03T07:36:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 that is my suggestion
2007-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	I'm pretty new to Linux, so I don't know what app that would be.  I'm using Edgy (Gnome).  Could you direct me?
2007-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 evince
2007-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 if you donT, find it in the menus, just start it from the terminal
2007-05-03T07:41:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	i just opened evince and double-clicked on the desktop icon of those files.  It worked.
2007-05-03T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	pr0nGuy	 great
2007-05-03T07:42:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	Pelo	thanks for your help.  I heard of evince, but I didn't think i had it by default.
