2007-03-23T15:10:00.000Z	hipitihop		Can someone please advise, I have a non critical Edgy install, can I upgrade to the new Feisty beta or should I do a clean install
2007-03-23T15:10:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	for noncritical, go for an updgrade
2007-03-23T15:11:00.000Z	hipitihop	Enselic	hybrid , thanks, will this complicate things once I want to upgrade to final release next month ?
2007-03-23T15:12:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	well, it is a beta ;) but no, there should be no problems
2007-03-23T15:13:00.000Z	hipitihop	Enselic	:-) beta warning noted. final question should I donwload the alternative iso or just change sources and dist-upgrade ?
2007-03-23T15:13:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	you have desktop and want alternative?
2007-03-23T15:15:00.000Z	hipitihop	Enselic	?? I installed Edgy from a Desktop CD, I thought I need alternate for upgrade
2007-03-23T15:16:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	oh, well no. 'alternative' is a variant, just like 'desktop' and 'server'
2007-03-23T15:17:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	so, if you have 'desktop', don't bother with any 'alternative' stuff
2007-03-23T15:19:00.000Z	hipitihop	Enselic	oh my bad, must have picked up the wrong info back when upgrading from 5.10 to 6.06 or something...so should I download the Desktop ISO or go with dist-upgrade by changing sources ?
2007-03-23T15:21:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	there are more things that can go wrong on an upgrade, so if you want to be as safe as possible, go for the cd
2007-03-23T15:24:00.000Z	hipitihop	Enselic	to be sure 1. Download desktop ISO and boot from it 2. It will allow to upgrade my current Edgy ?
2007-03-23T15:25:00.000Z	Enselic	hipitihop	nope, upgrading is done with an app, hang on Ill give you link
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	hipitihop	Enselic	one of the forums says just do: gksu "upgrade-manager -c -d"
