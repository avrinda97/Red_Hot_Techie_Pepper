2007-04-12T13:40:00.000Z	Rawn027		can i get grub working with ubuntu
2007-04-12T13:40:00.000Z	Rawn027		just point me in the right direction :)
2007-04-12T13:42:00.000Z	Rawn027		grub is a bootloader
2007-04-12T13:44:00.000Z	Rawn027		The computer boots just fine with lilo
2007-04-12T13:44:00.000Z	Rawn027		i need grub to run xen
2007-04-12T13:44:00.000Z	Rawn027		do you know what Xen is?
2007-04-12T13:45:00.000Z	Rawn027		i already tried to use mbootpack to make a conglomerate kernel that contains both the xen kernel and the vmlinux kernel for the dom0 no such luck
2007-04-12T13:46:00.000Z	Rawn027		i know how to use grub as well as Xen
2007-04-12T13:46:00.000Z	Rawn027		i was wondering if there was any secret to useing grub in raid/lvm setup
2007-04-12T13:46:00.000Z	Rawn027		you might not have LVM
2007-04-12T13:47:00.000Z	mjr	Rawn027	there's the secret that grub can't read lvm or raid (except raid-1, where it actually just reads one part of the mirror)
2007-04-12T13:47:00.000Z	Rawn027	mjr	so if my boot is on raid 1 i should be ok?
2007-04-12T13:47:00.000Z	mjr	Rawn027	yes
2007-04-12T13:48:00.000Z	Rawn027	mjr	and what do i specify my root as? /dev/md3?
2007-04-12T13:49:00.000Z	mjr	Rawn027	hmh? If you mean where you should install grub, yes, probably /dev/sda; and as root, well, yes, /dev/mdX, where X is appropriate
2007-04-12T13:52:00.000Z	Rawn027	mjr	what about grub2
2007-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	Rawn027	mjr	when trying to run grub-install i get the following
2007-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	Rawn027	mjr	/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-root does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
