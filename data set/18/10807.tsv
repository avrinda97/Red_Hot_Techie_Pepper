2006-11-04T06:28:00.000Z	concept10	GerManson	Though TC:E is based on the ET engine, it has higher minimum system requirements:
2006-11-04T06:28:00.000Z	concept10		You'll need at least an 800mhz processor, 320mb of RAM, a 64mb video card and 750mb of free space as Enemy Territory weights 250mb and TCE 0.49 around 450mb. Recommended system specs are a 128mb video card and at least 512mb of RAM.
2006-11-04T06:29:00.000Z	GerManson	concept10	thanks for the info :) ttyl and tell you what i think of the game :)
