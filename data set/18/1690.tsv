2011-07-28T18:52:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	what you need is free partition with enough space
2011-10-26T00:15:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	there are 4 linux downloads, 2 of those are 64 bit, so the other 2 are probably 32
2011-10-26T00:16:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	thanks i will download the self extracting bin and install via terminal
2011-10-26T00:17:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	any specific reason you need to do that and not use openjdk from repository?
2011-10-26T00:19:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	well its not for me its for someone else as he is trying to get his android device back to stock factory conditions and in order for that to happen, he has to install java or update it to latest version in order to run a SamsungCaptivate-SGHi897-UCKB2-NoRoot-One-Click.jar
2011-10-26T00:19:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	here is link he is following: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1266172
2011-10-26T00:19:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	then just try openjdk, manual installation is not really recommended
2011-10-26T00:21:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	okay but when he clicks on jar file it says: The file SamsungCaptivate-SGHi897-UCKB2-NoRoot-One-Click.jar' is not marked as executable.
2011-10-26T00:22:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	i guess he has to make it executable first with a: chmod a+x
2011-10-26T00:22:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	yop
2011-10-26T00:23:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	okay will tell him to try to cd to where file is then run chmod a+x with "jar file name"
2011-10-26T00:24:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	he can also do that via gui, right click properties
2011-10-26T00:24:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	he can, how?
2011-10-26T00:25:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	on pemissions tab there is a checkbox to mark it as executable
2011-10-26T00:25:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	cool will tell him that now
2011-10-26T00:26:00.000Z	dc5ala	ghostnik11	that's just a security thingy for gui, so double clicking does not execute things you may not want to. On command line he don't need that: "java -jar blabla.jar" will execute it too
2011-10-26T00:30:00.000Z	ghostnik11	dc5ala	thanks for that tip, didn't know "java" command would also execute will make note of that for future use
