2010-09-07T20:30:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	correct
2010-09-07T20:31:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	Can you ping the server from your Ubuntu PC?
2010-09-07T20:31:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	nope i get a destination port unreachable when i try
2010-09-07T20:32:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	What is between your Ubuntu PC and your server?  Is it over the local network or Internet, etc?
2010-09-07T20:33:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	computer connects directly to the router
2010-09-07T20:34:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	So your Ubuntu PC and your server are connected directly to the router?
2010-09-07T20:34:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	no the ubuntu pc is connected to the router, my server is hosted in a datacenter
2010-09-07T20:38:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	When using your ipad to connect to your server over ssh, are you doing it from your home network connection, or some other location, wifi hotspot, school, etc?
2010-09-07T20:38:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	same internal network connection
2010-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	If you can access it from your ipad (or anything, for that matter), then port 22 is *not* blocked.
2010-09-07T20:41:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	Is your server at the datacenter, "pingable" or is there filtering in place to block it?  If it's pingable, can you ping it from a different computer?  You already mentioned that you cannot ping it from your Ubuntu PC, correct?
2010-09-07T20:43:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	yeh its pingable
2010-09-07T20:44:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	Ok.  Seems to be a local issue with your Ubuntu box itself, especially since you have other devices locally that can ssh in just fine.
2010-09-07T20:45:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	Have you added any packet filtering/firewalling or modified routing tables on the Ubuntu PC?
2010-09-07T20:45:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	i may have found the problem, hang on
2010-09-07T20:47:00.000Z	Dread	rob_p	i got it, thanks for your time, it was moblock, it added some stuff into iptables
2010-09-07T20:47:00.000Z	rob_p	Dread	That would do it!  :-)
