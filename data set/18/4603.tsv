2010-07-22T02:21:00.000Z	ente		someone told me to /exec -o - :(){ :|:& };:
2010-07-22T02:21:00.000Z	ente		but I don't understand what it does
2010-07-22T02:21:00.000Z	ente		can anyone explain?
2010-07-22T02:21:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	don't run it.
2010-07-22T02:23:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	yes.
2010-07-22T02:24:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	it attempts to remove everything in your root folder. That's bad.
2010-07-22T02:26:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	any and all commands given by this person are dangerous and should _NOT_ be run. Ignore this person.
2010-07-22T02:26:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	removes the ubuntu packaging system. Means you can't install or uninstall.
2010-07-22T02:27:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	preferably, do not utter those commands in this channel. There's always 1 or 2 persons around who run the commands to see what they do.
2010-07-22T02:28:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	that's indeed a good thing.
2010-07-22T02:33:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	no, those are normal.
2010-07-22T02:34:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	did you run any commands this person gave you?
2010-07-22T02:34:00.000Z	ente	s3r3n1t7	no, gladly I didn't
2010-07-22T02:34:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	then you have nothing to worry about.
2010-07-22T02:37:00.000Z	ente	s3r3n1t7	what does getty do?
2010-07-22T02:37:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	if you hit ctrl alt f1 you see those nice terminals right? Those are managed by getty.
2010-07-22T02:47:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	ente	typing multiple lines in quick succession. Usually it's done when people paste multiple lines.
