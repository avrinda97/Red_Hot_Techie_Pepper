2009-10-25T20:14:00.000Z	arielCo		Hello again. I'm trying to install mplayer, but I get " Depends: libdirectfb-1.0-0 which is a virtual package" for both mplayer and mplayer-nogui.
2009-10-25T20:14:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	and?
2009-10-25T20:15:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	install it if it asks for it.
2009-10-25T20:15:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	so I cannot install it - mplayer[-nogui] are shown as broken, and the "solution"  is to leave them uninstalled
2009-10-25T20:16:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	you're installing a dependency for mplayer not mplayer[-nogui] right? you'll be fine
2009-10-25T20:17:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	both - I typed "sudo aptitude install mplayer", and it complains about both packages depending on the virtual pkg
2009-10-25T20:18:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	the proposed solution is "doing nothing" >_>
2009-10-25T20:18:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	so you can't install mplayer and libdirectfb?
2009-10-25T20:19:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	I didn't try libdirectfb alone - shouldn't aptitude do it automatically as it is a dependency?
2009-10-25T20:20:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	yes. just because that's the proposed solution doesn't mean that's what you have to do.
2009-10-25T20:20:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	what ubuntu version are you running, what repo's do you have enabled/
2009-10-25T20:20:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	oh, I have a different version installed - 1.2-0, and mplayer is asking specifically for 1.0-0
2009-10-25T20:21:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	I'm on karmic - I'll put the sources.list in a pastebin
2009-10-25T20:23:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	my mplayer depends on libdirectfb-1.0-0
2009-10-25T20:23:00.000Z	mazda01	arielCo	im running jaunty. if you're running karmic I am not sure
2009-10-25T20:24:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	yup, I'll ask on #ubuntu+1
2009-10-25T20:48:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	I got it - the Nvidia vdpau repository was offering mplayer too, and it was set to 'jaunty'  =/
2009-10-25T20:49:00.000Z	arielCo	mazda01	why is the Nvidia repo offering mplayer, and why does it not ask me about the different version ?
