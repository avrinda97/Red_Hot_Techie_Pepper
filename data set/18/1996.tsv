2010-11-15T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	AbhiJit	What python applications specifically? Python is a programming language.
2010-11-15T10:33:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Jordan_U	it just shows 'python' not any application
2010-11-15T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	AbhiJit	The purpose of /usr/bin/python is to run python applications, it doesn't do anything else.
2010-11-15T10:34:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Jordan_U	yah now asking in #python
2010-11-15T10:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	AbhiJit	Run "ps aux | grep xxxx" where xxxx is the pid of the python process to see the full cmdline, which will tell you what python application is running.

2010-11-15T10:40:00.000Z	AbhiJit		you are still stuck on font issue Agent001 ?? :s
2010-11-15T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	AbhiJit	That's far too subjective to answer.
2010-11-15T10:40:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Jordan_U	means? its good or bad?
2010-11-15T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	AbhiJit	Sorry, that was for Agent001
