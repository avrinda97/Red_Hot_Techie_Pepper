2009-02-04T01:06:00.000Z	racecar56		it was a minute ago
2009-02-04T01:07:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Does dmesg say anything?
2009-02-04T01:08:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Don't paste it here, put it on a pastebin
2009-02-04T01:16:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Unplug the device, try to rmmod both sd_mod and usb_storage, then modprobe them back, plug it back in
2009-02-04T01:17:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Yes, you'll need to find out what's using those modules and stop the processes
2009-02-04T01:24:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Did you kill whatever is using sd_mod so you could rmmod it?
2009-02-04T01:32:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Well, a brute force solution is rebooting
2009-02-04T01:33:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	What do you mean "where does it go"? It's a kernel module.
2009-02-04T01:34:00.000Z	TML	racecar56	Like I said, "reboot" is one way
