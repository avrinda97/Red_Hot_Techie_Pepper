2009-07-30T01:57:00.000Z	magical_walrus		How can I move files between Ubuntu and installtion of Windows on VirtualBox?
2009-07-30T01:57:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	try #vbox (also the official documentation explains iirc)
2009-07-30T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	did you check the vbox official documentation?
2009-07-30T02:13:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	Where is that?
2009-07-30T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	here you go... http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#sharedfolders
2009-07-30T02:14:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	Thanks
2009-08-03T22:53:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	I've got nano open, but what next? Read file?
2009-08-03T22:53:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	no.  Close nano.  Open it by doing: nano ~/.gnomerc, then type "WINDOW_MANAGER=metacity", then save and exit
2009-08-03T22:58:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	When I attempt to open gnomerc with nano, it says file not found in /root/
2009-08-03T22:58:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	you didn't type what I told you to type then
2009-08-03T22:59:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	or: why are you root?
2009-08-03T22:59:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	why do you want to use X in recovery mode?  Why are you in recovery mode?
2009-08-03T23:01:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	I don't want to use x in recovery mode, and i'm in recovery mode because I cannot use regular mode (it is simply a white screen)
2009-08-03T23:01:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	ok.  Then replace "~" with "~YOUR_USERNAME" in my command
2009-08-03T23:01:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	Ok
2009-08-03T23:06:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	I did as you said and starts ubuntu normally, but it is still a white screen
2009-08-03T23:11:00.000Z	jrib	magical_walrus	what is your username?
2009-08-03T23:30:00.000Z	magical_walrus	jrib	sorry, I had to go do something. My username is miguel
