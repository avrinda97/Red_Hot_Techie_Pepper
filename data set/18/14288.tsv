2005-08-25T15:09:00.000Z	llpamies	ORiON2012	The filesistem is ok, because now I'm chrooted inside with a Live hoary.
2005-08-25T15:10:00.000Z	llpamies	ORiON2012	I think that the problem is that initrd.img doesn't has the ext3 drivers
2005-08-25T15:16:00.000Z	ORiON2012	llpamies	have to ask, exactly what was performed prior to the kernel upgrade?
2005-08-25T15:17:00.000Z	llpamies	ORiON2012	I don't understand, what want you say ?
2005-08-25T15:18:00.000Z	ORiON2012	llpamies	you said you were upgrading, it would probably be useful to know exactly what you upgraded.
2005-08-25T15:19:00.000Z	llpamies	ORiON2012	I think that the problem is that when It try to create the initrd image appear this error: cpio:   /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7feb000): No such file or directory
2005-08-25T15:21:00.000Z	llpamies	ORiON2012	and the cpio error is not important?
2005-08-25T15:21:00.000Z	ORiON2012	llpamies	I'm sorry ut it's beyond me
