2009-07-23T02:02:00.000Z	alfaromeo		i have problem with burning dvd, i try to burn some .avi file but i cant... it says media is not formatted or unsupported.
2009-07-23T02:03:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	are you trying to burn a video dvd or a data dvd?
2009-07-23T02:04:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	data
2009-07-23T02:04:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	using brasero?
2009-07-23T02:04:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	, tried brasero gnome... andk3b
2009-07-23T02:05:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	brasero should allow it no problem. Are you sure the dvd in the drive is a good one?
2009-07-23T02:06:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	i dont know. i use usb Dvd-w
2009-07-23T02:08:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	ok....open brasero, choose to create a data dvd. Click Add and add one avi file to the list...then click on burn.
2009-07-23T02:08:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	Brasero should open a second window and there make sure you have the usb drive selected
2009-07-23T02:09:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	 i select correct drive
2009-07-23T02:09:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	 i ll pastebin wait...
2009-07-23T02:09:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	and make sure there is a blank dvd in the drive
2009-07-23T02:10:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	http://paste.ubuntu.com/224966/
2009-07-23T02:12:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	it looks like the dvd in the drive is not blank....that is my best guess from that printout..."(cannot write medium - incompatible format)"
2009-07-23T02:13:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	i bought 50 blank dvd and try 5 of them :S
2009-07-23T02:13:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	I wonder if what you have is a cd read/write but for dvd it is read only
2009-07-23T02:14:00.000Z	th0r	alfaromeo	the designations can sometimes mislead....make sure the dvd drive can WRITE dvds as well as cds
2009-07-23T02:15:00.000Z	alfaromeo	th0r	ok i ll try it on windows
