2007-04-18T07:59:00.000Z	kristjan_		is it possible to install all those betas and alfas without burning a cd (I would like to burn only final release)?
2007-04-18T07:59:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	yes, in virtual machines
2007-04-18T08:01:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	are virtual machines safe way to install? why doesn't iso support installation from harddisk?
2007-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	yes virtual machines are safe. In fact they're safer than installing it normally
2007-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	an ISO isn't like a binary (exe file for Windows people). Ubuntu is an OS, not an application
2007-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	that's not to say you can't install Ubuntu in Windows, there are projects under way
2007-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	other distros, like suse and mandrake let you install from harddisk (I have heard)
2007-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	I'm willing to try virtual machine installation. Is there a howto somewhere? (I can't find anything like this in ubuntu wiki)
2007-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	are you running Windows right now?
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	no, kubuntu, but I decided it
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	install VirtualBox
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	that's very easy to use
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	*it is wrong to burn isos all the time that I will use only once
2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	yep, I understand
2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	what's the package name?
2007-04-18T08:08:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	you'll have to get it off the website... google virtual box, then download the deb for your version of Ubuntu
2007-04-18T08:10:00.000Z	kristjan_	ArtVandalae	is qemu (that is found in repos) same thing?
2007-04-18T08:11:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	kristjan_	yes, but it might be harder to configure, and not as fast (not without kqemu anyway)
