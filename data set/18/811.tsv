2012-03-16T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahhughez	windows in VM will be ok then imho
2012-03-16T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahhughez	Win7 as a VM, or a dual boot?
2012-04-04T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahhughez	drop to root recovery mode and run:  nvidia-xconfig; reboot
2012-04-04T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahhughez	hold shift at boot
2012-04-04T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahhughez	your monitor isn't great and isn't talking back to the system, so the driver cannot load. You may need an xorg.conf file which nvidia-xconfig generates to TELL the system how to work
2012-04-04T16:05:00.000Z	ahhughez	ActionParsnip	copy :) says... Unable to write to directory /etc/X11 wtf.... this is as root of course too.
2012-04-04T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahhughez	possibly mounted read only..
2012-04-04T16:30:00.000Z	ahhughez	ActionParsnip	looks like this is a known/common problem.
2012-04-04T16:37:00.000Z	ahhughez	ActionParsnip	ok.. back working... although had to remove every sign that nvidia existed.
2012-04-04T16:41:00.000Z	ahhughez	ActionParsnip	ok thanks so much for your help tonight!!!! I really appreciate it. Look like I hit bug 888373 which has been around since November 2011.
