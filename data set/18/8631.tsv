2008-12-08T22:24:00.000Z	fasta		Does hibernation already work on $NEWHARDWARE? And if so, how does it work?
2008-12-08T22:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	fasta	"it depends" is always the answer.  Works fine on my Eee PC with ubuntu-eee tweaks (no idea if any of those affect hiberation).
2008-12-08T22:26:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	I thought all the shiny features would work on new hardware, but I just tried it and it didn't seem to go and hibernate. The screen went off, but the machine was still on.
2008-12-08T22:26:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	the machine should power down, right?
2008-12-08T22:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	fasta	yup
2008-12-08T22:27:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	is there anything that one should configure in the BIOS or whatever?
2008-12-08T22:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	fasta	not generally - check Launchpad and the forums for kernel bug reports for your model and see if anyone else has a reported a solution.
2008-12-08T22:27:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	yes, I already see there is a bug reported, and that guy even upgraded his BIOS.
2008-12-08T22:28:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/219675 <- very long list
2008-12-08T22:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	fasta	then just subscribe to the bug so you know what happens with it
2008-12-08T22:31:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	how long does hibernation take on $newhardware?
2008-12-08T22:31:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	Imagine 2GB of RAM being used.
2008-12-08T22:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	fasta	depends on the speed of your hard drive
2008-12-08T22:32:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	can I query that information somewhere?
2008-12-08T22:32:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	I didn't build this machine.
2008-12-08T22:34:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	ok, how long does it take on your machine?
2008-12-08T22:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	fasta	lshw might tell you something about the drive.  For me it's probably like 10-15 seconds.
2008-12-08T22:37:00.000Z	fasta	tonyyarusso	it's a WD3200AAKS-7 , but I cannot find the datasheet for it.
