2009-01-05T03:35:00.000Z	eitreach		Can someone perhaps help me with Skype? I can't seem to close it or change status.
2009-01-05T03:36:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	open a terminal and type in the command "killall skype"
2009-01-05T03:36:00.000Z	eitreach	komputes	Doesn't work. I have to shut it down via the system monitor.
2009-01-05T03:37:00.000Z	eitreach		I was just wondering if it was a common problem with a common solution.
2009-01-05T03:37:00.000Z	komputes		I doubt skype is being started as root
2009-01-05T03:37:00.000Z	eitreach		I have to delete the configuration folder each time I start it, basically.
2009-01-05T03:38:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	are you running the latest version of skype on i386 (32-bit)
2009-01-05T03:38:00.000Z	eitreach	komputes	I just downloaded it from the main site. Are there any other version?
2009-01-05T03:39:00.000Z	eitreach		It's like it doesn't interact with the rest of the system.
2009-01-05T03:39:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	you are running ubuntu 32-bit or 64-bit? which version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-01-05T03:40:00.000Z	eitreach	komputes	32bit system, Intrepid.
2009-01-05T03:40:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	same here and skype works fine for me
2009-01-05T03:40:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	if it ever locks up "killall skype" usually works at closing it
2009-01-05T03:41:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	when you say it "doesn't work" wjat error do you get when you run that command?
2009-01-05T03:41:00.000Z	eitreach	komputes	It seems incredibly slow as well. Could it be that the qt-stuff isn't working right?
2009-01-05T03:41:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	perhaps, are you runing gnome or kde?
2009-01-05T03:42:00.000Z	eitreach	komputes	Gnome. Standard Ubuntu.
2009-01-05T03:42:00.000Z	komputes	eitreach	what error do you get when you type "killall skype"?
