2010-03-06T06:45:00.000Z	Dan_E		 i was running the system tester on ubuntu and it froze up and i cant close it. is there a killall command for closing it?
2010-03-06T06:47:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	check the Processes tab in the System > Administration > System Monitor application
2010-03-06T06:47:00.000Z	Dan_E		k
2010-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	Dan_E	brjann	doesnt show it !!
2010-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	i suppose I should have mentioned System Tester goes by the name "checkbox-gtk" :)
2010-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	Dan_E		k
2010-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	Dan_E		:)
2010-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	Dan_E		ok ended the process but it is still on the desktop
2010-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	ended, or killed?
2010-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	Dan_E		ended
2010-03-06T07:00:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	it might be hung hard enough to prevent the relatively gentle "end" request. right click on that process and click the "kill process" menu item
2010-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	Dan_E		it is gone from the process's list.
2010-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	but the window is still on the desktop?
2010-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	Dan_E		yes
2010-03-06T07:03:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	maybe you just need a screen refresh. try switching virtual desktops and switching back using the applet in the lower right hand corner of the screen
2010-03-06T07:04:00.000Z	Dan_E		ok moved it to a different desktop and it closed
2010-03-06T07:05:00.000Z	Dan_E		thanks brjann
2010-03-06T07:05:00.000Z	brjann	Dan_E	great :) it had closed, but gnome hadn't refreshed the screen, that's all. glad we could help!
