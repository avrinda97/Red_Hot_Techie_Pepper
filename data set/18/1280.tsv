2011-04-17T04:19:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	9.10 use grub2 so you can do it with thatt version of ubuntu
2011-04-22T02:13:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	do it during install
2011-04-22T02:13:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	why?
2011-04-22T02:14:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	delete during install of xp  :)
2011-04-22T02:15:00.000Z	KINGOFSWORDS	zvacet	i already said i can get xp install disk to run with the partitions
2011-04-22T02:16:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	when you start to install xp it will ask you about partitions (space to use) donÂ´t give entire space to xp
2011-04-22T02:16:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	use Ubuntu live CD and with gparted delete all partitions
2011-04-22T02:17:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	but it is strange because you should be able to boot xp from cd
2011-04-22T02:18:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	or you can download gparted live cd and do it with it  http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
2011-04-22T02:19:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	try gparted live cd
2011-04-22T02:20:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	: yes
2011-04-22T02:21:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	yes just try and you will see how easy it is
2011-04-22T02:22:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	create partitions during install you can choose manual way
2011-04-22T02:23:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	yes,alternate will create partitions
2011-04-22T02:24:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	after xp install you will have unallocated space on that space install Ubuntu and make partitions
2011-04-22T02:25:00.000Z	zvacet	KINGOFSWORDS	good for you  8-)
