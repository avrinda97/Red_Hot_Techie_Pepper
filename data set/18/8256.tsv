2007-09-24T07:42:00.000Z	ep1		is there yahoo messenger for ubuntu ? there is one for debian and it isnt working
2007-09-24T07:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	google for an ubuntu package of it
2007-09-24T07:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	if u cant find one, the debian package should work fine also
2007-09-24T07:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	nvm, u said the debian pack doesnt work
2007-09-24T07:44:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	yes I think it showed dependency problem
2007-09-24T07:45:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	youll probably need the same dependency with an ubuntu package, what did it need?
2007-09-24T07:45:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	ok sorry I think I need this sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.6
2007-09-24T07:47:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	It cant find libssl0.9.6
2007-09-24T07:48:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	sudo apt-get install libssl
2007-09-24T07:49:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	E: Package libssl has no installation candidate
2007-09-24T07:49:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	try libssl0.9.8
2007-09-24T07:50:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	it says already have newest version uggh
2007-09-24T07:51:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	try this: sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 /usr/libssl.so.0.9.6
2007-09-24T07:52:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	its kinda a hack, but there probably isnt much of a difference from 0.9.6 to 0.9.8 so itll prolly work
2007-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	 sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 /usr/libssl.so.0.9.6
2007-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	yea, give it a shot
2007-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ep1	if it doesnt work: sudo rm /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.6
2007-09-24T08:06:00.000Z	ep1	MasterShrek	It depends on an old version of libssl0.9.6 that doesnt exist, so I guess this isnt working for me
