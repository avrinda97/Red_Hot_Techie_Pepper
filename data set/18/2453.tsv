2010-05-25T00:23:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	adm is a separate valid group.
2010-05-25T00:24:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	but its the wrong group -- and I'd guess its the old group he was in before he migrated to ubuntu ?
2010-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	Thats not going to fix it permanently, using useradd instead of adduser skips many of the initial setup that most people consider normal for auser account, like copying /etc/skel/ and making the user part of some initial groups.
2010-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	PS1 is just the bash prompt -- I wasnt trying to fix his adduser problem :)
2010-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	Oh, okay. :)
2010-05-26T21:54:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	You probably could derive the load per cpu from /proc/stat, but I'm not sure of the calculation.
2010-05-28T20:26:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	No. Why do you ask?
2010-05-28T20:27:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	Seems to be working for me.  And it worked above too :)
2010-05-28T20:28:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	yeah but I had to bang-pt instead to get taht. a week ago I could bang-br  :)
2010-05-28T20:28:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	!br worked for you when you did it before. Look closer ;)
2010-05-28T20:29:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	oo I think my iirc client has been having issues with not reporting all messages in time
2010-05-28T20:29:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	if it worked
2010-05-28T20:30:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	I had this problem just a minute ago on #bash too, couldn't read someone's response and people were telling me "he just answered you" .. then I scan up and bam, it appears
2010-08-19T17:59:00.000Z	blue_anna	Pici	- thank you
2010-08-19T18:33:00.000Z	Pici	blue_anna	Have you looked at the changelogs?
