2004-10-15T15:06:00.000Z	jde		Hello.
2004-10-15T15:06:00.000Z	jde		Ummm ... I'm having trouble backing up my music CD's with cdrecord.
2004-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	jde		I've decode the files to wav and issued the command 'cdrecord -v -eject dev=/dev/hdb driveropts=burnfree minbuf=25 -dao *.wav', and all I get is alot of crappy sounds on my CD.
2004-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	why do you want to listen to musicians that most of the time don't even bother getting expert credentials in the fields they want to vocalize.
2004-10-15T15:08:00.000Z	jde	pyramid	huh?
2004-10-15T15:09:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	well for example what PhD's does acdc hold to qualify what they are talking about.
2004-10-15T15:09:00.000Z	jde	pyramid	I don't listen to AC(thuderbolt)DC.
2004-10-15T15:14:00.000Z	jde	pyramid	I don't think anyone offers college courses on rocking out, or big bottomed girls.
2004-10-15T15:14:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	actually they are teaching sex education in some colleges now.
2004-10-15T15:14:00.000Z	jde	pyramid	you can't major in it though.
2004-10-15T15:15:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	well it seems like many people want to major in it...given the numbers that flock to those classes.
2004-10-15T15:15:00.000Z	jde	pyramid	I'm sure alot of people would, still ...
2004-10-15T15:16:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	and then there is Dr. Ruth with all her brilliant sexual advice.
2004-10-16T06:56:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	he needs to input some information...to set it up.
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	cups works ok here...not perfect but very usable.
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	what doesn't work for you.
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	jde	pyramid	works fine on ubuntu sept I've had to jump through hoops on other distros.
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	pyramid	jde	well i haven't had too much problem with it except for the cups drivers...but when i use the gimp-print driver with cups i don't have much problems.
