2011-08-09T17:13:00.000Z	sabya		my Ubuntu 11.04 install (alongside Win 7) hangs at the screen where they ask "where are you?"... any idea?
2011-08-09T17:14:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	You can select for example "Berlin".
2011-08-09T17:15:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	You need to select a representative entry for your time zone.
2011-08-09T17:17:00.000Z	sabya	bullgard4_	i can not. niether does the select work, nor can I type in that screen
2011-08-09T17:20:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	So something in the install process went seriously wrong. The only thing I can advise it to start the installation process anew.
2011-08-09T17:22:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	If the second install process stops unexpectedly again, then try to install Ubuntu a third time and now without a graphical user interface.
2011-08-09T17:22:00.000Z	sabya	bullgard4_	does not solve
2011-08-09T17:23:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	"does not solve" is no exact description. Thus I cannot help you.
2011-08-09T17:24:00.000Z	sabya	bullgard4_	sorry. I tried again and it stalls in the same screen everytime
2011-08-09T17:25:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	So try to install Ubuntu without installing a GUI.
2011-08-09T17:25:00.000Z	sabya	bullgard4_	was looking at these bug reports: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/772415
2011-08-09T17:27:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	That man wrote: "Today I tried again but this time DISCONECTING THE NETWORK, and voila!. It let me choose the right TimeZone and carry on with the installing process." You could try this also.
2011-08-09T17:28:00.000Z	sabya	bullgard4_	Yes. Let me try that. Have to reboot :-(
2011-08-09T17:28:00.000Z	bullgard4_	sabya	Yes.
