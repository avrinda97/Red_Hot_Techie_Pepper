2010-11-22T15:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	gconf. right click on the nm-applet choose edit connections
2010-11-22T15:59:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	How do I get to gconf ? (I'm rather new...)
2010-11-22T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	what are you trying to do?
2010-11-22T16:01:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	I'm upgrading and I have several connections like one fore home, another at Library etc... I want to carry over the file that stores the settings of all the connections
2010-11-22T16:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	maybe you can export/import with gconf-editor; or gconftool2.
2010-11-22T16:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	is not a plain file anymore. afaik gconf is a bunch of xml files
2010-11-22T16:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	should be ~/.gconf/system/networking/ and everything that is under it
2010-11-22T16:06:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	Umm, I'm using Jaunty and am upgrading to Maverick. Instead of re-typing the ip, dns stc for 6 different connection in my new install, i was wondering whether there was a file that had all this info stored..
2010-11-22T16:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	i just told you ;P
2010-11-22T16:09:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	Maybe I';m a li'l slow at this but here's the thing... Those 'connection-settings' are stored in my /home folder, right ?
2010-11-22T16:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	yes; ~ is your home folder
2010-11-22T16:10:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	I have / on another partition on which I'm installing Maverik. So I won't lose my net-settings, bookmarks etc ?
2010-11-22T16:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	so  /home/youruser/.gconf/system/networking/ if yu prefer
2010-11-22T16:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	you should not
2010-11-22T16:11:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	Not ?? what ?
2010-11-22T16:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Json	« So I won't lose my net-settings, bookmarks etc ? » No, you should not
2010-11-22T16:14:00.000Z	Json	erUSUL	Thank you very much !! I'm hoping I do not...
