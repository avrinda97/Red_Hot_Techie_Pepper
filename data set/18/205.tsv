2012-06-26T15:45:00.000Z	remontees		Hi !
2012-06-26T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	no
2012-06-26T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	proposed is for testers, may easily break
2012-06-26T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	PPA stability varies widely, since they're all made by different people
2012-06-26T15:48:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	the program version may be considered stable, but the package itself might break. you probably don't want to end up with a non-working APT
2012-06-26T15:49:00.000Z	remontees	LjL	it's sure : but it's so dangerous ????
2012-06-26T15:49:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	if it weren't dangerous, they wouldn't be in a separate repository for testers, don't you think?
2012-06-26T15:50:00.000Z	remontees	LjL	I want to use Debian Wheezy
2012-06-26T15:50:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	so remove them?
2012-06-26T15:51:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	you probably can. try, and before you hit "Yes", look at what else is going to be removed with them.
2012-06-26T15:52:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	apt-get will tell you what packages will be removed when you try to remove a package. if it says only xterm (for example) will be removed, it's ok, if it says many packages will be removed, it's not ok
2012-06-26T15:53:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	i've just tried removing xterm; it's fine, it only removes xterm.
2012-06-26T15:53:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	if it says: "The following packages will be REMOVED:  xterm" then it's good. if it says: "The following packages will be REMOVED:  xterm anotherpackage thirdpackage manymorepackages" it's not good
2012-06-26T15:54:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	xdiagnose is a program to help you if X stops working. you probably want to keep it.
2012-06-26T15:54:00.000Z	remontees	LjL	yes, but why this program is in the menu principal ?
2012-06-26T15:55:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	are you sure it doesn't just want you to install the KDE *libraries*?
2012-06-26T15:56:00.000Z	LjL	remontees	it's normal for KDE programs to need a whole lot of KDE libraries
