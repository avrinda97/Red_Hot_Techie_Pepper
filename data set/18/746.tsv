2011-10-14T10:13:00.000Z	Operaist2		how do i check ubuntu's available disk size if i installed with wubi?
2011-10-14T10:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	"df -h" from a terminal should work
2011-10-14T10:15:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	is it possible to increase the size allocated after i installed with wubi?
2011-10-14T10:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	i wouldn't touch wubi (or a wubi question) with a 30 foot pole.  Good luck.
2011-11-01T09:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	are you sure your 3D is still working?
2011-11-01T09:44:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	im not sure,
2011-11-01T09:45:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	how do i check?
2011-11-01T09:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	does "glxinfo | grep direct" report YES?
2011-11-01T09:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	what graphics card?  "lspci | grep -i vga" if you aren't sure.
2011-11-01T09:45:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	nvidia 7600gt
2011-11-01T09:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	open nvidia-settings what driver does it report using?  (i'm just interested if it's nvidia or not)
2011-11-01T09:47:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	command not found...
2011-11-01T09:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	install the nvidia driver then
2011-11-01T09:48:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	how? i cant find the additional driver program any more
2011-11-01T09:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	you'd have to ask someone using 11.10 then.  sorry i don't know.
2011-11-01T11:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	open nvidia-settings is one method
2011-11-01T11:08:00.000Z	Operaist2	zykotick9	there is no such thing as nvidia-settings for me
2011-11-01T11:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	Operaist2	then my guess is you don't have the proprietary nvidia driver installed (unless it's become a separate package)
