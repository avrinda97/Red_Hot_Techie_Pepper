2012-02-15T00:56:00.000Z	jimi_		When I ping places my times are OK, but the response is really slow, like 1 ping every 10 seconds. Also route command without -n is really slow. What should I investigate?
2012-02-15T00:57:00.000Z	Slor	jimi_	- nameserver config
2012-02-15T00:58:00.000Z	Slor		when route without -n is slow, it often means it can't get to your nameservers
2012-02-15T00:58:00.000Z	jimi_	Slor	Thanks, that sped up the ping by hostname. What about the route without -n /
2012-02-15T00:59:00.000Z	Slor		jim_ - that didn't speed up too?
2012-02-15T00:59:00.000Z	Slor	jimi_	- that didn't speed up too?
2012-02-15T00:59:00.000Z	jimi_	Slor	No, it takes FOREVER to list.
2012-02-15T01:00:00.000Z	Slor	jimi_	- ok - does your default route look correct in that listing?
2012-02-15T01:01:00.000Z	jimi_	Slor	it looks OK.
2012-02-15T01:02:00.000Z	Slor		do you have any names in your routing besides default and link-local;
2012-02-15T01:02:00.000Z	Slor	jimi_	do you have any names in your routing besides default and link-local?
2012-02-15T01:03:00.000Z	jimi_	Slor	here is my route: http://paste.ubuntu.com/842129/
2012-02-15T01:05:00.000Z	Slor	jimi_	- when you do it without -n, which line does it seem to lock up prior to?  and what name eventually shows up?
2012-02-15T01:05:00.000Z	Slor		Trying a repeat: I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 (yeah, still) with both eth0 and wlan0 network connections.  I would like to force outgoing traffic to use the wlan0 interface, which I know I can do if I manually update the routing table and manually update my resolv.conf so I can find the right nameservers.  What I would like to know is whether or not I can configure something to force NetworkManager
2012-02-15T01:05:00.000Z	Slor		to prefer the wlan0 interface over eth0 so that I don't have to do these manual steps.  Basically, I only need to get in (like from a VNC client) on the wired connection and anything I do within the box needs to be trying to go out on the wireless.
2012-02-15T01:05:00.000Z	jimi_	Slor	it locks up immediately
2012-02-15T01:08:00.000Z	Slor		Hmm - not real sure jimi_ - unless it's trying to do a reverse lookup for the name of your router and failing.  I'm afraid I'm at my limit on that one.
2012-02-15T01:08:00.000Z	jimi_	Slor	N/p thanks for the help :)
