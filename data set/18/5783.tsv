2008-11-04T15:08:00.000Z	spolvid		Ugh, I really don't know what I'm doing at all.
2008-11-04T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	wassup??
2008-11-04T15:09:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	Well, right now I've got two problems.
2008-11-04T15:11:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	Not to mention I can't seem to get the Installer to see my external drives, one of which I want to install onto.
2008-11-04T15:12:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	Unless I install straight from the splash screen without going into a live session.
2008-11-04T15:12:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	I don't have a flash drive.
2008-11-04T15:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	im not experiencedwith mac. i despise them
2008-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	Fair enough :)
2008-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	ActionParsnip1: Not to mention I can't seem to get the Installer to see my external drives,* one of which I want to install onto.*
2008-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	that guide is the same, usb storage is usb storage
2008-11-04T15:14:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	But I'm booting off of a CD and want to install to a Firewire drive.
2008-11-04T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	id imagine its something the same, can a macmini boot from firewire?
2008-11-04T15:15:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	Yes, but I still don't see how this is relevant.
2008-11-04T15:16:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	I'm booting off of a CD just fine and I want to install to a Firewire drive.
2008-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	just making sure your hardware can do what you expect
2008-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	spolvid	if the device shows up in sudo fdisk -l you should be able to install to it
2008-11-04T15:20:00.000Z	spolvid	ActionParsnip1	It shows up just fine in fdisk and gparted, but not the installer.
