2010-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	madalin		atheros works great on my asus also...
2010-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	madalin		on every ubuntu....since 8.04 to 10.04
2010-12-28T15:29:00.000Z	madalin		it's the other way around?
2010-12-28T15:29:00.000Z	madalin		or do you have to toggle it?
2010-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	madalin		mute then unmute it...
2010-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	madalin		with every playing device?not just the main?
2010-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	madalin		beats me :)
2010-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	madalin		try aplay with a wave file..
2010-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	madalin		if u don't know what "aplay" is..google it :)
2010-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	madalin		for those who don't know what aplay is: it's alsa's basic audio player.
2010-12-28T15:33:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	I dont hear anything
2010-12-28T15:33:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	I am not sure
2010-12-28T15:34:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	the mixer settings look the same as before (before everything worked)
2010-12-28T15:34:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	but the phonon settings look completely different
2010-12-28T15:35:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	I dont have a soundcard setting in bios?
2010-12-28T15:36:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	it has something to do with the upgrade
2010-12-28T15:40:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	yeah but phonon doesnt see the card, that's the _only_ thing that confirms that I dont hear anything
2010-12-28T15:41:00.000Z	g0th	madalin	so usually it is not a bad idea to start "debugging" from a place where something is wrong
