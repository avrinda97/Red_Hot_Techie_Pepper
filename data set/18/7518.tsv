2007-12-26T15:32:00.000Z	Amerio		Jayc: u need to format it 1st then see if u get the problem again
2007-12-26T15:32:00.000Z	Amerio		Jayc: new HDDs should be formatted before usage
2007-12-26T15:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	this is true, but showing the drive is less than half its actual size, is a bit absurd.
2007-12-26T15:33:00.000Z	Amerio	IndyGunFreak	I had that problem once , I re-formatted it and its gone but maybe he has a problem I dunno
2007-12-26T15:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	i don't see why he couldn't, i've got a 500gig external, on a PC 2.5yrs old, and it sees the whole drive.
2007-12-26T15:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	yes....

2007-12-26T15:47:00.000Z	Amerio	IndyGunFreak	whats ur HDD brand?
2008-01-02T00:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	splash doesn't work for me on any of my Gutsy boxes, it hink it might be a gutsy issue.
2008-01-02T00:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	what is?
2008-01-02T00:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	oh ok.. i've not really looked into it, because it doesn't bother me, but all my boxes, splash doesnt work, but it worked fine in feisty
2008-01-02T00:31:00.000Z	Amerio	IndyGunFreak	u just need to edit /etc/usplash.conf resolution exactly as your screen resolution
2008-01-02T00:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Amerio	hmm, still doesn't let me have splash.
2008-01-02T00:34:00.000Z	Amerio	IndyGunFreak	: try sudo usplash
