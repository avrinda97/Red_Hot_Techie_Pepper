2010-05-01T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	you use the « cd » command.  Be more specific about what you are trying to do.  Also, pastebin your (relevant) terminal session
2010-05-01T17:26:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	i'm trying to split a file that is in a folder within a folder within a folder within a folder
2010-05-01T17:27:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	and i cant paste my terminal session becuase im on my ipod touch
2010-05-01T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	all I can tell you is to use cd then.  It shouldn't be too hard to type the command you are using so we can tell you why it doesn't do what you want
2010-05-01T17:29:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	cd /media
2010-05-01T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	yes, that puts you in /media...
2010-05-01T17:30:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	then i try typing cd /D406F99B06F97EB4
2010-05-01T17:31:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	and it then says No such file or directory
2010-05-01T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	ok.  do you understand what an initial '/' represents?  That's the root of the partition, the top.  That's not what you want.  You are in /media and you want to go to the directory called "D406F99B06F97EB4" in it.  So you would just use the /relative/ path: « cd D406F99B06F97EB4 »
2010-05-01T17:34:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	what about folders that have names with spaces in them?
2010-05-01T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	surround the path in quotes: 'folder with spaces'
2010-05-01T17:35:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	thanks
2010-05-01T17:48:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	split -b 3 m gbandugly.mkv newmatroska
2010-05-01T17:48:00.000Z	Markyyy	jrib	it outputs "split: extra operabd 'gbandugly.mkv'
2010-05-01T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	did you see what Dr_Willis said?
2010-05-01T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	Markyyy	and now?
