2009-10-12T12:51:00.000Z	Komak57	BlueMirc	i have an ancient mirc somewhere
2009-10-12T12:51:00.000Z	BlueMirc	Komak57	-- well --- maybe a pin?

2009-10-12T12:52:00.000Z	BlueMirc		6.16
2009-10-12T12:52:00.000Z	Komak57		Bluemirc: the pin is some kind of copper/goldish mixture which is secured to the motherboard...
2009-10-12T12:52:00.000Z	Komak57		bluemirc: ive tried replacing it with another conductive material, but it doesnt seem to make a connection
2009-10-12T12:52:00.000Z	BlueMirc	Komak57	ouch....I am not a hardware guy -- maybe someone else?
2009-10-12T12:53:00.000Z	BlueMirc	Komak57	just a suggestion - wirewrap?
2009-10-12T12:54:00.000Z	BlueMirc		or find an unused pin and use that....
2009-10-12T12:54:00.000Z	BlueMirc		remove/resolder if possible
2009-10-12T12:54:00.000Z	Komak57		bluemirc: i guess i could destroy a pin from another HD (ive got a few crap spares)

2009-10-12T12:55:00.000Z	Komak57		bluemirc: dont think resoldering is possible
2009-10-12T12:55:00.000Z	BlueMirc		Komak57that would be something worth trying....
2009-10-12T12:55:00.000Z	BlueMirc	Komak57	that's something for sure I couldn't do....I have pretty hose fine motor control
