2006-12-09T15:34:00.000Z	grrr		okay so I tried a dual boot of ubuntu and windows xp just to try it out after a week or so i decided to remove ubuntu. i did this simply by formating the partition it was on from withen windows. but now when i restart, grub still tries to load but comes into an error and doesn't do anything. how can i get it back to just loading windows stright up? running off of live dvd right now
2006-12-09T15:35:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	if you have the original Windows XP cd it is very easy
2006-12-09T15:36:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	do you have two CD drives?
2006-12-09T15:36:00.000Z	grrr	marginoferror	yes
2006-12-09T15:41:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	Windows 2000 at one point supported the option to make a four-floppy install disk set
2006-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	 Well, yes
2006-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	 The best thing to do is set up grub to work its magic invisibly
2006-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	 Ideally that will be as good as fixmbr
2006-12-09T15:43:00.000Z	grrr	marginoferror	as long as you can get it to boot windows i can burn a xp disk from there
2006-12-09T15:43:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	Well, if you can boot windows then there is nothing more to fix =)
2006-12-09T15:44:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	you said you had two drives?  I don't understand.  Store the ISO file on your hard drive, which you should still be able to access from the live CD, and burn with the 2nd drive?
2006-12-09T15:44:00.000Z	grrr	marginoferror	my drive is ntfs i can't write to it
2006-12-09T15:44:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	there are ways around that, but I'm not sure if any of them work with the live cd.  Let me see.
2006-12-09T15:45:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	that is the only partition you have at all?  You completely wiped out your old ubuntu partition?
2006-12-09T15:46:00.000Z	grrr	marginoferror	one drive two partitoin, was three when i had ubuntu installed becuse of swap. decided i wanted the space in windows instead so loaded windows from grub then formatted the two partitoins ubuntu and the swap back to one. then restarted , grub tried to start gave me an error. reloaded with live cd
2006-12-09T15:47:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	I recommend you follow Flannel's advice above (ubotu gave you a link) - however, if you want
2006-12-09T15:48:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	you can use the live cd tools to re-reformat that empty partition to FAT32 and then put the ISO on there
2006-12-09T15:50:00.000Z	marginoferror	grrr	good luck.  My install is complete so I'm rebooting.  I am pretty sure either the above link from the bot will help you to fix grub, or reformatting that partition will allow you to burn a WinXP CD and fix it that way.
