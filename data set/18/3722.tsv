2011-04-15T09:06:00.000Z	worldwarcheese		Hello, I need help installing Ubuntu via usb onto my netbook. I have make a drive but everytime I try to install all I get is "keyboard unrecocgnized" and the "boot: " prompt which doesn't allow key entries
2011-04-15T09:08:00.000Z	izinucs	worldwarcheese	if the netbook has an arm processor then I think you need the arm version of ubuntu or the netbook remix/unity
2011-04-15T09:09:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	Hmm... I might, I'll double check
2011-04-15T09:14:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	I don't think my eee pc is an ARM machine and I am just using the direct download iso from ubuntu's netbook page
2011-04-15T09:15:00.000Z	izinucs	worldwarcheese	which model?
2011-04-15T09:15:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	1001he
2011-04-15T09:17:00.000Z	izinucs	worldwarcheese	is that a model bought outside of the US?
2011-04-15T09:17:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	nope. Got it at yer friendly local large compu-retail store
2011-04-15T09:18:00.000Z	izinucs	worldwarcheese	I got on asus's site to reference and didn't come up with anything.. but looks like [thor] says it's an Intel
2011-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	it has an intel atom processor and a newly installed intel SSD (originally had hitachi 160 gb drive)
2011-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	izinucs	worldwarcheese	just found that.. might be an issue with the ssd.. have you searched the ubuntuforums.org for others with the same problem?
2011-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	I'm kinda doing that now (I've been away from home all week)
2011-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	the only thing is the issues i'm getting seem to have to deal with the keyboard not the HD so i'm a little confused as to what to look for
2011-04-15T09:25:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	I just tried an install again to get the exact wording of the error. it says "Unknown keyword in configuration file" no it's nothing with the keyboard i guess
2011-04-15T09:25:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	then I get the "boot: " prompt again but it won't allow any entries
2011-04-15T09:25:00.000Z	izinucs	worldwarcheese	weird.. sorry I don't have any answers....
2011-04-15T09:27:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	haha no problem. at least now I can say it wasn't just me. but now the issue of trying to remake the boot drive is more important. if i can at least troubleshoot by trying on different usbs i'd feel better but none of my usbs seem to be accepting a boot file
2011-04-15T09:28:00.000Z	worldwarcheese	izinucs	I think i'll be able to make one work, but the problem is i have an old OSX boot on there and for the life of my can't remember how to get it off (it says read-only) which makes me feel all kinds of foolish
