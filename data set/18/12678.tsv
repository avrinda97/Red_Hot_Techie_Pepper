2007-01-08T11:45:00.000Z	pike_	BenFP	i would recommend an older nvidia card and saving your money over ati. most linux games older gen cards are fine for
2007-01-08T11:48:00.000Z	pike_	BenFP	there are some good games that are free though.  enemy terriory, tremulous, are both very good onlne fps games. savage2 all the ID games..
