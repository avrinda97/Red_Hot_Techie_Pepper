2008-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	ganes	Mighty_Penguin	i not installed the xen , i want the clear detail about it & to use
2008-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	Mighty_Penguin	ganes	i would suggest to look on the xen website
2008-03-03T15:29:00.000Z	ganes	Mighty_Penguin	in my pc kernel is 2.6.21 but the xen is available in 2.6.20 , will it create problem
2008-03-03T15:30:00.000Z	Mighty_Penguin	ganes	i do not know, but your kernel should support it if its higher than what xen supports
2008-03-03T15:31:00.000Z	ganes	Mighty_Penguin	ok thanks
2008-03-03T15:33:00.000Z	ganes	Mighty_Penguin	for xen ,whats the repository i have to choose
2008-03-03T15:36:00.000Z	Mighty_Penguin	ganes	i dont know much about xen i couldnt really tell you much, sorry i cant help

2008-03-03T15:39:00.000Z	Mighty_Penguin	ganes	i've heard that xen is hard to setup, if you want software that will run emulate a system, virtualbox is available in the repositories
