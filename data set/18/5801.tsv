2008-08-20T22:35:00.000Z	Av1	soundray	envy is good
2008-08-20T22:36:00.000Z	soundray	Av1	envy is unsupported and risky, so unless you are prepared to be in this channel around the clock to help people with it, don't recommend it here.
2008-08-20T22:36:00.000Z	Av1	soundray	what do you suggest
2008-08-20T22:37:00.000Z	soundray	Av1	see my reply to erlend, as well as ubottu's factoid ^^

2008-08-20T22:41:00.000Z	Av1	soundray	my graphics card stopped working
2008-08-20T22:41:00.000Z	soundray	Av1	keep it on one line please. For most graphics card, the binary NVidia driver that jockey-gtk provided is fine. If it didn't work for you and envy did, it still doesn't mean you should recommend envy here
2008-08-20T22:43:00.000Z	Av1	soundray	: my point is should i not use envy
2008-08-20T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	Av1	no, it hasn't done any harm in your case, so stick to what you have. You may have a problem, though, when you try to update your kernel or upgrade to a new Ubuntu release.
2008-08-20T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	Av1	but you can cross that bridge when you come to it.
2008-08-20T22:45:00.000Z	Av1	soundray	so what do you suggest to me
2008-08-20T22:45:00.000Z	Av1	soundray	should i remove it
2008-08-20T22:45:00.000Z	soundray	Av1	stick to what you have, if it's working.
