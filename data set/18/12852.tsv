2006-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	_tom		helllp.. i need to access my mp3s on an ntfs partition :(
2006-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	did you mount it yourself?
2006-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	no, it was already mounted
2006-03-01T09:22:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	open up /etc/fstab
2006-03-01T09:22:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	and i can see that it has stuff in it
2006-03-01T09:22:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	ok, i have fstab open..

2006-03-01T09:24:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	thank you.
2006-03-01T09:34:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	i get an error when i run the diskmounter script, it says "Ignoring /dev/sda2 - already in /etc/fstab" -- yet i still don't have permission to view that partition
2006-03-01T09:36:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	you just need to change the options in fstab as the wiki says to make it accessible to everyone.  then unmount and remount /dev/sda2
2006-03-01T09:37:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	or if you want to use the diskmounter script, just remove the /dev/sda2 line from fstab
2006-03-01T09:38:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	I don't have permission to edit fstab
2006-03-01T09:38:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	use sudo
2006-03-01T09:38:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	i.e. sudo <editor> /etc/fstab
2006-03-01T09:38:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	yes
2006-03-01T09:44:00.000Z	_tom	brenner	I got it! Thank you very much for your help!
2006-03-01T09:44:00.000Z	brenner	_tom	no worries
