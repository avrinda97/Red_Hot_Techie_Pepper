2006-03-07T09:56:00.000Z	jlhenry		Hi
2006-03-07T09:57:00.000Z	jlhenry		Does anyone knows the "tar" syntaxe for: "ssh remotehost ls | tar czf test.tgz" ?
2006-03-07T09:58:00.000Z	jlhenry		I tied this ""ssh remotehost ls | tar czf test.tgz" and ""ssh remotehost ls | tar czf test.tgz -" ... nothing works
2006-03-07T09:58:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	ssh luser@remotehost "the commands"
2006-03-07T09:58:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	the ssh is not an issue
2006-03-07T09:59:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	i do ssh login@host with ssh-key identification
2006-03-07T10:00:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	can you tel me further?
2006-03-07T10:00:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	that doesn't really matter ;-). What matters is that you have to protect the commands from shell expansion. Try with 'blh' instead of "blah"
2006-03-07T10:01:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	k but i do not see where i need to put protection
2006-03-07T10:02:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	try this ssh you@remotehost 'ls | tar czf test.tgz'
2006-03-07T10:03:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	no. I need to do a local tar file of the remote ls result
2006-03-07T10:04:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	that's differnet! Something like this: ssh remotehost 'cat ${TMPFILE}.tar' > local-${TMPFILE}.tar, right?
2006-03-07T10:06:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	tar czf, blush
2006-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	I resolv this with this: ssh remotehost '/usr/sbin/slapcat -l /tmp/openldap.ldiff && gzip -c /tmp/openldap.ldiff && rm /tmp/openldap.ldiff ' > test.tgz
2006-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	thanks
2006-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	that was a nice line ;-)
2006-03-07T10:22:00.000Z	jlhenry	dradul	tar was not possible i think
2006-03-07T10:23:00.000Z	dradul	jlhenry	I had a pebkac moment and added xargs in the example I suggested ;-)
