2007-02-26T08:58:00.000Z	hivemind		Excuse me, how can I search for a package that is installed on my system?
2007-02-26T08:59:00.000Z	hivemind		Er
2007-02-26T08:59:00.000Z	hivemind		Screw it, I'll use synaptic
2007-02-26T09:01:00.000Z	hivemind		:O
2007-02-26T09:01:00.000Z	hivemind		What is the ubuntu-desktop package do?
2007-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	hivemind		What does* the ubuntu-desktop package do?
2007-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	lufis	hivemind	it's a meta-package
2007-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	hivemind	lufis	meaning?
2007-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	hivemind	lufis	Is it safe to remove?
2007-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	lufis	hivemind	uh, no..
2007-02-26T09:03:00.000Z	lufis	hivemind	a meta-package isn't software itself, it lists software to install... when you install the meta package it installs whatever is specified in it. ubuntu-desktop is a bunch of software for the desktop
2007-02-26T09:04:00.000Z	hivemind	lufis	Well. I'm trying to remove the original bittorrent that came with ubuntu
2007-02-26T09:04:00.000Z	lufis	hivemind	oh, yeah, it's safe to uninstall if it's listed as a dependency
2007-02-26T09:05:00.000Z	hivemind	lufis	no, the strange thing is that it is not.
2007-02-26T09:05:00.000Z	lufis	hivemind	what?
2007-02-26T09:06:00.000Z	hivemind	lufis	Well. It's wants to remove ubuntu-desktop as well, for some reason..
2007-02-26T09:06:00.000Z	lufis	hivemind	yeah, because it's listed in ubuntu-desktop. don't worry about it
2007-02-26T09:07:00.000Z	hivemind	lufis	Ah! Thank you
