2006-10-24T11:44:00.000Z	St_MPA3b		What's better partitions map to install Ubuntu? (i have WIn in primary NTFS and a 120 Gb hd)
2006-10-24T11:44:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	make /home its own partition
2006-10-24T11:45:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	 is it all? mb /var also?
2006-10-24T11:45:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	 but if it'll be extendet partition. It'll be slower?
2006-10-24T11:47:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	hold on, let me find this article for you
2006-10-24T11:48:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	ty
2006-10-24T11:48:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	ok, well i couldnt find it again. but basically, if you have /home on its own partition, you can reinstall the whole OS, and not lose any of your personal files
2006-10-24T11:49:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	/var is nice to give its own partition if this is going to be some kind of server with a bunch of log files
2006-10-24T11:49:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	y, i understand. But there are also cinfigs on /var... I need to save em too. Extended partitions arent slower then primary?
2006-10-24T11:50:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	configs*
2006-10-24T11:50:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	yeah i think so, but i cant imagine by much
2006-10-24T11:51:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	if youre using something like gparted to do this, i think all the parittions you make will be "primary" ones
2006-10-24T11:53:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	so... look at that tree: 1) Win partition (NTFS, Primary) 2) root (reiserfs, primary) 3) swap (primary) 4) Extended (extended with /home and /var on it, both are reiser)
2006-10-24T11:53:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	it's ok?
2006-10-24T11:54:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	why are /home and /var extended? and no, you have to be root to partition your drives
2006-10-24T11:55:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	i mean 2 local discs on that extended partition- /var and /home
2006-10-24T11:56:00.000Z	St_MPA3b	dougsko	what's better - 3 primary + 1 extended, 3+1, or 2+2?
2006-10-24T11:57:00.000Z	dougsko	St_MPA3b	im not sure. id say do some googling, and dont be afraid to just go for it. you might mess things up once or twice, but youll learn a lot
