2008-09-27T04:01:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	xfce is very slim but still has much functions :)
2008-09-27T04:02:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	 wine isnt specified to any desktop :) you can run it in shell/terminal
2008-09-27T04:02:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	just install wine and then start an exe with    "wine yourapplication.exe"  :)
2008-09-27T04:03:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	but change into the dir where the exe is located to :)
2008-09-27T04:04:00.000Z	Ilja	spanther	doesnt need it a xserver?
2008-09-27T04:04:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	 sure it needs :-) but only if your  .exe file needs a gui :) if it runs in dos mode you dont need X to run ^^
2008-09-27T04:05:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	xfce needs X too but its the most slim and fast desktop environment
2008-09-27T04:07:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	hope i could help ya out ^^
2008-09-27T04:08:00.000Z	spanther	Ilja	yes it runs under xfce , kde and gnome just to tell you some :-)
