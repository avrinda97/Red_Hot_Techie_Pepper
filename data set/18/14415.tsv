2005-08-09T10:12:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	it IS a sound problem
2005-08-09T10:13:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	do this: in a terminal: killall esd
2005-08-09T10:14:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	I already tryed that, but it still dont work
2005-08-09T10:14:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	ok. it solved it for me though. skype hung at all outgoing calls.
2005-08-09T10:15:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	just double check a few things:
2005-08-09T10:16:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	yes...
2005-08-09T10:16:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	must start gnome first
2005-08-09T10:17:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	gnome -> system -> prefs -> Multimedia system selector: Default output sink = alsa
2005-08-09T10:18:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	gnome -> system -> prefs -> sound: remove the tick for "Enable sound server startup"
2005-08-09T10:20:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	did that, however when I tried to test the sound after selecting alsa I got an error message.. I will try to start skype again now
2005-08-09T10:21:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	I did a pkillall esd, and pkill skype to get it started again.. I will try it now
2005-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	what error did you get?
2005-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	damn you're good!! works like a charm! thanks
2005-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	jowi	asfra	magic man
2005-08-09T10:25:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	however now xmms cant play my mp3. Xmms tells me that my sound card isn't correctly configured.. is that a preferences thing in xmms or something I have to change in my soundcard settings?
2005-08-09T10:25:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	it also says that the correct output-plugin is chosen
2005-08-09T10:25:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	and that now other programs are blocking the soundcard
2005-08-09T10:27:00.000Z	asfra	jowi	fixed it in the preferences in xmms! thanks for the help!
