2005-02-27T06:48:00.000Z	Tirno		Hi, I had the possibly misguided idea to move to hoary and now my wireless doesn't want to talk to me
2005-02-27T06:49:00.000Z	Tirno		using network setting gui, I try to activate the wireless card and it promptly de-activates it again
2005-02-27T06:50:00.000Z	Nermal	Tirno	what does things like /var/log/messages show ?
2005-02-27T06:52:00.000Z	Tirno	Nermal	I have nothing recent in /var/log/messages
2005-02-27T06:54:00.000Z	Nermal	Tirno	sure..
