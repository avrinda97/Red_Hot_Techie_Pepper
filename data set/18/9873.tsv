2007-02-08T10:13:00.000Z	IcemanV9	DisgruntledUser	i don't know much about rtl8180, but is it up and running?

2007-02-08T10:15:00.000Z	DisgruntledUser	IcemanV9	plus its trying to connect to subnet 255.255.255.255 and mines 255.255.255.0
2007-02-08T10:16:00.000Z	IcemanV9	DisgruntledUser	ah. that's why it is not connecting to the Internet. hm.
2007-02-08T10:16:00.000Z	DisgruntledUser	IcemanV9	agreed.... i thought it would automagically go to the subnet 255.255.255.0 since thats the default for most routers

2007-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	IcemanV9	DisgruntledUser	your card should be working out of the box with edgy
2007-02-08T11:23:00.000Z	IcemanV9	DisgruntledUser	try to search ubuntuforums.org for rtl8180; there are plenty of posts on it.
