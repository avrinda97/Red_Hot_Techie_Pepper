2007-06-22T14:55:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		Samsung 40GB laptop drive
2007-06-22T14:55:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		mounted in a desktop
2007-06-22T14:55:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		yes, but 12 seconds for firefox and 20 for kaffeine?
2007-06-22T14:56:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		1GB PC3200
2007-06-22T14:57:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd		any other ideas wols_?
2007-06-22T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	run 'top' in a terminal to see if something is hogging the CPU
2007-06-22T14:59:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	if you exit firefox and start it again, does it come up quick?
2007-06-22T15:00:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	so the problem is in the IDE subsystem
2007-06-22T15:00:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	soundray	I guess so, but the harddrive seems to be fine?
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	what do you get from 'sudo hdparm -tT /dev/hda' (just the two rates)
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	soundray	751MB/s cached and 32,39MB/s buffered
2007-06-22T15:02:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	installing kaffeine here to compare startup time...
2007-06-22T15:03:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	sry, doesn't work (I'm probably missing KDE components). How long does oowriter take to start?
2007-06-22T15:07:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	soundray	approx 8 secs
2007-06-22T15:08:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	14 seconds here, my HD is almost the same as yours in terms of transfer rates. I think you'll have to live with it or get a faster disk...
2007-06-22T15:09:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	soundray	I'll see if the prelinking works/helps. I wouldn't mind having the most-used applications constantly in memory
2007-06-22T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	W3ird_N3rd	good idea, esp. considering you have a gig.
2007-06-22T15:10:00.000Z	W3ird_N3rd	soundray	yes that's what I was thinking. About 900MB or so of it is unused anyway.
