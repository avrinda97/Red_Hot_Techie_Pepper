2006-12-29T17:22:00.000Z	yodoc_		Which new blogger?
2006-12-29T17:23:00.000Z	yodoc_		Anyone know how to make Thunderbird send mail using an AOL imap account?
2006-12-29T17:23:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	the one that you need to have a google account, it is different from the previous... the current repos apps does not connect to ir...
2006-12-29T17:25:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	thanks anyway... you need some help? just in thunderbird?
2006-12-29T17:27:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	did you tried any other mail client? if you're using gnome you could try evolution, it's a great app... I dunno what you maybe is missconfiguring, but sometimes changing the app just works
2006-12-29T17:29:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	I never set up an imap account
2006-12-29T17:29:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	just right click in the #ubuntu and select close tab
2006-12-29T17:29:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	I can help you out, if you be a bit patiente
2006-12-29T17:30:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	my english is not very good
2006-12-29T17:30:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	gimme some time to search for info to give you the guideline
2006-12-29T17:31:00.000Z	yodoc_	gansinho	your English seems fine to me
2006-12-29T17:31:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	I misspell every time... =/
2006-12-29T17:33:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	first, do you know the forum? You will have loads of info there, most of the times you'll find someone with a problem pretty similar to yours... or even better, a how to
2006-12-29T17:36:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	ok, let's start from scratch, I'll use evolution because I know it better... open it
2006-12-29T17:38:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	did you set up the port correctly?
2006-12-29T17:38:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	double check it, should be 587
2006-12-29T17:44:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	sorry I have to go... check the port... you could have misstyped it or smthng like that... check even if you need some special secure connection settings to send messeges, gmail asks for it... maybe aol asks to and you're not sending mail because of that (eg. gmail asks for sssl encryption)
2006-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	gansinho	yodoc_	good luck, if I arrive at my girlfriends job late she kills me... sorry
