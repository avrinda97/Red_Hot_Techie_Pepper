2010-07-26T13:06:00.000Z	gour		i'm (arch)linux user and my neighbour is buying new laptop...asking which windoze to put on...i told him i'll give him free OS :-) now, he is mostly interested for internet etc. so i wonder if ubuntu netbook edition may be better option than the desktop one?
2010-07-26T13:06:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	give him what works for him; test several dists.  show him much.
2010-07-26T13:07:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	make up several live-dvd's
2010-07-26T13:07:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	so that he can spend a few hours with each without changing hd
2010-07-26T13:07:00.000Z	gour	SunTzu	i believe archlinux is too complicated for him...ubuntu looks like great option... the choice is between netbook & desktop edition?
2010-07-26T13:08:00.000Z	gour	SunTzu	i'm into dl-ing bunch of livedvds...
2010-07-26T13:08:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	i'm a Slacker, i duno from dist-jumping myself :)  give him choices and let him play
2010-07-26T13:08:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	k
2010-07-26T13:09:00.000Z	gour	SunTzu	ok
2010-07-26T13:09:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	that is the essence of LinuxTao :)
2010-07-26T13:09:00.000Z	gour	SunTzu	it's...but for total beginner, i consider ubuntu is good choice
2010-07-26T13:11:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	there's a (in)famous maxim i once read from a blogger years ago; ``when you learn Debian, Ubuntu, Knoppix, etal, etc, you learn the one you installed; when you Learn Slackware, you learn Linux.''
2010-07-26T13:11:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	it's BillGates' fault that beginners know almost nothing in-depth about computers
2010-07-26T13:13:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	Gates wanted a computer in every car and two in every bedroom; it doesnt help learning. :)
2010-07-26T13:13:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	slackware; 3min :) then a lifetime of learning.
2010-07-26T13:14:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	repeatedly reinstalling a dist is a good thing.  more practice
2010-07-26T13:15:00.000Z	gour	SunTzu	indeed...although i could just do LFS to do the full circle :-)
2010-07-26T13:15:00.000Z	SunTzu	gour	yay :)
