2009-03-04T09:33:00.000Z	marsh		anyone knows how to make a touchscreen POS work using ubuntu
2009-03-04T09:34:00.000Z	marsh		i just installed ubuntu and it doesn't repond
2009-03-04T09:34:00.000Z	marsh		yup POS hardware
2009-03-04T09:34:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	you need to set up touch screen. Hopefully you at least know the hardware
2009-03-04T09:38:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	touchscreen drivers are downloadable from manufacturers sites most likely
2009-03-04T09:38:00.000Z	marsh	ploom	yes but not on ubuntu
2009-03-04T09:38:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	even in ubuntu. good drivers have debian packages ready for downloading there
2009-03-04T09:39:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	usually there is no use from windows drivers on ubuntu (except certain parts of wireless drivers for example)
2009-03-04T09:43:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	fanless touch-screen systems in general are like lego. lsusb is result is generally more usful, when you know that the touchscreen is connected to usb. otherwise it has dedicated com serial port
2009-03-04T09:45:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	windows driver might help when you have operated the pos under windows and then remembered to look for the touch screen connection method (usb or serial) and/or model. hope it helps.
2009-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	marsh	ploom	where do you think can i find debian drivers for touchscreen?
2009-03-04T09:49:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	look for touch screen manufacturer. usually you will find drivers from their site. Otherwise you could contac the provider of the POS itself too
2009-03-04T09:50:00.000Z	marsh	ploom	they say they don't support linux they create for custom with a charge, i keep finding other solutions
2009-03-04T09:52:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	you just have to ask nice enough. in Taiwan for example they do not want to tell you the parts of their "lego" either, because once known anyone could make the same configuration on his/her own
2009-03-04T09:55:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	the alternative for asking is just to "reverse engineer" the pos. So that you open it and see from inside (as the last resort). Usually windows drivers are enough to reveal driver manufacturer, ang there you can find linux versions too (at least in  binary form, compiled against a certain version of kernel)
2009-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	marsh	ploom	i get you man, that gave me an idea, thanks a lot
2009-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	marsh	ploom	i'll see if can still find a driver and then try you're idea which for sure will work
2009-03-04T10:01:00.000Z	ploom	marsh	I am speaking from my own experience with devices from somewhere from Taiwan
