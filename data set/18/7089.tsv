2008-02-18T05:00:00.000Z	nameless		hi to all
2008-02-18T05:00:00.000Z	nameless		while i was installing ubuntu, the grub step gave me an error, how i can fix it ?
2008-02-18T05:00:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	describe the error, please.
2008-02-18T05:03:00.000Z	nameless	_Oz_	i've checked the cd for errors
2008-02-18T05:06:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	hit esc when grub loads and load your default gnome desktop
2008-02-18T05:06:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	then, edit grub/conf
2008-02-18T05:07:00.000Z	nameless	_Oz_	i've downloaded the daily build alternate iso
2008-02-18T05:07:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	follow the steps I described first
2008-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	nameless	_Oz_	i've hit recovery mode, now i've chrooted the partition
2008-02-18T05:12:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	what have you found?
2008-02-18T05:12:00.000Z	nameless	_Oz_	the whole ubuntu without grub
2008-02-18T05:13:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	it's not showing the windows partition at all?
2008-02-18T05:13:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	ok, my mistake.  So your problem is ONLY the grub error?
2008-02-18T05:14:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	okay, launch a terminal and type "locate grub"
2008-02-18T05:15:00.000Z	nameless	_Oz_	cannot open mlocate.db etc etc..
2008-02-18T05:15:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	really? That's strange.
2008-02-18T05:15:00.000Z	nameless	_Oz_	it's in /boot/grub
2008-02-18T05:15:00.000Z	_Oz_	nameless	that's what I though
