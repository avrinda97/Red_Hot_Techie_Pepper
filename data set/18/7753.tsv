2007-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	JPSman		How do I install a linux driver?
2007-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	JPSman		anyone?
2007-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	you don't, if you mean install a driver the windows way
2007-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- no, I mean the linux way
2007-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	hardware support is part of the kernel you're running- all known drivers are built and 'installed' by default..
2007-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- do drivers just get put into directories?
2007-11-20T13:18:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	the trick is having hardware that is recognized and supported by a driver that already exists :)
2007-11-20T13:19:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- translation-buy a new soundcard ?
2007-11-20T13:20:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	which soundcard do you have? ideally, what's reported by lspci
2007-11-20T13:20:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- Creative Labs SB X-Fi
2007-11-20T13:20:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	bigger ouch :(
2007-11-20T13:21:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- so translation-buy a new soundcard ?  :O(
2007-11-20T13:21:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	that's the easy way out; doing a quick google suggests there's a creative driver, but I'm not too sure that's going to be any good
2007-11-20T13:22:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	not necessarily... you can build kernel modules (hardware 'drivers') without recompiling the whole thing, but it's not a task for the unseasoned veteran :)
2007-11-20T13:22:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- well I got one from http://opensource.creative.com/soundcard.html
2007-11-20T13:23:00.000Z	JPSman	troxor	- I just dont know how to "install it"
2007-11-20T13:25:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	hmm.. one sec
2007-11-20T13:28:00.000Z	troxor	JPSman	did you check the gentoo forum thread here? --> http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-587921-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-0.html
