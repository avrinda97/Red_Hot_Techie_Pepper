2006-03-25T08:27:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	and know what you're doing before you do it
2006-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	mp3 support in linux is limited due to patent and copyright restrictions
2006-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	this is a big disadvantage of linux, because everybody uses mp3
2006-03-25T08:35:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	convert them to ogg and then they work on every system.  free formats are where its at
2006-03-25T08:35:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	might be worth a look.
2006-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	but why to convert it? When in order to play for example on an mp3 player you need mp3 format. Anyway I would have to convert all songs. That is a waste of time
2006-03-25T08:37:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	some people choose to support certain players or certain formats not because they are convenient, but due to the morality involved
2006-03-25T08:37:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	but you have a right to take it or leave it.  If you don't live in the US then pretty much mp3 support in linux is complete.
2006-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	it's only for the US where it's illegal (and possibly some places in europe)
2006-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	I am from europe
2006-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	romania :)
2006-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	europe = freedom
2006-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	:)))))))))
2006-03-25T08:39:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	then you can probably use the restricted formats perfectly legally
2006-03-25T08:41:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	see the following to get mp3 support up and running:
2006-03-25T08:41:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	na7e	thanks
2006-03-25T08:41:00.000Z	na7e	C-O-L-T	no problem, consider yourself lucky to live where you do, i suppose :)
