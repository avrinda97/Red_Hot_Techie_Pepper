2005-09-03T10:10:00.000Z	konra`		I'm having some problems with the ubuntu setup - on the username/password stage, I enter the full name, username, and password (twice), and then it goes back to "enter the fullname" again

2005-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	konra`	bob2	no, default install
2005-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	konra`	bob2	the one where you press "ENTER" on boot
2005-09-03T10:19:00.000Z	konra`	bob2	does it help that it was complaining about not being able to add a password because the username did not exist?
2005-09-03T10:20:00.000Z	bob2	konra`	are yo usure your cd isn't broken?

2005-09-03T10:44:00.000Z	konra`	bob2	the username/password step is not working
