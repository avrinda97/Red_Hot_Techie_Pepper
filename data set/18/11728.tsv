2006-10-28T09:22:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME		ok, so, I buggered my xorg.conf to the point where now, when I rebootk, I get an ugly weird error screen that goes nowhere. Im booting from a live cd. How can I restore a backup that I have so I can continue to mess with ubuntu?
2006-10-28T09:24:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME		lool
2006-10-28T09:24:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME		does anyone know know how I might restore an xorg.conf file that I have backed up while using a live cd?
2006-10-28T09:25:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME		or some other means
2006-10-28T09:25:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	you would need to mount the drive, and then replace it
2006-10-28T09:27:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	why are you replacing it with the live cd. Why don't you replace it in the command prompt so you won't have to mount and such
2006-10-28T09:28:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	bruenig	could you explain more?
2006-10-28T09:29:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	can you boot into the console (the black and white command prompt)?
2006-10-28T09:30:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	bruenig	after the error message, it drops me to a test line, but it's not the console. How can I boot do the console?
2006-10-28T09:30:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	are you in the live cd?
2006-10-28T09:32:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	ok, what is the partition that your xorg.conf is on?
2006-10-28T09:32:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	bruenig	hda1 I believe, not 100%
2006-10-28T09:33:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	open up a terminal and make the mount directory "mkdir bruenig" then mount your drive "sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 ~/bruenig"
2006-10-28T09:35:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	bruenig	ty, copying backup now.see you soon :) to mess it up all over again, bt, now I know how to do this so cool!
2006-10-28T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	alright good thing
2006-10-28T09:44:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	bruenig	I tried save the xorg.conf, and it says it can't, becuase its a read only file. Any idea on a fix for this?
2006-10-28T09:45:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	do it from the command prompt and use sudo
2006-10-28T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	AkumAPRIME	do sudo gedit ~/brueng/etc/X11/xorg.conf
