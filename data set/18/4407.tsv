2009-05-14T18:08:00.000Z	alienkid10		no
2009-05-14T18:08:00.000Z	alienkid10		the title of the window header/tab
2009-05-14T18:08:00.000Z	alienkid10		ah
2009-05-14T18:08:00.000Z	alienkid10		does anyone know how to via scripting(python or just from the terminal) to change the title of the terminal tab/header display name
2009-05-14T18:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 from a xterminal? thats done via escape codes
2009-05-14T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 google for 'change xterm title' -> first hit.. shoiws it un several languages.. including python
2010-07-02T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 You may of wanted to tell it sdb  not sdb2  Unless you REALLY know why you would use sdb2
2010-07-02T19:01:00.000Z	alienkid10	Dr_Willis	tried both
2010-07-02T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 I keep windowws on sda, and linux on sdb. so i always tell insstaller to put it on 'sdb' and i do have the bios default to boot sdb
2010-07-02T19:02:00.000Z	alienkid10	Dr_Willis	that's where we differ
2010-07-02T19:05:00.000Z	alienkid10	Dr_Willis	I have non-techy people in the house
2010-10-22T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 just 'wine' has no menu items.
2010-10-22T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 open a terminal type 'wine' see if it says somthing
2010-10-22T16:50:00.000Z	alienkid10	Dr_Willis	there's no menu called WINE and it's not in edit menus. Yes it acts installed
2010-10-22T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 thats how wine works...
2010-10-22T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 if you instll somthing with wine.. it should an an icon for hte windows app to the menus.
2010-10-22T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 so its working as normal sounds like to me.
2010-10-22T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	alienkid10	 no idea.  I rarely worry about it. :) plus theres the PPA versions of wine that can differ from each other.
