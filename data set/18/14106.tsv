2009-01-10T12:24:00.000Z	onefiftyone_rum		up[grade one step at a time??
2009-01-10T12:24:00.000Z	onefiftyone_rum		could you please elaborate that for me?
2009-01-10T12:24:00.000Z	onefiftyone_rum		hmm
2009-01-10T12:25:00.000Z	onefiftyone_rum		well every time i try installing 8.10 it doesnt load up
2009-01-10T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	you'd upgrade from 5.10 to 6.06, then from 6.06 to 8.04
2009-01-10T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	6.06 to 8.04 will go off without a hitch, 5.10 to 6.06 may require some light massaging.
2009-01-10T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	Its not the end of the world, its actually relatively easy.  And please, watch your language.
2009-01-10T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	To do it, your best bet is to go the manual route; you need to first upgrade to "uptodate" 5.10.  You can get those repos by moving you stuff to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-01-10T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	once you've done that (and rebooted to get the new kernel), make sure you have your appropriate metapackages: ubuntu-standard, ubuntu-minimal, ubuntu-desktop (or kubuntu, whatever), and a proper kernel metapackage (linux-image-686-smp would be one example)
2009-01-10T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	Then once you've made sure you've got that, move your sources from breezy to dapper, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.  Once it's done, reboot, you're on dapper.  You can then use the instructions on the page ubottu is going to give you to go from 6.06 to 8.04 (and I suggest sticking with 8.04, LTS releases seem like they agree with your schedule)
2009-01-10T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	You need to use sudo
2009-01-10T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	If you're just starting out, I strongly suggest you upgrade to a newer version.  8.04 is ... a long way from even 6.06 (which was a large improvement over 5.10)
2009-01-10T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	As a regular user you can't do any system level tasks, no.  That's a security feature.
2009-01-10T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	Alright, lets upgrade you to at least 6.06 then.  Did you check the integrity of the 8.10 CD? or 8.04?
2009-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	Alright, still have my instructions from earlier?
2009-01-10T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	Ok, so, to move over to old-releases, you'll need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list, since its a system file, we'll have to use sudo.  hit alt-f2 to open a run dialog, then type `gksu "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"` (without the ``, but with the "") hit enter, you'll get a text editor (after typing your password)
2009-01-10T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	onefiftyone_rum	In there, change all of the URLs (likely something like http://cc.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
