2007-07-12T10:56:00.000Z	oxeimon3	Jaymac	System>Advanced>restricted driver manager...how do I get there?
2007-07-12T10:56:00.000Z	Jaymac	oxeimon3	are you on KDE or GNOME?
2007-07-12T10:57:00.000Z	oxeimon3	Jaymac	I dont know. It's whatever ubuntu 7.04's default is
2007-07-12T10:57:00.000Z	Jaymac	oxeimon3	do you have a bar at the top of your screen with Applications | Places | System?
2007-07-12T10:58:00.000Z	Jaymac	oxeimon3	click on System, then Administration
2007-07-12T10:59:00.000Z	oxeimon3	Jaymac	there is only 1 driver in the list, which iss an ATI accelerated graphics driver
2007-07-12T10:59:00.000Z	oxeimon3	Jaymac	the checkbox is unchecked, and in Status, there is a red circle saying, Not in use
2007-07-12T11:00:00.000Z	Jaymac	oxeimon3	that will give you proprietary ATI graphics drivers
2007-07-12T11:00:00.000Z	oxeimon3	Jaymac	even after I click on it and say "enable driver", the checkbox remains unchecked
