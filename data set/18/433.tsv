2012-02-19T23:28:00.000Z	adorablelunatic		okay ive got a problem here, i have an ubuntu based distribution 7.0.4 - jaunty i think and i cannot apt-get dist-upgrade because the ubuntu sources.list for that distribution is no longer valid, ive had to resort to using oldreleases
2012-02-19T23:29:00.000Z	iceroot	adorablelunatic	you should upgrade to a supported version (see text from ubottu about eol-upgrades)
2012-02-19T23:29:00.000Z	iceroot	adorablelunatic	ah, ubuntu-based. not supported here
2012-02-19T23:30:00.000Z	iceroot	adorablelunatic	then use a distribution with support :)
2012-02-19T23:31:00.000Z	adorablelunatic	iceroot	there is no other distribution apart from the semi dead colinux that allows you to run linux alongside windows kernel, the only diffrence is modification on a few scripts and the kernel .. the rest is ubuntu core

2012-02-19T23:32:00.000Z	iceroot	adorablelunatic	windows kernel on linux?
