2005-02-26T16:16:00.000Z	eliasson		i*
2005-02-26T16:16:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	what it is trying to install, exactly?
2005-02-26T16:16:00.000Z	eliasson	mjt	xfree.
2005-02-26T16:17:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	does it want to install alot of packages, or just one?
2005-02-26T16:17:00.000Z	eliasson	mjt	it downloads everyting and stops at 'Preconfiguring packages...'.
2005-02-26T16:17:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	but it downloaded ONE package or MANY?
2005-02-26T16:18:00.000Z	eliasson	mjt	many i think.
2005-02-26T16:18:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	do you use synaptic for install?
2005-02-26T16:19:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	so, as it is failing somewhere, try to install packages it wanted to install one-by one, and find which one fails.  Somewhat.. boring stuff but at least you will know where the problem is, and can debug from that point.
2005-02-26T16:21:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	it should print a list of all pkgs it wants to install. so try some libs first, when some other things etc...
2005-02-26T16:22:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	since it is failing somewhere, and xserver is a "part" of ubuntu-desktop, it may fail too. or may not fail, as we don't yet know why it is failing...
2005-02-26T16:47:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	there are several ways to debug the prob, but they're quite.. complicated
2005-02-26T16:50:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	re "compiling from scratch": it's some packaging scripts (provided by ubuntu) which fails
2005-02-27T17:05:00.000Z	mjt	eliasson	there's none because hoary isn't released yet
2005-02-27T17:06:00.000Z	eliasson	mjt	oh :/
