2008-03-27T23:50:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	xfce won't work with only 48MB ram
2008-03-27T23:50:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	icewm MAYBE.
2008-03-27T23:50:00.000Z	amedx	ryan-c	tks
2008-03-27T23:50:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	or rat poison
2008-03-27T23:50:00.000Z	ryan-c		but only crazy people use rat poison
2008-03-27T23:51:00.000Z	amedx	ryan-c	i'm crazy
2008-03-27T23:51:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	blackbox also is an option.
2008-03-27T23:51:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	then try rat poison
2008-03-27T23:51:00.000Z	ryan-c		I don't think anything uses less memory :P
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	amedx	ryan-c	rat poison or use console? mmm i don't know
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	ryan-c		good luck getting a web browser to run on that though.
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	I said icewm or blackbox will probably work.
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	amedx	ryan-c	i try
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	but for example, firefox will just kill your system
2008-03-27T23:53:00.000Z	amedx	ryan-c	firefox? why?
2008-03-27T23:53:00.000Z	ryan-c	amedx	Firefox uses a lot of memory
2008-03-27T23:54:00.000Z	amedx	ryan-c	ok :) tks 4 all
