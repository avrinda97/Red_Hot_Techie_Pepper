2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	actually no thats wrong
2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	it just means you didn't do your homework and you bought an unsupported printer
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	burzum	holycow	i had the printer before ubuntu, i dont buy a new PC for an OS, specialy if 2 other OS already support it (win, macOS)
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	exactly thats your fault
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	burzum	holycow	cant you read? i had the printer already BEFORE linux
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	even
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	we don't care, we don't work for free just so that you can come in here and complain for not doing your homework
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	you are always welcome to pay ms, apple or a developer to write a driver for you
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	burzum	holycow	ok, now im sure you cant read... ive told you theres a driver, but installing it is a pain and its not working
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	what you should of done is researched supported hardware, noticed that your printer isn't supported and stayed on windows
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	actually no, if it takes more than a few clicks it really isn't supported
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	there might be some partial support somewhere but it either works or it doesn't
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	burzum	holycow	im running still both systems because photoshop does not run as good as i want it with wine
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	not giving you a hard time, it really is that way
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	sure nothing wrong with using windows or mac
2007-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	burzum	holycow	hehe, theres something wrong with windows :p but theres atm no way around it for me :(
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	holycow	burzum	i should appologize, POVaddct is right.  maybe your hardware isn't supported 'just yet'
2007-04-17T12:09:00.000Z	burzum	holycow	na, that was not the point anyways ;) but im afk now
