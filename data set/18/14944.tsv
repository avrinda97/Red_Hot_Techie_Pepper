2005-05-23T15:30:00.000Z	livinded		its setup for alsa

2005-05-23T15:33:00.000Z	livinded		well for starters i set a root password
2005-05-23T15:33:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	Why?
2005-05-23T15:34:00.000Z	livinded	knapjack	ever heard of an exploit
2005-05-23T15:34:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	Yep, but having a root password isn't going to help that any.
2005-05-23T15:36:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	Giving root a password just means that it's able to be cracked as well as exploited.
2005-05-23T15:40:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	Not as long as you think
2005-05-23T15:40:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	'apt-get install john' from universe
2005-05-23T15:44:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	You could always use QEMU and let your friends ssh into that.
2005-05-23T15:45:00.000Z	knapjack	livinded	Protect yourself just a hair.
