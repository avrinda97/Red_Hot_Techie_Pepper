2008-06-30T03:53:00.000Z	perlsyntax		it so easy to setup a printer  on this type of linux.
2008-06-30T03:53:00.000Z	perlsyntax		:)
2008-06-30T03:54:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	depends on your printer really, it's plug-and-play for the common models
2008-06-30T03:55:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	sounds like something that would work with relative easy setup
2008-07-02T09:27:00.000Z	perlsyntax	unop	here the other link http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/perl-support-prob-on-ubuntu-652794/?highlight=perl-support
2008-07-02T09:33:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	have you got the vim-full package installed?
2008-07-02T09:34:00.000Z	perlsyntax	unop	what the bim-full package
2008-07-02T09:38:00.000Z	perlsyntax	unop	i don't think so
2008-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	ok, these are the packages i have - needed to run gvim properly and support perl-support   sudo aptitude install vim-gnome vim-runtime vim-gui-common vim-common vim-full
2008-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	patience, i can only type as fast as my two fingers allow
2008-07-02T09:42:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	also, i suspect your perl installation needs reinstalling .. so i would run this command.    sudo aptitude reinstall perl perl-base; sudo cpan CPAN::Bundle
2008-07-02T09:45:00.000Z	perlsyntax	unop	i still get the error
2008-07-02T09:46:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	man, how are you getting this damn error? tell me exactly how or find someone else to help you - please
2008-07-04T23:06:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	any errors?
2008-07-04T23:07:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	put the output of your cpan command on a pastebin
2008-07-04T23:10:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	why don't you paste _all_ the output you have there -- it makes it easier to understand what this error means
2008-07-06T02:28:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	pcap (or libpcap) is the library - you probably need something like wireshark or pcaputils to actually interface with the library
2008-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	unop	perlsyntax	though, you should do  sudo -i  instead of  sudo bash
