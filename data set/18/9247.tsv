2007-06-10T09:15:00.000Z	akahige		I'm in the feisty installer trying to partition a drive and after setting up 4 partitions, it's telling me the rest of my space is "unusable". I'm confused...
2007-06-10T09:16:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	unusable or unallocated ?
2007-06-10T09:17:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	I beleive there is a 4 primary partiton limit,  you need to make 3 primary and make the other ones logical
2007-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	akahige	Pelo	I think I read that somewhere, too, but it's not giving me the option to add logical partitions in that other space, and it's also not letting me go back and edit the types of the other partitions
2007-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	 delete one of the other partitons,   and you will need to make an extended partiton for the rest of the space and put your logical partions in the extended one
2007-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	akahige	Pelo	okay. does it matter which partitions are primary and which are extended?
2007-06-10T09:20:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	I think you would do well to hvae the primary partitions first on the extended one the last
2007-06-10T09:21:00.000Z	akahige	Pelo	right. but what I meant was "Is it important what I mount as primary, vs. extended?" sorry for the confusion.
2007-06-10T09:21:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	I donT' think so
2007-06-10T09:22:00.000Z	akahige	Pelo	thanks!
2007-06-10T09:29:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	make sure the start and end values you are setting are in the right order
2007-06-10T09:31:00.000Z	akahige	Pelo	not following you. I set this partition up the way I did all the others. Does this have something to do with the location being "beginning" or "end"? (because I don't know what that means...)
2007-06-10T09:32:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	 whn you make your new partiton, in the dialog box there are fields for  starting sector and ending sector,  ( they might be called differently) ,make sure the start one is lower then the end one
2007-06-10T09:32:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	that is the best thing I can do for you, I think I recall someone mentionning that there was a bug in there somewhere, with a lot of partition,  try applying your previous changes before making your last partition
2007-06-10T09:33:00.000Z	akahige	Pelo	I've got nothing like that in the feisty partitioner. Just size in megs, location: beginning or end, fs type, and mount point.
2007-06-10T09:33:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	beginning and end would the the starting sector and finishing sector
2007-06-10T09:34:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	 forget that partittion for now, and apply the other ones,  then come back and make the last one
2007-06-10T09:35:00.000Z	Pelo	akahige	sure do that
