2006-07-15T14:14:00.000Z	joffle		can anyone help with getting my network card working?  i can't get online at all in ubuntu.  the card is a via rhine ii.
2006-07-15T14:15:00.000Z	papo	joffle	does the card appear in ifconfig -a ?
2006-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	joffle	papo	yes, i think so.  it shows up in the network settings as well as eth0, but no connection.
2006-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	papo	joffle	do the LEDs on the NIC glow or blink?
2006-07-15T14:17:00.000Z	joffle	papo	hmm...it's in a laptop, no LEDs.  the card worked on the breezy livecd, and works now in windows.
2006-07-15T14:18:00.000Z	papo	joffle	Hm ok... can you manually configure an IP address?
2006-07-15T14:20:00.000Z	joffle	papo	i'm afraid i don't know how.  another problem is i've only got this one computer, so trying anything will require rebooting. :|
2006-07-15T14:20:00.000Z	papo	joffle	Uhm that's not very comfortable to debug :(
2006-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	joffle		yeah...i agree..
2006-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	papo	joffle	for the how: open a terminal, run sudo su and then ifconfig <iface> <ip>
2006-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	papo	joffle	iface is eth0 or whatever interface your NIC is, and IP is a free IP
2006-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	papo	joffle	And then you can try to ping your default gw. with 'ping <defaultgwip>
2006-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	papo		'
2006-07-15T14:23:00.000Z	papo	joffle	do you know your default GW's IP?
2006-07-15T14:25:00.000Z	joffle	papo	i think it's 192.168.1.1
2006-07-15T14:26:00.000Z	papo	joffle	you'd better make sure it is, because if it's not you won't get any ping replys anyway
2006-07-15T14:27:00.000Z	joffle	papo	alright.  many thanks...i think i'll write this down and try it out, but then i'd better try to get on irc from another computer.
2006-07-15T14:27:00.000Z	papo	joffle	ok, good luck
