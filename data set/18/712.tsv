2011-10-15T06:55:00.000Z	nvz		or that
2011-10-15T06:55:00.000Z	nvz		heh
2011-10-15T06:56:00.000Z	nvz		nautilus and gnome-panel are horribly broken in 11.04 so anyone who says gnome without unity works in 11.10 is lying.. heh
2011-10-15T06:57:00.000Z	nvz		gnome panel is 100% unconfigurable and nautilus ignores most gconf settings.. its premature and not fit for use
2011-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	nvz		works well enough to power unity, if you dont want to use that, dont use 11.10 or use something else like xfce
2011-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	hopstafarian	nvz	agreed..so thought on a continuous release cycle?
2011-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	I think its kinda ridiculous.. but I've been a debian user for 12 years or more.. and I believe that stability is more important than version numbers
2011-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	hopstafarian	nvz	i think so too, and that's why i wonder what you think about removing the  pressure of deadlines, and making sure that the incentive is towards getting it right the first time?
2011-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	I think thats the way to go.. but debian does that already.. debian and ubuntu are two differen beasts
2011-10-15T07:01:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	I can't deny ubuntu is doing really nice things.. in fact I've started using it for people I convert from windows rather than debian.. but I now know that you cant just upgrade.. heh.. cause they release stuff that still has critical bugs
2011-10-15T07:03:00.000Z	hopstafarian	nvz	that's why my work machine still runs on maverick...rather be behind the curve than unstable...
2011-10-15T07:14:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	I don't believe in updates without careful consideration in any case.. if it ain't broke don't fix it.. thats why I love debian and variants.. the software allows you to check changelogs, bug reports..etc easily before changing anything.
2011-10-15T07:15:00.000Z	hopstafarian	nvz	spoken like an experienced system administrator...sucks when stuff goes wrong and you have to scramble..
2011-10-15T07:15:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	to be honest after spending some time in this channel, I am thinking though I wanted to I cannot offer ubuntu support on a regular basis.. they're just insane.
2011-10-15T07:16:00.000Z	hopstafarian	nvz	been there, and honestly, was usually my fault...extra relaxing...good times
2011-10-15T07:17:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	this distro is far too large to be on a 6mo release cycle.. thats just headaches I dont need.. cause people who dont know better click that upgrade that comes up or download the latest thing ubuntu.com is pushing.. and they just did a major release version upgrade of a de that is made up of over 500packages which is a huge chunk of its default system usage in 6mo and are pushing it like its stable.. and that to me is pure insan
2011-10-15T07:17:00.000Z	hopstafarian	nvz	a lot of insane people have made valid contributions, though...cause they don't give a thought to failure...they just jump off that cliff...cause, err, honey badger don't give a..
2011-10-15T07:19:00.000Z	nvz	hopstafarian	people who are shrewed and educated on issues such as upgrades and know how to deal with bugs, reporting, resolving them..etc.. they can do that.. but the kinds of people that deploy ubuntu on desktops.. haha.. theyre just not ready to assume stuff they get when they hit that button is gonna work.. cause it simply cant..
