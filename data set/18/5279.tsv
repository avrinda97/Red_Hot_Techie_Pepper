2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	Firztspawn		hi, how can I remove an icoon from within my workgroup (network)
2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	Firztspawn		I try to do it manually and it says "Access Denied"
2009-02-28T01:01:00.000Z	oskar-	Firztspawn	a smb file sharing workgroup?
2009-02-28T01:01:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	no
2009-02-28T01:02:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	a user managed to get into my workgroup wirelessly (before I secured the connection)
2009-02-28T01:02:00.000Z	oskar-	Firztspawn	what kind of workgroup is it?
2009-02-28T01:03:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	I am asking on behalf of, I think its just an ordinary workgroup
2009-02-28T01:03:00.000Z	oskar-	Firztspawn	how do you list the workgroup "icons"?
2009-02-28T01:05:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	unsure sorry, I am asking on behalf of, and this guy is not too sure either, he just set it up
2009-02-28T01:05:00.000Z	Firztspawn		I am not local to his setup either
2009-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	can he just open Nautilus with root permissions and delete it that way?
2009-02-28T01:07:00.000Z	oskar-	Firztspawn	workgroup is afaik a M$ term for a group in the smb file and printer sharing service. he should find out the master browser of the group and restart it. but if the intruder is no more on the network, his icon in the workgroup is only a cosmetic problem
2009-02-28T01:07:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	yeah, but its that cosmetic problem that he wants to get rid of
2009-02-28T01:08:00.000Z	oskar-	Firztspawn	then he should restart all computers in the network to be sure, the master browser also got restarted  ;)
2009-02-28T01:10:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	so on reboot, the master browser will search the network for all connected computers/nodes, and ONLY show the connected computers/nodes?
2009-02-28T01:10:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	Im not 100% sure how Ubuntu does things, hence being here
2009-02-28T01:12:00.000Z	oskar-	Firztspawn	after that a master browser will be elected and then collect the advertisements, afaik
2009-02-28T01:15:00.000Z	Firztspawn	oskar-	ok, will tell him to try a reboot
