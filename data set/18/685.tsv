2011-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	locsmif_		Hello all. Any issues known with RTL 8168/8111 ?
2011-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	locsmif_		I have Ethernet data frame errors under Ubuntu but not under Windows 7
2011-10-24T23:38:00.000Z	locsmif_		ifconfig shows lots of ' drops'  for TX, in fact, identical to TX
2011-10-24T23:38:00.000Z	locsmif_		E.g. as much drops as TX packets received. In practive, my eth0 performance in Ubuntu is half that of Windows 7
2011-10-24T23:39:00.000Z	locsmif_		was a fresh install, I haven't done anything of importance to it yet
2011-10-24T23:39:00.000Z	locsmif_		Only thing I did was upgrade
2011-10-24T23:39:00.000Z	locsmif_		I did check iptables -L -v -n
2011-10-24T23:39:00.000Z	locsmif_		There were no rules defined
2011-10-24T23:40:00.000Z	locsmif_		Fever:
