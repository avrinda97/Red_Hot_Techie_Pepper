2005-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	its  ok to use just dont expect to be able to put just any old program on there. nor is some hardware supported because manufacturers are horrible idiots that dont care about users
2005-12-11T09:41:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	U-B-U-N-T-U >:D
2005-12-11T09:42:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	it is not an emulator
2005-12-11T09:42:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	it uses the windows libraries but does not slow down because there is no OS-on-OS barrier
2005-12-11T09:43:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	wine can even be faster on ubuntu than on windows itself!
2005-12-11T09:45:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	not -all- games ever created in the history of windows work yet (wine is a work in progress) but if you have a problem just set aside a partition for windows and use that for games!
2005-12-11T09:45:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	same performance
2005-12-11T09:49:00.000Z	sonare	matatata	only if you install stuff from the internet using windows.
