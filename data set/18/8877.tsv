2010-10-19T19:20:00.000Z	joe85		the 1.5 JDK is not available
2010-10-19T19:20:00.000Z	joe85		I can only get 1.6, which will not work for my purposes.
2010-10-19T19:21:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	indeed it is not
2010-10-19T19:21:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	missed that sorry
2010-10-19T19:22:00.000Z	joe85	defrysk	I downloaded the BIN file to install the JDK but I cannot figure it out.
2010-10-19T19:23:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	i have done it ages ago that way, but forgot how i did it
2010-10-19T19:23:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	just make sure the version is set in $path
2010-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	imo you have to copy the unpacked jdk folder to /usr/lib
2010-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	joe85	defrysk	I did do that. But when I run sudo update-java-alternatives -s foldername
2010-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	and then set you path in ~/.bashrc
2010-10-19T19:46:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	like PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/java/home
2010-10-19T19:46:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	but thats ages ago since i did that
2010-10-19T19:48:00.000Z	joe85	defrysk	I added PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.5.0_22/
2010-10-19T19:50:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	totally against safety regulations you could try http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/i386/sun-java5-jdk/download
2010-10-19T19:50:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	at yor own risk!
2010-10-19T19:51:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	better : http://zebardast.ir/en/installing-sun-jdk-5-on-ubuntu-9-10-and-10-04/
2010-10-19T19:52:00.000Z	joe85	defrysk	thanks I'll try that
2010-10-19T19:53:00.000Z	defrysk	joe85	good luck :)
