2012-10-01T16:45:00.000Z	Iceman_B		um, where does the SSHd store it's config?
2012-10-01T16:46:00.000Z	Iceman_B		oki, I'll have a look
2012-10-01T16:46:00.000Z	Iceman_B		tnx
2012-10-01T16:48:00.000Z	Iceman_B		o_Ã´

2012-10-01T16:49:00.000Z	Iceman_B		perhaps /etc/init/ssh.conf possible?
2012-10-01T16:49:00.000Z	Iceman_B		I want to fiddle with my SSHD config

2012-10-01T16:50:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	/etc/ssh/sshd_config
2012-10-01T16:53:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	That's correct - and you wouldn't want the package to contains any files for /etc/ssh/ either! Those files are generated by the post-install scripts and take account of pre-existing configuration files and keys
2012-10-01T16:53:00.000Z	Iceman_B	TJ-	eeh, that;s too hard for me to follow :(
2012-10-01T16:53:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	The package includes an example config: "/usr/share/doc/openssh-client/examples/sshd_config"
2012-10-01T16:55:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	Yes... each time the package is upgraded the package-manager and post-install scripts check for the existence of the configuration files, and check if there are changes needed. If so, the package-manager will offer choices (keep existing/replace/show diff)
2012-10-01T17:10:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	"sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX" where X is the device you're wiping. That'll fill it with pseudo-random data. For a faster option you can zero the drive with "sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX"
2012-10-01T17:15:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	"apt-cache show" gives you details of the named package, in that case, "wipe"
2012-10-01T17:17:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	If you're wiping the entire hard drive you'd refer to it by its device name, e.g. "/dev/sdx". If you want to wipe a single partition, you'd do e.g. "/dev/sdXY" where that is device X, partition Y
2012-10-01T17:18:00.000Z	Iceman_B	TJ-	no, everything needs to go
2012-10-01T17:18:00.000Z	TJ-	Iceman_B	Then the form "/dev/sdX" is the one to address the device
