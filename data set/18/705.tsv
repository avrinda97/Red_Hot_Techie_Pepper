2011-12-23T13:10:00.000Z	aBound		I just want to say that Ubuntu is awesome. :)
2011-12-23T13:11:00.000Z	aBound		Question: How do I fix the official Firefox repository for Ubuntu?
2011-12-23T13:12:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	What's wrong with it?
2011-12-23T13:13:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	Try removing it via Software Center and adding ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable
2011-12-23T13:20:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	With Software Center, Edit>Software Sources>Other Software
2011-12-23T13:21:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	Then remove the rogue Firefox one and use theadmin's command in the terminal
2011-12-23T13:28:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	I assumed you were using Oneiric. Open Synaptic.
2011-12-23T13:29:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	In one of the menus, there'll be an Other Software option or something like that.
2011-12-23T13:30:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	On the pannel, you should see an edit menu when your mouse is over it.
2011-12-23T13:30:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	When Software Center is open
2011-12-23T13:31:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/ubuntu-help/addremove-ppa.html
2011-12-23T13:34:00.000Z	aBound	KatsumeBlisk	This is how my screen looks, http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/213/softwarecenter.png/
2011-12-23T13:35:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	Move your mouse to the panel or hit the Alt key
2011-12-23T13:35:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	That's how you get the Menus
2011-12-23T13:38:00.000Z	aBound	KatsumeBlisk	The previous commands you gave me for the Terminal say it's aimed at Lucid and Maverick only.
2011-12-23T13:39:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	What commands? The "sudo apt-add..." ones?
2011-12-23T13:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	That works in any Ubuntu version and that ppa is the official Firefox one and it has Firefox 9.0.1 for oneiric
2011-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	aBound	I just remembered something. Why are you using a Firefox ppa? Canonical automatically updates Firefox now
