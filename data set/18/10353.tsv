2006-12-27T16:53:00.000Z	defiant		ok well maybe this other problem will be easier to solve.

2006-12-27T16:56:00.000Z	defiant		funny even running that sarcastic post it still did not work

2006-12-27T16:59:00.000Z	defiant		I tried FC6, did not install properly, I tried Ubuntu, did not work, now Kubuntu and more issues
2006-12-27T17:00:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	how old is your machine?
2006-12-28T17:01:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	the hardware may be too new to be fully supported yet, do you have an old box laying around?
2006-12-28T17:02:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	try installing Ubuntu on the old box.
2006-12-28T17:05:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	Ubuntu.
2006-12-28T11:25:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	mayber they didn't see you either, if you don't put n2diy in your response, it is just noise to me.
2006-12-28T11:25:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	see this?
2006-12-28T11:26:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	see the difference?
2006-12-28T11:29:00.000Z	n2diy	defiant	if you want to carry on a conversation with someone, you have to inculde their nick in the message, or it will scroll by un-noticed.
