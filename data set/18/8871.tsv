2008-05-24T21:00:00.000Z	Wires		I guess I'll try a previous version of lm_sensors then
2008-05-24T21:01:00.000Z	Wires		I gotcha
2008-05-24T21:02:00.000Z	Wires		ok, well let me try a previous version
2008-05-24T21:02:00.000Z	Wires		btw also, what's the gcc-dev package?
2008-05-24T21:02:00.000Z	Wires		sorry for all the questions.. but that's the way to learn I guess :P
2008-05-24T21:03:00.000Z	Wires		well I mean, what's a dev package?
2008-05-24T21:03:00.000Z	Wires		ahh
2008-05-24T21:03:00.000Z	Wires		ok
2008-05-24T21:04:00.000Z	Wires		ok
2008-05-24T21:04:00.000Z	Wires		then hmm.. what should I do?
2008-05-24T21:06:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 Actually, a -dev package is the stuff needed to develop applications using a particular library.  The plain package like 'tcl' is just run-time support for using a library.  The -dev like 'tcl-dev' is for creating apps using tcl.
2008-05-24T21:06:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 You can see what a package is using 'apt-cache show packagename'
2008-05-24T21:09:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 packagename was a placeholder where you put the package name that you care about.  'apt-cache show tcl'
2008-05-24T21:11:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 I missed the start of your question.  I was just helping with 'what are all these packages?'
2008-05-24T21:13:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 You need 'sudo apt-get build-dep lm-sensors' .  That takes advantage of the list of build dependencies in the lm-sensors package.
2008-05-24T21:13:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 Or you could just install the prebuild lm-sensors package.
2008-05-24T21:19:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	That command will install the packages that are recorded as dependencies to build the lm-sensors package from source.
2008-05-24T21:21:00.000Z	stroyan	Wires	 I need to leave now.  Good luck.
