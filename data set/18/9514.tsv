2007-03-25T10:51:00.000Z	delirus		heh..
2007-03-25T10:52:00.000Z	delirus		irssi just totally rocks
2007-03-25T10:52:00.000Z	delirus		So there are no Ubuntu 64-bit users awake right now? :(
2007-03-25T10:54:00.000Z	delirus		yick
2007-03-25T10:56:00.000Z	delirus		I think I'll take a gamble on 64-but Ubuntu. bUt if it doesn't work out I'll have to put aside three days to set up gentoo again >_>
2007-03-25T10:56:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	ubuntu 64 bit is just not ready yet IMHO..
2007-03-25T10:56:00.000Z	delirus	kalpik	 in what ways?
2007-03-25T10:57:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	java, flash, w32codecs..
2007-03-25T10:57:00.000Z	delirus	kalpik	 heh....  those hings are rather trivial if you ask em
2007-03-25T10:58:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	heh.. if you dont need multimedia, then 64 bit is OK!
2007-03-25T10:59:00.000Z	delirus	kalpik	 You just have to install a 32-bit video player, along with all of the emul libraries
2007-03-25T10:59:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	yeah.. chroot and stuff.. too much headache..
2007-03-25T11:00:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	O_o wow! how?!
2007-03-25T11:02:00.000Z	delirus	kalpik	 I installed the 32-bit emulation libraries, a 32-bit brower for flash, a 32-bit video player for the codecs.
2007-03-25T11:02:00.000Z	delirus	kalpik	 I'm on gentoo though... I dunno how it works in Ubuntu :\
2007-03-25T11:03:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	yes,, other distros work fine with 64 bit.. i tried suse 64 bit,, that was fine.. but couldnt get things running on ubuntu 64 bit
2007-03-25T11:04:00.000Z	delirus	kalpik	 I guess I'll just jump right into it and see if I can work it out.  If I get it working and you're here later (and I think to) I'll tell you how I did it 8)
2007-03-25T11:04:00.000Z	kalpik	delirus	ill be waiting ;)
