2010-01-29T21:25:00.000Z	Bohemian		so, i am fixing a friend's laptop. gonna use a ubuntu livecd. it just stopped working, i think it's the HDD. besides testing to see if ubuntu will load, what are some tests i can do?
2010-01-29T21:25:00.000Z	Bohemian		to see what the actual problem is, i.e.
2010-01-29T21:26:00.000Z	oCean_	Bohemian	once booted, see if you can mount & access the (internal) disk?
2010-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	Bohemian	oCean_	how do i mount the internal disc? and if it can't, can i assume the HDD failed?
2010-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	Bohemian		just replace it and should be good to go?
2010-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	oCean_	Bohemian	assuming first (internal) disc is /dev/sda, once booted you could try to "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt"
2010-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	Bohemian	oCean_	okay. anything else i should try?
2010-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	Bohemian		run a memory test?
2010-01-29T21:30:00.000Z	oCean_	Bohemian	one thing at a time :) - but yes. Running memcheck might be helpful
2010-01-29T21:30:00.000Z	Bohemian	oCean_	if it mounts, what does that mean?
2010-01-29T21:30:00.000Z	Bohemian		bad connection?
2010-01-29T21:32:00.000Z	oCean_	Bohemian	Maybe better ask in ##hardware for hardware debugging support...
2010-01-29T21:32:00.000Z	Bohemian		okay
2010-01-29T21:32:00.000Z	Bohemian	oCean_	if it doesn't mount, does it mean the HDD needs to be replaced?
2010-01-29T21:33:00.000Z	oCean_	Bohemian	join ##hardware
2010-01-29T21:33:00.000Z	Bohemian		i did
2010-01-29T21:34:00.000Z	oCean_	Bohemian	then there's no longer need to ask in #ubuntu, right? This channel is for *ubuntu* issues
2010-01-29T21:34:00.000Z	Bohemian	oCean_	well, i'm using ubuntu to dx the problem...
