2008-07-07T17:54:00.000Z	nich0s		Is it possible to switch between KDE and GNOME without a fresh install?
2008-07-07T17:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	of course.
2008-07-07T17:56:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	I may be (probably am) taking this the wrong way, but are you suggesting that kubuntu desktop is only 44kB? :p
2008-07-07T17:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	thats only the base package..  it will install a crapload of other packages when you run that command
2008-07-07T17:57:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	How would I go about ridding myself of KDE and getting GNOME?
2008-07-07T17:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	i thought you wanted to install kde?
2008-07-07T17:58:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	I have Kubuntu right now, but it runs slowly because this is, for lack of a better term, a shiess computer.
2008-07-07T17:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	i see.. you should be able to install gnome and remove kde.... it'll probably take some work though
2008-07-07T17:59:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	I love me a challenge, would you be able to direct me towards some documentation perhaps?
2008-07-07T17:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	sorry, wrong link

2008-07-07T18:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	i like xfce. how old of a pc are we talking?.. specs?
2008-07-07T18:02:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	Old enough to run Gnome, I would think. P4 2.53 512 RAM.
2008-07-07T18:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	yeah, it should run gnome fine
2008-07-07T18:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	i'd clean install xfce, gnome, flux, whatever else you want to try, then clean install the one you want...
2008-07-07T18:06:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	You've been most helpful!
2008-08-17T04:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nich0s	i believe, there's a program you can download to do it... but naturally, no i don't think so.
2008-08-17T04:28:00.000Z	nich0s	IndyGunFreak	Ok. I'll start googling like a madman. THANKS
