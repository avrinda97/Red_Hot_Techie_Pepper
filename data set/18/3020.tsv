2010-01-07T22:56:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	It causes me headache
2010-01-07T22:43:00.000Z	Xfact	alberto_	 please don't shout, everybody here is for help, wait for your turn :)
2010-01-07T22:48:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	I'm trying to record my guitar, which is plugged in Line Input. I can hear the sound, but whenever I use the Gnome recorder, it does not record anything.
2010-01-07T22:49:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	I also try to configure sound in System / Preferences / Sound
2010-01-07T22:50:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	I have an embedded sound card.
2010-01-07T22:51:00.000Z	Xfact	alberto_	first assure that your guitar is being accepted by Ubuntu hardware... if it is then I think the problem is with your software, try something batter like, 'audacity'
2010-01-07T22:53:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	My guitar, just like every guitar, used to work in Jaunty
2010-01-07T22:53:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	I cannot record Microphone INput either.
2010-01-07T22:53:00.000Z	Xfact	alberto_	are you first time having problem on you junty?
2010-01-07T22:54:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	The biggest mistake I made was updating to karmic
2010-01-07T22:55:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	After trying karmic and finding out it gave me a lot of problems, I had to go back to Jaunty.
2010-01-07T22:55:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	Jaunty used to record my guitar and microphone input without any problems.
2010-01-07T22:56:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	Now it gives me problems.
2010-01-07T22:57:00.000Z	Xfact	alberto_	 ooh! You upgraded to karmic, Karmic still having some probs people saying so I would not say it's totally 'stable release' and second, fresh installation is much batter then upgradation, as you can see I am also having problem with upgrade....
2010-01-07T22:58:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	I had problems both with fresh installation and upgrading.
2010-01-07T22:58:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	Karmic sucks.
2010-01-07T22:58:00.000Z	alberto_	Xfact	So Jaunty does.
2010-01-07T23:04:00.000Z	Xfact	alberto_	 I am new to jaunty and karmic so till researching on it...and audio section has lots of probs like it's also not taking my sub woofer :(, so good luck with your tries...I hope it'll solve soon and Karmic half sucks!:-/
