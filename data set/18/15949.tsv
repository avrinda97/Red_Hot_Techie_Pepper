2004-12-17T10:27:00.000Z	mako	davux	if you ordered cds before oct 19, you should have them already or will get them soon
2004-12-17T10:28:00.000Z	davux	mako	is there a way to know when I ordered the CD's ?
2004-12-17T10:29:00.000Z	mako	davux	it's not displayed in the interface
2004-12-17T10:29:00.000Z	davux	mako	is it stored anyhow ?
2004-12-17T10:29:00.000Z	mako	davux	i will update the webpage with all of the shipment2 folks and it will show up
2004-12-17T10:29:00.000Z	mako	davux	i'll do that this week
2004-12-17T10:30:00.000Z	mako	davux	so if you ordered and got in on the secon shipment, it will show up
