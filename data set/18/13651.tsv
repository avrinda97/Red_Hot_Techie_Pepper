2005-10-30T08:54:00.000Z	titanium		if i'm adding a user as an ftp user only is it reasonable to make their home directory /dev/null?
2005-10-30T08:54:00.000Z	titanium		or perhaps should i use something else
2005-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	I'd suggest /bin/false but yes.
2005-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	not the home directory though
2005-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	the users shell.
2005-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	the home dir is still important for ftp :)
2005-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	titanium	johnm	yeah thats what im using for their shell.
2005-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	titanium	johnm	oh
2005-10-30T08:57:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	you will probably want to check tha tthe ftpd is configured to chroot them to ~ though.
2005-10-30T08:57:00.000Z	titanium		ah crap it is configured that way
2005-10-30T08:57:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	that means they can't descend any futher down the file tree.
2005-10-30T08:57:00.000Z	titanium		i had my system set up and had to reformat yesterday, i backed up stuff like the proftpd conf but forgot how to re-set up the user accounts. :P you're right, that's how i had it before. thanks
2005-10-30T08:58:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	np/.
2005-10-30T08:58:00.000Z	titanium		hehe
2005-10-30T08:58:00.000Z	titanium		i did a chown -R root:root / as root ;P system was working great until then
2005-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	yeah, not the best move ;)
2005-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	if you want security, check out grsec, pax and RBAC (all part of grsec)
2005-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	johnm	titanium	might be a steep learning curve though
