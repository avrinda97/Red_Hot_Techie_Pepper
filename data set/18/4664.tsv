2009-03-06T06:31:00.000Z	andybond13		anyone good with GNU parted???
2009-03-06T06:31:00.000Z	Scooma	andybond13	whatcha need?
2009-03-06T06:32:00.000Z	andybond13	Scooma	I'm trying to partition my hard drive to install debian
2009-03-06T06:32:00.000Z	andybond13		fdisk and windows 7 see my partitions,  gparted and the debian installer don't
2009-03-06T06:33:00.000Z	andybond13		http://paste.debian.net/29857/
2009-03-06T06:33:00.000Z	andybond13		yes
2009-03-06T06:34:00.000Z	andybond13		I know
2009-03-06T06:34:00.000Z	andybond13		and I did, but gparted doesn't see it
2009-03-06T06:36:00.000Z	andybond13		install debian on half of a hard drive
2009-03-06T06:36:00.000Z	andybond13		which already has windows 7 on the other half
2009-03-06T06:37:00.000Z	Scooma	andybond13	according to your fdisk dump it looks like you've already got the partitions?
2009-03-06T06:38:00.000Z	andybond13		actionparsnip, scooma, yeah they're there, but the debian installer doesn't see them
2009-03-06T06:38:00.000Z	andybond13		how do I use the livecd?
2009-03-06T06:39:00.000Z	Scooma		you'd download it and burn it... then you boot from it
2009-03-06T06:39:00.000Z	andybond13		you mean the ubuntu install cd
2009-03-06T06:39:00.000Z	andybond13		the partitions, the debian installer, like gparted, sees it all as unallocated
2009-03-06T06:40:00.000Z	andybond13		how would the ubuntu livecd be any different than the debian one?
2009-03-06T06:42:00.000Z	Scooma	andybond13	or if you'd rather save a blank cd/dvd, you can use unetbootin to turn the cdrom ISO to a bootable USB key...
