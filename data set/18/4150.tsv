2009-05-27T01:56:00.000Z	arthus		hi everyone, I'm trying to set up a (very simple) local dns server
2009-05-27T01:56:00.000Z	arthus		what's the best way to do so? I just need to forward example.com to 192.15.1.50
2009-05-27T01:57:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	use dnsmasq... install it and... um... done
2009-05-27T01:57:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	how do I configure?
2009-05-27T01:58:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	/etc/dnsmasq.conf (lots of examples already in there)
2009-05-27T01:58:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	by default it is configured to listen on all interfaces and forward to the dns servers in /etc/resolv.conf
2009-05-27T01:59:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	thanks, when I try to install I get this error "Address already in use"
2009-05-27T01:59:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	uninstall any other dns server first
2009-05-27T01:59:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	I don't know of any.... how could I check for any installed?
2009-05-27T01:59:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	what have you installed so far?
2009-05-27T02:00:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	nothing, this is a fresh install
2009-05-27T02:00:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	that doesn't sound okay... Can you pm me the output of "history | grep apt" ?
2009-05-27T02:03:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	?
2009-05-27T02:03:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	sorry, I'm typing this on my laptop, having trouble copying it over
2009-05-27T02:05:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	sent, http://pastoid.com/ayh
2009-06-03T05:45:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	it is probably not mounted now
2009-06-03T05:45:00.000Z	arthus	Kalmi_	how would I go about remounting it?
2009-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	Kalmi_	arthus	find the partition for it using gparted... you are looking for something like /dev/sda4
