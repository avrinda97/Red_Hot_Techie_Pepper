2007-06-05T15:52:00.000Z	bionoid		I've had my Feisty running quite well since I installed it - but I have one problem that I'm unsure how to solve. I have an Intel 945GM graphics adapter, but the drivers have _extremely_ poor 3D performance. For example Google Earth is completely unusable, need at least 30 minutes to complete the 2-second start animation. Anyone have an idea what might cause this?
2007-06-05T15:54:00.000Z	bionoid		I forgot to mention: Compiz runs very smoothly. But G.E. does not, and Parallels have horrible graphics performance as opposed to when run on Windows on the same hardware
2007-06-05T15:54:00.000Z	bionoid		er, and by Compiz, I mean Beryl
2007-06-05T15:55:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	there is no virtualizing solution yet which can take advantage of 3d accelerated hardware. therefore performance of xompiz+beryl in a virtual machine is to be expected poor
2007-06-05T15:56:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	Yeah I know but that's not my question. I'm not trying to use 3D from within the VM - I run Beryl on Host OS and it's smooth. But Google Earth on host os is horrible, and 2D graphics performance is parallels is absoluetly ridiculous
2007-06-05T15:56:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	But when I ran windows both host and guest it was much smoother (and, google earth et al runs just fine)
2007-06-05T15:57:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	windows does not use 3d accel for the window manager ... only the expensive vistas do. so beryl is different fro mwindows
2007-06-05T15:58:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	..
2007-06-05T15:59:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	Yeah but you're still not touching the question I'm asking, just stating some seemingly unrelated random facts. Thanks anyway
2007-06-05T15:59:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	yo usay beryl is slow in parralels ? well it's a known fact. or did i miss you question ?
2007-06-05T16:00:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	No that is NOT what I'm saying at all.
2007-06-05T16:01:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	No.
2007-06-05T16:06:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	what 3d car do you have, which drivers are you using ?
2007-06-05T16:06:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	Intel 945GM with the i810 driver
2007-06-05T16:08:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	you may want to use the properity linux drivers fro mintel ... they have soem edvantage
2007-06-05T16:09:00.000Z	bionoid	Spliffster	Yeah I know it's low-end, but it still is smooth in Windows on the exact same hardware. So I'm still blaming some piece of software ;-)
2007-06-05T16:10:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	READ drivers. have me say it once more ?
2007-06-05T16:11:00.000Z	Spliffster	bionoid	to your rleave ... intel will open up their driver development for linux. whil this is nice, it will take soem time to get decent opensource-ish drivers
