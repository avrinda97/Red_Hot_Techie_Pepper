2008-05-16T10:26:00.000Z	markers	Myrtti	do you have any ideas what i should do about this "your screen and graphics card could not be detected correctly"
2008-05-16T10:27:00.000Z	Myrtti	markers	do you have a desktop installation cd nearby?
2008-05-16T10:28:00.000Z	Myrtti	markers	pop one in, reboot your computer, see if it detects the settings right
2008-05-16T10:38:00.000Z	markers	Myrtti	i dont know what happened but after i rebooted with the cd everything is back to normal. thank you for your help
2008-05-16T10:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	markers	it's only temporary
2008-05-16T10:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	markers	when you take the cd out, you'll probably end up in the same situation
2008-05-16T10:40:00.000Z	markers	Myrtti	well i took the cd out and rebooted again a second time without the cd in the drive and right now everything is working as it was when i first installed hardy
