2007-04-28T12:01:00.000Z	whileimhere		When I walk away from my computer for say a hour or so and come back the screen will be blank nad the caps lock light and the scoll lock light will be flashing. I will be unable to bring it out of the black screen it is in. Anyone know why?
2007-04-28T12:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	Have you got a USB keyboard and mouse?
2007-04-28T12:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	Then I am guessing your system has gone into standby and acpi took usb with it.
2007-04-28T12:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	Thus there is no way to "wake up" the machine.
2007-04-28T12:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	You can try un-plugging and re-plugging the mouse/keyboard. Not sure if it'll help tho.
2007-04-28T12:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	You're welcome.
2007-04-28T12:05:00.000Z	whileimhere	BlueEagle	any idea on this: I install Fiesty from CD and the Wireless networking never works. I install 6.10 and networking works fine. I install 6.10 and then upgrade to 7.04 and wireless works fine. Why doesnt it most likely work with the cd install of 7.10
2007-04-28T12:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	Probable cause is firmware not being on 7.04 while it's on previous versions. Just a guess tho.
2007-04-28T12:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	I've never used wireless networks so I really don't know.
2007-04-28T12:06:00.000Z	whileimhere	BlueEagle	Thanks for the guess. I was thinking the same thing.
2007-04-28T12:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	I do however know that most firmware is closed-source and propertary software and that most wifi nicks require firmware before working, thus that's my guess.
2007-04-28T12:08:00.000Z	whileimhere	BlueEagle	Its funny cause all versions of Ubuntu prior to 7.04 worked perfect out of box. 7.04 will only use the wireless when upgraded from a prior version and not a fresh CD install.
2008-10-09T04:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	In my opinion it's mamuthical. I installed it, tried it and to me it seemed incomplete.
2008-10-09T04:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	There's no shame in running qt-apps in gnome if you've got room for the extra libraries.
2008-10-09T04:41:00.000Z	whileimhere	BlueEagle	I just figured it might be faster.
2008-10-09T04:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	Well, when KDE is loaded the qt libraries are also loaded so you would see a faster load time on digikam the first time you start it. After that however you won't notice much difference unless you're short on ram and having both gtk and qt apps running. Keep in mind tho that firefox uses gtk and you will have both libraries running in kde too so the memory foot print will probably not be any smaller.
2008-10-09T04:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	whileimhere	If you find it running too slow in Gnome you could try xfce or even fluxbox but the latter requires alot of setup. Atleast it did when I tried it last.
2008-10-09T04:45:00.000Z	whileimhere	BlueEagle	I liked XFCE but FLUXBOX takes to much work or me.
