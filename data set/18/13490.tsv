2005-11-16T12:07:00.000Z	ddc		anyone knows of some problems compilling kallsyms.c on ubuntu 5.10 with kernel 2.6.12-9-386
2005-11-16T12:07:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	tried make clean; make ?
2005-11-16T12:07:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	not yet I'll give it a try
2005-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	just the same error, still inconsistent kallsyms data
2005-11-16T12:43:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	hmm.. have u applied any third party patches or just compiling the pristine sources
2005-11-16T12:43:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	i was following the howto for hibernate2
2005-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	but nothing in the topic mentions this problem
2005-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	see this link http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0508.3/1822.html
2005-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	i believe that this was a known problem in 2.6.13 and appears to be fixed in 2.6.14
2005-11-16T12:45:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	already tried but got 13 out of 14 hunks failed when doing patch -p1 < patchfile
2005-11-16T12:47:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	against what sources are you applying the patcg
2005-11-16T12:47:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	*patch*
2005-11-16T12:47:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	linux-source-2.6.12
2005-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	aah.. you'll need to apply the patch first to 2.6.13 and then to 2.6.14. and this needs to be done on the plain linux kernel 2.6.12 from kernel.org, not the ones that are installed with ubuntu as ubuntu would have applied its own set of patches
2005-11-16T12:53:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	mmh don't understand it, why patching .13 .14 kernels to get .12 kernel working? Shouldn't I use kernel .14 then?? sorry for the trouble
2005-11-16T12:54:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	otherwise disable the extra kallsyms pass in the kernel config
2005-11-16T12:54:00.000Z	ddc	traaks	what does kallsyms do btw?
2005-11-16T12:55:00.000Z	traaks	ddc	no idea :P
