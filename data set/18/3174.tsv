2010-02-28T18:17:00.000Z	mylisto2		something is very very wrong with my system
2010-02-28T18:17:00.000Z	mylisto2		I just opened my damn irc client, and I realized that something is wrong with it..
2010-02-28T18:17:00.000Z	mylisto2		it used to show a ton of different networks to join (freenode, etc..etc..)...
2010-02-28T18:17:00.000Z	mylisto2		they were all wiped out
2010-02-28T18:18:00.000Z	mylisto2		yeah xchat
2010-02-28T18:19:00.000Z	mylisto2		I'm wondering what the hell is going on
2010-02-28T18:20:00.000Z	mylisto2		even thunderbird seems affected
2010-02-28T18:20:00.000Z	rob_p	mylisto2	Have you looked over your system logs for anything abnormal?
2010-02-28T18:20:00.000Z	mylisto2	rob_p	not sure how to do that
2010-02-28T18:21:00.000Z	rob_p	mylisto2	They are located in /var/log
2010-02-28T18:21:00.000Z	mylisto2		I wouldn't even know what to look for
2010-02-28T18:21:00.000Z	rob_p	mylisto2	Give them a gander and see if it yields any clues.
2010-02-28T18:21:00.000Z	mylisto2	rob_p	what one should I look at?
2010-02-28T18:23:00.000Z	mylisto2	rob_p	can I pm you?
2010-02-28T18:23:00.000Z	rob_p	mylisto2	The system log would be a good place to start.  You may have to go through many of them to assess what (if anything) happened to cause your issues.
2010-02-28T18:23:00.000Z	mylisto2		what ones are the system logs?
2010-02-28T18:23:00.000Z	rob_p	mylisto2	yeah
