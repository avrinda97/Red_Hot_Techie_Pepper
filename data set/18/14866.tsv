2005-05-31T13:32:00.000Z	brush		can anybody help with an easy route question?
2005-05-31T13:32:00.000Z	brush		my default route keeps coming up wrong
2005-05-31T13:32:00.000Z	brush		it points to the gw instead of my isp's gw
2005-05-31T13:33:00.000Z	brush		sorry, it is the gw
2005-05-31T13:33:00.000Z	brush		just ipforward, ubuntu machine
2005-05-31T13:33:00.000Z	brush		when i restart my network, the default route pts to 192.168.2.1
2005-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	brush		instead of the isp's gw
2005-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	brush		i can manually change it and everything is fine
2005-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	brush		so, where does the networking startup script get that bad route?
2005-05-31T13:35:00.000Z	brush		no, DHCP gives the correct route, but when i restart my network it grabs the incorrect route
2005-05-31T13:35:00.000Z	tarvid	brush	dhcp should get the right gateway
2005-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	brush	tarvid	DHCP does get the right gw
2005-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	brush		but if i just restart my network there is a default placed above the DHCP default
2005-05-31T13:37:00.000Z	tarvid		restarting should invoke a lease shouldn't it
2005-05-31T13:37:00.000Z	brush	tarvid	the DHCP is fine
2005-05-31T13:37:00.000Z	brush		but, if i restart my network, a default route gets placed above the ISP that points to the gw
2005-05-31T13:38:00.000Z	tarvid		my nat box says among other things option routers 192.168.1.1;
2005-05-31T13:38:00.000Z	brush	tarvid	option routers?
