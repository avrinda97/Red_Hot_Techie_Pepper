2007-09-30T10:42:00.000Z	the_bull		hello all
2007-09-30T10:42:00.000Z	the_bull		what do you think? which one is the best *firewall* in ubuntu?
2007-09-30T10:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	the_bull	iptables :)
2007-09-30T10:43:00.000Z	the_bull	fyrestrtr	iptables is the best?
2007-09-30T10:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	the_bull	all linux distributions come with iptables; its the standard.
2007-09-30T10:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	the_bull	there is only iptables.
2007-09-30T10:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	the_bull	depends on your budget
2007-09-30T10:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	the_bull	iptables is the 'core' firewall system. Everything else are just gui that modify the iptables rules.
2007-09-30T10:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	the_bull	in other words, there is only one firewall, its called iptables.
2007-09-30T10:45:00.000Z	the_bull	fyrestrtr	thnx
