2007-08-31T12:02:00.000Z	Ktron		Trying to find cli ways to check the status of a service (running/stopped) and report the version of ubuntu
2007-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	more specific?
2007-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	about which part?
2007-08-31T12:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	well which service are you talking about, does this service have anything in it that reports these sorts of things, etc.
2007-08-31T12:05:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	its my company's service, and I'm trying to avoid asking them to build in more functionality
2007-08-31T12:05:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	fedora core lets you do 'service servicename status'
2007-08-31T12:05:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	and (I think) gentoo let's you do 'rc-status servicename'
2007-08-31T12:05:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	oh you mean daemon, ok  you were using fedora aliases
2007-08-31T12:05:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	yes, sorry, I do mean daemon
2007-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	not sure for ubuntu, they do have a variet of rc* commands, might try doing rc<tab><tab> and seeing what looks good
2007-08-31T12:07:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	no, the only command I find is rcp
2007-08-31T12:07:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	do ls /usr/bin | grep rc
2007-08-31T12:08:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	apt-ftparchive, dircolors, exo-csource, foomatic-searchprinter, hp-colorcal, paperconf, rcp, xarchiver, xdf-icon-resource
2007-08-31T12:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	well, I am not sure, I am not using ubuntu so I can't check that out, I know how to do it on arch
2007-08-31T12:09:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	just for refrence, what's it on Arch?
2007-08-31T12:10:00.000Z	bruenig	Ktron	on arch when a daemon is launched via init at least, the name of the daemon is touched in /var/run/daemons, so you have empty text files for all the things
2007-08-31T12:11:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	/var/run looks like it might have a useful file so I can write something
2007-08-31T12:11:00.000Z	Ktron	bruenig	thanks
