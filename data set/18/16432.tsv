2004-10-13T05:06:00.000Z	nate		no
2004-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	nate		sorry, I just really really hate UIs that try to force me to use middle-click
2004-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	nate		there's gotta be a keyboard equivalent
2004-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	nate		yes, but I don't use it to click with
2004-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	nate		because otherwise I accidentally generate scroll events
2004-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	nate		there's got to be a keyboard shortcut, surely? GNOME being Accessible and all?
2004-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	nate		and again I say NO
2004-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	nate		that is playing Twister with my fingers
2004-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	nate		I will not do that
2004-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	nate		any GUI which attempts to make me do that will lose my patronage
2004-10-13T05:09:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	Who cares. :-)
2004-10-13T05:13:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	Really?
2004-10-13T05:20:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	I think GNOME copied Windows, and I think it's bad.
2004-10-13T05:20:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	move=drag/copy=ctrl+drag/link=alt+drag is exactly Windows way, and IMO it's wrong...
2004-10-13T05:34:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	Makes sense.
2004-10-13T05:39:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	I want my MP3 file to be in "music", "artist X", "album Y", "year yyyy" folder at the same time.
2004-10-13T05:40:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	Well, that's no problem. :-)
2004-10-13T05:42:00.000Z	sanxiyn	nate	It had some commercial apps.
