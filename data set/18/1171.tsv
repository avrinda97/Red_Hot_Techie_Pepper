2011-12-25T07:40:00.000Z	[R]	go8765	thats probaly not why... but just swapoff and swapon...
2011-12-25T07:40:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	and what about without swapoff?
2011-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	[R]	go8765	no clue... you could just do the swapoff and continue with life...
2011-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	I have now so many RAM to use swapoff now :(
2011-12-25T07:42:00.000Z	[R]	go8765	what?
2011-12-25T07:43:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	swapoff: /dev/sda5: swapoff failed:
2011-12-25T07:43:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	I have no so many free memory - to upload my swap in it :(
2011-12-25T07:43:00.000Z	[R]	go8765	reboot
2011-12-25T07:44:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	I try to find way to make swap clearning without reboot and swapoff :)
2011-12-25T07:44:00.000Z	[R]	go8765	what do you think "clearing" the swap is going to do taht swapoff isn't?
2011-12-25T07:45:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	sorry?
2011-12-25T07:46:00.000Z	[R]	go8765	you want to "clear" the swap... what do you think "clearing" it is going to do taht is different from running swapoff?
2011-12-25T07:47:00.000Z	go8765	[R]	sorry again :) english is not my native and now i cant fully undertand what you mean again :(
