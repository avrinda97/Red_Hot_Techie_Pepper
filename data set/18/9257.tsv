2007-04-23T12:01:00.000Z	mercurial		it just showed me some of the settings
2007-04-23T12:01:00.000Z	mercurial		=/
2007-04-23T12:03:00.000Z	mercurial		it's in the comments in the xorg.conf file
2007-04-23T12:03:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	indeed, let me check how was it
2007-04-23T11:56:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg
2007-04-23T11:57:00.000Z	mercurial	nevermind	doesn't appear to have worked
2007-04-23T11:57:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	np
2007-04-23T11:58:00.000Z	mercurial	nevermind	when I read the xorg.conf file, there was a bit more on that command, but I can't remember, or access the file
2007-04-23T11:58:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	the xorg file is on /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-04-23T11:58:00.000Z	mercurial	nevermind	can't run gedit to view it
2007-04-23T11:58:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	use vi :)
2007-04-23T11:59:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	to delete just use del, and to write make sure you press 'i' first to go to 'insert' mode
2007-04-23T12:00:00.000Z	mercurial	nevermind	it's not allowing me to see the line with the command I was looking for.
2007-04-23T12:00:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	what exactly are you trying to do?
2007-04-23T12:00:00.000Z	mercurial	nevermind	There was one in there that opened a terminal application to make a xorg.conf file with the resolutions I wanted supported
2007-04-23T12:02:00.000Z	mercurial	nevermind	it was sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg, followed with -phis or something
2007-04-23T12:03:00.000Z	nevermind	mercurial	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
