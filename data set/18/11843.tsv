2006-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	Cntryboy		anyone?
2006-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	make sure glx is on the list of modules to load in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-06-17T11:24:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	what processor you have?
2006-06-17T11:28:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	you wern't playing UT as root were you? :)
2006-06-17T11:33:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	no, but it will set the driver to vga instead of nvidia
2006-06-17T11:33:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	and remove any other settings the nvidia script made to your xorg.conf
2006-06-17T11:34:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	yea. but i would save it somewhere (or use the installer direct from nvidia and not from the repositories)
2006-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	if it fails, open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the driver statement to "nv" and it will at least boot
2006-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	no, you need legacty
2006-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	Cntryboy	keleus	how do I delete what was just downloaded?
2006-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	keleus	Cntryboy	"rm filename"
