2006-04-19T06:53:00.000Z	marcky		Hey there, I need some help with my installation, I'm a newbie to linux and my installation is freezing during network configuration (dhcp), can anyone help me out?
2006-04-19T06:54:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	is ur net attached? router up?
2006-04-19T06:55:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	ur wireless modem attached to Ubuntu as well? did the install recognize it?
2006-04-19T06:55:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	what wireless modem?
2006-04-19T06:57:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	try the system/networking applet
2006-04-19T06:58:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	System => Administration => Networking
2006-04-19T07:00:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	 u mean the install isnt even done? oopsie
2006-04-19T07:01:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	can u get past it? it wants to get to ubuntu and update itself ... u can probably get the net configured without that (maybe)
2006-04-19T07:01:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	how is wireless modem attached, usb?
2006-04-19T07:03:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	my cable router (linksys) was recognized out the chute ... enet attached
2006-04-19T07:05:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	if ur router is similar to most u can get to it thru a browser; a fixed ip address gets ur to a config page; do u have a (gulp) windows machine or another linux box u can check to see if the port is active ??  i have linksys and not sure about alcatel
2006-04-19T07:06:00.000Z	jramsey	marcky	 ask _jason  he might be able to help (if he's on)
