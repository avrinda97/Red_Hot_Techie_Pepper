2008-11-29T14:56:00.000Z	melodie_		 I'm not a newbie, I know Grub and I don't use Windows.
2008-11-29T14:57:00.000Z	melodie_		 I need to install grub on Ubuntu partition because I don't want it to manage my other distros
2008-11-29T14:57:00.000Z	melodie_		such as
2008-11-29T14:57:00.000Z	melodie_		stage1 not found on this partition
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	melodie_		or even 'this volume does not exist"
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	melodie_		so
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	melodie_		if someone knows about reinstall on
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	melodie_		it ends with error without explanation
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	melodie_		:(
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	melodie_	 Try typing all your thoughts on one line please. Not thought, enter, thought, enter.
2008-11-29T14:59:00.000Z	melodie_	oOarthurOo	not easy
2008-11-29T14:59:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	melodie_	I know, but it makes it easier for people trying to help.
2008-11-29T15:11:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	melodie_	Why not keep it in the public channel in case others can help to? Asking to pm means putting all your eggs in one basket. Not that I have any reason to doubt hwm's ability to help you, just a general principle.
2008-11-29T15:12:00.000Z	melodie_	oOarthurOo	I explained all allready and hmw asked the start question to which I allready gave all informations. thks for the concern. :)
2008-11-29T15:14:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	melodie_	hmm... well. I haven't seen you post the output of an "fdisk -l" or "cat /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2008-11-29T15:15:00.000Z	oOarthurOo	melodie_	That would be the first step in fixing grub boot errors... I would think.
2008-11-29T15:15:00.000Z	melodie_	oOarthurOo	I allready said everything
