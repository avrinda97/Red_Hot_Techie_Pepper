2009-05-30T09:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	what happens when you try to connect to the network?
2009-05-30T09:52:00.000Z	spool32	ZykoticK9	*points up*
2009-05-30T09:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	does it Connect to the wireless network ok?
2009-05-30T09:53:00.000Z	spool32	ZykoticK9	with eth0 (wired nic) it works instantly. It appears to connect, at least iwconfig claims that it is seeing the SSID and the AP.
2009-05-30T09:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	is there a network icon in the top right that you can use to connect to wireless networks?  (i don't remember 8.04 very well)
2009-05-30T09:54:00.000Z	spool32	ZykoticK9	there is... I used it to config the card and it looks fine, but the card never receives an IP.
2009-05-30T09:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	IP comes after connecting to the wireless network, which is step 1
2009-05-30T09:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	what wireless security are you using?  have you put in the passkey/phrase into the wireless connection setting?  there must be a way to actually try to connect to wireless networks - do you see a list anywhere?
2009-05-30T09:57:00.000Z	spool32	ZykoticK9	open WEP, and there's a place to enter the key in that network config section. I've done this, both as a hex value and as ascii (it gives me an option to do either).
2009-05-30T09:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	"open WEP"?  what do you mean

2009-05-30T10:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spool32	sorry man i don't have any other ideas?
2009-05-30T10:11:00.000Z	spool32	ZykoticK9	thanks, I appreciate the help.. maybe I'll try moving up to 9.04 and see if it causes a shitstorm with the QA team.
