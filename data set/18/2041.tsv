2011-08-25T00:57:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	#winehq
2011-08-30T09:41:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	php4 is outdated and not in the repos anymore
2011-08-30T10:03:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	why do you want to do that ?
2011-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	what guide ? what are you trying to do ?
2011-08-30T10:07:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	the correct command would be "mysql -u root -p password", password being the one you set as mysql root password (not your user's password)
2011-08-30T10:09:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	what error do you get this time ?
2011-08-30T10:09:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	sorry I mistyped, there's no space between the "-p" and the password
2011-09-01T23:08:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	there is also the "display_errors"
2011-09-01T23:02:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	that's a configuration in your php.ini
2011-09-01T23:03:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	check the value of the "error_reporting" configuration directive in php.ini
2011-09-01T23:04:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	everything you should need is explained in the file itself
2011-09-01T23:06:00.000Z	magnus	glebihan	is it this you mean? error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED
2011-09-01T23:07:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	that's right
2011-09-01T23:08:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	and you have to run 'sudo service apache2 reload' once you're done with modifying the php.ini
2011-09-01T23:10:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	did you also check the "display_errors" directive ?
2011-09-01T23:11:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	same file yes, it should be just below the error_reporting one
2011-09-01T23:13:00.000Z	glebihan	magnus	you're welcome
