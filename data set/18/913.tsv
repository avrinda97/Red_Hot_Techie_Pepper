2012-03-11T20:24:00.000Z	sourcerer		So. First problem was I installed Ubuntu 11.10 to ThinkPad laptop, it installs, but then can't boot. Only windows 7 booted, not GRUB. I found out that it's because of EFI. So, I created EFI-partition on my drive, after it GRUB2 boots and Ubuntu too. But Windows 7 (which is 32-bit) can't boot, writing "Invalid path to EFI" or something like it

2012-03-11T20:27:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	yup
2012-03-11T20:27:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	wow, what thinkpad model?
2012-03-11T20:27:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	e320
2012-03-11T20:29:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	oh, edge series
2012-03-11T20:29:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	so, can I boot Windows 7 32-bit using grub-efi?
2012-03-11T20:30:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	i've never used efi sorry
2012-03-11T20:30:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	any reason it needs to be efi?
2012-03-11T20:31:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	GRUB2 won't boot without EFI.
2012-03-11T20:32:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	that doesn't really make sense, i'm using grub2 fine and i have msdos partition (no efi here)
2012-03-11T20:54:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	i don't understand why you are using efi though
2012-03-11T20:56:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	i tired to install simple GRUB, but it won't work. Then I found that this PC uses UEFI
2012-03-11T20:57:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	ahh, uefi is different to efi
2012-03-11T20:57:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	i thought uefi was only introduced with win8, do they do uefi with win7?
2012-03-11T20:58:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	this laptop is amd64, and Windows 7 64 has support for EFI. But the problem is ... Windows 7 32-bit was preinstalled O_o I can't understand how it was booted at all
2012-03-11T20:59:00.000Z	auronandace	sourcerer	strange, i'd wipe it and reinstall everything on msdos partition table, unless you have a pressing need for uefi
2012-03-11T21:01:00.000Z	sourcerer	auronandace	i tried to disable uefi in bios. After it i can't boot ubuntu neither from usb stick, nor from hd
