2005-08-24T12:19:00.000Z	anna		synaptic package manager rocks!
2005-08-24T12:20:00.000Z	anna		some of us do
2005-08-24T12:20:00.000Z	anna		i do both gui and command line... depending.
2005-08-24T12:21:00.000Z	anna		i was having troulbe with it not going to the x window... but that did it.
2005-08-24T12:21:00.000Z	anna		oh. oh well.
2005-08-24T12:23:00.000Z	anna		so - anyone know if i can get the automagical updating linux-386 on my system without overwriting everything?
2005-08-24T12:25:00.000Z	anna		i'm currently installing ubunt on my DH's new laptop. but i already have it installed on mine
2005-08-24T12:25:00.000Z	anna		and i want to fix it to the "linux-386" kernel
2005-08-24T12:25:00.000Z	anna		cuz when i did it, i selected the linux-386-2.10.5....
2005-08-24T12:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	you can just install the linux-386 package; it should be on the CD, or you can install it from the internet
2005-08-24T12:27:00.000Z	anna	HappyFool	so it should be on symantic?
2005-08-24T12:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	in synaptic, yes
2005-08-24T12:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	i don't know what autoinstall-386 is.
2005-08-24T12:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	i don't think you need it
2005-08-24T12:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	i think if it's on the CD, maybe it uses different rules
2005-08-24T12:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	but i'm not sure
2005-08-24T12:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	anna	read the links ubotu just posted
