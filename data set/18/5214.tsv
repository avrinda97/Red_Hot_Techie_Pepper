2008-11-27T20:10:00.000Z	Trooper2008		is it clear now LjL?
2008-11-27T20:10:00.000Z	Trooper2008		i don't know if the speed has to do with lockit plus my modem router firewall as i set lockit to tight security
2008-11-27T20:11:00.000Z	Trooper2008		you still here LjL?
2008-11-27T20:12:00.000Z	Trooper2008		so why does xp has the option to safe unplug so you don't burn stuff when you remove it LjL btw isen't it strange 8.10 dosen't tell you what device is pluged usb vs all other linux distros ?
2008-11-27T20:12:00.000Z	Trooper2008		i mean i would like it to reconise my usb devises and give me the safe unplug option as it did on older versions or other distros so how can i fix?
2008-11-27T20:14:00.000Z	Trooper2008		yes so you advise me LjL to downgrade to 8.04 as 8.10 seems much buggy?
2008-11-27T20:14:00.000Z	Trooper2008		couse i can't have a distro that dosen't tell of usb devices lol
2008-11-27T20:15:00.000Z	Trooper2008		you know how to fix this as even the most crappy linuxbsd distros tell you usb devices and have safe unplug
2008-11-27T20:15:00.000Z	n8tuser	Trooper2008	-> what made you decide to go to 8.10 upgrade anways?
2008-11-27T20:15:00.000Z	Trooper2008	n8tuser	 i fought it was stable so what you advise n8tuser?
2008-11-27T20:15:00.000Z	n8tuser	Trooper2008	-> it probably have those features to, you just have to do your own homework of searching via google, instead of whining here
2008-11-27T20:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	Trooper2008	-> yes you are whining, go ahead and use google to search for the info you need
2008-11-27T20:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	Trooper2008	-> you have to learn confidence on yourself, decide for yourself :P
2008-11-27T20:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	Trooper2008	-> i dont have a webcam
2008-11-27T20:22:00.000Z	Trooper2008	n8tuser	 what does 8.10 have more then 8.04 ? couse for now it's usefull that everything is auto even when i miss a driver codec etc etc does 8.04 have same automatism?
