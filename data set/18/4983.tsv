2009-03-21T20:46:00.000Z	LakesProse		I want to check the size of my OS (which I intend to copy with dd on another hard drive to use in another computer) but I don't want 'du' to check /media folder because there are other mounted hdd there
2009-03-21T20:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	df -h
2009-03-21T20:47:00.000Z	LakesProse	erUSUL	but won't that also check /media directory ?
2009-03-21T20:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	it list all mounted partitions including / (root) that is what you want to know
2009-03-21T20:49:00.000Z	LakesProse	erUSUL	true but I'd like to know how big  / is without /media (since /media has mounted stuff not on the same  hdd as /)
2009-03-21T20:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	for the third time "df -h" gives that information in one of the lines it outputs.
2009-03-21T20:50:00.000Z	LakesProse	erUSUL	oh sorry! I really really read "du" sorry!
2009-03-21T20:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	you would have wasted less time (mine and yours) just running the command
2009-03-21T20:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	no problem
2009-03-21T21:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	dd works on files representing block devices not on normal directories
2009-03-21T21:06:00.000Z	LakesProse	erUSUL	so no go over nfs then...
2009-03-21T21:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	no
2009-03-21T21:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	you want an image of a partition? use partimage from a livecd ?
2009-03-21T21:08:00.000Z	LakesProse	erUSUL	I have a headless sever which I access via ssh. I want to copy the partition with on which / is mounted over to another harddrive over the network
2009-03-21T21:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	LakesProse	on the headless sever mount a nfs share use partimage and save the image to that share
2009-03-21T21:10:00.000Z	LakesProse	erUSUL	I'd use partimage through ssh ? I mean, partimage would be executed on the headless sever right, not on the destination machine
