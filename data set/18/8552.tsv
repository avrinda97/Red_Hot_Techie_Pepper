2007-08-04T10:00:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	whats the link for setting up aoss in ubuntu
2007-08-04T10:01:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	you mean OSS?
2007-08-04T10:01:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	idk, I use ALSA
2007-08-04T10:01:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	i dont think you have a clue what you are talking about
2007-08-04T10:01:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	You can think whatever you want. This is what the ALSA MAINTAINER for ubuntu has told me.
2007-08-04T10:02:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	any card can have mixing even if its software mixing
2007-08-04T10:04:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	just ask crimsun when he comes on. He's the ALSA maintainer for ubuntu, he'll back me up.
2007-08-04T10:04:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	he explained all this to me on IRC in great detail.
2007-08-04T10:04:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	well if it is true which i doubt. then that sucks
2007-08-04T10:05:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	Like I said, ALSA does have software pcm multiplexing, but it doesnt work as well as Windows/MAC os x, because its not integrated into the kernel
2007-08-04T10:06:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	this is the alsa maintainer's page. https://launchpad.net/~crimsun/ As you can see his nick is crimsun. Ask him when he comes on.
2007-08-04T10:06:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	i know who it is
2007-08-04T10:06:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	im not that worried about it.
2007-08-04T10:07:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	LOL!?!?!?
2007-08-04T10:08:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	hey, his situation was different. And I'm glad it was.
2007-08-04T10:08:00.000Z	N3432	rockets	problem was you did not listen, he said it had worked before.. so obviously it would work again
2007-08-04T10:08:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	Actually I did listen. Once he told me that, I said, Ok good luck then.
2007-08-04T10:09:00.000Z	rockets	N3432	but OTHER PEOPLE continued to argue with me about the general point
