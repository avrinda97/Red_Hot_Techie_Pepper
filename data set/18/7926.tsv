2007-12-27T20:35:00.000Z	Sharpie		my wine iexplore isn't working, i think i deleted some files accidently a while ago. is there a way to reinstall it?
2007-12-27T20:36:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	the wine-config (or is it -configure?) command will repair your $HOME/.wine directory.
2007-12-27T20:37:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	it's neither
2007-12-27T20:38:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	Well, type the assorted collection. It is one of them (type wine- at a shell prompt and hit tab). That worked the last time I used wine (almost a year ago...)
2007-12-27T20:39:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	doesn't exist
2007-12-27T20:40:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	it may have another name, that's why I suggested to try out different commands that start with "wine-" (and gave you  the easiest way to find them out).
2007-12-27T20:40:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	yes, i did that and then i said it didn't exist
2007-12-27T20:41:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	hmmm... Then try "win" as starter (as I told you, haven't used wine in a long while).
2007-12-27T20:42:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	already did that as well, nothing similar
2007-12-27T20:43:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	are you sure you have installed wine at all? The file listing here <http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=wine&version=gutsy&arch=i386> suggests I'm not giving bad advice... ;-)
2007-12-27T20:44:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	my question wasn't "i'm mentally ill and i think i have wine". i use wine on a regular basis (for guitar pro) :/
2007-12-27T20:44:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	btw, the command is wineprefixcreate
2007-12-27T20:45:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	yeah but that's not what i need. i need to remove the gecko ie engine =\
2007-12-27T20:46:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	that's not possible yet. You'll need to move your present .wine file somewhere else and start from scratch. (You should have stated that up front :-))
2007-12-27T20:46:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	ok, well, nvm then
2007-12-27T20:47:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	there is a script out there that will allow you to install IE6 in a different directory. You can install your other software there then.
2007-12-27T20:47:00.000Z	Vorbote	Sharpie	but I don't recall the name, :-(
2007-12-27T20:47:00.000Z	Sharpie	Vorbote	my problem wasn't a non-functional ie (i just use ies4linux). i just wanted to remove/fix the gecko engine
