2005-09-08T14:04:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	hold the ctrl key, press teh alt key and hold it, then press f3
2005-09-08T14:05:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	ctrl-alt-f7 will get you back here
2005-09-08T14:20:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	why are you not using the nvidia drivers from the repos?
2005-09-08T14:21:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	znh is pulling your leg
2005-09-08T14:21:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	you can use whatever method you are comfortable with
2005-09-08T14:23:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	synaptic is a point and click interface to apt-get. aptitude is a console frontend to apt-get.
2005-09-08T14:23:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	apt-get can be run by itself (without a frontend)
2005-09-08T14:40:00.000Z	Nalioth	Sil4kka	if you go to ubuntuguide, come in here and get a 2nd opinion on anything you find there b4 you follow it, it can lead you to a broken ubuntu
