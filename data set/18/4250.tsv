2009-09-20T01:16:00.000Z	LogicFan		hi, i'm trying to mount a windows share on my ubuntu 9.04 machine and everytime I try to mount I get a "mount error(112): Host is down" error.  yet the machine is pingable and is up
2009-09-20T01:16:00.000Z	LogicFan		i've read though most of the samba docs on the wiki and forums, but nothing is turning up
2009-09-20T01:16:00.000Z	Callum_	LogicFan	what command are you using to mount it?
2009-09-20T01:18:00.000Z	LogicFan	Callum_	sudo mount -t cifs
2009-09-20T01:19:00.000Z	LogicFan		but actually, i've already added the whole string to /etc/fstab
2009-09-20T01:19:00.000Z	LogicFan		but whether i use fstab or not doesn't seem to matter.  i get the same error
2009-09-20T01:20:00.000Z	Callum_	LogicFan	Are you connecting to the IP address of the machine or the machine's name on the network?
2009-09-20T01:20:00.000Z	Callum_		I find that the IP address works better than connecting to the hostname
2009-09-20T01:20:00.000Z	LogicFan	Callum_	i've tried both.  i have set the hosts file to resolve the name to the proper ip too to no avail
2009-09-20T01:21:00.000Z	Callum_		"sudo mount -t cifs //10.1.1.3/Callum /mnt/Callum" is an example of what I use
2009-09-20T01:21:00.000Z	LogicFan	Callum_	right, i have similar
2009-09-20T01:21:00.000Z	LogicFan		but whether i issue the command manually or use fstab, resolve the hostname or use the ip, i get the same error
2009-09-20T01:22:00.000Z	Callum_		and in /etc/fstab "//10.1.1.3/Callum /mnt/Callum cifs credentials=/mnt/.cred 0 0" and in /mnt/.cred is "username=username<newline>password=password"
2009-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	LogicFan	Callum_	yes, i have that set
2009-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	Callum_	LogicFan	You don't need to put a line in /etc/fstab for it to mount...
2009-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	Callum_	LogicFan	Its probably your Windows machine causing problems then
2009-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	LogicFan	Callum_	i realize, but to automount you do.  i've tried both.
2009-09-20T01:24:00.000Z	LogicFan	Callum_	any suggestions?
