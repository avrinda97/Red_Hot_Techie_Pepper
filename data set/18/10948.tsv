2006-10-03T09:37:00.000Z	orestyle3		Is software raid faster than hardware raid....
2006-10-03T09:38:00.000Z	xav_	orestyle3	faster? why would it be?
2006-10-03T09:39:00.000Z	orestyle3		Well, I have a old dual 733 processor dell and a dual amd 64 process or hp and when testing they are only 20 seconds apart (on hardware one software)
2006-10-03T09:40:00.000Z	xav_	orestyle3	maybe you need to compare something comparable ?
2006-10-03T09:40:00.000Z	xav_	orestyle3	on the pc where you are using hardware raid, switch to software and see what the difference is
2006-10-03T09:41:00.000Z	orestyle3	xav_	from what dell says the software raid smokes the hardware raid.  I understand the software is better
2006-10-03T09:42:00.000Z	orestyle3	xav_	I would but my HP does not allow me to disable the onboard raid controller.  I would have to purchase another HBA...
2006-10-03T09:42:00.000Z	orestyle3	xav_	 I tried to configure it with SWR but got errors on the installation.
2006-10-03T09:42:00.000Z	xav_	orestyle3	onboard raid controller isn't hardware raid
2006-10-03T09:44:00.000Z	orestyle3	xav_	from HP its called an integrated array smart 6i controller
2006-10-03T09:44:00.000Z	orestyle3	xav_	that must be why I can disable it on the dell system, not on the HP..
2006-10-03T09:48:00.000Z	xav_		OH SHIT
2006-10-03T09:49:00.000Z	xav_		motherfuckin car

2006-10-03T09:49:00.000Z	xav_		DIE CAR DIE
2006-10-03T09:49:00.000Z	xav_		fuckin moron car user, die too
