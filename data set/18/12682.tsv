2006-11-23T15:53:00.000Z	urmom		if im on a mac how can i setup the keyboard to act normally?
2006-11-23T15:53:00.000Z	urmom		like it does in macosx
2006-11-23T15:54:00.000Z	urmom		can anyone help me?
2006-11-23T15:55:00.000Z	sn9	urmom	define "normally"
2006-11-23T15:56:00.000Z	urmom	sn9	as in ctrl click, using the apple key to copy etc
2006-11-23T15:56:00.000Z	urmom	sn9	and having shift make the letters capital
2006-11-23T15:56:00.000Z	sn9	urmom	that is possible, but really hard to set up, and IMO, not worth it
2006-11-23T15:56:00.000Z	urmom		well ok
2006-11-23T15:57:00.000Z	urmom		but there is one important thing
2006-11-23T15:57:00.000Z	urmom	sn9	i need shift to actually work
2006-11-23T15:57:00.000Z	sn9	urmom	shift always works
2006-11-23T15:57:00.000Z	urmom		not for me
2006-11-23T15:57:00.000Z	sn9	urmom	which mac?
2006-11-23T15:57:00.000Z	urmom	sn9	when i try to use shift it just doesnt type the letter
2006-11-23T15:58:00.000Z	urmom	sn9	im using an ibook g4
2006-11-23T15:58:00.000Z	sn9	urmom	that's really weird
2006-11-23T15:58:00.000Z	urmom	sn9	well can i fix it?
2006-11-23T15:59:00.000Z	sn9	urmom	i can't even think of why it would do that; shift works fine on other ppl's ibook g4's
