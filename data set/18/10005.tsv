2007-03-11T06:49:00.000Z	matthew1429		anyone any good with ffmpeg?  I just want to convert an asf file into mp3
2007-03-11T06:49:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	I thought asf was a video file container
2007-03-11T06:50:00.000Z	matthew1429	bruenig	it is, but vlc will only save audio it rips from online to this format successfully
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	you should write it
2007-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	that particular approach would be fine, installing feisty which is alpha is itself risky
2007-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	matthew1429	bruenig	risky for security reasons or stability?
2007-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	stability
2007-03-11T07:16:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	if you have nothing to lose then by all means go with feisty, in fact use xubuntu feisty, they need some testers desperately
2007-03-11T07:16:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	older computers or greater
2007-03-11T07:17:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	it contains different things, like abiword instead of open office. It has the ubuntu repos though so you can get whatever you want.
2007-03-11T07:18:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	yeah christmas and ultimate you mean
2007-03-11T07:19:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	I have never tried them, I thought it was kind of odd
2007-03-11T07:19:00.000Z	matthew1429	bruenig	are they just ubuntu with other stuff preinstalled?
2007-03-11T07:19:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	from the looks of it
2007-03-23T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	use cron
2007-03-23T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	basically the idea is to have a media player open a music file. If you can select the media player and file and the time of day you want, I or someone else can help with the cronjob
2007-03-25T07:42:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	why are you mounting a mount point
2007-03-25T08:20:00.000Z	bruenig	matthew1429	yeah pastebinning your /etc/fstab, would be a good start
