2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		ahh, crumbs, sorry FloodBot!
2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		ok, I'll try again
2012-10-28T20:33:00.000Z	jfries		@hhzzzarn: the network is up, but for some reason the machine won't connect to it, hence I can't upgrade
2012-10-28T20:34:00.000Z	jfries		even when I plug in the cable directly
2012-10-28T20:35:00.000Z	jfries		hi hhhzzdarn! yeah, it doesn't connect
2012-10-28T20:36:00.000Z	jfries		(but take into account this is from the maintenance shell, so something has gone wrong ahead of time)
2012-10-28T20:37:00.000Z	jfries		ok, thanks anyway hhhzzzarn
2012-10-28T20:38:00.000Z	jfries		the files aren't a huge deal, but I was hoping there was some way to complete the upgrade
2012-10-28T20:40:00.000Z	jfries		right now the problem (as I perceive it) is that I am not able to run apt-get update because it can't connect to the network. so I am treating this like a network configuration problem, and once I fix that I'll go back to worrying about finishing the upgrade
2012-10-28T20:42:00.000Z	jfries		so, if NetworkManager isn't running, and /etc/network/interfaces doesn't contain an entry for eth0, then it seems like it won't be able to connect to the network, no?
2012-10-28T20:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jfries	correct
2012-10-28T20:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jfries	what do want to do run with or without network-manager?
2012-10-28T20:49:00.000Z	jfries	BluesKaj	I don't' have a strong preference. I've been using network-manager in the past, sometimes getting annoyed at it. I'd rather learn how to handle things from the command line rather than relying on an applet, if that can be recommended.
2012-10-28T20:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jfries	command line isn't necessary , /etc/network/interfaces , and  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head (which writes to /etc/resolv.conf ) , can handle most network management , with network manager removed from the pc.
2012-10-28T20:56:00.000Z	jfries	BluesKaj	in etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf it says [ifupdown] managed=false  so does that mean that network manager is already disabled? if not, how do I disable it
2012-10-28T20:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jfries	not sure because i just remove network manager from my pc.
2012-10-28T21:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jfries	sudo dhclient eth0
2012-10-28T21:04:00.000Z	jfries	BluesKaj	thanks for your help during the time you had!! :)
