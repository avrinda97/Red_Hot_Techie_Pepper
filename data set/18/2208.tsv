2010-08-11T18:53:00.000Z	whompapotamus	mahioo	Start by removing Nautilus and installing Nautilus Elementary
2010-08-11T18:53:00.000Z	whompapotamus	mahioo	You will grab a second or two performance boost
2010-08-11T18:54:00.000Z	mahioo	whompapotamus	do you mean that nautilus is need more performance
2010-08-11T18:55:00.000Z	whompapotamus	mahioo	Nautilus is bloated
2010-08-11T18:56:00.000Z	mahioo	whompapotamus	ah so the pb in nautilus
2010-08-11T18:57:00.000Z	whompapotamus	mahioo	Not necessarily - probably have too many daemons up and running as well
2010-08-11T18:59:00.000Z	mahioo	whompapotamus	such what !!
2010-08-11T19:02:00.000Z	whompapotamus	mahioo	That all depends - cups, webmin, hal, etc. Don't know your configuration? Could be a video driver - the list for figuring it out is beyond the time I can spend with you - I think it was mentioned - but try a minimal distro (you may find your performance enhanced there?)
2010-08-11T19:04:00.000Z	mahioo	whompapotamus	ok thank you for help
