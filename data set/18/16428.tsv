2010-01-30T08:07:00.000Z	denisp12		my middle button is a wheel
2010-01-30T08:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 try the up arrow key also. proberly a history feature
2010-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 i would suggest to not use hibernate/suspend  Unless you REALLY need it. it can cause issues with some hardware.
2010-01-30T08:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 my screensaver and stuff work fine. its the hibernate/suspend special features that oiften have propblems
2010-01-30T08:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 i leave my pc's on for weeks at a time.
2010-01-30T08:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 or i shutdown/reboot - given its about a 30 sec boot time for me.. its not a big deal
2010-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 pastebinit is a command you inztall.
2010-01-30T08:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 you may want to 'reinstall' and make your swap partion larger. if you must use hibernate/suspend
2010-01-30T08:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	:  i would say - not use hibernate/suspend untill you get more linux skills learned then. and can attempt a reisntall. a 'fix' of this might be just as hard if not harder then a reinstall
2010-01-30T08:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 there is no 'magical one command' to fix it.
2010-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 time to learn more linux basics then untill its not gibberish.. or try to do a reinstall.
2010-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	denisp12	 reinstall or 'resize' the existing partitions. are the 2 options
