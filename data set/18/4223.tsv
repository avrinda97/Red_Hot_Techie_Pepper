2009-05-18T17:23:00.000Z	supersasho		hi.. i've just upgraded to 9.04.. the progress bar makes it to the end, and when i expect the Xserver, it doesn't start, the screen is blank, can't even get to shell with ctrl+alt+f1.. any ideas?
2009-05-18T17:23:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	there are some GRUB options for making the kernel more verbose when booting
2009-05-18T17:25:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	eg. removing 'quiet' and 'splash' from the entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-05-18T17:25:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	done that allready
2009-05-18T17:25:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	everythings goes [OK]
2009-05-18T17:25:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	then you shouldn't be seeing a progress bar
2009-05-18T17:25:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	ah
2009-05-18T17:26:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	is it freezing completely?  can you ping it?  can you Ctrl+C anything that's running?
2009-05-18T17:26:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	i've allready tried to change fglrx driver to vesa, no effect.. also adding vga=791 to boot kernel line didnt helped either
2009-05-18T17:27:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	nope, i cant do nothing, not even go to shell.. none of the hotkeys i know helped (ctrl+c ctrl+alt+backspace ctrl+alt+f*)
2009-05-18T17:28:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	I'm not sure whether you're saying the boot process is halting, or X is not working
2009-05-18T17:29:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	sacarlson:  my xorg.conf http://pastebin.com/m47dcbf66
2009-05-18T17:29:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	try running without an xorg.conf
2009-05-18T17:29:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	it boots all fine i guess, i think the problem is X, but i'm not sure
2009-05-18T17:30:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	OK, until now I thought you were saying it wouldn't even boot in "safe" mode
2009-05-18T17:32:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	it just freeze after the whole progress bar is full.. or with no splash, it starts all deamons and when it should go to desktop it just go blank and nothing can be done
2009-05-18T17:32:00.000Z	ozzmosis	supersasho	the progress bar doesn't use X, afaik
2009-05-18T17:33:00.000Z	supersasho	ozzmosis	it does not
