2006-10-19T14:01:00.000Z	savje		I've got a divided rar archive, and when I try to unrar it I get the following error message: "Archivetype is not supported", do I need another unpacking program to unpack it?
2006-10-19T14:02:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	try unrar from rarlabs... then issue this command: unrar e ~myuser/path_to_rar.rarX (take the first in the part-serie)
2006-10-19T14:16:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	type wget http://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-3.6.0.tar.gz or surf there. then download it, and tar zxvf file.tar.gz then run "unrar" program with ./unrar e file.rarX (first of the partfiles)
2006-10-19T14:19:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	have you extract the files from the arhive?
2006-10-19T14:20:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	yes. ok enter that folder then type ./unrar and see what happends.. if it's starting at all..
2006-10-19T14:21:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	yup that program is a console-application
2006-10-19T14:22:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	then type ./unrar e _path_to_rarfiles/rarfile.r00
2006-10-19T14:26:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	great, enjoy
2006-10-19T14:27:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	if you want to extract the files to an other place then the directory you are in issue this command: ./unrar x path_to_file.rar00 /path/to/where/to/extract
2006-10-19T14:32:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	try export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games:/home/myusername/path_to_rar_folder/
2006-10-19T14:34:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	or do like this: sudo cp /path/to/rar/unrar /usr/local/bin and also the same command but for "rar"
2006-10-19T14:35:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	it will extend your PATH so that it will include the unrar and rar program when typing it in the console
2006-10-19T14:36:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	correct.
2006-10-19T14:39:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	well then you have to have the program in your homedirectory and put it chmod -R 700 rarfolder/ then use the export command..
2006-10-19T14:45:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	you wont need that if you have VLC :)
2006-10-19T14:47:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	have you tried it with MPlayer ?
2006-10-19T14:54:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	did you have mplayer at all?
2006-10-19T14:58:00.000Z	cappe_	savje	cheers enjoy your movie :) (it's night time in sweden)
