2006-08-28T16:50:00.000Z	factotum		if i did a server install is there a meta-package of sorts to get the general ubuntu desktop installed or do I have to start over?
2006-08-28T16:50:00.000Z	factotum		not start over, but hunt down appropriate packages
2006-08-28T16:51:00.000Z	factotum		hah! took a wild guess and typed ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-28T16:51:00.000Z	factotum		whodah thunk
2006-08-28T16:51:00.000Z	factotum		pfft
2006-08-28T05:16:00.000Z	factotum		so, if i install the ubuntu-desktop metapackage, does that mean i cant individually uninstall an app i might not want?
2006-08-28T05:16:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	you can
2006-08-28T05:17:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	once you install the ubuntu-desktop package with synaptic or apt-get it's ok to uninstall the package
2006-08-28T05:18:00.000Z	factotum	pianoboy3333	just the entire metapackage its self, or can i select individual applications as well?
2006-08-28T05:18:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	what are you trying to achieve?
2006-08-28T05:19:00.000Z	factotum	pianoboy3333	Ill make an example, say i like ubuntu but i try out something like fluxbox for an X11 environment. If I ended up liking it enough to not even want gnome on my hard drive anymore, could i uninstall it once I know what packages to get rid of?
2006-08-28T05:20:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	yes
2006-08-28T05:21:00.000Z	factotum	pianoboy3333	alright, thats what i was wondering about because i thought i had issues uninstalling something that was installed through a meta-package like the app was dependant by the system as a whole, which was completely untrue
2006-08-28T05:22:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	no, it's ok to uninstall something like gimp, that will remove ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	factotum	pianoboy3333	wow, that makes absolutely no sense at all. Thanks for the warning
2006-08-28T05:24:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	yea, I'm not exactly sure what your talking about, and your not exactly sure what I'm talking about, but in the end it all works out, welcome to the opensource world of linux, ubuntu and gnu
2006-08-28T05:25:00.000Z	factotum	pianoboy3333	so what your saying is if i where to uninstall GIMP, it would also install gnome and everything else in the ubuntu-desktop metapackage?
2006-08-28T05:26:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	factotum	no, exactly the opposite, it would uninstall the package named ubuntu-desktop, but that's it, gnome would be fine, and everything would be fine, as long as you don't use aptitude remove
