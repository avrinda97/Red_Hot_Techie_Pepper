2004-10-04T15:17:00.000Z	krischan		Yes, although something I'm not used to: sudo is already configured. On my old distro I always wanted to configure it, but never came around to it.
2004-10-04T15:18:00.000Z	krischan		Well, but the point is: some graphical configuration tools ask for root password, and there my user password is accepted. Isn't that strange?
2004-10-04T15:20:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	if they explicitly say "root password", please file a bug; they should mostly say something like "please enter your password to gain root access"
2004-10-04T15:21:00.000Z	krischan	Kamion	I'll check it to be certain ...
2004-10-04T15:24:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	right, that's fine I think
2004-10-04T15:32:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	that's what the 'universe' component is for (unsupported, though)
2004-10-04T15:32:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	it's basically Debian compiled against Ubuntu
2004-10-04T15:37:00.000Z	krischan	Kamion	I see, I have to make myself familiar with these main/restricted/universe components, thanks for the hint.
2004-10-08T09:38:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	yes it does in bugzilla
2004-10-08T09:38:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	the word is overloaded
2004-10-08T09:39:00.000Z	krischan	Kamion	oops, I didn't know that! I thought so because of the component-concept that's driven by Ubuntu.
2004-10-08T09:39:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	that use of 'component' comes from the Debian archive layout
2004-10-08T09:40:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	unfortunately any time you try to come up with names for different collections of packages, you find there are only so many words to use and name clashes tend to arise ...
2004-10-08T09:41:00.000Z	krischan	Kamion	I see. And the Linux world hasn't come to an agreement about that yet?
2004-10-08T09:41:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	it's not really subject to agreement
2004-10-08T09:42:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	there are all sorts of things you want to call things in different contexts
2004-10-08T09:42:00.000Z	Kamion	krischan	language is ambiguous :-)
2004-10-08T09:43:00.000Z	krischan	Kamion	yes, that's gift and curse! :)
