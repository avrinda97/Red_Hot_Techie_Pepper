2008-06-02T16:13:00.000Z	mr_boo		do i just go in synaptic and install nfs to enable file sharing?
2008-06-02T16:13:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	what are you trying to do?
2008-06-02T16:19:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	just repeat what you did on the xbuntu box i would think :)
2008-06-02T16:19:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	i sorted it out, it was even easier in ubuntu than xubuntu
2008-06-02T16:20:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	and what did you have to do in xubuntu that differed then buntu?
2008-06-02T16:21:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	in xubuntu i had to set it up to enable network file share as in ubuntu it was enabled by default
2008-06-02T16:22:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	settings settings settings it's always something simple isn't it
2008-06-02T16:23:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	was proably ALOT easier then any other machines you networked i bet :)
2008-06-02T16:48:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	are you using a hub or switch?
2008-06-02T16:48:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	hub
2008-06-02T16:49:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	both machines are connected to the same gateway
2008-06-02T16:49:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	uh, you said hub or switch
2008-06-02T16:49:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	it might be a router i've got
2008-06-02T16:49:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	been though that bull crap many times buy a switch and use seperate card for it
2008-06-02T16:50:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	the only folder that appears when i try to access the machine is "PRINT$"
2008-06-02T16:51:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	check that you can ping both machines on both computers FIRST.. if thats a go your fine if not get a timeout error you need to check network equpment
2008-06-02T16:51:00.000Z	mr_boo	niner64	a splendid idea
2008-06-02T16:52:00.000Z	niner64	mr_boo	that sounds like kinda wierd a port to plug a network print server read your router docs
