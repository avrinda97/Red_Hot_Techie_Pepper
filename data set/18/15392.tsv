2007-04-22T15:18:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		now all I see is a blinking cursor
2007-04-22T15:18:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		:P
2007-04-22T15:18:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		should I start a complete reinstall of everything? :)
2007-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		hm
2007-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		so there's still hope? :D
2007-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		you're fantastic guys
2007-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		all this happened just after I finally got everything working ok
2007-04-22T15:20:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		reinstalling and tweaking everything again would be a pain in the ass :P
2007-04-22T15:20:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		so, what should I do now? sudo gpart?
2007-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	Seb3DGE		so.. sudo testdisk instead?
2007-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	atrus	Seb3DGE	fwiw, last time i was in a position like that, 'parted' found all my partitions and rewrote the partition table appropriately.
2007-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	atrus	Seb3DGE	/ mwe: no, but parted, its console-based cousin  can.
2007-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	atrus	Seb3DGE	google pointed me at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=146705
2007-04-22T15:27:00.000Z	atrus	Seb3DGE	you can read the man page for parted and see if that helps, but you probabbly want to make sure you've got somebody familiar to help when you do it.
2007-04-22T15:28:00.000Z	atrus	Seb3DGE	gpart looks pretty good too though.
