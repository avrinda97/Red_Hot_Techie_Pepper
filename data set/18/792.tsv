2011-09-09T01:35:00.000Z	beached		hello, anyone willing to try and help me with an ssh problem
2011-09-09T01:36:00.000Z	beached		I installed openssh on this box and was able to connect from internal boxes but not external
2011-09-09T01:37:00.000Z	beached		I opened up port 22 on my router and forward it to my ip
2011-09-09T01:37:00.000Z	beached		and now am able to ssh from external boxes but no longer am able to ssh from internal boxes
2011-09-09T01:38:00.000Z	beached		it is
2011-09-09T01:38:00.000Z	beached		open
2011-09-09T01:38:00.000Z	beached		and i have had a few people log on from other states
2011-09-09T01:38:00.000Z	beached		with success
2011-09-09T01:39:00.000Z	beached		and I have tried ssh 192.168.1.xxx as well as the external IP
2011-09-09T01:39:00.000Z	beached		from the internal box without prevail
2011-09-09T01:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	beached	"grep ListenAddress /etc/ssh/sshd_config" is it commented out? OR does it have an IP there?
2011-09-09T01:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	beached	that's fine, it's commented out (as it should be, in your case)
2011-09-09T01:46:00.000Z	beached	zykotick9	i don't see why opening a port on my router would effect internal
2011-09-09T01:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	beached	it shouldn't... sorry i have no other suggestions/ideas...
2011-09-09T01:59:00.000Z	beached	zykotick9	any chance u can pm me?
2011-09-15T07:42:00.000Z	beached	zykotick9	v 173
2011-09-15T07:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	beached	does nvidia-settings give you a version number in use?  If so, disregard the addition drivers message.  If not, then it's not working right currently.
2011-09-15T07:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	beached	sorry, i have "personally" never gotten 173 to work on any system I've tried them on.  Hope you have better luck then me!
