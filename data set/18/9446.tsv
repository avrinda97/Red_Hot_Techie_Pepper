2007-12-06T12:23:00.000Z	ztomic	Jack_Sparrow	you don't have problems with your's?
2007-12-06T12:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ztomic	Since Dell and MS sleep together I would not hold out hope for a fix going back to that hardware.
2007-12-06T12:23:00.000Z	ztomic	Jack_Sparrow	ubuntu is on dell now... where have you been?
2007-12-06T12:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ztomic	Never had any issues that I noticed.
2007-12-06T12:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ztomic	I am aware... that they have Ubuntu now.. then they didnt.. and MS will still have an inside track on a lot of that hardware
2007-12-06T12:25:00.000Z	ztomic	Jack_Sparrow	MS is everywhere
2007-12-08T06:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ztomic	please dont use rt... in here
