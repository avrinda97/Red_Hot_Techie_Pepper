2012-03-02T23:01:00.000Z	pestilence		could somebody verify this for me:  when you hit alt+f2, then type in empathy, it shows empathy-accounts...if you hit enter it opens up empathy accounts
2012-03-02T23:02:00.000Z	pestilence		on the other hand if you type in just "empath" and hit enter, it opens up empathy
2012-03-02T23:02:00.000Z	pestilence		(file this in the what in the everliving fuck category)
2012-03-02T23:03:00.000Z	pestilence		is there anybody running ubuntu in here who could verify that?
2012-03-02T23:04:00.000Z	pestilence		it boggles my mind that i can type the name of a program in /usr/bin into the alt+f2 dialogue and it opens up something entirely different
2012-03-02T23:05:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	you may have an identically named program earlier on our command path than /usr/bin. /usr/local/bin, for example.
2012-03-02T23:06:00.000Z	pestilence	Zal	no, i do not.  it is opening "empathy-accounts" when i type in "empathy".  empathy-accounts is in /usr/bin also.
2012-03-02T23:07:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	it's probably grabbing the first search result when you hit enter. Try using the search button one time instead, so that it stops jumping automatically to empathy-accounts
2012-03-02T23:07:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	that is, click the search button, instead of hitting "enter"
2012-03-02T23:07:00.000Z	pestilence	Zal	it doesn't even show empathy in the results.  it only shows empathy-accounts
2012-03-02T23:07:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	hence my suggestion
2012-03-02T23:08:00.000Z	pestilence	Zal	where is the search button?  I don't see that when i hit alt+f2
2012-03-02T23:08:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	using Gnome? Sorry, I don't know what it looks like, I prefer KDE
2012-03-02T23:08:00.000Z	pestilence	Zal	ubuntu uses unity...
2012-03-02T23:09:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	<shrug> I only use ubuntu on headless servers
2012-03-02T23:09:00.000Z	pestilence		i guess i'm more flabbergasted at such a horrible, horrible bug.  it doesn't even offer up "empathy" when I type "empathy"!
2012-03-02T23:10:00.000Z	pestilence		what if somebody sneaky were able to get a program called gksudo-haxxor_your_boxxer into your path
2012-03-02T23:10:00.000Z	Zal	pestilence	I think you're missing the point of the dropdown. It looks for items previously typed probably, and does not search your command path necessarily.
