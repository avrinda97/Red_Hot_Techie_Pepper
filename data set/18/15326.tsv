2005-09-11T07:41:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	I am in my user root
2005-09-11T07:42:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	Then also please check that there is no nautilus or any other application accessing /media/windows
2005-09-11T07:44:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	I can't find anything accessing /medis/windows/
2005-09-11T07:46:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	I don't see any reason for the problem then. Can you specify the command you gave?
2005-09-11T07:47:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	sudo mount /dev/hdb    with fstab /dev/hdb        /media/windows  ntfs    nls=utf8,umask=0222   0       0
2005-09-11T07:49:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	should be hdb1, sorry!
2005-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	It is not about what he wants to play. He wants to play files on network storage.
2005-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	He would still need to be able to play the stream?
2005-10-23T07:03:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	then why don't you add it yourself?
2005-10-23T07:05:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	It was, and should be using the new drive, the old drive did not have any room left on it. I have been FLACing all my cds... THat is why I am confused!
2005-10-23T07:07:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	Don't know how to help
2005-10-23T07:09:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	WHat should the fstab read?
2005-10-23T07:10:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	Paste your fstab in pastebin and then I may help you
2005-10-23T07:11:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3286 :)
2005-10-23T07:14:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	Try adding  /dev/hdb1 (whatever partition)/homeext3auto 0 0 to fstab
2005-10-23T07:14:00.000Z	selinium	onkarshinde	Cheers
2005-10-23T07:14:00.000Z	onkarshinde	selinium	I mean: /dev/hdb1 (whatever partition)/homeext3auto 0 0
