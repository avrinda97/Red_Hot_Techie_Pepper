2010-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	bawn		usually that means you need to turn down your volume software wise
2010-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	bawn		trea sure
2010-11-16T06:22:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	mind if I im you, I've got all the details of the last time i ran through the setup
2010-11-16T06:22:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	huh?
2010-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	when I went through the setup on Ubuntu to dual boot it I got to the screen where I allocate the drive space.  It showed my devices in there, I selected /dev/sda which should be the hard drive as a whole.  I said install it said, "No root file system is defined.  Please correct this from partitioning menu"
2010-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	that is sorta warning you that you will be using the whole harddrive for single boot
2010-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	ok then which of the devices should I select to get it partitioned?  I also tried to select /dev/sda2 but no luck either, same error
2010-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	can you take the free space from one of the partitions, and make a new partition with it for ubuntu?
2010-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	and make a new partition
2010-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	i selected /dev/sda2 and said change the partition size of that one, is that where I would do that?  As I was looking the add button was greyed out at this point
2010-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	you make one partition smaller, while you make room for a new one
2010-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	ok when I went in there I can change the size, but the other options is where I got confused in there
2010-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	what would I want to use the partition as?  It gave me a drop down list of options
2010-11-16T06:33:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	when I change the size of the drive to partition, lets say I drop it to 225000 then the left over should become a free partition for me to install ubuntu on?  and if so what do I want to use that partition as when I go into the change menu?
2010-11-16T06:34:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	you should see some grey area, and you can create a new ext3 or ext4 partition for that new empty space
2010-11-16T06:35:00.000Z	bawn	Trea	the leftover, essentially is nothing, with no partition whatsoever, unless if you create a new one, or expand the old one
2010-11-16T06:35:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	ok doesn't matter which one I select then?
2010-11-16T06:36:00.000Z	Trea	bawn	ok thank you very much I'm gonna give it another go now
