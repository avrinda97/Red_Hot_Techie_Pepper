2012-01-28T10:50:00.000Z	Blue1		semitones it can be as little as 4G (not recommended) -- i made / 50G and I am using 50% so that will probably do well.
2012-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	Blue1		yeah that's a very odd size indeed.
2012-01-28T10:52:00.000Z	Blue1		semitones you can get by with 10G, although I have installed ubuntu onto a usb drive of 8G (with x) and had no issues.
2012-01-28T10:53:00.000Z	Blue1		what ejv said
2012-01-28T10:55:00.000Z	Blue1		:-)
2012-01-28T10:56:00.000Z	Blue1		debian is very hard to configure
2012-01-28T10:56:00.000Z	Blue1		but I have sucessfully done it.
2012-01-28T10:58:00.000Z	Blue1		but hey if sarcasam is your suit, I'll bow out now.  we'll help you, but please don't cop an attitude.
2012-01-28T10:59:00.000Z	Blue1		indeed
2012-01-28T10:59:00.000Z	hydrox24	Blue1	I reckon
2012-02-02T11:34:00.000Z	Blue1	hydrox24	if those are internal speakers - I never got them to work.
2012-02-02T11:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	Blue1	will be to do with the ntpupdate command
2012-02-02T11:35:00.000Z	Blue1	hydrox24	I am trying to debug a line in a script I am developing - it just hangs at that point, writes a zero length file, script never ends.
2012-02-02T11:36:00.000Z	hydrox24	Blue1	perhaps it
2012-02-02T11:36:00.000Z	hydrox24	Blue1	perhaps the file that tee is piping to doesn't exist?
2012-02-02T11:37:00.000Z	Blue1	hydrox24	shouldn't care it should create it.
2012-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	hydrox24	Blue1	are you able to pipe it using ">" or ">>" (to append) without root privileges?
2012-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	Blue1	hydrox24	no, that is the issue
