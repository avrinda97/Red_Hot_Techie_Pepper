2011-06-10T02:02:00.000Z	Tetracomm		Hello.
2011-06-10T02:03:00.000Z	Tetracomm		I installed Ubuntu using Wubi in Windows 7 Home Premium but I cannot access files that are outside of Ubuntu's "filesystem" and I really need to access Windows partition files. Help?
2011-06-10T02:04:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	it's located in /host
2011-06-10T02:08:00.000Z	Tetracomm	julie	Thank you, I hope it works. :)
2011-06-10T21:03:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	please send us your output through http://paste.ubuntu.com as mentioned by the bot
2011-06-10T21:04:00.000Z	Tetracomm	julie	That is all I got, and I only typed fsck.
2011-06-10T21:05:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	we didn't see the whole output

2011-06-10T21:11:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	the fixes made couldn't affect your directory listings but these errors are still a bit abnormal
2011-06-10T21:12:00.000Z	Tetracomm	julie	Ok, It is a Wubi setup. I installed it through Windows 7.
2011-06-10T21:13:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	that doesn't really matter, but do you always shut it down properly or did it perhaps crash recently?
2011-06-10T21:14:00.000Z	Tetracomm	julie	There were a few power outages this week.
2011-06-10T21:15:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	that explains it...  I would recommend you do a full disk check with "e2fsck -f device" in recovery mode
2011-06-10T21:16:00.000Z	Tetracomm	julie	I wonder what device in this Wubi installation is. This is my first Wubi one.
2011-06-10T21:17:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	your partition is in /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk
2011-06-10T21:18:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	I'm not 100% sure what will get mounted in recovery mode.... you may need to mount your windows partition first

2011-06-10T21:25:00.000Z	julie	Tetracomm	did you run that with root mounted?  and did you restart after?
