2006-11-20T08:17:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka		I would be a bit surprised to have no way to do it in kubuntu as it was fairly trivial in freebsd to do this
2006-11-20T08:17:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka		but mcphail said there was no way ... wonder what makes it so difficult
2006-11-20T08:19:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	what are we talking about?
2006-11-20T08:19:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	I have an amd64 OS installed and want to migrate to an x86 OS in-place (I'm out of spare disks)
2006-11-20T08:20:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	do you have lots of customized stuff yet? (configs, personal files, etc)
2006-11-20T08:21:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	a bit, yeah
2006-11-20T08:22:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	alright, should I save that to a file somewhere?
2006-11-20T08:22:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	dpkg -l output?
2006-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	no non-full partitions (only 2 partitions total)
2006-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	how much space on each?
2006-11-20T08:26:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	about 2GB on one and 8GB free on the one that I have ubuntu installed on
2006-11-20T08:26:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	hmm ... how much data do you need to back up?
2006-11-20T08:27:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	about 30GB
2006-11-20T08:34:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	here's a bad idea ... change the repos to the 32bit ones and then apt-get distupgrade ...
2006-11-20T08:34:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	I would not try the above
2006-11-20T08:54:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	eh? are you sure that the module is not being loaded?
2006-11-20T08:55:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	slavik	quite sure it's not loadable
2006-11-20T08:55:00.000Z	slavik	Aji-Dahaka	drivers = modules = have to be loaded
