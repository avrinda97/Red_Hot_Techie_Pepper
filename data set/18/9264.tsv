2007-04-28T12:43:00.000Z	Parmenion	larryone	nope
2007-04-28T12:44:00.000Z	larryone	Parmenion	I've done an apt-get update and my sources.list is fine, how do I point it to a different repo...  is it likely my nearest mirror is having trouble?
2007-04-28T12:44:00.000Z	Parmenion	larryone	probably
2007-04-28T12:45:00.000Z	larryone	Parmenion	thanks
2007-04-28T12:45:00.000Z	Parmenion	larryone	open up synaptic > settings > repositories > select best server
2007-04-28T12:46:00.000Z	Parmenion	larryone	click download from> other server > select best server
2007-04-28T12:47:00.000Z	larryone	Parmenion	the only servers liasted there seem to be my irish mirrors
2007-04-28T12:48:00.000Z	Parmenion	larryone	no way.... there should be a full list of servers world wide
2007-04-28T12:49:00.000Z	larryone	Parmenion	I'm not seeing "download from> other server >" in synaptic, which menu is it under???
2007-04-28T12:50:00.000Z	Parmenion	larryone	download from box then click on it. you should see your country's servers as well as main servers
2007-04-28T12:52:00.000Z	larryone	Parmenion	I might have a different version of synaptic to you, because I cant see this "download from" button anywhere. I'm running 0.57.8 on dapper
