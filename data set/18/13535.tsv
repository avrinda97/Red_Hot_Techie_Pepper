2006-03-03T16:06:00.000Z	meheren		what would you (anyone...) consider as a good os what im looking for is it's lightweight secure and easy to configure...
2006-03-03T16:07:00.000Z	meheren		rug, duh what distro?
2006-03-03T16:07:00.000Z	meheren		rug, that's what i thought...
2006-03-03T16:08:00.000Z	meheren		does anyone no if ubuntu runs on mac68k? motorolla cpus?
2006-03-03T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	those aren't called "mac68k". anyway, no it doesn't
2006-03-03T16:09:00.000Z	meheren	LjL	i no they called m68k are rather 680x0
2006-03-03T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	yeah but the "m" stands for "motorola" anyway not "mac" =)
2006-03-03T16:11:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	i think it used to
2006-03-03T16:12:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	debian will run, assuming there is a 68k version - i run debian on a 486
2006-03-03T16:12:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	http://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/
2006-03-03T16:12:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	#debian ;)
2006-03-03T16:13:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	testing always served me quite well
2006-03-03T16:14:00.000Z	meheren	LjL	so not top of the line unstable and not outdated stable... seems good
2006-03-03T16:14:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	yeah now there's even security updates for testing. though i guess they come quite a bit delayed
2006-11-01T07:01:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	i don't use xdm (i use kdm), but i suppose there is a "Session" menu
2006-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	meheren	LjL	xdm has no menu's on it's greeter
2006-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	meheren	sudo dpkg-reconfigure <package>
2006-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	meheren	LjL	ah... all this time i've been doing sudo dpkg --configure <package>
