2011-02-26T11:29:00.000Z	JeffCBR		wpasupplicant might not support ath5k? do i need madwifi?
2011-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	JeffCBR		many times...
2011-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	JeffCBR		nm is asleep.
2011-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	JeffCBR		wpa is running, but it restarts itself if i kill it.
2011-02-26T11:32:00.000Z	JeffCBR		I was actually just getting there.
2011-02-26T11:32:00.000Z	karla	JeffCBR	that's probably the one spawned by something like networkmanager?
2011-02-26T11:32:00.000Z	JeffCBR		How can I shut it down?
2011-02-26T11:33:00.000Z	karla		wicd
2011-02-26T11:33:00.000Z	karla		nm is a service, you can just stop it
2011-02-26T11:33:00.000Z	JeffCBR	karla	nm is sleeping and not a problem.
2011-02-26T11:33:00.000Z	JeffCBR		wpa_supplicant is up, and when I kill it, it restarts again.
2011-02-26T11:34:00.000Z	karla	JeffCBR	it still spawns a wpasupplicent even if it sleeps
2011-02-26T11:34:00.000Z	JeffCBR	karla	ok, I'll try.
2011-02-26T11:35:00.000Z	JeffCBR		nm also respawns.
2011-02-26T11:35:00.000Z	karla	JeffCBR	have you used the service stop command instead of just kill??
2011-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	JeffCBR	karla	gaelfx: I don't know how to do that. Which file in /etc/init.d?
2011-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	karla	JeffCBR	i dont remember the exact name of the service of nm on ubuntu otherwise i'd tell you
2011-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	karla	JeffCBR	something like /etc/init.d/network-manager or something
