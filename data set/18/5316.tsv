2011-10-22T07:47:00.000Z	cesurasean		can someone please help me get my machine using wifi? ubuntu is not being nice!
2011-10-22T07:48:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	what wifi card?
2011-10-22T07:50:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	go to terminal and run lspci
2011-10-22T07:50:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	find wireless card and youll see the make/model
2011-10-22T07:51:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	run those commands and see
2011-10-22T07:51:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	I have a laptop here with an atheros card that is doing the same thing. WPA on, doesnt work. WPA off, works fine
2011-10-22T07:51:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	lspci
2011-10-22T07:52:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	delete that SSID from your wifi on the laptop and redo it. one time I did that and it magically worked.
2011-10-22T07:52:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	not sure if it will but worth it to try
2011-10-22T07:53:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	language bro
2011-10-22T07:54:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	it's likely because you have different wireless cards.
2011-10-22T07:54:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	you have to understand, not every company has the same level of support for linux
2011-10-22T07:54:00.000Z	cesurasean	Roasted	so how do i fix that?
2011-10-22T07:54:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	intel and atheros have great support. realtek, not bad. broadcom, absolutely horrible.
2011-10-22T07:54:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	I personally just get wifi cards made by intel and throw them in my systems that are having issues, lol.
2011-10-22T07:54:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	I hate broadcom with a passion. but ironically I'm trying to get one to work at the moment.
2011-10-22T07:55:00.000Z	Roasted	cesurasean	also, what did lspci return for wireless? what card do you have?
2011-10-22T07:55:00.000Z	cesurasean	Roasted	read up in the chat. i posted it.
