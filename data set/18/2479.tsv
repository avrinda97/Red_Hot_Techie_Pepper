2010-06-13T15:45:00.000Z	echosystm		when i installed ubuntu, it said it couldnt find a network controller
2010-06-13T15:46:00.000Z	echosystm		when i made it autodetect, it found it
2010-06-13T15:46:00.000Z	echosystm		and it installed fine
2010-06-13T15:46:00.000Z	echosystm		now that ive rebooted, it cant find the card again
2010-06-13T15:46:00.000Z	echosystm		what can i do to make it autodetect the card again?
2010-06-13T15:46:00.000Z	anonymouse_	echosystm	what card is it?
2010-06-13T15:47:00.000Z	echosystm		i dont know
2010-06-13T15:47:00.000Z	echosystm		some mitsubishi thing
2010-06-13T15:47:00.000Z	anonymouse_	echosystm	try lspci
2010-06-13T15:47:00.000Z	anonymouse_	echosystm	to find out that card you have
2010-06-13T15:47:00.000Z	echosystm		"diamond voice 56 combo"
2010-06-13T15:48:00.000Z	echosystm		it has a 56k modem and ethernet card in one
2010-06-13T15:48:00.000Z	echosystm	anonymouse_	when i lspci, the winmodem comes up
2010-06-13T15:48:00.000Z	echosystm		but thats all i can see
2010-06-13T15:49:00.000Z	echosystm		i know this definitely works, because it was downloading some stuff during installation
2010-06-13T15:49:00.000Z	echosystm		and the apt cache has been updated et.c
2010-06-13T15:50:00.000Z	anonymouse_	echosystm	yeah I don't think it has anything to do with the NIC itself, it sounds like a bug
