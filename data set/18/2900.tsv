2010-09-24T16:22:00.000Z	Xase		I'm trying to get my hacking learning on for messing with android, but I can't figure out how to add 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48 so it's not a public key, so I can pull this source I want from github?
2010-09-24T16:22:00.000Z	Xase		Developing eh?
2010-09-24T16:22:00.000Z	Xase		I like the Eric IDE for python.
2010-09-24T16:23:00.000Z	Xase		what's they trying to do jrib?
2010-09-24T16:23:00.000Z	Xase		Kdevelop is in backports?
2010-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	Xase		Yeah that's kind of lame.
2010-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	Xase		So how do I add an ssh-rsa key to my list of accepted keys?
2010-09-24T16:25:00.000Z	Xase		I'm trying to pull github code...
2010-09-24T16:26:00.000Z	Xase		but it's saying something about their key not being accepted.
2010-09-24T16:27:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	you should just git clone git://github.com/etc/foobar.git
2010-09-24T16:28:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	unless you're trying to use your own github account in which case you'll need to give your own ssh public key to them via the web interface
2010-09-24T16:30:00.000Z	Xase	dancek	see my pastebin =/
2010-09-24T16:31:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	use `git clone git://github.com/koush/android_vendor_motorola_droidx.git`
2010-09-24T16:34:00.000Z	Xase	dancek	perhaps if you're not busy atm and have a second, you could explain to me a bit better how to push this, and my changes back to my own repo?
2010-09-24T16:36:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	it's been a while since i used git but i think `git commit -a`
2010-09-24T16:37:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	i recommend you read a git tutorial though, and maybe ask on #git
2010-09-24T16:38:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	glad to help :)
2010-09-24T16:41:00.000Z	dancek	Xase	i don't really need money but if you really wanna donate, give to those that need it more than me :) http://omusa.org/give/
