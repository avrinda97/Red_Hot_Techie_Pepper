2006-12-13T09:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	It's trying to configure the networking during boot time, and for some reason is having trouble doing so.  Does your connection take a long time to acquire an address for usually?
2006-12-13T09:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	What was doing well?
2006-12-13T09:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	So it's not just your boot time, it's all performance that's affected?
2006-12-13T09:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Have you checked your processes to see what's bogging it down?
2006-12-13T09:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	That's very very odd
2006-12-13T09:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Checked forums for anyone else having the same thing happen?
2006-12-13T09:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Tried the mailing list?
2006-12-13T09:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	dunno
2006-12-13T09:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Checking e-mail you mean?
2006-12-13T09:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	I'm sorry, I really don't understand what you're asking now.
2006-12-13T09:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	You mean you have a mail server running or what?
2006-12-13T09:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Internal system mail with 'mailx'?
2006-12-13T09:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Well, if you want to remove that you'd just uninstall that package.
2006-12-13T09:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	Do you run Gnome or KDE?
2006-12-13T09:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	WEll, is it brown?
2006-12-13T09:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	You can try looking through your logs (in /var/log/) to see what you might have changed, but beyond that I have no idea.
2006-12-13T09:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Heojaua	It's what _you_ need to know.  Spend some time looking through those to figure out what on earth you changed since when it was working, try undoing it, and come back later with more data to work from, since thing's are way too vague to say much right now.
