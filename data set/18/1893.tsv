2011-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	woodyjlw		can anyone explain to me what the difference is between ubuntu and xubuntu ?
2011-01-19T08:10:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	xubuntu runs xfce, instead of gnome(which ubuntu runs)
2011-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	xfce is just different desktop environment like kde or something then?
2011-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	yes, it's a big easier on the resources
2011-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	how much ram do you have?
2011-01-19T08:12:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 1 gig
2011-01-19T08:12:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	honestly, 1gig.. i would just run the regular gnome...
2011-01-19T08:13:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 thanks.  maybe I will try it in vbox and see if I like the interface
2011-01-19T08:13:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	thats always a good thing to do also... if your'e looking for "light"(which is really what xfce is for)... i'd also give Lubuntu a try
2011-01-19T08:14:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 wow how many other ubuntu distros are there?
2011-01-19T08:14:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, lubuntu, and a few "unofficial" ports...
2011-01-19T08:16:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	there's a few distros out there that think they can do ubuntu, better than canonical...
2011-01-19T08:18:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 well ubuntu is very addictive and since I first tried 7.04 I cant seem to put it down and every time I think ubuntu cant get better a new one comes out and I have to try it out
2011-01-19T08:19:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	yeah... i like Ubuntu... i've moved on from it, but if you're trying to 'learn' linux, or you just want one you don't really have to mess w/.. you're on the right track
2011-01-19T08:21:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 yes I am still learning linux and got much to learn still and ubuntu has made it easy for people who dont know linux or are scared of it to experience linux with out sink or swim and I have come to learn that ubuntu is just the tip of the ice berg for how powerfull and fun the linux world can be
2011-01-19T08:26:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 I thought ubuntu gnome was already a light weight os without all the bells and whistles of kde. had no idea it gets any simpler than this but I guess if your running older hardware it comes in handy to use less resources
2011-01-19T08:27:00.000Z	KM0201	woodyjlw	yup... andif you're on something really ancient, google "crunchbang linux"... :)
2011-01-19T08:27:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KM0201	 ok lol
