2010-07-05T09:51:00.000Z	warace		this is a total noob question but does anyone know where I can change the power output to my wifi card i just got an alfa 1000mw card if I am correct it is the TxPower
2010-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	warace		anyoine ever tried installing ubuntu on a UMPC?
2010-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	warace		looking to buy one not sure what to invest in
2010-07-05T09:56:00.000Z	thune3	warace	there may be a better way but: assuming device is wlan0 "iwlist wlan0 txpower" will show you available powers and "iwconfig wlan0 txpower <setting>" should apply changes.
2010-07-05T10:07:00.000Z	warace		well the crapy alfa card said it would do 1000mw and it wont let me set more the 501mw heh
2010-07-05T10:08:00.000Z	warace		feel shammed now
2010-07-05T10:10:00.000Z	thune3	warace	i think recieve sensitivity decreases when you increase output power. 100mW for transmit power is huge. 10-20 would be typical. Unless you are trying to go 1000 meters, you have plenty of power.
2010-07-05T10:12:00.000Z	warace		hmmm I am trying to increase the card to recieve a better signal from my brothers room which is all the way in the other side of the house a bit far
2010-07-05T10:14:00.000Z	warace		recieving now but the card works better in windows with the driver the factory provided
2010-07-05T10:15:00.000Z	thune3	warace	maybe also play with the iwconfig "sens" variable, change channels, and consider setting frag to 512.
2010-07-05T10:16:00.000Z	warace		tried all channels on router he is on the cleanest one
2010-07-05T10:16:00.000Z	warace		hmm i am guessing sens is for sensitivity
2010-07-05T10:18:00.000Z	thune3	warace	reading up on it i'm not sure 'sens' really does anything anymore
2010-07-05T10:19:00.000Z	warace	thune3	thanks
2010-07-05T10:20:00.000Z	warace		I think I will buy a higher dBi antena
2010-07-05T10:20:00.000Z	thune3	warace	if you are just surfing and stuff, wireless-b band tends to have better range (11M and less in rate setting)
2010-07-05T10:21:00.000Z	warace		hmmmm just moved the antena and the strength went up quite a bit
2010-07-05T10:22:00.000Z	warace	thune3	I guess this will do good enough heh
