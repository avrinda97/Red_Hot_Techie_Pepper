2008-08-03T20:43:00.000Z	Svenstaro		My HP DeskJet 5440 still only eats the paper, it doesn't do any printing, halp!
2008-08-03T20:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	you on gnome?
2008-08-03T20:44:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	yep
2008-08-03T20:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	you checked system prefs hplip toolbox yet?
2008-08-03T20:44:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	yeah im always in the toolbox, but what exactly sohuld I do?
2008-08-03T20:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	you did not find the drivers there?
2008-08-03T20:45:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	well the drivers ARE there
2008-08-03T20:45:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	also it is found and initialized correctly, it just doesnt print useful stuff :P
2008-08-03T20:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	this is printing via cups or the gnome print utility
2008-08-03T20:51:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	cups I assume
2008-08-03T20:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	and it works fine with other computers/OS?
2008-08-03T20:52:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	yup
2008-08-03T20:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	according to this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrintersHp it uses hpijs and should be configured via system admin printing utility
2008-08-03T20:56:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	that didnt really work >.< but I think I just made it work using hp toolbox
2008-08-03T20:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Svenstaro	it now prints?
2008-08-03T20:57:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	hang on
2008-08-03T21:00:00.000Z	Svenstaro	bazhang	yup works
