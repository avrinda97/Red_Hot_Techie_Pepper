2004-11-28T12:13:00.000Z	Kirsch		hey my soundcard doesn't work... when i try to play out of ALSA, but esound works
2004-11-28T12:14:00.000Z	Kirsch		xmms complains
2004-11-28T12:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	if there is an esd output for XMMS installed, use it
2004-11-28T12:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	so kill esd and change all the programs that were using esd to use alsa directly
2005-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	it's a non-fatal bug because you simply lack that hardware.
2005-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	Kirsch	crimsun	can i disable it from starting at all then?
2005-01-21T10:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	blacklist it: echo shpchp | sudo tee -a /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-01-21T10:12:00.000Z	Kirsch	crimsun	there are 4 errors that popup
2005-01-21T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	echo pciehp | sudo tee -a /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-01-21T10:25:00.000Z	Kirsch	crimsun	any idea on my network problem?
2005-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	sec
2005-01-21T10:27:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	I'm really only familiar with the conffile; you could simply change all the interfaces so they don't start up automatically
2005-01-21T10:27:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	(e.g., remove the auto $iface part)
2005-01-21T10:28:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	yes, and I stated how
2005-01-21T10:29:00.000Z	Kirsch	crimsun	how do i remove the auto $iface part?
2005-01-21T10:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	use an editor to edit /etc/network/interfaces
2005-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	if you're referring to nvidia+nvidia_drv, you actually can but not by default
2005-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Kirsch	the option is documented in the readem
