2006-11-23T08:08:00.000Z	Stormx2		 UUID=44A6-9501 /media/Stuff vfat defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0 1 <-- in /etc/fstab. I want this to be world writeable (at the moment the permissions are drwxrwx--- ). How do i change this line to reflect this?
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	change umask to 000 or 111 (111 if you don't want any execute permissions)
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	Thanks.
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	umask is kind of the opposite of chmod as far as the numbering system goes
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	np
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	heh okay. Then mount -d right?
2006-11-23T08:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	i guess so
2006-11-23T08:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	Oh I think its  -a
2006-11-23T08:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	i honestly haven't looked at the manual in a while, but that's probably it. skimming just now i didn't see a -d option at all
2006-11-23T08:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	Still no good.
2006-11-23T08:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	Same permissions as before.
2006-11-23T08:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	I'll just reboot into windows for today... its not too important.
2006-11-23T08:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	k...that's odd though, since that's s'posed to work :-(
2006-11-23T08:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	good luck
2006-11-23T08:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	it probably will after a reboot.
2006-11-23T08:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	ladydoor	But its 2:15am and I have school tomorow, I cba with this XD
2006-11-23T08:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	well, you don't have to reboot linux except for kernel upgrades
2006-11-23T08:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	Stormx2	have a good day of school
