2006-03-24T07:31:00.000Z	shutdown	JDahl	I have got three partition: Windows (FAT32), UbuntuLinux (EXT3), SwapPartition (SWAP)... Can I format Windows and reinstall it? I don't want format Linux!!
2006-03-24T07:33:00.000Z	JDahl	shutdown	You can just reinstall windows with reformating anything then. Make sure you have a rescue disk or CD to boot in linux to rerun Grub, though, as Windows will probably overwrite the bootmanager
2006-03-24T07:33:00.000Z	JDahl	shutdown	reinstall windows *without* reformating...
2006-03-24T07:33:00.000Z	shutdown	JDahl	come faccio?

2006-03-24T07:34:00.000Z	JDahl	shutdown	reinstall windows the regular way - you dont to manually reformat the disk
2006-03-24T07:35:00.000Z	shutdown	JDahl	Uhm ... I don't know... Sorry, I speak Italian :-))
