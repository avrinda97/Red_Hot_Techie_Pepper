2012-04-22T22:49:00.000Z	CellTech		Ok. I wanna use by flash drive to test live distros. I'm on 10.04. What should I format my drive too and how come when I remove, then plug the drive back in. It doesn't offer me a 'live trial'
2012-04-22T22:50:00.000Z	CellTech		Technically yes
2012-04-22T22:50:00.000Z	CellTech		All it does is opens the folder to see the files
2012-04-22T22:51:00.000Z	CellTech		Well that's the thing I'm trying to avoid constant restarts. I don't mind installing the iso to the drive then just unmount and remount.
2012-04-22T22:51:00.000Z	CellTech		What should I always format my drive too?
2012-04-22T22:52:00.000Z	CellTech		Cant a thumbdrive be set to autoplay so it runs programs?
2012-04-22T22:53:00.000Z	CellTech		Ok. So now for that. I'll restart. What should I format the thing for Fat, ext4,,,
2012-04-22T22:53:00.000Z	CellTech		I have UNetBootin. But it makes me format the drive
2012-04-22T22:53:00.000Z	CellTech		What do I format too FAT, or ext4. Whats the best
2012-04-22T22:55:00.000Z	CellTech		Ok. I'm gonna go slow. I insert the flash drive. I open disk utility, I unmount then format with "don't partition" then I go to "partition./format" Normally I pick FAT. Then I open uNetBootin and have the iso installed to the drive. I then remove said drive, shut down, insert the drive, turn computer back on. Bios is set to boot from usb 1st. However. Sometimes it fails to do so. What should I "partition/format" my thumbdrive too?
2012-04-22T22:56:00.000Z	theadmin	CellTech	Just dd the image onto your USB stick if it's a Linux.
2012-04-22T22:57:00.000Z	CellTech	theadmin	I wish it was that easy. Disk utility usually requires a partition before I remount
2012-04-22T22:57:00.000Z	theadmin	CellTech	No, uh: sudo dd if=your_linux_image.iso of=/dev/sdz
2012-04-22T22:57:00.000Z	theadmin	CellTech	Wherein "sdz" is your usb stick. Note it's "sdz", not "sdz1" or somesuch.
2012-04-22T22:58:00.000Z	CellTech	theadmin	correct. that's how it shows in unetbootin
2012-04-22T22:59:00.000Z	theadmin	CellTech	I had awful experiences with unetbootin myself -- almost always failed on me, so I don't use it nor recommend anyone to.
2012-04-22T22:59:00.000Z	CellTech	theadmin	What do you use? I'll try another no problem
2012-04-22T22:59:00.000Z	theadmin	CellTech	Well as I said, from Linux I use dd, from Windows I use LiLi
