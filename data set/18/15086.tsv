2005-05-08T16:04:00.000Z	steved	ubuask	you want to see what groups are set on your machine or what groups your user is a member of ?
2005-05-08T16:05:00.000Z	ubuask	steved	right !
2005-05-08T16:06:00.000Z	steved	ubuask	to see what groups are set up on the machine look in /etc/group that will list them
2005-05-08T16:06:00.000Z	steved	ubuask	if you want to see what groups your user belongs to type groups
