2008-03-30T03:14:00.000Z	Brack10		hello
2008-03-30T03:15:00.000Z	Brack10		I REALLY want to switch to 100% ubuntu, but the ONLY thing holding me back is adobe CS3.  I heard photoshop runs, but I need illustrator, golive, etc....
2008-03-30T03:15:00.000Z	Brack10		what should I do?
2008-03-30T03:15:00.000Z	Brack10		is virtualbox a viable option?
2008-03-30T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	you'll have to check... it will be slower.. but only you can say if it's still acceptable
2008-12-08T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	change mirror?
2009-01-20T11:22:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	if it comes preinstalled then it most probably is
2009-01-20T11:30:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	I think startx should work
2009-01-20T11:30:00.000Z	Brack10	Slart	no but I also have gnome installed
2009-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	Brack10	Slart	I installed it on top of gnome for when I need a lightweight wm
2009-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	might be a setting in some file somewhere that startx reads what to run
2009-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	Brack10	Slart	you mean xorg.conf?
2009-01-20T11:33:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	no, some other file.. I'm not sure what it's called
2009-01-28T00:08:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	sounds like you're doing things with your OEM install you're not allowed to do..
2009-01-28T00:08:00.000Z	Brack10	Slart	lame
2009-01-28T00:09:00.000Z	Brack10	Slart	 This has to be possible though, right?
2009-01-28T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	sure, but this isn't the place
2009-02-19T00:50:00.000Z	Slart	Brack10	cat /proc/asound/cards might give you some info
