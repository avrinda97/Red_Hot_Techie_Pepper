2010-11-12T00:25:00.000Z	Guest36740		dean ubuntu is bit difficult for me but i really like it its really not like windows to spoon feed the user.. sorry for the spelling mistake.
2010-11-12T00:25:00.000Z	dean		keep persevering Guest36740 you'll get hang of it but as your using deluge for torrents I would suggest typing in the search box restricted extras as if you try to play avi or certain audio files you wont get anywhere
