2007-04-27T06:53:00.000Z	kotdown		I installed vnc4server, and when I'm trying to start it, it shows me: xauth : stdin:1: bad display name "......" in "add" command
2007-04-27T06:53:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	try running it as rot.
2007-04-27T06:53:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	er, root.
2007-04-27T06:55:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	at this point I would tell you to run it from the system menu, but that's not there in feisty.
2007-04-27T06:56:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	try installing "vncserver" instead.
2007-04-27T06:59:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	pastebin the full message.
2007-04-27T07:01:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	GOT it! you need to run it from a graphical terminal. SSH won't work.
2007-04-27T07:02:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	see earlier message.
2007-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	you there?
2007-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	that command will only work from a graphical terminal. running it through SSH or other non-graphical won't work.
2007-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	long story short, if you're installing VNC, you probably can't get to one.
2007-04-27T07:09:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	wait 2 seconds
2007-04-27T07:11:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	try "vncserver :0"
2007-04-27T07:13:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	one import point i should note is that if the remote machine doesn't have any graphical desktops running, vnc isn't going to work. period.
2007-04-27T07:14:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	so, does it?
2007-04-27T07:15:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	check by running "sudo gdm".
2007-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	how far away is this remote server? because the easiest thing to do would be to go over to it and run commands locally.
2007-04-27T07:18:00.000Z	Recon	kotdown	if it's rent dedicated, then it's probably running the server version and doesn't have a graphical interface installed, let alone running VNC.
