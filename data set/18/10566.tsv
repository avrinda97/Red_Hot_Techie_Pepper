2009-09-23T14:50:00.000Z	gp5st		so how do you restart X? apperently it's not ctrl+alt+backspace, but alt+sysrq+k, what if you don't have sysrq?
2009-09-23T14:50:00.000Z	ssokolow	gp5st	SysRq = Print Screen
2009-09-23T14:51:00.000Z	gp5st		sskolow: I know, i was fond of it, but macs don't have it
2009-09-23T14:51:00.000Z	gp5st	bazhang	I saw that, but i was wondering why they would make a decision that involved a key ppl didn't have
2009-09-23T14:52:00.000Z	gp5st		so it had to be somewhere or mapped to something
2009-09-23T14:52:00.000Z	ssokolow	gp5st	Ahh. I don't use macs because I prefer commodity hardware, I hate control freaks like Steve Jobs, and I disagree with some of the hardware and software design decisions.
2009-09-23T14:52:00.000Z	gp5st		b3z: no, it's cmd+shift+3 in macos
2009-09-23T14:52:00.000Z	gp5st		sskolow: it was free from work
2009-09-23T14:52:00.000Z	gp5st		baz: what is?
2009-09-23T14:53:00.000Z	gp5st		that's just a map in the system to the command not a key seq replacing it
2009-09-23T14:53:00.000Z	ssokolow	gp5st	Ahh. If I got a free Mac, I'd use it only as a test platform and package-building box for OSX versions of my creations.
2009-09-23T14:53:00.000Z	gp5st		ssololow: unless you don't have the money to buy a computer because you're broke because you just graduated and work as an acedemic
2009-09-23T14:54:00.000Z	gp5st		honestly, get off your high horse
2009-09-23T14:54:00.000Z	gp5st		a computer is a computer
2009-09-23T14:54:00.000Z	gp5st		and it's not that less modable than a regular laptop
2009-09-23T14:54:00.000Z	ssokolow	gp5st	I'd just drop by the local FactoryDirect.ca and pick up a ~3Ghz
2009-09-23T14:54:00.000Z	gp5st		it takes standard mem and harddisks which is about all you can change anyway
2009-09-23T14:54:00.000Z	ssokolow	gp5st	I'd just drop by the local FactoryDirect.ca and pick up a ~3Ghz Athlon64 with 1GiB RAM and 40GiB hard drive for $120 CAD.
