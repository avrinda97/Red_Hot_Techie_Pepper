2010-05-17T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: well, what error do you get when you try?
2010-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Lengend: then i'd boot to live cd and look at the grub settings and maybe reinstall grub
2010-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: then find the file online and grab the file and put it in /lib/firmware
2010-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: did you run: sudo apt-get update ,first?
2010-05-17T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Shawnrisk: does the wifi connect (even if not automagically)
2010-05-17T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: I recommend using a wired connection and getting full updates. The driver for the wifi will also be offered.
2010-05-17T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Shawnrisk: I've seen this and I worked around by installing wicd
2010-05-17T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Shawnrisk: you may need a wakeup script to remove the driver module, the reload it to wake up the adapter
2010-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: sweet. Updates fix lots of stuff. Hopefully the system will also sort out the wifi for you too :)
2010-05-17T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: lxde is slick and quick :)
2010-05-17T00:09:00.000Z	causality	ActionParsnip	i prefer things that just work and this is being flakey so far.
2010-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	causality	ActionParsnip	video support isn't perfect.
2010-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Shawnrisk: no as I can't be bothered with the heartache that hibernate brings. There are samples around though
2010-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causality: depends on chip. Nvidia support is as good as windows
2010-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	causality	ActionParsnip	this is an ibm thinkpad x30
2010-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Doofy	went where
2010-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Causalityh: saying "video support" is real vague. Some chips are very supported
2010-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	causality	ActionParsnip	wifi is now working, thanks
