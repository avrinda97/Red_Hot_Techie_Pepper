2006-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	donspaulding		hello all, I just installed the Dapper server and setup sshd, when I login over ssh I'm unable to use sudo.  Is there some way for me to fix this???  Any help appreciated.
2006-09-05T11:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2006-09-05T11:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	i'm not positive if that's client-only by default
2006-09-05T11:38:00.000Z	donspaulding	eyequeue	I have the ssh server installed and am logged in remotely
2006-09-05T11:38:00.000Z	donspaulding		myquestion is why can't I use the "sudo" command over ssh?
2006-09-05T11:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	but can't sudo when you do?  i can't see a reason there
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	donspaulding		well, the command runs, but it prompts me for a password
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	you're still using the intial account, right?  just remotely?
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	donspaulding		nope
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	you type your user's pasword
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	donspaulding		I'm using my non-admin account
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	yes
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	type "don's" password, not root's password
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	donspaulding		OK
2006-09-05T11:40:00.000Z	donspaulding		Thanks guys
2006-09-05T11:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	did it work for you?
2006-09-05T11:41:00.000Z	donspaulding		yep, it works, Thanks again!
2006-09-05T11:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	donspaulding	great
