2010-05-06T08:27:00.000Z	magn3ts		I have to reinstall nvidia every other reboot after upgrading to 10.04. I only have good graphics every other boot. This is terribly frustrating and I'd love any advice! thanks!
2010-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	are you running the one that comes from the Hardware Drivers in Ubuntu, or the one from the Website?
2010-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	I am using Hardware Drivers but I have the nvidia vdpau's team PPA loaded up as well
2010-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	do you think they are conflicting? I never had this problem with 9.10
2010-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	you install it and it works fine after what a restart? or does it just not load?
2010-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	I install, reboot, its fine. I reboot, its in graphical safe mode, I uninstall the kernel module, reinstall, repeat.
2010-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	like I said, very strange and very frustrating
2010-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	did you update your kernel?
2010-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	how long has it been doing this? like since you upgraded or just recently?
2010-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	well, initially when upgrading but this happens multiple times a day, not just from a simple kernel upgrade sadly.
2010-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	both. I just upgraded recently.
2010-05-06T08:33:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	I would go through synaptic and uninstall anything nvidia graphics related that is installed and set it for COMPLETE removal, that should remove the config files and all that. Reboot should bring you back to simple graphics. then install it again, maybe a config file is staying there from your upgrade and its causing a problem.
2010-05-06T08:33:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	already did that :) apt-get remove --purge all the nvidia packages by name, hand
2010-05-06T08:34:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	lol dang it. only other guess I have is try installing the one from Nvidia's website itself. That is the one I am using after having trouble with the one from the Hardware Drivers.
2010-05-06T08:34:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	I think I'm going to disable the nvidia vdpau repo, try that, if that doesn't work, I'm going to do what you suggested and instlal it from nvidia, though when I do that I always have to Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get to X when my PC boots. :( oh well
2010-05-06T08:35:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	yeah you have to install it from X without a graphical running. hopefully it works for ya.
2010-05-06T08:36:00.000Z	magn3ts	UbuntuJeff	no, I just meant that the driver causes Ubuntu to stay on TTY1 when it boots rather than switching to tty7 which X runs on... it's strange and it only happens after manually installing the nvidia driver. the repo versions never do that to me
2010-05-06T08:36:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	magn3ts	that is really weird, mine just loads normal not sure which tty it loads on.
