2009-02-17T19:21:00.000Z	fabio_	Kingsy101	startx
2009-02-17T19:22:00.000Z	Kingsy101	fabio_	- startx will work after this install then? it was coming up with errors before hand..
2009-02-17T19:23:00.000Z	fabio_	Kingsy101	there is a startx for xfce4
2009-02-17T19:25:00.000Z	fabio_	Kingsy101	if your laptop is very old try with a good window manager like e16
2009-02-17T19:26:00.000Z	Kingsy101	fabio_	- just going to see what this is like first
