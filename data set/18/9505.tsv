2007-11-06T03:10:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	you also said it freezes when you try to verify the CD, and someone answered and said that it sounds like a bad burn. you said "its not" so theres not much more to say
2007-11-06T03:34:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	you are clearly having a hardware compatibility issue, its possible some of the kernel boot options might resolve it such as noapic acpi=off
2007-11-06T03:35:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	a system for how the OS relates the motherboard and hardware, it causes a lot of hardware issues
2007-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	you dont want to disable anything in bios, the suggestions were to pass options to the kernel at boot time
2007-11-06T04:27:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	if you press f6 at the live cd initial menu, you will get a line of text. that is where you type additional boot parameters
2007-11-07T03:16:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	good job sticking with it, I know you were having lots of issues, what was the fix?
2007-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	don't download from websites, use the ubuntu repositories with synaptic or add/remove software
2007-11-07T03:20:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	ubuntu has pidgin installed by default which is graphical app that handles tons of messenging formats including IRC, to fix your graphics you need to setup the xserver to use your graphics card correctly
2007-11-07T03:21:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	you have to configure X for your graphics setup, there are several different ways to approach it, but you need to have the info on what graphics card you are using and what resolution your monitor supports
2007-11-07T03:23:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	try system > administration > screens and graphics also and see if your hardware has been identified at all by the system
2007-11-07T03:45:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nintendo64	you should use the ubuntu repositories to install software, ubuntu has premade packages of xchat that can be installed on your system automatically, you can use the synaptic package manager for a good graphical tool to install what you need
