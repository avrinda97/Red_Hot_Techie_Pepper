2004-10-15T16:05:00.000Z	dyn		oh shit.. anyone knows how to fix the "NTLDR is missing" problem of windows XP after installing ubuntu to an other partition?
2004-10-15T16:05:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	http://lwn.net/Articles/86835/, perhaps?
2004-10-15T16:06:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	let me see.. my gf gonna kill me if i dont solve that until evening :))
2004-10-15T16:09:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	still reading, but i wonder how come that you got that url handy immediately? :)
2004-10-15T16:12:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	bug #1566
2004-10-15T16:12:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	may not be the same thing, but it's high on my list at the moment ...
2004-10-15T16:13:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	ahh, i see
2004-10-15T16:13:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	fact is, that i HAD run into that installing freebsd the other day to a box, but ended up with reinstalling the whole box, i couldn't find an answer
2004-10-15T16:13:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	but let's see if i can blow up that box with sfdisk, i'm already close to the end of the docs :)
2004-10-15T16:17:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	"Warning: partition 1 does not end at a cylinder bounday", sfdisk kindly refuses to set these
2004-10-15T16:29:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	sorry, I'm not sure enough of my ground beyond that
2004-10-15T05:37:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	*pheeew* solved the issue
2004-10-15T05:37:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	no sfdisk magic helped, but i switched the hdd config in the bios to 'Large' mode, and winxp booted instantly
2004-10-15T05:41:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	ah, good
2004-10-15T05:42:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	i think that could be also added to the Ubuntu FAQ or even to Release Notes
2004-10-15T05:42:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	would MUCH rather fix it so it doesn't happen in the first place
2004-10-15T05:43:00.000Z	Kamion	dyn	I hate documenting workarounds rather than applying fixes
2004-10-15T05:44:00.000Z	dyn	Kamion	you're right ofc.. and thanks for your suggestions :)
