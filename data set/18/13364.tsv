2005-11-29T16:22:00.000Z	faust		Whenever I try to enter any of the administrative features in Gnome, I get a password prompt, I enter the password, and nothing happens. Tried both the regular user password and the root password.
2005-11-29T16:22:00.000Z	faust		What could be wrong?
2005-11-29T16:22:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	try in a terminal: gksudo synaptic
2005-11-29T16:27:00.000Z	faust	Seveas	running gksudo synaptic produces a password prompt, I enter the password, and nothing happens.
2005-11-29T16:27:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	no output in the terminal?
2005-11-29T16:27:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	did it work before?
2005-11-29T16:27:00.000Z	faust	Seveas	Clean install.
2005-11-29T16:28:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	did you do a server or expert install?
2005-11-29T16:31:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	what does 'id' give you?
2005-11-29T16:32:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	right, sudo addgroup --system admin && sudo adduser willy admin
2005-11-29T16:32:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	and use the standard sudoers file, see http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5013
2005-11-29T16:36:00.000Z	faust	Seveas	After running the commands you gave me, and editing the sudoers file so it matches the one in the example, I still get nothing happening.
2005-11-29T16:36:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	does 'id' say you're in the 'admin' group?
2005-11-29T16:37:00.000Z	faust	Seveas	no, it doesn't.
2005-11-29T16:37:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	then something went wrong with the earlier commands
2005-11-29T16:39:00.000Z	faust	Seveas	the group admin does not exist in the /etc/group file
2005-11-29T16:40:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	then let's go the quick route
2005-11-29T16:41:00.000Z	Seveas	faust	no
