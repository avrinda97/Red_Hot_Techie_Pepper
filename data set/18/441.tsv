2012-08-22T19:44:00.000Z	bobvdv		Hi all
2012-08-22T19:45:00.000Z	bobvdv		I'm getting a very strange error right after booting Ubuntu 12.04, it's just a dialog reporting 'System program problem detected'
2012-08-22T19:45:00.000Z	bobvdv		There is no sign of anything not working correctly, but I'm still concerned about it
2012-08-22T19:47:00.000Z	bobvdv		Is there a way I can detect what this dialog is related too?
2012-08-22T19:48:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	try looking in /var/log/messages
2012-08-22T19:52:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	there is no such thing on my system
2012-08-22T19:53:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	Hmmm... just a sec
2012-08-22T19:56:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	there are a lot of other logs though
2012-08-22T19:56:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	I think they changed the logging of the system... Maybe in syslog or something similar.
2012-08-22T19:57:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	I have 10.04 still :)
2012-08-22T19:58:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	is there a good way to view logs other than $- more /var/log/syslog ?
2012-08-22T19:59:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	you can use grep to scan the file for a string
2012-08-22T20:00:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	This is a server that the problem is on?
2012-08-22T20:02:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	there's a whole lot of stuff in syslog ...
2012-08-22T20:04:00.000Z	Mechdave	bobvdv	if you grep the file it will return the matching line. eg: grep /var/log/syslog "System program problem detected"
2012-08-22T20:06:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	then I just get this: grep: System program problem detected: No such file or directory
2012-08-22T20:06:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	I'm using grep wrong?
2012-08-22T20:07:00.000Z	bobvdv	Mechdave	had the arguments in wrong order
