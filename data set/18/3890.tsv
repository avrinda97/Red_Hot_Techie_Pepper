2009-07-22T01:14:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	./configure is not always a required step.  That command runs a script.  By typing ./configure you're assuming there is a file in there called "configure" that can be run.  Trying skipping right to "make" and "make install"
2009-07-22T01:24:00.000Z	TheLinuxMoron	edbian	it didn't work
2009-07-22T01:25:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	Be more specific what are you trying to do?  Install software from source?
2009-07-22T01:26:00.000Z	TheLinuxMoron	edbian	yes K3b 1.66.0 sources
2009-07-22T01:26:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	so you downloaded .tar.gz file? and extracted it?
2009-07-22T01:34:00.000Z	TheLinuxMoron	edbian	any suggestions
2009-07-22T01:35:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	You downloaded a .tar.gz and extracted it?
2009-07-22T01:35:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	Or was this a pre-packaged .deb??
2009-07-22T01:36:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	and you extracted it?  What's in there?  Is there a make file?  Is there a configure script?
2009-07-22T01:36:00.000Z	TheLinuxMoron	edbian	and i have the folder on desktop.. and when I cd to that dir for ./configure it said previous what I stated.. the make or make install tells me K3b 1.66.0 sources
2009-07-22T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	Did you extract it first?  You gotta extract it so it's a normal folder.
2009-07-22T01:38:00.000Z	TheLinuxMoron	edbian	I did
2009-07-22T01:38:00.000Z	edbian	TheLinuxMoron	What is in that folder?  Is there a file called "configure"  ??
