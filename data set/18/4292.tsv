2009-05-02T10:14:00.000Z	BeWop		Anyone able to help out with Ubuntu/Grub reconizing a partition?
2009-05-02T10:14:00.000Z	BeWop		Revenor: talking to me?
2009-05-02T10:15:00.000Z	Ravenor	BeWop	That's a general question.
2009-05-02T10:15:00.000Z	Ravenor	BeWop	Haven't got a clue if I write GRUB to sda or sda1.
2009-05-02T10:15:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	yeah, but the problem is, when I edit the menu.lst in grub, It still doesn't work
2009-05-02T10:15:00.000Z	Ravenor	BeWop	Your problem would be different from my problem...
2009-05-02T10:16:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	I can't even force ubuntu to mount my XP partition
2009-05-02T10:16:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	yeah, I guess
2009-05-02T10:16:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	what's your problem?
2009-05-02T10:17:00.000Z	Ravenor	BeWop	Like I said, I'm installing Arch, and I'm not sure where to write GRUB to. I'm trying to replace the windows MBR with GRUB, but I don't knwo if its on /dev/sda or /dev/sda1.
2009-05-02T10:18:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	type in sudo fdisk -l in terminal, and see which one it is
2009-05-02T10:18:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	it's usually the NTFS one XD
2009-05-02T10:18:00.000Z	Ravenor	BeWop	The Windows partition? That'll be sda1. Do boot loaders usually exist along side the operating system?
2009-05-02T10:19:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	I'm not sure...
2009-05-02T10:19:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	I'm here for help, I don't know all that much XD
2009-05-02T10:20:00.000Z	Ravenor	BeWop	That happens. I wonder if a windows disc + recovery console would do anything.
2009-05-02T10:21:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	Problably
2009-05-02T10:21:00.000Z	BeWop	Ravenor	Well, I'm just gonna reinstall XP, this thing pisses me off too much, and I don't think I can fix it.
