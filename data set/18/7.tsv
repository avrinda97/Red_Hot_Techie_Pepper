2004-10-31T16:29:00.000Z	Juerd_		Where can a list of changes since a previous version be found?
2004-10-31T16:29:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	for a particular package, /usr/share/doc/<package>/changelog.Debian.gz
2004-10-31T16:30:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	And in general?
2004-10-31T16:30:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	the release announcements
2004-10-31T16:41:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	hda6 is not the entire disk.
2004-10-31T16:38:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	er...
2004-10-31T16:39:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	I want to do a clean installation of Ubuntu, to see if the problems I had before are gone, without the risk of anything from the previous try being in the way.
2004-10-31T16:39:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	ok, a bit extreme. :-)  choosing 'erase the entire disk' in the installer is sufficient
2004-10-31T16:39:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	No way. I have important other data on these disks.
2004-10-31T16:40:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	If only it could retain the raid arrays this time, I'd be a lot happier
2004-10-31T16:41:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	you have important data, but you're overwriting the entire disk with dd?
2004-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	Or at least I hope the evil hax0rs left that device's minor number as it was :)
2004-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	ah, heh.  erasing the first 32k or so should be more than sufficient, then
2004-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	Hell, just mkfs.ext3 would do the trick, and the installer does that anyway.
2004-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	But I'm waiting for the iso to download, and why not stress the disk a little more? :)
2004-10-31T16:57:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	that'll minimize the error checking :-)
2004-10-31T16:57:00.000Z	Juerd_	mdz	In TCP I trust :)
2004-11-01T17:02:00.000Z	mdz	Juerd_	not until the base system is installed
