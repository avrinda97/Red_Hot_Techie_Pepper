2008-04-04T16:18:00.000Z	dahui		have tried gos as well, same problem :( what would the best ubuntu be for eeepc, if dhcp is disabled in the network?
2008-04-04T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	id use xubuntu as its get a lower memeory footprint
2008-04-04T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	don't you like the xandros ?
2008-04-04T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	eeeXubuntu has everything you need :)
2008-04-04T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	eeepc aint that slow dude
2008-04-04T16:41:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	the it is my broadband ;) ;) ;) the bottleneck ;)
2008-04-04T16:42:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	no bios on macs
2008-04-04T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	ok, have you tried adding extra boot options to diable acpi / dma etc. Have you googled for any walkthroughs with help

2008-04-04T16:45:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	thx very usfefull for me ;)
2008-04-04T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	ive zero experience with mac but i found that with google. you should try it
2008-04-04T16:50:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	I am just a mac user, but trying to install on eeepc asus ;)
2008-04-04T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	eeexubuntu has the drivers for native wifi
2008-04-04T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	its made for that system
2008-04-04T17:06:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	I know, but thats why I am here for, the wifi works only if in my router dhcp is enabled, if I try manual config, it doesn'r work, while in xandros manual is no prob, so it cannot be missspell anything nor the hardware. lopin told me to patch it http://www.ubuntugeek.com/atheros-5007eg-with-madwifi-on-i386-platform.html and now while waiting I wanted to know, if I can verify to have the right hardware ;) thx again
2008-04-04T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dahui	you can always use ndiswrapper but eeexubuntu states it has native drivers
2008-04-04T17:16:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	<< but eeexubuntu states it has native drivers >> which did not work for my eeepc as mentioned ;) at least not in manual wifi config
2008-04-04T17:16:00.000Z	dahui	ActionParsnip	installing with router dhcp enabled and automatic config of wifi .... 97 % ;)
