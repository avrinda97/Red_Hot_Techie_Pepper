2009-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 vi has a 'rectangle' mode. but ive not really nocticed any editors taht specilize in colums.
2009-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 i would bet emacs has some feature like that - it has everything else.
2009-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	zxd		Dr_Disk: rectangle mode means I can select the row yes?
2009-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	zxd		Dr_Disk: but vim isn't gui is it
2009-05-12T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 in vim you select a whole 'colum' of text..
2009-05-12T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 it has gui versions. and is worth learning
2009-05-12T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 also check out 'cream'
2009-05-12T18:35:00.000Z	zxd	Dr_Willis	cream can do it?
2009-05-12T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 cream isbased on vi..so  i imagoneso.
2009-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	zxd	Dr_Willis	ok i am in crea , how do I select the text like you said?
2009-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	zxd		rectangle mode
2009-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 check the menus/docs.. in vi its 'ctrl-v'
2009-05-12T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zxd	 vi calls it a 'visual block'
