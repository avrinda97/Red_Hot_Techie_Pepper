2005-06-25T07:57:00.000Z	dabugas		hi
2005-06-25T07:58:00.000Z	dabugas		i'm trying to mount an iso image (mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso) and i get the error "mount: could not find any device /dev/loop#"
2005-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	dabugas		any ones what's up? what is /dev/loop, anyway?
2005-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	you're running hoary (ubuntu 5.04) right?
2005-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	dabugas	HappyFool	more or less ;) some warty stuff still in here
2005-06-25T08:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	/dev/loop? are loopback devices
2005-06-25T08:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	loopback devices are how files are made available for mounting (that's how i understand it, anyway)
2005-06-25T08:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	as far as i know, loopback functionality is built into the hoary kernels
2005-06-25T08:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	you're not running a custom kernel by any chance?
2005-06-25T08:03:00.000Z	dabugas	HappyFool	nope. even if compiled in the kernel they should be in /dev, right?
2005-06-25T08:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	yip, should be there
2005-06-25T08:04:00.000Z	dabugas	HappyFool	well, it ain't :(
2005-06-25T08:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	hrm. i have a directory /dev/loop/, with one file '0'
2005-06-25T08:04:00.000Z	dabugas	HappyFool	maybe i should MAKEDEV it. what's in the 0 file?
2005-06-25T08:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	it's a device file
2005-06-25T08:17:00.000Z	dabugas	HappyFool	i MAKEDEV loop devices and now i get brand new spanking error. shall i send it to you in priv? it's 4 lines long
2005-06-25T08:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	sure
2005-06-25T08:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	dabugas	has left
