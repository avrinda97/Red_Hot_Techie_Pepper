2006-07-15T05:22:00.000Z	h6w		Any ideas?
2006-07-15T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	yes
2006-07-15T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	don't flood
2006-07-15T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	if you want any sympathetic response, that is.
2006-07-15T05:25:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	it says, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org if you've got errors to paste.
2006-07-15T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	are you mounting something to /varrun in /etc/fstab?
2006-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	strange... post your /etc/fstab on the same site pls
2006-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	that looks okay, doesn't explain your problem... xfs as root should be okay, although it's unusual... Can't really tell you what's going on. Is a re-install out of the question?
2006-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	soundray	h6w	just backup your /etc/ndiswrapper, or your entire /etc if you prefer
