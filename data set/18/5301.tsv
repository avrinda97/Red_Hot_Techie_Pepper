2010-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	zetheroo1		is anyone finding that they cannot access shared folders/files from a 10.04 system from their 10.10 system ?
2010-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	zetheroo1		my two 10.10 machines can access each other' shares but cannot access the shares on the 10.04 system
2010-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	zetheroo1		:(
2010-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	I'd try to go via command line route and to find out what error messages is it outputting
2010-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	got a command for me :)
2010-10-11T14:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	for starters there's smbtree which will enum. smb shares and to see if its visible, and then there's stuff like smbmount
2010-10-11T14:42:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	smbtree shows it there
2010-10-11T14:42:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	I can also see the folder in nautilus
2010-10-11T14:42:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	so ok maybe its a mounting issue
2010-10-11T14:43:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	how do I use smbmount?
2010-10-11T14:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	man smbmount
2010-10-11T14:48:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	does that look right?
2010-10-11T14:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	just give it a go, if its wrong correct it and try again
2010-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	mount.cifs: permission denied: no match for /mnt/Zonbu-Videos found in /etc/fstab
2010-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	why is this messing with fstab?
2010-10-11T14:52:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	its looking for alias within /etc/fstab, but the output seems skewed
2010-10-11T14:53:00.000Z	zetheroo1	psycho_oreos	this was the command I ended up doing after creating the folder "Zonbu-Videos" under /mnt ....  smbmount smb://zeth-zonbu/video /mnt/Zonbu-Videos -o rw
2010-10-11T14:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	zetheroo1	there's also this site yo might want to have a read: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/SMB-HOWTO-8.html
