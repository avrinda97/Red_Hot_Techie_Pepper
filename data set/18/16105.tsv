2004-11-13T10:19:00.000Z	edulix		hello !
2004-11-13T10:20:00.000Z	edulix		I have a dell inspiron 4150 laptop, and if I connect a ps2 mouse to it, touchpad goes crazy !
2004-11-13T10:21:00.000Z	edulix		if I don't connect an external mouse device, or if I connect a USB mouse, it works well
2004-11-13T10:21:00.000Z	edulix		(both of them at the same time, the external mouse and the touchpad via synaptics)
2004-11-13T10:21:00.000Z	kent	edulix	and then you shouldn't connect a ps2 mouse then, should you? ;)
2004-11-13T10:22:00.000Z	edulix	kent	oh, if happens that I have just a usb port
2004-11-13T10:22:00.000Z	edulix		so I don't want to waste it with the the usb
2004-11-13T10:22:00.000Z	kent	edulix	i was just joking. Perhaps it will help if you file a bugreport on ubuntu.
2004-11-13T10:22:00.000Z	edulix		ok
2004-11-13T10:22:00.000Z	edulix		I'll do it
2004-11-13T10:23:00.000Z	edulix	kent	note that this is not only related to ubuntu but also happens in suse 9.1
2004-11-13T10:23:00.000Z	kent		I have no clue at all what your problem is, im just using it since "it just works" :) I have had no problems at all so far :)
2004-11-13T10:23:00.000Z	edulix		hi !
2004-11-13T10:24:00.000Z	edulix	kent	do you have RAID or LVM?
2004-11-13T10:24:00.000Z	kent	edulix	nope.
2004-11-13T10:25:00.000Z	edulix	kent	something funny is thast even if I haven't got raid nor lvm, both services are activated at boot by default hehe
2004-11-13T10:26:00.000Z	kent	edulix	the same for me. But I would consider that not a bug, and perhaps maybe just one thing enabled default so other might not get into problem..  just guessing though. Its not a big problem for me, even though maybe my boot-time is lowered by 1 second or so,
2004-11-13T10:27:00.000Z	edulix	kent	everything that make the boottime smaller is welcomed to me !. it takes 1:30 to from kenrel loading to gnome loaded in my laptop :)
