2004-11-17T17:28:00.000Z	SmokingFire	Mojo_Jojo	As I understand avi is just a container. It works when playing in non full screen?
2004-11-17T17:28:00.000Z	SmokingFire	Mojo_Jojo	I don't know I haven't uncountred this problem myself. Maybe switching to full screen switches to another video mode that your driver/card has problems with.
