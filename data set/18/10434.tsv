2006-12-03T09:23:00.000Z	senator^		but if I had a computer for amusement I would install bsd instead
2006-12-03T09:25:00.000Z	senator^		where can I find that unbuntu light version that dyland talked about? dont find it on ubuntus homepage
2006-12-03T09:26:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	are you used to the linux nvironmet?
2006-12-03T09:27:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	long time since I used linux know so I have forgot most of it... but I think If I install it and start use it I will figure it out again :)
2006-12-03T09:27:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	xubuntu has xfce which is a bit more... user frindly than icewm
2006-12-03T09:28:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	ok
2006-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	however this ubuntu installtion is for a friend of mine that needs a simple to use operating system not for me, and I saw that ubuntu was pretty easy to understand so I thought that would be perfect for her since I got the impression it was realted to debian that is the best linux dist I heard
2006-12-03T09:30:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	then ubunutlite is NOT for that kind of use. It has all of the fat sliced off, and its built for efficiency instead of ease of use
2006-12-03T09:31:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	best best would be ubuntu or kubuntu itself unless the hardware is _very_ old
2006-12-03T09:31:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	ok I see...
2006-12-03T09:32:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	well thats the problem, its a 200mhz computer with 16 or 32mb ram... I was thinking of ubuntu or kubuntu but now I understand that they are slow on that computer so I think I will go with bsd instead and a simple xwindows installtion with just mozilla... ugly but functional
2006-12-03T09:33:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	i'm not entirely certain but i think xubuntu will work on that hardware
2006-12-03T09:34:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	ok a little while ago people sad it will be very slow if it works at all on that hardware
2006-12-03T09:34:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	couldnt find any spec. on ubuntus webpage :(
2006-12-03T09:34:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	gnome and kde will not be able to run on that hardware. ubuntulite will but it uses icewm
2006-12-03T09:35:00.000Z	senator^	devilsadvocate	anyway I think I chose openbsd and xwindows without any kde or other enhancement and the only firefox... think that will be fast, secure and functional but ugly interface :)
2006-12-03T09:36:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	you could go to #xubuntuand ask if you like
2006-12-03T09:44:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	senator^	i think its secure enough, but I really wouldnt know
