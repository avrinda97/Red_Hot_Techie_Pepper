2009-04-26T10:33:00.000Z	skierpage		Heya, I'm in the Kubuntu amd64 installer trying to figure out manual "Prepare Partitions" (with Konqueror running, impressive!).  Where's the online help for this complicated step?
2009-04-26T10:34:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 partitioning isn't really complicated.  Are you at the partition manager now?
2009-04-26T10:34:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 partition setup is partition setup.  Are you at the stage where you are to prepare partitions?
2009-04-26T10:35:00.000Z	skierpage	Firefishe	yup, I'm trying to figure out how to break up my spare partition into root-home-swap.
2009-04-26T10:35:00.000Z	skierpage	Firefishe	BTW thanks for helping out!  I'm happy to read web docs, but can't find something relevant.
2009-04-26T10:35:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 By spare partition, do you mean free space on the same drive as windows?  Or is the extra partition left over from another linux install, or what?
2009-04-26T10:36:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 np...
2009-04-26T10:36:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 /query me....
2009-04-26T10:36:00.000Z	skierpage	Firefishe	from windows I set up a spare 27GB D: partition that I can blow away.
2009-04-26T10:36:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 So that partition is ntfs?
2009-04-26T10:37:00.000Z	skierpage	Firefishe	what do you mean /query me....?  Firefishe, yes it is NTFS.  I see how to change it to something else like ext3 but AIUI the recommendation is to have root-home-swap.
2009-04-26T10:40:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 If you want to use the 27GB NTFS Partition, select the partition by double-clicking it--or maybe a single-click will do, don't do too many clicks, too fast.
2009-04-26T10:40:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 either that, or highlight it, then select delete
2009-04-26T10:40:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 Let the partition manager do it's thing, and when it's done, reselect it (it should show empty now.
2009-04-26T10:45:00.000Z	skierpage	Firefishe	is teh awesome-o
2009-04-26T12:45:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 You're back :)
2009-04-26T12:46:00.000Z	Firefishe	skierpage	 only if yer female ;)  Wait, I"m married, scratch that.   Only if you're an android ;) hee
