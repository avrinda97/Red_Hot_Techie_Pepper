2010-08-12T06:49:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	what's been the result so far? has the netflix box recieved an IP address ?
2010-08-12T06:49:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	no, just says 0.0.0.0
2010-08-12T06:50:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	what methods have you tried thus far ?
2010-08-12T06:52:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	doing that with incoming connection shuts off the connection from the wall
2010-08-12T06:57:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	apparently firestarter might have some options to setup ICS for you. if you go down the route of enabling ipforwarding , then you need a dhcp server running
2010-08-12T06:58:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	how new is your computer / netflix box btw ?
2010-08-12T06:58:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	and I don't know how to run a dhcp server.  every time I try I mess up
2010-08-12T06:58:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	the newer network cards autosense (non)crossover just fine these days
2010-08-12T06:59:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	computer is probably 6 years old (it has an Athlon 1800+ chip, and I bought it at a Goodwill computer store)
2010-08-12T06:59:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	funny thing is, it worked fine for a while back in 9.10, and then it just stopped working a month after I installed 10.04
2010-08-12T07:00:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	does this mean you managed the dhcp server ok last time ?
2010-08-12T07:01:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	I didn't set up a dhcp server
2010-08-12T07:01:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	then where did the netflix get it's IP ?
2010-08-12T07:11:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	are you trying anything? are you able to set static IP information on the netflix box ?
2010-08-12T07:11:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	not trying anything right now, computer had hard time booting, had to rescue GRUB
2010-08-12T07:13:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	ok, computer back to working
2010-08-12T07:13:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	bofh80	as for setting up static IP on Netflix box, I don't think it'll ket me
2010-08-12T07:14:00.000Z	bofh80	jdsbluedevl	it would be strange for it not too . i would think. but i don't have any experience with those things
