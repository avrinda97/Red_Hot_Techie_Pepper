2007-04-30T13:28:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	have you checked this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
2007-04-30T13:29:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	most likely... that was my problem... it's possible it's a problem with your hardware, but ubuntu is _really_ good at autodetect
2007-04-30T13:29:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	also, if you don't have a floppy drive, it'll take a few minutes longer
2007-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	what gfx card?
2007-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	is that ATI?
2007-04-30T13:32:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	"another display manager?
2007-04-30T13:32:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	what does "another display manager" mean? Did you have graphics at all?
2007-04-30T13:33:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	but it booted into KDE?
2007-04-30T13:34:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	blinking is normal for livecds... tries to detect proper res
2007-04-30T13:39:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	doubtful
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	Wheee... yes you can :)
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	That was my problem -- a scratch on the CD... check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM but I doubt it's your problem :(
2007-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	Possum	MIST_	great, once you get ubuntu installed you gotta try beryl :)
