2006-11-23T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	how did you grep for it?
2006-11-23T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	how many lines of output?
2006-11-23T14:54:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	what happens when you 'telnet localhost 21'?
2006-11-23T14:55:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	that's a good sign. What ftp client did you use for testing?
2006-11-23T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	you mean you enter 'ftp localhost' on a command line?
2006-11-23T14:57:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	and that gives a 421 error?
2006-11-23T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	have you looked through the config files in /etc/proftpd ?
2006-11-23T15:02:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	well done
2006-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	soundray	ebaad	that's a tall, tall screen ;)
