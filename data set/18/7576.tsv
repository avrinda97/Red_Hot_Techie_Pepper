2007-12-30T18:45:00.000Z	zenrium		i'd like to hear from someone who has set up vmware server 2 beta and had issues with port 903 and how you fixed it please..
2007-12-30T18:45:00.000Z	zenrium		i'm at a loss currently
2007-12-30T18:46:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	remote or local?
2007-12-30T18:49:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	local
2007-12-30T18:50:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	installed onto local pc.. using local browser.. the xinet environment appears to be configured to accept 903
2007-12-30T18:50:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	,does the port show up with netstat, does it listen on local/public or both,is it blocked by the firewall, can you connect with nc?
2007-12-30T18:50:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	no, no, dont think I have a firewall by default with ubuntu ?, nc not sure but telnet localhost 903 doesnt work.
2007-12-30T18:51:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	maybe, it clearly isnt listening then, and yes by defauly ubuntu does not come with a firewall on
2007-12-30T18:52:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	so even if its setup to use an xinet process its supposed to be listening? thought inet stuff just accepted when a request occurs.. rather than perm listens.
2007-12-30T18:52:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	in order to accept a request it has to be listening
2007-12-30T18:54:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	the fact that I am getting localhost [127.0.0.1] 903 (vmware-authd) : Connection refused -  this indicates that xinet is working right.. and pasisng the request thru to the right daemon.. so there must be a permisions or config issue with vmware-authd ?
2007-12-30T18:55:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	hmm yeah it does
2007-12-30T18:55:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	if the deamon refuses the connection it definitly is a vmware conf issue
2007-12-30T18:56:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	the joys that brings in and of itself :P
2007-12-30T18:59:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	 maybe it comes with network connections disabled by default, but that seems rather an odd thing to do
2007-12-30T19:06:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	o.O I had to do sudo aptitude reinstall xinetd
2007-12-30T19:06:00.000Z	rexy	zenrium	that seems, odd
2007-12-30T19:06:00.000Z	zenrium	rexy	ya!! very! :)  found it in here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware/Server
