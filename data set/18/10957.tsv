2006-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	what exactly is the issue?
2006-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	when i tried to open a webpage it said it could not connect to the server
2006-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	ok, so when the system boots, does it hang when it says "Starting DHCP"?
2006-10-01T09:31:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	no it booted up fine
2006-10-01T09:31:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	i just cannot pull up any webpages in firefox
2006-10-01T09:31:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	are you on a cable modem, dsl, dialup?
2006-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	i think it might be my wireless connection
2006-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	any ideas?
2006-10-01T09:33:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	im not sure, im looking for an automatic DHCP script
2006-10-01T09:34:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	you need to make sure that 1) your ubuntu can use your eth0 card, and 2) DHCP is auto grabbing you an IP
2006-10-01T09:34:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	how would i go about making sure it is doing that?
2006-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	i also noticed that i am on a wireless connection yet when i checked 'networking' under my admin menu it said my wireless connection was not yet configured
2006-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	from within Ubuntu, go to System > Administration > Networking
2006-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	try and use that networking configuration tool to set up your wireless.. i dont use wireless, so i dunno about drivers, etc. but you probably need the correct device driver installed
2006-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	skpl	RankorFodder	ok i will go mess with that and then be back.
2006-10-01T09:37:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	you should also try and browse around the manufacture's website to see if they have a linux driver for it
2006-10-01T10:30:00.000Z	RankorFodder	skpl	are you dual-booting, or are you going to re-install XP?
