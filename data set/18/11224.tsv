2006-08-29T08:53:00.000Z	zeronenorez		hello, who can edit grub/menu.lst?
2006-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	anyone with root access ;-)
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	savedefault will make it so when you select it, it makes it the default, there should be a default line at top with a number
2006-08-29T08:59:00.000Z	zeronenorez	disasm	really? i'll try
2006-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	for savedefault to work, default must be set to saved
2006-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	zeronenorez	disasm	how?
2006-08-29T09:03:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	yeah, set default 0 to either number starting at 0 from top, or savedefault to save the previous booted system
2006-08-29T09:04:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	then in your list of options make sure savedefault is in the stanza
2006-08-29T09:05:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	you aren't using software raid, are you?
2006-08-29T09:06:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	don't worry about it, if you were, you'd know
2006-08-29T09:06:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	software raid breaks when set to savedefault
2006-08-29T09:08:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	don't worry about it, it's quite a process to setup a dmraid, so I'm pretty sure you aren't using it
2006-08-29T09:08:00.000Z	zeronenorez	disasm	i use sudo apt-get install raid
2006-08-29T09:08:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	i don't think you want to setup a raid, you need identical hd's (at least 2, preferable 3+)
2006-08-29T09:09:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	it's just the savedefault will break your raid if you had set one up
2006-08-29T09:10:00.000Z	zeronenorez	disasm	i see
2006-08-29T09:13:00.000Z	zeronenorez	disasm	thx a lot
2006-08-29T09:14:00.000Z	disasm	zeronenorez	no problem
