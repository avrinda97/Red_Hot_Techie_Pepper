2008-08-07T03:27:00.000Z	pbtrn10k		hi all - i'm having trouble getting into gnome - problems with permissions on ~/.dmrc that i am unable to fix with chmod and problems locking ~/.ICEauthority - have tried chmodding and chowing but to no avail - can anyone help ?? ta :)
2008-08-07T03:28:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	try renaming them
2008-08-07T03:31:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	it didn't work, still get the .dmrc error where it wants 644 permissions and a locking problem with .ICEauthority
2008-08-07T03:32:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	Do a reboot, then switch to tty1 and log in and rename them then?
2008-08-07T03:33:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	renamed them from tty1 but will try a reboot just in case - thanks :) (possibly brb)
2008-08-07T03:36:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	no joy - am ircing from tty1 as i speak... erm, type
2008-08-07T03:38:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	Sorry, dont have any other ideas :( Renaming ICEauthority always solves those issues for me...
2008-08-07T03:39:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	just to confirm should my homdir be chmodded to 644 or 755?
2008-08-07T03:39:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	You can chmod -R 700 it
2008-08-07T03:40:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	You need it to be 7xx regardless
2008-08-07T03:42:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	are you still willing to help me? in the /xsession-errors file it says, after saying it can't create the Desktop, Documents etc folders in the home folder that it couldn't create the .gnome2 directory - is this revealing of anything?
2008-08-07T03:43:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	Yeah, that you dont have appropriate rights :p
2008-08-07T03:44:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	yeah, thought that might be the case, but chmod -R 700&& chown -R pete:pete don't do anything to help the situation
2008-08-07T03:45:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	Do it the other way around... so you're sure you own the stuff before you chmod
2008-08-07T03:46:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	cheers :)
2008-08-07T03:46:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	Did it work?
2008-08-07T03:47:00.000Z	pbtrn10k	hateball	yeah it did! thanks so much!!! it's the simple things that get by me with ubuntu - it's taking time to get used to ;)
2008-08-07T03:48:00.000Z	hateball	pbtrn10k	Good thing it got solved then =)
