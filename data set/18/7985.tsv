2007-10-20T19:34:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	it's open source, make a better one.
2007-10-20T19:35:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: Yes, thank but i know... i'm not stupid
2007-10-20T19:35:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	well, your question was, though
2007-10-20T19:36:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: You didn't understood my question ...
2007-10-20T19:36:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	your question was, "Why does VirtualBox have a ugly GUI ????". what is there to understand?
2007-10-20T19:37:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: I mean, i probably have a problem with GTK ....
2007-10-20T19:38:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	that's possible. which virtualbox are you using exactly? are you on GNOME?
2007-10-20T19:39:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: I'm running on Gutsy, so Gnome 2.20.1, and VB 1.5.0
2007-10-20T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	VB 1.5.0 from the repos?
2007-10-20T19:40:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: yes
2007-10-20T19:41:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	i suspect that GTK might be compiled statically in virtualbox, since "ldd /usr/bin/virtualbox" says "not a dynamic executable"
2007-10-20T19:41:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: Do you know what i mean when i'm talking about the interface ? It looks like a old interface...
2007-10-20T19:41:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	yes, i got it
2007-10-20T19:41:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	: well, so is there a solution Doc' ?
2007-10-20T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/virtualbox-ose/+bug/149607 is probably relevant
2007-10-20T19:45:00.000Z	LjL	keo92	and, virtualbox uses Qt not GTK :)
2007-10-20T19:46:00.000Z	keo92	LjL	oh, right...
