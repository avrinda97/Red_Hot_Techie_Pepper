2009-04-12T00:34:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	*edit* Solved it with a re-install.  <-- what?
2009-04-12T00:34:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	yea i have the problem again, and i don't want to reinstall
2009-04-12T00:34:00.000Z	Gnea		!compile | fliipping
2009-04-12T00:35:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	can you pastebin the output of this command:  find /etc -ls
2009-04-12T00:36:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	i'm running livecd right now, won't that matter?
2009-04-12T00:37:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	clearly, you'll need to mount the partition and replace /etc with the correct path to that etc directory.... you should also be able to install pastebinit, temporarily, and use that to paste the output
2009-04-12T00:37:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	ok, standby
2009-04-12T00:43:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	http://pastebin.com/d7f65ca7b it's weird though, with a lot of blank space at the top
2009-04-12T00:43:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	checking
2009-04-12T00:46:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	hrm, i'm not seeing anything out of place there... not sure why the whitespace is so prevalent, but that's beside the point... it's possible that either the memory, the hard drive or the motherboard are going bad... have you run memtest and/or fscked the drives when they're not mounted?
2009-04-12T00:46:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	not yet... :(   everthing is less than 2 years old tho
2009-04-12T00:47:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	also, reinstall fixes it
2009-04-12T00:51:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	2 years is a long time
2009-04-12T00:52:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	:p anyway, no errors found fsck
2009-04-12T00:52:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	of course, you can reinstall over and over again without actually testing anything to try and find out where the real problem is at
2009-04-12T00:52:00.000Z	Gnea	mikeize	i would reboot and run memtest
2009-04-12T00:53:00.000Z	mikeize	Gnea	i very much would like to find the problem... yes that is my next step... thank you for your help
