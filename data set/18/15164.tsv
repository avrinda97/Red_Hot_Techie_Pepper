2005-04-28T07:47:00.000Z	hua		hello, install ubuntu must change MBR?
2005-04-28T07:48:00.000Z	klaas	hua	unless you use the expert mode.
2005-04-28T07:50:00.000Z	hua	klaas	you mean if i use expert mode , i can edit mbr by hand, or it never touch mbr if i want. x
2005-04-28T07:51:00.000Z	klaas	hua	You can choose whether you want to install grub or lilo, and whether or not you'd like to overwrite the mbr.
2005-04-28T07:51:00.000Z	klaas	hua	If you choose to install a ubuntu-provided bootloader at all.
2005-04-28T07:55:00.000Z	klaas	hua	You can create a grub boot-floppy, do you have a bootloader installed at this moment?
2005-04-28T07:58:00.000Z	hua	klaas	Yes, I have  installed. But I want to install Ubuntu into my another computer which is new than I use now.
2005-04-28T07:58:00.000Z	klaas	hua	What runs on that other pc?
2005-04-28T07:59:00.000Z	hua	klaas	It's WinXP.
2005-04-28T08:00:00.000Z	klaas	hua	And what's the problem with installing grub on the mbr? You can boot winxp from grub.
2005-04-28T08:01:00.000Z	klaas	hua	and if you want it to boot windows by default you just alter the "default" in /boot/grub/menu.lst to the zero-based index of the windows entry, which is probably 4.
2005-04-28T08:02:00.000Z	hua	klaas	My computer has a feature, it can recover my data when it goes wrong, but it must do without changing mbr.
2005-04-28T08:04:00.000Z	klaas	hua	Okay, that explains. Maybe i can create a boot-floppy for you, you won't have to install grub, and you could boot from that. I'm not very experienced with creating grub bootfloppies though.
2005-04-28T08:07:00.000Z	hua	klaas	another question. It's necessry ubuntu install before 8g.
2005-04-28T08:08:00.000Z	klaas	hua	I'm not sure, though i don't think so.
2005-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	hua	klaas	I need your grub-boot floppy. thanks.
2005-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	klaas	hua	creating it as we speak.
2005-04-28T08:25:00.000Z	hua	klaas	How do you give me the boot floppy? Is a img or something else?
