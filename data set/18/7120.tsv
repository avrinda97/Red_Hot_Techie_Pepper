2008-02-07T11:58:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> the four lines you selected to boot..  the parameters
2008-02-07T12:00:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7->  why do you have single? you want to be in single user mode?
2008-02-07T12:01:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> what does your /mnt/boot/grub/device.map  content says?
2008-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> do you see the stage1.5 in your /mnt/boot/grub?
2008-02-07T12:05:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> how about  e2fs_stage1_5 and stage1 and stage2
2008-02-07T12:07:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> get into grub and point your root to hd0,2   hd0,2 is where your /boot is right? ie hda3?
2008-02-07T12:09:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> go and do it, assuming your /boot/initrd and /boot/vmlinuz are good ones
2008-02-07T12:10:00.000Z	amenado		mib_hoimx7d7-> good luck

2008-06-22T07:51:00.000Z	amenado	bluefoxx	go ahead, if you have the liveCd or alternate..boot it up
2008-06-22T07:53:00.000Z	amenado	bluefoxx	once more, the sequence will be to install via a liveCd or alternate CD and then do an upgrade via synaptic or command line apt-get upgrade
2008-06-22T07:56:00.000Z	amenado	bluefoxx	apt-get upgrade once you have an installed base
