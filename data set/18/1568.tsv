2011-06-24T19:19:00.000Z	rns		so I just did "mv log /linode" where log was a text file and linode was a folder in the same directory.  log has disappeared and doesn't show up on a file system search.  What just happened?
2011-06-24T19:20:00.000Z	edbian	rns	It's in linode (a folder in /)
2011-06-24T19:21:00.000Z	rns	edbian	 so it's all the way in my root directory?  Not the directory where I ran the command?
2011-06-24T19:22:00.000Z	edbian	rns	Because you gave it /linode (meaning a folder named linode in /) not just linode (meaning a folder in this folder)
2011-06-24T19:22:00.000Z	rns	edbian	ahh I found it.  But it's not a folder - log is still a file but now it's named linode
2011-06-24T19:23:00.000Z	edbian	rns	If there was no folder /linode (a folder named linode in /) then the command would have created a file named linode in root (that is actually log)
2011-06-24T19:23:00.000Z	rns	edbian	so now it's not letting me delete the file from my gui
2011-06-24T19:24:00.000Z	edbian	rns	The gui is not root so it cannot edit things in /
2011-06-24T19:24:00.000Z	edbian	rns	I presume you actually run sudo mv log /linode
2011-06-24T19:24:00.000Z	rns	edbian	yes I used sudo
2011-06-24T19:25:00.000Z	rns	edbian	so I have to use absolute paths when using the mv command?  Are there any shortcuts for this?
2011-06-24T19:25:00.000Z	edbian	rns	That made you root when you did it so the new file /linode which is actually a moved and renamed log is owned by root.  You need to be root to edit it
2011-06-24T19:25:00.000Z	edbian	rns	You do not have to use absolute paths.  You did just now.  Any path starting with / is absolute (it's starts from /   !!)
2011-06-24T19:26:00.000Z	edbian	rns	What you wanted to run was probably mv log linode/   (a trailing slash indicates a folder) but if it already is a folder the system figures it out.
2011-06-24T19:26:00.000Z	rns	edbian	so that would work in my current directory?  It would automatically find the folder linode?
2011-06-24T19:26:00.000Z	edbian	rns	If there is a folder in your current working directory it would find it.  (yes)
2011-06-24T19:27:00.000Z	rns	edbian	cool that's working, thanks
2011-06-24T19:28:00.000Z	edbian	rns	sure
