2007-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		what's the name of the partition manager in the ubuntu installer?
2007-10-12T07:24:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		does anyone know the name of the partition manager in the ubuntu installer?
2007-10-12T07:25:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	so you allready have a windows install on the drive ?
2007-10-12T07:26:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	got no idea, I would try a reboot and start again (if you haven't allready).
2007-10-12T07:27:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	don't know if it has any chance of helping.  it just that if the drive is working I don't know what else to try.
2007-10-12T07:28:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	NO! have you got the drive mounted ?
2007-10-12T07:30:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	maybe the partition manager can't get access to /dev/hda or whatever the drive is.
2007-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	try quiting the installer, and unmount the drive and restart the installer.
2007-10-12T07:33:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	if you have an icon for the drive on the Desktop you can unmount with that.  "right click" on the icon once, and select "unmount volume"
2007-10-12T07:35:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	have you have accessed the HDD while running the LiveCD ?
2007-10-12T07:38:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	I am not sure what is going on, try a reboot and see if the problem still happens.
2007-10-12T07:39:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	nrdb__	tried that already
2007-10-12T07:39:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	nrdb__	still empty list in partition manager
2007-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	which version are you trying to install ?
2007-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	nrdb__	ubuntu 7.04 feisty fawn desktop i386 32-bit version
2007-10-12T07:42:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	maybe the 7.10 installer will work better with you setup.
2007-10-12T07:42:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	nrdb__	7.10 is gutsy isn't it?
2007-10-12T07:43:00.000Z	nrdb__	Bo^Dick	yep, beta out now, 7.10 released in 6 days.
