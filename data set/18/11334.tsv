2008-02-19T01:52:00.000Z	xyblor		Is there a way to run a script automatically every time you log in?
2008-02-19T01:52:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	yes
2008-02-19T01:53:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	what do you want to accomplish?
2008-02-19T01:53:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	I want to run xrandr to setup dual head display
2008-02-19T01:54:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	it's really simple, just a 2-line script, but I'm tired of running it manually every time I log in
2008-02-19T01:54:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	so you want to run the script before the graphical interface kicks in
2008-02-19T01:55:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	Ideally I want to run it after the xserver starts, but before the window manager starts.
2008-02-19T01:55:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	but even running it after the WM is fine too
2008-02-19T01:57:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	the simplest way to accomplish this is to put the script in /etc/X11/Xsession.d
2008-02-19T01:57:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	so I just copy it over to there and it will run automatically?
2008-02-19T01:58:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	it does on debian, i'm not sure if it works for ubuntu
2008-02-19T01:58:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	you can give it a shot though, don't forget to chmod +x the script
2008-02-19T01:59:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	okay thanks, I'll give it a try :-)
2008-02-19T02:10:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	it didn't work out for you?
2008-02-19T02:10:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	too bad
2008-02-19T02:15:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	I tried copying the script to /etc/X11/Xsession.d/, but that didn't work
2008-02-19T02:15:00.000Z	xyblor	cherwin	I'm wondering if those scripts are executed at all
2008-02-19T02:18:00.000Z	cherwin	xyblor	you have to experiment then
