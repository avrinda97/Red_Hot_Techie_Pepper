2009-11-21T10:13:00.000Z	noneNN		Im having problems installing ubuntu in a netbook, I have a bangho netbook B-NOX1, and Im trying to install ubuntu via USB pendrive, the bios says it can boot from USB HDD, but It doesnt detect the usb drive, Ive tried booting from the pendrive with other machine and it works perfect, Im wondering if could be a pendrive size issue, its 8gb... should I try with a smaller one?
2009-11-21T10:14:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	Is it set to boot the pendrive automatically? Or do you have to press esc or whatever, to go into a boot menu?
2009-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	ive tried both ways and it didnt work out
2009-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	that's weird, are you sure the pendrive is bootable?
2009-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	yes, i can boot it in my notebook
2009-11-21T10:17:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	Okay, so it's definately a problem with the bios on your netbook, does pressing escape during boot up present you with a boot menu?
2009-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	yeah i mean i can go into the menus and select all usb entries and none of them will work
2009-11-21T10:21:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	I don't know what to tell you man, what happens when you boot from the pendrive?
2009-11-21T10:22:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	im my notebook its boots perfectly, and so in other computers, but the issue is with the the netbook, but i dont know if its somehitng about size of pendrive and bios compability...
2009-11-21T10:23:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	It really shouldn't be that, netbooks are very recent creatures, I'm sure any bios will handle an 8gb stick
2009-11-21T10:24:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	mmm i havent tried with another pendrive... it could be the pendrive too... ive seen some guys having similar problems on the web
2009-11-21T10:24:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	Does the pendrive actually come up in the boot menu?
2009-11-21T10:25:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	I'm not talking about going into the bios, I'm talking about a little menu that pops up, and gives you a choice of bootable media found
2009-11-21T10:26:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	yes, but it doesnt detect the pendrive i can only see the sata driev
2009-11-21T10:27:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	ahh okay
2009-11-21T10:28:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	have you got another pendrive you can try?
2009-11-21T10:29:00.000Z	noneNN	chrionix	an mp3 player but im worried i might have the mp3 player software if i format it
2009-11-21T10:30:00.000Z	chrionix	noneNN	yeah, I wouldn't advise using that
