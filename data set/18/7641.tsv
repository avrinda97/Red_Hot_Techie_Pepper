2007-12-06T01:25:00.000Z	Spirotot		So I finally got my speakers to work on my laptop with the ALSA drivers (?). But, when I plug headphones in, the external speakers don't turn off - I'm getting sound through both the headphones and speakers...
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	robeph	Spirotot	hehehe,   you need to go into your mixer
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	robeph		and cut the ext speaker down
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	robeph		you have seperate volume controls in the mixer for headphone / external
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	Spirotot		Ah...
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	Spirotot		Ok...
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	robeph		I think it's dmix maybe
2007-12-06T01:26:00.000Z	robeph		I dunno whayt yuou use tho
2007-12-06T01:27:00.000Z	Spirotot	robeph	I use alsamixer. :S
2007-12-06T01:27:00.000Z	robeph		that works
2007-12-06T01:27:00.000Z	robeph		you should see the right things in there
2007-12-06T01:27:00.000Z	robeph		just hit "m" over the external devices
2007-12-06T01:27:00.000Z	robeph		and it'll mut'm
2007-12-06T01:28:00.000Z	robeph		I think you can save presets
2007-12-06T01:28:00.000Z	robeph		so like you stick yer hphone in and just hit like ctrl-2 and load it
2007-12-06T01:28:00.000Z	robeph		I forget the exact manner of doing os though
2007-12-06T01:28:00.000Z	Spirotot		Ok... I'm trying it now...
2007-12-06T01:37:00.000Z	Spirotot	robeph	I'm still having problems...
