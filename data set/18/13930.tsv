2006-04-29T08:44:00.000Z	amphi	lgc	what's the problem?
2006-04-29T08:45:00.000Z	lgc	amphi	the thing is that with both k3b and Gnomebaker I get that cdrecord can't get the operation through. It seems the unit is configured readonly.
2006-04-29T08:46:00.000Z	amphi	lgc	what happens if you use cdrecord? the error message might be more informative
2006-04-29T08:47:00.000Z	lgc	amphi	It says there are unresolved issues with 2.6 kernels or something like that. And then I get that it can't write to the CD.
2006-04-29T08:48:00.000Z	amphi	lgc	does cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus show the writer?
2006-04-29T08:49:00.000Z	lgc	amphi	what should it say?
2006-04-29T08:49:00.000Z	amphi	lgc	it should show which device the writer is
2006-04-29T08:50:00.000Z	lgc	amphi	"Warning: Using badly designed ATAPI via /dev/hd* interface. cdrecord: No such file or directory. Cannot open '/dev/hd*'. Cannot open SCSI driver."
