2005-11-06T16:23:00.000Z	Parisi		If i find myself soing a bunch of root commands i find it more convenient being root as opposed to "sudo" everything.
2005-11-06T16:24:00.000Z	Parisi		But i might be wrong.
2005-11-06T16:26:00.000Z	Parisi		Ok, heres a question, how do i disable root then.
2005-11-06T16:26:00.000Z	Parisi		Cool cool
2005-11-06T16:27:00.000Z	Parisi		stylish Scroll up.
2005-11-06T16:28:00.000Z	Parisi		Bad link.
2005-11-06T16:30:00.000Z	Parisi		Of course, a Sony.
2005-11-06T16:30:00.000Z	Parisi		Sony's are nothing but problems with linux.
2005-11-06T16:31:00.000Z	acar	Parisi	I found that out the hard way.  Ubuntu was my 3rd distro attempt.
2005-11-06T16:31:00.000Z	acar	Parisi	however I found Ubuntu succeeded in 95% of where the others failed.
2005-11-06T16:31:00.000Z	Parisi	acar	I had a Sony before, they are tricky and not open source friendly, sony is a crappy company.
2005-11-06T16:32:00.000Z	Parisi	acar	I would look into loading the audio module manually and see what happens.
2005-11-06T16:33:00.000Z	acar	Parisi	I agree with you so far. but the intel 915 chipset shouldn't be too big a problem, another distro installation was using the sound card..
2005-11-06T16:33:00.000Z	Parisi	acar	Look for the boot message too, with dmesg
2005-11-06T16:33:00.000Z	acar	Parisi	Thanks, I'll try it.
2005-11-06T16:33:00.000Z	Parisi	acar	do a lsmod command and see if the module is alreayd loaded.
2005-11-06T16:35:00.000Z	Parisi	acar	Open a terminal and type dsp
2005-11-06T16:42:00.000Z	acar	Parisi	Thanks for your suggestions.
