2009-01-31T08:30:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	Is that a yes/no kind of option?
2009-01-31T08:31:00.000Z	n8tuserf	malibu	-> or maybe you can disable the GSSAPI authentications
2009-01-31T08:32:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	That sounds more along the lines of what I need to do
2009-01-31T08:37:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	how do I disable GSSAPI auths?
2009-01-31T08:39:00.000Z	n8tuserf	malibu	-> comment them
2009-01-31T08:39:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	Yeah found it.. sshd_config
2009-01-31T08:40:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	Turning off GSSAPI didn't work
2009-01-31T08:41:00.000Z	n8tuserf	malibu	-> did you restart sshd ?
2009-01-31T08:42:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	yup
2009-01-31T08:42:00.000Z	n8tuserf	malibu	-> try to google for info on such
2009-01-31T08:44:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	Yeah.. I will keep trying
2009-01-31T08:45:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	This might be something... I just noticed console-kit-daemon using 99% CPU
2009-01-31T08:47:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	Awesome I think that was it
2009-01-31T08:48:00.000Z	n8tuserf	malibu	-> what was it?
2009-01-31T08:52:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	I'm reading a long big report right now on consolekit
2009-01-31T08:53:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	It seems I got bit by this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/consolekit/+bug/284229
2009-01-31T08:53:00.000Z	malibu	n8tuserf	I need to run an update
