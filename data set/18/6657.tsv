2008-04-16T04:49:00.000Z	NetEcho_		or similar app
2008-04-16T04:49:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	search for keywords in synaptic,  in the system admin menu
2008-04-17T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	black list your internal card module in modprobe
2008-04-17T06:45:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Pelo	 how do I do this?
2008-04-17T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	  open a terminal ,  type lsmod  locate the module for your internal wifi in there,  make a note of it ,  then type  sudo modprobe -r  modulename  that will remove it from the list
2008-04-17T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	 it should,  if not   man modprobe , see what options exist to permenantly do it
2008-04-17T06:48:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Pelo	I think both wireless cards use the atheros drivers
2008-04-17T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	isnT' there a listing that looks like the model number for your card in there ?
2008-04-17T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	or ... can you disable your internal card from the bios ?
2008-04-17T06:49:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Pelo	 nada the closest to wifi drivers I see in there is ath_pci and ath_hal
2008-04-17T06:51:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Pelo	 nah the bios doesn't let me dissable any hardware, only allows to put a password on and change boot order
2008-04-17T06:51:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	in the chipset section usualy
2008-04-17T06:52:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Pelo	 there is Information, Main Security Boot and Exit its nothing like a standard bios either
2008-04-17T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	 no bios is that limited,  dig deeper
2008-04-17T06:52:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Pelo	trust me this one is. I've never once on any system in the hundreds of machines I've worked with found a bios this limited
2008-04-17T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	main,  look for a section abot chipset
2008-04-17T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	NetEcho_	ok then ,  well you'll hve to figure it out on your own cause I don't know  try here www.ubuntuforums.org
