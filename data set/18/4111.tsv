2009-06-11T21:20:00.000Z	lucax		is there anything like finder? i mean a file manager with finder-style?
2009-06-11T21:22:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	nautilus is like finder
2009-06-11T21:22:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	it is the default file manager
2009-06-11T21:22:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	it doest not include all functions that finder has...
2009-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	like what?
2009-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	lots.... just watch some video on youtube
2009-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	i have used OS X since 10.2, and I'm not sure what is missing
2009-06-11T21:24:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	10.5 or 10.6 just watch it, its intredible
2009-06-11T21:24:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	i have used 10.5's finder, but not 10.6's, it isn't out
2009-06-11T21:25:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	can you be specific?
2009-06-11T21:26:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	if you feel functionality is missing, you can submit an idea to brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2009-06-11T21:26:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	it has preview of almost all kinds of files, and a quick look for any file type... very usefull... and can do searchs from the manu panel...
2009-06-11T21:28:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	search is available in ubuntu & nautilus gives small previews of files. if you want similar functionality to Quick Look, submit it to Ubuntu Brainstorm
2009-06-11T21:28:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	i dont have an account...
2009-06-11T21:29:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	create one :)
2009-06-11T21:29:00.000Z	cabrey	lucax	and yes quick look is very useful, however, it is not apart of the Finder, it is a different system entirely ;)
2009-06-11T21:30:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	hehe im lazzy, it would be cool to have a all-in-one media player like windows media or mac os x equeavalent
2009-06-11T21:31:00.000Z	lucax	cabrey	yeah i know what u mean... but im just a regular user
