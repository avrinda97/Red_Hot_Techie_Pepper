2010-08-23T01:09:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	how come you cant boot the os and install from there ?
2010-08-23T01:13:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	 are you sure the ati driver will fix this problem ?
2010-08-23T01:14:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	installed the ATI driver before rebooting?
2010-08-23T01:16:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	so all your problems came when you installed the ATI driver ?
2010-08-23T01:20:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	is reinstalling an option? sometimes its more trouble to fix it with guides than its worth :)
2010-08-23T03:31:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	 you are back up and running then..
2010-08-23T03:32:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	try chromium dev ppa...and the partner repo.. and install sun java
2010-08-23T03:34:00.000Z	netsavy006	duffydack	 Thanks for the info, but I did ask a little quick cuz I did check and I can run java apps in Google Chrome for the moment.
2010-08-23T03:35:00.000Z	duffydack	netsavy006	well, (opinion) if you wanna test the latest chromes out, try dev.. its newer than stable but not as fresh as daily...
