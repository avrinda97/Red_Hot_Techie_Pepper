2006-11-17T09:39:00.000Z	stefania	pirast	i have just installed ubuntu server, using the ncurses installer. I have used the ncurses partitoning tool and found it very easy to use, specially for creating a raid1 arry.
2006-11-17T09:40:00.000Z	stefania	pirast	now i need to create another raid1 set, without using the instalaltion disk
2006-11-17T09:40:00.000Z	stefania	pirast	can you help me?
