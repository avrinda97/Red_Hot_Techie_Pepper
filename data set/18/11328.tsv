2006-08-31T06:19:00.000Z	looktj		I need to partition my hard drive...to install windows
2006-08-31T06:19:00.000Z	looktj		what a good partition software in ubuntu?
2006-08-31T06:20:00.000Z	looktj		im running ubuntu on my whole drive
2006-08-31T06:20:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	nothing wrong with that.  what do you need to do?
2006-08-31T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	probably everyone, but you'll never know unless you ask a question  :)
2006-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	a warning; windows is sometimes very bitchy about booting from anywhere other than first partition on primary master
2006-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	the dual boot part is easy, if windows runs.
2006-08-31T07:27:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	yes, that's fine
2006-08-31T07:28:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	go ahead and install windows on the third partition.  if the install completes and it boots, then come back and we'll help you set up dual boot.
2006-08-31T07:28:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	before installing windows, back up the mbr as follows:
2006-08-31T07:28:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	dd if=/dev/hda of=/root/mbr-backup bs=512 count=1
2006-08-31T07:28:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	sorry, use    sudo dd if=/dev/hda of=/root/mbr-backup bs=512 count=1
2006-08-31T07:28:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	then what you'll do by installing windows is easily reversible
2006-08-31T07:29:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	as I said, if windows happily boots from hda3, your in good shape and we just add a few lines to your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-08-31T09:31:00.000Z	looktj	sethk	im back
2006-08-31T09:32:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	I'm back
2006-08-31T12:04:00.000Z	sethk	looktj	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-08-31T06:54:00.000Z	looktj	sethk	are you on?
