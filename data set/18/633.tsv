2011-11-21T07:13:00.000Z	egoflux		so i'm in fedora 15 and i want to mount my ubuntu partition
2011-11-21T07:13:00.000Z	egoflux		but i cant seem to find the ubuntu partition
2011-11-21T07:15:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	it is on the same hard drive as your fedora partition?
2011-11-21T07:16:00.000Z	egoflux	iuriguilherme	yes it is...but i installed ubuntu with wubi
2011-11-21T07:17:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	you are trying to access this partition on windows then?
2011-11-21T07:17:00.000Z	egoflux	iuriguilherme	no from fedora
2011-11-21T07:17:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	well i would figure where is your fedora partition on /dev
2011-11-21T07:17:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	ubuntu partition should be in the same device
2011-11-21T07:18:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	for example, if your fedora partition is on /dev/sda6 your ubuntu partition is the same thing but with another number instead of 6
2011-11-21T07:19:00.000Z	egoflux	iuriguilherme	i know that but when i do df -h there's no partition that could be ubuntus...its basically ntfs for windows and the fedora ext
2011-11-21T07:20:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	well i suspect you erased that partition of yours
2011-11-21T07:20:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	nevermind, i just read that you used wubi
2011-11-21T07:21:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	in that case Severian is right, it is not a partition, it is a file you should look for
2011-11-21T07:21:00.000Z	egoflux	iuriguilherme	what could that file be called?
2011-11-21T07:23:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	well first you try to mount it with the mount command, if it doesn't work then you should try something like dd or ddrescue
2011-11-21T07:23:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	i can't help you much because i have no idea how this file is encoded
2011-11-21T07:29:00.000Z	egoflux	iuriguilherme	got it working man...thanks for the help
2011-11-21T07:50:00.000Z	iuriguilherme	egoflux	no problem
