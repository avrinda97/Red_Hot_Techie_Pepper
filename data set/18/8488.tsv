2007-10-01T06:47:00.000Z	XiXaQ		has anyone been able to play online poker in Ubuntu? I can only find windows software.
2007-10-01T06:47:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	i dont do poker, but have you tested running those apps on Wine?
2007-10-01T06:47:00.000Z	XiXaQ	scguy318	yes.
2007-10-01T06:48:00.000Z	XiXaQ	scguy318	they depend heavily on IE, it seems. I've installed ies4linux, but that doesn't seem to help any at all.
2007-10-01T06:48:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	thats because ies4linux goes into its own wine folder
2007-10-01T06:48:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	you could try viewing AppDb entry on Internet Explorer at winehq.org
2008-01-02T13:49:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	wget -R but PLEASE use --wait
2008-01-02T13:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	scguy318	no, that still results in only the index.html file being downloaded. The manpage also sais --mirror covers -r.
2008-01-02T13:54:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	maybe robots.txt is in force?
2008-01-02T13:54:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	lemme look at the site
2008-01-02T14:00:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	hmm, unfortunately I dunno :(
2008-01-02T14:01:00.000Z	XiXaQ	scguy318	seems like it's because the site is moved permanently to www.djangoproject.com
2008-01-02T14:01:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	don't think it's that
2008-01-02T14:02:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	oh, working
2008-01-02T14:02:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	wget --mirror --wait=5 www.djangoproject.com
2008-01-02T14:03:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	please set your --wait, would suck for the server if you didn't
2008-01-02T14:03:00.000Z	scguy318	XiXaQ	try that, working?
2008-01-02T14:09:00.000Z	XiXaQ	scguy318	oh.. What does --wait do?
