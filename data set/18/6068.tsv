2008-08-12T05:25:00.000Z	hal_v2		Can I get some help with a Amarok problem I'm having, music is kind of essential to my lifestyle.
2008-08-12T05:27:00.000Z	hal_v2		Amarok says it cannot play mp3 files and when I try to install the support it says there was an error, then says i need to install "libxine1-ffmpeg" manually. When I try to it says that shit's broken.
2008-08-12T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	pastebin what it actually says verbatim...
2008-08-12T05:29:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list and the output of 'apt-cache policy libxine1-bin'

2008-08-12T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list and the output of 'apt-cache policy libxine1-bin'

2008-08-12T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	open /etc/apt/sources.list in Text Editor
2008-08-12T06:42:00.000Z	hal_v2	jrib	sorry it took so long http://pastebin.com/m1b519744.
2008-08-12T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	I've lost your error paste, can you paste that again?
2008-08-12T06:42:00.000Z	hal_v2	jrib	http://pastebin.com/m52fcaa69
2008-08-12T06:46:00.000Z	hal_v2	jrib	anything?
2008-08-12T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	add the -security universe and multiverse repos
2008-08-12T06:49:00.000Z	hal_v2	jrib	any dummy instructions for that. I'm in repositories, just don't see what you mean.
2008-08-12T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	do this 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and add ' universe multiverse' to the end of line 56 (deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hardy-security main restricted).  Save, then run 'sudo apt-get update'
2008-08-12T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	hal_v2	did that work out ok?
2008-08-12T07:04:00.000Z	hal_v2	jrib	that did it. You're a god.
