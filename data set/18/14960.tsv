2006-05-15T06:32:00.000Z	gnat_x		any takers on why the installer would fail when trying to install the kernel.
2006-05-15T06:33:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	the cd could be bad
2006-05-15T06:33:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	*nod* that's what i was thinking. though i just burned it today. :(
2006-05-15T06:33:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	how did you download it?
2006-05-15T06:34:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	wget
2006-05-15T06:34:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	did you check the md5sums?
2006-05-15T06:34:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	nope. should have though. but i did run a check on the cd from within the installer.
2006-05-15T06:35:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	then it should be ok, is the installer still up on your screen?
2006-05-15T06:35:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	yeah.
2006-05-15T06:35:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	right where is failed
2006-05-15T06:36:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	one of the virtual terminals shows debugging output try Ctrl+Alt+F1-4
2006-05-15T06:36:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	f4
2006-05-15T06:36:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	"dpkg returned an error code (1)"
2006-05-15T06:37:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	you might try restarting the install, if it fails again, check the md5 and reburn possilby at a lower speed
2006-05-15T06:38:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	do you know off the top of your head where this installs to? might have made a partition too small (old machine small disk)
2006-05-15T06:38:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	the kernel goes into /boot
2006-05-15T06:39:00.000Z	NoUse	gnat_x	how big did you make boot?
2006-05-15T06:45:00.000Z	gnat_x	NoUse	yeah, its too small. i think that's the problem
