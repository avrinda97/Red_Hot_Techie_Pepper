2006-02-26T11:50:00.000Z	jbmagic		why does other distro make you get the new updated version of there distro when ever it comes out and you have to download the iso again and install over.   i glad UBuntu is not like that. just a simple command to use
2006-02-26T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 you may be better off doing a reisntall howeger when the next version comes out.
2006-02-26T11:50:00.000Z	jbmagic	Dr_Willis	why is that?
2006-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 when EVERYTHING gets updated at once.. :P it can be.. well finicky.. theres always seems to be people comming in here with 'issues' when upgrading from one relase to another.
2006-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 i just keep home on a seperate partition. and then reinstall with every new release.
2006-02-26T11:52:00.000Z	jbmagic	Dr_Willis	ok i see..  will i lose what i have already isntall?
2006-02-26T11:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 proberly. but its fairly trivial to reinstall the stuff.
2006-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	jbmagic	Dr_Willis	so anything in the /home partion wont get lost.?
2006-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 if you have /home on its own partition - you can chose to not reformat it.
2006-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	jbmagic	Dr_Willis	is /home where the apps gets install too?
2006-02-26T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 nope.
2006-02-26T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 /home is where the users keep their stuff.
2006-02-26T11:55:00.000Z	jbmagic	Dr_Willis	i guess it wont be so bad to download a new .iso version of ubantu when it ever comes out and reinstall the apps  over again
2006-02-26T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 i look it as a every 6 mo 'house' cleaning. :P
2006-02-26T11:56:00.000Z	jbmagic	Dr_Willis	is that how often a new version of ubantu come out
2006-02-26T11:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 new release every 6mo.
2006-02-26T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 "dapper" is the next relsase due out in like 2 mo.
2006-02-26T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jbmagic	 the 'version' number - is the date of release I belive.
