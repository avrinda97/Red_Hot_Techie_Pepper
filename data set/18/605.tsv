2011-12-03T23:28:00.000Z	elementary-site6		I have upgraded my kernel to 3.1.4-030104-generic and tried installing proprietary drivers after that, but it failed.
2011-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	then we can't help you
2011-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	elementary-site6	ThinkT510	Why?
2011-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	you are not using a kernel from the repos
2011-12-03T23:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	how did you get the kernel? ppa? or compiled?
2011-12-03T23:30:00.000Z	elementary-site6	ThinkT510	I got it of the http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2011-12-03T23:30:00.000Z	elementary-site6	ThinkT510	I know what a PPA is.
2011-12-03T23:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	see the warning? if you want support contact the ppa maintainer
2011-12-03T23:31:00.000Z	elementary-site6	ThinkT510	Well who's the maintainer? How do I get that info?
2011-12-03T23:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	i don't know, i stick to the repos
2011-12-03T23:32:00.000Z	elementary-site6	ThinkT510	Okay, I've tried downloading the drivers of the Nvidia site.
2011-12-03T23:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	once again, we can't help you with that
2011-12-03T23:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	anything you add outside of the official repos you need to get support from where you got it
2011-12-03T23:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	you should be able to use the restricted drivers dialog thing
2011-12-03T23:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	not sure if it would work with the kernel you installed though
2011-12-03T23:41:00.000Z	elementary-site6	ThinkT510	However, it does not show up (not because of the kernel, it's because it's Maverick)
2011-12-03T23:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	i think it is called jockey-gtk or gtk-jockey
2011-12-03T23:44:00.000Z	ThinkT510	elementary-site6	its there
