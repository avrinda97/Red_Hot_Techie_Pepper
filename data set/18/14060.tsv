2005-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	pesco		Is it correct that there is no "gcc" executable on ubuntu, only "gcc-3.3" or so?
2005-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	no
2005-09-21T15:56:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	packages.ubuntu.com
2005-09-21T15:56:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	Isn't there a command line tool?
2005-09-21T15:56:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	apt-file or dpkg -S for installed packages
2005-09-21T15:57:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	Thank you, apt-file is what I was looking for.
2005-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	install build-essential and there will be
2005-09-21T15:59:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	Oh, ok. :)
2005-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	What is?
2005-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	funny gcc options
2005-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	it's very very rare that they actually help
2005-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	If you know what to do, they can make all the difference.
2005-09-21T16:04:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	really?  which of your applications are cpu-bound?
2005-09-21T16:04:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	Stop ranting. I have no idea. Which is why I have not compiled anything from source yet.
2005-09-21T16:04:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	right, this is my point
2005-09-21T16:05:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	Yes, but there is no need to get it into me.
2005-09-21T16:06:00.000Z	pesco	bob2	I was just wondering what the command was, so I know, when the time comes that one of my programs is running dead-slow and I just know it's because it doesn't use the altivec-instructions my Powerbook supports.
2005-09-21T16:06:00.000Z	bob2	pesco	pentium-builder + apt-get source
