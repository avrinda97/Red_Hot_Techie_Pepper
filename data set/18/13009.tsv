2006-01-25T14:53:00.000Z	Romeyo		i have sis190 ethernet card..
2006-01-25T14:53:00.000Z	Romeyo		but ubuntu is not detecting it.. so i downloaded a .c file for it from the motherboard site.. now where to find the kernel source?
2006-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	Romeyo		i searched in /usr/src/ n found nothing
2006-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	is this a very new card?
2006-01-25T14:55:00.000Z	Romeyo	nevyn	i dunno its new or old.. :(
2006-01-25T14:55:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	what's lspci say about it?
2006-01-25T14:57:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	what's the file you downloaded from sis called?
2006-01-25T14:57:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	it's probably just a pci-id patch and file rename
2006-01-25T14:58:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	ok I have that driver..
2006-01-25T15:00:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	just run "sudo modprobe sis190"
2006-01-25T15:12:00.000Z	Romeyo	nevyn	it says Module not found ..
2006-01-25T15:12:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	:(
2006-01-25T15:12:00.000Z	Romeyo	nevyn	what to do now?
2006-01-25T15:13:00.000Z	nevyn	Romeyo	downloading and installing a newer kernel would be better than building from scratch
2006-01-25T15:13:00.000Z	Romeyo	nevyn	ok i will do that.. i have to do any changes in ubuntu? becoz i can't find the old kernel for my ubuntu
2006-01-25T15:14:00.000Z	Romeyo	nevyn	i did rebuild of kernel twice in fedora 2
