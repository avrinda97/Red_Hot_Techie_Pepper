2010-03-24T21:36:00.000Z	bipolar		does debconf handle changes in /etc/nsswitch.conf? I cannot find any settings for it. So far I'm editting the file by hand.
2010-03-24T21:37:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	I think thats the only way to configure it is by hand.
2010-03-24T21:37:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	that would really suck.
2010-03-24T21:38:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	there is a man page for it.
2010-03-24T21:39:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	the probblem isn't configuring the file. the problem is I want to preseed answers for an automated install that uses ldap.
2010-03-24T21:40:00.000Z	histo		!ohmy | thu
2010-03-24T21:40:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	ahh
2010-03-24T21:40:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	you migh have to do some reading on that.
2010-03-24T21:40:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	or ask devs
2010-03-24T21:40:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	I'd rather not build a custom package to configure one file. I've done that already. :P
2010-03-24T21:41:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	well its genereated by somethihng.  Just ahve to figure out what.
2010-03-24T21:41:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	and it interacts the with /lib/libnss...
2010-03-24T21:41:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	yeah. you're right. gotta be something.
2010-03-24T21:44:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/nss_db.txt
2010-03-24T21:45:00.000Z	histo	bipolar	but accorfding to the man page its part of libc5
2010-03-24T21:46:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	looks like the package base-files creates it.
2010-03-24T21:50:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	I still cant figure out how it's created though.
2010-03-24T21:50:00.000Z	bipolar	histo	the weird thing is, ldap-auth-config is useless if you can't change nsswitch.conf with it.
