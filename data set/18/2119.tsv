2011-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	Zeu5		recently whenever i want to delete a file permanently in nautilus, my nautilus windows keep going into grey screen like they are hanged. why is that?
2011-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	Is it alot of files or a large file? Would the drive happen to be full?
2011-01-08T08:52:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	i just want to delete 1 file. right now my drive is only 52%
2011-01-08T08:52:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	Do you have any network shares attached in some way?
2011-01-08T08:52:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	( Doesn't normal deletes just move to trash? )
2011-01-08T08:53:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	yes normal delete move to trash. the grey screen hanging occurs when i do a SHIFT+DEL
2011-01-08T08:53:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	is this a large file by chance? Does your computer have an indicator to show hard drive activity?
2011-01-08T08:55:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	is the system monitor able to view the harddisk activity?
2011-01-08T08:56:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	Yes it should be able to... if your monitor supports one that check for disk I/O
2011-01-08T08:56:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	I was hoping you computer had a little light indicating drive activity.
2011-01-08T08:56:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	well so far it has never hit 100% when i permanently delete something.
2011-01-08T08:56:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	yes i think i have that
2011-01-08T08:57:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	so what should i do? should i try again?
2011-01-08T08:57:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	Honestly speaking.. I have no idea why shift+del would cause it to hang...
2011-01-08T08:57:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	i see.
2011-01-08T08:57:00.000Z	Zeu5	Diamondcite	thanks anyway
2011-01-08T08:57:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Zeu5	Can't you move that file alone to trash and empty to get rid of it?
