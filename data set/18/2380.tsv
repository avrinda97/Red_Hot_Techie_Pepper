2010-06-08T04:57:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf		How do I create a installfile in ubuntu like bin.tar.bz2?
2010-06-08T04:58:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	these are diffrent packaging-formats, a installfile would be a deb-file (for ubuntu)
2010-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	man tar (enter this in terminal)
2010-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf	DasEi	: so unless there isn't a deb-file no use in trying?
2010-06-08T05:00:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	you can install software in diffrent ways, deb is most commmon, or you compile it from source (advanced), from a tarball, see:
2010-06-08T05:01:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf	DasEi	: so I need to make like setup-file myself?
2010-06-08T05:02:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	I'm no geek ath this, you can either do a install-script, create a tarball or a deb-file, like in help of debbuilde
2010-06-08T05:03:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf	DasEi	: I was a windowz-user for like 16 years... but linux is more fun :)
2010-06-08T05:04:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	what do you want to set up ?
2010-06-08T05:05:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf	DasEi	: its a mod from Glest (a 3D strategic-game for linux)
2010-06-08T05:06:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	so steps will be to compile it from source succesful first and then make a deb from it, which automates the dependency-check and the install-routine
2010-06-08T05:07:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf	DasEi	it seems Im the non-geek ;)
2010-06-08T05:09:00.000Z	DasEi	cyborgsmurf	as said, I'm pressed by some other stuff in recent times, but for a startup do a compile froma known good app, then try to do the same for that game , then look into tools for building debs
2010-06-08T05:10:00.000Z	cyborgsmurf	DasEi	Im going to check this website out... (I wont be reading for a while, so pls dont type anything important)
