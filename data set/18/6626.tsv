2008-04-23T03:09:00.000Z	_20eric06_		http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_linux_and_windows_xp_linux_installed_first.htm I'm following this
2008-04-23T03:09:00.000Z	_20eric06_		I just want to know how to use Parted
2008-04-23T03:11:00.000Z	_20eric06_		There must be a GUI, but I don't know how to access it
2008-04-23T03:13:00.000Z	_20eric06_		Ubuntu has Parted, but not Gparted
2008-04-23T03:13:00.000Z	_20eric06_		But I'm afraid I didn't completly understand everything
2008-04-23T03:15:00.000Z	_20eric06_		Is there how to make a install CD/DVD from my current Ubuntu install and then reinstall it?
2008-04-23T03:15:00.000Z	_20eric06_		I have no files on this computer yet
2008-04-23T03:15:00.000Z	_20eric06_		Apart from Ubuntu
2008-04-23T03:15:00.000Z	_20eric06_		It's brand new, came with Ubuntu, and I have no CD for it
2008-04-23T03:17:00.000Z	ikonia	_20eric06_	not really very straight forward
2009-08-25T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	_20eric06_	disks are refernced by uuid in the boot arguments
2009-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	_20eric06_	why are you asking for DSL help in an Ubuntu support channel
2009-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	_20eric06_	ikonia	There is no other place to ask, I just need quick install help
2009-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	_20eric06_	sorry - not here
2009-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	_20eric06_	try the dSL channel
2009-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	_20eric06_	ikonia	Mind directing me to it? #knoppix is deal
2009-08-25T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	_20eric06_	I don't know the dsl channel, may #dsl ?
