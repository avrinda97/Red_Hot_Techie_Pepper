2009-12-07T09:14:00.000Z	Tiders		Why is #wine invite only
2009-12-07T09:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	you want #winehq
2009-12-21T10:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	no
2009-12-21T10:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	gnome is always gnome
2009-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	GDE doesn't exist
2009-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	Tiders	lstarnes	Ive heard it said often
2009-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	there is no such thing as GDE.  Gnome is always just "Gnome" or "GNOME"
2009-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	this is the first time I've heard it
2009-12-21T10:12:00.000Z	Tiders	lstarnes	Ah.. Maybe just all the people I talk to use it as slang or something
2009-12-21T10:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	GDM just handles logging in, starting the rest of Gnome or another desktop environment, and restarting X when it shuts off
2009-12-21T10:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	KDM does the same thing, but it is part of KDE, not Gnome
2009-12-21T10:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	it can be a bit tricky though
2010-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	it is insecurem unrecommended, and unnecessary
2010-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	Tiders	lstarnes	But most distributions have a root user
2010-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	ubuntu doesn't
2010-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	for good reasons
2010-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	Tiders	lstarnes	Like?
2010-01-05T06:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tiders	security for one
