2006-11-01T10:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	uninstall the module with apt and then install it using the up to date nvidia installer
2006-11-01T10:37:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	That's what I did...
2006-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	*poke*
2006-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	I never had it installed with apt.
2006-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	so what are yo trying to do now?
2006-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	I already told you my problem. -_-
2006-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	X complains that the kernel module is older than the X module, which it is. How can I update the kernel module?
2006-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	i have the same driver instaled here (with a custom kernel though) and see no complaints from X... the nvidia instaler should have replaced both
2006-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	X launches without complaints when I first install it, but after reboot it has this problem
2006-11-01T10:45:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	It even compiles the kernel module itself... I don't understand why it doesn't stick.
2006-11-01T10:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	the only problem i encounterd was that i had to move the config file from $HOME to /etc/X11/ manually
2006-11-01T10:45:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	That might do it.
2006-11-01T10:46:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	Which config file?
2006-11-01T10:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	xorg.conf
2006-11-01T10:47:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	That's nutty. My Xorg.conf is configured to use the nvidia module, and as long as yours was it should have worked. Copying it makes no sense. -.o
2006-11-01T10:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	for some reason i do not understand the nvidia instaler does not update the xorg.conf (it creates one in your home) and when you reboot the machine bang!!
2006-11-01T10:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Drac|School	mine was configured to my old radeon card and the instaler did not update it properly as i said
2006-11-01T10:49:00.000Z	Drac|School	erUSUL	Ah. I never told it to update my Xorg.conf. I figured changing the driver to "nvidia" manually was enough. I just reinstalled and let it do its thing. I'll reboot now.
