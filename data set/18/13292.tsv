2005-12-28T14:39:00.000Z	DUNFreak		minus the brushed metal
2005-12-28T14:41:00.000Z	DUNFreak		Treve de plaisanteries, I need a bit of help. Whenever I'm mounting my FAT32 drives under ubuntu, they are always read-only to anyone other than root, and it's annoying the heck out of me. How do I make them read/write to the root group (my normal users are grouped to root)
2005-12-28T14:43:00.000Z	DUNFreak		I'd much prefer a ubuntu guide or something on the web :P
2005-12-28T14:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 use the umask, optiopns and perhaps the 'uid' and 'gid' options in the fstab.
2005-12-28T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 proberly covered in details in the wiki/forums also. :P but there may be a lot of hits/info/fluff
2005-12-28T14:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 :P ive hacked eniough to know how to do it - lol.
2005-12-28T14:49:00.000Z	DUNFreak	Dr_Willis	just pointing it out, it's easier for a noob to read that just pointing to the winmac_fstab file ;)
2005-12-28T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 i think the bot should msg all peoole to check the wiki/forums first..  befor even asking a Question. :P but thats mean.
2005-12-28T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 also it pays to learn what you are doing - and not rely on a script .
2005-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	DUNFreak	Dr_Willis	true. But i'm a poor MS slave that's used to DOS and Windows. Asking me to understand fstab is quite a learning curve.
2005-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 throw off the chains of MS-Lemming-ZOmbie-hoood! and be free!
2005-12-28T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 it pays to learn the fundamentals of linux. then the rest is easy
2005-12-28T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 then ya spend time figureing out what the disrto-makers did to make things 'idiot-friendly' thats then broke. :P
2005-12-28T14:53:00.000Z	DUNFreak	Dr_Willis	do you have any idea why the "Disks Manager" just won't save the access path? everytime I change it to what I want (/media/data instead of /media/0\040GB\040Disk\040(hda5)) , it just doesn't save anything.
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 Hmm.. not sure.. i tend to disable all auto-mounting and mount them where i want. and be done with it.
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 also dont use spaces in the filenames/paths if ay can help it. Lol.
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	DUNFreak	Dr_Willis	that's Ubuntu's fault. :P
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DUNFreak	 i think its somthing to do with their automounter and the names from devfs not sure. :P i bypassed it.
