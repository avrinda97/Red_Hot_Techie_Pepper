2012-04-20T11:08:00.000Z	ojii		how can I connect to a Mac VNC server? all the clients I found in the repositories fail...
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	fidel	ojii	sure you enabled vnc support inside the remote-desktop settings of your osx host?
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	fidel		otherwise it will fail for sure - always ;)
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	yes, other mac users can connect
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	from ubuntu: no luck
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	fidel	ojii	macs dont use vnc itself
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	o.O?
2012-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	fidel		there is a special option for vnc support inside the remote desktop settings
2012-04-20T11:10:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	most clients say they fail because of authentication method not being supported
2012-04-20T11:11:00.000Z	fidel	ojii	have you checkeD: VNC viewer may control screen with password ?
2012-04-20T11:11:00.000Z	fidel		otherwise it will not work
2012-04-20T11:11:00.000Z	fidel		thats a setting on your mac
2012-04-20T11:11:00.000Z	fidel		i stop repeating myself now ;)
2012-04-20T11:11:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	okay
2012-04-20T11:12:00.000Z	fidel	ojii	sys-prefs - sharing -remote management - computer settings
2012-04-20T11:13:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	a mac user claims it's enabled
2012-04-20T11:15:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	ah, gtkvncviewer actually can connect!
2012-04-20T11:15:00.000Z	ojii	fidel	but it only shows part of the screen. the mac has 4 displays attached, i can only see one
