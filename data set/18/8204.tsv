2007-10-19T02:40:00.000Z	mjkelly93		anyone in here really familiar with alsa and usb sound cards? maybe anyone with experience rebuilding alsa?
2007-10-19T02:41:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	instaructiosn to build alsa from source for all supported cards  are on the alsa website
2007-10-19T02:43:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	what usb sound device is it?
2007-10-19T02:44:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main <<<looks like now unless it's a rebadged job
2007-10-19T02:47:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	recompiling alsa is not recommended in ubuntu ever or for the faint hearted...much easier to buy a compatible sound card
2007-10-19T02:49:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	alsaconf is in one of the alsa packages....alsa-utils or alsa-tools I think. But that is still manual compiling...shoudl work though
2007-10-19T02:50:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	good luck...you could always try open source sound....could be a solution
2007-10-19T02:52:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	http://manuals.opensound.com/devlists/Linux.html << doesn't look good for OSS either
2007-10-19T02:54:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	yeah, still no findy
2007-10-19T02:55:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	alsa-lib looks promising
2007-10-19T02:57:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	ahhh, makes sense. You'll be stuck compiling it from source then. Still not too bad
2007-10-19T02:59:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	let the forum know how it goes - you may become a legend in the field of ubuntu usb sound
2007-10-19T03:03:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	doubt it, ubuntu is usually a few revisons back
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	thanks for the update. Pretty much down to buying a new card then :-(
2007-10-19T03:51:00.000Z	murkyMurk	mjkelly93	pretty dead channel....www.linuxquestions.org is a good bet though, full of happy experts
