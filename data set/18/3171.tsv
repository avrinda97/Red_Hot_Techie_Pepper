2010-03-09T18:23:00.000Z	Brandano		is there a way to allow a standard user to execute pppd?
2010-03-09T18:24:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	yes, create a group and chmod pppd to 755 and then add the user to the group. Then make the group the owner of the file. Or add the user to the file's current group.
2010-03-09T18:25:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	the trouble with that is that if pppd is ever updated I will be back to square one
2010-03-09T18:27:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	I did add wvdial to the sudoers file for a dialup group. I tried to do the same for /usr/sbin/pppd... but doesn't appear to exist for non root users
2010-03-09T18:28:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	you don't want them in sudoers!
2010-03-09T18:28:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	why not?
2010-03-09T18:29:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	if someone could switch to that user, then they could do *anything* to your system.
2010-03-09T18:30:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	no, not in that way. If someone belongs o that group, hen it could run that file as root
2010-03-09T18:31:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	pbureau if you add the user to sudoers or the group, unless you lock it to the specific binary, you're opening yourself up for a world of pain.
2010-03-09T18:48:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	if you can bear with me for a second, this is what I am attempting to do with sudoers: %dialout localhost = /usr/bin/wvdial, /usr/sbin/pppd
2010-03-09T18:49:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	I don't use pppd. I just wouldn't do it how you are. Unsafe.
2010-03-09T18:50:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	I don't see how you'd go about escalating privileges. I mean more than what you are allowed already if you are a member of the group
2010-03-09T18:51:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	it's not that you're doin it wrong.
2010-03-09T19:10:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	apparently my trouble is caused by the fact that the standard user is not a member of the "dip" group.  Indeed, no user is, and there's already a couple of bug reports about it in launchpad
2010-03-09T19:12:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	that way, no root permissions are needed.
2010-03-09T19:20:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	encasing in concrete works too
2010-03-09T19:20:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Brandano	that's only for systems you don't want to deal with again.
2010-03-09T19:21:00.000Z	Brandano	SpaceGhostC2C	Or for thos systems that didn't get the hint until it was to late. :)
