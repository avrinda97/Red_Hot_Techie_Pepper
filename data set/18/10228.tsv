2007-01-10T06:46:00.000Z	Ferret	cntb	Nah, but you get the idea... go to http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=downloadand scroll down to the continents list and click around until you find one that has the dvd versions
2007-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	Ferret	cntb	The only one I know is the official one then, http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/release/ -- http and torrent downloads
