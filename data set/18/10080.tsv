2011-09-08T23:42:00.000Z	nathanel		hello guys! need help on making a symlink for two different targets in two different directories...
2011-09-08T23:43:00.000Z	nathanel		making a single link for ibus-anthy.png that directs to both faenza and faenza-dark
2011-09-08T23:44:00.000Z	nathanel		i need simultaneous targets.. is that even possible?
2011-09-08T23:45:00.000Z	nathanel		have the proper embedded link to each theme on theme change for the ibus-anthy indicator
2011-09-08T23:46:00.000Z	nathanel		ok
2011-09-08T23:48:00.000Z	nathanel		ibus-anthy has its indicator icon located in /usr/share/ibus/anthy/icons/ibus/anthy.png, since there can only be one ibus-anthy.png, i am trying to link multiple status icons to that same file ( fanza/status/ and faenza-dark/status)
2011-09-08T23:50:00.000Z	nathanel		i would like anthy to use the faenza status icons for ibus-kbd status when activated or deactivated and keep theme consistency (its a fix)
2011-09-08T23:50:00.000Z	nathanel		no.. a faenza icon theme symlink question
2011-09-08T23:51:00.000Z	nathanel		and an ubuntu one also since i do not know how to symlink multiple file to a same target or single target to multiple files... would that be a 3-way link?
2011-09-08T23:52:00.000Z	nathanel		ok
2011-09-08T23:52:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	I'm confused. Are you trying to point 2 symlinks at the same file? or point 1 symlink to two files?
2011-09-08T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	A symlink is like a shortcut.  You can't point it to two files simultaenously.
2011-09-08T23:56:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	what does the application currently point to when it comes to icon files?
2011-09-08T23:57:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	forget my question, jrib asked it better.
2011-09-08T23:58:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	there are ways to specify within an icon theme if you'd like to prefer an icon over another... let me see if I can find the theme I modified...
2011-09-09T00:05:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	Hmm.. Looks like ibus-anthy doesn't ship icons in the right place.  I don't think index.theme can manage icons that aren't in /usr/share/icons/
2011-09-09T00:16:00.000Z	nathanel	Pici	no?
2011-09-09T00:16:00.000Z	Pici	nathanel	There is no such thing as a symlink that points to more than one file, or any else like that.
