2007-08-02T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Cod1	evolution has several different plugins.... i'd recommend removing it via synaptic... Open synaptic, search for evolution, and mark it for "complete removal", and that should do it.
2007-08-02T08:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Cod1	make, compile it.
2007-08-02T08:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Cod1	hang on a sec and i'll talk you through it, its pretty easy
