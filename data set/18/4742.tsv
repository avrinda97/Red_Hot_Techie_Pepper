2009-02-18T10:41:00.000Z	Dracie	Sw3RvE	Sorry I meant to just show you that way of managing packages - its more advanced than add/remove

2009-02-18T10:44:00.000Z	Dracie	Sw3RvE	wifi radar?
2009-02-18T10:44:00.000Z	Dracie	Sw3RvE	not sure probably in the Applicatoins menu
2009-02-18T10:46:00.000Z	Dracie	Sw3RvE	might be in System -> Admin
2009-02-18T10:50:00.000Z	Dracie	Sw3RvE	it'll be somewhere in the menu
