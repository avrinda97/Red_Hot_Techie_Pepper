2007-02-17T12:10:00.000Z	slippyr4		is there a gtk-version of sudo ?
2007-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	gksu or gksudo
2007-02-17T12:50:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	: non booting system :(
2007-02-17T12:51:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	recovery mode?
2007-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	vncviewer in terminal?
2007-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	i thought there was a snazzier one though that allowed you to set options and stuff
2007-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	for linux? hrm i dont know
2007-03-13T11:14:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	or remote desktop client, or soemthing like that
2007-03-13T11:14:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	depends if you use rdc or vnc protocol..
2007-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	well, the server is an ubuntu machine's logged in user's desktop
2007-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	probably vnc if youre using general desktop sharing
2007-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	rdc v4/v5 is xp/vista respectively
2007-03-13T11:16:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	ok. i just found gnome-rdp in synaptic. might this be what i want?
2007-03-13T11:16:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	youd need an rdp server for ubuntu, thats an rdp client
2007-03-13T11:16:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	you have a vnc server (gnome desktop sharing) on the linux pc unless you setup an rdp
2007-03-13T11:22:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	i installed the remote desktop client, and it worked (whereas running vncviewer from the shell didn't). i just entered the hostname and selected vnc for the protocol. thanks!
2007-03-13T11:24:00.000Z	xtknight	slippyr4	hrm so RDC works for vnc?  never knew.  thanks for the report though.  rdc client gives you extra options?
2007-03-13T11:25:00.000Z	slippyr4	xtknight	no, it wasnt using rdc - i picked protocol as vnc. but it seems that the remote desktop client works (as vnc) whereas the plain ole vncviewer doesn't
