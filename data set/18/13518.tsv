2005-12-06T14:54:00.000Z	ahoora		is it necessary to install an antivirus?
2005-12-06T14:54:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	you might put one, but it's not necessary
2005-12-06T14:55:00.000Z	ahoora	raphink	windows without antivirus and firewall has no meaning .. linux is not like that is it? i think there is not many viruses or attacks for linux?
2005-12-06T14:56:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	I think about 10 viruses known in total in the whole linux history, most of them not dangerous.
2005-12-06T14:56:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	settings a firewall and controlling your pots is always a good thing, but having an antivirus under linux is more of a matter of protecting your windows mates
2005-12-06T14:56:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	you do not need an antivirus to protect your own linux box
2005-12-06T14:57:00.000Z	ahoora	raphink	i am afraid i loose my internal network if i install a firewall ... i am not familiar with them
2005-12-06T14:57:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	then don't ;) and that's ok
2005-12-06T14:58:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	adopt a good passwd policy, don't open weak server
2005-12-06T14:59:00.000Z	ahoora	raphink	if i want to install a firewall what do you recommend?
2005-12-06T14:59:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	I recomment getting a router dedicated to it ;)
2005-12-06T15:04:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	no
2005-12-06T15:05:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	never used a linux book ;)
2005-12-06T15:06:00.000Z	ahoora	raphink	so how did you learn linux ? lol
2005-12-06T15:06:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	by practicing, and with the help of others
2005-12-06T15:06:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	you can learn a lot from tutorials on the internet
2005-12-06T15:08:00.000Z	raphink	ahoora	linux is not more difficult at all
2005-12-06T15:09:00.000Z	ahoora	raphink	but it seems like an ocean
