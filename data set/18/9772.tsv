2007-05-09T05:16:00.000Z	comradec		does anyone know why when I try to use xscreensaver it doesn't force off the laptop monitor, even though I have dpms true in my xconfig and power managment support in xscreensaver
2007-05-09T05:18:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	i've been fighting with that problem for months
2007-05-09T05:19:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	it's dumb as hell
2007-05-09T05:19:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	dpms is screwed on ubuntu, as it seems
2007-05-09T05:19:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	gnome screensaver works when just in gnome correctly, but I like fluxbox, and gnomescreensaver don't work right with vlc in it
2007-05-09T05:20:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	same for me, i prefer fluxbox too ... the only way i can get my screen to turn off is as root
2007-05-09T05:21:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	to force the screen off as root 'vbetool dpms off' works for me
2007-05-09T05:22:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	I can turn it off manually, but I like to watch movies and such, having my screen turn automatically off insead of just blanking when vlc is done; so far I've not been able to get that to work right outside of gnome using xscreensaver
2007-05-09T05:23:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	it's confusing cause there are multiple ways to configure power/screen management
2007-05-09T05:24:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	it can be in xscreensaver, xorg.conf, xseting it
2007-05-09T05:24:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	it's not worth getting into because it's obviously a mess ... have you tried vbetool yet? that talks directly to the bios
2007-05-09T05:26:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	do you just run that in xstartup each time?
2007-05-09T05:26:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	ah u need to be root, lame
2007-05-09T05:26:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	yeah if i really want to turn it off
2007-05-09T05:28:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	doing it as root is the only way, trust me :-/
2007-05-09T05:28:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	nah try xset dpms force off
2007-05-09T05:29:00.000Z	kmarius	comradec	that won't work for me, either ... the backlight (and eventually the display) keeps switching back on again
2007-05-09T05:29:00.000Z	comradec	kmarius	beat :/
