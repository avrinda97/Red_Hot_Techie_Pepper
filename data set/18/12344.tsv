2007-02-13T16:01:00.000Z	albe84tr		...
2007-02-13T16:01:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	let me do lastlog on you first
2007-02-13T16:02:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	you mean your FF occasionally crashes?
2007-02-13T16:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	yes, but you never answered my question on your problem
2007-02-13T16:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	so I thought you no longer want any help
2007-02-13T16:12:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	Anything about in ~/.xsession-errors ?
2007-02-13T16:12:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	did you check .xsession-errors at least?
2007-02-13T16:13:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	in all browsers you say? Which ones have you tried?
2007-02-13T16:14:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	are you on dapper or edgy?
2007-02-13T16:15:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	Do you have ubuntu 6.06 or 6.10?
2007-02-13T16:16:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	then I recommend upgrading, 5.10 is not supported very long anymore (just couple of months)
2007-02-13T16:17:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	:?
2007-02-13T16:33:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	Work took my attention for the bit
2007-02-13T16:34:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	you could of course try to tell the browser never to ask that and see if it happens still.
2007-02-13T16:38:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	And is this how you are upgrading: http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=14 ?
2007-02-13T16:42:00.000Z	Lynoure	albe84tr	I'll need to go, but the next person will probably want to see the errors and your sources.list in pastebin
