2007-10-19T16:15:00.000Z	Cryoniq		I popped in the radeon driver for my ati radeon 9800 pro under gutsy. Problem is that my screen update is lagging a bit now. ok.. quite much. When for example this irc chat fills with text screen is update form above like a wave all the time. In feisty, the radeon driver worked good. Anyone have any leads what could be wrong or help me with some troubleshoot process? :)
2007-10-19T16:16:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	are you using the xgl xserver ?
2007-10-19T16:17:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	good question. How do I verify I am? I know I downloaded something with that from repository yesterday.
2007-10-19T16:19:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	is xserver-xgl installed?
2007-10-19T16:21:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	verified, it is.
2007-10-19T16:25:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	xserver-xgl was installed. I maybe should put my xorg.conf into pastebin, just a feeling I have there is something not in order in it.
2007-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	sure do that. otherwise i think xserver-xgl is use with ati and kde to get compiz-fusion working, not sure though
2007-10-19T16:28:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	I am using Gnome though :)
2007-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	so pastebin the xorg.conf should you wish as well as the /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	xorg.conf (the ## in it are things commented out from working feisty conf. I disabled one at the time to see earlier if something got better or worse. No changes in performance though from that): http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41185/
2007-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	And the xorg log: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41186/
2007-10-19T16:38:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	ok looking now
2007-10-19T16:38:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	thanks for taking the time :)
2007-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	ok so basically things were just slow? perhaps you could get rid of xserver-xgl using the non gl xserver instead
2007-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	Cryoniq	and i thought AIGLX was only needed for ati + kde
2007-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	very slow, if I move a window it will be "roll" and take 1-2 secs to move across the screen etc. And there are borders left behind and not removed from screen partially at times.
2007-10-19T16:46:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	I was running Beryl in feisty with aiglx and dri. Worked like a charm. I thought there would be no problem in gusty and gnome to run just as fine and be able to start compiz just as smooth.. :)
2007-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	Cryoniq	WaltzingAlong	might add this is a clean install of Gutsy, and I had a backup of feisty and took the xorg.conf after I tried installing fglrx, but then I had major problems with pieces of windows and text scrolling would be garbeled strangely etc.
