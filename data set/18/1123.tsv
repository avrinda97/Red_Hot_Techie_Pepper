2011-06-23T13:00:00.000Z	rockguy32		Am I stuck with this version or is there a way to update to version 11? I am aware that the Netbook remix was merged into the normal version as of version 11, but I can't seem to find a way to switch over.
2011-06-23T13:01:00.000Z	rockguy32		I am running Ubuntu Netbook Remix version 10.04.2 LTS.
2011-06-23T13:02:00.000Z	rockguy32		I changed the update manager to include normal updates, but it still doesn't show version 11's update.
2011-06-23T13:03:00.000Z	rockguy32		So there's no way to update without a fresh install?
2011-06-23T13:05:00.000Z	rockguy32		I will actually have more problems because getting this to work in the first place was a pain, mostly because of this computer's lack of any kind of disk drive.
2011-06-23T13:05:00.000Z	rockguy32		On the hard drive?
2011-06-23T13:06:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	rockguy32	fresh install only takes less than an hour
2011-06-23T13:10:00.000Z	rockguy32	scriptwarlock	For me it took about 4 hours after all the work it takes to get it to work with this blasted laptop. For some reason it just hates trying to boot from anything that isn't a hard drive.
2011-06-23T13:14:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	rockguy32	what about ubuntu-desktop thru terminal have you tried that method?
2011-06-23T13:15:00.000Z	rockguy32	scriptwarlock	I'm not sure what you mean.
2011-06-23T13:15:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	rockguy32	sorry, apt-get install ubuntu-dekstop
2011-06-23T13:17:00.000Z	rockguy32	scriptwarlock	It came back "install: missing destination file operand after `ubuntu-dekstop'
2011-06-23T13:17:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	rockguy32	isn't that desktop instead of dekstop
2011-06-23T13:18:00.000Z	rockguy32	scriptwarlock	I used copy/paste so the blame isn't on me then.
2011-06-23T13:18:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	rockguy32	typo sorry
2011-06-23T13:20:00.000Z	rockguy32	scriptwarlock	NP. It seems to be working.\
2011-06-23T13:22:00.000Z	rockguy32	scriptwarlock	Ok that did the trick! Thank you.
2011-06-23T13:23:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	rockguy32	k no problem
