2006-03-28T16:23:00.000Z	Hagbard23		I have a problem with the installation of eclipse: aptitude always gives errors when installing e.g. ecj-bootstrap-gcj and quits. I can't install or uninstall those packages. The error is: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: eclipse-platform.db. Can someone help me?
2006-03-28T16:25:00.000Z	Hagbard23		Is there a possibility to forcely remove a package?
2006-03-28T16:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	did you install java?
2006-03-28T16:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	did you run sudo update-altermatives --config java?
2006-03-28T16:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	run that than pick the newest java it lists
2006-03-28T16:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	im assuming you installed the eclipse-platform or whatever the name is
2006-03-28T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	if you did please run sudo apt-get -f install
2006-03-28T16:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	you might also need to change the environmental values for java (not usre how on linux i only remember window and thats even a stretch
2006-03-28T16:36:00.000Z	Hagbard23	gnomefreak	apt-get -f didn't help. Same error. Problem is, that I can't install or update any packages, because of this errors. He always trys to fix it and then he quits.
2006-03-28T16:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	sudo apt-get -f install is to fix broken packages
2006-03-28T16:37:00.000Z	Hagbard23	gnomefreak	Yes, I know. But it doesn't work
2006-03-28T16:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	is this on dapper or breezy?
2006-03-28T16:38:00.000Z	Hagbard23	gnomefreak	I would be happy if I just could remove those packages...
2006-03-28T16:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	im thinking thats a envionmental varible issue (its been so long)
2006-03-28T16:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	im not sure why you cant remeove it
2006-03-28T16:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Hagbard23	what type of error do you get when trying to remove it?
2006-03-28T16:40:00.000Z	Hagbard23	gnomefreak	Same error in the post-removal script
2006-03-28T17:32:00.000Z	Hagbard23	gnomefreak	I have done it. My libgcj was broken. I downloaded the package and installed it with dpkg and now it works. Thanks.
