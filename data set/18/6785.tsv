2011-04-01T08:43:00.000Z	anlek		Any reason why my cron isn't running daily? (or at least not that my script is running daily)
2011-04-01T08:44:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	is your script in /etc/cron.daily ?
2011-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	Yes, and it's got +x and belongs to root
2011-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	I can run it directly via root and it works, but doesn't seem to run via cron.daily
2011-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	redirect the output of the script to a log in /tmp
2011-04-01T08:46:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	via > ?
2011-04-01T08:46:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	But how can I do that via cron.daily?
2011-04-01T08:47:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	you might have to do a crontab, i got mixed up. I'm not sure why it wouldn't run, though
2011-04-01T08:48:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	Ok, I'll give it a try... one more question...(one sec)
2011-04-01T08:48:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	my crontab file says: 25 6 * * * root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily ) however, /user/sbin doesn't have anacron... any idea why or if this works?
2011-04-01T08:49:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	if there's no anacron, install it. that could be your issue
2011-04-01T08:51:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	so that should fix it? Any idea why that was in my crontab?
2011-04-01T08:52:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	awesome, looks like it works! thank you so much for your time.
2011-04-01T08:54:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	it just tells bash to execute all the scripts in cron.daily
2011-04-01T08:54:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	But it's not installed by default?
2011-04-01T08:56:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	i guess not. your average ubuntu user isnt using cron.daily, so i suppose it shaves a few kb to leave anacron out
2011-04-01T08:56:00.000Z	anlek	randomuser	well once again, thank you for your time (and teaching me a thing or two)
2011-04-01T08:58:00.000Z	randomuser	anlek	no problem, i dont know much but its nice to share.
