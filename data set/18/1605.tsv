2011-07-12T20:08:00.000Z	monsterwizard		How can I uninstall evolution?
2011-07-12T20:09:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	sudo apt-get remove evolution
2011-07-12T20:10:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	or go to software center, and search for evolution, then say remove
2011-07-12T20:10:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	what do you mean "it says there"? its already removed?
2011-07-12T20:11:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	strange. did you try opening it after?
2011-07-12T20:17:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	try "sudo apt-get remove evolution-common
2011-07-12T20:18:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	for evolution that is :P
2011-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	try "sudo apt-get remove evolution-common"
2011-07-12T20:23:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	np. does it run anymore?
2011-07-12T20:27:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	maybe elementary os's postler?
2011-07-12T20:27:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	but I think it's still in beta or something.
2011-07-12T20:28:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	nevermind, it's stable. here's the link: https://launchpad.net/~postler-dev/+archive/ppa
2011-07-12T20:29:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	i haven't tried it, so can't help you with config :/ I guess time to try?
2011-07-12T20:30:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	what happened? also, if you need help installing ppa's, just ask :)
2011-07-12T20:31:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	so much for elementary, eh?
2011-12-21T05:01:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	worked flawlessly for me... 3-4 times...
2011-12-21T05:02:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	monsterwizard	redownload both the wubi installer and image maybe?
