2005-12-11T12:58:00.000Z	Determinist		this channel is flying too fast before my eyes today :/
2005-12-11T12:59:00.000Z	Determinist		or... i may be tired.
2005-12-11T13:00:00.000Z	Determinist		s/disability/inability
2005-12-11T13:00:00.000Z	Determinist		yes, i'll agree
2005-12-11T13:01:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	Lord_Maynoth: if after all those years, Linux was nothing more than a Windows replacement, I wouldn't be here.
2005-12-11T13:02:00.000Z	Determinist	soundray	i'm not suggesting that it is. i'm merely saying that to address a larger crowd, it has to achieve certain things windows has in the past, not that it is to be compared with it.
2005-12-11T13:04:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	for Linux it would be better to grow the community of tech-savvy users that find it attractive. Competing for a mass audience will only dumb it down.
2005-12-11T13:05:00.000Z	Determinist	soundray	that... is the big debate then, isnt it? for linux to be what it can be it needs better cooperation from hardware makers and other players in the market, without it turning even slighty mainstream, that just wont happen.
2005-12-11T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	if Linux turns mainstream to get hardware vendors on board, what we'll get is more of the kind of mess we have with ati and nvidia right now.
2005-12-11T13:09:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	if hw vendors only realized how little they have to lose from opening up their specs, we'd have an easier life with hardware support.
2005-12-13T16:04:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	if you don't believe that ext2 and ext3 avoid fragmentation, just read the source.
2005-12-13T16:08:00.000Z	Determinist	soundray	when was the last time you read "the source" of anything just to be sure of it's features?
2005-12-13T16:08:00.000Z	Determinist	soundray	not trying to be annoying here, just wondering
2005-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	you were supposing that there must be fragmentation in ext2. There isn't. Final proof is in the source. ext2 avoids fragmentation by design.
2006-01-18T06:22:00.000Z	Determinist	soundray	thanks, and yeah, just found it at /var/log/dpkg.log
2006-01-18T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	'apt-cache depends packagename'
2006-01-18T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	there is an install log somewhere, too...
2006-01-18T06:22:00.000Z	soundray	Determinist	check out the dir /var/log/installer/
