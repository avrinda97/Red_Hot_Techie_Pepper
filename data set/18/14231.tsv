2005-10-18T12:30:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 How many instances of network-admin are running (both defunct and alive)?
2005-10-18T12:31:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	: not sure but... The first time I try it it locks up, then I have to force quit it....then if I try opening network admin again, I see "opening network admin" thing in the toolbar and then after a few seconds it just disapears
2005-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	Then after that, if i try opening OpenOffice 2 it does the same thing...
2005-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 Do a, "ps -A | grep network-admin" to see if any are still hanging around.
2005-10-18T12:34:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 Did any instances show up?
2005-10-18T12:35:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	im in windows right now...i cant set up my internet connection on linux because the network config keeps freezing
2005-10-18T12:35:00.000Z	zeus1_		ill chek in just a sec
2005-10-18T12:38:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 Is the Linux box on a separate machine?
2005-10-18T12:38:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	No its on the same system but on a different hard drive
2005-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	brb gonna go test that command
2005-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 wait.
2005-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	zeus1_		k
2005-10-18T12:40:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 Once you do a fresh boot up, that command will not return anything since you won't have launched it.  It's merely a way to see if any defunct network-admin processes are still hanging around after the fact.
2005-10-18T12:42:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	so what if some defunct network admin processes are there what do I do
2005-10-18T12:42:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 Helping you troubleshoot this issue will be very time consuming if you have to keep booting back and forth.  Any other PCs with Internet access?
2005-10-18T12:42:00.000Z	zeus1_	rob_p	yes but there in use h/o ill see if I can get a hold of teh lap top
2005-10-18T12:42:00.000Z	rob_p	zeus1_	 Well, you'd want to kill them and then try and figure out why it's having trouble running in the first place.
