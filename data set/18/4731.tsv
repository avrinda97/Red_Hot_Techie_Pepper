2009-02-21T03:12:00.000Z	monkey2		I just installed 8.10 server, but I don't boot into ubuntu, intead I get dropped into a grub shell, hitting escape doesn't work either to get to a boot menu. I am not sure what is going on, any ideas? Thanks in advance!
2009-02-21T03:13:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	try typing find /boot/vmlinuz
2009-02-21T03:16:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	hmm file not found
2009-02-21T03:16:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	you installed GRUB to the MBR?
2009-02-21T03:17:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	do you think I forgot to set the bootflag on the /boot partition ?
2009-02-21T03:17:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	that would do it :)
2009-02-21T03:17:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	would that result in this problem
2009-02-21T03:18:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	boot with the live CD and fix it with gparted
2009-02-21T03:18:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	I should be able to boot into a live cd and fix it right
2009-02-21T03:18:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	ah, cool thanks
2009-02-21T03:18:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	I though it did do that, but oh well, i'll check and get back to you, thanks.
2009-02-21T03:19:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	read the URL's I posted to you
2009-02-21T03:19:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	ok
2009-02-21T03:34:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	ok, another important thing I should've mentioned earlier. I did a raid 5 setup in ubuntu (/boot partition is not on the raid array), is there anything I have to do to enable raid before when booting? In 8.04 I didn't have to do anything special, don't know if that's changed for 8.10. What are your thoughts?
2009-02-21T03:35:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	I've never set up RAID
2009-02-21T03:48:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	sure -- glad you got it sorted out
2009-02-21T03:46:00.000Z	monkey2	mrwes	hey, the URLs you sent me helped, thanks! i had to find where /grub/stage1 was and then I setup (hdX) to setup grub on that partition. Thanks.
2009-02-21T03:49:00.000Z	mrwes	monkey2	sure -- glad you got it sorted out
