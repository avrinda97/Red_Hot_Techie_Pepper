2010-08-26T01:52:00.000Z	adac		Does there exist a tool that enables me access to remote pc's command line vie web browser?
2010-08-26T01:53:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	are you trying to get around blocked ports?
2010-08-26T01:54:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	nope. Something is wrong with my server. On every restart ssh seems to be broken. So until i find yout what is wrong i need such a web terminal
2010-08-26T01:55:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	define "broken"
2010-08-26T01:55:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	when i find out what is wrong i can define it :)
2010-08-26T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	well, what's the behavior you see?
2010-08-26T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	is the server behind a router, and if so, is port 22 forwarded? does your ISP allow connections to low ports like 22?
2010-08-26T01:57:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	yes thats all fine. Last time i did restart sshd again and then it worked again
2010-08-26T01:57:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	oh wow. Now i can access again...but on port 22
2010-08-26T01:58:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	damn this is strange i did add port 2222
2010-08-26T01:58:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	port 22 is the standard ssh port
2010-08-26T01:59:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	strange in sshd_config there is set Port 2222....
2010-08-26T02:01:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	so i suppose something is wrong with this file. Last time there was a unrecoginzed char in it which seemed to cause trouble.
2010-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	"sudo invoke-rc.d openssh-server" and check for erros in cosole output and logs
2010-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	"sudo invoke-rc.d openssh-server restart"
2010-08-26T02:04:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	invoke-rc.d: unknown initscript, /etc/init.d/openssh-server not found.
2010-08-26T02:04:00.000Z	mneptok	adac	how did you instal sshd?
2010-08-26T02:06:00.000Z	adac	mneptok	psilo2 this error above vomes when trying: sudo invoke-rc.d ssh restart
