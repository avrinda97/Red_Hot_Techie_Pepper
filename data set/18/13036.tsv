2006-01-21T13:05:00.000Z	Menga		i am a noob and i have goot a little problem with usb pen; they are not mounting automagically any more. know if there's an option that will let me to re-enable automagic mount?
2006-01-21T13:05:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 if you just upgraded hal, you may need to log out and log back into gnome, or reboot.
2006-01-21T13:06:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 do you have a lightbulb icon in your system tray anywhere?
2006-01-21T13:07:00.000Z	Menga	bluefoxicy	nope :(
2006-01-21T13:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 did you recently install packages?
2006-01-21T13:07:00.000Z	Menga	bluefoxicy	i can try to apt-get --reinstall install hal and reboot
2006-01-21T13:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 also does the drive show in places->computer ?
2006-01-21T13:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 it may just not be auto-openning
2006-01-21T13:08:00.000Z	Menga	bluefoxicy	there are many usb devices there, but none of them seems mounted
2006-01-21T13:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 click on one?
2006-01-21T13:09:00.000Z	Menga	bluefoxicy	maybe i miss some kernel thing, as i see no /dev thing in dmesg
2006-01-21T13:09:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 huh.  Did you upgrade anything recently?
2006-01-21T13:09:00.000Z	Menga	bluefoxicy	didnt intall any new packages, but a friend of mine tried to install new kernel and failed
2006-01-21T13:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 it likely removed the modules for your current kernel.  apt-get install linux-686 if you're on an IA-32 arch
2006-01-21T13:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 then use update-grub (unless you run lilo, then update-lilo) and reboot
2006-01-21T13:11:00.000Z	Menga	bluefoxicy	roger that. brb sooon. thanks a bunch
2006-01-21T13:11:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Menga	 I suggest not letting your friends mess with packages on your system.  :)
