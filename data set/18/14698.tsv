2005-06-27T12:54:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	select the package, choose "force version" from the menu
2005-06-27T12:54:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	the "package" menu in the menubar that is
2005-06-27T13:10:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	oh, e17 might still be uninstallable, broken, or break other things, whatever
2005-06-27T14:46:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	what windows? what is a virus? :)
2005-06-27T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	oh, the other stuff is not linux-specific
2005-06-27T14:53:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	the one situation when you want to run a virus scanner is if you run a mail server for windows clients
2005-06-27T14:54:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	even, then i'd count the clients and think if it's easier to let the clients worry about viruses :)
2005-06-27T15:11:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	do you mean the backround, which is normally white?
2005-06-27T15:13:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	find a theme that uses different colors
2005-06-27T15:27:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	yes
2005-06-27T06:59:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	for gnome, http://gnome-look.org and http://art.gnome.org
2005-06-27T07:00:00.000Z	ThE__OnE	topyli	so i can get any theme as long as its for gnome?
2005-06-27T07:01:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	yeah
2005-06-27T07:06:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	"the naked lunch"
2005-06-27T07:08:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	oh, i'm referring to your "moving wallpaper" thing :)
2005-06-27T07:09:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	no. it's just i haven't seen anything like that.
2005-06-27T07:10:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	http://www.wallpaperbase.com/animated.shtml
2005-06-27T07:12:00.000Z	topyli	ThE__OnE	i doubt that works on gnome
