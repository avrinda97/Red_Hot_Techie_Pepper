2008-11-01T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	le000	why are you in the root group...?  And why can't you sudo?
2008-11-01T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	le000	sure, but WHY?
2008-11-01T02:03:00.000Z	jrib	le000	undo what you did.  What you did sucks.  We can fix your sudo after and help you not have to type sudo so much...
2008-11-01T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	le000	reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then remove your user from the root group and add him to the "admin" group
2008-11-01T02:05:00.000Z	jrib	le000	deluser your_username root; adduser your_username admin
2008-11-01T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	le000	I'll take it :)
2008-11-01T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	le000	when you need to do a lot of sudo stuff use 'sudo -i' by the way.  And then 'exit' when you are done.  Should be a rare occasion though ;)
2008-11-01T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	le000	you mean in the gui?
2008-11-01T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	le000	oh.  Well it does cache the password for 15 minutes.  You can increase that or remove the password for certain commands if it bothers you that much
2008-11-01T02:15:00.000Z	jrib	le000	k, np
2008-11-01T02:33:00.000Z	jrib	le000	move or delete ~/.xmms2 (not sure on the path)
2008-11-01T02:38:00.000Z	le000	jrib	i cannot find the file
2008-11-01T02:39:00.000Z	jrib	le000	ah, it may be ~/.config/xmms2
2008-11-01T02:40:00.000Z	le000	jrib	thanks, i found it
