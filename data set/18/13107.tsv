2006-01-10T14:31:00.000Z	xae		okay guys, I finally got ubuntu installed and working... now how do I get my windows to work once again :)
2006-01-10T14:31:00.000Z	xae		it begins to boot, but then freezes on load
2006-01-10T14:31:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	it should just work. did you have windows on the first hard drive, and the first partition?
2006-01-10T14:32:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	yes, however I had to change the boot order in the bios, so it thinks "ubuntu = hd0" and windows = "hd1"   (even tho windoiws is on hda, and linux is on hdb)
2006-01-10T14:33:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	it is a file, if you have a gui editor, you can edit it. the file is at /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-01-10T14:34:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	yes i know, I was wondering if there was an automated tool available =\
2006-01-10T14:34:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	why did you have to switch it in bios?
2006-01-10T14:34:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	my mbr is messed up on hda (windows)
2006-01-10T14:34:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	you should have installed grub into mbr, and it would have done it.
2006-01-10T14:35:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	I tried that option, no luck
2006-01-10T14:35:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	a multitude of errors occured with that
2006-01-10T14:37:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	"Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x7"
2006-01-10T14:38:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	then it... freezes up (well, the _ is still blinking)
2006-01-10T14:38:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	that is over my head, mostly.
2006-01-10T14:38:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	ahh k =\
2006-01-10T14:39:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	I do not think there is a grub way to do it. I would reinstall everything on the proper hard disk, windows has to be on first partition of first hard disk for it to load. I even think this problem is related to windows, not to grub.
2006-01-10T14:39:00.000Z	dabaR__	xae	but again, I could be wrong.
2006-01-10T14:39:00.000Z	xae	dabaR__	=\ k (and I dont think it has to be on the first disk, ive had linux on my large drive before / win on small one)
