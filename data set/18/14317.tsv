2010-03-07T10:20:00.000Z	fek		mIT...did you happen to see my question?
2010-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	fek		I have a friend who has a macbook and it took a dive on her....I have her hard drive hooked up to my box and can see her stuff but it says I dont have the correct permissions to access her folder?
2010-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	fek		I can see the drive and the folders
2010-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 mount it with the proper options, or use sudo user/method to access the files
2010-03-07T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 then use the root user to access the files
2010-03-07T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 install 'mc' use 'sudo mc' for a file manager..   in mc use Fkeys to do differnt things
2010-03-07T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 the drive is in /media/ somewhere
2010-03-07T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 depending on the filesystem in use. that may or may NOT work.,
2010-03-07T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 i allreayd suggested using 'sudo mc' as a file manager that runs as root to access the files
2010-03-07T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 you cant change permissions/ownership on the fly with ntfs/vfat/ and other non linux type filesystems
2010-03-07T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 or you could CAREFULLY run nautilus file manager as root with 'gkduso nautilus /media/whateverthat#was'
2010-03-07T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 then copy the stuff somewhere
2010-03-07T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 sudo apt-get install mc
2010-03-07T10:38:00.000Z	fek	Dr_Willis	...should I preserve attributes when copying the directory over?
2010-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 Depends on what  the fs is and what data is on it. and what fs you are copying it to
2010-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 then it wont matter
2010-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	fek	Dr_Willis	Will the files that I am transfering over to the ntfs drive from the mac drive be visible to me?
2010-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fek	 no idea. depends on how the ntfs is mounteed
