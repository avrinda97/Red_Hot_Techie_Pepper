2008-01-28T22:20:00.000Z	phroughy	ssn	no one is going to help you if you flood
2008-01-28T22:21:00.000Z	phroughy	ssn	have you tried to google for help?
2008-01-28T22:21:00.000Z	ssn	phroughy	i dont have x anymore
2008-01-28T22:22:00.000Z	phroughy	ssn	do you have another computer to use? a friends or a public computer?
2008-01-28T22:22:00.000Z	ssn	phroughy	no, but elinks
2008-01-28T22:23:00.000Z	ssn		i googled and there are just these tutorials how to get nvidia running
2008-01-28T22:23:00.000Z	ssn		but not on the fact, that installing other kernels than i386 doesnt work
2008-01-28T22:23:00.000Z	phroughy	ssn	you usually get better results doing a google search, rather than hoping that someone here knows how to help you, so try to do that. if you need to you can use lynx
