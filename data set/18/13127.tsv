2006-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	bladedge		its weird
2006-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	probably some heating problem and kernel turn off to save it's ass.
2006-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	power it up.. who knows. check if power cable got unplugged and battery is 0% full.
2006-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	first time it happened?
2006-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	bladedge	pilgrim	 yesturday
2006-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	this is _second_ time? wow. did you check logs last time?
2006-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	is it like instant with no warning whatsoever?
2006-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	that's scary...as a precaution I'm logging off from this channel just in case it's contaiguious.
2006-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	ok...so you're talking to us about your laptop that has windows on it? And ubunut is fine?
2006-01-05T08:39:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	see now that must be the problem.
2006-01-05T08:40:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	<joking> windows is always the problem...(more seriously check the bios, I had this thing happening with a sytem of mine and it costs me $40 to find out it was the bios setting I changed)
2006-01-05T08:41:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	restored to default?
2006-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	well, then it should hurt to restore default settings.
2006-01-05T08:52:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	always helpse to have 1+
2006-01-05T08:57:00.000Z	pilgrim	bladedge	maybe it's the NTFS support in linux.
