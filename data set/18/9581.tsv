2007-04-02T09:00:00.000Z	kenthomson		HELP; What version of Ubuntu do i need if i have a core 2 duo (1.8GHZ)? Please help
2007-04-02T09:01:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	the standard 386 kernel should detect your multi-cores
2007-04-02T09:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	neozen	are you sure? Should i get the generic-kernel, tell me the 64-bit people need seperate kernel, than why don't I? Will i loose some of my potential performance?
2007-04-02T09:02:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	no
2007-04-02T09:02:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	running 64 bit kernel HUGE pain
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	neozen	you are not sure?
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	just get the 386 version and it will install the proper SMP (simple multi-processor) kernel
2007-04-02T09:04:00.000Z	kenthomson	neozen	and that means i will be able to use all my processor's performance without loosing anything?
2007-04-02T09:04:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	you don't want the amd64 kernel.... its only for certain finicky amd chipsets
2007-04-02T09:04:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	yes... you will get the right performance
2007-04-02T09:05:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	after you install do an update & upgrade, and uname -r (on the terminal) should have SMP in the name
2007-04-02T09:06:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	that should give you peace of mind
2007-04-02T09:07:00.000Z	kenthomson	neozen	and by that we mean that i can simply pop-in a ubuntu live cd and carry on as usual, and the generic-kernel would utilise the full potential of my PC?
2007-04-02T09:08:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	thats the experience my friends with core duo's have seen
2007-04-02T09:08:00.000Z	kenthomson	neozen	thank you, you have been really helpful.
2007-04-02T09:08:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	but a livecd won't give you the speed a full install would
2007-04-02T09:08:00.000Z	neozen	kenthomson	no problem
