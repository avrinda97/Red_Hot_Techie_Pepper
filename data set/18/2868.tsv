2012-03-28T19:52:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy		this is a fresh install of Ubuntu (less than 2 days old)
2012-03-28T19:53:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	setting a system root password is not a good idea.
2012-03-28T19:54:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	Pumpkin- is correct above.
2012-03-28T19:54:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	mneptok	I "would" like to put it back to the way it was prior to me changing it. Is this possible>?
2012-03-28T19:54:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	you set a system-wide Ubuntu root password. the MySQL root password is something else entirely.
2012-03-28T19:55:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	sudo passwd -dl root
2012-03-28T19:55:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	mneptok	so that will put it back to the default way Ubuntu runs the root passwd?
2012-03-28T19:56:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	quite right.
2012-03-28T19:56:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	mneptok	thanks for that...
2012-03-28T19:56:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	go do that, and then look at MySQL root access
2012-03-28T19:57:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	mneptok	already done that part
2012-03-28T20:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	things such as Webmin then introduce any security flaws they have to the entire system, as it has system-wide access.
2012-04-06T06:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	you want people to be able to sit at this machine itself, access files, and not have an account that they use? not possible. you have to login to a session as *someone*
2012-04-06T06:05:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	mneptok	I'm talking about "local network" access; sorry I should have been more specific
2012-04-06T06:05:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	samba, nfs, ftp ....
2012-04-06T06:07:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	check box where?
2012-04-06T06:12:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	mneptok	when I right click on the folder and select "sharing options" the check box for 'guest access' is greyed out so I can't select it
2012-05-28T21:11:00.000Z	mneptok	Dj_FlyBy	10.04 is supported. and load times depend on other hardware, too.
