2007-05-23T15:01:00.000Z	zero-9376	dromer	had that problem today, seems to be due to mounting the wrong partition as home i used fdisk - l /dev/hdX to work out what the correct partitions were...the whole UUID system in fstab and grub hasn't worked well for me
2007-05-23T15:03:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	wel I'm having even more problems .. apperantly windows corrupted one of my disks, linux thinks it's ntfs now (except fdisk which still sees it as Linux)
2007-05-23T15:05:00.000Z	zero-9376	dromer	i would try installing gparted and see what it thinks of your partitions then modify fstab based on that
2007-05-23T15:05:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	I have gparted, and it also says my partition is ntfs, but it gives some warning
2007-05-23T15:06:00.000Z	zero-9376	dromer	so you have only one partition
2007-05-23T15:07:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	no I have many
2007-05-23T15:08:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	just this one that windows ruined :S
2007-05-23T15:08:00.000Z	zero-9376	dromer	how are you trying ot mount it
2007-05-23T15:09:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	well, atm just with mount, but since gparted says it's ntfs maybe I should try something else
2007-05-23T15:15:00.000Z	zero-9376	dromer	you still need help?
2007-05-23T15:16:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	yes!
2007-05-23T15:16:00.000Z	dromer	zero-9376	I'm making a screen of gparted and a paste of fdisk
