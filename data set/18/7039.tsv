2008-06-26T05:03:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	yes
2008-06-26T05:04:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	i have all the installed grub files. when i boot grub loads. it loads stage 1.5. then it says "loading grub please wait" and then says error 2
2008-06-26T05:07:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	it has two lines. one saying (fd0) /dev/fd0 and the other sayd (hd0) /dev/sda
2008-06-26T05:09:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	that depends.  when i boot to the internal drive it is /dev/sda and its (hd0).  when i boot to the external drive i KNOW that IT is (hd0) is it also /dev/sda?

2008-06-26T05:15:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	that depends.  if i boot to my internal drive the external drive is (hd1) not (hd0)
2008-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	the external drive gives error 2
2008-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	i dont SET my bios, i hit escape and select where to boot to.
2008-06-26T05:19:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	hitting escape is the same as changing th eboot order in the bios
2008-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	the bios's boot device selection menu shows all available boot devices
2008-06-26T05:22:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	i did paste the menu.lst

2008-06-26T05:30:00.000Z	I440r	amenado	hmm... so even though it does detect it as (hd0) it might still be (hdb) ?
