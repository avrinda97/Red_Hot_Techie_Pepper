2010-01-02T10:45:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy	Guest18066	 Hi there. How come you are using samba share with and ubuntu box?  You could use nfs sharing which works really well
2010-01-02T10:45:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	well I have windows machines too
2010-01-02T10:46:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	think you could help me some how :\
2010-01-02T10:47:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy		Guest 18066:  You can use the samba between ubuntu and windows, but I find my ubuntu to ubuntu machines work better with nfs.
2010-01-02T10:47:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	ok, assume im clueless
2010-01-02T10:50:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	how do I do that?
2010-01-02T10:51:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy	Guest18066	 on the computer you want to share you'l have to define your share folders in /etc/exports
2010-01-02T10:52:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	/home/x/Videos/ 192.168.1.0/24(rw,no_root_squash,async)
2010-01-02T10:53:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy		Guest:18066:  That looks correct,  I'm not sure what the async is as I have sync in my shares
2010-01-02T10:54:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	what do i do to try on the client?
2010-01-02T10:55:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy	Guest18066	 now on the client that access the share you have to install nfs server
2010-01-02T10:55:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	it says it is
2010-01-02T10:57:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy	Guest18066	ok,  Now you need to mount the share in fstab
2010-01-02T10:57:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	alright, I have tried that previously with 0 luck to be honest.
2010-01-02T10:58:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy		Guest:18066: can  you show me the fstab command?
2010-01-02T10:58:00.000Z	Guest18066	rad_sci_guy	yea can you open a private message?
