2009-12-17T09:40:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	It's personal opinion (and that is a flame war waiting to happen)
2009-12-17T09:41:00.000Z	Goliath	edbian	what flame war means?
2009-12-17T09:41:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	A fight
2009-12-17T09:41:00.000Z	Goliath	edbian	k, i liked mint but ubuntu is more bleeding edge
2009-12-17T09:42:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	Arch is the most bleeding edge

2009-12-17T09:44:00.000Z	Goliath	edbian	come to offtopic
2011-01-07T10:28:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	in a term: ssh user@computer
2011-01-07T10:28:00.000Z	Goliath	edbian	what if this needs a password for login
2011-01-07T10:28:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	The password thing is a setting on the server.
2011-01-07T10:29:00.000Z	Goliath	edbian	how do i tell it which password to use?
2011-01-07T10:30:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	That's not something you choose. The server either requires password or RSA keys
2011-01-07T10:30:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	It should ask you for the password when you try to log in
2011-01-07T10:30:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	You're logging in to a user name that's on the server.  So you have to know a user and password on that server to log into it via ssh
2011-01-07T10:33:00.000Z	Goliath	edbian	its a shoutcast server
2011-01-07T10:33:00.000Z	edbian	Goliath	That shouldn't make a difference.  As long as it is also an ssh server
