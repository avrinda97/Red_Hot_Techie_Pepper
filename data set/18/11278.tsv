2008-01-14T03:29:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		ertUSUL: I only have one processor but it's dual core. Should I see one process or two?
2008-01-14T03:30:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		where do I get the SMP kernel
2008-01-14T03:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	from synaptic is the  linux-686-smp package
2008-01-14T03:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	afaics top does not show the number of cpus
2008-01-14T03:26:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	erUSUL	It does. I manage another server that has two cpus and I can hit 1 and see both of them.
2008-01-14T03:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2008-01-14T03:28:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	erUSUL	It does. What am I looking for?
2008-01-14T03:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	how many processosrs your kernel thnks you have... in dapper there was still an special *-smp kernel iirc
2008-01-14T03:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	so you may need to install it
2008-01-14T03:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	you should see 2 processors
2008-01-14T03:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	but as i said in dapper you need the smp kernel
2008-01-14T03:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	iirc
2008-01-14T03:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	for an intel Core
2008-01-14T03:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	did you installed and booted the smp kernel?
2008-01-14T03:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	it is maybe to knew for the dapper kernel 2.6.15 is an old release
2008-01-14T03:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	try with the kernel from edgy... dl the deb from packages.ubuntu.com it might work
2008-01-14T03:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	althought if i were you i would install a newer version of ubuntu server
2008-01-14T03:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	DigitalNinja	what software?
