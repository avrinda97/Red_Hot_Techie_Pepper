2007-10-20T04:08:00.000Z	cliechti		now where is that shiny new X config window that is prised in the news? i still get the old one in system->prefs and the news don't mention hot to start the new one
2007-10-20T04:08:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	system>administration>screens and graphics
2007-10-20T04:10:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	ok, i have german menus. the closest thing translates into "screen resolution" and thats the old one. do i need to install something? i was using gutsy for months. but the system is up to date as of today
2007-10-20T04:11:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	i'm on AMD64 is the new one maybe not compatible?
2007-10-20T04:12:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	hm, im not sure what it would translate into in german.  but it sounds to me like you're looking in system>preferences.  that's where my "screen resolution" menu item is.  my "screens and graphics" window is in system>administration, make sure you look there rather than system>preferences.
2007-10-20T04:14:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	then something seems to be missing here. all i find there that is GUI related is the gdm config.
2007-10-20T04:15:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	hm, thats interesting.  what is right after the restricted manager menu item?
2007-10-20T04:17:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	that starts with a "v" in the translation and is the very last line
2007-10-20T04:18:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	bah, darn translations :-P  i'm not sure what to tell you then unfortunately :-(
2007-10-20T04:21:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	do you know the package name? i just browsed the not installed packages in base, gnome and system section but i did not find an uninstalled package that could be it
2007-10-20T04:24:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	let me see if i can find it
2007-10-20T04:25:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	looks like the package is called "displayconfig-gtk"
2007-10-20T04:26:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	yep that exists and is not (yet) installed
2007-10-20T04:27:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	install away and see if that's what you're looking for, and let me know if i was correct :-)
2007-10-20T04:28:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	installed "bildschirme und grafik" which translates fine into english, and it looks fine. is that accidently not a dependency of the gnome-desktop package? (bug)
2007-10-20T04:28:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	im not sure how it wasn't installed for you, i installed gutsy from scratch and it was installed by default, definitely strange
2007-10-20T04:32:00.000Z	cliechti	Cable86	anyway, thanks. i made some changes and will see if they actually work on next login :-)
2007-10-20T04:32:00.000Z	Cable86	cliechti	sure thing :-)
