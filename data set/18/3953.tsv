2009-06-29T16:43:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	use ifconfig for local IP's.
2009-06-29T16:43:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	Your internet IP is on your router. You can usually change that by pulling out the power and plugging back in
2009-06-29T16:44:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	You usually have one IP per internet connection
2009-06-29T16:44:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	However, your computer can have hundreds of "local"
2009-06-29T16:45:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	"local" IP's, depending on your NIC's
2009-06-29T16:45:00.000Z	Seifer	Syka	but how i can connect more than 3bncs with deffrent ips ?¿
2009-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	If it's local, go to a terminal and use "man ifconfig"
2009-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	Syka	Seifer	It will explain how to use ifconfig, which can change it
