2007-03-16T11:17:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	i use them both and i use diff clients
2007-03-16T11:17:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	will you be here when Deluge makes it into a repo, tues gets it via apt, and the machine loses its mind? ;)
2007-03-16T11:18:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	unfortunately not, but it has worked fine for me for a long while, thats all im saying
2007-03-16T11:18:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	please do not refer new Ubuntu users to external repositories for apps that have similar functionality in official repos
2007-03-16T11:19:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	i have had to clean up a LOT of nasty messes caused by new users compiling software or using external repos
2007-03-16T11:19:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	i dont exactly understand what you are saying, i do appologize tho
2007-03-16T11:20:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	third party repos are the #1 issue people have when upgrading Ubuntu
2007-03-16T11:21:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	what if getdeb.net's Deluge depends on a new libstdc++ ? *boom* game over for that user. :)
2007-03-16T11:22:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	i understand the "i know how to do this and i can help" impulse. but consider the audience. i can load a gun with bullets blindfolded. but i wouldn't help a child do it. ;)
2007-03-16T11:23:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	once again i get that, but that is no way is a good analogy ;)
2007-03-16T11:25:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	my advice is "avoid compositors for a little while"
2007-03-16T11:25:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	why do you say that?
2007-03-16T11:26:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	when they work, they mostly kinda almost work. but when they break, it's a thing of horrific beauty.
2007-03-16T11:26:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	IMO, the risks outweigh the benefits
2007-03-16T11:27:00.000Z	mneptok	fletch_	you're further along than most :)
2007-03-16T11:27:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	i had it running fine, like to the point i could get the cube up, but it was a solid white cube
2007-03-16T11:28:00.000Z	fletch_	mneptok	ive had beryl up and running for a long time on my amd/nvidia desktop
