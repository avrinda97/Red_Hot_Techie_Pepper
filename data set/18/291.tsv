2012-09-13T02:34:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	thank you!
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	that ppa does not seem to have packages for precise. should I just try to manually install the 12.10 version?
2012-09-13T02:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Or1on	Strange it skips from oneric to quantal, do you have the universe repo open in /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-09-13T02:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Or1on	I think this is a deb that will work. http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-12.04/ubuntu-universe-i386/indicator-cpufreq_0.1.4-0ubuntu2_all.deb/download/
2012-09-13T02:46:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	yes I have universe uncommented on source.list. OK I will give that I try. I think its the same one I have tho
2012-09-13T02:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Or1on	How did you install the one you have.
2012-09-13T02:47:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	from software center
2012-09-13T02:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Or1on	Hmm, I have been using it for awhile never needing root it autostrats with the desktop.
2012-09-13T02:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		autostarts*
2012-09-13T02:49:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	hmm... maybe my user is supposed to be in a group that is not?
2012-09-13T02:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Or1on	If you have admin I would think you are alright, not sure on permissions though.
2012-09-13T02:51:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	I have been upgrading since 2009. maybe a setting didn't updated. yes I have admin
2012-09-13T02:51:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	I'm also using low-latency kernel. I'm not sure if that makes a difference tho
2012-09-13T02:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Or1on	I have no idea really, paths and permissions if I can describe loosely are not really an area I would have any info of without googling them.
2012-09-13T02:55:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	someone in the forums said that it worked after a reboot. I will give that a try. thanks for the help!
2012-09-13T02:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		sure
2012-09-13T03:03:00.000Z	Or1on	wilee-nilee	it still requires sudo to work. I'm giving up for now.
