2010-03-03T06:34:00.000Z	yemino_		can anyone help my. I have problems trying using skype. The sound it's to bad
2010-03-03T06:36:00.000Z	shaunlewis	yemino_	 A lot of skype sound quality issues are related to your internet connection. Are there any clues is related to your ubuntu configuration?
2010-03-03T06:37:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	my internet connection it's right. On my another partition I don't have problems
2010-03-03T06:38:00.000Z	shaunlewis	yemino_	So what exactly is the problem? Any sound at all? Cutting out? Happing in any other programs?
2010-03-03T06:38:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	when i install my ubuntu, I was can't listen anything, so I was install sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic
2010-03-03T06:39:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	I listen broken, and my friend listen to my broken. That's all
2010-03-03T06:56:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	do you have any idea ti fix my audio problem?
2010-03-03T06:41:00.000Z	shaunlewis	yemino_	So you don't have any working sound, but you have a second ubuntu install on an another partition that works fine?
2010-03-03T06:42:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	summarizing, I can not understand what they tell me my contacts and the can't understandme
2010-03-03T06:42:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	I can listen with mplayer and totem
2010-03-03T06:44:00.000Z	shaunlewis	yemino_	In that case, its not likely to be a probelm with your sound configuration. Can you hear anything at all, or is it just really bad quality?
2010-03-03T06:45:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	 I hace a win7 partition where I can use skype (and other pc with ubuntu). But with this laptop (hp pavilion) I have the problem
2010-03-03T06:46:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	it's extrange. Some time I can listen, and sometime no. Now I cant use totem or maplayer.
2010-03-03T06:48:00.000Z	shaunlewis	yemino_	Does it say anything when you start totem, or do you just have no sound?
2010-03-03T06:49:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	mplayer and totem don't run. mplayer says "MPlayer interrupted by signal 2 in module: play_audio"
2010-03-03T06:50:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	It's posible return to original configuration or something?
2010-03-03T06:50:00.000Z	yemino_	shaunlewis	or reinstall something?
2010-03-03T06:52:00.000Z	shaunlewis	yemino_	you can kind of revert to default settings by doing an apt-get purge of ny troublesome software and reinstalling, but im not sure what you would want to reinstall
