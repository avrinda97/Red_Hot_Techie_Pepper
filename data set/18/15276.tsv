2005-04-25T09:28:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	ar you using totem-xine or totem-gstreamer?
2005-04-25T09:29:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	if you didn't explicitly install it, then you are using totem-gstreamer. Installing totem-xine typically works better.
2005-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	nobody writes viruses (often) for Linux.
2005-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	in time you'll need to run one though.
2005-04-25T10:10:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	is this in GNOME?
2005-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	no.
2005-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	what are you looking to install?
2005-04-25T10:53:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	if you are looking to install azureus, this might help --> http://ubuntuguide.org/#azureus
2005-04-25T10:53:00.000Z	dcraven	triandafilos	Warty was the first release of Ubuntu, Hoary is the latest (a week old almost). Hoary is just a newer version.
