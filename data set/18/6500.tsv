2009-08-02T07:43:00.000Z	josht		yea i guess actually seems better than gui kinda
2009-08-02T07:43:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	do you happen to live in southern Arizona?
2009-08-02T07:47:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	I would just try and go through the help file bit by bit, and just experiment. That's how I learned the basics myself.
2009-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	it's /part
2009-08-02T07:52:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	all IRC commands are prefixed with a forward slash and accept parameters afterwards. For instance, /part Leaving would cause you to leave the room and print "Leaving"
2009-08-02T07:53:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	page up
2009-08-02T07:58:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	about as many as you'd ever want, so long as you have enough RAM
2009-08-02T07:59:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	You can also manage terminal tabs with the program "screen", although that's a bit more primitive and only really useful in a TTY (the thing you get when you press CTRL+ALT+F1 through F6. CTRL+ALT+F7 gets you back to X Windows)
2009-08-02T08:03:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	CLI = Terminal = TTY = Console
2009-08-02T08:09:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	I'm self-taught with the occasional help of these good people and Google
2009-08-02T08:10:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	Look for the Ubuntu Pocket Guide. I think you can find it in Synaptic, actually
2009-08-02T08:12:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	Get compiz working and that'll blow anyone away =D Also google for Tombuntu XWinWrap Compiz
2009-08-02T08:13:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	It lets you use a video or xscreensaver as a background
2009-08-02T08:14:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	Try gtk-recordmydesktop
2009-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	not really, but --one sec, k?
2009-08-02T08:18:00.000Z	Surlent777	josht	I just tried gtk-recordmydesktop and it seemed to deal with the cube ok
