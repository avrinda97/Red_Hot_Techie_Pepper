2009-10-11T00:25:00.000Z	kilo		anyone know why some youtube vids don't work on ubuntu 9.04? They just come up blank... (like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gaid72fqzNE&feature=related)
2009-10-11T00:25:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	that's not a problem of ubuntu
2009-10-11T00:26:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	that's what I thought... except they play fine on mozilla on my windows box   :(:(
2009-10-11T00:26:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	as I said: that's not a problem of ubuntu
2009-10-11T00:27:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	rtfm, do you have a flash plugin?
2009-10-11T00:28:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	While I appreciate the statement, that does not enlighten me as to where the problem lay.  ;)   Naturally, I would assume that since it works on a win box, and not on a linux box, that the problem was with linux. Do you have another suggestion?

2009-10-11T00:28:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	I do. Certain vids work. others do not
2009-10-11T00:28:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	strange. what's the diff between those that work and those who don't?
2009-10-11T00:29:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	do you have an example vid?
2009-10-11T00:29:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	I have no idea... been trying to figure it out.  one of the vids that doesn't work is here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gaid72fqzNE&feature=related
2009-10-11T00:30:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	I know... majorly strange, considering the vids on youtube are all formatted... lol!
2009-10-11T00:30:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	works for me
2009-10-11T00:31:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	what error do you get?
2009-10-11T00:31:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	no error. just a black box where the vid is supposed to be.
2009-10-11T00:31:00.000Z	boscop	kilo	what browser?
2009-10-11T00:32:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	mozilla ff 3.0.14 ... VERY fresh ubuntu install
2009-10-11T00:32:00.000Z	kilo	boscop	I only started using 3 days ago   ;)
