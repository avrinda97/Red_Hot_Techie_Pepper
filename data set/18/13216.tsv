2005-12-26T14:59:00.000Z	sapo`		Can someone look at this picture of my install error and tell me what the hell is going on? http://sheldonmsa.org/ub_err1.jpg
2005-12-26T15:00:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	something very strange
2005-12-26T15:01:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: it sure is... I tried over 3 times to install using a CD and a DVD
2005-12-26T15:01:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	have you checked the integrity of the install disc? has this happened more than once?
2005-12-26T15:01:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: yes it has happened over 3 times now with a CD and a DVD
2005-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	what sort of machine are you on?
2005-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	is it known-good hardware?
2005-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: AMD64, yes it is
2005-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: no cheap hardware all custom built
2005-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	and you're using the 64 bit install disc/kernel?
2005-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: yes
2005-12-26T15:03:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: I have both the Install CD and DVD same thing
2005-12-26T15:03:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	did you build it? has it run any other OSes?
2005-12-26T15:04:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: yes I built the machine or are you talking about something else... It's been running XP for over 6 months and it run SUSE and Knoppix no problem
2005-12-26T15:04:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	:( looks like this is a problem with ubu (possibly fixed by later kernel updates, but that won't help you install)
2005-12-26T15:05:00.000Z	sapo`	djm62	: bleh... I guess I should install SUSE again or do you know any similar distro to Ubuntu
2005-12-26T15:06:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	pragmatically I'd say work with SuSe if SUSE works with your hardware... otherwise, you could install a /minimal/ debian set up and try to convert that to ubuntu
2005-12-26T15:08:00.000Z	djm62	sapo`	IE, install just enough for net access and a text editor, then add the ubuntu repositories to your sources.list
