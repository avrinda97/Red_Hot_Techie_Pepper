2008-05-26T00:00:00.000Z	delight		hi ... anybody here that knows how to make ff3 in hardy 64bit run java applets ?
2008-05-26T00:01:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	you mean you wanna install java plugin for ff in hardy 64?
2008-05-26T00:05:00.000Z	delight		ï»¿RoAkSoAx: yes ... i tried both gcjwebplugins that are offered when you go to a site with java applet ... but the best i got was grey boxes
2008-05-26T00:05:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	try installing it from a terminal: sudo apt-get install icedtea-java7-plugin
2008-05-26T00:05:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	i did it that way and it worked just fine
2008-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	i remember on 32bit gutsy i simply had a alternatives firefox javaplugin linking to the plugin provided by the sun-java-jdk
2008-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	i'll try that ... are you on 64 ?
2008-05-26T00:08:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	yes hardy 64
2008-05-26T00:09:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	its seems a few applets are working ... others ain't
2008-05-26T00:09:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	i had the same problem, when i installed it through FF, i had a grey screen.. but when i did it through a terminal, it worked just fine
2008-05-26T00:10:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	can you try http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml?ff3
2008-05-26T00:10:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	or for example http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/watch/ci6DbhEI
2008-05-26T00:10:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	 that ones working with the plugin http://www.heise.de/security/dienste/browsercheck/tests/java.shtml
2008-05-26T00:11:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	sometimes, i have to remove it an install it again to get it working
2008-05-26T00:13:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	it works all good in for example konqueror as browser ... but not in FF3
2008-05-26T00:14:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	it's pretty weird cuz i had it working on FF3, and sometimes it does not work, and sometimes it does, sames as flashplugin
2008-05-26T00:14:00.000Z	delight	RoAkSoAx	well hopefully it gets better ... thats a quite bad behaviour
2008-05-26T00:15:00.000Z	RoAkSoAx	delight	yep it is, but well, hope when ff3 is stable, everything will work right
