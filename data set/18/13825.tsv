2010-05-08T11:50:00.000Z	TyanColte		desu?

2010-05-08T11:53:00.000Z	TyanColte		that causes it to not mount, the only way it would mount is if i added that
2010-05-08T11:53:00.000Z	TyanColte		otherwise when i tried to mount it manually it said only root can mount
2010-05-08T11:53:00.000Z	TyanColte		i've tried it before i put sudo in there
2010-05-08T11:54:00.000Z	TyanColte		wait, does the folder have to exist before i can mount to it?
2010-05-08T11:54:00.000Z	TyanColte		that dosn't make sense
2010-05-08T11:55:00.000Z	TyanColte		you're telling me something i alreday know, i know sudo doesn't belong in fstab, i put it in there temporarily to make it work for a bit but i was trying to figure out how to make it automount without using it
2010-05-08T11:55:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	can't mount something on something that doesn't exist
2010-05-08T11:56:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	your mount folder is the door to the block device you are trying to mount.... no door no access to device.
2010-05-08T11:58:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	...
2010-05-08T12:15:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	histo is talking about the commandline now not entries in fstab.
2010-05-08T12:16:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	where is a pastebin of your /etc/fstab  ?
2010-05-08T12:17:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	you don't have encryption or something exotic turned enabled for the windows7drive ?
2010-05-08T12:18:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	how did you get that uuid for the windows7drive ?
2010-05-08T12:23:00.000Z	airtonix	TyanColte	uuid is supposed to be 5 groups of hexadecimal digits
