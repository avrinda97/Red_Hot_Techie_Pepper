2012-01-25T22:56:00.000Z	lagbox		hello all
2012-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	lagbox		any reason on 11.04 im getting dependency problems trying to install gimp ? seems py-gtk isnt correct
2012-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	got any PPA's running
2012-01-25T22:58:00.000Z	lagbox	ikonia	they are disabled
2012-01-25T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	they have probably messed up your dependencies though
2012-01-25T22:59:00.000Z	lagbox	ikonia	anyway to force it to fix the dependencies ... because the software using the ppa's was removed before the upgrade
2012-01-25T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	no
2012-01-25T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	you have to do it all manually
2012-01-25T23:02:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	yes, as I told you
2012-01-25T23:02:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	your PPA's will have pulled down conflicting dependencies
2012-01-25T23:02:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	it is very common with PPA maintainers who are not putting any thought into base product compatability
2012-01-25T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	it's one of the main reasons PPA's are not supported or recommended
2012-01-25T23:04:00.000Z	lagbox	ikonia	i understand ... how do i remove all packages from that ppa then
2012-01-25T23:06:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	manually investigate and remove conflicts
2012-01-25T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	dependencies from PPA
2012-01-25T23:42:00.000Z	lagbox	ikonia	yup ... working down the chain
2012-01-25T23:42:00.000Z	lagbox	ikonia	i will get there
2012-01-25T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	lagbox	2.6
