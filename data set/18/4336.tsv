2009-05-09T07:18:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	I guess that is system > preferences > compizconfig settings manager?
2009-05-09T07:18:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	yes that was it :/ i dont know on the website they called it that, thanks anyway :D
2009-07-30T21:07:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	find out what repository supplies it, add that to software sources and install; or compile from source
2009-07-30T21:07:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	what version do you need?
2009-07-30T21:08:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	the very latest, and no i wont try to compile from source, cause last time i tried doing that and installing the libraries my computer crashed and i had to format !
2009-07-30T21:09:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	http://packages.ubunut.com/en/karmic/evolution <--- this one !
2009-07-30T21:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	if you're not running karmic I wouldn't use that
2009-07-30T21:10:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	why not ? :/
2009-07-30T21:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	it expects karmic stuff, so lots of dependency issues probably
2009-07-30T21:11:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	and i cant download the latest from source and mine crashes more often, now what are my choices ?
2009-07-30T21:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	use other mailclient ;) or use older version that worked for you and lock the version in synaptic
2009-07-30T21:12:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	do you have any other mail client as good as evolution ? i don't think Ubuntu chose it for fun, i think they chose it for a purpose !
2009-07-30T21:12:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	feel free to give me a client and i'll try it ! maybe i would like it more !
2009-07-30T21:13:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	depends on what you want, Thunderbird has lots of features, claws-mail is very lightweight and is just an emailclient
2009-07-30T21:13:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and Address book !
2009-07-30T21:14:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	then use claws-mail
2009-07-30T21:14:00.000Z	VCoolio	Armageddon	I think you can convert evolution address book to clawsmail, google that
2009-07-30T21:15:00.000Z	Armageddon	VCoolio	i dont need to, i already formated :P i said my system crashed beyond repair cause of evolution
