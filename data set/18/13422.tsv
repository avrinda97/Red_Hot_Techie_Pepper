2005-12-27T09:12:00.000Z	blanky		hey guys, how can I run the x window manager (such thing?)
2005-12-27T09:12:00.000Z	blanky		x window system or whatever
2005-12-27T09:12:00.000Z	blanky		in other words, not gnome/kde/fluxbox/blackbox etc.
2005-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	blanky		lol why is autoamtix crap
2005-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	blanky		but isn't there also xwindows or wahtever, like, when it doesn, yeah i think that, intelikey
2005-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	blanky		I mean how there's sometimes windows with no themes
2005-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	You can run X with just a window manager
2005-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	technically, it isn't really different than running a desktop
2005-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	although operationally of course it is much more difficult
2005-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	as noted, twm, icewm, there is also fvwm, mwm (motif)
2005-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	lesstif, the motif clone, is lower overhead than even a small desktop like fluxbox, but a cut above twm
2005-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	whether or not there is a pluggable theme for a particular window manager depends on how the windoe manager is architected.
2005-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	blanky	sethk	yeah i dont mean that though
2005-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	twm, mwm, etc., don't require gtk or qt
2005-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	you do need a minimal window manager running
2005-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	twm looks just like twm
2005-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	it's amazing  :)
2005-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	sethk	blanky	you mean fvwm
