2007-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	hexstar		the firewall could be misconfigured :D
2007-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	that doesn't tell about checking the signature of Ubuntu's ISO images
2007-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	I just want to know where to get their GPG key
2007-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	hexstar	AnAnt	oh sorry, don't know
2007-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	hexstar	AnAnt	what specific commands cause this issue?
2007-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	no specific commands
2007-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	actually, it happens before the command starts
2007-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	hexstar	AnAnt	do you have anything else open when this happens?
2007-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	for example, I write part of the command or argument, then I press TAB, this can cause a crash
2007-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	hexstar	AnAnt	ah, that's bizarr...have you done an fsck?
2007-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	sometimes it happens when viewing output of less
2007-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	yup, btw, this is a new installation
2007-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	hexstar	AnAnt	I would recommend trying a fsck, to do this follow these steps. While booted into linux: 1) Open a terminal session 2) Type in df -h 3) look on the right side for / under mount points 4) to the left in the same column look for the device name which'll be ?dev/something 5) boot off ubuntu install cd 6) open terminal session 7) type fsck -fy /dev/something
2007-07-26T12:48:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	this used to happen even during installation
2007-07-26T12:48:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	before reaching the stage of partitioning !
2007-07-26T12:49:00.000Z	hexstar	AnAnt	yes, that can be caused by a issue with the hard drive. Fsck will check for consistency errors and repair them if they exist, if there aren't any errors found by fsck I recommend doing a memory test as this could occurr due to faulty ram as well
2007-07-26T12:49:00.000Z	AnAnt	hexstar	I did fsck
