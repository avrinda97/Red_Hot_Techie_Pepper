2005-10-19T11:28:00.000Z	Ruudi		is there a way to get iMAC G5 fan speed control working with ubuntu linux?
2005-10-19T11:28:00.000Z	VincentMX	Ruudi	search for fan in the apt
2005-10-19T11:29:00.000Z	VincentMX	Ruudi	you know how to use apt?
2005-10-19T11:29:00.000Z	Ruudi		got no linux installed jet VincentMX
2005-10-19T11:29:00.000Z	VincentMX	Ruudi	ok
2005-10-19T11:30:00.000Z	Ruudi	VincentMX	me thinking if it's possible at all, yellowdog didn't do it, no point to install otherwize
2005-10-19T11:31:00.000Z	VincentMX	Ruudi	has a point. but some parts of MacOSX are opensource. the fanspeed controller maybe ass well
2005-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	Ruudi		well i wonder it would be done then VincentMX just not a programmer by myself...maybe i should just get Tiger :) but well allways liked linux as well
2005-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	VincentMX	Ruudi	ok. maybe you could partition your Hardrive and put MacOSX one one partition and Ubuntu/edubuntu/kubuntu on the other
2005-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	Ruudi		yeah i got yellowdog installed that way...but no thermal control is too noizy to use...
