2005-10-25T15:31:00.000Z	DianWei		It is an issue with the installation; I have finally been able to set up partitions and such, after about a week, and everything is smooth sailing up until it actually starts copying files, at which point it reports an error involving debootstrap, and says to check the log in the debootstrap directory, the log is empty, and I am not sure what to do; reading the forum they say try burning the disk really slowly, and I've just tried burning the d
2005-10-25T15:31:00.000Z	DianWei		slow as my hardware allows, but it still stops at about approximately 30 percent.
2005-10-25T15:31:00.000Z	DianWei		Yes, good sir.
2005-10-25T15:31:00.000Z	DianWei		I tried burning it about three times.
2005-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	DianWei		I already said I burnt it as slow as possible, which was 8x...
2005-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	DianWei		I have checked the md5sum, as a matter of fact.
2005-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	DianWei		Should I just burn a few more disc?
2005-10-25T15:33:00.000Z	DianWei		If the md5 checked out fine, you suppose it would be the burn then?
2005-10-25T15:34:00.000Z	DianWei		I've tried it once at 8x speed and I tried the built in verifier, it said it was ok, so I could try again.
2005-10-25T15:35:00.000Z	DianWei		8x is the slowest my computer allows.
2005-10-25T15:35:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	are you changing the mount points manually
2005-10-25T15:35:00.000Z	DianWei	davmor2	yes.
2005-10-25T15:36:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	is there a reason
2005-10-25T15:45:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	what did you use to setup the partition
2005-10-25T15:47:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	did you set it up as an ext3 partition? if so changeit to a blank partition and let ubuntu do the format.
2005-10-25T15:48:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	no change it to a blank partition let ubuntu set up the space for you.
2005-10-25T15:52:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	okay now boot ubuntu it should just run to the partition section then layout the system the way you want it and carry on with the install
2005-10-25T15:53:00.000Z	davmor2	DianWei	this should erradicate the bootstrap error.  Fingers crossed
