2011-08-31T20:44:00.000Z	rog		is this a really stupid question or something? please put me out of my misery!
2011-08-31T20:44:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Or asked in a different way, which ubuntu version?
2011-08-31T20:45:00.000Z	rog	geirha	11.04 i think
2011-08-31T20:45:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Then minimized windows should be accesible from the menubar on the left
2011-08-31T20:46:00.000Z	rog	geirha	so if i minimise (say) a chrome window, a new item should appear on the left?
2011-08-31T20:46:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Yes, a chrome icon should appear
2011-08-31T20:47:00.000Z	rog	geirha	there's already a chrome icon, but clicking on it doesn't bring up any of the chrome minimised windows
2011-08-31T20:48:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Do you see a small white triangle next to it?
2011-08-31T20:49:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Hm. If you hold down the Alt key and hit TAB, do you see it?
2011-08-31T20:51:00.000Z	geirha	rog	It should work even if it wasn't in that dock. Sounds like you've encountered some bug in unity. Have you installed all the latest updates?
2011-08-31T20:52:00.000Z	rog	geirha	i think so (all the ones it suggested anyway)
2011-08-31T20:52:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Hm. Ok. And by chrome, you mean google-chrome, not chromium, right?
2011-08-31T20:53:00.000Z	rog	geirha	i think so. Chrome as suggested when searching from the Applications icon
2011-08-31T20:54:00.000Z	geirha	rog	That sounds like chromium. It has a blue icon?
2011-08-31T20:54:00.000Z	rog	geirha	no, it has the usual (coloured wheel) icon
2011-08-31T20:55:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Ah, that's google chrome. I'll try installing that on Ubuntu 11.04 and see if I can reproduce it.
2011-08-31T20:55:00.000Z	rog	geirha	thanks
2011-08-31T20:59:00.000Z	geirha	rog	Works as expected here
