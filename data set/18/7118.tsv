2008-03-29T19:45:00.000Z	amenado		Seraph-> i'd try monitoring dmesg and look for error clues?
2008-03-29T19:45:00.000Z	amenado		Seraph-> type dmesg and look near the end
2008-03-29T19:47:00.000Z	amenado		foo-nix-> fuser  or lsof tools can tell you which process hogs the device or file

2008-03-29T19:53:00.000Z	amenado		bhsx-> you are asking me why they designed as such? you are barking on the wrong tree
2008-03-29T19:53:00.000Z	bhsx		i know i know...  it's just that there's lots of missing features like that right now in hardy.. needs a lot of finishing work
2008-03-29T19:53:00.000Z	bhsx		like no wep key field in nm-applet
2008-03-29T19:54:00.000Z	bhsx		things like that... otherwise hardy is friggin amazing... just needs some polishing
2008-03-29T19:54:00.000Z	amenado	bhsx	honestly, i dont like those gui, to me gnome is not intuitive, but in command line, one should be able to activate/deactivate features..
