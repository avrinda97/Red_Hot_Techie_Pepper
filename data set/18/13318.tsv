2006-01-06T13:02:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Seveas	I know how to get it working again. Just need to get into a root user in my live cd to do it.
2006-01-06T13:02:00.000Z	Seveas	nox-Hand	sudo -i
2006-01-06T13:03:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Seveas	Right! Cheers
2006-07-26T05:48:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Seveas	Cheers.
2006-07-27T05:01:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Seveas	Is that really a swearword? w00t.. Sorry mate..
2006-07-27T05:02:00.000Z	Seveas	nox-Hand	yes, this channel has an almost zero-tolerance on swearing and it works surprisingly well
2006-07-27T05:04:00.000Z	Seveas	nox-Hand	I'd appreciate that 
2006-07-27T05:05:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Seveas	That smiley you are writing is a bit different in xchat. What is it? :-)
2008-03-13T23:16:00.000Z	Seveas	nox-Hand	it's the driver from nvidia.com
2008-03-13T23:17:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Seveas	Indeed, but does that driver classify as XGL, or is it something different it uses?
2008-03-13T23:17:00.000Z	Seveas	nox-Hand	XGL isn't a driver
