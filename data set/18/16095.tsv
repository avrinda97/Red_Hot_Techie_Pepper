2004-11-13T13:12:00.000Z	mercurus	aratdagnir	use the System Monitor to see if it is slowly loading, or if it is dead ...
2004-11-13T13:13:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	it's there, but no response, it's been over 5 minutes
2004-11-13T13:13:00.000Z	mercurus	aratdagnir	try and start it from the desktop again ...
2004-11-13T13:14:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	ok:) whats the quick way of getting gcc?
2004-11-13T13:14:00.000Z	mercurus	aratdagnir	apt-get update && apt-get install gcc
2004-11-13T13:16:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	bad news again, it says method http died unexpectedly, and that was really unexpected :)
2004-11-13T13:16:00.000Z	mercurus	aratdagnir	indeed ... you used sudo right ?
2004-11-13T13:16:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	yep :) i'm root

2004-11-13T13:18:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	we're thinking of installing ubuntu to our friends at university, about 50-60 people who are new to linux but learning programming
2004-11-13T13:20:00.000Z	mercurus	aratdagnir	gcc is available. though I think it is part of the universe repository

2004-11-13T13:22:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	evolution doesnot like my $LANG variable, i've set it to C default, and it started :)
2004-11-13T13:22:00.000Z	mercurus	aratdagnir	what was it set to before ? have you got locales installed ?
2004-11-13T13:24:00.000Z	aratdagnir	mercurus	it's the live cd, but i've set it to Turkish, just to have the keyboard right
