2009-05-18T07:59:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		hello
2009-05-18T07:59:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		I got a problem with my ntfs drive
2009-05-18T08:00:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		It automounts in ubuntu fine
2009-05-18T08:00:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		but windows doesn't recognize it anymore
2009-05-18T08:01:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		the drive
2009-05-18T08:01:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		sorry I guess I should type it all at once
2009-05-18T08:01:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		my ntfs partition which mounts fine in ubuntu is no longer recognized in windows xp
2009-05-18T08:02:00.000Z	fornix	neuroelectronic	can you paste the output of $ sudo fdisk -l and $ blkid
2009-05-18T08:03:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		is that all one command fornix?
2009-05-18T08:03:00.000Z	fornix	neuroelectronic	no. two commands. pastebin it
2009-05-18T08:03:00.000Z	neuroelectronic		k
2009-05-18T08:06:00.000Z	neuroelectronic	fornix	there was no output for either of those commands, mount says the drive is /dev/sdb1 type fuseblk
2009-05-18T08:07:00.000Z	fornix	neuroelectronic	are you sure you typed $ sudo fdisl -l
2009-05-18T08:07:00.000Z	fornix	neuroelectronic	there should be a sudo. else there will be no output
2009-05-18T08:08:00.000Z	neuroelectronic	fornix	ok it's HPFS/NTFS
2009-05-18T08:09:00.000Z	neuroelectronic	fornix	like I said it mounts fine in ubuntu, read/write works but windows mounts it but doesn't recognize it as ntfs, single partition
2009-05-18T08:09:00.000Z	fornix	neuroelectronic	paste the entire output at http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2009-05-18T08:10:00.000Z	fornix	neuroelectronic	you mean windows doesn't recognize the drive? you dont see a drive letter?
