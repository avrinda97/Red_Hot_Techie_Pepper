2006-03-18T09:27:00.000Z	CarinArr	chuckyp	wrong person?
2006-10-23T12:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	not that hard atleast I don't consider it that hard.  but you will need a live cd or something to access your linux install.
2006-10-23T12:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	or the ubuntu live cd for that matter
2006-10-28T14:44:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	yes if you want to stay 32bit use linux-image-generic
2006-10-28T14:44:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	it will pick the appropriate kenrel for your cpu
2006-10-28T14:45:00.000Z	CarinArr	chuckyp	macd: thanks:)
2006-10-28T14:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	yeah tune2fs
2006-11-09T07:26:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	are you getting an error?
2006-11-09T07:26:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	possibly try aptitude   its better than apt-get atleast at handling dependencies.
2006-11-09T07:26:00.000Z	CarinArr	chuckyp	no, it just hangs, using edgy
2006-11-09T07:27:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	does it hang at the same place every time?
2006-11-09T07:27:00.000Z	CarinArr	chuckyp	sometimes it installs/uninstalls, but this is with lots of different packages.. not the same one
2006-11-09T07:31:00.000Z	CarinArr	chuckyp	aptitude hangs as well
2006-11-09T07:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	CarinArr	hrm... thats wierd
2006-11-09T07:33:00.000Z	CarinArr	chuckyp	it's not taking up cpu, just seems to be sat there waiting.. strace seems to show different things from one run to the next.. a lot of the time it hangs while waiting for whatever pid, the next it just says resource busy etc
