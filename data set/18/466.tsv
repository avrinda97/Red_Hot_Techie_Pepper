2012-04-24T20:19:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	Sorry,wrong paste. xD N: Unable to locate package gimp
2012-04-24T20:20:00.000Z	fidel_	Steevca	according to http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gimp&searchon=names&suite=oneiric&section=all there is a gim-package in 11.10. did you mess around with your sources?
2012-04-24T20:23:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	Can you copy-paste me the last one,chrome got all wierd on me.
2012-04-24T20:23:00.000Z	fidel_	Steevca	it was just a link to packakges.ubuntu.com
2012-04-24T20:23:00.000Z	fidel_	Steevca	it was just a link to packages.ubuntu.com
2012-04-24T20:25:00.000Z	fidel_	Steevca	then i dont get it - i was on 11.10myself until last week - and gimp was available thosedays for sure - and it still should according to thr packages-page
2012-04-24T20:25:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	Must be some problem with installation.
2012-04-24T20:27:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	I will try to find a new repos. for gimp,and add it and check then.
2012-04-24T20:28:00.000Z	fidel_	Steevca	there shouldnt be any reason to search new/additional repos. does apt work for any other packages?
2012-04-24T20:28:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	It does.
2012-04-24T20:35:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	Is there a way that i can get all the sources to defualt state?
2012-04-24T20:38:00.000Z	Steevca	fidel_	I found this http://pastebin.com/yhypPfA9
2012-05-07T16:23:00.000Z	fidel_	Steevca	i guess not using keyring in the first place is then the way to go
