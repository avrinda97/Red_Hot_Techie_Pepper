2006-03-13T11:03:00.000Z	lukey		are there any guides for installing an atheros wireless card in ubuntu using madwifi?
2006-03-13T11:04:00.000Z	lukey		kyral: during boot?
2006-03-13T11:05:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	my atheros card worked on its own
2006-03-13T11:05:00.000Z	lukey	frank23	did you just plug it in and it started working?  or did you have it connected during the ubuntu installation?
2006-03-13T11:06:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	I plugged and it started working
2006-03-13T11:06:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	I had to configure the network though. but the card itself worked imediately
2006-03-13T11:09:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	are you sure it has an atheros chipset?
2006-03-13T11:10:00.000Z	lukey	frank23	yes.. its a superg adapter.  in fact, during the ubuntu installation it was detected.  but once i finished the os installation, all that shows up is my wired adapter
2006-03-13T11:11:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	what happens if you try   sudo modprobe pci_ath
2006-03-13T11:12:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	I don't know if it should be the same module or not
2006-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	the network card? no not in xorg.conf
2006-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	do you have the linux-restricted-modules package for your kernel installed?  pci_ath should be found at least
2006-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	lukey	frank23	not sure
2006-03-13T11:16:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	kernel are you running?
2006-03-13T11:16:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	uname -a to get the kernel version
2006-03-13T11:17:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-386  to make sure its installed
2006-03-13T11:18:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	oh thats dapper
2006-03-13T11:18:00.000Z	frank23	lukey	maybe its not working in dapper right now I don't know
