2009-11-14T21:53:00.000Z	cads		hey, should I just update to karmic koala for fun?
2009-11-14T21:54:00.000Z	cads		is there a good chance it'll fuck things up :/
2009-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	cads		ah
2009-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	cads		well, we'll see
2009-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cads	Cloudy with a Chance of Fsckballs!
2009-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cads	You're better off doing a clean installation instead of upgrading, by the way.
2009-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	cads		thanks for the summation leaf-sheep :D
2009-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	cads		hah, I've been dying to burn ubuntu off this baby for a while
2009-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	cads		sorry jussi01, will do
2009-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cads	Any reason why? :\
2009-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	cads	leaf-sheep	it feels crufty and slow, like how a windows box would get
2009-11-14T21:57:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cads	What are you opting for?  Arch?  Gentoo? :o
2009-11-14T21:57:00.000Z	cads	leaf-sheep	except I do nothing but development and writing on this laptop... but it's always chugging and using the fan and junk
2009-11-14T21:58:00.000Z	cads	leaf-sheep	heh, I think I might try to get in on the dragonfly bsd development! :D
2009-11-14T21:58:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cads	Heh. Good idea.  Also, you always could start with package --> ubuntu-minimal.  Then build your way up with essential packages instead of using ubuntu-desktop metapackage . :)
2009-11-14T21:59:00.000Z	cads	leaf-sheep	it's true that ubuntu is comfy... maybe you're onto an idea
2009-11-14T22:00:00.000Z	leaf-sheep		!minimal | cads
2009-11-14T22:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cads	When you're done with ubuntu-minimal, you're stuck in a terminal! Install gdm and whatnot. :)
