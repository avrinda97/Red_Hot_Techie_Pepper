2007-10-21T00:35:00.000Z	Ashfire908		when i enable the desktop effects, all the window bars disappear
2007-10-21T00:36:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	I had that problem before...did the frames around your windows disappear?
2007-10-21T00:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	let me check
2007-10-21T00:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	yep. no window borders. effects were working before...
2007-10-21T00:38:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	the problem I had was when I enabled desktop effects, the minimize buttons and close buttons disappear
2007-10-21T00:38:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	I fixed it by reinstalling compiz
2007-10-21T00:39:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	sudo apt-get install compiz
2007-10-21T00:40:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	Then I ran sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-10-21T00:40:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	what package should i reinstall?
2007-10-21T00:40:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	compiz
2007-10-21T00:41:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	so everything?
2007-10-21T00:41:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	what do you mean?
2007-10-21T00:41:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	what does it say when you try sudo apt-get install compiz?
2007-10-21T00:42:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	i'm using synaptic, and it was already installed
2007-10-21T00:42:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	try the terminal
2007-10-21T00:43:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	 i can reinstall it myself
2007-10-21T00:44:00.000Z	secret901	Ashfire908	anyway, reinstalling compiz and ubuntu-desktop did the job for me...I didn't have to remove them first
2007-10-21T00:44:00.000Z	Ashfire908	secret901	what do you think i'm doing
