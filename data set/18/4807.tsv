2009-05-06T20:30:00.000Z	wasutton3		does anyone know why a freshly made raid array (without any partitions on it whatsoever) would return the error that it is in use by the system when i try to format it?
2009-05-06T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	has it synced ?
2009-05-06T20:30:00.000Z	wasutton3	ikonia	what do you mean? it should have, the bios reports that the array is healthy
2009-05-06T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	ooh it's fake raid
2009-05-06T20:31:00.000Z	wasutton3	ikonia	well it shows up in jaunty as a single drive
2009-05-06T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	yeah, but the raid technology is fake raid
2009-05-06T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	what is the /dev device name from it ?
2009-05-06T20:32:00.000Z	wasutton3	ikonia	ok so what do i do, i would like to set up a raid 0 array that will be accessable from both linux and windows
2009-05-06T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	wow, thats potentially very frustrating, but possible
2009-05-06T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	if you do "sudo fdisk -l /dev/mapper/nvidia_fddaeibi1" what dies it show ?
2009-05-06T20:33:00.000Z	wasutton3	ikonia	it says it doesnt contain a valid partition table
2009-05-06T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	which is fine because you've not put a partition on it
2009-05-06T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	what partition tool are you using to partition it ?
2010-02-05T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	google.com
2010-02-05T01:21:00.000Z	wasutton3	ikonia	, jellow: i get the following form that "From Serverbox (192.168.1.100) icmp_seq=1 Destination Port Unreachable"
2010-02-05T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	so you can't ping that host
2010-02-05T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	wasutton3	probabnly firewalls or routing
