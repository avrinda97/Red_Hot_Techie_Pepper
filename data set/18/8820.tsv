2007-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	kravlin		I get these errors. any idea why? (Currently running off a live cd.)
2007-06-21T13:23:00.000Z	kravlin		forget this. Ill just go into my install and backup from there.
2007-06-21T13:24:00.000Z	daftman	kravlin	what ar eyou trying to do?
2007-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	kravlin	daftman	Im trying to make a windows partition but currently ubuntu takes up my entire hard drive. I need to drop some space from it to make a partition for windows and a partition both can acess.
2007-06-21T13:26:00.000Z	daftman	kravlin	hmm so are you using gpart?
2007-06-21T13:27:00.000Z	kravlin	daftman	yeah. I don't know if its safe just to remove space from linux though. I know it wasn't for windows.
2007-06-21T13:34:00.000Z	kravlin	daftman	Do you know if it's safe to remove space from linux? Do i need to find a way to defrag my drive or anything before removing space?
2007-06-21T13:35:00.000Z	daftman	kravlin	you don't need to defrag your drive in linux
2007-06-21T13:35:00.000Z	kravlin	daftman	ok. so removing space shouldn't be an issue. Got it.
2007-06-21T13:35:00.000Z	daftman	kravlin	if you use gpart it should be safe to resize your disk
2007-06-21T13:36:00.000Z	daftman	kravlin	however, backup FIRST
2007-06-21T13:36:00.000Z	kravlin	daftman	I can't mount it at this time. Im not really worried about loosing anything either.
