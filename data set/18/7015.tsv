2009-02-04T08:35:00.000Z	xubuntu		hi all
2009-02-04T08:36:00.000Z	xubuntu		I have a question about network set up
2009-02-04T08:37:00.000Z	xubuntu		I would like to know if it's posible to do this : Set up my laptop to be a router itself and going through it before going outside ?
2009-02-04T08:37:00.000Z	xubuntu		I saw something about virtual interface but I don't know if it's the solution ?
2009-02-04T08:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> possibly, can you draw a layout of what you wanted?
2009-02-04T08:40:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	->  firefox would run on the laptop,  now can you take the effort to draw a picture to layout what you wanted?
2009-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	do not send me porn, its inappropiate to send me files i have not asked for
2009-02-04T08:52:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	you post it in pastebin for everyone to see
2009-02-04T08:54:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	or per crdlb
2009-02-04T09:04:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> ummm...what you wanted done?
2009-02-04T09:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> why are you trying to make it more difficult than necessary?  all can be served on same ip address
2009-02-04T09:24:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> to which hosts are you going to served it too?
2009-02-04T09:26:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> then a vm like vmware or vbox would fit
2009-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> even though it does not make sense, your clients for your dchp has to be serving 10.x.x.x.
2009-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> even though it does not make sense, your clients for your dchp has to be getting ip address of 10.x.x.x.
2009-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> again it does not make sense, why would you do such
2009-02-04T09:30:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	-> one thing i can tell you, your nic can have  multiple ip addresses at diff subnets
2009-02-04T09:32:00.000Z	n8tuser	xubuntu	you need to read up more on networking..
