2006-12-16T09:11:00.000Z	Tonren		OK guys, I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  It wrote something bogus to my swap partition. When I rebooted, it hung on Starting /scripts/pre-mount, so I popped in a live CD to check with gparted and my swap partition was no longer properly formatted.  I reformatted it as linux-swap but it's still not booting, and hanging in the same place.
2006-12-16T09:11:00.000Z	Tonren		Can anyone help out?  I'm desperate.
2006-12-16T09:12:00.000Z	Tonren		nonickWhat happened to you?
2006-12-16T09:12:00.000Z	nothlit	Tonren	you can delete the partition and recreate it
2006-12-16T09:13:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	The bogus info will still be there, though
2006-12-16T09:13:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Deleting the partition just removes the formatting info.  The data remains.  :\
2006-12-16T09:13:00.000Z	nothlit	Tonren	you can zero the partition
2006-12-16T09:13:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Can I do that from gparted?
2006-12-16T09:13:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Or a live CD, or from Windows?
2006-12-16T09:15:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Yeah, they can be weapons of mass destruction
2006-12-16T09:16:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Do the drives need to be MOUNTED for dd to be used?
2006-12-16T09:16:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Oh yeah; it CAN'T work if they're mounted
2007-01-19T12:29:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	"Use at your own risk."
2007-01-19T12:29:00.000Z	nothlit	Tonren	well of course its unsupported
2007-01-19T12:30:00.000Z	nothlit	Tonren	anyways, its pretty easy to just install everything using the apt system
2007-01-19T12:30:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Yeah, I'm sure it's all on ubuntuguide.org
2007-01-19T12:31:00.000Z	nothlit	Tonren	its on the community wiki, dunno about ubuntuguide
2007-01-19T12:31:00.000Z	Tonren	nothlit	Sweet.
