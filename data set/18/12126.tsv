2006-05-23T13:25:00.000Z	lawton		hi, can someone tell me if i need to define a swap partition in Breezy Badger?
2006-05-23T13:25:00.000Z	lawton		i'm using this guide: http://www.pcmech.com/show/os/903/ not sure if it is out of date
2006-05-23T13:26:00.000Z	lawton		hello?
2006-05-23T13:26:00.000Z	bimberi	lawton	it's usually a good idea, how much RAM do you have?
2006-05-23T13:26:00.000Z	lawton	bimberi	512 MB
2006-05-23T13:27:00.000Z	lawton	bimberi	i can't seem to figure out how to define a partition as swap according to the above guide, the options are different...
2006-05-23T13:28:00.000Z	lawton		can i just skip the swap partition for now?
2006-05-23T13:29:00.000Z	bimberi	lawton	the installer will create a swap partition by default
2006-05-23T13:29:00.000Z	lawton	bimberi	oh, so i just leave it some free space?
2006-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	lawton		is this guide accurate? http://www.pcmech.com/show/os/903/
2006-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	lawton		maybe i should find another guide
2006-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	bimberi	lawton	iirc it will offer to use the free space and create 2 partitions in it - one swap and one for /
2006-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	lawton	bimberi	oh yeah, it just did that :)
2006-05-23T13:31:00.000Z	lawton		hrm...
2006-05-23T13:31:00.000Z	bimberi	lawton	phew :)
2006-05-23T13:32:00.000Z	lawton	bimberi	indeed, i wonder why http://www.pcmech.com/show/os/903/ makes it so complicated
2006-05-23T13:33:00.000Z	bimberi	lawton	hm, it seems to be referring to a 2 drive setup
2006-05-23T13:35:00.000Z	lawton	bimberi	i think IDE1 master in that config is all windows... looks like 1 drive for linux, 1 for windows
