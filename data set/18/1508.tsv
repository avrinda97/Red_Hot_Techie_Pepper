2012-07-25T22:53:00.000Z	xomp	ThinkT510	can that be done via terminal? I do not use a DE currently.
2012-07-25T22:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	all those are terminal commands
2012-07-25T22:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	i'm using xchat too, comes out fine here
2012-07-25T22:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	yeah, thats what the bot pasted
2012-07-25T22:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	maybe a screenshot will help us to see what you see
2012-07-25T22:58:00.000Z	xomp	ThinkT510	good idea, http://i.imgur.com/iaxTV.png
2012-07-25T22:59:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	just type what is between the A>> things
2012-07-25T23:01:00.000Z	xomp	ThinkT510	thanks that seems to work, it was hard for me to discern where the command began and ended with all that uneccessary tet stuff
2012-07-25T23:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	no worries, those strange symbols were meant to come out as duoble arrows (indicating the command within)
2012-07-25T23:26:00.000Z	xomp	ThinkT510	the second half of that !clone output isn't working for me. I get "xargs: aptitude: No such file or directory" error
2012-07-25T23:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	this?: sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install
2012-07-25T23:27:00.000Z	xomp	ThinkT510	yep, that's the one
2012-07-25T23:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	hmm, sorry i can't help, i'm just aware of the factoid
2012-07-25T23:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	ah
2012-07-25T23:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	aptitude isn't installed by default anymore
2012-07-25T23:29:00.000Z	xomp	ThinkT510	does that mean I have to strangly do 'apt-get aptitude' ?
2012-07-25T23:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	xomp	you'd need to install that or translate those commands into apt-get equivilants
