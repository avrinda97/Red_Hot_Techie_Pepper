2005-10-28T09:39:00.000Z	azertyuuu		hey all , can anyone help me? I want to have Windows as default OS in Grub
2005-10-28T09:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	azertyuuu	 edit the grub.conf and change the 'default' # to be the entry of the windows ittem.
2005-10-28T09:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	azertyuuu	 just rember that grub starts numbering at 0   so the 3rd entry if its windows would be  #2

2005-10-28T09:45:00.000Z	dr_willis		the 'savedefault' may affect things. It normallyis used to let grub rember the last entry you set.
2005-10-28T09:46:00.000Z	dr_willis		cedega is getting very well done these days
2005-10-28T09:46:00.000Z	azertyuuu	dr_willis	would you like to look at #flood for a second
