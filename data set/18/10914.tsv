2006-12-08T13:17:00.000Z	kitche	rpc	if your wanting to know if lexmark works in linux chck out linuxprinting.org since some lexmark's are harder to get working
2007-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	kitche	rpc	you need to set it up as a cache server or as a mian server
2007-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	oh i see
2007-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	but does it take any special action, like registering it somewhere or anything like that?
2007-01-31T09:40:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	or can anyone have one up and running
2007-01-31T09:40:00.000Z	kitche	rpc	no just editing it's configuration
2007-01-31T09:40:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	oh wow
2007-01-31T09:40:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	i thought i would need to link it somewhere and that it would require some kind of permission
2007-01-31T09:41:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	and can i also make changes tru it? like editing pointers etc.
2007-01-31T09:42:00.000Z	kitche	rpc	well yes but why would you unless your running a domian with it
2007-01-31T09:42:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	oh i do, i have several domains
2007-01-31T09:43:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	and i would love to run my own dns to be able to edit stuff as needed as my service provider isn't really flexible with that
2007-01-31T09:43:00.000Z	rpc	kitche	just wondering if i make any sense with this or talking an absolute bull :)
