2011-04-08T00:14:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	why, what is the number now?
2011-04-08T00:15:00.000Z	gedO	ayecee	2033
2011-04-08T00:15:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	it's not critical, but yeah, that's a predictor of future problems.
2011-04-08T00:15:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	but mostly if the number goes up.
2011-04-08T00:16:00.000Z	gedO	ayecee	any softwsare to write 0 or 1 on thouse bad sectors?
2011-04-08T00:16:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	for what purpose?
2011-04-08T00:17:00.000Z	gedO	ayecee	to awoid for system use
2011-04-08T00:17:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	awoid?
2011-04-08T00:18:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	is your disk reporting bad sectors now, or are you just concerned about the reallocated sector count?
2011-04-08T00:18:00.000Z	gedO	ayecee	every time I boot S.M.A.R.T. tells me about thouse sectors
2011-04-08T00:19:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	they can't be fixed, but they're not causing a problem at the moment aside from the warning.
2011-04-08T00:19:00.000Z	ayecee	gedO	you can get rid of the warning only by replacing the disk
