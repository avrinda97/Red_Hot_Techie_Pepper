2006-07-19T14:36:00.000Z	elias_		beagle is supposed to start on F12 why is it not doing it?
2006-07-19T14:37:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	I have problems with Beagle. I would suggest 1) make sure it is running at login (System>Preferences>Session) and 2) Try setting it in the System>Preferences>Keyboard thingie for keyboard shortcuts
2006-07-19T14:39:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	the gnome key shortcut thing does not allow to define custom shortcuts. I can only redefine the ones in the list but not add anything!
2006-07-19T14:40:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	Surely F12 can be mapped to whatever command is used to launch the Beagle window?
2006-07-19T14:40:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	no!
2006-07-19T14:41:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	Hang on, I will try it myself
2006-07-19T14:47:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	OK, I admit defeat.
2006-07-19T14:47:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	Unfortunately!
2006-07-19T14:47:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	But at least you made me realise I had removed Beagle :)
2006-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	Something seems wrong with the beagle package.
2006-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	It does not find my emails either!
2006-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	I can't get it to give me results. I added indexing extensions to my filesystems and exercised the dog, but all I get for results is the occasional system file
2006-07-19T14:49:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	It used to work. It worked with kerry.
2006-07-19T14:49:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	It's never worked for me
2006-08-16T13:25:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	If you partition differently then you may have to change /etc/fstab
2006-08-16T13:26:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	all that kind of stuff I have not problem with!
2006-08-16T13:27:00.000Z	elias_	Warbo	I am just asking myself about the powermanagement, alsa and so forth.
2006-08-16T13:27:00.000Z	Warbo	elias_	ALSA would be OK I think. I have never used Ubuntu on a laptop so I don't know about power management
