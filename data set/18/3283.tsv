2010-11-14T02:29:00.000Z	shine1		Sorry to be annoying... Is there any way to remove the selection sort of shading of mounted folders? Anyone knows?
2010-11-14T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	how did you mount it?
2010-11-14T02:30:00.000Z	shine1	guntbert	i just did  "sudo mount  folder_1  folder_2"
2010-11-14T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	didn't you say something about remote?
2010-11-14T02:33:00.000Z	shine1	guntbert	I did more experiments and found that it actually happens when one makes softlinks of folders as well
2010-11-14T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	looking
2010-11-14T02:37:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	http://imagebin.org/123109    one is a soft link to the other  -- no "shading" here
2010-11-14T02:44:00.000Z	shine1	guntbert	 see http://imagebin.org/123110 , I have the shading ...
2010-11-14T02:46:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	ah, you are in a terminal?
2010-11-14T02:47:00.000Z	shine1	guntbert	 yes, I am in a terminal
2010-11-14T02:48:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	by default ls uses colors to distinguish file types
2010-11-14T02:49:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	man ls will tell you how to change that
2010-11-14T02:50:00.000Z	shine1	guntbert	 I agree that it makes sense to distinguish folder types this way, I was hoping there is a way to turn this off, looks really annoying to me when I have lots of sub-folders under a folder
2010-11-14T02:51:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	ls --color=never
2010-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	shine1	guntbert	, thanks, i was hoping to only turn off the shading, not all the coloring .. but thanks for your help any way
2010-11-14T02:55:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	I'm certain that you can with dircolors
2010-11-14T02:55:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	I'm certain that you can change it with dircolors
2010-11-14T03:35:00.000Z	guntbert	shine1	glad you worked it out :-)  congrats
