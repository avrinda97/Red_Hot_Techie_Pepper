2009-12-22T12:09:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	what do you mean by letting vista resize itself?
2009-12-22T12:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	it has a built in tool, so it can re size itself
2009-12-22T12:09:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	ah yes...
2009-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	which they should use to re size it
2009-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	I have windows 7, and I've never seen that tool...
2009-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	calling Windows 7 "Vista version 2", is like calling Ubuntu "Debian version 2"... for one, it's completely inaccurate to say, and second it would just get you laughed at by anyone who knows how to use windows.
2009-12-22T12:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	well it's known as NT 6.1  with VIsta known as  6.0  which confirms it :)  also it's a little joke  the Vista version 2 thing
2009-12-22T12:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	I expect they are both rather similar under the hood
2009-12-22T12:17:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	under the hood, they still both use the NT kernel, but the Vista OS was supremely subpar to XP Pro, and Windows 7 is a VAST improvement over both.
2009-12-22T12:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	I don't really care that much to be honest :)  Microsoft lock people in, and hold computing back,  but this is all off topic now
2009-12-22T12:19:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	true... I didn't come here to debate which Windows version is the best...
2009-12-22T12:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	same here
2009-12-22T12:21:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	stop spelling my name wrong. =P
2009-12-22T12:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	no it's a messed up auto complete
2009-12-22T12:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	KDE 4 is more Windows looking, but I am not sure about recommending that much to new users.
2009-12-22T12:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	yeah indeed, Gnome is rather easy to use
2009-12-22T12:35:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	sebsebseb	back to the google issue.... it's a netbook, there's no way I'm running a virtual box or VMWare session on it...
2009-12-22T12:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	phoenixzorn	come join :)  and  andrew_46 and anyone else that was part of it
