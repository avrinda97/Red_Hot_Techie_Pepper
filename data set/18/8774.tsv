2007-06-27T05:56:00.000Z	Taivo		hi guys, any information where I could find suggestions for Ubuntu-friendly hardware configurations?
2007-06-27T05:56:00.000Z	Taivo		I'm about to build a small samba server, based on RAID-1 and the usual desktop PC architecture
2007-06-27T05:56:00.000Z	mike	Taivo	what hardware?
2007-06-27T05:57:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	I was asking you guys :)
2007-06-27T05:57:00.000Z	Taivo		what's good with Ubuntu, supported mainboards, chipsets, etc.
2007-06-27T05:57:00.000Z	Taivo		RAID controller will probably be some 3ware
2007-06-27T05:57:00.000Z	mike	Taivo	Run live cd
2007-06-27T05:58:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	the thing is, I don't have the hardware bought yet
2007-06-27T05:58:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	gotta, figure out first, what's good and reliable with Ubuntu
2007-06-27T05:58:00.000Z	mike	Taivo	Nvidia is well supported
2007-06-27T05:59:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	thanks, nvidia should be good under Linux, although things such as graphics and sound cards are not that important as it will be a server anyway
2007-06-27T05:59:00.000Z	mike		ok I see
2007-06-27T05:59:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	any idea if Ubuntu likes Intel platform more than AMD + nVidia chipset?
2007-06-27T06:00:00.000Z	mike	Taivo	i have found support for both amd amd pentium excellent
2007-06-27T06:00:00.000Z	mike	Taivo	Pentium especially
2007-06-27T06:01:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	so, some Core 2 Duo processor with Intel mainboard should work fine?
2007-06-27T06:02:00.000Z	mike	Taivo	I like Gigabyte and Asus mainboards
2007-06-27T06:02:00.000Z	Taivo	mike	yeah they are good too, but thanks man, I think that settles it
