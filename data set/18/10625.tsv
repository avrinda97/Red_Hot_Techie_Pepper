2006-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	Poser		I have a quick question about ubuntu packages if anyone has a momment?
2006-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	Poser		XD
2006-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	Poser		Okay, so basically, this is it
2006-11-18T12:36:00.000Z	Poser		I want to remove some packages, but Add/Remove won't lwet me.
2006-11-18T12:36:00.000Z	Poser		so, I go to Synaptic.
2006-11-18T12:36:00.000Z	Poser		I want to remove stuff like Ekiga, Evolution, etc.
2006-11-18T12:36:00.000Z	Poser		but sometimes, it ays it's going to also remove the packed "Ubuntu Desktop" and I have no idea what that is. :(
2006-11-18T12:37:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Poser	ubuntu desktop is an empty package which depends on everything a standard ubuntu install has, so if you want to reinstall a standard ubuntu you only need to install one package. It can be safely removed.
2006-11-18T12:38:00.000Z	Poser	ArrenLex	So, I can uninstall things like Ekiga, and Evolution? Cool. But I also run into dependenciy issues. I don't need the openoffice database app, but it won't let me uninstall it unless I get rid of the whole suite. :(
2006-11-18T12:38:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Poser	This is probably because some other component of openoffice depends on -base.
2006-11-18T12:39:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Poser	I have the same problem with draw: I can't remove draw without removing impress.
2006-11-18T12:40:00.000Z	Poser	ArrenLex	they need to work on the dependencies. Power users won't want to keep using ubuntu if they are forced to keep packages they don't want. The kind of "You need this even tho you never use it" is far too much a windows/mac ideaology and doesen't belong in Ubuntu. :(
2006-11-18T12:41:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Poser	nono. If some component of openoffice depends on -base, chances are it actually NEEDS -base to run.
2006-11-18T12:42:00.000Z	Poser	ArrenLex	But why do I need to uninstall the -Base to get rid of a PART
2006-11-18T12:42:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Poser	Hold on, what are you trying to remove?
2006-11-18T12:43:00.000Z	Poser	ArrenLex	Stuff like Evolution Mail, Ekiga, OpenOffice Database.
2006-11-18T12:43:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Poser	and what happens when you type "apt-get remove openoffice.org-base"?
2006-11-18T12:44:00.000Z	Poser	ArrenLex	 I haven't tried that. I've been trying to do it all through Synaptic.
