2005-11-26T15:27:00.000Z	Corrupter		what is file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
2005-11-26T15:28:00.000Z	Corrupter		well it won't let ME install anything
2005-11-26T15:28:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	it prevents you from running two apt instances simultaneously
2005-11-26T15:35:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	with ps
2005-11-26T15:37:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	if no apt, synaptic, aptitude, or dpkg processes are running, the lock file is there as a result of an error, and you can remove it
2005-11-26T15:39:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	yep, you need to use sudo for such commands
2005-11-26T15:40:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	heh, nobody ever thinks about the simplest explanation :)
2005-11-26T15:43:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	well, i think wajig is one of the must-have admin tools. also, learn to use grep
2005-11-26T15:43:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	use man on those commands. man sccreen, man grep etc. they have descriptions at the very top of the page
2005-11-26T15:45:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	sooner or later you'll end up running several terminals anyway :)
2005-11-26T16:05:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	it's enough to restart the panel
2005-11-26T16:06:00.000Z	Corrupter	topyli	huh?
2005-11-26T16:06:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	killall gnome-panel. it will respawn and the menu will be up to date
2005-11-28T14:12:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	it's true that dos experience makes it more difficult to realize the power of a real shell
2005-11-28T14:32:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	you would be gnomeless
2005-11-28T14:36:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	gnome is a metapackage, depending on a whole lot of gnome packages. if you remove it, you save 0 bits
2005-11-28T14:41:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	if you tell apt to install gnome, it will install it. why are you complaining? if you have packages you don't want, remove them
2005-11-28T14:42:00.000Z	topyli	Corrupter	use /msg or /query. after asking for permission
