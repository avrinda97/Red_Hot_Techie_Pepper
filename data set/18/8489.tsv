2008-01-05T12:38:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	if you're in need of booting to something, try XP recovery console or Super GRUB CD
2008-01-05T12:38:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	fixmbr at XP recovery console so you can boot to something
2008-01-05T12:39:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	pop in your XP CD, at the installation screen, press R, then C
2008-01-05T12:39:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	when you reach the temrinal, fixmbr
2008-01-05T12:39:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	then reboot
2008-01-05T12:39:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	that should get you back the ability to boot to P
2008-01-05T12:40:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	you may try the Super GRUB CD
2008-01-05T12:40:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	works off of a CD and USB I believe
2008-01-05T12:42:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	the Super GRUB CD is a CD that lets you restore bootability and lets you boot an arbitrary partition
2008-01-05T12:42:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	and configure in what way?
2008-01-05T12:43:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	if your BIOS isn't recognizing your HDD, how do you have it hooked up?
2008-01-05T12:44:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	hmm
2008-01-05T12:45:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	does your BIOS detect your new HDD at all?
2008-01-05T12:47:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	perhaps you should check your BIOS settings in regards to SATA
2008-01-05T12:48:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	if the BIOS cannot see your device, I believe GRUB will not be able to either
2008-01-05T12:48:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	other than that, I unfortunately do not know too much with regards to your issue :(
2008-01-05T12:48:00.000Z	scguy318	nshuman	because Linux initializes devices independently of the BIOS
