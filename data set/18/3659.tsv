2009-08-24T19:25:00.000Z	RS_Asleep		Hello :)
2009-08-24T19:27:00.000Z	RS_Asleep		Is there anyone using CUPS on an ubuntu server who would be able to help me out please? :)
2009-08-24T19:29:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	what kind of help do you need?
2009-08-24T20:15:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	if you go to CUPS ( http://localhost:631 ) what does it say?
2009-08-24T20:16:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	usb or lpt connection?
2009-08-24T20:16:00.000Z	RS_Asleep	Halitech	lpt (parallel port)
2009-08-24T20:20:00.000Z	RS_Asleep	Halitech	I'm running CUPS with a Samsung parallel port printer on Ubuntu and sharing it with a Windows XP machine (with the XP machine using the MS Publisher ImageSetter driver). Thing is, it seems to be taking ages to print and that it's spending a lot of time "processing". For example I've just sent a 4 page Open Office Calc sheet to it with a size of 204K and it's been going now 40 minutes.
2009-08-24T20:21:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	what about printing from the machine with the printer installed? how does that work?
2009-08-24T20:22:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	so printing locally is fine and only has an issue printing from a networked machine
2009-08-24T20:23:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	no, since you installed it on the linux box
2009-08-24T20:24:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	also, is there any adapters being used in the cabling?
2009-08-24T20:26:00.000Z	RS_Asleep	Halitech	I have an extension cable, but without it, still the same. It will print documents, it's just very slow between me sending it and it printing it.
2009-08-24T20:27:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	ok, just wondering if there was an adapter as I haven't seen many machines with an lpt port lately
2009-08-24T20:28:00.000Z	RS_Asleep	Halitech	It's a VIA C3 cpu with onboard parallel port :)
2009-08-24T20:28:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	ok :)
2009-08-24T20:28:00.000Z	RS_Asleep	Halitech	I've also just got the linux box to print a test page and it took about 30 seconds before it started to print :)
2009-08-24T20:29:00.000Z	Halitech	RS_Asleep	so local printing is fine, something to do with the sharing, the network or the way you installed the driver on windows :) ( I know, narrows it down alot ;) )
2009-08-24T20:30:00.000Z	RS_Asleep	Halitech	While the file is obviously getting there cos pritning on Windows takes seconds. I'm assuming either state processing is the linux box converting the file into something it can use or the sending of the into the printer :/
