2010-01-31T05:52:00.000Z	narretgrez		can some of the server wizards here relate where to add commands that you want to start up when the server is rebooted?
2010-01-31T05:53:00.000Z	narretgrez		like /etc/init.d/nginx start
2010-01-31T05:53:00.000Z	narretgrez		is there a file somewhere?
2010-01-31T05:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	narretgrez	nginx should start with the system
2010-01-31T05:53:00.000Z	narretgrez	erUSUL	i set it up with passenger, so it doesn't autostart
2010-01-31T05:54:00.000Z	narretgrez		there must be a startup file somewhere?
2010-01-31T05:54:00.000Z	narretgrez		where i can just insert one line or other lines?
2010-01-31T05:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	narretgrez	but you have a init.d file for it? just do « sudo update-rc.d nginx defaults »
2010-01-31T05:55:00.000Z	narretgrez	erUSUL	yes i do
2010-01-31T05:55:00.000Z	narretgrez		ahh ok
2010-01-31T05:55:00.000Z	narretgrez	erUSUL	ohh ok that worked, thanks
2010-01-31T05:55:00.000Z	narretgrez	erUSUL	how about non init.d stuff?
2010-01-31T05:55:00.000Z	narretgrez		like a "php-fpm start" command
2010-01-31T05:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	narretgrez	call it from /etc/rc.local ? make an init script? it depends on what type of stuff
2010-01-31T05:56:00.000Z	narretgrez	erUSUL	is rc.local just a list of commands that will be called upon startup?
2010-01-31T05:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	narretgrez	yes is a bash script so it can be more complex than just a list of commands
2010-01-31T05:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	narretgrez	but it can be just that of course
2010-01-31T05:57:00.000Z	narretgrez	erUSUL	ok thank you!
