2005-06-15T13:48:00.000Z	hondje		and next time, make sure /home is on its own parititon
2005-06-15T13:50:00.000Z	hondje		btw, if that kernel bug was amd64 only, why did ubuntu push a kernel my way this morning?
2005-06-15T13:51:00.000Z	hondje		You'd think, in a logical world, that people coming to linux from windows would have it in their heads to make backups

2005-06-15T13:55:00.000Z	bpuccio	hondje	there's another fix right below that, discovered by Chris Wright pertaining to mmap
2005-06-15T13:56:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	oh, I should read more :-D Thannks!!
2005-06-17T15:31:00.000Z	bpuccio	hondje	do you run a hula server?  right now I'm on postfix/courier and while it is nice, hula looks neat and I'd like to try it out
2005-06-17T15:31:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	yes, I set it up the other day
2005-06-17T15:33:00.000Z	bpuccio	hondje	nice, did it go smoothly?  did you follow the instuctions here: http://hula-project.org/Installation_Ubuntu
2005-06-17T15:34:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	Yes, it build without errors, maybe one or two warnings, only thing missing was the default passwd, hdd to dig around for that
2005-06-17T15:35:00.000Z	bpuccio	hondje	awesome, I think I'll migrate tonight then, if it Just Works(tm) I'll give it a shot, I really don't want to replace a working just fine soltuion with something that will have me pulling my hair out
2005-06-17T15:35:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	the Novell HulaAdmin thing was ugly and clunky, very ahrd to grok for a guy like me, but the rest was a breeze
2005-06-17T15:36:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	you can set it to use your mailserver, etc
2005-06-17T15:36:00.000Z	bpuccio	hondje	eh, I'd like to try theirs, make it an all in one sort of thing... I ran qmail for 2 years and now ran postfix for another year or so, figure I'm due for another MTA
2005-06-17T15:36:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	basically just add the groupware voodoo on top of your existing setup
2005-06-17T15:37:00.000Z	bpuccio	hondje	ok, sounds cool, thanks for the information
2005-06-17T15:37:00.000Z	hondje	bpuccio	no problem, good luck
