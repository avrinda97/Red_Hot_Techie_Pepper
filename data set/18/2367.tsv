2010-06-06T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	 you need to read up on bash and various shell commands to do 'everything on console'
2010-06-06T20:36:00.000Z	mwen	Dr_Willis	i got 2 computer running Windows and 2 others running ubuntu 10.4, i can see window computer, but not ubuntu
2010-06-06T20:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	 you   are refering to seeing ;shared' directories? You did install samba on the linxu box and set uo some shares?
2010-06-06T20:38:00.000Z	mwen	Dr_Willis	no. network. i see windows network.
2010-06-06T20:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	 see if the machines can 'ping' each other. If so then they are networked and 'seeing' each other.
2010-06-06T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	 you mauy also want to install putty and winscp on the windows box's and ssh server on the linux machines so you can transfer stuff about  without messing with samba and 'shares'
2010-06-06T20:43:00.000Z	mwen	Dr_Willis	when i type : ping jeudy-desktop. R: unkown host...
2010-06-06T20:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	 use the IP# not hostname
2010-06-06T20:44:00.000Z	mwen	Dr_Willis	how can i get it?
2010-06-06T20:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	 look on the machines and use the ipconfig or ifconfig commands.
2010-06-16T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mwen	  theres always rebooting. :)
