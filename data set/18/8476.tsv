2008-02-04T01:52:00.000Z	pvl1	ampex	tremulous, warsow, openarena, alienarena. the only problem is the opengl
2008-02-04T01:52:00.000Z	ampex	pvl1	what sort of video card?
2008-02-04T01:53:00.000Z	pvl1	ampex	ati readon 2600
2008-02-04T01:53:00.000Z	ampex	pvl1	ati cards and linux seem to be rather problematic
2008-02-04T01:53:00.000Z	ampex	pvl1	what driver are you using?
2008-02-04T01:53:00.000Z	pvl1	ampex	i used envy. dunno
2008-02-04T01:54:00.000Z	ampex	pvl1	I don't always trust envy to do "the right thing"
2008-02-04T01:54:00.000Z	ampex	pvl1	I would try installing the latest ati drivers manually and even then you may not have the best of luck, ati's drivers really "suck"
2008-02-04T01:54:00.000Z	pvl1	ampex	aw damn.
