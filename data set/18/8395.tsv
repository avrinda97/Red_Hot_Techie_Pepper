2011-08-27T23:24:00.000Z	nikolaj		Hi, have any one, had this problem when they installed rail in linux with gem: Installing ri documentation for rails-3.0.10...file 'lib' not found?
2011-08-27T23:25:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	Which excat package did you apt-get install?
2011-08-27T23:26:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	I used gem, because apt didn't have the updated version of rails
2011-08-27T23:27:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	Ah.  And now it's complaining ri isn't there?
2011-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	Wait. This is your first gem install on this box, right?
2011-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	yes, and it will not work proberly without it
2011-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	no, is
2011-08-27T23:28:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	yes- sorry
2011-08-27T23:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	You need to install the dev ruby packages, and build-essentials, otherwise only the simplest of gems will install properly.
2011-08-27T23:30:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	can I do it with apt or should I use gem
2011-08-27T23:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	It needs to be apt, not gem, because it needs the header files and stuff
2011-08-27T23:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	And probably apt-get install ri, just in case you dont' have that either :)
2011-08-27T23:32:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	After you have ruby-dev (or ruby1.9.1-dev), and build-essential, and ri installed, then you can install all your other ruby libraries with gem.
2011-08-27T23:33:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	I'll try
2011-08-27T23:44:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	I have installed the packages as you say but it's still the same
2011-08-27T23:45:00.000Z	Kyle__	nikolaj	Check the ruby channel, I may be missing a step, but I had similar issues the first time I installed a gem on ubuntu.
2011-08-27T23:46:00.000Z	nikolaj	Kyle__	I will do
