2011-12-16T14:18:00.000Z	thomassen		Hi, How can I run shell script on command line without going to that particular folder?
2011-12-16T14:18:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	you mean a selfwritten shellscript?
2011-12-16T14:20:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	no, mint is not supported here
2011-12-16T14:20:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	No I have downloaded the script. Its actually smartgit. It contains a shell script to run the software. I dont want to go to the downloaded folder and run ./smartgit.sh
2011-12-16T14:21:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	you can create ~/bin  put it there and then you can use smartgit.sh
2011-12-16T14:21:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	without the path
2011-12-16T14:21:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	make it also executable with chmod +x filename
2011-12-16T14:26:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	I have created the bin in my home like you mentioned made a symbolic link to the download smartgit.sh file. But its not working. I have given permission to 777
2011-12-16T14:26:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	never use 777
2011-12-16T14:27:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	what is the output of "echo $PATH"
2011-12-16T14:27:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	  smartgit: command not found
2011-12-16T14:27:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	smartgit.sh you mentioned
2011-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	$path gives /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
2011-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	hm i thought ~/bin is always in PATH too
2011-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	so i put the link in /usr/local/sbin?
2011-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	:-D .. I am naive, please excuse
2011-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	iceroot	thomassen	/usr/local/bin or any other dir from that or at ~/bin to PATH
2011-12-16T14:31:00.000Z	thomassen	iceroot	it worked!! Thank you  :-)
