2010-08-02T19:22:00.000Z	Daniel____		can anyone help me with my problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9668826
2010-08-02T19:22:00.000Z	Daniel____		I'm getting these big [  xxx.xxxxxx] ata1.00: status: { DRDY ERR } errors
2010-08-02T19:24:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	I would start looking for a new hard drive.. I don't think those errors are due to file system errors
2010-08-02T19:25:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	I assume you've tried the regular things.. ie shutting down the system, letting it cool off and such.. running fsck from a live cd, making sure motherboard is ok, power supply and such
2010-08-02T19:25:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	Really?  Its been working fine for several months, and brand new
2010-08-02T19:26:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	I've done the stuff up to fsck from a live CD, it gave a "/bin/sh: fsck: not found" when I used the "Ubuntu Server 10.4 Install CD"
2010-08-02T19:26:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	you could also try a clean install .. see if the errors appear again
2010-08-02T19:27:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	you could also have a look at the s.m.a.r.t info .. see if it tells you anything
2010-08-02T19:27:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	I don't know how to check the motherboard/power supply
2010-08-02T19:28:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	I'll try the smart thing
2010-08-02T19:28:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	if you run from a live cd there is a neat little utility to see the smart info.. system, administration, disk utility I think
2010-08-02T19:28:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	from that utility you can run some extra tests.. those take anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours to run.. but it's a good way to test the drive
2010-08-02T19:29:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	I don't really want to try to do a complete reinstall as the errors could just start up again - I don't know what's caused them
2010-08-02T19:29:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	where should I get a live CD from? (iso)
2010-08-02T19:29:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	then give the sm.a.r.t utility a try.. hang on.. let me find the url for you
2010-08-02T19:29:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
2010-08-02T19:38:00.000Z	Daniel____	Slart	currently "smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda", will update after its completed
2010-08-02T19:39:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel____	ah.. that's the one
