2006-07-26T15:38:00.000Z	JDStone		I'm having issues installing Ubuntu on a very new system with very new hardware.  I've tried Ubuntu server and Ubuntu Desktop, both give me kernel errors.
2006-07-26T15:38:00.000Z	JDStone		any ideas?
2006-07-26T15:39:00.000Z	JDStone		lol
2006-07-26T15:39:00.000Z	JDStone		good one sebsebseb
2006-07-26T15:41:00.000Z	JDStone		debian installed fine
2006-07-26T15:42:00.000Z	JDStone		I don't want to use debian, this is a mythtv box and there are no mythtv packages for debian
2006-07-26T15:42:00.000Z	JDStone		yeah, right, no way
2006-07-26T15:42:00.000Z	JDStone		thanks wildman.  i'm just a little upset
2006-07-26T15:43:00.000Z	JDStone		I can't even return the mobo and cpu
2006-07-26T15:43:00.000Z	stefg	JDStone	so what happems _exactly_ ?
2006-07-26T15:44:00.000Z	JDStone	stefg	when it partitions the hdd or installs packages, it spits out kernel errors
2006-07-26T15:45:00.000Z	stefg	JDStone	which CD are/were you using? desktop or alternate
2006-07-26T15:46:00.000Z	JDStone	stefg	server 6.06
2006-07-26T15:47:00.000Z	stefg	JDStone	so i'll assume the 64bit flavour?
2006-07-26T15:47:00.000Z	JDStone	stefg	no, I'm using x86
2006-07-26T15:49:00.000Z	stefg	JDStone	hmmm... seems then that the kernel really has its difficulties with that hardware. If you feel adventurous you could test Edgy knot1, which has 2.6.17 to see if it changes something (#ubuntu+1 should have a link)
2006-07-26T15:50:00.000Z	JDStone	stefg	what kernel does 6.06 use?
2006-07-26T15:50:00.000Z	stefg	JDStone	2.6.15
