2008-08-19T22:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	read the gpl docs online
2008-08-19T22:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	it's very simple to do
2008-08-19T22:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	the question of usability is up to you.. do you want it to be usable or not?
2008-08-19T22:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	does who accept them?  if you want it open source you will have to provide the source of course
2008-08-19T22:51:00.000Z	onthefence928	lesshaste	it's usuable, it's just all console-based, so there's no windows or drop boxes or anything
2008-08-19T22:51:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	ok.. this is not a technical question really :) it's up to you
2008-08-19T22:53:00.000Z	onthefence928	lesshaste	ok i'm gonna go back to tweaking it so it's a bit more noob-proof add some author info to the file and create a read-me, then i'll look up that GPL license stuff, i really just wanted to knmow if teher were any language-feature requirements
2008-08-19T22:53:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	no language feature requirements.. you just have to provide the source basically
2008-08-19T22:53:00.000Z	onthefence928	lesshaste	cool, where do you think i should post it to make it available?
2008-08-19T22:54:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	there are many licenses of course.. if you don't want to provide the source you can pick another one :)
2008-08-19T22:54:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	 on your web page?
2008-08-19T22:54:00.000Z	onthefence928	lesshaste	i'm all for open-source so i'll  go open-source
2008-08-19T22:54:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	and then announce it somewhere like freshmeat ?
2008-08-19T22:54:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	or if lots of people will work on it you can use sourceforge
2008-08-19T22:55:00.000Z	onthefence928	lesshaste	i don't have a webpage or blog, never felt like keeping up a webpage and never felt i had anything to say that's interesting enough for a blog
2008-08-19T22:56:00.000Z	onthefence928	lesshaste	and it's a small one-man project really
2008-08-19T22:56:00.000Z	lesshaste	onthefence928	sure
