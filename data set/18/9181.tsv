2008-10-14T20:27:00.000Z	scientes		honestly if your a serious gamer run linux in a vm under windows
2008-10-14T20:28:00.000Z	scientes		idk, it seems that even when grub has its files locally it doesnt like to work when you move the drive around
2008-10-14T20:28:00.000Z	scientes		like master/slave to another machine, on a differnt card etc
2008-10-14T20:28:00.000Z	scientes		it breaks grub
2008-10-14T20:30:00.000Z	scientes		well when my harddrive goes bad i do it
2008-10-14T20:30:00.000Z	scientes		and also i had trouble with drivers in windows for my IDE/PCI card
2008-10-14T20:31:00.000Z	scientes		it sould work even if moved, esp if the refrenced partition ins on the same gd drive
2008-10-14T20:32:00.000Z	scientes		hmm live cd isnt liking my partition
