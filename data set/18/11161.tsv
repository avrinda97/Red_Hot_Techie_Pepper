2006-09-05T14:22:00.000Z	Genscher		morning !
2006-09-05T14:22:00.000Z	Genscher		a good day to install ubuntu 6.06 on my friend laptop ;)
2006-09-05T14:22:00.000Z	Genscher		any special things i should know about?
2006-09-05T14:23:00.000Z	Genscher		ok, so back to my question...
2006-09-05T14:24:00.000Z	Genscher		any special things i should know about when installing ubuntu on a AMD XP-M laptop?
2006-09-05T14:24:00.000Z	Genscher		(energy amangement,..)
2006-09-05T14:24:00.000Z	Genscher		*management
2006-09-05T14:24:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	Just add the battery applet to the panel once it is installed... nothing more
2006-09-05T14:25:00.000Z	Genscher	gbrent	i see a batterie on the top right, so that seems to work :) is fan-management also working? i read some posts in the ubuntuforum that the fan doesn't startet on some computers...
2006-09-05T14:27:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	the fan depends on the mother board... how its plugged in
2006-09-05T14:27:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	or if the mother board records its speed
2006-09-05T14:28:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	Laptop fans kick on and off when temperatures change to save on battery power
2006-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	Genscher	gbrent	it's running since i startet the laptop i think. i didn't hear another fan. is there some script or application to check fan-status? (laptop is 2-3 years old so the chipset - SiS i think - might be supported :)
2006-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	well I never got my fan reporting to work right, although i did not try very hard
2006-09-05T14:32:00.000Z	Genscher	gbrent	where could i check fans?
2006-09-05T14:32:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	you want to add an applet to see if the fan reports its speed?
2006-09-05T14:34:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	right click panel> add applet > those are the default applets
2006-09-05T14:34:00.000Z	gbrent	Genscher	I don't see one for the fan though
