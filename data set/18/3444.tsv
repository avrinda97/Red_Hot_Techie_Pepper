2012-01-06T14:32:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	The DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) option lets you set a single computer on your network outside of the router. If you have a computer that cannot run Internet applications successfully from behind the router, then you can place the computer into the DMZ for unrestricted Internet access.
2012-01-06T14:33:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	what do you want to do ? cause i was not here since you started to ask questions
2012-01-06T14:34:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	hm...
2012-01-06T14:34:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	you can use DMZ to see if it's because of the router you cannot access the internet
2012-01-06T14:35:00.000Z	afidegnum	DoctorD	the router can access the internet, only additional applications are not working
2012-01-06T14:35:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	Ok..you must make port forwarding
2012-01-06T14:36:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	you must have an option there somewhere where you put your PC's IP and PORT (fillezilla stands for 21, so your IP is, let's say 192.168.1.100, and your port 21)
2012-01-06T14:38:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	a screenshot of the port mapping page it will be nice..as i don't know what's there because i didn't have this kind of router before
2012-01-06T14:39:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	- uhm..isn't what i was expecting...
2012-01-06T14:41:00.000Z	DoctorD	afidegnum	don't you have a link called virtual server or port forwarding ?
