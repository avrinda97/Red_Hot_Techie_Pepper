2009-06-08T06:12:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	what did you use to install the package?
2009-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	I believe it was through the Synaptic Package manager, but it was a while back...
2009-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	do you know what the program is called?
2009-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	Avant-Window-Manager
2009-06-08T06:17:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	i meant Avant-Window-Navigator, sorry
2009-06-08T06:17:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	right now im just removing everything through the Package Manager and reinstalling to see what happens
2009-06-08T06:18:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	open up synaptic, search for "avant" select "avant-window-navigator" and right-click it. From the contextual menu, select "mark for complete removal"
2009-06-08T06:19:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	Oh, and click "Apply" when you've got all that done. That help?
2009-06-08T06:24:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	uninstalled and installed, but still no change
2009-06-08T06:26:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	yeah, the tray thing only shows applets that were added.  It is supposed to also a little icon when a program is opened, but it doesn't do that anymore
2009-06-08T06:28:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	has an update been released for avant-window-navigator?
2009-06-08T06:31:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	not sure, this problem is actually a bit old for me.   I haven't used Ubuntu in while, because of this and another problem (which was fixed when i discovered XChat)
2009-06-08T06:31:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	but anyway...im not sure
2009-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	it looks like synaptic is a build behind on awn. If you want to get the newest build and see if it fixes your problem, you need to uninstall it, go to https://launchpad.net/awn and d/l the files to install it yourself.
2009-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	I'll try it, but i wont like it
2009-06-08T06:44:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	yeah, sorry. It's the next step in diagnosing it, though, right?
2009-06-08T07:02:00.000Z	pppiano	OvernightPR	thanks for all your help, although this problem is not yet solved, i'll keep looking
2009-06-08T07:03:00.000Z	OvernightPR	pppiano	sorry that didn't help.
