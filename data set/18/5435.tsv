2008-10-27T05:38:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	he installed linux-restricted-modules
2008-10-27T05:38:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	that does not install graphics drivers
2008-10-27T05:39:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	according to the description of the package it does
2008-10-27T05:39:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	nm. i read "ubuntu-restricted-extras"
2008-10-27T05:51:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	there are 'the object code uses the full instruction set of the cpu it runs on if I have compiled it correctly' rights
2008-10-27T05:52:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	packages from repos do the same thing.
2008-10-27T05:52:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	are you telling me that if I have a core 2 chip then the packages in the repos will be optimized for a core 2 chip
2008-10-27T05:52:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	this is why there are separate repos for i386 and x86_64 and PPC and Sparc and ...
2008-10-27T05:53:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	note that I said core 2 and not "generic x86_64"
2008-10-27T05:53:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	are you telling me that the Core chips expand upon the i386 instruction set in ways that are not compliant with the i386 instruction set?
2008-10-27T05:53:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	same for x86_64
2008-10-27T05:54:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	plain and simple. *any* performance gains in terms of time spent will be more than made up for over the life of the package as the compile process.
2008-10-27T05:55:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	that may be the case for general use but you shouldn't sneer at people who compile things themselves
2008-10-27T05:55:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	IOW, an app compiled on your machine specifically may give you 45 seconds back during your use of the software. compiling will take >45 seconds. and when libraries get updated, expect breakage.
2008-10-27T05:56:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	yeah don't do this here; you're talking to a gentoo user right now; I am not going to say that ubuntu sucks because you use pre-compiled binaries optimized for a broad range of cpus, don't tell me that my way sucks
2008-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	i don't sneer at them. i sneer at the idea that using gcc "teaches me about Linux"
2008-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	wsa	mneptok	nobody said that
2008-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	mneptok	wsa	just like i never used the word "sucks"
