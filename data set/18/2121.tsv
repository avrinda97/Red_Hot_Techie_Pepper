2010-11-01T07:32:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	Is there anything wrong with automatic login as a normal user that isn't root?
2010-11-01T07:32:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	The start up time would be the same.
2010-11-01T07:34:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	If you don't mind being asked.. what can you do that needs root that often?
2010-11-01T07:38:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	Instaed of philosophy.. why do you want to be root on login? What does root login let you do that you can't do as a normal user or bothers you so much that root must be used?
2010-11-01T07:40:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	And you need to sudo for what purpose? To browse the web? Listen to much? Make a picture?
2010-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	You can go to just about every part of the system as a normal user. The only parts you can't write to are parts that'll harm you anyway. The only parts that you can't read, are not meant to be seen by a normal user anyway or people taking over your system for that matter.
2010-11-01T07:42:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	So.. why do you want to write into /proc.. or maybe the hashed passwords file?
2010-11-01T07:45:00.000Z	Diamondcite	lyj	Select programs can always be made to always run as root.. Or you can even have it so that a single change can be made and even folders you aren't supposed to see becomes visible to you.
