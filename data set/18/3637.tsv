2009-08-31T16:21:00.000Z	artificialexit		hey all, i seem to have lost smart tab completion and colours in the terminal? any ideas?
2009-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	You might have accidentially switched your shell from bash to sh.
2009-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	Try 'exec bash'
2009-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	artificialexit		how do i know if i use bash 4?
2009-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V will show you the version (if it's bash)
2009-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	artificialexit		exec bash didnt do anything either
2009-08-31T16:23:00.000Z	grawity		But I'm using bash4 on Arch, it works just fine
2009-08-31T16:23:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	Press Ctrl-X Ctrl-V, does it say anything?
2009-08-31T16:23:00.000Z	artificialexit		3.2.48
2009-08-31T16:23:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	So it's still bash. Try 'source ~/.profile' and see if that brings prompt back.
2009-08-31T16:23:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	And 'source ~/.bashrc' too.
2009-08-31T16:24:00.000Z	artificialexit		ah i think i know what happened
2009-08-31T16:24:00.000Z	artificialexit		i accidently ran rm -rf /home the other day thinking i was in a ssh server on another server
2009-08-31T16:25:00.000Z	artificialexit		some of the . files are missing
2009-08-31T16:25:00.000Z	artificialexit		yea i restored most of the stuff but .bashrc and .profile is gone anyway to get it back?
2009-08-31T16:26:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	sudo cp /etc/skel/.bashrc /etc/skel/.profile ~; sudo chown $USER ~/.bashrc ~/.profile
2009-08-31T16:26:00.000Z	grawity	artificialexit	/etc/skel contains the "skeleton" profile, the same all new users get - so copy and chown.
2009-08-31T16:27:00.000Z	artificialexit	grawity	thanks heaps worked a treat
