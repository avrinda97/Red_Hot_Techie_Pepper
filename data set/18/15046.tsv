2009-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	angie		 linux-image-2.6.27.10-grsec problem
2009-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	angie		i want to dump the gresec kernel, owh jrib
2009-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	manually change symlink in /usr/src?
2009-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	yes
2009-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	angie	Exposure	but it is only linux-headers-2.6.27-9-generic ?
2009-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	where does it get the grsec kernel from then?
2009-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	angie	Exposure	vanilla kernel + gresec patches
2009-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	nope you want to apt-get the kernel tree
2009-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	angie	Exposure	so i have to get the kernels from scratch?
2009-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	apt-get the kernel-source for the kernel-image you're wanting to compile on
2009-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	angie	Exposure	why do i need to get the kernel sources tho
2009-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	apparently the stuff you're compiling needs it
2009-01-09T05:43:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	not really, you need to remove the existing link to be able to make a new one
2009-01-09T05:43:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	it's always called 'linux' and it points the the kernel sources dir you want to use
2009-01-09T05:45:00.000Z	Exposure	angie	don't know, I prefer to do things manually and am not that much into inner workings of apt
