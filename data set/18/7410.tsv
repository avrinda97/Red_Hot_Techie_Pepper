2008-01-17T09:12:00.000Z	biouser		I going to die
2008-01-17T09:13:00.000Z	biouser		can anyone help diagnose my sound problem?
2008-01-17T09:14:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	what is it?
2008-01-17T09:14:00.000Z	biouser	Duke_Fluke	something PCI related, but it just turned bad after weeks of being fine
2008-01-17T09:14:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	Can you test with a live cd then?
2008-01-17T09:15:00.000Z	biouser	Duke_Fluke	I didn't change anything but there is a message about PCI that flashes when I boot now and the sound is very poor.
2008-01-17T09:16:00.000Z	biouser	Duke_Fluke	I suppose I could test with live CD
2008-01-17T09:16:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	ok so it works albeit poorly
2008-01-17T09:16:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	what is the message?
2008-01-17T09:17:00.000Z	biouser	Duke_Fluke	error while updating region or something, it goes by too fast to see
2008-01-17T09:17:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	 use 'dmesg|less' to find it
2008-01-17T09:18:00.000Z	biouser	Duke_Fluke	just put that in the terminal?
2008-01-17T09:33:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	i think thats about your hard drive
2008-01-17T10:03:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	 uname -a
2008-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	 wouldn't it be something like linux-headers-2.6.20-16?
2008-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	biouser	i mean linux-headers-2.6.20-16generic?
