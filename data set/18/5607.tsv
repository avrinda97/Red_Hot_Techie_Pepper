2008-09-18T10:19:00.000Z	nick[]		Whenever I boot from my Ubuntu (8.04) CD, it gives me the menu where I select my language and choose what I want to do. I choose to install Ubuntu, and it goes to the Ubuntu progress bar/bouncy thing. Stays there a while, then it loads some basic shell (TinyBox I think was the name) and sticks there without progressing. I looked through the command list for this shell and none of the provided commands seemed to allow me
