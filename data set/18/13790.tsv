2005-12-22T16:24:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	a bit of an exchange going on between ubuntu-newbie-s and zion_
2005-12-22T16:24:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	seems to have settled
2006-05-02T11:24:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	yeah?  any idea where I can find it?
2006-05-02T11:24:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	ah ok
2006-05-02T11:25:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	I'll check it out...been looking at it for a while now, just haven't found the right source of information yet
2006-05-02T11:26:00.000Z	crimsun	mustard5	iirc 'gdm', 'via', 'loop'
2006-05-02T11:26:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	thanks
2006-05-02T11:59:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	about the only solution I have found so far are some kernel options to try pci=noacpi  acpi=off noapic nolapic :)
2006-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	does that sound right?
2006-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	well not all of them...just some of them
2006-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	mustard5	sorry, missing context. For what problem?
2006-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	drumbeat infinite loop
2006-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	at gdm login on VIA motherboard
2006-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	mustard5	yes, that's are possible workarounds. How does each fare?
2006-05-02T12:01:00.000Z	mustard5	crimsun	so I'm going to try these ones and see if they are a better workaround
2006-05-10T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	mustard5	it's a shell built-in
