2008-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	saschahl	qowao	try the gnome-keyboard-properties. on the layout tab there is a button for extra settings. try enabling "super is mapped to the Win-keys"
2008-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	saschahl		it might not be recognized as a modificator yet
2008-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	qowao		whats metacity settings
2008-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	qowao	saschahl	but i dont want super to win keys i want CTRL+ALT to winkeys
2008-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	qowao		i want WIN+D = CTRL+ALT+D
2008-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	qowao		ok
2008-11-03T04:23:00.000Z	saschahl	qowao	don't you rather want the behaviour to match? I doubt you can map win+d to ctrl+alt+d, but you can make win+d show the desktop, if that's what you want
2008-11-03T04:23:00.000Z	qowao	saschahl	thta what i want yeah!
2008-11-03T04:24:00.000Z	qowao		to match
2008-11-03T04:24:00.000Z	saschahl	qowao	if you get win to be a modifier, you can enter win+d in the keyboard shortcuts
2008-11-03T04:24:00.000Z	qowao	saschahl	i mapped super to the winkeys but it did not work
