2005-09-10T12:47:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	brownie17	i'm suggesting just physically altering your data.
2005-09-10T12:47:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	brownie17	you could just make a new password and md5 it, and put that in your file.
2005-09-10T12:48:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	brownie17	huh?
2005-09-10T12:49:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	brownie17	you can rm -rf directory
