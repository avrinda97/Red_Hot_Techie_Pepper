2007-06-15T16:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Ubuntu-Noob	I see the problem, you are fine. The partitions are there, but the disk type is set to DMRAID
2007-06-15T16:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Ubuntu-Noob	are these disks part of a raid group ?
2007-06-15T16:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Ubuntu-Noob	you can try using fdisk to change the partition type - this shouldn't cause any data loss, but it could
2007-06-15T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Ubuntu-Noob	"sudo fdisk /dev/sda"
