2007-01-13T08:06:00.000Z	domas		ergh
2007-01-13T08:06:00.000Z	domas		where did /sbin/mount.xfs disappear?
2007-01-13T08:06:00.000Z	domas		why would anyone have mkfs, all the utilities, module, and no mount utility?
2007-01-13T08:07:00.000Z	domas		but it can't :(
2007-01-13T08:07:00.000Z	domas		seveas: it looks for mount.xfs
2007-01-13T08:07:00.000Z	domas		it is in there
2007-01-13T08:08:00.000Z	domas		of course
2007-01-13T08:08:00.000Z	domas		dmesg says it is all ok
2007-01-13T08:08:00.000Z	coNP	domas	what do you want to do? I have a lots of xfs fss mounted and there is no mount.xfs for me either
2007-01-13T08:09:00.000Z	domas	czr	/sbin/mount looks for mount.xfs (according to strace)

2007-01-13T08:11:00.000Z	domas		oh, hold on
2007-01-13T08:11:00.000Z	coNP	domas	what is /sbin/mount/? I have mount in /bin...
2007-01-13T08:12:00.000Z	domas	czr	same
2007-01-13T08:12:00.000Z	domas		conp: okok, /bin/mount
2007-01-13T08:12:00.000Z	coNP	domas	okay, sorry
