2011-06-05T03:25:00.000Z	r00tk1n6		How do you copy an iso to dvd in ubuntu?
2011-06-05T03:26:00.000Z	r00tk1n6		i get a message like error read only
2011-06-05T03:26:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	one of the programs to burn a DVD
2011-06-05T03:26:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	on command line: wodim
2011-06-05T03:27:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	doesn't matter ... the ISO is bootable or not ... burning has no effect
2011-06-05T03:28:00.000Z	r00tk1n6	Skaperen	I have a dvd with 4 gb space
2011-06-05T03:29:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	DVDs can do up to 4.70GB for single layer or 8.54GB for dual layer
2011-06-05T03:29:00.000Z	r00tk1n6	Skaperen	okay but how to format them?
2011-06-05T03:30:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	recordable DVDs are already formatted in the factory
2011-06-05T03:30:00.000Z	r00tk1n6	Skaperen	this is rewritable dvd
2011-06-05T03:30:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	and the ISO has the filesystem it needs
2011-06-05T03:30:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	then do an erase before recording it
2011-06-05T03:30:00.000Z	r00tk1n6	Skaperen	That's what I have been asking you
2011-06-05T03:31:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	you asked about how to copy the iso
2011-06-05T03:31:00.000Z	r00tk1n6	Skaperen	can you tell me how to erase it?
2011-06-05T03:32:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	I don't know how to erase ... I've never used a rewriteable, ever
2011-06-05T03:33:00.000Z	Skaperen	r00tk1n6	if all you want to do is get the ISO file to be an ISO file on another computer, then it's better to use the network to transfer or a USB flash drive
