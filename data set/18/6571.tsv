2008-04-30T14:12:00.000Z	sa		hey everyone
2008-04-30T14:12:00.000Z	sa		i just installed kopete for KDE to my GNOME. How come it is working but I cannot access the menu?
2008-04-30T14:13:00.000Z	jaredbuck	sa	make sure the kde regular packages are installed - try installing kubuntu-desktop. kopete won't work unless you have the kde files installed.
2008-04-30T14:14:00.000Z	sa	jaredbuck	ok, thank you. Another question. HOw do I install new emoticons to kopete?
2008-04-30T14:15:00.000Z	jaredbuck	sa	i don't know the answer to that one, the kopete defaults work fine for me. but i can look it up for you.
2008-04-30T14:15:00.000Z	sa	jaredbuck	thank you. I am looking into it also but cannot find it
2008-04-30T14:17:00.000Z	jaredbuck	sa	take a look here: http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdenetwork/kopete/faq.html#id2557327 and look at 8.4.
