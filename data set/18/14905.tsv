2005-07-21T15:20:00.000Z	imaek		When I was installing ubuntu, it asked me what resolution my graphics card supported, and it had a couple of default ones selected.  Now those are in System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution.  Unfortunately, the largest one was like 800x600, and I am stuck with that.   Is there any way to edit what resolutions I can change to?

2005-07-21T15:21:00.000Z	imaek		NVidia geforce 6600 i think
2005-07-21T15:21:00.000Z	imaek		I may be completely wrong.
