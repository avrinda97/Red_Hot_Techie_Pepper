2010-01-27T00:43:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	read that and if you have any questions or run into problems please feel free to ask here
2010-01-27T00:50:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	it doesnt have usb there just pci
2010-01-27T00:50:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	what make/model?
2010-01-27T00:52:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	provide me with some details of the make/model and I'll take a look
2010-01-27T00:52:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	Ralink 3070
2010-01-27T00:52:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	it shows up on the lsusb
2010-01-27T00:54:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	you have the drivers right?
2010-01-27T00:54:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	would it be possible for you to pastebin the output from 'iwconfig' and 'dmesg | grep rt2'
2010-01-27T01:02:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	all the details are on my laptop
2010-01-27T01:04:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	most people would need to look at the output of those two commands that I gave too you before they would be able to help. as a wild guess I remember that there was issues with rt2800usb and rt2870sta fighting, you could try blacklisting rt2800usb by doing 'sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf' and adding 'rt2800usb'
2010-01-27T01:05:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	i can save them and import them to you
2010-01-27T01:05:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	how do i patebin??
2010-01-27T01:06:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	paste the URL of the pasebin to me in this channel when you have done so and I'll take a look
2010-01-27T01:06:00.000Z	w3l54666	steffan	ok
2010-01-27T01:12:00.000Z	steffan	w3l54666	sorry I actually have to leave right now but if you gather a pastebin of the output of the two commands that I gave you I'm sure that someone else will be able to help - if not I'll take a look when I return
