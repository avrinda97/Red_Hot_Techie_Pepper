2005-04-10T13:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	Sounds like you want GNOME. :)
2005-04-22T12:39:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	Doesn't psyco compile it?
2005-04-22T12:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	Kind of, that's a tricky edge case.
2005-04-22T12:45:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	the problem as I see it is that the kernel is buried very deep, and everything else kinda impinges. *looked at a layer diagram of the Windows OS stack and it scared me*
2005-04-22T12:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	Linux is no better there.
2005-04-22T12:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	Kernel, <other stuff>, X, xlib, GTK, GNOME
2005-04-22T12:46:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	True... but at least the code seems more maintainable. (note: seems)
2005-04-22T12:46:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	and they're distinct layers... in Windows you have some of the layers that jump lower layers
2005-04-22T12:47:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	Agreed... very very well designed
2005-04-22T12:48:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	Should be... it was conceived of by MS Research, who are cool
2005-04-22T12:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	Yeah, thank Sun for the design. ;)
2005-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	No... the design of the architecture is obviously heavily influenced by people like SPJ (the guy who created Haskell and maintains the open-source GHC)
2005-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	I meant C#.
2005-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	Well, that's just one language. I like the fact that they considered programming language semantic theory when designing the CLR
2005-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	It really shows... and its really cool :)
2005-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Arnia	It might really show in 2.0 but in 1.0 you basically had C# and things that worked like it.
2005-04-22T12:51:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	No... tailcalls are in 1.0
2005-04-22T12:51:00.000Z	Arnia	Amaranth	Look at the number of functional languages ending up in .Net
