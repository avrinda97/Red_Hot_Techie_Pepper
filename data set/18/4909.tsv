2009-01-18T08:45:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	I have it in a vm.. but compiz won't work in vm
2009-01-18T08:46:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	install pidgin
2009-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	also if you have an ekiga or other sip phone account as well as gtalk, msn, yahoo, aim etc.. you could also try wengophone.. in repo's
2009-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	which one..?  wengophone?
2009-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	I like it too.. however I have several sip accounts and haven't figured out how to change from one to the other.  othere than that it's pretty good.
2009-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	don't attempt it.. wait for Jaunty
2009-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	markiv1982	izinucs	are u using Jaunty?
2009-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	no.. I have a production laptop with hardy and a desktop (my primary) with intrepid.. Jaunty is too new
2009-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	if you want to try it.. do it in a vm
2009-01-18T08:56:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	doesn't matter
2009-01-18T08:58:00.000Z	izinucs	markiv1982	because I have your nick in the line.. makes you aware that the mesage is for you'
