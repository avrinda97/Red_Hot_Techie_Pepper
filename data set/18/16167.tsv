2005-11-08T13:35:00.000Z	dave		ok i was asked to search for Linux-headers to enter the path in a config file for qemu, however the installed header appears different to those in Synaptic, however the installed image matches
2005-11-08T13:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	 sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)     <---- literally that command
2005-11-08T13:41:00.000Z	dave	thoreauputic	tried that get a message E: Couldnt find package linux-headers-2.6.12-8-386
2005-11-08T13:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	that kernel is from a pre-release install, right ?
2005-11-08T13:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	 sudo apt-get install linux-386  ( I think you'll find there's a newer one)
2005-11-08T13:42:00.000Z	dave	thoreauputic	yes i think so since i upgraded before release
2005-11-08T13:42:00.000Z	dave	thoreauputic	ok will try thank yuou
2005-11-08T13:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	and the newer one should haev matching headers
2005-11-08T13:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	so I would repeat the command  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) after installing it and rebooting
2005-11-08T13:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	note that you will need a reboot to be running the newer kernel
2005-11-08T13:45:00.000Z	dave	thoreauputic	ok now installing 2.6.12-9-386
2005-11-08T13:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	yes, that's current
2005-11-08T13:45:00.000Z	dave	thoreauputic	thanks then i need to reboot.
2005-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	to run your new kernel, yes
2005-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	then the command I gave earlier should work fine
2005-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	dave	thoreauputic	thank you. then hopefully i will be able to install qemu
2005-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	hopefully yes :)
2005-11-18T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dave	yes
