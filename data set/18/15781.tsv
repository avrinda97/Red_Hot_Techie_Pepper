2005-01-28T13:22:00.000Z	embsupafly		I don't have any songs, don't know where to get them.
2005-01-28T13:22:00.000Z	embsupafly		I use bittorrrent, but how do you find music with it
2005-01-28T13:23:00.000Z	embsupafly		cool thanks,
2005-01-28T13:24:00.000Z	embsupafly		I have used bittorrent in windows, does it work the same in linux
2005-01-28T13:24:00.000Z	cspenc	embsupafly	yep works fine
2005-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	embsupafly		can I double click on the torrent file or do I have to use the command line
2005-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	cspenc	embsupafly	if you want something cool, run screen and then put the the command line bittornado
2005-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	cspenc		azureus is nice too if you like guis
2005-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	cspenc		i have an old server just do all my torrents from a multiplexed command line
2005-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	cspenc		works pretty well
2005-01-28T13:27:00.000Z	embsupafly	cspenc	how do you use screen, what is it
2005-01-28T13:27:00.000Z	cspenc	embsupafly	it is just a way to have multiple terminals in one "screen", a precursor to WM's
2005-01-28T13:27:00.000Z	cspenc		then you can attach and detach at will without losing your session
2005-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	embsupafly		bittornado is not found
2005-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	cspenc	embsupafly	btdownloadcurses or btdownloadgui i think
2005-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	embsupafly		then what
2005-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	cspenc	embsupafly	a torrent file argument
