2009-04-06T13:00:00.000Z	cloexhl		we stuck on a debatable point on ##linux so can somebody try to help us out here
2009-04-06T13:01:00.000Z	cloexhl		have anybody tried using permisions on fat32 partitions?
2009-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	asking on different channels isn't going to make fat32 learn ACLs
2009-04-06T13:03:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	if it worked with me, then there's something wrong
2009-04-06T13:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	why not read some documentation on FAT32 instead of asking the same question over and over until you get the answer you want?
2009-04-06T13:06:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	i already read and i see your point so iam trying to explain why it worked with me
2009-04-06T13:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	hes saying he really knows nothing about it
2009-04-06T13:08:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	you're talking about the general technical issue here, but i know that fat32 don't undergo unix permissions however my question is why did it work?
2009-04-06T13:09:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	and since linux deals with everything as files so why wouldn't it work?
2009-04-06T13:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	I think you were mistaken
2009-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	I have tried it, I have seen countless posts in ubuntu forums of people trying it.....a
2009-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	and in case your wandering, you also can not set unix permissions on a NTFS drive
2009-04-06T13:12:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	even though it does have a concept of ACLs, it is not the same
2009-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	should i do chmod u-rwx /mnt/flash   or chmod u-rwx /dev/sda1    ?
2009-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	 believe me it works
2009-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	cloexhl	Titan8990	my flash is called Gates so   [gates@dhcppc0 mnt]$ ls GATES/
2009-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	/mnt/flash is a directory on your unix filesytem
2009-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	cloexhl	now do a sub directory
