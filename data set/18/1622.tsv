2011-01-06T12:05:00.000Z	Xyresic		Ubuntu 10.10
2011-01-06T12:06:00.000Z	Xyresic		Well, I didn't lose it with a windows install
2011-01-06T12:07:00.000Z	Xyresic		I was making a new partition in Window's diskmgmt and I think that broke grub '-'
2011-01-06T12:07:00.000Z	Xyresic		Because the next thing that happened was windows bluescreened after trying to make the partition and grub died
2011-01-06T12:07:00.000Z	Xyresic		No, it wasn't wubi
2011-01-06T12:08:00.000Z	Xyresic		Also
2011-01-06T12:08:00.000Z	Xyresic		When I booted from the live disk,  I somehow had /dev/sda1-60
2011-01-06T12:08:00.000Z	Xyresic		No, I can't... grub goes into recovery mode
2011-01-06T12:08:00.000Z	Xyresic		And I don't have 60 partitions
2011-01-06T12:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xyresic	Sounds like a severely broken partition table.
2011-01-06T12:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xyresic	What is the output of "sudo parted -l"?
2011-01-06T12:10:00.000Z	Xyresic	Jordan_U	sec, lemme get onto the live disk again
2011-01-06T12:15:00.000Z	Xyresic	Jordan_U	It gives a error, "can't have overlapping partitions"
2011-01-06T12:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xyresic	I can walk you through installing a windows style mbr from within Ubuntu.
2011-01-06T12:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xyresic	Can you run "sudo fdisk /dev/sda" and pastebin the output? I seem to remember fdisk fixing this type of problem automatically to a certain extent before.
2011-01-06T12:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xyresic	Why not? (By the way, I agree with JackOfHearts that testdisk will probably be able to fix this).
