2008-06-12T05:37:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	There are currently no wild virus threats for linux. A virus on linux cant do as much damage as a virus on windows can is the basics
2008-06-12T05:37:00.000Z	Uplink	Prefix	i understand that... but the root and user thing i dont understand
2008-06-12T05:39:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	the root has its own separate partition to protect it further, its basically the top admin of the system, and if it is kept secure your system is safe from all threats
2008-06-12T05:39:00.000Z	Uplink	Prefix	exactly! how does it protect itself?
2008-06-12T05:40:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Becuase only root can do certain damaging commands, and unless someone who cracks the root password get access then your system cannot be hurt. It alos has its own partition on the harddrive so that if the system is filled with files such as the new folder one above, root can repair the issue
2008-06-12T05:41:00.000Z	Uplink	Prefix	ok for example I download a damaging script and i run it with root...
2008-06-12T05:41:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Rule #1: Never run as root.
2008-06-12T05:42:00.000Z	Uplink	Prefix	why not? some stuff ask me to run as root
2008-06-12T05:42:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Only run as root is you trust the source
2008-06-12T05:43:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Is he saying something about wafers? Cause im getting that too
2008-06-12T05:43:00.000Z	Uplink	Prefix	stupid $#!T
2008-06-12T05:56:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	just do not ever run anything along the lines of rm -rf ( DO NOT EVEN TRY IT SERIOUSLY (Also, dont ban me for this..) )
2008-06-12T05:59:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Really? Im impressed if you have a seperate /home - I only learnt this lesson last week lol
2008-06-12T06:00:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Most of your setting will be saved in /home
2008-06-12T06:50:00.000Z	Prefix	Uplink	Define: 'How linux works'
