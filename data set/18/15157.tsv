2005-04-27T15:34:00.000Z	soccer45202		i have a general question...i was a long time fedora user before picking up warty for its RC a while back...i am now running hoary and am playing around with a pvr-500 card that uses the ivtv drivers...i have compiled and installed the drivers, but have a question about modules.conf - is that even still used anymore?  I do not seem to even have the file on my computer
2005-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	eruin	soccer45202	use /etc/modules
2005-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	soccer45202	eruin	same type of usage?
2005-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	eruin		just spit out the module name there
2005-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	eruin		;)
2005-04-27T15:36:00.000Z	soccer45202	eruin	what about alias lines and options lines?
2005-04-27T15:37:00.000Z	eruin	soccer45202	no need for alias lines afaik
2005-04-27T15:37:00.000Z	eruin	soccer45202	and I've never had to use options ;-)
