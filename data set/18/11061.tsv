2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	RawSushi		I have a problem..I installed the flash plugin for mozilla firefox
2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	RawSushi		and It didn't work
2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	RawSushi		what could the problem be?
2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	RawSushi		it used to work just fine
2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	how did you install it?
2006-09-20T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	does it say the plugin is missing now when you go to badgerbadgerbadger.com maybe?
2006-09-20T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	run this command 'ls -l /usr/lib/firefox/plugins' and put the ressult on pasttebin please
2006-09-20T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	that is all of it?
2006-09-20T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	run this command: sudo update-flashplugin
2006-09-20T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	try to prefix any messages to me with my name, otherwise they will probably get lost in the scrollback
2006-09-20T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	ok, can you download the flash install tar.gz from adobe's site and put it on your desktop?
2006-09-20T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	well you can do 'locate libflashplayer.so' if you wish to see if it exists anywhere on your system, but if you use update-flashplugin to install after downloading the tar.gz I think it is a better option
2006-09-20T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	once you have the tar.gz downloadedto your desktop, you should be able to do: sudo update-flashplugin -l ~/Desktop
2006-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	RawSushi	jrib	it says plugin changed, not trusted
2006-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	hmm
2006-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	ok, well in that case you should just extract the tar.gz and copy flashplayer.xpt and libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2006-09-20T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	RawSushi	that will only work for your user though, it should be fine if you are the only user.  Otherwise I guess your forced to go dabble with sudo in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
2006-09-20T06:45:00.000Z	RawSushi	jrib	that worked.  thanks a lot
