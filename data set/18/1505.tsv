2012-11-03T20:12:00.000Z	raj		ah crap
2012-11-03T20:12:00.000Z	raj		ubuntu's nginx is old as hell
2012-11-03T20:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	what ubuntu version are you running?
2012-11-03T20:24:00.000Z	raj	ThinkT510	Not sure, 11.04 I think
2012-11-03T20:24:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	what is the output of lsb_release -sd
2012-11-03T20:32:00.000Z	raj	ThinkT510	11.04
2012-11-03T20:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	11.04 is no longer supported
2012-11-03T20:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	use the latest ubuntu
2012-11-03T20:35:00.000Z	raj	ThinkT510	that's a pretty drastic way to get the latest nginx :
2012-11-03T20:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	we can't support 11.04
2012-11-03T20:36:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	if you use unsupported versions then you need to deal with the consequences
2012-11-03T20:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	the support schedule for all ubuntu releases is very clear
2012-11-03T21:21:00.000Z	raj	ThinkT510	`sudo: ppa-purge: command not found`
2012-11-03T21:21:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	install ppa-purge first
2012-11-03T21:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	you still on 11.04?
2012-11-03T22:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	told you earlier
2012-11-03T22:13:00.000Z	raj	ThinkT510	yes you did, i was trying to avoid doing so since I have a lot of software development going on in here
2012-11-03T22:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	raj	didn't you plan before-hand to upgrade ubuntu before support ran out?
