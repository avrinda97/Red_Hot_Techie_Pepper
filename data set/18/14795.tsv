2005-09-24T10:19:00.000Z	shorty114		aptitude install xfce4?
2005-09-24T10:19:00.000Z	shorty114		ok
2005-09-24T10:20:00.000Z	shorty114		ookay this'll take a while
2005-09-24T10:20:00.000Z	shorty114		21 now
2005-09-24T10:21:00.000Z	shorty114		it's already unpacking
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shorty114		i already have GNOMe on here...
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shorty114		so i'd have xorg, right?
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shorty114		sweet
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shorty114		i just can't stand gnome
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shorty114		and kde's too high-end for my machine :)(
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	disasm	shorty114	i dont think it will install it, at least with debian sarge it doesn't because i have a couple servers with no xserver, but have xfce or fluxbox installed for use in vnc (which doesn't require an xserver)
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	shorty114	BlueEagle	i know, i was talking to geez
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	shorty114		<shorty114> geez, if it needs it, i guess it'll install xorg too
2005-09-24T10:24:00.000Z	shorty114		but that can also be taken as not a nick :)
2005-09-24T10:24:00.000Z	shorty114		i wonder if he has any problems with people going "geez, shut up" to other people...
2005-09-24T10:25:00.000Z	shorty114		so after it's done installing, it should be listed in the Sessions thing in gdm, right?
2005-09-24T10:25:00.000Z	shorty114		so i can just log out and it'll be available?
2005-09-24T10:25:00.000Z	disasm	shorty114	thats why i use : it tends to break things better than a comma (ntm tab completion puts it in)
