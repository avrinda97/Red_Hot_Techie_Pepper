2005-10-18T08:27:00.000Z	Tomcat_	knosys	You might want to try to create a new Firefox profile (take out your bookmarks first)
2005-10-18T08:27:00.000Z	knosys		what can be then?
2005-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	knosys	Tomcat_	can i private message you?
2005-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	Tomcat_	knosys	No idea. Maybe you got something installed that's making problems.
2005-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	Tomcat_	knosys	Rather not, sorry... I can't help you any further anyway.
2005-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	knosys	Tomcat_	you told me something about new firefox profile
2005-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	knosys		mmm
2005-10-18T08:29:00.000Z	knosys		what you meaned with profile?
2005-10-18T08:29:00.000Z	Tomcat_	knosys	Copy ~/.mozilla to some other place, then delete the original. Upon starting Firefox, it will create a new profile. Then, try to access the website.
