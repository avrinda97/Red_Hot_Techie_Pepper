2011-07-03T19:08:00.000Z	bukowski		can I ask a newbie support question here?
2011-07-03T19:10:00.000Z	bukowski		Trying to install Ubuntu 11.04 on acer apsire one d255 -- running test drive off usb stick and I have aboslutely no touchpad control.  tried gconftool-2 as I found onine, no luck.  Apparently there is nothing in Xorg.0.log relating to my trackpad.  I would like to install ubuntu, but obviously need a functioning trackpad.
2011-07-03T19:12:00.000Z	bukowski		drink a few bottles of wine and throw the fucking netbook out the 15th floor window.
2011-07-03T19:12:00.000Z	bukowski		what is a WMID device?
2011-07-03T19:12:00.000Z	bukowski		'scuse me... burp.
2011-07-03T19:13:00.000Z	bukowski		thought you had to do whole extra thing to get wifi working?
2011-07-03T19:15:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	LTS*, long teerm support
2011-07-03T19:13:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	10.04 works fine on AAone.
2011-07-03T19:13:00.000Z	bukowski	ohir	 wifi too?
2011-07-03T19:13:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	I do not tried 11.04 though
2011-07-03T19:13:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	yep, wifi too
2011-07-03T19:14:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	10.04 is LTE distro
2011-07-03T19:14:00.000Z	bukowski	ohir	- straight from the install disk?  I only went with 11.04 because I read that wifi didn't work on d255 without extra pckgs
2011-07-03T19:14:00.000Z	bukowski	ohir	 LTE means?
2011-07-03T19:14:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	with 3yr support so I'd suggest starting with that
2011-07-03T19:16:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	there were problems with wifi on AAone IIRC. It was fixed with ne update though
2011-07-03T19:16:00.000Z	ohir	bukowski	so be prepared to get updates over wire
