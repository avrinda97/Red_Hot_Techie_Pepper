2008-05-17T15:36:00.000Z	kajo		Does anyone have a foggy idea of why my tty's would just turn up black screens instead of prompts?
2008-05-17T15:37:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	is compiz and/or xgl running? I know someone who had to disable them to get a tty
2008-05-17T15:39:00.000Z	kajo	mcphail	I have *nothing* running. I am in fluxbox, trying to install my system. I used startx (purposely have no display manager), and now fluxbox's right click menu is not working, so I can't get to terminal. No problem, except that my tty's won't work either.
2008-05-17T15:39:00.000Z	kajo	mcphail	so no- I have neither of those running. Though, if you asked me to check, I wouldn't know how, as I can't open terminal to run top or pstree. :\
2008-05-17T15:40:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	try creating a file called /home/kajo/.config/xserver-xgl/disable and restart x
2008-05-17T15:43:00.000Z	kajo		How do I create this file without having a terminal or gui to start programs from? ctr + alt +dlt doesn't even work, though I can move my mouse and righ click on the taskbar. Should I just hard restart and go from there?
2008-05-17T15:43:00.000Z	kajo		@ mcphail
2008-05-17T15:44:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	you must have a terminal before you type "startx" :)
2008-05-17T15:44:00.000Z	kajo	mcphail	- I used a terminal to type startx, the terminal that started when I booted; I don't have gdm or other display mgr. After typing startx, I lost access.
2008-05-17T15:45:00.000Z	kajo		concerning Chrysalis, isn't there a DVD that has all the 'buntu's on it?
2008-05-17T15:45:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	try pressing "Alt-SysRq-R" then "Ctrl-Alt-Backspace"
2008-05-17T15:46:00.000Z	kajo	mcphail	I typed them in the wrong order. :\ now I just have a black screen. xD
2008-05-17T15:47:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	to be safe, type "Ctrl-Alt-R-E-I-S-U-B" to reboot safely then...
2008-05-17T15:48:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	sorry Alt-SysRQ-REISUB !
2008-05-17T15:48:00.000Z	kajo	mcphail	too late, I tried ctr + alt +dlt, and now it has restarted. At least that works now.
2008-05-17T15:48:00.000Z	kajo		What are those esoteric keystrokes???
2008-05-17T15:48:00.000Z	kajo		I've never seen those.
2008-05-17T15:49:00.000Z	mcphail	kajo	google for "raising elephants is so utterly boring"
