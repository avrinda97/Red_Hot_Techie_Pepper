2005-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	Nei		is it normal that the fglrx driver in the package manager does not work?
2005-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	Nei		I followed every guide I found on the net but I can't get it to work :((
2005-11-04T16:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	did you follow the Ubuntu wiki's ATI page?
2005-11-04T16:29:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	I followed https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2005-11-04T16:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	including the part about changing the configs with X shut down? I had to do that to get my ATI 9600XT's 3d running in Breezy, but now it works flawlessly.
2005-11-04T16:31:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	yes I have the fglrx driver in my xorg.conf and as you can see it also tries to load up
2005-11-04T16:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	you've done the whole reconfiguration with X shut down?
2005-11-04T16:33:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	yes I've done that, stopped gdm and all
2005-11-04T16:36:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	what kernel are you using?
2005-11-04T16:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	2.6.12-9-k7
2005-11-04T16:37:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	I'm using 386 maybe they only ship working packages with k7
2005-11-04T16:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	no idea about kernel vs graphics... sorry. You might want to check out the Ubuntu forums, though
2005-11-04T16:41:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	how would I go about switching the kernel? I'm a bit new in that biz
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	what actual chip are you running?
2005-11-04T16:47:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	mobile xp 2000+
2005-11-04T16:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	you can run the k7 kernel, then -
2005-11-04T16:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nei	I had a Linux-savvy friend switch this machine over to the k7 kernel, so I can't remember how we did it... sorry
2005-11-04T17:22:00.000Z	Nei	Madpilot	wow, it works in the k7 version. shitty ubuntu :/
