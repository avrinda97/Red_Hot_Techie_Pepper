2012-09-03T20:44:00.000Z	opieng		when you install things using sudo, why do they not appear on the desktop?
2012-09-03T20:45:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	why would an app/package installed auto-apear on your desktop?
2012-09-03T20:45:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	thats not the usual behaviour - installing means installing ..not creating aliases or similar to your desktop
2012-09-03T20:46:00.000Z	opieng	fidel	I am used to windows, thats all
2012-09-03T20:47:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	creating desktop-shortcuts is - if done at all usualy a bonbon/add-on after finishing the real install. in linux its usualy on you to do so - especialy as some desktop-environment try to keep your desktop free/uncluttered
2012-09-03T20:48:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	give those launchers a chance - there are several ways/apps to start apps by name just bypressing a shortcut and entering a few letters.
2012-09-03T20:50:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	could you pastebin us the output of your apt-command? maybe we can explain if there was some error output
2012-09-03T20:52:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	there was no error at all in your paste ;)
2012-09-03T20:54:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	so basically - your paste shows how it fetched the data of that specific package - unpacked it and did the core-setup
2012-09-03T20:55:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	what do you mean by 'search function'?
2012-09-03T20:56:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	guess you mean the unity dash right?
2012-09-03T20:57:00.000Z	opieng	fidel	yes the portal looking icon with a round white circle
2012-09-03T20:58:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	tried starting it from cli? not using that package here - nor am i using unity - so i cant doublecheck if it act similar here.
2012-09-03T21:00:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	yep: sudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME
2012-09-03T21:00:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	while: apt-cache search SEARCHSTRING  << will search the package informations for your SEARCHSTRING
2012-09-03T21:01:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	apt is acutaly pretty lovely if you get used to the basic commands;)
2012-09-03T21:03:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	you can for sure us some kind of software-center or apt-gui as well - but it will help you to udnerstand the basics of apt and cli-usage
2012-09-04T15:57:00.000Z	fidel	opieng	try to rephrase your problem - what do you mean by 'wine stopped installing' and did you see/get any error output?
