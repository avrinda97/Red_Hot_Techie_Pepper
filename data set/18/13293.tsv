2005-12-22T10:58:00.000Z	DUNFreak	Toma-	what apricot means is that the WIN key is rather useless by default on ubuntu. Is there any way to map it somehow? A key menu editor?
2005-12-22T10:58:00.000Z	Toma-	DUNFreak	Yes. but theres alot of things you can map it to.
2005-12-22T10:59:00.000Z	DUNFreak	Toma-	any way to make it act a bit like in windows, e.g. WIN+R for run, WIN+E for nautilus?

2005-12-22T11:06:00.000Z	Toma-	DUNFreak	i dont think enough thought has gone ointo the "Evil Empire" key as the devels are probably against it as it is. kde might be more willing to shed some light on it
