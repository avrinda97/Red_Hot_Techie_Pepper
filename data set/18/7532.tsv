2008-04-11T19:12:00.000Z	salko		dont know
2008-04-11T19:12:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	do you have direct rendering enabled? which gpu are you using?
2008-04-11T19:13:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	lspci | grep VGA
2008-04-11T19:13:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	so you don't have installed any driver yet, did you?
2008-04-11T19:15:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	wow, what's acient!
2008-04-11T19:15:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	you serioulsy want to use compiz on it? I requieres at least a geforce 2
2008-04-11T19:20:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	compiz requires a GeForce 2 to work
2008-04-11T19:22:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	It's about hardware functions - you can emulate it by the cpu using xgl, but emulating gpu funktions is not that a good idea in respects of performance...
2008-04-11T19:22:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	which cpu are you using?
2008-04-11T19:22:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	(cat /proc/cpuinfo)
2008-04-11T19:26:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	and you have a Riva TNT inside? well, you might try it, there should be an article about the xgl-server
2008-04-11T19:31:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	have you installed the driver at all? what tells you glxinfo | grep direct?
2008-04-11T19:34:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	so everything seems to work
2008-04-11T19:34:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	but if you want compiz on that hardware, you'll ahve to use xgl
2008-04-11T19:42:00.000Z	benpicco_	salko	you'll need to logout and select the session xgl
