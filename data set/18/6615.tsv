2008-04-24T19:36:00.000Z	Ertyle	khalderon	go to the "torrents for other Ubuntu flavors" and you'll find it
2008-04-24T19:36:00.000Z	Ertyle	khalderon	in the factoid you were just thrown. http://releases.ubuntu.com/
2008-04-24T19:38:00.000Z	Ertyle	khalderon	the link to the live CD is given because *that is the official installation CD*. if you want to use alternate, you'll surely know how to browse a web site.
2008-04-24T19:38:00.000Z	khalderon	Ertyle	how arrogant
2008-04-24T19:39:00.000Z	Ertyle	khalderon	most people won't need or want the alternate CD. and providing *that* link *would* confuse them.
2008-04-24T19:40:00.000Z	Ertyle	khalderon	i don't see why you'd need the alternate CD unless you want to install a custom selection of packages, or your computer has very limited hardware resources.
2008-04-24T19:42:00.000Z	Ertyle	khalderon	please STOP using enter as punctuation, my client is about to freeze up from the scrolling. yes, that's an official mirror
2008-04-24T19:42:00.000Z	khalderon	Ertyle	just stop telling me how to write here! this is insulting!
