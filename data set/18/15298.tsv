2005-10-01T14:20:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	hmm
2005-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	benplaut	ompaul	wait a sec... are you, by chance, a Openbox or CLI junkie?
2005-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	well when I am not using gnome cli :)
2005-10-01T14:22:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	most of the time I use a few terminals and I'm happy
2005-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	I can't hear you, but you sure as **** can be read :)
2005-11-16T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	there is a samba client that is all I know
2005-11-16T16:09:00.000Z	benplaut	ompaul	yeah... that's all anyone seems to know :(
2005-11-16T16:09:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	well I am sure that there is a faq on google that explains it all, or something on the samba site it is a huge project
2005-11-16T16:11:00.000Z	benplaut	ompaul	yeah... i searched this for a week a few months ago, there seems to be nothing on it... nobody even seems to know what this type of login is called...
2005-11-16T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	the login to windows? which kind of windows box?
2005-11-16T16:12:00.000Z	benplaut	ompaul	win server 2003. all the lab computers are hooked up so that you can login to the server from any computer, access your files, and program settings, but the programs are on individual computers... i think it's called a roaming profile
2005-11-16T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	benplaut	I guess you need to talk to #windows they have a channel here
2005-11-16T16:17:00.000Z	benplaut	ompaul	in #windows... i ask what it's called, i get "A typical school setup?"
