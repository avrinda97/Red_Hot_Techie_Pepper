2010-08-18T05:58:00.000Z	xangua	rafazed	try 64bit then, you can also use 32bit with no problem
2010-08-18T05:59:00.000Z	rafazed		but i have heard of some problems on 64bit version
2010-08-18T05:59:00.000Z	rafazed		first it takes more ram
2010-08-18T05:59:00.000Z	xangua	rafazed	the only issue with 32bit is it doesn't detect 4gb of ram but you can detect them with !pae
2010-08-18T06:00:00.000Z	rafazed		and second it isnt compatible with all of the programs
2010-08-18T06:00:00.000Z	rafazed	xangua	btw how do i send you a private message like u?
2010-08-18T06:03:00.000Z	rafazed		xangua

2010-08-18T06:06:00.000Z	rafazed		how do i send you a private message like your last message?
2010-08-18T06:10:00.000Z	rafazed		what else, besides recognizing more than 3.2gb ram, the 64bit version can do?
2010-08-18T06:13:00.000Z	xangua	rafazed	with !pae 32bit can detect more than 3.2bgof ram
