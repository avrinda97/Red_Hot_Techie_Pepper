2005-10-22T16:27:00.000Z	leagris		I played World Of Warcraft with cedega every evening theses last months
2005-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	leagris		I am still looking for a way to mount my cdrom in userspace while in cmd line
2005-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	leagris		I have looked at pmount-hal but how do I use it ?
2005-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	leagris		How do I know the <hal uid> of the cdrom ?
2005-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	intelikey	leagris	in your /etc/fstab   add "users" to the line that describes your cdrom drive and make the mount point what ever you like.
2005-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	leagris		the mount command does not work as a user and it dos not like to work with the media:// thing for removable mediums
2005-10-22T07:01:00.000Z	intelikey	leagris	mount works for users   but you need "users" in the fstab
2005-10-22T07:02:00.000Z	leagris		oki, but it ille interfere with the hald daemon tring to script automounting isn't it ?
2005-10-22T07:02:00.000Z	leagris		it may
2005-10-22T07:02:00.000Z	intelikey	leagris	something like "/dev/hdb /mnt/cdrom auto defaults,ro,noauto,users,umask=0 0 0"
2005-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	intelikey	leagris	notice   "users"   ^
2005-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	leagris	intelikey	I like the way I can show cd cdrom icon in gnome while inserting a cd
2005-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	leagris		I don't want to break this
2005-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	leagris		I thought I had to talk th hald daemon with pmount-hal in order to do this accordingly
2005-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	intelikey	leagris	it wont break it if you just add a line.
2005-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	intelikey		a device can be described more than one time in fstab
2005-10-22T07:05:00.000Z	leagris	intelikey	ok that's neat. I didn't know it after 6 years of Linux. Thanks
