2006-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	xgodsoul		harry : ohh use it
2006-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	xgodsoul		harry why?
2006-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	xgodsoul		harry whats happenning?
2006-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	xgodsoul		hahahahahah :) intelikey :)
2006-06-11T08:14:00.000Z	xgodsoul		FLAC is owning every lossfull media compression :) even OGG :D
2006-06-11T08:15:00.000Z	xgodsoul		harry what happens when you try to run it? just nothing? or somethings is written?
2006-06-11T08:15:00.000Z	krazykit	xgodsoul	actually, wavpack has a slightly better compression ratio, but it's not well supported in linux yet, despite being FOSS.
2006-06-11T08:16:00.000Z	xgodsoul	krazykit	:) hehe :P but ... well.. perhaps just because i'm used to FLAC... i'll give a try to wavpack ;) thanks for the notice!
2006-06-11T08:17:00.000Z	krazykit	xgodsoul	i don't know of any players other than MAYBE xmms that play wavpack.
2006-06-11T08:18:00.000Z	xgodsoul	krazykit	:well... if it's a lossless media compression filetype, it's worth checking :) i'm musician (pianist) and for shows and things like that, I can't just playback a lossy mp3 through speakers :P
2006-06-11T08:19:00.000Z	xgodsoul	krazykit	: so i'll try wavpak :) wavs are toooo unconveinients for transport....
2006-06-11T08:19:00.000Z	krazykit	xgodsoul	then unless you have 100+ gigs of FLAC, it probably wouldn't be worth going with wavpack
2006-06-11T08:20:00.000Z	xgodsoul	krazykit	hehe :P :) but it's nice to know other types, like that in the future, I will know the possibilities :P thanks!
2006-06-11T08:21:00.000Z	krazykit	xgodsoul	but yeah, as far as lossless formats go, flac is the best supported, and i encode all my music with flac.  it's quite good
2006-06-11T08:21:00.000Z	xgodsoul	krazykit	:) thats why I like it, and use it :D
2006-06-11T08:25:00.000Z	krazykit	xgodsoul	and made: there's a deb around.
2006-06-11T08:26:00.000Z	xgodsoul	krazykit	not in synaptics heh ? :) would find in in the ubuntu comunity, the gaim developping website or on google?
