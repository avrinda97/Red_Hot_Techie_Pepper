2008-06-12T12:34:00.000Z	Kohlrak		alright, i tried using idapro, but i coudln't find exactly what i was looking for in there
2008-06-12T12:35:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	why did you? to use IDA you better know assembly or that time is wasted
2008-06-12T12:36:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	dpkg -S <path to .so file>   what does this say?
2008-06-12T12:37:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	answer me
2008-06-12T12:39:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	so you know now it comes from the libc6 package. now you know what to get
2008-06-12T12:40:00.000Z	Kohlrak	wols_	then what do i get? I seach up libc6 in synaptics but sources isn't in there that i can see
2008-06-12T12:41:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	that's BS
2008-06-12T12:41:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	man apt-get
2008-06-12T12:41:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	if it weren't ther, Ubuntu would violate the GPL. in a BIG way
2008-06-12T12:42:00.000Z	Kohlrak	wols_	it's surely out there... Just not in synaptics XD
2008-06-12T12:42:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	you are mistaken again. tho synaptic could be a bad tool of course. entirely possible
2008-06-12T12:45:00.000Z	Kohlrak	wols_	seems that it may not be an option in synaptic, but it appears that i was never introduced to "apt-get source x"
2008-06-12T12:45:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	I just did above: man apt-gte
2008-08-26T11:53:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	that will lead to more problems
2008-08-26T11:54:00.000Z	Kohlrak	wols_	how can that make things worse?
2008-08-26T11:54:00.000Z	wols_	Kohlrak	if you delete config files, dpkg will assume you deleted them on purpose and not recreate them on reinstall
2008-08-26T11:56:00.000Z	Kohlrak	wols_	he wants the updated minor version... the .deb is too old for him.
2008-08-26T12:51:00.000Z	Kohlrak	wols_	isn't that an extra option of orca?
