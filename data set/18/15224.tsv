2005-04-23T16:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	but root exploits can cause more damage
2005-04-23T16:41:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	but the virii/exploit would need to know that and change itself to accom.
2005-04-23T16:43:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Burgundavia	 That's true.  But it's by default on an ubuntu system, so an exploit targeting ubuntu may take that into account.
2005-04-23T16:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	but the very diverse nature of the linux distro seen means that it wouldn't be worth it to develop an exploit for one distro
2005-04-23T16:44:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Burgundavia	Not a script, no.  But what about an individual?
2005-04-23T16:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	so you can root one box. anybody can root any box if they want to
2005-04-23T16:49:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	but a root can be broken just as easily
2005-04-23T16:51:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Burgundavia	 Don't you see more non-root vulnerabilities than otherwise?
2005-04-23T16:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	yes sort of
2005-04-23T16:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	but the reality is that any box can be cracked
2005-04-23T05:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	amarok != gtk app
2005-04-25T05:44:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Burgundavia	didn't realize it was in marilliat
2005-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	works fine
2005-04-25T06:05:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Burgundavia	xgates:  He already has xine.  No need to redundancy?
2005-04-25T06:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	totem-xine is nice and simple. Much cleaner interface
2005-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Burgundavia	 I think that's a personal preference thing
2005-04-25T07:59:00.000Z	Burgundavia	SeamusLP	marilliar
