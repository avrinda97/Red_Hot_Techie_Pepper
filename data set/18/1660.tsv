2010-12-29T22:41:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	press escape.. does any error show up?
2010-12-29T22:42:00.000Z	ntsrtrs		Have pressend Esc but it does nothing.  The cursor still keeps alternating between a pointer and the loading icon
2010-12-29T22:42:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	press ctrl - alt - f1
2010-12-29T22:44:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	does any error show up with ctrl alt f1?
2010-12-29T22:44:00.000Z	ntsrtrs	rs0832	It is now writing error codes to the screen.  'SQUASHFS' then some codes.  Do you know what this means?  thanks
2010-12-29T22:45:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	can you give me a bit more of the error?

2010-12-29T22:47:00.000Z	ntsrtrs	rs0832	Yes - "SQUASHFS error: Unable to read page, block e3c847f, size 1c917".  The next line then says "unable to read fragment cache entry [e3c847f]"
2010-12-29T22:47:00.000Z	ntsrtrs		the 2 lines just keep repeating...
2010-12-29T22:47:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	hmm id say your disc is damaged
2010-12-29T22:47:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	did you md5 check it?
2010-12-29T22:48:00.000Z	ntsrtrs	rs0832	No.  Should I check the iso file or the CD?  How do I go about this in Win7? thanks
2010-12-29T22:49:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	you can download an md5 checker (md5summer.org) and check the iso.. and burn the disc at slower speed
2010-12-29T22:50:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	check the iso and the cd once you reach the boot screen (the test disc for defects option)
2010-12-29T22:50:00.000Z	rs0832	ntsrtrs	i have to go now, so good luck... if you still have a problem, feel free to come back to the channel and ask :)
2010-12-29T22:51:00.000Z	ntsrtrs	rs0832	thanks for your help
