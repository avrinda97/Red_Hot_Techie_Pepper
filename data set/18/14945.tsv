2005-05-23T12:34:00.000Z	Devi0s		I've got two hds in my system.  when I boot with both connected to the power supply, sometimes they work.  other times, especially after the system is fully powered off instead of rebooted, the system will start to boot, and between 2 seconds and 4 minutes into the boot at various times, one of the drives will make a loud clicking sound and lock, and the os will freeze, be in Ubuntu or...

Anyone wanna take a stab at this one?  I don't know whether to buy a new power supply, motherboard, hd, etc...  Both drives pass the burn-in tests from Maxtor if only one is connected to the power supply...
2005-05-23T12:34:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	What's your PSU power?
2005-05-23T12:35:00.000Z	Devi0s	metalsand	480W
2005-05-23T12:35:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	Getting the harddrives spinning takes a lot of power to start, perahpos it's stressing your PSU power?
2005-05-23T12:35:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	That can't be it. unless you have 5000 other drives :x
2005-05-23T12:35:00.000Z	Devi0s		really? 480W not enough?  how about the power circuit - think an UPS would help?
2005-05-23T12:36:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	480 is probably enough - You don't happen to have one of the newer video cards that needs like 250w along to run, do you?
2005-05-23T12:37:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	Is it a perticular hard drive that's making the clunk? If so, does that one run fine by itself?

2005-05-23T12:38:00.000Z	Devi0s		both drives seem to run fine by themselves, but I can't confirm that it's one or the other - it doesn't thump hard enough for me to distinguish where the noise/vibration coming from
2005-05-23T12:38:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	Than I can't really give you a definitive answer :(
2005-05-23T12:39:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	If it was one that was clunking, and wasn't able to run by itself obviously it'd be the harddrive. It really doesn't seem like a lack of power so it could be the a faulty PSU...
2005-05-23T12:39:00.000Z	Devi0s	metalsand	I am gonna try getting another PSU today then...  This really pisses me off...
2005-05-23T12:40:00.000Z	Devi0s		it's one of those problems that you can spend a lot of money troubleshooting if you guess wrong
2005-05-23T12:40:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	If that's not the issue you can always return it, and then RMA your HDs to Maxtor
2005-05-23T12:40:00.000Z	Devi0s		does anyone think an APC would help, or is it drastically unlikely that the power circuit in my apartment is the problem...
2005-05-23T12:40:00.000Z	metalsand	Devi0s	I agree. I think what I just said would be the most cost effective method
