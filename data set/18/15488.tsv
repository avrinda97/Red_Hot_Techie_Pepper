2009-03-05T18:28:00.000Z	thespottedelf_		i got some nooby questions about ubuntu
2009-03-05T18:30:00.000Z	thespottedelf_		i'm going to be switchnig over to ubuntu as my main os (to make myself learn it) but i also need to have a windows install.  I've also heard that if you make an extra a partition for the home directory you can switch distrose with out losing data... so my question is what partition set up should i do when format
2009-03-05T18:31:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	just boot up windows, and stick the CD in the drive
2009-03-05T18:32:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	it will let you install Ubuntu _inside_ Windows so you don't have to mess with partitioning
2009-03-05T18:32:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	if you want to mess with partitioning, the installer will suggest good settings for resizing Windows automatically
2009-03-05T18:32:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	so you won't have to worry about that... just pick a "Guided" option
2009-03-05T18:33:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	sorry, when I said installer last, I meant the Ubuntu installer when you boot off the disk
2009-03-05T18:33:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	yea, the installer will help you with that. :)
2009-03-05T18:34:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	if I recall correctly, it'll let you pick a size for Windows.
2009-03-05T18:34:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	ahh, I see... it's best to install Windows first then
2009-03-05T18:34:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	you have three options:
2009-03-05T18:35:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	1) Use Ubuntu paritioner to create your partitions (use gparted in the menus, not the Ubuntu installer), then reboot into the Windows installer and continue there.
2009-03-05T18:35:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	2) Use Windows partitioner and installer in one go
2009-03-05T18:36:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	3) Install ubuntu first with their guided partitioning, install Windows, then reinstall GRUB (there's a guide for that)
2009-03-05T18:36:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	2) is the recommended one.
2009-03-05T18:36:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	right :)
2009-03-05T18:37:00.000Z	javaJake	thespottedelf_	you're welcome!
