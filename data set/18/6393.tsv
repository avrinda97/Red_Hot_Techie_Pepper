2012-06-15T09:29:00.000Z	Gallomimia		shutdown -r now
2012-06-15T09:30:00.000Z	Gallomimia		so.... anyone know anything about /var/run/motd(.new)
2012-06-15T09:32:00.000Z	Gallomimia		hah. now that's funny
2012-06-15T09:32:00.000Z	Gallomimia		skype 4 came out today... or yesterday?
2012-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	Gallomimia		i happened to visit the skype page and they're proudly toting skype4 for linux
2012-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	Gallomimia		i can tell you on mac and windows it looks fucking horrible so
2012-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	Gallomimia		i didn't actually!
2012-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	Gallomimia		but i had already decided to never rely upon them in a free society
2012-06-15T09:34:00.000Z	Gallomimia		well not something i follow all the time... this is quite off topic tho, and i'm still trying to figure out what the frack handles the motd files in ubuntu
2012-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	Gallomimia		i don't think iptables is a service?
2012-06-15T09:36:00.000Z	tenX	Gallomimia	right
2012-06-15T09:36:00.000Z	Gallomimia	re-sure-pus	then you've destroyed that system. backup your files and reinstall ubuntu
2012-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	Gallomimia		i don't use skype on a linux machine... as for iptables it's built into the networking portion of the kernel right?
2012-06-15T09:38:00.000Z	Gallomimia		pull the power plug out
2012-06-15T09:38:00.000Z	Gallomimia		that'll turn it off
2012-06-15T09:38:00.000Z	Gallomimia		then try to reboot
2012-06-15T09:38:00.000Z	Gallomimia		wait
2012-06-15T09:38:00.000Z	tenX	Gallomimia	interface for kernel netfilter
