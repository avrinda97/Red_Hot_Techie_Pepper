2005-11-10T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	LaSSarD	when you change your monitor, you can "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" if you need, to change settings
2005-11-10T09:57:00.000Z	LaSSarD	tritium	yes i know that... actually it's not for me, it's for my friend and he's too newbie to do that
2005-11-10T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	LaSSarD	he should be fine
2005-11-10T09:58:00.000Z	LaSSarD	tritium	thanks :)
2005-11-10T10:01:00.000Z	tritium	LaSSarD	I believe you can use gnome-volume manager with xfce, but I've never used xfce, so it's just hearsay to me
2005-11-10T10:01:00.000Z	LaSSarD	tritium	thanks in advance ;)
2005-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	tritium	LaSSarD	please, that's the third time you've used that word.  Try not to please
