2009-09-28T06:45:00.000Z	mo0nykit		Just a quick question, no need to elaborate. Why is the kernel written in C and not C++?
2009-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	I dunno, why don't you go ask the kernel.org people?
2009-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	mo0nykit	MenZa	thanks.. what is the freenode channel for kernel.org?
2009-09-28T06:47:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	There is none.
2009-09-28T06:47:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	Kernel.org is the official Linux kernel repository. I don't think you'll get a very nice answer though, but rather get written off as a troll.
2009-09-28T06:48:00.000Z	mo0nykit	MenZa	hehe.. well if there is no channel supported by kernel.org, what freenode channel discusses the Linux kernel?
2009-09-28T06:48:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	None, officially, Try ##linux, though.
2009-09-28T06:48:00.000Z	mo0nykit	MenZa	okay thanks
2009-09-28T06:49:00.000Z	mo0nykit	MenZa	why does it have two pound-signs? ##linux ?
2009-09-28T06:49:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	It's an unofficial channel. See !freenode.
2009-09-28T08:18:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	Have you tried #xchat
2009-10-11T05:17:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	What do you need help with?
2009-10-11T05:18:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	You'll need to login to edit - and as far as I cant ell, that requires a !launchpad account these days.
2009-10-11T05:20:00.000Z	mo0nykit	MenZa	I have been able to log to edit a wiki. But I don't know where to type in my solution. I'm looking to contribute something related to the following topics http://paste.ubuntu.com/290415/
2009-10-11T05:21:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	Read at the top - it says "Login to Edit" - alternatively "Edit" if you are logged in
2009-10-11T05:23:00.000Z	mo0nykit	MenZa	yes I have already logged in. I need help on where to contribute. It's related to the three topics I listed. There is probably an #ubuntuwiki channel or something. Like #blenderwiki for blender
2009-10-11T05:23:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	I don't think there is one, no.
2009-10-11T05:24:00.000Z	MenZa	mo0nykit	What Flannel said.
