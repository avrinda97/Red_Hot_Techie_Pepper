2007-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	?really... I'ev gotten a few repeats, but its great
2007-02-27T06:02:00.000Z	spasticteapot	IndyGunFreak	Same four levels...over and over and over.
2007-02-27T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	guess i've never noticed
2007-02-27T06:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	i've never had any probs with it(although I do prefer Gnome)
2007-02-27T06:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	if you're a fan of the old breakout game, install LBreakout2
2007-02-27T06:20:00.000Z	spasticteapot	IndyGunFreak	I've been in bed for the past two days with pretty much nothing but a Thinkpad.
2007-02-27T06:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	lbreakout2 is cool, i love the old breakout game... and i tworks great.. but it might be hard to play with a touchpad
2007-02-27T06:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	what about planet penguin racer?
2007-02-27T06:23:00.000Z	spasticteapot	IndyGunFreak	I keep missing the stupid herring....
2007-02-27T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	another one i like, is Ksnakerace
2007-02-27T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	its annoyinglys imple, but gets very hard.. and with a touchpad, it might be hard
2007-02-27T06:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	spasticteapot	have you tried sudokus.. or whatever they're called.
2007-02-27T06:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	IndyGunFreak	I'm in calculus. Math...baaad.
