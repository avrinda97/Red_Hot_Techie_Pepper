2010-04-25T23:07:00.000Z	CloudLevi		Seriously, people...how do I get Pidgin to work like Empathy?
2010-04-25T23:08:00.000Z	h00k	CloudLevi	I'm not exactly sure what you mean 'to work like,' they are two very different programs
2010-04-25T23:09:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Empathy was tied to and controlled by the OS. The commands are still there (Session controls at the top right corner as well as away-on-screensaver), but I uninstalled Empathy
2010-04-26T00:14:00.000Z	h00k	CloudLevi	do you happen to be on Lucid?
2010-04-26T00:15:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Okay, without sauntering off with the words "I'll take that as a no," please explain to me WHAT Lucid is.
2010-04-26T00:16:00.000Z	h00k	CloudLevi	It happens, it's alright.
2010-04-26T00:18:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	okay...it wasn't THAT bad, but it was unstable enough to scare me out of Lucid, considering I wanted working drivers and WINE.
2010-04-26T00:18:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Irony is I'm using the beta of WINE I believe.........
2010-04-26T00:20:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Oh *GOD* ...tell me...please...PLEASE tell me that in uninstalling Empathy I did NOT delete all my chat logs!!!
2010-04-26T00:20:00.000Z	h00k	CloudLevi	nah, they're still there.
2010-04-26T00:20:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Where? x_X; will they load into Pidgin? x_x
2010-04-26T00:21:00.000Z	h00k	CloudLevi	I'm not sure if they will nicely or not, they are in one of your hidden folders, ~/.local/share/Empathy
2010-04-26T00:23:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	...so the IAS controls keep logging me OUT
2010-04-26T00:24:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Every single time I use the IAS to control Pidgin, it logs me out of MSN... =_=
2010-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	h00k	CloudLevi	I have no idea, I haven't used Pidgin in a while
2010-04-26T00:31:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	Ugh...now the IAS won't change off green at all...
2010-04-26T00:33:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	At least it doesn't kill MSN every time I use it... =-=;;; I'll have to deal with it later. Each and every problem I have with it appears to be the result of either of two user errors: Not restarting /// leaving something on during installation...
2010-04-26T07:18:00.000Z	CloudLevi	h00k	How do I stick stuff in the programs drop-down for Wine? =_=;;;
