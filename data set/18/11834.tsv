2007-10-27T20:03:00.000Z	DBAlex		Hey
2007-10-27T20:03:00.000Z	DBAlex		im installing ubuntu as we speak on my laptop
2007-10-27T20:03:00.000Z	DBAlex		which filesystem do I use?
2007-10-27T20:03:00.000Z	DBAlex		and do I need a swap partition, and how big should it be in MB?
2007-10-27T20:04:00.000Z	DBAlex		I have 1024mb ram
2007-10-27T20:04:00.000Z	DBAlex		1GB
2007-10-27T20:04:00.000Z	DBAlex		what filesystem do I use for the SWAP and for UBUNTU?
2007-10-27T20:04:00.000Z	DBAlex		ext2 or 3?
2007-10-27T20:04:00.000Z	jrib	DBAlex	swap
2007-10-27T20:07:00.000Z	jrib	DBAlex	you need swap to suspend
2007-10-27T20:11:00.000Z	jrib	DBAlex	you want the partition you boot from to be primary.  If you only need 4 or less partitions, just make them all primary
2007-10-27T20:11:00.000Z	DBAlex	jrib	ok thankyou, does swap need a mount point?
2007-10-27T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	DBAlex	no
2007-10-27T20:14:00.000Z	DBAlex	jrib	Why would it say that 1167 is unusable?
2007-10-27T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	DBAlex	don't know
2007-10-27T20:14:00.000Z	DBAlex	jrib	should I resize a different partition to use as swap?
2007-10-27T20:15:00.000Z	jrib	DBAlex	you can create a swap partition however you want I suppose
2007-10-27T20:15:00.000Z	DBAlex	jrib	ok
