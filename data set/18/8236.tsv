2008-01-12T03:39:00.000Z	Draggin		Can anyone help me get my Ubuntu back to life? I just messed up in trying to prepare for the upgrade to Gutsy
2008-01-12T03:41:00.000Z	Draggin		How do I install a standard nVdiia driver if I can't get into Ubuntu (GUI) at all?
2008-01-12T03:43:00.000Z	Draggin		No - nvidia-glx-new is too new - I have a Geforce 4 card
2008-01-12T03:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	is Ubuntu actualy installed, or are you trying to runt he Live CD?
2008-01-12T03:44:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- yes, Ubuntu (feisty) is fully installed and was fully functional until I tried fixing stuff to prepare for upgrading to Gutsy from the alternate CD
2008-01-12T03:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	why not just do a clean install?
2008-01-12T03:45:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- because I have a crapload of files and programmes running - don't want to reformat everything
2008-01-12T03:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	wel, regardless, you'd be wise to make a backup before upgrading, if thats the case..... just in case something goes haywire
2008-01-12T03:46:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- I did make a backup of the most important stuff and hope I won't lose them anyway, but it should still be less effort upgrading than reformatting
2008-01-12T03:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	i guess thats where i disagree, i find clean installing much easier.
2008-01-12T03:47:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- dude, how long does that take?  Do you know how many packages I would have to get, reconfigure, etc. etc. all over again...
2008-01-12T03:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	i can setup any of my systems in roughly an hour.. install all packages i use, remove packages I don't, and transfer data from my backup to my install.... then I usually spend about 10-15min setting up programs like xchat, pidgin, etc.
2008-01-12T03:49:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- I'm rather new to Linux, so all of that will take me about a week :)  That's why I want to upgrade
2008-01-12T03:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	did you at least take notes?
2008-01-12T03:52:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- notes of what?
2008-01-12T03:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Draggin	things you done to make things work, etc.
2008-01-12T03:52:00.000Z	Draggin	IndyGunFreak	- yeah, saved all the sites and howtos that I used to get things up and running
