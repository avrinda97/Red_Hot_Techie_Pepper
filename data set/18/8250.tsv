2008-05-06T18:06:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	I wasn't aware there was a gui package for imagemagick.
2008-05-06T18:07:00.000Z	zgmf-x20a	pajamian	ikonia, o i see.  crap.  lol.  either of you guys know an app that will allow me to do pdf to jpeg image conversions????
2008-05-06T18:08:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	almost any image editor, but for bulk conversions imagemagick is really best, just use it from the terminal.
2008-05-06T18:08:00.000Z	zgmf-x20a	pajamian	realyyy....... argh....
2008-05-06T18:09:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	there are probably gui packages that do bulk conversions, I'm just used to doing some things on the command line.
2008-05-06T18:10:00.000Z	zgmf-x20a	pajamian	yahhh,,, like gimp will do it, but its one at a time, which sucks
2008-05-06T18:10:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	at the end of the day, batch conversions like that really do work best on the command line.  You just need to get used to it.
2008-05-06T18:13:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	and to expand on what fiyawerx just told you, if you want to convert all the pdf files in a directory just do: for x in *.pdf; do convert $x ${x/.pdf/.jpg}; done
2008-05-06T18:19:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	are you sure you spelled the filenames correctly?  realize that case does matter in Linux.
2008-05-06T18:21:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	does the filename contain any funny characters or spaces?
2008-05-06T18:23:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	no, but the spaces will.  enclose the filename in single-quotes like this: 'Business Guide - Law.pdf'
2008-05-06T18:23:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	do that to both the pdf and jpg filenames.
2008-05-06T18:28:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	what is the exact command you gave for imagemagick?
2008-05-06T18:29:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	do what unop just said
2008-05-06T18:32:00.000Z	zgmf-x20a	pajamian	... ooooooooooo mannnnnnnnn... hahaha, so i did what unop just said, and same thing, pressed enter, and nothing happens, checked directory, and no files created.
2008-05-06T18:33:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	paste the exact commadn you typed into here again
2008-05-06T18:35:00.000Z	pajamian	zgmf-x20a	what unop just said, you only had part of the command.
