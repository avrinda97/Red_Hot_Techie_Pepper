2005-08-31T08:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		google is getting some very handy tools out.  Picisa2 - saved my wife a lot of time.
2005-08-31T08:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		grub has a feature where it can rember what you last selected.
2005-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		it rembers the last item you booted to noodle .   any other way would be odd. ;p what if you had 100 entries.. :P you may be able to MAke your grub menus change the default for the next boot. not sure how..
2005-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I find that it alwyas defaults to the WRONG os whatever i do.
2005-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		:P
2005-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		i just set the timeout to be somthing real long. like 60 sec.. so i can be sure to catch it and tell it what to boot to
2005-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		i find it hard to belive that you KNOW you want to go from Linux/windows/linux/windows regullary. :P
2005-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		actually i think theres a way you can shutdown linux, and tell it what os to reboot to.
2005-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		seen that in some disrtos.. Not sure how they did it however.
2005-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		must of been some tweaking of the grub.conf right befor it reboots.
2005-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	sproingie	Dr_Willis	it's not hard to set the next boot from linux
2005-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	sproingie	Dr_Willis	good luck doing it from windows.  i don't know if grub even reads fat
2005-08-31T08:30:00.000Z	sproingie	Dr_Willis	you could put /boot on a fat partition, or do something with colinux on windows.  either hack seems a little bit of a steep price
2005-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	sproingie	Dr_Willis	i love the hell out of freebsd, but linux loves my hardware a litle more
2005-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sproingie	 :P
2005-11-23T11:12:00.000Z	sproingie	Dr_Willis	yeah, tho it looks very moddable.  still, i think alpha centauri is still firaxis's best work, and apparently it's never to be topped
2005-11-23T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sproingie	 yea. I seem to have played AlpCent. More then any of the others.. They did keep a lot of AC's good points.
2005-11-23T11:14:00.000Z	sproingie	Dr_Willis	the civics remind me a lot of social engineering
