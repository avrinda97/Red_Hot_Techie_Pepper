2011-02-23T09:14:00.000Z	joljam		I am desperately in need of help. My colleague using a windows machine wants to see my ubuntu desktop. I googled and found that tighvnc was the software to use. However, after installing it and typing in my ip address which starts with 192.168..... my friend gets the message that the connection cannot be established
2011-02-23T09:14:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	well, if your friend is outside of your LAN, then it won't work that way
2011-02-23T09:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	use: http://www.whatismyip.com/
2011-02-23T09:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	alternatively, your router's page should tell you your global ip
2011-02-23T09:16:00.000Z	joljam	gaelfx	thanks let me check
2011-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	oh, another thing that might help is making sure that upnp is enabled on your router
2011-02-23T09:18:00.000Z	joljam	gaelfx	I am bit ignorant on this: how can I go to my routers webpage
2011-02-23T09:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	go to 192.168.1.1 in your browser
2011-02-23T09:20:00.000Z	joljam	gaelfx	thanks
2011-02-23T09:20:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	no prob
2011-02-23T09:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	how's comcast's service for you?
2011-02-23T09:21:00.000Z	joljam	gaelfx	its ok
2011-02-23T09:24:00.000Z	joljam	gaelfx	I typed in 192.168.1.1 in my browser but I got the message Problem loading page
2011-02-23T09:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	did whatismyip not work for you?
2011-02-23T09:26:00.000Z	joljam	gaelfx	i failed to realise that the IP address was given in the top itself for whatismyip
2011-02-23T09:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	haha, that's ok. so you found it?
2011-02-23T09:28:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	no, as long as you have upnp enabled on your router, it should be fine
2011-02-23T09:29:00.000Z	gaelfx	joljam	what does your machine say your ip is?
