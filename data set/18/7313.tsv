2008-09-01T01:59:00.000Z	Hexxeh		and upon trying to do anything with the drive it says "Error unable to open /dev/sda - unrecognized disk label."
2008-09-01T01:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	run sudo fdisk -l
2008-09-01T01:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	it'll tell you wha labels you have
2008-09-01T02:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	run the command and do us a pastebin of the utput

2008-09-01T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	your sda looks screwed, id scan it to attempt to repair it
2008-09-01T02:03:00.000Z	Hexxeh	ActionParsnip	I know it's screwed, I'm trying to repair it.
2008-09-01T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	id run fsck on it
2008-09-01T02:04:00.000Z	Hexxeh	ActionParsnip	It's NTFS and it's the partition table that has died.
2008-09-01T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	hmm, then i gots no idea, you could try to recover the docs then reinstall but i dont have much hope for getting it bootable etc
2011-05-31T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	try the boot option: nomodeset
2011-05-31T22:08:00.000Z	Hexxeh	ActionParsnip	I'm not even getting that far, if I put the disc in, reboot I get a constant black screen and the disc gets ejected
2011-05-31T22:08:00.000Z	Hexxeh	ActionParsnip	Not getting to a grub prompt or anything
2011-05-31T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	did you MD5 test the ISO you burned?
2011-05-31T22:08:00.000Z	Hexxeh	ActionParsnip	yep and verified disc burn
2011-05-31T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hexxeh	cool, well I have zero experience of max as my sense outweighs my cash
