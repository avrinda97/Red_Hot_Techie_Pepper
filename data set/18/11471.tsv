2009-06-26T08:21:00.000Z	bruenig		windows 7 and ubuntu are basically the same thing
2009-06-26T08:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	Windows 7 and Ubuntu are two completly different operating systems!
2009-06-26T08:23:00.000Z	bruenig	sebsebseb	but at their root, basically the same
2009-07-19T04:54:00.000Z	bruenig	sebsebseb	giggle eh?
2009-07-19T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	that channel, no silly
2009-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	he dosan't have Ubuntu on the computer he is installing on yet
2009-07-19T07:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	I disagree, since 8.10 is better than 9.04 in certain ways :)
2009-07-19T07:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	and he can do a clean install of both computers  with Ubuntu 9.10 when that's out
2009-07-19T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	sebsebseb	clean installing in 3 months is obnoxious
2009-07-19T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	sebsebseb	who wants to go through and tinker and reconfigure everything in 3 months right after you have finished
2009-07-19T07:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	no it's  a good thing to do since Ext4 is the default file system :)  better than Ext3
2009-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	bruenig	sebsebseb	hi
2009-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	hi
2009-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	bruenig	sebsebseb	hi
2010-06-27T06:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	well it is for Ubuntu newbies and such
2010-06-27T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	if you want to  try and help Uboy feel free
2010-06-27T06:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bruenig	it seems he has tried that, and that won't even work
