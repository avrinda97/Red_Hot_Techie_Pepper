2010-06-10T02:14:00.000Z	face		I got a Wireless WN311B Wireless adapter
2010-06-10T02:14:00.000Z	face		It's Netgear brand.
2010-06-10T02:14:00.000Z	face		The problem is, this specific type of adapter doesn't contain the
2010-06-10T02:15:00.000Z	face		drivers within
2010-06-10T02:15:00.000Z	face		I was told to open the .exe file, and extract from there the .sys and .inf files.
2010-06-10T02:15:00.000Z	face		Problem is, I did this, and it doesn't seem to work.
2010-06-10T02:16:00.000Z	face		Okay.
2010-06-10T02:16:00.000Z	face		I bought the router, but I can't find the drivers.
2010-06-10T02:16:00.000Z	face		 Nobody has them online - that I can find - and the CD that came with
2010-06-10T02:16:00.000Z	face		only has a .exe file inside.
