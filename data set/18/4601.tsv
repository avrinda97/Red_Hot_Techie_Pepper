2009-03-19T20:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	it's already set up. you just add the users
2009-03-19T20:02:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	no, a multi-user system where more then 1 user works at the same time on a single system
2009-03-19T20:06:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	any idea's on how to realize that?
2009-03-19T20:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	no. :)
2009-03-19T20:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	you mean when people edit the same file at the same time?
2009-03-19T20:07:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	no. I have 2 keyboards, 2 mouses, 2 screens and 1 computer. The final solution would result in 2 people using the same computer with their own mouse and keyboard.
2009-03-19T20:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	ah, sounds doable. but i have no idea how
2009-03-19T20:08:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	i'm in a rather similar position. Mdm seems to be rather tough to setup, since i managed to break my system with it every time.
2009-03-27T18:45:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	if i may be so bold, his resolv.conf might be broken due to his graphical session not getting logged in properly. Doing this in a recovery mode would give no problems.
2009-03-27T19:08:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	FernandF what does the error hold exactly?
2009-03-27T19:09:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	did you check if the driver is set in xorg.conf and stuff?
2009-03-27T19:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	no, be my guest. i once solved the problem with .ICEauthority. shame it took forever to change the perms back to normal.
2009-03-27T19:10:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	it can be a pain, yes.
2009-03-27T19:11:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	there's 2 other causes that i know off, one is a wrong video driver and the other is a full HD.
2009-03-27T19:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	yeah, heard of those.
2009-03-27T19:22:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	prince_jammys	would you be so kind to let him check if his hard disk is full? I'm building a second system atm, so i'm afraid i'll have to leave the helping to you.
2009-03-27T19:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	s3r3n1t7	go for it. you take over. my two short checks took a couple of hours
