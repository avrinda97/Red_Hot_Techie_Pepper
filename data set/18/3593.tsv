2009-09-08T08:31:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	did you have a question about Linux home automation?
2009-09-08T08:32:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	fire away...
2009-09-08T08:34:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	I've used X-10 modules to do it. I bought a CM11a module from Smarthome.com. I control it using "heyu", an open-source program.
2009-09-08T08:36:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	I was hoping the ZigBee stuff would be cheaper and work better. I haven't bought any ZigBee stuff yet, because it's pretty pricy.
2009-09-08T08:37:00.000Z	joejc	RichN	 so x10 is the best way to go atleast as far as price?
2009-09-08T08:38:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	I think so. Smarthome.com has occasional deals where you can buy lamp and appliance modules for under $10, which is where they should be all the time.
2009-09-08T08:38:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	the CM11a module is kinda steep, though (I think ~$60). It connects to your 9-pin serial port.
2009-09-08T08:44:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	A friend of mine bought the USB module for his Macintosh. Don't know if it's the same you posted.
2009-09-08T08:47:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	if you can get the CM11 in decent condition, it'd be worth it (esp at $10!). The heyu program can take a schedule file (that you write) and compile into macros and load it in the CM11 so that your computer doesn't have to be on.

2009-09-08T08:50:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	you have 25-pin serial?
2009-09-08T08:52:00.000Z	joejc	RichN	is it pink?
2009-09-08T08:54:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	The CM11a comes with a cable. One end looks like a phone jack, the other is a 9-pin serial port connector. Recent computers may no longer have 9-pin serial port connectors, but you can get a 9-pin to USB adapter.
2009-09-08T08:55:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	I don't know about "pink" though.
2009-09-08T08:55:00.000Z	joejc	RichN	where the printer cable would plugin before usb was used for everything?
2009-09-08T08:57:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	The printer cables (before USB) had 25-pin connectors. Serial ports used to have 25-pin connectors, too, but then went to smaller 9-pin connectors.
2009-09-08T09:01:00.000Z	RichN	joejc	gce: gotta go. Good luck, joejc!
2009-09-08T09:01:00.000Z	joejc	RichN	thanks for ur help
