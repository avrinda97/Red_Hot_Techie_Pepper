2006-05-27T10:43:00.000Z	dave__		I was messing around earlier trying to repair my openoffice install and I messed something up.
2006-05-27T10:43:00.000Z	dave__		when I run apt-get update I get a bunch of errors
2006-05-27T10:44:00.000Z	dave__		specifically, when I run apt-get update it tells me it couldn't stat source package
2006-05-27T10:44:00.000Z	dave__		five or six different packages
2006-05-27T10:44:00.000Z	dave__		how do I fix it?
2006-05-27T10:45:00.000Z	dave__		sol huh?  thanks anyway
2006-05-27T10:46:00.000Z	dave__		I'm going to restart x and see if that helps... thanks for everything
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	dave__		not apt-get dist-upgrade, but I did get the other two... sad thing is apt-get update tells me to run apt-get update
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	haha yup, you have a bad repository
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	comment out ones that aren't legit for now
2006-05-27T10:48:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	know how to edit /etc/apt/sources.list?
2006-05-27T10:50:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	when you run apt-get update, it loads a list of the stuff on the websites listed in that file
2006-05-27T10:50:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	but if one of those sites are bad, then the entire thing will complain
2006-05-27T10:51:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	yeah, you know how to do that?
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	apt-get dist-upgrade, although I doubt that will do anything
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	did you comment out the wine repository?
2006-05-27T11:06:00.000Z	dave__	NickGarvey	I don't have any wine repositories lised
2006-05-27T11:21:00.000Z	NickGarvey	dave__	highlight, and then middleclick where you want pasted
