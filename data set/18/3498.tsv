2009-12-23T06:18:00.000Z	ImJJames		so i installed xubuntu 9.10 on a old armada e500 with no problems everyhting works good and looks good
2009-12-23T06:18:00.000Z	ImJJames		so I installed xbuntu 9.10 on my other laptop and screen flickers what can be causing that
2009-12-23T06:19:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	how do you mean flickers?
2009-12-23T06:19:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	check the connections of the monitor and the power cable? :P
2009-12-23T06:19:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	is the screen resolution/refresh rate right?
2009-12-23T06:21:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	then it should be your refresh rate thats causing the problem, or, the resolution isnt correct, what is the resolution set up in counter-strike?
2009-12-23T06:21:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	try setting the desktop resolution in counterstrike and see if it flickers then
2009-12-23T06:22:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	then it's the refresh rate
2009-12-23T06:22:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	hmmm that is strange :S
2009-12-23T06:23:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	you might want to ask someone else as im not a guru here, just waiting for my install to finish :P
2009-12-23T06:52:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	thats linux :P
2009-12-23T06:53:00.000Z	kyle6513	ImJJames	right click on the desktop, change desktop background and in the visual effects tab change it to none, atleast i think thats what that guide is telling you
