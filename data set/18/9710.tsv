2007-08-01T13:28:00.000Z	samuel		when I use VIM to edit a file , I can't always see the file name. who can tell me how to resolve that ? thx
2007-08-01T13:28:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	ctrl-g will tell you which file
2007-08-01T13:29:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	or enable the status line
2007-08-01T13:29:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	np
2007-08-01T13:32:00.000Z	samuel	m4n	enable the status line , could you tell me how to write the command ?
2007-08-01T13:32:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	let me check
2007-08-01T13:35:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	i did the searching work for you.. even I didnt know how to do that exactly. here is an example. http://m.mongers.org/pub/dotfiles/vimrc
2007-08-01T13:35:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	set statusline=%-F%-m%-h%-r%-y\ buf\ %-n%=line\ %l,\ col\ %-2c\ %p%%
2007-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	samuel	m4n	I tried command "set statusline=%-F%-m%-h%-r%-y\ buf\ %-n%=line\ %l,\ col\ %-2c\ %p%%", but it is not available
2007-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	i doubt if you are on vim itself. could be vi
2007-08-01T13:38:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	in any case, ctrl-g should show the info
2007-08-01T13:40:00.000Z	samuel	m4n	I confirm I am in  "VIM - Vi IMproved 7.0" by using command version.
2007-08-01T13:40:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	and you did :set statuline.... ?
2007-08-01T13:41:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	put that in ~/.vimrc and start a vim. see if you see the details
2007-08-01T13:42:00.000Z	samuel	m4n	let me try .thx
2007-08-01T13:51:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	try removing parts.. may be not all of them supported
2007-08-01T13:51:00.000Z	m4n	samuel	and I am not sure which one is for filename :)
2007-08-01T13:53:00.000Z	samuel	m4n	I see . i will try to find out  the other way . thx
