2007-12-19T21:56:00.000Z	diagon		ok, I've got a desktop computer with no internet access, and a fresh install of ubuntu 6.06... I'm on my laptop here, with internet access, and what I'd like is to get a bunch of extra packages onto the desktop computer via a CD
2007-12-19T21:56:00.000Z	diagon		I'm trying to figure out the best way to do that.
2007-12-19T21:57:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	what packages? stuff for wireless etc?
2007-12-19T21:57:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	no, stuff like j2re and flash
2007-12-19T21:59:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	you might be able to do that--though it would be tricky; is this an older desktop? any reason not to use gutsy? also, why not get an extra ethernet cable or take the one from the desktop to do it?
2007-12-19T22:00:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	I think the reason was that I couldn't find it on torrent maybe :/
2007-12-19T22:00:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	could you answer all my questions please
2007-12-19T22:01:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	it's slightly older, and I can't think of any reason, and I don't have an ethernet cable (nor any money. selling the desktop to make rent.) :/
2007-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	so could you turn off the desktop and use that connection for the laptop?
2007-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	that would be the fastest solution--least headaches
2007-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	er.. the laptop has the wireless card, the desktop is internetless
2007-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	it's also not my wireless :/
2007-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	how are you connecting right now? :}
2007-12-19T22:03:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	neighbor's wireless
2007-12-19T22:03:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	but anyhow, okay. gutsy will be the solution probably
2007-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	will the computer without the internet ever get internet--or will it be a home media center type of deal
2007-12-19T22:05:00.000Z	diagon	bazhang	thanks for the help, I think I'll just bring it to 7.10 and leave a note on the desktop on how to use synaptic
2007-12-19T22:05:00.000Z	bazhang	diagon	if you need further assistance we'll be here :]
