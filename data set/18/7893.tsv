2008-05-10T09:06:00.000Z	bpat1434		Is there a special way to use adesklets?  I select a desklet to download, and it seems like it freezes when it tries to download
2008-05-10T09:07:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	if you have compiz i sincerely recommend using screenlets
2008-05-10T09:07:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	I have "extra" screen effects... is that compiz?
2008-05-10T09:07:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	yep
2008-05-10T09:08:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	where can I configure screenlets and get more?
2008-05-10T09:08:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	well first of all be sure to have the compizconfig-settings-manager package installed
2008-05-10T09:09:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	installed
2008-05-10T09:10:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	alright under system->preferences you should have "advanced desktop effects settings"
2008-05-10T09:11:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	uh huh
2008-05-10T09:12:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	first of all you can configure how your desktop effects work there, but more importantly, under "desktop" there's the widget layer, you should enable it
2008-05-10T09:12:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	enabled...
2008-05-10T09:13:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	alright, gimme a sec
2008-05-10T09:13:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	okay
2008-05-10T09:21:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	gimme just another moment
2008-05-10T09:21:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	okay
2008-05-10T09:24:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	all you need to do is install the screenlets package, and then run it from system->preferences->screenlets
2008-05-10T09:24:00.000Z	Ademan	bpat1434	it even has a little button for getting more screenlets, and there are some available on gnome-look.org as well
2008-05-10T09:26:00.000Z	bpat1434	Ademan	okay, thanks
