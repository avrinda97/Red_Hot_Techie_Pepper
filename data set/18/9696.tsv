2007-10-07T06:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	Right click play in movie player ( totem ) then totem will grab the codecs and it should play in your browser fine after that
2007-10-07T07:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	Does it play in totem?
2007-10-07T07:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	If so are you using the totem firefox plugin?
2007-10-07T07:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	Does the movie play in totem?
2007-10-07T07:03:00.000Z	blockcipher	Jordan_U_	no video just audio
2007-10-07T07:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	Ok, so you just need the right codec, probably w33codecs since it can't be installed by default
2007-10-07T07:08:00.000Z	blockcipher	Jordan_U_	AirBender : tried another file as well didnt work...
2007-10-07T07:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	install gstreamer0.10-pitfdll
2007-10-07T07:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	Then install w32codecs from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2007-10-07T07:12:00.000Z	blockcipher	Jordan_U_	i already did :(  I know...what a pain right? lol
2007-10-07T07:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	You already have pitfdll installed also?
2007-10-07T07:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	blockcipher	Can you give a link to a movie that won't play ( So I can see If it plays for me ) ?
