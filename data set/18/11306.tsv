2006-08-20T07:55:00.000Z	pluma		Where should I put the Sun JDK directory? Surely not /usr/jdk1.5.0_08/, right?
2006-08-20T07:57:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	either symlink java to somewhere in your path, or add the dir to your path
2006-08-20T07:59:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	figures. But it's the first distro that doesn't screw up my mouse. I don't know what driver it uses, but even after checking ALL available drivers on, e.g., Debian the mouse would still act quirky (random jumping etc).
2006-08-20T08:00:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	did you change the battery in it before you installed ubuntu?
2006-08-20T08:00:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	Nope. No battery. It's a cable one.
2006-08-20T08:00:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	Logitech optical with cable.
2006-08-20T08:00:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	weird, is it running through a kvm or something?
2006-08-20T08:01:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	yepp
2006-08-20T08:01:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	that sucks, i have a bunch of usb mice for just that reason...this old kvm doesn't like mine either
2006-08-20T08:01:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	However, Ubuntu recognised it instantly. With the other distros even trying all drivers manually didn't work.
2006-08-20T08:01:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	ironically though i had more issues in windows than linux
2006-08-20T08:02:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	how odd
2006-08-20T08:03:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	Ubuntu feels a bit too user-friendly sometimes (this is after about a week of using it). I mean that in the same sense I mean it for WinXP.
2006-08-20T08:04:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	Also I've come to realise I loathe KDE. GNOME is so much prettier.
2006-08-20T08:16:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	mount
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	verbose	pluma	man hier
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	ta
2006-08-20T11:27:00.000Z	pluma	verbose	lynx is like telnet
