2007-02-25T10:53:00.000Z	Iced		Hey everybody
2007-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	Iced		Guys, do you mind if I ask some questions?
2007-02-25T10:55:00.000Z	Iced		First: Is easy ubuntu safe?
2007-02-25T10:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	I don't like it
2007-02-25T10:56:00.000Z	Iced	ikonia	What shouldI use instead? Or should I do it manually? (I haven't even installed ubuntu yet, I'm downloading it)
2007-02-25T10:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	just install ubuntu
2007-02-25T10:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	don't use that
2007-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	use the boot cd
2007-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	its beta software and poor
2007-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	its flakey - beta software
2007-02-25T11:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	just use the boot cd
2007-02-25T11:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	all the more reason to use stable install techniques - rather than dodgy beta software
2007-02-25T11:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	burn the cd and boot from it
2007-02-25T11:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	read the docs on http://www.ubuntu.com
2007-02-25T11:06:00.000Z	Iced	ikonia	Thank you
2007-02-25T11:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	you have to set them up
2007-02-25T11:10:00.000Z	Iced	ikonia	Great
2007-02-25T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Iced	windows doesn't do it for you
