2006-11-01T16:59:00.000Z	sethk		SeanTater, right, I forgot that
2006-11-01T16:59:00.000Z	sparr	sethk	you realize the default sh changed to dash from bash in the latest ubuntu release?
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	no I didn't notice, because I don't use either.
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sparr	sethk	interesting.  whats your sh?
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	but that's good, bash has poor ksh compatibility
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	zsh
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sparr		hmm
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sparr		didnt know zsh provided sh capability
2006-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	which isn't to say that there aren't other good shells, but that's the one I like.
2006-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	yes, it has compatibility modes for ksh, sh, cshell, even bash if you have scripts with bash nuttiness in them.
2006-11-02T17:01:00.000Z	sparr		interesting.  faster than dash?
2006-11-02T17:01:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	I think you type the fewest characters with zsh.  I haven't used dash much, though.  I assume it's the default because it's low overhead.
2006-11-02T17:02:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	might be the dash from busybox, I'll have to check.
2006-11-02T17:02:00.000Z	sparr	sethk	err, i mean faster for running scripts.  thats why i use dash instead of bash for sh, it cuts minutes off some long scripts
2006-11-02T17:02:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	right, just startup time would be a lot quicker
2006-11-02T17:03:00.000Z	sparr	sethk	openoffice 'configure' script runs over a minute faster in dash than bash  :)
2006-11-02T17:03:00.000Z	sethk	sparr	interesting.
