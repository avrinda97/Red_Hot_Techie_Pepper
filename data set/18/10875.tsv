2008-06-06T17:03:00.000Z	hammad		Aaronh ? do you know how to install ATi driver manual or deinstall it ?
2008-06-06T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	after the driver installation, did you reboot?
2008-06-06T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	how did you determine that the driver isn't active?
2008-06-06T17:05:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	'glxinfo | grep -i render'
2008-06-06T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	or run 'glxgears' and say what framerate it gives
2008-06-06T17:08:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	don't paste in this channel
2008-06-06T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	do you get any output from 'grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf'?
2008-06-06T17:10:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	did you type exactly what I said?
2008-06-06T17:11:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	do you get any output from 'grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf'?
2008-06-06T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	okay, you haven't activated the ATI driver yet. Go to System-Administration-Hardware Drivers
2008-06-06T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	and enable the ATI driver
2008-06-06T17:15:00.000Z	soundray	hammad	please /join #ubuntu-de -- I'll try and help you ther
