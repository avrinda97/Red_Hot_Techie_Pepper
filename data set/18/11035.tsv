2011-10-01T02:35:00.000Z	pi_		let me explain it again
2011-10-01T02:35:00.000Z	pi_		to make it more clear
2011-10-01T02:36:00.000Z	pi_		Im using ubuntu 11.04 when i try to connect to the net via proxy i get the following output: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/707/wontwork.jpg/ "Connection timeout" after the browser tried to open the site for 5-10min ~.I set up two different virtual machines. One of them exists for the sole purpose of making sure that the other one does not accidentally connect to the internet except through my proxy. i used "damn small linux for it",
2011-10-01T02:36:00.000Z	pi_		other Virtual Machine is safe. the second virtual machine isconfigured in such a way that it can only use the proxy and nothing else for all internet connections.
2011-10-01T02:37:00.000Z	pi_		i already said it, its damn small linux for firewall and for mainOS its ubuntu 11.04
2011-10-01T02:39:00.000Z	pi_		np
2011-10-01T02:40:00.000Z	pi_		No one knows what could fix it?
2011-10-01T02:42:00.000Z	pi_		Im doing it for a reason
2011-10-01T02:42:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	sounds like you set up your proxy wrong
2011-10-01T02:42:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	or the virtual network
2011-10-01T02:43:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	i guess there is a host only network between the vm's and one vm should connect to the internet via the other, which is using the host as the default route
2011-10-01T02:45:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	not a terribly simple setup, you should detail your actual configuration more, rather than showing just a screenshot of some ip's etc
2011-10-01T02:47:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	yes, it is not really sufficient
2011-10-01T02:48:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	or you connect to the public tor network via the dsl vm?
2011-10-01T02:51:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	try drawing a picture of your desired network setup or something.. it's too difficult to guess what you have done and what you actually want to acheive
2011-10-01T02:51:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	so you connect to tor on windows then start your vm's?
2011-10-01T02:54:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	the screen shot shows you trying to create an ssh tunnle (i think), where does that fit into the picture?
2011-10-01T02:55:00.000Z	mrintegrity	pi_	sorry, good luck with it. i have to go to bed now
