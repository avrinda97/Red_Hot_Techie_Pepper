2006-03-02T06:38:00.000Z	farous	_jason	for a desktop user his home dir is more important than anything else
2006-03-02T06:38:00.000Z	_jason	farous	ok?
2006-03-02T06:39:00.000Z	farous	_jason	he is only worried of a perception of lost space
2006-03-02T06:39:00.000Z	_jason	farous	sorry, I haven't been following so you've completely lost me :)
2006-03-02T06:40:00.000Z	farous	_jason	i tried telling him it is not wise. He is a desktop user who thinks having empty dir means he has an empty unutilized space on his harddisk
2006-03-02T06:41:00.000Z	_jason	farous	oh
2006-04-12T10:21:00.000Z	farous	_jason	isn't dpkg, apt-get and aptitude all have different list. Wouldn't it depend on which front end was used for installations?
2006-04-12T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	farous	they all use the same database I believe
2006-04-12T10:22:00.000Z	farous	_jason	no i know for a fact that aptitude do not honor apt-get list
2006-04-12T10:22:00.000Z	_jason	farous	what do you mean?  can you give me an example I can try?
2006-04-12T10:23:00.000Z	farous	_jason	installed the fglrx package after compilation using dpkg aptitude report it as broken. also installing using apt-get aptitude report them as broken and mark them for removal
2006-04-12T10:24:00.000Z	_jason	farous	what did you install using apt-get that aptitude reported as broken?
2006-04-12T10:25:00.000Z	_jason	farous	np, I was just curious
2006-04-12T10:26:00.000Z	farous	_jason	i seen it documented as a problem with aptitude that it does not honor apt-get and dpkg lists
2006-04-12T10:26:00.000Z	_jason	farous	do you happen to still have a link to the document anywhere?
2006-04-12T10:27:00.000Z	_jason	farous	bye
2006-04-16T09:14:00.000Z	farous	_jason	you beaten me to it
