2008-04-13T17:02:00.000Z	Starnestommy	administ1ator	does your network use DHCP?
2008-04-13T17:03:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	No I have set a static Ip
2008-04-13T17:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	administ1ator	what happens when you run 'ping -c 4 google.com' ?
2008-04-13T17:04:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	It isnt connected to the internet, it has a ip off 192.168.0.10 and connected to 192.168.0.12
2008-04-13T17:06:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	All the ip settings are correct, the ubuntu system has 2 nics. ETH0 and ETH2, ETH0 says UP broadcast Running multicast (this nic is working fine). But ETH2 only says Broadcast Multicast

2008-04-13T17:07:00.000Z	Starnestommy	administ1ator	is eth0 the one with the IP settings?
2008-04-13T17:08:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	No ETH0 has DHCP activated ETH2 Has Static IP
2008-04-13T17:08:00.000Z	Starnestommy	administ1ator	and you want to just use eth2?
2008-04-13T17:09:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	ETH0 is connected to the router (who offers DHCP) (connects on ETH0) on ETH2 a Switch is being connected and several clients
2008-04-13T17:09:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	This machine will be a firewall/router
2008-04-13T17:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	administ1ator	I don't know anything about running a router
2008-04-13T17:10:00.000Z	administ1ator	Starnestommy	But the problem is I cant get my client working with another client
