2010-06-03T07:55:00.000Z	BFP		Good evening.
2010-06-03T07:56:00.000Z	BFP		I'm trying to figure out why my wireless connection on my desktop won't authenticate to the network now that I've installed Lucid.
2010-06-03T07:56:00.000Z	BFP		I seem to have the wireless adapters installed, and I can see the network, but it always tells me I have a bad password.
2010-06-03T07:57:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	do you know which authentication protocol  your wireless network uses?
2010-06-03T08:02:00.000Z	BFP	jimqode	It's WPA2, but even if I disable security it won't get an IP address.
2010-06-03T08:03:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	does  the wireless symbol show as connected?
2010-06-03T08:03:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	when you disable authentication?
2010-06-03T08:04:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	what is your wifi card?
2010-06-03T08:05:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	what does 'lsusb' command say your wifi card name is?
2010-06-03T08:10:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	it seems to be a problem with the latest driver for your card.
2010-06-03T08:11:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	i suggest  running the older kernel if you upgraded to 10.04. otherwise reinstalling 9.10 seems to be the easiest option.
2010-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	BFP	jimqode	How would I use the older kernel? I don't think I've done that before. Can I do it in synaptic or whatever we call it these days?
2010-06-03T08:17:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	if you upgraded from 9.10 there should still be an option for the older kernel on the boot menu
2010-06-03T08:18:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	i guess it'll be all pain and suffering then. may I suggest you go back to 9.10 until the issue with the driver is fixed
2010-06-03T08:19:00.000Z	BFP	jimqode	Hm, I got the driver from the last thread on the subject. Can you point me in the direction of where I can keep an eye on updates to it?
2010-06-03T08:21:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	just google it until you see a [SOLVED] thread with your problem. I couldn't find a bug report for this issue on launchpad, maybe you can consider making one.
2010-06-03T08:21:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	you could also try to use the windows drivers with ndiswrapper.
2010-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	jimqode	BFP	I have to go to sleep now but there are tons of resources on the web, and i'm sure there'll be someone else here happy to help. Good luck.
