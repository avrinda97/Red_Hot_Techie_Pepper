2006-10-19T05:17:00.000Z	soundray	ChickenTalons	it's a Linksys router? Teach it some manners, install OpenWrt
2006-10-19T05:27:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	heres the problem, I was using sveasoft, and it really SUCKED
2006-10-19T05:29:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	I was really disappointed because the sveasoft would work great for a short time and then not all all
2006-10-19T05:29:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	but the linksys firmware works perfectly
2006-10-19T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	ChickenTalons	my Sveasoft experience is similar. I'm happy with OpenWrt.
2006-10-19T05:30:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	hmm ill check it out, my faith has been shattered due to the sveasoft though
2006-10-19T05:30:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	i wish I could just take the linksys firmware and add the setting to crank up the signal strength
2006-10-19T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	ChickenTalons	in that case, stick with the original firmware. OpenWrt is a whole different kettle of fish.
2006-10-19T05:31:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	ok, I am capable of using gentoo, so im not totally clueless about compiling and the such
2006-10-19T06:24:00.000Z	soundray	ChickenTalons	no, it isn't. You can install a 32bit version if you want to, but the repo version is 64bit
2006-10-19T06:25:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	im very surprised at that, I didnt know old flash HAD a 64 bit plugin
2006-10-19T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	ChickenTalons	it didn't. If you got it working in 64bit firefox, I'd be very curious as to how.
2006-10-19T06:26:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	im going to reboot into ubuntu and we're gong to see what's up. brb
2006-10-19T06:36:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	it appears I was mistaken - I guess I just assumed it because mplayer-plugin worked
2006-10-19T06:36:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	how do I install the 32 bit firefox?
2006-10-19T06:37:00.000Z	soundray	ChickenTalons	I don't know, I haven't tried, but Kilz has instructions on help.ubuntu.com I think
2006-10-19T06:38:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	right on, thx
2006-10-19T06:39:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	soundray	theres no kinda search function there :(
