2006-03-15T17:37:00.000Z	dan_		how do I install programs from a .rpm archive?
2006-03-15T17:38:00.000Z	dan_		I am trying to install real player for linux
2006-03-15T17:38:00.000Z	dan_		deb?
2006-03-15T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	Ubuntu doesn't use RPMs, it uses DEBs.
2006-03-15T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	also, while you can install a DEB manually (might be the case with real player), you usually use the APT system, which downloads, install and solves dependencies automatically
2006-03-15T17:40:00.000Z	dan_	LjL	for that i will have to use ADD APPLICATIONS interface? right?
2006-03-15T17:40:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	that is a very simplified interface, which only allows installing few programs
2006-03-15T17:40:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	you should either use apt-get (as explained by Ubotu), or Synaptic, which is a graphical interface (Ubotu will tell you about it now)
2006-03-15T17:41:00.000Z	dan_	LjL	great :)
2006-03-15T17:41:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	also, right now, you only have access to 5000 programs or so. you'd probably like to also have access to another 12000 programs that are available. the bot will tell you how to do that, as well
2006-03-15T17:42:00.000Z	dan_	LjL	 My goodness
2006-03-15T17:42:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	what do you mean "best"?
2006-03-15T17:42:00.000Z	dan_	LjL	 I have totem but i dont like it
2006-03-15T17:42:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	well, you'll mostly have to try them out
2006-03-15T17:43:00.000Z	dan_	LjL	 I want to know what most people use and prefer you know what i mean?
2006-03-15T17:43:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	what's "best" is a matter of opinions
2006-03-15T17:43:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	most well-known programs for watching videos are, besides the one shipped with ubuntu, mplayer and vlc
2009-11-09T03:35:00.000Z	LjL	dan_	his problem as he stated it was that he didn't know *how* to create that file in a root-owned directory to begin with. i just gave him a command to do that, though.
