2010-04-29T13:10:00.000Z	plum		where can i figure out where my drives are?
2010-04-29T13:10:00.000Z	plum		like a path to them
2010-04-29T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	plum	"drives" work differently than in windows, can you give me an overview to what you want to do ?
2010-04-29T13:11:00.000Z	plum		ah sorry i misworded, but i found them, they are in /media
2010-04-29T13:11:00.000Z	plum	ikonia	i'm trying to link my music folder in ubuntu to my windows music folder since that's my main OS
2010-04-29T13:12:00.000Z	ikonia	plum	ok, so you want to create a simlink or "shortcut" to your windows driver music folder
2010-04-29T13:12:00.000Z	plum	ikonia	that's correct, i assume ln -s /path-to-linux-music /path-to-windows-music would do it?
2010-04-29T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	plum	you may have to do "-sf" to replace an existing folder
2010-04-29T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	plum	but yes, spot on, well done
2010-04-29T13:13:00.000Z	plum		hmm... ikonia i am having a little problem though, i look in /media and Windows 7 is there but it has a space in the name.
2010-04-29T13:13:00.000Z	plum		how would i link it to there?
2010-04-29T13:13:00.000Z	plum		from terminal
2010-04-29T13:14:00.000Z	ikonia	plum	escape characters, eg: ln -s /path_to_linux /path\ to\ windows
2010-04-29T13:14:00.000Z	plum		ooh awesome
2010-04-29T13:14:00.000Z	plum		thanks guys, i'll try it
2010-04-29T13:15:00.000Z	plum	ikonia	and you said to make it ln -sf, correct?
2010-04-29T13:15:00.000Z	plum		just trying to make sure
2010-04-29T13:15:00.000Z	ikonia	plum	if you're replacing an existing directory, yes
