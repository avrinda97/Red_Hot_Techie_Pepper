2006-08-05T14:46:00.000Z	rorRuben		Friends, I've problems with a NTFS partition with Windows XP, when i try to reboot the pc and select win xp the pc is restarted, I can't enter in win xp or mount the partition too
2006-08-05T14:46:00.000Z	rorRuben		here is the output dor fdisk and fstab file => http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19796
2006-08-05T14:46:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	whats your grub menu entry to reboot into windows?
2006-08-05T14:49:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	i will take a look
2006-08-05T14:53:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	is the ntfs partition the one winxp is installed in (as i see you have fat partitions too)
2006-08-05T14:53:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	also what error do you get when selecting winxp from the grub menu when trying to boot into it?
2006-08-05T14:54:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	so you dont get any error message about not finding it or anything?
2006-08-05T14:57:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	im afraid i dont speak (spanish is it?)
2006-08-05T14:59:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	will take a look
2006-08-05T15:00:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	can you try and mount it, then straight after type in dmesg and pastebin what it says?
2006-08-05T15:06:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	edit your fstab (after backing it up of course ;)) and change the windows (ntfs) parition line to: /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 ntfs nls=utf8,umask=0222 0 0
2006-08-05T15:07:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	then try and mount it again
2006-08-05T15:19:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	no problem, hope everything works out for you and sorry i couldnt be any more helpful
2006-08-05T15:11:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	from the looks of your dmesg, the ntfs partition looks damaged/needing some sort of windows repair, it bails out after trying to mount and says it doesnt try to recover, now im not sure how to make it try and recover etc, sorry, have you searched/posted on the forums?
2006-08-05T15:16:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	if you reinstall xp you will haver to make sure not to overwrite your linux partitions etc, once windows is installed then follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-08-05T15:16:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	but i would advise instead of reinstalling windows
2006-08-05T15:17:00.000Z	scott_	rorRuben	boot up windows cd, goto recovery console, type in fixmbr, which will then auto boot windows, then follow the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
