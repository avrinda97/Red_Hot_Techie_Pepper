2012-09-09T22:42:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	what seems to be the problem?
2012-09-09T22:45:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	ok, are you familiar with partitions and filesystem terminology?
2012-09-09T22:46:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	ok, before you go ahead and reinstall Ubuntu, you can try opening a terminal window in Ubuntu and running a command
2012-09-09T22:47:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	try "sudo update-grub"
2012-09-09T22:47:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	without the quotes of course.
2012-09-09T22:48:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	haha ok
2012-09-09T22:49:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	that was for you. So, pretty much, Windows needs a partition of its own.
2012-09-09T22:49:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	Windows 7 actually uses 2 partitions
2012-09-09T22:50:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	ok, it shouldn't have. Try installing Ubuntu now.
2012-09-09T22:50:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	it should detect Windows in the proper partition and install.
2012-09-09T22:50:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	some computers have weird Windows partitions, sometimes it can get messy.
2012-09-09T22:51:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	what's important is to note how many partitions Windows is using.
2012-09-09T22:52:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	I see, ok, let me explain a bit
2012-09-09T22:52:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	hard-drives can only have 4 main partitions. They can either be primary, or extended.
2012-09-09T22:52:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	extended partitions can contain more partitions
2012-09-09T22:53:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	Windows loves taking up primary partitions. So I'm going to guess you have 3 primary partitions, leaving just 1 for Ubuntu which should use an extended partition for all its things. Just go ahead and install Ubuntu with the guided partitioning and come back.
2012-09-09T22:54:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	when addressing your issues it's important to talk about your partitions, that will help clarify your problem.
2012-09-09T23:44:00.000Z	exodus	Chris123	run: "sudo update-grub" in a terminal, paste it to http://paste.ubuntu.com/  and pass the link
