2011-10-17T22:15:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	What graphics does your T410 have?
2011-10-17T22:15:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	and have you had problems w/ accel/compositing
2011-10-17T22:17:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 Sorry; what's the proc for the graphics.
2011-10-17T22:18:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	don't know.  i use `lshw -c display` and/or `lspci`

2011-10-17T22:24:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 My laptop may lock up again, so please forgive me if I disappear for a bit.
2011-10-17T22:25:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	(i skipped 11.04, but had things pretty dialed on 10.10)
2011-10-17T22:25:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	*Hmmm...is that a graphic lockup? I'm on same (or similar) and have had video issues since upgrade
2011-10-17T22:25:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 It appears to be associated with the same mouse problem.  The mouse gets more and more wigged out until the whole desktop locks up.
2011-10-17T22:26:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	Wow.  i don't have mouse issues, but compositing has been creating problems w/ X
2011-10-17T22:26:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 Sorry.  Should I look up compositing?
2011-10-17T22:27:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	well, you could try selecting "Ubuntu Classic" from the login screen's session menu and see if the problem goes away
2011-10-17T22:28:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	that's Gnome w/o Unity
2011-10-17T22:28:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 I may try that next.  Just to get the problem out there, as I suspect others see it:  you move the mouse or mouse over and things just get clicked automagically.
2011-10-17T22:28:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 And the accidental mouseclicks get worse and worse some sessions until the session locks up.
2011-10-17T22:29:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 It is a pretty damning bug, to be gentle about it, and it is on my work machine.  I am hoping I can help get it fixed before it eats too much into my work week.
2011-10-17T22:30:00.000Z	MeanderingCode	xcyclist	i know what you mean...I'm losing time on my work machine, too
2011-10-17T22:31:00.000Z	xcyclist	MeanderingCode	 dragging off to a meeting.  Thank you for the help.  I will check back during the PDT noon hour.
