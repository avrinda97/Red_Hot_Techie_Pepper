2008-12-09T00:18:00.000Z	synaptix		:(
2008-12-09T00:19:00.000Z	synaptix		woah... it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop?
2008-12-09T00:19:00.000Z	synaptix		does that package work both ways? ie will it pull off everything it brought with it?
2008-12-09T00:19:00.000Z	synaptix		ah ok then
2008-12-09T00:20:00.000Z	synaptix		hurts in what way?
2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	synaptix		I suppose the metapackage won't be there to upgrade everything that's needed
2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	synaptix		( if you call them metapackages over here )
2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	synaptix		I suppose I could reinstall it as part of my upgrade plan
2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	synaptix		better than this nonsense - I'm not keeping pulseaudio, I'm afraid :)
2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	synaptix		right, I have a plan. Thanks
2008-12-09T00:22:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	synaptix	whats not working?
2008-12-09T00:22:00.000Z	synaptix	zsquareplusc	almost everything that uses sound
2008-12-09T00:23:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	synaptix	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=789578
2008-12-09T00:23:00.000Z	synaptix	zsquareplusc	I'd rather just have my old sound system, which was perfectly functional for me in every way
2008-12-09T00:24:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	synaptix	i think you can easily configure all the apps to use ALSA and disable pulseaudio in the session
2008-12-09T00:26:00.000Z	synaptix	zsquareplusc	All the gamers I know who use ubuntu have had lots of problems with pulseaudio, with games, with teamspeak, with in-game voice chat - I wonder if the wiki should point out
2008-12-09T00:41:00.000Z	synaptix	zsquareplusc	what, and it actually takes effort to set that up with the gnome apps?
2008-12-09T00:42:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	synaptix	you are referring to what? using ALSA?
