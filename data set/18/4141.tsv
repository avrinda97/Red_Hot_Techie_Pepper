2009-08-17T21:27:00.000Z	OEP	rincon	I do not know. I've only used it in Ubuntu and it was pretty good for taking pictures/video
2009-08-17T21:28:00.000Z	rincon	OEP	doe it works for transmitting webcam chat like windows live messenger does?
2009-08-17T21:28:00.000Z	OEP	rincon	looks to be specifically for GNOME
2009-08-17T21:28:00.000Z	OEP	rincon	no. you might want something like skype for that.
2009-08-17T21:30:00.000Z	OEP	rincon	to install skype, you'll need to add the medibuntu repository and use apt-get to install it
2009-08-17T21:31:00.000Z	rincon	OEP	how do you add the medibuntu repo?
2009-08-17T21:31:00.000Z	OEP	rincon	do a quick google for it. there is a full guide on how to do it.
