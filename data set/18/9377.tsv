2008-06-28T07:57:00.000Z	greenthumb		well, still hopping in here
2008-06-28T07:58:00.000Z	greenthumb		is anyone familiar with Joker's How To on getting packet injection to work with b43 wireless driver?
2008-06-28T07:58:00.000Z	greenthumb		i am running into a hang up when i actually run the patch
2008-06-28T07:59:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	i have injection up on my b43
2008-06-28T08:01:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	try "sudo patch -p1 < b43-injection-2.6.24.4.patch"
2008-06-28T08:27:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	hehe. just write in what file to patch, and you should be over that
2008-06-28T08:05:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	it's how many directories it's supposed to traverse
2008-06-28T08:06:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	have you read the patch, put it in the appropriate directory and used the correct command?
2008-06-28T08:07:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	you are patching linux for b43 injection support?
2008-06-28T08:10:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	how many directories the patch will traverse. This is where you get the number for "patch -p0 -p1 -p2 etc.."
2008-06-28T08:12:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	ya.  just $nano  <patchname> , and count the slashes
2008-06-28T08:17:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	The patch file has a target file listed in the beginning of the file
2008-06-28T08:19:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	depends on what directory the patch sits in right now
2008-06-28T08:23:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	if you placed the patch in /usr/src/linux, a $ patch -p4 < b43-injection-2.6.24.4.patch , would presumably work.
2008-06-28T08:24:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	did you try my command?
2008-06-28T08:31:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	just try them all, it has to work
2008-06-28T08:34:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	do a $ sudo patch -p0 < b43-injection-2.6.24.4.patch, followed by a $ sudo patch -p1 < b43-injection-2.6.24.4.patch and so on..
2008-06-28T08:38:00.000Z	Steve_	greenthumb	yes, do that.
