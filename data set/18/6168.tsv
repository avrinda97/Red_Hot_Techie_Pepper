2008-10-12T19:16:00.000Z	homy		hello. I once heard about a free php programm that is like youtube, but I forgot its name.
2008-10-12T19:16:00.000Z	homy		Anybody know about it?
2008-10-12T19:16:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	try on google 'php script youtube'
2008-10-12T19:17:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	ah sorry i was looking at localized version of google results, yours maay be different
2008-10-12T19:17:00.000Z	homy	tommi_	oh, thanks, I searched with other terms...
2008-10-12T19:18:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	phpmotion maybe?
2008-10-12T19:38:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	phpmotion
2008-10-12T19:40:00.000Z	homy	tommi_	it requires a register to download - I don't like that.
2008-10-12T19:41:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	ah sorry i didn't know about this, you can easily bypass registratino with a mailinator account eh
2008-10-12T19:48:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	if registrations scre you get an account at mailinator.com and you won't receive spam
2008-10-12T19:49:00.000Z	homy	tommi_	but that script also looks very complicated; I only want something where I can upload a video and play it. Thats all. It doesn't even have to be multiple videos, or upload by html, ...
2008-10-12T19:49:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	then sorry i can't help you.
2008-10-12T19:50:00.000Z	homy	tommi_	maybe somebody else can.
2008-10-12T19:50:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	i hope for you that somebody can, look at Helminthe response maybe it's more helpful
2008-10-12T19:51:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	and maybe ask for this somewhere else more php related, like #php (if this exists on irc.ubuntu.org)
2008-10-12T20:09:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	i believe you can't show flash to a browser without plugins
2008-10-12T20:16:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	google 'youtube alternatives' - i.e. vimeo
2008-10-12T20:17:00.000Z	tommi_	homy	in google "embed flv (php OR html OR RTFM)" gives greatresults :)
