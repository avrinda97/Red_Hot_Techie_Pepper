2012-09-02T14:09:00.000Z	hackeridis		problem is i can open network manager but can not open options to setup the network i have ubuntu 12.04 and when i open a browser any browser i get the message error 106 err-internet-disconnected
2012-09-02T14:10:00.000Z	hackeridis		i can not use wifi or wired net work
2012-09-02T14:10:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	ifconfig shows what?
2012-09-02T14:11:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	ok it shows it .. but does it show ip addresses? Can any other internet capable devices get to the internet?
2012-09-02T14:12:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	can you ping the gateway or other machines on your network?
2012-09-02T14:14:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	do you have any other machines having issues?
2012-09-02T14:15:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	if it was ubuntu there would be a bug. You install has a problem
2012-09-02T14:16:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	have you configured the correct DNS to reach the router? . You can use the router IP address for the gateway/dns
2012-09-02T14:45:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	 has a problem with his network and that's what needs to be resolved.
2012-09-02T14:46:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	you have no network connectivity, you can't get an ip address and none of your other machines are having problems is this correct?
2012-09-02T14:48:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	has it ever worked? is this your first install or fresh install I should say?
2012-09-02T14:49:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	you changed hardware?
2012-09-02T14:50:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	have you updated your pkgs? I remember a problem with some types of drivers having to be blacklisted to work correctly with the new drivers
2012-09-02T14:51:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	this sounds like a dns problem if both ifs are having the problem. ikonia said 12.04 uses dns masq which I'm unfamilure with as most of my time has been spent on bsd machines
2012-09-02T14:52:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	this isn't a fix all .. but can you run a live cd and see if the network capabilities are functioning off the live cd?
2012-09-02T14:55:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	Your best bet at this time is either check back in the channel a little later or start google-ing and see what you can find. I would make backups of your currently configs and start tinkering around with different solutions you find.
2012-09-02T14:56:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	right, but it's machine specific which leads me to believe dnsmasq problems. If that's the case your better off doing what was mentioned above.
2012-09-02T14:57:00.000Z	diligentdino	hackeridis	if you resolve the problem and I'm not around can you put it into a pm for me. I'd like to see the outcome
