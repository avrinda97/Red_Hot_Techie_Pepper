2010-07-28T04:36:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 thanx, i want to know how to share files from windows to ubuntu?
2010-07-28T04:37:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	via network, or are you dual booting...??
2010-07-28T04:37:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 dual booting
2010-07-28T04:38:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	the simplest solution is to mount your fat32/ntfs drive. ubuntu has no problem reading the drive, then you can just copy or view at your leisure.
2010-07-28T04:38:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 i am newbie friend on this, can u tell me how, and thanx
2010-07-28T04:39:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	under places, do you see your windows partition or drive?
2010-07-28T04:40:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 yes
2010-07-28T04:41:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	click on it, and see if it opens, and if it does, it's always a good i dea to run a small file on their like a pdf or text document just to make sure
2010-07-28T04:42:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 yes i open it, i can see the folders of windows
2010-07-28T04:42:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	try and run something, music, a picture, anything
2010-07-28T04:44:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 ok,now if i boot to windows,how can i share from ubuntu?
2010-07-28T04:47:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 are u still with me?
2010-07-28T04:47:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	to be honest, theirs no way i know of conventionally. the only way i know of requires ubuntu to do the transfers. you would need a ext 3 or 4 reader of some sort, which windows doesnt have. hmm. maybe there is one, but i haven't seen one. one option is to take a small part of your hard drive and make a fat32 partition, them put in their what you would like to transfer, but that still doesnt give you full access.
2010-07-28T04:50:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	i found one, thanx to p2pdf: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/
2010-07-28T04:56:00.000Z	hendaus	hylian	 this Ext2Read can be installed on ubuntu or windows xp?
2010-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	hylian	hendaus	thats a windows xp vista 7 app
