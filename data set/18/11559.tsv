2006-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	user-land		system monitor does not report cpu load correctly. time and again, cpu use is 80% and system monitor only shows a few apps at 5% ...
2006-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	what type of cpu do you have?
2006-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	which kernel are you using?
2006-11-02T14:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	try the linux-image-generic package
2006-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	user-land	chuckyp	are you an expert ?
2006-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	what do you mean by expert?
2006-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	I just know the generic package would be a better kernel for your cpu if you don't want to run 64bit.

2006-11-04T06:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	fdisk
2006-11-04T06:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	you can install gparted from synaptic or just use the livecd I believe that has gparted on it.  or sudo apt-get install gparted

2006-11-04T06:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	I've never had a problem with it.  Worst case scenario could be you lose your data.
2006-11-04T06:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	what do you need to do specifically?
2006-11-04T06:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	I've never lost data or heard about it hapening  but you run that risk any time you are resizing partitions etc...
2006-11-04T06:24:00.000Z	user-land	chuckyp	at the moment just format an additional sata disk i just connected.
2006-11-04T06:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	then I wouldn't worrry about it.  If the drive has no data on it that you are worried about format away.
2006-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	You run the risk of data loss anytime you resizing partitions etc... Or if you are just blindly clicking on stuff that you don't know what it does.  In your case I think you will be safe using gparted.
2006-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	chuckyp	user-land	exactly.
