2006-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	jatt	bobbyyu	(don't paste the output here)
2006-11-01T15:57:00.000Z	jatt	bobbyyu	strange, I haven't found such error before. What I did (yesterday) with edgy was to share my folder through nautilus. At that point, nautilus downloaded some additional packages for samba. Then I had a lot of trouble trying to find which damn :) password I need to type in my windows machine. With smbpasswd I could solve that problem.
