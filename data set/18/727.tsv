2011-10-11T02:29:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	are you forcing a user in the share parameters?
2011-10-11T02:31:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	yea it gives me an error in my log about switching to that user.
2011-10-11T02:31:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	does that user exist and have an smbpass created?
2011-10-11T02:32:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	yea user erin was created and did smbpasswd -a
2011-10-11T02:33:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	[2011/10/10 18:20:43.439308,  0] smbd/uid.c:310(change_to_user)
2011-10-11T02:33:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	ah ok, that's about the extent of my knowledge then, assuming you've restarted tha daemon since and also tried testparm for a laugh
2011-10-11T02:35:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	it's ok I can just change the permissions on ssh I guess
2011-10-11T02:36:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	does that user, erin, have read permissions on the share path?
2011-10-11T02:37:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	yea ;/ the dir is owned by x:x but it is 777
2011-10-11T02:38:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	erk =E tried forcing the owner to erin:erin just for a test?
2011-10-11T02:41:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	nah, im just going to be storing a few images of hard drives so I can chang the permissions to -w or whatever manually later. it needs to be x:x since it stores movies etc for my home theater ;\
2011-10-11T02:42:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	ah ok. i do the same thing by having the group owner as a group "server" that all the users are a member of
2011-10-11T02:43:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	hrm.. what ? :-)
2011-10-11T02:45:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	so say i want 3 users on something, the permissions are 760 or 660, with owner nobody:group - where "group" = "server". then, the share in the samba config has a parameter "forcegroup = server" and "createmask = 0660" or so to force it
2011-10-11T02:47:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	uh, so have the group of the file the name of my server machine, like (Media)?
2011-10-11T02:47:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	it's the name of the "group" account you create, then assign all your users to :D
2011-10-11T02:49:00.000Z	x2321	daftykins	so group (erin) needs to or, rather have all my other users (x) be added to that group?
2011-10-11T02:51:00.000Z	daftykins	x2321	well you'd create one, using "addgroup" - i'm going out on a limb here though so you may well have a bug and all i'm saying could be a timewaste :S might be worth just googling for example samba guides - that's how i learnt, then started wrestling with permissions fun
