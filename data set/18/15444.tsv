2005-03-23T11:06:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	I was a beta tester for Xandros 1.0
2005-03-23T11:07:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	I've got a notebook at work running the public 2.0,  it's "neat" but this is way better.
2005-03-23T11:07:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	Xandros has some really nice features.  It's File Manager is excellent.
2005-03-23T11:08:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	But on the whole, I agree with you.  I really like Ubuntu.
2005-03-23T11:08:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	it's because of Xandros I actually paid the codeweaver guys for Crossover Office.
2005-03-23T11:09:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	CrossOver Office is a very nice enhancement of Wine.  And they host/support the Wine project.
2005-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	it allows me to easily run Lotus notes, Ms office 2k, and Clientele.  and I didn't have to pull my hair out, or go more grey to get them working.
2005-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	Yeah, that's it's major claim to fame.  Easily and seamlessly run many Windows apps on Linux.
2005-03-31T12:20:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	:-)  Well, at least you know that you're running a kernel tailored to your architecture.
2005-03-31T12:25:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	would that command give you both KDE and Gnome as options from the login window?
2005-03-31T12:26:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	It should.
2005-03-31T12:31:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	Put Gentoo from Stage One on the P2 266. :-)
2005-03-31T13:54:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	Application of technology to social problems is a major mistake!  Herding cats is more likely to work.
2005-03-31T13:54:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	Again I think it depends on which technology you'
2005-03-31T13:54:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	Again I think it depends on which technology you're talking about applying.
2005-03-31T13:54:00.000Z	Absenth	DarthFrog	I think a baseball bat represents some amount of technology, and does solve quite a few social problems when used correctly.
2005-03-31T13:55:00.000Z	DarthFrog	Absenth	Well, yes.  If you want the "users" to survive, it kinda limits your options, though. :-)
