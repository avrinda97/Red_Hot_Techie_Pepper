2005-12-12T17:06:00.000Z	Determinist		whoever made the ubuntu dependencies like this should die
2005-12-12T17:07:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	can you do better?
2005-12-12T17:07:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	Why focus on the problems?  why not find a remedy if you think you can do better?  as Henry Ford said "Dont find fault, find a redemy"
2005-12-12T17:08:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	wish i knew or had time to learn, in the meantime i suppose all i can do is either cope or ask someone else to modify. i just cant see how a floppy formatter util can have anything to do with the log viewer or the dictionary application
2005-12-12T17:08:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	 UNLESS you can do better, be silent ;)
2005-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	:P
2005-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	btw, that attitude isnt really what this development model is all about mate, if i wanted to be silent about what's bothering me with an OS, i'd stick with windows.
2005-12-12T17:11:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	all I said was you are complaining and saying the developers should die!  And I said, unless you can do better, be silent
2005-12-12T17:11:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	I never complain about Ubuntu etc because the developers do an AMAZING job and I cant do better
2005-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	most of the people i know dont write operating systems for a living, and again, the guys at microsoft are doing a good job as well, it's the people guiding their boats that are ... well, you get my intention and yes, i'm sure you're going to have alot to say about it
2005-12-12T17:14:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	and on a last note, if people didnt complain, you'd still be doing things using text mode with generic support using VIM :P
2005-12-12T17:14:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	just be grateful for amazing people like Seveas who invest their time to do their best for the commuity!  I was upset when you said they should die!  that was a horrid thing for you to say
2005-12-12T17:14:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	 you can give constuctive feedback NOT say they should die!!!
2005-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	ohh give me a break mate, it's 1 am, i'm tired, it's a figure of speech, i wish for seveas to die pretty much the same as i would want anyone else to.
2005-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	 you need to grow up and respect others I feel!  thats all I will say
2005-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	are you from Australia?  you say 'mate' and in Australia we say that a lot :P
2005-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	Determinist	lightbright	actually, i used to play a MMOFPS game with a buncha brits and scottish guys, so it kinda stuck with me lol
2005-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	lightbright	Determinist	hehe ok ;)
