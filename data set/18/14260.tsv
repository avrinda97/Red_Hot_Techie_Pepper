2006-03-08T08:20:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	the tv standards ntsc pal and so on :-)
2006-03-08T08:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	ah ok
2006-03-08T08:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	it appears DarKSideS has already read that or something
2006-03-08T08:23:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	ahh
2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	cos it kills grub if it goes on last
2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	so if you have a choice that should be it
2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	that's correct, or you can do away with dd, etc :)
2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	if your talking to someone who is having problems with an install dd is most likely not their friend as they will not be in a position to execute it
2006-03-11T17:23:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	heh
2006-03-11T17:30:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	the issue is not just about cable selecting, I have 3 hard disks and installing ubuntu/kubuntu proved nothing but pain until I removed excessive hard disks
2006-03-11T17:31:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	I run dedicated to linux boxes only - be it one or four drives :)
2006-03-11T17:32:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	so do I on this box, however, I had two other hard disks full of data but no OS. Whenever I tried installing ubuntu/kubuntu (Hoary) it always go GRUB error until I unplugged extra hard disks, that solved the problem instantly
2006-03-11T17:32:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	ooch
2006-03-11T17:52:00.000Z	ompaul	hatake_kakashi	speak for yourself people keep saying I am a bot! :-)
2006-03-11T17:52:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	heh
2006-03-11T17:53:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	ompaul	yup
