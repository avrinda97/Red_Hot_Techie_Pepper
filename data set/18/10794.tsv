2007-02-07T14:19:00.000Z	rc-1		can i just disable flash somehow?
2007-02-07T14:20:00.000Z	rc-1		is there a way i can edit what sites the session loads, or turn off flash, or block a site from loading?
2007-02-07T14:22:00.000Z	rc-1		anyone know how to turn off flash in firefox, totally block a site, or edit what sessions it loads?

2007-02-07T14:23:00.000Z	rc-1	eternalswd	i cant install the plugin without losing my session :(
2007-02-07T14:24:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	it's easy to install flash 9, just download the installer from adobe and copy the plugins to ~/.mozilla/plugins, or it should be in backports
2007-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	rc-1	eternalswd	thats not the problem, i have flash 9
2007-02-07T14:26:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	ah, then I'd suggest installing adblock plus
2007-02-07T14:27:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	it'd also be a good idea to install noscript and only allow trusted sites to run javascript.  that'll kill a bunch of the problems
2007-02-07T14:27:00.000Z	rc-1	eternalswd	its flash i already have adblock/noscript
2007-02-07T14:27:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	then just uninstall flash or install the flashblock extension
2007-02-07T14:28:00.000Z	rc-1	eternalswd	ill have to uninstall flash, i cant install a plugin when it crashes on load!
2007-02-07T14:29:00.000Z	rc-1	eternalswd	thanks i wish there was a better way though :( whats the command to remove flash? (i cant use firefox to lookup! :(
2007-02-07T14:29:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	then uninstall it, install flashblock and reinstall it, then you should have control over what flash content is actually used.
2007-02-07T14:30:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	did you install from the repository?
2007-02-07T14:30:00.000Z	rc-1	eternalswd	ya i think
2007-02-07T14:31:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	then just open up synaptic and search for flash the right click mark for uninstall and apply
2007-02-07T14:36:00.000Z	eternalswd	rc-1	my school blocks that site :p
