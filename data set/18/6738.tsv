2008-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		Hi again, it has been another 1/2 hour or so, and I am repeating, with an update:
2008-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		Repeat #2: Problem: IDE (working) partitions not visible after Gutsy net-upgrade to Hardy on SATA  Note: those IDEs still show in BIOS, but NOT in partition manager ! see update after "sudo fdisk -l"  Paste: http://pastebin.com/m4175c259
2008-04-30T10:42:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	first I heard of partitions showing up in the bios
2008-04-30T10:42:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	the IDE drives
2008-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	so not the partitions?  you said partitions...
2008-04-30T10:44:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	guess I blew it on what you were saying actually.  apologies
2008-04-30T10:44:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	none of us are NEAR perfect !
2008-04-30T10:45:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	nah man, fdisk without any arguments but switches is going to just list whatever the first drive is I spose.  if you're lucky it's even that nice.  try fdicsk -l /dev/foo to see your other junk
2008-04-30T10:46:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	see update after "sudo fdisk -l"  Paste: http://pastebin.com/m4175c259
2008-04-30T10:47:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	can you be a bit more specific  ?
2008-04-30T10:48:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	guess I'm completely wrong here.  fdisk -l, just plain, seems to list all the drives.  what's the problem?  sda seems to have a bunch of junk.  what are you expecting to see
2008-04-30T10:50:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	I am looking HARD for a disk(IDE) with 160GB on it, or at least the two partitions with like 33.7 GB
2008-04-30T10:50:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	oneof those has over 20 GB of files I want very much to be able to access !
2008-04-30T10:50:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	so your'e saying you have more than 3 disks attached?
2008-04-30T10:52:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	I dunno.  pull the usb junk.  reboot.  or heck, pull everything but the system disk and the disk you're after.  make sure the stuff is plugged in even.  boot the junk up.  run "dmesg".  see what it tells you about your disks.
2008-04-30T10:52:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	(1) IDE 160 GB and (1) SATA of 250 GB, two USBs are showing up at ~4GB and ~8GB
2008-04-30T10:53:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mathman	thanks .. worth a shot .. did not have any clue this was gonna happen !!
2008-04-30T10:55:00.000Z	Mathman	Don_Miguel	not trying to be a jerk here man, but it sounds like you really oughta double check that the thing is plugged in
