2007-08-04T16:55:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	it's fascist, that's what it is
2007-08-04T16:55:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	eh... i suppose
2007-08-04T16:58:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	that breaks some things though....
2007-08-07T15:53:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	the syntax of su includes "su" as a short form for "su root"
2007-08-07T16:08:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	the 128MB are a bit limiting. if you could up that to 256 (or better 512), then you could run ubuntu without real difficulties on it
2007-08-07T16:09:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	its a... junk rig. its been a TOTAL pain getting it to do whats expected of it
2007-08-07T16:09:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	maybe you could recycle it as a flower pot :)
2007-08-07T16:09:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	laptop. tried PC BSD but i can't make head or tail of it, and the package system is messed
2007-08-07T16:10:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	then xubuntu should run on it, but it won't be particularly nippy. you could look at lightweight distributions (dsl, puppy etc.) but your computer is really over-powered for dsl. have a look at xubuntu :)
2007-08-07T16:16:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	skype has of course the huge problem that they have never documented their protocol, and reverse-engineering it is nigh-on impossible. in other words: vendor lock-in
2007-08-07T16:16:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	well, its not so much a big issue for now
2007-08-07T16:16:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	it will be when skype ups the prices
2007-08-07T16:17:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	good luck, seeing as 90% of the world uses skype
2007-08-07T16:18:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	why don't you all move as a family to sip? i think even the skype client supports sip
2007-08-07T16:19:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	maybe next hols ;)
2007-08-10T05:20:00.000Z	faileas	howlingmadhowie	its ability to format NOT read fat drives is limited, to be more presise ;)
2007-08-10T05:21:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	faileas	okay :) i didn't know that :)
