2006-04-06T12:57:00.000Z	Amaranth		in that order
2006-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	Amaranth		nope
2006-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	Amaranth		sonance was the old name for banshee
2006-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	Amaranth		perhaps that's what you mean?
2006-04-06T12:59:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	Amaranth	Nope.  I saw an Invader Zim skin for a music player(?) called Serenade.
2006-04-06T12:59:00.000Z	Amaranth		*shrug*
2006-04-06T12:59:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	Amaranth	Do you happen to know if Banshee can be skinned?
2006-04-06T12:59:00.000Z	Amaranth		it can't
2006-04-06T13:00:00.000Z	Amaranth		the only ones i know of that can be 'skinned' are xmms and bmp
2006-04-06T13:00:00.000Z	Amaranth		but i don't really see the point
2006-04-06T13:00:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	Amaranth	You know, I don't need my player to be skinned.  I'd rather have great functionality and sound quality than "shiny" factor. ;)

2006-04-06T13:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	unL33Tn00b	Are you sure "Serenade" wasn't the name of the artist/album/title of the song being played?
2006-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	Amaranth		Please take that discussion elsewhere.
2006-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	Amaranth		!repos
2006-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	Amaranth	Ayup.  But it's no big deal...
2006-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	Amaranth	I'll see if I can find the link again.
