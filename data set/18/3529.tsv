2011-06-02T02:14:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	so?
2011-06-02T02:14:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	big STOP
2011-06-02T02:14:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	"hi, i'm a new theme!" "ok! *enter password to install theme*"
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	the trojan in '09 claimed to be a screensaver
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	that's why repos exist
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	yes, but not everybody follows the "stick to the repos" advice
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	a lot of people are just plain gullible...or impatient
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	their bad, it still cannot transmit from PC to PC like in windows
2011-06-02T02:17:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	of course not, but infections would be isolated, so it is not a big deal
2011-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	the greatest security risk is the user.
2011-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	of course. which is why "linux is totally secure" is a bunch of bologna
2011-06-02T02:19:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	do a fresh install, leave it running connected to the internet and it is secure, put a user in front of it, its over
2011-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	depends how many zero day exploits you know :) used to be you could pwn a macbook through the ethernet drivers
2011-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	what are the chances of that happenning on my PC?
2011-06-02T02:21:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	and what are the chances of that happenning on windos :P
2011-06-02T02:21:00.000Z	maco	cgroza	how common's your hardware and how many people are out to get you?
2011-06-02T02:21:00.000Z	cgroza	maco	common, 0
