2007-03-04T09:33:00.000Z	vox754	Clint-	you can always "rm" (remove) all files but that is kind of creepy.
2007-03-04T09:37:00.000Z	vox754	Clint-	first update your database "sudo updatedb" then "sudo locate <file>" in your case "nero" or whatever specifics you have.
2007-03-04T09:39:00.000Z	Clint-	vox754	okey i updated and located u want me to remove them all
2007-03-04T09:40:00.000Z	Clint-	vox754	okey i updated and located u want me to remove them all
2007-03-04T09:40:00.000Z	vox754	Clint-	it takes time to update the database. You COULD try removing, but that is up to you. I've done it succesfully with small programs like ndiswrapper, but others may need dependencies, and there is where it may break.
2007-03-04T09:43:00.000Z	Clint-	vox754	all are removed
2007-03-04T09:43:00.000Z	vox754	Clint-	then good luck with whatever you are doing!
2007-03-04T09:45:00.000Z	Clint-	vox754	 ummm should i just reinstall?
