2006-06-04T14:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	wheelswitch	yes. It's safe.
2006-06-04T14:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	wheelswitch	just beware when you upgrade.
2006-06-04T14:47:00.000Z	wheelswitch	Fujitsu	on that note, ive heard its a bad idea upgrading with the update manager, and better to do over the command line, is this the case? im not that fussed, if every thing is working, i think ill just leave it, unless there is a big advantage in upgrading.
2006-06-04T14:47:00.000Z	Fujitsu	wheelswitch	it's fine to do it through the GUI.
