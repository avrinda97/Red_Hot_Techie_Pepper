2006-11-18T10:01:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	ok here is it again
2006-11-18T10:03:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	I'm a bit confused.  You've got a 10 GB NTFS partition, 20 GB of unpartitioned space, and you want to mount /home to access both?
2006-11-18T10:04:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	i want a ext3 as home (but i want the data from NTFS to be copied in there)
2006-11-18T10:04:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	mwe said it right, please see it
2006-11-18T10:05:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	ah
2006-11-18T10:05:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	well, there are tools to extend partitions.  lemme dig around for a bit.
2006-11-18T10:05:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	Thank you for your efforts
2006-11-18T10:07:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	check out a tool called 'ext2resize'
2006-11-18T10:16:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	as were my responses to you
2006-11-18T10:16:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	check out 'ext2resize'
2006-11-18T10:16:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	yes i am looking at the page
2006-11-18T10:17:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	but be *very* careful about resizing partitions (i recommend that you back up all of your data to some other disk first)
2006-11-18T10:17:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	TELL ME THIS, can i 'extend' a partition from the front (the head side). I mean can i make it bigger, by merging the unpartitioned space in FRONT OF IT, to the already present back partition
2006-11-18T10:18:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	doubtful.  i think that ext3 stores it's primary partition table at the beginning of the disk.  then again, maybe a tool would be smart enough to sort that out.
2006-11-18T10:20:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	you *could* move the data around in a few steps, however.  i.e. make a small ext3 partition, copy the data there, erase the NTFS (and convert it to an ext3), move the data over to the new ext3 partition, then extend that one
2006-11-18T10:20:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	sounds a workable idea
2006-11-18T10:24:00.000Z	kenThomson2	dfcarney	RadiantFire: You see in my HDD, first i have NTFS 16GB partition, than rest 10GB IS EXT3 (empty partition). My NTFS PARTITION is full, that means 16gb of data needs to be copied to the 10GB ext3, which is not possible. What is likely is: I can copy 10GB from NTFS TO EXT3. Than i can resize NTFS (make it smaller), create a new small EXT3. than i can copy the left over 6GB of NTFS data to the new EXT3. after that i can destroy the NTFS
2006-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	dfcarney	kenThomson2	ugh.  i still say that you borrow or buy a second drive and back things up that way.  it sounds too risky otherwise.
