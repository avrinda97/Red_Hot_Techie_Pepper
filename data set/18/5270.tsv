2009-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	ok tnx this seems to work
2009-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	your welcome
2009-12-27T17:45:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	ok ... does not work as i see now....
2009-12-27T17:45:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	mencoder gives me "[flv @ 0x87211e8]Unsupported video codec (7)" for the flv files and "[mpeg @ 0x87211e8]packet too large, ignoring buffer limits to mux it" for the mp4 file.....
2009-12-27T17:47:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	not sure what that means to be honest. but you could try in terminal   cat file1.flv file2.flv > output.flv   to see if that works.  can you play the flv files?
2009-12-27T17:50:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	no cat only joins the first seconds of the second file but then the video is out
2009-12-27T17:50:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	what player are you using to watch the flv?
2009-12-27T17:51:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	several, ffplay, vlc, gstreamer
2009-12-27T17:51:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	ok now i see that it only copies the first video - nothing of the second one is joined
2009-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	an this happens with flv and mp4 files
2009-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	do you have  ubuntu-restricted-extras  installed? that package adds codecs for decoding. you may need that
2009-12-27T17:53:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	yes i have
2009-12-27T17:56:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	well you could try avidemux  read post #2  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=956769
2009-12-27T17:57:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	yes but that is what i did not want because joining 200 files in a graphical takes a bit time....
2009-12-27T18:00:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	yes it would.  read this it sounds like its a similar error  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=216787
2009-12-27T18:14:00.000Z	_raven_	legend2440	do you know if projectx is able to export every green in-out area to a separate file?
2009-12-27T18:15:00.000Z	legend2440	_raven_	sorry no i don't. never tried projectx
