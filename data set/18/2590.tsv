2010-04-24T02:11:00.000Z	tar-		what does "nodev,nosuid" actually mean? (the definitions found are somewhat .. in need of another definition :)
2010-04-24T02:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	you ca not create dev file in that filesystem nor set the setuid on any file of that filesystem
2010-04-24T02:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	no it only means that /dev/ cannot be in that directory
2010-04-24T02:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	no it only means that /dev/ cannot be in that filesystem
2010-04-24T02:14:00.000Z	tar-	erUSUL	aha :)
2010-04-24T02:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	openssh starts with the system. probably the problem is the network. network manager will only connect when you log in
2010-04-24T02:18:00.000Z	tar-	erUSUL	i see, so i should get the network manager to load the interfaces before logon then ?
2010-04-24T02:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	yes
2010-04-24T02:19:00.000Z	tar-	erUSUL	you're a goldmine ;)
2010-04-24T02:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	or use /etc/network/interfaces (if it is a wired connection it is the best option)
2010-04-24T02:20:00.000Z	tar-	erUSUL	thx :)
2010-04-24T02:26:00.000Z	tar-	erUSUL	I've also mounted additional drives meant to contain files reached through sftp, these are mounted in /media/... although chmod 777 to get write permissions without being root seems somewhat .. wrong, is acl the way to go here?
2010-04-24T02:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	chmod is fine but 777 may be to permisive. you can create a group for the people that will be accessing the files and give perm to that gropu....
2010-04-24T02:29:00.000Z	tar-	erUSUL	thx, 644?
2010-06-28T20:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	tar-	man bash INVOCATION  section
