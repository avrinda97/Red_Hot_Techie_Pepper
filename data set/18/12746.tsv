2006-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	puff		So, my best bet might be to download & burn an ubuntu install CD on a friend's mach ine.
2006-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	puff		Can I install-from-CD  while preserving all of my user data, etc, from my current install?
2006-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	puff		Hello?
2006-10-12T05:31:00.000Z	puff		Okay, so while I am waiting for the ubuntu i386 CD image to download, is there any other route to take or is reinstalling while being careful at the prompts to preserve my old user info still the best bet?
2006-10-12T05:31:00.000Z	kitche	puff	backup if you can
2007-06-11T06:47:00.000Z	puff	kitche	Why not just apt-get sun-java5-jdk?
2007-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	kitche	puff	umm hard to do that when I m on FreeBSD
2007-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	puff	kitche	Then why are you in #ubuntu? :-)
2007-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	kitche	puff	but I rather try out the open source stuff before
2007-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	kitche	puff	helping :)
2007-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	puff	kitche	Ah, well thanks.
2007-06-11T06:49:00.000Z	puff	kitche	FWIW, I"m a java developer, been developing java apps on linux for, oh, about five or six years.
2007-06-11T06:49:00.000Z	kitche	puff	I had javac installed on Source Mage but I kinda stopped working on that project before I finished the spell for javac and hotspot
2007-06-11T06:50:00.000Z	kitche	puff	well considering it's still sun's stuff :)
2007-06-11T06:51:00.000Z	kitche	puff	since FreeBSD actually has a port for sun java but haven't tried it myself yet since I don't do java programming anymore really
2007-06-11T06:51:00.000Z	puff	kitche	Yeah, what do you do instead?
2007-06-11T06:52:00.000Z	kitche	puff	well I m in college right now I know java javascript and going to learn VB but I work as a housekeeper right now :)
2007-06-11T06:56:00.000Z	puff	kitche	Ah, well, good luck then.
