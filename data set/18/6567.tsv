2008-05-01T09:16:00.000Z	smee		i need help getting my wireless card to see the available networks...can someone help me out?
2008-05-01T09:17:00.000Z	Randomizer	smee	Do you know if your wireless already configured?
2008-05-01T09:17:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i'm not sure
2008-05-01T09:18:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i'm new to linux
2008-05-01T09:19:00.000Z	Randomizer	smee	if you are comfortable with using terminal, there guide I used is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=684495. Though there might (probably) be more straightforward approaches, depending on your card
2008-05-01T09:20:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i'm not too comfortable.  i spent about 10 hrs last night and maybe 4 hrs tonight trying with no luck
2008-05-01T09:21:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i don't really know what i'm doing.  i tried following some procedures that i saw on some web pages, but i guess i didn't do it right
2008-05-01T09:22:00.000Z	Randomizer	smee	is this upgrade or new install?
2008-05-01T09:22:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	new install...8.04
2008-05-01T09:23:00.000Z	Randomizer	smee	You might want to check if your driver is supported (especially if it is a very new or exotic wireless card / board)
2008-05-01T09:24:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i think it is (atheros ar242x)
2008-05-01T09:26:00.000Z	Randomizer	smee	Have you tried seeing/following http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766529&highlight=atheros?
2008-05-01T09:34:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i tried the madwifi thing, but it didn't help.  i'm not sure how i missed that thread.  i'm on dual-boot, so i have to switch OSes.  i'll go give i another try.
2008-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i appreciate the help.  hopefully one of those will do the trick.
2008-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	Randomizer	smee	When I had issue, I found it VERY useful to get a second computer/laptop to surf while setting up wifi (or hoowing up an ethernet connection)
2008-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i have a desktop too, but it won't let any irc program connect to the servers for some reason
2008-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	for now i just have to keep hopping back and forth, i guess
2008-05-01T09:40:00.000Z	smee	Randomizer	i'll be back in a little while..thanks again for the help.
