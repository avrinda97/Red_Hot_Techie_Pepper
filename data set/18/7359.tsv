2012-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	dos000		this is sytem has some fiber cards ... how cani stop ubuntu 12.04 live cd from detecting all the medias and mounting them ?
2012-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	run:  dmesg | less      read the lefthand value and look for large gaps
2012-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	I also recommend you test your RAM using memtest from grub
2012-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	i know most of the errors are coming from an /dev/sdd and /dev/sde devices
2012-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	have you fsck'd them in liveCD?
2012-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	i can see the i/o errors from dmesg
2012-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	you could also use the ultimate boot cd to test the drives using the drive manufacturers testing tool
2012-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	i am just booting .. for now :-)
2012-09-09T15:14:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	for now all i want is the livecd to stop detecting them
2012-09-09T15:15:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	there is no boot settings to stop detecting scsi drives ?
2012-09-09T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	you could blacklist the module used for the controller
2012-09-09T15:16:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	and i can do that from the boot menu ?
2012-09-09T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	its a boot option, for grub
2012-09-09T15:18:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	i know the device name ... how do i figure the module and the controller ?
2012-09-09T15:19:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	lsof would do ?
2012-09-09T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dos000	lsmod   maybe
2012-09-09T15:27:00.000Z	dos000	ActionParsnip	thanks a lot dude :-)
