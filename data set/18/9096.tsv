2007-05-10T11:38:00.000Z	rm130		hell when i try to install opera, i get this error: This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'opera' the conflicting software must be removed before.
2007-05-10T11:38:00.000Z	rm130		Switch to the advanced mode to resolve this conflict.
2007-05-10T11:39:00.000Z	rm130		yes?
2007-05-10T11:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	how are you installing it?
2007-05-10T11:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	Hit enter instead of shift, sorry :P
2007-05-10T11:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	Try synaptic (system > administration > synaptic)
2007-05-10T11:40:00.000Z	rm130	Stormx2	it is not in synaptic
2007-05-10T11:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	But it is under Add/Remove programs? Are you sure?
2007-05-10T11:42:00.000Z	rm130	Stormx2	I switched to main server and i see it
2007-05-10T11:42:00.000Z	rm130	Stormx2	it says Depends: libc6 (>=2.5-0ubuntu1) but 2.4-1ubuntu12.3 is to be installed
2007-05-10T11:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	Looks like an old version
2007-05-10T11:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	Which repo did you add?
2007-05-10T11:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	Please state your ubuntu version. Dapper?
2007-05-10T11:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	The version in the repos is only for dapper...
2007-05-10T11:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	http://www.opera.com/download/
2007-05-10T11:45:00.000Z	rm130	Stormx2	yeah, just downloaded and installed
2007-05-10T11:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	rm130	Ah, you're one step ahead of me.
