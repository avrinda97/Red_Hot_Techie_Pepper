2010-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	Saik		tried mounting it on command line?
2010-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	Saik		er... in terminal
2010-10-21T07:59:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	he already confirmed the format is fubar by checking it in windows
2010-10-21T08:00:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	only question is why?  either the size of the drive is being reported as too small due to the usb enclosure being broken, or somehow wd just formatted it broken
2010-10-21T08:00:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	I'd try forcing a mount and see what happens personally
2010-10-21T08:01:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	the fact it runs in wodows fine shows that it's a driver issue in linux, not the drive itself most likely
2010-10-21T08:03:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	it doesn't run in windows fine... he ran a chkdsk on it and it reported a similar error
2010-10-21T08:04:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	not what he said a minute ago..
2010-10-21T08:05:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	he mounts in windows, but that is because windows is stupid... I had him run a chkdsk /f and it reported a similar error... I'd really like to figure out if the detected size of the drive is wrong or not but WD's frigging web site doesn't give technical specs for that product
2010-10-21T08:07:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	yea, but exactly how many sectors is that drive supposed to have?  because the partition is a few larger than the total detected size of the drive
2010-10-21T08:10:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	User Sectors Per Drive 3,907,029,168
2010-10-21T08:10:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	where'd you get that?

2010-10-21T08:11:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	that's the drive I have... but I'm not sure if it is the one sean has
2010-10-21T08:14:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	it's close
2010-10-21T08:15:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	the wd drives are withing 20 sectors-ish of each other
2010-10-21T08:15:00.000Z	psusi	Saik	need an exact number
2010-10-21T08:18:00.000Z	Saik	psusi	no luck on finding an exact
