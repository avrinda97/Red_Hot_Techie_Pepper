2006-11-30T14:13:00.000Z	mordof		alright, so i'm trying to wine install photoshop cs2.. i've heard about people getting photoshop to work.. i get through the entire installation, however when i click install.. it fails and says nothing changed, then finished.. anyone experienced this? possibly have a solution?
2006-11-30T14:14:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	the wine appdb seems to indicate Photoshop CS will not work.
2006-11-30T14:15:00.000Z	mordof	ArrenLex	Franks wine app thing has it running :S odd
2006-11-30T14:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	ah, so it does. Hell if I know.
2006-11-30T14:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	ah, actually, look at the wine version they're running. 0.9.8.
2006-11-30T14:16:00.000Z	mordof	ArrenLex	hmm.. that's old?
2006-11-30T14:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	it's a well-known fact that nothing ever works in Wine for more than three versions at a time.
2006-11-30T14:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	yes it is. But you should try it.
2006-11-30T14:17:00.000Z	mordof	ArrenLex	repos have 0.9.9... i'm no good at compiling wine to work, lol
2006-11-30T14:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	try 0.9.9, then, I guess.
2006-11-30T14:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	although compiling wine is super easy.
2006-11-30T14:19:00.000Z	mordof	ArrenLex	if i need to compile it to try would you be able to help me out if i run into any problems?
2006-11-30T14:19:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	I could certainly try.
2006-11-30T14:19:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	Actually, no, because I kind of have to slep.
2006-11-30T14:52:00.000Z	mordof	ArrenLex	do you know if/what language that is
2006-11-30T14:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	it's chinese.
2006-11-30T14:52:00.000Z	mordof	ArrenLex	ohh
2006-11-30T14:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex	mordof	or would be, if gaim supported it.
