2005-12-29T07:12:00.000Z	chaoticgeek		ok, I still do not understand what this guy said above
2005-12-29T07:12:00.000Z	chaoticgeek		I was wondering if someone would be able to help me. I'm having problems with azureus. I to have it so I can type 'azureus' in the command line and have it start up azureus
2005-12-29T07:12:00.000Z	chaoticgeek		I have azureus in /usr/local/share and I tried making a symbolic link to /usr/bin
2005-12-29T07:12:00.000Z	chaoticgeek		but it still does not work, anyone know where I can go get help? or can help me?
2005-12-29T07:12:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	and then....?
2005-12-29T07:13:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	i believe /usr/local/share is a very very untraditional location for binaries
2005-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	chaoticgeek	bshumate	any suggestions then?
2005-12-29T07:15:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	however, assuming this azureus  is the binary, and is located in /usr/local/share, then the link made by doing : ln -s /usr/local/share/azureus /usr/bin/azureus should make it work....provided some really odd condition such as "/usr/bin" missing from your path is not in effect
2005-12-29T07:16:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	and if you type at the prompt:  /usr/local/share/azureus ?
2005-12-29T07:16:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	it does work?
2005-12-29T07:18:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	ok...then do : sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/azareus
2005-12-29T07:18:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	then : ln -s  /usr/local/share/azureus/azureus /usr/bin/azureus
2005-12-29T07:19:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	cause you said earlier you made a link to */usr/local/share/azureus* and that is not the correct path
2005-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	what is your error?  and is there not a better bittorrent client for gnu/linux than azureus?
2005-12-29T07:24:00.000Z	chaoticgeek	bshumate	this is my error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6099
2005-12-29T07:26:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	classpath issues...typical java crap.  paste to pastebin the output from :  echo $CLASSPATH
2005-12-29T07:27:00.000Z	chaoticgeek	bshumate	its a blank line
2005-12-29T07:28:00.000Z	bshumate	chaoticgeek	ok...una momento pleeze
