2010-02-25T23:23:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	do you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed? totem uses gstreamer ... mplayer uses xine ... also see that you have all gstreamer plugins installed (i.e. good, mad, bad & ugly)
2010-02-25T23:26:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	yeah I have extras installed, I know gstreamer wanted to use pulseaudio, but with that removed (which worked btw) and gs-alsa installed instead surely it should start to use alsa
2010-02-25T23:27:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	any ideas, all the bad, good plugins are installed etc
2010-02-25T23:28:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	do you have the multimedia systems selector installed?
2010-02-25T23:29:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	^
2010-02-25T23:29:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	just looking and totem-gstreamer isn't installed though
2010-02-25T23:29:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	install it
2010-02-25T23:30:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	fingers crossed, is there a rhythmbox-gstreamer too?! ;)
2010-02-25T23:31:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	Personally I don't like rhythmbox .. you might like Amaork better and it uses xine
2010-02-25T23:32:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	tried most of the media players, rb will do me fine (i switched to linux due to the look/scope of amarok years ago)... this is a friends box and I can honestly say I've never had much trouble on the audio front with linux, but trying to remove pulse and use alsa for multichannel surround is proving a pain in the backside
2010-02-25T23:33:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	still no sounds
2010-02-25T23:38:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	I'm  stumped , audio is not my strong point when it comes to linux, however I am happy with stereo, so 5.1 would be a dream come true for most, not everything is 100%
2010-02-25T23:45:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	still no joy after a session restart
2010-02-25T23:45:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	ugh, uh, IDK
2010-02-25T23:45:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	I get system sounds, which is strange but nothing from totem/rb
2010-02-25T23:46:00.000Z	fccf	JeffMcBiscuit	Gstreamer is not setup properly ... or you are missing something
2010-02-25T23:46:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	no worries, I'm getting to the stage where I want to drop this nettop out of a very high open window
2010-02-25T23:48:00.000Z	JeffMcBiscuit	fccf	I've looked through and can't see anything that is untoward
