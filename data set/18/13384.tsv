2005-11-27T17:13:00.000Z	amonroy		is there a way to tell apt-get to download the unmet dependencies? I tried apt-get install apache2, and I get the following unmet dependencies: apache2-mpm-worker, apache2-mpm-prefork and apache2-mpm-prechild. Fine, but now I found that apache2-mpm-prefork has other unmet dependencies. Is there a way apt-get would just get all the dependencies automatically?
2005-11-27T17:14:00.000Z	amonroy		well, before that I got the repository list form ubuntuguide.org
2005-11-27T17:15:00.000Z	amonroy		do you think that's where I screw it LjL?
2005-11-27T17:15:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	stop where you are .
2005-11-27T17:16:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	get rid of the sources.list you got from ubuntuguide and use the one for your system (and hope you haven't botched up anything important)
2005-11-27T17:19:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	what did you upgrade from?
2005-11-27T17:21:00.000Z	amonroy	nalioth	I did apt-get update and also apt-get upgrade, but I think both failed
2005-11-27T17:27:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	type "sudo apt-get -f install"
2005-11-27T17:27:00.000Z	amonroy	nalioth	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2005-11-27T17:28:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	ubuntu_noob yes, when the process is finished
2005-11-27T17:28:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	are you any good with a terminal only?
2005-11-27T17:29:00.000Z	amonroy	nalioth	I think I could be better, but I like the terminal only
2005-11-27T17:30:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	good. try "sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop" using your new sources.list (you may lose gnome during this, which is why i asked about your terminal skills)
2005-11-27T17:31:00.000Z	amonroy	nalioth	I go this: Reinstallation of ubuntu-desktop is not possible, it cannot be downloaded.
2005-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	amonroy	nalioth	all I want is to run apache, php, and drupal :-/
2005-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	as long as you have those non ubuntu packages installed, you will have lots of problems
2005-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	amonroy	nalioth	would you say it's easier to install again? (I can do that if needed and if it's faster()
2005-11-27T17:33:00.000Z	nalioth	amonroy	if you have no data to lose, go ahead. just dont visit the ubuntuguide this time, come here instead
