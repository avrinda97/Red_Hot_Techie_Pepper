2011-12-17T01:31:00.000Z	beblah		hi.. i just installed 11.10, is there a package manager already installed by default?
2011-12-17T01:31:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	yes
2011-12-17T01:32:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	in the menu?
2011-12-17T01:56:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	I actually have the 4311 as well, and I just got it  to work
2011-12-17T01:56:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	do you have the STA driver installed from "Additional Drivers" ?
2011-12-17T01:58:00.000Z	beblah	abstrakt	can i download it to a flashdrive and install from that?
2011-12-17T02:00:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	you don't want the STA driver, you want the b34 driver
2011-12-17T02:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	go to Applications -> Settings -> Additional Drivers
2011-12-17T02:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	is the STA driver both present and "activated"? it will have a green circle if it is activated.
2011-12-17T02:02:00.000Z	beblah	abstrakt	it only says No proprietary drivers are installed
2011-12-17T02:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	ok good
2011-12-17T02:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2011-12-17T02:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer
2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	then reboot, and hopefully your card should "just work"
2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	I just did this about an hour ago
2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	beblah	abstrakt	ok, but my only option is to connect via ethernet at this point?
2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	yes, you will need to connect via ethernet
2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	beblah	yes
