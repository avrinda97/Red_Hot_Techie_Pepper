2010-02-26T20:10:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	indeed it is
2010-02-26T20:11:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	I missed that he wanted a directory and not a file
2010-02-26T20:11:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	-O is for a file
2010-02-26T20:12:00.000Z	sbts	rifter	Yep sure is, use it all the time, but had to check man page for -P
2010-02-26T20:27:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	agreed for this sort of thing hosts is more than adequate
2010-02-26T20:39:00.000Z	sbts	rifter	good catch :) I totally missed that :(
2010-02-26T20:40:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	yeah I was looking at something else when that exchange wen on
2010-02-26T20:41:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	personally I would never use a ~ in fstab. it would probably work in ubuntu, but it gives me chills
2010-02-26T21:00:00.000Z	sbts	rifter	track the info I am giving to phox_
2010-02-26T21:30:00.000Z	sbts	rifter	phox_ unfortunately for this sort of thing, where you are churning over the whole disk as a single file, and also potentially have errors on the disk external enclosures cause more trouble than they are worth, much more reliable to have the drive connected direct to a machine.
2010-02-26T21:31:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	sure but if he does that he'llneed an adapter,too, isn't that adding the same level of complexity?
2010-02-26T21:39:00.000Z	sbts	rifter	no the adapter for an ide laptop drive is just a physical connector adapter, no electronics involved
2010-02-26T22:30:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	yes but if you're already doing scp, what's inthe way of rsync?  increased cpu load?
2010-02-26T22:33:00.000Z	sbts	rifter	I have run across security setups that allow scp but block rsync, and sometimes presharedkey only ssh doesn't play with rsync well, there are also other things like versions, and remote OS (eg scp from a remote windows box is easier than rsync)
2010-02-26T22:35:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	good to know
2010-02-26T22:36:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	but if they're blocking rsync, eithe rtey're blocking rsyncd,or if you are syaing that even rsync over ssh is not working they are somehow blocking applcations with packet analysis of some kind versus blocking ports
2010-02-26T22:36:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	which in the case of rsync would be weird, but ok :D
2010-02-26T22:37:00.000Z	rifter	sbts	then again I have sen security setups that block ssh as a security risk, and so require telnet and rsh as "more secure" :D
