2012-08-20T09:39:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	try alsamixer in a terminal and check your levels
2012-08-20T09:40:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	also make sure you have the right output device selected
2012-08-20T09:41:00.000Z	hanslanda	histo	how im gonna know i have the right output device selected?...i have 2....one is intel and other nvidia ...i think its intel
2012-08-20T09:46:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	yes mostlikely it's the intel device. the Nvidia device is probably for sound over hdmi
2012-08-20T09:49:00.000Z	hanslanda	histo	nobody is helping me, ive already selected intel...but nothing happens...all sounds muted...but the sound icon is like it was with sound.
2012-08-20T09:52:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	can you open alsamixer in a terminal and ensure that the pcm and master volumes aren't muted
2012-08-20T09:52:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	also what sound settings were you changing?
2012-08-20T09:54:00.000Z	hanslanda	histo	aeon-ltd , i was changing microfone volume ... here http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-20-08-2012-025346.php

2012-08-20T09:58:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	click select controls and select your channels
2012-08-20T09:59:00.000Z	hanslanda	histo	these 2 channels only? http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-20-08-2012-025917.php
2012-08-20T10:01:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	I would have pcm visible
2012-08-20T10:02:00.000Z	hanslanda	histo	http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-20-08-2012-030232.php    ....and still no sound

2012-08-20T10:10:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	I'd enable all controls and make sure you didn't tick a switch or mute one that is needed
2012-08-20T10:11:00.000Z	histo	hanslanda	also asking in xubuntu may get your more help if that's what you are using.
2012-08-20T10:11:00.000Z	hanslanda	histo	thank you
