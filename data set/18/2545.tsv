2012-03-31T14:41:00.000Z	appi_uppi		can i change the tcp tuning parameters in ubuntu 10.04 to speed upload and download of data?
2012-03-31T14:42:00.000Z	appi_uppi		i'm trying to change the tcp kernel settings to increase data transfer rates
2012-03-31T14:43:00.000Z	fidel	appi_uppi	why do you think youshould do so?
2012-03-31T14:44:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	downloading and uploading takes lots of time
2012-03-31T14:44:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	i'm using accer 5536 and installed ubuntu 10.04.. since then the network performance is poor
2012-03-31T14:45:00.000Z	fidel	appi_uppi	so you expect the default settings to be unoptimized and allusers to modify their tcp-settings manually?
2012-03-31T14:45:00.000Z	fidel	appi_uppi	i dont think youshould mess around in that area - at least not if you are really knowing what you do ;)
2012-03-31T14:46:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	hmm
2012-03-31T14:47:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	not exactly.. but i have configure openssh-hpn patched ssh and then changed the tcp kernel settings as per http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/sshd-server-optimization.html
2012-03-31T14:47:00.000Z	fidel		measure your down & up speed over time (1 week) compare it with other boxes in your local network - keep in mind that most internet-lines arent per se sycghron dsl lines etc
2012-03-31T14:47:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	since then i see massive gain in transfer rates
2012-03-31T14:48:00.000Z	appi_uppi		i see
2012-03-31T14:48:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	but when i use windows the transfer rates are quite good when compared to linux
2012-03-31T14:49:00.000Z	fidel	appi_uppi	well then - do whatever you think youshould do . cant help you there
2012-03-31T14:49:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	do you think ubuntu doesn't have proper drivers for accer 5536
2012-03-31T14:49:00.000Z	appi_uppi		?
2012-03-31T14:49:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	i wont do :)
2012-03-31T14:50:00.000Z	appi_uppi	fidel	i was checking before i mess up
