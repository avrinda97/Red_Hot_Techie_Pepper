2005-10-04T11:19:00.000Z	MMXGN		anybody has managed to have ati opengl acceleration with breezy and is able to help me?
2005-10-04T11:19:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	what's the problem?
2005-10-04T11:20:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	what have you done so far? what all have you installed and configured?
2005-10-04T11:21:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log for DRI errors for more information as to why it's not loading
2005-10-04T11:21:00.000Z	MMXGN	Quinthius	done that too, wait
2005-10-04T11:23:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	do an lsmod | grep fglrx, it list anything?
2005-10-04T11:24:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	and you're sure you installed the restricted modules of the same version as your kernel?
2005-10-04T11:25:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	dmesg | grep fglrx, anything there that looks like an error?
2005-10-04T11:26:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	and have you rebooted?
2005-10-04T11:26:00.000Z	MMXGN	Quinthius	plenty of times
2005-10-04T11:27:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	can you paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2005-10-04T11:30:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	hmm, looks fine except for GLcore, you dont have to load it as DRI should automatically include it
2005-10-04T11:30:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	and i'm not sure what i2c is... i don't have that in mine
2005-10-04T11:31:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	i dont think it's the problem but who knows... the only suspicious thing i'm seeing so far is in the DRI warnings where it says unknown third-party board...
2005-10-04T11:34:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	you could try a "sudo depmod -ae" and then rebooting
2005-10-04T11:35:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	rebuilds module dependency cache or something..
2005-10-04T11:35:00.000Z	Quinthius	MMXGN	what board do you have? 9600xt?
2005-10-04T11:36:00.000Z	MMXGN	Quinthius	yes
