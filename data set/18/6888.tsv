2011-05-08T20:04:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	could it be e-addressbookfactory?
2011-05-08T19:55:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	I have a love hate relationship with Evolution.. restart the evolution-data-server and see if that helps. .then check out Thunderbird / kontact / Zimbra for alternatives
2011-05-08T19:56:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	it doesn't write files.. it's like the db engine
2011-05-08T19:57:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	ok.. so how do I reboot that server?
2011-05-08T19:58:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	open a terminal and type ... killall evolution-data-server
2011-05-08T19:59:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	no such process:S
2011-05-08T19:59:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	hang on.
2011-05-08T20:00:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	is Evo loaded right now?
2011-05-08T20:00:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	yes..
2011-05-08T20:03:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	hit the Super key and type .. system monitor .. look in the list for Processes and see if you find it there.. might be named a little differrent..
2011-05-08T20:04:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	perhaps.. are you married to evolution?
2011-05-08T20:04:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	not yet, but I like the integration into the panel..
2011-05-08T20:05:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	you can integrate others there too. like thunderbird
2011-05-08T20:06:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	does that have a calendar function?
2011-05-08T20:07:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	you can add a plugin called lightning to it
2011-05-08T20:08:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	not sure you can integrate it but zimbra works well too.. and has many more features. .. kontact from the kde side is also very nice
2011-05-08T20:08:00.000Z	izinucs	tuckje	in unity? I don't know..
2011-05-08T20:14:00.000Z	tuckje	izinucs	will see. thanks anyway
