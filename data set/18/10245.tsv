2010-06-08T17:46:00.000Z	amee2k		i'm using the live CD. is there a way to eject the CD to free up the drive without installing to the hard disk?
2010-06-08T17:47:00.000Z	amee2k		i can neither eject the disk manually nor unmount it
2010-06-08T17:47:00.000Z	amee2k		and i have a hunch overriding the tray lock will lead to disaster
2010-06-08T17:48:00.000Z	amee2k		i do have enough ram to keep the cd content in a ramdisk however, if thats an option
2010-06-08T17:48:00.000Z	amee2k		any hints?
2010-06-08T17:50:00.000Z	amee2k		hu?
2010-06-08T17:51:00.000Z	amee2k		i asked how to eject the live cd while running it
2010-06-08T17:51:00.000Z	arand	amee2k	unless you used TORAM=yes when booting it, there is a very good reson it won't allow ejection...
2010-06-08T17:52:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	yeah, because it keeps it mounted i suppose
2010-06-08T17:53:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	i'll try the toram=yes thing
2010-06-08T17:55:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	is capitalization in TORAM=yes important?
2010-06-08T17:56:00.000Z	arand	amee2k	I'm not sure, but I know it worked for me WITH, capitalization.
2010-06-08T18:30:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	hmmm... now its freezing on boot :(
2010-06-08T18:41:00.000Z	arand	amee2k	Well, it needs to load the whole CD to RAM, it will take a while...
2010-06-08T18:43:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	the cd drive is inactive. its spun down and i can even take out the disk
2010-06-08T18:44:00.000Z	arand	amee2k	Hmm, well in that case, maybe it failed, I'm not sure if there was a huge amount of testing done with the option, it was simply enabled, since a long-standing bug had been fixed which blocked it, might now work for your machine then :(
2010-06-08T18:45:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	i see. to be sure i checked the cd for defects but it came out fine.
2010-06-08T18:45:00.000Z	amee2k	arand	i'll think up something different then... thanks for the hint though :)
