2007-02-20T17:07:00.000Z	Demolitio		i have a big problem... i tried to install xgl, on the latest edgy,  came up with an error saying that the files were no found, and crashed xserver. i removed the entries i made in gdm.conf_custom and Xsession, and now i can't log in to my default profile. im talking to you guys through the root account, and have less administration options in gnome than i did with the account that is crashing. suggestions? am i screwed?
2007-02-20T17:08:00.000Z	Demolitio		it just crashes the xsession literally in 2 seconds.
2007-02-20T17:09:00.000Z	Demolitio		@ hyperactivecrond will the new account i make give me access again to the synaptic package manager?
2007-02-20T17:10:00.000Z	Demolitio		hmm thanks.
2007-02-20T17:10:00.000Z	Demolitio		thanks... gtg someone is honking his horn at me. :P later all.
2007-02-20T09:56:00.000Z	Demolitio		after messing up my default account and having to make another user account, sound is no longer working for me. when i try to access volume control, i get an error message, "No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found". my soundcard is listed in device manager. any suggestions?
2007-02-20T09:57:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Demolitio	check in /etc/group that your new account is in the audio group, maybe?
2007-02-20T09:57:00.000Z	Demolitio		@intuitiveNipple you know what, as a matter of fact i didnt. checking now.
2007-02-20T09:57:00.000Z	Demolitio		<- new to linux
2007-02-20T09:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Demolitio	if you add it, make sure to *APPEND* using (-a) e.g.  moduser -aG audio <user>
2007-02-20T09:59:00.000Z	Demolitio	IntuitiveNipple	: aded to group. do i have to restart?
2007-02-20T09:59:00.000Z	Demolitio		just added.
2007-02-20T09:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		Demolio - I think it helps, unless you just restart your sound services
2007-02-20T09:59:00.000Z	Demolitio		k
2007-02-20T10:01:00.000Z	Demolitio		@intuitiveNipple well... just heard a soft popping noise form my 5.1 system.... sounds like that did it. restarting.
