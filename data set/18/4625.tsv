2010-05-17T20:19:00.000Z	raymondjtoth		!ext3
2010-05-17T20:19:00.000Z	acicula	raymondjtoth	you can not downgrade a filesystem
2010-05-17T20:19:00.000Z	acicula	raymondjtoth	if you want to revert to ext3 you have to wipe and reinstall
2010-05-17T20:19:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	acicula	what i do now if want that?
2010-05-17T20:20:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	acicula	what i do if do do that
2010-05-17T20:21:00.000Z	acicula	raymondjtoth	during the ubuntu installation when asked to partition you have to choose manual partition and select ext3
2010-05-17T20:21:00.000Z	acicula	raymondjtoth	why do you think ext4 is not agreeing with your laptop
2010-05-17T20:21:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	acicula	i wnat to use all of the drive also can i do that
2010-05-17T20:21:00.000Z	acicula	raymondjtoth	yeah
2010-05-17T20:23:00.000Z	acicula	raymondjtoth	slow gfx performance seems unrelated to the filesystem that is in use, reverting to ext3 seems unlikely to solve whatever problem you appear to be encountering
2010-05-17T20:24:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	acicula	ok what then i do
2010-05-17T20:25:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	acicula	 9.10 for now
