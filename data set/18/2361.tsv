2011-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	flametai1	ActionParsnip	It is, but I'm unsure if it's possible to put Linux on. And have it operatable of course. Considering Linux can go onto anything.
2011-08-17T10:01:00.000Z	flametai1	ActionParsnip	I saw a thread about it but people were saying the touch didn't work I believe.
2011-08-17T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flametai1	put ubuntu on an SD card etc and boot to it, see how it goes
2011-08-17T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flametai1	assuming it can boot SD card
2011-08-17T10:02:00.000Z	flametai1	ActionParsnip	I suppose I could. Just didn't want to waste my time lol
2011-08-17T10:04:00.000Z	flametai1	ActionParsnip	lxpanel? So you are not running Ubuntu then I assume?
2011-08-17T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flametai1	lxde is in the repos, it uses lxpanel

2011-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flametai1	not sure what the difference is. I just use what's there. There are plenty of comparison sites talking about the differences
2011-08-17T10:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flametai1	tbh, I usually pull it off and just use abiword, I don't fully use openoffice so I save resources (makes a faster pc :))
