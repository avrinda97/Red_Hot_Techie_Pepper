2007-10-30T11:56:00.000Z	bloony		militantpotato : it says it cant find the device
2007-10-30T11:57:00.000Z	bloony	warbler	I get some error

2007-10-30T11:58:00.000Z	warbler	bloony	then the install didn't load grub - since it can't be found - try an install without the /boot and see what happens
2007-10-30T11:58:00.000Z	bloony		militantpotato: Format of install_device not recognized.
2007-10-30T11:59:00.000Z	bloony	warbler	tried without the /boot to..
2007-10-30T11:59:00.000Z	warbler	bloony	on a completely formatted drive?
2007-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	bloony	warbler	yes the grub does not load in install I think.. cause when it comes to configuring bootloader the window just disapear
2007-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	bloony	warbler	I delete all the partitions in fdisk .. can I do anything more?
2007-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	warbler	bloony	next advice is to try the checksum against your cd - to see if it is faulty
2007-10-30T12:02:00.000Z	bloony	warbler	checked the cd 4 times now :)
2007-10-30T12:04:00.000Z	bloony	warbler	but can I do anything more than deleting the partitions in fdisk? to format it completly I mean
2007-10-30T12:04:00.000Z	bloony		?
2007-10-30T12:08:00.000Z	warbler	bloony	as far as I know that should be all you need to do
