2006-05-13T11:57:00.000Z	yonatan	brandon_	"Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1."
2006-05-13T11:59:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	does lsmod list a module that is likely to be running the card?

2006-05-13T12:01:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	what type of card is it?
2006-05-13T12:02:00.000Z	yonatan	brandon_	lsusb says: "0000:01:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)"
2006-05-13T12:03:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	i see a module for it
2006-05-13T12:04:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	rt8169. now type modinfo rt8169
2006-05-13T12:05:00.000Z	yonatan	brandon_	"modinfo: could not find module rt8169"
2006-05-13T12:06:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	wait, it's r8169

2006-05-13T12:09:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	you should be able to use the networking configuration program to add the card as eth1
2006-05-13T12:09:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	if not, it should set it up automatically when you restart
2006-05-13T12:09:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	at least there's a module being loaded. that's 2/3 of hte battle right there
2006-05-13T12:10:00.000Z	yonatan	brandon_	by "networking configuration program" do you mean network-admin? Had to shut-down and reboot bcs adding the card@pci slot and lol at battle...
2006-05-13T12:10:00.000Z	yonatan	brandon_	well, thanks for your help, I'll carry on trawling the forums for more answers.....
2006-05-13T12:11:00.000Z	brandon_	yonatan	yes, network admin
