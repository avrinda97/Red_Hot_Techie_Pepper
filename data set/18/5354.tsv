2008-11-07T18:11:00.000Z	depape		hello, i've got some question about kernel modules from ubuntu-backports: im using the ath5k wlan driver from ubuntu-backport, 1) how do i know about the version/date of the driver i get from ubuntu-backports 2) is there a clever way to always get the latest version of the driver? its buggy on my nc10

2008-11-07T18:14:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	did you configure the repository correctly in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2008-11-07T18:14:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	if yes, aptitude or apt for that matter should display what you need to
2008-11-07T18:14:00.000Z	depape	jollyroger	well, all that i did was i enabled backports via the package-sources gui
2008-11-07T18:15:00.000Z	depape	jollyroger	is there a specific "branch" i can enable to get the very very latest version of ath5k/backports?
2008-11-07T18:17:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	ath5k should be already included in the default kernel
2008-11-07T18:17:00.000Z	jollyroger		why dont you use that one?
2008-11-07T18:17:00.000Z	jollyroger		no backports etc needed
2008-11-07T18:18:00.000Z	depape		well, i read some tutorial in which it sais that i have to turn on backports before using ath5k

2008-11-07T18:20:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	ok, did you follow that tutorial?
2008-11-07T18:21:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	in case you have included the backport-repository, you will receive driver-updates automatically
2008-11-07T18:21:00.000Z	depape	jollyroger	yes, and i am running this on a Samsung NC10 but both drivers (ath5k and madwifi) dont work for me :/
2008-11-07T18:22:00.000Z	depape	jollyroger	via sudo apt-get upgrade? or is there a "testing"-branch
2008-11-07T18:24:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	yes, via  apt-get upgrade. or you can just use synaptic or the system-updater-applet
2008-11-07T18:24:00.000Z	depape	jollyroger	thanks
2008-11-07T18:24:00.000Z	jollyroger	depape	your welcome
