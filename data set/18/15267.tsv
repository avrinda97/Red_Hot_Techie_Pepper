2005-07-02T06:25:00.000Z	tiredbones		On my Hoary system I'm find both Apache and Apache2 installed.
2005-07-02T06:25:00.000Z	tiredbones		Is this normal?
2005-07-02T06:25:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	if you installed them both
2005-07-02T06:26:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	I selected apache for install.
2005-07-02T06:26:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	well, someone else installed the apache2 package
2005-07-02T06:27:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	ok the other user did it. I'm trying to get php4 installed.
2005-07-02T06:28:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	so, install libapache2-mod-php4
2005-07-02T06:35:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	when I installed apache under synaptic it brought in the some of the apache2 as dependences.
2005-07-02T06:37:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	if I uninstall apache using synaptic, I assume it's going to do the reverse. right?
2005-07-02T07:00:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	yes
2005-07-02T07:17:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	perhaps you meant to install libapache2-mod-php4?
2005-07-02T07:21:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	I see the selection for libapache2-mod-php4,is this the only selection I have to make?
2005-07-02T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	ye
2005-07-02T07:21:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	thanks for the help.
2005-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	so, why don't you see what's answering you then?
2005-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	sudo netstat -plnt|grep 80
2005-07-02T10:04:00.000Z	tiredbones	bob2	the reply from netstat -plnt | grep 80 showed nothing listening. So why did the page pop-up/
2005-07-02T10:04:00.000Z	bob2	tiredbones	perhaps your browser is crap and caching it
