2009-02-19T14:52:00.000Z	creek23_		hi, why nautilus telling me that there's no space left (0 bytes) when I just removed more than a 100MB of files?
2009-02-19T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	try df -h
2009-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	creek23_	ActionParsnip	after, df -h, what should i expect to happen?
2009-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	creek23_	ActionParsnip	will it try to clean up?
2009-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	you will see your partition use in (-h)umanly readable form
2009-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	try: sudo apt-get clean
2009-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	creek23_	ActionParsnip	df -h displays... http://pastebin.com/d647f1bbc
2009-02-19T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	you have too much data on /   you are using 6.1Gb or 6.4Gb, you need to uninstall some apps
2009-02-19T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	you home partition is fine, its / you need to empty a little
2009-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	creek23_	ActionParsnip	does ubuntu disallow any new file to be created once it reached critical size limit?
2009-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	i'd imagine so, read through: dpkg -l | less and uninstall apps you don't use
2009-02-19T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	like pdf viewers, grapics packages, digital camera support etc etc
2009-02-19T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	gimp is quite heavy if you never use it, get rid
2009-02-19T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	you need to carve some apps out
2009-02-19T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	check df -h again
2009-02-19T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	you care gonna have to keep trimming
2009-02-19T15:59:00.000Z	creek23_	ActionParsnip	it says -- 6.4G  6.0G   99M  99%
2009-02-19T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	creek23_	do you NEED all the apps in the dpkg -l list?
