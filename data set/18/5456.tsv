2009-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	Tophu		well I was trying to walk through a post on the forums to get my ntrig touchscreen on my hp touchsmart tx2z working and it had me download some .h file or something and to ./configure --enable-wacom --prefix=/usr
2009-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	Tophu		and I get an error when I run that
2009-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	Tophu		I get Bash: ./confifure: no such file or directory
2009-11-01T08:01:00.000Z	jken146	Tophu	you can't run a configure script if there's no file there!  Make sure you're in the right directory.
2009-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	Tophu	jken146	if I give you the lin kto the forum post can you tell me which folder I should be in?
2009-11-01T08:04:00.000Z	jken146	Tophu	go on...

2009-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	Tophu		the post from nema.arpit
2009-11-01T08:07:00.000Z	jken146	Tophu	you should be in the directory of the wacom driver you downloaded
2009-11-01T08:07:00.000Z	Tophu		which is my home folder I think 1 sec
2009-11-01T08:08:00.000Z	Tophu		so I should be in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/drivers/hid/hid-ids.h
2009-11-01T08:08:00.000Z	Tophu		that appears to be where I coppied the file to
2009-11-01T08:08:00.000Z	jken146	Tophu	you download it and then extract it.  Make sure you're in the folder you extracted it to, and that there's a file called configure there.
2009-11-01T08:09:00.000Z	Tophu		gotcha thanks I'll look for that
2009-11-01T08:09:00.000Z	jken146		!raid
2009-11-01T08:10:00.000Z	Tophu		oh dear god I think I 'm recompiling the kernel :-(
2009-11-01T08:11:00.000Z	jken146	Tophu	no, you're just compiling the drivers I think
