2006-04-26T07:34:00.000Z	Xenguy		GNOME question: I killed a GNOME session with Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, and now it won't load completely anymore (no panels, menus, etc).  How can I 'reset' GNOME to a sane/default state?
2006-04-26T07:36:00.000Z	Xenguy		.oO(c'mon gnome-heads, this should be a slam-dunk question, no?)
2006-04-26T07:37:00.000Z	facugaich	Xenguy	wait
2006-04-26T07:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	facugaich	OK
2006-04-26T07:37:00.000Z	facugaich	Xenguy	that happened to me the other day and I just reset my machine and everything was fine
2006-04-26T07:37:00.000Z	facugaich	Xenguy	no need to reset config
2006-04-26T07:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	facugaich	define "reset"
2006-04-26T07:37:00.000Z	facugaich	Xenguy	shutdown -r now
2006-04-26T07:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	facugaich	hrm, OK, I'll ponder
2006-04-26T07:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	facugaich	I'll try the reboot but I'm skeptical -  reboot really should not be necessary or sufficient IMHO
2006-04-26T07:41:00.000Z	facugaich	Xenguy	I agree with the "necessary" part
2006-04-26T07:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	facugaich	let's find out ;-)
