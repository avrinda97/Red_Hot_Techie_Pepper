2008-09-14T23:22:00.000Z	jlaeret		Hey, I've been trying to install Skype on a Thinkpad x61 tablet, ubuntu 8.04. However when running the package installer it says: Error: Wrong architecture 'i386'. What could this be? This is an intel computer, and the package name is: skype-debian_2.2.0.0.72-1_i386.deb
2008-09-14T23:23:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	are you running 64bit ubuntu?
2008-09-14T23:23:00.000Z	jlaeret		no, I'm running the regular 32 bit
2008-09-14T23:24:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	that doesn't make too much sense, the package may be malformed
2008-09-14T23:24:00.000Z	jlaeret		keepsake and chubs: I downloaded it straight from www.skype.com they have a section called Ubuntu, that's where I got the package from. It's a bit strange.
2008-09-14T23:25:00.000Z	jlaeret	MrKennie	what do you mean?
2008-09-14T23:25:00.000Z	jlaeret		ah, thanks, I'll try
2008-09-14T23:26:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	and paste the output
2008-09-14T23:26:00.000Z	jlaeret		ay
2008-09-14T23:26:00.000Z	jlaeret		x86_64
2008-09-14T23:26:00.000Z	jlaeret		does that mean I've got a 64 bit installation? I know for a fact my computer is 32 bit...
2008-09-14T23:27:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	that's 64bit. you can force install the package as long as you have 32bit libraries installed and it'll work fine
2008-09-14T23:27:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	your computer must be 64bit compatible ;) you wouldn't have been able to install it
2008-09-14T23:27:00.000Z	jlaeret		PaMaNta: I'm trying to install skype on ubuntu 8.04
2008-09-14T23:28:00.000Z	jlaeret		chubs: well, that's a positive surprise I guess! Haha. Do you know how I try and force the installation?
2008-09-14T23:29:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	forgot the command, give me a minute
2008-09-14T23:29:00.000Z	jlaeret		thanks!
2008-09-14T23:30:00.000Z	chubs_	jlaeret	sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture
