2006-10-07T07:03:00.000Z	odyssevs		cat /etc/lsb-release shows the version
2006-10-07T07:03:00.000Z	odyssevs		still wondering what lsb stands for.
2006-10-07T07:04:00.000Z	odyssevs		ed, sure but it is peculiar to ubuntu surely?
2006-10-07T07:04:00.000Z	odyssevs		I don't recall seeing lsb-release in any other distro.
2006-10-07T07:05:00.000Z	odyssevs		Why bother asking?
2006-10-07T07:06:00.000Z	odyssevs		Why indeed.
2006-10-07T07:08:00.000Z	odyssevs		#apache on undernet.org too.
2006-10-07T07:09:00.000Z	odyssevs		netstat not good enough for you?
2006-10-07T07:09:00.000Z	odyssevs		SuperMiguel.
2006-10-07T07:10:00.000Z	odyssevs		is there a way to print raw data from a serial port?
2006-10-07T07:11:00.000Z	frogzoo	odyssevs	cat /dev/ttyS0
2006-10-07T07:12:00.000Z	odyssevs	frogzoo	have my GPS hooked up.. not seeing a thing, is that normal? (GPS is set to transmit data).
2006-10-07T07:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	odyssevs	you should see something, have you used stty to check line rate & settings?
2006-10-07T07:16:00.000Z	odyssevs	frogzoo	no, I haven't used stty. At this point all I want is to see /any/ sort of data, as useless as it might be.
2006-10-07T07:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	odyssevs	why not connect to the serial port with minicom/kermit ?
2006-10-07T07:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	odyssevs	if you don't set the line rate properly, bad things happen, including the port locking up so you won't see anything
2006-10-07T07:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	odyssevs	check out setserial, or use minicom/kermit to set the line rate
2006-10-07T07:17:00.000Z	odyssevs	frogzoo	with who? Oh. Nothing permanently damaging I hope.
