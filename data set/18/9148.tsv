2007-07-08T06:54:00.000Z	Filthpig	jbraddoc	you can create a symlink to the autostart folder (or something like that, I know how to in kde, but not gnome)
2007-07-08T06:54:00.000Z	jbraddoc		I am using kde
2007-07-08T06:54:00.000Z	Filthpig	jbraddoc	no problem then :)
2007-07-08T06:56:00.000Z	jbraddoc	Filthpig	Where is the autostart folder? And I am wanting this to run when the machine boots, not when KDM loads.
2007-07-08T06:56:00.000Z	Filthpig	jbraddoc	create a symlink for the program to /home/user/.kde/Autostart

2007-07-08T06:56:00.000Z	jbraddoc	Filthpig	I was told that i needed to do something with init.d

2007-07-08T07:02:00.000Z	jbraddoc	Filthpig	Can I just edit rc.local, or is there even one?
