2007-04-30T07:14:00.000Z	dan__		Anyone know what a great music program is for a huge library of music and that has the feature to be able to edit the metadata of the music file...And also that the program has last.fm support?
2007-04-30T07:16:00.000Z	Thorondor	dan__	XMMS can also do all the staff you mentioned before
2007-04-30T07:16:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	does it also look nice? I am a very picky person, sorry. lol
2007-04-30T07:17:00.000Z	Thorondor	dan__	hahaah, XMMS looks just like Winamp of Window$
2007-04-30T07:17:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	ah, i see. i will check it out.
2007-04-30T07:18:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	Do you know what might be the problem when I try to tag a song's metadata in Rhythmbox and it gives me a GStream error?
2007-04-30T07:18:00.000Z	Thorondor	dan__	XMMs is quite good, but make sure you install the extension to play last.fm
2007-04-30T07:18:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	ok.
2007-04-30T07:20:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	Do you know what the command is to get the last.fm plugin for XMMS?
2007-04-30T07:20:00.000Z	Thorondor	dan__	I'm not sure about it, because i found the extension surfing in Synaptic
2007-04-30T07:21:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	Oh, ok. I'll just get it there. What is the exact file name of the synaptic file for the plugin?
2007-04-30T07:21:00.000Z	Thorondor	dan__	I suggest you to try Synaptic and do a Search (Name only) with the keyword: xmms
2007-04-30T07:21:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	ok.
2007-04-30T07:23:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	hmm...can't find a last.fm plugin in synaptic...=\
2007-04-30T07:24:00.000Z	Thorondor	dan__	let me see...
2007-04-30T07:26:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	lol =\ I opened up XMMS and it doesn't appeal to me. :(
2007-04-30T07:26:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	Yeah, I'm THAT picky! XD
2007-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	dan__	Thorondor	I think I will try amarok
