2006-08-05T09:02:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: ok, did that command execute without error?
2006-08-05T09:02:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: then, in the same terminal, do 'grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/hda'
2006-08-05T09:02:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: or, maybe /dev/hdc at the end
2006-08-05T09:03:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: the last argument says, where the grub boot manager is installed.
2006-08-05T09:03:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: in most cases, that's the mbr of the first drive, so hda is often right
2006-08-05T09:03:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: oh, forgot the sudo, sorry
2006-08-05T09:04:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/hda

2006-08-05T09:07:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: ok, looks good, try rebooting. if everything went as well as I think it did, you should get your grub.
2006-08-05T09:08:00.000Z	avu		paddy_eire: if not, check your BIOS settings
2006-08-05T09:09:00.000Z	thinh	avu	u there?
2006-08-05T09:11:00.000Z	avu	thinh	yeah. you want to mount a nfs share, right?
2006-08-05T09:11:00.000Z	avu	thinh	please use the channel to communicate with me
2006-08-05T09:12:00.000Z	avu	thinh	has the other linux bos a nfs server ready set up?
2006-08-05T09:12:00.000Z	avu	thinh	are you the admin of both boxen?
2006-08-05T09:13:00.000Z	avu	thinh	Well. I can help you set up NFS vi the command line. I don't know how to do it via GNOME, though.
2006-08-05T09:14:00.000Z	avu	thinh	oh, and, yeah, what dr_willis made ubotu say :)
2006-08-05T09:15:00.000Z	avu	thinh	if enabling NFS really is what disabled samba, that's a bug I think. I have a hard time believing that, though.
