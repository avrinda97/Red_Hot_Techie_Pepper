2010-10-15T18:34:00.000Z	mursalat92	undecim	i changed the nameservers, my /etc/resolv.conf show the new nameserver, but lookups still take a million years
2010-10-15T18:35:00.000Z	undecim	mursalat92	Well, I guess it's not the DNS servers then.
2010-10-15T18:35:00.000Z	undecim	mursalat92	Can you give a pastebin of resolv.conf and any files in /etc/resolvconf?
2010-10-15T18:43:00.000Z	mursalat92	undecim	incidentally, my broweser is trying to lookup paste.ubuntu.com still

2010-10-15T18:46:00.000Z	undecim	mursalat92	What about your /etc/hosts?
2010-10-15T18:47:00.000Z	mursalat92	undecim	http://paste.ubuntu.com/513899/
