2007-05-30T06:11:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	hold on, let me get something for you..............
2007-05-30T06:11:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	Open up your source repository list by going into System/Administration/Software Sources  and on the first tab check all the boxes there to open everything for updates; also uncheck the CD listing in the window at bottom.  You're set to do a system update
2007-05-30T06:13:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	OK?   easy enough?  :)
2007-05-30T06:14:00.000Z	py_geek	sldkfj	hold on...
2007-05-30T06:15:00.000Z	py_geek	sldkfj	i enabled that, but now nothing is coming up...
2007-05-30T06:16:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	next step:    how to update?   open Applications / Accessories / Terminal   and type:  sudo apt-get update
2007-05-30T06:16:00.000Z	sldkfj		hit enter
2007-05-30T06:17:00.000Z	py_geek	sldkfj	it just hit everything...
2007-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	now find 'Synaptic Package Manager' in System/Administration/  and look for search when it gets open and type the item you want in it
2007-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	  sudo apt-get update  .... updated the items available
2007-05-30T06:19:00.000Z	py_geek	sldkfj	okay, thanks, it seems to be installing... i might need u later...
2007-05-30T06:20:00.000Z	sldkfj	py_geek	spend some time in 'Synaptic Package Manager' it's a super tool to know.    glad to help.
