2005-11-24T06:18:00.000Z	benrob_	polpak	ping says: From 192.168.0.1 icmp_seq=5 Destination Host Unreachable
2005-11-24T06:18:00.000Z	benrob_		also, that connection monitor top-right screen says SIOCGIFFLAGS error: No such device... that might be a clue?
2005-11-24T06:18:00.000Z	benrob_		finally, websites say "~could not be found. Please check the name and try again"
2005-11-24T06:19:00.000Z	benrob_		so endeth fact-finding mission. very unstable connection here. I keep disappearing I know.
2005-11-24T06:19:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	looks like a routing issue, though I don't see why it would be
2005-11-24T06:19:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	since you have another machine on that network going through the same route
2005-11-24T06:20:00.000Z	benrob_	polpak	um no other machine. I took the modem to work to test it with windows machine.
2005-11-24T06:20:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	I wish I could help more, but I have to get some sleep. Sorry
2005-11-24T06:21:00.000Z	benrob_	polpak	np. I have to go too. Thanks a MILLION for your time.
2005-11-24T06:21:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	oh. well it looks like there's a problem between the router and the dsl modem
2005-11-24T06:21:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	 Dunno what it could be though
2005-11-24T06:21:00.000Z	benrob_		cant you connect direct to lan port of modem?
2005-11-24T06:22:00.000Z	benrob_		I used to at another house
2005-11-24T06:22:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	you might be able to connect directly to the modem, but you might have to wait for the lease on the DCHP to expire
2005-11-24T06:23:00.000Z	benrob_		I can delete nameservesr from netwrok setup...
2005-11-24T06:23:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	so if you unplug the dsl modem, (power) and then connect directly into it, but wait like 5 mins or so before powering up the modem it might work
2005-11-24T06:23:00.000Z	polpak	benrob	it's not a nameserver issue if you cannot ping to an outside ip though
2005-11-24T06:24:00.000Z	benrob_	polpak	I will try it. well go get some sleep man. Thanks again. you spent a bit o time!
