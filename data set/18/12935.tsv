2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	kennyn		i am just playing around with Apache and Ubuntu
2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	kennyn		i want to set up my own web server
2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	kennyn		everything works fine with localhost
2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	kennyn		but now where do i go
2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	kennyn		i have a domain name already purchased
2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	kennyn		but from here I am stuck
2007-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	have you setup the dns records with your domain provider?
2007-07-31T08:56:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	who did you order your domains from?
2007-07-31T08:56:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	and have you gone through the total dns control tool?
2007-07-31T08:57:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	and you'll need to open up port 80
2007-07-31T08:57:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	then it may be best to look into dyndns or homeip.net...
2007-07-31T08:57:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	yeah. you'll need 80 open and pointing to the web server box
2007-07-31T08:59:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	you need to setup an account with a dynamic dns provider, like homeip.net
2007-07-31T09:00:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	they're all free
2007-07-31T09:00:00.000Z	atoponce	kennyn	i gotta run
