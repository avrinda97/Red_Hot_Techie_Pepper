2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		hi i can't seem to use the log function in C code anymore.. on both desktop and laptop, get this error: findAI.c:(.text+0x1265): undefined reference to `log'
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		even though the code compiled and ran perfectly before
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		i think it was due to an ubuntu update cos a few days ago it was fine
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		sorry
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		but i need the code to compile
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		sigh
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		ok but i don't know which package caused the problem
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean		maybe i'll try booting an older kernel
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bean	have you got the GNU math library (/usr/lib/libm.a) on your link libraries list
2007-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	bean	IntuitiveNipple	how do i check if i do?
2007-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	bean	IntuitiveNipple	i just compile the c code directly, don't use a makefile
2007-01-23T10:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bean	so whats giving you the error then? It sounds like a linker error
2007-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	bean	IntuitiveNipple	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2599/
2007-01-23T10:41:00.000Z	bean	IntuitiveNipple	BlueEagle sorry i mean this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2600/
2007-01-23T10:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bean	that looks to me as if the LOG2 function relies on 'lg' which is in another library
2007-01-23T10:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bean	same answer applies!
2007-01-23T10:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bean	but that error suggests an unresolved external reference
2007-01-23T10:46:00.000Z	bean	IntuitiveNipple	ah nevermind i figured it out
