2011-08-16T01:54:00.000Z	TeknoCool		what shall i do next?
2011-08-16T01:55:00.000Z	TeknoCool		can i do that w/o formating the drive?
2011-08-16T01:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 you format filesystms.. and you repartiton drives to make new partitions you put filesystems on. :)
2011-08-16T01:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 You can resize your partitions/filesystems. to make room for new ones.. depending on your setup.
2011-08-16T01:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 with windows on new machines.. ive rarely seem them do just 1 partition..
2011-08-16T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 so you just want linux on it? or whats the current setup?
2011-08-16T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 i suggest resizeing the windows partitions, and installing linux to its own partition then.  Its Very likely windows 7 made 2 partitions when it installed.
2011-08-16T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 you just need to make enough 'unallocated' space and be sure to not have 4 primary partitins made.. then  ubuntu can partion/install to the unallocated space automatically
2011-08-16T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 just because you have E: dosent mean theres not Other partitons on the disk...
2011-08-16T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 check with the disk manager tool in windows.
2011-08-16T02:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 ive seen some apps in windows crashbadly because of that  quirk. :)
2011-08-16T02:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 exactly.  but back to Ubuntu/linux.. resize your windows partition  You can do it from within windows7, leave a few dozen gb unallocated at the end..  and let the ubuntu installe rdo the rest.
2011-08-16T02:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	TeknoCool	 windows 7 has tools for disk management..
