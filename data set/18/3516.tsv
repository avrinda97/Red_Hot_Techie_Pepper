2011-11-23T23:06:00.000Z	Shwaiil		Q: In Mac OSX there's a panel / widget that let us change current program we're on. Can I find that for Ubuntu too ? whats the name ? Tks for looking
2011-11-23T23:07:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Um, it's on the left, the panel?
2011-11-23T23:09:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Alt-tab?
2011-11-23T23:14:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	I don't like Unity, but... XFCE's great everywhere :D
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	Shwaiil	theadmin	I header about it. But does compiz work on it ?
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	It does, but I'm fine without it
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Compiz is desktop-independent. It works on anything.
2011-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	Shwaiil	theadmin	I see. I'm now checking XFCE and this look light. I sugested my friend to install ubuntu, because he liked what he saw in my machine. but my version is 10.04 . He doesnt like "Unity", I'm wondering if XFCE is easy for him to install without any experience in ubuntu ?
2011-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	Shwaiil	theadmin	i'm asking this because I'm not finding it available in Software center
2011-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	XFCE is, basically, a gnome2 clone :D
2011-11-23T23:18:00.000Z	Shwaiil	theadmin	GNOME2, XFCE, UNITY, etc these are names for desktop-environments. Is that right ?
2011-11-23T23:18:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Yeah.
2011-11-23T23:19:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Well, Unity is just a decoration ("shell") thing that runs on top of GNOME libraries, actually.
2011-11-23T23:19:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Correct, well, a few notable ones are: GNOME, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, Openbox, E17 and, well, Unity.
2011-11-23T23:19:00.000Z	Shwaiil	theadmin	so, its not a Desktop-environment. So, couldnt we download Ubuntu without it ? by default ?
2011-11-23T23:20:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	Gnome2 and gnome3 are completely different, but XFCE is like gnome2.
2011-11-23T23:21:00.000Z	theadmin	Shwaiil	No, Unity is
