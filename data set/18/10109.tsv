2007-01-13T13:33:00.000Z	pollywog		I installed kubuntu Edgy two days ago on a laptop and I have noticed that if I do not login within a few minutes of starting the machine, the screen goes blank and I can't login except remotely
2007-01-13T13:33:00.000Z	pollywog		could the problem be kdm?
2007-01-13T13:34:00.000Z	pollywog		no, if that were true we would not be here
2007-01-13T13:34:00.000Z	pollywog		and you are implying that howtos are completely up to date
2007-01-13T13:35:00.000Z	pollywog		I have tried to find info on how to fix my problem with rt2500 on my own
2007-01-13T13:35:00.000Z	pollywog		to no avail
2007-01-13T13:36:00.000Z	pollywog		I might be plain DUMB but I am not lazy
2007-01-13T13:37:00.000Z	pollywog		but most people won't help those who can just as easily help themselves
2007-01-13T13:39:00.000Z	pollywog		I have found that qtparted, though quite good, is not as good as PartitionMagic
2007-01-13T13:39:00.000Z	pollywog		but maybe that's just me
2007-01-13T13:39:00.000Z	michael117	pollywog	Why is it not as good as PartitionMagic?
2007-01-13T13:40:00.000Z	pollywog	michael117	I could not move partitions with it and last month I just had to reinstall everything except for the XP partition
2007-01-13T13:40:00.000Z	pollywog		I tried that first
2007-01-13T13:40:00.000Z	pollywog		same thing
2007-01-13T13:40:00.000Z	pollywog		same result
2007-01-13T13:41:00.000Z	pollywog		maybe I am just dumb though
2007-01-13T13:41:00.000Z	pollywog		but the reinstall went well
2007-01-13T13:41:00.000Z	michael117	pollywog	By moving partitions do you mean resizing or what exactly?
