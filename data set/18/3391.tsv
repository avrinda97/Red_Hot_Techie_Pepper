2009-12-14T04:18:00.000Z	c3l		why should mpd be run as a separate user? (mpd) why not as my selfe?
2009-12-14T04:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	i run it as my normal user, works fine
2009-12-14T04:20:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	oh thanks. it should be alot smoother with permissions etc..
2010-10-06T12:18:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	because of the license
2010-10-06T12:18:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	depends on who you ask
2010-10-06T12:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	the source code is available but it has a custom license
2010-10-06T12:19:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	still tryecrypt is the recommended software by the community?
2010-10-06T12:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	i like cryptsetup+LUKS for OS encryption and truecrypt for other stuff
2010-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	hm I see. what the best way to encrypt my entire system? would it be best to do that at install, I have no problem with reinstalling, will do that in a couple of days when 10.10 goes stable anyways
2010-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	to encrypt your os, yeah you need a reinstall and i'd use cryptsetup+LUKS for that
2010-10-06T12:22:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	also, I have loads of external drives too. those are easy to encrypt with truecrypt, and then when plugging them in, you will need to enter the passphrase? what about internal extra harddrives. how should I encrypt those the best way?
2010-10-06T12:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	for the externals i use truecrypt, you plug them in and open truecrypt and enter the pass/key
2010-10-06T12:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	it's really up to you which one you want to use
2010-10-06T12:23:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	ok, thanks. could you point me to some guide or similar on how that process is done? im new to encryptions efc.
2010-10-06T12:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	well you plug the drive in, open truecrypt, select the drive, mount it, it asks for the password and/or keyfile and that's it
2010-10-06T12:24:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	yeah, thats hopefully not that troublesome, I was thinking more about encrypting the full system
2010-10-25T23:50:00.000Z	blakkheim	c3l	killall -9 firefox-bin; mv .mozilla .mozillabackup; firefox
2010-10-25T23:50:00.000Z	c3l	blakkheim	thanks, ill try it
