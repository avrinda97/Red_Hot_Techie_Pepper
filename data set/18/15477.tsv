2006-05-16T07:09:00.000Z	captine		it really concerns me that my notebook fan never seems to come on when in ubuntu.  only when i reboot to windows.  weird
2006-05-16T07:09:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	why?
2006-05-16T07:10:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	if the notebook doesnt get hot, there should be no problem
2006-05-16T07:10:00.000Z	captine	gfxstyler	the thing is, when i reboot, the fan comes on, and the air behing pushed out is really hot
2006-05-16T07:10:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	just feel if the notebook is really hot, if so, that could be bad
2006-05-16T07:11:00.000Z	captine	gfxstyler	and it stays on for a long time.  am looking for lmsensors info now
2006-05-16T07:13:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	whats your notebook cpu?
2006-05-16T07:13:00.000Z	captine	gfxstyler	turion
2006-05-16T07:13:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	thats amd 64 right?
2006-05-16T07:13:00.000Z	captine	gfxstyler	yeh
2006-05-16T07:14:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	well if the notebook itself doesnt get hot it should be no problem or do i misunderstand anything?
2006-05-16T07:14:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	also, when it gets too hot, it should shutdown automatically
2006-05-16T07:14:00.000Z	captine	gfxstyler	I'm just concerned that as soon as i reboot, the fan will come on for an extended period of time
2006-05-16T07:15:00.000Z	captine	gfxstyler	also, i sat at grub screen for 5 minutes, waiting for the air comin from the notebook to cool down
2006-05-16T07:23:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	i just noticed the fan beeing more quiet since i used dapper and my hard-disk doesnt get so hot anymore too (and the battery lasts longer)
2006-05-16T07:27:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	dapper works without a flaw here
2006-05-16T07:28:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	better download the cd or even better... wait
2006-05-16T07:29:00.000Z	gfxstyler	captine	you would have to download around 600-whatever mb anyway so you can also just download the iso image (so you can re-use it)
