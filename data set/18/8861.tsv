2007-10-19T16:47:00.000Z	SleepingSloth		hi - just moved to 7.10 on an opteron box, and one of my processors has disappeared - is this going to be just a case of using the wrong kernel?
2007-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	What kernel are you using?
2007-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	uname -r
2007-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	2.6.22-14-386
2007-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	Change it to -generic or -server (if thats what you were using before)
2007-10-19T16:49:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	 what - by chaging grub.conf and reboting?
2007-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	no, remove linux-i386 and install linux-generic
2007-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	*don't* reboot between
2007-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	or just install -generic if you want to play it safe
2007-10-19T16:51:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	can i apt-get that?
2007-10-19T16:51:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	yessir, those are the names of the packages.
2007-10-19T16:51:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	 ta
2007-10-19T16:52:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	 i already seem to have linux-generic - so is it just a case of booting to that kernel?
2007-10-19T16:53:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	Looks like it, If that doesnt work, remove it and re-install it
2007-10-26T16:58:00.000Z	Pici	SleepingSloth	pdfcrack, its in the repos, never used it myself.
2007-10-26T16:59:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	thanks - i'm trying it now...
2007-10-26T16:59:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Pici	guess you live and learn...
