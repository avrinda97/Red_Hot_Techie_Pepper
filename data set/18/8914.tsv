2009-06-30T08:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	you don't do the ISO with Wubi, also Wuib = bad
2009-06-30T08:30:00.000Z	Caleb_	sebsebseb	said its bad
2009-06-30T08:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	runs inside Windows,   if  the  drive isn't fragmented,  can get all slow,  if Windows get virus that deleted it, bye bye Wubi/Ubuntu  as well, and so on
2009-06-30T08:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	real partitions is the best :)
2009-06-30T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	yes I meant the other way round
2009-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	Wubi is for  newbies, that don't know better
2009-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	simple delete it on the Live CD in gparted
2009-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Caleb_	I have used Linux  before Ubuntu even existed,  since 2004
