2009-06-30T19:49:00.000Z	Torgoton		Hey all, I've just installed xubuntu 8.10 on an old laptop, and the GUI is... unuseful. Consoles work fine though.
2009-06-30T19:49:00.000Z	Torgoton		Any tips or pointers?
2009-06-30T19:50:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	try Xubuntu instead
2009-06-30T19:51:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	Are you picking on my lack of capitalization, or did you miss that I did install Xubuntu, or are you suggesting another IRC channel?
2009-06-30T19:52:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	sorry, thought you said Ubuntu
2009-06-30T19:53:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	Thanks. I think it's a driver/xorg issue because I can't even see the login prompt, so XFCE hasn't even started.
2009-06-30T19:54:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	oh, then yeah, probably bad drivers
2009-06-30T19:55:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	Oh! This is after I force the vesa driver. The standard driver just gives me a full-on white screen... like stress-the-LCD kind of white.
2009-06-30T19:55:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	what video card does it have?
2009-06-30T19:56:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	It's a ThinkPad 560E with a... Trident Cyber9660.
2009-06-30T19:58:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	that's an S3 card?
2009-06-30T19:59:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	No, it's a Trident. There seem to be a lot of issues with many of those chips in Linux.
2009-06-30T20:00:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	yeah, you may be in for a fight on that one
2009-06-30T20:00:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	have you tried using kernel framebuffer?
2009-06-30T20:00:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	So, I had read that vesa works, but no such luck for me. Haven't tried fb. Got a URL for that handy?
2009-06-30T20:01:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	nope, but if you dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it should ask if you want to use it or not
2009-06-30T20:02:00.000Z	mhall119	Torgoton	I think the  xorg.conf option is "UseFBDev"
2009-06-30T20:02:00.000Z	Torgoton	mhall119	Thanks. Trying. (And the Xorg log file is verbose. oeyh)
