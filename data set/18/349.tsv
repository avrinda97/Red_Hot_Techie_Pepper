2012-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		It doesn't say
2012-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		Burning the iso to a DVD. I'm not aware of any distinction between a CD and a DVD iso
2012-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		Yes, ActionParsnip
2012-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		And these DVDs should be fine; I've burned other stuff on them with success in the past
2012-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	scarykitties		I'm not sure if my DVDs are always getting screwed up while burning, if this is some kind of Ubuntu bug (GOogle gets a few hits about this "bug", but with older versions, like 8 and 9), if my DVD-Drive on the computer is screwing things up somehow, or if my HDD is bad.
2012-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	scarykitties		Where can I get that, Action?
2012-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	scarykitties		Since when has different ISOs been required for CDs vs DVDs?
2012-04-05T21:06:00.000Z	scarykitties		Thanks, AP. But why should it not work on a DVD?
2012-04-05T21:06:00.000Z	scarykitties		An ISO is an ISO, isn't it?
2012-04-05T21:06:00.000Z	scarykitties		Also, have that in torrent, perchance?
2012-04-05T21:06:00.000Z	eye-gor	scarykitties	the dvd iso is a lot bigger and contains more stuff
2012-04-05T21:08:00.000Z	eye-gor	scarykitties	if the md5sum checks out then it's a bad burn. I used to use cdrw's before I switched ti usb stick
2012-04-05T21:09:00.000Z	eye-gor	scarykitties	is it a 32 bit machine or 64 bit
2012-04-05T21:10:00.000Z	eye-gor	scarykitties	then get the 64 bit edition. from 12.04 it will be the recommended version
