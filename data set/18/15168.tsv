2005-04-26T15:38:00.000Z	airhead		if I leave my hoary laptop for a cpl hours, will ubuntu try and put it into hibernate mode?
2005-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	airhead		does ubuntu try to use hibernate mode after a couple of hours?
2005-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	airhead		if the machine is unused
2005-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	airhead		cause my laptop keeps cutting out during the night
2005-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	airhead		battery is at 100%
2005-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	airhead		ac plugged in
2005-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	airhead		was working fine before ubuntu
2005-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	airhead		if I try hibernate mode from the log out screen in gnome, I just get a screensaver
2005-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	airhead		so perhaps thats not the problem
2005-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	airhead		dell 5150
2005-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	delire	airhead	though mostly resolved.
2005-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	airhead	delire	hmm.. interesting. what problems were you having?
2005-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	delire	airhead	/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state was being misreported. i needed to patch acpi support in the kernel to fix it.
2005-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	airhead	delire	I see. was your machine randomly powering off too?
2005-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	delire	airhead	hehe no..
2005-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	airhead	delire	I also did have a problem the other day where state said there was no battery present O_o
2005-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	delire	airhead	if i were you i'd grep the debian-laptop-list for clues. nearly every issue ever encountered is therein
2005-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	airhead	delire	cheers
