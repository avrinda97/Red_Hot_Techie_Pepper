2007-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	mvanbaak		heya all
2007-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	mvanbaak		I was wondering if Ubuntu also has a testing version
2007-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	mvanbaak		I'm running 7.10 now, but want the newer version :)
2007-12-13T22:59:00.000Z	mvanbaak		to see if it no longer freezes my lenovo T61p when doing massive transfers over my wireless interface
2007-12-13T22:59:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	what wireless card?
2007-12-13T22:59:00.000Z	mvanbaak	pestilence	intel 3945
2007-12-13T22:59:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	what driver are you using?
2007-12-13T23:00:00.000Z	mvanbaak	pestilence	ipw3945
2007-12-13T23:00:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	you should try iwl3945, it works much better for me on my dell vostro
2007-12-13T23:00:00.000Z	mvanbaak	pestilence	how ? ;)
2007-12-13T23:00:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	the ipw3945 driver would stop working for me during large transfers too.  not so with the iwl driver
2007-12-13T23:01:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	i think there are two key steps
2007-12-13T23:01:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	put iwlwifi_mac80211  and iwl3945  in /etc/modules
2007-12-13T23:01:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	then put "blacklist ipw3945" in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-12-13T23:02:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	reboot, then you should have the iwl driver loaded (check with lsmod)
2007-12-13T23:03:00.000Z	mvanbaak	pestilence	thanks
2007-12-13T23:10:00.000Z	mvanbaak	pestilence	let's see how this works out :)
2007-12-13T23:12:00.000Z	pestilence	mvanbaak	that was painless, i guess
