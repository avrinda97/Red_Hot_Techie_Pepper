2010-01-31T21:28:00.000Z	xfact		I am using Ubuntu Karmic with latest flash 10 and only the flock browser is not detecting the flash plug in, apparently it's asking for installation of flash from adobe's website, one new thing I've found the plug in is not in the 'plug in' list of flock, How to active flash plug in? (in Flock)
2010-01-31T21:30:00.000Z	xfact		Quan-time: yes, I have already placed one question on Flock help community, and now  I am going to put another one in Adobe's site...cause I think everything should 'fairly' support Ubuntu/linux!!
2010-01-31T21:31:00.000Z	xfact		Actually I have another critical question
2010-01-31T21:32:00.000Z	xfact		I have one server running on my IP, but I don't host any servers (don't want to..), so how to kill that unknown server, which is currently insecure I believe...
2010-01-31T21:33:00.000Z	xfact		somebody told me about 'sudo killall apache/apache2' but it's nothing spacial for me :(

2010-01-31T21:34:00.000Z	albech	xfact	try /etc/init.d/apache stop
2010-01-31T21:37:00.000Z	albech	xfact	does netstat -l show apache?
2010-01-31T21:38:00.000Z	xfact	albech	no there are no 'apache' word in the little list
2010-01-31T21:38:00.000Z	albech	xfact	so why do you think you have an apache server running?
2010-01-31T21:38:00.000Z	xfact	albech	no apache
2010-01-31T21:40:00.000Z	xfact	albech	actually in ##teenlinux one guy just told me that my IP has one server (and it's right, I checked), and he told me that your apache server is running, and gave me the command
2010-01-31T21:40:00.000Z	albech	xfact	unless you have actually installed apache it wont be on your box as default
2010-01-31T21:41:00.000Z	albech	xfact	could be anything answering.. GUI on your router or similar
2010-01-31T21:41:00.000Z	albech	xfact	doesnt have to be your ubuntu
2010-01-31T21:42:00.000Z	albech	xfact	well we have established that there is no web server running on your ubuntu, so you should look elsewhere.. my guess is your router
2010-01-31T21:45:00.000Z	albech	xfact	i do in fact see what appears to be an apache answering on your ip: 117.194.3.130
2010-01-31T21:45:00.000Z	albech	xfact	and you only have one box?
