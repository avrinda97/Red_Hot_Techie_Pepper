2006-01-14T15:39:00.000Z	boxy	errr	you can add it to a file one sec
2006-01-14T15:41:00.000Z	boxy	errr	echo nvidia >> /etc/modules
2006-01-14T15:44:00.000Z	errr	boxy	it was already there. I rebooted to make sure it would work fine, I guess I should have known this part would have been the same as gentoo but I figured that when I did the reinstalls of the driver it would modprobe for me.. lesson learned, and thanks for the help
