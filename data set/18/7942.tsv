2007-10-22T23:16:00.000Z	Tesium		!emerald-themes
2007-10-22T23:18:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	did you try the svn import from the emerald theme manager? that worked for me
2007-10-22T23:18:00.000Z	Tesium	chorne	yes... both fetch options don't work...
2007-10-22T23:19:00.000Z	chorne		just had to follow the instructions at the bottom of the window to get the non-free ones
2007-10-22T23:19:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	did you grab the keys following the instructions at the bottom of the window?
2007-10-22T23:20:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	that did it for me, the non-free import snagged me 15 themes or so
2007-10-22T23:20:00.000Z	Tesium	chorne	 tried... one key only... but the svn command doesn't work for me... installed some svn packages... still nothing...
2007-10-22T23:20:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	then I have no idea, sorry...worked here
2007-10-22T23:21:00.000Z	Tesium	chorne	thanks... could you look though what svn program you were using? :D
2007-10-22T23:22:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	I just apt-get installed svn
2007-10-22T23:23:00.000Z	Tesium	chorne	thanks
2007-10-22T23:23:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	iirc apt-get install subversion did the trick
2007-10-22T23:26:00.000Z	Tesium	chorne	said can't find package svn :|... what repositories have you installed? standard? should i work there smth?
2007-10-22T23:26:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	I just have the default repos enabled
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	chorne	Tesium	I think the package is called subversion though, not svn?
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	chorne		on windows right now, so I can't check
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	Tesium	chorne	lol... that might be it... :D
