2007-05-28T16:17:00.000Z	inflex		After 12 years+ of Slackware... I've converted to Ubuntu
2007-05-28T16:17:00.000Z	inflex		Is there a confessional around here somewhere?
2007-05-28T16:17:00.000Z	inflex		:-(
2007-05-28T16:18:00.000Z	inflex		but my personal HDD crapped out on my yesterday... and I switched over to Ubuntu 7.04
2007-05-28T16:18:00.000Z	inflex		oh, one trouble.... my Radeon 9250 still won't work in 'high speed'
2007-05-28T16:18:00.000Z	inflex		so I'm getting rather lousy refresh
2007-05-28T16:19:00.000Z	inflex		This is what  have in xorg.conf atm        Identifier  "ATI Technologies Inc RV280 [Radeon 9200 PRO] "
2007-05-28T16:19:00.000Z	inflex		        Driver      "ati"
2007-05-28T16:19:00.000Z	inflex		I tried installing flglx but it complained about not finding any suitable screens
2007-05-28T16:20:00.000Z	inflex		(I run at 1920x1200 on a Dell 2407)
2007-05-28T16:20:00.000Z	aLeSD	inflex	not use that driver please
2007-05-28T16:20:00.000Z	inflex	aLeSD	what should I be using ?
2007-05-28T16:21:00.000Z	aLeSD	inflex	it's too early ... maybe amd will develop something that will work .. for now the driver works bad and very slow ...
2007-05-28T16:21:00.000Z	inflex	aLeSD	damn, what I don't get though is that on Slackware it worked faster
2007-05-28T16:21:00.000Z	inflex	aLeSD	though I -have- noticed I don't seem to have /prod/dri
2007-05-28T16:22:00.000Z	aLeSD	inflex	3d is too instable for now ... active it only when you have to show to a win user where linux is going  ;)
2007-05-28T16:22:00.000Z	inflex	aLeSD	well, I don't use 3D personally
2007-05-28T16:23:00.000Z	aLeSD	inflex	really ati proprietary driver gives more problems that other stuff
