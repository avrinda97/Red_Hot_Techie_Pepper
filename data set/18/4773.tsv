2009-04-27T05:07:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	I only know how to do minutes
2009-04-27T05:07:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	oh, once every minute is fine
2009-04-27T04:58:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	define "not work"
2009-04-27T04:58:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	edited crontab through the crontab command?
2009-04-27T04:58:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	Don't know how else to put it?
2009-04-27T04:59:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	yes
2009-04-27T04:59:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	cron is running? Tried with a completely trivial command (something like "touch /tmp/itworks")?
2009-04-27T04:59:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	(specifically running gui (X) apps through cron generally doesn't work)
2009-04-27T05:00:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	Command was tested.  Just wanted it to play music file for wake up call.
2009-04-27T05:07:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	sorry, haven't touched crontab in ages
2009-04-27T05:00:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	what do you mean with "Command was tested"?
2009-04-27T05:03:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	so does (temporarily) adding a rule to crontab to run "touch /tmp/itworks" every 5 seconds work?
2009-04-27T05:07:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	how do you do seconds?
2009-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	touch ~/itworks does not work either.
2009-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	Its' been over a minute
2009-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	mzz	usr13	anything logged to /var/log/ ?
2009-04-27T05:12:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	nothing in /var/log/messages that looks like it pertains.
2009-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	usr13	mzz	Ok there really is something wrong with crontab.  Not doing it's job.
