2010-07-04T04:15:00.000Z	pondera		yes because right now i have a macbook gen 3.1, with osx, ubuntu, and win7 and it seems that every time i try to install backtrack it messes up the grub

2010-07-04T04:17:00.000Z	pondera		compiling could you help with why that would happen
2010-07-04T04:18:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	there should be an option not to install a bootloader
2010-07-04T04:18:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	try that then manually add an entry in menu.lst or grub.cfg (whatever you're using)
2010-07-04T04:19:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	which installation did you install grub with?
2010-07-04T04:19:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	that one will have the file
2010-07-04T04:22:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	you referenced GRUB earlier. when you get to your GRUB screen, which options do you have? I'm assuming you're only getting grub once you select ubuntu
2010-07-04T04:23:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	did you install ubuntu from within windows?
2010-07-04T04:23:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	then you shouldn't get grub when you select windows O_o
2010-07-04T04:26:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	try reconfiguring GRUB
2010-07-04T04:29:00.000Z	Compiling	pondera	I have to go but check this out
