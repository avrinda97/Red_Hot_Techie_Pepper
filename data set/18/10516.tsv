2006-11-27T13:13:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		has anyone here ever edited the xorg.conf file to allow connection to external output?
2006-11-27T13:14:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	ask on #ltsp
2006-11-27T13:15:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		EdinNY: I'm not quite sure what you mean?
2006-11-27T13:15:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		by #ltsp

2006-11-27T13:16:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	I assume you want to view an X application run locally on a remote machine
2006-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		EdinNY: errmm. What I want to do is connect my TV to my laptop to view films etc etc
2006-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	EDinNY	have you ever done this?
2006-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	do you have a card with a television output?
2006-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	EDinNY	I was hoping to use the VGA slot ??
2006-11-27T13:18:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	you need a vid card in that slot that supports TV out
2006-11-27T13:19:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	EDinNY	VGA slot works on (dare I mention it) Windblows so it should also work on Ubuntu ???
2006-11-27T13:19:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	you need a video card that has televsion out

2006-11-27T13:20:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	and it does not work?
2006-11-27T13:21:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	 then I can't help you
2006-11-27T13:21:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	EDinNY	no not straight off, so I assumed that there was a bit of tweaking required??
2006-11-27T13:21:00.000Z	EDinNY	TurtleBoots	you need drivers that support it...I don't know if there are linux drivers that do...google your card model and linux
