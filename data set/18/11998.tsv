2007-02-14T06:28:00.000Z	deville75	dyrne	what are they? I have 1GB of ram, but if you know better programs please tell
2007-02-14T06:30:00.000Z	dyrne	deville75	well ive heard good things about ctorrent. i use rtorrent but thats a terminal app.. deluge is something ive been keeping an eye on but havent tried yet
2007-02-14T06:31:00.000Z	dyrne	deville75	if youre on kde id just use ktorrent but in gnome..
2007-02-14T06:31:00.000Z	deville75	dyrne	i c.. hmm I'll check those out, but until then I have a shell script of Azureus, how do I run it? I'm sorry if this is really noob question
