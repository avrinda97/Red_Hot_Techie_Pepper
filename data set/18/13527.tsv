2005-11-09T07:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	don't you have do edit the cron file?
2005-11-09T07:14:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	no, it's not run by cron, but by anacron
2005-11-09T07:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	ah, thx
2005-11-09T07:15:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	otherwise if you never had the PC switched on at 7:30 am it would never run
2005-11-09T07:16:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	look at /etc/anacrontab to see how it gets run daily / weekly
2005-11-09T07:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	yar, snooping now
2005-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	it is a lot faster, particularly the forward/back operation
2005-12-14T17:33:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	that would create a whole bunch of files over NFS.  have you ever had that work properly?
2005-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	your point is that tar needs the -l flag as well, to stay within the / fs ?
2005-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	no, my point is that I wouldn't trust NFS to create a whole bunch of files at once.  I've had bad experiences with it.
2005-12-14T17:37:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	I'd dump the tarfile over NFS and then run tar xf on the remote machine to untar it
2005-12-14T17:37:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	that sounds horrible - I used to do this all the time - NFS should be VERY stable
2005-12-14T17:37:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	but an 'l' flag when creating the tarfile is needed too.  (and the last - must be inside the subshell if you're going to do it like that too by the way)
2005-12-14T17:38:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	yup
2005-12-14T17:38:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	maybe it is now.  i've not used it for 10 years or so.  Sun's implementation used to be horrible.
2005-12-14T17:40:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooglus	NFS these days is really nice - on Sun's cluster - you take down an NFS server, failover, and all your exports keep working - even with open files - it's pretty awesome
2005-12-19T17:43:00.000Z	dooglus	frogzoo	win4lin is very good if all you need is windows 98.  the win4lin pro thing sucks
