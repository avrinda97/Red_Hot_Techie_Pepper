2006-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	mwe	ig-shoot-me	you have to find out where it's located
2006-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	ig-shoot-me		??
2006-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	mwe	ig-shoot-me	you don't understand how to use wine.
2006-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	ig-shoot-me	mwe	I said that already :)
2006-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	mwe	ig-shoot-me	you download a .exe like setup.exe. then run wine whatever.exe
2006-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	ig-shoot-me		ah
2006-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	ig-shoot-me		ok lets try that
2006-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	mwe	ig-shoot-me	don't expect the program to work unless it's listed as working in the wine database though
