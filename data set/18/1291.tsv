2011-05-03T17:14:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		I find that in 10.04 I have the su command and none of my passwords work with it.  1) Is su officially supported now?  2)  Why don't my passwords work?
2011-05-03T17:14:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	 try with sudo not su
2011-05-03T17:15:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	yes I know but my questions still stand
2011-05-03T17:23:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	I made fresh install of natty and pae was installed by default
2011-05-03T17:23:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	next question : does your uname -a output include the letters pae?
2011-05-03T17:24:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	I installed 10.04 on my puter with 4 Gig RAM and I don't have the PAE thing installed.  I'm not sure whose fault that is
2011-05-03T17:24:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	 I'm not on Ubuntu comp right noe but yes when I boot only options are with pae kernel
2011-05-03T17:25:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	 we discus thing witch can be solved in min time why
2011-05-03T17:26:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	well at least I can download the PAE kernel.  31 megs, here we go
2011-05-03T17:27:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	and after installing remove one witch is not pae
2011-05-03T17:27:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	rebooting now, hang on
2011-05-03T17:29:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	 drivers doesn't work with kernel of course install drivers again
2011-05-03T17:29:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	does that mean I have to do remove and install?
2011-05-03T17:30:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	I will not answer graphic related questions because I know very little about that
2011-05-10T15:06:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	not sure but probably factory partition
2011-05-10T15:07:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	leave that partition and install Windows first then Ubuntu
2011-05-10T15:08:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	zvacet	Well I had Windows installed then I repartitioned for Ubuntu
2011-05-10T15:09:00.000Z	zvacet	thegoodcushion	if you are done with shrinking windows then install Ubunu sorry for misunderstanding
