2007-06-08T13:12:00.000Z	b0llan2		Hi #ubuntu, I need to burn ~60 GB data to dvd:s, what's a good way to compress and package it to 4 GB files before burning it?
2007-06-08T13:14:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	you can use split. It's pretty simple. It just splits the file.
2007-06-08T13:14:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	or, if the 60G of data is many multiple files, you should look up dar. I like dar.
2007-06-08T13:14:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	unfortunately I'll need to unsplit it on a windows xp computer
2007-06-08T13:15:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	if the XP computer has cygwin, that would be easy. Also, if you use dar, there's a windows version.
2007-06-08T13:16:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	wish there was cygwin ..  by dar, do you mean rar?
2007-06-08T13:16:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	What kind of data is this 60GB, one big file? many big files? many many small files?
2007-06-08T13:16:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	it's a directory structure with mp3s, pictures etc
2007-06-08T13:16:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	I'd suggest dar. And I do not mean RAR. I mean dar.
2007-06-08T13:16:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	apt-get install dar
2007-06-08T13:17:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	Uh...sudo that.
2007-06-08T13:17:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	ok I'll look up dar, thanks for the suggestion
2007-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	dar has compression (gzip and bzip2) and can be instructed to make slices of any size. You could back up 60G on 60,000 flopies if you wanted to.
2007-06-08T13:19:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	seems like a standard feature but for some reason I couldn't get arj and rar to make files as big as 4 GB, but now dar is installed :)
2007-06-08T13:19:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	the only problem I had was burning 2+G files
2007-06-08T13:19:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	b0llan2	so I made 1G slices, and burned 4 to a disk, along with some par2 data.
2007-06-08T13:20:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	oops ok, maybe I'll go for many smaller files then
2007-06-08T13:20:00.000Z	b0llan2	kitsuneofdoom	ok :)
