2005-12-27T08:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	there's a module you have to load to make rosegarden work.  I forget which one, lemme look it up
2005-12-27T08:47:00.000Z	christianp	tiglionabbit	but i can't play midifiles, with no player!!!
2005-12-27T08:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	rosegarden doesn't play them?
2005-12-27T08:48:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	um, lets see..   there's something called playmidi I believe
2005-12-27T08:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	mplayer plays them
2005-12-27T08:50:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	do you remember the module it needed?
2005-12-27T08:51:00.000Z	christianp	tiglionabbit	it says "rosegarden sequencer can't initialize module" (or something like this, sorry is an italian message and i try to translate it)
2005-12-27T08:51:00.000Z	christianp	tiglionabbit	but other player can't play it
2005-12-27T08:52:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	oh.  What you need to do to fix rosegarden is say "sudo modprobe snd-seq".  Lemme figure out where to put that so it runs at startup
2005-12-27T08:55:00.000Z	christianp	tiglionabbit	i add it with modconf
2005-12-27T08:55:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	that's right.  or modules.autoload
2005-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	christianp	tiglionabbit	but i can't understand why i hear nothing
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	dunno..   not working for me either
2005-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	christianp	your best bet is searching http://ubuntuforums.org for answers.  That's what I'm doing
