2010-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nou7: sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-pae ,should install it afaik
2010-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brijith: what is output if you run it in terminal. Use pastebin for multiple lines
2010-02-19T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brijith: you can always use terminal to kill off nautilus (will lose desktop icons) then rerun (icons will reappear). Then try the file browser again
2010-02-19T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Dasei: gaudi was a crazy guy!
2010-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Dasei: also.a spanish artist who put mosaics on everything
2010-02-19T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brijith: id try the kill the processes. You may have to rename or delete the nautilus config folder(s) to get default settings if the poweroff has damaged them
2010-02-19T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Daedaluz: I do it in xorg.conf to specify timeouts etc. You could try the advanced tab under screensaver to kill the screenoff
2010-02-19T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Daedaluz: why not use gnome-mplayer ,smplayer uses qt libs so will bloat your install (unless you have other kde apps installed)
2010-02-19T22:43:00.000Z	daedaluz	ActionParsnip	no good reason, will try that out. i'm just used to smplayer. I disabled display sleeping from power saving now.
2010-02-19T22:45:00.000Z	daedaluz	ActionParsnip	that's irrelevant.
2010-02-19T22:49:00.000Z	daedaluz	ActionParsnip	because I was wondering if it's doable it's relevant. what really pissess me off is guys like you. good day.
2011-04-23T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daedaluz	there is no single best app for ANYTHING
2011-04-23T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daedaluz	free -m     is pretty good
2011-04-23T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daedaluz	oh you want just gnome ones?
2011-05-22T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daedaluz	sudo lshw -C drive; sudo lshw -C disk
2011-05-22T21:12:00.000Z	daedaluz	ActionParsnip	thanks!
