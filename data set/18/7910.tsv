2008-02-04T06:17:00.000Z	DanThirst		i'll look at it again thanks
2008-02-04T06:17:00.000Z	gilda	DanThirst	you will have to mount ur samba drives via the fstab to ur local machine then use the mount points as the folders within amarok
2008-02-04T06:17:00.000Z	DanThirst		AHHHH fstab
2008-02-04T06:17:00.000Z	DanThirst		i dun like fstab
2008-02-04T06:18:00.000Z	gilda		aye but for amarok to play nice theyll have to be mounted via that
2008-02-04T06:18:00.000Z	DanThirst	gilda	yeah thats what im asking how to do
2008-02-04T06:19:00.000Z	DanThirst		i don't know how to use fstab, also would like to learn because i'v got a second 20 gig hd just rotting in this case because i have no idea how to acesses it
2008-02-04T06:19:00.000Z	gilda	DanThirst	1st off youll have to discover the samba share      smbclient -L ipAddress
2008-02-04T06:19:00.000Z	DanThirst		one thing at a time i'll deal with the 2nd hd later

2008-02-04T06:21:00.000Z	DanThirst		wow way to much at once k got the ip of the samba computer
2008-02-04T06:21:00.000Z	gilda	DanThirst	 so you got the ip of the samba computer yes ?
2008-02-04T06:21:00.000Z	DanThirst		correct
