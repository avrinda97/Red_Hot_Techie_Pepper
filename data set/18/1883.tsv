2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	Gskellig		i dunno... i'm on wubi right now
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	Gskellig		ill do a real dual boot when I have time in a couple weeks
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	Gskellig		i don't recommend it
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	Gskellig		do a real dual boot, its not that much more work
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	Gskellig		for when ubuntu breaks and I have homework due the next day =P
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	Gskellig		and for troubleshooting at my job
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	wubi is just asking to brick both OS's.. i would not use it either
2011-05-09T09:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	it's not about using it again, its' about getting it removed.. that's a huge PITA>
2011-05-14T09:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	only "ghost" tool im' aware of, is like clonezilla
2011-05-14T09:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	you can also keep your /home on a separate partition, which is where all the configuration stuff is stored
2011-05-14T09:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	well why do you need to patch the kernel?
2011-05-14T09:51:00.000Z	Gskellig	KM0201	how do you keep /home separate?
2011-05-14T09:51:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	well, its a little more complex if you're already installed
2011-06-03T07:17:00.000Z	KM0201	Gskellig	thats good news... now you can see the suck that is unity.. :)
