2007-06-24T05:00:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	by cool'n quiet, do you mean frequency scaling?

2007-06-24T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	check by running 'top' in the terminal.
2007-06-24T05:03:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	what about top output?
2007-06-24T05:04:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	no, the boot options aren't causing your problem.

2007-06-24T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	sorry...
2007-06-24T05:49:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	can you tell me the make and model of your laptop? Just so I know what to avoid ;)
2007-06-24T05:50:00.000Z	soundray	evri2	you might look up installation reports on http://tuxmobil.org/mylaptops.html
2007-06-24T05:52:00.000Z	evri2	soundray	Btw i cannot run the chess program in 3d format which came with default installation.It says install OpenGL python bindings and the GtkGLExT Python bindings.I think these are packages that i need to install.Because i have nvidia's driver from repositories.
