2008-11-03T01:01:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	dont upgrade. lots of problems
2008-11-03T01:02:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	is there any point on wich i can see when the upgrade is safe?
2008-11-03T01:02:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	no idea.
2008-11-03T01:02:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	bad thing. couldnt it be possible to downgrade the x server to the version used in 8.04?
2008-11-03T01:03:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	i wish. my system is screwed up now and no downgrade possible
2008-11-03T01:04:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	bad thing. dont the nv drivers work at least without 3d acc?
2008-11-03T01:05:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	i got nvidia deivers working but lots of othee problems like no networking, many others have them too
2008-11-03T01:05:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	 how did you make the nvidia drivers working?
2008-11-03T01:06:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	just reinstalled all nvidia stuff i guess
2008-11-03T01:06:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	did you update or reinstall the system? i have another hdd lying arojund here and thinking about just trying it
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	upgraded.
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	so, on your system, the nvidia drivers work with 3d acc?
2008-11-03T01:08:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	no idea. but i do have twinview working and nvidia logo shows up during x startup
2008-11-03T01:08:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	could you type "glxgears"? if it looks good, 3d acc is fine
2008-11-03T01:09:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	type glxinfo instead please
2008-11-03T01:10:00.000Z	kke	damaltor	it probably works since compiz shows effects. im booting currently
2008-11-03T01:10:00.000Z	damaltor	kke	ok thank you. ill put that other hdd in and have a try.
