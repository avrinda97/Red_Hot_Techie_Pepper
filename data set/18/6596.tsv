2008-04-27T04:23:00.000Z	pr4bh		guys is there any way i can install windows from just the iso (my cd drive wont work) from within ubuntu? maybe getting grub to load the iso somehow? any help would be appreciated..
2008-04-27T04:24:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	yeah, most virtualization programs let you mount an iso as a drive
2008-04-27T04:24:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	yes, i tried but the setup.exe wouldnt complete using wine
2008-04-27T04:25:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	what i'm suggesting is that you run winodws in a virtual environment like vmware or virtualbox
2008-04-27T04:26:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	hmm, but i cant actually INSTALL windows that way can i?
2008-04-27T04:27:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	yup, you definitely can!  http://www.blog.arun-prabha.com/2007/05/07/installing-virtualbox-and-windows-using-virtualbox-in-ubuntu/
2008-04-27T04:27:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	oh cheers!!
2008-04-27T04:29:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	just one more question (sorry for being such an ass btw): using virtualbox, would i be able to dualboot into windows as well via grub menu?
2008-04-27T04:30:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	nope, you'd have to run ubuntu first, then open up virtualbox, and run windows from within it.
2008-04-27T04:30:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	there are ways around that, but it's complicated :)
2008-04-27T04:31:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	if you can point me to any good links, id appreciate?
2008-04-27T04:32:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	well, the trick for you would be getting windows installed without a dvd drive.  that's not really an ubuntu problem; it's just a general "installing windows" problem.  is there no way you could just borrow an external DVD drive or something?
2008-04-27T04:33:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	not where i am at mate :( i read somewhere about grub loading the extracted isos? is that the right direction?
2008-04-27T04:33:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	i've looked into that; i really don't think it's possible :(
2008-04-27T04:33:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	ah ok :( stuck with ubuntu then! :s
2008-04-27T04:34:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	ah well, not so bad :)
2008-04-27T04:34:00.000Z	pr4bh	androver	ive been using it for past 3 years, i want some change, for better or worse i dont care lol
2008-04-27T04:36:00.000Z	androver	pr4bh	no prob good luck :)
