2008-03-24T09:36:00.000Z	dabbill		Any one useing an 8800 video card? if so what drivers are you useing? I cant seem to get any type of performace out of my 8800GT.
2008-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 using an 8800 here - using the restricted-manager drivers worked fine for me.
2008-03-24T09:38:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	it wouldnt detect my card
2008-03-24T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 and thats my fault? :)
2008-03-24T09:38:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	no lol, was just sayin :(
2008-03-24T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 a lot of that depends on the apps running also. I see similer effect, and even under windows it seems i rarely max out both.
2008-03-24T12:37:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	what version of windows you running?
2008-03-24T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 Beasta  err Vista:)
2008-03-24T12:39:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	thats weird, i always see my vista install maxing out both cores or balancing the load between the cores in vista.
2008-03-24T12:39:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	like see them both running at 60%.
2008-03-24T12:43:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	there are no settings or any thing in Ubuntu to check for dual core CPU's?
2008-03-24T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 if the kernel fines them it will use them. IF you are using the 386 kernel - i belive it will NOT use them. you need the -generic kernel
2008-03-24T12:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 at least thats how the  hardy release it working for me.  (which i am  beta testign right now)
2008-03-24T12:46:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	yea it sees the system as haveing 2 cores.
2008-03-24T12:47:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	just tryin to make sure i am getting max performance out of my computer :)
2008-03-24T12:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 even when reencodeing videos.. i rarely seem to max out my 2 cpus.
2008-03-24T12:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dabbill	 theres always other bottlenecks it seems.
2008-03-24T12:48:00.000Z	dabbill	Dr_willis	yea, just wish i could get my video card to work correctly now, so that i can game on this PC.
