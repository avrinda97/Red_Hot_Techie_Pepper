2005-01-10T12:57:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	do you have an entry like that?
2005-01-10T12:59:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	take off the ``0,'' part
2005-01-10T13:00:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	seems like you don't have any hard disks
2005-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	I don't know what's up then, grub might be having problems probing stuff
2005-01-10T13:05:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	http://rafb.net/paste/results/X9g9iW93.html <-- is your grub entry like that?
2005-01-10T13:07:00.000Z	broodster	jmob	yes
2005-01-10T13:07:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	I'm not sure what's up then
2005-01-10T13:08:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	try booting a LiveCD and seeing if that helps grub find your hard drives
2005-01-10T13:08:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	also, why don't you have a swap partition?
2005-01-10T13:09:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	not according to fdisk, you said you only had one hd right?
2005-01-10T13:10:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	how is it not working? i.e. how is it failing?
2005-01-10T13:12:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	you can mess with grub interactively when you first boot up
2005-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	no, when the computer boots up
2005-01-10T13:34:00.000Z	jmob	broodster	you don't have one
