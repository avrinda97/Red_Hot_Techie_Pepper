2008-04-03T02:34:00.000Z	iNoob		in the theme manager on ubuntu, i clicked install, selected the theme file, and then it says that the theme was installed, but it wont show up in the theme manager... does anyone know why this is happening?
2008-04-03T02:36:00.000Z	iNoob		So... I suppose no one can help?
2008-04-03T02:38:00.000Z	iNoob		Has it?
2008-04-03T02:38:00.000Z	iNoob		Its probably because all the teachers are on drugs now :P
2008-04-03T02:39:00.000Z	iNoob		I don't like no child left behind.. the kids that are struggling need a separate class
2008-04-03T02:40:00.000Z	iNoob		sorry, someone brought it up and i thought i would finish my thought.
2008-04-03T02:40:00.000Z	iNoob		but yeah.. is there anyone here that can help me with my theme problem?
2008-04-03T02:40:00.000Z	iNoob		huh?
2008-04-03T02:41:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	heh, please don't ask to ask a question, please just ask the question :)
2008-04-03T02:42:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	please just wait a moment. sometimes people need to research a question so it takes a minute.
2008-04-03T02:43:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	you're on gutsy i assume? and can you further describe "theme manager"? is this with metacity?
2008-04-03T02:45:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	very sorry, honestly i use Emerald so i'm not that familiar.
2008-04-03T02:45:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	install compiz, #compiz-fusion
2008-04-03T02:46:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	well then compiz is not running currently. do you have DRI enabled? (find out by "glxinfo | grep direct")
2008-04-03T03:33:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	sorry about that. something came up. as far as the window problem you can either alt+f2 and then emerald replace, or use the "disown" command to gain your terminal back
2008-04-03T03:42:00.000Z	iNoob	icanhasadmin_	how do i get back to the other window manager?
2008-04-03T03:43:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	metacity --replace
2008-04-03T03:49:00.000Z	icanhasadmin_	iNoob	you may need to compile and run fusion-icon using git, go to #compiz-fusion for more info
