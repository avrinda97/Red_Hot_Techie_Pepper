2011-03-28T08:46:00.000Z	folorn		im looking for someone who's done a install of quake4  linux- the question is why do i get a texture error and it semi locks up- when i try to ./ aka run the program
2011-03-28T08:47:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	could you provide the specific error as well?
2011-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	is that the full error? It says "texture error", and nothing else when you load quake4?
2011-03-28T08:55:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	the error is "texture compression unavailable", apparently.
2011-03-28T08:55:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	what kind of video card do you have? Is this in a virtual machine?
2011-03-28T09:00:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	glxinfo, maybe
2011-03-28T09:02:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	which process?
2011-03-28T09:03:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	so you don't have a terminal available?
2011-03-28T09:05:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	what pgrep command are you using?
2011-03-28T09:06:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	and there were none?
2011-03-28T09:06:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	you may have to use "ps aux" to find out what he process is called.
2011-03-28T09:06:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	you can do that, and you will not lose it all, but it might not terminate the quake process.
2011-03-28T09:09:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	reboot
2011-03-28T09:17:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	ideas on what?
2011-03-28T09:18:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	which errors?
2011-03-28T09:19:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	I don't know what you're talking about.
2011-03-28T09:20:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	however, i've had a couple of drinks since you first started, so you may just have to explain it again.
2011-03-28T09:22:00.000Z	ayecee	folorn	I don't understand. Let's see if this is correct - you ran quake4, received an error about texture compression, rebooted, then your bottom pannel was gone?
