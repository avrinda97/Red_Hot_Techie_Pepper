2012-09-23T20:31:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		Hello, I'm having difficulty installing ubuntu
2012-09-23T20:33:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		I downloaded the 12.04 ISO, and used Daemon Tools Pro to burn it onto a DVD. I booted my computer from the disk and checked it for defaults, of which there are none. I go to install alongside Windows 7. It brings up a Command Line Interface with a load of text, ejects the disk  and says "Please remove installation media and close the tray (if any) then press ENTER
2012-09-23T20:33:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		How can I fix this?
2012-09-23T20:34:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		Then where do I boot from?
2012-09-23T20:34:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		The only other option is to launch Windows 7
2012-09-23T20:35:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		Is booting from the LiveCD not how its installed?
2012-09-23T20:36:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		Yes, I've read that, and I've followed the instructions, but it just ejects the disk and reboots...
2012-09-23T20:38:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		Can Ubuntu be burned onto a DVD? Or must it be a CD?
2012-09-23T20:39:00.000Z	bobweaver	UbuntuNoob	 as of 12.10 it will not fit on cd anymore
2012-09-23T20:40:00.000Z	bobweaver	UbuntuNoob	 how new is this computer ?
2012-09-23T20:40:00.000Z	bobweaver	UbuntuNoob	 is it new enough to have windows secure boot ?
2012-09-23T20:41:00.000Z	bobweaver	UbuntuNoob	 did you check the MD5Sum ?
2012-09-23T20:42:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	bobweaver	I don't think it has secure boot
2012-09-23T20:42:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	bobweaver	whats MD5Sum?
2012-09-23T20:45:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	bobweaver	the sum is e235b63c02644e219b7bf3668f479c9e
2012-09-23T20:45:00.000Z	bobweaver	UbuntuNoob	 then check it :)
2012-09-23T20:47:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	bobweaver	how to check the sum?
2012-09-23T20:48:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	bobweaver	its correct, now what? It still ejects the DVD when I go to install alongside windows 7
