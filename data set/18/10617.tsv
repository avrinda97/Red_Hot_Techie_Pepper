2009-07-31T21:03:00.000Z	ubuntizer		<Trijntje> Oh :(
2009-07-31T21:04:00.000Z	ubuntizer		<jrib> Thanks :-)
2009-07-31T21:04:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	that factoid doesn't mention it but there's also virt-manager for use with KVM. I prefer KVM for Linux guests and VirtualBox for Windows guests.
2009-07-31T21:04:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	migrating a bare-metal install to VirtualBox is possible but not the easiest thing in the world to do.
2009-07-31T21:05:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	yes
2009-07-31T21:06:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	I suggest the non-free VirtualBox from VirtualBox.org
2009-07-31T21:06:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	for one, you get the new 3.0 version.
2009-07-31T21:07:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	there are various ways. a virtual NAT, a bridged network interface, virtual interfaces. In short, yes.
2009-07-31T21:08:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	I don't know of any Google services that don't work in any Linux. What's not working?
2009-07-31T21:09:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	still, not enough information.
2009-07-31T21:09:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	you mean anything *.google.com doesn't load?
2009-07-31T21:10:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	you're on dial up?
2009-07-31T21:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	what about a real simple browser like lynx?
2009-07-31T21:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	does it just sit there and eventually time out, or you get DNS errors, or what?
2009-07-31T21:16:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	no buffer space available? that doesn't sound good.
2009-07-31T21:17:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	can you ping google.com?
2009-07-31T21:47:00.000Z	cellofellow	ubuntizer	till it times out?
