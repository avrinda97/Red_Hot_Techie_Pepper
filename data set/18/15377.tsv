2005-04-06T10:17:00.000Z	baise		does anyone know why i'd get a sluggish when i boot with acpi enabled?
2005-04-06T10:17:00.000Z	baise		a sluggish system*
2005-04-06T10:19:00.000Z	baise		i need acpi because i'm running a p4 laptop with hyperthreaded cpu, but window redraws etc are really slow with acpi
2005-04-06T10:19:00.000Z	Bazzi	baise	you dont *need* HT do you?
2005-04-06T10:19:00.000Z	baise	Bazzi	well it's better for ripping cd's etc
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	Bazzi		ripping cds? that does even my opld p2 266 well :P
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	baise		grip treats as an smp machine, so i can multitask with it
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	baise		but only when acpi is on
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	Bazzi		>:(
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	Bazzi		so you have that 686-smp kernel right?
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	baise	Bazzi	yeah
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	Bazzi		2.6.10-4?
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	baise		2.6.10-5
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	Bazzi		hm, k.
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	Bazzi		I think i read something about that in the 2.6.11 kernel changelog, maybe you should wait till it's ubuntu'ed and see if its any better
2005-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	baise	Bazzi	right, i'll take a look thanks
2005-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	baise	Bazzi	can you remember what it said?
