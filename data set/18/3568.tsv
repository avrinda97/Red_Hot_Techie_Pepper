2009-09-12T15:48:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	any tricks?  i have a vista partition and a recovery partition that i can use to reinstall a diff version of windows
2009-09-12T15:49:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	do want to install ubuntu and vista again? side by side
2009-09-12T15:49:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	didn't mean to hit return.  those are the partitions i would like to rewrite, but leave the ubuntu where its at
2009-09-12T15:49:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	so you have ubuntu and vista already installed?
2009-09-12T15:49:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	yes
2009-09-12T15:50:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	at the grub prompt can you boot into windows vista?
2009-09-12T15:51:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	i can boot into vista if i change the bios from ide mode to the other option
2009-09-12T15:52:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	Sorry but i cannot help with this however if you wanted to re install and overright the windows partition the use gparted or just reinstall vista from the install disc?
2009-09-12T15:52:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	basically i want to install windows 7 on the vista partition
2009-09-12T15:53:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	not the rc, the oem copy i guess... what they have at msdnaa
2009-09-12T15:53:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	Ok well insert the iso you burnt with windows 7 and install that on the vista partition however you will loose whats on that partition
2009-09-12T15:53:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	i'm not really concerned about the vista partition really... i just want to make sure that i don't do anything to damage the linux partitions
2009-09-12T15:54:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	Or use virtualbox and just install windows 7 on that, sorry but i cannot help with windows as this is a ubuntu channel
2009-09-12T15:54:00.000Z	Dan48p	Smooch1502	ok
2009-09-12T15:54:00.000Z	Smooch1502	Dan48p	i suggest virtualbox with windows 7 as windows 7 is still in rc and may contain bugs or wreck your system
