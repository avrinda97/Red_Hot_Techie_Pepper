2009-10-31T03:15:00.000Z	stapel		is there a way of doing more reliable copies, something that maybe do a MD5 check after the copy and retries if it does not match?
2009-10-31T03:15:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	that would make copies much slower
2009-10-31T03:16:00.000Z	stapel	joaopinto	thats ok, ive got time :)
2009-10-31T03:17:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	well, cp assumes your hardware is reliable :)
2009-10-31T03:17:00.000Z	stapel	joaopinto	mine isn't obviously. cp did not work for me :(
2009-10-31T03:18:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	then you have a faulty hardware, what is exactly your problem ?
2009-10-31T03:18:00.000Z	stapel	joaopinto	I want to backup my complete home folder, about 25G, to a USB drive and then do a clean install of Ubuntu on my pc. I have tried a normal "cp" but afterwards I could not open some of the photos that I backed up. Is there a better tool for doing this?
2009-10-31T03:19:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	that is very odd, either your USB is failing or you are hitting a bug
2009-10-31T03:19:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	are you using an ext3 partition ?
2009-10-31T03:20:00.000Z	stapel	joaopinto	ext4 on usb and ext3 on harddisk
2009-10-31T03:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	please check the release notes, there is a known issue with ext3 and large files
2009-10-31T03:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	ops, i mean ext4
2009-10-31T03:21:00.000Z	stapel	joaopinto	how larg is large?
2009-10-31T03:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	your problem is not about the copy tool, you have a system or hw problem that os corrupting the copy
2009-10-31T03:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	you can use rsync, which does validate contents, at least it will do it on the second copy
2009-10-31T03:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	but again, it will just be retrying over your problem
2009-10-31T03:26:00.000Z	stapel	joaopinto	is there maybe an easy way of backing up to dvd?
2009-10-31T03:26:00.000Z	joaopinto	stapel	no idea, i always backup to usb :\
