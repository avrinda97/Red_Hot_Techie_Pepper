2008-02-08T22:40:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	do try to be pleasant about these issues? :)
2008-02-08T22:40:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	that WAS pleasant. ;)
2008-02-08T22:40:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	well, "less pleasant" will cause me to become "less tolerant" :)
2008-02-08T22:40:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	trust me, i could've been a lot worse, but then i've put up with much, MUCh worse than that.
2008-02-08T22:41:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	and i could well say the same to you. but i'd just be being an ass. and Freenode has had enough of that.
2008-02-08T22:41:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	exactly. i need to go finish a project, ttyl.
2009-09-21T13:07:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	excuse me?
2009-09-21T13:10:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	care to explain the "misleading things" comment?
2009-09-21T13:11:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	I was being sarcasting about the "02:45 < mneptok> iolion: yes, buy the same laptop i have :P" comment, best just to let it flow under the bridge.
2009-09-21T13:12:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	when i'm trying to help someone, please do not cast apsersions on my advice.
2009-09-21T13:13:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	then please, don't say things to people who are looking for serious help like that.
2009-09-21T13:13:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	both of us were joking. it was clear i was not being serious. it was NOT clear you were being sarcastic.
2009-09-21T13:14:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	fair enough, as long as we understand each other, i doubt it'll happen again.
2009-10-05T11:43:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	hi, may I pm?
2011-02-04T21:02:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	i'm not reading it like that at all.
2011-02-04T21:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	please let it drop.
2011-02-04T21:04:00.000Z	Gnea	mneptok	if he tries to talk to me again he's going on /ignore
2011-02-04T21:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Gnea	prolly a wise idea at this point.
