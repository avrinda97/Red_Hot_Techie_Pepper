2012-05-29T08:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	ceptic	 bios Av protection - prevents writing to the MBR i belive. or restores the mbr if it changes. so you really dont want that enabled
2012-05-29T09:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	ceptic	why are you using the server cd? the desktop cd can  provide services also
2012-05-29T09:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	ceptic	 you can image the iso file straight to the flash. no extra tools. it does limit what else you can do with the flash. but its the most foolproof way.
2012-05-29T09:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	ceptic	 in windows theres some imageing tools that can image teh iso straight to flash. You might need to rename the isoo to whatever.img for some of them to work
2012-05-29T09:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	ceptic	 i may  have one bookmarked at delicious.com/dr_willis
2012-05-29T09:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	ceptic	 if you are getting read/write/io errors - then  theres issues..
