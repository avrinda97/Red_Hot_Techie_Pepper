2011-11-21T22:45:00.000Z	Kimble		I'm trying to turn on laptop_mode in my kernel, as I'm running Ubuntu Server 11.10 on a laptop.  Changing this value from 0 to 5 is the reported way.
2011-11-21T22:46:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Kimble	try to echo the value into the file if thats really what you need to do
2011-11-21T22:46:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Kimble	/proc file system resides in memory so vim may be reporting errors regarding that,, its not really on a disk
2011-11-21T22:46:00.000Z	Kimble	SolarisBoy	I've tried echoing.  it fails even with sudo.
2011-11-21T22:46:00.000Z	Kimble		permission denied error.
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		you may not be able to write to that file as you are trying than
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		well you can do tee -a
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	Kimble		just so you know, this is a change suggested by the Ubuntu documentation.

2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		echo something | sudo tee -a /proc/wherever/file
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		or don't append rather...
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		over write
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	Kimble		ah, so ignore the -a switch then.
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		echo something | sudo tee /proc/wherever/file
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		yes
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	Kimble		trying now...
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		OR try the same echo command as root.. either or should work for you
2011-11-21T22:49:00.000Z	Kimble	SolarisBoy	that did the trick. Thank you.
