2006-09-28T05:51:00.000Z	Samuli^	Ignite_	there isn't a lot. But hopefully the situation will improve as linux gains popularity.

2006-09-28T05:53:00.000Z	Samuli^	Ignite_	they ARE the best for obvious reasons.
2006-09-28T05:53:00.000Z	Ignite_	Samuli^	why? because they are marketed? I don't thing so..
2006-09-28T05:55:00.000Z	Samuli^	Ignite_	No, obviously marketing does nothing for the quality of the game, but think about it. Do actually hope to see a game like oblivion as open source?

2006-09-28T05:58:00.000Z	Samuli^	Ignite_	it's not a game and took over 10 years to develop. You think that someone is going to go through all that trouble to make a... game?
2006-09-28T05:59:00.000Z	Ignite_	Samuli^	* even..
