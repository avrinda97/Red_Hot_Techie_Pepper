2009-07-17T18:36:00.000Z	linduxed		what could cause all my network interfaces to be gone?
2009-07-17T18:36:00.000Z	linduxed		i have nothing but lo
2009-07-17T18:37:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	 What were you doing when you broke it?
2009-07-17T18:39:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	nothing
2009-07-17T18:39:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	only thing i changed in the system was..
2009-07-17T18:39:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	Please post the output of dmesg | grep eth and also the contents of /etc/network/interfaces
2009-07-17T18:39:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	w8 a minute...
2009-07-17T18:39:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	i updated the kernel!
2009-07-17T18:40:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	that would suck if the current kernel cant handle any network interfaces...
2009-07-17T18:41:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	 I would boot into the old kernel and check out what module it was using for eth0
2009-07-17T18:42:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	if it works when it boots up then thats really bad
2009-07-17T18:43:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	yea, autoupdates that break networking are bad
2009-07-17T18:44:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	that sounds almost like this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/399785
2009-07-17T18:45:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	 Oh, sweet.
2009-07-17T18:45:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	the only problem is that i still cant see it
2009-07-17T18:45:00.000Z	linduxed	qwyeth	i have no net devices
2009-07-17T18:46:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	OK, so you rebooted into the old kernel and you still have no net devices?
2009-07-17T18:49:00.000Z	qwyeth	linduxed	 One thing you might try is to boot to a live CD and see if your device loads... if it doesn't you probably have a hardware problem.
