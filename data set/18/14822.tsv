2005-07-16T05:24:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	Have not played it.. The screenshots on the site look good though..
2005-07-16T05:24:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	podge	meh, it's just an RPG.  I don't really like em.  If you must play a crazy korean online game for windows, try gunbound

2005-07-16T05:36:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	Have you tried 4.1?
2005-07-16T05:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	podge	dunno, what's different?  Does it not crash and screw up and yell at me?
2005-07-16T05:37:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	Netbeans 4.x is much better than the 3.x series..
2005-07-16T05:45:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	That should be easy to do in bash..
2005-07-16T05:45:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	So you have filename.txt and textfile.txt and you want them called filename1.txt and textfile2.txt?
2005-07-16T05:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	podge	no, I have a file that has "file1.ext /dir2/file4.xt file5.ext" on different lines and I want it to end up with "sketch1.gif sketch2.gif sketch3.gif" in some other directory, but i'll just script it...
2005-07-16T05:49:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	Already learning perl? :)
2005-07-16T05:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	podge	I got a little of it in school, yeah.  Heh, I'm not super worried about it right now, I know I'll be able to do it when I need to
2005-07-16T05:51:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	Can you cut and paste a sample of your file on pastebin?..I could give you a script in a few minutes..
2005-07-16T05:52:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	podge	don't worry about it, if it takes a script I'll write it myself
2005-07-16T05:52:00.000Z	podge	tiglionabbit	Cool..
