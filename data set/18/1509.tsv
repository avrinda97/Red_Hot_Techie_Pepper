2012-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Prajyot	why are you using a lucid partner repo on precise?
2012-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Prajyot	never mix releases
2012-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	Prajyot		its default i suppose
2012-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Prajyot	no, that wouldn't be default on a 12.04 install

2012-10-06T16:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Prajyot	wubi isn't meant to be used as a long term solution, its more of a try before you dive in thing
