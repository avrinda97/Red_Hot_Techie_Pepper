2010-04-14T22:37:00.000Z	zer0her0		i have a ~/bin directory in it is a copy of Eclipse, ~/bin is in my path but when i run eclipse i get ~/bin/eclipse: Permission Denied
2010-04-14T22:37:00.000Z	zer0her0		when I really need ~/bin/eclipse/eclipse
2010-04-14T22:37:00.000Z	zer0her0		anyone point me how to fix this?
2010-04-14T22:39:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	If you want to install eclipse the easy way
2010-04-14T22:39:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	type in "sudo apt-get install eclipse"
2010-04-14T22:39:00.000Z	zer0her0	pyMitch	that's an older version
2010-04-14T22:40:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	Why do you need the newest of the new
2010-04-14T22:40:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	Is there a reason
2010-04-14T22:41:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	you should put its in /usr/sbin/
2010-04-14T22:41:00.000Z	zer0her0	pyMitch	ah they are actually finally up to 3.5
2010-04-14T22:43:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	Bash does not look in that folder normally
2010-04-14T22:43:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	to do it more elegantly
2010-04-14T22:43:00.000Z	zer0her0	pyMitch	yes i know i added it to my $PATH variable
2010-04-14T22:44:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	oh
2010-04-14T22:44:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	why do you want it to be there? instead of in /usr/sbin
2010-04-14T22:45:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	this seems like alot of effort over nothing
2010-04-14T22:46:00.000Z	zer0her0	pyMitch	you're exactly right
2010-04-14T22:46:00.000Z	pyMitch	zer0her0	Lol
