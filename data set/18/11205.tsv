2006-09-01T13:12:00.000Z	earthian		could someone guide me in PM how to make my soundcard work?
2006-09-01T13:13:00.000Z	earthian		or even here if its easier for you :)
2006-09-01T13:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	it's better to have a conversation out here, as others can help troubleshoot :-)
2006-09-01T13:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	he's gone
2006-09-01T13:25:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	lol
2006-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	no internet on that computer. and he's already updated his sources.list
2006-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	but thank you :-)
2006-09-01T13:31:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	:-)
2006-09-01T13:32:00.000Z	earthian	ladydoor	u could maybe kill that process and restart it then?
2006-09-01T13:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	tried, but id didn't work. thanks anyway
2006-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	it puts you into the Linux Console, and to get back you press control-alt-f7
2007-08-01T16:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	sudo shutdown -h now
2007-08-01T16:51:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	No problem. Note that you do need root priviliges, which could make your script interesting.
2007-08-01T16:51:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	Cool.
2007-08-01T16:52:00.000Z	earthian	ladydoor	also is it bad to call HALT directly?
2007-08-01T16:52:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	I don't think so
2007-08-01T16:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	earthian	However, I believe that if you call halt when not at a shutdown or reboot runlevel, it'll just call shutdown anyway
