2008-10-31T20:44:00.000Z	n8tuser		norbs101-> youhave a separate /boot partition right?
2008-10-31T20:46:00.000Z	n8tuser		norbs101-> and what happens when it boots to that? does it matches whats in your menu.lst ?
2008-10-31T20:47:00.000Z	n8tuser		matteo_-> as long as you script can be foudn in the $PATH
2008-10-31T20:47:00.000Z	n8tuser		norbs101-> you can not boot of a raid directly as far as i know..but i could be wrong, you need that separate /boot to boot from
2008-10-31T20:48:00.000Z	n8tuser		spsneo-> configure it in /etc/network/interfaces file
2008-10-31T20:49:00.000Z	n8tuser		spsneo-> kindly   man interfaces or do a tutorial on ubuntu networking
2008-10-31T20:49:00.000Z	n8tuser		norbs101-> yes, a separate partition just for /boot, google for this issue regarding booting from a system with raid
2008-10-31T20:51:00.000Z	n8tuser		Qbuntu-> you can edit the file direclty ..  sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-10-31T20:52:00.000Z	n8tuser		digitig-> how do you know they are not mounted?
2008-10-31T20:52:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	windows drives don't map automatically without a fstab entry
2008-10-31T20:53:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	I would assume because there's no desktop icon
2008-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	he did mention being new to linux, and the default action for unmapped windows drives is to list them in the places..... fair enough
2008-10-31T20:57:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	any guesses on why the network manager would stop being able to use the keyring without a password?
2008-10-31T20:58:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	I'm aware... but previously it was able to load it without a password before... now it is asking for one every time I log in
2008-10-31T21:00:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	I'm aware... this isn't a reconfiguration... this is on login the network manager asking for my password in order to conenct to a wifi with a stored password
2008-10-31T21:01:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	never used to... that's the weird thing
2008-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	what package do I need in order to change the password on the keyring?
2008-10-31T21:15:00.000Z	koruptid	n8tuser	I can't find any way in Passwords & Encryption to change keyring settings.... the only things I see are for PGP
