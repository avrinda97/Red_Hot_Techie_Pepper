2010-02-28T22:54:00.000Z	bcj		Can fsck kill a partition?
2010-02-28T22:54:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	on a healthy hard drive with a healthy partition.. I doubt it
2010-02-28T22:55:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	I ran into problems with what I thought was my hard drive.  Since running fsck it's become so screwed.
2010-02-28T22:55:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	could it be that the hard drive was failing and that was why you were running fsck in the first place?
2010-02-28T22:56:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	Yes, but now both hard drives are giving the same error when a check is run on them.
2010-02-28T22:56:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	fsck is being run on boot and backtracing.
2010-02-28T22:56:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	I'm not saying that fsck is perfect and without bugs.. but I think it's one of the more stable apps
2010-02-28T22:58:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	I haven't seen that kind of behaviour on my machines.. can't say I've heard about it in this channel either..
2010-02-28T22:58:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	not really sure what to do about it.. check the s.m.a.r.t info on the drive.. see if it's dying on you.. you can always try running a live cd and try fsck'ing from that
2010-02-28T22:58:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	I wouldn't normally worry, but this is my file server.
2010-02-28T22:59:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	you're not running fsck on a live file system.. right?
2010-02-28T22:59:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	...and both disks on the server are fooked.
2010-02-28T22:59:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	No, running on boot (before mount), or manually unmount first.
2010-02-28T23:00:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	well.. as I said.. I've never heard of a fsck killing an otherwise healthy drive.. but give the live cd a try in case the local binary has been damaged somehow
2010-02-28T23:10:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	Looks like the RAM is borked.
2010-02-28T23:11:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	ah.. that might explain it
2010-02-28T23:21:00.000Z	bcj	Slart	The error is quite high in the RAM (~940MB) - can you by any chance remember the boot parameter that sets the memory size, or, rather, how to make 9.10 boot whilst using only the low 512MB or RAM?
2010-02-28T23:23:00.000Z	Slart	bcj	hmm.. max_addr ?
