2006-12-30T06:19:00.000Z	brrrt		who has ever successfully installed java on LiveCD??
2006-12-30T06:19:00.000Z	Kesman	brrrt	why would you want to do that?
2006-12-30T06:20:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	i need it e.g. for my netbanking
2006-12-30T06:20:00.000Z	Kesman	brrrt	but why don't you install the system and then try again?
2006-12-30T06:21:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	i am experimenting with the persitent feature and i want java
2006-12-30T06:21:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	why not?
2006-12-30T06:22:00.000Z	Kesman	brrrt	ok well, are you running the 32 bit or 64 bit version?
2006-12-30T06:23:00.000Z	Kesman	brrrt	I just would prefer the installed version since it's so much faster and the stuff you do to it last after rebooting :P
2006-12-30T06:23:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	32bit
2006-12-30T06:24:00.000Z	Kesman	brrrt	have you tried http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Java_.26_Non-Media_Browser_Plug-ins
2006-12-30T06:24:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	sure install alot is faster, but i would like to have a full featured emergency system
2006-12-30T06:24:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	thy for the hint, i will give it try
2006-12-30T06:24:00.000Z	Kesman	brrrt	but all the changes you make to the live cd are gone when you restart right?
2006-12-30T06:25:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	no i am using the persitence feature of the live cd, it safes my settings on an usb stick
2006-12-30T06:28:00.000Z	brrrt	Kesman	check this out, it's a really coool feature: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence
