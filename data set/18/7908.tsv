2008-12-15T11:28:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: define "properly"
2008-12-15T11:28:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: oh, and once you know how to use it properly you'll love it
2008-12-15T11:29:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: OH REALLY?
2008-12-15T11:31:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: hmmm, it doesnt happen for me
2008-12-15T11:32:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: I used linux since 1998, and it wasnt that good for an average user and it was for me.. what you're saying doesnt really "make sense"
2008-12-15T11:34:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: yea, as if Windows supports printers
2008-12-15T11:34:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: HP or some company have to make drivers for you @ windows because windows doesnt support any printers
2008-12-15T11:35:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: windows never supported any printer.. windows never supported wireless cards.etc
2008-12-15T11:35:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: its always 3rd party or company themselves that create drivers
2008-12-15T11:35:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: yet linux supports a lot of stuff "natively" because of its neat design
2008-12-15T11:37:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: even google employees use linux
2008-12-15T11:37:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: linux conquered server marketshare
2008-12-15T11:38:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: linux has millions of users in desktop
2008-12-15T11:38:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	: I have many reasons not use windows, and no i can afford to buy 10 vista licenses if i want
2008-12-15T11:39:00.000Z	orgthingy	srip	until 2014 ? XP support will end this year :)
