2005-10-18T11:46:00.000Z	Severian	bob2	I have not.  I came here first.  bugzilla was to follow if the bug was not well known.  I'll have to create a bugzilla account and it seemed prudent to ask here first.  Is that bad?
2005-10-18T11:46:00.000Z	bob2	Severian	not as long as you do end up reporting it :)
