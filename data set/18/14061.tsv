2006-11-20T08:32:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	doesn't work
2006-11-20T08:33:00.000Z	sladen	NET||abuse	what error message do you get, are you on dapper (6.06LTS, or 6.10, or edgy?)
2006-11-20T08:33:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	dapper,
2006-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	litterally i get  Unmet build dependencies: libgnome-window-settings-dev
2006-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	sladen	NET||abuse	I think will have to get the packages from backports (if they are availble);  beryl is very recent code under active development---the packages are in edgy but not really suitable for the stable versions of ubuntu that have already been released
2006-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	hmm, i'll investigate my backports deb lines in sources
2006-11-20T08:36:00.000Z	sladen	NET||abuse	libgnome-window-settings-dev is the replacement for 'gnome-control-center' ; if you modify the build-dependancies in   beryl-.../debian/control  and replace 'libgnome-window-settings-dev' with 'gnome-control-center' you maybe able to build the package;  however it really is very new technology
2006-11-20T08:37:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	:) i've been building beryl for a few months now... i should be better on this lark, but hacking around with the dependancies won't be a problem
2006-11-20T08:38:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	just letting it's go through the build again and see what it comes acropper of this time,
2006-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	nuts, problems are a little more extensive... configure: error: Package requirements ( xrender >= 0.8.4                  gtk+-2.0 >= 2.8.0    libwnck-1.0                    beryl             gconf-2.0               pangocairo             libmetacity-private >= 2.15.21) were not met: Requested 'libmetacity-private >= 2.15.21' but version of libmetacity-private is 2.14.5
2006-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	sladen	NET||abuse	I think the best thing might be to find the ubuntu backports guys
2006-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	sladen	NET||abuse	I think they hang around at http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/ bug should be able to help you (you could request a backport for beryl)
2006-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	hmm
2006-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	well i'm kinda interested in keeping beryl available on dapper
2006-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	i've had it working quite well up till now,, havn't compiled ina week, was working back then, now it's borked.
2006-11-20T08:54:00.000Z	sladen	NET||abuse	where was the copy of beryl(?) you had working from?
2006-11-20T08:54:00.000Z	NET||abuse	sladen	i compiled it from svn
