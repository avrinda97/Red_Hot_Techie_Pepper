2010-03-26T01:20:00.000Z	moosekaka		hello i am wondering if anyone has an opinion if hardy 64 or jaunty 64 or karmic 64 is 'better'?
2010-03-26T01:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		better means more stable/less regression/driver support
2010-03-26T01:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		looking to install on amd athlon quad core 630
2010-03-26T01:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		with ATI 4670
2010-03-26T01:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		dual boot with win 7
2010-03-26T01:22:00.000Z	moosekaka		im asking because i found that 8.04 was the best version for my Dell Laptop
2010-03-26T01:22:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	lucid 64..  karmic doesnt support your ati OOTB, but lucid does.. and will have FGLRX drivers ready soon..
2010-03-26T01:23:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	with karmic you might have to choose safe gfx mode to boot the livecd, and then install the driver to get propre screen res..
2010-03-26T01:23:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	well for me and my ati 4650 thats what I had to do.
2010-03-26T01:25:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	if you are going to install 1 but dont want to use beta, then use karmic.
2010-03-26T01:27:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	ati`s driver, rather than the free open source driver, which, for your card as i said, isnt supported in karmic without adding a ppa and updating the kernel/xorg
2010-03-26T01:28:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	you might be fine booting a karmic livecd, but if you have trouble you`ll have to choose safe gfx mode from boot menu..
2010-03-26T01:29:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	no thats just the free driver.. fglrx (in hardware drivers) works fine
2010-03-26T01:30:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	grab the karmic live cd and try it....
2010-03-26T01:30:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	lucid is out end of next month...something to thinkk about.
2010-03-26T01:31:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	only if you use the free Radeon driver..
2010-03-26T01:33:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	just try the livecd.. if it boots into the GUI fine, then you can install no worries and then enable the 3d driver easy.. if yo cant boot it, and get blank screen, then you`ll need to boot into safe gfx mode (one of the F keys at livecd boot menu, F4 I think)... then you can install and then enable the 3d driver..
2010-03-26T01:34:00.000Z	deanus	moosekaka	I`m just giving you a heads up, seeing as we have similar cards.
