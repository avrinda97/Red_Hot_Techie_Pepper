2005-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	lightbright		can I install Konqueror?
2005-11-20T07:33:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	yes, but it will install a lot of KDE dependencies anyway
2005-11-20T07:33:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	ok
2005-11-28T07:40:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	thanks :)
2005-11-28T07:41:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	how do I install Java?
2005-12-01T17:08:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	don't think that'll do much, if apt-get was used when installing
2005-12-01T17:09:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	really?  if something was installed with apt-get, aptitude cant remove it?  really?
2005-12-01T17:09:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	no, it *can* remove it, it's just not going to have an advantage over removing it with apt-get
2005-12-01T17:10:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	who told you that?
2005-12-01T17:10:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	how do you know for certain that it wont have an advantage over removing it with apt-get?
2005-12-01T17:11:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	because it won't know which packages were installed automatically and which ones were installed manually
2005-12-01T15:15:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	well, i don't think it's nearly like that ;)
2005-12-01T15:15:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	;)
2005-12-01T15:17:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	by... dragging them? :)
2005-12-02T17:33:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	aren't you just chosing folders you don't have access to?
2005-12-02T17:33:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	no, i have access to all of them
2005-12-08T14:47:00.000Z	LjL	lightbright	an about window? ;)
2005-12-20T16:02:00.000Z	lightbright	LjL	no, its not a broken monitor for a broken monitor doesnt even work
