2006-04-12T07:33:00.000Z	pinkmermaid		Boo... and VLC won't show me the video for a WMV 9 file.
2006-04-12T07:34:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	just plain vlc from the repos?
2006-04-12T07:35:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	yeah
2006-04-12T07:37:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	i don't think the packaged one can
2006-04-12T07:37:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	 oh, okay~
2006-04-12T07:37:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	someone sent me this: http://www.nanocrew.net/2005/09/01/compiling-vlc/
2006-04-12T07:37:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	up to you if you want to try it.  i haven't yet
2006-04-12T07:38:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	I just found that with google, about to try it. :)
2006-04-12T07:38:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	let me know how it goes
2006-04-12T07:38:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	Sure :)
2006-04-12T07:44:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	looks like I won't be able to do it... It needs a file (VC1_reference_decoder_release6.zip) and it looks like one can't really get ahold of it easily
2006-04-12T07:45:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	ah, that's a shame.  thanks.
2006-04-12T07:45:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	oop, never mind. Found it~
2006-04-12T08:02:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	how's it going?
2006-04-12T08:03:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	fairly well, I think, though I've hit a little snag. I need to install a newer version of automake than what ubuntu has.
2006-04-14T07:46:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	how did your vlc compile go?
2006-04-14T07:46:00.000Z	pinkmermaid	orbin	it didn't... In the end, I couldn't get VLC itself to compile because of errors, and I gave up after 3 or 4 tries. Heh.
2006-04-14T07:47:00.000Z	orbin	pinkmermaid	shame.  i'm sure they're working on support though
