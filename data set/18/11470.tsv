2010-07-11T09:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	probably a pulse audio issue
2010-07-11T09:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	Sound is a common issue with Ubuntu since 8.04 since pulseaudio.  However with Ubuntu personally I woudn't mess around removing pulseaudio  without knowing for sure, that it is the cause of the sound problem.  There is something else you can try, if you got enough space in your install, to find out if the problem is pulseaudio or not.
2010-07-11T09:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	oh so sound worked before?
2010-07-11T09:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	ok and you were on 9.10 before?  and sound worked fine there?
2010-07-11T09:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	ok well your previous kernel/s are probably still installed, so you could boot from that and try
2010-07-11T09:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	ok
2010-07-11T09:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	options  1.   stick around here, try the Ubuntu forums even, and someone may be able to help you properly.   2.  It will take up quite a bit of space, but you could install Kubuntu and try that, doesn't use pulse audio by default :)  3.  Maybe  clean install and put 9.10 on or something.
2010-07-11T09:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	I can't really be of much help, so good luck!
2010-07-11T09:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	np
2010-07-11T09:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manoj	maybe I wasn't clear about something, if you do install Kubuntu,  you have both, and then choose the one you want from log in screen.  Seems a little silly to install all of that, because of pulseaudio though, but whatever may work I guess?
