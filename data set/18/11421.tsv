2006-08-09T14:32:00.000Z	cica		not really a Linux question, but whats the best way to compress Jpegs on a Ubuntu system to be transfered and opened by a Windoze system?
2006-08-09T14:33:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	jpegs are compressed, if you want to store lots of them in one file, make a zip file?
2006-08-09T14:33:00.000Z	wweasel		!ask
2006-08-09T14:33:00.000Z	wweasel		oops.
2006-08-09T14:33:00.000Z	cica	wweasel	tried that but it doesn't seem to make much difference to the overall size :-(
2006-08-09T14:33:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	Yeah, that's cause JPEGs are compressed already
2006-08-09T14:34:00.000Z	cica	wweasel	any idea how I could transfer these files other than email?
2006-08-09T14:34:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	ftp
2006-08-09T14:34:00.000Z	cica	wweasel	would an ftp connection be easy to set uo
2006-08-09T14:35:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	how big are the files we are talking about?
2006-08-09T14:35:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	can you burn a cd? Use a USB key?
2006-08-09T14:35:00.000Z	cica	wweasel	25M in total
2006-08-09T14:35:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	www.yousendit.com
2006-08-09T14:35:00.000Z	cica	wweasel	prefer to do it over Internet/FTP (if its not too hard to set up)
2006-08-09T14:36:00.000Z	wweasel	cica	Make a zip file and mail it over www.yousendit.com
