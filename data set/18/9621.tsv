2009-11-16T01:45:00.000Z	connor_		Hey guys, I'm having a problem with my Grub. I installed Startup-Manager and tweaked some graphics settings but I think I screwed it up. The Ubuntu logo renders in a hard-to-describe ugly way and it gies me an error.
2009-11-16T01:46:00.000Z	connor_		Error says "vga=769 is deprecated. Use set gfxpayload=640x480x8,640x480 before linux command instead."
2009-11-16T01:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	Remove the vga= line from /etc/default/grub
2009-11-16T01:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	Then instead add a line like the example gfxpayload= to /etc/grub.d/40_custom
2009-11-16T01:48:00.000Z	connor_	Jordan_U	I don't see a vga= line in /etc/default/grub
2009-11-16T01:48:00.000Z	connor_	Jordan_U	Nevermind, I see it.
2009-11-16T01:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	You should also file a bug report against Startup Manager
2009-11-16T01:49:00.000Z	connor_	Jordan_U	Should I add the gfxpayload where vga=769 was?
2009-11-16T01:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	No
2009-11-16T01:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	In its own line in /etc/grub.d/40_custom
2009-11-16T01:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	Would you mind filing a bug report against Startup Manager?
2009-11-16T01:51:00.000Z	connor_	Jordan_U	I'm on their Launchpad now.
2009-11-16T01:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	Thank you, bug reporting is a very important contribution.
2009-11-16T02:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	You could try asking in #grub but it might be an issue with usplash rather than your grub configuration
2011-04-20T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	install xscreensaver-data-extra
2011-04-20T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	You're welcome.
2011-04-20T08:03:00.000Z	connor_	Jordan_U	Thank you, it worked :)
2011-04-20T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	connor_	You're welcome :)
