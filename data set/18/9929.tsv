2008-02-13T06:47:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	first you figure out if there's any other way to get that program.
2008-02-13T06:47:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	which one?
2008-02-13T06:48:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	ok, I have ref for the new atis
2008-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	clt-alt-backspace, ctl-alt-f2 , login.  sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop (this stops your X server. Do the install, then  sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start to restart X server
2008-02-13T06:54:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	you can use clt-alt-f2 and clt-alt-f7 to switch back and forth while the X server is running
2008-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	eck090	nickrud	can you rpost those directions
2008-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	 clt-alt-backspace, ctl-alt-f2 , login.  sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop (this stops your X server. Do the install, then  sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start to restart X server
2008-02-13T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	eck090	in the rare case where you don't automatically get returned to the gui when you run the start, hit ctl-alt-f7
