2009-05-01T21:18:00.000Z	philsf	benn	this channel is very heavy traffic. if everyone pasted here, no one would be able to follow conversations
2009-05-01T21:19:00.000Z	philsf	benn	so people have to paste somewhere else, hence the pastebin
2009-05-01T21:19:00.000Z	philsf	benn	if you did read the link given, you would understand
2009-05-01T21:19:00.000Z	benn	philsf	how???wha to write?
