2007-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	GNine		infrarecorder will work just fine.
2007-10-01T12:26:00.000Z	GNine		you just have to firgure out why its not (for you).. on the other hand , the easy out IS to pick one program that'll work.
2007-10-01T12:26:00.000Z	GNine		(i like tinkering tho)
2007-10-01T12:28:00.000Z	GNine		all you need is in your "Actions" menu (on infrarecorder)
2007-10-01T12:28:00.000Z	GNine		one option.. and select you iso.
2007-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	GNine		the program is self explanatory , any simpler than that would be mind control.
2007-10-01T12:31:00.000Z	GNine		hmm.. still..  you are dealing with a puter .. not a .. VCR. (which is technially still a computer)
2007-10-01T12:32:00.000Z	GNine		my final word. deal wItH iT
2007-10-01T12:34:00.000Z	GNine		its like saying 24bit is just as good as 32bit colors.  and still you wont notice the difference
2007-10-01T12:35:00.000Z	frostburn	GNine	they are the same colors
2007-10-01T12:36:00.000Z	GNine		funny thing (i have said this b4) i dont have infrarecorder on my linux machine. i runned that on windblows.
2007-10-01T12:37:00.000Z	GNine		:-P
2007-10-01T12:37:00.000Z	GNine	frostburn	read my sentence again
2007-10-01T12:38:00.000Z	GNine		windblows thru the windows
2007-10-01T12:38:00.000Z	frostburn	GNine	with 32 bit color, there's still only 24 bits devoted to color.  it's still the same colors
2007-10-01T12:39:00.000Z	GNine	frostburn	hence my reference to the point that "you still wont notice the difference"
2007-10-01T12:39:00.000Z	frostburn	GNine	i must have missed the beginning of the conversation
