2007-05-31T13:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		Anyone with a Phoenix BIOS, I need the 64KB section from F0000. You can get it simply by soing "sudo dd if=/dev/mem of=BIOS-F000.bin bs=65536 count=1 skip=15" and then gzip the file
2007-05-31T13:16:00.000Z	clearzen	IntuitiveNipple	I may have a phoenix bios...can I tell from a terminal?
2007-05-31T13:16:00.000Z	clearzen	IntuitiveNipple	It may be my server that has the phoenix bios I can't remeber
2007-05-31T13:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	 nikin Yes, any will do. I'm having to disassemble it to work out what the code at F4120 is doing, and I have just sent my only PC with a Phoenix BIOS off to be serviced
2007-05-31T13:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	If you type at a terminal "sudo dd if=/dev/mem of=BIOS-F000.bin bs=65536 count=1 skip=15" and then do "grep 'Phoenix' BIOS-F000.bin that should show if it is Phoenix
2007-05-31T13:19:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	nikin: The reason I need this is, I have a laptop that has VMX (hardware Virtualisation) but the BIOS doesn't provide an option to enable it so I'm hacking it to enable VMX
2007-05-31T13:20:00.000Z	clearzen	IntuitiveNipple	It says that the Binary file BIOS-F000.bin matches. I assume that means it is a phoenix bios image then
2007-05-31T13:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	Yes I think so :) Could you compress the file using "gzip BIOS-F000.bin" please?
2007-05-31T13:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	The *all* you need to do is upload it to a file-sharing service :)
2007-05-31T13:22:00.000Z	clearzen	IntuitiveNipple	sure just give me a sec
2007-05-31T13:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	I very much appreciate your help - you're saving me having to wait until my laptop returns middle of next week, to do this :)
2007-05-31T13:23:00.000Z	clearzen	IntuitiveNipple	Is bzip ok? or do you want it gziped?
2007-05-31T13:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	Any will do :)
2007-05-31T13:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	nikin: On yousendit set the email to bios@tjworld.net please
2007-05-31T13:25:00.000Z	clearzen	IntuitiveNipple	If you want I can rsync it to you
2007-05-31T13:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	Join me in #TJ
2007-05-31T13:35:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	clearzen	nikin: Fantastic, thanks for your help, I have what I need now
