2010-02-11T01:37:00.000Z	juancarlospaco		someone have a Guide/tuto/tips'N'Tricks/candy/Wiki for making a Ubuntu-Only WIFI? (to use apt-mirror)
2010-02-11T01:38:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	There is no easy way to do that
2010-02-11T01:38:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	edeca	doesnt matter
2010-02-11T01:38:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	802.1d might help ,but not much
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	And 802.1d isn't easy to setup
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	edeca	im CCNA, i think i can do it
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	If you're a CCNA, you should know how to use google.
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	edeca	yes
2010-02-11T01:40:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	edeca	but is not suggested to say "go and search google" on support chat, lol, i mean i looking for experiences by other users
2010-02-11T01:40:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	Essentially, there is no portion in a wireless handshake that tells the router/base station what OS it is.  The only potential way is something higher level like 802.1d, but even then it's not going to be possible to restrict it to a specific OS
2010-02-11T01:40:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	Much less one distribution of an OS (e.g. Ubuntu/Debian/whatever)
2010-02-11T01:41:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	Ubuntu doesn't have different networking or drivers to Debian/Gentoo/Slackware/whatever, so there is no way to differentiate
2010-02-11T01:41:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	edeca	maybe no distro but kernel linux
2010-02-11T01:41:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	edeca	plan: apt-mirror on the ubuntu wifi, Wsus on the windows wifi
2010-02-11T01:41:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	802.1d is as close as you will get to ethernet/wireless security.  And it's a pain.
2010-02-11T01:42:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	That's not an issue, surely?  You push DNS records to windows hosts and group policy for the wsus (off-topic) and set your linux hosts to a specific mirror
2010-02-11T01:42:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	What I do on my network is "spoof" gb.archive.ubuntu.com to internal-mirror.lan
2010-02-11T01:43:00.000Z	edeca	juancarlospaco	That way, when a laptop is inside the network it pulls from the local mirror.  When it is outside, it gets updates as normal
