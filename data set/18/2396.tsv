2011-01-11T05:16:00.000Z	bugs_bugger		hey guys. curious question: is it possible to create executable shellscript files from c sources?
2011-01-11T05:18:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	well sort of, you can write a program in c (source code) and make it executable.  But it would not be called a script
2011-01-11T05:18:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	You can write executable scripts in other languages like python or bash
2011-01-11T05:19:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	You can do something like that in python
2011-01-11T05:19:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	But you would have to be in that folder to run that program
2011-01-11T05:19:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	edbian	well, i dont that much about building apart from using ./configure, make and make install with c sources
2011-01-11T05:20:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	edbian	what im aiming at is to have a form of binaries like those of the blender 3d suit, for example
2011-01-11T05:20:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	What is the ultimate goal / purpose of this question?  :)
2011-01-11T05:20:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	A 'form
2011-01-11T05:22:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	what is a 'form
2011-01-11T05:23:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	edbian	they offer their linux versions in an archive that just needs upacking.it contains an executable ready to start. thats what i want to have
2011-01-11T05:24:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	edbian	problem is: i dont have sudo rights on the system. its a pool of my high school.
2011-01-11T05:25:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	You can compile and run software from inside you're home.  You just can't install it.  In this case installing really just means putting various files in various folders on the system.
2011-01-11T05:25:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	It's just that most apps have to be installed to work at all
2011-01-11T05:25:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	edbian	to which i dont have access to
2011-01-11T05:26:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	Yeah, I understand.  I think you can recreate the file tree you need inside you're home.
2011-01-11T05:26:00.000Z	edbian	bugs_bugger	I've never done it and it's elaborate but you can do it
2011-01-11T05:29:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	edbian	in the terminal i get "ELF 32-bit LSB executable". no idea how to build something like that? it uses shared libs
