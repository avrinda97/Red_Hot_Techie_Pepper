2009-08-18T02:24:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob		Alright so it totally seems like I already asked this question but it's slightly altered now: Why can't I find the ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver?  It appears I need to download it in order to install Catalyst.
2009-08-18T02:25:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob		It's not on there.  It's completely blank.
2009-08-18T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	that suggests that your card isn't supported by fglrx any more
2009-08-18T02:27:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	use the open source driver
2009-08-18T02:28:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	Well, the reason I feel like that isn't the case is on the BinaryDriverHowTo for ATI it mentions the x300 as being supported and the first step of installing it is enabling said driver.
2009-08-18T02:28:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	What's the open source driver/where do I get it?
2009-08-18T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati
2009-08-18T02:34:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	It says I have the newest xserver-xorg-video-ati version already.
2009-08-18T02:36:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	and that is not ok for you?
2009-08-18T02:37:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	Well, it still doesn't work.
2009-08-18T02:37:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	Installing Catalyst, that is.
2009-08-18T02:38:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	catalyst is *not* for the open source driver!!!
2009-08-18T02:39:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	Erm... I knew that.  I guess I have a lot less of an idea what I'm doing than you think :P  Where can I find installation instructions for that?
2009-08-18T02:39:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	why do you want catalyst?
2009-08-18T02:39:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	I don't know I just want a driver for my video card!  Any driver will do >_>
2009-08-18T02:40:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	I have an x1300, I use the open source driver - didn't really miss catalyst
2009-08-18T02:41:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	guntbert	I have an x300- are those similar?
2009-08-18T02:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Pseudo_Bob	no idea, I assumed yours was older, but... - listen to bucky please
