2006-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	gonniff		I'm finding LAN and wireless don't like each other on my laptop (using Dapper)
2006-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	gonniff		Has anyone else had this problem?
2006-07-08T09:16:00.000Z	gonniff		If I leave the office without deactivating ethernet, my wireless won't work at home
2006-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	gonniff		My card info is as follows: RealTek RTL8139  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8100B/8139D'
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		yeah, it sure is. But then, ACPI really doesn't like this either. :)
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		I tried a test this morning: closed all apps, locked the screen and then came back about 15 minutes later. Machine was locked up. Had to reboot.
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		I'm not complaining - I think Dapper rules!
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		I used to be a huge SuSE fan, but this is much better for daily computing
2006-07-08T09:20:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	Ok, what's wrong then?
2006-07-08T09:21:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	Um...ok...
2006-07-08T09:21:00.000Z	gonniff	SonicChao	which part? The acpi or the networking?
2006-07-08T09:21:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	I don't know, you said your comp froze
2006-07-08T09:21:00.000Z	gonniff	SonicChao	hahaha, sorry, too much coffee on my part. :)
2006-07-08T09:22:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	You can say that again, hyper :P
2006-07-08T09:23:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	Okay, okay, slow down
2006-07-08T09:24:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	I use Mozilla Thunderbird
2006-07-08T09:25:00.000Z	gonniff	SonicChao	yeah, me, too, normally, but thought I'd give it a second chance (hated it under Red Hat)
2006-07-08T09:26:00.000Z	SonicChao	gonniff	Definetaly nt....:D
