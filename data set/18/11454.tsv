2009-09-06T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	oh your on andlinux?
2009-09-06T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	ok  that's  not a proper Linux distro
2009-09-06T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	you would be better off  running  a real Linux distro :)  psyically instaleld on a partation,   or  maybe in a virtual machine, but with Windows as host :(
2009-09-06T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	that  program is a bit like Wine, but the other way round, with a  Linux kernel that has been ported to Windows
2009-09-06T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	also really there isn't anywhere as such that you can go for suppourt for it I think,   except their forum I think they have one
2009-09-06T05:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	You might find Cygwin interesting by the way, but  this channal is only really meant to be for Ubuntu installed
2009-09-06T05:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	that's proper Ubuntu,  not anything that's based on it
2009-09-06T05:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	uh above,   this channal is only really meant to be for getting support for  the real proper Ubuntu
2009-09-06T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	andlinux is not that good,  give a virtual machine a try of Ubuntu,  or even better install it for real onto your hard disk :)
2009-09-06T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Alex___	also when  your running a proper install of Ubuntu,  in a  vm or pysical :)   you  can  get support for it in here
