2009-05-05T00:18:00.000Z	Yanick_		Hi, I just downloaded Amarok and all the restricted codecs (+VLC) and Amarok won't play anything. VLC just play fine, but I'd like to use Amarok :)
2009-05-05T00:18:00.000Z	Yanick_		Ubuntu 9.04
2009-05-05T00:20:00.000Z	Yanick_		anyone managed to make Amarok play anything at all?
2009-05-05T00:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yanick_	yeah  Banshee is great
2009-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	Yanick_		alright then
2009-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yanick_	unless on Ubuntu 8.04 since that had a old version that was rubbish
2009-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	Yanick_		too bad, the interface looked nice :)
2009-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	Yanick_	sebsebseb	nope, 9.04
2009-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	Yanick_		I had 8.04, and it worked great
2009-05-05T00:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yanick_	yep good version of Banshee in the 9.04 repo
2009-05-05T00:23:00.000Z	Yanick_		waa!

2009-05-05T00:23:00.000Z	Yanick_		that's funny
2009-05-05T00:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Yanick_	if you got the codecs installed yeah
2009-05-05T00:23:00.000Z	Yanick_		nice
