2011-03-17T21:05:00.000Z	Jonii^		Anyways, is it really that difficult to fix ubuntu mouse?
2011-03-17T21:05:00.000Z	Jonii^		I'm totally ready to work to get it working again, but I'd at least need pointers as to where to search for more hints
2011-03-17T21:07:00.000Z	Jonii^		Are there any good places where one could expect answers to ubuntu-related questions?
2011-03-17T21:09:00.000Z	Jonii^		<Jonii^> Hey, is there any way to make Ubuntu mouse act a bit more like windows mouse?
2011-03-17T21:09:00.000Z	Jonii^		<Jonii^> Like, not open that damn pop-up menu before I release the right button, _OR_ make right click unable to select menu items
2011-03-17T21:10:00.000Z	Jonii^		<Jonii^> Or, even make it so that pressing right mouse button to open menu, and then releasing it _can't_ select items from the menu list?
2011-03-17T21:10:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	do other distros using gnome/compiz (mis)behave same way?
2011-03-17T21:10:00.000Z	Jonii^	llutz	no idea
2011-03-17T21:10:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	how do you know its a ubuntu fault then?
2011-03-17T21:11:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	maybe you'd better ask in generic gnome-channels
2011-03-17T21:11:00.000Z	Jonii^	llutz	I've also been asking if that's the case. Again, no responses at all
2011-03-17T21:12:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	have you used different window-managers to check the behaviour there?
2011-03-17T21:13:00.000Z	Jonii^	llutz	no idea what are window-managers
2011-03-17T21:13:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	those things managing the windows on your screen
2011-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	i just checked an old kde-3, same action there. so it seems to be a thing of xorg mouse event handling. ask those xorg-devs
2011-03-17T21:14:00.000Z	Jonii^	llutz	ok. Where to ask next?
2011-03-17T21:15:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	no idea, try #xorg-devel as a start
2011-03-17T21:15:00.000Z	llutz_	Jonii^	google should help
