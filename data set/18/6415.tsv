2008-09-16T22:28:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes		so  Ubuntu was installed first on a computer from ISO, then I installed  kubuntu and  KDE4,  but  GDM does not have the entry for  Kubuntu how to add it?
2008-09-16T22:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	on the login screen "change sessions" to kde and you'
2008-09-16T22:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	arg.. which I had the answer for that.. sorry don't
2008-09-17T03:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	that's the way..
2008-09-17T03:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	why do you say the hardy nvidia drivers are broken? for the_zemo I've been using hardy nvidia drivers since they came out and no issues..
2008-09-17T03:32:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	,because I have been trying to help a guy that has  issues with them, plus other people who have had issues have told me
2008-09-17T03:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	that's not definitive enough to say that they are "broken".. maybe it's just the configuration on the other's machines.
2008-09-17T03:33:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	that was slightly wrong,  other people who have had issues with them, have told me that
2008-09-17T03:33:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	 well the first guy had a clean Ubuntu install
2008-09-17T03:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	doesn't matter.. there are other quirks that might throw the monkey wrench into the video.. bad bios needing update etc.. you just don't know.
2008-09-17T03:35:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	 well the guy I am on about basically the bottom of programs never shows on the screen,  and  there are likes sections on the screen showing nothing, and he can only have 800x600 now, where as before the drivers he was able to have a resoloution that worked well. and that's the nivida one from ubuntu as well as the opengl one with envng
2008-09-17T03:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	that's a common problem on some systems.  not the fault of the drivers but the setup on install for some reason. Configuring "X" automatically has always been an issue and isn't quite bullet proof yet.  On some systems it just requires the right person to help with the diagnostics to fix it.
2008-09-17T03:37:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	well I been remote connecting this guy nice and securely VNC with SSH tunneling,  so I can't actasully see the computer myself, but any idea what to do about it?
2008-09-17T03:40:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	 heh of cousre the prompts why didn't I think of that :D    thanks though for that, i'll try that with him
2008-09-17T03:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	np.. good luck.. by the way if he port forwards 5700-5900 to his box you can use Remote Desktop Viewer..
2008-09-17T03:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	 uhmmm he conencts to my SSH,   and  does another command for VNC using localhost.  and I do vncviewer -listen
2008-09-17T03:42:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Scunizi	by the way do you know aything about  3D WIndows games in Linux?   I heard that stuff like Worms 3D will run in Wine for example some how
2008-09-17T03:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	SebNaitsabes	just depends.. if it needs direct x no it won't run
