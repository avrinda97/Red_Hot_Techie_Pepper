2006-08-07T08:44:00.000Z	qwerty2k	fyrestrtr	it doesnt say anything about compiling when i want to use a patch against the source code
2006-08-07T08:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	because patching is not the same as compiling.
2006-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	qwerty2k	fyrestrtr	well do you know how i can go about patching the source before compiling ;)
2006-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr		xgl + dual screens = oohs and aaahs from colleagues
2006-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	patching what?
2006-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	qwerty2k	fyrestrtr	i want to compile wine, however this is a patch for a specific problem in a game i use that  iwant to apply before compiling
2006-08-07T08:47:00.000Z	qwerty2k		*there is
2006-08-07T08:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	cd /wherever/the/wine/source/is -- then cp blahblahblah.diff `pwd` -- then patch -p1 blahblahblah.diff
2006-08-07T08:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	that's patch -p1 < blahblahblah.diff
2006-08-07T08:48:00.000Z	qwerty2k		right :S
2006-08-07T08:49:00.000Z	qwerty2k		i will attempt ;)
2006-08-07T08:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	basic steps 1. extract the source code 2. cd into the top directory of the source code -- for wine, its usually wine-0.version.number 3. copy the patch diff file to this directory 4. type patch -p1 < nameoffile.diff 5. ./configure and etc..
2006-08-07T08:51:00.000Z	qwerty2k	fyrestrtr	thanks, another quick question...i already have latest wine installed, when i compile and install will it overwrite existing one or do  iuninstall current one first etc?
2006-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	uninstall first.
2006-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	qwerty2k	fyrestrtr	another quick question ;), will that remove any programs ive already got installed with current wine? (ie. my home/.wine/ etc directory?
2006-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	qwerty2k	no
2006-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	qwerty2k	fyrestrtr	ah ok, good, thanks for your time/help/patience
