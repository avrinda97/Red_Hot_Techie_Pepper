2011-01-13T23:26:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	hang on, and i'll find you a link to the one i have, plug it in, and connect to a network... no fuss no muss
2011-01-13T23:26:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	cool!
2011-01-13T23:30:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	it's about $20 cheaper here (if you're in the US).. click the "see price in cart"...  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3173666
2011-01-13T23:30:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	thanks! (yes, I'm in the US) I'll check it out right away
2011-01-13T23:31:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	i've never tested it like w/ penetration w/ backtrack.. but it'll connect to open, wep, wpa, wpa2 networks w/o issue.. just plug it in on 10.10, and it picks up and you choose a network
2011-01-13T23:32:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	sounds like it'll suit me fine then
2011-01-13T23:34:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	i will warn you though, if you plan to use it with windows, oddly, it's flaky under windows.  the software that comes w/ the device.. sucks... but thats not an issue w/ ubuntu
2011-01-13T23:35:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	ooo, actually it looks like the chipset in that model has changed over time and the current hardware revision might not have the driver in the kernel
2011-01-13T23:35:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	i can't remember the chipset in the one i have...
2011-01-13T23:35:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_hostif.php?hostif=USB search for f5d8053
2011-01-13T23:36:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	i'm pretty sure its a realtek, not a ralink
2011-01-13T23:40:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	i just checked mine, it looks like i have version 3
2011-01-13T23:40:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	thats all it says on the back...  whatever that means
2011-01-13T23:41:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	yeah, seems that way
2011-01-13T23:43:00.000Z	KM0201	gumpish	you know what, i think i remember when i lsusb'd it... seeing that it wsa the rt2870/2871 chipset.... so i bet it is a ralink
2011-01-13T23:43:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	ah, ok
2011-01-13T23:43:00.000Z	gumpish	KM0201	i'm googling to see if the newer chipset (the realtk) is indeed supported in maverick. thanks for the info
