2005-11-25T07:18:00.000Z	angelp		erusul, "E: The update command takes no arguments
2005-11-25T07:18:00.000Z	angelp		"
2005-11-25T07:20:00.000Z	angelp		ok, erusul, it said 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed...?
2005-11-25T07:20:00.000Z	angelp		what
2005-11-25T07:21:00.000Z	angelp		the website says theres a new one
2005-11-25T07:21:00.000Z	angelp		someone in #gparted told me to upgrade
2005-11-25T07:22:00.000Z	Sanne	angelp	if the website has a new version, it doesn't mean that it's already in Ubuntu's package repositories yet.
2005-11-25T07:22:00.000Z	angelp		sanne, ok, so then how do i install from the ewbsite?
2005-11-25T07:22:00.000Z	angelp	zorba64	no not yet; i dont know how to install anything
2005-11-25T07:24:00.000Z	Sanne	angelp	you would need to compile it from source then, but better others help you with that, because I'm not on Ubuntu yet.
2005-11-25T07:24:00.000Z	angelp		sanne: ok. i have been using windows for 10 years. i don't even know what "compile it from source" means.
2005-11-25T07:25:00.000Z	Sanne	angelp	then I would recommend to not start with this, if you can avoid it.
2005-11-25T07:25:00.000Z	angelp		sanne: so....i'm screwed?
2005-11-25T07:26:00.000Z	Sanne	angelp	why do you need to upgrade the application?
2005-11-25T07:26:00.000Z	angelp		sanne: because it is not working and this guy on #gparted told me to upgrade and see if it worked
2005-11-25T07:27:00.000Z	Sanne	angelp	maybe somebody here who's on Ubuntu could help with your problem your version of the program has now.
