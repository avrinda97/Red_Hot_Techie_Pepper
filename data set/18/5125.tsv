2009-03-01T00:27:00.000Z	eseven73		you're welcome chazco
2009-03-01T00:27:00.000Z	eseven73		no dont use wubi, guntbert is correct get a live cd
2009-03-01T00:29:00.000Z	eseven73		ok i got a question of my own, Im looking for a good backup system that can create compressed archives and automatically burn them to DVD, so far ive only found solutions for backing up to another hdd or tape...
2009-03-01T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	all youd do is run the backup app to create the file, then the next line would be to burn the cd
2009-03-01T00:31:00.000Z	eseven73	ActionParsnip1	assuming i can script
2009-03-01T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	can you use terminal?
2009-03-01T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	then you can script
2009-03-01T00:32:00.000Z	eseven73	ActionParsnip1	bah that's not very helpful advice :(
2009-03-01T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	create a text file with   #!/bin/bash      at the top, then type a list of commands to execute like a program.
2009-03-01T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	then chmod +x the fileand it is a script
2009-03-01T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	thats literally all thereis to it
2009-03-01T00:33:00.000Z	eseven73	ActionParsnip1	ok so what would be the command to put the tar on a dvd?
2009-03-01T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	eseven73	create an iso of the file and you can use cdrecord which will burn a cd at command line
