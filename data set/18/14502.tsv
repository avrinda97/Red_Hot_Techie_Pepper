2005-10-17T15:28:00.000Z	AES_24_96		well do I want to make a separate swap partition on the same disk?
2005-10-17T15:29:00.000Z	AES_24_96		ok Im dual booting btw
2005-10-17T15:29:00.000Z	AES_24_96		ok I dont wasnt to screw up the other two partitions
2005-10-17T15:31:00.000Z	AES_24_96		ok
2005-10-17T15:31:00.000Z	AES_24_96		now Im going to go retard basic, so Ill be back in a sec
2005-10-17T15:33:00.000Z	AES_24_96		I am supposed to be testing with two RME HDSP 9652's under something called "jack"
2005-10-17T15:33:00.000Z	AES_24_96		ahhh
2005-10-17T15:33:00.000Z	AES_24_96		I know nothing of linnux
2005-10-17T15:34:00.000Z	AES_24_96		was just asking ahead of time if it was an identical card asraniel was having problems with
2005-10-17T15:35:00.000Z	AES_24_96		ahhh
2005-10-17T15:36:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	Yetr2: for a normal user I always just say make one big partition.  these days hard disks just tend to fail totally
2005-10-17T15:36:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	Yetr2: I haven't recently seen just a partition die.  filesystem corruption just doesn't happen much anymore
2005-10-17T15:36:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	you could, but don't
2005-10-17T15:37:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	I personally always do:  10MB /boot, 128MB /swap, rest /
2005-10-17T15:39:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	nope. primary is primary
2005-10-17T15:44:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	you only have 4 primaries
2005-10-17T15:44:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	if you don't think you'll need more than that, make them all primary
2005-10-17T15:45:00.000Z	JohnFlux	AES_24_96	to be safe I always make 3 primary then the 4th extended if I need to
