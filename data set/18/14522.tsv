2006-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	hou5ton		Does anyone know what the magic component is that is needed to play video clips on Fox?  My Edgy system plays them on CNN, YouTube, and even MSNBC. But on Fox, I only get sound.  I've went through all the help docs I can find ....??
2006-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	maybe it is in wmv9 format...
2006-11-26T15:20:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  hmmmm..... ok ... what else do I need.  I mean.... I can even play videos on MSNBC
2006-11-26T15:20:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  and normally those won'[t work except in IED
2006-11-26T15:20:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	if it is the latest windows video codec there are no support as far as I know
2006-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  can you play the Dennis Miller video at the top right of this page:  http://www.foxnews.com/
2006-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	i can check. hang on
2006-11-26T15:22:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	requires a plugin. which one i have no idea. I get a blank (well, golden actually) screen.
2006-11-26T15:23:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  yep .... same screen I got
2006-11-26T15:23:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  What about RealPlayer?
2006-11-26T15:23:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  I wonder if it would play it?
2006-11-26T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	if you click on the help icon at the bottom of page you will see that it requires WMP 9 or higher. no realplayer requirement at all.
2006-11-26T15:25:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  Thanks .... I hadn't done that, obviously ...
2006-11-26T15:25:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  Does anything on linux play that?
2006-11-26T15:25:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	no probs
2006-11-26T15:36:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  I opened the same Fox video in IE on Edgy, and it shows the video, but it is blinking very rapidly
2006-11-26T15:37:00.000Z	Jowi	hou5ton	ok. I still have no idea what you need :)
2006-11-26T15:37:00.000Z	hou5ton	Jowi	  I'm finding a little information on the web regarding WMP9 and 10, but nothing yet to solve the problem
