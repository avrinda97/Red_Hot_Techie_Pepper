2008-07-12T15:43:00.000Z	rubydiamond		How do I change my MBR using Ubuntu?
2008-07-12T15:44:00.000Z	rubydiamond		I am going to delete my windows partiotion
2008-07-12T15:44:00.000Z	rubydiamond		will I lose my windows partition?
2008-07-12T15:44:00.000Z	ay^	rubydiamond	well.. yes?

2008-07-12T15:45:00.000Z	rubydiamond	ay^	I want to change my mbr to Ubuntu partition?
2008-07-12T15:45:00.000Z	rubydiamond		Shujah,
2008-07-12T15:45:00.000Z	rubydiamond		hmm
2008-07-12T15:45:00.000Z	ay^	rubydiamond	well its not the same thing to change the mbr and to delete a partition
2008-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	rubydiamond		which software under ubuntu will help me to do that
2008-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	ay^	rubydiamond	but changing the mbr will not delete your windows partition, thoit MIGHT if used incorrectly make it, inaccesible, until you fix the boot
2008-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	rubydiamond	ay^	but I think .. my mbr is on windows partition
2008-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	rubydiamond		and if I delete it.. I will not able to boot
2008-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	ay^	rubydiamond	well you replace it, so the other boot-load will kick in
2008-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	ay^	rubydiamond	and such apps are grub or lilo
2008-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	rubydiamond	ay^	which software ables to change my grub or lilo
2008-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	ay^	rubydiamond	well.. grub and lilo :)
