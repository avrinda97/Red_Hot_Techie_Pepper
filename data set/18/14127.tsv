2008-02-15T10:43:00.000Z	[dcr]		Excuse me, is there any way I can possibly get some help playing Guild Wars on Linux?
2008-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	[dcr]		I am using the latest version of Wine
2008-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	[dcr]		I installed it and everything
2008-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	[dcr]		But when I go to run the game, it goes to the loading screen, loads 100% than closes, followed by Wine closing
2008-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	You might get better help in #winehq
2008-02-15T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	What are you trying to look at?
2008-02-15T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	You don't need sudo for that, if you'r at the terminal, make sure you use -a, in nautilus, make sure you show hidden files (ctrl-h)
2008-02-15T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	no.  While in nautilus, hit ctrl-h
2008-02-15T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	and, close the one that's been sudod.
2008-02-15T11:05:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	Have you run wine or winecfg yet?
2008-02-15T11:05:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	what does (in terminal), `ls -al ~ | grep wine` give you?
2008-02-15T11:06:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	That definately shouldn't say no file or directory.
2008-02-15T11:06:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	If that says no file or directory, you have bigger issues.
2008-02-15T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	Like ~ is no longer aliased to your home directory
2008-02-15T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	Are you sure `ls -al ~/ | grep wine` gives you no file or directory?
2008-02-15T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	I'd like that, actually.
2008-02-15T11:11:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	No, ditch the quotes entirely.
2008-02-15T11:11:00.000Z	Flannel	[dcr]	Exactly.  There's your wine directory.  On the same token, you should be able to see it in nautilus
