2007-12-14T21:33:00.000Z	freeteebee		hello i have the following problem, i deleted my partition table and recovered it with testdisk however testdisk maked my linux partition as ext2 and not ext3 anybody up for some help?
2007-12-14T21:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	use fdisk to change the system lavel
2007-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	have you used fdisk or cfdisk to change partition type?
2007-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	yes but the partition type was already Linux
2007-12-14T22:10:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	should i try it anyways again
2007-12-14T22:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	dunno... i do not know how testdisk works... but you can convert and etx2 fs to ext3 easily
2007-12-14T22:11:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	but i do not want to lose my data

2007-12-14T22:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	you can convert between the two without loosing data. In linux we take backwards compat seriusly ;)
2007-12-14T22:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	have you checjed the partitions with fsck or similar tool?
2007-12-14T22:24:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	no not yet
2007-12-14T22:31:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	i tryed fsck but i got The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 ... even tough i mounted the partition as ext3
2007-12-14T22:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	the fsck should be done on the unmounted filesystem (from livecd for example)
2007-12-14T22:32:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	also and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
2007-12-14T22:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	yes if it doesn't find the superblock you may want to try with fsck -b 32768
2007-12-14T22:36:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	ok now fsck worked and returns a semly endless list of errors
2007-12-14T22:37:00.000Z	freeteebee	erUSUL	i pressed yes to a lot of them, hopefully this eill not delete anything??? *scared*
2007-12-14T22:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	freeteebee	i honestly dunno :| never been on the situation of lost the partitions of my hd
