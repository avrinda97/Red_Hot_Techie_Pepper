2011-01-23T00:35:00.000Z	kanusss		hello
2011-01-23T00:36:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	What do you mean view partitions? Where are you trying to get to?
2011-01-23T00:42:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Why do you want to view partitions? Maybe we can help you find out some more?
2011-01-23T00:43:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Click places and choose either Home Folder OR Compute
2011-01-23T00:44:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	In more detail.. Places(You can find this on the top left of your screen) -> Computer -> Filesystem -> /home    (This is sda3)
2011-01-23T00:45:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Please use pastebin instead of puting it here.
2011-01-23T00:46:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Please use http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/   and give us a link :)
2011-01-23T00:48:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Please note du -shc shows disk USAGE, not free space, check space left with "df -h"
2011-01-23T00:50:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	I said df not du
2011-01-23T00:52:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Please pastebin that hurst to read, but all your space IS there, and very little is used.
2011-01-23T00:54:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Yes, your /home and / are using the SAME space.
2011-01-23T00:56:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	From a technical standpoint. sda3 is the first usable extended parition for a system. This is done so that in the event you want to install say.. Windows you can do so without too much mass interruption.
2011-01-23T00:56:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	As for putting everything in sda3 instead of splitting it up, it give you more useable space instead of seperating system VS personal
2011-01-23T00:59:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	sda1 is the only place windows will install into.
2011-01-23T00:59:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	MBR is inside sda (no numbers) and isn't normally reachable in a filemanager.
2011-01-23T01:01:00.000Z	Diamondcite	kanusss	Everything your system resides in sda3. GRUB isn't inside the MBR, instead the MBR points to where grub is stored.
