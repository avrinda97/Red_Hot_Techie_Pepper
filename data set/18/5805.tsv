2008-09-09T04:24:00.000Z	Osse		Is there a possibility to change the default internal-browser? (nautilus)?
2008-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	it's possible, but very painful. If you don't like nautilus, you may as well switch away from gnome. Have you tried KDE and Xfce?
2008-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- No, never tried any of them.
2008-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	you can get a full alternative environment with apps installed with 'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop' (for KDE)
2008-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	for Xfce, substitute xubuntu-desktop
2008-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- How would this effect my current installation?
2008-09-09T04:27:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	not at all, provided you have enough disk space. You will be able to choose the environment each time you log in.
2008-09-09T04:28:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- Oh, well. What are the diffrances?
2008-09-09T04:29:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	Xfce is lighter and thus better for lower-end machines, sacrificing some convenience. KDE offers more tweaks and some would say it's closer to Windows designwise.
2008-09-09T04:30:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	the difference is best experienced, though. Alternatively, see if you can get an impression from Youtube videos
2008-09-09T04:30:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- Well, it sounds like I'm good with Gnome i think, I just wanted to check if there was a possibility to change it, to try others. I know there are some good.
2008-09-09T04:31:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	you can try some in parallel with nautilus. Really replacing, ie. removing nautilus will break a lot of things, though
2008-09-09T04:32:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- Sounds like I'm not really ready to try that, heh.
2008-09-09T04:33:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	are you any good on the command line? If you're at all technically inclined, you'll still fare much better with that than with graphical file management.
2008-09-09T04:34:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- Well, I do handle alot of stuff through the terminal, but I prefer a simple GUI controlled one.
2008-09-09T04:34:00.000Z	soundray	Osse	you find nautilus too complex?
2008-09-09T04:35:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- Well, I'm trying out some alternatives right now, I find PCMan File manager quite okay.
2008-09-09T04:35:00.000Z	Osse	soundray	- I like the tabbing features and the customization feats.
