2008-05-24T22:08:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Hello? I'm getting ready to move my Wubi install to its own partition. I've been deleting stuff from my 134GB data partition in preparation. It has 28% of its space free now, and I've defragmented it several times. But I can't get data to move away from the end of the partition. Is it safe to resize the partition anyway?

2008-05-24T22:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	[TiZ]	Read the faq on the wubi wiki, moving that lvm wubi install may be a problem....  I would rather see you go into ubuntu, and save your /home to a usb
2008-05-24T22:21:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Jack_Sparrow	why?
2008-05-24T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	[TiZ]	Do you have any backup of ubuntu?
2008-05-24T22:23:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Jack_Sparrow	no, not right now. My iPod's battery is dead, and until it comes back, I've nowhere to back it up.
2008-05-24T22:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	[TiZ]	I would suggest that be your priority
2008-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	[TiZ]	I wont use or recommend wubi, but since you have, I suggest you read the faq and learn all you can about what it is and how to deal with it
2008-05-24T22:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	[TiZ]	If you are talking about using windows to burn the wubi install.. I think you are asking for trouble

2008-05-24T22:26:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Jack_Sparrow	please tell me why you think it's a bad idea.

2009-01-04T05:16:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Jack_Sparrow	Well, I tried to install a driver using ndisgtk. Ndisgtk then froze up. I force quitted it, and now both ndisgtk and ndiswrapper -l just freeze.
