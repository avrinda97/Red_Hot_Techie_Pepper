2004-11-02T10:27:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		OK, i've just installed the wonderful magicly awesome ubuntu, although i don't see how such a short name could actually mean `I am what I am because of who we all are' in `ancient African', but it's great nonetheless
2004-11-02T10:28:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		but there's a snag, you see
2004-11-02T10:28:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		i can't play my videos because i can't get w32codecs
2004-11-02T10:28:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		i can't get them, so get them? that doesn't even make sense
2004-11-02T10:28:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	you need to use the marillat repo, or get them by hand from mplayerhq.hu
2004-11-02T10:29:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	have a ook at the wiki link
2004-11-02T10:30:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	xvid is in the w32codecs pack?
2004-11-02T10:32:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	debian makes it much easier to get patent encumbered packages then most other distributions i've tried, except suse and mandrake
2004-11-02T10:34:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	jgeorgeson	debian-installer never asked me that
2004-11-02T10:36:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	might have been the old installer
2004-11-02T10:36:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	jgeorgeson	i used RC1 and pre-RC2 installers, those are the newest ones (only ones, too)
2004-11-02T10:50:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	it should remove toten-gstreamer but not ubuntu-desktop
2004-11-02T10:50:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	jgeorgeson	it isn't so
2004-11-02T10:53:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	i would imagine it's a philosophical 'avoid patented stuff' thing
2004-11-02T10:54:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	jgeorgeson	well, you could be right, but in debian, they require things like patent-free | paten-encumbered sometimes, even if you have to add non-free repo in order to get it
2004-11-02T10:55:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	hence my earlier statement that debian makes it easier than other distros
2004-11-02T10:58:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	KazeNoBokusha	who would get sued? debian is a network of volunteers?
2004-11-02T10:58:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	jgeorgeson	ah, good point
