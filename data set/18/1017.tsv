2011-07-03T06:58:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		I have an asus m4a88t-m/usb3.0 board how do I check to make sure the correct drivers are installed for the soundcard to support the HD Audio because I have it going to my surround sound and it sounds like shit all crackly
2011-07-03T07:00:00.000Z	szal	Teslasneeze	sound drivers are in the kernel, so there's hardly anything you can do about it
2011-07-03T07:00:00.000Z	Teslasneeze	szal	grewat
2011-07-03T07:00:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		great*
2011-07-03T07:01:00.000Z	szal	Teslasneeze	and, fwiw, the ASUS M4N line (in my case, an M4N68T) work no problem
2011-07-03T07:01:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		fwiw?
2011-07-03T07:01:00.000Z	szal		though I can only run the HD audio device in legacy AC97 mode because my case has no proper HD connectors
2011-07-03T07:02:00.000Z	Teslasneeze	szal	sound sounds fine when I have it set to go through the vc hdmi and comeo ut the tv speakers
2011-07-03T07:02:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		but if it's on the setting for the sdcard and for sound to come out through the surround sound, it sounds like shit
2011-07-03T07:06:00.000Z	szal	Teslasneeze	does sound work ok from live CD?
2011-07-03T07:09:00.000Z	Teslasneeze	szal	depends on how I play it
2011-07-03T07:10:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		I have two options in hardware internal audio and juniper hdmi audio
2011-07-03T07:10:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		juniper hdmi audio plays perfect which comes through the HDTV
2011-07-03T07:10:00.000Z	Teslasneeze		Internal Audio is all jacked up
2011-07-03T07:12:00.000Z	Teslasneeze	szal	the internal audio is plugged into the home theatre systems reciever
2011-07-03T07:12:00.000Z	szal	Teslasneeze	that shouldn't make a difference, you could also just hook up a pair of headphones
2011-07-03T07:14:00.000Z	szal		!upgrade | dimas_
2011-07-03T07:14:00.000Z	Teslasneeze	szal	that would defeat the whole purpose of playing music through the surround sound
