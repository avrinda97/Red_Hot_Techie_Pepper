2010-10-15T12:13:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	If you want 7-Zip compression do: sudo apt-get install p7zip
2010-10-15T12:25:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	Are you openeing a rar or making one?
2010-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	ubuXubu	UbuntuNewbie	i downloaded a rar file and now i want to burn it to a cd...its not working out so i assume i need to unrar it 1st
2010-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	You can double click on a rar file to open it.
2010-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	Do you want to put the rar on a cd? or do you want to extract what's inside the rar first?
2010-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	Double click on the rar to open it and see what files are inside. A rar is just like a zip file.
2010-10-15T12:36:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	When you see the files that were inside of it. Is it a disc image you are trying to burn?
2010-10-15T12:37:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	If it's just data you can copy the files you want onto a cd. If theres an ISO or IMG file it's an image of a disc and is burned differently.
2010-10-15T12:39:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	do you know about zip files and how they work?
2010-10-15T12:44:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	If it's an ISO then it will be burned like an iso. everything else is just data and can be copied to a disc.
2010-10-15T12:47:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	Yeah that's a data cd.
2010-10-15T12:48:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	All you need to know is an If it's an ISO,IMG,CUE, or bin file then you tell Brassero to burn an image file. Everything else is a data file.
2010-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	ubuXubu	After you extracted the rar what files came out of it?
