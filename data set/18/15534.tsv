2005-03-07T07:31:00.000Z	stephenb		Hi Guys, i have a fresh ubintu install, and i must say its really nice :) but i have a problem ... i want to start Synaptic to see what tools are installed, can be updatet.. so i start the tool. but after the password entry synatpic dosnt start :(  ? someone have a reason ?
2005-03-07T07:32:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	you typed your password?
2005-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	yes the password for my user ... ubuntu dosent have a root ... form start ... must i set a root pw ?
2005-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	wouldn't do much good if you did... Synaptic starts via 'gksudo synaptic'  ;)
2005-03-07T07:35:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	when i try to start it per sudo this come up in the consol : steve-u is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2005-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	ahh... you are using the user you created at install time? cuz if so, thats bad
2005-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	easily fixed though... boot into rescue mode, and add yourself to /etc/sudoers
2005-03-07T07:37:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	oh i think a have a reason :D i added a new user why the install user / steve /  link at the homedir form my debian install  /home/steve   and ubuntu take the desktops settings form the .. thats why a made i new user calls > steve-u
2005-03-07T07:39:00.000Z	stephenb		kann i change the login  user at the console ? when i try exit to login at a new user the window close .
2005-03-07T07:39:00.000Z	stephenb		kann = can :)
2005-03-07T07:40:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	yes
2005-03-07T07:40:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	but you will still need to log out and back in for changes to take effect in GUI
2005-03-07T07:41:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	the way is ?  logout not take an effect
2005-03-07T07:41:00.000Z	lunitik	stephenb	ctrl+alt+f1...
2005-03-07T07:42:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	"autch" i forgot! i try it  at the desktop console ....  thx
2005-03-07T07:46:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	i go to tty1 and log in at the install user (steve), but when i try visudo, i get an visudo: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied too!
2005-03-07T07:46:00.000Z	stephenb		
2005-03-07T08:00:00.000Z	stephenb	lunitik	i added the user steve-u now to all groups ( first )! > lugout - login as steve - change groups for steve-u - logout - login as steve - but still the same no sudo... must i reboot for a effect ?
