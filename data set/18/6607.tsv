2008-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	Zloog	corbett	I think you have accidentally deleted your E:/ drive :(
2008-04-25T12:54:00.000Z	corbett	Zloog	well , the light is flashing on the ehd,  dmesg mentions it,  i can assure you it works as it took into work and use on the work pc

2008-04-25T12:55:00.000Z	Zloog	corbett	is this an external drive or something?
2008-04-25T12:55:00.000Z	corbett	Zloog	its an external hard drive maxtor mini iii , usb
2008-04-25T12:57:00.000Z	corbett	Zloog	having said that to get it working on windows I've previously  had to download software from the Seagate site
2008-04-25T12:58:00.000Z	Zloog	corbett	huh, it is is a regular usb drive and your usb port is working, the drive should appear at computer:///
