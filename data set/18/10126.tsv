2007-01-14T16:45:00.000Z	tscherno		i activated XDMPC, but i cant connect, and nmap shows that XDMPC Port is still closed
2007-01-14T16:46:00.000Z	tscherno		i activated XDMPC, but i cant connect, and nmap shows that XDMPC Port is still closed
2007-01-14T16:47:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	you might need... there's like three options you need to check to enable XDMCP, one of them is "allow remote X logins" and a few others.  Poke around the login screen setup for any you mightve missed
2007-01-14T16:47:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	I activated everything possible
2007-01-14T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	which version of ubuntu you running?
2007-01-14T16:51:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	6.10
2007-01-14T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	have you gone to System > Administration, security tab, and enabled it there?
2007-01-14T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	er, Remote tab, i guess, in edgy.
2007-01-14T16:53:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	Yeah, Remote Desktop... everything enabled
2007-01-14T16:53:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	but i think thats VNC Server anyway
2007-01-14T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	no, that's XDMCP, or at least, from what Ive gathered from google.  Sorry,I haven't had a gUI since breezy ;)  configuration has changed since then.  You also enabled the stuff in the Login Screen Setup?
2007-01-14T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	oh, um, have you restarted X since changing these?
2007-01-14T16:55:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	Yes, but I think i got it know
2007-01-14T16:56:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	I edited gdm-custom.conf, but it was still disabled in gdm.conf
2007-01-14T16:56:00.000Z	Flannel	tscherno	interesting
2007-01-14T16:57:00.000Z	tscherno	Flannel	thx for the help
