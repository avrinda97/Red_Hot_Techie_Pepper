2009-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	infidel2		is there a way to split a screen in half in gnome, to fake dual-monitors on a laptop?
2009-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	mcurran	infidel2	- Do you have a key for it?
2009-11-21T02:35:00.000Z	infidel2	mcurran	?
2009-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	mcurran		what's a command to compile an app from source
2009-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	mcurran		make, make install, etc..
2009-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	mcurran		can you go any simpler than that though
2009-11-21T02:37:00.000Z	mcurran		yes, but is there a way to do it like CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=2 fakeroot debian/rules ...  etc.
2009-11-21T02:39:00.000Z	mcurran		So ubuntu supports wimax now?
2009-11-21T02:40:00.000Z	mcurran		I was wondering if there was a way to just compile and install from source, when there is no make or configure files
2009-11-21T02:41:00.000Z	mcurran		So you can't just compile source like you can the linux kernel then...
2009-11-21T02:43:00.000Z	mcurran		iceroot, I'm talking hypothetically, that's why i'm not interested in the developers notes, install file, etc.  I was thinking maybe just using build-essential.
2009-11-21T02:44:00.000Z	mcurran		thanks guys, this install package looks pretty useful.
2009-11-21T03:54:00.000Z	mcurran		skype maybe
2009-11-21T03:54:00.000Z	infidel2		i'm trying to install the latest deb package for anki but it keeps telling me that it depends on python-sip4-dev and few other packages that arent installed. but running 'sudo apt-get -f install' just says it wants to install a couple other packages but remove anki and to run apt-get autoremove and i do that and it just goes in a circle. what can i do?
2009-11-21T03:55:00.000Z	mcurran		did you try apt-get install -f
2009-11-21T03:55:00.000Z	infidel2		yes i just said i did :p
2009-11-21T03:55:00.000Z	mcurran		restartx and try again
2009-11-21T03:56:00.000Z	infidel2	mcurran	what does it have to do with x?
