2006-02-20T15:43:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	i'm using the xorg packages in the breezy/main repo
2006-02-20T15:44:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	well, i haven't tried that so I can't comment on it
2006-02-21T09:05:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	you can point your browser to the URL for any of the specified mirrors

2006-02-23T13:49:00.000Z	b1ind	fangorious	the panel is now unresponsive
2006-02-23T13:50:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	you can look at the "Current Session" and "Startup Programs" tabs to see if there's an extra panel creeping around in there
2006-02-23T13:51:00.000Z	b1ind	fangorious	i've got that dialog up, but to no avail
2006-02-23T13:51:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	can you use <ctrl><alt>backspace to kill your session?
2006-02-23T13:51:00.000Z	b1ind	fangorious	tried it already
2006-02-23T13:52:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	hm, so there's only one panel process listed in the "Current Session" tab?
2006-02-23T13:52:00.000Z	b1ind	fangorious	yes
2006-02-23T13:53:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	have you tried creating a fresh new user account?
2006-02-23T13:53:00.000Z	b1ind	fangorious	no, i came here wondering if it was a common problem
2006-02-23T13:54:00.000Z	b1ind	fangorious	for now, i'm gonna google a bit.. but thx
2006-02-23T13:54:00.000Z	fangorious	b1ind	sorry I couldn't do more
