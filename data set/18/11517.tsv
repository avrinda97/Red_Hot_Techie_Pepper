2006-07-24T08:45:00.000Z	kintaro0e		hello everyone...i need advice..i need to setup a file server..currently i have production server which is on the public network, and i have clients on a private network..do i need to install samba?does the private network can get and store files on it?
2006-07-24T08:47:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	depends on what you want. if you want windows clients to be able to access it, then yes, you need samba.
2006-07-24T08:48:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	even my server is on public network?hehehe..if yes..are there any configurations that i need to make the private network could use it?or just the configurations of samba
2006-07-24T08:50:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	just block out the public ip. just configure samba correctly. if you're using a firewall, make sure you have the firewall configured properly too.
2006-07-24T08:51:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	what do you mean by just block out the public ip? :P
2006-07-24T08:52:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	don't allow the rest of the internet to get to your file server.
2006-07-24T08:53:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	ah.ok..thanks..i'll just pm you if i'm on the right path..,is it ok.hehee
2006-07-24T08:54:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	something like socket address = 192.168.0.0/24 in smb.conf will restrict it to that network i think. firewall would work too.
2006-07-24T08:54:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	oops, sorry. it's socket address = $ip_of_private_interface
2006-07-24T08:55:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	ah..ok..thanks
2006-07-24T08:56:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	btw..is it safe to put it on the public? if its not.any alternatives like ftp server?
2006-07-25T12:14:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	do you have any idea on this problem?
2006-07-25T12:18:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	no idea. haven't used vmware in a long time.
2006-07-25T12:19:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	its ok..hehehe
2006-07-25T12:19:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	why use vmware? maybe qemu is enough to do the job. :)
2006-07-25T12:20:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	its for windows client os..
2006-07-25T12:20:00.000Z	Terminus	kintaro0e	i have a deb of the latest version here if you want. the accelerator i have is optimized for the k7 kernel only though so you might have to build your own.
2006-07-25T12:21:00.000Z	kintaro0e	Terminus	will its ok..they like to use on vmware..
