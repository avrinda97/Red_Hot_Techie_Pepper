2009-02-17T21:11:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	where are your files stored
2009-02-17T21:12:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	what folder
2009-02-17T21:13:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	so you don't have permissions to do anything to the files in your home folder?
2009-02-17T21:13:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	but not save changes?
2009-02-17T21:15:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	go to Places -> Computer
2009-02-17T21:15:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	let me know when your there
2009-02-17T21:15:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	ok
2009-02-17T21:15:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	now double click filesystem
2009-02-17T21:16:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	then double click the folder called 'home'
2009-02-17T21:16:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	do you see a folder there with your username?
2009-02-17T21:17:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	right click it, and select properties
2009-02-17T21:17:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	click the permissions tab
2009-02-17T21:18:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	make sure the top where is says owner you can 'create and delete folders' and 'read and write' files
2009-02-17T21:18:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	then click 'apply permissions to enclose files' at the bottom
2009-02-17T21:19:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	now try to edit your files
2009-02-17T21:20:00.000Z	ptn107	jj193	no prob
