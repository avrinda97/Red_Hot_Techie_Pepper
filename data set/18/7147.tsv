2008-04-25T22:48:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	its a constant 5 to 50% between the 4 cpu's, they jump back and forth
2008-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	go to the processes tab, click view -> all processes, and sort by CPU column.
2008-04-25T22:56:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	Xorg is using 43 to 51% cpu, is that normal
2008-04-25T22:57:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	i dont think it is
2008-04-25T22:57:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	no it isn't. have you tried restarting the X server? (ctrl alt backspace)
2008-04-25T22:57:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	no, but i will, brb
2008-04-25T23:01:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	same thing
2008-04-25T23:01:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	doing anything impressivly kick-ass to X? like, I don't know, several graphs or moving graphics, etc
2008-04-25T23:03:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	well, i was watching the moving graph in system monitor, i just switched to a different tab and it dropped off
2008-04-25T23:03:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	the graph eats CPU  :P
2008-04-25T23:04:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	im stunned that it was that much though
2008-04-25T23:04:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	depends on hwo big the graph is. I know it eats half of mine when I maximize the window
2008-04-25T23:06:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	check it out http://howtolinux.us/screenshots/Screenshot.png
2008-04-25T23:06:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	all I can say is ouch  ;)
2008-04-25T23:07:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	i saw that graph and was like, what the heck, and the processes tab wasnt matching up
2008-04-25T23:07:00.000Z	Lapinux	mut80r	thanks for the help
2008-04-25T23:07:00.000Z	mut80r	Lapinux	no problem
