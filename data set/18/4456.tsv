2009-04-08T00:42:00.000Z	n8tuser	mib_wbho696i	-> read again, there may be instructions there how to load your driver
2009-04-08T00:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	mib_wbho696i	-> or you may google for how to load AR242 drivers
2009-04-08T00:45:00.000Z	mib_wbho696i	n8tuser	i will try google again, the problem is i already have the tutorial for it to work again but the site is down so when i go "wget {url of download}" the site is not avaliable

2009-04-08T00:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	mib_wbho696i	-> look for your ath9k or ath5k driver to see if those will work instead of madwifi

2009-04-08T01:03:00.000Z	n8tuser	mib_wbho696i	-> then try to use that ath5k
2009-04-08T01:03:00.000Z	n8tuser	mib_wbho696i	-> or you may even google for why ath5k may replace ath9k or vice versa
