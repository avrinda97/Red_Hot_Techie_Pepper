2009-01-12T14:18:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	 no idea ...can rhytmbox place some music in a custom folder? ...then you could use rsync :P
2009-01-12T14:19:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	(keep 2 fodlers in sync)
2009-01-12T14:19:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	possibly
2009-01-12T14:20:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	then it would work both ways ... you recorded some new awesome music int he studio ..got it on your key ... sync ...now you got it in rhytm
2009-01-12T14:22:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	though it lacks in the ability to sync only a certain playlist, i think
2009-01-12T14:22:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	lacks lot of stuff, not really a solution - just a hack :P
2009-01-12T14:23:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	how are plyalists stored? ..could you parse it ? ;-)
2009-01-12T14:23:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	I mean..is it just a bunch of text? :)
2009-01-12T14:23:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	I think it's in rhyhtmbox's DB until you export.
2009-01-12T14:24:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	which could be parsed...and parse to rsync? ;-)
2009-01-12T14:24:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	just need a way to automate playlist export, then
2009-01-12T14:25:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	is there a CLI interface to rhytmbox?
2009-01-12T14:25:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	yes
2009-01-12T14:25:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	hehe ..wont be pretty - but sounds doable
2009-01-12T14:26:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	but there's no playlist export on it
2009-01-12T14:26:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	rhythmbox-client --print-playing ...will print the current songs ... humm..maybe not
2009-01-12T14:27:00.000Z	_Cid	Artanis00	 oh well, i tried - I need a few minutes to heat up a bottle for the little one, brb ;-)
2009-01-12T14:27:00.000Z	Artanis00	_Cid	thanks for your help
