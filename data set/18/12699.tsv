2006-03-18T15:12:00.000Z	maxim_		does anyone know howto autoload a module at boot using --force-vermagic in breezy?
2006-03-18T15:14:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	Might have something to do with /etc/modprobe.d
2006-03-18T15:14:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	Never had to use it myself, but check some of the files in there for examples, and write your own file to pass --force-vermagic or whatever to the modprobe command.
2006-03-18T15:15:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	k thanks, will look into that
2006-03-18T15:15:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	a local.start file would have been handy since you can just put the complete command in there like ' modprobe --force-vermagic fglrx '
2006-03-18T15:16:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	oh well
2006-03-18T15:16:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	The modprobe.d directory is slightly more complex, but you should be able to accomplish the same stuff without mucking about with /etc/init.d and /etc/rc?.d symlinks.
2006-03-18T15:18:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	diving into it right now
2006-03-18T15:21:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	fixed it with a crontab and @reboot
2006-03-18T15:21:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	easier :)
2006-03-18T15:22:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	A crontab?? Why would you need that?
2006-03-18T15:22:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	load the module at boot
2006-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	not quite what it was meant for, but an easier fix than messing with modprobe files i haven't time to figure out :)
2006-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	Right... so you just put in the --force-vermagic in the crontab entry.
2006-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	yeah
2006-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	Whatever works ;)
2006-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	maxim_	silvaran	right :) later and thanks again!
2006-03-18T15:24:00.000Z	silvaran	maxim_	np, later
