2010-01-19T20:08:00.000Z	LuciusMare_		startx tells me i am not authorized and xauth list does not output anything

2010-01-19T20:11:00.000Z	LuciusMare_		x
2010-01-19T20:11:00.000Z	Darael	LuciusMare_	So start ?dm rather than restarting it!
2010-01-19T20:12:00.000Z	Darael	LuciusMare_	In that case, have you tried booting in recovery mode and using the xfix option?
2010-01-19T20:12:00.000Z	LuciusMare_	Darael	not yet, my only problem now is with x authorization
2010-01-19T20:14:00.000Z	Darael	LuciusMare_	All you've actually told us is that you're having a problem with x authorisation, and can't start X - more info would be helpful.
2010-01-19T20:32:00.000Z	Darael	LuciusMare_	If KDM is already running, I'm assuming you've tried switching to where X ought to be (usually ctrl+alt+f7, sometimes on ctrl+alt+f8 instead)?
2010-01-19T20:32:00.000Z	LuciusMare_	Darael	you are assuming right
2010-01-19T20:33:00.000Z	LuciusMare_	Darael	and, even if it would be running, i still need to solve the problem i cant run it manually
2010-01-19T21:22:00.000Z	Darael	LuciusMare_	You'll want to stop it (as root) and try starting it again?
