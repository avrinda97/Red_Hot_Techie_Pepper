2008-04-12T04:50:00.000Z	windio00		what are the minimum requirements for 8.04?  its an old computer
2008-04-12T04:50:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	go for xubuntu :)
2008-04-12T04:50:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	256mb ram i think
2008-04-12T04:50:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	thats what it has . . .
2008-04-12T04:51:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	it might just work ;)
2008-04-12T04:51:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	otherwise you might have to use the minicd and install ubuntu using the packages you want to (for example fluxbox instead of any other window manager)
2008-04-12T04:55:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	should i install the beta or is there a daily update of xubuntu?
2008-04-12T04:55:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	hm, wait until 8.04 is realesed, which is in a week or 2.
2008-04-12T04:56:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	yeah im going on 3 week trip and wanted to get it installed before i go
2008-04-12T04:57:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	ah, is it a laptop?
2008-04-12T04:58:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	how big is the hdd?
2008-04-12T04:58:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	nah its for a family that needs something that works while im gone
2008-04-12T04:58:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	i dont think more than 10 or 20 gb
2008-04-12T04:59:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	you can have partition mounted at / which is 6-10gb large, and the rest on /home. and then install 7.10 and then 8.04 when you come back, and not touching the /home partition
2008-04-12T05:02:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	is 8.04 raelly that unstable right now 2 weeks before?
2008-04-12T05:02:00.000Z	sveakex	windio00	you can also install that an reinstall
2008-04-12T05:03:00.000Z	windio00	sveakex	if i install 8.04 beta there is at least a chance that it would switch over ok to 8.04 stable right?
