2005-04-26T13:33:00.000Z	GnuKemist		goldfish IBM X40...
2005-04-26T13:34:00.000Z	GnuKemist		goldfish any clue?
2005-04-26T13:34:00.000Z	GnuKemist		goldfish nope... supposed to be compatible
2005-04-26T13:35:00.000Z	GnuKemist		does anybody know what version of ipw2200 driver Hoary has?  I'm not at my laptop now
2005-04-26T13:36:00.000Z	GnuKemist		goldfish yup... but it seems to me most people had to download the drivers...
2005-04-26T13:36:00.000Z	GnuKemist		I wonder if it is "safe" to have a hybrid system like that
2005-04-26T13:37:00.000Z	GnuKemist		goldfish the driver is included in Hoary
2005-04-26T13:37:00.000Z	GnuKemist		goldfish so I didn't
2005-04-26T13:38:00.000Z	ogra	GnuKemist	nope, its not safe....the selfcompiled stuff gets overwritten...
2005-04-26T13:39:00.000Z	GnuKemist	ogra	that's what I thought...  I got the source code but didn't compile yet
2005-04-26T13:39:00.000Z	ogra	GnuKemist	you'll have to compile it again on every security update
2005-04-26T13:40:00.000Z	ogra	GnuKemist	did you have problems with the driver ?
2005-04-26T13:40:00.000Z	GnuKemist	ogra	gotcha... definitely don't feel like doing that ;)
2005-04-26T13:40:00.000Z	GnuKemist	ogra	it seems to be ok except I cannot get an IP
2005-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	GnuKemist	ogra	and I tried both WEP and WEP-less APs
2005-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	ogra	GnuKemist	tried the ubuntu-users mailing list ?
2005-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	GnuKemist	ogra	will try that next
2005-04-26T13:42:00.000Z	ogra	GnuKemist	i'm pretty sure there were others having this problem
