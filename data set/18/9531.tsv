2007-03-24T07:34:00.000Z	Krazytekn0		does fiesty work OK with AMD64?
2007-03-24T07:34:00.000Z	Krazytekn0		or should I go 32bit
2007-03-24T07:36:00.000Z	Krazytekn0		is it possible to install ubuntu over opensuse and keep my /home
2007-03-24T07:36:00.000Z	Krazytekn0		?
2007-03-24T07:36:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	it depends on your partition scheme.
2007-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	Krazytekn0	pibarnas	can you elaborate?
2007-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	well, if you hava a own /home, I mean a divided one from / on your scheme partition...
2007-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	and in ubuntu installation you don't format it, but put it as /home in the new partition scheme...
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	Krazytekn0	pibarnas	ok so I would just rewrite the / part and others but not /home
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	it might work, yeah.
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	Krazytekn0	pibarnas	thanks, I don't know why I even had to ask about it now that you explained
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	Krazytekn0		:P
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	I think so. I have here /, /home anda /data, just waiting for Feisty... :)
2007-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	Krazytekn0	pibarnas	I'm gonna try the beta out cause openSuse is really making me mad lately
2007-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	Krazytekn0		later all thanks for the help
2007-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	why don't you try the stable?
2007-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	if you want to avoid getting mad... ;)
2007-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	pibarnas	Krazytekn0	I still don't dare to try Feisty until its release.
