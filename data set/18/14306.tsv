2008-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	deostroll hmm if you just make the link in /usr/local/bin it will override what's in /usr/bin
2008-01-05T14:03:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	that depends on the order in PATH....which comes first
2008-01-05T14:03:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	I'm talking about Ubuntu's path setup
2008-01-05T14:04:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	I understand...but if the default is changed for some reason....then /usr/bin might come first
2008-01-06T19:41:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	Enselic: an ssh server is most definitely not installed by default in Ubuntu
2008-01-06T19:42:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	are you sure? I thought they had started including it
2008-01-06T19:42:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	still optional ;)
2008-01-15T14:47:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	I was close <smile> Was looking for the default path....hadn't found /etc/environment yet
2008-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	have you tried fusesmb?
2008-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	I have not
2008-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	puts all the workgroups in a mountpoint...just like browsing the local fiel system
2008-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	I click on ~/network and see a folder for each workgroup
2008-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	sounds nice
2008-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	yeah...made life so much simpler. enter the user/pw in the config file and log into whatever shares you like automatically on login
2008-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	astro76	th0r	I will have to tell some people at work about it
2008-01-15T15:25:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	just a side note...fuseiso is also nice if you haven't seen it
2008-01-15T15:25:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	fuse is a godsend
2008-01-27T11:24:00.000Z	th0r	astro76	I used to participate quite a bit here, but have cut back to almost nothing because of attitudes such as kahrytan.
