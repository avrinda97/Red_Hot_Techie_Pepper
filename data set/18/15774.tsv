2005-01-29T06:40:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	check out the wiki, particularly the pages on sharing with win2k
2005-01-29T06:41:00.000Z	Agony	crimsun	the connection itselves is no problem, but unfortunately my user data soes not match
2007-04-26T11:06:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	sure, what codec do you have?
2007-04-26T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	your sound chipset has a dsp and a codec. Tell me the codec.
2007-04-26T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat  if you're not sure.
2007-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	Agony	crimsun	The output of that is:
2007-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	pastebin ``amixer'', then tell me the url
2007-04-26T11:10:00.000Z	Agony	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17852/
2007-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	and in edgy?
2007-04-26T11:19:00.000Z	Agony	crimsun	I don't have one, or any blank CDs just now. If it's absolutely necessary I can go out and get some, but then this would have to wait until tomorrow.
2007-04-26T11:15:00.000Z	Agony	crimsun	Any ideas? All the forums could come up with was to completely reinstall Fiesty from a LiveCD, but I don't really want to have to do that, for obvious reasons.
2007-04-26T11:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	you could rm /var/lib/alsa/asound.state, but I really need your amixer output from a working edgy install or whatever to continue debugging.
2007-04-26T11:17:00.000Z	Agony	crimsun	How do I go about booting into an earlier system then? Sorry, I'm fairly new to this. Attempting to boot with an earlier kernel just doesn't work.
2007-04-26T11:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Agony	tried booting from an Edgy desktop cd?
