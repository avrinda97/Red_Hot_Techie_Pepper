2005-07-04T11:35:00.000Z	refuze2looze		anybody know how i can access a website on my HD using IE on crossover office? without apache..
2005-07-04T11:36:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	if it's just a html file, you can simply go to the place
2005-07-04T11:36:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	and how do i do that?
2005-07-04T11:37:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	it's not like i can enter /home/... in my address bar in IE
2005-07-04T11:38:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	file:///
2005-07-04T11:38:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	but I don't know what crossover office does exactly
2005-07-04T11:39:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	I would enter (In Firefox): file:///home/jeroen/websites/jeroen/index.html
2005-07-04T11:39:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	no, you can't do that in IE under crossover
2005-07-04T11:39:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	firefox runs under linux natively. big difference
2005-07-04T11:41:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	well, since Crossover is based off of Wine (isn't it) I guess it uses /home/user/.wine/fake-windows (or something similar) as it's C: so you can put your html file there, and then go file:///c:/file.html with IE
2005-07-04T11:43:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	no, you can't
2005-07-04T11:43:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	i just told you file:/// doesn't work
2005-07-04T11:44:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	well, then it doesn't. Can't help you, sorry.
2005-07-04T11:44:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	the fake HD is located at /home/user/.cxoffice/dotwine/dosdevices/c: but i can't get IE to access it
2005-07-04T11:45:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	not with file:///C:\ ?
2005-07-04T11:47:00.000Z	refuze2looze	jeroen_	nope
2005-07-04T11:48:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	mail Crossover guys ;)
2005-07-04T11:48:00.000Z	jeroen_	refuze2looze	it's paid, so they'd better help you ;-)
