2012-04-07T17:07:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	 open a terminal and type: ifconfig

2012-04-07T17:08:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	 now?
2012-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	 it should show the ips of your networkcards
2012-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	ifconfig| grep inet might makeit easierto see
2012-04-07T17:10:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	 with ifconfig i just can check my router LAN IPs
2012-04-07T17:11:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	wrong you check the IP ofyour PC
2012-04-07T17:12:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	and your question was,how can I check if i have a public ip
2012-04-07T17:12:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	 take a look http://pastebin.com/JuqheN9t
2012-04-07T17:13:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	that means your PC has 192.168.1.3 as address
2012-04-07T17:13:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	 i'm behind my router, maybe i should connetct my PC directly to the router that the Internet Provider gave me and run the command again ?
2012-04-07T17:13:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	192.168.1.3 is not a public IP is just my LAN address
2012-04-07T17:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	no,just ask the correct queston. Your router should always get a public IP
2012-04-07T17:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	Just login into your router,normally there'sa status panel that show the publicIP
2012-04-07T17:15:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	right
2012-04-07T17:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	alexita	and your router should normally always get a public IP
2012-04-07T17:17:00.000Z	alexita	schnuffle	MonkeyDust: the IP that the router get is different from the one on my Whatsmyipaddress  so  I HAVE NO PUBLIC IP :(
