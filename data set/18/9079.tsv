2007-05-31T08:45:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	do you need help restoring X after the kernel upgrade?
2007-05-31T08:46:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	Yes, I think so. It is failed to open.
2007-05-31T08:46:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	okay. Hit Ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a terminal
2007-05-31T08:46:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	I was getting help from Jordan_U earlyer. I am on a live CD btew
2007-05-31T08:46:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	wait, do you have an installed system?
2007-05-31T08:48:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	thanks for freaking me out btw, I couldnt figure out how to get back to X
2007-05-31T08:48:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	what?
2007-05-31T08:49:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	you told me to press ctrl+alt+f1 and terminal filled up the screen completely.
2007-05-31T08:49:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	I thought you were in an installed copy. My bad.
2007-05-31T08:49:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	it's probably easier to fix your problem NOT in a LiveCD
2007-05-31T08:50:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	well my installation is corrupt at the moment so it would be hard to fix not on a live CD :P
2007-05-31T08:50:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	do you get an X error on boot?
2007-05-31T08:50:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	something about an X server?
2007-05-31T08:50:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	yes, because I unstalled some files accidently.
2007-05-31T08:51:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	was that related to an update?
2007-05-31T08:51:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	also, what did you remove? Xorg.conf?
2007-05-31T08:51:00.000Z	Xenos767	cables	no it was related to me trying to install xfree on accident. and I dont know what I removed that is my problem.
2007-05-31T08:52:00.000Z	cables	Xenos767	hold on, I'm going to just clear something with Jordan_U for a sec
