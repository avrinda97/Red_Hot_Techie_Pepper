2007-04-14T07:39:00.000Z	fulat2k	bulmer	uhh.. ubuntu has a terminal server?
2007-04-14T07:39:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	have you tried the terminal services client?  <-- note the client

2007-04-14T07:41:00.000Z	fulat2k	bulmer	hi folks, is there a way i can remote control my existing X session in my kubuntu laptop to a winxp machine?
2007-04-14T07:41:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	have you tried the terminal services client?  <-- note the client, this was my response
2007-04-14T07:42:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	there is a terminal services client on ubuntu
2007-04-14T07:45:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	also there is a telnet server that you need to enable on the Windoz side and you can telnet in to the box
2007-04-14T07:45:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	but using the telnet off course does not have the gui capabilities
2007-04-14T07:49:00.000Z	fulat2k	bulmer	actually trying to connect from win to ubuntu.  my first msg got kinda messed up {g}
2007-04-14T07:51:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	you use clients like putty or others with ssh capabilities to log on to ubuntu (telnet in to ubuntu is not recommended)
2007-04-14T07:51:00.000Z	fulat2k	bulmer	i'm ssh-ing in actually.
2007-04-14T07:52:00.000Z	bulmer	fulat2k	you're a confusing person, you asking something and you are doing dfferent things
2007-04-14T07:53:00.000Z	fulat2k	bulmer	i phrased my question wrongly :P
