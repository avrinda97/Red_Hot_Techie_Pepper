2009-12-20T03:09:00.000Z	fear		alright i am running the ubuntu boot disk "try without changes" feature on my windows 2000 pc.  I am going around trying to see if it is what I want to do, i think it is, but I went to set up a printer and print a test page but when it printed test page it said it printed succesfully but nothing came out of printer like it never got to it.  Is it because I am just running the trial and it is not fully installed yet

2009-12-20T03:17:00.000Z	PacketCollision	fear	seems it should be supported by gutenprint driver, which afaik is included in live CD
2009-12-20T03:18:00.000Z	fear	PacketCollision	Do you think it is because it is not yet installed but is instead running on the "try without any changes" feature
