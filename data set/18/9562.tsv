2007-03-21T07:39:00.000Z	osofast		and all of a sudden the fat32 is read only
2007-03-21T07:40:00.000Z	osofast		different but related question, how do i unmount a partition
2007-03-21T07:41:00.000Z	osofast		ok ill try that brent
2007-03-21T07:42:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	or sudo fdisk -l
2007-03-21T08:29:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	it should be readwrite by default
2007-03-21T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	does this mount at boot or are you mounting it yourself?
2007-03-21T08:30:00.000Z	osofast	bruenig	it should be and it was but this morning it stopped working
2007-03-21T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	so it doesn't mount anymore?
2007-03-21T08:31:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	well paste the output of "grep vfat /etc/fstab"
2007-03-21T08:33:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	rw is redundant with the fmask and dmask, I would just take that out. Also if you want it to mount at boot put auto in there so:      /dev/hda4 /media/hda4 vfat auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000 0 0
2007-03-21T08:34:00.000Z	osofast	bruenig	it mounts automatically
2007-03-21T08:34:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	try my line
2007-03-21T08:36:00.000Z	osofast	bruenig	what do you mean try my line?
2007-03-21T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	sudo nano /etc/fstab and edit that line to what mine says
2007-03-21T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	co ctrl X to exit and then y to save it
2007-03-21T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	ok reboot, or sudo umount the fat32 disk and then "sudo mount -a" to see if it works
2007-04-08T12:04:00.000Z	bruenig	osofast	those are the same
2007-04-08T12:04:00.000Z	osofast	bruenig	thanks you
