2005-03-08T13:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic		in debian I don't think it does
2005-03-08T13:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic		in fact I'm pretty sure in debian you have to  specify any new kernels you install
2005-03-08T13:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic		yes
2005-03-08T13:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic		I assume if you've installed a 686 kernel the update will be a 686 kernel (haven't tried it)
2005-03-08T13:26:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	thoreauputic	whats the modules.conf in /etc/?  wouldn't that be the modconf?
2005-03-08T13:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	I don't know - I've only ever used modprobe and /etc/modules
2005-03-08T13:27:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	thoreauputic	I just did a find of *mod* and was looking.
2005-03-08T13:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	I actually don't know the function of modules.conf - once you identify the module and modprobe works, putting it in /etc/modules seems to activate it on boot
2005-03-08T13:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	actually if you do a `less /etc/modules.conf` the comments say not to edit it (it's automatically generated)
2005-03-08T13:31:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	thoreauputic	Yea I was just looking at that.
2005-03-08T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	heh - reading comments in config files can be quite educational - I should do it more often ;)
2005-03-10T13:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	use tab completion on it
2005-03-10T13:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	hehe

2005-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BiteMeBill	no worries :)
2005-03-10T13:36:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	thoreauputic	seems to even have a read problem LOL
