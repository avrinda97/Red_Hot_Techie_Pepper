2012-08-19T02:50:00.000Z	TaJMoX		It used to help ... shrug.
2012-08-19T02:50:00.000Z	TaJMoX		Speaking of CPU, anyone notice that plugin-container uses an incredible amount of CPU? Even if it's just a small flash running
2012-08-19T02:51:00.000Z	TaJMoX		Also, xorg is idling at 3% =\
2012-08-19T02:51:00.000Z	TaJMoX		custom compiled kernel*
2012-08-19T02:52:00.000Z	TaJMoX		I still have my Packard Bell 386 @ 33mhz w/ 4MB RAM
2012-08-19T02:52:00.000Z	TaJMoX		It doesn't run Ubuntu xD
2012-08-19T02:54:00.000Z	TaJMoX		In Xchat, how do I disable showing who has joined/quit ?
2012-08-19T02:54:00.000Z	TaJMoX		Unity seems to be super resource hog... even using Unity 2D
2012-08-19T02:55:00.000Z	TaJMoX		plugin-container is always at 50% cpu ... this sucks...
2012-08-19T02:55:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	use /ignore, eg. JOINS NICKS
2012-08-19T02:56:00.000Z	TaJMoX	W4sp	so like /ignore 'has joined' will work?
2012-08-19T02:57:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	/ignore JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS reduces the output to conversation channel messages.
2012-08-19T02:57:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	It's not /ignore 'has joined'. It is '/ignore joins parts nicks quits'
2012-08-19T02:57:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	Just type in /ignore and it shoud tell you what's being ignored.
2012-08-19T02:59:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	I also recommend to see if irssi does the trick for you. There are two X-chat in Software packages, one is x-chat, the other x-chat GNOME.
2012-08-19T03:06:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	Flash can get very CPU hungry if you use Flash to dynamicaly display data, eg. pie charts or similar with data feed. ajax or not ajax.
2012-08-19T03:14:00.000Z	W4sp	TaJMoX	Agree. I ensure my systems are hostile to Adobe's stuff.
