2008-05-07T07:06:00.000Z	Andares		Huh.
2008-05-07T07:06:00.000Z	Andares		How do you run it?
2008-05-07T07:07:00.000Z	Andares		!info silc-pidgin
2008-05-07T07:07:00.000Z	Andares		!info libsilc
2008-05-07T07:07:00.000Z	Andares		>_>
2008-05-07T07:07:00.000Z	Andares		Guys, where is the libsilc package?
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	Andares		!info silc-toolkit
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Andares	libsilc-1.1-2
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	Andares		!info libsilc-1.1-2
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	Andares		Ah, thank you Starnestommy.
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	Andares	Starnestommy	will that let pidgin run silc?
2008-05-07T07:09:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Andares	I'm not sure
2008-05-07T07:09:00.000Z	Andares	Starnestommy	apparently this bug has been around for a few years. I see '06 in the bug report.
2008-05-07T07:10:00.000Z	Andares	Starnestommy	but it hasn't been enabled. Might it be against ubuntu policy to provide encrypted IM toolkits?
2008-05-07T07:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Andares	it isn't against ubuntu policy
