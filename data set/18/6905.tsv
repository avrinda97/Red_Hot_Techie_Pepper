2008-03-09T07:07:00.000Z	bitsbam		hey there all
2008-03-09T07:08:00.000Z	bitsbam		i am trying to repair a drive with e2fsck -j /dev/hdc1  but it isn't working it gives me the useage stuff, i thought that this was all i needed
2008-03-09T07:09:00.000Z	bitsbam		if gparted cannot even determine the filesystem, it is a safe bet that my data is totally gone?
2008-03-09T07:10:00.000Z	bitsbam		cool, how do i do that?
2008-03-09T07:10:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	There exist disc recovery programs.
2008-03-09T07:10:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	I have never looked for one for Linux though.
2008-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	bitsbam	macrobad	Beererde, gparted sees that it is a drive 40gb but nothing else, tried e2fsck -j /dev/hdc1 but that would not run either
2008-03-09T07:15:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	you don't really need to be able to read separate files to make a disk backup, just create an image
2008-03-09T07:16:00.000Z	bitsbam	macrobad	with dd ?
2008-03-09T07:16:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	dd should suffice. Just be careful not to confuse input and output. =)
2008-03-09T07:18:00.000Z	bitsbam	macrobad	well, i don't have a spare 40 gb on anything. is there no way to repair the filesystem ?
2008-03-09T07:20:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	look, you would anyway need free space to recover your drive. If you attempt to recover it, while writing data to the same drive, you will most likely loose it.
2008-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	as for dd, here is good documentation: http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/dd.1.asp
2008-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	if I were you, I'd look for some disk recovery software in search engines.
2008-03-09T07:22:00.000Z	bitsbam	macrobad	hey thanks for that
2008-03-09T07:22:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	just make sure not to write to the same drive you are trying to recover!
2008-03-09T07:25:00.000Z	bitsbam	macrobad	right, thanks
2008-03-09T07:26:00.000Z	macrobad	bitsbam	not at all, really :)
