2010-02-15T22:05:00.000Z	lotus	Pianoman13	open a terminal, type sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf   then make your changes and write the file
2010-02-15T22:07:00.000Z	Pianoman13		when i make the change in my NVIDIA X server Settings, i get the error unable to remove old x config backup
2010-02-15T22:08:00.000Z	Pianoman13	lotus	when i make the change in my NVIDIA X server Settings, i get the error unable to remove old x config backup
2010-02-15T22:09:00.000Z	lotus	Pianoman13	try moving xorg.conf.bk or whatever it's called to a new location and trying again
2010-02-15T22:09:00.000Z	lotus	Pianoman13	or open nvidia-config (is that what it's caleld?) by hitting alt+f2 and then typing gksudo nvidia-config
2010-02-15T22:13:00.000Z	Pianoman13		Lotus i cannot do the solution you proposed because i think i do not understand enough
2010-02-15T22:14:00.000Z	Pianoman13		i would like to be able to change mmy screen resolution to native 1680-1050 using nvidia x server settings
2010-02-15T22:14:00.000Z	lotus	Pianoman13	try to find out the name of the nvidia tool.  try copying the launcher from the admin menu to the desktop and then checking what it points to
2010-02-15T22:15:00.000Z	lotus	Pianoman13	then when you get the command name to run the tool, use alt+f2 to open a run dialog, then type in "gksudo <toolname>"
2010-02-15T22:15:00.000Z	lotus		without the quotes Pianoman13
2010-02-15T22:15:00.000Z	Pianoman13		yes it is for my laptop screen
2010-02-15T22:15:00.000Z	lotus	Pianoman13	that should run the tool as root when you enter your password
