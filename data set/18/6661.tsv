2008-04-21T23:59:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		what's the linux equivalent of windows file shortcuts?
2008-04-22T00:00:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		thanks. I'm guessing I should have been putting my files in media instead of home then.
2008-04-22T00:01:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		why is my partition called "lost+found"?
2008-04-22T00:01:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		I'm just trying to figure out where files are supposed to go.
2008-04-22T00:02:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	your partiton is not called lost and found,  ext3 makes a folder like that for lost cluster when it fsck
2008-04-23T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	 lablel = hdd names
2008-04-23T05:44:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	 are those ntfs  hdds ?
2008-04-23T05:46:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	  ok then   open a terminal    sudo apt-get install ntfs-config ,     then look for it in the applications menu
2008-04-23T05:53:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	np
2008-04-23T05:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	 being a noob is noting to apologise for, as long as yo learn something
2009-07-25T07:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	8.04 is the LTS' you probably have the update manager set to only update to the next LTS , you'll need to change the setting
2009-07-25T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	Pelo	but is that LTS limitation desirable or not?
2009-07-25T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	depends on your use,  , LTS is long term support,  meaning that you'll get package update for several years ( 3 I think ) but you won'T upgrade prog versions,   businesses prefer that since it is less trouble , upgrading from release to release may be a shore if you have several computers do deal with
2009-07-25T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	with the regular release you get the newest , shyniest apps as every six months
2009-07-25T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	what's your issue again ?
2009-07-25T07:34:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	Pelo	(besides computers in general?) trying to install Radeon drivers. sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri  gets me "Reinstallation of libgl1-mesa-glx is not possible, it cannot be downloaded."
2009-07-25T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	Chaotic_Descent	the repos is probably down for some reason ,  try going into menu > system > admin> software sources and change the server you use , then reload and try again
2009-07-25T07:36:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	Pelo	thanks. I'm trying that now.
