2005-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	reka	qt2	i did
2005-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	qt2	reka	ahhh.. :P
2005-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	reka	qt2	he wanted to "change the font"
2005-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	reka	qt2	i thought that was what he wanted.
2005-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	qt2	reka	err... he wants to remove an image from the console.... :o
2005-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	reka	qt2	err..looks like he wants to fix his font first
2005-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	qt2	reka	ah... XD
2005-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	qt2	reka	sorry, all i saw him mention was the penguin... :P
2005-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	reka	qt2	he's using ctrl+alt+f1 to get into console iirc
2005-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	reka	qt2	is that a framebuffer console?
2005-07-27T09:10:00.000Z	reka	qt2	depends ... if you want 3d accel/direct rendering, then yeah, probably.
2005-07-27T09:10:00.000Z	qt2	reka	hm, my card already has direct rendering it seems <.<;
2005-07-27T09:11:00.000Z	reka	qt2	then you're good to go... (unless you want to see if there are any performance improvements with other drivers)
2005-07-27T09:12:00.000Z	qt2	reka	heh, i've learned not to mess with a good thing ;)
2005-07-27T09:13:00.000Z	reka	qt2	understandable :)
2005-07-27T09:13:00.000Z	qt2	reka	i havent even touched my kernel yet o.o;
2005-07-27T09:15:00.000Z	reka	qt2	you make it sound like it's commonplace ... i've only recompiled once, and that was done by following instructions.
2005-07-27T09:16:00.000Z	qt2	reka	it is if you're not using ubuntu.
