2012-06-20T12:38:00.000Z	Jacta		is it possible to get gnome3 to work under 12.04 in virtualbox? Tried two ways - a guide or in update center - but it doesnt look like gnome3 :/
2012-06-20T12:38:00.000Z	Jacta		can I be missing something?
2012-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	Jacta		is looks like this now: http://screenshotuploader.com/s/01/K7IcUV7cM
2012-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	You need to have Guest Additions installed
2012-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	Jacta	theadmin	ah- didnt think i have that now - ill try
2012-06-20T12:42:00.000Z	Jacta	theadmin	almost done, and after that I should.. restart or?
2012-06-20T12:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	Well I guess so, you can simply restart X
2012-06-20T13:03:00.000Z	Jacta	theadmin	it still looks like an old gnome - tookt "Gnome" in list (there was three) - can it be that update center overwritten to an older version - and can I check
2012-06-20T13:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	Do you have the gnome-shell package installed?
2012-06-20T13:04:00.000Z	Jacta	theadmin	it says "gnome-shell" is allready the newest version
2012-06-20T13:04:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	Hm... Odd. I'm not sure then.
2012-06-20T13:05:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	It loads the GNOME Fallback session in your case (which happens when it can't load the standard Shell for some reason, or when you pick it from the list)

2012-06-20T13:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	Well, try to pick the "other" GNOME from the list then

2012-06-20T13:24:00.000Z	theadmin	Jacta	Use what?
