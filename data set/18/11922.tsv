2006-08-15T12:00:00.000Z	TomaszD		how do I change my shell back to /bin/bash? I have dash now
2006-08-15T12:01:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 try chsh
2006-08-15T12:03:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	doesn't work, I've done something like this earlier: update-alternatives --install /bin/sh sh /bin/dash 1
2006-08-15T12:05:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 hmmm, first things first, lets make sure the bash binary is there...  ls -al /bin/bash
2006-08-15T12:05:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 669740 2006-04-22 00:51 /bin/bash
2006-08-15T12:06:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 what happens if you simply type /bin/bash ?
2006-08-15T12:07:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 excuse me, I mean  /bin/bash --version
2006-08-15T12:08:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release (i486-pc-linux-gnu)
2006-08-15T12:08:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	but that's not helping, I still cannot run the ati installer which is known to bail out on dash
2006-08-15T12:09:00.000Z	TomaszD		I had this problem today with another workstation djcabz
2006-08-15T12:09:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 you really should be able to simply type  /bin/bash   and be in the bash shell.
2006-08-15T12:10:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	I know, I wouldn't be here if it was that easy to fix :)
2006-08-15T12:12:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 I think we've run up to the limit of my knowledge on this topic then...  however, I did notice that your /bin/bash binary was a different size versus mine, yet, the version numbering is the same?
2006-08-15T12:12:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	I've screwed the other workstation up to the point of the terminal crashing upon start and having no sh interpreter. I had to reinstall that one completely, I don't want to screw this one up
2006-08-15T12:12:00.000Z	TomaszD	djcabz	ok thanks anyway, will try to get this fixed
2006-08-15T12:12:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 keep asking someone here may know more...
2006-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	TomaszD		ok
2006-08-15T12:14:00.000Z	djcabz	TomaszD	 what happens when you ls -al /bin/sh
