2006-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	mwe		what's the command to flush the file buffers?
2006-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	sync
2006-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	mwe		oh yeah
2006-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	don't count on it though :)
2006-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	jdong		lol
2006-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	jdong		why are you syncing?
2006-04-23T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	jdong	because I deleted some files from a memory card but they appeared again
2006-04-23T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	jdong	I think it was because of buffering
2006-04-23T15:18:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	did you umount the card before pulling it out?
2006-04-23T15:18:00.000Z	jdong		though the eject utility or umount on the terminal?
2006-04-23T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	jdong	no should that be done automatically?
2006-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	not if you don't tell it to
2006-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	jdong	ok I thought so since it mounted automatically
2006-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	it doesn't unmount magically
2006-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	mwe		I see
2006-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	you can't psychically determine when a user has finished using a device ;)
2006-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	jdong	true
2006-04-23T15:20:00.000Z	jdong	mwe	opensuse does though... by unmounting and remounting between every operation
