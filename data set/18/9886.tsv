2007-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	DSpair	Woody_	Take a look at http://freshmeat.net. That site is FULL of software for Linux/Unix, and there are replacements for most of your Windows EWXE files there.

2007-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	DSpair	Woody_	Yes, AUTOCAD will not run on Linux. Alternately though, there are actually better drafting solutions available for Linux for free.

2007-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	DSpair	Woody_	It's been a while. Let me look it up for you.

2007-04-20T10:09:00.000Z	Woody_	DSpair	and i can see the computer with linux on my network with that same software?
2007-04-20T10:10:00.000Z	DSpair	Woody_	Linux, Windows, Mac, it runs on all of them... All you need to know is the address of the computer.

2007-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	DSpair	Woody_	Click on "System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager"
2007-04-20T10:14:00.000Z	DSpair	Woody_	In fact, there are several CAAD packages available in the Ubunutu package manager.
