2010-08-04T20:57:00.000Z	gimmickless_		Server is not recognizing my Belkin wireless USB stick. Any ideas on how to mount/config it?
2010-08-04T20:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	no wlan0 in « iwconfig » output ?
2010-08-04T21:00:00.000Z	gimmickless_	erUSUL	"wlan0 output = IEEE 802.11bg ESSID:off/any" and three more lines of data
2010-08-04T21:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	then the stick was recogniced ok....
2010-08-04T21:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	you are in server so no gui ?
2010-08-04T21:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	then use this instructions to edit interfaces file http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#wpasupplicant
2010-08-04T21:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	assuming you are using wpa in the router
2010-08-04T21:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	in the router?
2010-08-04T21:03:00.000Z	gimmickless_	erUSUL	installed Server w/o connecting to router
2010-08-04T21:03:00.000Z	gimmickless_	erUSUL	was hoping to use wireless card as access.
2010-08-04T21:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	ahh ok; so you want the server to become access point?
2010-08-04T21:06:00.000Z	gimmickless_	erUSUL	just wanted to set an old box up as a Samba server.
2010-08-04T21:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	found this http://www.net42.co.uk/os/linux/sharing_3g_with_hostapd.html <<< you will have to tweak the hostap.conf configuration ( the driver= probably etc... )
2010-08-04T21:08:00.000Z	gimmickless_	erUSUL	will give it a shot. thanks for helping the noobs.
2010-08-04T21:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	no problem
2010-08-04T21:15:00.000Z	gimmickless_	erUSUL	Just remembered.  The wireless router I want to connect to is password protected.
2010-08-04T21:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	i thought you said you wanted make the server a wireless router ...
2010-08-04T21:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	gimmickless_	if the server with the usb wifi nic is going to be a client of a wifi router then use this instructions to edit interfaces file http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#wpasupplicant
