2006-05-29T09:51:00.000Z	Tylerofl		hey, can someone please tell me how to execute a command during the initial load screen?
2006-05-29T09:52:00.000Z	Tylerofl		to get the internet running, every time i have to open a console and type dhclient ra0
2006-05-29T09:52:00.000Z	Tylerofl		is there any way to do this during startup automatically?
2006-05-29T09:53:00.000Z	intelikey	Tylerofl	init scripts
2006-05-29T09:53:00.000Z	Tylerofl	intelikey	how do i use init scripts
2006-05-29T09:53:00.000Z	intelikey	Tylerofl	/etc/init.d/bootmisc*
2006-05-29T09:54:00.000Z	intelikey	Tylerofl	you don't use init scripts the system does....  put your command in bootmisc just before the exit 0 at the bottom.
2006-05-29T09:55:00.000Z	intelikey	Tylerofl	just like you would enter it on the command line.  except for any sudo.   the scripts are ran by init.   init is higher than root.
2006-05-29T09:57:00.000Z	Tylerofl		file:///etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2006-05-29T09:57:00.000Z	Tylerofl		that one?

2006-05-29T09:59:00.000Z	intelikey	Tylerofl	gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2006-05-29T10:01:00.000Z	intelikey		boot into recovery mode ?????  that's like so windowish.   yuch.
