2007-08-28T06:20:00.000Z	phead		 hello all, I have a newbie question: I downloaded an app (powerjournal) so now I have a "setup.bin" file on my desktop. How do I install?
2007-08-28T06:21:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	You want a .deb package instead
2007-08-28T06:22:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	you can download the source and compile
2007-08-28T06:22:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	Or make your own .deb from the source
2007-08-28T06:23:00.000Z	phead	Clearzen	ok... can you give me some advice or a howto? :)
2007-08-28T06:24:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	Yeah, what do you want to install?
2007-08-28T06:26:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	Download the source code from that sourceforge page
2007-08-28T06:28:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	tar -xzf file.tar.gz; make && sudo make install
2007-08-28T06:28:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	There may be a configure script. If there is run ./configure first
2007-08-28T06:29:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	you will have to change your directory to the folder you untar before you run make or ./configure
2007-08-28T06:29:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	Stop me if I'm not making sense
2007-08-28T06:32:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	One sec. I'm looking at the source
2007-08-28T06:33:00.000Z	phead	Clearzen	ok, thanks
2007-08-28T06:35:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	ok, do you have a java compiler? because you will need one
2007-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	phead	Clearzen	aha. with synaptic I suppose?
2007-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	Also you will need to install ant with sudo aptitude install ant. Then change your directory to the source folder inside powerjournal. type ant. It will generate a build folder. In the build folder there will be a powerjournal.sh file you can run with ./powerjournal.sh and that will install it.
2007-08-28T06:40:00.000Z	phead	Clearzen	whoah. Thanks very much for your help, but I'm gonna copy your text and have a go at this another time. I'm really tired now as it is 2:40 here. :) Good advice about finding another app anyway. Good night and thanks again
2007-08-28T06:41:00.000Z	Clearzen	phead	Cool, good luck
