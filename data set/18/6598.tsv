2008-04-30T04:22:00.000Z	shally87		need help... i wanna ask why ubuntu dekstop consume around 5gb space/
2008-04-30T04:22:00.000Z	maco	shally87	should take more like 2gb i think...though not sure on hardy....why? thats not really a lot
2008-04-30T04:23:00.000Z	maco	shally87	you dont have service packs installed? or is it win 98?
2008-04-30T04:24:00.000Z	maco	shally87	i installed ubuntu 7.04 on a 5gb (which means really 4gb because hard drive manufacturers measure funny) before
2008-04-30T04:24:00.000Z	shally87	maco	i only use 1 or 2 gb for windows..nono i use xp pro..
2008-04-30T04:24:00.000Z	maco	shally87	xp with all the service packs, i was told, wouldnt fit on my 5gb drive i have at home
2008-04-30T04:25:00.000Z	shally87	maco	owh..actually i wonder how come 1 cd of 730 mb can become 5 gig...
2008-04-30T04:25:00.000Z	maco	shally87	but anyway, ubuntu includes a *lot* of software that windows doesnt
2008-04-30T04:25:00.000Z	maco	shally87	oh the packages are compressed on teh cd
2008-04-30T04:26:00.000Z	shally87	maco	yeah.. i notice that..so you mean it was compressed in word form then was translate to become an application after installation so that it can fit 1 disc?
2008-04-30T04:26:00.000Z	maco	shally87	no source code is huge.  they compile it, then compress the binary and all the config files and put them on the cd, then the installer decompresses them
2008-04-30T04:27:00.000Z	shally87	maco	owh ok..thanks for reply
2008-04-30T04:28:00.000Z	shally87	maco	and i got problem with my sudo.. when i click the run application and type there sudo fdisk -l, the terminal open and prompt for password.. then it closes..after that i cannot open sudo fdisk -l anymore..
2008-04-30T04:30:00.000Z	maco	shally87	fdisk is a terminal app, not a graphical one.  just open a terminal (application -> accessories -> terminal) and *then* run sudo fdisk -l
2008-04-30T04:30:00.000Z	shally87	maco	i try first..thanks
2008-04-30T04:33:00.000Z	shally87	maco	what the meaning of this?? i take from my fdisl -l : http://pastebin.com/d37d9e590
2008-04-30T04:38:00.000Z	shally87	maco	i think will be figuring it later..now i have to do something..thanks..
