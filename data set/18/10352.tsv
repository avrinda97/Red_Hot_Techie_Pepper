2006-12-30T17:29:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	and the install stalls while scanning the cdrom.
2006-12-30T17:30:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	or it wont even boot with my existing install on a PATA drive
2006-12-30T17:31:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	sorry I replied to the wrong post, I meant that for derrik.
2006-12-30T17:32:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	well you were actually right about my problem
2006-12-30T17:32:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	is it solved!?
2006-12-30T17:33:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	yes.
2006-12-30T17:33:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	but the kernel doesnt seem to be able to use this motherboard, specifically the PATA controller
2006-12-30T17:33:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	ok, have you cleaned the CD, and the drive, otherwise it could be a bad burn?
2006-12-30T17:34:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	ok, now I'm all confused, and I don't know anything about pata drives.
2006-12-30T17:34:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	you probably missed my earlier post. The kernel doesnt seem to be able to use the Intel motherboard DG965WH as referenced here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core_2_Duo_Support
2006-12-30T17:35:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	ok I don't know why Ubuntu would have trouble with an IDE drive, how new is the mom board?
2006-12-30T17:36:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	brand new. check out the wiki about it
2006-12-30T17:36:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	that could be the problem, brand new hardware might not be supported yet?
2006-12-30T17:36:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	thats exactly it
2006-12-30T17:37:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	well, then there is nothing anybody here can do to fix that. :/
2007-01-06T17:51:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	click on system/admin/printing?
2008-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	jesse	n2diy	Thunar is pretty much a lighter and sleeker version of nautilus. it is very nice :D
2008-01-13T15:12:00.000Z	n2diy	jesse	ok
