2010-05-10T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	its in the official repo
2010-05-25T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	you may get it with the nvidia vdpau ppa. They keep up pretty well
2010-05-25T11:32:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	could you please help me set this up?
2010-05-25T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	there are guides all over the web dude. I have even advised it on the ubuntu questions forum
2010-05-25T11:33:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	im sorry to bother, thanks anyway ill look it up :)
2010-05-25T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	normally I would but getting that sort of stuff whilst ircing on my phone will take longer than you can find a guide
2010-05-25T11:35:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	I understand
2010-05-25T12:18:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	I have successfully added ppa:nvidia-vdpau/ppa to my system but all i get is some HD wallpapers and video codecs ( no driver )
2010-05-25T12:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	hmm try: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-185 ,always works here. The codecs are great :)
2010-05-25T12:21:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	I need the 256  version and it seems only karmic has this in the ppa i use lucid 64 bit do i just have to wait?
2010-05-25T12:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	I guess. Is your performance really bad?
2010-05-25T12:22:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	no my performance is great :D its just that the 256 has a VNC fix for the "no screen update bug with gnome"
2010-05-25T12:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	I see. Then log a bug and state the new driver fixes it and it may get included faster :)
2010-05-25T12:24:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	I think i need more time with linux first I got noe clue over here x)
2010-05-25T12:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	i'd remove the vdpau ppa and add the xswat ppa: http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppas/27
2010-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	Kine	ActionParsnip	i did add x swap but the 256 driver is not there
2010-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	read the top few lines of the link you gave
2010-05-25T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kine	you need to install the nvidia-graphics-drivers package once you add it
