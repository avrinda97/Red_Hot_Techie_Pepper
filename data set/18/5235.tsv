2009-07-26T03:58:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		I have the third party repos enabled, im trying to install partimage, but it says not found
2009-07-26T04:00:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	 try installing from the command line, first "sudo apt-get update"  then "sudo apt-get install partimage"
2009-07-26T04:00:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		thats what I did
2009-07-26T04:01:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		I couldent even find it in symaptics package manager
2009-07-26T04:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	the same happened to me with cinelerra, I couldnt find the package so I just installed using "apt-get install" and it worked fine
2009-07-26T04:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	 you already tried "sudo apt-get install partimage" ???
2009-07-26T04:03:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		this is what it says if I try
2009-07-26T04:03:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		http://pastebin.com/m7f48101c
2009-07-26T04:03:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		and yes UI used that command in the terminal
2009-07-26T04:05:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		any ideas?
2009-07-26T04:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	can I see your cat /etc/apt/sources.list file?
2009-07-26T04:06:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		Ill try, not sure if dcc will work
2009-07-26T04:06:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	just copy and paste your source.list file to pastebin
2009-07-26T04:06:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun		ok
2009-07-26T04:07:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	 put your file in pastebin so that everyone in the room can see it, someone may catch something that I didn't
2009-07-26T04:07:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	mezquitale	here http://pastebin.com/m4aae8f8c
2009-07-26T04:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cyber_Akuma-Ubun	 it looks like you have all the repos configured, the only other reason you could get this error is because you have a key missing or your package manager is corrupt
