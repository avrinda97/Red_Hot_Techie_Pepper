2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		Hi everyone
2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		Hate being the new guy but I think I messed something up
2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		I keep seeing stuff online about swap but when I set my system up, i didn't set up swap
2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		is that bad?
2011-09-08T00:04:00.000Z	thomasj73		Is it too late to add swap after I've already installed Ubuntu?
2011-09-08T00:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	Ubuntu creates a swap partition by default. Did you use automatic partitioning in the installer or manual?
2011-09-08T00:06:00.000Z	thomasj73	Jordan_U	How can I see my partitions?  fdisk?
2011-09-08T00:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	I would recommend using GParted from a LiveCD/USB. After you create a swap partition you will need to add an entry for it in your /etc/fstab.
2011-09-08T02:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	Try "unity --reset".
2011-09-08T02:27:00.000Z	thomasj73	Jordan_U	I tried that, it gets to a certain point and hangs forever
2011-09-08T02:27:00.000Z	thomasj73	Jordan_U	Do I have to be logged into or out of the session I am trying to repair?
2011-09-08T02:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	I would expect that you'd need to be in the session you're trying to repair. And the command is expected to "hang" as unity will continue running.
2011-09-08T02:29:00.000Z	thomasj73	Jordan_U	Ok, I will have to try to get into term in the Shell, I have no menu's, no icons, not anything.  All I can do is ctrl+alt+del
2011-09-08T02:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	ctlr+alt+F1, log in, run "DISPLAY=:0.0 unity --reset", ctlr+alt+F7 (possibly some other number like F8 or F9).
2011-09-08T02:31:00.000Z	thomasj73	Jordan_U	Thank you for your help!  I'll give that a shot!
2011-09-08T02:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	You're welcome.
2011-09-08T02:42:00.000Z	thomasj73	Jordan_U	thank you!  Back in Unity Shell!
2011-09-08T02:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thomasj73	You're welcome :)
