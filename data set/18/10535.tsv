2009-01-06T19:13:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		im trying to write a small script, how do i make the "echo" effect like DOS on linux? lol
2009-01-06T19:14:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	I'll tell you.. on one condition..
2009-01-06T19:14:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	aww.. and we could hade made MidnightDevil promise never to use lol in the channela gain =)
2009-01-06T19:15:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	then you're doing it wrong.. echo will indeed print out stuff
2009-01-06T19:17:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	what are you trying to do?
2009-01-06T19:18:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	Slart	print an ascii art on the terminal with a few commands below.. :)
2009-01-06T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	use "" around the weird text
2009-01-06T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	echo "\/;|" will print just that
2009-01-06T19:20:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	Slart	trust me dude, i can send u a screen lol
2009-01-06T19:20:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	mm.. ok
2009-01-06T19:21:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	or a pastebin might be easier for both of us
2009-01-06T19:29:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	Slart	done, its there
2009-01-06T19:30:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	do you have the url?
2009-01-06T19:32:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu.com/101070/
2009-01-06T19:36:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	ah.. ok.. I see... hang on.. let me see how to fix that
2009-01-06T19:39:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	one easy fix would be to put the ascii art in a ordinary text file and just use "cat my_awesome_ascii_art.txt" to print it out..
2009-01-06T19:44:00.000Z	Slart	MidnightDevil	here's another suggestion http://paste.ubuntu.com/101077/
