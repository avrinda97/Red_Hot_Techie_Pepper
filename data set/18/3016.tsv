2010-02-07T19:47:00.000Z	Fox_1_		hi all
2010-02-07T19:47:00.000Z	Fox_1_		people I have problem with Kubuntu installation (9.10 64bit)
2010-02-07T19:48:00.000Z	Fox_1_		After choosing language and pressing Install in menu it shows black screen and nothing
2010-02-07T19:49:00.000Z	Fox_1_		I have tried without quite mod
2010-02-07T19:49:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	is ur monitor on?
2010-02-07T19:50:00.000Z	Fox_1_	madura	it's notebook :) and if the monitor was off I wouldn't see langauge selection ...
2010-02-07T19:51:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	ah i asked whether ur monitor receives signals  after the language selection
2010-02-07T19:53:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	did you try google
2010-02-07T19:54:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	have no idea may be something's wrong with the graphics drivers that come with the installation
2010-02-07T19:55:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	yea i think so but can't be sure
2010-02-07T19:55:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	why don't u try updating?
2010-02-07T19:56:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	yea
2010-02-07T19:56:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	but your os is 32bit
2010-02-07T19:58:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	hmm that wont change much tho
2010-02-07T20:00:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	for a normal user it doesn't mean much, if you do big caculations then 64bit is good(AFAIK)
2010-02-07T20:00:00.000Z	Fox_1_	madura	and what about OS performance?
2010-02-07T20:03:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	64bit uses more RAM and has a lil bit of speed
2010-02-07T20:04:00.000Z	madura	Fox_1_	if u want to have 32bit then you can add KDE
