2011-08-11T09:24:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	I don't know how to deal with GRUB2, but I guess yes
2011-08-11T09:19:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	Append "nosplash" to your grub line
2011-08-11T09:24:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nosplash" ... is this correct?
2011-08-11T09:25:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	if i screw this i might never be able to boot, right?
2011-08-11T09:26:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	Nah, reinstalling GRUB is no problem.
2011-08-11T09:26:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	To me at least.
2011-08-11T09:26:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	oh yeah! i forgot... you're right...
2011-08-11T09:27:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	i can still fix grub using a live-cd just in case... tnx!
2011-08-11T09:29:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	k
2011-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	Doesn't the nosplash thing work?
2011-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	Might better work as "nosplash noquiet", I guess...
2011-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	nope...
2011-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	But idk
2011-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	went back "quiet splash"
2011-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	it's alright... plymouth takes longer so i think i'd focus on disabling plymouth for now
2011-08-11T10:17:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	you have an idea how to disable plymouth??
2011-08-11T10:17:00.000Z	theadmin	GreenCloud	I already did say the idea >.< Oh well
2011-08-11T10:17:00.000Z	GreenCloud	theadmin	oh yeah....sorry, my bad!
