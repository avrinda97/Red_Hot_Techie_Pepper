2011-02-26T14:52:00.000Z	pw-toxic__		i have a raid with 16MB/s write rate
2011-02-26T14:52:00.000Z	pw-toxic__		does someone have an idea why ma raid is so slow?
2011-02-26T14:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	raid in what mode?
2011-02-26T14:55:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	i can write to my raid5 with > 80 MB/s
2011-02-26T14:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	so what is ma raid?  raid mode 1?
2011-02-26T14:56:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	as i said.. i have a raid1

2011-02-26T14:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	well you share the same data path to two disks and you miror the data so it could go almost 1/2 as fast as without raid
2011-02-26T14:58:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	and still the write rates of my 2TB drives as a single device are about 100 MB/s
2011-02-26T14:58:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	so even if the write rate would be half, it is still up to 50 MB/s and not 16 MB/s
2011-02-26T14:59:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	and by the way.. you can write in parallel to the raid1
2011-02-26T14:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	well must have some overhead I'm not sure
2011-02-26T15:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	if you have two ide or sata ports maybe try put your raid pair on different ports
2011-02-26T15:03:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	it is
2011-02-26T15:05:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	and by the way.. reading is very fast.. the only problem is writing
2011-02-26T15:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	I'm not too sure about your test method using network transfer to test disk speed
2011-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	pw-toxic__	are you running a desktop on it?  if so what does the System>administaratio>disk utility> benchmark give you?
2011-02-26T15:16:00.000Z	pw-toxic__	sacarlson	i cant do write becnhmarks because the drive is in use or something like this
