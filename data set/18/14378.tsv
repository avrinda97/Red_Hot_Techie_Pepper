2005-10-22T08:00:00.000Z	Phuzion		How can I have Windows and Ubuntu co-reside on the same machine, but different hard drives?
2005-10-22T08:00:00.000Z	Phuzion		Ubuntu is currently the master drive
2005-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	Phuzion		ext2, I believe
2005-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	Phuzion		Yeah, it's ext2
2005-10-22T08:03:00.000Z	Phuzion		Alright, thanks.
2005-10-22T08:03:00.000Z	Phuzion		What would I have to change to it in order to get it to find Windows on my other HD though?

2006-03-29T06:34:00.000Z	bimberi	Phuzion	cat /etc/group
2006-11-16T16:26:00.000Z	bimberi	Phuzion	no, recommended path is breezy -> dapper -> edgy
2006-11-16T16:27:00.000Z	Phuzion	bimberi	sorry, I do have dapper, assuming dapper is 5.10, right?
2006-11-16T16:27:00.000Z	bimberi	Phuzion	5.10 is breezy
2006-11-23T09:10:00.000Z	bimberi	Phuzion	System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts, backspace disables a shortcut
2006-11-23T09:10:00.000Z	Phuzion	bimberi	 thanks a ton

2006-11-30T06:17:00.000Z	bimberi	Phuzion	sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart
2006-11-30T06:18:00.000Z	Phuzion	bimberi	that's the one I was looking for, thanks
