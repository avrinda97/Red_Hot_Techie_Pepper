2008-06-09T03:28:00.000Z	theFATMAN		how do i delete a file when rm doesnt work or force?
2008-06-09T03:28:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	sudo
2008-06-09T03:30:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	does tab completion fill it in?
2008-06-09T03:30:00.000Z	theFATMAN	musikgoat	no
2008-06-09T03:31:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	does ls -al show it?
2008-06-09T03:32:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	i've seen that sometimes with ghost mount points
2008-06-09T03:32:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	do you see it in terminal ls -al ~/Desktop
2008-06-09T03:38:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	you never answered, does the file even show when you type ls -al ~/Desktop
2008-06-09T03:39:00.000Z	theFATMAN	musikgoat	srry, no it doesnt thats what is nuts, my system says it doesnt exist, but i'm looking at it right now
2008-06-09T03:39:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	then the desktop is ghosting
2008-06-09T03:40:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	save proggies and logout and log back in
2008-06-09T03:42:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	thats new to me then...  what would cause a file to show on the desktop even after clearing it... odd
2008-06-09T03:44:00.000Z	theFATMAN	musikgoat	what happened was somehow when i initially saved it, i accidentally added a letter after the .png ext without seeing it. then it saved it, and i noticed it afterwards. now i cant get rid of the dang thing
2008-06-09T03:49:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	i think that will be useless, as the file really doesn't exist, only a graphic on the desktop
2008-06-09T03:53:00.000Z	theFATMAN	musikgoat	i tried the -f with -rm, that didnt work either
2008-06-09T03:57:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	are you using a window manager? desktop effects?
2008-06-09T03:58:00.000Z	theFATMAN	musikgoat	aye, compiz+emerald, i switched them off, and it didnt change anything regarding deleting the file
2008-06-09T03:58:00.000Z	musikgoat	theFATMAN	awe shucks
