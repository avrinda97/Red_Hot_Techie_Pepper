2010-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	UnholyTerror		Ok, Administration->Users and Groups doesn't appear to do anything.
2010-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UnholyTerror	if you launch it with gksudo, you can modify any user
2010-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UnholyTerror	assuming the user launching it is a memeber of the admin group
2010-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	settings don't seem to work...
2010-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	I want to restrict a user from using the internet but no matter what, a connection is established and the user can browse.
2010-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	I am making changes as root (unlock) as I am the admin.
2010-11-02T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UnholyTerror	you can edit the menu so it runs wih gksudo so its automatically unlocked
2010-11-02T05:30:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	is that going to be different than unlocking it? The changes I make are there... just not following the rules.
2010-11-02T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UnholyTerror	just saves you having to click unlock etc, I use cli user admin personally
2010-11-02T05:41:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	settings do not take effect. I cannot drop or prevent the user from accessing wireless or ethernet connections.
2010-11-02T05:42:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	shouldn't that prevent internet/lan access?
2010-11-02T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UnholyTerror	not sure, i've not done such a thing
2010-11-02T05:43:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	I gotta try some other things... thanks.
2010-11-02T05:55:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	it's weird, I can enable/disable 'Admin rights', enable/disable 'Configure Printers', but nothing has an effect on 'connect to wireless/ethernet networks'
2010-11-02T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UnholyTerror	you could make the nm-applet only executable by a certain group and add the users you want to have access in that group
2010-11-02T05:57:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	Just wondering if anyone can duplicate this?
2010-11-02T06:01:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	Even now, my account is set to not be able to use modems or wireless/ethernet networks.
2010-11-02T06:01:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	ActionParsnip	yet here I am?
