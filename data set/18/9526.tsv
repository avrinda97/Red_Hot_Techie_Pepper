2007-03-25T13:56:00.000Z	Alonea	xMorgawr	i had trouble getting anjuta to work so I moved onto Eclipse and it works fine. You just wanting to write java code or what?
2007-03-25T13:57:00.000Z	xMorgawr	Alonea	for java i use eclipse and geany and they work fine, but i wanted to learn using anjuta IDE too
2007-03-25T13:57:00.000Z	Alonea	xMorgawr	ah. well, I could never figure out how to compile with it...would like to find a howto for it too
2007-03-25T13:58:00.000Z	xMorgawr	Alonea	i checked the wiki but it seems that there is no one for it yet >.<'
2007-03-25T13:58:00.000Z	Alonea	xMorgawr	makes me sad...I find it funny how I figured out eclipse in 10 minutes and could not figure out anjuta at all
2007-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	xMorgawr	Alonea	honestly i think that geany is perfect to build easy and light java programs... eclipse is a little too "heavy"
2007-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	xMorgawr	Alonea	have you tried geany?
2007-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	Alonea	xMorgawr	ah, well, I am a computer science major. I use it for school. So far I love it.
2007-03-25T14:00:00.000Z	xMorgawr	Alonea	at school we use jcreator for java (windows stuff >_>) but we still don't do hard things.. only cheap programs ;)
2007-03-25T14:02:00.000Z	Alonea	xMorgawr	ah. yeah, the class uses JCreator, but I am on Linux and since I am working on programs most the time at home. I just bring my laptop to class and use eclipse. professor doesn't mind at all. I think in my class we are making programs to convert whatever a user types to ascii or another code and then building off of it. Like adding multiple methods and such. still easy for me. How...
2007-03-25T14:02:00.000Z	Alonea		...is the debugger geany?
2007-03-25T14:06:00.000Z	xMorgawr	Alonea	wow cool, they allow you to take your pc to classes? blah here in italy we can't >_>' they are too scared for virus and all that junk
