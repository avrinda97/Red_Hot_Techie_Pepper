2010-05-16T21:49:00.000Z	nicholas__		It is on a netbook - no install CD.
2010-05-16T21:50:00.000Z	nicholas__		Don't have one.
2010-05-16T21:50:00.000Z	nicholas__		It came with it.
2010-05-16T21:51:00.000Z	nicholas__		hoverbear;
2010-05-16T21:51:00.000Z	nicholas__		hoverbear:
2010-05-16T21:51:00.000Z	nicholas__		!hoverbear
2010-05-16T21:51:00.000Z	nicholas__		How do I do that?
2010-05-16T21:51:00.000Z	nicholas__		Where you address me?
2010-05-16T21:53:00.000Z	nicholas__		So, any other ideas?
2010-05-16T21:55:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	your problem was booting into windows via grub correct?
2010-05-16T21:57:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	do you know if your using grub2? or the older legacy grub?
2010-05-16T21:59:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	if your in ubuntu right now, open terminal and run, 'cd /boot/grub' then enter, then run 'ls -a | grep menu.lst'
2010-05-16T22:00:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	if you have no output on the 2nd command your likley using grub2, if you do see a menu.lst in the output your still using the legacy grub
2010-05-16T22:01:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	please post your /boot/grub/grub.cfg in a pastebin
2010-05-16T22:04:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	if the 'update-grub' doesnt work, then come back and we can manually add your windows menu entry
2010-05-16T22:14:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	go ahead and try to append this entry to your '/etc/grub.d/40_custom'               http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/cc5znBYr
2010-05-16T22:15:00.000Z	DCGstudios	nicholas__	of course i can read, patience is a virtue my friend
