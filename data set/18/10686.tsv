2006-11-04T08:05:00.000Z	klees		i installed the linux-k7 driver but i dont have it as an option under GRUB...  is this ok?
2006-11-04T08:05:00.000Z	klees		linux-k7 kernel*
2006-11-04T08:05:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	Edgy?
2006-11-04T08:05:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	Edgy
2006-11-04T08:06:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	Apparently this is right, linux-k7 is a dummy package for upgrade, replaced with linux-generic
2006-11-04T08:07:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	before it used to give me the option to select it under Dapper
2006-11-04T08:07:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	What do you see in grub? i386 or generic?
2006-11-04T08:07:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	generic
2006-11-04T08:08:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	basically that is the new name for k7
2006-11-04T08:08:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	that's the name for the default kernel as well
2006-11-04T08:09:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	I think it detected your AMD chip, I'm just guessing this based on my install experience
2006-11-04T08:09:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	np
2006-11-04T08:09:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	although, is there a way to tell if it's using k7 features?
2006-11-04T08:11:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	apt-cache search linux-image-k7
2006-11-04T08:12:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	That command should tell you that it's been obsoleted by generic
2006-11-04T08:12:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	it does
2006-11-04T08:13:00.000Z	kev_b	klees	other than that i have no idea, sorry : )
2006-11-04T08:13:00.000Z	klees	kev_b	it's ok thx
