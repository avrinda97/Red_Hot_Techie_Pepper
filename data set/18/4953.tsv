2009-01-07T21:15:00.000Z	Guest33027		Does anybody know a reason why /etc/init.d may disappear???
2009-01-07T21:16:00.000Z	Guest33027		I have an installation of 8.04 server that is missing all of /etc/init.d
2009-01-07T21:17:00.000Z	Guest33027		It was working and I wanted to add a script
2009-01-07T21:17:00.000Z	Guest33027		I went to look for the directory and nothing was there
2009-01-07T21:18:00.000Z	Guest33027		I really do not recall deleting it. Any other ideas ASULutzy?
2009-01-07T21:19:00.000Z	Guest33027		The server has been running for months. We even updated from 7.10 with no problem
2009-01-07T21:21:00.000Z	Guest33027		Any way I could reinstall it without reinstalling the whole system?
2009-01-07T21:23:00.000Z	Guest33027		init.d needs to be there right? There is no other boot service system control that does not use it?
2009-01-07T21:23:00.000Z	vigo	Guest33027	That is what backups are for,,and I still have not backed this one up,,no CD-RWs or something goofy with my CD-Rom
2009-01-07T21:25:00.000Z	Guest33027	vigo	I know. I'm trying to avoid sorting out a messy collection of old back ups that may end up being useless anyhow
2009-01-07T21:25:00.000Z	vigo		Can I get World Wind from NASA for this WUBI 8.10 system?
2009-01-07T21:26:00.000Z	Guest33027		I would not mind end up with default script (which is what I had).
2009-01-07T21:28:00.000Z	vigo	Guest33027	That is a kinda backup, I like to backup rb. stuff and other neato stuff that doesn't come with the install
2009-01-07T21:31:00.000Z	Guest33027	vigo	As for as you know all possible configurations use init.d right? I just do not know if it was there when the server was first installed
2009-01-07T21:34:00.000Z	vigo	Guest33027	I would have to research that, as I am disabled it takes me time to readjust to stuff I have been away from for a while.
2009-01-07T21:36:00.000Z	vigo		This text is too tiny! I try to fix and be back
2009-01-07T21:36:00.000Z	Guest33027	vigo	I'll keep researching. Problem is I do not know if it was there to start with, but then again why cause problems know unless it has to do with an update.
2009-01-07T21:38:00.000Z	Guest33027	vigo	ASULutzy, Thank you for your time.
