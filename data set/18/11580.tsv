2006-07-09T13:07:00.000Z	erikgz		i've installed ubuntu server... x11-common, and fluxbox... how do i install startx?
2006-07-09T13:08:00.000Z	erikgz		i can't run x... using x11-common.  if it's not there then where is it???
2006-07-09T13:08:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	startx is in the "xinit" package
2006-07-09T13:09:00.000Z	erikgz	tritium	 that seems somewhat counterintuitive
2006-07-09T13:09:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	you're not performing a typical install
2006-07-09T13:10:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	typical ubuntu install, yes
2006-07-09T13:11:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	right, those from which the majority of installs are performed would be "typical"
2006-07-09T13:13:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	it happens to be a _much_ large majority
2006-07-09T13:14:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	let me check it out a bit.  give me a minute
2006-07-09T13:15:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	do you have the "xserver-xorg" package installed?  It's a meta-package with several dependencies
2006-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	erikgz	tritium	you don't have to.  i've installed xinit; running startx gives me "X: cannot stat /etc/X11/X"
2006-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	please try installing xserver-xorg, as I suggested
2006-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	erikgz	tritium	i have
2006-07-09T13:18:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	how about x-window-system-core?
2006-07-09T13:18:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	ah, okay
2006-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	erikgz	tritium	here's what confused me... when i install fluxbox why doesn't it count xserver-xorg and xinit as dependencies???
2006-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	hard to say
2006-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	tritium	erikgz	well, it rocks too ;)
