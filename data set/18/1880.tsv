2011-09-25T09:11:00.000Z	knandan		but i will take care in future
2011-09-25T09:13:00.000Z	knandan		BTW.. i am using Ubuntu 9.04/jaunty
2011-09-25T09:14:00.000Z	knandan		so..does that mean, i wont be able to install software on this?
2011-09-25T09:15:00.000Z	knandan		is that the reason why i am getting this error?
2011-09-25T09:16:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	yes, that is why you are getting those errors.  When a distro hits end of life, the repos "close".
2011-09-25T09:17:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	read the 'EOL U pgrade" part of that link
2011-09-25T09:18:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	no its not bizarre at all... do you break out your windows 3.x software, and try to install it on Win 7
2011-09-25T09:20:00.000Z	knandan	KM0201	but Ubuntu releases are quite too often...and also in case of windows the support doesnt stop so abruptly..
2011-09-25T09:21:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	it's supported for 18months... if you want longer support, use an LTS release (3yrs)
2011-09-25T09:21:00.000Z	knandan	KM0201	so..what is the way out for me..i need to have the latest ubuntu installed..?
2011-09-25T09:22:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	at this point though, the next LTS is in about 10mo, so... if you have really new hardware, installing 10.04 (the last LTS release) you might have some hardware recognition issues
2011-09-25T09:22:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	did you read the link i gave you?
2011-09-25T09:23:00.000Z	KM0201	knandan	pay particular attention to the "looking to upgrade an EOL release" link.
2011-09-25T09:23:00.000Z	knandan	KM0201	alright..
