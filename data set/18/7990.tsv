2007-10-20T22:15:00.000Z	AirBender		SpOtUb, the package is rar
2007-10-20T22:15:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	AirBender	meaning what?
2007-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	I mean, the package you want is named: rar and not rar-nonfree
2007-10-20T22:19:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	How long are you using Gutsy?
2007-10-20T22:19:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	AirBender	Few days
2007-10-20T22:20:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	and have you updated it?
2007-10-20T22:20:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	AirBender	Yes, using "Update manager" right?
2007-10-20T22:21:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	yeap, but I think that you haven't enabled all the repositories
2007-10-20T22:22:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	sype: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and tell me
2007-10-20T22:25:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	if you want to use RAR files in a transparent way,  you must install the rar package
2007-10-20T22:25:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	AirBender	# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release Candidate amd64 (20071010)]
2007-10-20T22:25:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	sorry, I havent seen you telling me you're ready
2007-10-20T22:25:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	ok
2007-10-20T22:26:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	AirBender	Im not with you! :-) I have unrar-free but how to use?
2007-10-20T22:26:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	search any line starting with the word "deb" or "deb-src" excepting the cdrom and the Backports
2007-10-20T22:26:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	then remove the #characters before the word (If ther's any # character)
2007-10-20T22:27:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	AirBender	Ill try
2007-10-20T22:28:00.000Z	AirBender	Sp0tUb	be careful with that file, remove just the "#" characters in the "deb" and "deb-src" lines
