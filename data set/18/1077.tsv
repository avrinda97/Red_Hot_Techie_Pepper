2011-06-11T05:17:00.000Z	learningc		hi, anyone knows how to create a boot cd for a non bootable usb on natty?
2011-06-11T05:18:00.000Z	learningc		because the bios does not support booting from usb, I have an old laptop on which I want to install linux from usb
2011-06-11T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	do you have a floppy drive?
2011-06-11T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	gah! http://www.pendrivelinux.com/use-a-floppy-to-boot-usb-pendrive-linux/
2011-06-11T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	I'd check the BIOS to verify what can and cannot be booted from
2011-06-11T05:22:00.000Z	learningc	ActionParsnip	basically I can boot from the internal cd drive, hdd, lan, compact flash, that's all
2011-06-11T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	cool, use compact flash instead of USB tick
2011-06-11T05:26:00.000Z	learningc	ActionParsnip	I don't have a compact flash, and I think it would be more convenient if I can get something like a boot cd to transfer the booting to the usb port, just like the boot floppy you refered earlier from the link
2011-06-11T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	why bother, you have a medium your system can boot so you may as well use it :)
2011-06-11T05:41:00.000Z	learningc	ActionParsnip	the problem is that many operating systems are bigger that 700 mb in size so I need to either hold them on a pendrive or a dvd, not a cd
2011-06-11T05:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	the Ubuntu ISO is 700Mb, thats all that matters in this channel
2011-11-22T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	minimal is quite small, if you start putting an x server on and stuff it gets a lot bigger
2011-11-22T03:28:00.000Z	learningc	ActionParsnip	the standard ubuntu desktop edition versin 11.10 I mean
2011-11-22T03:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
2011-11-22T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	my lubuntu install is little over 4Gb
2011-11-22T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	I'd go 6Gb to allow for updates
2011-11-22T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	no but it can cause you to not be able to login. I always gove 10Gb to / and use the rest for swap and /home
2012-03-25T06:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	learningc	yes, its set in screensaver and also in power options
