2012-09-04T06:37:00.000Z	Froward		hey hey hey, kids!
2012-09-04T06:38:00.000Z	Froward		so guys, I'm installing ubuntu for the first time in ages, on a laptop
2012-09-04T06:38:00.000Z	Froward		is there a specific distro I should get, or is vanilla ubuntu best?
2012-09-04T06:39:00.000Z	Froward		why?
2012-09-04T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	go with Ubuntu for now
2012-09-04T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	ubuntu is great for newcomers to linux
2012-09-04T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	both are equally stable, how much RAM do you have and what do you use your OS for?
2012-09-04T06:41:00.000Z	Froward	ActionParsnip	your standard internet/movies/email shbang, but I thought I might try to run some games in WINE
2012-09-04T06:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	how much RAM do you have?
2012-09-04T06:41:00.000Z	Froward	ActionParsnip	4GB. also, I am going to dual boot windows and want to access a NTFS data partition, does ubuntu have stable NTFS write support?
2012-09-04T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	go with 64bit then
2012-09-04T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	yes it does, but windows has zero Ext4 access at present
2012-10-22T09:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	report a bug
2012-10-22T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	you do realize that 99.99999% of users here are like you, users
2012-10-22T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	well, shouting in an IRC channel does nothing, except make you look like an ass
2012-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	reporting the bug gets lets the devs know there is an issue and can lead to fixes
2012-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	you could boot to an older kernel (if you have one) to see if it is a kernel upgrade that broke it
2012-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Froward	its cool :)
