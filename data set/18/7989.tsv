2007-10-20T22:17:00.000Z	Sp0tUb		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or

2007-10-20T22:17:00.000Z	Sp0tUb		Sorry
2007-10-20T22:17:00.000Z	Sp0tUb		But what to do?
2007-10-20T22:18:00.000Z	bruenig	Sp0tUb	there is unrar, I don't think there is a package called rar, that is not free as in beer or speech, you have to get that from the rar people themselves iirc
2007-10-20T22:18:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	bruenig	Didtn understand what you saying?
2007-10-20T22:19:00.000Z	bruenig	Sp0tUb	I don't believe there is a package called rar, there is a package called unrar which will allow extraction, but if you want rar, because it is not free, you have to get it from the rar people themselves, rarlabs or whatever it is called
2007-10-20T22:20:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	bruenig	Ahh.. But how do i unpack .rar files then?
2007-10-20T22:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Sp0tUb	get the package called unrar, and do unrar e whatever.rar
2007-10-20T22:21:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	bruenig	Ill try
2007-10-20T22:22:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	bruenig	unrar e path and filename or?
2007-10-20T22:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Sp0tUb	yeah the path too, if it is in your current directory, you obviously don't need to put a path
