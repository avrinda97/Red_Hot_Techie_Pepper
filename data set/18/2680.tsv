2010-05-09T15:26:00.000Z	rocket16		* selecting
2010-05-09T15:27:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	ext4
2010-05-09T15:27:00.000Z	rocket16	babai	Is there any error message shown?
2010-05-09T15:27:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	it says device or resource busy
2010-05-09T15:28:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	but those paritions are unmounted
2010-05-09T15:28:00.000Z	rocket16	babai	I see. Ok, did you try installing from bootup, or installing from Live? For Live mode, such problems might be there.
2010-05-09T15:29:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	i only tried to install it from the live session, i will try the installation from bootup next
2010-05-09T15:31:00.000Z	rocket16	babai	Yes, that will most possibly solve the problem. Because in case of bootup, no question of mounting partitions. But be sure to backup the data.
2010-05-09T15:31:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	i dont have nething on those partitions
2010-05-09T15:31:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	and no space left for backing up data :P
2010-05-09T15:31:00.000Z	rocket16	babai	Very well, I'm sure that will be working then, :)
2010-05-09T15:32:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	hoping for the best
2010-05-09T15:32:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	havent used ubuntu for a while, thought giving it a try
2010-05-09T15:32:00.000Z	rocket16	babai	No problem, :D Once you install Ubuntu, you have Ubuntu One, free 2 GB storage, :) There some data can be shifted, :D But it is mostly taste subjective.
2010-05-09T15:33:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	ya
2010-05-09T15:33:00.000Z	babai	rocket16	i only backup some configuration files on the cloud
2010-05-09T15:34:00.000Z	rocket16	babai	Sure, nice,
