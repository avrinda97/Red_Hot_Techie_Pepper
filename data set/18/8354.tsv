2007-09-01T15:07:00.000Z	xertux		when i install fglrx ati drivers i cant  switch higher than 1024x768 resolution, but if i recover m xserver-xorg to the orginal ati drivers i can switch all of the resolutions well,
2007-09-01T15:07:00.000Z	RoboticTao	xertux	you can manually add resolutions to the xorg.conf file

2007-09-01T15:09:00.000Z	RoboticTao	xertux	Did you add them to every line under the Display section that had resolutions?
