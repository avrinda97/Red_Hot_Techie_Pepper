2006-10-30T08:19:00.000Z	jessi		So I dont have enough room for ubuntu edgy to create the funny temp directories it normally does.
2006-10-30T08:20:00.000Z	jessi		laz, use VLC to play it.
2006-10-30T08:20:00.000Z	jessi		vlc ftw
2006-10-30T08:22:00.000Z	jessi		:/
2006-10-30T08:24:00.000Z	jessi		I am still having troubles.
2006-10-30T08:24:00.000Z	jessi		^X
2006-10-30T08:24:00.000Z	jessi		win
2006-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	jessi		It says "mkdtemp: private socket dir: no space left on device"
2006-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	jessi		hehe
2006-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	jessi		I am getting pretty upset with ubuntu. I have spent two days in only terminal.
2006-10-30T08:27:00.000Z	DonL	jessi	I go with the official stuff and I rarely have too much problem
2006-10-30T08:28:00.000Z	jessi	DonL	I partitioned incorrectly.
2006-10-30T08:28:00.000Z	DonL	jessi	I upgraded from Dapper
2006-10-30T08:28:00.000Z	jessi		:/
2006-10-30T08:28:00.000Z	jessi		That does not help me
2006-10-30T08:29:00.000Z	DonL	jessi	If you partitioned incorrectly, you did that right from the start. Hard to fix that than starting again
2006-10-30T08:29:00.000Z	jessi	DonL	that is what I suggested I do, but I dont have a disc to boot from
2006-10-30T08:30:00.000Z	DonL	jessi	can you get a friend to burn you a dapper disc?
