2008-02-20T08:27:00.000Z	jacob	bascule	i just loged into anther user and it works for that one so i have isolated it to my user does that help you any in determining the problem
2008-02-20T08:28:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	well a little, must be some .compiz config setting
2008-02-20T08:29:00.000Z	jacob	bascule	 is there somthing i can try??
2008-02-20T08:29:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	I am no compiz expert, if compiz don't know ... well
2008-02-20T08:30:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	I thought compiz was the issue ..
2008-02-20T08:31:00.000Z	jacob	bascule	 i enabled it and installed a missing package but i have used it before and no problems
2008-02-20T08:32:00.000Z	jacob	bascule	 but another thing that bothers me is i cant get to the command prompt by using ctrl alt f2 or f1
2008-02-20T08:33:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	it's an intel isn't it(?)
2008-02-20T08:34:00.000Z	jacob	bascule	 yes im using an intel core 2 duo and an intel chipset with the   x3000
2008-02-20T08:35:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	well It may not work as yet, just need to wait it out
2008-02-20T08:35:00.000Z	jacob	bascule	 i think im going to do a clean install  so i hope that fixes it
2008-02-20T08:35:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	well It might well do
2008-02-20T08:36:00.000Z	bascule	jacob	welcome, I tried but hardware is insurmountable
