2005-02-19T09:05:00.000Z	p00p		how can i get postfix to listen on eth0?
2005-02-19T09:05:00.000Z	p00p		i have a question!
2005-02-19T09:06:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	set it in main.conf?
2005-02-19T09:06:00.000Z	p00p	stuNNed	i don't know what option to set
2005-02-19T09:06:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	one sec
2005-02-19T09:13:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	you would edit master.cf
2005-02-19T09:13:00.000Z	p00p	stuNNed	what should i edit?
2005-02-19T09:15:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	see http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces
2005-02-19T09:15:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	and RTFM there.
2005-02-19T09:15:00.000Z	p00p	stuNNed	unfortunately i already did that
2005-02-19T09:18:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	is your hostname tied to your eth0 address?
2005-02-19T09:18:00.000Z	p00p	stuNNed	ah i don't believe so
2005-02-19T09:19:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	try in main.cf:  inet_interfaces = your_eth0_address where the latter is the ip of eth0
2005-02-19T09:19:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	then restart postfix
2005-02-19T09:20:00.000Z	p00p	stuNNed	that worked!
2005-02-19T09:20:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	like 'inet_interfaces = 192.168.1.106' or whatever eth0's ip is
2005-02-19T09:20:00.000Z	stuNNed	p00p	kewlios :D
2005-02-19T09:20:00.000Z	p00p	stuNNed	thanks very much
