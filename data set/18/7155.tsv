2009-01-09T21:38:00.000Z	Grab		please help
2009-01-09T21:39:00.000Z	Grab		nothing!!
2009-01-09T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	  sudo  mkfs.XXX  /dev/fd0    Perhaps.. from ages ago i rember that.
2009-01-09T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 where XXX is the proper filesystem you want to format it to
2009-01-09T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 i was just thinking how floppies are a pain.
2009-01-09T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	  and how windows is constantly asking me for 'format' my linux drives.. because it cant understand that there are other filesystems out there.
2009-01-09T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 it may not be /dev/fd0 any more.. it may be /dev/floppy or somthing.. i dont have a single floppy system to even check.
2009-01-09T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 you sure the bios even sees the thing? i had a pc with a floppy once.. but the floppy controller was disabled in bios, or the wires were backwards
2009-01-09T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 use 'sudo fdisk -l ' not just 'fdisk -l'
2009-01-09T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 ls -l /dev/fd*
2009-01-09T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 and see what exists
2009-01-09T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 its not.  go back to windows if you want..
2009-01-09T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	  yes you are...
2009-01-09T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 because it cant tell if you have an actualy floppy installed or not.
2009-01-09T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Grab	 and given how few people have them these days..
2009-01-10T04:05:00.000Z	Grab	Dr_willis	can you help me?
