2010-08-07T03:05:00.000Z	suprengr		Ubuntu /Grub question: With  10.04.1 due - Would a dual installation of 10.04 & 10.04.1 be ok on same disk - could GRUB differentiate ok?
2010-08-07T03:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 grub2 sees and adds entries for all the os's it finds for me. if i pluyg in a flash drive with 10.04 on it.. it will add it to the grub menus. :) (which can be annoying, or good)
2010-08-07T03:07:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	cheers
2010-08-07T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 apps are normally installed system wide..
2010-10-02T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 'title bar' vanishing i is proberly compiz crashing
2010-10-02T21:31:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	that makes sense... thnx
2010-10-02T21:35:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	Any ideas re the funny Nautilus behaviour... happens here on desktop & on netbook. Both since kernel update only
2010-10-02T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 no idea on that..  as for fscking the drive.  theres commands to make it fsck them at the next reboot.
2010-10-02T21:36:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	cheeres & many thanks (copies command and gets ready to reboot ;-D
2010-10-23T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 restart compiz..  or install the fusion-icon tool and it can handle compiz crashing.
2010-10-23T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 next time it does it try alt-f2 and 'compiz --replace'
2010-10-23T22:34:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	 so a compiz problem then???
2010-10-23T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 sounds like compiz crashign to me.
2010-10-23T22:34:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	 cheers & thanks a lot.
2010-11-15T00:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	  LTS is more of a concern to businesses and so forth worried about security.
2010-11-15T00:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	suprengr	 i imagine any security issues will get updated in une also since the repos are the same.
2010-11-15T00:57:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	thanks - that was also the supposition I was working on.
2010-11-15T01:02:00.000Z	suprengr	Dr_Willis	[reason for my question was... I have convinced sister to switch to UNE on her netbook & had recommended she let me put Lynx UNE on it to replace dead system she has atm... my ears were getting worried  re the pan when she found UNE died earlier than I  promised].  Thanks again - my ears feel safer already ;)
