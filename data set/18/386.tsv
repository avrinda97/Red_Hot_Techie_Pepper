2012-03-22T23:56:00.000Z	mcb_	Zehle	Is that an log from Apache? All those "\xf6\" are strings passed in Hex form. If it is an apache log problably someone is trying to do some nasty thing......
2012-03-22T23:57:00.000Z	Zehle	mcb_	Cryptotheslow:Thanks for the answers! Yes it's an Apache log!
2012-03-22T23:58:00.000Z	mcb_	Zehle	Seens like someone is tring to pass commands to your system. Normaly it is not for the good.
2012-03-22T23:59:00.000Z	Zehle	mcb_	okey I see :/ How to prevent it? How to protect yourself? :)
2012-03-23T00:00:00.000Z	mcb_	Zehle	 Best bet for me would to idenfy the IP of who is trying it and then block it with Iptables.
2012-03-23T00:02:00.000Z	mcb_	Zehle	As i saw in the log, i is comming from a lot of diferent IPs.
2012-03-23T00:03:00.000Z	mcb_	Zehle	Are you using an CMS, Joomla, Wordpress? If so, try to update as fast as you can, and never forget to backup.
2012-03-23T00:04:00.000Z	Zehle	mcb_	My friend says that he doesn't use Joomla or wordpress and he doesn√§t know what CMS is
