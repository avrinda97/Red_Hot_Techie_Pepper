2007-01-29T17:50:00.000Z	genii		you may find a 2k/XP bootdisk with the fixmbr utility at www.bootdisk.com
2007-01-29T06:00:00.000Z	genii		what is this "hg" command supposed to do? Google shows no man pages for it which makes me think it is someones custom script or so
2007-01-29T06:02:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	you're probably correct. can't find "hg" in my system
2007-01-29T06:02:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	"cat" the script and see what it does
2007-01-29T06:04:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	so find it. "whereis hg"
2007-01-29T06:05:00.000Z	genii	Jowi	I already did an updatedb && locate hg with no result for that command. Hence I say no hg command on my system which to cat and find out the contents of
2007-01-29T06:06:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	if it is not in your system, why are you asking?
2007-01-29T06:11:00.000Z	genii	Jowi	zoli2k> in which package can I find the hg command?
2007-01-29T06:15:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	I have no idea as I said - I can't find any reference for it. if you don't know what it is, why do you need it?
2007-01-29T06:16:00.000Z	genii	Jowi	As I just pasted to you, another user named zoli2k was asking what package contained it.
2007-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	hehe, ok. I think your conclusion was correct :)
2007-01-29T06:42:00.000Z	genii	Jowi	nice work there
2007-03-29T13:25:00.000Z	genii	Jowi	 Thanks for the clarification :)
2007-09-13T08:13:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	not changed, but spoofed
2007-09-13T08:13:00.000Z	genii	Jowi	Ah OK
2007-09-13T08:13:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	so you're right :)
2007-09-13T08:14:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	even some dsl-routers support spoofing MAC address.
2007-09-13T08:15:00.000Z	Jowi	genii	there you go
