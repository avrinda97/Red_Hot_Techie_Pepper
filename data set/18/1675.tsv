2010-12-30T03:26:00.000Z	Russia		Hi all
2010-12-30T03:26:00.000Z	Russia		2 days ago, I installed ubuntu onto my hard drive
2010-12-30T03:26:00.000Z	Russia		I upgraded to 10.10 yesterday, and I also run Windows 7
2010-12-30T03:28:00.000Z	Russia		I was just on Win7, and went to boot onto ubuntu. However, now I cannot, since my computer can't find either operating system
2010-12-30T03:29:00.000Z	Sergey_IT	Russia	join #ubuntu-ru
2010-12-30T03:29:00.000Z	Russia	Sergey_IT	I'm not russia
2010-12-30T03:29:00.000Z	Sergey_IT	Russia	sorry )
2010-12-30T04:03:00.000Z	Sergey_IT	Russia	may be you need to reinstall grub from liveCD
2010-12-30T04:03:00.000Z	Russia	Sergey_IT	Can  you tell me how to do that?
2010-12-30T04:05:00.000Z	Russia	Sergey_IT	If I have 10.10 on my HDD, would it matter if it was a 10.04 LTS liveCD?

2010-12-30T04:08:00.000Z	Russia	Sergey_IT	Big risks involved, I'm assuming?
2010-12-30T04:10:00.000Z	Russia	Sergey_IT	Would it be ok if the liveCD i have is ubuntu 10.04?
2010-12-30T04:10:00.000Z	Sergey_IT	Russia	better to use 10.10 CD, but i'm not shure
2010-12-30T04:11:00.000Z	Russia	Sergey_IT	If I'm not mistaken, 10.10 and 10.04 LTS bot use grub2
2010-12-30T04:12:00.000Z	Sergey_IT	Russia	yes, fnd there is special recovery disks for repaire grub
