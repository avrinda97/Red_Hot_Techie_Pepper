2008-05-19T12:00:00.000Z	cypha		what if another program has a mci problem too?
2008-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	cypha		in fact, when i run amarok, and i press the X to send it to the system tray, i get some sound error and cannot hear sound from there on, until i restart
2008-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	cypha		i dunno if that's related to my mic problem (while my sound is working)
2008-05-19T12:02:00.000Z	pestkam	cypha	i can send my /etc/apt/soururses.list on your e-mail.
