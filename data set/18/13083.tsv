2006-08-07T09:42:00.000Z	Pjott		This is getting uncomfortable, and I've written this question 3-4 times now. Sorry for the repeat, but the question is out of the screens resolution :P
2006-08-07T09:42:00.000Z	Pjott		Why can't I write "@" ? :S I'm from Norway, my keyboard is set to "Norwegian" etc.
2006-08-07T09:43:00.000Z	Pjott		hmmm
2006-08-07T09:43:00.000Z	__mikem	Pjott	what happens when you try to type "@"
2006-08-07T09:45:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	Nothing happens
2006-08-07T09:46:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	It's like it isn't a registred adress :/
2006-08-07T09:46:00.000Z	__mikem	Pjott	are you sure the key you are typing is mapped to the @ sign
2006-08-07T09:46:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	welcome to my problem! :D
2006-08-07T09:47:00.000Z	__mikem	Pjott	havint no experience with other keyboard layouts, I can only tell you to make sure your keyboard layout is set correctly
2006-08-07T09:48:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	Welcome to the biggest problem. When trying to change it to my Logitech, I get an error...
2006-08-07T09:49:00.000Z	__mikem	Pjott	is that word for word?
2006-08-07T09:50:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	It's Norwegian you know
2006-08-07T09:55:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	root@cm-84:/home/pjott# sudo dpkg-reconfigure xmodmap
2006-08-07T09:57:00.000Z	__mikem	Pjott	did that fix it?
2006-08-07T09:57:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	nope :S
2006-08-07T10:02:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	The keyboard-crap still does not work :/
2006-08-07T10:05:00.000Z	__mikem	Pjott	I really can't help you then. I have never tried to do what you are doing
2006-08-07T10:05:00.000Z	Pjott	__mikem	That's OK.
