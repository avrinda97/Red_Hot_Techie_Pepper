2010-10-04T08:29:00.000Z	iVIM2	icarus-c	pm-suspend automatically?
2010-10-04T08:29:00.000Z	icarus-c	iVIM2	i haven't tried but
2010-10-04T08:30:00.000Z	iVIM2	icarus-c	daemond process sleepd maybe can't do the thing.
2010-10-04T08:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	iVIM2	oh iirc laptop-mode-tools has that function configured
2010-10-04T08:31:00.000Z	iVIM2	icarus-c	I also installed laptop-mode-tools by tasksel
2010-10-04T08:32:00.000Z	iVIM2	icarus-c	GNOME can manage these,but I want to manage them in CLI
