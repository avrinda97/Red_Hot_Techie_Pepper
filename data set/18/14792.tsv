2005-08-01T15:11:00.000Z	Zukero		anyone here uses ubuntu with enlightenment (E16) ?
2005-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	Zukero		because
2005-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	Zukero		yeah
2005-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	Zukero		it doesn't generate the gnome and epplets menu
2005-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	Zukero		it does nicely under debian
2005-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	Zukero		but
2005-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	Zukero		the gnome menus under debian and ubuntu are a little different
2005-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	Zukero		so maybe
2005-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	Zukero		E cannot find it
2005-08-01T15:14:00.000Z	Zukero		i was wondering if someone managed to have these menus (especially the gnome one)
2005-08-01T15:15:00.000Z	poningru	Zukero	what are you trying to do?
2005-08-01T15:16:00.000Z	poningru		is it in the application menu or the places/system menu?
2005-08-01T15:17:00.000Z	Zukero	poningru	: I just want to have the Gnome menu in E16
2005-08-01T15:17:00.000Z	Zukero		both
2005-08-01T15:17:00.000Z	Zukero		but rather the application
2005-08-01T15:17:00.000Z	Zukero		the one that is normally automaticalyy generated by E
2005-08-01T15:17:00.000Z	poningru		!smeg
2005-08-01T15:18:00.000Z	poningru	Zukero	have you looked into that?
