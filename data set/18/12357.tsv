2006-04-29T10:01:00.000Z	Pmafia		if I didnt have any inernet? i would be screwed as far as performing my options?
2006-04-29T10:02:00.000Z	Pmafia		i think windows has better functionality without internet
2006-04-29T10:02:00.000Z	Pmafia		because all the main install comands that i know of are apt-get which are dependant on the internet
2006-04-29T10:03:00.000Z	Pmafia		a unattendant install does...
2006-04-29T10:04:00.000Z	Pmafia		ok ok im getting it.......
2006-04-29T10:04:00.000Z	Pmafia		so before you use apt-get you have to make an entry in the source.list
2006-04-29T10:05:00.000Z	Pmafia		meaning whatever you set in source.list the file can be anywhere, harddrive? cdrom? website, ect...
2006-04-29T10:05:00.000Z	Pmafia		okay.........now where getting somewhere lol
2006-04-29T10:07:00.000Z	Pmafia		in the terminal i type cat /ect/apt/ect,,,,
2006-04-29T10:08:00.000Z	Pmafia		where do i type that?
2006-04-29T10:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	your terminal
2006-04-29T09:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	dpkg -i foo.deb
2006-04-29T10:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	it's the same apt-get, but sources.list has an entry for the cd or dvd
2006-04-29T10:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	sources.list should come already populated with the standard entries
2006-04-29T10:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	"cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
2006-04-29T10:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	no, cat is an app that does this:  cat (1)              - concatenate files and print on the standard output
2006-04-29T10:09:00.000Z	Pmafia	eyequeue	you should make it simplier like linux_galore does lol
2006-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	Pmafia	that is not my output, that is the standard output from "whatis cat"
