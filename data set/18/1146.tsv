2011-08-13T18:59:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	Arch support is in #archlinux
2011-08-13T19:00:00.000Z	amin`	theadmin	Yes I know but the ubuntu is the only one with the same problem mines the UUID part and archiz send me here please help
2011-08-13T19:00:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	I can't help, and most of people here don't use Arch so honestly dunno
2011-08-13T19:01:00.000Z	amin`	theadmin	^^
2011-08-13T19:02:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	I don't know how to fix it on Ubuntu either (if I'd know at all, I'd likely know how to fix it on Arch, actually)
2011-08-13T19:02:00.000Z	amin`	theadmin	So help plzzzzzzz
2011-08-13T19:03:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	As stated, I don't know.
2011-08-15T18:20:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	If you have Arch, you just modify the DAEMONS=() array in rc.conf. As for Ubuntu, "man update-rc.d"
2011-08-15T18:20:00.000Z	amin`	theadmin	how about inittab?
2011-08-15T18:21:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	Got nothing to do with inittab.
2011-08-15T18:22:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	And, ThinkT510 is right. Arch uses a BSD-style SystemD boot system. It's TOTALLY different, and Ubuntu people will *not* be able to help you with that.
2011-08-15T18:22:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	Go to #archlinux
2011-08-15T18:22:00.000Z	amin`	theadmin	again sorry
2011-08-15T18:24:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	Sooo? You're not asking for lightdm help
2011-08-15T18:25:00.000Z	theadmin	amin`	You're asking for systemd help, which is not only *not* an Ubuntu project, but even totally unsupported in Ubuntu.
2011-08-15T18:25:00.000Z	amin`	theadmin	you mean for inittab option i need systemd installed
