2006-01-17T15:04:00.000Z	Stork		hi, i'm having huge problems with ubuntu. i was playing quake4 and it just crashed, so i had to do a manual restart, then i re-loaded, quake4 wouldn't run, neither would xmms, so i do another manual restart and xserver doesn't run.

I think i'm going to install kde and see if that helps

2006-01-17T15:09:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 What kind of errors does it generate when X tries to start?
2006-01-17T15:09:00.000Z	Stork	mitrovarr	i don't know, it freezes before i can do anything
2006-01-17T15:11:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 does it bring you to the graphical login screen?
2006-01-17T15:11:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 When you boot up, I mean, or does it crash before then?
2006-01-17T15:11:00.000Z	Stork	mitrovarr	i get the loading ubuntu screen, then it all goes black and i have to restart
2006-01-17T15:12:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 That sounds bad.  I think it's probably beyond my ability to fix.  But one thing that might help is to switch desktops away from the graphical bootup screen so you can see what step it fails on
2006-01-17T15:12:00.000Z	Stork	mitrovarr	yeah, i think i'm done with computers now
2006-01-17T15:13:00.000Z	Stork	mitrovarr	i just lost a good weeks worth of source code + quake4 saved games
2006-01-17T15:13:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 It sounds like it might have done something bad to your hard drive, maybe the drive failing is what caused it in the first place
2006-01-17T15:13:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 It's certainly worth taking the hard drive out and trying to read it on another machine to see if it's really hashed or if the linux install just got wrecked
2006-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	Stork	mitrovarr	i can run as root easily
2006-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 Oh.  Well, I'm kind of at a loss, then.
2006-01-17T15:15:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 I thought it might be something easy, like a problem with the .ICEauthority file like I always have
2006-01-17T15:40:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Stork	 You might need to manually mount the CD.  Can you browse it?
