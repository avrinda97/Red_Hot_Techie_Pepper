2008-02-27T16:05:00.000Z	Asathoor		how can I use restricted drivers with a Radeon card?
2008-02-27T16:05:00.000Z	Asathoor		Radeon x2600
2008-02-27T16:05:00.000Z	Asathoor		I cannot use the restricted drivers GUI
2008-02-27T16:06:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	why not?
2008-02-27T16:07:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	open a terminal and run gksudo restricted-manager at the prompt
2008-02-27T16:08:00.000Z	Asathoor	kalatian	>> ok, I'll try
2008-02-27T16:09:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	how new is this computer, and is it a laptop or desktop?
2008-02-27T16:09:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	desktop?
2008-02-27T16:10:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	sorry, is the computer a desktop or a laptop?
2008-02-27T16:10:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	I'm thinking that the graphics card might be newer then the ATI driver, so it isn't detected
2008-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	let me check real quick
2008-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	Asathoor	kalatian	>> yes, the driver says vesa, maybe I should change xorg.conf to ati?
2008-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	you can try that
2008-02-27T16:12:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	also try http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_Guide method 1 and then switch vesa to fglrx
2008-02-27T16:12:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	wait
2008-02-27T16:12:00.000Z	Asathoor	kalatian	>> thanx
2008-02-27T16:12:00.000Z	kalatian	Asathoor	won't work if the card is too new -- try method 2
2008-02-27T16:13:00.000Z	Asathoor	kalatian	>> I'll look into it and try method 2
