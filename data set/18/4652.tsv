2009-03-08T15:37:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	(joining in late, sorry if this has been covered) did you try to run the media-check on the same HW that you're having the trouble on? You say the MD5 is OK but scrolling sr0 errors sounds a lot like trouble reading the media. I'm thinking the CD or the drive is dodgy.
2009-03-08T15:44:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	if the errors occur during boot-up (i.e. before you log on) then the "> file" trick probably won't work.
2009-03-08T15:45:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	if the system gets as far as booting then "dmesg" wight bring the messages back. Failing that, check /var/log/messages
2009-03-08T15:46:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	just to recap... the CD works with identical HW (at a friends place) but you get sr0 media errors when you try to use it on your system?
2009-03-08T15:47:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	the only thing I can tink of is that your CD drive is dodgy. If the CD works at your friends place, and the HW is identical (i.e. no driver problems) then all that's left is the drive (or maybe RAM.... run the mem-checker?)
2009-03-08T15:48:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	can you swap out the drive with another one? Can you BIOS boot off external CD Drive?
2009-03-08T15:48:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	sprinkmeier_	yes, this is latest DP45SG intel original motherboard ..
2009-03-08T15:49:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	sprinkmeier_	yes
2009-03-08T15:50:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	sprinkmeier_	 plus md5 signature i just checked matches, there is no issue with downloads what so ever, i think all these 7 cds that i labelled BAD are good too .. there seems to be some other issue here
2009-03-08T15:50:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	how certain are you that the whole CD is readable from windows? can you run a checksum on it (no idea how to do that from windows...) Can you run RAM checker off the disk (just in case)? This is the MD5 checksum of the ISO file, not off the disk?
2009-03-08T15:52:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	sprinkmeier_	ya, the MD5 checksum is of the downloaded iso image which matches, and i have no idea how do the cd checking and ram checking thing [ i am a finance related guy :) ]
2009-03-08T15:52:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	XP or vista? IIRC vista has a RAM-checker option from the boot-loader. Failing that, boot off the CD and choose the RAM checking option (let's hopt it gets tat far :-)
2009-03-08T15:54:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	ubuntu one. I don't think that the XP install CD has a RAM checker (FWIW I think the vista one does)
2009-03-08T15:55:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	RAM checker runs until you stop it. let it do at least one complete run, should take >> 10 mins
2009-03-08T15:56:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	if ubuntu CD fails, maybe try ultimate boot cd: http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
2009-03-08T15:57:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	"both tests" == "media check" and "ram check"?
2009-03-08T15:58:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	sprinkmeier_	ya .. will run both and get back here
2009-03-08T15:58:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	wanttotryubuntu	close to bed-time here, might not be here when you get back. Best of luck, welcome to Ubuntu!
