2008-10-26T15:09:00.000Z	shesek		and set up the partitions manually
2008-10-26T15:09:00.000Z	shesek		because.. well, it should work
2008-10-26T15:10:00.000Z	shesek		should I let it set up partitions on its own, or DIY?
2008-10-26T15:10:00.000Z	shesek		well, DIM
2008-10-26T15:10:00.000Z	shesek		what guide, the wiki ?
2008-10-26T15:11:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	if you are having issues let the installer do the job, it's usualy safer
2008-10-26T15:11:00.000Z	shesek	Pelo	I had issues when I let it do the job
2008-10-26T15:12:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	well if you do it manualy , make sure you have a partition for swap
2008-10-26T15:12:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	you can try making the partitons before you start the installer, gparted is available in the system>admin menu
2008-10-26T15:13:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	use all primary partitions unless you absolutely need to have more the 4 partitions
2008-10-26T15:14:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	??
2008-10-26T15:14:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	start at the beginning of the hdd
2008-10-26T15:15:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	this setup works well for me ,  10 gig for /, 2x RAM for swap at the end of the HDD, and the rest for /home
2008-10-26T15:17:00.000Z	shesek	Pelo	I don't need a /boot partition ?
2008-10-26T15:17:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	not specificaly ,
2008-10-26T15:18:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	you will need to flag one partiton as boot however if that is what you meant ,  the / one usualy
2008-10-26T15:19:00.000Z	Pelo	shesek	max at 1 gig in your case
