2004-09-30T09:44:00.000Z	hermes88		hey, anyone have some weird mouse problems with Ubuntu?  like single-clicks being interpreted as double-clicks?
2004-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	yes, known bug
2004-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	remove "Generic Mouse" and all references to it from /etc/X11/XF86Config
2004-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	that will fix it
2004-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	you'll have to restart X of course after changing the config file
2004-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	:D
2004-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	hermes88	Adonijah	what should I replace "Generic Mouse" with?
2004-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	nothing
2004-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	trash it
2004-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	"configured mouse" should be there already
2004-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	and should be the "correct" entry for it to use
2004-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	you should be able to logout of X after making the change
2004-09-30T09:48:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	and then do a ctrl-backspace to kill the server and restart it
2004-09-30T09:48:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	er...ctrl-alt-backspace
2004-09-30T09:48:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	yes, and you'll have to remove the reference to it at the bottom of the file in the serverlayout section as well
2004-09-30T09:55:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	only if the path I imported from isn't mounted when I boot already
2004-09-30T09:55:00.000Z	Adonijah	hermes88	otherwise, no
2004-09-30T09:56:00.000Z	hermes88	Adonijah	maybe it was a one-time glitch or something.  i'll reboot later and test it out
