2011-12-23T05:44:00.000Z	d1g1ta11		can someone please help me fix laptop not hibernating on battery low (battery runs out & it shuts down)
2011-12-23T05:44:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	how old is the battery?
2011-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	it sounds like a damaged battery.
2011-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	 it's giving me a couple of hours, which is what I would expect.  and the battery gauge shows roughly the correct usage %ages.  it just doesn't hibernate.  it goes to 0% and shuts down.
2011-12-23T05:46:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	looks OK
2011-12-23T05:46:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	system settings> power> when power is critically low hibernate.
2011-12-23T05:47:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	yes, that's what it's set to
2011-12-23T05:47:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	but, it's not working.  I've vaguely recall someone saying there is a problem on some laptops with gnome power mgmt...
2011-12-23T05:47:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	how many cycles on your batter
2011-12-23T05:48:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	but, I think there is a fix, I think something needs to be modified
2011-12-23T05:48:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	I don't think so, b.c it goes from 100% to 0% and then shuts down about 5 mins later
2011-12-23T05:49:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	iow, that's what I would expect if hibernate wasn''t working but the battery meter was
2011-12-23T05:50:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	that is a weird issue. I remember there was a power drain issue.
2011-12-23T05:51:00.000Z	d1g1ta11	someguy	do u remember what it was exactly and how to fix it?  it's been so long, I can't recall
2011-12-23T05:52:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	I'm looking for the resolution if I can find it.

2011-12-23T06:24:00.000Z	someguy	d1g1ta11	that's what I was meant when I first mentioned the percentages. I should have elaborated.
