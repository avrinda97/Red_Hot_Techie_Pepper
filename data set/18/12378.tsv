2010-07-30T20:53:00.000Z	dayz		does anyone know how to check the latency timing of the RAM on my laptop?
2010-07-30T20:54:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	 you could run the live cd and choose "Check memory"  option
2010-07-30T20:55:00.000Z	dayz	coz_	can I use some tool without using the live cd?
2010-07-30T20:56:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	 also ...I believe  if you sudo apt-get install  i2c-tools  and then run  sudo modprobe eeprom   then decode-dimms
2010-07-30T20:56:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	 not sure that will work but still searching so hold on
2010-07-30T20:56:00.000Z	dayz	coz_	I tried that, but it tells me "Number of SDRAM DIMMs detected and decoded: 0"
2010-07-30T20:57:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	  not sure but try     sudo dmidecode
2010-07-30T20:58:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	   or maybe   http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/tlb.8.html
2010-07-30T20:59:00.000Z	dayz	coz_	that worked
2010-07-30T20:59:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	  which one?
2010-07-30T20:59:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	  dmidecode?
2010-07-30T20:59:00.000Z	dayz	coz_	yep
2010-07-30T21:00:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	 kinda figured... dmidecode which give a bunch of info withouth the need for installing anything else :)
2010-07-30T21:00:00.000Z	dayz	coz_	the reason I'm checking is because I want to get a new stick of RAM to be used with my current stick. It seems to say that my current stick is of speed 667mhz. does that mean even if my new stick runs at 800mhz, I'll just get 667mhz of performance?
2010-07-30T21:01:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	  the better way is to shut down... take the stick of memory out...either check the numbers on the stick itself or take it a reputable dealer to find another matching stick
2010-07-30T21:01:00.000Z	coz_	dayz	 or simply check motherboard spcs and see what it can handle in terms of memory
2010-07-30T21:02:00.000Z	dayz	coz_	ok. thanks.
