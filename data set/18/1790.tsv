2012-07-01T01:13:00.000Z	andrewaclt		I've undeleted files on ext3 before by grepping through the raw disk image
2012-07-01T01:14:00.000Z	andrewaclt		like in the xs4all.nl link
2012-07-01T01:14:00.000Z	shaneo	andrewaclt	im gonna give foremost a try and see what it can get back for me
2012-07-01T01:14:00.000Z	shaneo		the folder i deleted only had symlinks in it but when i rm the dir it removed original files as well

2012-07-01T01:16:00.000Z	andrewaclt	shaneo	documented here http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=7&topic=symlink
2012-07-01T01:17:00.000Z	andrewaclt	shaneo	"The rm command operates on the symbolic link, and not the file it references, and therefore never follows a symbolic link."
