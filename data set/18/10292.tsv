2006-12-24T10:35:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	Should one do that?
2006-12-24T10:36:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	Yes, everyone should know how to receive morse code!
2006-12-24T10:36:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	:)
2006-12-24T10:37:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	  .-.
2006-12-24T10:40:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	how do you expect to get work done, hanging out in a chat room? The OS doesn't seem to be the issue. ;)
2006-12-24T10:40:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	I sad mind on a christmas eve, can only do so much
2006-12-24T10:47:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	no pain, no gain.
2006-12-24T10:47:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	So much pain, when is there going to be any gain?
2006-12-24T10:48:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	your not aware of it yet, but you are gaining. You'll never have to buy new software, no?
2006-12-24T10:48:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	That is if all this works
2006-12-24T10:49:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	It works, I've been using linux for six years, and I've been Windows FREE, for three years.
2006-12-24T10:49:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	I wish i could do that
2006-12-24T10:50:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	your on the right path.
2006-12-24T10:50:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	LjL: as i said, i am re-formatting everything, any advice one i get get a clean machine, to avoid me falling into this mental dilemma and instability?
2006-12-24T10:51:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	what's your plan, dual boot, or straight Ubuntu?
2006-12-24T10:52:00.000Z	ken0	n2diy	straight ubuntu, although i am drifting away from that especially after my present experience ( atpresent this is a ubuntu only machine)
2006-12-24T10:52:00.000Z	n2diy	ken0	ok, but if you want Winders, install it first.
