2010-11-06T16:51:00.000Z	tomguest		i am working with fortran code on a external hard drive in 10.10 and it now says "permission denied" when i try to run ./a.out...this worked fine in all previous version of ubuntu I have used...thanks
2010-11-06T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 wht filesystem is the external hd?
2010-11-06T16:52:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	i believe it's fat32...is there an easy way to check in linux?
2010-11-06T16:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 check mount output. You proberly need to mount it with the proper options. then everything will be 'executable' on it.. which can be an annoyance.
2010-11-06T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 you may want to do your development on a ubuntu/linux filesystem. ive had odd quirks with keeping code on vfat/fat/ntfs
2010-11-06T16:54:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	It's just that I work on computers in two different locations so I like having the hard drive as a go between
2010-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	also is it strange that this works fine using 10.04 on my laptop?
2010-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 chedk fstab.. perhaps you got different options.
2010-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 or the  systems are set to use diffrent default optuions.
2010-11-06T16:56:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	is the command just "fstab"?
2010-11-06T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 fstab is the config file. :) You may want to run the 'ntfs-config' program and check some of the options.
2010-11-06T16:59:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	when i run ntfs-config only my windows partition shows up
2010-11-06T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 there should be some  check box;s covering external media also.
2010-11-06T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 what ubuntu version are you on right now?
2010-11-06T17:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 you culd make a custom fstab entry for the thing. and just mount/unmount it as needed and not use the automounting feature.
2010-11-06T17:01:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	okay, why does 10.10 make this harder?
2010-11-06T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tomguest	 never noticed.. then again. i never use executables from vfat/ntfs...
2010-11-06T17:04:00.000Z	tomguest	Dr_Willis	okay, thank you for this help...I think I'll have to deal with this issue when I have more time
