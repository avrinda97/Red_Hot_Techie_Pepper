2007-12-13T02:08:00.000Z	Lordlarm	sionide21	remount (?) howto
2007-12-13T02:09:00.000Z	sionide21	Lordlarm	I'm not positive but I believe 'mount -o remount,rw /' should do it
2007-12-13T02:10:00.000Z	Lordlarm		okey. well, hmm, maybe I can.. just tried the command sudo nano /etc/kboot.confbackup ...
2007-12-13T02:10:00.000Z	Lordlarm		how to I chmod it?
2007-12-13T02:19:00.000Z	Lordlarm		how to I chmod a file from kboot .. from read-only filesystem to edit. i have to change the kboot.conf file
2007-12-13T02:22:00.000Z	sionide21		Is there a log of this channel somewhere?
2007-12-13T02:23:00.000Z	sionide21		How about ##java?
2007-12-13T02:26:00.000Z	Lordlarm		how can I change a file in kboot with only read-only filesystem?
2007-12-13T02:26:00.000Z	Lordlarm		anyone?
2007-12-13T02:28:00.000Z	sionide21		LordLarm: you cannot edit files in a readonly file system. you have to remount it read/write. To do this use the command 'mount -o remount,rw /'
