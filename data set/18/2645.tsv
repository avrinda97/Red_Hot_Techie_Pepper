2010-03-29T06:43:00.000Z	britters		hello, I install ubuntu on my dell inspiron to try and get more life out of it, and I bought a wireless adapter from fry's (like bestbuy) but for some reason its not being recognized at all.   I'm not sure what driver I should use, it's showing up in lsusb as Dlink systems
2010-03-29T06:44:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	for the internet?
2010-03-29T06:44:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	correct
2010-03-29T06:45:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	plug it in you should get an icon appear on your desktop i assume your using 9.10
2010-03-29T06:45:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	no 10.04
2010-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	ah i t should work anyway plug it in you should get an icon appear on screen right click it and select eject
2010-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	even though it is scheduled for release, i use gentoo normally but didnt want to go through the hassle with this machine.  How would i figure out the proper driver
2010-03-29T06:47:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	no dice. its not showing up there.
2010-03-29T06:47:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	if you got it from frys it probably came with windows software on a disk install wine and use it that way
2010-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	not open software.
2010-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	any other ideas?
2010-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	sorry cant help you lol??? ill keep thinking
2010-03-29T06:53:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	it seems like a rebranded lower tier 11g card, but on windows it shows up as 11n adapter.   regardless the first 4 digits of its ID are DLink cards, but it didnt match any of the second 4
2010-03-29T06:54:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	im really not sure lol im new to karmic myself i just know a little about wireless card because mine was messing about at first
2010-03-29T06:55:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	well i guess being on lucid doesn't help.  I know that card works I tested it on Win7 but I guess for now I could just use the garbage that is Ndiswrapper
2010-03-29T06:56:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	like blakkheim said lucid hasn't been released yet
2010-03-29T06:56:00.000Z	britters	billy189589566	I know im just saying that it shouldnt be much harder to figure out what type of driver i need for it.
2010-03-29T06:57:00.000Z	billy189589566	britters	yeah lol
