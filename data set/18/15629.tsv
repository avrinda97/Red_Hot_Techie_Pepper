2005-03-28T16:02:00.000Z	membreya		hey there guys, whats the easiest way to find out what port a webpage is being served on ?
2005-03-28T16:04:00.000Z	membreya		or can say secure webpages ONLY be served from port 443?
2005-03-28T16:04:00.000Z	sabmoc	membreya	i thought secure pages are supposed to port 81
2005-03-28T16:07:00.000Z	membreya	sabmoc	for example the page I wanted to find out info on ...WAS on port 443 :)
2005-03-28T16:08:00.000Z	sabmoc	membreya	google for ports and find whats supposed to be on port 443

2005-04-01T14:22:00.000Z	sabmoc	membreya	welcome to my world
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	membreya	sabmoc	gmailfs is fine and dandy for those that can get it working
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	sabmoc	membreya	I didnt really find gmailfs that useful when I had it, I just like gmail as my email client
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	sabmoc	membreya	yeah, i love the interface
