2010-10-15T19:53:00.000Z	mikebeecham		hi guys..>I'm trying to set a static IP in 10.10, but struggling...can anyone help?
2010-10-15T19:54:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	what are you trying to do?
2010-10-15T19:54:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	set my ubuntu machine to use a static IP address
2010-10-15T19:55:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	by using network manager or editing /etc/network/interfaces?
2010-10-15T19:55:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	I have opted for 'Manual', and I have entered the IP address I want, the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and also the gateway
2010-10-15T19:57:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	can you access any machine by *name* ?
2010-10-15T19:57:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	what do you mean?
2010-10-15T19:57:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	what did you put in the "DNS servers:" box?
2010-10-15T19:57:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	the DNS server IP addresses?
2010-10-15T19:58:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	can you access the other machines by name, or only by ip address ?
2010-10-15T19:59:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	can you do, for instance, ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2010-10-15T19:59:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	sorry, you're confusing me...I'm not trying to access other machines, although I can already..nothing has changed there
2010-10-15T19:59:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	good point...cannot ping another machine
2010-10-15T20:00:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	with the IP address or with name?
2010-10-15T20:00:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	are you sure you have set the address, netmask, gateway correctly?
2010-10-15T20:01:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Drakeson	nope...thats why I'm here!
2010-10-15T20:03:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	you should know what IP address you want to assign to your machine, if you want to use static IP. netmask is often 255.255.255.0 at homes, and gateway is probably the IP address of your router, e.g. 192.168.1.1
2010-10-15T20:03:00.000Z	Drakeson	mikebeecham	but you probably know all that.
