2006-03-08T11:54:00.000Z	majd		would someone be kind enough to show me how to setup my ports for Azureus? i can't figure it out...i went to 192.168.1.1 and setup 6880 to 7000 for Azureus and enabled it, but when i test port 6890, i get NAT error...i've read the docs...didn't help
2006-03-08T11:56:00.000Z	majd		i also tried setting up the ports from 6881 to 6881 (using BOTH as the protocol) and got the NAT error again
2006-03-08T11:57:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	6881 is often blocked by ISPs now.  Try another port?
2006-03-08T12:01:00.000Z	majd	Q_Continuum	my ip is totally different
2006-03-08T12:02:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	change the IP for the port forward then to 71.
2006-03-08T12:04:00.000Z	majd	Q_Continuum	correct
2006-03-08T12:04:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	Ok.  pull up a console, and type in ifconfig
2006-03-08T12:04:00.000Z	majd	Q_Continuum	 ok...
2006-03-08T12:05:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	the IP you listed above is your public-facing IP.  You are behind a router, so you've got your own, different IP.
2006-03-08T12:05:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	whatever the last octet (x.x.x.XXX) is what we want.
2006-03-08T12:06:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	so put 102 in the box where it currently has the 1
2006-03-08T12:07:00.000Z	majd	Q_Continuum	oh i see....thanks for the information and the help..
2006-03-08T12:07:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	not a problem, glad to help.
2006-03-08T12:09:00.000Z	majd	Q_Continuum	NAT used to be red, after i fixed it, just says Firewalled
2006-03-08T12:10:00.000Z	majd	Q_Continuum	7000
2006-03-08T12:10:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	I'd change the port to something in the 49,000 range, something random works, change it in Azureus then also in the Linksys router.  Most of those don't get blocked up there.

2006-03-08T12:12:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	majd	I'm running off for food, I'll be back at some point.  I know there's some more info on the Azureus homepage/wiki on how to resolve that issue, if you continue to get stuck.
