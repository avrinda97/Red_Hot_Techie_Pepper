2008-08-13T15:36:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	seems like one of the package's maintainer script is broken. Try creating an user called 'nx' yourself
2008-08-13T15:37:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	user in nxserver or on ubuntu?
2008-08-13T15:38:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	Ubuntu (but a system user, no need for home dir and such)
2008-08-13T15:39:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	so just sudo adduser NX ?
2008-08-13T15:39:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	ok, so just sudo adduser nx ??
2008-08-13T15:40:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	look at the messages you posted - it says 'nx' there
2008-08-13T15:40:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	sudo adduser --system nx
2008-08-13T15:43:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	Ok, i have created, the user is that all i have to do?
2008-08-13T15:43:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	from what I can see, yes
2008-08-13T15:46:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	you're welcome :). Does it work now?
2008-08-13T15:46:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	have to wait and see !
2008-08-13T15:51:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	it says later on in the instructions that i need to go to sudo nano /usr/NX/home/nx/.ssh/sshd_config which does not exist
2008-08-13T15:53:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	where are those instructions?
2008-08-13T15:54:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2007/10/15/how-to-install-nx-server-and-client-under-ubuntukubuntu-linux/
2008-08-13T15:59:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	ok.. change nx's home dir from /home/nx to /usr/NX/home/nx (see http://nixtechnica.blogspot.com/2007/04/how-to-change-your-home-directory-in.html but use vipw instead of nano)
2008-08-13T16:00:00.000Z	rocko	RainCT	ok i have added the user and tried uninstalling and reinstalling
2008-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	OK. I guess creating the .ssh/sshd_config yourself should be enough, else I don't know.
2008-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	RainCT	rocko	I am away now. Good luck!
