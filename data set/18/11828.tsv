2007-06-10T05:23:00.000Z	oneseventeen		I'm running Feisty Fawn and can't see my external HDD, any tips?
2007-06-10T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	what filesystem?
2007-06-10T05:24:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	can't remember, but it is the one I used to back up my old Ubuntu install before formatting and starting from scratch
2007-06-10T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	does it show up when you type 'sudo fdisk -l'?
2007-06-10T05:25:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	I *think* I see it after fdisk -l
2007-06-10T05:26:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	it is marked as /dev/sda1 and is Fat32
2007-06-10T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	when you type 'mount', you do not see it listed, correct?
2007-06-10T05:27:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	nope, it is not there when I type mount
2007-06-10T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	alright, try to mount it.  Are you familiar with using mount on the command line?
2007-06-10T05:28:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	I haven't used mount from the command line in a while, I'm assuming sudo mount /dev/sda1 /some/mountpoint
2007-06-10T05:29:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	right, make sure you create /some/mountpoint first, then: sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /some/mountpoint   .  If that works, you'll probably want to tweak the permissions and/or add it to fstab
2007-06-10T05:32:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	thanks, that worked great, I can at least read data from it (which is all I want to do today)
2007-06-10T05:32:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	any ideas why it doesn't automount like it used to?
2007-06-10T05:33:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	no, I'm not sure.  Do other drives automount at the moment?
2007-06-10T05:33:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	I actually don't have any other with me... but they did when I first installed Feisty Fawn....
2007-06-10T05:33:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	could it be because I modified fstab at one point?
2007-06-10T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	oneseventeen	check that gnome-volume-manager is running, check that it doesn't have "noauto" in your fstab for your drive
2007-06-10T05:35:00.000Z	oneseventeen	jrib	gvm is running, and the cdrom is the only place I see "noauto"
