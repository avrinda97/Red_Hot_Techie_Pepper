2008-06-15T02:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sun01Tech	i would make swap, ext3, ntfs
2008-06-15T02:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sun01Tech	but either would likely work
2008-06-15T02:29:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	IndyGunFreak	what about the mbr...would ubuntu automatically set it up with the swap area being first..will use grub...or is that space reserved ?
2008-06-15T02:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sun01Tech	yes, swap being first will not effect the mbr
