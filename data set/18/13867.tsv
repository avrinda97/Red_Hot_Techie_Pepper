2005-10-10T14:04:00.000Z	hjack		Apparently sendmail has installed itself and runs on startup.  How do I stop it and remove it from startup?  I am very much a novice here.......
2005-10-10T14:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	sendmail shouldn't be installed by default; ubuntu uses postfix
2005-10-10T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	i wouldn't recommend uninstalling postfix; i think it's needed for local mail delivery
2005-10-10T14:05:00.000Z	hjack	HappyFool	Sorry then.  I assumed it was sendmal.  Then replace sendmail with postifx and same question please..
2005-10-10T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	oh, it shouldn't be listening on any external interfaces
2005-10-10T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	yeah, but only on 127.0.0.1
2005-10-10T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	i.e., internal only
2005-10-10T14:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	netstat -ant|grep :25 should say this: tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:25            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
2005-10-10T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	read the msg ubotu's sent you
2005-10-10T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	oh, oops
2005-10-10T14:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	afaik that second one is the ipv6 equivalent of the first
2005-10-10T14:08:00.000Z	hjack	HappyFool	Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.
2005-10-10T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	np ;)
2005-10-10T14:14:00.000Z	hjack	HappyFool	One more question.  It says I should able to apt it but I am getting this :
2005-10-10T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	pls don't paste more than 2 lines
2005-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	err
2005-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	i hope i didn't send such a link
2005-10-10T14:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	hjack	anyway, wget is a general ftp / http client; dpkg is a low-level debian package management tool, and apt-get is a higher-level, repository-aware tool
