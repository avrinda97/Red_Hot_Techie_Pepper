2006-06-20T05:59:00.000Z	vanberge		would anybody be willing to answer a few questions for me about ubuntu / ntfs ?  (I am migrating from windows and have a few questions!)
2006-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	vanberge		Well, is ubuntu plug n play?   i just installed ubuntu on 1 hard drive, and want to hook up my windows hard drive as a slave so that i can copy my files over to this ubuntu install.  is that something that would work fairly easily?
2006-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	is it usb-drive?
2006-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	vanberge		neg.  IDE
2006-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	IDE is not PNP
2006-06-20T06:02:00.000Z	vanberge	zybrid	what would i have to do in order to mount a slave IDe drive without damaging it?
2006-06-20T06:02:00.000Z	vanberge		:-/
2006-06-20T06:02:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	you can read ntfs, but not write on it *the last time i checked*
2006-06-20T06:02:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	you need to mount the ntfs drive to somewhere.
2006-06-20T06:03:00.000Z	vanberge		that would be perfect zybrid.  i dont want to have any chance of writing to it
2006-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	Then i dont know.
2006-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	perhaps there is a mount-gui program in reps?
2006-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	vanberge	zybrid	no, its good... if i can mount my ntfs hard disk and read it, then i am set.
2006-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	vanberge	zybrid	i know my way around command line...
2006-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	oh, i misunderstood you.
2006-06-20T06:05:00.000Z	vanberge	zybrid	can i mount after boot up?  or do i have to edit fstab to make mount during system init.
2006-06-20T06:05:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	i think there are some fine howtos at help.ubuntu.org
2006-06-20T06:05:00.000Z	zybrid	vanberge	yes just edit fstab
