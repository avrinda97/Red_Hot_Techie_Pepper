2005-09-27T14:53:00.000Z	Hallucination	eastein	- i think you have to enter the correct values for your monitor in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2005-09-27T15:02:00.000Z	Hallucination	eastein	are your HorzSync and VertRefresh values set to the correct values of your monitor?
2005-09-27T15:03:00.000Z	eastein	Hallucination	I think this has more to do with something wrong with gnome
2005-09-27T15:04:00.000Z	Hallucination	eastein	- actually it doesnt work fine, thats why you ask
2005-09-27T15:04:00.000Z	eastein	Hallucination	dot dot dot
2005-09-27T15:04:00.000Z	Hallucination	eastein	- if your frequency setting are too low, it might prevent your monitor from entering a higher resulution..
2005-09-27T15:06:00.000Z	Hallucination	eastein	- maybe the software prevents from entering to the defaults BECAUSE your frequency is too low...... now go and check the damn values and see if they are set correctly
2005-09-27T15:06:00.000Z	eastein	Hallucination	shut up, you don't have a clue :)
