2012-08-02T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Crawford	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-08-02T04:33:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	just a moment :-)

2012-08-02T04:34:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Sometimes it is fine when I boot up then other times it is so low I can barely hear it
2012-08-02T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Crawford	if you run:  alsamixer   are all the levels maxed and unmuted?
2012-08-02T04:35:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Almost all of them
2012-08-02T04:35:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	some I wonder if they need maxed
2012-08-02T04:36:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Also when it is being low it has only one channel to work with which cannot move
2012-08-02T04:37:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	s/pdif
2012-08-02T04:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Crawford	try:  echo "options snd-hda-intel model=acer-aspire" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf > /dev/null
2012-08-02T04:40:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Okay I did that.. audio is still low
2012-08-02T04:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Crawford	reboot to apply
2012-08-02T04:48:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Thank you for your help mate, sound seems to be working again although typically I have to reboot to get audio to work at normal volume levels anyway so I am not sure if that fix you applied did the trick or if it was roll of the reboot dice
2012-08-02T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Crawford	sweet hope its the permanent fix :)
2012-08-02T04:50:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Your a star.. Oh and its Paddy_NI from Ireland currently in canada sorting my brother in-laws ubuntu install
2012-08-02T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Crawford	nice, could've done it via SSH :)
2012-08-02T04:51:00.000Z	Crawford	ActionParsnip	Later Sir I'm going to have a cup of tea :-)
