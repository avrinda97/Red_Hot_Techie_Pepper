2010-02-04T10:07:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	ttys are inited in /etc/init/tty[1-6].conf i think
2010-02-04T10:07:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	they are there
2010-02-04T10:08:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	i'm assuming that x starts?
2010-02-04T10:09:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	yes
2010-02-04T10:09:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	i think i've had that issue before.  one sec
2010-02-04T10:19:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	you still around?
2010-02-04T10:19:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	yep
2010-02-04T10:20:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	just trying to remember how i fixed it, or even if an update did it for me
2010-02-04T10:21:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	I'm going to reboot and come back in, I tried reinstall upstart so we'll see what happens
2010-02-04T10:26:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	well that failed
2010-02-04T10:27:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	have you tried starting a tty manually?  sudo start tty2
2010-02-04T10:28:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	that works
2010-02-04T10:30:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	can you pastebin your /etc/default/console-setup
2010-02-04T10:31:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d1890e88c
2010-02-04T10:32:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	so that looks right.
2010-02-04T10:33:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	I think its something between xorg, grub2, and my nvidia drivers but I cannot nail it down
2010-02-04T10:34:00.000Z	zedster	sovi3t	when I run "runlevel" I get unknown as the output
2010-02-04T10:36:00.000Z	sovi3t	zedster	it wouldn't be x.  grub2 is a possibility.  try uncommenting GRUB_GFXMODE in /etc/default/grub doing an update-grub and rebooting
