2007-01-05T06:00:00.000Z	nextse7en		I totally fark my x server, can someone help?
2007-01-05T06:01:00.000Z	nextse7en		I ran and enabled my nvidia driver, after that, I can't see anything but a black screen.
2007-01-05T06:01:00.000Z	nextse7en		lol hadoc, we both did the same fuckup at the same time.
2007-01-05T06:02:00.000Z	nextse7en		Is there a way to revert to the previos xserve config file?
2007-01-05T06:03:00.000Z	nextse7en		I installed the nvidia driver, just like the wiki told me too.

2007-01-05T06:08:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	are you using a laptop ?
2007-01-05T06:09:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	plug an external monitor into the VGA connector
2007-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	it do on mine.
2007-01-05T06:11:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	means you may need a BIOS update, how old is the laptop, you may be able to enable it in your existing bios
2007-01-05T06:14:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	You can edit grub so the apic line is automatically done for you
2007-01-05T06:14:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	have you tried the external monitor
2007-01-05T06:16:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	I have an MSI laptop with ATI X700 dedicated graphics when I boot Ubuntu live all I get is a black screen when X starts. For what ever reason X puts itself out on my external VGAand ignores the Inbuilt LCD
2007-01-05T06:17:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	Sounds very similar your issue
2007-01-05T06:17:00.000Z	Bitloks	nextse7en	no worries mate
