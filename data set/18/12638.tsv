2006-05-19T13:28:00.000Z	sladen	tanath	can you file a bug please.  it should do the sync'ing on each boot too
2006-05-19T13:28:00.000Z	tanath	sladen	it does, but i want it to keep synchronizing automatically as it should
2006-05-19T13:29:00.000Z	sladen	tanath	does it succed, or do you have a firewall in the way?
2006-05-19T13:29:00.000Z	tanath	sladen	it succeeds. it just won't 'remember' the setting, and only synchronizes the one time when i hit OK
2006-05-19T13:29:00.000Z	tanath	sladen	then it's unchecked when i go back again
2006-05-19T13:30:00.000Z	sladen	tanath	it pops up a message saying "Please install NTP"
2006-05-19T13:30:00.000Z	sladen	tanath	and then unticks the box because it's not installed
2006-05-19T13:31:00.000Z	tanath	sladen	no, ntp is installed. as i said, it worked before reboot
2006-05-19T13:31:00.000Z	tanath	sladen	that box does not appear
