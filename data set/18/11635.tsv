2007-01-23T09:24:00.000Z	SanketMedhi		Can someone please guide me through how to use PHP + ODBC + Ubuntu ???
2007-01-23T09:24:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	what database do you use?
2007-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	I want to access MS SQL server
2007-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	okay, then have you installed Ubuntu yet?
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	I have Ubuntu with LAMP installed
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	perfect
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	I want to access my other machine which is running MS SQL Server
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	then I guess you just have to write php code now :)
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	I am not a n00b! :P
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	okay, just joking :)
2007-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	I know :P
2007-01-23T09:27:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	I spent almost 2 days trying to set up ODBC
2007-01-23T09:27:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	its not working
2007-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	php-db is also a possiblity to reach mssql databases
2007-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	however I don't really know either php-db or ODBC
2007-01-23T09:30:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	no probs, I found something on ##php, trying it now
2007-01-23T09:30:00.000Z	coNP	SanketMedhi	good luck!
2007-01-23T09:30:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	coNP	thanks
