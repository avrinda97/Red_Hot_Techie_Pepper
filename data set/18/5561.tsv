2008-09-27T11:37:00.000Z	pooki		supergrub sounds like something that recovers grub on the mbr, but i dont even have grub installed. how can i install grub onto my ubuntu installation which wont boot, using just the livecd :P
2008-09-27T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pooki	Why is grub not installed?
2008-09-27T11:37:00.000Z	pooki	Jordan_U	i have no clue. done a ton of ubuntu installs. this is a new build. installed it twice from livecd, both time there is no grub in /boot
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	pooki		grub was not lost
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	pooki		windows has not been installed
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pooki	Is there a menu.lst ?
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	pooki		there is just no grub @_@
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	pooki		no Jordan_U
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	pooki		there is no grub directory to hold the menu.lst
2008-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pooki	Ok, what partition is Ubuntu installed on, and do you want Grub installed to the MBR of that disk?
2008-09-27T11:39:00.000Z	pooki		the root partition is sda3, two empty partitions up front for windows later. i would like grub on the mbr
2008-09-27T11:39:00.000Z	pooki		this is a brand new hdd
2008-09-27T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pooki	"sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt && sudo grub-install /dev/sda && sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev && sudo chroot /mtn update-grub"
2008-09-27T11:41:00.000Z	pooki		ok Jordan_U will try that
2008-09-27T11:41:00.000Z	pooki	Jordan_U	the livecd says Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device
2008-09-27T11:42:00.000Z	pooki		grub-install from the livecd has not worked for me :/
2008-09-27T11:45:00.000Z	pooki		can i just transfer /boot/grub/ from my laptop and put it onto my new build and just change all the partitions..
2008-09-27T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pooki	You might ask in #grub, but they want people to "Before you ask, see if you can reproduce your problem with GRUB 2" Grub2 is available in the repos if you want to try it but it's still in development
