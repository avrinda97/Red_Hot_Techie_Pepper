2007-08-26T08:50:00.000Z	Karti	bo1	I believe that the live disk is a way to try the Linux system without damaging your disk.
2007-08-26T08:51:00.000Z	Karti	bo1	Which is why they are set to read only, not sure if you can do it with Kubuntu but you can set a persistant drive with Knoppix if that is what you are after
2007-08-26T08:52:00.000Z	Karti	bo1	I can see why people are rushing to help you! ;)
2007-08-26T08:58:00.000Z	Karti	bo1	do you have a spare disk?
