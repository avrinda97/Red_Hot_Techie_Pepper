2009-11-13T00:15:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF		Hi there !
2009-11-13T00:17:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF		Is it possible with the twinview to zap faster between double-screen and simple-screen, without having to restartX every time ? Like with the « Apply » function of nvidia-xconfig. Thanks !
2009-11-13T00:17:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	nvidia?  Look for disper.  Gimme a second and I'll look up the ppa for it

2009-11-13T00:18:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF	mbeierl	it fixes all the resolution problems ?
2009-11-13T00:19:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	it has for me.  My xorg.conf is now empty :)
2009-11-13T00:24:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF	mbeierl	what have I to do after I have sudo make install it ?
2009-11-13T00:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	hold on... there is a ppa for it.  Are you on karmic?
2009-11-13T00:25:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wvengen/ppa then sudo aptitude install disper
2009-11-13T00:26:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	then simply "disper -s" for single display and "disper -e" to do two displays.  I have twin view turned off on the xorg.conf now
2009-11-13T00:26:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF	mbeierl	thanks a lot. I'm just going to try that :D
2009-11-13T00:27:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	thanks to the author of disper!  It's been great for me!  I hated having to use nvidia gui just to change the resolution.  disper "just works"
2009-11-13T00:28:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF	mbeierl	anyway, thanks to make me discover it :)
2009-11-13T00:28:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	you are welcome!
2009-11-13T00:56:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF	mbeierl	disper is just going to work, but my second screen isn't correctely configured : it must be « LeftOf » and it is currently « RightOf ». Do you know how to change that ?
2009-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	disper has a help when run without argument.  But, to keep things simple: "disper -e -t left" will extend with the second display to the left.  Other values are right, top, and bottom.
2009-11-13T00:58:00.000Z	JeanEdouardF	mbeierl	whooo :D . Perfect ! It works now !
2009-11-13T00:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	JeanEdouardF	ain't it GREAT!
