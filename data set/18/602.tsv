2011-12-10T22:45:00.000Z	HQRaja		I haven't done that but that's how it should work in theory. I've myself installed Windows 7 first, and then let Ubuntu installation take care of the bootloader management the way it does
2011-12-10T22:47:00.000Z	HQRaja		I hope that long message got across completely....in case it got cut off somewhere, lemme know and I'll paste the rest.
2011-12-10T22:49:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	No my CdRom which read cd and dvds!
2011-12-10T22:40:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	You currently have Ubuntu installed and you want to add a Windows 7 installation?
2011-12-10T22:42:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	Exactly
2011-12-10T22:44:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	I believe it can be done...just install Windows 7 on another partition. You will then have to boot into Ubuntu using a Live CD and find a way to install only the bootloader without installing Ubuntu again
2011-12-10T22:45:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	I now have ubuntu
2011-12-10T22:46:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	Is there a way to build bootloader in ubuntu
2011-12-10T22:47:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	You have Ubuntu now...use the Windows 7 installation CD to install Windows 7 on another partition (assuming you already have an empty partition...if you don't, make one using GParted). Once you have installed Windows 7, you won't be able to boot into Ubuntu but just use the Ubuntu Live CD or USB to boot, and then install only grub (I don't know how to do that though i.e. install only grub)
2011-12-10T22:48:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	but problem is my CdROm was broken!
2011-12-10T22:48:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	Your WIndows 7 CD ROM?
2011-12-10T22:50:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	Oh OK...your CD Drive, you mean. You can easily make Windows 7 bootable USB. Wait, lemme get you the link for that.
2011-12-10T22:50:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	yes , I make mistake .CD Drive! ;)
2011-12-10T22:51:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/ (it works with creating Live USB for Linux as well as Windows, but for Windows, make sure you read the 'Very Important' section of that page)
2011-12-10T22:52:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	It's a Windows app unfortunately, so you must use either WINE (not sure if it'll work well in WINE or not) or preferably, use some friend's Windows PC to run it.
2011-12-10T22:53:00.000Z	HQRaja	soltani	Once you have installed Windows, just boot into Ubuntu using a Ubuntu Live USB and run 'sudo grub-install' from terminal (as Barbariandude suggested), and you'll have the bootloader working for dual-boot
2011-12-10T22:56:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	Is there another way?
2011-12-10T22:57:00.000Z	soltani	HQRaja	...
