2011-02-11T04:18:00.000Z	sico		Hi, I booted from live cd, but installer fails.  can i restart the install from another image, say on a usb drive?
2011-02-11T04:19:00.000Z	benedict	sico	to install from a pen drive you need to follow a special procedure. there is a programm that creates a ubuntu-install-pne drive for you called usb-creator or disk-creator. you will see it in the gnome menus
2011-02-11T04:19:00.000Z	sico	benedict	i have multibootiso (but my computer won't boot from usb)  that's where my image is
2011-02-11T04:20:00.000Z	benedict	sico	also, if oyu go to the ubuntu website, where you choose the image for download you'll also see a how-to for creating an install pen drive
2011-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	benedict	sico	did you check, if you enable booting from usb in the BIOS? sometimes this needs to be checked...
2011-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	sico	benedict	yup, not there
2011-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	benedict	sico	i am not sure if i understood you correctly. but just copying the image to your pendrive win't do it....
2011-02-11T04:22:00.000Z	sico	benedict	the image is on usb stick, i am booted in live mode (via cd).   i want to start the installer from the usb drive while booted live from cd?
2011-02-11T04:24:00.000Z	benedict	sico	ah, ok now i understand what you want to do.... i guess this is beyond my understanding. i know how to make pendrives (multi-)bootable, this is why i reacted to you. why do you want to do such a "weired" procuedure. why do you thinkt the installer from pen drive will be better than the one from cd.
2011-02-11T04:26:00.000Z	benedict	sico	maybe you have a look at the alterante installer or even the minimal installer.
2011-02-11T04:29:00.000Z	benedict		!paste
2011-02-11T04:30:00.000Z	sico	benedict	thanks though :D
2011-02-11T04:30:00.000Z	sico	benedict	and i think you are missing my point.
2011-02-11T04:31:00.000Z	benedict	sico	the normalinstaller didn't work for me either. the aternate one did... it will result in the exact same system in the end... hope i could help you a bit. to be honest i think there will be a better way than your cd-pendrive way... but if you know your way around feel free ;)
2011-02-11T04:33:00.000Z	sico	benedict	the normal installer works, the cd it's on doesn't  (it boots to live mode (which i'm using now))  but installer fails.   so i'm just trying to find a way to start the install process from an iso image
2011-02-11T04:34:00.000Z	sico	benedict	from an*other iso image
2011-02-11T04:36:00.000Z	benedict		can some1 help me to investigate my long boot times? my dmesg http://paste.ubuntu.com/565607/ have a look at line 647 (mounting ext3 takes more than 100 seconds!!!) and line 713 and following (take me additional 20 sec). i allread did fsch.ext3 to my both partitons (/ ant /home) from my second ubuntu installed on the same hdd.
2011-02-11T04:37:00.000Z	benedict	sico	why don't you sue the normal installer?
