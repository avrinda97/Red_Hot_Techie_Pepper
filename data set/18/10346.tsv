2006-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	czer323		Look'n for some direction with this error.  Using only CLI.  ifup eth0 returns "ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0".  I've read online about checking the /etc/network/interfaces file, but i'm not sure what i'm looking for.
2006-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	You need to add eth0 to the file
2006-12-13T17:18:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	can you be any more specific?  perhaps a line that i need to add.
2006-12-13T17:18:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	I've added "iface eth0 inet dhcp" and that didn't quite do the trick.
2006-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	one moment
2006-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	sure thing, I'll just be searching around google.
2006-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	using dhcp?
2006-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	yeah, I'd like to use dhcp.  keeps things simple.
2006-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	auto eth0
2006-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	iface eth0 inet dhcp
2006-12-13T17:21:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	Substitute eth0 with whatever interface you're trying to add
2006-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	Any luck?
2006-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	not quite ;) I had restarted the computer a moment ago to see if it'd help.  it's still com'n back up.
2006-12-13T17:28:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	Well, i haven't seen the message again, but i'm still not able to get an ip using dhcp.
2006-12-13T17:28:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	Are you sure that you'
2006-12-13T17:30:00.000Z	blatios_	czer323	I have to go, maybe you're simply using the wrong interface name
2006-12-13T17:30:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	Yep.  This was working, and occasionally works on it's own for some reason.  I haven't quite pinpointed the issue.  eth0 is the only card that I have.  and it's the only one that shows in ifconfig.
2006-12-13T17:30:00.000Z	czer323	blatios_	it's cool.  i'll figure it out eventually.  thanks for the help though.
