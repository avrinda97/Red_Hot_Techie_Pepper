2009-02-20T07:18:00.000Z	chort27		Can someone help me? I'm trying to turn on desktop effects on my iBook G3 but it won't let me
2009-02-20T07:19:00.000Z	fde	chort27	if it won't let you, it means your graphics drivers don't support he necessary features ... what is your graphic card?
2009-02-20T07:21:00.000Z	fde	chort27	I JUST answered you...
2009-02-20T07:21:00.000Z	chort27	fde	sorry i crashed out
2009-02-20T07:21:00.000Z	fde	chort27	what is your graphics card?
2009-02-20T07:22:00.000Z	chort27	fde	I'm not sure how to tell but it says direct rendering: Yes
2009-02-20T07:23:00.000Z	fde	chort27	lspci | grep -i graphic
2009-02-20T07:24:00.000Z	chort27	fde	i typed that but it just gae me another blank terminal command line - nothing happened
2009-02-20T07:24:00.000Z	chort27	fde	I open System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers and the list is empty and it say "No Proprietary drivers are in use on this system".
2009-02-20T07:25:00.000Z	fde	chort27	means thats not the video line... so it returned nothing... lspci | grep -i vga
2009-02-20T07:26:00.000Z	chort27	fde	VGA Compatible controller: ATI Technologies INC Radeon Mobility M7 LW [Radeon Mobility 7500]
2009-02-20T07:27:00.000Z	fde	chort27	lsmod | grep fglrx return anything (just yes or no)
2009-02-20T07:27:00.000Z	fde	chort27	Also, what version of Ubuntu? Older versions, fglrx didn't support compositing
2009-02-20T07:27:00.000Z	chort27	fde	grep: return: No such file or directory
2009-02-20T07:28:00.000Z	chort27	fde	lsmod | grep fglrx return anything
2009-02-20T07:29:00.000Z	fde	chort27	#ubuntu-ppc ... I would guess there is no fglrx driver for ppc though
2009-02-20T07:31:00.000Z	fde	chort27	uhh... make that #ubuntu-powerpc ... they'll know more, PPC isn't even officially supported since Apple switched platforms unfortunately.... other distros have official support
