2008-07-21T19:32:00.000Z	Skyrail		When I install a new OS (e.g. ubuntu) on a HDD will it create a complete new MBR if the drive is completely reformatted?
2008-07-21T19:34:00.000Z	Skyrail		One day I will sort out this thing that keeps on messing up, all I want is a HDD with Windows on and a HDD with Ubuntu on one half and another distro on another half
2008-07-21T19:35:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	what MBR application are you using for multi os boot?
2008-07-21T19:36:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	well I had Windows installed first, then I installed ubuntu with some problems, but then after realising I had messed up the ubuntu install I tried accessing my Windows drive (by removing my ubuntu drive) but it kept on giving me boot errors
2008-07-21T19:37:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	what kind of errors?
2008-07-21T19:38:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	with ubuntu it wouldn't find my drives without booting with the all_generic_ide command, so i booted via live disk with that command, installed but then it wouldn't boot, I also keep on getting a few drive errors
2008-07-21T19:39:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	I have a file online which compares the two outputs of dmesg from the boot with all_generic_ide and one without. oh, two physical disks
2008-07-21T19:40:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	sounds like indeed there is some issues with your MBR.. have you tried to boot via live and Chroot into the ubuntu disk and installed LILO? might work :) not used to fixing problems with SATA though.
2008-07-21T19:41:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	perhaps i dont know what im talking about either, so dont take my words as truth, but it would be very strange for windows to not boot, if you have not touched that disk at all
2008-07-21T19:41:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	well I've wiped the ubuntu disk now, tried installation Gentoo, messed that up because I'm not to smart with linux yet, now I've wiped it again and just using it to backup all my Windows data while I reinstall windows, again
2008-07-21T19:42:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	ok.. Gentoo is a sweet system, used to for many years.. brb my ubutnu upgrade is done on this box now..
2008-07-21T19:44:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	have you tried to google this issue?
2008-07-21T19:44:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	kind of, I asked in the forums as well, at the moment I'm a bit sketchy about it all, I just would love to get linux on my new PC, as my friend said linux works better with older popular hardware haha
2008-07-21T19:45:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	well the funny part about gnu/linux is that it works. period.. just the pain and hair scratching might get a bit too frustrating :)
2008-07-21T19:47:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	okay it should work, if I hacked my way through it all haha, well I'll finish backing up my data, reinstall Windows and I hope that fixes the Windows booting problem. If it doesn't I'll google that if It continues to cause any problems but then I don't want to install linux again if it just mucks it up again :(
2008-07-21T19:50:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	if...if I was to install Windows, take that drive out, install Linux and get them both working individually then add the other drive to one of the boot managers of either Linux or Windows, should that work? Just so they don't interfere with each other until I'm ready :S
2008-07-21T19:51:00.000Z	gabx	Skyrail	have never heard of either a linux or a ms installation process that distrubs any other disk.. however i have never installed on a SATA raid.. and im not 100% sure how the MBR works on SATA raids either..
2008-07-21T19:52:00.000Z	Skyrail	gabx	it's just nice to speak to someone with more experience then me hehe
