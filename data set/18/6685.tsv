2008-04-29T11:38:00.000Z	masmota	LSG	 pick one from /usr/share/app-install/icons/
2008-04-29T11:39:00.000Z	masmota	LSG	then check "use_custom_icon" in gconf-editor
2008-04-29T11:40:00.000Z	LSG	masmota	I have my own custom icon, but it doesn't seem to work..
2008-04-29T11:40:00.000Z	LSG	masmota	Good point, i'll give that a try.
2008-04-29T11:41:00.000Z	masmota	LSG	 i used exfalso.png
2008-04-29T11:44:00.000Z	LSG	masmota	Nope...something else is wrong. This isn't working either.
2008-04-29T11:44:00.000Z	LSG	masmota	I need to go to sleep anyway, i'll see what's wrong some other time. Thanks for your advice though!
