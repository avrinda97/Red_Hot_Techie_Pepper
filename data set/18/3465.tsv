2009-09-27T04:05:00.000Z	Blackbird		Uh. Forgive me, I'm a bit of a noob even with the filesystem. What's a recommendable mount point?
2009-09-27T04:05:00.000Z	Blackbird		Just /?
2009-09-27T04:05:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	/media
2009-09-27T04:07:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	create a / on 5-12 gb and a /home with the rest. Also a swap must be made with amount equal to your ram(if you want to be able to hibirnate)
2009-09-27T04:09:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	that would indeed do the trick
2009-09-27T04:10:00.000Z	Blackbird	delly	Bad, then. Because I cannot do that.
2009-09-27T04:11:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	9.10 installation?
2009-09-27T04:13:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	ok, did you have free space to begin with on the hardisk?
2009-09-27T04:13:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	as in not used?
2009-09-27T04:14:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	was that in any file system or just unformated space?
2009-09-27T04:15:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	ok, then "shrink" the partition that is formated to a reasonable bit(you should kind of have the option).
2009-09-27T04:16:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	did you have a slider when you could install?
2009-09-27T04:30:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	unplug the HD?
2009-09-27T04:31:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	Well, what about if we say "for the kicks of it"? :P
2009-09-27T04:33:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	ok, so you are going to install Ubuntu on the external HD?
2009-09-27T04:34:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	when the installer gets to where it can be slided and just auto install.... slide it so ubuntu gets the amount of space you want it to have :P
2009-09-27T04:35:00.000Z	delly	Blackbird	:/
2009-09-27T04:38:00.000Z	Blackbird	delly	Thank you, I'm going to need it.
