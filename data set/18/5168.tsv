2008-12-17T19:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	i used a utility called  unetbootin
2008-12-17T19:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	linux doesn't use drive letter, i uses device nodes and mount point
2008-12-17T19:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	try typing...   mount
2008-12-19T16:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	i know how to fix that
2008-12-19T16:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	in a terminal, go into your home directory. then type in   mv .mozilla .mozilla-restart
2008-12-19T16:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	close Firefox first
2008-12-19T16:50:00.000Z	shavin	onetinsoldier	Not only did the problem did not go away, all my extension have dissappeared, chatzilla, download helper etc etc all :-(
2008-12-19T16:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	ok... close out Firefox. in your home directory type in the following....  rm -r .mozilla   ...then   mv .mozilla-restart .mozilla
2008-12-19T16:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	yes
2008-12-19T16:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	that will get you your stuff back but it means i don't know how to solve the original problem
2008-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	shavin	onetinsoldier	okay thats done. should i restart ff now?
2008-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	yes, sure
2008-12-19T16:56:00.000Z	shavin	onetinsoldier	momentary corrupted graphics at startup of firefox are there, the message bar 'restart required' is still there too.
2008-12-19T16:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	as i said.. it would get you your stuff back, but i do not know how to solve the original problem
2008-12-19T16:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	ok, that's good. you will have to find someone else that hopefully know how to fix your 'restart required' problem. sorry
2008-12-19T16:59:00.000Z	shavin	onetinsoldier	thanks for your help.
2008-12-19T16:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	shavin	ok, good luck
