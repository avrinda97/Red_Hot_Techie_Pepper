2005-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	Davey|Ubuntu		oh, thats it? :D
2005-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Davey|Ubuntu	Yeah, it should work automatically
2005-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Davey|Ubuntu		hmm, where will I see it?
2005-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Davey|Ubuntu	That's why Project Utopia rocks ;d
2005-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Davey|Ubuntu	Probably somewhere under /media
2005-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Davey|Ubuntu		Project Utopia?
2005-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Davey|Ubuntu	Quest-Master	nope, not there
