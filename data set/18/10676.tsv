2006-12-03T14:09:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	i've tried alternatives, but on the start the splash is kubuntu and on the shutdown is ubuntu
2006-12-03T14:10:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	remove the kubuntu-usplash package and the ubuntu-usplash package from synaptic and then reinstall the ubuntu package
2006-12-03T14:11:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	it wants to delete kubuntu-desktop then.
2006-12-03T14:11:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	no prob. thats just a metpackage. go ahead
2006-12-03T14:15:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	now i try to restart. i'll be back
2006-12-03T14:15:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	cheers, mate
2006-12-03T14:18:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	the splash is fine now, but it shows off-center
2006-12-03T14:19:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	I want it 12801024
2006-12-03T14:19:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	off-center ?
2006-12-03T14:19:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	i mean it is in the upper-left corner.
2006-12-03T14:20:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	change the res in /etc/usplash.conf

2006-12-03T14:24:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	now, on the shutdown, it's fine, but at the start it's still in the upper-left corner
2006-12-03T14:25:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	wierd. sorry thats about the extent of my knowledge of usplash
2006-12-03T14:25:00.000Z	stephano	screechingcat	is the vga=795 right in grub?
2006-12-03T14:27:00.000Z	screechingcat	stephano	i dont know. everybody says to put in the vga line, but mine works best without any vga= line
