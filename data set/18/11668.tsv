2006-07-25T09:23:00.000Z	BarryAllen		hi all
2006-07-25T09:24:00.000Z	BarryAllen		im trying to use my radeon 9100 / igp (mobile), without success in dapper, ... the kernel module is up... my driver in xorg.conf is "radeon" but i got the message in the Xorg.log (II) RADEON(0): [agp]  You may want to make sure the agpgart kernel module
2006-07-25T09:24:00.000Z	BarryAllen		is loaded before the radeon kernel module.
2006-07-25T09:25:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	"ati" should load "radeon" automaticly...
2006-07-25T09:26:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	to be sure the radeon driver is loaded after agpgart, i have turnd off my X session, removed the module radeon, loaded again the module radeon, and up the X sessoin....
2006-07-25T09:26:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	and have the same error.
2006-07-25T09:27:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	:/ and what was the problem before you started to hack ? X didnt start ?
2006-07-25T09:27:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	works... but without dri :(
2006-07-25T09:28:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	i think ati/radeon doesnt have dri (if thats the 3d hardware acceleration part)
2006-07-25T09:29:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	so you want 3d hardware acceleration, right ?
2006-07-25T09:34:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	i assume you will be installing fglrx in the end, as it sais experimental for radeon..
2006-07-25T09:34:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	i tried fglrx first.... now, im trying to use "radeon"
2006-07-25T09:34:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	is your card supperted by the experimental driver ?
2006-07-25T09:36:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	i dont know... where can i found the "experimental" driver?
2006-07-25T09:36:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	its all in the radeon driver
2006-07-25T09:37:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	so, yes is supported, i got in Xorg.log:  ATI Radeon 9100 IGP
2006-07-25T09:38:00.000Z	oskude	BarryAllen	sorry, i allways used only fglrx as i read it that only r300+ have 3d hardware acceleration, and that allso in experimental state. sorry my mistake
2006-07-25T09:39:00.000Z	BarryAllen	oskude	no problems dude
