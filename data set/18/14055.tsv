2005-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	rigel		wait, what?
2005-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	rigel		i just want a media player
2005-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	rigel		that does mp3 and flac
2005-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	rigel		because xmms-flac breaks xmms at the moment
2005-09-20T06:51:00.000Z	rigel		well, that and i cant use xmms on the commandline
2005-09-20T06:51:00.000Z	rigel		burner, beep? yeah, thats what i have installed now, but thats gui-only innit?
2005-09-20T06:52:00.000Z	rigel		yeah
2005-09-20T06:52:00.000Z	rigel		well, xmms has assloads of plugins
2005-09-20T06:52:00.000Z	rigel		so when i do (rarely) use the gui, i default to xmms
2005-09-20T06:53:00.000Z	rigel		but i want to be able to play flac's from the commandline
2005-09-20T06:53:00.000Z	nalioth	rigel	cplay
2005-09-20T06:59:00.000Z	nalioth	rigel	use synaptic and search for "flac"
2005-09-21T07:57:00.000Z	nalioth	rigel	sftp or scp is up to the users preferences
2005-09-26T11:24:00.000Z	nalioth	rigel	is mp3blaster a console proggy?
2005-09-26T11:24:00.000Z	rigel	nalioth	ncurses based, yes
2005-09-26T11:25:00.000Z	nalioth	rigel	and you've passed whatever command line inputs to it in the script?
2005-09-26T11:27:00.000Z	rigel	nalioth	yeah, the script runs fine by itself
2005-09-26T11:27:00.000Z	nalioth	rigel	then it would seem to be an cron issue
