2006-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	whadar		i cant cd into a davfs mounted directory....
2006-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	whadar		anyone's got a clue on that?
2006-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	whadar		bash: cd: dav: Operation not permitted
2006-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	ls -ld dav
2006-07-19T05:44:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	mount |grep dav
2006-07-19T05:46:00.000Z	whadar	frogzoo	anything bad with that?
2006-07-19T05:46:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	dunno - if there was, mount shouldn't have mounted it...
2006-07-19T05:47:00.000Z	whadar	frogzoo	well thanks anyway
2006-07-19T06:11:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	not according to man mount - doesn't understand davfs, only coda
2006-07-19T06:16:00.000Z	whadar	frogzoo	i tried sudo mount -t davfs http://www.box.net/dav /media/dav
2006-07-19T06:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	and?
2006-07-19T06:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	man mount - davfs doesn't exist as an option
2006-07-20T15:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	tar zcf tarfile.tgz .
2006-07-20T15:56:00.000Z	whadar	frogzoo	i need .gz... i'll use some hack...
2006-07-20T15:58:00.000Z	frogzoo	whadar	you can't gzip a directory - it's that simple
