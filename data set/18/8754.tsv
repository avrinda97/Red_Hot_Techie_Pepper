2009-04-30T06:54:00.000Z	radical	Elite	What do you mean by that?
2009-04-30T06:55:00.000Z	Elite	radical	I mean I want to install debian on my server to have a GUI how can I backup my current install of ubuntu server in case I want to revert?
2009-04-30T06:56:00.000Z	radical	Elite	you don't need to install debian to get a GUI.
2009-04-30T06:56:00.000Z	radical	Elite	Is that your ownly reason for switching?
2009-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	radical	Elite	just install the gnome desktop or xfce if you want to go light.
2009-04-30T07:08:00.000Z	radical	Elite	What are you trying to do ?
2009-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	radical	Elite	if you're on server you've got to mount it first.
2009-04-30T07:13:00.000Z	Elite	radical	its always mounted at start up
2009-04-30T07:15:00.000Z	Elite	radical	how would I do that then? mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /media/sdc1?
2009-04-30T07:20:00.000Z	radical	Elite	just add the desktop package...gnome-desktop I think.
2009-04-30T07:21:00.000Z	Elite	radical	how can I make it install from the cd?
2009-04-30T07:21:00.000Z	radical	Elite	add your cd to your sources list and then install.
2009-04-30T07:24:00.000Z	radical	Elite	check out raylu .
2009-04-30T07:26:00.000Z	Elite	radical	I have added it yet it it still wants to connect to the server to dl it and I don't want it to
2009-04-30T07:27:00.000Z	radical	Elite	you can always uncheck the other ones, Elite.
2009-04-30T07:30:00.000Z	Elite	radical	then sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop?
2009-04-30T07:36:00.000Z	radical	Elite	Yes.
