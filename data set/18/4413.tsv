2010-10-20T16:29:00.000Z	lvh		Hello!
2010-10-20T16:29:00.000Z	lvh		Is there an installation of Ubuntu Server that drops straight into SSH?
2010-10-20T16:30:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	Install SSH and I think it should get automatically added to boot so you can SSH into the box
2010-10-20T16:30:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	Sorry, please rephrase.
2010-10-20T16:31:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	So you can install over SSH? i.e install on a system that has no screen even during install, right?
2010-10-20T16:32:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	yes, that's the idea
2010-10-20T16:32:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	FAI would also be acceptable
2010-10-20T16:32:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	Well, you can do this.. (I've done this) OPen up the LiveCD on the server, and then (test this out on another computer first so you remember) drop to a shell (tty2 for example), sudo su, install ssh or run it, and then get ssh'ing
2010-10-20T16:33:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	This assumes said computer has a keyboard.
2010-10-20T16:33:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	It's a rackmount -- if I had my keyboard, I'd have my screen too.
2010-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	I did a full on Gentoo install where I did the first hour or so without a screen :)    Ah, I see. Does the rackmount not have any standard USB/PS2 connectors you can use?
2010-10-20T16:35:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	It does, but I don't have keyboards to plug into them.
2010-10-20T16:36:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	Hmn.. in most cases I'd recommend nicking a keyboard off someone for an hour or two, or picking up one from a recycle shop for a dollar
2010-10-20T16:37:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	How can ANYONE have a rackmount, but no old computer in the attic? :P I assume you only have your rackmount and laptop then?
2010-10-20T16:38:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	"being in a data center 100km away from said attic"
2010-10-20T16:39:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	"figuring out only upon arrival someone decided to take said console and not bring it back"
2010-10-20T16:39:00.000Z	nox-Hand	lvh	Data centers without keyboards -- ouch! That's tough man! Hope you figure out how to do it.. I'm going to get back to trying to figure my issue (sorry, no more ideas for ya..)
2010-10-20T16:40:00.000Z	lvh	nox-Hand	And despite the fact that I still know how 7406es work, I'm not inclined to find a soldering iron
