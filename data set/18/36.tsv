2012-11-20T11:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	How did you put 12.04 on the USB?
2012-11-20T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	If you're still trying to boot via UEFI tomorrow I can help you then.
2012-11-20T11:40:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	aww shucks thanks...
2012-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	that links seems okay???
2012-11-20T11:43:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	 Am trying http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntu-secured/files/ubuntu-secure-remix-12.04.1-32bits.iso/download   .. . The guy behind it: Yannubuntu, he's the one who filed the bug report that UEFI booting doesnt work well with 32 bit ubuntu images
2012-11-20T11:46:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	:  So I'm guessing he created the boot with UEFI successfully... 64-bit was recommended but ..my machine is 32-bit.. so i'mma  try the 32, then the 64 bit image from the same site...  Good idea???
2012-11-20T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	It's *very* rare to find 32 bit UEFI hardware, are you sure that's what you have?
2012-11-20T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	How did you put 12.04 on the USB?
2012-11-20T12:35:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	usb-creator-gtk ...
2012-11-20T12:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	That doesn't prepare USB drives to be booted via UEFI (or didn't last time I looked).
2012-11-20T12:36:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	: erm.. Not a good idea??
2012-11-20T12:37:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	uhoh.. okay.. just read your message..
2012-11-20T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	Why do you think that you have a 32 bit machine with UEFI firmware?
2012-11-20T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	It may be a 32 bit Windows installation, but you probably have a 64 bit CPU and 64 bit UEFI firmware.
2012-11-20T12:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	What is the model of the computer you're using?
2012-11-20T12:41:00.000Z	jquip	Jordan_U	: erm... 32-bit I still think -> Atom CPU
2012-11-20T12:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	There are 64 bit Atom CPUs, but yest that does make it seem more likely to be 32 bit while still having UEFI. I really do need to leave now though. If you're lucky then you have a 64 bit machine, and the easiest thing to do is th burn the standard 64 bit Ubuntu iso to a CD/DVD and boot from that (note those were very specific instructions, and every part of them is important).
2012-11-20T13:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jquip	I'm actually back by the way, though it looks like you're set.
