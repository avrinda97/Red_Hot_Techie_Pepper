2008-06-25T01:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Xavura	did you upgrade your system from Gutsy to hardy or is it a fresh install?
2008-06-25T01:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Xavura	did you turn off effects?  if not try that
2008-06-25T01:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Xavura	that's not what I said.. turn them off then try with the mouse wheel again.. if it doesn't do it then there is a configuration issue
