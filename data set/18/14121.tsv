2008-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	You can download 8.04 and then burn it with 5.x
2008-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation follow the "standard installation" steps at the top of that page
2008-07-27T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	Yes, thats what that page walks you through doing.
2008-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	You'll be able to install it once you upgrade.
2008-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	don't worry about synaptic, worry about upgrading first.  Synaptic won't work, and it won't matter after you reinstall either.
2008-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	Upgrade first, then worry about mysql
2008-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	yep
2008-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	Do you have a blank CD?
2008-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	It is. http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2008-07-27T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	kuber_	desktop
