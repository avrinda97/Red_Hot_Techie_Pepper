2008-05-10T02:51:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	what chip? ar5007 isn't supported yet. i had to compile a patched development build
2008-05-10T02:53:00.000Z	vreer	saerg	where to fin d it if it doesn'rt show up in lspci?
2008-05-10T02:53:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG says google
2008-05-10T02:56:00.000Z	vreer	saerg	so, where to find an intereface if it doesn't show up in lspci?
2008-05-10T02:56:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	why do you think that you have an atheros chip?
2008-05-10T03:02:00.000Z	vreer	saerg	http://nl.computers.toshiba-europe.com/cgi-bin/ToshibaCSG/download_drivers_bios.jsp?service=NL
2008-05-10T03:05:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	?? this is a general download site
2008-05-10T03:05:00.000Z	vreer	saerg	haven't found better (for info on the adapter)
2008-05-10T03:07:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	i dunno then, lspci "sees" only pci-ids and them up in a list, maybe your chip isn't in that list
2008-05-10T03:08:00.000Z	vreer	saerg	indeed, cannot see it there
2008-05-10T03:09:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	how does windows (if you have that) identify it?
2008-05-10T03:13:00.000Z	saerg	vreer	sorry that i couldn't help, gtg now
