2011-08-14T03:38:00.000Z	tabakhase		could i dualboot a hibernated system?
2011-08-14T03:38:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	Yes, but only if the two systems don't share use of a partition.
2011-08-14T03:39:00.000Z	tabakhase	luigi	rly? great... will i just get grub after power button or is ther more needed to do?
2011-08-14T03:39:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	You will get the bootloader, yes.
2011-08-14T03:40:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	But what ActionParsnip said is true. Some BIOS systems are controlled by windows's extended power management.
2011-08-14T08:00:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	You're having windows boot problems?
2011-08-14T08:00:00.000Z	tabakhase	luigi	installed ubuntu, installed windows. installed grub from livecd, grub->windows worked, grub->ubuntu worked, grub->windows sont work annymore?! windows is 5 minutes ago, commands issued during the ubuntu session: none, just reboot. ideas? (windows stops with black screen blinkin coursor)
2011-08-14T08:01:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	Try a different bootloader first.
2011-08-14T08:02:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	Go install ms-sys
2011-08-14T08:02:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	And then try ms-sys -7 /dev/sda HOWEVER IT MAY BREAK THE BOOTLOADER ON THE SYSTEM SO HAVE A LIVE CD
2011-08-14T08:09:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	Did it boot?
2011-08-14T08:11:00.000Z	tabakhase	luigi	urlin2u blinking coursor after "verifying DMI pool data" from bios, no reaction to F8
2011-08-14T08:12:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	This might be a stretch, but are you sure you didn't unmount the windows drive forcefully?
2011-08-14T08:13:00.000Z	tabakhase	luigi	for sure im not sure...
2011-08-14T08:13:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	In addition to what urlin2u said, I would also run a chkdisk on your windows partitions.
2011-08-14T08:21:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	You didn't destroy your windows system partition, did you?
2011-08-14T08:22:00.000Z	tabakhase	luigi	if that happend it wasnt me, i just booted and as u see my fstab is clear
2011-08-14T08:24:00.000Z	luigi	tabakhase	Congrats. Looks like the problem was with grub.
