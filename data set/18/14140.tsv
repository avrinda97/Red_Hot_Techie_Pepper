2005-09-12T14:47:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		hmm - i'm running ubuntu on a very slow computer (233, 48mb ram).  Where can i find some tips on speeding it up?
2005-09-12T14:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	ditch gnome and run fluxbox (or maybe xfce)
2005-09-12T15:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	do you have another ubuntu machine?
2005-09-12T15:08:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Seveas	- is it impossible to change from Gnome to something else without the laptop connecting to the net?
2005-09-12T15:08:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	yes, but hard...
2005-09-12T15:08:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Seveas	- :-(
2005-09-12T15:10:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Seveas	- basically - at the moment ubuntu is unusable on this machine as it is so slow. is there any otehr way i can improve?
2005-09-12T15:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	use no GUI at all :)

2005-09-15T05:20:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	uname -r
2005-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	To make xmms or beep-media-player actually play things, change the audio output plugin to eSound
2005-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Seveas	it can play cd's ok - is that still the right way to go?
2005-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	yes
2005-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	yw :)
2005-09-20T12:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	2400 isn't 2500, find proper instructions for your card...
2005-09-20T12:28:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Seveas	i was advised that the instructions would work
2005-09-20T12:29:00.000Z	Seveas	Lunar_Lamp	then ask the one who advised you that..
