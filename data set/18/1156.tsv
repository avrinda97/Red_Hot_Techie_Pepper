2011-05-13T21:42:00.000Z	ttytt		hi
2011-05-13T21:43:00.000Z	ttytt		just installed Natty and I have severe text display issues: the letters of words appear broken all over the place
2011-05-13T21:43:00.000Z	ttytt		mostly in Thunderbird and Chromium
2011-05-13T21:43:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ttytt	you running flash at the moment?
2011-05-13T21:44:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	only Thunderbird , Xchat, and system monitor
2011-05-13T21:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ttytt	can you post a screenshot?
2011-05-13T21:45:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	yeah, 1 sec

2011-05-13T21:50:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	that's a word the displays in Thunderbird incorrectly, amongst many others in every single email
2011-05-13T21:51:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	did you get the link?
2011-05-13T21:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ttytt	interesting, the only thing i've seen like this involved a rendering issue with flash, but if you're not using flash then i can't think whats causing it
2011-05-13T21:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ttytt	you using nvidia?
2011-05-13T21:53:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	I'm in Classic right now, let me change to Unity or without effects and I'll see what happens
2011-05-13T21:53:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	no, i don't even have a graphics card
2011-05-13T21:53:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	I'll be back soon and will let you know
2011-05-13T22:03:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	no change when loading in Unity
2011-05-13T22:03:00.000Z	ttytt	ThinkT510	i think it's even a graphics issue. The windows borders and buttons sometimes have white lines through them
2011-05-13T22:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ttytt	yeah, sounds like a graphics issue to me too, better ask the channel; somebody who knows better than me might be able to help
