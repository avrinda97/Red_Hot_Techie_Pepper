2008-01-12T03:31:00.000Z	Dragon67		by image i mean ios
2008-01-12T03:31:00.000Z	cdecarlo	Dragon67	From what I've learned so far about tftp you don't want to use it to transfers backups of anything
2008-01-12T03:31:00.000Z	cdecarlo	Dragon67	b/c it uses UDP to transfer the data
2008-01-12T03:32:00.000Z	Dragon67	cdecarlo	in cisco router in order to back up their image i need to have tftp server that is the way that router can communicate with windows or linux
2008-01-12T03:32:00.000Z	Dragon67		i know about windows but new to linux
2008-01-12T03:32:00.000Z	Dragon67	cdecarlo	udp 69
2008-01-12T03:33:00.000Z	cdecarlo	Dragon67	are you talking about Trivial FTP
2008-01-12T03:33:00.000Z	Dragon67	cdecarlo	yes
2008-01-12T03:34:00.000Z	cdecarlo	Dragon67	and the only way for the cisco router to communicate with other machines is through tftp?
2008-01-12T03:34:00.000Z	Dragon67		i have read this article but do not work for me:http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/tftp.htm
