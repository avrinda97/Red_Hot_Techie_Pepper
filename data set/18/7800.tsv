2007-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	dmi3on	desertc	i didnt sat any
2007-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	desertc	dmi3on	You'll need to boot to the livecd and look at what the user is in /home
2007-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	desertc	dmi3on	You always set one.
2007-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	dmi3on	desertc	how ?
2007-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	desertc	dmi3on	Alternatively, reinstall but be more careful what you put as a user name and password.
2007-11-16T00:27:00.000Z	dmi3on	desertc	reboot com. and again run from CDroom is still saying incorrect pass user
2007-11-16T00:28:00.000Z	desertc	dmi3on	Your LiveCD says incorrect password?
2007-11-16T00:29:00.000Z	desertc	dmi3on	makes no sense

2007-11-16T00:31:00.000Z	desertc	dmi3on	I don't know what you are saying. The Live CD doesn't ask for a password.
