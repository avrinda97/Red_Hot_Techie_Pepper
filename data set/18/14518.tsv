2007-01-08T14:45:00.000Z	Bhaskar		data on  FAT is format from UBUNTu, how can i recover these data
2007-01-08T14:47:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	you made a backup of your linux files onto a fat partition?
2007-01-08T14:47:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	then I do not understand your question. please rephrase
2007-01-08T14:50:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	you probably can not. maybe there is a disk recovery tool out there somewhere but there is no obvious way.
2007-01-08T14:52:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	there is a way to undelete data from an ext2 partition called "recover". but i have no idea if there exist a similar tool for FAT partitions
2007-01-08T14:54:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	maybe "mondo" can help but I haven't tested it
2007-01-08T14:56:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	I just read a bit about mondo and it seems it supports vfat (which is fat32). maybe you should try it "sudo apt-get install mondo"
2007-01-08T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	you don't need a link. simply type "sudo apt-get install mondo" in a terminal and it will be downloaded and installed automatically
2007-01-08T14:58:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	ah. I will see what I can find
2007-01-08T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/m/mondo/
2007-01-08T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	this is probably what you want http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/m/mondo/mondo_2.20-1.1_i386.deb
2007-01-08T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	you will need to download these to get it fully installed (find them from the same place as I gave you before, do some digging): afio buffer gawk libfuse2 libntfs8 lzop mindi mindi-busybox mondo ms-sys ntfsprogs syslinux
2007-01-08T15:07:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	i don't really know. maybe i gave you the link to the wrong version...
2007-01-08T15:10:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	try this one http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/m/mondo/mondo_2.06-1_i386.deb
2007-01-08T15:11:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	I have 6.06 as well and when I apt-get it that version is what is installed
2007-01-08T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	these are the versions that got installed for me http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/815/
2007-01-08T15:14:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	do some digging for the correct files at http://archive.ubuntu.com
2007-01-08T15:16:00.000Z	Jowi	Bhaskar	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/ . gawk, libntfs8 libfuse2 ntfsprogs and syslinux are in "main", the others in "universe"
