2009-05-10T15:09:00.000Z	bassliner		how do i change my default browser from firefox to epiphany? like that one that opens when i click a link in evolution?
2009-05-10T15:09:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	update-alternatives perhaps.. not sure though
2009-05-10T15:10:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	ah.. what Eevee said sounds much better, go with that
2009-05-16T16:07:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	nptd misconfigured or trying to set the time right slowly
2009-05-16T16:08:00.000Z	bassliner	Slart	any buzzwords i could google for to find something out about the misconfigured?
2009-05-16T16:08:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	afaik you don't want to change the time in a big leap.. it's far better to slowly adjust the clock over a longer period of time
2009-05-16T16:08:00.000Z	bassliner	Slart	the main question still remains, how do i find out why it was 50sec off with ntpd running?
2009-05-16T16:08:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	does "ntpd" count as a buzzword? =) ..
2009-05-16T16:08:00.000Z	bassliner	Slart	bah :)
2009-05-16T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	I've got a suggestion though.. set the time to something way more wrong.. something like 6 hours off.. then try restarting ntpd
2009-05-16T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	it might come to the conclusion that 6 hours is way to much to adjust for in a slow manner and might set it to the correct time right away
2009-05-16T16:10:00.000Z	bassliner	Slart	thanks.
2009-05-16T16:11:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	if it's actually running and actively adjusting time at all.. from what I remember it isn't really obvious if it's running or not.. if it's running you should get messages in the syslog when it syncs and stuff.. a couple of those per day or so
2009-05-16T16:11:00.000Z	bassliner	Slart	i don't see anything containing "stratum" in the output of ntpq tho
2009-05-16T16:11:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	hang on.. let me check my configurations.. see if I get any flashbacks to when I set it up
2009-05-16T16:13:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	here's my ntp.conf, for comparison, http://pastebin.com/f18647a26
2009-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	bassliner	Slart	thanks too :)
2009-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	Slart	bassliner	you're welcome
