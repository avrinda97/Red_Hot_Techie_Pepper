2008-05-12T17:19:00.000Z	laeg		hardy pulseaudio >>> i have tried to disable pulseaudio because it is bugged via the ubuntu instructions by choosing alsa for all options in system > prefs > sound but still when i have any program using sound in the background i don't get sound in any other apps. i have also disabled PulseAudio Session Management on startup in system > prefs > by unchecking but not completely removing from the list but still when i log in grep aux | pulse reports pulseaudio
2008-05-12T17:20:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	why you want to remove pulse? the std alsa in hardy doesnt come with dmix, you dont have software mixing, which means you cant play sound from multiple sources without pulseaudio or some other sound server
2008-05-12T17:21:00.000Z	laeg	mgolisch	i can't play sound from multiple source atm.
2008-05-12T17:21:00.000Z	laeg	mgolisch	except firefox and vlc with libflashsupport
2008-05-12T17:21:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	mostlikely those apps you use are not configure to use pulse
2008-05-12T17:22:00.000Z	laeg	mgolisch	wine won't use it because it's trouble
2008-05-12T17:22:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	who cares for wine?
2008-05-12T17:23:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	play on a game console
2008-05-12T17:23:00.000Z	laeg	mgolisch	that is not a solution.
2008-05-12T17:34:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	did you try to configure wine to use the esd driver? and install the pulseaudio esd compatibility package?
2008-05-12T17:34:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	maybe that would work out
2008-05-12T17:40:00.000Z	laeg	mgolisch	arts and esd haven't been supported for a very long time
2008-05-12T17:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	did you try to use the esound sound plugin in wine? if that doesnt work just start wine using padsp which will create a virtual oss device that talks to pulseaudio
2008-05-12T17:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	iam quite sure one of the two options will work out to get wine play nice with pulse
2008-05-13T19:41:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	dpkg -l|grep searchstring
2008-05-13T19:42:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	you ll get used to if you use debian based distros for a while
2008-05-13T20:49:00.000Z	mgolisch	laeg	i guess its the replacement for esd
2008-05-13T21:19:00.000Z	laeg	mgolisch	ya but i don't understand what it was supposed to be doing for me. my sound works now that it's totally been removed and i can still do everything i could before
