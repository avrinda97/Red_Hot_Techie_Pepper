2010-10-20T11:34:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		I'm back
2010-10-20T11:34:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		Something happened
2010-10-20T11:34:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		Anyway, what do i do?
2010-10-20T11:36:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		Sorry, no, my internet stopped or something and i had to refresh the freenode webchat page
2010-10-20T11:36:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		No, where do i get them?
2010-10-20T11:37:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		done
2010-10-20T11:38:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2010-10-20T11:38:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		before that it says "linux-headers-2.6.35-22-generic is already the newest version. "
2010-10-20T11:38:00.000Z	MSPHKING_		So i think that means i already have that?
2010-10-20T11:38:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	then you already had the headers
2010-10-20T11:42:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	you'll probably also need "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2010-10-20T11:50:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	it'll be helpful to know what errors
2010-10-20T11:54:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	you're gonna have to mess with the code. I was hoping it was some missing lib.
2010-10-20T11:57:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	r5u870/usbcam/usbcam_util.c lines 163, 166 and 177. Different kernel, different source. Find out with what kernel it worked, take that source look at those line numbers.
2010-10-20T11:58:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	and even then it may not work with your current kernel.
2010-10-20T12:01:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	yes
2010-10-20T12:05:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	gz!
2010-10-20T12:06:00.000Z	jamfade	MSPHKING_	I think you should thank 3pei
