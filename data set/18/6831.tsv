2008-05-12T03:56:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		How do I get rid of a plugin in firefox that I don't want and replace it with one I do want? I accidentally installed a different plugin instead of flash and this plugin doesn't work with all of the sites flash did
2008-05-12T03:57:00.000Z	thingy	Computer|Nerd	name of the plugin?
2008-05-12T03:57:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		GCJ I think
2008-05-12T03:57:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		thingy GCJ I think
2008-05-12T03:58:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		thingy never mind
2008-05-12T03:58:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		the problem is that the shockwave flash 9.0 isn't working properly

2008-05-12T03:59:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd	thingy	no matter what site I go to that has flash on it, it makes me click a little play button in a circle and for some sites I click it but then it just goes black (ustream.tv for example)
2008-05-12T04:00:00.000Z	thingy	Computer|Nerd	You might have the mozilla-plugin-gnash package installed...which is an alternantive flash plugin. Try apt-get remove mozilla-plugin-gnash
2008-05-12T04:01:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		thingy ok, I did that; now what?
2008-05-12T04:02:00.000Z	thingy	Computer|Nerd	Did it uninstall that package?
2008-05-12T04:02:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd		thingy no, it went through a process, but then it said 0 installed 0 removed and so on
2008-05-12T04:02:00.000Z	Computer|Nerd	thingy	but I could've sworn that or something like that is what I have installed
2008-05-12T04:03:00.000Z	thingy	Computer|Nerd	can you copy and paste into pastebin the contents of your mozilla's about:plugins page?
