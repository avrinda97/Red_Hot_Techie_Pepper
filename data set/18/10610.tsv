2007-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	h1st0	nexttwo	You don't understand You need to do some reading.  You should not be logged in as root right now.
2007-09-25T16:20:00.000Z	h1st0	nexttwo	you have synaptic and apt-get going or two instances trying to install software
2007-09-25T16:20:00.000Z	h1st0	nexttwo	or that.
2007-09-25T16:21:00.000Z	h1st0	nexttwo	you need to sudo apt-get
2007-09-25T16:21:00.000Z	h1st0	nexttwo	if you did and you are getting that error then you have update-manager or synaptic open also
2007-09-25T16:21:00.000Z	h1st0	nexttwo	you can onlyhave one peice of software open trying to install stuff at a time.
