2010-11-27T17:26:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	dunno i knoe some do not support ap mode i assume all can do ad-hoc
2010-11-27T17:26:00.000Z	gynter		What i'm trying to achive is that I get my connection from wlan0 and I want to bridge it with eth0
2010-11-27T17:27:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	why would you bridge wireless to a wired
2010-11-27T17:28:00.000Z	gynter	gogeta	because I don't have long cable :) temporary solution
2010-11-27T17:28:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	umm
2010-11-27T17:28:00.000Z	gynter		ap -> laptop -> desktop
2010-11-27T17:28:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	so just use wireless
2010-11-27T17:29:00.000Z	gynter		desktop doens't got wireless
2010-11-27T17:29:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	or do you mean ics to another pc
2010-11-27T17:29:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	its not bridging you whant you whant ics
2010-11-27T17:30:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	go to network-manager in system slect auto eth0 in the ipv4 setting set it to shared with other pcs
2010-11-27T17:30:00.000Z	gynter	gogeta	the idea is not to make a gateway from my laptop, I don't want 2 routers
2010-11-27T17:30:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	you have enabled ics
2010-11-27T17:30:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	well to share to te desktop thats how you do it
2010-11-27T17:31:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	briding only makes 2 card act as one
2010-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	like if you have 2 internet connections
2010-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	gogeta	gynter	to share a connection with another pc you use ics
