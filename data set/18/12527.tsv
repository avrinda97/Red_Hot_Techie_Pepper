2006-04-07T08:24:00.000Z	eternaljoy-		if I delete a file, and then empty trashcan!  Is there any way to get the file back and undelete it?
2006-04-07T08:24:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	nope
2006-04-07T08:25:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	its easy in MS windows :P why not Ubuntu?
2006-04-07T08:25:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	well, not unless you're willing to spend lots of money on data recovery.
2006-04-07T08:25:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	so how come Ubuntu is so secure in deleting files?
2006-04-07T08:26:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	hmm.  I wasn't aware that was so easy in windows.  I mean, it's easy before you empty the trash, sure.  that's what the trash is for.  but when you empty the trash, that's it.  you've permanently deleted your files.
2006-04-07T08:28:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	mauper says I can undelete the files but you say no! who is right? :P
2006-04-07T08:28:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	well, listen to me or not.  you're not going to be able to do it yourself.  not without a whole lot of effort anyhow.  if at all.  if you're willing to spend a bunch of money, then maybe...
2006-04-07T08:29:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	but mauper says there are tools for free
2006-04-07T08:29:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	is he right?
2006-04-07T08:29:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	nope.
2006-04-07T08:29:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	so mauper is talking nonsense? :P
2006-04-07T08:29:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	he's probably talking about an ext2 recovery tool.
2006-04-07T08:29:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	it's big news to me if there's something out for ext3.
2006-04-07T08:30:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	wont a ext2 recovery tool undelete my files?
2006-04-07T08:30:00.000Z	eternaljoy-	Codename_V	isnt ext2 and ext3 the same to recover files?
2006-04-07T08:30:00.000Z	Codename_V	eternaljoy-	scroll up man.
