2007-12-05T17:59:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz		i'm trying to run no-ip, but it keeps saying it can't find the config file
2007-12-05T18:00:00.000Z	wols_	corruptionoflulz	exact error. no paraphrasing
2007-12-05T18:00:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz		$ no-ip
2007-12-05T18:00:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz		Can't locate configuration file /etc/no-ip.conf. (Try -c). Ending!
2007-12-05T18:00:00.000Z	wols_	corruptionoflulz	can't you read? it exactly tells you which config file it wants
2007-12-05T18:01:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	wols_	but then it still tells me that it can't locate it
2007-12-05T18:01:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz		~$ no-ip -c /etc/no-ip.conf
2007-12-05T18:01:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz		Can't locate configuration file /etc/no-ip.conf. (Try -c). Ending!
2007-12-05T18:02:00.000Z	wols_	corruptionoflulz	what part of what I wrote didn't you undestand? why are you unable to check if /etc//no-ip.conf exists and if not create it?
2007-12-05T18:02:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	wols_	exists, and i used -C to create once
2007-12-05T18:02:00.000Z	wols_	corruptionoflulz	it fscking doesn't exist. are you  analphabetic?
2007-12-05T18:02:00.000Z	wols_		is no-ip using a chroot?
2007-12-05T18:03:00.000Z	wols_		what are the permissions of the file?
2007-12-05T18:03:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	wols_	permissions were all at root, then i changed it to my user hoping that would fix it
2007-12-05T18:05:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	wols_	ok, i tried deleting the config file then making a new one with -C, but now i'm getting permission denied.
2007-12-05T18:07:00.000Z	wols_	corruptionoflulz	chmod a+r <file>
2007-12-05T18:08:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	wols_	how what would i use to give write access too?
2007-12-05T18:10:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	wols_	thanks a lot! i think i've got it now!
