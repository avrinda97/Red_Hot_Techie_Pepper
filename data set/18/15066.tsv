2005-11-30T11:52:00.000Z	pztak		in the 2nd part of install, while configuring the packages, it had some problem, and quit, now i only see a login screen.. how do i relaunch that configuration?
2005-11-30T11:53:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	You will have to reconfigure packages in which there was a problem. But anyways. If you see login screen that means mostl things are alright.
2005-11-30T11:53:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	i dont know which ones caused the problem.. stuff like 'man' though are missing
2005-11-30T11:54:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	as well as X
2005-11-30T11:55:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	Can you login to computer?
2005-11-30T11:56:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	yes, but in console
2005-11-30T11:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	Applications->System Tools->System Monitor
2005-11-30T11:57:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	Sorry, that was for pc22
2005-11-30T11:58:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	it's ok, any ideas on how to get this to work.. i've never had so much trouble installing ubuntu on a machine.. i've run it through installation way too many times..
2005-11-30T11:59:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-11-30T12:02:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	it says package isn't installed.. i get the feeling that more than one packages didn't get installed.. why can't i just rerun the part2 of install that launches on boot? does it erase itself?
2005-11-30T12:02:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	Do one thing then. 'sudo apt-get -f install ubuntu-desktop' This will install the packages needed.
2005-11-30T12:03:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	ok, trying, once it's done, what do i do?
2005-11-30T12:03:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	Reboot. :-D
2005-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	will do. any ideas on why the installation would have problems on a fresh new install? is it a sign that's something's wrong with the harddrives or something?
2005-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	No it may be sign that CD is not properly burnt, or simply failure of CDROM drive
2005-11-30T12:05:00.000Z	pztak	onkarshinde	but the cd wasn't in.. it was in the second part of the install.. where it says to remove the cd.. (after the first reboot in the install)...
2005-11-30T12:06:00.000Z	onkarshinde	pztak	May the packages wasn't copied properly to har disk's tmp area. Leave the reason. See if my suggestion solves your problem
