2011-10-30T12:14:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java seems outdated. It mentions lucid mirrors.
2011-10-30T12:15:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	it says, for instance: sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"   Should I really do that in 11.10? I already have deb http://archive.canonical.com oneiric partner
2011-10-30T12:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	tdn	 i just use the java in the repos.. i dont bother with orcal's java any more
2011-10-30T12:19:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	well, I need the non-free one.
2011-10-30T12:28:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	so there are no mirrors anymore?
2011-10-30T12:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	tdn	  unoffical and perhaps less then legal ppa's i hear.. but i dont need the orcale java for anything i do. so i just use the icedtea java
2011-10-30T12:29:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	is there a de-facto official PPA?
2011-10-30T12:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	tdn	 orcale says   NO.. to such a thing i belive.
2011-10-30T12:30:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	ok, but you said that there is PPAs I can use, right?
2011-10-30T12:31:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	maybe it should be updated.
2011-10-30T12:32:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	not even sure how to download and install it from java.com? It does not provide a .deb. What to do?
2011-10-30T12:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	tdn	 you use their installer like the guides say.
2011-10-30T12:35:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	ok.
2011-10-30T12:39:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	http://p.adora.dk/P2210.html
2011-10-30T12:39:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	think the ppa is down?
2011-10-30T12:39:00.000Z	tdn	dr_willis	or not available for oneiric?
2011-10-30T12:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	tdn	 no idea.. i dont use it..
