2009-04-11T16:11:00.000Z	kn100		is there any way to bypass the ubuntu logon screen, so it boots straight into gnome?
2009-04-11T16:12:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	You could configure it to login automatically.
2009-12-16T00:49:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	Have you tried repartitioning it? (With 'gparted' or 'parted' or 'cfdisk')
2009-12-16T00:49:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	gparted just formats it back to 16gb
2009-12-16T00:50:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	You tried completely deleting all partitions and recreating them?
2009-12-16T00:50:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	^
2009-12-16T00:51:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	Ah, in that case I really doubt there is any "low-level format" tool. They usually don't exist for flash-based drives.
2009-12-16T00:51:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	i know there is a windows tool to do it
2009-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	but installing windows is painful
2009-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	You could try 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1024' or something (replace /dev/sdc with your flashdrive), that would completely blank everything that Linux can write to.
2009-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	it can write to the fake sectors
2009-12-16T00:53:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	But, I have a feeling this was done by reprogramming the chip inside...
2009-12-16T00:53:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	no no no
2009-12-16T00:53:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	(Btw, I know someone who bought a "Made in China" 16 GB pendrive, and it turned out to be 1 _kilo_byte.)
2009-12-16T00:53:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	that is total ownage
2009-12-16T00:55:00.000Z	grawity	kn100	Would you happen to have the Windows program available for download? (I'm interested)
2009-12-16T00:55:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	yes, its HP format tool
2009-12-16T01:00:00.000Z	kn100	grawity	;)
