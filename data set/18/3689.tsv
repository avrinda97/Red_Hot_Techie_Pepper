2009-08-18T17:34:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		happened before and now it happened again
2009-08-18T17:35:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		hmmmm
2009-08-18T17:37:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		hello
2009-08-18T17:37:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		I just downloaded the new system updates on jaunty and now I can't log onto it
2009-08-18T17:37:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		happened before and now it happened again
2009-08-18T17:39:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		ok, here's another question, how do I restore my last working settings?
2009-08-18T17:40:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		I doubt that's the reason, I have a 40Gb partition made solely for ubuntu
2009-08-18T17:40:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		and I just installed it a couple of days ago
2009-08-18T17:40:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		I updated to jaunty, and today updated again
2009-08-18T17:41:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		it loads then gives me a dark purple screen and then black and goes on like that for a minute or so then stops
2009-08-18T17:42:00.000Z	deany	JeoTheLeo	sounds like a video driver issue
2009-08-18T17:42:00.000Z	deany	JeoTheLeo	try recovery mode and choose fix X
2009-08-18T17:43:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo	deany	I tried recovery mode
2009-08-18T17:44:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		ok
2009-08-18T17:44:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		I'll try that
2009-08-18T17:44:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo		anything else to try?
2009-08-18T17:45:00.000Z	deany	JeoTheLeo	might be compiz failing to load, tried metacity --replace from console?
2009-08-18T17:45:00.000Z	JeoTheLeo	deany	nope
