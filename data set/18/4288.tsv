2009-11-30T01:53:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		Hi, I can't Request Free CDs from shipit anymore, but I really need one this time because my laptop wont read the ones I burn for some weird reason !
2009-11-30T01:54:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	if you have a flash drive, you can create a bootable usb
2009-11-30T01:57:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TuTUXG	I dont really have one right now :/ but i will purchase one soon, there is not any other solution ?
2009-11-30T01:58:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	or you can try to burn the disk from your friend's pc, for myself i'd always use a flash drive since it's pretty easy to create
2009-11-30T02:00:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TuTUXG	hmmm thanks man but what could be the reason ??? it used to read them before I even tried using different brands of CD-Rs
2009-11-30T02:00:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TuTUXG	might be some driver problem ?
2009-11-30T02:00:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	i have really no idea, it could be your cd-rom's problem, or the disk's problem
2009-11-30T02:01:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	personally i haven't burn and cd/dvd in a long time...
2009-11-30T02:02:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	burned* any* cd/dvd
2009-11-30T02:04:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	Out_Cold is right...
2009-11-30T02:05:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	it could take a long time for the shipment
2009-11-30T02:05:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TuTUXG	any guide on how to install using flash driver ( I know how boot from it in BIOS )
2009-11-30T02:07:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	check out the program called unetbootin
2009-11-30T02:07:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	it could run on both win and linux
2009-11-30T02:07:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	but first of all you need to make sure your laptop support boot from usb device
2009-11-30T02:08:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TuTUXG	it does, I saw it once 'Boot from USB flash memory'
2009-11-30T02:09:00.000Z	TuTUXG	Black_Phantom	you can use the one you got
2009-11-30T02:09:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	TuTUXG	cool ok thanks alot :)
