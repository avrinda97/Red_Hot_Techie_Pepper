2009-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	Psinetic		ok i need someone to SERIOUSLY help me now. Yesterday I was on for three hours trying to figure out why i couldn't install anything from command line or use the update manager. Turns out it's because for some reason the system wouldn't let go of the Tor proxy i set systemwide. Even though I went into Network Proxy and disabled it system wide, it STILL looks for it.

2009-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	Psinetic		m-ubuntu-9-04/ which tells me to run this command: unset http_proxy. I ran it and it worked. Now the problem has started up again, and that command won't fix it...so what the??? o.0

2009-10-30T06:54:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Psinetic	Stop repeating yourself.
2009-10-30T06:54:00.000Z	Psinetic	Mike_lifeguard	then someone answer the question >_> and Ben wanted to know the questoin, so i told him. READ my friend, READ
2009-10-30T06:55:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Psinetic	Maybe you didn't notice that folks here are volunteers. Flooding the channel with the same question repeatedly is a guaranteed way to not get help.
2009-10-30T06:56:00.000Z	Psinetic	Mike_lifeguard	well asking the question doesn't seem to get answers, so what do you expect me to do? just sit here and pray and hope that someone actually answers me? i understand what you're saying, i ask you to understand what i'm saying.
2009-10-30T06:57:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Psinetic	That's because nobody so far knows how to help you. Deal with it. Again: people here are volunteers. Some of us, being human, don't know everything and therefore cannot help you. Unfortunately, all the ones who *do* know everything are bots and thus not terribly helpful.
2009-10-30T06:58:00.000Z	Psinetic	Mike_lifeguard	thank you for your help.
2009-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Psinetic	p.defau.lt is better
2009-10-30T07:18:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Psinetic	do-release-upgrade ?
