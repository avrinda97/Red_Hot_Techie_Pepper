2010-11-15T08:38:00.000Z	ghostnik11		i pluged in a wireless usb 2.0 adapter and it worked as soon as it was plugged in but a probably occurred after about 30 mins it suddenly stopped working and I am think b/c i have not installed the drivers, i put in the cd but it only comes up as windows exe file installation
2010-11-15T08:38:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	it's not drivers
2010-11-15T08:38:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	okay, whats the problem?
2010-11-15T08:39:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	is it plugged into a hub?
2010-11-15T08:40:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	no its plugged into the back of the desktop computer on an lubuntu 10.10
2010-11-15T08:40:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	what file system is it formatted with?
2010-11-15T08:41:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	ext4, the latest filesystem which is ext4
2010-11-15T08:41:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	what happens when you unplug it and then plug it back in?
2010-11-15T08:41:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	it works again
2010-11-15T08:42:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	for another 30 minutes?
2010-11-15T08:42:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	yeah or less time
2010-11-15T08:42:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	does the drive have it's own power supply?
2010-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	i don't think so, its just the usb that is built into my motherboard
2010-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	no I mean the external drive..
2010-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	no its just a usb wireless adapter, when i plug it in, its green led lights up and then it comes up but for some reason it then chips out and stops working
2010-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	I thought we were talking about an external usb harddrive.. formatted with ext4.. not a wireless adaptor
2010-11-15T08:48:00.000Z	ghostnik11	izinucs	sorry my fault, no i am having problems with an usb wireless adaptor, thats why i was asking about drivers and getting the drivers installed from the cd into lubuntu 10.10 so it does not stop after 30 mins
2010-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	izinucs	ghostnik11	whole different topic.. sorry I'm not much good with wireless adaptors.. I've been lucky with a little advanced planning.  however if it connects and then times out for some reason then it *might* be a driver problem.. or something else.
