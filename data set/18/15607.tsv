2007-03-24T07:04:00.000Z	j^		hi, i have a problem
2007-03-24T07:04:00.000Z	j^		i have an ubuntu box that does not have internet
2007-03-24T07:04:00.000Z	j^		i now want to install a package from universe
2007-03-24T07:05:00.000Z	j^		whats the best way to get a package from universe and all its dependencies from the net to put it on a cd / usb disk?
2007-03-24T07:06:00.000Z	ompaul	j^	so go bring machine to interenet that was what it was meant for, or put the .deb from another machine onto a cd or something and carry it to other machine and there in try "dpkg -i package-name.deb"  get the package with a web browser from your local download site
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	j^	ompaul	waiting for the internet connection, but have to get the box running now
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	ompaul		J^ I just told you how to do it
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z	j^	ompaul	the problem is that its not just one package but its dependencies too, just hoped there would be an easy way to get one package and all its dependencies via a simple script to put it on a cd
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z	ompaul	j^	got a second ubuntu box?
2007-03-24T07:09:00.000Z	ompaul	j^	so take the packages one at a time and when it says I need X then go get that also
2007-03-24T07:09:00.000Z	j^	ompaul	that too yes, with the packages installed
2007-03-24T07:09:00.000Z	j^		i dont want to take one at a time, that was my point
2007-03-24T07:09:00.000Z	ompaul	j^	apt-cache show package-name
2007-03-24T07:10:00.000Z	j^	ompaul	recursive dependencies?
2007-03-24T07:12:00.000Z	ompaul	j^	you might have to do a little more work but for fun and learning do apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop
2007-03-24T07:13:00.000Z	j^	ompaul	im using linux for many years, i know apt-cache, my question was if there is an easy way to get a package with all its dependencies from the net, so far the answer is: no
2007-03-24T07:15:00.000Z	ompaul	j^	you have said that you have two machines, with the second with having all the required packages so tar cvf foo.tar var cache apt archives and move the lot of them over do a dpkg -i yourfavoritepackage.deb and it will pull from the stuff that is there - want to do updates also look at apt-zip
2007-03-24T07:17:00.000Z	j^	ompaul	the seonds is not a new installation it just has the packages installed, not just installed,
