2012-09-02T08:01:00.000Z	Halfalife		My router is on the other side of the house.
2012-09-02T08:02:00.000Z	Halfalife		Are you using Backtrack?
2012-09-02T08:02:00.000Z	Halfalife		I've had issues with running it from Ubuntu.
2012-09-02T08:03:00.000Z	Halfalife		It should work in Backtrack.
2012-09-02T08:03:00.000Z	Halfalife		In Ubuntu, it doesn't seem to allow switching channels.
2012-09-02T08:03:00.000Z	Halfalife		I don't think it'll work outside of Backtrack.
2012-09-02T08:04:00.000Z	Halfalife		If you need to use those tools, just use BT.
2012-09-02T08:05:00.000Z	Halfalife		I've tried it on Intel, Atheros, and Ralink adapters.
2012-09-02T08:05:00.000Z	Halfalife		and it hasn't worked in Ubuntu for any of them, for me at least.
2012-09-02T08:06:00.000Z	Halfalife		Well, technically Backtrack is Ubuntu.
