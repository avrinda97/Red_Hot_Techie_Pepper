2010-06-05T20:34:00.000Z	shubbar		 i m installing a printer and it requires libstdc++5, but on synaptic i can find only libstdc++6 and its already installed
2010-06-05T20:34:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	trying a very old driver?
2010-06-05T20:35:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	 latest from manufacturer
2010-06-05T20:36:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	none ubuntu supplied ones work?
2010-06-05T20:38:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	i ll try the ubuntu supplied model again, may be it can work this time.
2010-06-05T20:38:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	well maybe you can get libstd5c++ somewhere still, but iirc its getting old
2010-12-15T23:45:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	depends, can you still dump the disk as a raw image?
2010-12-15T23:46:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	i still can see 2.6 GB used of the 8GB
2010-12-15T23:46:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	i don't know how to dump raw file
2010-12-15T23:47:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	is the disk damaged somehow or did your just lose a file that you are trying to recover?
2010-12-15T23:48:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	if the latter the linked wiki page may have some pointers, as long as you dont write to the disk like add new files you stand a good chance of recovering a file since its probably using something like FAT
2010-12-15T23:48:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	seems my card reader corrupted the SD card, it was reading them fine in the camera
2010-12-15T23:49:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	when i returned it to the camera it wanted to format the card
2010-12-15T23:51:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	may just be a software error and not an issue with the disk.
2010-12-15T23:52:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	maybe, but know i want to recover my photos
2010-12-15T23:56:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	try what ersul linked, that program has given me good results in the past too.
2010-12-15T23:59:00.000Z	acicula	shubbar	it grabs files out of a disk or image
2010-12-15T23:59:00.000Z	shubbar	acicula	then how to dump the image?
