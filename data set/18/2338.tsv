2011-03-31T16:30:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	just run the installer, it will automaticly delete your old system
2011-03-31T16:30:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	you want to use the whole disc?
2011-03-31T16:31:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	then tell the installer he should use the 10gb partition to build there /boot / /swap and so on
2011-03-31T16:32:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	/home is a subdirectory from /
2011-03-31T16:32:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	/ is the startpoint of your system
2011-03-31T16:32:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	best thing is to let the installer create a partition layout
2011-03-31T16:33:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	first, why you need to reinstall?
2011-03-31T16:34:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	kernel-panik or just a black screen/some other errors?
2011-03-31T16:35:00.000Z	iceroot	machine_	only at windows you need to reinstall :)
