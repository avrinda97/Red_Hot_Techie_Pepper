2007-12-17T00:30:00.000Z	Gre2		I think
2007-12-17T00:30:00.000Z	Gre2		maybe
2007-12-17T00:31:00.000Z	Gre2		not so sure
2007-12-17T00:32:00.000Z	Gre2		Forgive my ignorance, however, I have the CD in the drive, I'm in Gnome with the little Install icon on the desktop.  The DL is 1% from... nm, it's done... if I double-click on it, will my computer blow up?
2007-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	Gre2		I sure hope it doesn't because I still have half a bag of Cheez-Its left and I don't want them to end up wallpapering my computer room.
2007-12-17T00:34:00.000Z	Gre2		Gonna click it...
2007-12-17T00:34:00.000Z	Gre2		wish me luck...
2007-12-17T00:36:00.000Z	Gre2		Hrm.  Okay Linux pro's:  nothing happened.  It opened the Archive Manager.  Do I need to extract the 7.10 iso file?
2007-12-17T00:36:00.000Z	Gre2		No CDs astro.
2007-12-17T00:37:00.000Z	Gre2		Can I run it from the computer.  Some said yes, some said no
2007-12-17T00:37:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	what are you trying to do?
2007-12-17T00:39:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	if you don't really have things you want to save i recomend fresh install. Upgrades can cause problems sometimes
2007-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	have a ubuntu 7.10 cd?
2007-12-17T00:41:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	then you can do a fresh 7.04 install and then just upgrade
2007-12-17T00:42:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	 you don't need to downlaod the 7.10 iso to upgrade
2007-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	use the safe graphics while you upgrade to 7.10
2007-12-17T01:00:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	what are you doing now?
2007-12-17T01:01:00.000Z	cleaton	Gre2	i private messaged you,
