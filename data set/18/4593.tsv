2009-07-25T02:31:00.000Z	nexsja		anybody has any ideas on how to turn my 64bit system into a 32bit system without loosing everything on the hdd and without reinstalling the system
2009-07-25T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	make a backup and reinstall
2009-07-25T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	why do you want to go to 32bit though?
2009-07-25T02:32:00.000Z	nexsja	jrib	too many issues
2009-07-25T02:32:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	like?
2009-07-25T02:33:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	that's unlikely to be because you are using 64bit instead of 32bit
2009-07-25T02:34:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	you should try a live cd of 32bit and 64bit to verify if the experience differs there
2009-07-25T02:35:00.000Z	nexsja	jrib	by the way, if i have 3 partitions, my /home/ on another partition, system on another, will i save all my settings if i just wipe the OS partition?
2009-07-25T02:35:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	all your user's settings will be saved
2009-08-03T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	have you run « sudo apt-get update » ?
2009-08-03T18:20:00.000Z	nexsja	jrib	not yet. I was thinking i'll run that later, when i'll get all the packages. I have to do that now, i understand?
2009-08-03T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	yes
2009-08-03T18:21:00.000Z	nexsja	jrib	okay, that'll fix it?
2009-08-03T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	apt-get update just refreshes package lists
2009-08-03T18:21:00.000Z	nexsja	jrib	oh, okay. :)
2009-08-03T18:31:00.000Z	nexsja	jrib	hm... still can't find the packages. Restart required?
2009-08-03T22:54:00.000Z	jrib	nexsja	"router", not "reuter"
