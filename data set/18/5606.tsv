2008-09-20T11:56:00.000Z	kevin__		so Adobe Flash is proprietary software and I understand that Ubuntu cannot supply this, but is there an open-source equivalent out there?
2008-09-20T11:56:00.000Z	kevin__		ok, thanks
2008-09-20T11:56:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	you can install flash using add/remove
2008-09-20T12:23:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	what is it youÂ´re trying to use? an external hard drive?
2008-09-20T12:24:00.000Z	kevin__	brandonmpace	I'm using a Western Digital External USB HD, and I want to saftely remove the device by stopping it before detaching.
2008-09-20T12:25:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	open up nautilus,  places  home or whatever. then in the left side you see the device listed?
2008-09-20T12:25:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	does it show up on your desktop?
2008-09-20T12:25:00.000Z	kevin__	brandonmpace	yes, the device is listed
2008-09-20T12:26:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	if it does, right click> unmount
2008-09-20T12:27:00.000Z	kevin__	brandonmpace	after unmounting the image, it still RUNS. I can still access it and the disk within still spins => not safe to remove.
2008-09-20T12:28:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	go to the /media folder      and tell me the name of the device
2008-09-20T12:30:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	Daft_Punk  is correct
2008-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	is your main hard disk sda? or hda?
2008-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	kevin__	brandonmpace	good question...is there an easy way to find out?
2008-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	go to the folder /dev
2008-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	brandonmpace	kevin__	tell me if there is and hda
2008-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	kevin__	brandonmpace	only a .udev/
