2010-06-02T05:54:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	dual booting causes lots of confusion .  suggest you start over, DO NOT import your windows accounts
2010-06-02T05:54:00.000Z	aosys		can anyone help me with major Ubuntu 10.04 install issues?
2010-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	aosys		ahh
2010-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	aosys		ok
2010-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	aosys		acerimmer: I thought that was the problem
2010-06-02T05:56:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	dual booting is a natural setup.  unlikely to cause probs beyond operator confusion
2010-06-02T05:56:00.000Z	aosys		acerimmer: so you suggest that I should go back and reinstall and just skip that import account part?
2010-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	you should have 2 windows partitions.  One restore part and athe normal system part.  Delete all other parts
2010-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	aosys		acerimmer: how do i delete partitions? what software should i use?
2010-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	it's on the ubuntu usb
2010-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	aosys		acerimmer: are you talking about gparted?
2010-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	yes me and gbillings
2010-06-02T05:59:00.000Z	aosys		acerimmer & gbillings: ok thanks a lot.
2010-06-02T05:59:00.000Z	aosys	gbillings	ok, so i just start it up and it is pretty staright forward?
2010-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	aosys		gbilligns: thanks again!
2010-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	when you get to the partitioning step, just don't touch those windows parts.
2010-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	aosys		acerimmer: ok, so all i do is delete the ubuntu ones?
2010-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	acerimmer_	aosys	right.
