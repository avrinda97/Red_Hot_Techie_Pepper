2008-10-31T12:37:00.000Z	stapel		anybody else have problems with fglrx drivers in 8.10?
2008-10-31T12:37:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	What card? Release notes have information about r3xx not working
2008-10-31T12:38:00.000Z	stapel		ati 128MB radeon HD2400 Pro
2008-10-31T12:39:00.000Z	stapel		sierra: does this affect me?
2008-10-31T12:39:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	Only if you use a card from that series
2008-10-31T12:39:00.000Z	stapel	Sierra	How can I check? ATI website?
2008-10-31T12:41:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	Are you using a laptop? Are you running Windows? You can check what video card you are running from it's control panel
2008-10-31T12:43:00.000Z	stapel	Sierra	No Windoze. Bought a brand new dell inspiron 530 desktop. Got it yesterday and immediately upgraded. Now 3d effects don't work, and driver from proprietry hardware can't be activated
2008-10-31T12:44:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	I'll check the stats online for you, hold a moment. I don't think though this particular issue will effect you since it's relevant to older ATIs but let me check first

2008-10-31T12:45:00.000Z	stapel	Sierra	thanx
2008-10-31T12:47:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	I can't seem to find what video card the dell inspiron 530 uses, apparently it's an intel one.
2008-10-31T12:49:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	According to the release notes "The ATI video driver in 8.10 drops support for video cards with r300 based chips (the Radeon 9500 - X600 Series of cards)"
2008-10-31T12:49:00.000Z	stapel	Sierra	No it's definetely ATI. 128MB radeon HD 2400
2008-10-31T12:51:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	Ahh ok then, then it doesn't appear relevant to that particular problem. I'm sorry but the only ATI gear I have is a Mobility X2300 so I can't assist you further
2008-10-31T12:51:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	Plenty of ATI users around though, keep trying or have a look on the ubuntu forums
2008-10-31T12:53:00.000Z	stapel	Sierra	thanx. Is a bit dissapointed though, that I spend money buying this exact machine from Dell, because I thought this way, I will know that all my hardware is supported
2008-10-31T12:54:00.000Z	Sierra	stapel	Personally I can't stand ATI, I find nVidia to be supported better despite what the group think says.
