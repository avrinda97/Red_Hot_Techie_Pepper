2008-08-18T01:34:00.000Z	bifkit		Is it possible to use mdadm to re-assemble a 4-disk ntfs RAID0+1 array without losing the data? Initially setup with mobo fakeraid, I believe.
2008-08-18T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	possible.. perhaps... practical.. not likely =/
2008-08-18T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	lots of important files on that raid?
2008-08-18T01:35:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	Any other recommendations?
2008-08-18T01:36:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	It's my storage array.  I kept pretty much everything on it in my Windows setup.
2008-08-18T01:36:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	well..start windows and copy the files over to something else.. buy a new motherboard if the old one is dead
2008-08-18T01:37:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	Windows install is long gone. Part of the motivation to switch to Ubuntu. :)
2008-08-18T01:37:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	I was in the same situation a couple of years back.. but then the motherboard was out of production.. I've still got the hard drives in a box
2008-08-18T01:38:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	So my best option is to reinstall Windows to make Ubuntu work? :)
2008-08-18T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	hehe.. well.. installing windows is pretty quick.. it shouldn't take more than a day to install, get the raid up and then copy the files somewhere else
2008-08-18T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	afaik yes.. there might be raid-gurus out there that can help you but that's what I'd do
2008-08-18T01:38:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	got a Terabyte external drive I could borrow? :)
2008-08-18T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	nah.. but I've got 3 internal ones. =/
2008-08-18T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	but those western digitial mybook drives are pretty neat.. you can use it for backup when you're done
2008-08-18T01:40:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	Now if I only had the money to buy one. :)
2008-08-18T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	ah.. can't help you there.. unfortunately
2008-08-18T01:41:00.000Z	Slart	bifkit	some advice for the future.. either go for real raid cards (the expensive ones).. or don't use raid at all.. (or pure software raid). Fakeraid isn't faster, better or cheaper.. it's just more likely to lose your files
2008-08-18T01:42:00.000Z	bifkit	Slart	Thanks for the tips.
