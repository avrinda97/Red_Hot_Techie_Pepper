2008-03-09T09:26:00.000Z	astheo		hi, my "appearance preferences windows" isnt working after i installed emrad..
2008-03-09T09:27:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	did you mean emerald?
2008-03-09T09:27:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	it's under Emerald theme manager
2008-03-09T09:33:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	: yup, but i cant get my emerald working so i uninstalled it. however when i tried to load the appearance window it is not working anymore. i can't click on the buttons
2008-03-09T09:34:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	do the buttons appear, or are they not there altogether
2008-03-09T09:36:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	: they all appear, but i can't click any of them. they are disabled or something
2008-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	push alt+F2 and type gtk-window-decorator
2008-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	change that
2008-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	gtk-window-decorator --replace
2008-03-09T09:40:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	it isnt working still, can i just uninstall it and install another one?
2008-03-09T09:40:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	don't uninstall the metacity, just leave it and install another one to replace it
2008-03-09T09:43:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	ok. iafter i did the gtk-window-decorator --replace..it is now broke even more
2008-03-09T09:43:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	did it disappear
2008-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	nope, still there but not all parts are present
2008-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	what do you mean by that
2008-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	all are disabled..the tab buttons on the top. so with the add, edit, and customize..
2008-03-09T09:49:00.000Z	cornfused	astheo	you may have to reboot after switching back to metacity
2008-03-09T09:53:00.000Z	astheo	cornfused	nothings changed. i still cant click anything on the appearance window
