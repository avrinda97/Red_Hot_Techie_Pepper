2008-10-19T13:40:00.000Z	devslashnull		what can i safely delete to save space on my file system
2008-10-19T13:41:00.000Z	devslashnull		any recommendations
2008-10-19T13:42:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	you better first find out what is eating your space. use something like baobab for example to pinpoint the space eaters and after that decide what to remove
2008-10-19T13:44:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	you can delete safely old log files for example. but you'll gain something only if their are big enough
2008-10-19T13:50:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	i ran disk analyzer and it shows /usr is using 1.7GB
2008-10-19T13:50:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	yep. but don't delete anything there
2008-10-19T13:57:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	do you compile your kernel or kernel modules for your kernel for yourself?
2008-10-19T13:58:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	ikonia  i am using an eee pc with 2.6.27-7
2008-10-19T13:59:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	if you don't compile the kernel or kernel modules you can deinstall the kernel source packages (which installed these folders)
2008-10-19T13:59:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	no lsb modulls description: ubuntu 8.04 release: 8.04 codename: hardy
2008-10-19T14:00:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	this was ikonia's question. i don't care about it. i was asking you something completely different
2008-10-19T14:03:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	i tried compiling this kernel module but i guess i dont need it so no i dont need to compile it myself
2008-10-19T14:04:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	if this is the case you can deinstall trough synaptic/apt-get/aptitude the kernel sources or headers. be careful not to remove the kernel image itself though ;-)
2008-10-19T14:04:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	where is the kernel image stored
2008-10-19T14:05:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	/boot
2008-10-19T14:05:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	oh ok
2008-10-19T14:05:00.000Z	devslashnull	velko	i have a 4GB sdhc card and i am moving it to there
2008-10-19T14:06:00.000Z	velko	devslashnull	do you know how to use synaptic? my suggestion is to use it for deinstallation instead of randomly deleting folders
