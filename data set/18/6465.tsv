2008-06-06T21:25:00.000Z	tj83		Stu.... just heavy openGL apps like google earth and games
2008-06-06T21:25:00.000Z	stu	tj83	I get the flickering with any video... any idea?
2008-06-06T21:25:00.000Z	tj83	stu	seems to be a refresh rate problem'
2008-06-06T21:25:00.000Z	tj83		no.. video playback with me is fine
2008-06-06T21:26:00.000Z	stu	tj83	this only just started happening though, its been perfect for weeks
2008-06-06T21:26:00.000Z	tj83		Stu.... i have found that xserver-xgl doesnt work well for me... xorg is what i am using.. video playback was very choppy for me under xgl
2008-06-06T21:27:00.000Z	stu	tj83	this will fix choppy video https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24/+bug/197639/comments/5
2008-06-06T21:28:00.000Z	tj83		stu... i'll look at that... but as said... xorg video is great... just not xgl.
2008-06-06T21:31:00.000Z	stu	tj83	how do I change to xorg video then? is this when you choose X11 video in your video player's preferences?
2008-06-06T21:31:00.000Z	tj83		specialchar.... what is that supposed to mean? Hey, I'm noob... and openly admit it... i take the approch that helping others is helping myself in the process..
2008-06-06T21:32:00.000Z	tj83		Stu... unless you changed to xgl for your xserver... then your still running xorg.
