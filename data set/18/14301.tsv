2008-10-11T18:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	are you using your bios raid? or you want to use linux software raid?
2008-10-11T18:50:00.000Z	zblach	erUSUL	it's fakeraid.
2008-10-11T18:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	the on you enable in you bios? then the fakeraid applies .... it is better to use linux software raid but if you have to share the raid with windows ...
2008-10-11T18:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	then why not use linux software raid it is better than fakeraid
2008-10-11T18:52:00.000Z	zblach	erUSUL	i had heard that swraid had some serious performance issues

2008-10-11T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	do you have a *real* *hardware* raid card?
2008-10-11T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	becouse most bios raid implementations are slower than linux software raid except the ones from high end *real* *hardware* raid cards
2008-10-11T18:54:00.000Z	zblach	erUSUL	no. embedded hardware assisted ICH9R
2008-10-11T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	then it will be slower than linux raid

2008-10-11T18:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	and in the test they use a raid card (not chipset integrated raid) and still is inferior
2008-10-11T18:58:00.000Z	zblach	erUSUL	i was using ubuntu for the dmraid support of raid5. if i use software raid, i'll go back to arch :D
2008-10-11T19:00:00.000Z	zblach	erUSUL	since i'm now using software raid, should I disable the onboard raid controller entirely?
2008-10-11T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	yep... configure the sata controller as "ahci"
2008-10-11T19:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	zblach	no problem
