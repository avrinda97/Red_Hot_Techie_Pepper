2006-10-23T07:29:00.000Z	lucaferr		why can't I see links to synaptic from the desktop/menus?  I'm running as a nis user.. do I need to belong to a certain group?
2006-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	yes, I don't think you will see taht unless you are in the "admin" group
2006-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic		*that
2006-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	lucaferr	thoreauputic	any way to modify the group name?
2006-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	i.e. have sudo rights
2006-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	lucaferr		I changed sudo.. through visudo
2006-10-23T07:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	you can't run synaptic unless you have sudo rights
2006-10-23T07:31:00.000Z	lucaferr		I fixed sudo, but the desktop still doesn't show synaptic
2006-10-23T07:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	did you enable admin in sudoers?
2006-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	lucaferr		I added another group..
2006-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	lucaferr		"Domain Admins"
2006-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	lucaferr		which is the group I belong to in the NIS domain
2006-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	the system doesn't know to add graphical access for your new group :)
2006-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	lucaferr	thoreauputic	ok.. I was wondering whether that could be changed.. but it's ok
2006-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	it probably can be - but it probbly isn't worth it ( too many things to track down)
2006-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	easier to add all "Domain Admin" users to the admin group and make sudoers give rights to "admin"
2006-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	lucaferr		not very practical, but ok
2006-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lucaferr	depends what rights you want them to have of course
