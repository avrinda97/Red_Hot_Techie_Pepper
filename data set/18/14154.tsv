2005-09-09T08:19:00.000Z	robertbb		Hmm.. anyone here use gaim?
2005-09-09T08:20:00.000Z	robertbb		Seems when I get messages, it doesn't flash
2005-09-09T08:20:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	no it doesn't
2005-09-09T08:20:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	Dang. :-(
2005-09-09T08:20:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	the tab text color changes to red
2005-09-09T08:21:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	Also, the buddy list won't minimise to the system tray in Ubuntu either
2005-09-09T08:21:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	yes, it works
2005-09-09T08:22:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	How do I get that to work? None of the plugins seem to do it?
2005-09-09T08:22:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	by default you have an appleet that show the gaim budy icon
2005-09-09T08:23:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	you don't need any extra plugins, by default it works
2005-09-09T08:26:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	My buddy list doesn't iconify at all
2005-09-09T08:27:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	weird... do you have that applet... I can't remember its name
2005-09-09T08:27:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	Yeah I do.. It's just called "System tray icon"
2005-09-09T08:28:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	do you want to hide your buddy list?
2005-09-09T08:28:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	Yeah, I want to be able to click the close button and for it to appear as an icon on the systray
2005-09-09T08:29:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	When I close though, the whole thing shuts down
2005-09-09T08:31:00.000Z	MarioC	robertbb	weird.... those are default settings... why don't you try rm ~/.gaim ?
2005-09-09T08:33:00.000Z	robertbb	MarioC	Will I lose all of my settings if I do rm ~/.gaim ?
