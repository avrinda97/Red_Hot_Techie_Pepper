2008-12-07T11:58:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	if I remember correctly, ninemsn audio streams are DRMed, so you can't
2008-12-07T11:58:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	I can watch on IE on XP
2008-12-07T11:58:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	I could be wrong on that, though =/
2008-12-07T11:59:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	okay. note that IE and XP are made by Microsoft and ninemsn is 50% owned by Microsoft
2008-12-07T11:59:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	so what?  is there a way to watch it?
2008-12-07T12:00:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	did you not read what I just said? No, it's DRM-encumbered.
2008-12-07T12:00:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	so how do I watch it on Ubuntu firefox..i know theres a way
2008-12-07T12:00:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	THERE ISN'T
2008-12-07T12:01:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	are u 100% sure?
2008-12-07T12:18:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	moonlight is the answer
2008-12-07T12:20:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	moonlight doesn't implement silverlight's DRM scheme, so no, it isn't, hence my repeated insistence that you can't see that video in Ubuntu.
2008-12-07T12:20:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	it does according to the sources
2008-12-07T12:21:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	somepeople on the ubuntu forums have said it works on that website
2008-12-07T12:23:00.000Z	rww	eternaljoy	you weren't kicked for asking. you were kicked for refusing to listen to anything you were told. And please don't say I'm "wrong" until you get it working. If you do, let me know and I'll be happy to eat plenty of humble pie.
2008-12-07T12:23:00.000Z	eternaljoy	rww	well im glad I didnt listen to you, because your information was wrong.  the end.
