2010-07-29T05:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	if you want raw processing check out "darktable".. they have a repo for ubuntu and is very similar to Lightroom by Adobe.. what camera do you have?
2011-02-28T08:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	you running ubuntu in a vm or something on your mac?
2011-02-28T08:47:00.000Z	mikeru	Scunizi	Natively
2011-02-28T08:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	as a dual boot?
2011-02-28T08:48:00.000Z	mikeru	Scunizi	Yip
2011-02-28T08:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	basic q's here.. did you enable the nvidia driver in system>admin>hardware drivers?
2011-02-28T08:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	remember what driver it was or simply "nvidia current"?
2011-02-28T08:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	what did you expect to happen when you enabled vsync?
2011-02-28T08:50:00.000Z	mikeru	Scunizi	No tearing
2011-02-28T08:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	ok.. you probably installed nvidia-current which is an older driver .. not "current".. there is a ppa for the latest driver.  Once the ppa is listed in your sources then update upgrade and it should pull the driver in.. it's also called nvidia-current.. the ppa is x-swat.. google it.. not sure of it's exact location.
2011-02-28T08:52:00.000Z	mikeru	Scunizi	actualky i do have a ppa
2011-02-28T08:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	mikeru	that would be it.. check the ppa though.. I think the x-swat one is pretty reliable... also check in System>Preference>Appearance and increase the effects to the middle option.
2011-02-28T08:56:00.000Z	mikeru	Scunizi	But as i already said, it was silly of me to have asked while gparted was still running on the live cd. My bad.
