2006-06-26T14:36:00.000Z	gnufied		small questio, why the heck #apt-get install msttcorefonts gives me no result...?
2006-06-26T14:36:00.000Z	gnufied		am i missing something..i have done apt-get update and all
2006-06-26T14:37:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	you have no universe repos
2006-06-26T14:37:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	so what shall i do? i mean i did "apt-get update"
2006-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	you have no universe repos - you need to install them - in synaptic go to settings repositories
2006-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	i have only command line access!!!
2006-06-26T14:39:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment universe then apt-get update again
2006-06-26T14:40:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	given your nick - you may wish to know that mulitverse = debian non free type of stuff
2006-06-26T14:42:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	its already uncommented there!!!
2006-06-26T14:42:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	then you may have a typo in trying to do the apt-get
2006-06-26T14:42:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	and yeah..i know..but i need verdana font for some charting with gnuplot
2006-06-26T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	 sudo apt-get update << then  >>sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts <<
2006-06-26T14:44:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	"Package msttcorefonts is not available, but is referred to by another package."
2006-06-26T14:44:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	 sorry you need to write multiverse after universe - my mistake misread that
2006-06-26T14:45:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	so just append multiverse at the end of both lines?
2006-06-26T14:46:00.000Z	ompaul	gnufied	yeap -
2006-06-26T14:47:00.000Z	gnufied	ompaul	thanks its working..btw i knew abt fc-cache approach...i am a old GNU/Linux user..rather FC/Redhat guy..
