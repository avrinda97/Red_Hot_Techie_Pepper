2008-10-08T06:14:00.000Z	ircbuddy		Why does my login screen not fit the screen?  it it my resolution?   Its like its zoomed in and panned over to the top left. all i see is a input field.

2008-10-08T06:16:00.000Z	ircbuddy	RonzO	ok im in the file waht do i look for
2008-10-08T06:17:00.000Z	RonzO	ircbuddy	look down toward the end of it. i would suggest to google modelines for your monitor, so it can have the correct resolution for it
2008-10-08T06:17:00.000Z	RonzO	ircbuddy	what is the native resolution for your monitor?
