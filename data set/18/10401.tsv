2007-03-24T13:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	|GaiJin|	wtf is 1200x1024. Do you mean 1280x1024?
2007-03-24T13:06:00.000Z	|GaiJin|	arrenlex	Can you see anything else wrong while you look at it... Example... the Bus line in the driver section?
2007-03-24T13:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	|GaiJin|	If it launched, nothing else is wrong.

2007-03-24T13:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	|GaiJin|	Line 477: (WW) NVIDIA(0): No valid modes for "1200x1024"; removing.
2007-03-24T13:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	|GaiJin|	:)
2007-03-24T13:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	|GaiJin|	Whenever you run into X problems, just grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log. If that doesn't help, grep WW.
2007-03-24T13:11:00.000Z	|GaiJin|	arrenlex	thanks for the tip
