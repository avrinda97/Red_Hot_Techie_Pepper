2007-04-28T08:28:00.000Z	Pelo	eRazor	 you're welcome
2007-05-22T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	eRazor	 if you can't boot the live cd you'll need to use the alternate install cd  it is text based  you can add the drivers afterwards
2007-05-22T07:29:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	It says yes for auto detection 2D and 3D for my card
2007-05-22T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	eRazor	 if you can't boot the live cd you'll need to use the alternate install cd  it is text based  you can add the drivers afterwards
2007-05-22T07:30:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	Thanks my friend has a copy of the altenate install CD. I will do it from that
2007-05-22T07:30:00.000Z	Pelo	eRazor	best of luck
2007-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	But one question. Is it possible to get the display i.e XServer if I install from the alternate CD since I you told me that I have to install the drivers later
2007-05-22T07:32:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	In the sense should I install the drivers in text mode?
2007-05-22T07:32:00.000Z	Pelo	eRazor	 I think it ,s a matter that when you are installed you get a generic driver  but when yo utry to use the live cd it can't identify your card so it just fails ,  Im not quite sure how it works
2007-05-22T07:33:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	Thank you anyhow
2007-08-03T09:32:00.000Z	Pelo	eRazor	please don'T use the enter key as punctuation , it makes it difficult to follow
2007-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	Ok
2007-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	eRazor	Pelo	I will type the entire thing
