2005-07-09T05:23:00.000Z	define		hi guys,
2005-07-09T05:23:00.000Z	define		just one question:
2005-07-09T05:23:00.000Z	define		Is the ubuntuguide.org guide trustworthy
2005-07-09T05:24:00.000Z	nalioth	define	not really
2005-07-09T05:24:00.000Z	nalioth	define	here ya go
2005-07-09T05:29:00.000Z	nalioth	define	how long have you been using the unofficial sources?
2005-07-09T05:29:00.000Z	nalioth	define	that is common when the packager doesnt provide a gpg key
2005-07-09T05:30:00.000Z	nalioth	define	but for system stability, stick with official repos
2005-07-09T05:30:00.000Z	nalioth	define	if you NEED something from backports or marillat, uncomment those lines for that program only, and then comment them back out when you've gotten it
2005-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	nalioth	define	prolonged use of unofficial repos, can cause your system to be nonupgradeable (and nondowngradeable)
2005-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	nalioth	define	seen a lot of user have to reinstall cuz of prolonged use of unofficial repos
2005-07-09T05:33:00.000Z	nalioth	define	yes, stick with the official repos for your daily updates, and what i said about proggys you just have to have
2005-07-09T05:34:00.000Z	nalioth	define	you do not need a firewall, by default ubuntu has no open ports
2005-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	nalioth	define	and no 'phone-home' software that i know of, either
2005-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	nalioth	define	no, you can have what you like, it's your puter
2005-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	nalioth	define	you might give this a read, its about firewalls http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/05/09/1846213&tid=78&tid=130
2005-07-09T05:37:00.000Z	nalioth	define	actually its about firewall frontends
2005-07-09T05:38:00.000Z	nalioth	define	nothing wrong with frontends to ease the text drudgery
