2007-08-27T11:45:00.000Z	deramin		So, I have a Corega cardbus wireless adapter, which uses the RaLink rt2500 driver (which I'm 85% sure is pre-installed). When I plug it in, the computer detects the wireless network in here, but it won't connect to it. the network in unsecured. I know the network is working. Anyone have any suggestions?
2007-08-27T11:46:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	does it show up in the network applet on your gnome desktop right corner?
2007-08-27T11:47:00.000Z	deramin	unimatrix9	the network shows up there, yes
2007-08-27T11:48:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	is it set to roaming?
2007-08-27T11:49:00.000Z	deramin	unimatrix9	I don't know. how do I find out/set it?
2007-08-27T11:49:00.000Z	deramin	unimatrix9	oh, nm found it. it is roaming
2007-08-27T11:50:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	and you also have an wired connection , and are using gnome?
2007-08-27T11:50:00.000Z	deramin	unimatrix9	wired connection works fine, though is not connected while trying the wireless (this is a different comp). I am using gnome
2007-08-27T11:52:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	there is an package that is called wifi-radar, install it if you can and try to connect using that , or
2007-08-27T11:52:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	configure your card , manual, and not use roaming...
2007-08-27T11:53:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	iconfig on terminal ( gnome desktop ) will give some info on the network
2007-08-27T11:53:00.000Z	unimatrix9		!wireless
2007-08-27T11:53:00.000Z	unimatrix9		documentation is found there!
2007-08-27T11:54:00.000Z	deramin	unimatrix9	ok, let me try this. though I believe manual configuration also failed. I'll get back to you in a moment
2007-08-27T11:54:00.000Z	unimatrix9	deramin	 , i have to go, but you can sure ask anyone here
