2009-03-25T00:16:00.000Z	jurism		Hi! I have problems with restarting apache2. It says something about unable to open logs. I am 90% sure it is php5-ffmpeg problem, but I need this extension very much. Can You tell me where should I add 'pkill -9 apache2' in /etc/init.d/apache2 so server could restart with no problems? Thank You!
2009-03-25T00:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	what was the exact error?
2009-03-25T00:18:00.000Z	jurism		(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 no listening sockets available, shutting down Unable to open logs
2009-03-25T00:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	are you running that with sudo?
2009-03-25T00:19:00.000Z	jurism		No, simply apache2 can not stop so fast and start is too fast before shut down
2009-03-25T00:19:00.000Z	jurism		first I do sudo su and use normal commands
2009-03-25T00:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	you shouldn't use sudo su.  sudo -i is safer, but generally logging in as root isn't recommended
2009-03-25T00:21:00.000Z	jurism		I use sudo su only when I need to enter many commands as root. OK, I will use sudo -i
2009-03-25T00:22:00.000Z	jurism		Server is running fine but I have this stupid thing I can not normally restart server. I need to run /etc/init.d/apache2 stop; pkill -9 apache2;/etc/init.d/apache2 start this is the only way to restart it :)
2009-03-25T00:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	something must be keeping a connection open to the server
2009-03-25T00:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	you could try editing the script to sleep for a few seconds before starting apache after starting
2009-03-25T00:29:00.000Z	jurism		I found solution to replace port 80 with port 8080 in the apache2/ports.conf but what should I do with 443 port?
2009-03-25T00:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	then the site won't be accessible by its normal port
2009-03-25T00:30:00.000Z	jurism		Yes, it is not acessible :)
2009-03-25T00:30:00.000Z	jurism		this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=329880 should be deleted :)
2009-03-25T00:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	make sure no connections are being left open.  Try shutting down apache then running sudo netstat -alp | grep apache2
2009-03-25T00:34:00.000Z	jurism	lstarnes	Your netstat prints nothing
2009-03-25T00:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	jurism	do you get the same error when starting apache2 now?
