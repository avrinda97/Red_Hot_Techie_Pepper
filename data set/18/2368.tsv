2011-07-13T05:18:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	I don't have external speakers, it's the internal ones in my laptop
2011-07-13T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	what make / model?
2011-07-13T05:20:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	Gateway MS2285
2011-07-13T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh; chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh; ./alsa-info.sh
2011-07-13T05:21:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=8d810561913ecbbad34eb79d9d1778e26c1fd620
2011-07-13T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	try adding: options snd_hda_intel model=laptop    to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf    reboot to test
2011-07-13T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	yes, put it in the file
2011-07-13T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	gateway build quality is far from good btw, you may need a bit more tweaking
2011-07-13T05:26:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	thanks let me try that
2011-07-13T05:28:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	do I add it at the end of the file?
2011-07-13T05:34:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	hi, I'm back. I added that line at the end of the file (I don't know if the location matters) and the sound is still squeaking :(
2011-07-13T05:35:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	is there any other tweaking you could think about?
2011-07-13T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	you'll need things to add to that file to make it good, i suggest you remove the added line as it isn't benefitting you
2011-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	look for your laptop model with regards to alsa-base.conf   you may find code to add like the one I gave you
2011-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	in the forums?
2011-07-13T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vivian	the web at large, even for different distros. alsa is alsa in any distro
2011-07-13T05:37:00.000Z	vivian	ActionParsnip	got it, thanks for helping :)
