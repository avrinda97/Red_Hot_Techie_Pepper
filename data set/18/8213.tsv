2007-10-19T21:13:00.000Z	TheRepacker	gharz	check your xorg.conf, something is not enabled

2007-10-19T21:16:00.000Z	gharz	TheRepacker	another question and i hope you can help me. our network has been modified for WPA-PSK TKIP... when the changed was implemented my machine became slow... when i open an apps, i normally get a 40 sec lag... apps don't open immediately.
2007-10-19T21:17:00.000Z	TheRepacker	gharz	sounds like a driver config problem, slowing down X
2007-10-19T21:18:00.000Z	gharz	TheRepacker	driver config problem? with the wireless? coz if i disable WPA-PSK TKIP everything goes back to normal... opening of apps is fast.
