2008-08-01T02:04:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		When it try to install x86 version of ubuntu 8.04 (x86 has my sound drivers, and x64 dosen't), amd64 is installed, would there be a way to force install x86 version of ubuntu?
2008-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		So i'm stuck with amd64?
2008-08-01T02:06:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		I did, it was running the generic kernel, now after i install it, i get an amd64 kernel.
2008-08-01T02:07:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		Linux titan 2.6.24-1-amd64 #1 SMP Sat may 10 09:28:10 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2008-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		So what am i going to do about my sound drivers?
2008-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		They aren't working in the x64 version, but worked fine in the x86 live cd.
2008-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		Thats what i did.
2008-08-01T02:09:00.000Z	[-Ghost-]		Does the x86 version have the x64 kernel within it?
2008-08-01T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	no
2008-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	not really
2008-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	ubuntu is not really multi-lib
2008-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	you can install x86 version of the distro
2008-08-01T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	please show me uname -a
2008-08-01T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	don't worry about that, it's just a kernel title
2008-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	install the x86 distro ?
2008-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	you've not, your still running x86_64 distro
2008-08-01T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	you need to install the x86 DISTRO, not kernel
2008-08-01T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	[-Ghost-]	it's x86 - 32bit, x64 is 64bit, they don't mix
