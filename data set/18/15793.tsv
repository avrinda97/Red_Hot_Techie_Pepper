2005-03-11T08:37:00.000Z	saphari_		is there a way to automatically open servers on x-chat?  :)
2005-03-11T08:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 "open" servers?
2005-03-11T08:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 are you looking to run an ircd?
2005-03-11T08:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 choose the network you want to connect to, and edit it, ^S
2005-03-11T08:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 yes
2005-03-11T08:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 in that same dialog where you edit the network, look for channels to join
2005-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 it says "channelS" :)
2005-03-11T08:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 see where it says connect command?
2005-03-11T08:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	saphari_	 you'll probably want to put a script in there, one you write in tcl or python
