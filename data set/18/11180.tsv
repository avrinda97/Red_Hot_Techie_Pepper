2006-10-08T11:39:00.000Z	anon32		help! what's the defragment command?
2006-10-08T11:40:00.000Z	matju	anon32	why do you need to defrag ?
2006-10-08T11:40:00.000Z	anon32	matju	because my drive is fragmented?
2006-10-08T11:40:00.000Z	matju	anon32	how do you know?
2006-10-08T11:40:00.000Z	anon32	matju	because it's over 90% full and it's rather slow
2006-10-08T11:41:00.000Z	matju	anon32	then you may try: apt-get install defrag
2006-10-08T11:41:00.000Z	anon32	matju	ok
2006-10-08T11:41:00.000Z	matju	anon32	but really, i never tried it, cause i never needed to in 10 years of linux
2006-10-08T11:42:00.000Z	anon32	matju	that's nice... oh yea, could you tell me how to open a webpage in w3m?
2006-10-08T11:42:00.000Z	matju	anon32	what's w3m ?
2006-10-08T11:42:00.000Z	anon32	matju	the text browser that's installed by default
2006-10-08T11:43:00.000Z	matju	anon32	i don't recall using a terminal-based web browser this century.
2006-10-08T11:44:00.000Z	anon32	matju	it's nice when you're in console mode
2006-10-08T11:44:00.000Z	matju	anon32	i'm not in console mode. (and i used to be a console freak too.)
2006-10-08T11:44:00.000Z	anon32	matju	defrag doesn't work on ReiserFS or ext3 :-(
2006-10-08T11:45:00.000Z	matju	anon32	that's because no-one using ext3 or reiserfs really cares about defrag
2006-10-08T11:45:00.000Z	anon32	matju	:-(
2006-10-08T11:45:00.000Z	matju	anon32	anyway fragmentation isn't nearly as much of a problem as on FAT systems, which are super bad at handling it.
