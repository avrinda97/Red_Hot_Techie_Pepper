2011-01-13T04:50:00.000Z	Steve973		How can I verify that I have NFS exports set up properly?  I cannot connect from my client machine (mac os x)
2011-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	Steve973		gnea I already did that
2011-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	can you pastebin your /etc/exports file?
2011-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	i modified my iptables rules to allow all traffic from my lan-facing interface
2011-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	nice
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	does that sound reasonable?
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	I will pastebin the exports file momentarily
2011-01-13T04:53:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	http://pastebin.com/9CLGuJwg
2011-01-13T04:56:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	is that file reasonable?
2011-01-13T04:58:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	have you tried doing it per ip instead of a whole block at a time?
2011-01-13T04:58:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	no, not yet
2011-01-13T04:59:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	okay, I'd pick an ip that's already assigned and try that
2011-01-13T04:59:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	I'm not sure if using CIDR notation is correct syntax or not
2011-01-13T05:00:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	i was able to mount it in mac os x, but when i try to ls /Volumes/backup/ it says permission denied
2011-01-13T05:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	it's possible that one or more of the flags you have set are restricting too much
2011-01-13T05:01:00.000Z	Steve973	Gnea	any recommendation on flags?
2011-01-13T05:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	that is, the flags in () after the ip
2011-01-13T05:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Steve973	not offhand, I'd pull up a manpage and see which each one does
