2007-02-01T10:14:00.000Z	CyberCod		Help people, I'm about to tear my hair out!
2007-02-01T10:14:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	Tell us about your problems
2007-02-01T10:15:00.000Z	CyberCod	Broam	I'm finishing an installation of Ubuntu Edgy on an older gateway with an integrated AC-Link Voice modem... I can't get the modem to work, and there's hardly any documentation to be had on the web, and none at all for linux
2007-02-01T10:16:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	This is going to drive you nuts, then. Happen to know the chipset in that thing?
2007-02-01T10:19:00.000Z	CyberCod	Broam	not seeing anything in there that looks like a modem, should I pastebin it?
2007-02-01T10:19:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	Sure, why not
2007-02-01T10:22:00.000Z	CyberCod	Broam	I see you're pretty busy, so when you get a sec... heres what that gave me... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/3660/
2007-02-01T10:24:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	Hmm. Looks like it only sees it as a sound card!
2007-02-01T10:24:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	also, there's this idea that your serial is UNCLAIMED.  Not sure what that means, but it's probably not...good
2007-02-01T10:25:00.000Z	CyberCod	Broam	it does have integrated sound as well... was there 2?
2007-02-01T10:26:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	it might be that the sound card IS the modem.  AC'97 is like that
2007-02-01T10:26:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	 or it may not be, they may be seperate.  Hav eyou ever cracked the case?
2007-02-01T10:28:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	never actually physically looked at the thing? That's always enlightening
2007-02-01T10:28:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	especially because it has the FCC ID printed on it
2007-02-01T10:30:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	You can search by it!
2007-02-01T10:31:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	I think google supports it, I forget.  If not the FCC.gov page has a search option
2007-02-01T10:33:00.000Z	CyberCod	Broam	thanx, I'll look at the FCC ID tomorrow, I'm about to pass out on my keyboard (again)  I gotta get some sleep
2007-02-01T10:34:00.000Z	Broam	CyberCod	good timing, my s/o has decided she needs to be paid attention to
