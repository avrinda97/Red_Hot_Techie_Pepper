2008-08-10T03:30:00.000Z	Smegzor1		I have two panels on my gnome desktop and I've been getting a lot of errors after login when the desktop is setting up saying it can't load several random things in my panels.  It asks me if I want to delete them from the panels or not.  Whats going on with that?  Is it a fault in gnome or could the apps in my panels be buggy some how?  The latest victim is firefox.
