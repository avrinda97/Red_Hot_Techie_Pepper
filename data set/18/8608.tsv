2007-12-12T19:53:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	i understand what bottle necks are.. but how do you annalyze that?
2007-12-12T19:53:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	snmp managment tools can do rrd graphs of cisco switches
2007-12-12T19:56:00.000Z	BlkGhost	teknoprep	ahh your back :)
2007-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	BlkGhost	teknoprep	yeah the snmp is what I would like to go to at one point
2007-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	then use cacti
2007-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	i would use a vmware image with it pre-setup tho.. you will have fun doing that on your own
2007-12-12T19:57:00.000Z	BlkGhost	teknoprep	just trying to narrow down what's going on right now with out going snmp
2007-12-12T19:58:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	to setup.. not to use tho
2007-12-12T19:59:00.000Z	BlkGhost	teknoprep	: Any graphical analysis software that you know of ??
2007-12-12T19:59:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	graphical ?
2007-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	BlkGhost	teknoprep	: Kinda like etherape but more detailed and options...
2007-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	BlkGhost	teknoprep	: Probley have to goto snmp for that too
2007-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	not now.. i am trying to fix another problem... let me fix my 3d redering and i will help you
2007-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	the only reason you would use snmp is if you switches and routers support it
2007-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	most managable switches support it but cisco is the best for this
2007-12-12T20:00:00.000Z	teknoprep	BlkGhost	cacti is a great program for this
