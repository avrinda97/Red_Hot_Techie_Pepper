2005-12-28T17:53:00.000Z	greg_		fresh default install   ^
2005-12-28T17:55:00.000Z	greg_		now how the crap do i start gnome ?
2005-12-28T17:56:00.000Z	greg_		yep
2005-12-28T17:57:00.000Z	greg_		no startx gdm work just fine,  but no desktop
2005-12-28T17:58:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	you don't get any messages?
2005-12-28T17:59:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	aha. hmm, and it's the first time it is trying to start gnome?
2005-12-28T06:00:00.000Z	greg_	stianh	yes
2005-12-28T06:02:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	sorry. the thing I would normally try if it was an old install gone busted was to just rm -rf all the .gnome and .gtk stuff
2005-12-28T06:03:00.000Z	greg_	stianh	that could work cause the /home was not clean.
2005-12-28T06:03:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	then you should try that
2005-12-28T06:03:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	that can easily become a problem when keeping your /home :P
2005-12-28T06:04:00.000Z	greg_	stianh	added a user with clean /home lets see
2005-12-28T06:07:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	hmm, then I would guess the network stuff would be the next way to go
2005-12-28T06:08:00.000Z	greg_	stianh	kemik what in the network.... it is a single box with dialup ?
2005-12-28T06:09:00.000Z	greg_	stianh	that wont last a reboot will it ?
2005-12-28T06:10:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	no don't think so, but just to check ;)
2005-12-28T06:18:00.000Z	stianh	greg_	no worries
