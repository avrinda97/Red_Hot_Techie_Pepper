2006-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	zezu		and you have to unmount it for it to even write the data to the thing
2006-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	zezu		but you dont have permissions to umount it
2006-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	zezu		b/c your not root and there are no superusers
2006-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	zezu		it really really defeats the entire purpose of not having a root, to have to use sudo all the damn time
2006-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	zezu		well getting it to unmount itself would be impossible unless it pops up a msg box asking you if you are done and would like to unmount that would be annoying too
2006-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	zezu		just really need to give the user permission to do normal things
2006-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	zezu		beats the whole security thing out
2006-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	zezu		i think removing root makes it less secure probably, because your standard user will need root privs to do anything
2006-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	zezu		to be a desktop OS
2006-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	zezu		linux is still very lacking in the desktop OS world ;|
