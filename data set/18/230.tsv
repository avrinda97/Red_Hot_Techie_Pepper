2012-05-30T16:44:00.000Z	__gilles		i installed ubuntu 12.04, i then installed the 'tritium' window manager
2012-05-30T16:45:00.000Z	__gilles		however i don't see a way to select it on gdm
2012-05-30T16:45:00.000Z	__gilles		how do you change the window manager for a specific user
2012-05-30T16:46:00.000Z	__gilles		ok thanks !
2012-05-30T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	__gilles	or just have the user choose the window manager he wants at the login screen
2012-05-30T16:46:00.000Z	__gilles	jrib	that's what i wanted
2012-05-30T16:46:00.000Z	__gilles		but it does not appear in the list after being installed from packages
2012-05-30T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	__gilles	what window manager?
2012-05-30T16:47:00.000Z	__gilles		i'll try the .desktop way and see how it goes
2012-05-30T16:47:00.000Z	__gilles	jrib	tritum
2012-05-30T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	__gilles	I see no tritum package
2012-05-30T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	__gilles	i'm guessing you mean "tritium".  The package itself has a .desktop file.  Did you check if it got placed somewhere?
2012-05-30T16:50:00.000Z	__gilles		jre

2012-05-30T16:50:00.000Z	__gilles	jrib	dunno, but i wrote a .desktop file and it works
2012-05-30T16:50:00.000Z	__gilles		thanks !
2012-05-30T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	__gilles	you should file a bug if the package isn't properly installing one
