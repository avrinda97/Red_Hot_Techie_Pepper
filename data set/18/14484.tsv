2005-09-02T14:22:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	search this page http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=All#matrix for your device
2005-09-02T14:30:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	the headset is a 'soundcard' so yes
2005-09-02T14:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	you may need to search for the maker of the chip, not your particular device
2005-09-02T14:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	that is your other soundcard, so no. your USB headset is actually a completely separate sound device
2005-09-02T14:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	that is normal for most hardware ;)
2005-09-02T14:35:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	go to system > administration > device manager and find the headset (it will be under the USB hub and stuff in the tree)
2005-09-02T14:37:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	did you find your USB  controller?
2005-09-02T14:44:00.000Z	funkyHat	zeus1_	yea, sorry, try unplugging the headset and plugging it in while the device manager is still running
