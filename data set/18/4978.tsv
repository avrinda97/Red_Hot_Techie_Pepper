2010-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	gbally		chrome .deb file downloaded by firefox
2010-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	did you look in firefox preference>genererl>download
2010-08-16T05:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	after you changed you firefox download directory you downloaded the file you wanted again?
2010-08-16T05:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	maybe we should take a look at what you have set your download directory to by going to firefox >edit>preferences>general  and hit the keys alt print-screen-request
2010-08-16T05:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	then send us that image so we can see where you are saving your files
2010-08-16T05:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	I thought you already found the file so I guess we don't need it?  or are we still looking for it?  I thought you found it in /tmp
2010-08-16T05:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	I didn't want the desktop I wanted a shot of firefox on the preferences page but I think you got it already fixed up
2010-08-16T06:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	well you you want to share it with us idleone has showed you the place to go to send it http://tinyurl.com/imagebin
2010-08-16T06:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	we no longer need it you found the file.
2010-08-16T06:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	just open it with nautilus
2010-08-16T06:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	I'm not sure about why you can't use desktop but I would set the download path to /home/gbally/download   gbally=you_unix_account_name  the name you see in the top right of your screen
2010-08-16T06:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	logout and into the user of choice would be my pick
2010-08-16T06:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	gbally	system>administration>user groups  create a new user and hit all the boxes
