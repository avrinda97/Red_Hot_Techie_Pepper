2009-01-25T00:21:00.000Z	jacik		How can I control remote desktop via NAT. Is there any easy solution?
2009-01-25T00:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	via NAT?  you try to use x11vnc or vncviewer ?
2009-01-25T00:39:00.000Z	jacik	n8tuser	I am looking for simple solution, I tried vnc and it worked, but only when both computers were on the same local network. But I need to configure computer behind mobile operator NAT. I would appreciate some hint how to solve that issue.
2009-01-25T00:40:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	-> look into using FreeNx as a client, fast and can work with secured network.. google please
2009-01-25T01:09:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	-> can you elaborate on your network layout again please? ping which host from where? what is their respective ip addresses?
2009-01-25T01:12:00.000Z	jacik	n8tuser	first pc is behind NAT of one internet provider and second pc is behind NAT of second internet provider. Both computers doesn't have public IP. I need to make a connection between them, but they can't see each other.
2009-01-25T01:14:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	-> those routers fronting the hosts has to be able to port forward packets to your host, look at the config settins of those routers perhaps its called DMZ
2009-01-25T01:14:00.000Z	jacik	n8tuser	when both computers were on the same local network I could connect them and vnc worked fine.
2009-01-25T01:15:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	->  i know, but since they are behind a router (masqueraded) now -- it requires the router to port forward the packets to those host behind them
2009-01-25T01:15:00.000Z	jacik	n8tuser	I can't configure my internet provider routers. I am looking for something like hamachi under XP, but not for gaming.
2009-01-25T01:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	->  there are plenty of tutorials you can find via google on how to do this
2009-01-25T01:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	-> oh.. you dont have access to the configuration of those routers?  what ip address is given to your hosts? both ends?
2009-01-25T01:17:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	->  if you wish you can private message those to me
2009-01-25T01:17:00.000Z	jacik	n8tuser	both ip address are dynamic
2009-01-25T01:18:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	-> what are they? provide them to me in private
2009-01-25T01:18:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	are they the routable type or not?
2009-01-25T01:19:00.000Z	jacik	n8tuser	what does it mean routable type?
2009-01-25T01:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	jacik	->  can you provide the ip address ? ill tell you if they are or not
