2010-05-13T18:58:00.000Z	AmberJ	a5h15h	Yes. geany is pretty easy to use.
2010-05-13T18:58:00.000Z	AmberJ	a5h15h	just make sure you have geany, gcc, g++ (install using apt) and all will be as easy as point and click, imo
2010-05-13T18:59:00.000Z	AmberJ	a5h15h	what compiler are you going to use?
2010-05-13T18:59:00.000Z	a5h15h	AmberJ	cant i use software center to install?
2010-05-13T19:00:00.000Z	AmberJ	a5h15h	yes. you can use it too.
2010-05-13T19:00:00.000Z	a5h15h	AmberJ	is there any way to check if g++ is installed?
2010-05-13T19:01:00.000Z	AmberJ	a5h15h	^^
2010-05-13T19:01:00.000Z	a5h15h	AmberJ	its installed
2010-05-13T19:02:00.000Z	AmberJ	a5h15h	install geany and there you go. There's also #geany on freenode if you want more help
