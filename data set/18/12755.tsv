2006-09-24T13:45:00.000Z	thenetduck		can somone help me 3d accelerate my ATI 9600 Graphic card???
2006-09-24T13:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	see the URL above ^^^ I've got a 9600XT, it runs nicely
2006-09-24T13:47:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	thanks
2006-09-24T13:49:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	: I have all ready optimized my graphics card so its not so choppy on my computer (used the fglrx driver) does that mean my card is 3d accelerated???
2006-09-24T13:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	if you're running the fglrx drivers, then yes, it is
2006-09-24T13:50:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	well how about that, I had it all ready done and didn't know it. They shouldn't give it such a fancy name (sounds scarry)
2006-09-26T12:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	some apps don't have menu entries
2006-09-26T12:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	for gui apps that don't have them, sure. Some apps are designed to run only in terminal, though.
2006-09-26T12:15:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	is there a way to get a program like Dia to get displayed??
2006-09-26T12:15:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	because thats the one and its a GUI app...
2006-09-26T12:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	yes - I'm surprised it's not, actually.
2006-09-26T12:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	Applications->Accessories->Alacarte Menu Editor
2006-09-26T12:16:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	ok
2006-09-26T12:16:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	is that the same as right clicking "edit menu" ?
2006-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	yeah, it is
2006-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	just put 'dia' in the command box
2006-09-26T12:18:00.000Z	thenetduck	Madpilot	.. ok I guess that would be the easiest solution?
2006-09-26T12:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	thenetduck	it is - but check bugs.ubuntu.com too, see if anyone's filed a 'dia doesn't have a menu entry' bug yet
