2008-10-26T15:17:00.000Z	marcel	Pelo	i have do that, i will copy you the message okay?
2008-10-26T15:17:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	ok
2008-10-26T15:20:00.000Z	marcel	Pelo	root@workstation-mar:/media/dban-1.0.7# ls -la
2008-10-26T15:21:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	you don'T realy want to delete .Trash folders , they are part of the filesystem on ext3 and the like
2008-10-26T15:22:00.000Z	marcel	Pelo	but i have not enough space
2008-10-26T15:22:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	empty the trash folder then
2008-10-26T15:22:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	empty folders don'T realy takeup any space
2008-10-26T15:26:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	you need to emtpy the trash bin,   open the usb drive in nautilus and look in the file menu for empty trash
2008-10-26T15:26:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	I don'T allow private msg, please talk to me in the channel
2008-10-26T15:27:00.000Z	marcel	Pelo	the problem is i have 2GB space on my usb-stick. and if i delete things they are not realy deleted.
2008-10-26T15:28:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	if stuff ends up in your .Trash-0001 , folder they are not realy deleted, they are moved to trash,  you need to empty the trash can .   look in the file manager windows , in the file menu, for "empty trash" or something similar
2008-10-26T15:29:00.000Z	Pelo	marcel	if that doesn't work ,  just sudo rm the files , not the trash folder
2008-10-26T15:30:00.000Z	marcel	Pelo	okay thanks
