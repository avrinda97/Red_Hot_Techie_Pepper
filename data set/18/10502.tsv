2006-11-27T09:20:00.000Z	GionnyBoss		hi all :)
2006-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	GionnyBoss		can anybody help me letting my Canon scanner work under Ubuntu 6.10, please? xsane seems not to recognise it (and I read that unfortunately Canon scanner are not officially supported under Linux) ... does anybody have the same problem and solved it?
2006-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	soundray	GionnyBoss	you should look up the latest news about your scanner on the sane website
2006-11-27T09:23:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	ok, I go and check on SANE website now
2006-11-27T09:25:00.000Z	soundray	GionnyBoss	if it needs convincing, it'll be tough. People have to discover it for themselves.
2006-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	that's true! but I guess that he is discovering it by itself, he tryed to use Ubuntu on my computer and he found it fast, simple... he just doesn't care very much about it... he just needs that things work... but you know, I'm trying to tell him that if things works well with both for him, why shouldn't he use and support Linux and the good philosophy that there is behind it?
2006-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	sorry for my awful english (I'm italian)
2006-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	soundray	GionnyBoss	your English is fine (by my German standards)
2006-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	are you German? I'm going to Berlin for 2 months... leaving wednesday :P
2006-11-27T09:30:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	but my German is awful, I can say "ich spreche kein deutsch" and nothing more :P my girlfriend is from Berlin... but we speak only italian... ok sorry for the parenthesis :P

2006-11-27T09:31:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	I didn't found that model... those Vendor ID and Product ID are the one that I can see with 'sane-find-scanners' command?
2006-11-27T09:31:00.000Z	soundray	GionnyBoss	no, 'lsusb'
2006-11-27T09:32:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	ok thanks, I will try that

2007-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	soundray	how can you kill zombies process? I had a firefox-bin zombie process yesterday and I couldn't kill it
2007-03-28T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	GionnyBoss	I'm not sure actually. I'm not one of those reboot haters, so I just reboot.
