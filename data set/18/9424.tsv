2009-07-01T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2009-07-01T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	Ah.  #ubuntu+1 for Karmic support.  That looks like some sort of packaging error
2009-07-01T08:23:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	im in there too
2009-07-01T08:24:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	That's the correct channel for development version support, this channel is not appropriate for development support.
2009-07-05T15:40:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	ya i know about that one.
2009-07-05T15:40:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	Others? Adept is GUI for KDE, apt-get, aptitude
2009-07-05T15:41:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	whats the diff between aptitude and dpkg?
2009-07-05T15:41:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	in plain english
2009-07-05T15:42:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	dpkg does actual deb managing, apt provides the repository stuff.  apt uses dpkg to do the installations (apt meaning the library, which aptitude, adept, synaptic, apt-get, etc use)
2009-07-05T15:43:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	ty so basically dpkg does the debian part and apt, aptitude does the normal ubuntu installs.
2009-07-05T15:43:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	er, no.  apt gets the package files from the internet, dpkg installs them
2009-07-05T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	apt-get feeds packages to dpkg, you cannot use apt-get without dpkg
2009-07-05T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	Yes, if you download packages manually (like through wget, or whatever)
2009-07-07T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	Ghoti: no, final is in the repos.
2009-07-08T10:59:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	bazhang , why didnt you tell him to just got to the systems settings and change it there...
2009-08-10T01:29:00.000Z	oldude67	Flannel	you forgot to tell him to hit send on paste and then get the url.
2009-08-10T01:29:00.000Z	Flannel	oldude67	It's "Paste!" not send, and I did tell him
