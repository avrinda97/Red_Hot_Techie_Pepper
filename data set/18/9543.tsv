2007-05-06T10:07:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I've never had GRUB fail to boot anything.
2007-05-06T10:07:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I dunno, I've never used LILO. :)
2007-05-06T10:07:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Never had a reason to.
2007-05-06T10:07:00.000Z	SeveredCross		GRUB should be able to boot Darwin.
2007-05-06T10:07:00.000Z	SeveredCross		If not, the Darwin bootloader can boot Ubuntu.
2007-05-06T10:08:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Does it work fine plugged into another system?
2007-05-06T10:08:00.000Z	SeveredCross		MP3 isn't installed automatically...
2007-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	SeveredCross		You need GStreamer plugins.
2007-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	SeveredCross		voidimage: Only if you use Amarok.
2007-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Err
2007-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	poje	SeveredCross	really? no third party tools?
2007-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	SeveredCross	poje	For...?
2007-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	poje	SeveredCross	loading bin/cues
2007-05-06T10:10:00.000Z	poje	SeveredCross	I would have figured there to be a *nix copy of daemon tools
2007-05-06T10:10:00.000Z	SeveredCross	poje	I've never seen one.
2007-05-06T11:11:00.000Z	poje	SeveredCross	old win98 boot disks :D
2007-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	poje	SeveredCross	I've foobarred a couple *nix installs and wanted to bail back to windows for a breather, and that helps a lot (or to get rid of grub)
2007-05-06T11:13:00.000Z	SeveredCross	poje	I suppose.
