2008-03-09T15:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	what do you need it to do?.. manage an ipod or somnething?
2008-03-09T15:01:00.000Z	aLeSD	IndyGunFreak	yes
2008-03-09T15:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	exaile doesn't *excel* :), at managing an ipod in my opinion
2008-03-09T15:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	have you looked at GTKpod?
2008-03-09T15:01:00.000Z	aLeSD	IndyGunFreak	I will
2008-03-09T15:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	just personal opinion of course, but GTKPod is probably the best Ipod manager for ubuntu.. I like it. easy to use.
2008-03-09T15:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	have you tried Banshee?
2008-03-09T15:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	hmm, not sureon that one, will probably require two separate apps
2008-03-09T15:09:00.000Z	aLeSD	IndyGunFreak	ok thanks ... and only for the photos?
2008-03-09T15:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	eh, i like f-spot..lol

2008-03-09T15:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aLeSD	i forgot about digikam, its pretty good, but you'll have to install a ton of KDE libs if you don't have them already
2008-03-09T15:20:00.000Z	aLeSD	IndyGunFreak	  :)
