2010-07-30T09:23:00.000Z	saegeoff		i use my bluetooth mouse with ubuntu. it is wireless
2010-07-30T09:23:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	I have a D-Link usb wireless device for the internet--can that work with Ubuntu
2010-07-30T09:24:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	I did that--but it does not recognize the device--nothing really happens when I plug it al in
2010-07-30T09:25:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	what is the exact model you have?
2010-07-30T09:25:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	d-link wua-2340
2010-07-30T09:27:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	i am looking.
2010-07-30T09:27:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	Thanks
2010-07-30T09:29:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	have you read this yet? http://georgia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=861855&page=2  it may take you some messing around but I think you should be able to get it working
2010-07-30T09:31:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	So I need ndiswrapper. Inoticed the posting is 2008--is that stuff still aplicalble?
2010-07-30T09:33:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	I am not sure.  I would have to be doing it myself to figure it out.  There were some changes made to the USB aspect of ubuntu since then.  Just give it a try and see if it works.  Write down everything you do so you can go back if necessary
2010-07-30T09:33:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	also if you get it working, then you can make a post in the Ubuntu forms to contribute what you figured out
2010-07-30T09:34:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	I am not that clever with Linux yet, but who knows. Thanks for trying. ; - )
2010-07-30T09:36:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	you'll catch on quickly.  Linux is fun
2010-07-30T09:37:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	After trying Ubuntu, Slackware, Gentoo (desktop) and retruning to Xubuntu for laptop--among other distros--and many swears later...it is also quite maddening
2010-07-30T09:39:00.000Z	saegeoff	khider	hardware support is getting much better in the newer versions
2010-07-30T09:40:00.000Z	khider	saegeoff	I agree, I bought an old used laptop because I trashed by new one. Things worked better on thye enw than the old
