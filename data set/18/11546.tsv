2006-08-11T08:32:00.000Z	Sakireth		Seriously guys, isn't that possible? All the other distro's (Gentoo, Arch Linux, Debian, others) do that just fine. If that isn't possible inside Ubuntu, then it should be fixed, since this is a missing part of Linux
2006-08-11T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	if you want all dev packages to compile everything then you just install all the dev packages in all of the repositories :)  However, you may be more interested in first installing build-essential and then doing 'apt-get build-dep package_name' to get the needed deps for a package
2006-08-11T08:34:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	The problem is, when a package is not in the repository, deps can't be calculated - so compiling something without a package, would not be possible...
2006-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	how do you do it in debian?
2006-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	./configure, make, make install
2006-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	I mean, how do you install the dependencies?
2006-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	whaddaya mean?
2006-08-11T08:36:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	Anyways, installing all the libs doesn't fill up your hard drive, righty?
2006-08-11T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	depends on the size of your hard drive, I have no idea how much all of them would take up.  The README files usually list the dependencies needed
2006-08-11T08:38:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	I don't mean the dependecies but the libs. you know, when you install a KDE app on a non-ubuntu distro you compile it. on ubuntu that isn't possible. i mean how to get that to work?
2006-08-11T08:40:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	it's the same as any other distro.  Install build-essential to get the basic stuff, install the dependencies you need, ./configure, make, make install.
2006-08-11T08:43:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	you can take a look at auto-apt for what you want but I never had any luck.  Really, you should stick to the repos unless you really need to compile a few apps, and then once you get their dependencies installed you never have to worry about it again
2006-08-11T08:44:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	weird that it is so difficult in ubuntu while in almost every other distro you can just make install and let it do the rest, you just sit back and relax.
2006-08-11T08:45:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	that is probably because you already have the dependencies you need installed
2006-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	yes and now is my question, how to get the same on ubuntu? install all -dev packages? HOW?
2006-08-11T08:47:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	I wasn't really serious, but you would do: sudo apt-get install '.*-dev'
2006-08-11T08:48:00.000Z	Sakireth	jrib	Oh. but if Ubuntu doesn't support it, that means Ubuntu doesn't have all features Linux has, which means Ubuntu isn't linux-compatible so well
2006-08-11T08:48:00.000Z	jrib	Sakireth	what do you mean by "it"?
