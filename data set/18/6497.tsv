2008-06-22T02:32:00.000Z	bluefoxx	xbj9000	no, its not there
2008-06-22T02:35:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	hang on I'll find the name of the driver
2008-06-22T02:35:00.000Z	bluefoxx	xbj9000	ty
2008-06-22T02:40:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	I was just going to tell you to install xorg-driver-fglrx    :p
2008-06-22T02:40:00.000Z	bluefoxx	xbj9000	ah, well thanks everyone :)
2008-06-22T02:40:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	did you try that?
2008-06-22T02:41:00.000Z	bluefoxx	xbj9000	its downloading now...im on dialup
2008-06-22T02:43:00.000Z	bluefoxx	xbj9000	no, restricted-extras is indeed installed
2008-06-22T11:07:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	are your keys normal outside of terminal?
2008-06-22T11:08:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	you can't login to a desktop environment?
2008-06-22T11:09:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	it may be the setting in /etc/fstab for keyboard, it should be pc104 (assuming you are in the US)
2008-06-22T11:10:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	I said /etc/fstab lol I meant /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-06-22T11:12:00.000Z	xbj9000	bluefoxx	/etc/X11/xorg.conf is also probably where you'll fix your graphics, and probably whatever happened to change the keyboard type is also what broke the driver
