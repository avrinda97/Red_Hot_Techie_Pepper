2007-08-05T12:47:00.000Z	MadFaxer		hello all
2007-08-05T12:47:00.000Z	MadFaxer		im a n00b, ive been trying to install a package manually, and i just can't seem to get it to work.
2007-08-05T12:48:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	just stick with the Synaptic package manager until you feel more comfortable with the OS
2007-08-05T12:55:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	you should consider the possibility you need more than a couple weeks experience with linux before you're ready to compile your own packages
2007-08-05T12:57:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	frankly, if you're ready to out-smart Ubuntu with your own package management, then you're probably ready to look at another distribution that is more flexible to that sort of work.  Check out Gentoo - you will learn a great deal and it is a very solid distro
2007-08-05T12:57:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	In all seriousness, if your intention is to learn Linux, then Gentoo is the best distro for that purpose.
2007-08-05T12:58:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	Ubuntu is built in ways to shield you from learning linux.  And that's not a bad thing.
2007-08-05T13:07:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	Indeed - rocking the house it does
2007-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	Be sure to burn some extra copies of the liveCD so your friends can try it out, too
2007-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	and recommend the Dell/Ubuntu systems to people considering a Vista upgrade
2007-08-05T13:09:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	if you can get people to buy the computer from Dell with linux on it - then they don't have to come here to #linux for their support
2007-08-05T13:09:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	no
2007-08-05T13:11:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	it will save them some money - talk with a technology consultant in your area about coming in and having a talk with management
2007-08-05T13:12:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	I could use the business, for example.  *grin*
2007-08-05T13:14:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	yeah, a tech consultant will be able to port those
2007-08-05T13:14:00.000Z	MadFaxer	desertc	awesomeness.
2007-08-05T13:16:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	wait until you see Ubuntu Studio
2007-08-05T14:39:00.000Z	desertc	MadFaxer	ubuntu is not a distro you want to be installing programs... I thought we already discussed this...
