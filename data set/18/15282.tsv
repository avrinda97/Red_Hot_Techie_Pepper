2006-05-02T09:02:00.000Z	muep	casper	what are you trying to do?
2006-05-02T09:05:00.000Z	muep	casper	don't install that one
2006-05-02T09:05:00.000Z	muep	casper	did you get it from some ati or nvidia site?
2006-05-02T09:06:00.000Z	muep	casper	is your problem your low resolution?
2006-05-02T09:06:00.000Z	muep	casper	the problem isn't your video card driver, probably
2006-05-02T09:07:00.000Z	muep	casper	I guess your display isn't recognized right
2006-05-02T09:08:00.000Z	muep	casper	yes, but it doesn't give you other resolutions because of the wrong settings
2006-05-02T09:11:00.000Z	muep	casper	tried terminal?
2006-05-02T09:14:00.000Z	muep	casper	what are you doing?
2006-05-02T09:15:00.000Z	muep	casper	you only would have needed to edit a file a bit
2006-05-02T09:15:00.000Z	muep	casper	what text?
2006-05-02T09:16:00.000Z	muep	casper	what options do you have?
2006-05-02T09:17:00.000Z	muep	casper	open another terminal and use lspci
