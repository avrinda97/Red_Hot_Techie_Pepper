2008-08-21T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	What file are you trying to edit specifically?
2008-08-21T11:38:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	script file /usr/bin/compiz
2008-08-21T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	"gksudo gedit /usr/bin/compiz" ( If you are unblacklisting your card remember not to make a bug report if there are any compiz problems, you are warned :)
2008-08-21T11:40:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	OK tks.
2008-08-21T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	np :)
2008-08-21T11:45:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	Tks that worked, but the change of video to VIA didnt. Pity :-(
2008-08-27T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	Is it an integrated GPU ( with shared memory ) ?
2008-08-27T11:55:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	yes
2008-08-27T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	Try running memtest and confirm that the RAM is probably bad
2008-08-27T11:56:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	sorry, should have mentioned already did that
2008-08-27T11:57:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	how do I tell it to use Safe Video mode from the grub screen do you know?
2008-08-27T11:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	You can change your xorg.conf from the LiveCD to use the "vesa" driver
2008-08-27T11:59:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	do you suggest boot the livecd then go to /etc/x11 on the partition and edit it??
2008-08-27T12:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	Yes
2008-08-27T12:00:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	gksudo getdit /etc/x11 xorg.conf  ????
2008-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	alistair_	 You will need to mount your linux partition and edit /media/<whatever>/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-08-27T12:02:00.000Z	alistair_	Jordan_U	tks I get the picture anyway I'll be back in 15 mins if u still around to advise. I did try to set it from grub screen eg vga=874 but that was no good
