2006-06-03T16:31:00.000Z	teclo		I there, just did apt-get dist-upgrade from breezy to dapper... I have no sound anymore... any idea ?
2006-06-03T05:13:00.000Z	teclo		Hello, since my upgrade from Breezy to Dapper I have no more sound. Perhaps is it because of the new kernel ? Do I need to add some alsa modules ? If I do lsmod | grep -i alsa I get nothing... any idea ?
2006-06-03T05:14:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	grep for snd
2006-06-03T05:14:00.000Z	teclo	djm62	thank you. lsmod | grep -i snd does give me a list of modules
2006-06-03T05:15:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	then try alsamixer
2006-06-03T05:15:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	and see if anything is inadvertently muted
2006-06-03T05:16:00.000Z	teclo	djm62	In alsamixer, nothing seems muted
2006-06-03T05:17:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	now this is where it becomes a black art: do you have more than one sound card, and can you confirm which soundcard it is attempting to blay through
2006-06-03T05:18:00.000Z	teclo	djm62	I have only one soundcard, an Intel i810/ac97 on the motherboard
2006-06-03T05:18:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	do you have a software modem that could be mistook for a soundcard?
2006-06-03T05:18:00.000Z	teclo	djm62	no modem at all, only a NIC
2006-06-03T05:20:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	what happens when you try to play a sound? do you get an error? do any apps work?
2006-06-03T05:20:00.000Z	teclo	djm62	everything works, but I hear no sound
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	... have you plugged in speakers/earphones and switched on as appropriate? (I have to ask)
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	teclo		ah, I have found !
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	teclo		It was the PCM which was at zero
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	teclo	djm62	problem solved
2006-06-03T05:22:00.000Z	djm62	teclo	what was it? share the wealth for whoever searches these archives!
