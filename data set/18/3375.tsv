2009-10-18T14:29:00.000Z	StockBrian		Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -PN
2009-10-18T14:29:00.000Z	StockBrian		Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 2.35 seconds
2009-10-18T14:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	you don't need nmap to test a 1 port service, just telnet to the vnc  port nr
2009-10-18T14:31:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	and btw, you did try to ping the host first, right ?
2009-10-18T14:32:00.000Z	StockBrian	joaopinto	You lost me. Come again?
2009-10-18T14:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	did you checked connectivity between the vnc client and server with a "ping host" ?
2009-10-18T14:33:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	but it fails with the stock vnc from the same system ?
2009-10-18T14:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	telnet vnc_server_ip 5900
2009-10-18T14:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	with telnet you can check connectivity to a specific port
2009-10-18T14:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	5900's is VNCs default port nr
2009-10-18T14:36:00.000Z	StockBrian	joaopinto	AH.. ok I just caught up. I was typing the nmap command wrong. NMAP reports 5900/tcp poen vnc
2009-10-18T14:39:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	so it's not a network issue
2009-10-18T14:39:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	what error do you get ?
2009-10-18T14:41:00.000Z	StockBrian	joaopinto	Whoa..  now it works.. the only change was installing nmap....  weird or understandable?
2009-10-18T14:41:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	it is not related to nmap in anyway
2009-10-18T14:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	StockBrian	something else changed
2009-10-18T14:42:00.000Z	StockBrian	joaopinto	Thanks for the attention.
2009-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	StockBrian	joaopinto	the only error was "failed to connect to server" from XP to Linux, and "5900 is closed" from Linux to XP. However, both directions work now.
