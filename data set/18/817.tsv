2011-08-28T20:41:00.000Z	utkarsh_		Hello, I have installled Ubuntu 11.04 Gnome. I am trying to Setup Bluetooth. But I have been unable to. I have tried both : Service Bluetooth Restart and killall bluetoothd, bluetoothd... I tried and searched internet for other methods but have not been able to find one. Can anybody please suggest some other workaround.
2011-08-28T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	if you run:  bluetooth-applet    is it ok?
2011-08-28T20:43:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	I have tried bluetooth-applet....
2011-08-28T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	if you run:  dmesg | grep -i blu     does it show a bluetooth adapter being picked up?
2011-08-28T20:45:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	I have tried it once... I showed bluetooth adapter. Next time when it was not working... I did not see that...using the same command
2011-08-28T20:47:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	Is there a way to turn on the bluetooth directly from the BIOS. As the Bug Report page sayed that the bluetooth works out of the box if it is already on.....
2011-08-28T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	depends on the BIOS, go have a look :)
2011-08-28T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	is there a switch on the keyboard or otherwise to turn bluetooth off and on?
2011-08-28T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	if you run:   lsmod | grep btusb     do you get any output?
2011-08-28T20:48:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	Yes there is. For Wireless and Bluetooth. I have tried that as well. It does not work...
2011-08-28T20:49:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	I am currently using Windows. I use bluetooth to use internet. So I would have to bboot into ubuntu and run and see. I have not run that commmand
2011-08-28T20:50:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	So I would note downn the Commmand. I would shut down and boot into Ubuntu run and come back here and tell you the output.... Can you suggest me what to do in both the cases of failure and success?
2011-08-28T20:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	i suggest you use another connection to get updated, may help
2011-08-28T20:51:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	Ok.. So you are suggesting me to use another source for internet and come online here again...Right?
2011-08-28T20:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	yes an ethernet connection will probably just work, then you can get updated
2011-08-28T20:53:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	I did update ubuntu from the Update Manager when I had the ethernet. Is there another source for Bluetooth module?
2011-08-28T20:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	utkarsh_	its part of the kernel stuffs, you may find you just need the bluetooth module loading
2011-08-28T20:57:00.000Z	utkarsh_	ActionParsnip	Ok... I would do that... Thanks for the time you gace... Thank you..
