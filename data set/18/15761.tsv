2005-10-30T15:32:00.000Z	tom__		Sys_Error: SDL_SetVideoMode failed: Couldn't find matching GLX visual what does this mean and how can i fix it?
2005-10-30T15:33:00.000Z	tom__		trying to run quake4
2005-10-30T15:33:00.000Z	tom__		im installing the different sdl packages but i don't really know what im doing
2005-10-30T15:34:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	try installing libsdl1.2debian-alsa
2005-10-30T15:36:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	no, is it still crashing?
2005-10-30T15:36:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	well, is your 3D card set up properly?
2005-10-30T15:37:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	is it an ATi or Nvidia?
2005-10-30T15:38:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	I think this should solve it..."sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`" - you'll need to reboot after doing that
2005-10-30T15:41:00.000Z	tom__	fraggsta	how do i execute that command when i press enter it just drops down a line
2005-10-30T15:41:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	copy and paste it, it works fine here
2005-10-30T15:42:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	yes, tehre shouldn't be any " characters in it :)
2005-10-30T15:43:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	should just be sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
2005-10-30T15:46:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	there should be a page in the Ubuntu guide somewhere on what to do once the driver is installed, I just can't find it..
2005-10-30T15:46:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2005-10-30T15:47:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	only where it says /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 you should use /etc/X11/xorg.conf instead
2005-10-30T15:48:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	well breezy uses X.Org, and I can't see anything in there that would be different in Breezy
2005-10-30T15:57:00.000Z	tom__	fraggsta	so im just changing the driver "ati" part to fglrx?
2005-10-30T15:57:00.000Z	fraggsta	tom__	yup
