2007-03-25T13:40:00.000Z	brophat		how much hard drive space does an ubuntu install take up?
2007-03-25T13:42:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	you should give it about 2GB as a minimum.
2007-03-25T13:43:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	that would be for the os and the user space?
2007-03-25T13:43:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	if your space is tight, you can make a smaller (nonstandard) install by booting the alternate CD and choosing the server option
2007-03-25T13:43:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	that would just be for the OS and the standard Ubuntu software that comes with it.
2007-03-25T13:43:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	they you should have some more room for userspace
2007-03-25T13:45:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	if you consider user data, there is of course never enough
2007-03-25T13:45:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	space, I mean
2007-03-25T13:46:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	so 2 gigs is what the install takes up. So if you make a partition less than 2 gigs then the install will fail.
2007-03-25T13:48:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	not necessarily. So far, all base installations I've seen were under 2GB. But it varies a bit from version to version and machine to machine.
2007-03-25T13:49:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	does the 2gig include the swap?
2007-03-25T13:49:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	no
2007-03-25T13:50:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	so then we need 2gigs + 500 megs
2007-03-25T13:52:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	I can really just give you ballpark figures. If you told me what kind of machine you have and what you are planning to use it for, I could give you more specific advice.
2007-03-25T13:54:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	how does one do a smaller install?
2007-03-25T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	(repeat) if your space is tight, you can make a smaller (nonstandard) install by booting the alternate CD and choosing the server option
2007-03-25T13:56:00.000Z	brophat	soundray	you mean install with the server ubuntu CD ?
2007-03-25T13:56:00.000Z	soundray	brophat	that would be another way, but I meant what I said. The alternate CD has a server option which does essentially the same as the server CD.
