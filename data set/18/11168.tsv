2006-09-08T10:46:00.000Z	holycow		i haven't burned anything in about 2 years
2006-09-08T10:46:00.000Z	holycow		flash drives are so large now that its a dead technology effectively
2006-09-08T10:47:00.000Z	holycow		to each his own ... but i disagree.  its a dead technology, i cannot see a single reason to use cds for anything at all
2006-09-08T10:48:00.000Z	holycow		i don't archive anything to cd
2006-09-08T10:48:00.000Z	holycow		i just buy hd's and archive to that
2006-09-08T10:48:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	holycow	in my opinion cds/dvds/optical media last longer than hard drives
2006-09-08T10:50:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	hard drive failure with hd prices today is a non issue.  software raid and you are done.
2006-09-08T11:17:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	its only a 4gb limit on windows
2006-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	well it doesn't your incorrectly categorizing di
2006-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	you want a desktop, debian lets you select desktop environment, server etc.
2006-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	its really not that difficult
2006-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	what debian doesn't do is add all the spit and polish
2006-09-08T12:12:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	at one time i thought i could do what ubuntu has done ... polsih up debian desktop experience with a coupla part time coders
2006-09-08T12:14:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	holycow	i understand the concept of a server os...isn't centos that at it's core? but debian's install procedure is enough to put off anybody
2006-09-08T12:14:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	thats just wrong on so many levels
2006-09-08T12:15:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	i taught a class of people on how to build their own cheap boxen
2006-09-08T12:15:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	holycow	correct me then...i'm curious
2006-09-08T12:15:00.000Z	holycow	Gevaudan82	then install debian using di (sarg)
