2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	Mikey	lupine_85	i cant find nmap, but i dont know if it will help me at all, i cant connect to my router with WPA, ive been through the HowTo
2007-01-09T15:51:00.000Z	lupine_85	Mikey	what you have there is a passphrase, not a key
2007-01-09T15:52:00.000Z	Mikey	lupine_85	ok we are getting someware, which one do i need to specify in the iwconfig? the pass phrase ("myweppass") or this wep key??
2007-01-09T15:52:00.000Z	lupine_85	Mikey	the key
2007-01-09T15:53:00.000Z	Mikey	lupine_85	ok, how do i make this key???? at least point me to a website
2007-01-09T15:54:00.000Z	lupine_85	Mikey	I'm not really sure, sorry. My router displays the ey just below the passphrase
2007-01-09T15:56:00.000Z	Mikey	lupine_85	the pass phrase is set in the router, and on any other wireless computer, are you sure i cant just put it in there?
2007-01-09T15:56:00.000Z	lupine_85	Mikey	if you can, I don't know where
2007-01-09T15:57:00.000Z	Mikey	lupine_85	ok, thx
