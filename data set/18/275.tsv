2012-05-10T04:19:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	Can you be more specific?
2012-05-10T04:19:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	So, are you wanting to turn it down?
2012-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	Do you know how to use the f-keys?
2012-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	Do you know how to use the function-keys?
2012-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	That's a bit strange.  Don't know what to make of that...
2012-05-10T04:21:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	What is the make and model of your Laptop?
2012-05-10T04:21:00.000Z	dasyogi	vfw	I tries setting the baclight to level 6 but once again it didn't work
2012-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	What do you have installed on it?
2012-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	(what OS?)
2012-05-10T04:23:00.000Z	dasyogi	vfw	Ubuntu 12.04
2012-05-10T04:24:00.000Z	vfw	dasyogi	Go into BIOS settings and see if you see somethig to do with function keys. Maybe something there [disabled]?
2012-05-10T04:25:00.000Z	dasyogi	vfw	i have a dual boot Win7 so it's not the BIOS settings
