2008-04-28T17:08:00.000Z	tau		hello all, a friend is trying to install ubuntu and needs to shrink his NTFS partition but the install is not letting him..  are there any easy to follow links about this?
2008-04-28T17:10:00.000Z	tau		anyone know how to shrink an NTFS partition?
2008-04-28T17:10:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	use gparted ?
2008-04-28T17:10:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	is there a guide somewhere explaining how to do it?
2008-04-28T17:12:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/resize/resizing.htm
2008-04-28T17:12:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	cool thanks!
2008-04-28T17:12:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	np, remember to back up your data :)
2008-04-28T17:13:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	yeah it's actually a friend that will be doing it, and I've told him to backup but he has nowhere to backup to so yeah
2008-04-28T17:15:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	do you know if gparted is on the livecd?
2008-04-28T17:45:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	sorry, i was away. if someone else didnt answer you, yes gparted is on the live cd.
2008-04-28T17:47:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	lol it's cool someone answered, thanks though...  do you know if gparted will double-check to make sure there aren't any stray files at the end of the partition before shrinking?
2008-04-28T17:47:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	really, im not sure. i would guess so yes.
2008-04-28T17:48:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	eep!  I guess they will just have to trust it :p
2008-04-28T17:48:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	if what Creationist says is true, then im not sure if its on the live cd now. anyways you can just apt-get it from the live session
2008-04-28T17:51:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	I totally missed that conversation the first time :p I find it hard to filter stuff through everyone talking in here..  Does that mean it's not necessary to run gparted separately but that it will be run by the installer as part of installation?
2008-04-28T17:52:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	yes you can use it through the installer, but you can also apt-get it in the live session.
2008-04-28T17:52:00.000Z	tau	lassegul	ok cool, I think it would be easier for my friend to run it via the installer.. thanks
2008-04-28T17:53:00.000Z	lassegul	tau	u got it.
