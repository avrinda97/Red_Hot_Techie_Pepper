2004-12-09T07:25:00.000Z	Skwid_		gdesklets
2004-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	Skwid_		how come my /mnt is empty ?
2004-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	Skwid_		fhs ?
2004-12-09T07:27:00.000Z	Skwid_		so that's where my windows stuff is ?
2004-12-09T07:27:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	things generally get mounted under /med in ubuntu
2004-12-09T07:27:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	windows fixed partitions are not automatically mounted in warty, sorry
2004-12-09T07:28:00.000Z	Skwid_	bob2	i don't understand though, when i put the live cd in, they were mounted
2004-12-09T07:31:00.000Z	Skwid_	bob2	so anybody using my user account can have root access ?
2004-12-09T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	anyone who you give your password to, yes
2004-12-09T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	unless you enable them, no
2004-12-12T10:57:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	because you're only changing it with the gnome applet?
2004-12-12T10:58:00.000Z	Skwid_	bob2	yeah
2005-01-26T10:54:00.000Z	Skwid_	bob2	intel chipset
2005-01-26T10:55:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	then probably, but their 3d acceleration isn't anything to write home about
2005-01-26T11:04:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	what rpm would you want to install?
2005-01-26T12:44:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	this isn't redhat
2005-01-26T12:44:00.000Z	bob2	Skwid_	what are you trying to do?
