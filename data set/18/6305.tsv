2008-05-26T12:03:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Hello!
2008-05-26T12:04:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	What's up? Just ask and we'll do our best.
2008-05-26T12:05:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Pop in the CD, install ubuntu, the partition manager will allow you to resize your partitions, then jjust install from there
2008-05-26T12:06:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Even without the CD. Just download the image, write it to a CD and do it tonight
2008-05-26T12:07:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	I do not think so. It will show what is being used and you canresize around that I think.
2008-05-26T12:08:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	do what Dr_Willis said. Just resize it and let your ubuntu use the unallocated part.
2008-05-26T12:08:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	I just switched about a month ago to linux for the first time and I love it!
2008-05-26T12:09:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	all my drivers work, but you can get them from 3rd party sites too
2008-05-26T12:09:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Yes! Buyt I can help you with that.
2008-05-26T12:10:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	From lenovo, the website that has my comp.
2008-05-26T12:10:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Wireless is simple enough. Just left-click to connect. Setting static is the hard part and I can walk you through that.
2008-05-26T12:11:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Why not just download and burn the image?
2008-05-26T12:12:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	You can have ubuntu tonight doing it that way.
2008-05-26T12:12:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	No, just get it from their site.
2008-05-26T12:12:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	What's your u/d?
2008-05-26T12:13:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	v
2008-05-26T12:14:00.000Z	Yachaziel	killakali408650	Ok! Good luck!
