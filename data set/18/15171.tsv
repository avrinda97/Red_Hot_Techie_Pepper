2006-08-24T09:17:00.000Z	dr_willis		foo perhaps ya got no speaker? :P
2006-08-24T09:18:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	I do. This worked fine on debian.
2007-05-23T08:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 yes it can get overwritten.
2007-05-23T08:06:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	Does it by default?
2007-05-23T08:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 theres some issue where hosts gets overwritten often with the wrong info.  I forget what causes it however. some service/networking setup stuff.
2007-05-23T08:07:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	If I don't touch anything or do anything, by default, on a fresh install, will it get overwritten?
2007-05-23T08:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 shouldent. its some networning service/extra thats doing it i recall
2007-05-23T08:09:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	ok, thanks
2008-10-04T12:46:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	I want to install version 3, and I think I Just download, untar, then run ./firefox
2008-10-04T12:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 what release of ubuntu you using? version 3 is  in the current repos.
2008-10-04T12:47:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	I'm on lenny/sid according to debian_version. My source files say gutsy, hmm
2008-10-04T12:48:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	gutsy
2008-10-04T12:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 you may want to upgrade to hardy, I think there was a FF3 packages for  gutsy - but i dont know for sure.
2008-10-04T12:50:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	hm, I'm debating making the move... a little afraid because if this breaks I really don't have the time to fix it / reinstall. Should I just use v2 until I have some time? Or should I upgrade to hardy?
2008-10-04T12:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 next release is due out in like 30 days also. :)
2008-10-04T12:51:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	hm, I'll just wait
2008-10-04T12:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	foo	 that wasent really 'source' :) but we get the idea
2008-10-04T12:52:00.000Z	foo	dr_willis	ha, that's true, I guess it isn't
