2009-07-09T23:52:00.000Z	comatsu		i am trying to connect and clone a HD, but when i connect it i get various errors such as 'Dev sdf: unable to read RDB block 0' and trying to dd gives me errors too 'dd: reading `/dev/sdf': Input/output error' anyway to force dd to clone anway?
2009-07-09T23:53:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	mand dd... There is an option to force dd to continue even if there are errors. However, I think your drive is bad....
2009-07-09T23:53:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	Make that "man dd"
2009-07-09T23:54:00.000Z	comatsu	linuxninja	the drive was part of a RAID 0 array could that be the reason for the errors, or does it seem the the drive is actually dying?
2009-07-09T23:54:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	Hmm... can you do a "fdisk -l" and see the drive in the list?
2009-07-09T23:54:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	You need to do all these commands as root
2009-07-09T23:56:00.000Z	comatsu	linuxninja	no it does not seem to be listed with fdisk -l
2009-07-09T23:58:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	hmm... it could be a raid issue... but it should show you the drive. I think...
2009-07-09T23:58:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	try "mdadm -D /dev/md0"
2009-07-09T23:59:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	I don't think that command will do anything but ya never know
2009-07-09T23:59:00.000Z	comatsu	linuxninja	if it makes any difference this was a hardware raid (asus motherboard), the motherboard died a while ago and im trying to clone the 2 drives in hope of recreating it through software
2009-07-10T00:00:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	Hmm... That could be your problem. What kind of hardware raid?
2009-07-10T00:00:00.000Z	comatsu	linuxninja	i only know it was RAID 0... thought i could perhaps work my way up from there by trying stuff if i manage to clone the drives
2009-07-10T00:00:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	Oh
2009-07-10T00:01:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	If it's raid 0 then you just lost everything. Well, that would be my guess... Raid 0 goes bad when 1 drive fails
2009-07-10T00:01:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	You need both drives working for raid 0 to work...
2009-07-10T00:01:00.000Z	comatsu	linuxninja	yeah i think thats the case..  well thanks for your help anyway :)
2009-07-10T00:02:00.000Z	linuxninja	comatsu	in any case, good luck...
