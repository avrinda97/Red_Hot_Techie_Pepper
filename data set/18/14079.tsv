2007-01-02T06:04:00.000Z	pexi		hi, someone had problems with the lastest fglrx drivers version??
2007-01-02T06:05:00.000Z	pexi		like freeze gdm???
2007-01-02T06:05:00.000Z	bsharitt	pexi	Does it only do this after updating the drivers?
2007-01-02T06:05:00.000Z	pexi		yes
2007-01-02T06:06:00.000Z	pexi		if i use the ald drivers all work good
2007-01-02T06:06:00.000Z	bsharitt		Well after updating to Edgy, gdm pretty much freezes for me, so I have to use kernel 2.6.15-23 from dapper
2007-01-02T06:07:00.000Z	pexi		i will try this
2007-01-02T06:07:00.000Z	pexi		maybe is because of this
2007-01-02T06:07:00.000Z	pexi	bsharitt	thanks
2007-01-02T06:08:00.000Z	bsharitt		I recompiled the latest Edgy kernel and vanilla kernel, and both times It still freezes
2007-01-02T06:08:00.000Z	bsharitt	pexi	is the Ubuntu loading screen gray distorted?
2007-01-02T06:08:00.000Z	bsharitt		instead of brown
2007-01-02T06:09:00.000Z	pexi	bsharitt	no, only gdm image
2007-01-02T06:09:00.000Z	bsharitt	pexi	you may have an unrelated problem then
2007-01-02T06:09:00.000Z	pexi		yes, i think so
2007-01-02T06:10:00.000Z	bsharitt		but I do have 2.6.15-23 with the latest ATI drivers and it works
2007-01-02T06:10:00.000Z	pexi		ok, i'll try with other kernel
2007-01-02T06:10:00.000Z	bsharitt	pexi	did you remember to disable the default ubuntu fglrx module?
