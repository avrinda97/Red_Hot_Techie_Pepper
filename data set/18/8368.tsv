2007-09-05T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	you get your broken packages fixed?
2007-09-05T05:43:00.000Z	yakov	nickrud	nope
2007-09-05T05:43:00.000Z	yakov		trying to figure out what does that mean..
2007-09-05T05:44:00.000Z	yakov		seems like i have 2.5.1 and -dev is 2.5.1-rcX...
2007-09-05T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	could you put the complete error on a pastebin? It usually means you've got missing/conflicting stuff in /etc/apt/sources.list , could you put that up as well
2007-09-05T05:44:00.000Z	yakov		maybe i missed some repo. :/
2007-09-05T05:44:00.000Z	yakov	nickrud	sure
2007-09-05T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	one more thing to put up: the output of dpkg -l 'python2.5*'
2007-09-05T05:46:00.000Z	yakov	nickrud	strange... ive double checked sources.. well, ive added gutsy there for kernel only and.. added /etc/apt/preferences
2007-09-05T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	oooooh pinning!
2007-09-05T05:47:00.000Z	yakov		after i've removed everything re gutsy it has worked (:
2007-09-05T05:47:00.000Z	yakov	nickrud	thx for the tip!
2007-09-05T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	a sec, there's a global setting if I can remember it
2007-09-05T05:53:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	you want to set     APT::Default-Release "feisty";   in a file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d ; that will prioritize fiesty when there's any doubt about which package to get while you have gutsy sources.
2007-09-05T05:53:00.000Z	yakov	nickrud	many thanks!.. will do right now...
2007-09-05T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-apt-get.en.html#s-default-version for more details
2007-09-05T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	truth in advertising: I believe feisty is the correct term, I've only done this in debian. You may need to ask around for the correct term
2007-09-05T05:57:00.000Z	nickrud	yakov	one more thing: when you upgrade to gutsy, don't forget to update that setting
