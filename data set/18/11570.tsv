2006-09-27T11:46:00.000Z	SeraVitae		so wait lemme get this right
2006-09-27T11:46:00.000Z	SeraVitae		with like XDMCP or whatever
2006-09-27T11:46:00.000Z	SeraVitae		you can like run the x 'client' on one machine
2006-09-27T11:46:00.000Z	SeraVitae		and it gets sent text messages or whatever
2006-09-27T11:46:00.000Z	SeraVitae		of what to display.. from the x 'server' on another machine?
2006-09-27T11:46:00.000Z	SeraVitae		sorta like vnc but rather than sending all video/i-o data, it just sends messages?
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	SeraVitae		that is made of WIN. can i use an XDMCP client on windows?
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	harisund	SeraVitae	Yes. You can install the X server in Cygwin and use that.
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	SeraVitae		Cool.
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	SeraVitae		i meant using windows as the client, but yeah.
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	SeraVitae		i'd rather use my nix box at home via my windows box at uni.
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	harisund	SeraVitae	there's just one caveat to using XDMCP though. It's fast and all that due to no encryption, but you need a publicly resolvable IP address on the client side.
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	SeraVitae		that said, my linux box just died.
2006-09-27T11:47:00.000Z	SeraVitae	harisund	- i'm cool with that
2006-09-27T11:48:00.000Z	harisund	SeraVitae	There are other options for the remote access of Linux machines from school Windows machines :)
2006-09-27T11:48:00.000Z	SeraVitae		true
2006-09-27T11:48:00.000Z	SeraVitae		how can i boot linux from grub> ?
2006-09-27T11:48:00.000Z	harisund	SeraVitae	boot Linux from grub? What does that mean? You lost the grub configuration files?
