2009-03-31T19:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	tried #clonezilla?
2010-03-25T18:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	what do you need a tutorial for? just using proftpd?
2010-03-25T18:19:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	installing, configuring
2010-03-25T18:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	okay, so what's stopping you from searching ubuntuforums.org for certain keywords such as "proftpd setup tutorial"?
2010-03-25T18:20:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	i have spent the last two days doing that but the gui does not work
2010-03-25T18:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	uhm, why do you need to use a gui?
2010-03-25T18:22:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	why do most epople who just started linux use GUI?
2010-03-25T18:22:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	apart from that i was told to
2010-03-25T18:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	ah, well I didn't know that.  I used to set it up by editting the proftpd.conf file itself. found that I was able to get results faster that way. but let's see here...
2010-03-25T18:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	have you read this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79588&
2010-03-25T18:24:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	yes
2010-03-25T18:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	some of that is pretty old, but much of it, like the config file editting, is unchanged in years
2010-03-25T18:25:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	he doesnt need access to a home folder he needs access to mbuk and only mbuk which is inside www
2010-03-25T18:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	I don't know what mbuk is. I can only guess that it's a subdir
2010-03-25T18:25:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Gnea	sorry yea it is
2010-03-25T18:26:00.000Z	Gnea	Jimi_Neutral	no problem. but yeah, just like histo said, just set it up like any old user account. there's even a configuration directive that you can use to chroot jail it.
