2006-12-17T11:42:00.000Z	MSTK		excuse me.  i'm new to Ubuntu.  I currently have this error in my synaptic package manager.  Does anyone mind helping?
2006-12-17T11:43:00.000Z	MSTK		oh, heh.  thanks
2006-12-17T11:43:00.000Z	MSTK		The error details: "E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. "  -- when I run that in the terminal, it says that the command requires Superuser privileges.
2006-12-17T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	put sudo infront of it
2006-12-17T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	automatix itself is liable to cause it's own slew of problems
2006-12-17T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	reinstalling should fix it
2006-12-17T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	you were installing java via autoamtix?
2006-12-17T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	then remove completely.  And reinstall java by hand
2006-12-17T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	alright, well, remove it completely anyway.  Then you can install it again later
2006-12-17T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	no, that's a command, with the full path.  I don't know what to tell you, I've never installed DVD stuff
2006-12-17T12:08:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	try cd /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/ (no need for sudo) then 'ls' to see what files *are* there
2006-12-17T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	when in doubt, tab complete ;)
2007-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	just backup your thunderbird files before doing it.  You can always back them up
2007-04-20T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	`man ln`
2007-04-29T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	At grub, hit 'e' then remove the 'quiet' and 'splash' from the line, then boot, and you'll know more about what's going on
2007-04-29T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	grub is the bootloader.  Uh, if you don't see the menu (to select which ekrnel) hit escape after your POST screen
2007-05-01T05:32:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	you'd edit the config, and setting timestamp_timeout to zero means you have no memory, and a negative number means you have infinite.
2007-05-05T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	MSTK	screen really is the most productive thing you'll get.  Everything else is just individual programs.
