2011-08-27T00:01:00.000Z	BetaArc		Anyone can help me with a SSD install on Ubuntu?
2011-08-27T00:03:00.000Z	BetaArc		I want to install Ubuntu 11.04 on my new SSD, but don't know how to start. Got Ubuntu 11.04 running on my 'old' HDD, but with my fresh SSD I don't know what would be a good setup.
2011-08-27T00:03:00.000Z	BetaArc		Should I use GPT or MBR, wich filesystem(s), btfrs/ext4/nilfs?
2011-08-27T00:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	What is your use case? How large is the drive? Are you comfortable with losing all the files on the drive? (btrfs is still experimental)
2011-08-27T00:06:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	Laptop, study, 90GB, Yes (Have dropbox for sync)
2011-08-27T00:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	Study as in "I need to do homework" or study as in "I'm experimenting with different technologies to learn"?
2011-08-27T00:17:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	Both
2011-08-27T00:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	Then I would recommend that you try GPT. Ubuntu's installer won't use it by default on a drive that small as the older msdos ("MBR") partition table will have not be running into the 2 TiB limit. While it won't be offered by default (and I don't off hand know how to get it to use GPT, you'll hopefully learn in the process of figuring it out) GPT is well supported. The only issue you might have is if you were trying to dual boot Windows on the ...
2011-08-27T00:22:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	Yes, I have a option to boot with UEFI (bios) and Windows x64 'should' install perfect than :)
2011-08-27T00:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	UEFI can be a major pain withot signifigant gain. Consider yourself warned :)
2011-08-27T00:24:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	What do you mean? Is it dangerous?
2011-08-27T00:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	No, just annoying in many ways.
2011-08-27T00:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	As for filesystems, IMHO the only reasonable choices are ext4 and btrfs. Btrfs is certainly awesome and fun to play with, but be prepared to do a complete re-install at the least convenient time possible (like the day before a major assignment is due).
2011-08-27T00:28:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	Wich I never bought a SSD, so must trouble.. :(
2011-08-27T00:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	What does any of this have do to with the drive being an SSD? That is mostly irrelevant to the choice of filesystem and partition table (at least at the moment).
2011-08-27T00:31:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	From what I read ext4 is not the recommend way and btrfs is still experimental, If I still need to reinstall the whole system :(
2011-08-27T00:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BetaArc	On a quality SSD the wear leveling and lifespan of the drive should be enough that ext4's journaling should not be a problem.
2011-08-27T00:34:00.000Z	BetaArc	Jordan_U	Oke :D, thanks.. think going for btrfs and use GPT scheme
