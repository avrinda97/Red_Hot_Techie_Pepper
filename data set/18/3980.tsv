2010-04-09T18:16:00.000Z	Hylian		anyone know if the ati fglrx driver for the x1300 can function in 9.10?
2010-04-09T18:16:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	it wont
2010-04-09T18:17:00.000Z	Hylian	indus	thanx. i was hoping it would. i am still being forced to use pclinuxos 2009. not my first choice, but it uses my ati driver. :(
2010-04-09T18:18:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	because older chips are no longer supported , but unless you game, the open source driver works great
2010-04-09T18:19:00.000Z	Hylian	indus	i tried the open source driver, made the screen funky and continuously crashed the pc.
2010-04-09T18:19:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	hmm shouldnt , it works nice with x 1300
2010-04-09T18:19:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	well, difficult to trouble shoot these things
2010-04-09T18:20:00.000Z	Hylian	indus	maybe ill try it again then, maybe something happened since 9.04. but since windows with my driver and pclinuxos09 with the linux ati driver both work without hiccups, and then ubuntu with the open source driver is buggior than a swamp, i assumed it was the opensource driver
2010-04-09T18:21:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	oh a lot has changed since 9.04 the drivers are much improved
2010-04-09T18:22:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	try 10.04 beta 2 :)
2010-04-09T18:22:00.000Z	Hylian	indus	thats great news. I am a gamer, but i can live without games. I just cant live without pc halting bugs.
2010-04-09T18:22:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	you can play games too except a few like quake 4
2010-04-09T18:23:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	also with tthe open source driver you get a nice graphical boot experience etc
2010-04-09T18:23:00.000Z	Hylian	indus	thats impressive, because in 9.04, the open source driver could barely run the pc. Happy happy joy joy, LOL
2010-04-09T18:23:00.000Z	indus	Hylian	flicker free boot by april release of 10.04
2010-04-09T18:24:00.000Z	Hylian	indus	thanks man!
