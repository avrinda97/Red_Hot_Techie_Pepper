2010-08-03T12:22:00.000Z	AviMarcus|		so uh, can someone help a recent windows user with network issue? last night a new kernal got everything work peachy. Now, in the morning a reboot later, even the wired doesn't work.
2010-08-03T12:24:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	what is the problem? can you be a bit more descriptive?
2010-08-03T12:26:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	what kind of network card / computer are you using?
2010-08-03T12:27:00.000Z	AviMarcus|	DiploCat	it's a dell inspiron 6400, broadcom bcm 4401 eth, bcm 4311 wlan
2010-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	AviMarcus|	DiploCat	any ideas?
2010-08-03T12:33:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	just looking into that card... what version of ubuntu (or kernel) are you running?
2010-08-03T12:35:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	are you cards being recognised at all? in a terminal try: lspci - are they listed? and if so, what info do you get from: ifconfig ?
2010-08-03T12:42:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	how about if you type: lsmod - does it come up there?
2010-08-03T12:44:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	b44 in particular
2010-08-03T12:45:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	what did you do to install it originally? did it just work, or did you have to run some "modprobe" commands?
2010-08-03T12:48:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	did you install ssb or ndiswrapper or something like that? eth0 doesn't disappear for the fun of it :)
2010-08-03T12:54:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	I'm not sure why anything would have changed after a reboot, I guess it depends on what network settings / stuff you installed when it was working... it might be worth trying: modprobe b44 - but I am just guessing without knowing more info about how it started :\
2010-08-03T12:55:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	try sudo modprobe -r ssb b44 - and then sudo modprobe b44
2010-08-03T12:56:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	yeah, apparently ssb causes probs with wired on that card
2010-08-03T12:57:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	you might want to check /etc/modules to see if it's set to auto load on boot (if it is, get rid of it)
2010-08-03T12:58:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	this article might solve your problem: http://gf4e.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/ndiswrapper-and-ssb-conflict/
2010-08-03T13:00:00.000Z	DiploCat	AviMarcus|	or this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1273632
2010-08-03T13:58:00.000Z	AviMarcus|	DiploCat	and KE1HA - thanks so much. After several reboots, both wired and wireless now wok automatically upon boot, with a minor edit to the /etc/modules, etc. Thanks!!!!
