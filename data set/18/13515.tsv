2006-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	Ratzilla		dos xgl/compiz work with dapper properly?
2006-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	yup
2006-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	awesome :)
2006-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	it's better with aiglx
2006-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	on edgy that is
2006-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	and if your chipset supports it
2006-10-31T13:20:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	xgl works with dapper
2006-10-31T13:21:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	does updating distro version work with ubuntu well now? i remember when i went from breezy to dapper, it wasnt the best..
2006-10-31T13:21:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	some people have had problems
2006-10-31T13:22:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	oh okay, thanks, i guess i can just nab edgy and then use aiglx on it
2006-10-31T13:22:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	what graphics card do you use?
2006-10-31T13:22:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	i have a nvidia 6600 go
2006-10-31T13:22:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	you have to use xgl then
2006-10-31T13:23:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	whats the main difference between the two?
2006-10-31T13:23:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	xgl is a complete rewrite of xorg by novell whereas aiglx is just continued development of the xorg tree and was worked on by freedesktop.org and redhat
2006-10-31T13:25:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	so m video card isnt supported by aiglx? thats fine as long as i can use compiz..im downloading edgy right now and then illl use xgl..thanks
2006-10-31T13:28:00.000Z	Ratzilla	variant	turn compiz on and off? will that automatically load the gnome-panel?
2006-10-31T13:29:00.000Z	variant	Ratzilla	i turn it off sometimes cus it can get annoying.. once the themes are more mature and a bit less tacky it will be better as default :)
