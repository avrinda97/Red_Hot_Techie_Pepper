2008-05-02T20:54:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	what do you want to do?
2008-05-02T20:55:00.000Z	xintron	ghostknife	Get a flashing terminal when someone hilights me on irssi
2008-05-02T20:55:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	want the task bar to highlight/flash?
2008-05-02T20:55:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	ah, well your terminal needs to support it. irssi sends the \a escape sequence when it highlights. Your terminal needs to convert this to a visual bell
2008-05-02T20:56:00.000Z	xintron	ghostknife	wanna tell me how?
2008-05-02T20:56:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	no idea. I don't know which terminals support that
2008-05-02T20:56:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	ask in ##linux, they might know. Or ask in #gnome if the gnome terminal supports turning it on or something
2008-05-02T20:56:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	as long as the terminal software supports it, everything will work fine
2008-05-02T20:57:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	if the terminal supports it but with some OTHER escape sequence, then let me know. I'll give you a script that sends that escape sequence. What you can also do is play an MP3 when someone types your nick, then you choose some distinct sounds that will notify you
2008-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	ghostknife	xintron	did you come right witht the visual bell?
2008-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	xintron	ghostknife	Didn't have time to work on that at the time and it's not priority atm. But I'll tell you if I get it owrking
