2009-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	darlek	gasquetfan	can you open a terminal?  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg maybe... I'd read up on that command first though.  IT will jst make a dummy xorg.conf file.  Your old one should be in /etc/X11/xorg or in /etc/X11 somewhere.
2009-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	gasquetfan		thanks a lot u guys...
2009-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	gasquetfan		yes I can open a terminal.
2009-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	gasquetfan		I'll try that
2009-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	gasquetfan		I am right now on recovery console :)
2009-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	darlek	gasquetfan	I have a whole bunch of xorg.conf.<date> files, so maybe there's an older file in there on your end that can help show you the different between your current xorg.conf file and a previous file
