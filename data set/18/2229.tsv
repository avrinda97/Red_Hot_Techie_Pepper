2011-05-06T01:06:00.000Z	Cheese		Hey
2011-05-06T01:07:00.000Z	Cheese		I just installed fedora which got rid of my old GRUB2 and ubuntu is not included in the new boot loader GRUB .97. Is there any way i can add ubuntu to this new bootloader?
2011-05-06T01:08:00.000Z	Cheese		How do i add an operating system to GRUB
2011-05-06T01:08:00.000Z	Cheese		Oh im sorry
2011-05-06T01:09:00.000Z	Cheese		I was just rephrasing because the first thing i said was kinda confusing>
2011-05-06T01:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	you usually don't have to
2011-05-06T01:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	GRUB will detect them for you
2011-05-06T01:09:00.000Z	Cheese	tensorpudding	When you install fedora it erases your old bootloader.
2011-05-06T01:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	is Fedora using GRUB 2?
2011-05-06T01:10:00.000Z	Cheese	tensorpudding	Fedora 14 is using GRUB legacy
2011-05-06T01:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	that's a bit of a nuisance
2011-05-06T01:11:00.000Z	Cheese	tensorpudding	yea, if i really have to ill just reinstall GRUB2... but i feel like there would be a way to just add it to GRUB legacy
2011-05-06T01:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	but you have to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file by hand
2011-05-06T01:12:00.000Z	Cheese	tensorpudding	would i be editing that file within the operating system?
2011-05-06T01:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	it's in the /boot partition of Fedora, i think
2011-05-06T01:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	to be sure, you should ask in #fedora
2011-05-06T01:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	about how their version of GRUB does things
2011-05-06T01:18:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Cheese	i think it's possible to tell the installer to not overwrite GRUB, it's a bunch of manual work unfortunately
