2005-06-09T09:29:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	easier said than done half the time.. lots of programs require it to be running.. noatun...
2005-06-09T09:29:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	the only answer to that is: don't use programs which won't work with standard sound controls.
2005-06-09T09:30:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	every programmer has a different version of "standard" :P
2005-06-09T09:30:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	i'm talking about OSS.
2005-06-09T09:31:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	i know, sound issues on my workstation are driving me crazy though
2005-06-09T09:31:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	seek205: another option is to use the 'arstdsp' wrapper which comes with arts.
2005-06-09T09:33:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	some package is corrupt on my printed copies of ubuntu, know of a way to get around the issue?
2005-06-09T09:34:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	i don't know what you mean.
2005-06-09T09:34:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	above ^
2005-06-09T09:35:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	don't use them; download a new installer.
2005-06-09T09:35:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	no way to burn
2005-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	sucks to be you.
2005-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	know if the install kernel has loopback device support?
2005-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	Guerin	mngriff	no idea.
2005-06-09T09:40:00.000Z	mngriff	Guerin	there's a lot about this project that astounds me every time i mess with it
