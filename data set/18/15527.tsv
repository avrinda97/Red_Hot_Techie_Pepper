2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	fc9k		anyone fancy helping a noob?
2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	fc9k		trying to install ndiswrapper, and the instructions tell me to use the command make
2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	fc9k		so i type make, and it says bash: make: command not found or something
2005-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	fc9k		is it on the disc, or do i need internet access for it?
2005-10-20T15:47:00.000Z	fc9k		thing is chaps, i need to install ndiswrapper to get my WLAN card working in ubuntu
2005-10-20T15:47:00.000Z	fc9k		without which i  cant access internet :D
2005-10-20T15:47:00.000Z	fc9k		so can i download a file for the build-essential and run it offline in ubuntu?
2005-10-20T15:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	fc9k	build-essential should be on the install cd (is for hoary, anyway)
2005-10-20T15:48:00.000Z	fc9k	HappyFool	wicked, i'll have a perusal
2005-10-20T15:48:00.000Z	fc9k	HappyFool	is it easy to install off the cd?  how would i go about it?
2005-10-20T15:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	fc9k	use synaptic. system -> admin -> synaptic
2005-10-20T15:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	fc9k	have you read the ndiswrapper page on the wiki?
2005-10-20T15:49:00.000Z	fc9k	HappyFool	the ubuntu wiki? i'll have a look
2005-10-20T15:51:00.000Z	fc9k	HappyFool	i know its buggy, but sadly theres no native support for my adapter as I run a shuttle and so use a USB one :S
2005-10-20T15:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	fc9k	i believe ndiswrapper is the only option for a number of cards; i don't use it myself
2005-10-20T15:52:00.000Z	fc9k	HappyFool	yeah i'm going to give it a go.  as far as i know though there are very few USB cards that have native linux support.
2005-10-20T15:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	fc9k	there's a page on the wiki listing support for (some) cards
2005-10-20T15:52:00.000Z	fc9k	HappyFool	yeah, i read that
