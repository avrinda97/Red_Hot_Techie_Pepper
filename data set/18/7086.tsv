2008-02-09T19:57:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		Hi everyone
2008-02-09T19:58:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		I'm trying to connect to my wireless access points configuration interface, however, it shows it's ip address as the DHCP address assisgned to it by my ISP, is there a way I can connect to it without unplugging the modem?
2008-02-09T20:00:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	you're access point probably has another ip-adress too..something like 192.168.0.1 or similar
2008-02-09T20:00:00.000Z	MrTHaggar	Slart	is there a way I can find out what it is?
2008-02-09T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	from the manual usually.. you can try 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.50, or 192.168.100.1
2008-02-09T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	those are the ones I've seen used...
2008-02-09T20:02:00.000Z	MrTHaggar	Slart	the thing is I'm on DHCP, and my IP is assigned from my isp, and the access point almost becomes transparaent, so the ip of my default gateway doesn't work as the interface address
2008-02-09T20:03:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	what's the brand and model of the access point?
2008-02-09T20:03:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		Is there a multi ping program for ubuntu, so I can ping a range.
2008-02-09T20:03:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		It's a D-link DWL-2000AP+
2008-02-09T20:04:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		I did try the IP address, however I'm not being assigned a private 192 address, I'm getting a public IP address straight from my ISP
2008-02-09T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	from googling, as grndslm nicely told you, http://whirlpool.net.au/index.cfm?a=h_view&model_id=303
2008-02-09T20:05:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	if you won't accept advice given to you.. you might as well not come here at all
2008-02-09T20:05:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		I'm not not accepting it :)
2008-02-09T20:05:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		Please don't think I'm being rude.
2008-02-09T20:06:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		That site lists the default IP as 192.168.0.50, but I'm not being assigned a 192 address, I'm getting a publick 80. address.
2008-02-09T20:07:00.000Z	MrTHaggar		:)
2008-02-09T20:07:00.000Z	Slart	MrTHaggar	sigh.. you have a router, right? a router has at least 2 interfaces.. 1 external with your external ip.. one is internal
