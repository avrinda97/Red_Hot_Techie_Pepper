2006-04-15T10:12:00.000Z	zambaboo		when i nmap my own machine, a black frame shows up around my desktop. i am guessing this is because port 5500 is open.. am i right?
2006-04-15T10:14:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	a black frame?
2006-04-15T10:15:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	yep, thick black frame
2006-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	what are you running?  KDE, gnome...?
2006-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	vanilla breezy
2006-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	still, are you using KDE or GNOME or what?
2006-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	gnome
2006-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	zambaboo		nmap me on port 5500 real quick
2006-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	and when you say you nmap your own machine, exactly what command are you using?
2006-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	nmap <my external ip>
2006-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	first please show me the command you've used that's caused it
2006-04-15T10:18:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	like i said, nmap <my external ip>
2006-04-15T10:18:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	oh...that's it?  ok...how long does the black frame remain on screen?
2006-04-15T10:18:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	less than a second.
2006-04-15T10:19:00.000Z	blujay	zambaboo	hm...strange.  do you happen to have KDE or XFCE installed as well?
2006-04-15T10:19:00.000Z	zambaboo	blujay	i have windowmaker installed and i also have vncviewer -listen running, so please disregard, i just answered my own question. :)
