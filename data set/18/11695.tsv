2006-12-15T09:30:00.000Z	Isyth		Hey everyone, I'm having some problems installing ubuntu onto my 'new' second-hand compaq armada m700 laptop
2006-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	Isyth		it can't read the breezy CD and it stalls during the Dapper installing
2006-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	kupo	Isyth	hw specs?
2006-12-15T09:32:00.000Z	kupo		sure
2006-12-15T09:32:00.000Z	Isyth		pentium III 550mHz 128mb ram
2006-12-15T09:32:00.000Z	kupo		nothing else
2006-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	kupo		just vlc
2006-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	Isyth	kupo	pentium III 550mHz 128mb ram
2006-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	kupo		you prolly should try the alternative install cd Isyth
2006-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	kupo		how does the livecd run on it Isyth ? slow?
2006-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	Isyth	kupo	the Breezy live CD doesn't run at all and the Dapper one is quite slow but working.
2006-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	kupo		yeah I would use the etch alternative cd
2006-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	kupo		you'll have a ncurses based install menu
2006-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	kupo	Isyth	if you can up to 256ram total it'll make a big difference
2006-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	Isyth	kupo	maybe that'll work. But what's that you said about the alternative install?
2006-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	kupo	Isyth	its where you dl the isos on the website
2006-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	kupo		its made for systems with less than 192 of ram
2006-12-15T09:36:00.000Z	Isyth	kupo	that might do the trick. I'm having some problems opening the laptop to see where the ram goes... I'm not used to laptops.
