2011-05-17T16:42:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	never open any documents?
2011-05-17T16:43:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	LOL
2011-05-17T16:44:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	So you really don't have an answer?
2011-05-17T16:47:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	I lookd but cant seem to find any place where its storing that information
2011-05-17T16:47:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	It's been driving me nuts since install.
2011-05-17T16:48:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	if your in unity, try switching to clasic and clearing it out the old fashioned way
2011-05-17T16:49:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	I didn't like Unity so I switched back to classic. It doesn't work like it used to
2011-05-17T16:50:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	gnome3 here :) I have no idea
2011-05-17T16:50:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	Is gnome3 working?
2011-05-17T16:50:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	its unsupported
2011-05-17T16:51:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	Ok, I may try it on my test laptop. I don't like Unity at all
2011-05-17T16:52:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	I installed with debootstrap and installed from a ppa, avoiding installing unity and gnome all together
2011-05-17T16:53:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	You had no problems doing it that way?
2011-05-17T16:53:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	you need HW accelrated video, your laptop might not make the grade
2011-05-17T16:53:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	Ahhh, OK
2011-05-17T16:53:00.000Z	pfifo	AceKing	I had a list of problems as long as my arm
2011-05-17T16:54:00.000Z	AceKing	pfifo	Yeah, I think I'll wait then. Thanks for the info.
