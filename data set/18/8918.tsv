2010-01-04T20:00:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I'm numbing it.  How do I remount nfs shares that are already in fstab ?
2010-01-04T20:00:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	sudo mount -a
2010-01-04T20:01:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	thanks
2011-06-13T19:43:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	hold shift during boot to get the grub menu.
2011-06-13T19:44:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	criminy...  I was hitting delete and swiping across all the F keys.
2011-06-13T19:53:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	thanks.  I booted to another kernel, but still can't see anything.  Everything but my eyes are working though, which is good.  And the kernel was held back anyway (I just found out by ssh-ing in)
2011-06-13T19:54:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	you can install the newer kernel if you want.. 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' will pull in the kernel.. not that that is a solution but it might help
2011-06-13T19:54:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	no, lucid is good, and the kernel isn't the problem
2011-06-13T19:55:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	dist-upgrade will not change distro's.
2011-06-13T19:56:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	I thought that would bring me up to the next distro
2011-06-13T19:57:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	nope, it'll update your current packages to the latest available in the repo for your current distro.. also it'll allow you to install automatically held back packages
2012-03-02T03:17:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	yeah the left side of the screen.
2012-03-02T03:18:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	What do you mean?  Nothing happens when I mouse over there.
2012-03-02T03:19:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	you mean dash or the unity bar?
2012-03-02T03:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	I think the Unity Bar.  And I found what you were probably talking about in System Settings --> User Interface --> Behavior --> Reveal Spot.  Sending the pointer into the left side doesn't consistently bring the bar out though.
2012-03-02T03:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	I could just quit hiding it...
2012-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	bastidrazor	craigbass1976	'sudo -i' will give you a root prompt. much safer than setting a root password.
2012-04-04T05:14:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bastidrazor	I can't believe I never knew that...
