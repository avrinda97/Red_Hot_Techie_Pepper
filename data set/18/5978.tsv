2008-07-21T08:09:00.000Z	CTD1		is there any way to deny specific executables audio access in ubuntu? without the process knowing /crashing? is there a program for it?

2008-07-21T08:13:00.000Z	CTD1		its just a program im running that plays loud sounds and if sound is turned off as a program preference the program is buggy, how do i deny it audio access without it being unstable bazhang?
2008-07-21T08:14:00.000Z	CTD1		the name of the program is irrelevant to my question bazhang
2008-07-21T08:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	if you use pulseaudio, that has a "remember volume" per application approach, try "pavucontrol" and set the level to what you want or mute even for that app, might do the trick
2008-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	CTD1		how do i know if i use pulseaudio or not glitsj16?
2008-07-21T08:19:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	well, see if the pulseaudio daemon is running at least, if "pidof pulseaudio" returns a process id number, it is running ..
2008-07-21T08:20:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	i believe gnome has a setting for sound as well where you can choose ALSA or any other sound server system, being on xubuntu i don't know the exact menu item for that .. browse around a bit, can't be too deeply hidden i suppose
2008-07-21T08:20:00.000Z	CTD1		that process is running glitsj16 and i installed pavucontrol but it only shows preferences for pidgin instant messenger
2008-07-21T08:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	you need to play something with the app in question for it to show up in there
2008-07-21T08:29:00.000Z	CTD1	glitsj16	ive restartant pavucontrol and the process that is continually making sounds and it still only shows pidgin
2008-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	hang on, checking something .. give me a minute
2008-07-21T08:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	did you choose "show: --> all streams" in pavucontrol ? you can also check if you have simultaneous output ticked in paprefs (last tab labelled as such)
2008-07-21T08:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	.. but the app in question might use your sound card directly, without knowing which app it is (and i do digg you not willing to name that) i'm afraid it's hard to give any real help, hope you can get it working to your liking
2008-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	CTD1		paprefs didnt help any glitsj16, is there a way i can run the process on a limited account that doesnt have audio access? is that possible?
2008-07-21T08:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	might be, don't know how though ..
2008-07-21T08:39:00.000Z	CTD1		thanks any ways glitsj16 i guess ill just have to tough it out
2008-07-21T08:40:00.000Z	glitsj16	CTD1	you're welcome, it might work if you can get a user group defined which doesn't have any sound access and running it under that user, google around a bit .. goodluck
