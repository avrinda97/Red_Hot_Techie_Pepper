2009-04-17T02:36:00.000Z	eugen_		hey, I got compiz running, but seems a little sluggish, and motion blur doesn't work. Does it not use hardware acceleration?
2009-04-17T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	afaik compiz uses hardware acc if it's available.. what graphics card are you using?
2009-04-17T02:37:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	I have nvidia
2009-04-17T02:37:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	and I installed the nvidia drivers and nvidia-setings tool
2009-04-17T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	what model?
2009-04-17T02:38:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	anywa way to check to see if its enabled?
2009-04-17T02:38:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	Geforce M GS VRAM: 512
2009-04-17T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	run "glxgears -info" in a terminal.. look at the first couple of lines.. it will tell you what renderer it's using
2009-04-17T02:39:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	sounds powerful enough.. compiz ought to be smooth and nice
2009-04-17T02:39:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	glxgears doesn't seem to say anything about hw accel...

2009-04-17T02:40:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	pastebin those first 5 or so lines
2009-04-17T02:42:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	here's what it looks like on my computer http://paste.ubuntu.com/152408/
2009-04-17T02:42:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu.com:80/152409/
2009-04-17T02:43:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	well, why do you think motion blur doesn't work...I assumed cause hw acc wassnt utilized
2009-04-17T02:43:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	might be something else then.. from that output it looks like your graphics card is working nicely
2009-04-17T02:44:00.000Z	Slart	eugen_	you can try asking in #compiz-fusion , I think that's the channel for compiz support
2009-04-17T02:45:00.000Z	eugen_	Slart	ok
