2005-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	aliasd		i got a couple of questions
2005-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	aliasd		1. is the root password randomised, changed periodically?
2005-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	aliasd		the password is nothing?
2005-04-27T09:12:00.000Z	aliasd		umm... there has to be a root password, weather or not anyone knows it :)
2005-04-27T09:13:00.000Z	aliasd		fair nuff
2005-04-27T09:13:00.000Z	aliasd		anyway
2005-04-27T09:13:00.000Z	aliasd		how do i get packages from the universe apt repository to add themselves into the gnome menus?
2005-04-27T09:14:00.000Z	aliasd		hmm, i will try that
2005-04-27T09:14:00.000Z	aliasd		is that the debian menu system?
2005-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	aliasd		gnome really needs something like the kde appfinder, or that similar program for windows
2005-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	g14	aliasd	like beagle's Bleeding edge search tool maybe?
2005-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	aliasd	g14	is that what im after?
2005-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	aliasd		oh, like mac's finder?
2005-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	g14	aliasd	Beagle is what Longhorn aspires to be with WinFS search
2005-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	g14	aliasd	and it is sort of equivalent to Apple's spotlight search
2005-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	aliasd		fair nuff
2005-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	aliasd		i like the idea of beagle
