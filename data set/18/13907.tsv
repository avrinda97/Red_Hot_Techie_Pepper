2006-07-31T05:48:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser		is it possible for a secondary hard drive to be accessed and modified on both windows and ubuntu os's
2006-07-31T05:48:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser		?
2006-07-31T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	yes - format it with FAT32 (both can read and write that natively) or ext2 (you need a Windows driver for that)
2006-07-31T05:49:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser	soundray	the system > administration > disks doesnt have a fat32 option
2006-07-31T05:50:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	use gparted instead
2006-07-31T05:51:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	to create partitions if needed. After that, use mkdosfs to create a FAT32 system (read the man page)
2006-07-31T05:53:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser	soundray	thank you for your help
2006-07-31T05:54:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	I think it will set the filesystem type, but not actually create the filesystem.
2006-07-31T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	is it mounted?
2006-07-31T06:03:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser	soundray	i used the mkdosfs to create the fat32 partition but now it says it cant read the drive
2006-07-31T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	what's the device name?
2006-07-31T06:06:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	what did you use as the mkdosfs command line?
2006-07-31T06:07:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	did that run without errors?
2006-07-31T06:09:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	that doesn't make sense. You either did "mkdosfd /dev/hdc" without the "1", or you haven't finalized the partitioning in gparted properly.
2006-07-31T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	you've ruined the work you've done with gparted now. Go back to partitioning. Try doing everything with gparted -- it should work (contrary to what I said earlier)
2006-07-31T06:11:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	what error?
2006-07-31T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	okay, let's try differently. Run 'fdisk /dev/hdc' and hit 'p' return. Does it show a partition table?
2006-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	soundray	NewUbuntuUser	can you join #ubuntu-classroom with me please
