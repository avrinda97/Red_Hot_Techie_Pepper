2009-09-07T09:17:00.000Z	biggleswirth		periodically, ubuntu server connection drops on local network, any ideas? I have to bring down et1 the bring it back up again to restore the connection, but this is pretty inconvenient
2009-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	any clues in /var/log/messages?
2009-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	checking...
2009-09-07T09:21:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	every 20 minutes, there is output as "--MARK--", 7 entries. only other output is system restart
2009-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	in /var/log/messages I mean
2009-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	the --mark-- marks are there to let you know that the machine is still running (at least on the whole).
2009-09-07T09:23:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	ok, I think this started when I installed bind9 to try to set up local dns. I uninstalled bind9 earlier and restarted the system, but the connection drop still happened...
2009-09-07T09:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	when you say the connection drops, what do you mean?
2009-09-07T09:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	can you ping the server?>
2009-09-07T09:25:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	i can't ping it from other machines on the network, though the ip address for the server still shows as reserved in the DHCP table of my router
2009-09-07T09:26:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	also, ifconfig on the server still shows the correct ip address on eth1, as leased from the router
2009-09-07T09:27:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	are you able to ping the router from the server?
2009-09-07T09:28:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	haven't tried that, I will have to wait for the issue to happen again in order to test that unfortunately
2009-09-07T09:29:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	I am not sure what triggers the problem
2009-09-07T09:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	unfortunately, I'm going to have to close down now.  My eyes are starting to close on their own.
2009-09-07T09:30:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	ok, no problem, you've given me some ideas. thanks for your help :)
2009-09-07T09:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	biggleswirth	You may wish to look at your /var/log/dmesg while you're poking around.
2009-09-07T09:31:00.000Z	biggleswirth	dsnyders	ok, will do, thanks
