2007-04-27T12:49:00.000Z	wintermute		Damn google, all it gives me is forum topics where people can
2007-04-27T12:50:00.000Z	wintermute		not see the resolution they want !
2007-04-27T12:50:00.000Z	wintermute		I CAN see mine... just doesn't work...
2007-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	wintermute		LOL sorry, I'm actually not used to this little keyboard and my long pinky keep touching the enter key
2007-04-27T12:52:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	I have NO problem at all with wireless
2007-04-27T12:52:00.000Z	wintermute	magnetron	Nice for you mate! Took me a while to get mine working!
2007-04-27T12:53:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	yes, you. go on, ask your question
2007-04-27T12:54:00.000Z	wintermute	magnetron	I have asked... waiting for answers. Maybe someone knows how to fix it!
2007-04-27T12:55:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	you said that your resolution "doesn't work". please be more specific
2007-04-27T12:58:00.000Z	wintermute	magnetron	Well the best way to describe it is when I change to 1200x800 it is like one virtual desktop is on top of the other, and when I start moving the mouse around the pointer gets corrupted (turns into a big square)...
2007-04-27T12:58:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	what graphics card? do you use beryl?
2007-04-27T13:01:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	do you use desktop effects? what graphics driver do you use?
2007-04-27T13:02:00.000Z	wintermute	magnetron	no desktop effects, I have just installed Ubuntu. Drivers are the default ones. xorg.conf lists my video card correctly...
2007-04-27T13:03:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	then i don't know. i have nvidia myself.
2007-04-27T13:05:00.000Z	wintermute	magnetron	thanks anyway man, any wild ideas on why? Should I try :( to get new drivers or something... OH something funny is that on xorg.conf there's no mention of 1200x1800 but on the GUI tool in gnome it does...
2007-04-27T13:06:00.000Z	magnetron	wintermute	maybe that is your problem.
2007-04-27T13:07:00.000Z	wintermute	magnetron	I know it smells fishy...
