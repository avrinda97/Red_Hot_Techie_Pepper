2012-05-30T21:50:00.000Z	monika		hi
2012-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	monika		my flash in opera not firefox isn't working on the system ... any ideas why not, how to debug it?
2012-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	monika		I'm running ubuntu 10.10
2012-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	monika		I tried reinstalling, aslo dowloading the .so from the adobe site directly, but none of the approaches work
2012-05-30T21:52:00.000Z	monika		so obviously I need a debug of somekind
2012-05-30T21:52:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	tried to uninstall and then reinstall it?
2012-05-30T21:52:00.000Z	monika	blackcatnekonegr	yeah that was one of the first things I tried
2012-05-30T21:53:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	what version of opera are you using?
2012-05-30T21:54:00.000Z	monika	blackcatnekonegr	11.62
2012-05-30T21:54:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	does not work at all or you get errors?
2012-05-30T21:55:00.000Z	monika	blackcatnekonegr	wawowe the  black region where the video should be is showing (there's isn't an error that the flash is missing), but no video nor audio
2012-05-30T21:56:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	it can be a missing package, a broken file or a problem with your video card, you said it works on firefox?
2012-05-30T21:56:00.000Z	monika	blackcatnekonegr	it doesn't work anywhere
2012-05-30T21:57:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	I bet is a problem with your video card, you will need to update your video card driver, had the same problem before, good luck, you will need it.
2012-05-30T21:59:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	try searching topics about your video card driver on linux and check the wiki, if there is a know issue, it will probably have it, make no mistake is your video card. let me guess NVIDIA?
2012-05-30T22:00:00.000Z	monika	blackcatnekonegr	no it's ATI
2012-05-30T22:01:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	try updating your video card driver on linux, on some cards generics cause that flash problem.
2012-05-30T22:03:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	monika	the best option is to use the proprietary driver ATI has for linux or ubuntu, if there is an ubuntu specific version use that one. I had  a similar problem with a different video card.
