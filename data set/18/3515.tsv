2010-03-11T14:01:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	OK, so the solution to my problems is basically what I am relegated to already: killing the app and restarting it whenever things start going syrupy?
2010-03-11T14:01:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Yeah :(
2011-12-03T22:15:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Most likely you can just type "handbrake" or "handbrake-gtk" in a terminal.
2011-12-03T22:15:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	Neither work
2011-12-03T22:15:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Huh... dpkg -L handbrake-gtk | grep bin/
2011-12-05T17:57:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	I think they don't include any by default. You can install GIMP or mtpaint or something like that though from the repos
2011-12-05T17:58:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	ok, nice
2012-01-15T21:49:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Wait, wait, wait. Are you running ntpdate as root? Because you're supposed to.
2012-01-15T21:49:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	I am
2012-01-15T21:50:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Oh, okay then, no idea, maybe something weird in the config
2012-01-15T21:51:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	I remember it was impossible to configure the time server connection on this pc even before it was running linx and only had Windows on it.
2012-01-15T21:52:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	That's odd, really... Probably something blocking the NTP port then indeed. Check your router config?
2012-01-15T21:53:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	You mean speak to the little box that sits between the pc and the modem?
2012-01-15T21:53:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Probably so, if you *have* a router. Try visiting http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 -- do you get anything on either of those?
2012-01-15T21:59:00.000Z	theadmin	meco	Probably so, if you *have* a router. Try visiting http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 -- do you get anything on either of those? For instance, I get this when I visit http://192.168.1.1 on my home network: http://i.imm.io/eEHe.png
2012-01-15T22:09:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	I'm not able to connect to any of those addresses.
2012-01-15T22:12:00.000Z	meco	theadmin	Can I take this to mean I do not have a router? Then that box is a switch (I'm not sure)?
