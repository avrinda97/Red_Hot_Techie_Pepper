2005-04-16T08:27:00.000Z	kkathman		ah ok
2005-04-16T08:27:00.000Z	kkathman		hehe
2005-04-16T08:27:00.000Z	whiskers	kkathman	gimpshop is not worth it....it is too complicated to use
2005-04-16T08:27:00.000Z	kkathman		whiskers im used to Photoshop and it isnt that hard for me
2005-04-16T08:28:00.000Z	whiskers	kkathman	hah...it is easier to just go download a picture than to draw one
2005-04-16T08:28:00.000Z	kkathman	whiskers	true that!
2005-04-16T08:29:00.000Z	whiskers		anyway gimpshop looks nice on ubuntu...but uh i don't know if anything really works
2005-04-16T08:29:00.000Z	whiskers		because i don't know how to use it
2005-04-16T08:29:00.000Z	whiskers		the only thing i use gimp for is to scan in pictures from cameras and pages from scanners and print them in beautiful color
2005-04-16T08:30:00.000Z	whiskers		that is all i know how to do with gimp
2005-04-16T08:32:00.000Z	kkathman	whiskers	 well, I use Photoshop extensively to do web graphics so, I need to have it..so I keep it on my WIn box for right now
2005-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	whiskers	kkathman	well if you can afford $700...go ahead...but not me
2005-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	whiskers		i don't need it
2005-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	whiskers		i just download stuff
2005-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	whiskers		since i have never seen photoshop i really can't say...but gimpshop is a little nice for a free program
2005-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	whiskers	kkathman	but if you can afford $700 for photoshop go ahead
2005-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	kkathman	whiskers	 well I have a good business, and its a necessary tool. But I cant afford ANOTHER 700 (I didnt pay 700 for it anyway)
2005-04-16T08:38:00.000Z	kkathman	whiskers	but I got this theory that if I use my win box for web graphics...thats a good use for it lol
