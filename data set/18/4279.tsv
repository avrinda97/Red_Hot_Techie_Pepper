2009-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	tonytraductor		if I install ubuntu over the PCLOS, I'm going to have to rewrite my /home and restore from backups, aren't I?
2009-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	tonytraductor		I mean, it won't just install / to the current PCLOS /, and use the current /home
2009-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	tonytraductor		without overwriting /home
2009-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	tonytraductor		cool
2009-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	tonytraductor		but it will overwrite relevant config files in /home when necessary, right?
2009-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	tonytraductor		DVD-R? why?
2009-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	tonytraductor		I have the whole /home backed up to a 320gb usb storage drive
2009-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	tonytraductor		okay
2009-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	tonytraductor		I think I
2009-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	tonytraductor		 m going to ditch PCLOS and come back to Ubuntu, now
2009-05-05T19:43:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	thats one of the reasons of using a /home partition. If you use that, you can install wathever distro you want without worrying about losing your data/config
2009-05-05T19:55:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	some of that things should not be missing. Most user dependent config are stored in $HOME
2009-05-05T19:56:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	just "ls -al ~" and you will see the "hidden" config files
2009-05-05T19:57:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	yeah
2009-05-05T20:05:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	if it is the only user in the computer then it should work
2009-05-05T20:34:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	or just sudo bash and then passwd
2009-05-05T20:44:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	yes, edit /etc/fstab
2009-05-05T20:46:00.000Z	[vali]	tonytraductor	it is easy to figure out how to modify your fstab looking at a previous one
