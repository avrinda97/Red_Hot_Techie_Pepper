2011-03-18T17:57:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	use "screen" to create a seperate screen
2011-03-18T17:57:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	to work with 2 terminals, etc
2011-03-18T17:58:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	the only hotkeys i can remember now is ctrl a+n and ctrl a+a
2011-03-18T18:01:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	screen is the command to open another screen in the console, and to switch between them
2011-03-18T18:01:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	screen --help
2011-03-18T18:01:00.000Z	airwork	ruan	screen is not installed
2011-03-18T18:02:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	install it
2011-03-18T18:02:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	came preinstalled for me though
2011-03-18T18:03:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	screen controls i remember
2011-03-18T18:04:00.000Z	ruan	airwork	ctrl a +Create, ctrl a +Next, ctrl a+bAck
2011-03-18T18:04:00.000Z	airwork	ruan	screen simply isn't installed and i can't install it unless i can both connect and run commands
2011-03-18T18:05:00.000Z	airwork	ruan	except that that would wait for wvdial to end before running sudo apt-get update
