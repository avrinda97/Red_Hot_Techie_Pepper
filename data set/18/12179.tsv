2006-05-16T16:17:00.000Z	jofo	gnomefreak	u lost me there, what is theown bug?
2006-05-16T16:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jofo	xubuntu is unusable/uninstallable atm there was an update for a lib that broke everything check back in here if im around ill let you know when its fixed
2006-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jofo	is that what you installed is xubuntu or ubuntu +xubuntu-desktop?
2006-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jofo	what does it say on login?
2006-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jofo	or do you get in than nothing works
2006-05-16T16:25:00.000Z	jofo	gnomefreak	no i have no user to chose
2006-05-16T16:25:00.000Z	jofo	gnomefreak	so i have to use the failsafe way...
2006-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jofo	when you get to xubuntu login page if you type your user name and user password what happens?
2006-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	jofo	gnomefreak	 thats the thing, ive never got to chose a user when i installed
2006-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	jofo	ok yes that is sounding like same issue (atleast that could be caused by the same library) here are a feww choices  1. you can download burn install ubuntu 2. you can wait for a fix for xubuntu <not sure how long atm but i would think within a week> or you can go to ctrl+alt+f2 and when you get to tty2 type what soundray gave you than install ubuntu-desktop and use gnome until fixed
