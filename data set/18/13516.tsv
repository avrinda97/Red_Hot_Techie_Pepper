2005-11-09T13:04:00.000Z	smi|e		hi apokryphos
2005-11-09T13:05:00.000Z	Taa5i|lunch	smi|e	I could use some help.  I wish to install colortail, but apt-get says it has no installation candidate, despite it showing up in the apt-get install tab-completed list.  How might I resolve this, please?
2005-11-09T13:05:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	have you updated your sources.list?
2005-11-09T13:06:00.000Z	Taa5i|lunch	smi|e	I just ran apt-get update a few moments ago, in fact.  I have universe main multiverse and restricted set in sources.list
2005-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	You on Breezy?
2005-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	Taa5i|lunch	smi|e	I am.  Fresh install a couple days ago.
2005-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	ok
2005-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	let me deal with musik
2005-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	give me 5 mins
2005-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	Taa5i|lunch	smi|e	Certainly, thank you.
2005-11-09T13:09:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	ok whatsup?
2005-11-09T13:09:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	what did you want?
2005-11-09T13:10:00.000Z	Taa5i|lunch	smi|e	I don't quite understand apt, I guess.  Hitting tab in apt-get install foo shows a list of things matching foo, but some of them don't actually exist it appears [eg colortail] 
2005-11-09T13:10:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	use synaptic
2005-11-09T13:11:00.000Z	Taa5i|lunch	smi|e	Thank you, I'll look at that.
2005-11-09T13:11:00.000Z	smi|e	Taa5i|lunch	Your more than welcome ;)
