2011-04-18T03:30:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	md5sum the CD
2011-04-18T03:50:00.000Z	Knuxgen	pfifo	/ IdleOne: md5sum is ok
2011-04-18T03:51:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	what kind of reader are you using?
2011-04-18T03:51:00.000Z	Knuxgen	pfifo	 tried winMd5Sum
2011-04-18T03:52:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	no your hardware, what did you use to read the cd?
2011-04-18T03:53:00.000Z	Knuxgen	pfifo	a dvd rom, or do you mean exactly the type of it?
2011-04-18T03:54:00.000Z	Knuxgen	pfifo	TSSTcorp CDDVDW SH-S223C ATA Device
2011-04-18T03:54:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	I just want to know if thre is anything special about it. Is it just a plain jane reader hooked up to an pata or sata port?
2011-04-18T03:57:00.000Z	Knuxgen	pfifo	yep, simple dvd burner device
2011-04-18T03:58:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	Its probabaly a broken CD then, try burning at a slower speed
2011-04-18T03:59:00.000Z	Knuxgen	pfifo	im running the iso now on win7 with virtual clone drive, but that would give me only wubi install, right?
2011-04-18T03:59:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	yeah, and I have never done that myself
2011-04-18T04:06:00.000Z	pfifo	Knuxgen	are you at that prompt now? (initramfs)
