2010-10-30T20:27:00.000Z	TheCommieDuck		Hi, I'm a total newbie to ubuntu. But I'm trying to migrate to it from Windows. Question:
2010-10-30T20:29:00.000Z	TheCommieDuck		From the small amount of messing I've previously done, I can't seem to have an 'absolute' path to any of my existing files, all of them being in D:, E:, etc. drives rather than the standard (I think) /usr/ directory. I can disk mount them, but...um...
2010-10-30T20:29:00.000Z	TheCommieDuck		Is this to be expected, since I'll have to continually run both OSes on this PC?
2010-10-30T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	   You can mount your windows 'D' drive to /media/D/ if you wanted to...
2010-10-30T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 Filesystemns are normnally mouynted to /media/SOMNTHING/   not /usr/stuff
2010-10-30T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 time to read up on some linux basics i think.    linux dosent use Drive letters.. a drive gets 'mounted' to a setable locatuion so it appears the same as a directory.
2010-10-30T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 I have my windows drives mounted to /media/WindowsBoot and /media/WindowsData and so forth.
2010-10-30T20:35:00.000Z	TheCommieDuck	Dr_Willis	I knew the first part, and I think the second part is what I was meaning.
2010-10-30T20:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 you can use the ntfs-config tool to automate the setup of mountpoints for your windows drives. Its a little flakey. but it works decently well for me.
2010-10-30T20:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 Its worth reading up on how mount points work. and how ntfs-3g works. :)
2010-10-30T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 i hate WUBI... :)
2010-10-30T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 i suggest a normal install.. or running in virtualbox to 'test' linux out.
2010-10-30T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 the installer can resize windows parttions for you
2010-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 personally I keep windows and linux on their own Hard drives.
2010-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	TheCommieDuck	Dr_Willis	I'm taking your use of hard drives is going to be physical drives, not the windows lettered ones? :P
2010-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 letters are not 'hard drives'  those are partitions..
2010-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheCommieDuck	 MS has trained people poorly.
2010-10-30T20:43:00.000Z	TheCommieDuck	Dr_Willis	Sorry. Something I'm hoping to gain from the move is greater knowledge of this stuff.
