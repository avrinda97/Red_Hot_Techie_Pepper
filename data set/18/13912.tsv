2006-05-16T06:00:00.000Z	yonatan		hi there, I've just scanned an image using xsane and it saved the fiel as a .pnm ... what do I use to view/edit it now?
2006-05-16T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	gimp, gqview, eog,...
2006-05-16T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	also, install netpbm for conversion tools.
2006-05-16T06:01:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	gimp doesn't like it, not tried the others
2006-05-16T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	gimp opens pnm files usually. Maybe it's faulty.
2006-05-16T06:02:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	done 5 or 6 different files, it won't open any of them... could it be that xsane didn't save the files right?
2006-05-16T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	it's possible, but too early to conclude, since you haven't tried any viewers yet.
2006-05-16T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	you could also try sane from within gimp. (File - Acquire I think)
2006-05-16T06:03:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	well, the pnms kill eog... trying gqview
2006-05-16T06:04:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	that last one would only work if I still had the source... :( gqview doesn't work either.
2006-05-16T06:04:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	try pnmfile from netpbm for info about your file
2006-05-16T06:05:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	will try netpbm next
2006-05-16T06:07:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	output from "pnmfile Desktop/tartan\ photos+/tartanscan0001.pnm" = Desktop/tartan photos+/tartanscan0001.pnm:      PPM raw, 849 by 1159  maxval 65535
2006-05-16T06:09:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	that's good. Try pnmtopng tartanscan0001.pnm >tartanscan0001.png and open the png
2006-05-16T06:10:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	sweet! is it the same syntax if I want to use pnmtotiff? ie pnmtotiff tartanscan0001.pnm >tartanscan0001.tiff
2006-05-16T06:11:00.000Z	soundray	yonatan	man pnmtotiff if in doubt.
2006-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	hmm.... it's got a colourmap problem now as well - there's too many colours apparently, but that's ok, the tiff seems fine.
2006-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	yonatan	soundray	cool, cheers mate! ciao all!
