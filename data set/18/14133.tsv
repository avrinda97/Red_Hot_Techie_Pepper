2005-09-15T06:41:00.000Z	natecull		I'm trying to install the spca5xx webcam driver for a Logitec Quickcam IM
2005-09-15T06:41:00.000Z	natecull		unfortunately the instructions even on the Ubuntu forums seem to contradict themselves
2005-09-15T06:41:00.000Z	natecull		has anyone here done this?
2005-09-15T06:42:00.000Z	natecull		I *think* I have succeeded in compiling the module. That is, I have got to a point where I can run 'make' and it produces a spca5xx.ko file which may or may not be usable
2005-09-15T06:42:00.000Z	natecull		when I try to insmod the module, I get 'invalid symbol in module'. Would this suggest that I have a bad module, or that I need (#random-other-stuff) loaded first?
2005-09-15T06:44:00.000Z	natecull		I hear this driver is going to be included in the Breezy kernel, which will be great
2005-09-15T06:44:00.000Z	natecull		it will be nice to have GnomeMeeting working out of the box
2005-09-15T06:45:00.000Z	natecull		mind you, now I need to test the sucker...
2005-09-15T06:45:00.000Z	GNU-GPL	natecull	it does work out of the box
2005-09-15T06:48:00.000Z	natecull	GNU-GPL	GnomeMeeting may work out of the box, but without a driver for a webcam it doesn't get very far for videoconferencing.
2005-09-15T06:48:00.000Z	GNU-GPL	natecull	that has nothing to do with gnomemeeting
2005-09-15T06:51:00.000Z	natecull	GNU-GPL	Sure it does. How exactly can you consider GnomeMeeting to be 'working' if it doesn't actually work?
2005-09-15T06:51:00.000Z	natecull	GNU-GPL	ie, if you can't use it to accomplish the task for which it was designed
2005-09-15T06:52:00.000Z	GNU-GPL	natecull	it works.. only not video.. (this is because you haven't installed the driver, or right driver for the cam) the driver is systemwide (all apps can use this if needed too)
2005-09-15T06:53:00.000Z	natecull	GNU-GPL	I am quite aware of that. The upshot, however, is that videoconferencing in Linux does not work unless you sweat blood and sacrifice a pig. This is not what I call 'working out of the box', hence why I say it will be nice if the next Ubuntu actually supports popular webcams.
2005-09-15T06:55:00.000Z	GNU-GPL	natecull	but to be clear.. it's not the package fault (gnomemeeting) but the lack of drivers on linux for these devices (and thoreauputic gave you the most common reason for it)
2005-09-15T06:56:00.000Z	natecull	GNU-GPL	Yes, but can you understand that as an end user, that answer doesn't satisfy. I don't care who's 'fault' it is - I just want a fully working experience.
2005-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	GNU-GPL	natecull	from that point, you're right
