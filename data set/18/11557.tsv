2006-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	Heretician		cable
2006-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	Heretician		oh ..
2006-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	Heretician		well then i cant find a guide on how to get my internet working
2006-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	Heretician		from what ive gathered from the wiki, i need PPPoE :P
2006-07-15T08:49:00.000Z	Heretician		Its not.
2006-07-15T08:49:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	just plug the cable in and you're on the net
2006-07-15T09:17:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	does your network card LED is blinking or not?
2006-07-15T09:21:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	sudo dhclient eth0 (basically the same as "sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0"
2006-07-15T09:22:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	i'll be here for a while 
2006-07-15T09:37:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	it looked fine. something is not right.
2006-07-15T09:38:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	ifconfig shows you two devices - eth0 and lo, correct?
2006-07-15T09:39:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	net drivers are installed by default unless there are special ones
2006-07-15T09:40:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	ok. sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0 does NOT do the trick (it should!)
2006-07-15T10:12:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	does this file, resolv.conf, exists in /etc ??
2006-07-15T10:13:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	ls /etc - it'll give you the list of files
2006-07-15T10:30:00.000Z	Heretician	IcemanV9	resolve.conf is in /etc
2006-07-15T10:31:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Heretician	ok. it SHOULD work. *sigh*
