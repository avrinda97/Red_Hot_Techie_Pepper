2009-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	gaelfx		I think what I need to find is the preference file regarding which windowing method to use and try to change it back to classic
2009-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	you mean like metacity --replace ?
2009-06-16T08:38:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	what will that do?
2009-06-16T08:39:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	metacity is the default window decorator for gnome
2009-06-16T08:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	ok, thanks, I'll give it a go
2009-06-16T08:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	well, I created a launcher on the desktop and put 'metacity --replace' as the command, but when I run it, nothing seems to change
2009-06-16T08:42:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	you're probably using metacity already.. what are your original troubles?
2009-06-16T08:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	well, when I startup, I only get desktop, no panels or UNR nav windows, so I basically can only use the computer by creating launchers on the desktop, which is kind of a pain
2009-06-16T08:44:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	gnome-panel in a terminal
2009-06-16T08:45:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	you could create a new user and see if the problems persist. if not you've got a configuration issue with your current account
2009-06-16T08:47:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	gnome-panel did it :D
2009-06-16T08:48:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	thanks loads man
2009-06-16T08:48:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	yeah. more than likely you've deleted them.. good luck
2009-06-16T08:49:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	if on  a reboot they are gone again you can add gnome-panel to sessions
2009-06-16T08:50:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	I just switched it back to UNR window mode, I think the problem is UNR doesn't have gnome-panel in startup, and changing to classic mode doesn't add it
2009-06-16T08:50:00.000Z	gaelfx	bastidrazor	perhaps a bug?
2009-06-16T08:52:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gaelfx	i'm seeing similiar complaints on the forums. look at  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1136323
