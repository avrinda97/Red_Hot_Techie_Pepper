2007-06-29T14:02:00.000Z	bipolar		I've got a problem installing Feisty on a new AMD64 box and it's stumping me. I was able to boot the live cd if I use the noapic kernel option, but now that it's installed, it hangs at "Reading files needed to boot...".
2007-06-29T14:02:00.000Z	bipolar		I can't get any further then that
2007-06-29T14:02:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	you got the 64-bit version?
2007-06-29T14:04:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	no. the 32 bit one
2007-06-29T14:11:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	no ideas?
2007-06-29T14:12:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	Not really ... I have just recently installed Ubuntu Server on a 8-CPU Opteron machine and so I assume that it should work under normal circumstances. Maybe your CD drive doesn't like the media you burnt your ISO on to?
2007-06-29T14:13:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	well, thats the thing. I was able to get it to install. this issue is with booting off the hard drive
2007-06-29T14:13:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	oh, the hard drive?
2007-06-29T14:14:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	right. it's installed. this is booting from hd. In the recovery mode kernel I see it boot until it just stops at "Reading files needed for boot"
2007-06-29T14:15:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	sounds like something got messed up ...
2007-06-29T14:15:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	how soon after the boot does this happen?
2007-06-29T14:16:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	a bit into it. it's not imediate
2007-06-29T14:16:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	but it's consistant. it boots to that point and stops
2007-06-29T14:25:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	I'm reinstalling, this time from a gutsy tribe 2 amd64 disk. so far I had to use noacpi to get the install disk to boot.
2007-06-29T14:25:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	what system is that BTW?
2007-06-29T14:25:00.000Z	scorp123	bipolar	any specific brand?
2007-06-29T14:46:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	Gutsy amd64 boots
2007-06-29T14:47:00.000Z	bipolar	scorp123	I'm going to download the 32bit version of gutsy and see if that works.
