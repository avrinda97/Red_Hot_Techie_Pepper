2007-06-16T16:33:00.000Z	r4ge	LunatikBunnie	it sounds like grub isnt installed or misconfigured
2007-06-16T16:36:00.000Z	r4ge	LunatikBunnie	what drive did you load grub onto?
2007-06-16T16:38:00.000Z	LunatikBunnie	r4ge	: i did that.
2007-06-16T16:39:00.000Z	r4ge	LunatikBunnie	it is possible to mount ubuntu from the livecd and load in grub
2007-06-16T16:43:00.000Z	r4ge	LunatikBunnie	get the alternative installer
2007-06-16T16:43:00.000Z	r4ge	LunatikBunnie	yup.
2007-06-16T16:44:00.000Z	r4ge	LunatikBunnie	its slightly harder to use, but you will learn more and the more you know the easier linux will become.
