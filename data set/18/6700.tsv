2008-04-27T00:58:00.000Z	albuntu		hello. i have 20 upgradable in adept manager after upgrading from gutsy to hardy and when i do full upgrade it doesnt do anything and "apply changes" remains inactive
2008-04-27T00:58:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	try $sudo apt-get -f install
2008-04-27T00:59:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 20 not upgraded.
2008-04-27T01:00:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: try update-manager from command line, and give me any unusual output
2008-04-27T01:01:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	current dist not found in meta-release file
2008-04-27T01:01:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: look online for a /etc/X11/xorg.conf normal file for hardy, and reinstall that. Also check that Hardy Heron was actually installed
2008-04-27T01:02:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	what i did was an upgrade from the adept_manager from gutsy to hardy so i am sure hardy is installed
2008-04-27T01:03:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: when you boot up and go into grub does it say 8.04? press system -> about and tell me if it says 8.04, just to check to make sure the install went correctly
2008-04-27T01:03:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: go to this in your firefox. Does it say 8.04? file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html
2008-04-27T01:04:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	yes. in firefox and in grub too. it says 8.04 in both of them
2008-04-27T01:04:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: ok, what does apt-get upgrade say?
2008-04-27T01:05:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: that is in command line, so it should look like name@host$sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-04-27T01:05:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	it says
2008-04-27T01:05:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	and it gives me the 20 packages
2008-04-27T01:06:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: how important are these packages? if they are not important, remove then install them.
2008-04-27T01:06:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	they are not so important so no problem but that was just strange you know :). thanks
2008-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	chrisinator	albuntu	: no problem. Reinstalling in synaptic would do the same thing. It is probobly a unsatisfied dependency.
2008-04-27T01:08:00.000Z	albuntu	chrisinator	another question please. after the upgrade to hardy i lost my wireless connectivity. i have a intel 3945abg. no propietary drivers showing although
