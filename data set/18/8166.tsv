2007-09-29T12:06:00.000Z	bazhang		I suspect that it's just a bad burn, Stephen; I can't tell you how many coasters I created burning ISOs..
2007-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	bazhang		if it's not installed then you can do so.

2007-09-29T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang		well K3b is the program that allows for you to burn ISO files, alternately, you can right click on the ISO file, and it says open with cd burner, or some such.
2007-09-29T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang		then it will burn the ISO for you automatically.
2007-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	bazhang		Just have to be patient, you can and will get it done.
