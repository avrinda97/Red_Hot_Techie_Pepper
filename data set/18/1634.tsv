2011-01-04T11:04:00.000Z	leomast247	soreau	how do i do all that
2011-01-04T11:05:00.000Z	soreau	leomast247	sudo apt-get install mesa-utils && glxinfo|grep renderer  <-- then paste the very last line of output here
2011-01-04T11:07:00.000Z	leomast247	soreau	last line of output as in what?
2011-01-04T11:07:00.000Z	soreau	leomast247	That is the complete command. Run it in your terminal and grab the last line
2011-01-04T11:08:00.000Z	leomast247	soreau	at the end it says    OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI R300 (RS400 5955) 20090101 x86/MMX+/3DNow!+/SSE2 NO-TCL DRI2
2011-01-04T11:09:00.000Z	soreau	leomast247	That means your drivers are working correctly. Is there some problem you are having?
2011-01-04T11:11:00.000Z	soreau	leomast247	If you want to try the latest drivers with gallium to get better 3D, you can install xorg-edgers repo. Which version of ubuntu are you using?
2011-01-04T11:13:00.000Z	soreau	leomast247	Run this to get the latest driver bits, then reboot: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-01-04T11:16:00.000Z	soreau	leomast247	If everything goes ok, glxinfo|grep renderer should report Gallium
