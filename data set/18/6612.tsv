2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	ais523	Pusselgenerator	it's nothing to do with the servers in my case
2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	ais523		because it happened well after everything was downloaded
2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	Pusselgenerator	ais523	Do you get any errors?
2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	ais523	Pusselgenerator	I had lots of errors about libstdc++ and gcc version earlier
2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	ais523		can't remember the exact text
2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	ais523		now, the window's just gone blank
2008-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	Pusselgenerator		asi523: Oh.. Well, I'm quite new to ubuntu (been around since 7.04) so.. I can't really answer that :/
2008-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	ais523		could someone here tell me how to mount a USB stick when the automounter isn't working?
2008-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	ais523		that way at least I can back up /home and restart
2008-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	Pusselgenerator	ais523	I usually use "Storage Device Manager", it's in Add/Remove applications
2008-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	ais523	Pusselgenerator	I'm in the middle of a dist upgrade here
2008-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	ais523		so I need to do things by hand
2008-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	ais523		can't install or uninstall software
2008-04-25T00:02:00.000Z	ais523		and the automounter has been stopped
2008-04-25T00:03:00.000Z	Pusselgenerator	ais523	Oh... That makes it more difficult.. I do not know how to do it by the terminal, but try "man mount" and see if you get any smarter :/
2008-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	ais523	Pusselgenerator	I figured it eventually, it's mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
2008-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	ais523	Pusselgenerator	however, man wasn't working for me, I figured it using mount --help
2008-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	Pusselgenerator	ais523	Ah, there you have it! Nice work ;)
