2010-05-13T06:34:00.000Z	xenon401		Whoa!
2010-05-13T06:35:00.000Z	xenon401		Ubuntu is amazing!
2010-05-13T06:37:00.000Z	xenon401		What do you users recommend? I am deciding on 'Virus Scanner' or 'KlamAV'?
2010-05-13T06:38:00.000Z	xenon401		I know...I just want to be "more" secured.
2010-05-13T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 what one is 'virus scanner' ? I know of ClamAV and AVG has an AV for linux also.
2010-05-13T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 Most of the AV programs in linux just scan when yu tell them to. they dont work like they do in windows
2010-05-13T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 yoy may want to start using Synaptic to install/search - the Add/remove is a little dumbed down.
2010-05-13T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 its 'ubuntu software center here' :) what release are you using?
2010-05-13T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 its made by a major av company. so i dont see why not.
2010-05-13T06:41:00.000Z	xenon401	Dr_Willis	sorry, I am so used to 9.04 . I just switched about 2 weeks ago to 10.04
2010-05-13T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 you do realize most all these AV apps are just for scanning for windows viruses for the most part?
2010-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 the first hit for 'antiv' in the software center is a HTTP Anti Vuris Proxy.
2010-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	xenon401	Dr_Willis	"virus"
2010-05-13T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 the software center tells the 'actual' name of the package below the short descrition.
2010-05-13T06:43:00.000Z	xenon401	Dr_Willis	yes...
2010-05-13T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 if you never use the tools Then they dont do miuch good.  Theres 'secure' then therese 'paranoid' then theres 'tinfoil hat paranoid'
2010-05-13T06:49:00.000Z	xenon401	Dr_Willis	How long have you been running Ubuntu?
2010-05-13T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xenon401	 several years
