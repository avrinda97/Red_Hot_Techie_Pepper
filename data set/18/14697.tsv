2005-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	bob2	kong0	please don't ignore people helping you, two seperate people have told you how to fix it
2005-06-27T07:26:00.000Z	bob2	kong0	if you don't stop being so obnoxious, you will be removed
2005-06-27T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	kong0	maybe you should try #ubuntu-se if you have such trouble understanding the help here
2005-06-27T08:12:00.000Z	bob2	kong0	that file explains exactly how to edit it
2005-06-27T08:17:00.000Z	bob2	kong0	no, you need to get a better attitude.  3 people pointed you at the wiki before you actually read it, and all the while you claimed no one was helping you
2005-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	bob2	kong0	you're not even making sense now, please just drop it
