2009-07-10T07:14:00.000Z	dragonlotus		does anyone know how to remove an encrypted volume created using the ubuntu 8.10 alternate cd?
2009-07-10T07:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	You created an LVM + Encryption system?
2009-07-10T07:15:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	yes, I'm still in the installer too
2009-07-10T07:15:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	Nice.  What's the question?
2009-07-10T07:15:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	I configured the encrypted volume and now I want to remove it and set it up differently.
2009-07-10T07:15:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	I gave it all the space and I didn't leave any non-encrypted for windows xp
2009-07-10T07:16:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	and now I can't delete the physical volume because it's inuse by the encrypted volume which I also can't seem to remove completely.
2009-07-10T07:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	If you're using alternative disc, it's a little complicated because of the interaction between the user and the menu.  It's menu-driven so some things will appear as if you're doing nothing and other things, you'll be able to change.  You need to destroy the partition and create a new (smaller) partition.
2009-07-10T07:19:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	how to destroy the encrypted volume so I can destroy the physical volume?
2009-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	You already have Windows XP partition installed?
2009-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	nope.  That would be nice :)  I currently have no operating system installed
2009-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	Just make a new partition over everything.
2009-07-10T07:21:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	Or just a small partition (with room for XP).
2009-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	the problem is I can't delete the partition I have
2009-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	Why not?  You want to keep certain files?
2009-07-10T07:25:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	no it says I can't modify the volume because it is in use by the encrypted volume
2009-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	dragonlotus	mobi-sheep	I found that aborting the installer and restarting allowed me to modify what I wanted.
2009-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	dragonlotus	Ahh.  Good.
