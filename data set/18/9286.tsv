2008-08-04T00:19:00.000Z	JC_Denton_		Ever since adding a sata drive to my machine ubuntu keeps freezing, even if I run a fresh install of the sata drive
2008-08-04T00:20:00.000Z	Shujah	JC_Denton_	I think you are adding SATA as the first bootable device
2008-08-04T00:20:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	I did but atm it is not
2008-08-04T00:21:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	is there a problem w/ setting it as the first bootable device?
2008-08-04T00:22:00.000Z	Shujah	JC_Denton_	if you add IDE or SATA as the first bootable device the enteries in Ubuntu identifying /boot etc become ineffective since they are identified via hard drive no e.g. 0 or 1
2008-08-04T00:23:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	so how would I fix it? set the drive order manually
2008-08-04T00:25:00.000Z	Shujah	JC_Denton_	I'll assume you have installed Ubuntu on first hd which would make it hd0, once you attach the SATA drive open Bios go to boot priority and make the first hd on which ubuntu is installed the first bootable device
2008-08-04T00:25:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	it is set up that way currently, to boot off the old drive but the freezing persists
2008-08-04T00:26:00.000Z	Shujah	JC_Denton_	both drives are sata? and once you remove sata the system boots as usual?
2008-08-04T00:27:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	the drive ubuntu is currently booting off is an ide drive
2008-08-04T00:28:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	I could remove the sata drive now and it wld boot fine. It would probably stop the freezing too. I did try installing ubuntu on the sata drive and setting that as the first drive to boot from but that install kept freezing too
2008-08-04T00:29:00.000Z	Shujah	JC_Denton_	are you sure SATA is being recognized? you might need a bios update.
2008-08-04T00:30:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	I'm not sure what you mean by that seeing it boots of the sata drive ok. The machine came shipped with a sata drive but initially I ran it off my old ata drive from my old computer

2008-08-04T00:31:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	will do thanks
2008-08-04T00:32:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	his problem seems to be a little differnt though - the bios not even supporting his sata drive. This drive came shipped with the machine...
2008-08-04T00:32:00.000Z	Shujah	JC_Denton_	if you remove ide and install ubuntu does the problem still persists?
2008-08-04T00:33:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Shujah	don't know. I will try tomorrow.
