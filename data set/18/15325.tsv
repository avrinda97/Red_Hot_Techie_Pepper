2005-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	dave		i would prefer they said "TO ALLOW USERS TO ACCESS DRIVES:  -u" or whatever
2005-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	dave		or even have both. because this is horribly frustrating. at least provide a search command from within the man program
2005-08-30T15:16:00.000Z	dave		dont get me started on spyware
2005-08-30T15:16:00.000Z	dave		if i'm the only one in the world who hasn't been infected with spyware or a virus in over half a year, i must be a damn proficient user
2005-08-30T15:16:00.000Z	dave		of windows^
2005-08-30T15:16:00.000Z	dave		that's interesting, thanks.
2005-08-30T15:17:00.000Z	dave		are there any good alternative GUIs for linux?
2005-08-30T15:17:00.000Z	dave		gnome is a pile of crap.
2005-08-30T15:18:00.000Z	dave		you dont have to flame anything. it is my humble opinion that gnome is unworkable.
2005-08-30T15:18:00.000Z	dave		namely because of the focus problems
2005-08-30T15:18:00.000Z	selinium	dave	As do i
2005-08-30T15:20:00.000Z	selinium	dave	in gnome I use the workspace switcher and keep seperate workspaces for different applications
2005-08-30T15:21:00.000Z	selinium	dave	have you used the workspace switcher?
2005-08-30T15:23:00.000Z	selinium	dave	have you used the switcher?
2005-08-30T15:23:00.000Z	dave	selinium	i've tried it, ic an't get used to it.
2005-08-30T15:25:00.000Z	selinium	dave	you can drag apps of the desktop onto a workspace, or right click the topbar of an xwindow. Then you can click on each workspace when you need it. I found this sooo much better than windows.
2005-08-30T15:25:00.000Z	dave	selinium	well, i have mastered the windows interface, it works for me
2005-08-30T15:26:00.000Z	selinium	dave	I used to get one page filled up very quickly. This is why you drag it off the screen, with workspaces I can have many screens so no need to drag them out of sight.
