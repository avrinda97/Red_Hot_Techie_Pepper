2006-11-14T17:51:00.000Z	ailean		how do i get access to the source code, change it, and resubmit it for approval?
2006-11-14T17:52:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	to get the source code, "apt-get source <packagename>". to change it, well, just change it. to build it, look at dpkg-buildpackage. as for submitting it, perhaps ask in #ubuntu-motu
2006-11-14T17:52:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	i.e. on my computer
2006-11-14T17:52:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	in the directory you type that apt-get command in
2006-11-14T17:53:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	great, thanks
2006-12-12T09:58:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	i have no idea. i poked him, and he didn't give an explanation, so...
2006-12-24T10:14:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	wasn't that a reasonable q? Expecting windows progs to work on ubuntu is like trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver.
2006-12-24T10:15:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	which?
2006-12-24T10:16:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	never mind :)
2007-11-02T04:24:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	that's not necessarily a bad thing.
2007-11-02T04:24:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	why so?
2007-11-02T04:25:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	because there are a few programs that can't run on 64bit. i think probably most of the people who have a 64bit processor are really using 32bit Ubuntu
2007-11-02T04:26:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	right, but surely the system would run faster using the correct kernel for its architecture?
2007-11-02T04:27:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	marginally sol
2007-11-02T04:28:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	so i'll keep it as it is for now.  but just for my information, an AMD turion 64 x2 technically should be using the 64-bit version, yeah?
2007-11-02T04:29:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	it "can".
2007-11-02T04:30:00.000Z	ailean	LjL	ok, i take your point.  Thanks for the advice LjL :)
2007-11-02T04:30:00.000Z	LjL	ailean	any 64 bit processor can use the 32 bit version - the vice versa is not true. yours is a 64 bit processor
