2006-06-29T08:54:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	ali	seems Unreal relys on the SDL library to work, under Ubuntu you should try to install it
2006-06-29T08:55:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	ali	Use the advanced install manager or in a terminal try: sudo apt-get install libsdl
2006-06-29T08:59:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	ali	... did you add some supplementary sources or do you just use the normal sources wich came standard for a clean ubuntu install?
2006-06-29T09:01:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	ali	so you didn't added other sources?
2006-06-29T09:03:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	ali	other sources that aren't supported ufficially by ubuntu...
2006-06-29T09:05:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	ali	ok... I'll presume you didn't add other sources than the standard, hold on a sec...
