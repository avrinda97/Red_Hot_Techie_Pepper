2007-09-08T06:49:00.000Z	sasimon19		#partitions
2007-09-08T06:50:00.000Z	sasimon19		Its been a while since I've irc'd
2007-09-08T06:50:00.000Z	sasimon19		how do I change room?
2007-09-08T06:51:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	 /join #channelname
2007-09-08T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	any point to this ?
2007-09-08T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	try performing a windows repair install for xp , should retain your data
2007-09-08T06:55:00.000Z	sasimon19	Pelo	not if it's not the xp partition
2007-09-08T06:56:00.000Z	sasimon19	Pelo	it's on a different hard drive than xp OS and in xp it wont do anything but reformat
2007-09-08T06:56:00.000Z	sasimon19	Pelo	NTFS
2007-09-08T06:57:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	I agree with winbond  I also think that your issue would be better handled by  ##windows
2007-09-08T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	 what does supergrub have to do with a storage partiton ?
2007-09-08T06:59:00.000Z	sasimon19	Pelo	I used it to replace the mbr after vista skrewed it up (I knew the problem was coming)
2007-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	sasimon19	Pelo	but then I skrewed up when I installed a partition
2007-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	sasimon19	Pelo	not partition... a boot thing to a partition
2007-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	i still think ppl in ##windows would be better equiped to tell you how to recover a ntfs partition
2007-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	sasimon19	 I thought the problem was that you coudln't mount it to recover the data
