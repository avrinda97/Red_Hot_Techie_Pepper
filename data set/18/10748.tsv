2009-08-27T09:44:00.000Z	esaym		what will happen if I installed the libc6 from jaunty into intrepid?
2009-08-27T09:44:00.000Z	esaym		I had to update to the mdadm in jaunty
2009-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	esaym		because the mdadm in intrepid is broken
2009-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	aptitude -s install that_package and see what changes
2009-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	esaym	slacker_nl	well it is already installed...
2009-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	but like said it might break something
2009-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	it also forces an update when there is an higher version
2009-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	apt-cache policy $pkg
2009-08-27T09:46:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	you do have the jaunty repo already enabled in your sources.list?
2009-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	esaym	slacker_nl	yes but I changed it back already
2009-08-27T09:50:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	if you enable it, run an update and do apt-cache policy you can see the candidate, and simulate the install action, it will show you what will be upgraded..
2009-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	esaym	slacker_nl	It has already been installed.  I had to install mdadm and udev from jaunty so that I could assemble by broken raid5 array.  The mdadm in intrepid seg faults with assembling broken arrays... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdadm/+bug/282492
2009-08-27T09:51:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	ahh, check
2009-08-27T09:52:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	stupid question perhaps, but why not upgrade to jaunty?
2009-08-27T09:53:00.000Z	esaym	slacker_nl	 I don't know, this was all done over email with a friend... I told him not to upgrade it...
2009-08-27T09:53:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	mkay
2009-08-27T09:53:00.000Z	slacker_nl	esaym	it could work, with debian you can mix and match between stable, testing and unstable as well
2009-08-27T09:54:00.000Z	esaym	slacker_nl	I don't know.  That is way I use debian
