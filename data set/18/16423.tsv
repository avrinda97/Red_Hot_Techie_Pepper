2009-10-13T18:20:00.000Z	simon_1		ah right
2009-10-13T18:20:00.000Z	simon_1		cheers mate
2009-10-13T18:21:00.000Z	simon_1		cant get skype to work on 9.04 thought it might be because it was 64bit but not the case
2009-10-13T18:21:00.000Z	simon_1		not on my fresh instal of 32bit 9.04
2009-10-13T18:22:00.000Z	simon_1		freezes my entire system
2009-10-13T18:22:00.000Z	simon_1		will try again in 2 weeks i guess with 9.10 maybe skype will work with that for me
2009-10-13T18:24:00.000Z	simon_1		is 9.10 going to be a better long term supported version or whatever you call those versions??
2009-10-13T18:24:00.000Z	simon_1		ah right
2009-10-13T18:25:00.000Z	simon_1		is it possible to back up the terminal history when upgrading
2009-10-13T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 the bash history is saved in .history
2009-10-13T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 i think.. let me check. :)
2009-10-13T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 or use history > myhistory.txt
2009-10-13T18:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	  the history file is normally not worth worrying about. :)
2009-10-13T18:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 since each shell can change it.. it can be in quiet a state of flux
2009-10-13T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 that file can get overwritten at any time.
2009-10-13T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 if you have 2 terminals open and do different commands in each one.. then close each one.. which one save4s the history? :)
2009-10-13T18:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 dont depend on anything in  the history 'staying' there
2009-10-13T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simon_1	 in fact as each shell closes it writes to the .bash_history so whatever shell closes last gets 'saved'
