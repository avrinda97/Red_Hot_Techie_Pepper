2008-05-14T12:48:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	alright, what part of this are you interested in?
2008-05-14T12:45:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	back, on ubuntu, so what am I doing? And thank you in advance for the help
2008-05-14T12:46:00.000Z	ghindo	neuron	first describe to me what problem you are having with your wireless.  What happens when you try to connect to a wireless network?
2008-05-14T12:47:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	there is no attempt to connect unforunately :( I can't even try that, it doesn't read the essid, or that there's even a network in range
2008-05-14T12:47:00.000Z	ghindo	neuron	could you open up the terminal for me and type iwconfig
2008-05-14T12:48:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	eth0      no wireless extensions.
2008-05-14T12:49:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	no eth1, just wmaster0 and wlan0
2008-05-14T12:52:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	I don't know where to find such a restricted driver, and...I'm assuming it would be on, considering it's a laptop? O_O
2008-05-14T12:52:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	I do have a switch, on the side of the laptop to find a new network and it's on, no cigar
2008-05-14T12:53:00.000Z	ghindo	neuron	Go to Adminstration -> Hardware Drivers and tell me what you see
2008-05-14T12:54:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	a blank box saying "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system" at the top in bold
2008-05-14T12:55:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	alright, thanks
2008-05-14T12:58:00.000Z	ghindo	neuron	do you know what make/model of wireless card you have?
2008-05-14T12:59:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	Intel Wireless WiFi Link...I don't remember the number, but it's in the thread...And yes, I am
2008-05-14T13:03:00.000Z	ghindo	neuron	I'm not finding anything helpful on the forums, and I'm about out of ideas.  The best I could find was a similar thread, here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=774717&highlight=inspiron+1525
2008-05-14T13:04:00.000Z	ghindo	neuron	I would still ask around, though.  Sorry you're having trouble - I have an Inspiron too, and it works right out of the box, so I don't know why yours wouldn't work
2008-05-14T13:04:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	eep :( Well thank you anyways
2008-05-14T13:08:00.000Z	neuron	ghindo	it's fine, I'm willing to try a reinstall if I need to, I just am so confused :(
