2009-04-04T18:33:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	like -x /bin/chmod ?
2009-04-04T18:34:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	hahah, yea.
2009-04-04T18:35:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	Yea, that is correct.  Unless you use -R switch.
2009-04-04T18:35:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	But then it will apply permissions to files too, so it's still correct.
2009-04-04T23:39:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	Not always - in many keyboards it's a solid line.
2009-04-28T20:40:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	And plug it in again, see what it says.
2009-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	I have a sansa mp3 player and can rw it just fine.
2009-04-28T21:48:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	pCarsten: just an idea, 'sync' (helped me once when installing Ubuntu to a VM).
2009-04-28T21:49:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	 pCarsten         I dono
2009-06-21T16:24:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	I do have dualboot on a 20 gig :)
2009-06-21T16:25:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	I have a 40gig HD.
2009-09-02T18:04:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	It's useful for more than that, isn't it?
2010-01-02T15:42:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	Shouldn't it be DISPLAY=:0.0
2010-01-02T15:42:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	I think that second number is only for when you have multiple monitors or something.
2010-01-02T15:43:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	Oh, so it probably works either way, (with single monotor)?
2010-01-02T15:43:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	or with single video output?
2010-01-02T15:44:00.000Z	grawity	usr13	Eh, I don't know much about those things. I have a single monitor. I just know that the second number is never required.
2010-01-02T15:44:00.000Z	usr13	grawity	Ok, thanks.
