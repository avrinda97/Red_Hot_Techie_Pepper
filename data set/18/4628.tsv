2010-01-11T04:31:00.000Z	zoidfarb		hey, I'm trying to do some compiling too...
2010-01-11T04:31:00.000Z	zoidfarb		anyone know how I can find the GCC path and the LD path?
2010-01-11T04:31:00.000Z	zoidfarb		(I need them for the makefile)
2010-01-11T04:32:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	thats waaay to vague
2010-01-11T04:32:00.000Z	zoidfarb	acicula	"GCC path" and "LD path" are vague?
2010-01-11T04:32:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	yeah
2010-01-11T04:33:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	misread , thought you said patch, gcc sits in /usr/bin
2010-01-11T04:33:00.000Z	zoidfarb	acicula	the readme file (admittedly poorly written) seems to act like those are specific system paths I should
2010-01-11T04:33:00.000Z	zoidfarb	acicula	what is LD? I know GCC is the GNU C Compiler.
2010-01-11T04:45:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	i seem to recall it can do something with wpa , prolly uses wpasupplicant for that( as does pretty much everything?)
2010-01-11T04:46:00.000Z	zoidfarb	acicula	thanks. The wireless module I'm compiling has a compile option that says to enable it if you want to control the driver with NetworkManager. Because I guess network manager has built-in WPA support? But then there's a different option if you want it controlled by WPA_SUPPLICANT.
2010-01-11T04:48:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	networkmanager uses wpasupplicant under the hood
2010-01-11T04:48:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	you want networkmanager support
2010-01-11T05:00:00.000Z	zoidfarb	acicula	I PM'd you some text from a readme file because I didn't want to spam the chat, I hope that's ok. (I could use pastebin if you prefer)
2010-01-11T05:01:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	pastebin is probably better
2010-01-11T05:01:00.000Z	acicula	zoidfarb	maybe someone else knows the answer, i saw it, but dont know really
2010-01-11T05:02:00.000Z	zoidfarb	acicula	thanks, I appreciate it.
