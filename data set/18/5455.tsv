2010-03-14T07:18:00.000Z	jaypur	lullabud	at ubuntu server... i install openssh-server, and at the normal pc... openssh... is that it?
2010-03-14T07:18:00.000Z	lullabud	jaypur	no, openssh-server is the service you connect to.  openssh is the client you use to connect to the server with.

2010-03-14T07:20:00.000Z	lullabud	jaypur	fyi, there are a LOT of great articles on how to do amazing things with ssh.  ssh is one of the most powerful tools that linux has.
2010-03-14T07:24:00.000Z	jaypur	lullabud	so i'll write at my tutorial that the user should run at server and client, sudo apt-get install ssh, and everything will be ok right?
