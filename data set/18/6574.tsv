2009-05-17T22:25:00.000Z	Spreadsheet		Hello
2009-05-17T22:26:00.000Z	Spreadsheet		I put a USB IMG of a linux distro on a thumbdrive using dd. It didn't work. Now, I am trying to format it as FAT32 but now it says the space is 150 mb. It was originally 4gb
2009-05-17T22:27:00.000Z	Spreadsheet		I tried to format it on windows. ubuntu also says it's 150 mb
2009-05-17T22:27:00.000Z	Spreadsheet		the IMG was around 150 mb
2009-05-17T22:27:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	yes it can if you install a special software
2009-05-17T22:30:00.000Z	Spreadsheet	aaron_	oh
2009-05-17T22:31:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	 windows can read ext   only if you use a special program that is installed. Otherwise  windows by itself can't read such a format/filesystem.
2009-05-17T22:32:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	did you use the space up?
2009-05-17T22:32:00.000Z	Spreadsheet	aaron_	no
2009-05-17T22:33:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	so you have a blank 4 gig memory and it would show 512mb or something not 4gb.
2009-05-17T22:33:00.000Z	Spreadsheet	aaron_	yes
2009-05-17T22:33:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	is this a flash drive?
2009-05-17T22:33:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	did you try taking it out waiting about 5 min and putting it back in.
2009-05-17T22:36:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	you formatted the flash drive?
2009-05-17T22:38:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	format it to ntfs.  You will need to go to the dependancies and  install  a program that will read ntfs format.
2009-05-17T22:46:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	 boot into windows and then format the flash drive to ntfs. Then in ubuntu do to system, -> admin, then SPM  which is ubuntu package manager.  then search ntfs
2009-05-17T22:46:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	you should find couple program. Read the descriptions:  one should say make ntfs readable   you would want that one.
2009-05-17T22:47:00.000Z	aaron_	Spreadsheet	look above
