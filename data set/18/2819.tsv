2010-03-25T17:55:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	yes
2010-03-25T18:00:00.000Z	exploreralex	abhi_nav	i tried to copy the .iso image file from a disk to create a live usb using the creator. but the usb wasn't working when i tried to install. do i need to first write the image to a cd
2010-03-25T18:00:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	no. just have a iso image and follow standard procedure with unetbootin
2010-03-25T18:01:00.000Z	exploreralex	abhi_nav	ok. will try now. thanks.:)
2010-03-25T18:01:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	:D
2010-03-25T18:10:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	if server edition cant be use on usb then you cant, but if you officialy can, then you are not doing well procedures
2010-03-25T18:07:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	ahh, does trying takes money? no? then just try? its matter of 5-10 mins? pleaes try first
2010-03-25T18:08:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	you tried? and it is not working?
2010-03-25T18:09:00.000Z	exploreralex	abhi_nav	yes i did. it showed that the process completed successfully. then when i tried to boot a PC with the usb it said no boot-able files found. reboot or insert disk.
2010-03-25T18:12:00.000Z	exploreralex	abhi_nav	hmm. that's the thing. its not mentioned even in the LTSP documentation. well lets see.

2010-03-25T18:13:00.000Z	exploreralex	abhi_nav	yes.

2010-03-25T18:16:00.000Z	exploreralex	abhi_nav	i've started the process of creating another usb startup disk. let's see where that leads me. i'll still go through the link.
2010-03-25T18:17:00.000Z	abhi_nav	exploreralex	stop that and see that link first. link may have important info. and do remember to do google always first
