2010-03-25T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jkd4	 also most 'theme' stuff is actually theme PARTS you access/select via the customize button/settings in the theme tool
2010-03-25T19:12:00.000Z	jkd4	Dr_Willis	where are themes?
2010-03-25T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jkd4	for gnome its the 'appearance' menu item in the system/prefs menu
2010-03-25T19:17:00.000Z	jkd4	Dr_Willis	this is what I'm trying to install http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/DockbarX?content=101604
2010-03-25T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jkd4	 thats not a theme  and there are repos for that program.
2010-03-25T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jkd4	 check out the dockbarx homepage and look for  'ppa' repositories for it.
2010-03-25T19:24:00.000Z	jkd4	Dr_Willis	I did use the ppa repos
2010-03-25T19:25:00.000Z	jkd4	Dr_Willis	now how do I use the dock bar?
2010-03-25T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jkd4	 then you update/install the tool and its in the add to panel... menu items under the gnome panel settings.
2010-03-25T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jkd4	 same as you add anything else to the panels
