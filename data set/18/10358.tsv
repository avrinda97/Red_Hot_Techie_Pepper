2006-12-16T08:07:00.000Z	carutsu		can anyone tell me how to add packages (no programs) in KDE? like Synaptics?
2006-12-16T08:08:00.000Z	carutsu		if i uninstall GNOME does synaptics go with it?
2006-12-16T08:09:00.000Z	carutsu		ok, but how can i add packages with KDE?
2006-12-16T08:09:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	kde has adept
2006-12-16T08:09:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	you can always reinstall synaptic and use it in kde
2006-12-19T09:59:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	please tell people to use aptitude, if not its a nightmare when they want to remove all of kde or xfce that they just happened to install
2006-12-19T09:59:00.000Z	carutsu	nothlit	im in ubuntu so i think they have apt-get otherwise would be kubuntu no?
2006-12-19T10:00:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	all ubuntu desktop installs, probably even server installs should have aptitude and apt-get
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	carutsu	nothlit	i didnt knew that, i though it was kde only
2006-12-19T10:07:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	finding what?
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	no thats adept, and you can use synaptic in kde and adept in gnome
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	carutsu	nothlit	sorry! i confused them!
2006-12-19T10:02:00.000Z	nothlit	carutsu	most it can do is crash firefox
2006-12-19T10:07:00.000Z	carutsu	nothlit	i'm sorry i cant find it, would you mind giving me a hand?
2006-12-19T10:08:00.000Z	carutsu	nothlit	flash 9 i see i see libflash-mozplugin -swfplayer flashplayer-mozilla! too many choices but none of them says 9
2006-12-19T10:11:00.000Z	carutsu	nothlit	finally after all this time in flash 7 we are going to flash 9, we are finally catching them up viva linux!
