2010-11-19T07:25:00.000Z	pmp6nl		Hello, does anyone know the command to add to the startup applications to delay them... something I can add right from system--preferences--startup
2010-11-19T07:26:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	in the script sleep <seconds>
2010-11-19T07:27:00.000Z	pmp6nl	shcherbak	so I cannot just add it to the command in the menu, it has to be in the actual script?
2010-11-19T07:27:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	well, two line script.
2010-11-19T07:27:00.000Z	pmp6nl		scherbak: something like sleep 300;
2010-11-19T07:28:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	i.e. sleep 10; firefox &; disown %1; exit
2010-11-19T07:29:00.000Z	pmp6nl	shcherbak	so I would need to create a separate script to startup all of the applications, I cant edit the startup scripts that already exist (btw where are they)?
2010-11-19T07:30:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	why do you want to delay them?
2010-11-19T07:30:00.000Z	pmp6nl		stork start with miro or hulu desktop
2010-11-19T07:30:00.000Z	pmp6nl	shcherbak	my backup application slows everything down
2010-11-19T07:32:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	not sure it does much sens to run backup @ boot, you could write script to trigger it while loads are low.
2010-11-19T07:33:00.000Z	pmp6nl	shcherbak	no sorry, its not a backup script but a backup program: spideroak.  I would also like to delay dropbox
2010-11-19T07:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	just getting familiar with both programs, do you have that much stuff to back up, I use ls, grep, cp and gzip for that purpose
2010-11-19T07:39:00.000Z	pmp6nl	shcherbak	I want the programs to run on startup since they keep track of file changes and back them up.  I just want to delay them on startup say 30 seconds so everything else can load first
2010-11-19T07:42:00.000Z	shcherbak	pmp6nl	script would be easiest, I think you could halt them externaly, but it looks less stable
2010-11-19T07:43:00.000Z	pmp6nl	shcherbak	hummm youd think i could tell it to wait 30 secs pretty easily....
