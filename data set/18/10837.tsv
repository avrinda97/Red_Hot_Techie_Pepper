2006-10-18T16:41:00.000Z	morphix	pckim93	ugh.. there is known problem with your board.. i have a similar board (uses 975 chipset) and i have problems.
2006-10-18T16:42:00.000Z	pckim93	morphix	have you been able to install it eventually?
2006-10-18T16:42:00.000Z	morphix	pckim93	i can install it... as the 975 chipset uses intel ide for main ide
2006-10-18T16:43:00.000Z	morphix	pckim93	there is a work around to getting the cdrom to work with it.. just a sec and i'll get it

2006-10-18T16:47:00.000Z	morphix	pckim93	mines the p5w dh.. anyway.. look at this for your problems. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core_2_Duo_Support

2006-10-18T16:52:00.000Z	morphix	pckim93	download the edgy beta alternate cd.. and when the initial "boot or install ubuntu" screen press F6, it should show a box in the bottom right hand corner.. enter what i said there
