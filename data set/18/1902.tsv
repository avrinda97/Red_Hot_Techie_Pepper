2010-10-12T18:41:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	so I just typed in "route" but it didn't return my desktop machine.
2010-10-12T18:42:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	np
2010-10-12T18:45:00.000Z	BluesKaj	christf	your IP will start with 192.168.x.x , run this , ip a | grep inet
2010-10-12T18:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	christf	 ip a | grep inet
2010-10-12T18:48:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	I did that. Didn't return any 192.168 addresses though
2010-10-12T18:49:00.000Z	BluesKaj	christf	try ifconfig
2010-10-12T18:49:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	yes, Windows did return the 192.168 IP when I did that earlier.
2010-10-12T18:50:00.000Z	BluesKaj	christf	no that command also lists your box it will be listed as the "inet address"
2010-10-12T18:51:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	I don't see any inet address in Windows, if that's what you're talking about?
2010-10-12T18:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	christf	windows ??
2010-10-12T18:52:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	yup
2010-10-12T18:53:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	I thought ipconfig was for windows?
2010-10-12T18:54:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	Hang on, let me re-explain.
2010-10-12T18:55:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	I've got Ubuntu 10.10 on my laptop and Win7 on my desktop. I want to access my Win7 system from my Ubuntu laptop, but every time I try to connect it keeps asking for a password/username, but it never accepts anything I put in. It even asks for a username/password even if the directory is open to ANYBODY on the network.
2010-10-12T18:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	christf	W7 is a prob for me as well , sorry didn't mean to interfere , didn't realize you were dealing with W7 , it's networking sucks and I haven't been able to solve that problem either , samba and smb don't seem to work well with it.
2010-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	ah k. Well that sucks >.<, I remember I had it working at one stage many months ago, but I can't remember how I did it, haha.
2010-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	christf	BluesKaj	thank you anyway
