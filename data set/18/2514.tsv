2012-07-19T01:31:00.000Z	zteam		Hi guys
2012-07-19T01:32:00.000Z	zteam		anybody here knows how repartition a usb-stick?
2012-07-19T01:34:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	Sure.  fdisk
2012-07-19T01:34:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	Same way you re-partition any other drive.
2012-07-19T01:35:00.000Z	zteam	usr13	okey, never used fdisk throught
2012-07-19T01:35:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	Pretty easy really.  Try it.
2012-07-19T01:36:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	What is it sdb ?
2012-07-19T01:36:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	Why do you want to repartition it though?
2012-07-19T01:36:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	What is your end goal?
2012-07-19T01:37:00.000Z	zteam	usr13	well for some reason my Bios refuses to boot from the usb-drive no matter how hard I try
2012-07-19T01:37:00.000Z	zteam	usr13	it works quite randomly
2012-07-19T01:37:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	I dont think it is a matter of partitioning but more of the MBR
2012-07-19T01:38:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	or something with that particular computer.
2012-07-19T01:39:00.000Z	zteam	usr13	after googling around a little bit I found an article suggesting that you can fool bios to treat the usb-stick as a usb-harddrive by adding a second partition to it
2012-07-19T01:40:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	Never heard of that, (but I certainly don't know everythig.
2012-07-19T01:40:00.000Z	zteam	usr13	Well, I tried the usb-stick in another computer too, and it works really great, every time, but this machine will only boot from it some time
2012-07-19T01:40:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	You can certainly creat two partitions on it easily enough.
2012-07-19T01:41:00.000Z	usr13	zteam	sudo fdisk -l   #will show you what you have, (all drives).
