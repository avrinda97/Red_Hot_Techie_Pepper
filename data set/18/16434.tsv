2004-09-27T08:36:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB		he put x11 as the default output in mplayer
2004-09-27T08:36:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB		well, sdl
2004-09-27T08:36:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB		it depends on sdl anyway
2004-09-27T08:37:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB		sdl automagically figures out xv/x11/yourmother
2004-09-27T08:37:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	lol
2004-09-27T08:37:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	neighborlee	my fiance got sick of me playing with it.. she's not that impressed because she's already using debian unstable
2004-09-27T08:38:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	sweet ;-))
2004-09-27T11:07:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	100x would seem to be a slight exageration <G>
2004-09-27T11:08:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	neighborlee	if I didn't make it crazy, some idiot would beleive me
2004-09-27T11:08:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	ROFL
2004-09-28T07:01:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	neighborlee	what do you actually want to do
2004-09-28T07:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	well..i'm trying to install theut2k4 retail via a .sh script included on the CD
2004-09-28T07:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	but..its written FOR gtk1 not gtk2 that gnome2.8 comes with.
2004-09-28T07:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	thus the problem LOL..they made it for gtk1 compat it seems..so i'm being told to extract .sh file and run it another way
2004-09-28T07:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	sigh I might just as well use the textual installer and forget it LOL
2004-09-28T07:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	they are talking about supporting GTK2 'next time' <G>
2004-09-28T10:55:00.000Z	neighborlee	Hrdwr_BoB	sweet thx
