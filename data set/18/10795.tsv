2006-10-24T10:58:00.000Z	cybe		The topic is talking about problems with the nvidia drivers... is that why the nvidia-glx package is broken?
2006-10-24T10:59:00.000Z	cybe		Okay.... Just can't download the nvidia-glx drivers :(
2006-10-24T10:59:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	that thing in the topic is talking about a security problem
2006-10-24T11:03:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	you have to post the link
2006-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	hmm seems like the dependencies are messed up the versions are wrong
2006-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	so is there anything I can do about it? Or will i have to wait?
2006-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	well if you really wanted to you could download the binary driver yourself
2006-10-24T11:08:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	you can try installing each package seperately
2006-10-24T11:09:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	well, tried the nvidia-kernel, but it had no installation candidate
2006-10-24T11:09:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	do you have the restricted repo in your source.lst?
2006-10-24T11:10:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	2 sec, will check
2006-10-24T11:12:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	Thats the "Restricted Copyright" thing in synaptic right?
2006-10-24T11:12:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	think so
2006-10-24T11:12:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	That's crossed...
2006-10-24T11:12:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	well it seems like you have that repo enabled then
2006-10-24T11:13:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	yeah... Don't know what it means that it has no Installation Candidate... But never had that problem before
2007-05-05T13:26:00.000Z	kitche	cybe	usser using rm -r plus force is sorta like a format it's liek doing deltree c:\
2007-05-05T13:28:00.000Z	cybe	kitche	okay thanks
