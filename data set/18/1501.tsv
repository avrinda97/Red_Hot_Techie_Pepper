2011-03-10T21:12:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	couldn't you have made things a bit more complicated ;-)
2011-03-10T21:13:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	hehe been there ;)
2011-03-10T21:14:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	so you get a fully working vnc connection, except that it doesn't work with your keboard/mouse?
2011-03-10T21:14:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	correct
2011-03-10T21:15:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	which vnc server are you using?
2011-03-10T21:15:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	and I run 'vncserver' to start it on the system
2011-03-10T21:15:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	XtightVNC
2011-03-10T21:16:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	I'm assuming you're not using -viewonly
2011-03-10T21:17:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	correct, just the plain command 'vncviewer' run by the user who is owns the destkop I want to use
2011-03-10T21:18:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	if you want to se the desktop then x11vnc is probably best
2011-03-10T21:19:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	I'm going for just a virtual desktop, maybe that's a clue to my issue
2011-03-10T21:19:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	does vncviewer work locally?
2011-03-10T21:20:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	at either end
2011-03-10T21:20:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	I'll try that
2011-03-10T21:21:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	if you have a picture I think you must have 2 way communication, so it can only be the either the client is screwed, or the server end is not starting properly
2011-03-10T21:21:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	probably, I will try something other than tightvnc
2011-03-10T21:22:00.000Z	rwat	greg3000	AFAIK vnc only ever uses TCP, not UDP so you should be fine tunnelling through ssh
2011-03-10T21:23:00.000Z	greg3000	rwat	agreed, I tunnel for all my remote servers
