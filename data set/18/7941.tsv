2007-10-22T22:44:00.000Z	newubuntie		I can't access windows anymore from grub, can anybody help?
2007-10-22T22:45:00.000Z	MoeD	newubuntie	 define "not access".  It doesn't show up as an option, or it does, but won't boot once selected?

2007-10-22T22:48:00.000Z	MoeD	newubuntie	 I only meant, what do you MEAN by "not access windows".  Do you mean it doesn't show up as an option?  Or it does show up as an option, but windows won't boot if you select it?
