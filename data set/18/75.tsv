2012-10-06T18:32:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		the private network interface has a static IP
2012-10-06T18:32:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		and the public network interface has DHCP.
2012-10-06T18:32:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		the problem i have is that i am able to ping entities on the private network
2012-10-06T18:33:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		but not the public network.
2012-10-06T18:33:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		ip route indicates that a route is setup to the private network
2012-10-06T18:33:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		but not the public network.
2012-10-06T18:34:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		the qn - isn't dhcp supposed to take care of setting up the gateway for the public network?
2012-10-06T18:36:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		i setup a gateway using the route add command
2012-10-06T18:36:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		but that doesn't persist across reboots.
2012-10-06T18:36:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		how do i persist the gateway settings added using route add command across reboots?
2012-10-06T18:38:00.000Z	escott	sradhakrishna	probably in /etc/network/interfaces
2012-10-06T18:38:00.000Z	sradhakrishna		can we setup a gateway for a dhcp configured interface in /etc/network/interfaces?
2012-10-06T18:39:00.000Z	escott	sradhakrishna	why is your dhcp server not configuring the client correctly?
2012-10-06T18:40:00.000Z	sradhakrishna	escott	can't figure that. :(
2012-10-06T18:44:00.000Z	escott	sradhakrishna	i think the standard response is going to be "fix your dhcp server or don't use dhcp" there seems to be little point to using a dhcp server that is not properly configuring the client, it would be easier for you to just make the client fully static
2012-10-06T18:46:00.000Z	sradhakrishna	escott	thanks for the advice. One more qn - how can i check if the route to the public network's gateway is set properly?
2012-10-06T18:46:00.000Z	sradhakrishna	escott	where is it recorded on the system?
2012-10-06T18:47:00.000Z	escott	sradhakrishna	the "route" command will show routes. its correct if it works
