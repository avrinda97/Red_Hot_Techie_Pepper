2007-01-10T12:34:00.000Z	juano__	puff	have you tried amarok?
2007-01-10T12:37:00.000Z	juano__	puff	what seems to be the problem exactlY?
2007-01-10T12:38:00.000Z	puff	juano__	Well, it seems that i can't write changes to my ipod. I think something weird is going on with the mounting.
2007-01-10T12:39:00.000Z	juano__	puff	ipod-itunes support is pretty lame, well at least i couldnt get my motorola rokr e1 to sync at all, ive tried everything
2007-01-10T12:39:00.000Z	juano__	puff	i suggest you try amarok or rhythmbox
2007-01-10T12:41:00.000Z	puff	juano__	I don't need itunes support, I just need to be able to add/remove tracks and set up playlists.
2007-01-10T13:55:00.000Z	puff	juano__	so about amarok... I'm giving it a try now, I don't see how I access the ipod in i.
2007-01-10T13:55:00.000Z	puff	juano__	Oh, I see "media devices" now.
2007-01-10T13:56:00.000Z	juano__	puff	yeah, you can connect to it through media devices
2007-01-10T13:56:00.000Z	juano__	puff	then add a song to list and sync it
2007-01-10T14:03:00.000Z	puff	juano__	To create a playlist, it looks like I just drag stuff from the media pane on the left to the big pane on the right, then do "Playlist/Save as Playlist", but how do I get it onto the media device?
2007-01-10T14:03:00.000Z	puff	juano__	Does it automatically save onto the media device because I'm dragging stuff onto it from the media device pane?
2007-01-10T14:05:00.000Z	puff	juano__	Garrr... still no playlists on the ipod.
2007-01-10T14:06:00.000Z	juano__	puff	you should right click on the songs in the list , there should be an option move to media.. or something like that dont recall much
2007-01-10T14:06:00.000Z	juano__	puff	try with songs in your library
2007-01-10T14:06:00.000Z	puff	juano__	well, right now I have all the songs I want on the ipod (for now at least), I want to create a playlist.
2007-01-10T14:23:00.000Z	puff	juano__	Okay, so still no playlists, but at least I can add files.  I do find amarok simpler and easier than ipod, now that I know how it's supposed to work.
2007-01-10T14:23:00.000Z	puff	juano__	Thanks, and please, if you see clearzen, relay my thanks.
