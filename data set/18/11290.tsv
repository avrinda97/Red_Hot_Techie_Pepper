2006-08-19T11:18:00.000Z	rancid		I installed network-manager-gnome, but accidentally removed the icon on my panel. Anyone know how to get it back? BTW, I'm not talking about the the network monitor that defaults to the panel.
2006-08-19T11:19:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	if you know the command for network-manager-gnome, you should be able to create a launcher on the panel by right clicking on it and selecting add to panel then application launcher or custom application launcher
2006-08-19T11:20:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	how do you access network-manager-gnome other than that launcher you had
2006-08-19T11:21:00.000Z	rancid	bruenig	it just resided in the panel as an icon when I installed it
2006-08-19T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	did this thing on the panel move and do stuff or just sit idly until you clicked on it
2006-08-19T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	gnome-net<tab><tab>
2006-08-19T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	do you mean network tools?
2006-08-19T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	do gnome-nettool, and see if what it launches is what you are talking about
2006-08-19T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	I don't have a laptop nor wireless connectivity, hence no knowledge
2006-08-19T11:26:00.000Z	rancid	bruenig	I have no idea how it started
2006-08-19T11:26:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	maybe it is an applet you are talking about, right click on the panel then scroll all the way down and see if it is there
2006-08-19T11:27:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	I see it
2006-08-19T11:28:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	can you at least tell if it is an applet or launcher that you were used to clicking on
2006-08-19T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	it is hard to know if that is a launcher or applet, seems unlikely that a launcher would be made for you with an install so if I had to guess i would say applet, but if it is an applet you should be able to add it through that right click add to panel dialog
2006-08-19T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	you could try uninstalling and then reinstalling, maybe it will do it again for you. But you probably should figure out why it works and that way you can at least put it back if it goes away
2006-08-19T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	you are absolutely sure it isn't network monitor?
2006-08-19T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	when you click on it it gives you an option to do just what you were talking about or at least it appears to. I don't have two connections to test it
2006-08-19T11:37:00.000Z	bruenig	rancid	when you do reinstall try to figure out how it works
