2008-04-30T15:44:00.000Z	umbrualbert		Hi all...I cant access smb shares after hardy upgarde
2008-04-30T15:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	same problem here
2008-04-30T15:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	smb:// got broken. Not looked into it much yet
2008-04-30T15:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	well, I would like to have it back (as it worked fine in Gutsy) but I havn't had time to look into it
2008-04-30T15:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	I agree that it is a very major failing that it does not work

2008-04-30T16:09:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	ahh, was one of those dropped in Hardy by default?
2008-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	ahh, nods. Thank you.
2008-04-30T16:13:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	smb:// worked fine in Gutsy, I am disappointed it fails in Hardy. (We need that to just work)
2008-05-02T14:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	agreed
2008-05-02T14:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	smbclient is not working very well in Hardy
2008-05-02T14:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	not had a chance to look yet, sorry
2008-05-02T15:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	nope, none
2008-05-02T15:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	my mirror is a day behind at most and I have all appropriate repos enabled
2008-05-02T15:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	it worked fine with 7.10  (smb://  that is)
2008-05-02T15:06:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	the main issue is that it doesn't request a user/pass in most cases
2008-05-02T15:07:00.000Z	DistroJockey	umbrualbert	and even with the right credentials it fails for most secure shares
