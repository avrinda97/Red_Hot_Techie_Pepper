2011-03-03T22:15:00.000Z	fadax		hi.. i'm trying to configure wifi on ubuntu, but iwconfig only shows "lo" and "eth0" devices. shouldn't i have a wlan0 ?
2011-03-03T22:15:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	what kind of card is it?(usb/built-un)
2011-03-03T22:16:00.000Z	joel135		*in
2011-03-03T22:16:00.000Z	fadax		it's a built in one. the model is Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6230
2011-03-03T22:17:00.000Z	fadax		according to http://intellinuxwireless.org/  the driver is included in the kernel, so i guess it should be working :s
2011-03-03T22:18:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	what output does lsusb give?
2011-03-03T22:19:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	also, what does lspci give?
2011-03-03T22:20:00.000Z	fadax	joel135	well  i'm not with the laptop at the moment, but i ran that command earlier and lsusb didn't show anything to do with networking. i tried lspci too and that showed a device Intel Corporation Device 0091 (rev 34)  which i guess is the network card
2011-03-03T22:21:00.000Z	fadax		and it didn't list any kernel drivers associated with it
2011-03-03T22:21:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	ok
2011-03-03T22:22:00.000Z	fadax	joel135	also every time i boot ubuntu just before the login screen loads it says "too many connections" a couple of times. i don't know if this could be related to my wifi problem?
2011-03-03T22:25:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	do you know your kernel version?
2011-03-03T22:26:00.000Z	fadax	joel135	i think it is 2.6.35
2011-03-03T22:26:00.000Z	fadax		i just downloaded and installed ubuntu desktop 10.10 yesterday so it is the kernel which comes with that
2011-03-03T22:26:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	kernel version 2.6.38 is known to work with that rev of the card
2011-03-03T22:26:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	but it's not stable yet
2011-03-03T22:27:00.000Z	joel135	fadax	I suggest you wait a couple of weeks if you can
2011-03-03T22:28:00.000Z	fadax	joel135	oh right ok, well thanks for the help. can't i try to upgrade the kernel now and then again in 2 weeks when it becomes stable?
