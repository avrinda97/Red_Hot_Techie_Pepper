2011-04-24T23:18:00.000Z	rly	demoth	is your camera plugged in via usb?
2011-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	demoth	rly	camera is integrated, i suppose it should be connected to usb
2011-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	rly	demoth	.....
2011-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	rly	demoth	perhaps you might want to harden the f*ck up on computing knowledge ;)
2011-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	rly	demoth	try lspci
2011-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	demoth	rly	there is also no webcam
2011-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	demoth	rly	the thing is that it worked in 9.10
2011-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	rly	demoth	also read netiquette. You do not just send private messages to people.
2011-04-24T23:21:00.000Z	demoth	rly	yes yes i'm stupid i got it
2011-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	rly	demoth	what about lshw?
2011-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	demoth		nothing either
2011-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	rly	demoth	perhaps your camera is turned off for some reason?
2011-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	rly	demoth	I do not know that model, so I have no idea.
2011-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	rly	demoth	does it work in Windows?
2011-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	demoth		if i had windows..
2011-04-24T23:23:00.000Z	rly	demoth	if it worked in 9.10, put in a livecd for 9.10, and find the device...
