2005-07-14T10:03:00.000Z	|QuaD-		when i apt-get update; apt-get upgrade for breezy, how come a bunch of programs aren't upgrading
2005-07-14T10:03:00.000Z	|QuaD-		they are instead "held back"
2005-07-14T10:04:00.000Z	dabaR	|QuaD-	you forgot to rename some of your sources, maybe, or the programs have not been upgradfed in breezy, or something else.

2005-07-14T10:05:00.000Z	dabaR	|QuaD-	checked the sources.list to see if you changed the names right?

2005-07-14T10:10:00.000Z	dabaR	|QuaD-	dist-upgrade.
2005-07-14T10:10:00.000Z	|QuaD-	dabaR	dist-upgrade removes too much
2005-07-14T10:10:00.000Z	dabaR	|QuaD-	well, then, man apt-get or something, I reallydont know, maybe there is a way to force everything,
