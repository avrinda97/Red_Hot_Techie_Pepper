2010-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	trism	juken	did you ever unmute your microphone? it was muted in one of the pictures you posted a while ago
2010-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	juken	trism	yes, that's been unmuted.
2010-07-02T23:10:00.000Z	juken	trism	the reason for that being muted in the first place was it wasn't the audio tab so I didn't know if that may have been interfering.
2010-07-02T23:11:00.000Z	trism	juken	have you checked out the input tab of pavucontrol?
2010-07-02T23:12:00.000Z	juken	trism	yep

2010-07-02T23:15:00.000Z	juken	trism	oddly enough, if I tap on this thing: http://i.imgur.com/kKMq6.jpg  the input bar goes up and down as if I were talking into the mic.
2010-07-02T23:19:00.000Z	trism	juken	strange, so it would seem that pulseaudio seems to see it, is it selected in System/Preferences/Sound on the input tab?
2010-07-02T23:19:00.000Z	juken	trism	Yea, it is
2010-07-02T23:20:00.000Z	trism	juken	and if so, can you record anything with the Sound Recorder?
2010-07-02T23:20:00.000Z	juken	trism	no, that's where I've been trying, if I record sound and try to listen back it's just blank.
2010-07-02T23:20:00.000Z	juken	trism	I've also been trying the skype test call, but that comes back blank also

2010-07-02T23:31:00.000Z	trism	juken	oh I see, it is moving, but it should be moving much more than that, which is probably why it isn't recording anything
2010-07-02T23:31:00.000Z	juken	trism	that's only when I tap on the little control thing
2010-07-02T23:32:00.000Z	juken	trism	it doesn't move at all when I speak
2010-07-02T23:33:00.000Z	trism	juken	that's my point, for some reason the volume is very low (although you have it on max so I don't understand that), when I tap mine, almost the whole meter fills up
2010-07-02T23:36:00.000Z	juken	trism	it's as if it thinks the microphone is in the control part of the headset rather than in the actual microphone.
