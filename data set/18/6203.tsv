2008-07-02T00:43:00.000Z	joaopinto		where is the bot ?
2008-07-02T00:45:00.000Z	joaopinto		!aptlock | Master_Z
2008-07-02T00:45:00.000Z	MaarekStele	joaopinto	bummer, I was wondering if I could start an instance, I guess I need a vmware to do that
2008-07-02T00:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	you are refering to wubi ? installing using wubi ?
2008-07-02T00:43:00.000Z	MaarekStele	joaopinto	no, if you put the CD or mount the CD on windows XP, there's an option to install as a program in Windows
2008-07-02T00:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	that is wubi
2008-07-02T00:44:00.000Z	MaarekStele	joaopinto	does it have a duel boot option?  just a quick question before checking the site
2008-07-02T00:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	yes, it actually adds an entry to the windows boot loader, so that you can boot into it
2008-07-02T00:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	it does not run "inside" windows, it needs to be booted
2008-07-02T00:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	yup, you need virtualization for that :)
2008-07-02T01:02:00.000Z	MaarekStele	joaopinto	would the VMware player be enough to run both XP and ubuntu at the same time?  I haven't setup VMware before, but have used it on other servers.
2008-07-02T01:02:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	yes
2008-07-02T01:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	that is not recommended !!!
2008-07-02T01:54:00.000Z	MaarekStele	joaopinto	you've got a point, but you have to maintain the sudo for the other users and limit their use of it
2008-07-02T01:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	root is not required for that.. I don't see your point
2008-07-02T01:56:00.000Z	MaarekStele	joaopinto	you can edit the scripting for sudo, if not done right, the other users will have access the same as you do (the admin)
2008-07-02T01:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	MaarekStele	sudo is only required for admins, if you want regular users just keep them out of the admin group :)
