2012-01-19T10:06:00.000Z	almoxarife	oYeVoVeYo	did you go all script kiddie on the network confs after you first noticed? or the issue is something out of the box
2012-01-19T10:09:00.000Z	oYeVoVeYo	almoxarife	I'm using ubuntu on a laptop, not a server. My internet works fine. Even the wire is fine.

2012-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	oYeVoVeYo	almoxarife	I don't think so
2012-01-19T13:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	oYeVoVeYo	done dinning? actually your system sees wlan, remember? all them wifi spots you tried to connect to? and  ethernet? i am guessing you dont have a connection to anything alive on ehternet, well, i cant say, your syslog did though
2012-01-19T13:21:00.000Z	oYeVoVeYo	almoxarife	lol, it was lunch :P I detects wireless networks, I just can't connect to anyone of 'em, frankly I don't even which one os 'em is my own network
2012-01-19T13:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	oYeVoVeYo	why wrapping a working wlan? i can show you your own syslog where it was working this afternoon my time, why not use what you were using then?
2012-01-19T14:10:00.000Z	oYeVoVeYo	almoxarife	busy?
