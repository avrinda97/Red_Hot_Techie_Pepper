2010-07-29T00:45:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	what was the problem again? (so we don't talk in +1)
2010-07-29T00:45:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	you said in +1 that you had nvidia issues ;)
2010-07-29T00:48:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	er, crashes right after installing? do you mean the hardware drivers app or the whole sytem, or do you mean the system doesn't boot right after reboot
2010-07-29T00:49:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	oh, boot loader res being lower is a known issue
2010-07-29T00:51:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	low res on boot should be bug 563878 (if you have a launchpad account click on 'This bug affects ...' and please don't add a comment)
2010-07-29T00:51:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/+bug/563878
2010-07-29T00:52:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	yes, nouveau has no vdpau support (and won't have it for a while I guess)
2010-07-29T00:53:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	but the low res issue won't be fixed in lucid as it's too risky, the devs are trying to improve it in maverick but that broke other drivers currently
2010-07-29T00:54:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	where did you get 256.35 from?
2010-07-29T00:55:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	well, while that certainly is a way to get them, they don't provide a proper .deb package so the drivers don't survive a kernel update
2010-07-29T00:56:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	the x-updates ppa has a proper packaged 256, let me get the link
2010-07-29T00:57:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates/
2010-07-29T00:57:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	odd, that works perfectly fine here with my 250gts
2010-07-29T00:58:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	hm, maybe what failed was the 'Hardware Drivers' app, not the driver itself
2010-07-29T00:59:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	you could try to install 'nvidia-current' in synaptic and run 'sudo nvidia-xconfig' in a terminal, should work
2010-07-29T01:00:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	well, that's partly the drivers fault, you can certailny work around that, but that doesn't mean the driver doesn't work
2010-07-29T01:00:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	it's just that the splash and the nvidia / ati (and some other) drivers don't work well with the splash
2010-07-29T01:04:00.000Z	yofel	calmdude	well, that's partly the fault of the devs deciding to use plymouth for the splash knowing that it won't work well with proprietary drivers, not nvidias fault :/
