2007-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	cstextiles		So For my Intel 386 Machine this link http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/s/sun-java5/sun-java5-bin_1.5.0-10-1_i386.deb is appropriate for me
2007-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	cstextiles		?
2007-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	why don't you just use APT?
2007-01-11T10:33:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	cstextiles use packages.ubuntu.com, it will list dependencies too.  YOu'll need those as well
2007-01-11T10:34:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	this site may be helpful http://ljl.byethost14.com/apt
2007-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	did you try the site I gave you?  A package installed by default is a dependency of ubuntu-desktop
2007-01-11T10:42:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	did you enter "ubuntu-desktop" as your meta package?
2007-01-11T10:44:00.000Z	cstextiles	jrib	this list after entering ubuntu-desktop package gives me a list of only thos packages which are to be installed? Am I correct
2007-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	yes, in theory though the site is pretty new
2007-01-11T10:48:00.000Z	cstextiles	jrib	It shows that I also require odbcinst1debian1 Package and so I think there may be some bugs as that package is not listed in ubuntu Packages Dependency list
2007-01-11T10:49:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	unixodbc is though and that depends on odbcinst1debian1
2007-01-11T10:51:00.000Z	cstextiles	jrib	Ya but unixodbc is not listed in the depency list of http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/libs/sun-java5-jre
2007-01-11T10:52:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	it is for sun-java5-bin
2007-01-11T10:53:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	my suggestion is, "try it" :)  If it works, great.  If not, then you have to do a bit more work
2007-02-15T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	I don't know if this is what you want, but have you looked into sabayon?
2007-02-15T07:06:00.000Z	cstextiles	jrib	No What is that
2007-02-15T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	cstextiles	apt-cache show sabayon, also google
2007-02-15T07:31:00.000Z	cstextiles	jrib	Ya I got that
