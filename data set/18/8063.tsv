2007-12-12T10:44:00.000Z	imyousuf		I want to find out how much memory a process is consuming. Using ps -eopid,%mem,cmd I can find out the percentage; is there any way to find the actual amount? A program hangs my Ubuntu bcz of memory leak so I want a shell script to keep on running to check whether the memory crosses the max amount I assign. If it does in that case it should kill it. Also if someone knows of a better solution please let me know. Thank you in advance
2007-12-12T10:45:00.000Z	ckin2001	imyousuf	pmap -x pid
2007-12-12T10:48:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	ty, but there is a strange value returned by pmap
2007-12-12T10:48:00.000Z	ckin2001	imyousuf	like what
2007-12-12T10:48:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	the ps %mem shows 5.9% which is 120MB of 2GB
2007-12-12T10:50:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	any idea why?
2007-12-12T10:51:00.000Z	ckin2001	imyousuf	pmap may be included libraries, im not quite sure how it works.  also, mem includes /swap if i'm not mistaken
2007-12-12T10:52:00.000Z	ckin2001	imyousuf	you could always multiply %mem by total
2007-12-12T10:52:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	I wanted to avoid that
2007-12-12T10:54:00.000Z	ckin2001	imyousuf	lemme google a bit
2007-12-12T10:54:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	ty

2007-12-12T10:57:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	thaks a lot
2007-12-12T11:00:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	ps -eopid,rss,cmd works fine thanks once again
2007-12-14T10:24:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	Thanks for the help the other day :). This is what I used it for http://imyousuf-tech.blogspot.com/2007/12/guarding-against-softwares-with-memory.html
2007-12-14T10:25:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	with looped cron job not it stops from IDEA crashing my laptop :)
2007-12-14T10:26:00.000Z	ckin2001	imyousuf	does it shut down the program gracefully if it is over memory limit?
2007-12-14T10:27:00.000Z	imyousuf	ckin2001	but I required a cronjob+loop for the trick :)
