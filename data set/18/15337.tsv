2005-04-10T14:42:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan		i'm about a nanometer from deciding to put ubuntu on my free partition
2005-04-10T14:42:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	what is stopping you/
2005-04-10T14:42:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	Burgundavia	just the extra time involved exploring a new distro.  i have kind of a lot invested in my debian desktop setup
2005-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	true true
2005-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	that is what makes live cds great
2005-04-27T11:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	I linux distribution
2005-04-27T11:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	www.ubunt.com
2005-04-27T11:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	generally, ubuntu is built off of debian sid. in fact Ubuntu just synced to debian sid
2005-04-27T11:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	so the sarge thing is a bit of a red herring
2005-04-27T11:09:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	Burgundavia	thanks.
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	I don't see Ubuntu as a net detriment to debian
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	Burgundavia	are all the packages in sid available to ubuntu users?
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	yep
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	ubuntu has more as well
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	easier to get a package into ubuntu that debian
2005-04-27T11:11:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	Burgundavia	how about sarge?  i have sarge on a desktop at work.  could i put ubuntu on a spare partition and switch between sarge and ubuntu using the same home directory?
2005-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	should be able to. Sarge has older packages than Ubuntu
2005-04-27T11:15:00.000Z	Burgundavia	FlimFlamMan	any further questions? ubuntu is a good thing, in my view, for all of linux, and that includes debian
