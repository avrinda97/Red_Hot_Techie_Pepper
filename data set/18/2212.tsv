2010-07-29T21:24:00.000Z	sahilm		how do I fix the overbold default fonts on lucid? Setting full hinting doesn't help.
2010-07-29T21:26:00.000Z	sahilm		nobody else thinks the fonts on lucid are overbold and fuzzy?
2010-07-29T21:28:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	they look that way for my monitor before I install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-07-29T21:28:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	that makes it a ton better
2010-07-29T21:28:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	ubuntu-restricted-extras just installs ms fonts. That doesn't help.
2010-07-29T21:29:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	have you tried using a different font? serif works for my monitor
2010-07-29T21:29:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	I'm talking about font rendering in general.
2010-07-29T21:29:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	They're just too bold.
2010-07-29T21:30:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	I'm using Gnome. With LXDE th rendering is different.
2010-07-29T21:30:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	is your screen refresh rate set appropriately>
2010-07-29T21:31:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	yes.
2010-07-29T21:31:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	I guess I'll have to try something besides Gnome.
2010-07-29T21:32:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	I'll give LXDE a whirl.
2010-07-29T21:32:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	you probably won't be disappointed
2010-07-29T21:32:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	the Lubuntu desktop is a little buggy tho--be sure to backup before you install
2010-07-29T21:33:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	I'll just install LXDE and leave gnome as it was.
2010-07-29T21:33:00.000Z	sahilm	econdudeawesome	rather than installing lubuntu.
2010-07-29T21:33:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	sahilm	good plan
