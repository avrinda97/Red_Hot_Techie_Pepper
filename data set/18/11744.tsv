2007-09-23T08:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	Knock it off
2007-12-07T04:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	start by reading the instructions from the place that you got the tar
2007-12-07T04:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	aside from that there is usually a readme inside the tar
2007-12-07T04:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	download it again or try to find an md5 for the file and check it
2007-12-07T04:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	does it give any error, do you have a link to the site where you got it that may have instructions etc..
2007-12-07T04:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	did you ever tell us what the program is or where you got it.?  as asked repeatedly
2007-12-07T04:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	how about a link
2007-12-07T04:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	did you do this yet..  http://www.acetoneteam.org/gutsy-readme.txt
2007-12-07T04:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	did you get the deb.. or a tar?
2007-12-07T04:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	earlier you said tar so I needed to ask
2007-12-07T04:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	earlier you said you were ot getting any error.... sorry but I am a bit busy to help you with that..  maye someone else will
2007-12-07T04:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	goodbye
2007-12-07T04:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	You are NOT following those instructions.. obviously you are not logged in as root per the instructions
2008-01-18T06:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	narothepharoh	Lots.. FPS.. I like sauerbraten... since this is a support room, you might try asking in #Ubuntu-offtopic
