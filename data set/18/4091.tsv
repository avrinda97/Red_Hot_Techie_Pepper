2009-06-06T18:17:00.000Z	boss_mc	wibu	then either restart the terminal or type source .bashrc to activate it
2009-06-06T18:18:00.000Z	wibu	boss_mc	youve been really helpful :) on to google chrome!!!!
2009-06-06T18:18:00.000Z	boss_mc	wibu	where did you get chrome from? there's a ppa for chromium-browser (the opensource managed version)...
2009-06-06T18:19:00.000Z	wibu	boss_mc	google :) chromium installs part of wine right? i'd prefer the native version dont like wine that much. im sober now
2009-06-06T18:20:00.000Z	wibu	boss_mc	besides the chrome er., the gui of chrome is smoother rather than in wine
2009-06-06T18:21:00.000Z	wibu	boss_mc	its awesome
2009-06-06T18:21:00.000Z	wibu	boss_mc	buggy though
2009-06-06T18:21:00.000Z	boss_mc	wibu	to be expected and I guess it doesn't support a lot of stuff (flash/java being the obvious candidates for failure)
2009-06-06T18:22:00.000Z	wibu	boss_mc	yup - yet. firefox getting too bloaty even without extensions now
