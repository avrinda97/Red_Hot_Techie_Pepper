2007-07-27T12:55:00.000Z	bjames		hi all, I've just managed to get wake on LAN working on my server PC running Ubuntu - my only problem is that the setting I used is not persistent across reboots.  How do I make the following change persistant:    sudo ethtool -s eth1 g
2007-07-27T12:55:00.000Z	bjames		??
2007-07-27T12:55:00.000Z	bjames		is there a config file somewhere?
2007-07-27T12:56:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	easiest would be to add it to rc3.d or similar
2007-07-27T12:56:00.000Z	bjames	howlingmadhowi1	ok - I'll give that a try
2007-07-27T12:57:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	it's a folder in /etc. the rcX.d folders contain scripts which are run when you change from one runlevel to another
2007-07-27T12:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	just add your own script to rc3.d and call it S<2 numbers><name>
2007-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	yep
2007-07-27T13:07:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	can you paste me an 'ls -l' on the directory where you placed the script and a cat of the script itself?
2007-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	i see it. can you make it executable?
2007-07-27T13:19:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	and if it doesn't work, can you paste me the script itself?
2007-07-27T13:28:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	i'm not sure why not. it looks okay
2007-07-27T13:30:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	try adding "ethtool -s eth1 wol g" to a suitable script in /etc/init.d/
2007-07-27T13:38:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	i wonder why not. i'm getting short of answers here
2007-07-27T13:38:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	well, getting short of suggestions more like
2007-07-27T13:40:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	have a look here: http://www.howtoforge.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3628 it's pretty much what we've been doing though
2007-07-27T13:43:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	have a look at /etc/init.d/networking. then read the manual page for ifup. also worthy of reading: /etc/network/interfaces
2007-07-27T14:05:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	bjames	did the page help?
