2008-07-24T00:12:00.000Z	bahadunn		linux-vserver?
2008-07-24T00:12:00.000Z	bahadunn		what is that?
2008-07-24T00:12:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	it is like an advanced chrooted env... does not emulates any harware, runs on a single kernel but isolates the vms
2008-07-24T00:13:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	ah so it is another virtualization sort of thing?
2008-07-24T00:13:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	yes, but from a different perspective.. doesn't slows the server down. I prefer it over Xen
2008-07-24T00:13:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	have you played around with kvm at all?
2008-07-24T00:15:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	nope.. never heard of it
2008-07-24T00:15:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	if you have a cpu with virtualization instructions you can use kvm which is a linux kernel module
2008-07-24T00:15:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	you can run virtual guest OS at hardware speed
2008-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	that I have.... Opteron 1xx series :)
2008-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	its pretty nice
2008-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	i will chk it out, thx for the info
2008-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	they have some pretty nice kvm tools for management of vms too
2008-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	no problem
2008-07-24T00:16:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	its nice for testing out things like ubuntu intrepid or development
2008-07-24T00:17:00.000Z	bahadunn	vargadanis	you can install on a virtual guest and play around with it without affecting your normal system
2008-07-24T00:18:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	I will do that for sure... :) btw... have u playd with linux-vserver so far?
2008-07-24T00:21:00.000Z	vargadanis	bahadunn	just chked the benchmarks on KVM... it is not very promising and XEN's are not either
