2005-07-16T06:08:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	what's it doing?
2005-07-16T06:03:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	cvscedega
2005-07-16T06:05:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	?
2005-07-16T06:06:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	any reason you won't try cvscedega?
2005-07-16T06:07:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	then what's the problem?
2005-07-16T06:07:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	it's free, it plays games, it sounds like what you want...
2005-07-16T06:10:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	you can reinstall/upgrade the kernel without doing that... what would need you to reinstall the system?!
2005-07-16T06:11:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	google cvscedega
2005-07-16T06:11:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	it's free if you build it yourself, otherwise  you need to pay
2005-07-16T06:12:00.000Z	Danar	glyph_	but search specifically for cvscedega and you'll find what you need
