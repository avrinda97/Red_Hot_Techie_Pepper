2008-02-23T09:10:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	I kindly await your thesis on how to do that :)
2008-02-23T09:12:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	set up a dummy user with no privs ... make a key pair for the laptop to do this with ... authorize that key in the dummy user ... cron this: ssh -R 34567:127.0.0.1:22 -f dummy@myhomecomputer
2008-02-23T09:14:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	if laptop gets stolen, watch for dummy user to get logged in ... if it happens capture its IP then login to the laptop via port 34567
2008-02-23T09:15:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	we have to test it first ... send me your laptop :)
2008-02-23T09:16:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	could you everything in laymans terms I kinda get everything you just told me
2008-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	define layman
2008-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	that would make an awesome .deb for everyone
2008-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	noob
2008-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	needs to just bee a HOWTO
2008-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	yes, agreed. I dont know how to code or I would create a .deb from what you just told me
2008-02-23T09:18:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	problem is lots of references need to happen ... like for example someone that doesn't know how to create a crontab entry ... do I need to teach them how to do that, too?
2008-02-23T09:18:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	hmmm, i don;t know how to that myself
2008-02-23T09:19:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	something to learn ... sure there is some GUI app to do it ... else read the man pages and do it from commandline
2008-02-23T09:20:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	Windows is the OS for people that don't want to learn how to use a computer
2008-02-23T09:20:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	YEP, totally agree
2008-02-23T09:21:00.000Z	dsmith_	Skapare	 haha, no way
2008-02-23T09:22:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	that girl is very smart ... for example she hooked up the new DVD player to the TV ... via RGB component cables ... correctly!
2008-02-23T09:23:00.000Z	Skapare	dsmith_	I need to get her turned on to Linux ... trouble is, she likes her Dora and Hello Kitty games
