2011-10-02T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baktrak_	also, no quotes are needed

2011-10-02T05:36:00.000Z	baktrak_	ActionParsnip	 quick question.. whats the use of Nouveau?
2011-10-02T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baktrak_	its a new opensource nvidia driver, some chips don't like it
2011-10-02T05:39:00.000Z	baktrak_	ActionParsnip	 are u suppose to HAVE a nvidia.conf file?
2011-10-02T05:40:00.000Z	baktrak_	ActionParsnip	 maybes its diff because im on Ubuntu 10.04 ??.. Because i have a Nvidia VC and i dont have a conf named that in /etc/modprobe.d
2011-10-02T05:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baktrak_	you can make files in there, as long as they have the .conf extension it's fine.
2011-10-02T05:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baktrak_	it's just so YOU know what the file relates to. You can call it /etc/modprobe.d/yellowsubmarine.conf   if you want
2011-10-02T05:42:00.000Z	baktrak_	ActionParsnip	 i have it.. its called nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf :)
2011-10-02T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baktrak_	use that if you want, they all get read. You can just have one super file with everything in if you want. It really doesn't matter
2011-10-02T05:43:00.000Z	baktrak_	ActionParsnip	 its had nouv black listed aswell as nvidia 173 and nvidia 96 and lbm-nouv
