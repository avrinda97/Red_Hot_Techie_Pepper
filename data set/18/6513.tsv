2008-07-18T21:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL		hi all! with what can i open a .db file so that i can read that?
2008-07-18T21:44:00.000Z	Pici	remoteCTRL	what does file yourfile.db report?
2008-07-18T21:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	i am building a kolab server and for some reason that i understand it keeps writing back a misconfiguration that i did a few days ago and as that configuration is nowhere to find there are only the .db files left where it could be in...
2008-07-18T21:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	like access.db
2008-07-18T21:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	its in /kolab/etc/postfix
2008-07-18T21:47:00.000Z	Pici	remoteCTRL	'file' is a tool, it should tell you what filetype a given file is.  I'm guessing those are sqlite files, but they could be anything.
2008-07-18T21:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	sqlite was also my suspicion but i will check, just a sec pls
2008-07-18T21:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	 access.db: Berkeley DB (Hash, version 8, native byte-order)
2008-07-18T21:49:00.000Z	Pici	remoteCTRL	yuck.
2008-07-18T21:50:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	 does yuck mean something like gulp or is that a tool? :D
2008-08-23T04:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	sorry there..
2009-07-28T02:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	happen to be there dude?
2010-05-28T19:33:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	there dude?
2010-05-28T19:35:00.000Z	Pici	remoteCTRL	Whats up?
2010-05-28T19:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	hey dude, long time no see:) do you happen to know where to the entries for dvd/cdrom drives have gone in fstab and why there are no more directories in /media to mount them to?
2010-05-28T19:37:00.000Z	Pici	remoteCTRL	They should be there, that hasn't changed in Lucid.
2010-05-28T19:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	but this is like my 5th different installatin where all of that is just gone
2010-05-28T19:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Pici	/media is total 0 and fstab lacks every hint that the computers have one or more drives..
