2009-05-07T05:09:00.000Z	V0iD__		quick question | any programs for ubuntu that can do ext4 partitions?
2009-05-07T05:10:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	gparted
2009-05-07T05:10:00.000Z	V0iD__	usser	Gparted has no ext4 there? Any ideas!
2009-05-07T05:11:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	on jaunty?
2009-05-07T05:11:00.000Z	V0iD__	usser	Hardy
2009-05-07T05:12:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	you need updated packages from jaunty. e2fsprogs at least 1.41 and new gparted
2009-05-07T05:12:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	but then im not sure how its going to behave stability wise
2009-05-07T05:12:00.000Z	V0iD__	usser	How can I do that ? Sorry for the Newb queston.
2009-05-07T05:12:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	or compile them from source. without installing
2009-05-07T05:13:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	try going to jaunty repo and downloading them
2009-05-07T05:13:00.000Z	V0iD__	usser	Where is Jaunty repo?
2009-05-07T05:14:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/e/e2fsprogs/
2009-05-07T05:14:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	thats e2fsprogs
2009-05-07T05:14:00.000Z	V0iD__	usser	Thanks Dude!
2009-05-07T05:14:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	and thats gparted http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gparted/
2009-05-07T05:15:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	but i strongly not recommend it, recompile them from source if you want to do it the proper way, dont ask for support if it breaks
2009-05-07T05:15:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	i mean you can ask, but ppl are probably gonna frown on that :)
2009-05-07T05:16:00.000Z	usser	V0iD__	just grab the latest versions from those two links i gave you
