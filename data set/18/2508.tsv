2010-05-01T15:05:00.000Z	kawiii	maco	 The underlying problem is that I'm fairly new to Ubuntu, and I'm not quite sure how to do all that / check / etc. :P
2010-05-01T15:05:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	hidden files start with a . and you can see them if you hit ctrl+h in a file browser
2010-05-01T15:12:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	cd home/youruser
2010-05-01T15:13:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	oh! found it
2010-05-01T15:13:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	ecryptfs-migrate-home
2010-05-01T15:13:00.000Z	kawiii	maco	 type just that?
2010-05-01T15:13:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	oh bah hang on
2010-05-01T15:15:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	oh i have an idea
2010-05-01T15:15:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	cd to the directory that would be / on the hard disk
2010-05-01T15:15:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	then run "sudo chroot"
2010-05-01T15:16:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	then your terminal will be acting like the hard disk is where it is
2010-05-01T15:17:00.000Z	kawiii	maco	 I recall following some guide where I had to bind some folders together and enter chroot mode without success :(
2010-05-01T15:17:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	so then you can do "su yourusername -" and it should unlock the home though it might require that you be su'ing from someone other than root that way you have to enter teh password...
2010-05-01T15:20:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	its also possible that if you cd to what would be your user's home dir it may have a file with directions. thats what there is on encrypted ~/Private
2010-05-01T15:21:00.000Z	kawiii	maco	 It tells me to run ecryptfs-something-something which I have done a few times without success as well.
2010-05-01T15:22:00.000Z	maco	kawiii	what exactly does it say to do?
2010-05-01T15:23:00.000Z	kawiii	maco	 It tells me to run the .desktop file right next to it which refuses to open, and if that fails to type in an 'ecryptfs-blah-blah' command.  I don't recall how to find these two files again, but the command didn't help either.
