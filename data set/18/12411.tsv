2006-05-12T09:11:00.000Z	ompaul	valehru	it is linux not windows - doing that with core files will break your machine in new and interesting ways
2006-09-03T06:09:00.000Z	ompaul	valehru	  /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom /home/username/gdm.conf-custom
2006-09-03T06:10:00.000Z	valehru	ompaul	I think I screwed up both versions. is there the defaults on the net somewhere?
2006-09-03T06:13:00.000Z	ompaul	valehru	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm should help
2006-09-03T06:16:00.000Z	ompaul	valehru	and now?
2006-09-03T06:17:00.000Z	valehru	ompaul	just trying it out now.
2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	valehru	care to kill one of those clients?
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	valehru	ompaul	soz...that one was on a different server.
