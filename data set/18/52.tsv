2012-11-11T08:09:00.000Z	Xanthippus		Hi guys
2012-11-11T08:10:00.000Z	Xanthippus		Can someone post an example of shared memory? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StricterDefaults
2012-11-11T08:10:00.000Z	Xanthippus		I inserted the string in my fstab but I keeping screwing up the boot...
2012-11-11T08:11:00.000Z	Xanthippus		How bout Thunar?
2012-11-11T08:11:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	paste the exact line from fstab
2012-11-11T08:12:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	no, paste what YOU have
2012-11-11T08:14:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	it's overwhelmingly likely that you made a tiny-but-important error when you pasted the line
2012-11-11T08:20:00.000Z	Xanthippus	dougbb	Yeah, that's probably it. That's why need an example, so I know how it's supposed to look after copy/pasted
2012-11-11T08:21:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	what problem are you trying to solve by changing that setting?
2012-11-11T08:21:00.000Z	Xanthippus	dougbb	Following this guide: http://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/how-secure-ubuntu-1204-lts-server-part-1-basics
2012-11-11T08:22:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	ok, if you don't actually know why you might want to change that, I suggest that you don't do it
2012-11-11T08:23:00.000Z	Xanthippus	dougbb	I already did it once, but screwed up something else and now it won't work
2012-11-11T08:24:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	what you might find useful is to test out your configuration in a vm (like virtualbox) first, then transfer your working version to the live server
2012-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	... you're pushing me over into ikonia's camp :)
2012-11-11T08:33:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	the problem is that since you don't know the ramifications of what you're doing, you don't have a context for judging whether you are making it more secure, or less secure
2012-11-11T08:37:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	best way to increase security is to not run services you don't need .... other than that, it's experience, like ikonia said
2012-11-11T08:38:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	what passwords are you worried about people brute-forcing?
2012-11-11T08:39:00.000Z	dougbb	Xanthippus	ok, the recommendation to only allow ssh authentication using ssh keys on one of those pages was a good one
