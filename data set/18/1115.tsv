2011-05-24T15:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	They are externals, right?
2011-05-24T15:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Then disregard my previous.
2011-05-24T15:30:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Try System-->Administration--> Gparted and see if they are listed there.
2011-05-24T15:33:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Then try System-->Administration-->Dish Utility.
2011-05-24T15:34:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	What file format are they?
2011-05-24T15:37:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	You could always use Windows to copy all of the data from them and then, using a partitioning tool and reformat them to ext3 or ext4, CAUTION, reformatting will destroy ALL data on those drives.
2011-05-24T15:38:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	What I can't figure is the "Unknown"?
2011-05-24T15:41:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Can't fathom why Nautilus doesn't see them.
2011-05-24T15:42:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	In Nautilus, did you click "view" then "side pane"?
2011-05-24T15:42:00.000Z	Beumac	Sidewinder1	 side pane is checked, yes.
2011-05-24T15:43:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Only other thing: open a terminal and type sudo fdisk -l     That's a lower case L...
2011-05-24T15:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	If they also do not show up in "Places", than I'm lost...Sorry
2011-05-24T15:48:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Sorry...:-( Maybe a little later, ask again here; the guys you're lookin' for is dr_Willis or ActionParsnip.
2011-05-24T15:49:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	That's important, too...
2011-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	You're using wubi, aren't you?
2011-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	Did you install ubuntu from within the Windows environment?
2011-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Beumac	WOW! That explaines alot!
