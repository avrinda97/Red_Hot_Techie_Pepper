2008-08-06T15:02:00.000Z	pen	otwr	just apt-get?
2008-08-06T15:03:00.000Z	otwr	pen	well, i prefer aptitude, but not everyone has it... but both should handle the dependencies
2008-08-06T15:05:00.000Z	pen	otwr	so that's easy? aptitude php5?
2008-08-06T15:08:00.000Z	otwr	pen	you may have to install aptitude, i'm not sure -- if you do, it's "apt-get install aptitude", and after that "aptitude install php5" (both with sudo)
