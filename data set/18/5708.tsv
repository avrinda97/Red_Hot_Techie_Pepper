2008-09-04T19:54:00.000Z	Rdy		I installed a program called Nessus, how do i find it to open it?
2008-09-04T19:55:00.000Z	Rdy		if i type the sudo apt-get command it says the latest version is installed
2008-09-04T19:57:00.000Z	Pici	Rdy	How did you install nessus?
2008-09-04T19:57:00.000Z	Rdy	Pici	with the .deb file i downloaded from their website
2008-09-04T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	Rdy	Any reason to not use the version in the repositories?
2008-09-04T19:58:00.000Z	Rdy	Pici	what do you mean?
2008-09-04T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	Rdy	The Ubuntu Software Repositories.. hold on.
2008-09-04T19:59:00.000Z	Rdy	Pici	when i do that after i had installed it it says the latest version is installed
2008-09-04T20:00:00.000Z	Pici	Rdy	Look at the nessusd and nessus-adduser manpages to get started.
2008-09-04T20:01:00.000Z	Rdy	Pici	where are they ?
2008-09-04T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	Rdy	just use man nessusd
2008-09-04T20:02:00.000Z	Rdy	Pici	or do you mean from their website?
2008-09-04T20:02:00.000Z	Pici	Rdy	I suggest you remove the version that you installed from the .deb and use the version in the repos.

2008-09-04T20:06:00.000Z	Rdy	Pici	how would i remove it i cant find it in the Add/Remove area
