2009-07-11T04:12:00.000Z	gogeta	donavan_	yes xinit
2009-07-11T04:13:00.000Z	donavan_	gogeta	thanks I thought there was one but its been forever since I needed to use it
2009-07-11T04:16:00.000Z	gogeta	donavan_	or you can use the vesa driver
2009-07-11T04:17:00.000Z	donavan_	gogeta	thats what I was thinking if used the vesa then i could just reinstall ati packages and maybe that would fix it ... it seems like the resolution is set way to high for my monitor but being that i cant see to change it, it makes for an interesting problem
2009-07-11T04:18:00.000Z	gogeta	donavan_	you can use dpkg reconfigure
2009-07-11T04:18:00.000Z	donavan_	gogeta	ok xinit just gave me the same problem I get when I boot up
2009-07-11T04:19:00.000Z	gogeta	donavan_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-07-11T04:20:00.000Z	gogeta	donavan_	or edit /etc/xorg.conf and remove the res that to high
2009-07-11T04:21:00.000Z	gogeta	donavan_	sudo vi /etc/x11/xorg.conf
2009-07-11T04:22:00.000Z	donavan_	gogeta	cant really use dpkg bcause i dont know the package i need to mess with
