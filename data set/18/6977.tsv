2008-02-23T09:19:00.000Z	Lorenzo_		Hello, I had Ubuntu 7.10 64bit for a month and all  worked fine.

2008-02-23T09:20:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	ok thanks a lot! I will
2008-02-23T09:22:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	here it is, thank you http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57031/
2008-02-23T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	what does  /etc/hostname have in it?
2008-02-23T09:24:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	lorenzo.laptop
2008-02-23T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	edit /etc/hosts , so it's the same (without the .@liberolight)
2008-02-23T09:26:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	that looks like something that has to do with the Internet connection, does that affect Nautilus and Firefox and all of the other apps?
2008-02-23T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	did you say  lorenzo.laptop, or lorenzo-laptop?
2008-02-23T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	that's only used internally by ubuntu, it won't affect internet access
2008-02-23T09:27:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	i am not sure, I'll check again
2008-02-23T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	I'd recommend  lorenzo-laptop  in both.
2008-02-23T09:28:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	ok

2008-02-23T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	do  ctl-alt-f2 , log in there, make sure that /etc/hostname has lorenzo-laptop in it, and /etc/hosts has the line 127.0.1.1  lorenzo-laptop. (use sudoedit ). Then reboot ( sudo reboot)
2008-02-23T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Lorenzo_	the /etc/hosts line shouldn't end with a period, that was a sentence ending period :)
2008-02-23T09:34:00.000Z	Lorenzo_	nickrud	ok, thank you very much, i will try that!
