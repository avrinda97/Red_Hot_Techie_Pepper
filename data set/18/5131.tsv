2011-06-22T08:52:00.000Z	hcook		ok, this is going to sound crazy. l have a dual boot machine which has always run great with win and ubuntu 10.04 and then 11.04. but i put 10.10 on recently, and it worked for a few minutes until i installed updates...then the network broke completely. i can configure static or dhcp, but my onboard gig-e nic won't even give a link light. and craziest of all, it no longer works in windows...
2011-06-22T08:52:00.000Z	hcook		...7!!! how could this be?
2011-06-22T08:54:00.000Z	qin	hcook	LiveCD?
2011-06-22T08:55:00.000Z	hcook	qin	i installed from a livecd...but it worked after booting into 10.10 ...until i did updates
2011-06-22T08:56:00.000Z	hcook	qin	the wild part is that now that nic doesnt work in windows either
2011-06-22T08:56:00.000Z	qin	hcook	Died? Check in LiveCD. Is it laptop?
2011-06-22T08:59:00.000Z	hcook	qin	no, desktop machine. checking on the livecd
2011-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	qin	hcook	lspci
2011-06-22T09:04:00.000Z	hcook	qin	shoot, sorry i didnt grab that lspci before rebooting to the livecd. its a realtek gig-e card onboard an asus intel board for an i7 proc. seems like real easy, compatible hardware. just checked out the bios and it's enabled and all...
2011-06-22T09:07:00.000Z	qin	hcook	It sound like hardware failure.
2011-06-22T09:08:00.000Z	hcook	qin	hmf. it booted back to the drive. the lspci shows it as "03:00.0 Ethernet Controller: RealTek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 03)"
2011-06-22T09:08:00.000Z	qin	hcook	ifconfig ?
2011-06-22T09:09:00.000Z	hcook	qin	you're saying the nic was fine, went and grabbed all the updates and immediately failed?
2011-06-22T09:09:00.000Z	qin	hcook	This would indicate driver
2011-06-22T09:11:00.000Z	hcook	qin	ifconfig looks perfectly normal, just without an addr cause it's setup dhcp right now. if i put an addr on it it shows it. says "UP BROADCAST MULTICAST" w/ a bunch of zeros on the counters and reasonable values everywhere else
2011-06-22T09:29:00.000Z	hcook	qin	Seven_Six_Two: doesnt work on 11.04 livecd either. dhclient eth0 gives me self assigned 169.254.7.237 with /16 netmask
2011-09-14T04:24:00.000Z	qin	hcook	^^^
2011-09-14T04:28:00.000Z	qin	hcook	np, hehe, just choked with coffee and now cleaning keyboard.
