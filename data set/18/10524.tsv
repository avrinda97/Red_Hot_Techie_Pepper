2007-12-20T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	don't think so
2007-12-20T01:53:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	when i open about 100 sockets, i can't open anymore, it drops the connection automatically
2007-12-20T01:54:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	hmm.. sounds weird..  your own software does the opening?
2007-12-20T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	here's someone else with the same problem.. http://osdir.com/ml/network.poptop/2005-11/msg00037.html
2007-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	you're not using something else between you and the network? firewalls? proxies? etc
2007-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	The router.
2007-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	But i think it would block the other computers too, and it doesn't.
2007-12-20T02:01:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	yes... I agree
2007-12-20T02:01:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	how do you create the first 100 connections? a script of some kind? torrents?
2007-12-20T02:02:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	a scanner.
2007-12-20T02:03:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	it connects in many hosts at the same port...
2007-12-20T02:04:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	mm.. I can't find anything good using google...
2007-12-20T02:07:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	I've found some posts that say that linux handles up to 20k concurrent tcp connections..
2007-12-20T02:08:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	1sec.
2007-12-20T02:17:00.000Z	Slart	henrique_	are you sure iptables isn't running? perhaps you installed firestarter a long time ago?
2007-12-20T02:18:00.000Z	henrique_	Slart	it's not running.
