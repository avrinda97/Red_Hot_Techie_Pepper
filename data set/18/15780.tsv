2005-03-05T13:45:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Not knowing how to change it without the GUI, that won't help.
2005-03-05T13:45:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Will there be a do-you-want-to-keep-these-settings box so I can press escape and get it back?
2005-03-05T13:45:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Don't have a clue. Laptop.
2005-03-05T13:46:00.000Z	WeirdAl		OK... escape it is!
2005-03-05T13:46:00.000Z	WeirdAl		After all that I can't even change the refresh rate
2005-03-05T13:46:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Let's go for the hsync option
2005-03-05T13:48:00.000Z	WeirdAl		nermal, hwo do I change the hsync?
2005-03-05T13:48:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Man, I feel like such a lame-ass n00b when I spell "how" wrong
2005-03-05T13:48:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Still listening :-)

2005-03-05T13:50:00.000Z	WeirdAl		I don't have a clue what it is
2005-03-05T13:50:00.000Z	WeirdAl		My girlfriend got it second hand years ago.
2005-03-05T13:51:00.000Z	WeirdAl		All I know is that it's a K6-2 500 and it's Time
2005-03-05T13:52:00.000Z	WeirdAl	nayfnu	how do I reapply this config?
2005-03-05T13:53:00.000Z	snowblink	WeirdAl	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-03-05T13:53:00.000Z	WeirdAl		MAn, Firefox is pissing me off as well now
