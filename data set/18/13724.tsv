2007-09-10T15:27:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	seems lexmark no longer offer Linux drivers:S
2007-09-10T15:22:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	sounds like the driver doesn't work.
2007-09-10T15:23:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	even though ubuntu gave me the correct name automatically?
2007-09-10T15:23:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	yeah. had that prob on a brother multifunction that I installed a couple of months ago.
2007-09-10T15:24:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	funny, this is a multifunction too, could you give me some advice on configuring the scanner as well if I get the printer to work?
2007-09-10T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	linuxprinting.org has a nice database. have a look for the printer model you use and see what it says.
2007-09-10T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	if you get the printing to work then the scanner is a piece of cake (normally)
2007-09-10T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	getting late here so I won't stay long
2007-09-10T15:25:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	no problem i'll try to figure it out
2007-09-10T15:29:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	which model?
2007-09-10T15:30:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	lexmark x215
2007-09-10T15:30:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	http://openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Lexmark-X215
2007-09-10T15:31:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	how do i configure it to use that driver?
2007-09-10T15:32:00.000Z	Jowi	afief	ummm, i don't have gnome atm. If i remember correctly you should be able to go to gnome-cups-manager and either add the printer and select the driver or right click on the already installed printer and chose another driver for it...
2007-09-10T15:33:00.000Z	afief	Jowi	the driver mentioned doesn't appear in the list:S
