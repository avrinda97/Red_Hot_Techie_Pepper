2006-10-16T07:07:00.000Z	npodges		i'm having trouble compiling the latest lirc. can anyone see the problem? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26954
2006-10-16T07:08:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	have you got the kernel headers installed?
2006-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	i have the latest headers, is there anything else you can think that would not let lirc compile?
2006-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	i compiled it ages ago, i can't really remember, except there was a problem with the names..
2006-10-16T07:17:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	looking for the headers?
2006-10-16T07:19:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	is the file there? i have it on my system..
2006-10-16T07:22:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	you haven't used lirc form the repo's have you?
2006-10-16T07:26:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	i'm gonna reboot taht computer and hopefully have better luck when it turns back on :-D
2006-10-16T07:26:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	try running congiure like this.. ./configure --with-kernel-dir=/usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	i tried configure with the option you gave, didnt change anything
2006-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	no difference at all? exact error?
2006-10-16T07:38:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	as it seems adamant on using /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17/ , try symlinking that to the kernel headers?
2006-10-16T07:44:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	what issues do you have with opengl?
2006-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	sorry, what was the last suggestion you had that i try for compiling this?
2006-10-16T07:54:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	something like ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17 /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`
2006-10-16T08:06:00.000Z	npodges	jaks	i hate to say it, but i'm about to give up and try the lirc in the repos.
2006-10-16T08:06:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	the repo's are ancient, and you probably have no hope of getting them to work on any recent ubuntu release
2006-10-16T08:07:00.000Z	jaks	npodges	but then again, its probably worth a try - you never know!
