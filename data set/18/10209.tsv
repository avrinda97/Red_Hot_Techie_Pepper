2007-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	justin__		would anyone know how on earth after i did and install, setup everything, and i rebooted after a while, only to find my ubuntu isntallation the same as if it were just installed with any of my files and programs i installed gone?>
2007-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	justin__		i did a fakeraid install, worked fine, was using it for a while, then rebooted and its like i was never logged into my system
2007-07-28T11:28:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	did you do stuff on the livecd then reboot or something?
2007-07-28T11:28:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	yea
2007-07-28T11:28:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	the livecd does not write stuff to disk
2007-07-28T11:28:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	no no, i did the install and booted to the hd
2007-07-28T11:29:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	i did though at one point have to boot back to the livecd and fix something with grub after i made a partition change, but i had rebooted plenty of times befoer, then all of a sudden bam, i was back to liek i had a fresh install
2007-07-28T11:29:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	odd, ive never heard of it before
2007-07-28T11:29:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	its very very strange
2007-07-28T11:30:00.000Z	xtknight		gutsy has a new Xorg
2007-07-28T11:30:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	its happened 2x, the first time i figured i just didnt set something up correct
2007-07-28T11:31:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	not sure what to say..probably some type of bug
2007-07-28T11:31:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	you think it would have anything to do with mounting the proc and sysfs while in the livecd
2007-07-28T11:31:00.000Z	justin__		before doing the chroot
2007-07-28T11:31:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	huh?
2007-07-28T11:32:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	how are you installing this?
2007-07-28T11:32:00.000Z	justin__	xtknight	i followed the fakeraid howto install
2007-07-28T11:32:00.000Z	xtknight	justin__	ah yea chances are it's something in there.  but i dont know a whole lot about debian installs/chroot/etc
