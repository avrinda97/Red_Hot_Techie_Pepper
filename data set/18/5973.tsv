2009-05-11T05:09:00.000Z	evon		i would like to set up a home network with my 2 linux computers how do i do this?
2009-05-11T05:10:00.000Z	JoshJ	evon	do you want one to be a router that has to be on for the other computer to access the network or do you want them to be independent? (Then you need a router)
2009-05-11T05:10:00.000Z	evon	JoshJ	they are connected wirelessly through my router
2009-05-11T05:10:00.000Z	JoshJ	evon	then they're already on a home network
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	evon	JoshJ	just want to be able to share files between the two
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	JoshJ	evon	you'll need to be more specific in terms of what you want to do
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	JoshJ		oh
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	JoshJ	evon	that can be done via SSH
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	evon	JoshJ	SSH?
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	JoshJ		(well, SSH and SCP) evon, have you ever used SSH before?
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	JoshJ		!ssh | evon
2009-05-11T05:11:00.000Z	JoshJ		!scp | evon
2009-05-11T05:12:00.000Z	JoshJ		you need openssh-server for whichever computer is doing the sharing (this may be both)
2009-05-11T05:12:00.000Z	evon	JoshJ	can't i send files through nautilus or something?
2009-05-11T05:12:00.000Z	JoshJ		hm... you have to do something different to do it that way
2009-05-11T05:12:00.000Z	evon	JoshJ	a nice and easy gui would be great. I'm not commandline savvy at all
2009-05-11T05:12:00.000Z	JoshJ		i've never done that... it's something related to file sharing or folder sharing
2009-05-11T05:13:00.000Z	JoshJ	evon	you'll have to ask someone else sorry :(
