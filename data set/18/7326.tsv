2010-05-25T22:10:00.000Z	wweasel		Could someone knowledgeable give me a hand: What is the most efficient protocol for a remote filesystem? Presumably between SMB, SSHFS and FTP, unless there's another better one.
2010-05-25T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	define efficient
2010-05-25T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	ftp is highly inefficient and uses 2 ports for data transfers
2010-05-25T22:11:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	fastest data throughput
2010-05-25T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	smb or ftp then, fastest != efficient
2010-05-25T22:11:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	what do you mean by efficient then?
2010-05-25T22:12:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	I'm trying to determine which is best for streaming video from my server to my HTPC.
2010-05-25T22:12:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	I presume not SSHFS, becaues that unnecessarily involves an encrypted stream.
2010-05-25T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	its massively dependant on the situation the protocol is being used, the out of band control in ftp is highly advantageous and may be necesssary some situations which would make ftp efficient, if you are concerned for port use then it isnt. there is no one blanket answer to a choice between technologies like that
2010-05-25T22:15:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	hrm, well then, moving past the vague and imprecise word "efficient" that I used originally... Which would you use for streaming videos from a server to an HTPC on the same network?
2010-05-25T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	samba
2010-05-25T22:15:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	and why?
2010-05-25T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	if you define and constrain the situation rather than you using a vague and imprecise question you will get better answers
2010-05-25T22:16:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	(i ask why not because I doubt that it's the best answer, but because I'd like to understand too)
2010-05-25T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	samba can be accessed by nearly anything and will allow access from a larger amount of systems, the security in sshfs is unneeded as it is only for LAN streaming and samba shares are by far the easiest to setup
2010-05-25T22:17:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	I am running XBMC on a Ubuntu 10.04 HTPC, and it will be streaming videos, mostly SD but some HD, over a wired network (100, not gigabit).  The server is Debian stable.
2010-05-25T22:18:00.000Z	wweasel	ActionParsnip	streaming videos from the server.
2010-05-25T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wweasel	samba is fine
