2011-06-23T05:09:00.000Z	Rexter		I have a fresh install of 11.04, the wireless driver won't install. anyone wanna take this one?
2011-06-23T05:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	getting an error is way too vague; provide tons more details
2011-06-23T05:13:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	thanks, here is the error, and log. http://pastebin.com/sZq3G8Tu
2011-06-23T05:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	what is the chipset, how have you tried to install the drivers, and from where
2011-06-23T05:16:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	I'm not 100% on the chipset, how can I tell. I'm trying to use the built in additional driver screen in ubuntu. It sees the driver, and says it knows the driver. This package contains Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA wireless driverfor use with Broadcom's BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-, BCM4321-,BCM4322-, BCM43224-, and BCM43225-, BCM43227- and BCM43228-basedhardware.
2011-06-23T05:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	lspci for the chipset, how were the drivers installed
2011-06-23T05:21:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01). The driver is not installed. that's what i am trying to do. When I had Linux Mint installed, i just used the built in proprietary drivers utility, and it just worked. I'm trying to do the same time on Ubuntu, but  it's giving me the error mentioned above.
2011-06-23T05:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	what is the error

2011-06-23T05:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	care to provide a synopsis? was this from additional drivers? did you get it over a wired connection to install?
2011-06-23T05:26:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	yes it's from the additional drivers lol, I said that like 6 times... you're helping too many people. fun times! :) I am plugged in via ethernet, that's how I'm on the chat right now.
2011-06-23T05:37:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	is that the name of the package I should install?
2011-06-23T05:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	yep
2011-06-23T05:40:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	does this mean I already have it? http://pastebin.com/U9yttPV3
2011-06-23T05:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	what does uname -a say
2011-06-23T05:45:00.000Z	Rexter	bazhang	i don't understand your question.
2011-06-23T07:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	no way to move the unity dock, just use classic and something like cairo-dock or awn
2011-06-23T07:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Rexter	or try unity-2d if that is to resource hungry
