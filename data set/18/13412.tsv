2006-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	godzirra		how do I reconfigure grub?  for some reason last time I booted into linux it took away my windows xp entry in the menu.list
2006-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	you can find how to boot windows in:      info grub
2006-10-09T06:25:00.000Z	godzirra	sethk	I dont know what to add. it automatically added it last time when I booted up the system.
2006-10-09T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	it's in the info I referenced.  I can tell you if you know the partition where windows is running.
2006-10-09T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	where windows is installed, rather
2006-10-09T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	did you answer my question about which partition windows is installed onto?
2006-10-09T06:40:00.000Z	godzirra	sethk	I did.  I said /deb/sda1 :)
2006-10-09T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	no such thing.  do you mean /dev/sda1?
2006-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	godzirra	sethk	yes, hence me saying "err/ dev" right after that :)
2006-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	k
2006-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	so you add to the menu.lst file:
2006-10-09T06:42:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	hold on, I'm still looking it up for you
2006-10-09T06:42:00.000Z	godzirra	sethk	I got myost of it off that site that was just pasted
2006-10-09T06:43:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	ok, then you don't need me, good luck.
2006-10-09T06:43:00.000Z	godzirra	sethk	thanks for your help
2006-10-09T06:43:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	there is a file in /boot/grub that tells you which device is hd0
2006-10-09T06:43:00.000Z	sethk	godzirra	called device.map
