2009-04-27T17:51:00.000Z	FoolsRun		blarg. I keep connecting without changing my name first :)
2009-04-27T17:53:00.000Z	FoolsRun		is it possible to "convert" a normal user to a system user?
2009-04-27T17:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	in theory with usermod...
2010-02-08T20:52:00.000Z	FoolsRun	erUSUL	but then you don't get the joy of trying to organize and flip through your windows all day long!
2010-02-08T20:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	:)
2010-02-08T20:54:00.000Z	FoolsRun	erUSUL	I do the same thing. My Ubuntu machine at home is my "server" (NAS/Print, etc) and I run a desktop on it just so I can run a gterm on its display on the rare occasion I need to do something locally on it.
2010-02-08T20:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	power to you... althought on a server i would use screen/byobu :)
2010-02-08T20:55:00.000Z	FoolsRun	erUSUL	I like having the gui since it's my only Ubuntu machine. I occasionally use it to try apps or test websites and such.
2010-02-08T20:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	ok
2010-03-09T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	?? what is the work for windows users?
2010-03-09T00:02:00.000Z	FoolsRun	erUSUL	is there a word for Linux system users that I could search by? I want to research setting up Samba to authenticate linux users rather than its own list of users
2010-03-09T00:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	you want to map samba usernames to linux usernames ?
2010-03-09T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	user; username; login name etc...
2010-03-09T00:04:00.000Z	FoolsRun	erUSUL	yes. I want to not have to maintain two lists of users
2010-03-09T00:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	i think you can make a linux system via PAM authentificate users against samba password files ....
2010-03-09T00:08:00.000Z	FoolsRun	erUSUL	what about the other way around? Authenticate Samba against the system's users?
2010-03-09T00:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	FoolsRun	i dunno really; maybe in #ubuntu-server there is more knowledgable people.
