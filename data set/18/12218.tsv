2009-02-08T04:55:00.000Z	andrew__		just a quick question, im getting errors when trying to compile applications as a normal user, using 8.10 and i have gcc and build essentials installed at the current versions. but fails to compile anything (even a simple hello world application) unless im root then it works fine, anyone got any ideas?
2009-02-08T04:55:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	depends on the error
2009-02-08T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	pastebin the hello_world.c and the error on compile in a pasteinb
2009-02-08T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	you're missing basic libraries
2009-02-08T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	basic headers sorry
2009-02-08T04:58:00.000Z	andrew__	ikonia	obviously im not if i can compile as root perfectly fine
2009-02-08T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	then it's permissions
2009-02-08T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	check the permissons on the headers it's complaining about
2009-02-08T04:59:00.000Z	andrew__	ikonia	all my headers / libs have -rw-r--r--  1 root root
2009-02-08T05:00:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	show me ls -la on the stdio.h
2009-02-08T05:00:00.000Z	andrew__	ikonia	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 31053 Jan  9 14:08 stdio.h
2009-02-08T05:01:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	look inside stdio.h see what else it references, one of the files it's referencing
2009-02-08T05:01:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	one of the files it's referecing must have the wrong permissions
2009-02-08T05:08:00.000Z	andrew__	ikonia	ok all my libs / headers have exactly the same permissions, but i have noticed that stdio.h includes a few files that exist in subfolders of the include directory but arent specified like that in the stdio.h file (surely that would mess things up for all users even root? if it was a problem?)
2009-07-21T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	lets move on please.
2009-07-21T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	check the /topic of the channel
2009-07-21T01:44:00.000Z	andrew__	ikonia	 where do I check for the topic?
2009-07-21T01:44:00.000Z	ikonia	andrew__	type "/topic" without "
