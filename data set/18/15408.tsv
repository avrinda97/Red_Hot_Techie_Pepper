2005-04-19T10:10:00.000Z	Epicenter		oy.
2005-04-19T10:10:00.000Z	Epicenter		Is there a way to go from NV to VESA from the LiveCD?
2005-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	Epicenter		I'm told that's what's broken.
2005-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	Epicenter		and I need to get the nV closed source build later and use VESA for 2D
2005-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	Epicenter		which is fine, I just want to see how Ubuntu's package handling works
2005-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	Epicenter		but I cannot install until this accursedly long degrag finishes
2005-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	Epicenter		*defrag
2005-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	Epicenter		I'm more intersted in 'test driving' it and seeing how its automagic updating sytem operates
2005-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	Epicenter		great :P
2005-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	Epicenter		so give up hope on ever getting any game to run in it, right?
2005-04-19T10:13:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	I dont this that's true, tho its possible that Ubuntu might not be a gaming environment..again from what I have gleaned
2005-04-19T10:09:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	I cant think of a logic reason
2005-04-19T10:10:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	oh I just read your question again, thought it said you had it working in ubuntu...there are some core differences in debian and ubuntu ... its why you just cant use anything in the debian libs..especially system architecture things
2005-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	now why that is the case, I dont know..but thats what's been told to me by the gurus
2005-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	ubuntu in general seems to have great difficulty with nVidia things
2005-04-19T10:23:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	I just built a brand new computer with new parts 512MB, CD, 40GB HDD, ethernet for $299. and it runs Ubuntu like a charm :)
2005-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	seems all the ancillary stories are out now, and people are flocking to the site...the server is probably very busy
2005-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	kkathman	Epicenter	Gradually US east coast woke up..and saw it, just about now the west coast is getting into it
