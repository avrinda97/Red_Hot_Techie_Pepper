2011-11-06T09:30:00.000Z	tauren		I had Ubuntu 11.10 running properly with Unity. Then I ran "compizconfig-settings-manager". When I clicked onto "Preferences" on the right side, everything when crazy and I lost Unity.
2011-11-06T09:30:00.000Z	tauren		Now rebooting, I still don't have unity. Just a blank desktop. It seems like nautilus is running.
2011-11-06T09:31:00.000Z	tauren		I didn't change any preferences. I simply clicked onto "Preferences".
2011-11-06T09:31:00.000Z	tauren		any usggestions on how to get unity back?
2011-11-06T09:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	sounds like you turned off unity plugin, boot to the 2d unity or thhe classic if it is there from the login and re tick the plugin, or if you can get a terminal run compiz -reset
2011-11-06T09:33:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	do you mean "unity --reset"?
2011-11-06T09:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	yeah my flub
2011-11-06T09:34:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	where do I "tick the plugin"?
2011-11-06T09:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	compiz --reset wil just restart compiz that works as well though sometimes.
2011-11-06T09:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	in compizconfig is the unity-plugin I'm assuming it got unticked.
2011-11-06T09:35:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	ok, i'll check that. did unity --reset and am rebooting to see if it fixes it.
2011-11-06T09:36:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	unity --reset didn't fix it
2011-11-06T09:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	cool
2011-11-06T09:46:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	I simply ran compiz settings manager and didn't change anything.
2011-11-06T09:46:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	when I clicked "preferences" on the left, if fucked everything up
2011-11-06T09:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	strange that shoudn't happen I have had virtually no problems other than loosing the window header on occasion which is fixed with a compiz restart, but I originally used a web link to set up the cube and followed the directions, and customized the set up more and jusat save that script it has run from natty to the precise in develpment now.
2011-11-06T09:50:00.000Z	tauren	urlin2u	this is the 2nd time this same problem happened to me. the first time, i didn't know how to fix it. so i created a new user and am now using the new user.
2011-11-06T09:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	tauren	 no problem it is a bit temperamental.
