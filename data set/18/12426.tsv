2006-06-29T05:21:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	Maybe installing libvorbis-dev (or something similar) would help
2006-06-29T05:29:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	I installed the Nemo codec pack in WINE and copied all of the files it installed to /usr/lib/codecs and now MPlayer can play pretty much anything
2006-06-29T05:34:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	In synaptic
2006-06-29T05:36:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	If you want to do the Nemo thing I said then you may want to change the owner and group of the files in the fake windows directory that WINE creates, then you can use ls -l | grep yourusername to find out which files Nemo installed
2006-06-29T08:04:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	Why?
2006-06-29T08:05:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	Enabling root is pretty easy, but it shouldn't be done
2006-06-29T08:07:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	Sudo lets normal users run programs as super user. If you log in as root then you can easily destroy your system (even if you don't mean to, any hacker or virus [however improbable]  would have root access)
2006-06-29T08:08:00.000Z	elie	Warbo	then how do i disable it?

2006-06-29T08:09:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	If you have root enabled then log in as root in a terminal and use "passwd -l"
2006-06-29T08:10:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	(log in as root that is)
2006-06-29T08:11:00.000Z	Warbo	elie	Then root is disabled
