2006-06-26T06:43:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	is there anything simply on network printing without windows?
2006-06-26T06:44:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	i don't know, but that howto looks like it's really just as valid for linux clients as for windows clients.
2006-06-26T06:45:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	ok i will look into it... so far about everything i have run into is extremely complicated for such a simple issue
2006-06-26T06:46:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	if you say so, but i am not sure it is all that easy in ubuntu
2006-06-26T06:46:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	what are you planning to serve to, other Ubuntu boxes?
2006-06-26T06:47:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	yes
2006-06-26T06:47:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	 well, other linux boxes, not all ubuntu
2006-06-26T06:48:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	then i'm pretty sure following that howto up to point 5 (included) will work.
2006-06-26T06:49:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	ty for the link
2006-06-26T07:05:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	well, i followed those instructions through step 5, but still no go.....
2006-06-26T07:05:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	can you go to http://serveraddress:631 from the other machines?
2006-11-02T16:22:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	well, no matter what the bot says, there are three packages that match
2006-11-02T16:23:00.000Z	jmichaelx	LjL	ok, i am looking for one for the 2.6.17.10 kernel... do you see one like that?
2006-11-02T16:23:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	 rt2400-source - RT2400 wireless network drivers source     rt2500-source - RT2500 wireless network drivers source     rt2570-source - RT2570 wireless network drivers source
2006-11-02T16:23:00.000Z	LjL	jmichaelx	try packages.ubuntu.com also
