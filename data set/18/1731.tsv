2011-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	i added the repo, now what?
2011-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	Enable partner repo and install sun-java6-jdk
2011-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	You need to apt-get update first if you haven't updated repos list yet..
2011-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	cool, thank you
2011-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	after that, patch should work?
2011-04-13T10:02:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	patch?
2011-04-13T10:03:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	ran into this problem because ant failed to build
2011-04-13T10:03:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	Oh, what are you trying to build?
2011-04-13T10:03:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	i had a patch for some jars
2011-04-13T10:03:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	Alright, you likely need openjdk then..
2011-04-13T10:04:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	right now im looking at a screen in the terminal with all the sun licensing crap, how do i continue?
2011-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	i have open jdk already...
2011-04-13T10:07:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	Well I just built something with ant the other day. It was missing some java stuff and I had to install openjdk-6-jdk then do 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/'
2011-04-13T10:07:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	you just enter that in the terminal?
2011-04-13T10:08:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	Yes, it will set JAVA_HOME environment variable to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/. Not sure if this is what your java source needs or not..
2011-04-13T10:08:00.000Z	soreau	luxurymode	After it's set, it should be active for that terminal shell at least
2011-04-13T10:11:00.000Z	luxurymode	soreau	tried again, still tells me its currenty set to usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre
