2008-06-12T09:59:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	did you choose the check_ram option yet
2008-06-12T09:59:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	that fixed it for me i let that run like 3 times in a row because i didn't know what it was doing
2008-06-12T10:01:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	do the memory check with live cd and then when its done ( i let mine run 3 times because i didn'tknow what it was doing , lol)  chose the install option
2008-06-12T10:03:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	check ram is one of the options originally like install
2008-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	you use, livecd 8.04 ?
2008-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	i am sure of it, when you pop the disc in, there are about 6 items in the list after you choose your language
2008-06-12T10:07:00.000Z	pub	murgi_chor	it is Check Memory* *
