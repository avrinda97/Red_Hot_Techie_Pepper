2009-02-17T08:08:00.000Z	shumba		my USB drive is dead. on lsub can detect it. fdisk -l doesnt. TestDisk doesnt. How can I repair it?
2009-02-17T08:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	you could try scandisk from grc
2009-02-17T08:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	their software is designed for just that problem
2009-02-17T08:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	whoops, i meant spinritte
2009-02-17T08:10:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	***spinrite
2009-02-17T08:10:00.000Z	shumba		<rdw2001..> is that a windows utility?
2009-02-17T08:10:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	no, it's usually either a floppy (for old computers) or a very small .iso
2009-02-17T08:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	it is the only software out there that can definitively tell you if your HDD is borked
2009-02-17T08:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	it *seems* that you have a hardware problem...
2009-02-17T08:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	have you tried switching USB cases, first?
2009-02-17T08:12:00.000Z	shumba		<rdw2001..> I think my USB, just the one, is gonged. All others are alright though
2009-02-17T08:12:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	b/c something that *can* happen is this: there may not be enough USB power to spin the drive... some usb ports put out more power than others
2009-02-17T08:13:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	the inability for linux to see the drive (as a /dev/sd* ) can be something as simple as insufficient power or a bad usb case
2009-02-17T08:13:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	the best way to know for sure is plugging the drive directly to the Motherboard
2009-02-17T08:14:00.000Z	shumba	rdw200169	i think u've a point with the power issue, although all others have been alright this particular one is a problem
2009-02-17T08:15:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	the problem is most prominent on laptops
2009-02-17T08:16:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	also, i find it useful when i have a lot of USB devices to use a POWERED USB hub.
2009-02-17T08:17:00.000Z	rdw200169	shumba	my macbook (regardless of whether or not i use OSX or ubuntu) is notorious for USB power problems
