2007-03-31T09:18:00.000Z	drew		I still can't seem to be able to fix this, tried reinstalling each package, removing, etc. nothing works: http://rafb.net/p/DjU69F21.html
2007-03-31T09:19:00.000Z	drew		If anyone knows a fix, plz tell me. ^^
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	you have some serious package conflict issues
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	drew	xtknight	tell me about it =\
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	are you using wine from winehq reopsitories or from ubuntu?
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	just dont touch the libc package
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	drew	xtknight	ive actually put in edge repository and im in dapper, could that be it?
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	definitely
2007-03-31T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	why not the dapper reop?
2007-03-31T09:21:00.000Z	drew	xtknight	its 0.9.9, edge is 0.9.34
2007-03-31T09:21:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	you may have to compile wine 0.9.34 for dapper yourself.  or it may need new core components.
2007-03-31T09:24:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	wait, you tried these? http://www.winehq.com/site/download-deb
2007-03-31T09:24:00.000Z	drew	xtknight	no, checking it out now
2007-03-31T09:27:00.000Z	drew	xtknight	yea, apparantly im allready on that one. It's still giving me version 0.9.9 so whatever, i guess thats only version i could use, wine was giving lots of issues though an upgrade would fix
2007-03-31T09:27:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	hmm
2007-03-31T09:27:00.000Z	xtknight	drew	guess you do have to upgrade unless you want to compile (if that's even possible)
2007-03-31T09:28:00.000Z	drew	xtknight	well, im gonna first get 0.9.9 back up give that one more try thx for your help though.
