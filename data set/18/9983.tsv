2007-01-28T06:14:00.000Z	xeno_		How can I boot without video drivers? A friend of mine is having trouble
2007-01-28T06:14:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	you can still boot into recovery mode, command line only
2007-01-28T06:15:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	in recovery mode you could use some generic drivers in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf like "driver "vesa"" and at least have low resolution graphical interface
2007-01-28T06:16:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	sounds like maye you need to restore from a backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf if there is one
2007-01-28T06:17:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	none what? no xorg.conf?  no xorg.conf backups with the date on them?
2007-01-28T06:17:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	oh the perils of not making backups.  Well, you can edit xorg.conf and in the device section change "driver nvidia" to driver nv
2007-01-28T06:19:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	that would backup his current one, and then overwrite his current one with the other backup
2007-01-28T06:20:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	there should be a recovery mode at grub
2007-01-28T06:24:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	can he at least get into recovery mode?
2007-01-28T06:25:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	then he needs to edit his /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and in the device section change "driver "nvidia"" to "driver "nv"", if he has an nvidia card
2007-01-28T06:25:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	what kind of card does he have again?
2007-01-28T06:26:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	nano is a ffairly simple to understand command line text editor
2007-01-28T06:26:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	"nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2007-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	liveCD?  what the heck did he do to the box
2007-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	upgrading kernel can break graphics drivers...but it should still boot at least
2007-01-28T06:29:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	ok good.  At least his stuff isnt hosed
2007-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	it booted with "nv"?
2007-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	shatrat	xeno_	Good, now just follow one of the good how-tos on installing the nvidia driver
