2007-03-31T08:15:00.000Z	magnanimous	penguin5201	my experience has been that I don't need NDIS wrapper... and I've gotten a few of my friends wireless cards just up and running by installing "Network Manager" for them from "add remove progs"
2007-03-31T08:15:00.000Z	penguin5201		thanks
2007-03-31T08:16:00.000Z	penguin5201		is it in the default repositories?
2007-03-31T08:16:00.000Z	magnanimous		I believe it is
2007-03-31T08:16:00.000Z	penguin5201		ok, thanks
2007-03-31T08:16:00.000Z	magnanimous		I haven't apt-get' ed it yet... I just used add-remove
2007-03-31T08:16:00.000Z	magnanimous		it runs on my menu bar, next to the clock
2007-03-31T08:17:00.000Z	magnanimous		and tells me what networks are availalble... before that I thought I needed ndiswrapper but turns out I was just connecting to the wrong networks, or sometimes just not connecting.
