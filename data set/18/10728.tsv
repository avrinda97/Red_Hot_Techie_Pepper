2006-10-30T08:12:00.000Z	Bokeh		i'd recommend doing a manual partition
2006-10-30T08:13:00.000Z	Bokeh		which also gives you the joy of using reiserfs (which i would seriously recommend over ext3 as well :)
2006-10-30T08:13:00.000Z	Bokeh		most likely
2006-10-30T08:13:00.000Z	Bokeh		np
2006-10-30T08:14:00.000Z	Bokeh		honestly, /etc/iftab is a horrible mutation that should never have been born
2006-10-30T08:15:00.000Z	Bokeh		hmmmm
2006-10-30T08:15:00.000Z	Bokeh		odd
2006-10-30T08:15:00.000Z	Bokeh		can you clean the whole disk and start partitioning again?
2006-10-30T08:16:00.000Z	Bokeh		just clean out the whole disk, then start partitioning again
2006-10-30T08:17:00.000Z	Bokeh		you don't want that, trust me.
2006-10-30T08:17:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	I only need Postfix 2.3 because it is essential for my setup
2006-10-30T08:18:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	Isnt that more for "all the packages new, only these few not"?
2006-10-30T08:20:00.000Z	Bokeh	mpathy	yeah, but you can use it the other way around as well
2006-10-30T08:23:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	Hmm it depends only on openssl.. It would be great if there would be a backport somewhere.. I and some other people posted this "bug" but it will that its time till its backported..
2006-10-30T08:50:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	Do you know Lilo a little bit?
2006-10-30T08:50:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	I didnt use it before and I want to know if this is good or bad: http://paste.e-scribe.com/2464/
2006-10-30T08:51:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	Me too but because of the Raid thing I needed Lilo
2006-10-30T08:52:00.000Z	mpathy	Bokeh	You say it looks good? okay ;)
