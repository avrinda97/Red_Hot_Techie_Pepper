2008-08-03T20:36:00.000Z	cupantae		ok, was that just unzip <archive.zip>, yeah?
2008-08-03T20:37:00.000Z	cupantae		oh no it wasn't....try that in the terminal
2008-08-03T20:37:00.000Z	cupantae		first, make sure you're in the right folder and then put that in
2008-08-03T20:38:00.000Z	cupantae		did it work?
2008-08-03T20:39:00.000Z	cupantae		﻿redleer: well, what happened?
2008-08-03T20:41:00.000Z	cupantae		﻿redleer: what was the output? Could it have been a misspelling or something? If you use the tab button, it'll autocomplete the line; that way it can't be a clerical mistake
2008-08-03T20:41:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	nicely said :)
2008-08-03T20:44:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	I used to. What's the issue?
2008-08-03T20:46:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	do you want the proprietary NVidia driver, or stick with the open source nv?
2008-08-03T20:47:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	the os one has no 3D, but tends to be superior for 2D
2008-08-03T20:49:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	yes. If you go through System-Admin-Hardware Drivers, it will get everything you need for the proprietary one
2008-08-03T20:51:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	wifi support is a bit patchy, but there is help
2008-08-03T20:52:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	oh, good
2008-08-03T21:14:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	why do you want 32bit firefox?
2008-08-03T21:15:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	you don't need 32bit ff for flash. Just 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree' will enable it in your 64bit browser
2008-08-03T21:15:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	I thought so, and I replied accordingly :)
2008-08-03T21:17:00.000Z	soundray	cupantae	java in the 64bit browser is still a bit problematic, though
