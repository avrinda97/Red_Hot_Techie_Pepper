2012-02-08T15:10:00.000Z	WaltherFI		Mouse / trackpad not working on Ubuntu 11.10. Used to work, just stopped working (perhaps after some updates). Up to date, just did -update and - upgrade.

2012-02-08T15:10:00.000Z	WaltherFI	SHOVELL	Samsung N510
2012-02-08T15:11:00.000Z	WaltherFI	SHOVELL	probably not related, as it has worked and works on my other install (12.04 alpha)
2012-02-08T15:11:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	is it not working at all?
2012-02-08T15:12:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	 or not the way it is supposed to
2012-02-08T15:12:00.000Z	WaltherFI	SHOVELL	pointer not moving, clicks not taken
2012-02-08T15:13:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	and it worked in 10.04?
2012-02-08T15:13:00.000Z	WaltherFI	SHOVELL	(and it is not softkilled)

2012-02-08T15:14:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	 there was a kernel update recently was it after that?
2012-02-08T15:14:00.000Z	WaltherFI	SHOVELL	possible
2012-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	 did you have to install your own driver to make it wwork before?
2012-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	 cause the kernel update killed all my drivers
2012-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	WaltherFI	SHOVELL	no, just an ordinary trackpad :D
2012-02-08T15:16:00.000Z	SHOVELL	WaltherFI	hmm i am sorry i dont think i can help you i have not encountered that issue
