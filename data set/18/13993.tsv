2006-01-10T10:13:00.000Z	fek		i toke 2 days to config the old config and i will not reconfig it again
2006-01-10T10:13:00.000Z	fek		why not?
2006-01-10T10:13:00.000Z	fek		it's linux?!
2006-01-10T10:14:00.000Z	fek		damn, one time a running dist-upgrade... everytime the same shit... grr
2006-01-10T10:14:00.000Z	fek		it was quite difficult to set it up, because this intel 855gm sucks and the dell 2001FP tft, too.
2006-01-10T10:15:00.000Z	fek		i switched to ubuntu to have a running system, but this is really worst.
2006-01-10T10:16:00.000Z	fek		why must they change this fonts and so on on a way, nothing will run after it?
2006-01-10T10:16:00.000Z	fek		it run with hoary
2006-01-10T10:17:00.000Z	fek		after breezy it won't run!
2006-01-10T10:19:00.000Z	fek		rofl... X is not executable
2006-01-10T10:19:00.000Z	lillpelle	fek	if you really want help it may be a better strategy to stop blaming ubuntu for everything and try to give more information about the actual problem.
2006-01-10T10:19:00.000Z	fek	lillpelle	if i could find something usefull in the logs, i will do...
2006-01-10T10:25:00.000Z	lillpelle	fek	when trying to start X do you get some (EE) entries in /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
2006-01-10T10:26:00.000Z	fek	lillpelle	nothing like that
2006-01-10T10:26:00.000Z	fek	lillpelle	and no unusual warnings
2006-01-11T16:07:00.000Z	lillpelle	fek	following what you have written last day about X not working and so on, maybe a fresh breezy install is the way to go anyways...
2006-01-11T16:11:00.000Z	fek	lillpelle	with 5.10 i'll get the xorg problem again
2006-01-11T16:12:00.000Z	lillpelle	fek	and still you try to upgrade to it? Or are you trying to downgrade to hoary from breezy?
