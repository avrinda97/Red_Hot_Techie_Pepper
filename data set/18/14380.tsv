2006-09-01T08:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	you installed portmap?
2006-09-01T08:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	check the permisions on the export
2006-09-01T08:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	yah, if you have it exported too restricted, you might not be able to mount it
2006-09-01T08:30:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	do an        lsof|grep /mount/point
2006-09-01T08:33:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	umount -f /mount/point
2006-09-01T08:34:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	might seem that way
2006-09-11T05:07:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	do you have portmap installed?
2006-09-11T05:08:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	can you telnet to the ports?
2006-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	do you have physical access to the box?
2006-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	paradizelost	aSt3raL	make sure the services are running on the box.  ps -eaf|grep sshd
