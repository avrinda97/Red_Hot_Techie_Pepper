2006-12-17T12:21:00.000Z	Stormx2		What should I use for compiling C++ in ubuntu? cc? gcc?
2006-12-17T12:21:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	still compiling something in the universe repository?
2006-12-17T12:25:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	is there any particular reason why you're avoiding using the repositories?
2006-12-17T12:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	I'm writing the code.
2006-12-17T12:26:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	Oh, OK, I must be confusing you with someone else.
2006-12-17T12:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	I already have build-essential, and I'm pretty sure you need makefiles and stuff for using "make"
2006-12-17T12:29:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	most of the time those are automatically created with autoconf making a configure file
2006-12-17T12:33:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	gcc -o hello hello.c
2006-12-17T12:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	Thats for C++, correct?
2006-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	same flags, but maybe use g++
2006-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	make files aren't made by humans anymore, they are made with autoconf
2006-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	Okay
2006-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	Well that didn't work either btw...
2006-12-17T12:35:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	what is your command line?
2006-12-17T12:36:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	Any suggestions? I'm not sure what I should be including as for libs (or whatever they are)
2006-12-17T12:37:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	are you using a namespace? If not, you'll need std::
2006-12-17T12:37:00.000Z	EdLin	Stormx2	/j ##c++
2006-12-17T12:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	EdLin	using namespace std;
