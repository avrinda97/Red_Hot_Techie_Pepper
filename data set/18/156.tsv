2012-07-15T14:08:00.000Z	Meris		Which greeter will show language choice and how can I set that greeter to default?
2012-07-15T14:08:00.000Z	Meris		I want to be able to choose my language for the session, right from the login screen
2012-07-15T14:09:00.000Z	Meris		Hi Guest91074, please state your question
2012-07-15T14:10:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	I would like to know how delete/deactivate "recent docmuents" on ubuntu 12.04
2012-07-15T14:10:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	you want to disable any tracking of the OS of your recent Documents?
2012-07-15T14:11:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	yes
2012-07-15T14:12:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	you can choose to do so in the Zeitgeist options, Just search for that and you'll be able to disable that for good.
2012-07-15T14:13:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	i try with zeitgeist but recent documents are not dileted or disabled
2012-07-15T14:13:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	correction, choose Privacy instead
2012-07-15T14:15:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	I try with privacy ... it doesn't work
2012-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	, open the Dash with the Windows/ Cmd(if you are using a Mac Keyboard like me) and search fo Privacy, you can remove your history, than goto the tab Files, to exclude tracking of certain filetypes or even whole directory trees.
2012-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	that should do the trick^
2012-07-15T14:17:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	i tried with privacy, it doesn't work
2012-07-15T14:19:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	could you describe exactly which steps you took in the Privacy Dialog? It works fine on my box.
2012-07-15T14:23:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	I choose "Tout" (all) et i click on "Supprimer l'historique" (delete history) and i disable "Enregitrer l'activit√©" (save activity)
2012-07-15T14:25:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	ok,  and after that you are still able to find your recent documents in the Dash?
2012-07-15T14:26:00.000Z	Guest91074	Meris	yes when I click on the third icon (document)
2012-07-15T14:26:00.000Z	Meris	Guest91074	btw, there are so many other guests, could you please choose another nickname?  That would make it more convenient for me to use Tab completion.
