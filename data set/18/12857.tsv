2006-03-01T17:39:00.000Z	Mastastealth		the installer, are you talking about when you install it from syanptic, or the installer CD?

2006-03-01T17:39:00.000Z	Mastastealth		oh ok, yea, if you press esc you should get a list of the steps, so you can then skip down to the grub part w/o reinstalling all of ubuntu
2006-03-01T17:41:00.000Z	Mastastealth		ah...i dont know if grub installer is accessible through shell :(
2006-03-01T17:41:00.000Z	Mastastealth		is it a limited shell or can you actually do commands like use nano or other command-line programs?
2006-03-01T17:42:00.000Z	Mastastealth		maybe like a "sudo apt-get install grub --reinstall" ?
2006-03-01T17:43:00.000Z	Mastastealth		ok, did u try that apt-get command?
2006-03-01T17:43:00.000Z	Mastastealth		assuming apt is working
