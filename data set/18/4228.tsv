2010-01-05T13:29:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		Sadly, the computer's original Os is failing ( windows ) and I need it to act as a live CD
2010-01-05T13:30:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		How can I remedy this ?
2010-01-05T13:30:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		Surlent77: Heh, I know that
2010-01-05T13:30:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		It's still not booting
2010-01-05T13:31:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		So, any help ?
2010-01-05T13:32:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		Let me check
2010-01-05T13:33:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		I have the ubuntu 8.10 desktop i386, I think that's the one with the most configurations; I'm not savvy with linux based OSs at all so forgive me for being a noob in this case
2010-01-05T13:34:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		I don't use burning programs, I use the built-in functionality of Windows
2010-01-05T13:34:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		If that helps
2010-01-05T13:35:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		Surlent77 : Windows can burn CDs ... I'm not sure if the flag for a bootable CD is set by a program or by the contents of the CD though

2010-01-05T13:36:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		Ah, I use MagicISo for extraction
2010-01-05T13:36:00.000Z	ejv	UnknownUser56	you shouldn't have to extract anything, the livecd's are downloaded in an image format, .iso. Go here: http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download

2010-01-05T13:37:00.000Z	UnknownUser56	ejv	well yeah, I downloaded the .iso for ubuntu 8.10 , extracted the files using MagicISo, burned the extracted files to a CD but the CD isn't bootable
2010-01-05T13:37:00.000Z	UnknownUser56		That's the problem, wondering why
2010-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	ejv	UnknownUser56	yea, that's why, you need to burn the image, not extract the files out, that's why you're having issues
