2009-08-30T14:26:00.000Z	thahauss		can someone please help me with fstab to mount a harddrive upon boot?
2009-08-30T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 tell the channel details.. and what specific part you are having issues with.
2009-08-30T14:28:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	I edited my fstab as follows http://pastebin.com/m5c363f33 and the drive wont mount upon boot, i refered to forums and the fstab man page not sure what i did wrong
2009-08-30T14:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 and the one with the issue is the last one? You proberly should tell it a filesystem type and not use 'auto'
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	ah ok, will do, Thank you very much for the tip
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 and your line is in the wrong order of arguments
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	I didn't know until now order was relevant :|
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 or its missing some parts.. its wrong whatever it is..
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 it is in config files.. :)
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	ok... ill check it out thanks alot!
2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 you dont even seem to state the filesystem to use.. thats totally wrong. :)
2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	according to the man page "auto" should have determined the ext4 file system
2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	maybe i read the man wrong
2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 /dev/devicename /media/MOUNTPOINTMUSTEISTFIRST   auto   OPTIONS, 2 2
2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 you got an 'auto' for auto mounting.. in options.. NOT the filesystem
2009-08-30T14:32:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	hehe, oh :)
2009-08-30T14:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thahauss	 if its ext4 then tell it ext4  dont rely on auto
2009-08-30T14:34:00.000Z	thahauss	Dr_Willis	thanks for the help ! ill reboot now 2 test
