2009-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	pipboy		sorry, i guess my previous name wasnt any good
2009-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	pipboy		good looking out
2009-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	Geistanon	pipboy	in firefox go to about:plugins
2009-11-20T11:24:00.000Z	Geistanon	pipboy	What has the mime type "application/x-shockwave-flash"
2009-11-20T11:27:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	i only see that as application /x shockwave-flash
2009-11-20T11:28:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	it offered for me to install missing plugins, but i do see the check animation yes...
2009-11-20T11:31:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	like when i try to click buttons and what not, youtube, stickam, sometimes myspace music player, and sometimes lastfm. (mostly everything flash related methinks)
2009-11-20T11:34:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	when i click buttons...it doesnt work?
2009-11-20T11:35:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	yeah like it will display whatever the flash needed to load, but the buttons and i think right clicking doesnt work either
2009-11-20T11:35:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	it loads, but i when i try to click play it does nothing
2009-11-20T11:37:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	yeah... its okay, im thinking maybe if i can uninstall the flash plugin i currently have and install the open source ones maybe that would have a different outcome?
2009-11-20T11:41:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	so what should i do then?
2009-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	substituting the directory? i have no idea how to do that, as i've said i don't comprehend how installing works, i'm unfortunately a windows guy but im trying to learn
2009-11-20T11:44:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	enter whats that? Just kidding :P
2009-11-20T11:44:00.000Z	pipboy	Geistanon	nothing came up
