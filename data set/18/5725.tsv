2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	VanessaE		so, anyone feel like giving hald a boot to the head? :)
2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	what exactly is the issue?
2008-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	VanessaE	outbackwifi	KDE has decided that it doesn't want to automount my removable devices anymore.  Yet, I can mount them fine from the command line.  kcontrol says HAL support is enabled (and greyed out).  HAL starts before KDE, and is running.
2008-10-01T09:37:00.000Z	VanessaE	outbackwifi	so I plug in the drive, dmesg throws a bunch of messages recognizing it, and normally I get an icon and a window showing the drive's contents.  these last two bits are what have ceased.
2008-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	is that the same drives or new ones everytime
2008-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	if they are the same ones, then i have an ideaa
2008-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	VanessaE	outbackwifi	I have only two devices at the moment, so I guess "the same drives" is the answer.
2008-10-01T09:39:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	here' s what i have done, made an entry into /etc/fstab for the drives
2008-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	never heard of a HDD dying like that but i could be mistaken
2008-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	also, if you are on KDE, #kubuntu might be a good place to ask
2008-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	VanessaE	outbackwifi	I asked there and got no response.
2008-10-01T09:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	have you looked into /etc/pmount.allow
2008-10-01T09:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	or into /etc/pmount.deny
2008-10-01T09:43:00.000Z	VanessaE	outbackwifi	I don't have such a file
2008-10-01T09:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	sudo apt-get install pmount
2008-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	that will create /etc/pmount.allow
2008-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	just list the devices you want automounted on insert
2008-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	VanessaE	restart hald
