2012-03-17T18:21:00.000Z	Titomen		ok what in the future i can get the other 2 disk and resize them to grwo the array
2012-03-17T18:21:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Yes.
2012-03-17T18:19:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	You won’t be able to use additional space … until you will finally have replaced all drives with bigger ones ;-)
2012-03-17T18:21:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	You _can_ use it without problems but the usuable size is limited by the smallest raid member.
2012-03-17T18:23:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	You have to decide. Depending on when you will replace the other two.
2012-03-17T18:25:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Your choice.
2012-03-17T18:26:00.000Z	Titomen	vlt	but can this be done
2012-03-17T18:26:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Yes, you can add members anytime.
2012-03-17T18:26:00.000Z	Titomen	vlt	any vbenefit of adding a lvm on top of software raid
2012-03-17T18:29:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Always :-)
2012-03-17T18:30:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Yes. /dev/mdX are block devices now …
2012-03-17T18:30:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	You use them for whatever you chose: File systems, swap space …
2012-03-17T18:31:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	To be able to use a block device as a physical device “PV” (an LVM source) you have to add an LVM header
2012-03-17T20:46:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Yes, because on your raid somewhere you have file systems ;-)
2012-03-17T20:47:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	You don’t need one raid per file system when you install an LVM layer on top of md.
2012-03-17T20:53:00.000Z	Titomen	vlt	but that is wht i have at present...so how can i pass-image everything into external drive and then restore if i place lvm on top of raid
2012-03-17T20:54:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	Maybe you don’t need. Can you paste your current config?
2012-03-17T20:54:00.000Z	vlt	Titomen	`fdisk -ul`, /etc/fstab …
