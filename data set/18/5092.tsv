2008-12-23T22:24:00.000Z	ruadh		I have MySQL Server 4.1 installed on this machine, but am unable to start it. Can any one help?
2008-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	What is the output of sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
2008-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	I'll try that, thanks
2008-12-23T22:32:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	I get a message saying, "sudo: /etc/init.d/mysql: command not found"
2008-12-23T22:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	Er, maybe try sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start
2008-12-23T22:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	How exactly did you install mysql?
2008-12-23T22:35:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	Done that and still get the same message
2008-12-23T22:35:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	get-apt install mysql-server-4.1
2008-12-23T22:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	pdroy80: Yea, was about to suggest that next :) do sudo dpkg -l mysql-server
2008-12-23T22:38:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	It says "no packages found matching ..."
2008-12-23T22:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	So you didn't actually install mysql :)
2008-12-23T22:40:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	Any reason you need 4.1 specifically?
2008-12-23T22:40:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	How should have I installed it?
2008-12-23T22:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	I would have just done sudo apt-get install mysql-server though that will pull down 5.0
2008-12-23T22:41:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	I have "MySQL Tutorial" book and it expects users to have 4.1 installed
2008-12-23T22:42:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	Well, I would either just sudo apt-get install mysql-server and count on most of the stuff still working, or you're going to have to download the source for 4.1 and compile it yourself
2008-12-23T22:42:00.000Z	ruadh	ASULutzy	ok. thanks
2008-12-23T22:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ruadh	If it were me, I'd just grab mysql-server
