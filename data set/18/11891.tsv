2006-11-02T08:40:00.000Z	grndslm		DanSchnell...only thing i could suggest is dropping into a terminal and typing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and make sure framebuffer isn't enabled...if that doesn't help, then i dunno
2006-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	tell your friend to right click on my computer and go to properties
2006-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	then click on the next tab to the right, he will find his computer's name and his workgroup's name listed there
2006-11-02T08:46:00.000Z	grndslm	cynical	i don't think he had any workgroups setup...i tried to enable one, which was defaulted to MSHOME...and i have to restart, so we'll see how that goes
2006-11-02T08:47:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	ah you ran the network setup wizard?
2006-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	grndslm	cynical	yup...i figured it would have been enabled by default, but i guessed wrong
2006-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	I as well. Does it seem to work now?
2006-11-02T08:52:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	grr this is strange, reboot your computer just in case
2006-11-02T09:00:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	I dont understand what could possibly be wrong though. The windows machines in my house don't require authentication to connect to me, and if you are using my config file it wouldnt make sense for it to not work
2006-11-02T09:01:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	I'm sorry I couldn't help you :(
2006-11-02T09:02:00.000Z	grndslm	cynical	it's all good...maybe i'll just start over again and hope it works
2006-11-02T09:02:00.000Z	grndslm	cynical	quick question, tho....what do the ;'s at the beginning of the lines mean?
2006-11-02T09:02:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	It means the lines are commented out
2006-11-02T09:03:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	so samba ignores them
2006-11-02T09:18:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	heres a good resource, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
2006-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	for me it was automatic
2006-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	cynical	grndslm	not sure why you are having so much trouble
2006-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	grndslm	cynical	it's all good...i like a challenge from time to time
