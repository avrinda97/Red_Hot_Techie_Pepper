2010-07-26T13:59:00.000Z	Turbolinux		Hello everyone. Where must I copy these codes to the sysfs.conf file? The codes are in here: http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2008/12/07/how-to-use-an-att-ericsson-f3507g-card-on-ubuntu-intrepid/. Thank you for your help.
2010-07-26T14:00:00.000Z	Turbolinux		2nd step codes.
2010-07-26T14:02:00.000Z	Turbolinux		Can you help me for my problem? I have to solve this problem as soon as possible. Thank you.
2010-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	it says that
2010-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	by running the "sudo nano /etc/sysfs.conf" command, you get an editor
2010-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	in there, you have to paste the text (don't use ctrl+v, check the Edit menu of your terminal after copying it)
2010-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	then make sure the lines are on separate lines in the file
2010-07-26T14:05:00.000Z	Sjors		downloading a free-as-in-speech Linux distribution saves you so much money, thus so much work, that you can troll the #ubuntu channel with 10 clones!
2010-07-26T14:05:00.000Z	Sjors		victim of our own success! :<
2010-07-26T14:06:00.000Z	Turbolinux		I know but is it right when I copy the codes under ''Examples'' area on this file? I don't want to damage the operating system.
2010-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	Turbolinux	Sjors	Can you help for my previous post? Thank you.
2010-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	this is kind of advanced stuff for newbies, be cautious
2010-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	also - usually, for files like that, it doesn't really matter where you put the lines
2010-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Turbolinux	Sjors	I am not a newbie but I am not sure.
2010-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Turbolinux		I understand.
2010-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	as long as they are in the file and don't have a # at the first char of the line
2010-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	Sjors	Turbolinux	be sure to read the first comment for important pointers
2010-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	Turbolinux	Sjors	I will do this. Thank you for your again.
