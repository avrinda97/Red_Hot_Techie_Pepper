2006-06-13T13:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	did you check the md5sum before burning?
2006-06-13T13:20:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	No, I didn't. How can I do that?
2006-06-13T13:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	md5sum *.iso, and compare to what is listed on the web site
2006-06-13T13:22:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	Two things. First, I'm still on Windows and have no idea how to do that, and also, I don't think I got a checksum when I downloaded
2006-06-13T13:22:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	Never mind, I found it
2006-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	There are tons of checksums in here. Which one do I need to find?
2006-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	the md5sum
2006-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	for the iso in question, if that's what you meant
2006-06-13T13:25:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	What I mean is that I opened up md5sum.txt and it has tons of numbers for things like ./dists/dapper/main/binary-i386/Releases, ./pics stuff, etc.
2006-06-13T13:26:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	is ./dists/dapper/main/binary-i386/Releases the one that I need to find?
2006-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	on the web site where you found the iso, there should be a file that just contains the md5sums of the isos on that page
2006-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	That's right, and I found it. I'm trying to compare them with the file md5sum.txt in the iso
2006-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	it is there specifically to check if the transfer went right
2006-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	Ok, I know that, but what am I supposed to do with those numbers on the Internet? How can I compare them with my download?
2006-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	noooooo, you run md5sum against the iso itself, then compare the output to what is on the website.  anything IN the iso would be put there in advance and wouldn't indicate if the transfer was corrupt or not
2006-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	Ah, I see
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	Sayz	eyequeue	So how do I run md5sum in Windows?
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Sayz	you would need to find some ms-based md5 util and i know nothing of ms things, never touched it
