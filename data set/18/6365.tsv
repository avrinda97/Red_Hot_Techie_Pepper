2009-02-24T20:44:00.000Z	unr3a1		hey all
2009-02-24T20:44:00.000Z	unr3a1		I am having problems trying to install a .deb package... it is saying that I can only have one application manager running at a time, but I have rebooted, shutdown, and it is still not working.
2009-02-24T20:44:00.000Z	unr3a1		any ideas?
2009-02-24T20:45:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	how are you installing it?
2009-02-24T20:45:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	double clicking the .deb file, typing my sudo password
2009-02-24T20:46:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	why that way? what is it?
2009-02-24T20:46:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	realvnc
2009-02-24T20:47:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	ok, and that does what for me?
2009-02-24T20:47:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	why do you need to install vnc from outside when apt-get can do it for you
2009-02-24T20:48:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	regardless of why my reasoning of installing it this way, I dont have another software manager running.  I shouldn't be getting this error
2009-02-24T20:49:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	ok... in the terminal try running sudo dpkg -i /path/to/.db
2009-02-24T20:49:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	ok... in the terminal try running sudo dpkg -i /path/to/.deb
2009-02-24T20:49:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	it is saying that I can only have one software manager running at one time and to close the other manager before trying to isntall the .deb file.  it gives examples as update manager, synaptics, aptitude, and none of these are currently running.
2009-02-24T20:51:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	ok, that is working, but why didnt it work through the GUI?
2009-02-24T20:53:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	hmmm might be something is running?
2009-02-24T20:54:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	run ps aux | more
2009-02-24T20:55:00.000Z	arvind_k	unr3a1	check for the things which you mentioned earlier
2009-02-24T20:57:00.000Z	unr3a1	arvind_k	thanks for all the help..  much appreciated.
