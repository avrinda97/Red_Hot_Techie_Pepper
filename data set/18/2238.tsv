2011-01-11T20:39:00.000Z	nishttal2		my /etc/resolv.conf is being overwritten everytime i reboot my computer.. how can I fix this?
2011-01-11T20:40:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	set immunate or better fix your dns-settings (dhclient.conf, networkmanager, interfaces)
2011-01-11T20:42:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	not entirely sure.. is there a UI for this ?
2011-01-11T20:42:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	i am running 10.10
2011-01-11T20:42:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	your using networkmanager? it should have an option to set a static dns, check settings
2011-01-11T20:43:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	i think i found it
2011-01-11T20:43:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	thanks
2011-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	how do i restart my network after making these changes?
2011-01-11T20:47:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	i'm not sure, try "sudo service networking restart"
2011-01-11T20:47:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	that didnt work
2011-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	sudo restart network-manager

2011-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	ftp over ssh or sftp?
2011-02-10T23:02:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	ftp over SSH as thats the only port open
2011-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	maybe this gives you a start http://www.proftpd.org/docs/howto/SSH.html      i'd check if using sftp wouldn't be easier
2011-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	thanks will do
2012-03-13T18:35:00.000Z	llutz	nishttal2	rsnapshot
2012-03-13T18:37:00.000Z	nishttal2	llutz	rsnapshot can keep track of file moves, i mean not duplicate a file that was simply moved to a different folder
