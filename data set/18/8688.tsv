2007-07-15T13:06:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		What's a really lightweight yet powerful music player for GNOME?
2007-07-15T13:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	Applications->Sound & Video->Music Player
2007-07-15T13:07:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Amaranth	RhythmBox seems bulky.
2007-07-15T13:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	It's the ultimate in lightweight "just do it all for me" music playback
2007-07-15T13:08:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Amaranth	Really? This is one of the least RAM-using players they have?
2007-07-15T13:08:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		I really hafta get some 256MB RAM cards then -.-
2007-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	there are some winamp copycats that are more lightweight
2007-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	but rhythmbox automatically adds music to your library and such so it's less work to use
2007-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Hahaha such choices!
2007-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Amaranth	It does? I had to put it in myself...
2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		BTW I love the global keyboard shortcuts.
2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		For RhythmBox. Do they work on all music players?
2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	those don't work with other players
2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	well, except banshee and amarok but those are heavier than rhythmbox
2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Amaranth	Dangit! I might have to stick with RhythmBox then...
2007-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		!codecs
2007-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	ThanatosDrive	if you tell rhythmbox your music is in /home/user/Music and to watch it for changes it'll add the music for you if you drop it in the Music dir
2007-07-15T13:12:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Amaranth	That's odd, I can't select the drive as a folder?
