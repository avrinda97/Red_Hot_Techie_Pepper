2010-11-15T04:36:00.000Z	sarem	nixnoob	u not have problem with nvidia optimus?!
2010-11-15T04:37:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	I'm using an NVidia GeForce4 440 MX SE
2010-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	have you tried renaming the xorg.conf and booting without an xorg.conf ?
2010-11-15T04:41:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	But you have the problem when you try using an nvidia-xsettings generated xorg.conf file?
2010-11-15T04:43:00.000Z	sarem	nixnoob	pls help me
2010-11-15T04:44:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	I'll paste you a copy of my xorg.conf, but mine is for a different card, and I run dual displays on seperate X servers, so you should modify it, but it might be a starting point. As I've just recently edited mine, I'm going to reboot and brb to make sure it's good before I paste you it.
2010-11-15T04:48:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	here is my xorg.conf but you will need to change it to suit your card and whether or not you want 2 monitors on seperate X servers, etc. http://paste.ubuntu.com/532021/
2010-11-15T04:49:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	Please ignore line 79 in my xorg.conf, I should have deleted it, because it's commented out anyway
2010-11-15T04:54:00.000Z	sarem	nixnoob	in Device section ur BoardName "GeForce4 MX 440-SE"
2010-11-15T04:55:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	Yes, I'm using a different card than you, you should change that to avoid confusion, but it won't actually make a difference to the driver, because it's just a name for that option
2010-11-15T05:08:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	You still have the blank screen?
2010-11-15T05:10:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	my xorg.conf is not really minimal... you might be best to rename the xorg.conf and then run nvidia-xsettings as root (or sudo nvidia-xsettings) but you said that didn't work?
2010-11-15T05:16:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	you should probably do the same thing as nived and rename your xorg.conf and boot without one for now, then paste me copies of your xorg.conf files if you can boot into the desktop env. without an xorg.conf
2010-11-15T05:26:00.000Z	sarem	nixnoob	u here?
2010-11-15T05:28:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	and you have a monitor on each one?
2010-11-15T05:28:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	which one is the internal one for the laptop screen?
2010-11-15T05:30:00.000Z	nixnoob	sarem	that sounds probable, and it means you want to be using the intel driver, not the nvidia one unless you have a monitor plugged into the nvidia card :P
