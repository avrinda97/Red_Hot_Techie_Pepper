2006-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Is there a way to find out an IP address by mac addr?
2006-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	they're not related
2006-04-19T11:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Chousuke	What's the -p do?
2006-04-19T11:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	creates parent directories too
2006-04-19T11:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Chousuke	Oh cool.
2010-01-22T01:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Chousuke	proc isn't on a drive...
2010-01-22T01:16:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	yeah, but some tools need it mounted anyway
2010-01-22T01:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	and if you chroot you'll need to ensure there is a /proc under the new root. :)
2010-01-22T01:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	though grub may not need it. I don't know.
2010-01-22T01:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Chousuke	my point being that /proc isn't "mounted" - it exists as soon as you boot a Linux kernel.
2010-01-22T01:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	nope
2010-01-22T01:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Chousuke	How do you think it works?
2010-01-22T01:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	mount proc /foo/bar
2010-01-22T01:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	it's a filesystem. it's mounted like everything else.
2010-01-22T01:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Chousuke	I'm pretty sure we're arguing while actually agreeing :P
2010-01-22T01:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	well, I guess the linux kernel just mounts it by default when it boots :P
2010-01-22T01:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	but you still might need to mount it again if you use chroots :)
2010-01-22T01:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	tonyyarusso	I had to do just that the other day to make update-initramfs work when installing debian :/
