2012-09-02T19:52:00.000Z	Jay-		but it seems nothing I do on the PC is being saved when I restart
2012-09-02T19:53:00.000Z	Jay-		I'm using Gnome(Classic) which I'm getting the feeling is no longer supported
2012-09-02T19:53:00.000Z	Jay-		Is there a recommended supported interface besides Unity I can use?
2012-09-02T19:54:00.000Z	Jay-		Well I'm constantly getting these errors
2012-09-02T19:54:00.000Z	Jay-		a few hours, mneptok, but not constant
2012-09-02T19:55:00.000Z	Jay-		I installed a few programs, configured Thunderbird and Skype, installed MS fonts
2012-09-02T19:56:00.000Z	Jay-		Do you know why it wouldn't save my settings though?
2012-09-02T19:56:00.000Z	Jay-		Every time I restart, there's an internal Ubuntu error, my wallpaper is gone
2012-09-02T19:56:00.000Z	Jay-		some settings I selected like "Do not show me this message again" go ignored
2012-09-02T19:56:00.000Z	Jay-		nicks in IRC get reset for example
2012-09-02T19:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	It almost sounds like you're running from LiveCD; though I doubt it.
2012-09-02T19:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	Or, "un-persistant USB"; if there is such a term.
2012-09-02T20:00:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	Did you md5sum the Ubuntu ISO, prior to burning it at the SLOWEST speed?
2012-09-02T20:14:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	Please see fsck, but ONLY run it on an unmounted file system.
2012-09-02T20:15:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	Also, there's Disk Utility.
2012-09-02T20:16:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	Yes, it's safe.
2012-09-02T20:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	I think tonsofpcs was kidding.
2012-09-02T20:29:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Jay-	Here, let ubottu provide you with some sound trouble-shooting links.
