2006-07-08T15:19:00.000Z	sharms	fire	is it an emachines laptop?
2006-07-08T15:20:00.000Z	sharms	fire	What happens when you disable acpi in the bios?
2006-07-08T15:20:00.000Z	fire	sharms	nothing seams to change.. I could try again.. but i believe I had the same error.. let me quickly try
2006-07-08T15:22:00.000Z	fire	sharms	i was incorrect when i disable it gets past that to the next line which says ACPI: setting ELCR to 0200 (from 0c28) and it does still above say DSDT not found
2006-07-08T15:25:00.000Z	sharms	fire	in your grub menu, edit the entry and add acpi=off to the bootoptions
2006-07-08T15:25:00.000Z	fire	sharms	okay let me try that
2006-07-08T15:25:00.000Z	fire	sharms	that goes on the same line at root=?? right
