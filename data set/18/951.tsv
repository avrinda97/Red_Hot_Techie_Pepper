2011-07-22T15:22:00.000Z	vdemedes		My Ubuntu 10.10 became read-only unexpectedly, how to fix it?
2011-07-22T15:22:00.000Z	vdemedes		I tried to reboot, but it does not boot
2011-07-22T15:22:00.000Z	vdemedes		just hangs in initramfs
2011-07-22T15:23:00.000Z	vdemedes		I get console and every line begins with "initramfs>"
2011-07-22T15:23:00.000Z	vdemedes		what should I run exactly?
2011-07-22T15:23:00.000Z	vdemedes		fsck with what options?
2011-07-22T15:23:00.000Z	vdemedes		parameters
2011-07-22T15:24:00.000Z	vdemedes		between, if I installed Windows 7 after Ubuntu(still exists) and I want GRUB menu to appear on startup. I should boot into LiveCD and run "sudo update-grub"?
2011-07-22T15:26:00.000Z	vdemedes		If I want to make Ubuntu and Windows accessible from GRUB menu
2011-07-22T15:28:00.000Z	vdemedes		thanks everyone!
2011-07-22T15:28:00.000Z	kodez	vdemedes	how did you install your OS?
2011-07-22T15:30:00.000Z	vdemedes	kodez	Windows or Ubuntu?
2011-07-22T15:30:00.000Z	kodez	vdemedes	both. which one did you install first?
2011-07-22T15:31:00.000Z	vdemedes	kodez	Ubuntu(usual install), divided HDD into partitions(one for Ubuntu & swap, one for Windows), installed Windows 7
2011-07-22T15:31:00.000Z	vdemedes	kodez	that's all
2011-07-22T15:32:00.000Z	vdemedes		between, I forgot to mention, that filesystem became read-only and no free space
2011-07-22T15:33:00.000Z	vdemedes		ok I'm gone
2011-07-22T15:33:00.000Z	kodez	vdemedes	please install windows first and ubuntu last. this is because windows doesn't recognise any file format except ntfs or fat
