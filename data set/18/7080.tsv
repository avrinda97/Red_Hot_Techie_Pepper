2008-02-12T02:54:00.000Z	danand_	hend	- 1. you need to add the lines vesafb and fbcon to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
2008-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	danand_	hend	- 2. add the lines vesafb and vga16fb to /etc/modules

2008-02-12T02:58:00.000Z	hend	danand_	guess thats updating the initramfs
2008-02-12T02:59:00.000Z	danand_	hend	- 3. you also need to comment out the lines blacklist vesafb and blacklist vga16fb in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer ....
2008-02-12T02:59:00.000Z	danand_	hend	- 4. ... and as you guessed run sudo update-initramfs -u

2008-02-12T03:01:00.000Z	danand_	hend	- 5. add the correct vga code to grub for your screen resolution - i have at the end of my kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic root= ..... vga=794
2008-02-12T03:01:00.000Z	danand_	hend	- that seemed to work for me :)
