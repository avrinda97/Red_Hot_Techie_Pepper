2008-12-23T02:30:00.000Z	crazy2be		i'm having a [very] wierd problem with xubuntu
2008-12-23T02:30:00.000Z	crazy2be		and nobody there [one active user] know what the cause could be
2008-12-23T02:31:00.000Z	crazy2be		ok
2008-12-23T02:31:00.000Z	crazy2be		i wasn't asking to ask, i was just explaining why i am here
2008-12-23T02:31:00.000Z	crazy2be		but anyway,
2008-12-23T02:31:00.000Z	crazy2be		it will boot to the menu screen
2008-12-23T02:32:00.000Z	crazy2be		the *first menu screen
2008-12-23T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	crazy2be	please state your question all in ONE line
2008-12-23T02:35:00.000Z	guntbert	crazy2be	you will definitely get better response if you keep your question to just one (if long) line
2008-12-23T02:43:00.000Z	guntbert	crazy2be	are you sure that the image was ok, when you burned the CD?
2008-12-23T02:44:00.000Z	crazy2be	guntbert	ok then
2008-12-23T02:45:00.000Z	guntbert	crazy2be	doesn't matter where you got it: ALWAYS do an md5 check before burning
2008-12-23T02:45:00.000Z	crazy2be	guntbert	so the image *should* be fine
2008-12-23T02:49:00.000Z	crazy2be	guntbert	they match
2008-12-23T02:50:00.000Z	crazy2be	guntbert	so the image is therefor fine
2008-12-23T02:53:00.000Z	guntbert	crazy2be	yes, I see. I wouldn' expect that, but maybe xubuntu is different ;-) - no just kidding - got no more ideas - sorry
