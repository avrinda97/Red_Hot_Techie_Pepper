2010-07-03T18:36:00.000Z	vaul		Can anyone suggest an application to keep track of expenses? I need something a way simplier than GnuCash or HomeBank, as they are accounting application and offer a way more functionality than I need.
2010-07-03T18:38:00.000Z	vaul		Tried googgling, didn't help.
2010-07-03T18:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vaul	I repeat , doesn't OO have a balance sheet app ?
2010-07-03T18:40:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	Maybe it does, but I want a standalone app.
2010-07-03T18:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vaul	I have ask the obvious, did you check the package manager ?
2010-07-03T18:41:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	Maybe you had to, but that's rare case â€” for I did it.
2010-07-03T18:42:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	Okay, I didn't tried just all of them, actually.
2010-07-03T18:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vaul	, check what MikeChelen just suggested
2010-07-03T18:43:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	Doing that right now, thank you.
2010-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vaul	if you're familiar with the cli there's an application called ledger.
2010-07-03T18:48:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	I am familiar with it, but do not want to use it in the everyday activity. I am trying dsBudget right now, looks good.
2010-07-03T18:49:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	You gived up with that bot eventually?
2010-07-03T18:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vaul	ledger is listed in the package manager
2010-07-03T18:52:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	I do think so, but I still do not want to use a CLI app on regular basis. They just aren't nice.
2010-07-03T19:36:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	You know, after considering all options I think I'll stick to the GnuCash.
2010-07-03T19:40:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	Why? It's not that complicated, it just contains a whole lot of accounting fearures I won't use.
2010-07-03T19:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vaul	I was being critical , I mean it.
2010-07-03T19:42:00.000Z	vaul	BluesKaj	When you want an application to be present in official repositories, to update on regular basis, have a good GTK interface, it isn't that much choice. Critical? It's was some unnoticable criricism.
