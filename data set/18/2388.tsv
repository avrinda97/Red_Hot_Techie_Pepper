2010-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	anothernewbie		Running off of a flashdrive
2010-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	anothernewbie		firestarter needs root to function
2010-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	anothernewbie		And I dont want to connect to the internet without a firewall again
2010-06-23T22:42:00.000Z	anothernewbie		Well my first ubuntu install was hacked
2010-06-23T22:42:00.000Z	anothernewbie		so im going to secure the hell out of it this time
2010-06-23T22:43:00.000Z	anothernewbie		Is there any easy way to just install root?
2010-06-23T22:43:00.000Z	anothernewbie		sigh firestarter needs root-sudo so there is my reason
2010-06-23T22:44:00.000Z	anothernewbie		said it could not install because of lack of it
2010-06-23T22:44:00.000Z	anothernewbie		Is there a root deb out there I can use?
2010-06-23T22:46:00.000Z	anothernewbie		During boot I get this error "unable to find schemea for key daemon deafult session"
2010-06-23T22:46:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	as far as i know, root is not an application and doesnt need to be install..
2010-06-23T22:40:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	root not to be used, but to be.. what do you want to do ?
2010-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	just use sudo.. dont need the root- ..
2010-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	yes.. sudo means SuperUser DO..
2010-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	and root is superuser..
2010-06-23T22:43:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	i suggest you should use 'sudo command'.. never heard the root-sudo thing..
2010-06-23T22:45:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	is root is an application ? god, please forgive me..
2010-06-23T22:48:00.000Z	hotfloppy	anothernewbie	sory, no offense.. just joking.. :)
