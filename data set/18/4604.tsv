2011-04-01T08:29:00.000Z	oosh		hi all.. im hoping someone can help me... ive had xubuntu installed for a few days and my browsing and downloading have been extremely laggy.. Everything works fine in windows 7, so i know its not my internet connection.  Is there anything i can do to fix this from the ubuntu end?
2011-04-01T08:30:00.000Z	centHOGG	oosh	try another distro livecd
2011-04-01T08:30:00.000Z	oosh		the mtu is fine
2011-04-01T08:30:00.000Z	oosh		its at 1500 which is for ethernet
2011-04-01T08:31:00.000Z	oosh		its set at 1500... which is default.. i didnt mess with it
2011-04-01T08:32:00.000Z	oosh		why 1492 and 576 specifically?
2011-04-01T08:33:00.000Z	centHOGG	oosh	try another distro livecd
2011-04-01T08:34:00.000Z	oosh		another distro? why?  i like xubuntu.. i want to work the kinks out..
2011-04-01T08:34:00.000Z	centHOGG		if another distro works then you know it WORKS
2011-04-01T08:35:00.000Z	oosh	sacarlson	1492 is for firewire...
2011-04-01T08:36:00.000Z	oosh		so why isnt 1492 the default setting then?
2011-04-01T08:38:00.000Z	oosh		i know... but it seems strange that we should need to reconfigure these networking settings
2011-04-01T08:39:00.000Z	oosh		should i reboot after i change the settings?
2011-04-01T08:42:00.000Z	centHOGG		jey!!
2011-04-01T08:42:00.000Z	oosh		ok its been changed to 1492.. and its active.. but no noticable diff in the lagginess of firefox and transmission...
