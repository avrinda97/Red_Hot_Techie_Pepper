2007-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	Anders		Hi everyone. I am very new to Linux and Ubuntu. After installing Ubuntu on my IBM T30 laptop everything worked fine. Yet after updating Ubuntu (the kernel was updated from 2.6.17-10 to 2.6.17-11) my wireless card does not work. When booting with the old kernel it works fine, but nut with the kernel version 2.6.17-11. Please can anyone help me?
2007-02-12T15:28:00.000Z	Anders		Hi Experts! :-) Can anyone help me to get my wireless card to work with kernel 2.6.17-11? Please help...
2007-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	Anders		ok, but i did not need to install any drivers
2007-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	Anders		so what should I re-install
2007-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	Anders		I have found some commands on the forum, that makes the card work under kernel 11 - but after every reboot I need to enter the same commands. Can I make a bat-file?
2007-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	Anders		Shat rat - thanks for trying to help me
2007-02-12T15:31:00.000Z	LiENUS	Anders	 what commands do you have to rerun?
2007-02-12T15:32:00.000Z	Anders	LiENUS	- these commands: sudo modprobe -r orinoco_pci
2007-02-12T15:33:00.000Z	LiENUS	Anders	the last command looks redudant... it requires all 4?
2007-02-12T15:33:00.000Z	LiENUS	Anders	 whats the name of the device? eth1? eth0?
2007-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	LiENUS	Anders	 you dont want to be editing your init scripts...
2007-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	Anders	LiENUS	- thanks, I will wait. BTW how do I determine if it eth1 or 0?
2007-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	LiENUS	Anders	what are you using to configure your network card?
