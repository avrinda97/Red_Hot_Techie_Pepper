2011-06-15T05:41:00.000Z	myloveisnick		Anyone know why this command isnot working sudo apt-get install openvpn
2011-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	quant	myloveisnick	what's the reported error?
2011-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	myloveisnick		E: Couldnt find package openvpn
2011-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	quant	myloveisnick	perhaps because there's no package openvpn then?
2011-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	myloveisnick	quant	sorry noob here how should I go about getting it?
2011-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	myloveisnick		Im using putty
2011-06-15T05:43:00.000Z	quant	myloveisnick	that package is not available in repositories, it might have a diffrent name, I don't know what you're after
2011-06-15T05:43:00.000Z	myloveisnick		I guess Im just trying to install openvpn on this ubuntu vps
2011-06-15T05:43:00.000Z	myloveisnick		but I cant figure out how to get it to install in the first place, all of the guides online just state that command
