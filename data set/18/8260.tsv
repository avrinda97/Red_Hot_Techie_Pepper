2007-10-09T10:46:00.000Z	jpastore		is there something like peer guardian for ubuntu? I found moblock but it doesn't play nice with iptables
2007-10-09T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 privoxy is the father of peer guardian i belive
2007-10-09T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 i recall some articals on moblock last wek.. not used it however.
2007-10-09T10:47:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	moblock was recommended on the peer guardian site....
2007-10-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 moblock is  the next gen tool i guess then.
2007-10-09T10:49:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	yea but it specifically states iptables + moblock not a good idea
2007-10-09T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 i dont do anything with iptables.. so :)
2007-10-09T10:50:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	then give it a shot =)
2008-08-23T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 i though by default  removeable of a package did NOT remove its dependences since they could be depended on by other packages as well.
2008-08-23T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 You may want to check out the various apt-get manual/guides
2008-08-23T10:00:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	dedi gave mw what I was looking for thanks though...
2008-08-23T10:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 you sure thats not for installing.. and not uninstalling?
2008-08-23T10:02:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	testing now...trying to remove network manager 0.7 ... wifi seems to be such a pain in ubuntu since upgrading to hardy...
2008-08-23T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	wifi is a pain. :) even under windows i find.
2008-08-23T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 removing network manager... may  be a bad idea. :) ive herd bad things can happen if you mess with it. :)
2008-08-23T10:03:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	I don't seem to have a problem under windows...ever
2008-08-23T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jpastore	 i would call you lucky then.
2008-08-23T10:05:00.000Z	jpastore	Dr_willis	I've used many name brand wifi devices and laptops under windows np. network manager is garbage...I liked wicd because it worked...until ipw support was removed in hardy...and replaced with iwl ...no love...network manger disconnects on large file transfers and heavy traffic
