2011-06-06T20:39:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	do you mean you want to enable the framebuffer
2011-06-06T20:41:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	yes, i do. i have even gone to the trouble of adding a vga mode or 2 to the grub.cfg, with ill results.
2011-06-06T20:42:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	You need to create a udev rule to give your self permissions. First create a file eg sudo nano /etc/udev/my-rules.d/framebuffer.rules
2011-06-06T20:43:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	Then in it put a line KERNEL=="fb0",  OWNER="root", MODE="0660"
2011-06-06T20:44:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	 Then add yourself to the video group sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
2011-06-06T20:45:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	Then reboot - I think you might need to install gpm to get those browsers to work. Now you should be able to watch youtube on the console ;)
2011-06-06T20:45:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	what goes in the place of "my-rules.d"? (because no folder with that name exists.
2011-06-06T20:46:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	sorry, you have to create the folder aswell, sudo mkdir /etc/udev/my-rules.d then carry on, my fault
2011-06-06T20:47:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	ahh, no prob there. thanks again guys.
2011-06-06T21:02:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	One thing to bear in mind is that the framebuffer will not work inside a terminal multiplexer such as screen/byobu or dvtm. If you use those you will have to switch to another tty to view images, videos etc
2011-06-06T21:09:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	Did you install gpm and are you using screen?
2011-06-06T21:09:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	i installed gpm, what's screen?
2011-06-06T21:10:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	I guess you aren't using it then, hang on
2011-06-06T21:11:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	gnu screen?
2011-06-06T21:15:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	don't worry about it man...
2011-06-06T21:17:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	can't speak. I just did what I said on my netbook and it works fine. Did you type links2 -g
2011-06-06T21:28:00.000Z	hylian	nothingspecial	thanks again man. everything is running great!
2011-06-06T21:32:00.000Z	nothingspecial	hylian	good :)
