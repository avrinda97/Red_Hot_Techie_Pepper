2005-11-18T17:39:00.000Z	oskude		does anyone know of a program that show the disk usage, like "top" shows cpu usage ? (i can imagine that this aint so easy)
2005-11-18T06:13:00.000Z	oskude		btw. are there benefits for root not having a password ?
2005-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	Security, user friendly, it means you arn't likely to overwrite important stuff in nautilus, etc
2005-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	oskude	Stormx2	well you KNOW your password, so u use sudo. what i wanted to know is it harder to hack a root without password, or so...
2005-11-18T06:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	Well really, its a user thing. You'll find a lot of new users just use their root account for general work, its a big security risk, as root should only be used for admin (so that ports don't get left open, etc)
2005-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	ubuntu is different on that, it has an all-in-one account, were anyone hacking in won't be able to issue sudo remotely (i beleive)
2005-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	And like i said, it stops users renaming "var" to "SUPER HAPPY DIRECTORY"
2005-11-18T06:18:00.000Z	oskude	Stormx2	and renaming "var" with sudo wouldnt work ?
2005-11-18T06:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	It would, but by the time you know how to sudo and rename and use terminal, you would have decided against it.
2005-11-18T06:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	;-) Perfectly fine, but remember it breaks the GUI System rools
2005-11-18T06:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	ignore it.
2005-11-18T06:54:00.000Z	oskude	Stormx2	but why does it say that ?
2005-11-18T06:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	You havn't configured the packages to be signed. Go to http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl if you are that bothered by it ;-)
2005-11-18T06:55:00.000Z	oskude	Stormx2	roger
2005-11-18T06:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	No idea
2005-11-18T06:57:00.000Z	oskude	Stormx2	but when "ubotu" says it, i hope its "trust worthy" :)
2005-11-18T06:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	oskude	usually.
2006-04-03T11:23:00.000Z	oskude	Stormx2	one way could be: netstat --inet -pa
