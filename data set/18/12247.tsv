2008-07-02T15:33:00.000Z	carma		The command I used for iptables is: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -d (external IP) -j DNAT --to-destination (INTERNAL IP)
2008-07-02T15:33:00.000Z	carma		Thank you
2008-07-02T15:35:00.000Z	carma		I am using webmin but no matter what I try its jnot NATing
2008-07-02T15:36:00.000Z	carma		Yes IP forwarding is enabled and masquerading is working...
2008-07-02T15:38:00.000Z	carma		The external IP for the webserver is 196.211.153.123 and the internal is 192.168.0.211 but the server is only configured with the internal IP, I want to tell the linux box that if a request comes in for 196.211.153.123 it must send that to go to 192.168.0.211 and no matter what I try its not working...
2008-07-02T15:39:00.000Z	carma		ok...
2008-07-02T15:40:00.000Z	carma		all ports
2008-07-02T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	that should work on all ports
2008-07-02T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	set the listen address
2008-07-02T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	"Listen" is the directive in the config file
2008-07-02T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	Listen 80
2008-07-02T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	assuming your not using virtual hosts
2008-07-02T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	pardon ?
2008-07-02T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	virtual hosts is an apache config
2008-07-02T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	ok - so then you need to speak to a window support channel on how to configure IIS
2008-07-02T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	ok - so why don't you say that
2008-07-02T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	what is your natting rule ?
2008-07-02T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	carma	I couldn't see a nat rule in there, you may want to use the pastebin instead of flooding the channel
