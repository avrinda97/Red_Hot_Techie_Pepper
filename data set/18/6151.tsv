2008-08-12T06:31:00.000Z	Reformer81		How do you install icon packs (.tar.gz)?  I've tried installing it through "System>Preferences>Appearance" but it gives the error "Not a valid theme"
2008-08-12T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	look inside.  Sometimes they aren't properly packaged, but come with a README.  You need to extract them properly into ~/.icons manually if that's the case
2008-08-12T06:32:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	Hmm... this is all the icon packs I've downloaded from gnome-look.org.  They're all packaged wrong? :)
2008-08-12T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	link me to one?
2008-08-12T06:34:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	One sec.
2008-08-12T06:35:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/BWS_Icons?content=83610
2008-08-12T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	compare the proper icon sets in /usr/share/icons/ with what is in there.  It isn't a proper package
2008-08-12T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	here is a proper icon theme for example: http://www.silvestre.com.ar/?p=125
2008-08-12T06:47:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	Hmm... yeah.  Totally different format than ALL the icon sets on gnome-look.org.
2008-08-12T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	no, that page was from gnome-look: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Dropline+NOU%21?content=53292
2008-08-12T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	make sure they say GNOME Icon as type maybe?  Not sure if that is actually adhered to though
2008-08-12T06:49:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	Yeah... it does specifically say "GNOME Icon Theme."  And I've tried probably 10 different sets from gnome-look... they're all organized the same.
2008-08-12T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	complain to the author.  Or fix it yourself and send it to him/her: http://live.gnome.org/GnomeArt/Tutorials/IconThemes
2008-08-12T06:51:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	I suppose I could do that.
2008-12-12T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	you need more context...
2008-12-12T07:57:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	Sorry... I've been having a problem with grub NOT booting windows.  Now looking at my disc structure, it looks NOTHING like what I actually setup.
2009-01-14T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	Reformer81	dpkg -L gimageview | grep /bin
2009-01-14T05:02:00.000Z	Reformer81	jrib	Thank you
