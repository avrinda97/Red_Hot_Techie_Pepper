2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	loz		Hey guys..When I run "dpkg --configure -a" I get:
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	loz		gzip: stdout: No space left on device
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	loz		update-initramfs: failed for /boot/initrd.img-2.6.24-18-generic
2008-06-10T22:18:00.000Z	loz		dpkg: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
2008-06-10T22:19:00.000Z	graft	loz	your disk is full. delete some stuff
2008-06-10T22:19:00.000Z	graft	loz	apparently. df -h to see how much you're using
2008-06-10T22:21:00.000Z	graft	loz	i dunno, whatever you want. my guess is you have a whole lot of outdated kernel images there?
2008-06-10T22:24:00.000Z	graft	loz	usually you're okay just keeping the kernel you're using... i try to keep one older kernel that i know worked well in case i ever need to roll back to it
2008-06-10T22:24:00.000Z	graft	loz	don't delete stuff by hand, use apt to remove old kernels
2008-06-10T22:27:00.000Z	loz	graft	apt-get remove and the package manager don't work
2008-06-10T22:27:00.000Z	graft	loz	uh? oh, because you have no space?
2008-06-10T22:27:00.000Z	graft	loz	but you only don't have space on /boot...
2008-06-10T22:28:00.000Z	graft	loz	and 94% isn't that full
2008-06-10T22:28:00.000Z	graft	loz	well, it should work fine for removing stuff...?
2008-06-10T22:28:00.000Z	graft	loz	anyway, even if it doesn't, you can use dpkg -r <name of package>
2008-06-10T22:29:00.000Z	graft	loz	you ought to be able to do dpkg -r without doing dpkg --configure first, i think
2008-06-10T22:35:00.000Z	graft	loz	what kernel do you want to use?
2008-06-10T22:35:00.000Z	graft	loz	you can probably remove those modules first... also once you've removed one or two you might check to see if you hvae enough space to work via apt-get again
