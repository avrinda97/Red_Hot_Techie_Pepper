2006-02-22T14:00:00.000Z	videofreak		why is linux better than dos?
2006-02-22T14:02:00.000Z	videofreak		how come there isn't msn for linux?
2006-02-22T14:02:00.000Z	videofreak		ohh
2006-02-22T14:02:00.000Z	videofreak		what about microsoft word?
2006-02-22T14:03:00.000Z	videofreak		linux's multi tasking is preemptive?
2006-02-22T14:03:00.000Z	maihem	videofreak	yeah, like windows 95 onwards
2006-02-22T14:04:00.000Z	videofreak		ooh
2006-02-22T14:04:00.000Z	maihem		only linux did it since 1991 when its earliest developer versions were released
2006-02-22T14:04:00.000Z	videofreak		i thought it is non preemptive all along
2006-02-22T14:05:00.000Z	videofreak		i'm running linux on 486 = (
2006-02-22T14:06:00.000Z	maihem	videofreak	linux was originally written for 386, if you have the right GUI software (ie, only as fancy as the stuff you got on windows 3.0), then you should be able to find a linux to run fine on a 486. Ubuntu, however, won't run on the typical 486 - you gotta be from a wealthy country to us it.
2006-02-22T14:07:00.000Z	videofreak		haha
2006-02-22T14:07:00.000Z	videofreak		nice
2006-02-22T14:07:00.000Z	videofreak		i'm actually on pentium 200
2006-02-22T14:07:00.000Z	videofreak		i used to have 50mb ram free
2006-02-22T14:08:00.000Z	videofreak		but why do i have 3mb after i install apache2?
2006-02-22T14:08:00.000Z	maihem	videofreak	unused ram is wasted ram. Linux uses all the ram available as best as possible.
2006-02-22T14:09:00.000Z	videofreak	maihem	hmm make sense in a way... but that will make new applications slow?
