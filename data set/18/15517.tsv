2005-03-11T17:11:00.000Z	Karlosis		Hi there, I have a plan, tell me if I am up for trouble.
2005-03-11T17:11:00.000Z	Karlosis		I currently run Debian Sid (x86_64) and have added Ubuntu to the sources list
2005-03-11T17:12:00.000Z	Karlosis		Will Debian and Ubuntu be half-way able to coexist
2005-03-11T17:12:00.000Z	Karlosis		What fields of trouble can i expect?
2005-03-11T17:14:00.000Z	Karlosis		Well, so I better stick with Ubuntu only in my sources.list?
2005-03-11T17:14:00.000Z	Karlosis		I am avid of KDE, does Ubuntu have something like it in "multiverse" ?
2005-03-11T17:14:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	kde itself
2005-03-11T17:30:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	erm it might be a dodgy download?
2005-03-11T17:31:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	you did what?
2005-03-11T17:32:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	i would recommend doing so for such a complex transformation of OS
2005-03-11T17:33:00.000Z	Karlosis	mdke	Well... I hope that Debian and Ubuntu are similar enough
2005-03-11T17:34:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	there are guides on changing I'm sure
2005-03-11T17:38:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/upgrade-sarge
2005-03-11T17:51:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	why do you want to be?
2005-03-11T17:50:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	yes
2005-03-11T17:50:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	right now it is hoary
2005-03-11T17:52:00.000Z	Karlosis	mdke	Because I like progress :p
2005-03-11T17:52:00.000Z	mdke	Karlosis	well you have to change each time they do
