2005-08-07T16:29:00.000Z	Harlin		how does one install a local .deb package?
2005-08-07T16:31:00.000Z	Harlin		when i do: apt-get install bzflag, i get no package named bzflag
2005-08-07T16:31:00.000Z	Harlin		i tried bzflag2
2005-08-07T16:31:00.000Z	Harlin		yeah
2005-08-07T16:32:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	Try searching for it : apt-cache search bzflag
2005-08-07T16:32:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	Seems that it exist in the Universe or Multiverse or Extras

2005-08-07T16:37:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	I switched from Mandrake (now Mandriva) to Ubuntu because of the lack of updates
2005-08-07T16:37:00.000Z	Harlin	Jemt	how long ago?
2005-08-07T16:38:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	About two weeks ago. But ok, I have been used to Debian clones as I have been using Knoppix earlier
2005-08-07T16:39:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	apt-get is just as good as URPM* actually. All you need to do is to setup the source list. If you want, I can help you
2005-08-07T16:39:00.000Z	Harlin	Jemt	ok, im willing to listen
2005-08-07T16:40:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	Or even give you my source list along with instructions to install it. I'll make it public available so that people in here can see that I'm not trying to make you install some crappy source list.
2005-08-07T16:40:00.000Z	Harlin	Jemt	that sounds very good
2005-08-07T16:40:00.000Z	Harlin	Jemt	give me the details and ill be happy to give it a go
2005-08-07T16:40:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	Sure, just a sec :)
2005-08-07T16:41:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	If you have: 1) Start a terminal : Applications > System Tools > Terminal
2005-08-07T16:42:00.000Z	Jemt	Harlin	Are you still with me ? :)
