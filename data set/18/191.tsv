2012-06-20T11:04:00.000Z	balou_fr		quick question on Xen / Ubuntu setup via net boot and virt-install. anyone ever succeeded in setting that up ?
2012-06-20T11:05:00.000Z	balou_fr		I tried with various versions of ubuntu and it complains not finding the xen kernel
2012-06-20T11:05:00.000Z	balou_fr		while the dirtinstall command I got is working perfectly fine for a debian
2012-06-20T11:06:00.000Z	balou_fr		yes it will - use rsync instead and setup a quick script to start on boot
2012-06-20T11:07:00.000Z	tdhz77	balou_fr	Very gracious for your help.
2012-06-20T11:07:00.000Z	balou_fr		rsync -e ssh --partial -av local_file remoteserver:/destination
2012-06-20T11:07:00.000Z	balou_fr		step ur keys if you want to avoid getting stuck on the password ;)
2012-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	tdhz77	balou_fr	step your keys? Cool.
2012-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	balou_fr	tdhz77	- misunderstood - you mean a mv on the remote server itself ?
2012-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	balou_fr		use screen to keep the operation running
2012-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	tdhz77	balou_fr	yes, mv from the remote server.
2012-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	balou_fr		screen -S some_Name
2012-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	balou_fr		then run your command
2012-06-20T11:09:00.000Z	balou_fr		when you disconnect / reboot - then re-collect on SSH
2012-06-20T11:09:00.000Z	balou_fr		and run screen -x some_Name
2012-06-20T11:09:00.000Z	balou_fr		you ll and up in the same terminal with the same command you were running - hopefully completed
2012-06-20T11:09:00.000Z	tdhz77	balou_fr	you are a life saver! Thank you! Thank you!
