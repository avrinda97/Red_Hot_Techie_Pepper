2012-08-11T13:45:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	Try going to the sidebar. All the way up top. Type in keyboard
2012-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	Then go to Layout Settings
2012-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	Its on the left of the screen. Move mouse if it isn't
2012-08-11T13:47:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	How far did you get?
2012-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	You know where your sidebar is? On the left of the screen?
2012-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	Dash Home. Again, do you see the side bar?
2012-08-11T13:50:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	If you see the side bar, there are lots of icons. On the very top you should see a gray one that says Dash Home. Also, I guess we should ask you what version of Ubuntu you are using.
2012-08-11T13:51:00.000Z	FishFace	ryan1995	Then someone else will have to help you out on the keyboard issue. I don't use xbuntu and not sure how it is laid out.
