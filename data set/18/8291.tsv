2007-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	torahteen		Anyone know the package name for the X Window System?

2007-09-15T09:49:00.000Z	torahteen		I couldn't get it to use my wireless
2007-09-15T09:49:00.000Z	torahteen		I just installed it over ubuntu... then had to reinstall ubuntu again
2007-09-15T09:49:00.000Z	torahteen		Hmm... hadn't tried that...
2007-09-15T09:50:00.000Z	torahteen		Is puppy debian based? I don't know if I can live without apt-get XD
2007-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	AncientRelic	torahteen	xubuntu?
2007-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	torahteen	AncientRelic	I'd like to have a GUI on this laptop, but at 396MHz and 128mb of RAM, it struggles with a lot
2007-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	torahteen	AncientRelic	I tried that... still ran rather slow for my tastes
2007-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	AncientRelic	torahteen	ok
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	AncientRelic		got pidgin complied and installed on my new box
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	torahteen	AncientRelic	I suppose I can try puppy then... although I think it says that for it to work best it needs more than 128mb of free RAM, does it not?
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	AncientRelic	torahteen	My laptop had 160M and ran fine
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	AncientRelic	torahteen	can't imagine 128M being MUCH worse
2007-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	torahteen		Lol, well... I guess not...
2007-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	torahteen		I'll have to try it out, that's for sure...
2007-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	AncientRelic	torahteen	its a live CD
