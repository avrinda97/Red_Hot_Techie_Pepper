2012-10-20T01:09:00.000Z	ThothCastel		basically, this time, I simple run your scripts just as you said,  and ignored that 504 error
2012-10-20T01:09:00.000Z	ThothCastel		then I typed the following as I used to type 2 years ago:
2012-10-20T01:09:00.000Z	ThothCastel		sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb
2012-10-20T01:09:00.000Z	ThothCastel		and
2012-10-20T01:09:00.000Z	ThothCastel		sudo modprobe b43
2012-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	ThothCastel		I think it is to initiate the driver    is it?
2012-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	ThothCastel		now, I remember that each time I switch the computer on I need to run those two modprobe commands, is there a way to automate that?    like a batch file that runs when the OS loads ?

2012-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	bobweaver	ThothCastel	 add to /etc/moduels
2012-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	ThothCastel	bobweaver	how can I add it to the /etc/moduels ?
2012-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	bobweaver	ThothCastel	 do a cat /etc/modules
2012-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	bobweaver	ThothCastel	 meaning that you just add the mods that you want to boot into that file line by line like ssb or b43  ect IF THEY ARE NOT WORKING that is what ssb job is though
2012-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	ThothCastel	bobweaver	very nice!  thanks!
2012-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	bobweaver	ThothCastel	 file bug I would for ssb or b43
2012-10-20T01:14:00.000Z	bobweaver	ThothCastel	 gksudo getit <name of file >
2012-10-20T01:14:00.000Z	ThothCastel	bobweaver	right,  and the sudo modprobe - b43 ssb   command would be in a text file, right?
