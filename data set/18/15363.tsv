2005-04-06T09:35:00.000Z	alle		Please, I'm pretty new to all this and have no idea what could be wrong. The driver seems to be setup properly, there's no error message, yet the printer doesn't print :-/
2005-04-06T09:35:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Using gimp-print?
2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	I'm just using "Computer > System Settings > Printers"
2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	It's the Epson, right?
2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	nope, it's a Lexmark Z615
2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	I mean Lexmark
2005-04-06T09:37:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	I only got one choice: "Standard (Suggested)"
2005-04-06T09:38:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Hmm.  Do you have the gimp-print drivers installed?
2005-04-06T09:39:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	foomatic-db-gimp-print is installed, if that's what you mean. But the .ppd comes from the Lexmark website anyway.
2005-04-06T09:39:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Oh.  Hmm...
2005-04-06T09:42:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	when I start gnome-cups-manager in a console, it says "** (gnome-cups-manager:6250): WARNING **: connect = 'usb://Lexmark/Z600%20Series'
2005-04-06T09:44:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	And the printer properties dialog says "Ready: Starting ESP Ghostscript 7.07.1..."
2005-04-06T09:44:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	I don't know then.
2005-04-06T09:46:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Have you tried dmesg?
2005-04-06T09:46:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	Yes, and /var/log/messages ... nothing
2005-04-06T09:46:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	The problem is that I'm horribly out of date.  I was last a serious Linux hacker about four years ago.
2005-04-06T09:48:00.000Z	alle	MadHadron	well, thanks :-) ... I'm trying to work my way through. Apparently there's a loglevel setting in cupsd.conf
2005-04-06T09:49:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Good luck.
