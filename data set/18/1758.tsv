2011-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	Wiesshund		ok cause you keep using windows terms, was wondering
2011-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	wait, c: and d: are windows terms? ;P
2011-01-20T08:38:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	can you boot the live cd fully?
2011-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	no
2011-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	never associated the two, but it's probably the same problem, now that i think about it :-/
2011-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	did you check the boot cd on another machine just to verify it didnt have an error in creation etc
2011-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	yes, and i also tried booting using a liveusb, but installation using an alternate cd worked fine, it just won't boot :(
2011-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	hmm, what kind and how new of a laptop?
2011-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	an old hp zv5410us
2011-01-20T08:42:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	no familiar with model number, can you give me a rough date that it was new?
2011-01-20T08:42:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	don't know, it was given to me, but has an athlon 64 3200+ (i think) and nvidia graphics
2011-01-20T08:43:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	ok that gives me a rough idea from the cpu
2011-01-20T08:43:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	have you tried by change booting a 9.x live cd?
2011-01-20T08:49:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	no, why?
2011-01-20T08:50:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	cause i have a machine here roughly around that age, and it will not run 10.x either same boot issue, but it runs 9.x just fine. 10 doesnt like something on its funky motherboard
2011-01-21T08:02:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	you migh try a previous version of ubuntu, or if your hardware is kind of old, you might try puppy which is built from ubuntu
2011-01-21T08:10:00.000Z	Wiesshund	bencahill	this is the old athlon 3200+ machine?
2011-01-21T08:11:00.000Z	bencahill	Wiesshund	yes
