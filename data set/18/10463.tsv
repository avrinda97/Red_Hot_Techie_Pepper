2007-07-27T05:17:00.000Z	rhkfin		Anyone know a software to recover files from a compact flash card, that have already once been overwritten?
2007-07-27T05:18:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	That depends. Has the whole card been re-written with new data?
2007-07-27T05:19:00.000Z	rhkfin	Nick_Hill	Pretty much the whole card, yes..
2007-07-27T05:20:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	Then no. If only the file system pointers have been re-written there is a chance. If the data areas have been re-written, no chance.
2007-07-27T05:22:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	Basically, if you have a 1G card with 1000 pics on there, if you delete the pics, there is a good chance of recovery. If you then write over the whole card with 1G data, the original data is lost ... forever.
2007-07-27T05:28:00.000Z	rhkfin	Nick_Hill	Hmm.. I see that if it's been overwritten, recovery gets a lot more difficult. But how about the image bank. I saw it copying the images there, but later I wasn't able to find the files, so I suspect that it stopped (=didn't write the allocation table) because of low batteries.
2007-07-27T05:30:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	If the files are really important, and have been written to media, bit not overwritten, there is a good chance of recovery. Whether that media is your hard drive or a pen drive.
2007-07-27T05:30:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	I suppose there are utilities which can scan media for Jpeg headers then interpret file ends.
2007-07-27T05:30:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	which will spit the results as jpegs.
2007-07-27T05:32:00.000Z	rhkfin	Nick_Hill	the media is a 2.5" hard drive. And the files are NEF files, not JPG:s so it makes it a bit more difficult.. (NEF = Nicon Raw)
2007-07-27T05:33:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	How important is it to recover them?
2007-07-27T05:33:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	Are we talking thousands of Dollars/Pounds?
2007-07-27T05:34:00.000Z	rhkfin	Nick_Hill	No, only two days of holiday photos (volcano w. lava etc...). So would be nice to have them, if possible, but..
2007-07-27T05:35:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	In that case, open sample raw files with hexedit. See if they have some identifiable start/end. Then point hexedit at your hard drive, search for strings.
2007-07-27T05:37:00.000Z	rhkfin	Nick_Hill	Thanks.. Does nano/kate work as a HEX editor? what would?
2007-07-27T05:39:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	sudo sptitude install hexedit. At command line hexedit
2007-07-27T05:39:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	rhkfin	sudo aptitude install hexedit.
2007-07-27T05:40:00.000Z	rhkfin	Nick_Hill	thanks1
