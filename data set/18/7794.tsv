2007-11-16T12:48:00.000Z	ianloic_		hey, I think the most recent gutsy kernel broke my sound
2007-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	ianloic_		is there an apt repo I can point at with old version?
2007-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	ianloic_		I remember debian had some special repo with everything that was ever built but I can't find that
2007-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	ianloic_		and launchpad confuses me
2007-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	you dont wanna do that
2007-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	many ppl have had some issues with gutsy and sound, it is fixable tho, search ubuntuforums.org
2007-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	ianloic_	Evanlec	whynot? It used to work and now it doesn't - I'd like to be able to narrow it down
2007-11-16T12:50:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	going back to an older kernel would be more of a headache i think
2007-11-16T12:50:00.000Z	ianloic_	Evanlec	yes, but I don't feel like manually installing things - that sucks for maintainance
2007-11-16T12:50:00.000Z	ianloic_	Evanlec	it shouldn't be - there was an older gutsy one
2007-11-16T12:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	manually installing a kernel probably sucks for maintainence i imagine
2007-11-16T12:51:00.000Z	ianloic_	Evanlec	is there nowhere to to get older kernels?
2007-11-16T12:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	its probably not even the kernel
2007-11-16T12:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	trust me, many ppl had this problem with gutsy, search the forums, the solution is not to downgrade kernel
2007-11-16T12:52:00.000Z	ianloic_	Evanlec	I just want to restore my machine to its previous, working state
2007-11-16T12:52:00.000Z	ianloic_		anyhoo
2007-11-16T12:52:00.000Z	ianloic_		I'll look elsewhere
2007-11-16T12:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	ianloic_	then clean install feisty
