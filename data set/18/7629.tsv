2007-12-18T22:28:00.000Z	white_eagle		can I easily switch between GNOME and KDE when both of them are installed?
2007-12-18T22:28:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	yes, in your login screen
2007-12-20T04:28:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	ask in #ubuntu-ops
2007-12-20T04:38:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	how did you obtain google earth?
2007-12-20T04:39:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	bad idea. i'd rather use the package in Medibuntu.
2008-01-02T00:30:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	gksudo file-roller, and be careful
2008-01-02T00:34:00.000Z	white_eagle	LjL	thanks that solved my problem
2008-01-11T01:29:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	still, don't use the bot in the channel if you just need to look up information for yourself.
2008-01-16T01:11:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	err, and who told you to use the drivers from ati.com? we support what is in the repos.
2008-01-16T01:11:00.000Z	white_eagle	LjL	you didn't left me to type what's left, I want to rollback to the repos' drivers
2008-01-16T01:12:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	well, that might not necessarily be easy to achieve.
2008-01-16T01:12:00.000Z	white_eagle	LjL	can you generally give me an advice?
2008-01-16T01:13:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	well, uninstall the ati.com one (i hope they come with instructions!), and then install xorg-driver-fglrx
2008-01-23T20:18:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	there is #test, there is the command /PING server (to be done in the server window), you can /cs help...
2008-01-23T20:18:00.000Z	white_eagle	LjL	sorry
2008-03-31T02:39:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	yes, you can. right click on the panel, add applet, it's called menu or something.
2008-03-31T02:40:00.000Z	white_eagle	LjL	I didn't get you, I was trying to say that I have the applications, places and system launchers, and I want them in one
2008-03-31T02:41:00.000Z	LjL	white_eagle	yes, i think there is an alternative applet you can use that doesn't have those three menus. i don't remember how it's called, as i'm not a GNOME user.
