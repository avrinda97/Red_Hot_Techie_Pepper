2010-09-02T16:19:00.000Z	Aldus		Hi. Trying to finally migrate to Linux from Win XP, I started with a standard Ubuntu release. Which email client you advice to replace Outlook? I'll need to import all my mail folders and stuff
2010-09-02T16:19:00.000Z	Aldus		cool. Thanks
2010-09-02T16:20:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	i believe thunderbird is from mozilla, where firefox browser comes from..
2010-09-02T16:54:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	you looked into WAMPServer 2?  open source windows based lamp package
2010-09-02T16:55:00.000Z	Aldus	itsux2bu	I always used Wamp
2010-09-02T16:55:00.000Z	Aldus	itsux2bu	I want to turn off Win forever
2010-09-02T16:56:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	you ever tried Virtualbox?
2010-09-02T16:58:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	we really can't those questions..
2010-09-02T16:59:00.000Z	Aldus	itsux2bu	I think those are honest questions for a newbie
2010-09-02T16:59:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	ubuntu is a great distro to start with..
2010-09-02T17:00:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	look.. there are 1300+ people is this channel.. ubuntu is THE most downloaded version of *nix
2010-09-02T17:02:00.000Z	Aldus	itsux2bu	I know, that's why it's my distro of choice for starting, I just was curious about those points that someone digged out in the linux channel
2010-09-02T17:02:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	i been running ubuntu in a virtual machine program called virtualbox.. the other day .. my vista system locked up bad.. but virtualbox and ubuntu keep going non-stop..
2010-09-02T17:03:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	battery live has too many variables to track.. i don't own a laptop.. battery life depends on what is running
2010-09-02T17:03:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	i doubt you'll have to reinstall many times
2010-09-02T17:03:00.000Z	Aldus	itsux2bu	ok I guess much is about configuration
2010-09-02T17:03:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	but again i can't say from experience..
2010-09-02T17:05:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Aldus	there are at least 2 ways to try out ubuntu temporilly.. before converting completely
