2006-03-29T13:41:00.000Z	valentinos		hi
2006-03-29T13:42:00.000Z	valentinos		i have a small problem with NFS anyone familiar with the system ?
2006-03-29T13:43:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	describe your problem
2006-03-29T13:43:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	whatever i do i cant get write permisions to the shares
2006-03-29T13:45:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	I know the problem. I'm sure mine is not the clean solution, but I share the dirs with the no_root_squash option and mount them as root (from fstab) on the target system
2006-03-29T13:45:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	thanks i will try it now
2006-03-29T13:52:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	/share  (no_root_squash,rw,nohide)   <-- this is the line inside exports ~ ## 192.168.1.100:/share  /share  nfs  suid,dev,exec  0  0 #  and this is inside fstab can u see anything wrong ?
2006-03-29T13:53:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	in exports, specify the host of the target like so: '/share  192.168.1.101(no_root_squash,rw,nohide)'
2006-03-29T13:56:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	same error
2006-03-29T13:57:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	you have to make your nfs server reload /etc/exports. Have you done that?
2006-03-29T13:58:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	i Seriously think to try smb now :)
2006-03-29T13:59:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	it is a bit difficult getting NFS to do what you want, but I don't find SMB easy either.
2006-03-29T14:01:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	one small detaill my shared directories and linked directories are created and have as owner the root, and full permisions. can this be a problem ?
2006-03-29T14:02:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	I don't think it would.
2006-03-29T14:03:00.000Z	valentinos	soundray	thanks   i will try google again  to see if i am lucky thanks again
2006-03-29T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	a good wiki page on NFS sharing in Ubuntu seems to be missing. When you've had success, please write one.
2006-03-29T14:06:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	oops
2006-03-29T14:06:00.000Z	soundray	valentinos	search the wiki for NFSClientHowTo and NFSServerHowTo. Maybe that'lll help :)
