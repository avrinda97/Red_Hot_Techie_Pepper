2011-08-11T03:01:00.000Z	Mithadon		ok im trying one more time... as a newcomer to linux, should I get ubuntu 10.04 or 10.10?
2011-08-11T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	gra natty, the later drivers may help
2011-08-11T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	grab natty
2011-08-11T03:03:00.000Z	Mithadon	ActionParsnip	what is natty?
2011-08-11T03:04:00.000Z	Mithadon	ActionParsnip	ah, I've just tried 11.04 both 32 and 64 with usb and cd, can't get into setup ever on my laptop. devices are no longer detected, freezes with cd, blah
2011-08-11T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	2d or 3d?
2011-08-11T03:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	unity is in PPA for Lucid
2011-08-11T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	free space to / formatted ext4   with the same amount of space as you have ram for swap (I assume you have more than 2Gb RAM)
2011-08-11T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	use custom partitioning
2011-08-11T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	3Gb swap, the rest for / formatted ext4.   Will that give you 3 partitions?
2011-08-11T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	11Gb is plenty
2011-08-11T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	how many NTFS partitions do you have?
2011-08-11T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	then make the space you freed up into an xtended partition
2011-08-11T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	then make your Ubuntu partitions in that
2011-08-11T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	you can only have 4 primary partitions OR 3 (or fewer) primary partitions and an extended partition
2011-08-11T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	make all the partitions you make be logical
2011-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	run:  sudo lshw -C network    what is the product name for the wireless
2011-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mithadon	also, use a wired connection and get full updates
