2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	h3h_timo		thank you
2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	h3h_timo		!frostwire
2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	h3h_timo		is frostwire better than limewire?
2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	feels faster here
2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	yes
2006-05-18T15:12:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	how'd you install java?
2006-05-18T15:13:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	then try sudo update-alternatives --config java , that should be the final step
2006-05-18T15:14:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	what does java -version say?
2006-05-18T15:15:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	you didn't choose the right java, then. Look for the one that says sun (should be 3rd)
2006-05-18T15:19:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	apt-cache policy sun-jre1.5 , that should show installed if you did the steps right
2006-05-21T06:15:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	sudo -i
2006-05-26T13:43:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	sudo apt-get remove libqt3-mt will do about 99% of it
2006-05-26T13:44:00.000Z	h3h_timo	nickrud	thanks
2006-05-26T13:44:00.000Z	h3h_timo	nickrud	what wont it remove?
2006-05-26T13:44:00.000Z	nickrud	h3h_timo	arts for one, if you have it installed.
2006-05-26T13:45:00.000Z	h3h_timo	nickrud	what is arts?
2006-05-26T13:46:00.000Z	h3h_timo	nickrud	thanks
