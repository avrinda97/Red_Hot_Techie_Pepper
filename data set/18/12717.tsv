2009-02-11T09:35:00.000Z	russ5811		anyone know how to configure virtual box so it can connect to a device via the ethernet port (example powerline switch or router) for configuration?
2009-02-11T09:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	virtual box assumes you have a different OS loaded in it like windows.  if windows is loaded and can access the internet you should be able to reach the router with the router ip address..
2009-02-11T09:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	why not plug the eternet switch into the router and access it through that.. should have it's own unique address.
2009-02-11T09:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	what's a powerline switch?
2009-02-11T09:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	ah.. so really it should be hooked up to the router (I'm thinking)
2009-02-11T09:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	do the instructions give you a unique ip address for accessing it?
2009-02-11T09:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	ah ok.. I get it .. you're computer won't actually "see" it in the classic sense.. it should be invisible to the computer.. just a connection to the router.. if you're not connecting to the router through the powerline adaptors then there may be some additional setup on the initial adaptor that plugs into the main router.
2009-02-11T09:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	so on the main adaptor plugged into the router.. does that have a unique IP address for setup?
2009-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	do you have to configure each powerline adaptor used for each computer?
2009-02-11T09:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	is there a program that installs on windows for configuration?
2009-02-11T09:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	I mean .. is there software that has to be installed on windows to program the adaptor?
2009-02-11T09:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	could be a win7 problem.. firewall.. permissions etc.. if you can take that same machine directly to the router and win7 can make a connection to the internet through the linux host then the adaptor should also be seen.. make sense?
2009-02-11T09:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	yep.. do you have more than one adaptor?  if so make a switch and see if the adaptor just has an issue.
2009-02-11T09:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	np.. good luck.. I just wish they didn't have propriatory software like that. drives me nuts.
2009-02-11T09:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	bitter.. sp?
2009-02-11T09:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	schuss?
2009-02-11T09:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	it's been a lot of years but I lived in deutchland for 3 years in my late teens and early 20's
2009-02-11T09:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	russ5811	ah.. Ein Mass Bitte.. =  Ein beer bitte
