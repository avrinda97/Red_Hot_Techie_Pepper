2011-01-20T00:42:00.000Z	nishttal2		is it possible that the postfix/smtp can bring down the whole server
2011-01-20T00:42:00.000Z	Pici	nishttal2	Elaborate.
2011-01-20T00:43:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	i am looking at the logs and this process has been trying to send an email since morning unsuccessfully and then the server decided to reboot
2011-01-20T00:43:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	i am trying to figure out why it rebooted
2011-01-20T00:43:00.000Z	Pici	nishttal2	Thats definitely not normal.
2011-01-20T00:52:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	i am lost how would you investigate an unexpected server reboot
2011-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	why would an update break firefox
2011-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	Pici	nishttal2	When did the update happen?
2011-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	yesterday
2011-01-20T19:54:00.000Z	Pici	nishttal2	Which version of firefox are you using?
2011-01-20T19:54:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	3.6.13
2011-01-20T19:55:00.000Z	Pici	nishttal2	I don't see any recent updates to that package.  3.6.13+build3+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1 was published 6 weeks ago.
2011-01-20T19:55:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	it may have messed up the flash player plugin
2011-01-20T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	nishttal2	I don't see anything for that package either.  Do you have issues if you boot from an older kernel?
2011-01-20T20:00:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	i havent tried booting in the old kernel yet
2011-01-20T20:03:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	i just noticed that when this happens a process called plugin-container takes up 100% of the CPU
2011-01-20T20:03:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	any insights?
2011-09-09T20:43:00.000Z	nishttal2	Pici	just making sure if there is different forum for Macbook + Ubuntu
