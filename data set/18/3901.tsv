2009-07-10T02:29:00.000Z	Bullaro		If I try to install Ubuntu(8.04 or 9.04) I get a problem when its on 9% with formatting
2009-07-10T02:30:00.000Z	Bullaro		 If I try to install Ubuntu(8.04 or 9.04) I get a problem when its on 9% with formatting... For some reason it gives an error with the disc and/or the drive
2009-07-10T02:31:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	sounds like a hardware problem... Could you md5 check the iso... just to be sure?
2009-07-10T02:39:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	how much ram do you have? Are you using the alternate cd?
2009-07-10T02:44:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	I would suggest md5 checking the cd and if it's ok... Try the alternate cd... That might help...
2009-07-10T02:46:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	error? I thought you said it gets stuck...
2009-07-10T02:46:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	What is the error?
2009-07-10T02:47:00.000Z	Bullaro	Kalmi_	Yeah it gives like an error window while formatting
2009-07-10T02:47:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	what does it say?
2009-07-10T02:47:00.000Z	Bullaro	Kalmi_	I said : If I try to install Ubuntu(8.04 or 9.04) I get a problem when its on 9% with formatting... For some reason it gives an error with the disc and/or the drive
2009-07-10T02:48:00.000Z	Kalmi_	Bullaro	What is the exact error? or is it a general error?
2009-07-10T02:49:00.000Z	Bullaro	Kalmi_	I need to start the installation all over again :P... need to get another monitor and
2009-07-10T02:50:00.000Z	Bullaro	Kalmi_	Could we go private? wouldnt be able to find your chat if I have to run upstairs and restart the install
