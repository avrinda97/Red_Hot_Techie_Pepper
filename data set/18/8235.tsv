2009-03-10T05:15:00.000Z	kennethr		how do I change the resolution of the login screen for ubuntu?
2009-03-10T05:16:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	have you tried simply setting the resolution of your desktop?
2009-03-10T05:16:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	yes
2009-03-10T05:16:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	it works after I log in, but every other GUI thing before that is different resolution.
2009-03-10T05:17:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	I have the desktop where I want it...but the boot progress indicator is wrong resolution, and login screen is a little off
2009-03-10T05:17:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	I guess it would work if you wrote the resolution in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-03-10T05:17:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	what would the entry look like and where would it go?
2009-03-10T05:17:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	but that's not a very user friendly solution I guess
2009-03-10T05:17:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	right
2009-03-10T05:18:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	I don't know at the moment, I don't use those settings anymore either

2009-03-10T05:19:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	trying thast
2009-03-10T05:19:00.000Z	kennethr		*that*
2009-03-10T05:20:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	brb
2009-03-10T05:20:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	no, that's probably not what you want
2009-03-10T05:20:00.000Z	kennethr	theclaw	what is it?
2009-03-10T05:20:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	it affects the resolution of the boot splash (the "progress bar")
2009-03-10T05:22:00.000Z	theclaw	kennethr	you might have to adjust your xorg config, but that's not too complicated
