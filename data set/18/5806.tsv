2008-08-19T18:59:00.000Z	relinker		i am running ubuntu haardy on my thinkpad r52 and everytime I play a flash movie my laptop overheats and shuts down. Can some one help?
2008-08-19T19:00:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	do you have lm-sensors installed?
2008-08-19T19:00:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	checking
2008-08-19T19:01:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	Yes I do - lms-ensors is the latest version.
2008-08-19T19:01:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	have you checked the fans in the laptop? they may need to be replaced.
2008-08-19T19:02:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	Yes - my fans are fine I opened and checked. Also cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan shows the speed and is set to auto
2008-08-19T19:02:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	is there a way to increase or keep constant the speed of the fan?
2008-08-19T19:04:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	There are a set of registers I can "tee" with specific values to control fan speed. But I would rather not. Is there aany other solution?
2008-08-19T19:06:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	Why does flash stress my tp so much?
2008-08-19T19:06:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	Do others have this issue?
2008-08-19T19:06:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	ask adobe
2008-08-19T19:06:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	heh
2008-08-19T19:08:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	how do I change the dynamic cpu scaling to "ondemand"? Thanks
2008-08-19T19:12:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/11/04/enabling-cpu-frequency-scaling/
2008-08-19T19:12:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	Thanks a ton. Reading.....
2008-08-19T19:23:00.000Z	relinker	Gnea	read the doc. I get a "permission denied" when I try to echo "ondemand" into scaling_governor. Yes I have setbit on cpufreq as the doc suggested. What could be wrong?
2008-08-19T19:23:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	are you root?
2008-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	Gnea	relinker	yeah, that should do it... check the permissions of the file and the directories it's in
