2005-08-31T07:22:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	you need to install the automake package
2005-08-31T07:20:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	what are you trying to find out?
2005-08-31T07:22:00.000Z	codomaniac	Ng	also noticed my problem ?
2005-08-31T07:22:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	or possibly automake1.4
2005-08-31T07:23:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	should be ok :)
2005-08-31T07:24:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	yes
2005-08-31T07:31:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	libtool1.4 I think
2005-08-31T07:34:00.000Z	Ng	codomaniac	take a look at http://packages.ubuntu.com/ you can search for the filenames to find out what package something is in :)
