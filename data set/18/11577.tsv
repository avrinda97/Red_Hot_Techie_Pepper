2006-07-11T06:27:00.000Z	landsg		anybody know how to mount a usb stick through terminal??  I lost x and am trying to get files copied before I re-install dapper
2006-07-11T06:27:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	mount something somewhere
2006-07-11T06:28:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	the somewhere is the easy part: some dir
2006-07-11T06:28:00.000Z	landsg	CarlFK	 OK
2006-07-11T06:28:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	use dmesg to figure out what the something is
2006-07-11T06:30:00.000Z	landsg	CarlFK	 when using mount, message says that it can't find some dir in fstab or mtab
2006-07-11T06:31:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	what mount command did you use?
2006-07-11T06:32:00.000Z	landsg	CarlFK	 "sudo mount /<dirname>"
2006-07-11T06:32:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	first, you need 2 tings: something and somewhere
2006-07-11T06:33:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	2nd, the things need to be "real":  a real device and a real dir that exists
2006-07-11T06:34:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	so first, figure out what the /dev device is that your usb is getting assgned to - it will be something like /dev/sda or sda1 or sg or something... plug it in and run dmesg -
2006-07-11T06:34:00.000Z	landsg	CarlFK	 OK, so I know what the USB stick is called (sda1);  how do I mount that so I can copy files to it??
2006-07-11T06:34:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	make a dir: md MyHappyDir
2006-07-11T06:36:00.000Z	landsg	CarlFK	I ran dmsg, and there is quite a  bit of verbage; looks like SCSI device sdb is the one
2006-07-11T06:37:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	 sudo mount /dev/sdb MyHappyDir
2006-07-11T06:41:00.000Z	landsg	CarlFK	 once I get sdb mounted to dir, then how to copy files to it/
2006-07-11T06:42:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	copt the files int MyHappyDir
2006-07-11T06:42:00.000Z	CarlFK	landsg	copt the files into MyHappyDir
