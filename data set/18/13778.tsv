2005-10-17T07:26:00.000Z	AES_24_96		anyone bored enough to help out a noob?
2005-10-17T07:27:00.000Z	AES_24_96		when I boot with it, I cant find on the cd any file to invoke to start the installation
2005-10-17T07:28:00.000Z	AES_24_96		hoary hedgehog
2005-10-17T07:29:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	is your BIOS set up to boot from the CD first?
2005-10-17T07:29:00.000Z	AES_24_96		yes
2005-10-17T07:29:00.000Z	AES_24_96		it boots fine if I use the nero boot disk thing
2005-10-17T07:30:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	what does "boots fine" mean to you?
2005-10-17T07:30:00.000Z	AES_24_96		it goes tro dos and lets me type stuff
2005-10-17T07:30:00.000Z	AES_24_96		if I boot off just the iso it says non system disk, replace with system disk
2005-10-17T07:30:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	going into DOS isn't "fine".  you want it to go into the ubuntu installer...
2005-10-17T07:31:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	if you boot into windows and look at the contents of the disk you burned as an ISO, what do you see?
2005-10-17T07:31:00.000Z	AES_24_96	dooglus	ok how do I make it go into the ubuntu installer, it wont boot from the iso for me, though itll boot if I drop system disk files on no problem
2005-10-17T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	did you see my question?
2005-10-17T07:33:00.000Z	AES_24_96	dooglus	md5sum.txt, README.diskdefines, ubuntu and some directories
2005-10-17T07:33:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	ok, that's how it should be.  i don't know why it isn't working.  do you have another CD drive you could try?
2005-10-17T07:33:00.000Z	AES_24_96		maybe
2005-10-17T07:34:00.000Z	AES_24_96		copuld there be something in my bios which wont allow iot to see linnux or something?
2005-10-17T07:34:00.000Z	dooglus	AES_24_96	try booting it in a different PC.  it won't install anything until you tell it to - just booting is OK
