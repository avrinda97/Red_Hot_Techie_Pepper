2009-08-22T13:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		btw can someone remind me the name of the package for IE
2009-08-22T13:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		There was a package for installing various versions of IE
2009-08-22T13:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		I have installed it earlier
2009-08-22T13:09:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		ahh
2009-08-22T13:09:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		that was the name!
2009-08-22T13:09:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		so the question I really wanted to ask was, last time I checked ies4linux didn't install on 64 bit
2009-08-22T13:09:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	ie4linux-2.99.0.1
2009-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	linuxson25	I don't quite understand how that is great...
2009-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	linuxson25	maybe I am not interpreting your correctly or something
2009-08-22T13:24:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	I have been going at it straight for 12 hours now, trying to install the cloned version om my laptop on my desktop pc, but after logging in, it would just give me a white screen. I got it working now, by booting into the KDE environment
2009-08-22T13:25:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	linuxson25	what exactly does a cloned version mean ?
2009-08-22T13:26:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	I used the software remastersys to "clone" my laptop installation to my desktop pc
2009-08-22T13:27:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	I made an exact copy of my already istalled Ubuntu distro
2009-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	The software lets you make redistributable backup copies
2009-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	linuxson25	I had thought so, just wanted to confirm, now that is AWESOME!
2009-08-22T13:28:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	Yeah, I know
2009-08-22T13:29:00.000Z	linuxson25	dhruvasagar	So happy right now!!!
2009-08-22T13:29:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	linuxson25	If only I knew about this earlier, I wouldn't have had to install everything I needed all over again when I changed my laptop!
