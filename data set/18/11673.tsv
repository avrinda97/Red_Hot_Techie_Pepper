2008-08-22T12:41:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	what's your WYSIWIG?
2008-08-22T12:41:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	mine is gvim  :)
2008-08-22T12:43:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	do a Google for WYSIWYG editor should bring it up it only costs around $25 and if you dont want to learn html its pretty good
2008-08-22T12:43:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	is gvim a linux one?
2008-08-22T12:43:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	oh, I'm fine myself - I'm a hardcore vi [ab]user
2008-08-22T12:43:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	vi, vim, gvim... it's all vi ... which a lot of people hate initially
2008-08-22T12:44:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	it's not really WYSIWIG at all in fact... it's all pure native text :D
2008-08-22T12:44:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	what the heck is vi vim?
2008-08-22T12:45:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	vi is a fundamental  but exceptionally powerful text editor
2008-08-22T12:45:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	did you ever get to use WordPerfect 5.1 ?
2008-08-22T12:46:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	if I was going to go further I would go for Joomla which I have been told by many is really hot.
2008-08-22T12:47:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	yes I did use wp many years ago sounds like you may be of my vintage (a good year)
2008-08-22T12:47:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	well, vi is a bit like how WP5.1 appears... blank screen on startup... :)
2008-08-22T12:49:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	I get that on motherboard-based-audio chipsets
2008-08-22T12:49:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	also very narrow dynamic range - installing a cheap 16 bit PCI card fixes a lot of that
2008-08-22T12:49:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	do you have audio volume controle enabled - I just want to check if my theory is right
2008-08-22T12:49:00.000Z	inflex	alistair_	ermm... can't be sure now - since I've got a separate card installed now
2008-08-22T12:50:00.000Z	alistair_	inflex	OK I see lots of folks are having probs and I found by enabling the system volume control and winding up front has fixed everything up (for me)
