2010-09-26T22:22:00.000Z	chris062689		I need to install Windows through Linux.
2010-09-26T22:22:00.000Z	chris062689		well, create a USB install of Windows through Linux.
2010-09-26T22:22:00.000Z	chris062689		People over at #windows won't know how to do that.
2010-09-26T22:22:00.000Z	chris062689		That's why I'm asking here.
2010-09-26T22:22:00.000Z	chris062689		Couldn't I Just dd the iso?
2010-09-26T22:23:00.000Z	chris062689		I don't think you understand, I'm trying to do this within Ubuntu.
2010-09-26T22:23:00.000Z	chris062689		Calling MIcrosoft wouldn't help.
2010-09-26T22:24:00.000Z	chris062689		I'm using Ubuntu to attempt to create a Windows USB!
2010-09-26T22:25:00.000Z	chris062689		Calling them and asking them how to create a USB install from a Linux distribution, they're not going to know how to do that.
2010-09-26T22:25:00.000Z	chris062689		That's why I came here for help.
2010-09-26T22:27:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	chris062689	use a windows machine. there's a HP Utility for it.
2010-09-26T22:27:00.000Z	chris062689		I do not have a windows machine available, otherwise I"d use that.
2010-09-26T22:28:00.000Z	chris062689	headstrong	what!?
2010-09-26T22:28:00.000Z	chris062689		what are you even saying!? -_-
2010-09-26T22:28:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	chris062689	so, try ubuntu's USB Creator, under System -> Administration -> USB ...
2010-09-26T22:29:00.000Z	chris062689		Abhijt, that's not going to work, I already tried doing that
2010-09-26T22:29:00.000Z	chris062689		I think if I dd the file, that might work.
2010-09-26T22:30:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	chris062689	grub2 can boot from CD iso images :)
