2011-07-28T03:14:00.000Z	dr_willis		the standard intel disks wont work.
2011-07-28T03:15:00.000Z	dr_willis		and to be honest with you.. I found the PPC macs lacking in their ability to run Ubuntu. I sold my iMAC DV a few weeks back.

2011-07-28T03:19:00.000Z	dr_willis		i just happened to see it mentioned at a blog site i was reading like 2 min ago.. :)
2011-07-28T03:19:00.000Z	dr_willis		ive never used it
2011-07-28T03:21:00.000Z	dr_willis		'dosent comply with a webpage' is sort of a scary statement.. :)
2011-07-28T03:22:00.000Z	dr_willis		Unless its somehow testing the creator of the pdf..

2011-07-28T03:23:00.000Z	dr_willis		!find kmailservice
2011-07-28T03:23:00.000Z	pwnusmaximus	dr_willis	ok
2011-07-28T03:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 it could be the issue is not related to that error message..
2011-07-28T03:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 theres always the stand alone vnc servers you could try. tightvnc or vnc4server
2011-07-28T03:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 vnc standard is a standard.. :) shouldent matter if the client/servers are all following the standard
2011-07-28T03:30:00.000Z	pwnusmaximus	dr_willis	one caveat. i want a gui. like the full desktop, not a terminal vnc
2011-07-28T03:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 vnc server/viewer runs a full desktop....
2011-07-28T03:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 most vnc servers/clients work that way..  :)
2011-07-28T03:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 the 'view the current desktop' is a specialized feature of the kde/gnome vnc built in server. You can have a dozen+ 'hidden' desktops that you vnc into.. none are visiable on the  machines actual monitor.
2011-07-28T03:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	pwnusmaximus	 you can have a headless server running 100+ vnc sessions each with their own 'full' desktop.
