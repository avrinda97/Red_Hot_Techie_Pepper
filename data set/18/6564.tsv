2008-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	xen_		sorry i got cut off
2008-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	xen_		anyone here managed to get wireless working with hard on a ThinkPad T61?
2008-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	xen_		laptop that is
2008-05-13T11:15:00.000Z	fde	xen_	Computer make/model does little good, and holds little relevance... can you please type 'lspci | grep -i wireless' does it return anything?
2008-05-13T11:16:00.000Z	xen_	fde	yes it returns "Intel corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN Network connection"
2008-05-13T11:18:00.000Z	fde	xen_	I hate advising ndiswrapper, but this is all I find: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Intel_4965_AGN_WiFi_Driver/Fiesty
2008-05-13T11:19:00.000Z	fde	xen_	Follow that guide, it should be up in a few mins... hopefully in the next release, it'll work out of the box, as Intel is pushing to open such things.
2008-05-13T11:21:00.000Z	fde	xen_	actually, first please try: http://kuscsik.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-to-install-intel-4965-wireless.html  *if* that doesn't work, then try what I said before please.
2008-05-13T11:21:00.000Z	fde	xen_	If modprobe works... just throw it into /etc/modules and you should be all set.
2008-05-13T11:22:00.000Z	fde	xen_	(just the module on a new line...)
2008-05-13T11:22:00.000Z	fde	xen_	Once loaded, you should be able to configure it via NetworkManager in the panel.
2008-05-13T11:24:00.000Z	xen_	fde	unfortuantly the sudo modprobe on the first line didnt show any wireless device after i tried ifconfig or iwconfig
2008-05-13T11:24:00.000Z	fde	xen_	does it show up in lsmod | grep iwl ?
2008-05-13T11:25:00.000Z	xen_	fde	about 2 different "iwl" descriptions came up
2008-05-13T11:25:00.000Z	xen_	fde	and another one called cfg80211
2008-05-13T11:26:00.000Z	fde	xen_	Ok... check System > Administration > Network ... is it there now? Should be set to Roaming.
2008-05-13T11:27:00.000Z	xen_	fde	nope doesnt show up
2008-05-13T11:28:00.000Z	fde	xen_	I dunno why it wouldn't ... perhaps there is some firmware you need that I'm not aware of?
