2012-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	run apt-get update again, if it persists, wait more and run apt-get update again or just use a different mirror.  I think this happens when the mirror is updating and you update as the mirror is in the middle of updating but the md5sums haven't been updated yet
2012-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	its been several days though.
2012-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	so use a different mirror
2012-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	I'm using what software-sources calls "Main Server". I'll try US if nothig works, I guess.
2012-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	you should take the opportunity to setup a local mirror then :)
2012-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	"setup" as in "find"
2012-09-20T14:15:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	you might as well mean "set up" :) The Lebanese server seems to be out-of-date. I wonder how much work it would be to maintain it...
2012-09-20T14:17:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	well you could try lb.archive.ubuntu.com.  Are you saying that that is out of date?
2012-09-20T14:17:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	from experience, yes it is out-of-date
2012-09-20T14:18:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	hmm, it's probably worthwhile to file a bug; maybe the admin isn't aware
2012-09-20T14:19:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	I believe it is simply unmaintained as the Ubuntu Lebanon team is no longer active.
2012-09-20T14:20:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	in either case, lb.archive.ubuntu.com shouldn't be pointing to non-functional servers
2012-09-20T14:21:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	where do you recommend I file the bug?
2012-09-20T14:21:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	I'm not sure where the appropriate place is.  I assume somewhere no launchpad.  Maybe #ubuntu-bugs can be more specific
2012-09-20T14:26:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	did changing the mirror resolve your hash issue?
2012-09-20T14:26:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	still apt-get updating, my current connection is pretty slow.
2012-09-20T14:27:00.000Z	jrib	theGrg	ok
2012-09-20T14:41:00.000Z	theGrg	jrib	llutz changing to a French server fixed my issue. Thanks.
