2007-10-26T15:02:00.000Z	Sonderblade	Atomic_UE	cool thanks
2007-10-26T15:02:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	no worries
2007-10-26T16:11:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	when you add a new printer the first thing it does is try to auto detect printers....if it's on a network it may not find the printer the first go, so totally close the printing config app and try again
2007-10-26T16:12:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	i tried that thing today at my placee of work n the network printer i wanted took 2 tries for it to find it
2007-10-26T16:13:00.000Z	Sonderblade	Atomic_UE	i've tried a few times using gnome-cups-manager, but it refuses to find it
2007-10-26T16:13:00.000Z	Sonderblade	Atomic_UE	manually adding the printer and using raw printing works, but i want auto-detection :)
2007-10-26T16:14:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	if the manual setup worked then use it ;)
2007-10-26T16:14:00.000Z	Sonderblade	Atomic_UE	no i only get grayscale printing
2007-10-26T16:16:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	maybe check the settings of the printer in the printer config
2007-10-26T16:16:00.000Z	Sonderblade	Atomic_UE	windows users get color printing
2007-10-26T16:17:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	i mean the settings in ubuntu printer config
2007-10-26T16:17:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	I've seen some drivers have colour as an option
2007-10-26T16:17:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	If that doesn't work try selecting a driver that is similar to your printer
2007-10-26T16:18:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	if that don't work try and get a hold of a PPD file from a windows/mac driver install and use that for your driver
2007-10-26T16:19:00.000Z	Sonderblade	Atomic_UE	actually i have a driver that exactly matches the printer model
2007-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Sonderblade	well use that, if it don't work pick a similar matching one
