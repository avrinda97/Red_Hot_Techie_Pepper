2007-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	Will that help if I'm trying to connect directly to my router?
2007-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	LameBMX	NoEvidenZ	that was for someone else in the chan ... as for wifi i dont have a clue .. i got a usb adapter and it was easier to move the router closer to the computer lol
2007-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	Argh.. my router's at the other end of the house. For a reason..
2007-01-03T07:35:00.000Z	LameBMX	NoEvidenZ	so was mine lol .. but im not gonna play with my lappy outside till summer so that gives me a few months to play without having a 50' ethernet cable strung throughout my apartment
2007-01-03T07:36:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	Damn.. It's the only way I can connect to my network, too. =/

2007-01-03T07:39:00.000Z	LameBMX	NoEvidenZ	you will prolly have to edit /etc/network i think it is and put in your routers essid etc
2007-01-03T07:41:00.000Z	LameBMX	NoEvidenZ	thats good to hear .. anytime thats what we are here for
2007-01-04T10:52:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	Would you know anything about the Edgy Live CD? Mine doesn't appear to be working.
2007-01-04T10:56:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	My Edgy Live Cd doesn't seem to be working. I can tell it to "Start or Install Ubuntu", it goes to the next screen, has Ubuntu and the symbol, but it looks different than it did on the Dapper Live CD, and it doesn't seem to load anything, it's like it just freezes there. Anything I'm doing wrong, or do I just have to get the alternate cd?
2007-01-04T10:57:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	Haha, no problem.
2007-01-04T10:58:00.000Z	LameBMX	NoEvidenZ	you get the same thing
2007-01-04T12:54:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	How very very true.
2007-01-04T12:55:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	LameBMX	The hard drive on my dad's laptop went apeshit. I put in a live cd, mounted the drive, got on the network and backed everything up.
