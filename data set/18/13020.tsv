2006-01-24T07:30:00.000Z	chemical_ds		hey folks. when installing ubuntu, i chose to "configure networking at a later time". i have correctly edited /etc/network/interfaces, and recieved an ip address + dns from dhcp server. however i can't access the internet. is there something else i need to configure?
2006-01-24T07:32:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	what's the output of route and ifconfig commands?
2006-01-24T07:32:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	the ifconfig output is 100% perfect
2006-01-24T07:32:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	route? etc/resolv.conf
2006-01-24T07:33:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	/etc/resolv.conf has correct info
2006-01-24T07:34:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	so what's wrong with ping? does it say anything ?  :)
2006-01-24T07:34:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	no output whatsoever... it just hangs :(
2006-01-24T07:36:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	ping the computer's own address
2006-01-24T07:37:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	i can ping localhost and my LAN interface... anything on the inet does not work tho
2006-01-24T07:38:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	can you ping ubuntu from another box? cable ok? remember windows xp's doesn't reply pings
2006-01-24T07:42:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	i cannot ping ubuntu box from another box on lan
2006-01-24T07:45:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	if your cables and hub work, there could be a wrong kernel module problem. I've also got IRQ sharing or wrong IRQ problems with NE2000 ISA cards
2006-01-24T07:47:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	send your lspci -v output to pastebin, of course if it's a pci card
2006-01-24T07:51:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	not sure what pci is, but the output of that command had something about ethernet in it so i here it is: http://pastebin.com/512934
2006-01-24T07:53:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	your kernel module is 3c59x
2006-01-24T07:54:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	so i'm supposed to modprobe that? i thought it was supposed to autoload as it's in /etc/modules
2006-01-24T07:56:00.000Z	decaf	chemical_ds	it should be autoloaded. it should work, I'm out of guesses
2006-01-24T07:56:00.000Z	chemical_ds	decaf	ok thanks anyway man... i guess i'll just re-install and let the installer set it up for me... that worked before
