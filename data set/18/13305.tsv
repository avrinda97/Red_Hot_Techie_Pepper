2006-05-12T07:57:00.000Z	blank		when i go to video.google.com, the video plays really fine but I hear no sound, and yes my sound is working in everything else (i.e. GAIM), could it be because I'm using ESD (default) and not ALSA?

2006-05-12T08:01:00.000Z	blank	dli	excuse me? Can you please clarify that sir?
2006-05-12T08:02:00.000Z	dli	blank	mplayer can play url, and it will write out why there's no sound
2006-05-12T08:02:00.000Z	blank	dli	try yourself and see if you have the same problem, just play any video at video.google.com
2006-05-12T08:02:00.000Z	blank	dli	okay thanks
2006-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	dli	blank	yes, my mplayer-plugin works fine in firefox
2006-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	blank	dli	could it be because I'm running firefox 1.5?
2006-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	dli	blank	I don't know, I'm running firefox-1.5
2006-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	blank	dli	ah, me too haha, so I guess it's not that
2006-05-12T08:04:00.000Z	blank	dli	I need to have mplayer installed to install mplayer-plugin I assume (I'm getting an error in synaptic when trying to just isntall that)
2006-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	blank	dli	what mplayer arch should I get if I'm on an AMD +2500; mplayer-k6 or just mplayer-386
2006-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	dli	blank	build your own mplayer :)
2006-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	blank	dli	nevermind
2006-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	blank	dli	it works now
