2011-10-09T15:42:00.000Z	Ben64		yes it is
2011-10-09T15:43:00.000Z	Ben64		it IS
2011-10-09T15:44:00.000Z	Ben64		i'm gonna go ahead and ignore everything you say
2011-10-09T15:45:00.000Z	Ben64		thats how it works usually, yes
2011-10-09T15:45:00.000Z	Ben64		su needs a root password
2011-10-09T15:45:00.000Z	Ben64		thats silly mode
2011-10-09T15:46:00.000Z	Ben64		sudo -i works for that
2011-10-09T15:47:00.000Z	Ben64		or i guess not
2011-10-09T15:47:00.000Z	Ben64		root is always there
2011-10-09T15:47:00.000Z	Ben64		its login is just disabled by default and has no password
2011-10-09T15:47:00.000Z	umadbro	Ben64	secured scrambled password
2011-10-09T15:48:00.000Z	Ben64		root:!:13818:0:99999:7:::
2011-10-09T15:48:00.000Z	Ben64		no password
2011-10-09T15:48:00.000Z	umadbro		so sudo -i runs a shell with root privileges
2011-10-09T15:48:00.000Z	umadbro		or sudo -s
2011-10-09T15:48:00.000Z	Ben64		sudo -i
2011-10-09T15:49:00.000Z	umadbro		sudo is temporary su, for short
2011-10-09T15:49:00.000Z	Ben64	umadbro	not really, but if that helps you, sure
