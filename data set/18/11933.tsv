2006-06-10T13:03:00.000Z	ivank		help, just took 512 out of my box now linux is failling to boot!!!
2006-06-10T13:04:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 test your memory brother.
2006-06-10T13:04:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 memtest86
2006-06-10T13:05:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 write the image to disk and boot from it.
2006-06-10T13:06:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 try it again with the good stik out.
2006-06-10T13:06:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 and let it run for a good while.
2006-06-10T13:06:00.000Z	ivank	troy_s	how what the average time for the test`?
2006-06-10T13:06:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 some suggest overnight.  minimum hour to stress it and warm it up.
2006-06-10T13:08:00.000Z	ivank	troy_s	i had single channel setup with 3 dimms now dual channel, should that be the problem?
2006-06-10T13:09:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 probably :)  check your mobo docs.  I bet it only likes certain numerical combinations.
2006-06-10T13:12:00.000Z	ivank	troy_s	i get thouthands of errors in test 7
2006-06-10T13:12:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 guess what :)
2006-06-10T13:36:00.000Z	ivank	troy_s	37000 errors :S
2006-06-10T13:36:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 gee... wonder what your problem is :)
2006-06-10T13:37:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 espcially bad with onboard shared memory vid cards.
2006-06-10T13:38:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 that was a month ago ;)
2006-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	ivank	troy_s	is it normal for ram to give errors during memtest? or is it normal when there ar eno errors at all?
2006-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	troy_s	ivank	 normal?  no... good ram shouldn't give errors.  overclocked might etc.
