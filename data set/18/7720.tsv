2007-11-26T21:38:00.000Z	froglet		my gutsy install just failed to boot. can anyone give me a hand?
2007-11-26T21:39:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	Try to boot in Safe Graphics mode.
2007-11-26T21:39:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	no, it's much worse than that
2007-11-26T21:39:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	i can't boot into recovery mode
2007-11-26T21:40:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	any ideas?
2007-11-26T21:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	I am not speaking about Recovery mode. I suggested that you first try the live CD booting in Safe Graphics mode before installing anything.
2007-11-26T21:41:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	ok. i am typing this from the live cd. that runs fine in full graphics mode
2007-11-26T21:42:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	i can also mount my root partition from the live cd. so i don't understand why it has trouble booting
2007-11-26T21:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	Ah, yes, I see. I did not encounter such error messages and cannot help you. Sorry.

2007-12-04T16:16:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	use the diff command.
2007-12-04T16:17:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	right, but how do i get hold of the original config file?
2007-12-04T16:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	I do not know what 'to get hold of sth.' means.
2007-12-04T16:18:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	it means 'to obtain'
2007-12-04T16:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	Is your original config file lost?
2007-12-04T16:19:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	well, it's in the ubuntu archive. i don't have it on my system. i was wondering if there's a simpler way to obtain it than finding the package and decompressing it
2007-12-04T16:20:00.000Z	bullgard4	froglet	I do not know of a simpler way.
2007-12-04T16:20:00.000Z	froglet	bullgard4	ok
