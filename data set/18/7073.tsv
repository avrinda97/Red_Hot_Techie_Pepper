2008-11-16T09:27:00.000Z	Clinteger		im using vista, and i want to dualboot
2008-11-16T09:27:00.000Z	Clinteger		so is it okay to resize an ntfs partition or is it too much of a hassle?
2008-11-16T09:28:00.000Z	abhishek	Clinteger	Resizing partitions in the installer... not fun.
2008-11-16T09:28:00.000Z	Clinteger		abhishek.. not fun? why is that
2008-11-16T09:28:00.000Z	abhishek		It takes long
2008-11-16T09:29:00.000Z	abhishek		I gave up after an hour and just formatted the drive... :\
2008-11-16T09:29:00.000Z	abhishek	Clinteger	You can resize the ntfs partition from within Vista I think
2008-11-16T09:29:00.000Z	Clinteger	abhishek	will it f*** stuff up?
2008-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Clinteger		k
2008-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	abhishek	Clinteger	You have a single HD with extra space? Installer is good enough.
2008-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Clinteger	abhishek	ok
2008-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Clinteger	abhishek	its just my friend told me that its a hassle to resize ntfs partitions, and it can cause problems
2008-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	abhishek	Clinteger	Multiple HDs or multiple partitions... don't go in unprepared.
2008-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Clinteger		well this is just 1 partition :)
2008-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	Clinteger	abhishek	wait, i do have 2 drives
2008-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	abhishek		:|
2008-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	Clinteger	abhishek	well im only installing on one of them
