2005-05-25T05:32:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	no ati graphics card but hp laptop
2005-05-25T05:32:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	how did you set it up?
2005-05-25T05:32:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	send me your config?
2005-05-25T05:32:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	or a HOWTO?
2005-05-25T05:33:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	one hint, make sure your laptop is powered off before you plug in the cable
2005-05-25T05:33:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	why?
2005-05-25T05:33:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	do you have an ati graphics card?
2005-05-25T05:33:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	in Windows I don't have to
2005-05-25T05:34:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	it just didn't work for me like unless I did that
2005-05-25T05:34:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	i have don't know about nvidia, but i think there is a program called nvtv
2005-05-25T05:34:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	and i think the official drivers support it
2005-05-25T05:36:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	yes but how do I enable it -- in windows i just plug in the cable and it works
2005-05-25T05:37:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	because some things in linux are different
2005-05-25T05:37:00.000Z	netsniper	timmow	i think that it should "just work" ;-P
2005-05-25T05:39:00.000Z	timmow	netsniper	i spent two weeks fighting with tv out, then had to install warty alongside hoary to get it too work
