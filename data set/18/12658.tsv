2006-03-23T06:53:00.000Z	Superslash		honda ilian: yes but if you have a SATA hdd apparently ubuntu installcd's don't recognize partitions
2006-03-23T06:54:00.000Z	Superslash		bickrud: my exact problem as well
2006-03-23T06:54:00.000Z	Superslash		apparently the way to solve the unrecognized partition problem is to run the latest livecd and fix everything with gparted
2006-03-23T06:55:00.000Z	Superslash		personally i just left about 80gigs unformatted in my windows install and imo use that with gparted, dont even need to touch my windows
2006-03-23T06:56:00.000Z	Superslash		of course anybody running a livecd will probably have my problem and be stuck for almost 30minutes at "enterprise volume management system"
2006-03-23T06:56:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	My live CD took  only 5 minutes to book.
2006-03-23T06:57:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	something is wrong man... wut is ur hardware conf?
2006-03-23T06:59:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	Holy God!
2006-03-23T07:00:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	did you tried the advanced boot feature?
2006-03-23T07:01:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	there must be an option to boot with SATA.
2006-03-23T07:02:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	very strange... How many GB is this SATA?
2006-03-23T07:06:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	how did you partitioned the linux partition? did you flagged it?
2006-03-23T07:09:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	when you boot with the installation cd... the whole hdd seems to be unformatted right? Isn't it showing only the 50GBs and ignoring the NTFS partition?
2006-03-23T07:15:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	so, when you run the partition aplication, it shows 200GB of non partitioned hdd?
2006-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	strange... It should at least shows 130GB of non recognized type or something like that lol
2006-03-23T07:19:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	trying to figure it out also...
2006-03-23T07:22:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	I know, but what program is on the ubuntu cd for patitioning?
2006-03-23T07:30:00.000Z	Honda	Superslash	could not figure out a solution, pass me your e-mail and I'll try to find something about it...
