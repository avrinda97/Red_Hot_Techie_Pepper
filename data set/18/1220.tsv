2011-05-21T05:22:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	there is no entry in fstab for the cd - and the rules for making one have changed in natty
2011-05-21T05:23:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	generally you dont want an entry in fstab, leave it out and gnome-volume-manager should auto-mount the partition
2011-05-21T05:26:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	in the previous version you stuck in a cd and it mounted - natty doesnt
2011-05-21T05:26:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	what is the output of groups?
2011-05-21T05:30:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	the ownership of cdrom in media is root root
2011-05-21T05:31:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	i would remove the folder in /media, remove the entry from fstab and if that doesn't work try udisks --monitor-detail
2011-05-21T05:48:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	very interesting - it sees it but there was never an entry in fstab - isnt that required
2011-05-21T05:49:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	no you DONT want an entry in fstab. the existence of an entry in fstab tells the userspace mounting daemon that you want to manage the mountpoint and NOT to automout it
2011-05-21T05:50:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	i think your problem was the existence of a folder in /media with the name of the mountpoint it would have chosen, but with root ownership
2011-05-21T05:51:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	it will make its own folder. i think the presence of that folder is confusing it
2011-05-21T05:55:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	no significant behavior here - maybe I should reboot
2011-05-21T05:55:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	or use the udisks --monitor-detail
2011-05-21T05:56:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	that shows activity when I eject the disk only - nothing when I put it in
2011-05-21T05:57:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	well thats the problem. not sure how to fix it though
2011-05-21T05:58:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	what is normal for natty? should it be mounting the cd
2011-05-21T05:59:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	well it should be detecting the insertion, which generates events in udisk and that triggers mounting or the media player popup depending on what kind of disk
2011-05-21T06:00:00.000Z	escott	gem_cat	np. goodluck finding the issue
2011-05-21T07:25:00.000Z	gem_cat	escott	it was a hardware prob - 2 dif brands of ide/sata converter orient opposite to each other
