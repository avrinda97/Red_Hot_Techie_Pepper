2012-09-14T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sokel	the echo command will fail and the command will also not be ran in /etc/rc.local as it is below the exit 0 line
2012-09-14T08:30:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	Of course, because ubuntu is shady like that :) I remove exit 0.
2012-09-14T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sokel	to use echo to root owned files you need to pipe to: sudo tee -a
2012-09-14T08:31:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	I refuse to use sudo. su - via pam.d and wheel group
2012-09-14T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sokel	it's not ubuntu specific, all distros use the exit 0 line.....
2012-09-14T08:31:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	Wrong.
2012-09-14T08:31:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	RHEL and Fedora don't. So, you're wrong.
2012-09-14T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sokel	echo "test to add" | sudo tee -a /path/to/fil
2012-09-18T01:11:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	don't even bother. He's been complaining for the last two hours about how his sound isn't working.
2012-09-18T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sokel	its a simple link :)
2012-09-18T01:14:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	Talking about nsudo.
2012-09-18T01:15:00.000Z	Sokel	ActionParsnip	I and a few others already gave him what was needed.
2012-09-18T09:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sokel	in your opinion ;)
