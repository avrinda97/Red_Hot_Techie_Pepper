2008-10-18T04:47:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	it gives you a little u character right?
2008-10-18T04:47:00.000Z	carandraug	dulak	gives me a crossed zero
2008-10-18T04:48:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	yeah that's bad, means it won't take unicode input
2008-10-18T04:48:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	if it was a little u that would be normal for unicode input
2008-10-18T04:48:00.000Z	carandraug	dulak	damn. Is there anyway to set shortcuts for some commonly used chracters?
2008-10-18T04:49:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	there is a character map program for x you can copy and paste from, but I don't remember the name of it
2008-10-18T04:50:00.000Z	carandraug	dulak	yes, I know that. But some characters I use a *lot* such as celsius degree â„ƒ
2008-10-18T04:51:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	I don't know man, I know the crossed zero means that program wont' take unicode input
2008-10-18T04:51:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	not sure what else to tell you
2008-10-18T04:51:00.000Z	carandraug	dulak	ok. Thanks anyway
2008-10-18T04:58:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	what version of lyx you have?
2008-10-18T04:59:00.000Z	carandraug	dulak	1.5.3, the one in Ubuntu repos
2008-10-18T04:59:00.000Z	dulak	carandraug	lyx claims 1.5.x supports unicode
2008-10-18T05:00:00.000Z	carandraug	dulak	then, it must have some other way to enter the code. Shift+Ctrl +u gives me a crossed 0 even before I could enter the code
