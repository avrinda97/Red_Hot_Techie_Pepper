2008-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	BlakJak		Hokay... can anyone answer a quick question regarding xubuntu for me?
2008-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	BlakJak		namely... why wont it let me open a terminal window??
2008-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	BlakJak		anyone?
2008-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	does Alt+F2 open a kindof "Run..." dialogue for you?
2008-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	im not sure if Alt+F2 works in xubuntu :p
2008-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	BlakJak	jesse	it does
2008-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	BlakJak	jesse	If I choose 'terminal' from the menu structure it seems to crash X
2008-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	try putting "xfce4-terminal" in the run dialogue
2008-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	BlakJak	jesse	any other thoughts?
2008-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	try "xterm", the most basic terminal emulator
2008-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	BlakJak	jesse	ahh. that worked
2008-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	okay, now you MIGHT be able tot ake it from there
2008-01-13T15:18:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	the problem is if you run "xfce4-terminal" from the xterm, X will crash before you get to read the terminal output :P
2008-01-13T15:18:00.000Z	BlakJak	jesse	i dont suppose it'll put anything in syslog?
2008-01-13T15:23:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	"Terminal" is just what xfce4-terminal and gnome-terminal are called in the menu.
2008-01-13T15:24:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	you know, just to simplify things.
2008-01-13T15:24:00.000Z	jesse	BlakJak	i have both xfce4-terminal and gnome-terminal installed on my computer, and they are both called "Terminal" in the menu.
2008-01-13T15:25:00.000Z	BlakJak	jesse	I'm a server guy, this is my first play with X in a long time.
