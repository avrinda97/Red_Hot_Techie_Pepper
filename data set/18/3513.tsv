2010-05-29T16:14:00.000Z	phlak_user	theadmin	you're right, you can use an existing service so long as you have an account with them
2011-09-30T13:04:00.000Z	theadmin	phlak_user	APT would try to retreive the files back the next update
2011-09-30T16:53:00.000Z	phlak_user	theadmin	i prefer to specify it tho ;)
2011-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	theadmin	phlak_user	It's just the installer though ... It would need network, I beleive
2011-11-04T12:18:00.000Z	phlak_user	theadmin	the logic is that you need to install this and remove the incorrect driver (bcmwl)
2011-11-24T16:08:00.000Z	phlak_user	theadmin	he doesnt know what that is :(
