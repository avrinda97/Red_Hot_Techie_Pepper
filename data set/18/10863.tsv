2008-07-11T08:12:00.000Z	ice_cream		hmm.. so i finally decided to grab ff3 w/o updating first on 7.10 ...i ended up w/ some kind of Gran Paradiso 3.0a8 with the %#*@ earth icon =/
2008-07-11T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	7.10 backports has an alpha version of firefox 3.
2008-07-11T10:32:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	If it were included, you don't remove it from the repos.
2008-12-05T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	Indeed, apologies.
2008-12-05T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	You can remove old kernels
2008-12-05T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	That's.... prohibitivly small.
2008-12-05T11:41:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	Do you have a particular example we could use?  What do you see in add/remove that you're looking for the package name of?
2008-12-05T11:42:00.000Z	ice_cream	Flannel	  xeno asking the q, not me =D
2009-02-11T11:31:00.000Z	ice_cream	Flannel	32bit os is limited to only 3.2 ? thought it could handle closer to 4
2009-11-03T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	I have no idea what you just asked, to be honest.
2009-11-03T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	And it'd be appreciated if you would watch your language.
2009-11-03T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	Obfuscated swearing still is.  Please refrain.  And can you restate your question/problem/whatever?
2009-11-03T12:15:00.000Z	ice_cream	Flannel	alright, sorry
2009-11-03T12:15:00.000Z	ice_cream	Flannel	the upgrade gave me KDE instead of *just* upgrading my installed packages
2009-11-03T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	slim does appear to have been removed from Karmic
2009-11-03T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	I have no idea why it gave you KDE instead though.
2009-11-03T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	It really shouldn't have installed KDE for you, we could try and figure out why, but that wouldn't help you I don't think.
2009-11-03T12:17:00.000Z	Flannel	ice_cream	If you want to know why slim was removed, you can ask in #ubuntu-motu, they should be able to tell you
