2004-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	pitti	Tsjoklate	after all, it's all open source, nothing you can't change :-)
2004-10-02T14:33:00.000Z	pitti	Tsjoklate	then, good luck with ubuntu
2004-10-02T14:34:00.000Z	pitti	Tsjoklate	well, there are still many bugs, but we are working hard to fix them :-)
2004-10-02T14:35:00.000Z	Tsjoklate	pitti	bugs I can live with... forced items I can't
