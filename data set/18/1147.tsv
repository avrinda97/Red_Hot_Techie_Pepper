2011-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	have you tried Fluxbox? Its based of openbox so it might be similar
2011-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	how to do that
2011-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	in synaptic you can install it
2011-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	ok
2011-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	I use fluxbox so I might be able to help more with it than openbox. ;)
2011-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	thanks verymuch
2011-05-24T19:28:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	actually i m looking for a great desktop management
2011-05-24T19:28:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	I'm really happy with it. I configured it to my liking and it really didn't take long
2011-05-24T19:29:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	ok great
2011-05-24T19:29:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	should i log off and log on to take effect
2011-05-24T19:29:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	you might want to look at configuring fluxbox first
2011-05-24T19:30:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	are you on a laptop or desktop?
2011-05-24T19:30:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	on desktop
2011-05-24T19:30:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	just installed
2011-05-24T19:32:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	go ahead and open the file ~/fluxbox/startup
2011-05-24T19:33:00.000Z	prashant_123456	Caboose885	dont know where it is installed
2011-05-24T19:34:00.000Z	Caboose885	prashant_123456	in nautilus you will need to push Control + H to show hidden fils
