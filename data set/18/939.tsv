2011-10-15T08:45:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	Set !(any) in ccsm (or whatever is new name) for window-decorations

2011-10-15T08:48:00.000Z	lauratika	qin	is working for you this way?
2011-10-15T08:54:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	It should. I do not have any decors.
2011-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	lauratika	qin	you mean your browser has no close, maximize, minimize buttons and window decoration?, are you under gnome classic in 11.10?
2011-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	What is in command box? /usr/bin/compiz-decorator ?
2011-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	No, 10.10
2011-10-15T08:57:00.000Z	lauratika	qin	im in oneric 11.10 it used to work ok in natty
2011-10-15T08:58:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	Do you run compiz? Which decorator?
2011-10-15T08:59:00.000Z	lauratika	qin	yes
2011-10-15T09:00:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	ps aux | grep decor
2011-10-15T09:02:00.000Z	lauratika	qin	:10608  0.0  0.0   5660   800 pts/0    S+   00:02   0:00 grep --color=auto decor
2011-10-15T09:03:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	So compiz-decorator is not running?
2011-10-15T09:04:00.000Z	lauratika	qin	if i type compiz-decorator decorations /usr/bin/unity-window-decorator: Ignoring unknown or already-used button name "menu "
2011-10-15T09:06:00.000Z	qin	lauratika	in "command" field (ccsm, windows decor), you can set preffered decorator, but dunno how it will react in Oneiric...
