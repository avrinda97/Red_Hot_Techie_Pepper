2008-12-19T22:34:00.000Z	thegve		My cups (Ubuntu 8.10) seems to "cache" the printer status. When I go from work to home with my laptop, it keeps saying "printer not reachable" for my home printer (which is connected to my server running cups).
2008-12-19T22:35:00.000Z	thegve		Do any of you know if there is a way to set "always check" or something?
2008-12-19T22:35:00.000Z	thegve		When I try to "find" a printer, it recognizes it. I just "worked around" it by messing up the configuration and then fixing it.
2008-12-19T22:37:00.000Z	sipior	thegve	i guess if all else fails, you could restart cups, but that's a fairly ugly solution. there's no timeout then? even after waiting five or ten minutes after connecting to the new network?
2008-12-19T22:37:00.000Z	thegve		I'm at home now for about 1 hour.
2008-12-19T22:38:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	Last message was for you ( busy here..)
2008-12-19T22:40:00.000Z	sipior	thegve	i got it, thanks. kind of odd behaviour; one assumes the cups folks wouldn't let a problem like that go. does the printer show as unavailable even in the cups web interface?
2008-12-19T22:41:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	the status on my server is OK (when I "discover" the printer of connect to my server using the gnome tools, the printer is "available"). On my local machine (laptop) I don't have the web interface I guess (stock install ... not checked but doesn't make sense, will check now)
2008-12-19T22:41:00.000Z	thegve		whaa, I have the web interface :)
2008-12-19T22:42:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	The printers at my work are "available", as is my home printer (after that kicking of my cups I just did)
2008-12-19T22:43:00.000Z	sipior	thegve	does it work the other way? when you go to work, are the printers immediately available?
2008-12-19T22:43:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	To be clear, the printers at my work should not be available here, I currently don't have a VPN set up...
2008-12-19T22:44:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	I just work there for 2 weeks now... I guess they are.
2008-12-19T22:44:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	But I haven't seem them as unavailable
2008-12-19T22:44:00.000Z	thegve		I'll do a test page to the work printer and see what cups does
2008-12-19T22:48:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	according to the web interface the work printer is now "processing, accepting jobs" after I send a print. I just get a balloon thing on my desktop telling me the printer is not connected. Web interface status does not change.
2008-12-19T22:50:00.000Z	sipior	thegve	hmm. you might try asking in ##cups, see if anyone there has a better idea of what the problem might be.
2008-12-19T22:52:00.000Z	thegve	sipior	Ok, thanks... I'll do that later when I have a little more time... I have an apointment in an hour and I have to do some other things first.. Thanks for helping!
