2009-03-19T06:36:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		okay, here's the deal.
2009-03-19T06:36:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		Im trying to set my IP address manually with the Ubuntu GUI and it is NOT working out for me.
2009-03-19T06:36:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		Anyone know why?
2009-03-19T06:38:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	so are you going to 'System | Preferences | Network Configuration'?
2009-03-19T06:39:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	in there, you have a list of, say, "profiles" -- try creating a new one, with static (manual) IP info, and then making it the default, or deleting the other profiles (CAREFUL whenever deleting)
2009-03-19T06:40:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	i guess you missed that last bit
2009-03-19T06:41:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	"r00tintheb0x, so are you going to 'System | Preferences | Network Configuration'?"

2009-03-19T06:42:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	bernz	i have already "cp -arfvp /etc /etc.bak"
2009-03-19T06:43:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	okay; FWIW, it appears this app (network configurator thingy) is stable enough that if you understand your LAN setup, you can obliterate everything and rebuild it, with little effort :-)
2009-03-19T06:45:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	right on :-)
2009-03-19T06:46:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	hehe, yeah, i hear that -- editing 'interfaces' -- no more of that, it's NetworkManager's job :-D
2009-03-19T06:47:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	well, on the plus side, you can always disable NM and go at it manually like in the days of yore :-]
2009-03-19T08:53:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	good q; i'm also in the "it's probably going to be a good job opportunity in the future -- if the exhaustion of cheap petroleum doesn't cease to fuel our insanely rich society -- so i might as well get good at it" camp"
2009-03-19T08:53:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	bernz	learn oracle administration
2009-03-19T08:55:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	hmm... i'm not TOO into databases... although you're right, it's probably a good area
2009-03-19T08:56:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	bernz	if you can learn the in and outs of Oracle DB and AS... and learn Linux like the back of your hand.
2009-03-19T08:57:00.000Z	bernz	r00tintheb0x	not too shabby :-)
