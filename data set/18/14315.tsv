2005-08-31T08:57:00.000Z	senile_implant		does anyone know what could cause programs to keep spontaneously closing on me with no sort of error message or anything?
2005-08-31T08:58:00.000Z	senile_implant		or how i would go about investigating it
2005-08-31T08:58:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	segmentation faults...
2005-08-31T08:58:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	maybe run them from a terminal, then at least you will be able to see the exit status, or if it returns an error to stdout
2005-08-31T08:58:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	what would cause them to occur? (sorry if this is a really broad question)
2005-08-31T08:59:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	i am not 100% sure they are segfaults, thats why run them from a terminal
2005-08-31T08:59:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	if anything goes wrong, there will definetely be something in the terminal for you
2005-08-31T08:59:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	good idea... except sometimes they don't crash for days. And it's not always one particular program, there are at least 3 that crash on me
2005-08-31T08:59:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	thanks for the advice though, I'll try that
2005-08-31T09:02:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	if something does happen to cause a seg fault and I get some sort of an error in the terminal, how will I be able to debug that?
2005-08-31T09:03:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	i don't think you can just FIX segfaults, they are usually problems in the programs design
2005-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	but then there is always the option of trying other versions, if the segfault was on an unstable
2005-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	a segfault is when your program tries to access memory outside its allocated space
2005-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	well the programs that are crashing regularly are kicker, mozilla-firefox and opera (to name a few) so i don't see how they could be poorly coded
2005-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	could it be a hardware issue?
2005-08-31T09:05:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	then maybe its not a segfault. wait for another crash
2005-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	senile_implant	watch out you'll start a major flame war =/
2005-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	senile_implant	EasterSunshine	lol i don't care
