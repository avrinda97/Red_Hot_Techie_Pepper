2010-07-31T22:36:00.000Z	pharasoth		hey everyone
2010-07-31T22:38:00.000Z	pharasoth		does anyone know what version of xorg-server nvidia 71.86.13 is compatible with
2010-07-31T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	the xserver version is not important
2010-07-31T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	if you read the README in the nvidia packge it will explain it's limitations
2010-07-31T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	this channel is for ubuntu support only
2010-07-31T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	the nvidia drivers that are shipped as part of the ubuntu hardware drivers tool is what is supported
2010-07-31T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	ok, so you'll need to contact nvidia to log a bug. Have you checked your cards supported status with ubuntu package drivers
2010-07-31T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	that's a good start, so it maybe worth logging a bug with nvidia
2010-07-31T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	most people use the supported versions
2010-07-31T22:48:00.000Z	pharasoth	ikonia	yeah i would love to if i could fix this one issue, but it seems im the only one who has experienced it
2010-07-31T22:49:00.000Z	pharasoth	ikonia	ive tried disabling composite and enable HWCursor and all sorts of things
2010-07-31T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	best thing is to log the bug with nvidia
2010-07-31T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	you're not using the supported drivers, you'll need to take that up with nvidia
2010-07-31T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	oh, you're using the drivers from the hardware drivers package
2010-07-31T22:56:00.000Z	pharasoth	ikonia	yeah i am fresh install
2010-07-31T22:59:00.000Z	pharasoth	ikonia	knowing that my cursor glitching is only in opengl apps, is it possible that using a different display manager could solve this?
2010-07-31T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	pharasoth	that's not a bad suggestion, I don't think it will work, but its certainly worth a look
2010-07-31T23:00:00.000Z	pharasoth	ikonia	ive tried different window managers but that didn't work
