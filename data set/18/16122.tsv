2005-01-08T17:05:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	thanks
2005-01-08T17:08:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	any idea why when 'ls' the ftp server hangs?  it's windows ftp server
2005-01-08T17:22:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	i'm sorry
2005-01-08T17:22:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	win2k3 server, filezilla works if in passive mode with tls enabled
2005-01-08T17:24:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	filezille being an open source win32 ftp client
2005-01-08T17:29:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	it's some crappy ftp server for windows i'm thinking, filezilla in win32 works fine
2005-01-08T17:30:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	a friend of mine
2005-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	i'm getting `ls' at 0 [Making data connection...]  with lftp...
2005-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	so he needs to open ports for ftp-data?
2005-01-08T17:34:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	yes, locally it worked with filezilla ftp client in windows
2005-01-08T17:35:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	i forget what the ftpd is, sure-ftpd or something?
2005-01-08T17:36:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	Serv-U ftpd
2005-01-08T17:38:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	ok then, i think ftp-data needs to be open as well as the ftpd port
2005-01-08T17:39:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	i don't really care about accessing it, just helped him set it up and don't have a windows box handy to test filezilla with
2005-01-08T17:44:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	thanks alot though!
2005-01-08T17:44:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	appreciate your help! :D
2005-01-08T17:53:00.000Z	stuNNed	mojo	looking at things, it looks like he needs to open ftp-data port, is this a security hazard?
