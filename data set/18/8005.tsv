2007-12-15T10:55:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	it's very possible that your sound was muted in the upgrade.
2007-12-15T11:06:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	you might need to check the settings for your sound card.
2007-12-15T11:07:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	I'm not very good with GUIs so I use (from teh command line) alsamixer
2007-12-15T11:10:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	generally red is good.
2007-12-15T11:11:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	oops. that was for changing the mic option.
2007-12-15T11:11:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	there's an emma as well... use emmaj to get me
2007-12-15T11:11:00.000Z	big_area	emmajane	oops

2007-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	in half a second she'll be horribly disappointed that the message wasn't for her though. ;)
2007-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	system-> preferences-> sound
2007-12-15T11:13:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	do the tests work?
2007-12-15T11:14:00.000Z	big_area	emmajane	should i leave it on autidetect or alsa?

2007-12-15T11:14:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	have you tried googling your sound card to see if there are any bugs for it?
2007-12-15T11:15:00.000Z	big_area	emmajane	i will
2007-12-15T11:15:00.000Z	emmajane	big_area	I remember when 7.10 first came out there were more than a few people who lost sound due to bugs for their specific cards.
2007-12-15T11:16:00.000Z	big_area	emmajane	ok i think i found a relevant bug report, ill get back to you in a bit, thanks for the help
