2005-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris		Can someone please verify my existence?
2005-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	sure
2005-03-11T15:43:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	of course, you can always just use '/etc/init.d/network restart'...
2005-03-11T15:44:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	gah... 'invoke-rc.d networking restart'
2005-03-11T15:46:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	If you are familier with Fedora... I really don't think its practical to learn Ubuntu...
2005-03-11T15:47:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	I'd be using Fedora if I was more familier with Red Hat systems  :/
2005-03-11T15:49:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	indeed, but likely those tools don't even have a comparison tool
2005-03-11T15:53:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	it appears to be, yes... error 10 according to server... no idea what that means
2005-04-18T15:31:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	not really... its not like they are complicated  ;)
2005-04-18T15:33:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	lunitik	You can use apt with FC
2005-04-18T15:33:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	eh... but it still sucks... crap repositories
2005-04-18T15:34:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	lunitik	True, Debian is elite at package management
2005-04-18T15:34:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	Fedora (Seth) just tries to fulfill too many use cases... and loses sight of things that matter to most
2005-04-18T15:35:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	He is only just now starting to figure out that loading the entire repo every time you even search is annoying
2005-04-18T15:36:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	lunitik	Yeah, I hate that
2005-04-18T15:36:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	actually... it loads the headers... but yeah... annoying... in FC4, they took that out... now it only looks for whats changed... and loads that
2005-04-18T15:36:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	cuts down time a lot...
2005-04-18T15:37:00.000Z	lunitik	MyNameIsChris	although, FC4t1 pretty much sucked for the most part... that was about the only thing that seemed decent
