2007-08-26T12:03:00.000Z	GBenemy		how come you have to pay for PClinuxOS? i though all linux software was free?
2007-08-26T12:04:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	free as in speech, yes
2007-08-26T12:04:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	linux is open... you are free to change it, copy it, distribute it... and sell it
2007-08-26T12:05:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	ianal but i think so
2007-08-26T12:05:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	but who would buy it if there is ubuntu?
2007-08-26T12:06:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	yeah... you would have to provide source code
2007-08-26T12:06:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	PClinuxOS is free because you can read the code and change it
2007-08-26T12:07:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	the problem comes from the word "free" in english... in spanish (for exmaple) there are 2 words: libre and gratis
2007-08-26T12:07:00.000Z	leo_rockw	GBenemy	exactly
