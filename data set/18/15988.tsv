2005-12-09T17:49:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	please don't do that here
2005-12-09T17:50:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	meh, if random people copy stuff not targeted at them ..
2005-12-09T17:50:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	nevertheless, that's not appropriate here
2005-12-09T06:04:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	was inf properly g-lined?
2005-12-09T06:05:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	not yet
2005-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	what does 'clearing orphaned inode' mean?
2005-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	you're running fsck?
2005-12-11T08:03:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	no, was during bootup..
2005-12-11T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	did you not shutdown properly?
2005-12-11T08:03:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	no, was forced to use the resetbutton :(
2005-12-11T08:04:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	for some unknown reason to me suddenly the load average went from 0.10 to over 15
2005-12-11T08:05:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	wow
2005-12-11T08:05:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	absolutely nothing worked anymore
2005-12-11T08:08:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	so what is the inode message?
2005-12-11T08:09:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	just an error with your filesystem since you shutdown abruptly
2005-12-11T08:10:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	so basically it just told me that it fixed the error?
2005-12-11T08:10:00.000Z	tritium	djk_	yes
2005-12-11T08:10:00.000Z	djk_	tritium	good thanks, never had to use the resetbutton with linux before..
