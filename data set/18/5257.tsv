2008-11-22T08:41:00.000Z	RITN		im getting "screen 1 deleted because of no matching config section" on my custom xorg.conf
2008-11-22T08:41:00.000Z	RITN		dual head.
2008-11-22T08:42:00.000Z	RITN		anyone help?
2008-11-22T08:42:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	depends. what adapter do you have?
2008-11-22T08:43:00.000Z	RITN	hmw	i have 2.  agp, and pci
2008-11-22T08:43:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	then youre ... . Uh, I mean, what exactly? (i have a similar setup and it was hard to get it up)
2008-11-22T08:44:00.000Z	RITN	hmw	let me post the file somewhere.  do you have a preference?
2008-11-22T08:49:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	looks very ok to me, but i dont know nvidia drivers. In my case, the "correct" setup just didnt work out.
2008-11-22T08:52:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	uhm. I just deleted it accidently (resetup my workstation). The only things, that were strange here (FGLRX) was the frequenca for screen 1 had to be an Option "Horiz2" and "Vsync2" in Secion for Device 0. My conf didnt look much different than yours. Its possible, that your driver is just crap. :( google or ask someone else in here.
2008-11-22T08:53:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	do you try to use compiz?
2008-11-22T08:54:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	nevermind. composition window manager, cool 3D desktop cube. Makes triple (and also dual-)head impossible on my machine. :(
2008-11-22T08:54:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	post the log from your x server to pastebin
2008-11-22T08:57:00.000Z	RITN	hmw	look at that
2008-11-22T08:57:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	what was the problem? (sorry... my brain)
2008-11-22T08:58:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	look at line 170
2008-11-22T08:59:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	the log looks quite short to me, btw
2008-11-22T09:00:00.000Z	hmw	RITN	are you sure, that Screen 0 shouldnt be Screen "Left" in sections "Device" ??
