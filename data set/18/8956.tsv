2007-05-30T14:22:00.000Z	Dazzler		is there a channel for hardware issues?
2007-05-30T14:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	this is basically it, whats the issue
2007-05-30T14:23:00.000Z	Dazzler	Paddy_EIRE	hi... I'm trying to get a PCMCIA wireless card working
2007-05-30T14:23:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	what is the card
2007-05-30T14:25:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	apparently Ndiswrapper will work fine with this card? have you tried this yet and/or do you have the windows driver?
2007-05-30T14:26:00.000Z	Dazzler	Paddy_EIRE	I have just downloaded the windows driver
2007-05-30T14:26:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	one sec I'll see if there is a more straight forward guide
2007-05-30T14:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/TRENDnet_TEW-421PC_H/W%3aB1_%28ndiswrapper%29?highlight=%28WifiDocs%2FDevice%29
2007-05-30T14:28:00.000Z	Dazzler	Paddy_EIRE	I'll follow that guide and yell if I need help. tks
2007-05-30T14:28:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	no probs, we'll be here :)
2007-05-30T14:31:00.000Z	Dazzler	Paddy_EIRE	Is there a way to use ndiswrapper without building it?
2007-05-30T14:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	yes
2007-05-30T14:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	its in the repos
2007-05-30T14:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	building it is fast believe it or not and no trouble so to speak... and you have the benefit of using the latest version if you wish
2007-05-30T14:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	stick with the repos first though and ajust the guide accordingly to see if there is any joy
2007-05-30T14:44:00.000Z	Dazzler	Paddy_EIRE	got the driver installed... flashing light
2007-05-30T14:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	nice one
2007-05-30T14:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Dazzler	I read somewhere that an opensource driver for that chipset will be on the horizon! hooray! :)
