2010-03-12T23:49:00.000Z	nigelnigel		i just installed my first copy of linux/ubuntu are there viruses in the linux world, how prevelant, do i need an antivirus
2010-03-12T23:50:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	about 30 of them ever
2010-03-12T23:50:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	AV in the linux world is to check files for viruses before you hand them off to unsuspecting windows users
2010-03-12T23:51:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	wow so there have only been 30 viruses that have affected linux ever
2010-03-12T23:51:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	in the wild, yes. ther have been proof-of-concepts not released in order to demonstrate vulnerabilities that were then fixed
2010-03-12T23:52:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	trojans can still be a problem of course. dont install software from people you dont trust
2010-03-12T23:53:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	trojans do they not replicate is this why they are not considered viruses
2010-03-12T23:53:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	precisely :)
2010-03-12T23:53:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	so what do they mainly do
2010-03-12T23:53:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	trojans mean someone says "its this great game you'll love it!" and really it screws your computer up
2010-03-12T23:54:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	is there much spyware on linux
2010-03-12T23:54:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	on the desktop side, no, but browser-based things like cookies of course still exist
2010-03-12T23:54:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	thanks for the great insight
2010-03-12T23:55:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	and OS wont protect you from, for example, cross site scripting or phishing. those are purely online things
2010-03-12T23:55:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	noscript is a great firefox extension for keeping javascript from doing badness ;-)
2010-03-12T23:56:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	do you do all your installs through the synaptic package manager
2010-03-12T23:57:00.000Z	maco	nigelnigel	i use the command line, and since i use kubuntu the graphical thing for me would be kpackagekit, but if you mean "does it all come from repositories?" then generally, yes, with the exception of code i write ;-)
2010-03-12T23:58:00.000Z	nigelnigel	maco	cool i am such a newb cant wait to start writing some code on my own
