2011-07-18T16:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	[THC]AcidRain	turn the computer off, put the drive away and try again in a couple of hours
2011-07-18T16:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	[THC]AcidRain	now is the time of making backups... ;-)
2011-07-18T16:51:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	Myrtti	i have like 1.5 TB of backups to make
2011-07-18T16:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	[THC]AcidRain	I was recently in the same situation as you, with an encrypted harddrive giving out I/O errors. After keeping the harddrive on the side for a few days, I got it mounted and quickly rescued what was most important - family photos. I may use the harddrive again after reformat, but I will not trust it again
2011-07-18T16:53:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	Myrtti	so your telling me i need to go to walmart as soon as possible and raise hell?
2011-07-18T16:54:00.000Z	Myrtti	[THC]AcidRain	not necessarily to raise hell, but make sure you've got backups of the most important things somewhere
2011-07-18T16:54:00.000Z	Myrtti	[THC]AcidRain	after *that* you can go raise hell.
