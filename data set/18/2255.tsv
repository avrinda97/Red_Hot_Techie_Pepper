2010-10-16T03:01:00.000Z	willz		what size partitions should i use for a netbook with a 320 gb drive?
2010-10-16T03:03:00.000Z	willz		anybody suggest partition sizes for a 320gb hard drive its a netbook
2010-10-16T03:04:00.000Z	willz		how many partitions should a netbook install have?
2010-10-16T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	by default it would put everything into /
2010-10-16T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	/ home can be useful as well, and a bit of swap
2010-10-16T03:06:00.000Z	willz	sebsebseb	what sizes would you suggest on a 320gb drive have 1 gig ram
2010-10-16T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	14GB  for  /   most of your hard disk for /home and 2GB for SWAP
2010-10-16T03:07:00.000Z	willz	sebsebseb	thanks alot youve been alot of help
2010-10-16T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	and if you do the manual install, you can set that up
2010-10-16T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	good idea to make sure your CD is perfectly fine, before installing, hence sending that to you as well
2010-10-16T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	I mean the ISO may have downloaded badly, or the burn to CD of the contents
2010-10-16T03:11:00.000Z	willz	sebsebseb	ok so i have a / partition a /home and a swap
2010-10-16T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	yep in the sizes I gave
2010-10-16T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	well you got to work out the size for  / for example  14 x 1024 =  your answer
2010-10-16T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	probably easiest to make swap first, then the    / and then do the /home
2010-10-16T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	otherwise you would have to work things  out, so there is space for the swap.  swap probably isn't really needed as such, but should have really
2010-10-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	willz	well personally I  would want swap space last, but doesn't really matter the order of the partitions
