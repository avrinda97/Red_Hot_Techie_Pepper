2007-12-09T13:35:00.000Z	pythondasnake		Listen I'll be honest, I just don't know what I'm doing
2007-12-09T13:37:00.000Z	pythondasnake		It asks me use as:   and Mount point
2007-12-09T13:37:00.000Z	pythondasnake		I chose ext2  for Use as.. I don't know what to choose for Mount point
2007-12-09T13:38:00.000Z	pythondasnake		ok
2007-12-09T13:38:00.000Z	pythondasnake		Yes I am
2007-12-09T13:40:00.000Z	pythondasnake		I partitioned 50 GB with partition magic in xp for the OS
2007-12-09T13:40:00.000Z	pythondasnake		I retyped the mount point as follows
2007-12-09T13:40:00.000Z	pythondasnake		... /media/sda2
2007-12-09T13:40:00.000Z	pythondasnake		When I click forward on the install it say no root file system
2007-12-09T13:40:00.000Z	pythondasnake		I don't know how to correct that
2007-12-09T13:41:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	 the mount point you want to use is:     /     . That is the 'root' of the file system
2007-12-09T13:45:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	if you are comfortable with partition magic, go back to it and make 3 partitions: 1 15gb  (that will be   /  ) , another that's about 2 times your ram (that will be the swap) and the rest will be /home
2007-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	pythondasnake	nickrud	not that your advice is not valid.. I don't understand why I would have to make 3 partitions..
2007-12-09T13:47:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	you can get by with 2.  Swap is the same as the swap file in windows, linux uses a partition instead. The third (optional) partition, /home , is equivilant to Users in Vista. Useful for reinstalling without losing data
2007-12-09T13:48:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	no, you really, really need that swap partition
2007-12-09T13:51:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	I used linux exclusively for years, until work forced otherwise
2007-12-09T13:55:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	I just did a fresh install, eclipse was the second thing I added
2007-12-09T14:02:00.000Z	nickrud	pythondasnake	 a really good place to search stuff is www.google.com/linux
