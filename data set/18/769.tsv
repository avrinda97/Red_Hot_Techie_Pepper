2012-11-16T03:45:00.000Z	tpumma		how come when using "less" cmd to view .php file, everything is one line? not easy to view. what's the best way to view .php from terminal?
2012-11-16T03:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	because your .php file hasn't got any line breaks
2012-11-16T03:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	it sounds like your .php file has no line breaks in it
2012-11-16T03:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	can you upload the offending file somewhere?
2012-11-16T03:52:00.000Z	tpumma	gordonjcp	it has line breaks. nano can view all the line breaks but not vim or less
2012-11-16T03:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	then it may have Windows line breaks - do you see lots of "^M" in it?
2012-11-16T03:56:00.000Z	tpumma	gordonjcp	i see "^M". lots of it
2012-11-16T03:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	okay, then you have DOS-like line endings
2012-11-16T03:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	open the file in vi/vim and try something like ":%s/<CTRL-V><CTRL-M>//g
2012-11-16T03:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	without the leading quote
2012-11-16T03:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	when you type "<CTRL-V><CTRL-M>" it should show up as "^M" and highlighted
2012-11-16T04:03:00.000Z	tpumma	gordonjcp	it says pattern not found. I'll check back later to see how to get around the dos line break
2012-11-16T04:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	there's a program called something like dos2unix
2012-11-16T04:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	did you type the ^M as Control-V followed by Control-M like I said?
2012-11-16T04:07:00.000Z	tpumma	gordonjcp	yeah ^M like u said went away but no line breaks can is displayed. still all in one line.
2012-11-16T04:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	well, that's your problem right enough; you need to convert the ^Ms to proper line breaks
2012-11-16T04:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tpumma	look at DOS to Unix conversion
2012-11-16T04:10:00.000Z	tpumma	gordonjcp	ok. i'll try to install dos2unix and run it on .php so i can view it right in vim
