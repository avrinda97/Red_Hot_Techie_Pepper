2012-02-02T07:07:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		Anyone here mind helping me out with my hardware acceleration?  I still can't get it working.  Ubuntu 11.04, Intel HD 3000 and nVidia GeForce 520M, both controlled via Optimus.  I've tried this https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Troubleshooting and https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Upgrading-on-Ubuntu , and after resetting numerous times I still have no luck.
2012-02-02T07:09:00.000Z	Nowayz	BlueProtoman	uninstall anything you did with bumblebee, add the repo for ironhide, and install ironhide
2012-02-02T07:09:00.000Z	Nowayz		One that coppies permissions i hope
2012-02-02T07:10:00.000Z	Nowayz		There we go I got my OS to boot at least
2012-02-02T07:10:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	Nowayz	I don't think Ironhide is supported anymore.
2012-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	Nowayz	BlueProtoman	Ironhide is a continuation of bumblebee from what I read, i thought it was bumblebee that was no longer being updated
2012-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		Will do.
2012-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	Nowayz	I heard otherwise.
2012-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	Nowayz	BlueProtoman	either way ironhide works like a charm, and is able to toggle on/off the secondary card whenever its being used or not
2012-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	Nowayz		thank you!
2012-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	Nowayz	Well, that stopped working for me at one point, and I was advised to switch.
2012-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	Nowayz		I only wish I had ALREADY run this
2012-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	Nowayz		What stopped working?
2012-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	Nowayz	BlueProtoman	did you have the repo installed, because it broke for me and I just ran apt-get upgrade and all was well
2012-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	Nowayz	Yes, I did have the repo installed.
2012-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		For both Ironhide and Bumblebee.
2012-02-02T07:15:00.000Z	Nowayz	BlueProtoman	you had BOTH installed at once?
2012-02-02T07:15:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	Nowayz	Not at once, Bumblebee prompted me to remove Ironhide, so I did.
