2011-06-23T02:05:00.000Z	coz_	rns	   in terminal  type this command    glxinfo -l |grep MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE    paste the number it has in the readout
2011-06-23T02:09:00.000Z	rns	coz_	8192
2011-06-23T02:10:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 ok now,, that number  , 8192, is your video card's hardware limitation for resolution,, in other words, singe or dual monitors combined CANNOT  excede that resolution either horizontally for vertically,,  if i understood some of your issue
2011-06-23T02:12:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 and that number is especially important when running dual monitors
2011-06-23T02:12:00.000Z	rns	coz_	8192 is pretty big right?
2011-06-23T02:12:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 it is about medium considering  some of the newer cards ,,yes
2011-06-23T02:14:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 for example.. on this system  the max texuture size is only 4096  however I run dual monitors with combined resolution of 2560x1024  which is well withing that limit
2011-06-23T02:14:00.000Z	rns	coz_	so at 1024x768 I could have roughly 6 monitors?
2011-06-23T02:14:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 if the "combined"  resolutions  do not excede the max texture size
2011-06-23T02:14:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 that is total of all monitors horizontally and combined resolution vertically
2011-06-23T02:15:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 take vert and horiz  as seaparte  combinations
2011-06-23T02:15:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 example if you have 5 monitors ,, horizonatl conbined  does not exceed your max texture size then it is possible
2011-06-23T02:16:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 sam applies to the vertical resolution
2011-06-23T02:17:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 of course 4 to 6 monitors is going to require 2  and 3 video cards repectively
2011-06-23T02:18:00.000Z	rns	coz_	cool, thanks this is helpful
2011-06-23T02:18:00.000Z	rns	coz_	so any monitor that fits within that limit should work?
2011-06-23T02:18:00.000Z	coz_	rns	  yep
2011-06-23T02:19:00.000Z	coz_	rns	 keep that command handy,, if you change cards or new system,, you will want to know the max texture size of the video card
