2008-11-26T06:43:00.000Z	greghere		Do I have to have a swap file?
2008-11-26T06:45:00.000Z	greghere		I have four partitions on a 200 gb HDD so I cant make a swap file but I have 3 gb of ram.
2008-11-26T06:45:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> its easy to make a swap file, it is just a file and can co-exist with what you already have now
2008-11-26T06:47:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> how did you create the file?
2008-11-26T06:48:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	useing the partition editor in Ubuntu "hardy"
2008-11-26T06:48:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> i said how you created a file? not a partition..
2008-11-26T06:49:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	err... I used the partition editor to create the swap file? :)
2008-11-26T06:50:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> i though you said you didnt have room for it?
2008-11-26T06:51:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> post in pastebin your results of   sudo fdisk -l
2008-11-26T06:53:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	To do that i would need to have the O/S installed and the point of my asking about swap files was that i am in the process of installing :)
2008-11-26T06:54:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> perhaps i should have asked before..what are you trying to do?
2008-11-26T06:57:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	200GB Hdd divided into 4 partitions, 1 x NTFS for Windblows, 1 x Ext3 For Ubuntu "root" 1 x Ext 3 for /home, and 1 x NTFS for storage/backup :)
2008-11-26T06:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> okay, now do you have the livecd to start the installation?
2008-11-26T06:58:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	yes.
2008-11-26T06:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> boot from the livecd and start installing
2008-11-26T06:59:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	Ok
2008-11-26T06:59:00.000Z	greghere	n8tuser	At partitioning stage
2008-11-26T07:00:00.000Z	n8tuser	greghere	-> what about?
