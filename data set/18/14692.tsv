2008-02-17T20:55:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	under System > Administration > Restricted Driver Manager, what does it say there?
2008-02-17T20:56:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	if you're using NVidia, you're going to need closed drivers maybe to get better resolutions
2008-02-17T20:57:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	yes, that's what you're looking for - after updates, click on that icon to enable the NVidia driver
2008-02-17T20:57:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	it will download, install for you
2008-02-17T20:58:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	System > Administration > Restricted Drivers Manager
2008-02-17T21:02:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	are you logged in as a user in the administrator group?
2008-02-17T21:03:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	try 'sudo restricted-manager'
2008-02-17T21:04:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	after you change your permissions, that's the place you'll need to find it - hope that helps
2008-02-17T21:06:00.000Z	ryan__	Nitroray	restricted-manager if you're using a terminal to run it, otherwise it can be found via the menus by System > Administration > Restricted Drivers Manager
