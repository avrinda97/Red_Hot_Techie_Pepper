2009-11-03T07:54:00.000Z	Xiella		My OpenOffice 3.1.1 in Karmic (kubuntu) won't open .xlsx files, either from new spreadsheet or double/right-clicking in dolphin.  There are no error messages.  I am having the same issue on OpenOffice 3.1.1 on my XP dual boot.  Is this a problem with OO 3.1.1, or Karmic?
2009-11-03T07:55:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	run the command from a terminal, that way when it fails it will spit out an error message that might be useful
2009-11-03T07:55:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	did that last night, no error messages at all.
2009-11-03T07:56:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	oh :(...  any way to convert the file maybe?
2009-11-03T07:57:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	I'm resorting to doing that at the moment but I'm just wondering if it's something I should file a bug report about?
2009-11-03T07:58:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	if you can repeat it then yes.  is xlsx microsoft office format?
2009-11-03T07:59:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	Yes and yes.  It just has no error messages at all, I just wondered if it was my whole system or OO specifically.
2009-11-03T08:01:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	ok..   not whole system just format death.  Try another like gnumeric spreadsheet and see if that reads. You can set the columns on formats it doesn't know
2009-11-03T08:01:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	hmm, gnumeric spreadsheet, is that gnome?  I'm running kde.  Also what do you mean by format death?
2009-11-03T08:02:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	oh just a crash because the program doesn't know it.  If you have access to office, save file as .csv and that can be imported anywhere.  I'm googling for a ubuntu solution
2009-11-03T08:03:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	Ah! alright, thank you
2009-11-03T08:04:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	generally speaking though if it's the same error on XP/Ubuntu then the error lies with OpenOffice.  That being said you need to convert the file for either OS
2009-11-03T08:05:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	Yeah, maybe it's just been too soon for it to show up on google.  Thank you.
2009-11-03T08:06:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	I'll file a bug report for it, in the meantime I'll just keep converting them manually, thanks for all your help
2009-11-03T08:06:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	I think so, I came up empty
2009-11-03T08:06:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	np
2009-11-03T08:06:00.000Z	darlek	Xiella	new version blues
2009-11-03T08:06:00.000Z	Xiella	darlek	heh, yepyep :P
