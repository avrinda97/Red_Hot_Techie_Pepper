2006-07-03T16:08:00.000Z	J_P		hey all, I think I find a bug in ubuntu dapper : I try in /usr/src do this : tar -xvf <TAB> <TAB>. the first <TAB> complete line with this : root@concord:/usr/src# tar -xvf linux-source-2.6.15.tar, but second <TAB> not show nothing and congeals the terminal, but in anoteher temirnal i was running top and I see that first terminal where I set two times <TAB> using 99% of cpu. and machine was reaaly very slowest. That is a bug ?
2006-07-03T16:09:00.000Z	J_P		after 35 seconds second <TAB> show root@concord:/usr/src# tar -xvf linux-source-2.6.15.tar  linux-source-2.6.15/
2006-07-03T16:10:00.000Z	void^	J_P	it's bash completion trying to figure out what further tar options might be reasonable, extracting the tar.gz in the process
2006-07-03T16:13:00.000Z	J_P	void^	this ocurred only with user jpsuser. User jpsuser is one user with root userid and gid : root@concord:~# cat /etc/passwd | grep -i jpsuser
2006-07-03T16:15:00.000Z	void^	J_P	i can reproduce the behaviour with any user and any (large) tar.gz file.
2006-07-03T16:16:00.000Z	J_P	void^	so, how I resolv this ?
2006-07-03T16:17:00.000Z	void^	J_P	don't use tab when inappropriate, or disable bash_completion, or modify bash_completion to not work with tar.
2006-07-03T16:19:00.000Z	J_P	void^	but with root user this not ocurred, so I would like know how root user can do two times TAB without problems and copy this config to anothers users.. understand ?
2006-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	void^	J_P	which config files are run depends on how the shell is started, and what files are present in a user's home directory
2006-07-03T16:22:00.000Z	J_P	void^	diference between jp user and root is that in jp user I do sudo -i to be root. and using root user I'm don't have problem!
2006-07-03T16:22:00.000Z	J_P	void^	so I would like works in normal user as in root..
2006-07-03T16:24:00.000Z	void^	J_P	err, i don't see enough of a problem to bother with figuring out exactly what causes the difference in behaviour now. i'm just saying bash completion is the cause, and how to fix it is up to a bunch of man pages and config files
2006-07-03T16:25:00.000Z	J_P	void^	but why this problem don't have with root user ?
2006-07-03T16:25:00.000Z	void^	J_P	because a shell behaves differently when called differently and with different user directories.
2006-07-03T16:27:00.000Z	J_P	void^	what config I need do to have equal config in normal user as in root user ?
2006-07-03T16:29:00.000Z	J_P	void^	beouse this is totally insecure, becouse in normal user can use 100% of cpu using only two TABs!!
2006-07-03T16:33:00.000Z	void^	J_P	eh, any user can use 100% cpu time if it's available. try: dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null
2006-07-03T16:39:00.000Z	void^	J_P	.. and at this point you would press ctrl-c or kill the process. problem solved.
