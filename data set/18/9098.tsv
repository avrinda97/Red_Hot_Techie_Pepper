2007-05-10T11:50:00.000Z	Eythan		How long does it normally take to resize a partition from the boot CD?
2007-05-10T11:51:00.000Z	Eythan		*sigh*
2007-05-10T11:51:00.000Z	Eythan		I've been waiting for ten minutes now and it's still at 0% :P
2007-05-10T11:51:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	it can take a long long time
2007-05-10T11:52:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	where are you watching the %?
2007-05-10T11:52:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	sometimes I've seen the text-ui progress bar not work at all
2007-05-10T11:52:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	but if you hit Alt-F3 or Alt-F4 it migh be saying something
2007-05-10T11:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	you can hit Alt-F1 to return to the main install screen
2007-05-10T11:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	(I assume you're using the alternate or server installer)
2007-05-10T11:53:00.000Z	Eythan	SuperQ	nope, the one from the live gui
2007-05-10T11:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	oh..
2007-05-10T11:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	I didn't know the live CD gui did resizes
2007-05-10T11:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	if you open a terminal under applications::accesories
2007-05-10T11:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	you can run "vmstat 1"
2007-05-10T11:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	and see if the ---io--- column says bi/bo
2007-05-10T11:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	(blocks in, blocks out)
2007-05-10T12:01:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	are the numbers non-zero?
2007-05-10T12:02:00.000Z	SuperQ	Eythan	oh.. canceling resizes is.. dicey
