2008-12-18T14:45:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	it'll be an IP or firewall problem likely
2008-12-18T14:45:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	lets see "ifconfig"
2008-12-18T14:49:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	ok, and the default gateway is .1.1?
2008-12-18T14:51:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	reply or timeout?
2008-12-18T14:52:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	it still does that, only counts the seq=[number]
2008-12-18T14:53:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	when I prest Ctrl-C it shows ping statistics: 35 packets transmitted, 0 received, +30 errors, 100% packet loss, time 34132ms, pipe 3
2008-12-18T14:54:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	how can i try it? On the second computer I have windows (from that I am now writing you) so, what should I do to ping router?
2008-12-18T14:54:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	start > run > cmd
2008-12-18T14:54:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	black window appears. Type "ping 192.168.1.1"
2008-12-18T14:55:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	it is pinging very well
2008-12-18T14:55:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	without any problem or fault
2008-12-18T14:56:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	how? if I write it in terminal it says: iptables: unrecognized service
2008-12-18T14:57:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	yes, it is wired connection ADSL without router
2008-12-18T14:58:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	when you say "without router" I imagine you mean that the device which connects you to the internet also provides the network functionality. Is that correct?
2008-12-18T14:59:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	exactly :-)
2008-12-18T15:00:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	I wrote it in terminal and it says: network: unrecognized service
2008-12-18T15:02:00.000Z	Sorcererbob	kanchana	I'm sorry to say it, but I don't recall enough about ubuntu to continue... I've been using CentOS for the last year or so :(
2008-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	kanchana	Sorcererbob	actually, what's in brief what should I do now?
