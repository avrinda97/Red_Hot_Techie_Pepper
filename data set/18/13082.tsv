2006-06-17T10:44:00.000Z	__mikem		I have a 3ghz amd64 and my dad wouldn't let me install windows xp 64 bit eddition. Since I am using vmware, I am not sure if I can run a 64 bit guest os, in a 32 bit host os
2006-06-17T10:44:00.000Z	__mikem		HEy, does anyone here run vmware
2006-06-17T10:46:00.000Z	__mikem		How to install an ati card, 1. Mount it on a wooden post in the yard. 2. Load shotgun, 3. FIre at will. 4. Buy an nvidia
2006-06-17T10:46:00.000Z	__mikem		I love that one
2006-06-17T10:47:00.000Z	__mikem		Ill have to try it later when I actually have spare time to play around with it
2006-06-17T10:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	current releases of VMware allow you to run 64bit operating systems on 32 and 64bit machines
2006-06-17T10:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	performance wouldn't be all that great doing a 64bit O/S on a 32bit CPU, though .. performance is great in the other direction though
2006-06-17T10:48:00.000Z	__mikem		My machine is 64 bit, but the host os, namely windows xp is 32 bit
2006-06-17T10:49:00.000Z	__mikem	Samus_Aran	I have an amd64, but it runs 32 bit windows
2006-06-17T10:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	ah, I see .. and you want to try out a 64bit GNU/Linux distro on top of that 32bit Windows ?
2006-06-17T10:50:00.000Z	__mikem	Samus_Aran	yup, thats the idea. I was told it wasn't a good idea though
2006-06-17T10:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	that will work, but it will be running the 64bit emulation from your CPU's 32bit emulation, as your Windows kernel doesn't support 64bit
2006-06-17T10:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	so you'll be triple-emulating =p
2006-06-17T10:51:00.000Z	__mikem	Samus_Aran	that is just not worth the trouble, triple-layer emulation is a performance nightmare
2006-06-17T10:52:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	it may not be as bad as you think, being that AMD is quite good at emulating the 32bit CPU (almost 2x32bit CPUs for each 64bit one), but you will then have VMware's 64bit emulation to contend with. all in all, you will lose performance over just running a 32bit GNU/Linux distro
2006-06-17T10:53:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	you're much better off installing a 64bit GNU/Linux and then emulating the Win32 from that base
2006-06-17T10:53:00.000Z	__mikem	Samus_Aran	What about duel booting 64 bit linux with 32bit windows
2006-06-17T10:54:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	__mikem	you should have no problems dual-booting, if you don't mind actually having to reboot
