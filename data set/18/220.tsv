2012-06-06T04:01:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	thats a lot of time
2012-06-06T04:02:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	what was your initial goal and the command you ran? if you dont folks asking
2012-06-06T04:03:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	the command please.
2012-06-06T04:06:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	what do you think you lost now? the data on the external?
2012-06-06T04:07:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	afaik you didn't delete anything
2012-06-06T04:11:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	so lets confirm some things - sda1 is your ORIGINAL windows partition? sdb1 is the EXTERNAL and expected DESTINATION of the backup? and your telling me you did if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 ? and your also telling me sda1 was affected?
2012-06-06T04:12:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	your not telling me the complete story
2012-06-06T04:13:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	next time your unsure of things ask first before doing
2012-06-06T04:13:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	do you have an old copy of fdisk -l?
2012-06-06T04:16:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	please.. listen - do you have an old print out of the fdisk -l?
2012-06-06T04:20:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	its NOT for backing up
2012-06-06T04:20:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	it acts like its doing a bit for bit copy
2012-06-06T04:20:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	NO
2012-06-06T04:20:00.000Z	aaron_samuel	tugba_	somewhat.. yes
