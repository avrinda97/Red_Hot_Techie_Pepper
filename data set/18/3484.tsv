2009-10-17T17:11:00.000Z	stsm		any suggestions?
2009-10-17T17:11:00.000Z	stsm		its just seeing my intire disk unallocated :s
2009-10-17T17:12:00.000Z	stsm		eaf-sheep: 9.04
2009-10-17T17:12:00.000Z	stsm		latest stable
2009-10-17T17:13:00.000Z	geirha	stsm	Sure it's looking at the right harddrive? Does ''fdisk -l'' show the windows partitions?
2009-10-17T17:13:00.000Z	stsm	geirha	yep right drive
2009-10-17T17:13:00.000Z	stsm	geirha	the intire HD is unallocated space in linux, but it boots windows just fine lol
2009-10-17T17:13:00.000Z	geirha	stsm	And the drives show up with the correct size?
2009-10-17T17:14:00.000Z	stsm	geirha	yeah
2009-10-17T17:16:00.000Z	geirha	stsm	Seems you're not the only one http://www.bauer-power.net/2009/06/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu.html
2009-10-17T17:16:00.000Z	geirha	stsm	It sounds like windows 7 is partitioning in a non-standard way
2009-10-17T17:16:00.000Z	stsm	geirha	i guess thats what leaf-sheep menat with "thats a feature not a bug"
2009-10-17T17:16:00.000Z	stsm	geirha	thanx
2009-10-17T17:19:00.000Z	geirha	stsm	The latest version of gparted may have a work around, so grabbing the latest gparted live CD may allow you to manually prepare the ubuntu partitions
2009-10-17T17:20:00.000Z	stsm	geirha	yeah ill probably get it fixed with googling and trying stuff
