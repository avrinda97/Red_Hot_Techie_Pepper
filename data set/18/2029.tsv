2010-09-06T20:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	not meant to enable the root account in Ubuntu
2010-09-06T20:09:00.000Z	super-noob	sebsebseb	i know this now thats why im such a noob
2010-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	ah ha you don't understand what sudo is I guess? Or didn't know
2010-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	with sudo you are in control
2010-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	by the way most other distros what they do, is when installing you would set up two accounts, a normal user account, and a root account.  The root account you would never log in to,  instead you would use the normal user account, and only become root when you need to.
2010-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	if you log into a root account, loads of services and such, can run that shoudn't be running like that useually
2010-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	and yeah what headkase314 put
2010-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	there is a way to disable the root account in Ubuntu again, but I am not  sure how
2010-09-06T20:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	also with Windows, a main reason why there is so much malware (malicious programs) is because most users are running it with admin, when they don't need to,  which means full power for the system to them, but also any malware.
2010-09-06T20:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	have you logged into the actsaul root account?
2010-09-06T20:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	super-noob	if so maybe you should just clean install the OS, after all some stuff may have changed, that shoudn't have
