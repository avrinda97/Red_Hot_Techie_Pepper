2011-04-08T15:46:00.000Z	n8w_		im havin problems with runnin a cronjob...crontab -e: 50 10 * * * sh /home/user/script.sh...the path is correct,however the cronjob is never triggered...god knows why.any ideas?
2011-04-08T15:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8w_	do "/bin/sh /home/user/script.sh"
2011-04-08T15:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8w_	also make sure the script can run in sh ( i.e. does not use some bash specific feature )
2011-04-08T15:49:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 ive tried both, sh / bash
2011-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 i forgot to mention that i also have this in the cronjob : SHELL=/bin/bash
2011-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8w_	so what is exactly the command you have in crontab?
2011-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 tomcat restart
2011-04-08T15:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8w_	SHELL=/bin/bash definend in the script itself makes little sense... can you post the script?
2011-04-08T15:53:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 well apparently not, ive read an article suggestin it...
2011-04-08T15:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8w_	again can yu post the exact line in crontab and the script? in a pastebin
2011-04-08T15:55:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 w8 a sec
2011-04-08T15:56:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 hmm it seems like it takes different timezones
2011-04-08T15:57:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 i mean, rite now i can see that it got executed 10:50 UTC, but i kept checkin the log since 10:00...
2011-04-08T15:58:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 10:00 CEST
2011-04-08T15:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8w_	ok so it works :)
2011-04-08T15:59:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 the log gives me: Fri Apr  8 10:50:03 UTC 2011
2011-04-08T15:59:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 ye well i guess that it works then;) but im still kinda confused about the different timezones
2011-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	n8w_	erUSUL	 well thx for your help anywai;)
