2012-06-14T07:07:00.000Z	polygons		hey guys, i just installed mysql, i want to make sure it's not running, hwo can i?
2012-06-14T07:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polygons	sudo service mysql status
2012-06-14T07:08:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	thansk, it says unrecognized service
2012-06-14T07:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polygons	try tab completing the service name
2012-06-14T07:09:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	but when i go to install it again, it won't work
2012-06-14T07:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polygons	you could ask in #mysql
2012-06-14T07:10:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	it's not in there, they sent me to ubuntu actually :-).
2012-06-14T07:11:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	i think this is basically an package manager thing.  when i go to install it, it will hang on setting up mysql-server until i hit "stop mysql" ,implying that it's running, although i don't see it.
2012-06-14T07:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polygons	thats just the grep running
2012-06-14T07:22:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	damn
2012-06-14T07:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polygons	you can see what's happening with:  ps -ef | grep mysql | grep -v grep
2012-06-14T07:22:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	what's that commnand?
2012-06-14T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polygons	shows the processes but will not show the grep running :)
2012-06-14T07:23:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	Rallias, agc93, ok, so now i know that it's not running, at least anyway we can see, so now i want to install it
2012-06-14T07:24:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	Rallias, agc93, maybe i should first check that the package isn't installed?
2012-06-14T07:25:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	Rallias, agc93, but i'm pretty sure i have all the mysql stuff really uninstalled, it doesn't show in syanptic
2012-06-14T07:26:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	Rallias, agc93, yeah it doesn't show in apt, or synampitc, and its not running as a process or as a service, so i' m going to install and it won't work
2012-06-14T07:30:00.000Z	polygons	ActionParsnip	Rallias, agc93, so it to setting up mysql-server and it hangs.... and then says: Unable to set password for the MySQL "root" user                                                                     â”‚
