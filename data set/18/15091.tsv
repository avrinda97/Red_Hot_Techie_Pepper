2005-05-08T08:44:00.000Z	Janux		hi, does anyone know the command for showing the current processes with CPU usage like the one that you can see in M$ windows?
2005-05-08T08:45:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	top
2005-05-08T08:45:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	thanks a lot
2005-05-08T08:47:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	what program will run python at the background all the time in Ubuntu? it eats up 30% of my CPU usage all the time, is it X-Chat?
2005-05-08T08:48:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	doubt it
2005-05-08T08:48:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	find the pid in top, then use 'ps auxf' to see the tree of processes, so you can see who the parent is.
2005-05-08T08:49:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	ic...thanks, let me try
2005-05-08T08:50:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	how do you see that? it's pretty confusing
2005-05-08T08:51:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	omg...found it...the gdesklets is eating up my resources...
2005-05-08T08:51:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	thank you so much
2005-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	er, it will never ever be in multiverse or universe
2005-05-12T09:59:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	why?
2005-05-12T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	because it's supported software, and thus goes in main
2005-05-12T10:00:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	in main? I don't find it either.
2005-05-12T10:00:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	yes, indeed it hasnt been updated yet, breezy is undergoing other more important changes
2005-05-12T10:02:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	so I just need to wait until the main updates?
2005-05-12T10:02:00.000Z	bob2	Janux	yes
2005-05-12T10:04:00.000Z	Janux	bob2	thanks
