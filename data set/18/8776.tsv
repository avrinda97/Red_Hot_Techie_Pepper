2007-06-27T10:05:00.000Z	andruk	GameSpot	what you want to do is install a dual boot system on the first hard drive, and use the second hard drive for storage?

2007-06-27T10:20:00.000Z	andruk	GameSpot	you may have already done this, but you have to change the hard drive being operated on up in the upper right hand corner
