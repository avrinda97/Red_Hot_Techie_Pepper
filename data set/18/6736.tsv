2008-04-03T03:24:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	what does the readme say you need as deps? This one at a time piecemeal method will get old fast
2008-04-03T03:24:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	they are the library headers that allows you to compile apps that use the X server
2008-04-03T03:27:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	must not have been able to handle the flood of missing people rejoining us.   X includes are the library headers that allow you to compile apps that use the X server, just as the zlib1g-dev headers allows you to compile stuff that uses compression
2008-04-03T03:27:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	so, you should read the README file, probably tells you all the stuff you need to compile successfully
2008-04-03T03:27:00.000Z	Steven2	nikrud	How do I get it? From synaptic or no?
2008-04-03T03:28:00.000Z	Steven2	nikrud	I didn't see any of that in there.
2008-04-03T03:28:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	 xserver-xorg-dev
2008-04-03T03:29:00.000Z	Steven2	nikrud	Installing
2008-04-03T03:30:00.000Z	Steven2	nikrud	It still says that it cant find 'x includes'.
2008-04-03T03:30:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	then try xorg-dev , I tried to get you the minimum
2008-04-03T03:34:00.000Z	Steven2	nikrud	That time is said it didn't find libjpeg or QT. So I'm installing a bunch of QT stuff.
2008-04-03T03:36:00.000Z	Steven2	nikrud	It reads: 'checking for Qt... configure: error: Qt (>= Qt 2.2.2) (headers and libraries) not found. Please check your installation!'
2008-04-03T03:46:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	was away for a sec, install libqt3-mt-dev
2008-04-03T03:48:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	your issue is getting the necessary support libs for the things you want to compile. You're slowly getting the ones for this app, and you need to do the same for anything you compile
2008-04-03T03:52:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	get the -dev stuff you need. No reason to clutter ubuntu systems when only a small percentage will be doing compiling
2008-04-03T03:53:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	don't
2008-04-03T04:10:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	you might try gmountiso (I never really paid attention to exactly what you were compiling ;)
2008-04-03T04:11:00.000Z	nikrud	Steven2	 ls /usr/include , is one of those qt something?
