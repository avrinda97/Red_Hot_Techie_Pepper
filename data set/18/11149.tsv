2006-10-07T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	abusing people does not help
2006-10-07T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	one more outburst like that and good bye if no one
2006-10-07T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	maybe you need to give out to Lexmark cos they are not interoperable
2006-10-07T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	do you understand?
2006-10-08T16:48:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	lexmark are the problem, get onto your retailers case, and say where is your support for GNU/Linux and Ubuntu in particualr
2006-10-08T16:55:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	remove the printer from the "printers" in system administration printers, power it off, power off the ubuntu machine, power onthe printer, and then the ubuntu machine, now install the printer and it should be okay
2006-10-08T05:00:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	drop it now - or you will not be here
2006-10-08T05:01:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	I told you how you might fix it
2006-10-08T05:02:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	however you insisted on arguing the point
2006-10-08T05:02:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ompaul	I did not read it: PM me.
2006-10-08T05:02:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	remove the printer from the "printers" in system administration printers, power it off, power off the ubuntu machine, power onthe printer, and then the ubuntu machine, now install the printer and it may be okay
2006-10-08T05:09:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	if your printer is not working, go to your retailer and ask them why it does not work with Ubuntu, and I am not joking here
2006-10-08T05:10:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ompaul	They will say "Well, here we have a copy of Windows XP Home for 200$".
2006-10-08T05:12:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	this matter is not for further discussion here, #ubuntu-offtopic channel exists for that reason
2007-04-10T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	superkirbyartist	so is this the same machine that had the printer problem last october?
