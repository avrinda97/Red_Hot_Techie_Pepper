2005-07-18T10:24:00.000Z	Marble2		Okay, I don't know what I did wrong, but I had totem playing almost all types of video files, now I changed something and it will only play .mpg/.mpeg files, every other type of file gives me a handling error. Does anyone know how to fix this?
2005-07-18T10:26:00.000Z	Marble2		i have w32codecs installed
2005-07-18T10:26:00.000Z	Marble2		yea
2005-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	Marble2		what the hell... it just started playing .wmv files
2005-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	Marble2		still no .avi though
2005-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	Marble2		the error is
2005-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	Marble2		video codec 'XviD format' is not handled. You might need to install additional plugins to be able to play some types of movies
2005-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	Marble2		XviD format changes, depending on what the video is encoded in though
2005-07-18T10:28:00.000Z	Marble2		hm, now it won't play a different wmv file
2005-07-18T10:28:00.000Z	Marble2		this is weird
