2012-11-16T15:48:00.000Z	dr_willis		dosent happen with other window managers?
2012-11-16T15:48:00.000Z	dr_willis		test with others?
2012-11-16T15:49:00.000Z	dr_willis		wmaker is the old WindowMaker right? Its quite.. well.. old skool.
2012-11-16T15:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		id say test with Fluxbox or Openbox or even JWM. it may be a Window Manager issue. and not an X config issue.
2012-11-16T15:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		That Panning feature is somthing common years ago. I rarely seen it mentioned these days
2012-11-16T15:51:00.000Z	dr_willis		if you are on Debian, you really should be asking in #debian also
2012-11-16T15:51:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	i asked there as well
2012-11-16T15:52:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	20 min before coming here
2012-11-16T15:47:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	yes the screen pans around. If I setup a lower resolution the screen gets cropped. It is annoying.
2012-11-16T15:48:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	i have just this one
2012-11-16T15:49:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	i wanted to keep this system very minimal its a debian netinstal
2012-11-16T15:50:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	maybe there is some application that is able to configure the screen
2012-11-16T15:52:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	so thanks for your help
2012-11-16T15:53:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	if you switch to wmaker does it support the dual monitor?
2012-11-16T15:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	cantoma	 no idea. Been so long since ive last used wmaker. i would actually be suprised if it did.
2012-11-16T16:15:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	it seems like it is also a problem of fluxbox
2012-11-16T16:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	cantoma	 wmaker in ubuntu works fine with my 2 monitors :)
2012-11-16T16:16:00.000Z	cantoma	dr_willis	maybe if I install gnome or kde it solves the problem .. but i was trying to avoid it
