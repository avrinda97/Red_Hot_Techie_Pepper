2011-09-23T19:38:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	what is you want me to do? -- my release-upgrades file  has in [DEFAULT] section, "Prompt=normal"
2011-09-23T19:38:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
2011-09-23T19:39:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	yeah. I'm there, and that's what I've been reading to get me from 8.10 -> 9.04 -- its instructions for 9.04 -> 9.10 are ineffective.

2011-09-23T19:41:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	again, this page provides instructions that simply do not work.
2011-09-23T19:42:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	What you have to do is edit  your sources.list  so that it shows 9.10 sources
2011-09-23T19:43:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	Did you do that yet?
2011-09-23T19:44:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	ok. now what?
2011-09-23T19:44:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
2011-09-23T19:44:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	you realize then your instructions do differ from the page you referred me to.
2011-09-23T19:45:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	Did you do it?
2011-09-23T19:45:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	in progress.
2011-09-23T19:46:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	If and when it finishes successfully, do this:  sudo do-release-upgrade
2011-09-23T19:47:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	yep.
2011-09-23T20:01:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	doing release-upgrade now -- wish me luck.
2011-09-23T20:02:00.000Z	usr13	allballs	good luck!   :)
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	allballs	usr13	perfect -- thanks a bunch for your insight. my upgrade process is now complete.
