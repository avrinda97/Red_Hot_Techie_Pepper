2006-11-30T13:17:00.000Z	Naik0	ArrenLex	on line 29 it says couldnt find package gtk
2006-11-30T13:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Naik0	what happens if you try "apt-get install g++-4.1"
2006-11-30T13:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Naik0	and that's right, it couldn't find gtk because there is no such package. If you're running gnome, you already have gtk installed anyway.
