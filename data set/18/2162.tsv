2010-08-03T06:05:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	came with apache
2010-08-03T06:06:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	did you install apache from source or APT?
2010-08-03T06:01:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	a2sidmod <modname> as root
2010-08-03T06:05:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	I'm looking to unload reqtimeout_module but when I did "a2dismod reqtimeout_module" it says it's not loaded when it actually is.
2010-08-03T06:05:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	is it possible I'm doing it wrong?
2010-08-03T06:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	was this a module that came with apache or something that was custom installed?
2010-08-03T06:06:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	let me look at one of my LAMP setups, hold on
2010-08-03T06:06:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	sure thing thanks!
2010-08-03T06:07:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	I don't see that listed as a module that comes with Apache on Ubuntu
2010-08-03T06:07:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	look through your configs in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and /etc/apache2/mods-enabled for anything mentioning it
2010-08-03T06:07:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	this is my loaded modules http://pastebin.com/MzmnADTQ
2010-08-03T06:08:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	I found "reqtimeout.load" & "reqtimeout.conf" in my /etc/apache2/mods-enabled folder. What do I do with them?
2010-08-03T06:09:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	yeah they look like symlinks
2010-08-03T06:09:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	once I remove them symlinks do I restart apache?
2010-08-03T06:10:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	ah thanks so much!
2010-08-03T06:10:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	 I'm guesing a2dismod didn't work because you used the actual mod name instead of the name used in those files
2010-08-03T06:10:00.000Z	FliesLikeScreen	xomp	but removing those links is exactly what a2dismod would have done
2010-08-03T06:39:00.000Z	xomp	FliesLikeScreen	still there? :)
