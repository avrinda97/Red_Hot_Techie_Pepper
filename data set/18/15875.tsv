2005-01-11T11:31:00.000Z	Arc		i need help with a laptop
2005-01-11T11:32:00.000Z	Arc		installing it for a local woman who's going to study in central america for a year - she's leaving tomarrow night - and some things aren't working yet
2005-01-11T11:32:00.000Z	Arc		first, this wireless card (which has linux drivers as i've researched) isnt working
2005-01-11T11:32:00.000Z	Arc		its a linksys wpc11 ver 4 card - the realtek chipset inside
2005-01-11T11:33:00.000Z	Arc		I could resolve this problem if I could obtain the kernel source
2005-01-11T11:33:00.000Z	Arc		but I'm a gentoo user - I don't know how to get the kernel (and other things) with ubuntu
2005-01-11T11:34:00.000Z	Arc		yea previous to ver 4 it was prismII
2005-01-11T11:35:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	the v4 realtek card support is shoddy at best.
2005-01-11T11:35:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	i wouldn't bother.  if you can, i would grab a prism card.
2005-01-11T11:36:00.000Z	Arc	srbaker	no choice. she's leaving tomarrow.
2005-01-11T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	i have a Netgear WG511 (which are on sale at Staples/Business Depot) and it works just by pluggin it in
2005-01-11T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	oh.
2005-01-11T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	well, if you manage to get it to work, it'll be difficult
2005-01-11T11:36:00.000Z	Arc	srbaker	let it be difficult.  but i need the kernel sources for this release
2005-01-11T11:37:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	apt-get source <package>
2005-01-11T11:37:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	apt-get source linux-source-2.6.8.1
2005-01-11T11:37:00.000Z	srbaker	Arc	and unless you're a programmer, and one with lots of time to waste, you don't need the source
2005-01-11T11:38:00.000Z	Arc	srbaker	actually I find the linux kernel source incredibly helpful and required for resolving most hardware issues - and I've never touched the source
