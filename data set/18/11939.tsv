2006-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	barros		hi.. i've just compile a custom kernel, using the linux-source package, but now the ubuntu splash dont show up anymore.. anyone has an ideia why?
2006-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	slackern	barros	'sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so' and choose the one you want
2006-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	slackern	barros	that will show you a menu with options to choose which usplash to use
2006-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	barros	slackern	thanks, I'll try that..
2006-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	slackern	barros	and you might need to do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-$(uname -r)' after but not sure about it.
2006-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	slackern	barros	i had a similar problem after trying kubuntu-desktop package, couldn't get the regular ubuntu-usplash back i did those 2 then it was fine again.
2006-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	barros	slackern	another strange thing is that the rt2570 module is not compile, even though it is selectec.. but I think that is normal, cause I'm using smp
2006-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	slackern	barros	have you changed kernel or something perhaps? and missed out restricted modules for your new kernel?
2006-06-06T05:52:00.000Z	barros	slackern	I've done a make menuconfig, removed things that I'll not use.. but left rt2570 alone
2006-06-06T05:52:00.000Z	slackern	barros	ahh
2006-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	barros	slackern	but I'll not use rt2570, cause it does not support smp, that I use.. I'll try the open source one.. if nothing works, I'll get back to ndiswrapper, that worked like a charm on a fedora box
2006-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	slackern	barros	ahh haven't tried making my own kernel for ubuntu  yet, but it might have something to do with that you must make a initrd for your new kernel, if you followed a howto for it there should be something about how to make a new initrd there.
2006-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	barros	slackern	yes, I got a how to.. I used the make-kpkg to buil the kernel..
2006-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	barros	slackern	that was very simple, it build and install everything needed..
2006-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	slackern	barros	ahh, maybe i'll try it out in the future, but nothing i've bothered with yet, seems to work quite well as it is for me :)
2006-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	barros	slackern	for me too, but I wanted to optimize and remove a bunch of unused modules.. and I was having hanging problems with the rt2570 and WPA
2006-06-06T05:56:00.000Z	barros	slackern	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=56835 - a how to compile kernel. :D
2006-06-06T05:56:00.000Z	barros	slackern	just change linux-tree for linux-source
