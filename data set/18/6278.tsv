2008-07-14T04:08:00.000Z	askand		Where can I download latest language XPI:s for Firefox?
2008-07-14T04:10:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	are you looking for the locales ? if so, check synaptic for entrees starting with mozilla-firefox-locale
2008-07-14T04:14:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	 that does not help since todays update :(
2008-07-14T04:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	someone asked a similar question, after installing the recent firefox updates he got it solved by creating a new profile for firefox ..
2008-07-14T04:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	seems to be a new bug --> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/248204 .. no fix yet i'm afraid
2008-07-14T04:23:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	thanks :)
2008-07-14T04:25:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	did creating a new profile solve your issue ? if so, you could suggest it as a workaround at the bug page .. just checking, other people might drop in with similar issues :)
2008-07-14T04:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	thanks for trying, i guess for now that's the only thing you can do
2008-07-14T04:35:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	 sounds like there is something wrong in the plugins since it says that it is not compatible with 3.0.1 but is with 3.0
2008-07-14T04:37:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	okay thanks, if it is related to that you can manually decompress an xpi, change the max-version in the install.rdf, comprees the lot again and install it (or use an add-on tool to make xpi's compatible)
2008-07-14T04:48:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	I cant find the xpi for firefox 3
2008-07-14T04:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	what language are you using firefox in ?
2008-07-14T04:49:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	swedish, sv-SE
2008-07-14T04:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	okay, i'll try to nose around for that, will report back
2008-07-14T04:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:3 only shows a dictionary for swedish, guess you're out of luck there .. looking into the language packages in synaptic for clues now
2008-07-14T04:53:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	Yea, I can only find versions for firefox 2 in synaptic
2008-07-14T04:55:00.000Z	askand	glitsj16	 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=858240 it seems to have something to do with xulrunner :)
2008-07-14T04:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	askand	aha, nice find :) .. hope there's a fix
