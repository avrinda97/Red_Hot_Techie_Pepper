2008-12-29T15:15:00.000Z	Slart	apparle	oss is getting a bit dated...are you using a x-fi from creative?
2008-12-29T15:16:00.000Z	apparle	Slart	Who said it's outdated
2008-12-29T15:17:00.000Z	Slart	apparle	many people... it seems you don't quite agree
2008-12-29T15:18:00.000Z	Slart	apparle	we are talking about OSS as in the alternative to alsa, right?
2008-12-29T15:21:00.000Z	apparle	Slart	Yes, but what to do when ALSA doesn't work and any ways OSS4 is out which is not at all outdated
2008-12-29T15:27:00.000Z	Slart	apparle	here's part of a discussion I found while googling.. I can't testify to wether there's any truth in it or not.. I'm just quoting... wikipedia claims oss is deprecated in linux since 2.5
