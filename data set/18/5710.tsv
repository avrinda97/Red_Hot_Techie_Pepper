2008-09-04T01:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	shouldn't be the case but some apps are not nice and can block the sound card ... make sure all your apps use pulseaudio or esd as sound option
2008-09-04T01:04:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	erUSUL	where can I configure that in Rhythmbox and in VLC Player?
2008-09-04T01:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	Rythmbox should use it by default in vlc player is Preferences>Audio>Output modules (make sure Advanced options is checked)
2008-09-04T01:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	also make sure you have vlc-plugin-pulse instaled

2008-09-04T01:06:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	erUSUL	just a sec
2008-09-04T01:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	for rhythmbox and many other gstreamer apps check "gstreamer-properties" (run it)
2008-09-04T01:07:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	erUSUL	what should I fil in for "Esound-Server"?
2008-09-04T01:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	in vlc ?

2008-09-04T01:10:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	erUSUL	will log out and then log in.. if it will not work, I'll come back.. otherwise: thanks a lot for the help =)
2010-11-20T17:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	dding the iso is not enough. use usb-creator or unetbootin
2010-11-20T17:39:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	erUSUL	why's that?
2010-11-20T17:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	a cdrom and a usb port are not the same thing. the bootloader conf that works for a cdrom does not work for a usb pendrive
2010-11-20T17:40:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	erUSUL	ah okay, thanks
2010-11-20T17:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	MichaelKohler	you need a tool that sets up syslinux.
