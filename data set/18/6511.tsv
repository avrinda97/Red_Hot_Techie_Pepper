2010-06-11T21:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL		hi guys!
2010-06-11T21:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL		can anybody pls recommend me an app that can convert jpeg files into gif files?
2010-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	remoteCTRL	 youi want a command line? or gui tool?
2010-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	prefer commandline?
2010-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	remoteCTRL	 the imagemagick tools can do that
2010-06-11T21:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	that is cli?
2010-06-11T21:24:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	nice, thanks!:)
2011-07-16T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	remoteCTRL	 normally /media/VolumeNameOfTheCD from what ive seen
2011-07-16T17:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	that is exactly what i was hoping for, but thre is just nothing there! yet vlc plays it!
2011-07-16T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	remoteCTRL	 audio cd  gets accessed directly via the /dev/XXX item
2011-07-16T17:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	szal no?? erm... what then?
2011-07-16T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	remoteCTRL	 i dont know what you are trying to do....
2011-07-16T17:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	do you happen to know that /dev/xxx item that could be? cos there is no /dev/cdrom nor /dev/dvd nor anything that would resemble a cd...?
2011-07-16T17:41:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	well i was listening to an audio play with my daughter, then all of a sudden it ended in the middle, vlc does not recognize any further chapters, so i tried to just look what actually IS on the cd, but i can fugure out no way to just see its contendt, nautilus also says Could not display "cdda://sr0/".
2011-07-16T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	remoteCTRL	 check dmesg command output perhaps. it may mention some errors
2011-07-16T17:43:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	ok, the /dev/sr0 hint was already wery nice, could you also tell me with what filesystem option i should mount  a cdrom? like -t ext4 or -t iso99somthing?
2011-07-16T17:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	erm... dmesg throws like a ton of errors...
2011-07-16T17:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Dr_Willis	mostly keeps repeating the same thing over and over, like these 5 lines: http://nopaste.info/e090de0d3e.html
