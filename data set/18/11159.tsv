2009-04-04T17:29:00.000Z	scunizi	christian_	System> Admin> Synaptic Package manager and search for those names
2009-04-04T17:30:00.000Z	christian_	scunizi	is this the same as the add/remove menu ?
2009-04-04T17:30:00.000Z	scunizi	christian_	more flexable.. more detail.. etc..
2009-04-04T17:31:00.000Z	christian_	scunizi	oki..  i can install the packages from here too?
2009-04-04T17:31:00.000Z	scunizi	christian_	yes
2009-04-04T17:32:00.000Z	christian_	scunizi	and it is normal that i get a list of many things to install?
2009-04-04T17:32:00.000Z	scunizi	christian_	those are called dependancies.. in add/remove they just don't show them to you.
2009-04-04T17:33:00.000Z	christian_	scunizi	ok.. and if i search up the names i showed you in the first "post" and install them like this. Everything os ok?
2009-04-04T17:34:00.000Z	scunizi	christian_	yes.. search tag for install, search for the next, tag. etc.. and then click the apply button
2009-04-04T17:35:00.000Z	christian_	scunizi	is it ok to search up name, mark for installation, search up new name, mark, and press apply in the end?
2009-04-04T17:36:00.000Z	scunizi	christian_	yes.. that's what I was getting at in the last post.
2009-04-04T17:36:00.000Z	christian_	scunizi	oki.. thanx for the help!
