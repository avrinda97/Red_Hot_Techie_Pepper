2011-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	slikts		this OS is a POS, it keeps crashing, freezing, glitching etc. for me
2011-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	slikts		ever since 11.04
2011-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	slikts		great f***** job Canonical
2011-05-24T22:46:00.000Z	slikts		wtf?
2011-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	slikts		"what's the matter" - I just had everything freeze in a row
2011-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	slikts		I'm just trying to do my job
2011-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	slikts		*freeze twice in a row
2011-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	slikts		by freeze I mean even the cursor doesn't move
2011-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	Corey	slikts	Please calm down. :-/
2011-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	slikts		that was this time, but other times I get freezes where the cursor does move
2011-05-24T22:48:00.000Z	slikts		that is the most sever issue, but everything else regarding Xorg and compiz is behaving badly too
2011-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	slikts		going to standby causes my multi monitor settings to be reset or recovered
2011-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	slikts		meaning I need to close and open my laptop lid twice so the second monitor wold work
2011-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	slikts	Omega	11.04 with Unity
2011-05-24T22:50:00.000Z	slikts		and when the multi monitor settings are reset, all the windows are pushed into the one monitor, sometimes out of view
2011-05-24T22:50:00.000Z	slikts	Omega	no shit
2011-05-24T22:50:00.000Z	Corey		!password | kesi
2011-05-24T22:50:00.000Z	Corey	slikts	Again, watch your language please.
