2007-12-17T00:38:00.000Z	Gre2		it
2007-12-17T00:39:00.000Z	Gre2		Is it possible to run it from the HDD and if so, how/where do I need to put it?
2007-12-17T00:39:00.000Z	Gre2		It is currently in iso format.
2007-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	Gre2		I have zero I want to save.  Built the PC yesterday and have been going for about 13 hours with Ubuntu and I am still at square 1
2007-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	Gre2		Video Card
2007-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	Gre2		No, I don't
2007-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	Gre2		I bought 7.04 yesterday
2007-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	Gre2		Well, I bought a book that it was in
2007-12-17T00:41:00.000Z	Gre2		Huge book
2007-12-17T00:41:00.000Z	Gre2		I think I'll start a nice bonfire with it with all the help it's been.
2007-12-17T00:41:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	how much did you paid?
2007-12-17T00:45:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	great !
2007-12-17T00:47:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	which videocard you have ?
2007-12-17T00:48:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	try restricted drivers section
2007-12-17T00:51:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	it's because you don't have the card plugged in I guess
2007-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	sigh
2007-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	i guess 7.10 improved support
2007-12-17T00:53:00.000Z	tacone	Gre2	anyway 7.10 is worth an upgrade routine :-)
