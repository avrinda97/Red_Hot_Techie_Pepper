2008-01-22T03:23:00.000Z	Light		Err, anyone know how to dual boot ubuntu with XP? Not being able to get onto ubuntu without disk.
2008-01-22T03:23:00.000Z	Light		Yes.
2008-01-22T03:23:00.000Z	Light		I tried that.
2008-01-22T03:24:00.000Z	Light		It still boots into windows.
2008-01-22T03:24:00.000Z	Light		Err, yeah.
2008-01-22T03:24:00.000Z	Light		Nothing, just auto boots into windows.
2008-01-22T03:24:00.000Z	Light		I've installed it back on ubuntu, still boots into windows..
2008-01-22T03:25:00.000Z	Light		I did..
2008-01-22T03:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	is your BIOS preventing you from writing to the MBR?
2008-01-22T03:27:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	dd if=/dev/yourdisk bs=512 count=1 | strings :P
2008-01-22T03:27:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	what's the device name of your disk?
2008-01-22T03:30:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	/dev/?
2008-01-22T03:31:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	pastebin sudo fdisk -l?
2008-01-22T03:34:00.000Z	Light	scguy318	http://pastebin.com/d2b16defd
2008-01-22T03:35:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	perhaps GRUB is being written to /dev/sdb when your BIOS boots from /dev/sda?
2008-01-22T03:36:00.000Z	scguy318	Light	that may be the possibility
2008-01-22T03:36:00.000Z	Light	scguy318	I'm suppose to write grub onto sda?
2008-01-22T03:37:00.000Z	Light	scguy318	I'm suppose to put grub onto sda? And not sdb?
