2011-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	djzn		is it normal for a user to see another's user directory and  browse thorugh it in current Natty default install ?
2011-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu	djzn	that means they didnt set propper security
2011-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		proper*
2011-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	djzn	CrunchybitsEatu	but actually, I can delete anything from another user
2011-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	djzn	CrunchybitsEatu	I can only browse and see the files, like in Windows
2011-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		yeah poor security
2011-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		I should take that job at amazon lol
2011-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		the proper way to do it is have a nexus server create MD5 hash marks as the user name then give that user rights over their own directory and hide it with a .fi
2011-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	djzn		is it normal
2011-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	djzn		to access read only another's user dir
2011-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		no djzn
2011-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		someone F'ed up

2011-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	djzn	CrunchybitsEatu	do I need to remove anyone from a group
2011-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		you should email them djzn with screen shots I bet you get a sweet reward
2011-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu	djzn	you can vi groups
2011-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	CrunchybitsEatu		delete them from there or groupdel
2011-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	djzn	CrunchybitsEatu	i take that if you are in the "adm' group, you CAN browse other limited user directories, right
