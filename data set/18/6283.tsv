2008-05-29T09:31:00.000Z	toad-six		help!  i recently tried to apt-get remove gdm, which then tried to remove fast-user-switch-applet
2008-05-29T09:31:00.000Z	toad-six		unfortunately the remove for fast-user-switch-applet failed
2008-05-29T09:31:00.000Z	toad-six		and now i'm stuck
2008-05-29T09:31:00.000Z	toad-six		i can't use apt-get anymore, because it errors out trying to remove fast-user-switch-applet each time
2008-05-29T09:32:00.000Z	toad-six		the error it reports is: Removing fast-user-switch-applet ...
2008-05-29T09:32:00.000Z	toad-six		scrollkeeper-update: error while loading shared libraries: libscrollkeeper.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2008-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	toad-six		when i do ldconfig -v|grep libscroll, no results are returned...but i don't know how to get the lib back, w/o using apt-get (which is broken)
2008-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	toad-six		can anybody help?
2008-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	do   ls  /usr/lib/libscroll*  , do you see any output?
2008-05-29T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	do dpkg -l libscrollkeeper0 , are the first characters in the output ii ?
2008-05-29T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	yet ls  /usr/lib/libscroll* shows nothing?
2008-05-29T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	that's bad. try   sudo apt-get install --reinstall libscrollkeeper0  fast-user-switch-applet , hopefully that will work. Otherwise, we'll get the net and extract it
2008-05-29T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	get from the net, that is
2008-05-29T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	but if that lib is missing, and you're not sure how it disappeared, there might be other issues
2008-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	toad-six	nickrud	- i'm fairly certain that the rest of my system is still intact...
2008-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	I take it the --reinstall didn't work?
2008-05-29T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	that's bad. try   sudo apt-get install --reinstall libscrollkeeper0  fast-user-switch-applet , hopefully that will work. Otherwise, we'll get it off the net and extract it
2008-05-29T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	toad-six	now you should be able to remove the applet
