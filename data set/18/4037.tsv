2009-06-09T03:37:00.000Z	roxie		I recently installed Ubuntu Netbook Remix on my Dell Mini 9 and my wireless is not working. I completely updated everything. What do I do?
2009-06-09T03:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 check the forums for that specific netbook. see if the UNR is reccomended for it.. or the full ubuntu.
2009-06-09T03:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 a lame one.
2009-06-09T03:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 go check the ubuntu wiki pages, and forums - theres proberly guides for that exact netbook.
2009-06-14T02:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 make a script that launches nautilus with the folder name as an argument to open it. perhaps...
2009-06-14T02:52:00.000Z	roxie	Dr_Willis	how do you do that??? i am new to ubuntu...
2009-06-14T02:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 time to learn some shell basics.. make a text file with 2 lines, first one #!/bin/bash, 2nd line nautilus path/to/dir/to/open &
2009-06-14T02:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 or just use the bookmarks feature of nautilus.... thats even easier
2009-06-14T02:54:00.000Z	roxie	Dr_Willis	how do i use the bookmarks feature of nautilus??? i am using ubuntu netbook remix
2009-06-14T02:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 you are using nautilus as your file manager.. run a file manager.. explore it.. you can add shortcits to the left side panel, or the the bookmarks menus...
2009-06-14T02:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 yes... add a bookmark...
2009-06-14T02:56:00.000Z	roxie	Dr_Willis	yes i have done that... now the folder shows but when i click on it, the folder doesnt open
2009-06-14T02:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 it opens here for me.. well it goes to the location i guess you can say...
2009-06-14T02:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 i open a file manager, click on the location in the left panel.. it goes there...
2009-06-14T02:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roxie	 then you need to clarify what is is doing.. I click on the bookmark and it goes to the location.. You mean to say it dosent go to the location or what exactly?
2009-06-14T03:00:00.000Z	roxie	Dr_Willis	ok i bookmarked a folder [the one i want to add to the 'quicklaunch panel' or whatever its called] and it placed it on the panel... but now when i click it, it doesnt open, it just says 'loading folder'
2009-06-14T03:00:00.000Z	roxie	Dr_Willis	yes i guess you could say it doesnt go to the location
2009-06-14T03:02:00.000Z	roxie	Dr_Willis	ok i figured it out... thanks!!! i had to change the name bc it had a ['] in it
