2007-03-11T06:48:00.000Z	sharyari		Hello
2007-03-11T06:48:00.000Z	sharyari		I just encountered somthing I doubt is normal ubuntu behavior... (probably not even ubuntu-related)
2007-03-11T06:50:00.000Z	sharyari		In the middle of playing Diablo II, my keyboard died and so I restarted the computer. Now after the grub boot, nothing happens, it doesn't boot anything. Does this sound familiar?
2007-03-11T06:50:00.000Z	eck	sharyari	i would check your hard drive
2007-03-11T06:50:00.000Z	sharyari	eck	for what?
2007-03-11T06:51:00.000Z	eck	sharyari	if you can't boot your computer, it is likely to be a problem with the hard drive (although there are other candidates)
2007-03-11T06:51:00.000Z	eck	sharyari	at the very least you should fsck it
2007-03-11T06:52:00.000Z	sharyari	eck	ok
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	eck	sharyari	it's also worth giving memtest a go
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	eck		it should be one of the grub boot options
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	sharyari		memtest, doesn't that take hours?
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	eck		depends how much ram you have; you can just let it run overnight
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	sharyari		If I don't get it running, I probably will :P
2007-03-11T06:53:00.000Z	eck		it is probably faster than doing a full badblocks scan of the hard drive though
2007-03-11T06:54:00.000Z	sharyari	eck	well, fsck didn't find anything wrong with my partition :/
2007-03-11T06:55:00.000Z	eck	sharyari	you need to do a full scan to really be sure; it probably just replayed the journal
2007-03-11T06:55:00.000Z	eck		a full scan generally takes at least an hour
2007-03-11T06:55:00.000Z	sharyari	eck	allright :)
