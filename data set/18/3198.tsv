2009-11-19T08:04:00.000Z	rj1		rance94....just stick to C++
2009-11-19T08:04:00.000Z	rj1		Assembler is processor specific
2009-11-19T08:06:00.000Z	rj1		hamsterdam when you put the cd in it will give you a menu
2009-11-19T08:06:00.000Z	rj1		thats where you select install
2009-11-19T08:06:00.000Z	rj1		instead of install there should be an option
2009-11-19T08:06:00.000Z	rj1		to check cd
2009-11-19T08:08:00.000Z	rj1		for C++
2009-11-19T08:08:00.000Z	rj1		make and gcc tutorials
2009-11-19T08:08:00.000Z	rj1		........assembly doesnt HAVE compilers
2009-11-19T08:08:00.000Z	rj1		Assembly has assemblers
2009-11-19T08:10:00.000Z	Doorman352	rj1	We compiled source code written in assembly language hundreds of years ago....
2009-11-19T08:10:00.000Z	rj1	Doorman352	no you didnt you used an assembler to translate assembly
2009-11-19T08:11:00.000Z	rj1	Doorman352	into binary
2009-11-19T08:12:00.000Z	Doorman352	rj1	I'll bow to your obvious expertise, what do I know anyway.
2009-11-19T08:12:00.000Z	rj1	Doorman352	more than I do but terminology does change ;)
2009-11-19T08:27:00.000Z	Doorman352	rj1	not to harp, but check the link I posted..... "Step 2. Compile .asm (source code) to .o (object)"
2009-11-19T08:27:00.000Z	rj1	Doorman352	doorman there is a difference between assembled and compiled languages :D
2009-11-19T08:30:00.000Z	Doorman352	rj1	Don't know if I could argue that nowadays, but back in my day, we compiled code....... Z80, 8080, 8086 era; been a looong time
