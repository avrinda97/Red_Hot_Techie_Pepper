2009-02-24T14:08:00.000Z	WeepingUser		Yes. I have three comps, and I am currently on one of the working ones.
2009-02-24T14:10:00.000Z	WeepingUser		What am I supposed to do with that
2009-02-24T14:12:00.000Z	WeepingUser		I like the setup of the screen I have. Whatever help I can get would be wonderfull, speaking of which I am not well versed in this stuff. Soo...what does aptonCD do?
2009-02-24T14:14:00.000Z	WeepingUser		.....*is confused*
2009-02-24T14:15:00.000Z	WeepingUser		No. It came originally with windows. With much much effort I got unbuntu on it
2009-02-24T14:16:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	I wasnt looking at this window until now.. I also have an Acer Aspire One running ubuntu, was there something you had a problem with?
2009-02-24T14:18:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	the wifi doesnt work right out of the box.. have you tried doing anything, like installing other wifi drivers?
2009-02-24T14:20:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne110L   <--- on that page it has a section for WLan
2009-02-24T14:22:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	does your wired networking work right now, or no?
2009-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	sorry.. what does it do? Is it saying "Disconnected" or something similar after it tries to connect thru a wired connection?
2009-02-24T14:30:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	okay, the exact same thing happened to me as well.. it is a problem with the kernel 2.6.27-11... I fixed it on mine by loading an earlier kernel at boot that I had installed, but if you just installed ubuntu recently you might not have one to choose from..  hrmm
2009-02-24T14:31:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	okay hold on let me see what I can find
2009-02-24T14:38:00.000Z	streenz	WeepingUser	I'm sending you a private message, it should show up as my name by the channel list (where it says #ubuntu on the side)
