2005-04-04T11:26:00.000Z	Quazion		i am still using the default install djp as my main workstation at work
2005-04-04T11:26:00.000Z	Quazion		no need for mp3/divx stuff etc
2005-04-04T11:27:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	do you find it restrictive?
2005-04-04T11:34:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	what do you mean with restrictive. I am having no problems working on it, though some little bugs here and there
2005-04-04T11:36:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	but for "users" i think its not very usefull if you cant watch mpg files etc... though i stopped watching pr0n at the office, which i feel is a good thing :)
2005-04-04T11:40:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	:)
2005-04-04T11:41:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	by restrctive, i meant in terms of file playback i suppose. ie, visitng websites and not using java, flash-plugins etc...
2005-04-04T11:42:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	sounds to me that you are getting by pretty well without though!
2005-04-04T11:42:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	i think i miss java, but not enough to get it installed :)
2005-04-04T11:43:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	with webviewing i miss internet explorer more then flash etc :)
2005-04-04T11:43:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	since some company's i work with have ie only logins :(
2005-04-04T11:44:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	sure...
2005-04-04T11:45:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	completely switched over now to linux... just thinking about taking the big step and trying to survuve with the totally free software thing!
2005-04-04T11:46:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	i think it was installing limewire under ubuntu that made me feel that way. felt like windows all over again, pop-up messages asking me if i wanted to purchase the 'pro' version et al!
2005-04-04T11:48:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	just ask you selve what you really need and stick to that :), though there are good Free download tools like gnutella etc :)
2005-04-04T11:49:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	but personaly if i would need something and its non free i would use it anyways. But i wont "steal" it. if they ask money or i pay or i dont use it.
2005-04-04T11:49:00.000Z	Quazion	djp	but i have one restriction i read the end user licence agreement, and dont use the software if i dont agree with it.
2005-04-04T11:50:00.000Z	djp	Quazion	fair enough. sounds good to me
