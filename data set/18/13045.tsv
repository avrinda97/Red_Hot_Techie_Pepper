2009-11-29T05:52:00.000Z	pro		you can help me? please
2009-11-29T05:53:00.000Z	pro		i need the .deb package
2009-11-29T05:53:00.000Z	pro		where i find all utils commands
2009-11-29T05:54:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	use apt-file
2009-11-29T05:55:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	install it first
2009-11-29T06:04:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	you can narrow it down by searching for /usr/bin/comm instead
2009-11-29T06:04:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	in this case, it's in coreutils package :)
2009-11-29T06:06:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	then you didn't install it correctly.. the file /usr/bin/comm is definitely in the coreutils package
2009-11-29T06:09:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	what does ls /usr/bin/comm say?
2009-11-29T06:11:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	that means the file is installed, try a reboot
2009-11-29T06:13:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	yes, its the coreutils package, what more do you need to know?
2009-11-29T06:13:00.000Z	clearscreen	pro	THERE IS
