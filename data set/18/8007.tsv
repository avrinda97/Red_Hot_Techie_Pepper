2008-02-09T12:11:00.000Z	robc4		it did for me
2008-02-09T12:11:00.000Z	robc4		I had to manually fix it
2008-02-09T12:12:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	what fix did you use?
2008-02-09T12:13:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	I'm getting ready to run the update, from what I've seen here the (hd0,0) changes? Is that what you saw?
2008-02-09T12:13:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	yes, it changes to (1,0) for me
2008-02-09T12:14:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	what did you have as # groot= in your menu.lst ?
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	its commented out, so it doesnt matter
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	maybe it needs to be uncommented
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	yes it does, that's what update-grub uses to rebuild the boot stuff. It should stay with one #
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	does yours have 1,0 ?
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	well its groot=(hd1,0)
2008-02-09T12:16:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	change it to 0,0 , then update-grub won't screw it up again
2008-02-09T12:16:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	perfect, thanks
2008-02-09T12:16:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	let me run it real quick
2008-02-09T12:16:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	now I just have to get ready to rebuild my video drivers ;(
2008-02-09T12:18:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	that did the trick, running update-grub fixed it
2008-02-09T12:19:00.000Z	robc4	nickrud	you think thats something that should be brought to the developers attention?
2008-02-09T12:19:00.000Z	nickrud	robc4	I'm sure they're aware. It's odd that some groot's were bad from the install
