2011-11-02T03:29:00.000Z	Zoohouse		Hello guys
2011-11-02T03:29:00.000Z	Zoohouse		What would happen if I were to completely remove python 2.7?
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	if there is no other python installed  i guess a broken system
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	Zoohouse		What would happen if I were to completely remove python 2.7 from Ubuntu 11.10? Would Unity stop working on reboot?
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	Zoohouse		ekk
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	Zoohouse	iceroot	any easy way to fix it?
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	yes, not removing python
2011-11-02T03:31:00.000Z	Zoohouse		What if I already did?
2011-11-02T03:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	reinstall python
2011-11-02T03:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	and dont reboot
2011-11-02T03:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	before it is fixed
2011-11-02T03:32:00.000Z	Zoohouse	iceroot	I a lot of sys files seemed to be removed. Those wouldn't be reinstalled if I just reinstalled Python2.7, would it?
2011-11-02T03:32:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	how you removed python?
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	with apt-get?
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	Zoohouse		Synaptic iceroot
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	ok then just reinstalling python is enough
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	Zoohouse		ok
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	iceroot	Zoohouse	it will pull everything back needed
