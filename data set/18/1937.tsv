2010-10-06T10:56:00.000Z	collosi	dstryr	 did you port forward port 22 on your router?
2010-10-06T10:57:00.000Z	collosi	dstryr	did you verify, locally, that you can ssh into the server?
2010-10-06T10:57:00.000Z	dstryr	collosi	how would i do that?
2010-10-06T10:59:00.000Z	collosi	dstryr	 can you verify the sshd is running
2010-10-06T11:00:00.000Z	dstryr	collosi	i just did a restart of ssh
2010-10-06T11:00:00.000Z	collosi	dstryr	 try this $ps -aux | grep sshd
2010-10-06T11:01:00.000Z	dstryr	collosi	-aux: command not found
2010-10-06T11:04:00.000Z	collosi	dstryr	 yes, like Leroy said use nmap after to verity the port is open, you can also try this: netstat -t -l
2010-10-06T11:09:00.000Z	collosi	dstryr	 then try to ssh in to your server
