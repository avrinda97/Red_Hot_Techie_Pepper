2010-02-08T17:20:00.000Z	farizluqman		yes
2010-02-08T17:20:00.000Z	farizluqman		a very simple question
2010-02-08T17:20:00.000Z	farizluqman		how can I loggin as root?
2010-02-08T17:21:00.000Z	farizluqman		I know the sudo command, but I want to log in as root, to access the / files
2010-02-08T17:22:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	Why?
2010-02-08T17:22:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	As Myrtti says, all can be done with sudo.
2010-02-08T17:23:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	What are you trying to do?
2010-02-08T17:24:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	You're not making what sense.
2010-02-08T17:25:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	You should never, ever, ever, EVER log into an X session as root. EVER. EVER EVER EVER.
2010-02-08T17:27:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	Well, that's the best way to describe it. We can't support that method.
2010-02-08T17:33:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	Do cp -R ~/oxygenicon ~/.icons
2010-02-08T17:36:00.000Z	MenZa	farizluqman	Er, not exactly.
