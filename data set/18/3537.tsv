2010-11-26T21:42:00.000Z	trijntje		I want to use Ubuntu to fix errors on a NTFS partition. How can I do this?
2010-11-26T21:44:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	don't try
2010-11-26T21:45:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	you can force mount it or make a backup with dd but use windows to fix errors recover files etc
2010-11-26T21:46:00.000Z	trijntje	Dmole	I've tried chkdsk, it crashes without fixing it
2010-11-26T21:47:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	did you do a SMART test?
2010-11-26T21:47:00.000Z	trijntje	Dmole	Disk Utility (from live cd) say's SMART is not supported for that drive
2010-11-26T21:49:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	try "dd -if /dev/sd? -of /dev/null" , if ir errors out with a crc or something your drive is dead
2010-11-26T21:49:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	where "?" is your drive letter
2010-11-26T21:49:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	this will take a while
2010-11-26T21:52:00.000Z	trijntje	Dmole	ill do that, thanks
2010-11-26T23:15:00.000Z	trijntje	Dmole	dd to /dev/null did take a long time, but returned no errors
2010-11-26T23:22:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	that would indicate your dive might be OK, it's just the FS that is mucked up
2010-11-26T23:23:00.000Z	trijntje	Dmole	yeah, so thats good news. Thanks again for the advice
2010-11-26T23:47:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	can you mount the FS at all?
2010-11-26T23:49:00.000Z	trijntje	Dmole	yes, windows can boot, but it keeps BSOD-ing me. I've already backed up all important data
2010-11-26T23:50:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	then the FS is not your problem it's windows
2010-11-26T23:50:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	try a windows repair
2010-11-26T23:52:00.000Z	Dmole	trijntje	or if you backed up then just format reinstall
