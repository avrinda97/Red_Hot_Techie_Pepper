2008-08-08T23:35:00.000Z	leeping2008		Anyone here know if the severe lockup bugs in Hardy have been fixed by now?
2008-08-08T23:36:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	lockup bugs?
2008-08-08T23:36:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	try disabling your acpi
2008-08-08T23:37:00.000Z	leeping2008	mlLK	I'm running Gutsy with no problems.  I'm just wondering about problems in Hardy
2008-08-08T23:37:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	no snags here
2008-08-08T23:37:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	occasional hang on install
2008-08-08T23:38:00.000Z	leeping2008	mlLK	thanks :)
2008-08-08T23:39:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	i've found that disabling the acpi and booting in safe graphics is your most sure-fire way for installing ubuntu on buggy hardware
2008-08-08T23:40:00.000Z	leeping2008	mlLK	and kaiwen , I don't think it's an installation problem or related to acpi :) As I said before, my computer has no problems with running Gutsy, and I'm not installing Ubuntu .. I'm merely considering it
2008-08-08T23:40:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	w/ heron they've added a gui for acpi options
2008-08-08T23:42:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	you should install it as a vm
2008-08-08T23:42:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	give it a test run
2008-08-08T23:43:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	you can install vm in windows w/ heron's iso
2008-08-08T23:44:00.000Z	leeping2008	mlLK	ah that's a good idea :) But if the lockup is hardware related, I might not encounter the bugs!
2008-08-08T23:44:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	word
2008-08-08T23:46:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	lol i think all heron haters are just linux haters in general
2008-08-08T23:49:00.000Z	leeping2008	mlLK	and kaiwen, thanks for the advice.  I'll remember it for when I do my hardy installation
2008-08-08T23:49:00.000Z	mlLK	leeping2008	your welcome, good luck!
