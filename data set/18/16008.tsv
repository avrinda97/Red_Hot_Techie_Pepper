2011-07-24T15:49:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	can you be more precise about what you're trying to achieve?
2011-07-24T15:50:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	ok... what's wrong with the version in the repo?
2011-07-24T15:52:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	what's wrong with the ppas?
2011-07-24T15:53:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	does natty include the versions you need?
2011-07-24T15:55:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	that's cos you've got "LTS releases only" in your updater thingy
2011-07-24T15:56:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	run the update manager, and under "settings/updates" near the bottom of the dialog
2011-07-24T15:57:00.000Z	StevenR	thefirstdude	what's your client machine?
