2007-06-15T05:08:00.000Z	TheShocker		hey :)
2007-06-15T05:09:00.000Z	TheShocker		for some odd reason nautilus doesn't know how to handle it's own links :\
2007-06-15T05:10:00.000Z	TheShocker		in the computer.png you can see the 19GB drive is recognised in the sidebar ok, but the link in the main window is busted
2007-06-15T05:10:00.000Z	TheShocker		error message when you click:  couldn't display "computer:///Filesystem.desktop". the location is not a folder
2007-06-15T05:10:00.000Z	stefg	TheShocker	looks like character-encoding problems...
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	TheShocker	stefg	hmm, because of the %20 etc?
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	TheShocker		that wouldn't explain why Filesystem.desktop does the same :\
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	TheShocker		only thing I changed today was install and uninstall gdesklets and gdesklets-data
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	stefg	TheShocker	yes.. what OS is the server running?
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	TheShocker		language settings are still the same as when I installed, never fiddled with that
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	TheShocker		SMB server? well, there isn't one
2007-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	TheShocker		goes wrong before it even tries the server
2007-06-15T05:13:00.000Z	stefg	TheShocker	errmmm.. but you are brosing a local net in your screenies
