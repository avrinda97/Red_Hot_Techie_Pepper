2012-08-11T11:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		Josh2838383, look above your last post
2012-08-11T11:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		Josh2838383, do you have whatever OS that is on the computer now completely backed up, preferably a clone?
2012-08-11T11:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		Josh2838383, so all you want and need is xubuntu
2012-08-11T11:19:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		Josh2838383, boot a xubuntu disc hit instal and follow the instructions, I would open the gparted partitioner before hitting the install and just delete any partitions first.

2012-08-11T11:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	bekks	The user was asking for a install I have no info about a install already, but thanks for sharing.

2012-09-29T23:07:00.000Z	bekks	wilee-nilee	It's a... well... complex layout, yes :)
2012-09-29T23:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	bekks	Having partitions out of numerical order is a noob mistake, bad juju. ;)
2012-09-29T23:09:00.000Z	bekks	wilee-nilee	Partitions are bad juju nowadays - there's LVM :)

2012-10-20T04:37:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	bekks	Hehe I knew something was wrong cat as I know it is just a text read in the terminal.
