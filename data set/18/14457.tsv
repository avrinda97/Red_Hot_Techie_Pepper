2011-12-29T00:41:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	hi
2011-12-29T00:41:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	compared to...?
2011-12-29T00:41:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	10.04 is supported a full two years longer than 11.10
2011-12-29T00:42:00.000Z	surfdue	reisio	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation does this manual apply to 10.04 too
2011-12-29T00:42:00.000Z	surfdue	reisio	i also have the option of 10.04 and 11.04 what do you think ?
2011-12-29T00:42:00.000Z	surfdue	reisio	im sorry i mean 10.10
2011-12-29T00:43:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	it should apply, yes
2011-12-29T00:43:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	how'd we get onto 10.10?
2011-12-29T00:43:00.000Z	surfdue	reisio	these are the full options 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS lucid, 10.10 maverick, 11.04 natty, 11.10 oceiric
2011-12-29T00:43:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	10.04 is supported longer than any other version available ATM, that's what would make the decision for me
2011-12-29T00:44:00.000Z	surfdue	reisio	cool. what exactly does rts stand for
2011-12-29T00:44:00.000Z	reisio	surfdue	LTS? long term support
