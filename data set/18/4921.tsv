2009-01-13T18:10:00.000Z	xanxor		Hi, I wonder if someon could help me get my microphone configured? I know a lot of people have problems with it in Ubuntu and I've done everything I've read about, but it doesn't work. Yes, I've enabled microphone and capture everywhere I can find the option to.
2009-01-13T18:12:00.000Z	xanxor		night tux
2009-01-13T18:13:00.000Z	xanxor		Can someone help me with my microphone at all? I believe I have everything enabled that I should, but it still doesn't work.
2009-01-13T18:14:00.000Z	xanxor		Sorry to keep repeating myself - can somebody help me with my microphone? I mean, does the silence mean no one knows/wants to help?
2009-01-13T18:15:00.000Z	fourdots	xanxor	did you check if it's muted maybe in gnome alsa mixer?
2009-01-13T18:16:00.000Z	xanxor	fourdots	yes, I checked in alsamixer.
2009-01-13T18:16:00.000Z	xanxor	fourdots	it's not muted in alsamixer.
2009-01-13T18:16:00.000Z	xanxor	fourdots	hang on, I'll just check again.
2009-01-13T18:17:00.000Z	xanxor	fourdots	now when I went into alsamixer, capture was enabled but the volume set to 0, even though I turned up the volume last time. I tihnk it resets itself or something.
2009-01-13T18:17:00.000Z	xanxor	fourdots	I don't see an option for microphone either, just capture and master.
2009-01-13T18:19:00.000Z	fourdots	xanxor	you should enable mic control iin the edit -> Sound card properties
2009-01-13T18:21:00.000Z	xanxor		Can anybody please help me with my microphone? I have enabled capture in alsamixer and enabled the microphone in the volume settings thingy you get in the GUI.
2009-01-13T18:21:00.000Z	xanxor		It still doesn't work. Please, anyone?
2009-01-13T18:22:00.000Z	xanxor		Also, whenever I enable the microphone under the volume settings thing in the top right corner of the screen, whenever I go back to it, it's disabled again. How do I fix that?
2009-01-13T18:22:00.000Z	xanxor		Like, I try to enable the microphone but the setting doesn't stick.
2009-01-13T18:23:00.000Z	xanxor		Does anybody know how to make this setting stick? I go to the volume controls accessed from the top right corner of the screen and enable the microphone but it just disables itself again.
2009-01-13T18:26:00.000Z	xanxor		So nobody can help me with my microphone settings problem, then.
2009-01-13T18:27:00.000Z	fourdots	xanxor	I've got sound problems myself... ;-)
