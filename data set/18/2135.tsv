2011-09-12T17:05:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	repeat question?
2011-09-12T17:12:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	i did i fresh format and a fresh install of ubuntu 11.04  on my harddrive  and it willnot boot up
2011-09-12T17:13:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	bios boot up order set correctly?
2011-09-12T17:13:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	yes
2011-09-12T17:14:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	do u think its because i formated it ext 4 or something
2011-09-12T17:15:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	live cd works perfect
2011-09-12T17:16:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	live cd is running from the cd, so doesn't prove the hard drive is working fine. Have you tried re-installing? Well i can't advice anything else. Try another hard drive.
2011-09-12T17:17:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	i did put another  drive in to yesterday
2011-09-12T17:19:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	then i guess i can't help:/ does it show an error? What happens exactly when you boot up?
2011-09-12T17:21:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	in live cd boots up and regulary just a black screen with a blinking curser
2011-09-12T17:24:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	not really. did you format your harddrive for ubuntu before installation?
2011-09-12T17:25:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	yes during install
2011-09-12T17:25:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	hmm.. what happens during boot? does anything show up?
2011-09-12T17:26:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	no just bios steps
2011-09-12T17:27:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	is there a better hard drive formatter then in disk utilities
2011-09-12T17:28:00.000Z	ServerTech	luc_	it may be memory problems. Try running the memory test on the cd? I can't really think of anything else.
2011-09-12T17:28:00.000Z	luc_	ServerTech	because it did have windows 7 on it before
