2004-09-04T10:53:00.000Z	lamont	doko	gcc-3.3_1:3.3.4-9ubuntu1??
2004-09-04T11:29:00.000Z	doko	lamont	if the gcc packages failed to build, please send me the logs (or maybe the last 100 lines ...)
2004-09-04T12:16:00.000Z	lamont	doko	OK. one more round on ppc...
2004-09-14T16:14:00.000Z	lamont	doko	found it.
2004-09-14T16:18:00.000Z	doko	lamont	sorry, didn't see.
2004-09-14T16:18:00.000Z	lamont	doko	np.  I knew that I had a bug that had the needed info in it, just couldn't find it for a bit.. (was closed a while back..)
2004-09-14T12:25:00.000Z	doko	lamont	do you know, what probably is wrong with gcc-3.4's sonames?
2004-09-14T12:26:00.000Z	lamont	doko	no clue 
2004-09-17T16:01:00.000Z	doko	lamont	gcc-3.4 is not yet built?
2004-09-17T16:03:00.000Z	lamont	doko	ubuntu5 built on all 3 architectures
2004-09-17T16:04:00.000Z	doko	lamont	hmm, only ubuntu4 is in the archives.
2004-09-17T16:07:00.000Z	lamont	doko	any chance you added new binary packages?
2004-09-17T16:13:00.000Z	lamont	doko	what elmo said...  gcc-3.4 can't upload libgcc1.
2004-09-20T10:45:00.000Z	lamont	doko	about?
2004-09-25T08:52:00.000Z	lamont	doko	which - the 24 hour delay on sending email?
2004-09-25T08:54:00.000Z	doko	lamont	pitti: yes, so we've checked the first 40 dsa's twice. doing something else now.
2004-09-25T08:59:00.000Z	lamont	doko	the issue was that I got yanked away from composing the email yesterday, and told pitti status in IRC.  He thought it was partial status (wasn't), and I was reminded of that in scrollback this morning... sorry about that.
2004-09-25T08:59:00.000Z	lamont	doko	but any work you've done on the universe packages isn't duplicate.....
