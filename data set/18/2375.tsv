2010-06-01T22:35:00.000Z	fsa		Looking for somebody to help me verify this is a general problem and not just with my computer: When I go to http://zombiesmash.gamedrs.com/ (a game for iPhone) using FIREFOX, my X crashes right away. Please don't click if you're not ok with your X potentially crashing.
2010-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	it worked fine for me no crash
2010-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	try opening it with another browser
2010-06-01T22:38:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	In firefox go to help > about mozilla firefox and tell me  your current version
2010-06-01T22:39:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	It's 3.6.3. Current release for my 10.04, I believe. My system is fully updated, and I haven't really played around with it anything either.
2010-06-01T22:40:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	do you have flash player corectly installed?
2010-06-01T22:42:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	To the best of my knowledge, yes. I have no problem watching videos on Youtube, for instance. Earlier today I DID install something flashy in WINE though, but surely that can't have anything to do with this? (I needed to do "winetricks flash" to be able to run a WIN32 app.)
2010-06-01T22:43:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	when did this 'glitch' start? when was the last time you restarted your computer?
2010-06-01T22:45:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	It started with the crash of X when I tried watching that page. I did that the first time about an hour ago. Since then I've been in slight shock and tried it almost a dozen times, all to the same effect. I've also restarted and tried again - same result.
2010-06-01T22:46:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	sounds like a firefox problem; try uninstalling and reinstalling firefox
2010-06-01T22:48:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	'sudo apt-get autoremove firefox' then 'sudo apt-get install firefox' should work; good luch fsa
2010-06-01T22:49:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	Hmm... You know what? I think I'll try to open that page using another profile first. If that doesn't work I'll give the reinstallation a shot. Thanks!
2010-06-01T22:49:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	Profile in Firefox, that is.
2010-06-01T22:49:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	good luck :)
2010-06-01T22:50:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	ty :)
2010-06-01T22:50:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	If I'm gone soon you know why...
2010-06-01T22:54:00.000Z	fsa	gbillings_	FYI: It worked without problems when I opened it in another Firefox profile. I suppose my real profile got corrupt somehow. Thanks for your help.
2010-06-01T22:56:00.000Z	gbillings_	fsa	you can delete your firefox profilesettings with sudo rm -rf ~/.mozilla
