2012-09-27T06:08:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		okay i think i see your issue battlefield
2012-09-27T06:08:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		it seems to be related to hw encryption - what type of encryption (if any) are you using on the wireless net?
2012-09-27T06:10:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		oh ok thank you
2012-09-27T06:12:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		maybe its disconnected or ajar?
2012-09-27T06:12:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		@very
2012-09-27T06:13:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		rtl8192se this is the driver your usin
2012-09-27T06:15:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	hmm.. the monitor works actually. but in the monitor preferences it's displayed as "Unknown" so i cannot select the higher resolutions.
2012-09-27T06:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	very	strange - how is it connected? hdmi?
2012-09-27T06:18:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	vga. but until yesterday it worked. it displayed the correct monitor name and resolutions.
2012-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	there are automatic upgrades everyday. i'm not sure which were yesterday.
2012-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	software upgrades.
2012-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	very	i see - what graphics driver did you do?
2012-09-27T06:22:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	i'm not sure. and i'm not sure where to look for it. i'm using an integrated intel controller.
2012-09-27T06:23:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	i'm not sure if i made changes to xorg.conf when i started to use the monitor months ago. maybe it got overwritten somehow if i did.
2012-09-27T06:24:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	very	very possible
2012-09-27T06:25:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	very	that is sounding more like it - if you had something custom and your update wiped it - then it makes sense that xorg set your monitor up with some defaults non optimal size/res settings
2012-09-27T06:25:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	very	possibly ubuntu made a backup when that occured?
2012-09-27T06:34:00.000Z	very	SolarisBoy	the last modification of xorg.conf was in june. probably that's a good thing. something else has to be the problem.
