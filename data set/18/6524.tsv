2008-05-03T04:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	johninLex	the other thing you could try is to reboot and hit the "Delete" key when the computer beeps.. that should dump you into the bios setup screen look in there to see if the cd is listed.. then escape save and

2008-05-03T04:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	johninLex	no.. it should have installed a generic.. however booting from an Ubuntu live cd.. if that doesn't work then maybe the cd is not the 1st item on the boot list in bios.. if it is and still doesn't boot then the cd is probably bad :(
