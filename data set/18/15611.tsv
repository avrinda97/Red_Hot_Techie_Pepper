2005-02-22T17:22:00.000Z	Danila		I think it burned ok. I can, of course, try to check it to be sure...
2005-02-22T17:23:00.000Z	Danila		actually, even the "disk-check" (or disk-test) item on the menu doesn't work - it brings a "kernel...... something test something" command, blinks the LED on the DVD for a while and drops me into the boot menu again.
2005-02-22T17:24:00.000Z	Danila		Would it make sense to try burning the disk again or is there anything else to try?
2005-02-22T17:26:00.000Z	Danila		:)
2005-02-22T17:27:00.000Z	Danila		Westerners always think I am. But in the sad, boring reality Danila is just a traditional male name in Russia. :-(
2005-02-22T17:27:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	I would try to burn the CD again. Mabye at slower speed. The first ubuntu CD I burned didn't work
2005-02-22T17:28:00.000Z	Danila	Wolven	I will do it now.
2005-02-22T06:36:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	I don't know if this helps, but you can install ubuntu first and then enable the network to upgrade/download/install suff
2005-02-22T06:39:00.000Z	Danila	Wolven	Well, sadly this doesn't seem very helpful... :) I mean, I don't think upgrading a fresh LiveCD would help much. It's probably the old "Unix being picky about who it is friendly with". Nothing ever works for me correctly...
2005-02-22T06:40:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	that's not what I meant. =) try to install it without the network first, then setup the network
2005-02-22T06:43:00.000Z	Danila	Wolven	Do you mean install completely without network support? I really wanted to see if I'd like Ubuntu using the LiveCD. To install I'd need to resize partitions and that would take too much time...
2005-02-22T06:44:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	sorry my bad... I thought you meant the installer CD
2005-02-22T06:45:00.000Z	Danila	Wolven	it's ok. But do you have any idea what could be causing the problem? (after setting up Networking preferences for the first time all applications stop launching)
2005-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	I have no idea.. Does your PC work proppery with another LiveCD like Knoppix ?
2005-02-22T06:47:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	You mean on your PC or in general?
2005-02-22T06:48:00.000Z	Danila	Wolven	Or may be it's just that I was too stupid to find out how to set it up there. On my PC I couldn't make Knoppix to work with Internet.
2005-02-22T06:48:00.000Z	Danila	Wolven	Ubuntu, on the other hand, works (albeit the speed is apparently quite slow - subjectively).
2005-02-22T06:48:00.000Z	Wolven	Danila	Knoppix works fine on the internet for me, but I need to modprobe my network card first
