2007-01-18T16:20:00.000Z	trymmi		I really can't get streaming videos in firefox to work..
2007-01-18T16:20:00.000Z	trymmi		Could anyone help me?
2007-01-18T16:21:00.000Z	trymmi		Does anyone know how to make video streaming in firefox work?

2007-01-18T16:22:00.000Z	dxdt	trymmi	for me it was just a matter of installing the codecs from wherever I got them, I don't quite remember, then installing mozilla-mplayer which is the mplayer plugin.  Most things just work.  Newest quicktime doesn't... that makes me sad... but everything else does.
2007-01-18T16:41:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	Right. I've installed all the codecs I could find.. Bad, ugly, etc.. And now I have audio... Still no video :<
2007-01-18T16:42:00.000Z	dxdt	trymmi	hmmm I don't know.  The only thing I could suggest trying is using the w32codec package and mozilla-mplayer.  Are you using totem right now in firefox?  i could never  really get it to play things right.
2007-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	How do I change all that? Could I perhaps add you to MSN to talk about it? IRC is so stressfull..
2007-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	you here mate?
2007-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	dxdt	trymmi	pretty easy to do w32codecs just do https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/WindowsCodecs  then remove the totem mozilla plugin and install mplayer-mozilla.  Make sure mplayer itself is installed.  And then the next time you open ffox it should be there.  At least, that's all I had to do.
2007-01-18T16:49:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	Installing the codecs now!
2007-01-18T16:54:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	When I go to remove the totem mozilla plugin it says that it will also have to remove "Ubuntu Desktop". That sounds like something I don't want to do..
2007-01-18T16:55:00.000Z	dxdt	trymmi	actually that's not that bad.  It isn't nearly as scary as it sounds.  Ubuntu-Desktop is a meta package that is basically a list of all the default packages that kinda come in the gnome desktop.
2007-01-18T16:56:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	Well, what happens if I remove it?
2007-01-18T16:56:00.000Z	dxdt	trymmi	so when you remove it, you are basically saying like "Hey, I'm changing some of the default progs installed"  I removed mine a long time ago.  I never saw a difference.  Like I and the other guy said, it is a metapackage, not a real program per say.  You can always actually just reinstall it too. But yeah I removed it the first day and never looked back.
2007-01-18T16:59:00.000Z	trymmi	dxdt	IT WORKED! Thanks a bunch! On to virus-free porn!
2007-01-18T16:59:00.000Z	dxdt	trymmi	hehe  no problem!
