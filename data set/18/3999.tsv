2009-06-16T06:19:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	I dont know what to tell you past that.
2009-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	no, the router port forwards *to* ubuntu, ubuntu has no choice or say in the matter, really.
2009-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	ubuntu actually treats it like a connection from within the network
2009-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	Nkipp	stealth-	 i dont understand why port forwarding is working for me then on this router
2009-06-16T06:10:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	I seriously doubt it has anything to do with ubuntu
2009-06-16T06:11:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	do you have that port open on your ubuntu machine?
2009-06-16T06:12:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	well, what port are you trying to forward?
2009-06-16T06:12:00.000Z	Nkipp	stealth-	 27015
2009-06-16T06:13:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	what service uses that port?
2009-06-16T06:13:00.000Z	Nkipp	stealth-	 a counter strike source game server
2009-06-16T06:14:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	do you have the server running on your machine? port forwarding wont do anything if nothing is listening at the port
2009-06-16T06:15:00.000Z	Nkipp	stealth-	 what? its like it worked perfectly fine with the old router and i do not know what i am doing wrong
2009-06-16T06:16:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	did the old router work with ubuntu and your counter strike server?
2009-06-16T06:16:00.000Z	Nkipp	stealth-	 yea the old router was just fine and all i did was port forward
2009-06-16T06:17:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	well then its something to do with your router, not ubuntu. Or you changed something on your ubuntu machine
2009-06-16T06:18:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	the computer system never talks to the router in great detail, the router just sends all data it gets on that port directly to the server. If ubuntu was working with it before, but not this time, then its not ubuntu's fault, something is mis-configured with the router
2009-06-16T06:18:00.000Z	Nkipp	stealth-	 i have changed nothing but its just so weird that the router works on one operating system but not the other
2009-06-16T06:20:00.000Z	stealth-	Nkipp	sorry, but I cant think of any way it would be OS related
