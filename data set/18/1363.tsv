2011-03-12T00:08:00.000Z	Gagatan_		weird.. karmic found my screen automatically.. reinstalled with maveric, and only get 1024x768 on part of screen and no recognized screen.. any help appreciated
2011-03-12T00:08:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	which video card?
2011-03-12T00:10:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	Intel 82852/855GM (Dell X300) according to lspci
2011-03-12T00:10:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	Intel drivers are included with OS. Everything should work. Problem is with limited resolution?
2011-03-12T00:11:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	yep.. System->Preference->Monitors shows no recognized monitors.. so I cannot set it to 1920x1200 or whatever
2011-03-12T00:11:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	we are talking about a laptop right... you can't set resolution to external monitor or built-in?
2011-03-12T00:12:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	yes, laptop. external monitor.. benq 24". laptop is in dockingstation with lid/screen down
2011-03-12T00:12:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	is picture on both screens on?
2011-03-12T00:15:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	I thought it wasn't. but I opened the lid/screen and now have mirrored screens
2011-03-12T00:16:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	there in lies your problem... on your laptop there should be function key to switch completely to external display... then resolution will be ok
2011-03-12T00:17:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	Fn-F8 you mean? seems it doesn't want to jump to external only..
2011-03-12T00:18:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	try few times as it cycles trough modes...
2011-03-12T00:20:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	nopes.. I'll try restarting on misc level
2011-03-12T00:20:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	nope what? sorry problems tracking everything :D
2011-03-12T00:44:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	no changes even with rebooting with both screens up. with karmic it found both screens and I could disable one of them if I liked to. now it only find 1 screen but its undetected
2011-03-12T00:45:00.000Z	Gagatan_	MeanEYE	and Fn-F8 one or more tries doesn't work either
2011-03-12T00:45:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	and the function key is not working?
2011-03-12T00:47:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Gagatan_	you got me stuck. :)... problem with resolution is that screens are in mirror mode and max resolution represents max resolution of your laptop monitor
