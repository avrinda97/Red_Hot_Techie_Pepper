2008-12-20T05:28:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	I'm using kubuntu and just logged into myspace with konqueror just fine :|
2008-12-20T05:29:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	Ok what are your settings to do it?
2008-12-20T05:29:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	As i for the life of me couldnt
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	nothing special, just set up flash player now in it... but i don't know if it will work
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	mostly defeault
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	is your system completely up to date?
2008-12-20T05:30:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	yip might be cause I used the repo from kubuntuguide
2008-12-20T05:31:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	one thing though, if I have "enable plugins on demand only" enabled (which is default), flash player won't play on youtube
2008-12-20T05:32:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	when I unmark that box, it starts playing flash
2008-12-20T05:33:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	I can play youtube no problem
2008-12-20T05:36:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	 Your a gensuis<sp> it has worked
2008-12-20T05:36:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	what did it? :O
2008-12-20T05:37:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	delete cookies and cache and away it went
2008-12-20T05:37:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	weird, I have that one enabled, plugin issue then?
2008-12-20T05:38:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	well, glad it's working for you now :)
2008-12-20T05:38:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	yip hey have you got FF installed?
2008-12-20T05:38:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	btoogood	ya but I used it because flash wouldn't play, but just now figured it out so I might try konq for a stretch ^^
2008-12-20T05:39:00.000Z	btoogood	OxDeadC0de	Konq is cool very nice in KDE 4.0.1
