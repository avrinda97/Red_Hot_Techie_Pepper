2006-12-10T16:19:00.000Z	ernz		:( My phone keeps asking for a passcode when I try to connect using bluetooth, but nothing is being accepted, can someone help please?
2006-12-10T16:20:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	I had that problem. I think I solved it b editing a file in /etc somewhere. Hang on, I'll have  look
2006-12-10T16:20:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	I would be EXTREMELY grateful.
2006-12-10T16:21:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	Looks like /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf (open it with a text editor as superuser)
2006-12-10T16:21:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	any idea what I change in here? Perhaps you could pastebin yours :) ?
2006-12-10T16:22:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	Looking through that there is "# Default PIN code for incoming connections | passkey "1234";"
2006-12-10T16:25:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	that still isn't working :(    I am having no problems sending TO the computer, just FROM. This is really starting to bug me I have been trying for 4 hours solid now to get this to work.
2006-12-10T16:26:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	Ah, I haven't done that in a while, and I'm on my laptop at the moment which I haven't set up for Bluetooth yet. What I do know is that Konqueror is the easiest program to use after setting it up
2006-12-10T16:27:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	Perhaps I should switch to Kubuntu?
2006-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	Konqueror runs fine in Ubuntu, but it may install quite a bit of stuff to get it running
2006-12-10T16:29:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	50MB of "Extra stuff" to be precise :)
2006-12-10T16:30:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	If you install it with Apttude then removing it with Aptitude later will also remove that stuff
2006-12-10T16:31:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	I plan on figuring out how to install everything and make it work, then start from scratch with a fresh edgy install and then add everything by textbook. Cleaner that way. The only thing I haven't figured is DAMNED BERYL!!!!!!
2006-12-10T16:32:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	I tried using Beryl. It installed, but just came up a wiggly splash screen then restarted X :(
2006-12-10T16:33:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	I got it working after hours of screwing around, then I changed my X server to 2048x1024 and it stopped working.
2006-12-10T16:39:00.000Z	Warbo	ernz	As I said "Konqueror is the best program to use *after you have set it all up*" :)
2006-12-10T16:40:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	It looks nice. IF ONLY I could get this blasted pass key thing sorted. It's starting to really **** me off now.
2006-12-10T16:52:00.000Z	ernz	Warbo	IT WORKS!!!!! It just needed a restart! How Awesome is that!??????
