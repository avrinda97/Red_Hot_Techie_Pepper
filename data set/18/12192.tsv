2006-06-14T05:58:00.000Z	scheuri		yoe...best would be to add a bug at launchpad and inform the devs
2006-06-14T05:59:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	wouldn't that require me to have a launchpad account?
2006-06-14T05:59:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	yes, it doesn require you to have an account...but that is easy to get...
2006-06-14T06:00:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	I prefer not to do that. I've got way too many accounts already, I'll just forget otherwise.
2006-06-14T06:01:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	well, your choice...but AFAIK is Launchpad for bugreports on ubuntu...
2006-06-14T06:01:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	point being, I'd appreciate it if there were a way for me as a DD to inform Ubuntu people that "hey, you've got a problem there"
2006-06-14T06:02:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	well, I am not a DD, so...I cant really help you there...:)
2006-06-14T06:02:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	but if it is in main-repo...you should have that possibility
2006-06-14T06:03:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	that's what I mean. I can understand them not caring as much about universe, but since they've put it in main...
2006-06-14T06:04:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	well, as I said...I am not the right person to speak to...maybe a polite mail to one or some Ubuntu-Devs might help
2006-06-14T06:04:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	I'll just post something on my blog (which is aggregated on Planet Debian). Hopefully that'll result in something.
2006-06-14T06:04:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	frankly...blogs are in my opinionen not the right place for such things...its public..people get offended...
2006-06-14T06:05:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	I don't easily offend people :)
2006-06-14T06:05:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	and I intend to write this in a totally non-confrontational way.
2006-06-14T06:05:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	I did NOT say that...:)...people GET offended sometime
2006-06-14T06:06:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	well, it is up to you...for sure...I'd just thought that a mail before blogging might help
2006-06-14T06:06:00.000Z	Yoe	scheuri	sure. IME, there's not much difference there between mail and blog posts, though.
2006-06-14T06:06:00.000Z	scheuri	Yoe	well, I think there still is...but as I said...it is up to you...:)
