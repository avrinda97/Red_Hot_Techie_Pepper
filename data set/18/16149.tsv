2007-03-11T07:02:00.000Z	sandeep		how to install downloaded files in ubuntu
2007-03-11T07:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	you know about install/remove and synaptic, right ?
2007-03-11T07:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	you hardly ever need to download and install - the package manager does it for you
2007-03-11T07:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	or open add/remove programs, search for kaffeine
2007-03-11T07:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	it will ask for your user password when you click to install
2007-03-11T07:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	Ubuntu uses sudo and has no root password by default - your first user's password is the sudo password
2007-03-11T07:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	you use sudo or gksudo - read the url the bot sent you
2007-03-11T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	it is done automatically by the package manager
2007-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	as we said before , kaffeine is installed with the package manager
2007-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	as are almost any apps you will need
2007-03-11T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	so start with add/remove in the applications menu - search for your apps and click to install - that's about it really
2007-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	and the password it will ask for is *your* password, not a root password
2007-03-11T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	what are you running ? amd64 ? i686? ppc?
2007-03-11T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sandeep	kaffeine is in the main repository, so it is there unles you have changed something
