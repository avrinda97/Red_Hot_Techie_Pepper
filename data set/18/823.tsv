2011-09-12T04:25:00.000Z	Scunizi		Suddenly (I think after the last update) my numeric keypad on my desktop stopped working.  I looked at the configuration for the keyboard and it's correct.. Any ideas how to fix this?  I use it a lot.
2011-09-12T04:25:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	did you try hitting numlock?
2011-09-12T04:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	DOH!...... several times
2011-09-12T04:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	an even or odd number of several times? =P
2011-09-12T04:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	both..
2011-09-12T04:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	wireless keyboard?
2011-09-12T04:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	nope.. MS cumfort curve 2000 which is recognized by the system.. Oh.. this is the release prior to 11.04 and unity.. ie 10.10
2011-09-12T04:27:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	if you CTRL+ALT+F2 does it work?
2011-09-12T04:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	yep.. no issues getting to the TTY
2011-09-12T04:28:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	does numpad work there
2011-09-12T04:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	I'll check..
2011-09-12T04:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	it does work there.. (my password is a mix of number and characters.. )
2011-09-12T04:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	any other clues to check? or a diagnostic solution?
2011-09-12T04:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	I think I figured it out, or at least what the problem is. I even knew the solution a year ago but can't remember it.. the numeric keypad is now an assistive device and moves the mouse.  I checked the preferences for Assistive Tech. and nothing it ticked for keyboard.  There use to be a hot key combination that would toggle the numeric keypad between assistive and "keypad".. do you know what that hot key combo is?
2011-09-12T04:35:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	shift+numlock I thought
2011-09-12T04:36:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	I doubt we both have =P
2011-09-12T04:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	alkafoo	both solutions worked..
2011-09-12T04:36:00.000Z	alkafoo	Scunizi	naturally if shift+numlock works [ctrl+alt+]shift+numlock might work
