2011-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	DogEars		Why do people use Virtual box instead of qemu with Aqemu?
2011-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	vbox is working better for me
2011-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	OK on 11.04?
2011-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	let me try. Didn't boot it since upgrade. Especially 3D acceleration is better supported in vbox. Yeah, its workign perfectly
2011-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	I will install and try. Thanks
2011-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	which guest os are you planning to run with it?
2011-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	XP pro
2011-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise
2011-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	It is to run a business app
2011-05-01T15:35:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	Does 7 run OK?
2011-05-01T15:35:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	lol, I'm running photoshop and illustrator inside that virtual machine and it's running flawless ;)
2011-05-01T15:37:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	Virtualbox - ose ?
2011-05-01T15:37:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	I think the upgrade removed the non-ose version, so it's ose now. Both working great
2011-05-01T15:42:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	Nevermind, it's the non-ose version
2011-05-01T15:43:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	Whats the difference?
2011-05-01T15:44:00.000Z	Incarus6	DogEars	some firmware and proprietary things are better supported
2011-05-01T15:45:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	The repository only lists the OSE versions
2011-05-01T15:47:00.000Z	DogEars	Incarus6	The VB website has all versions available. Downloading atm
