2012-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	? , plz explain it clearly
2012-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	google "boot-repair iso" download that iso from sourceforge and boot with it.. it's very easy to use
2012-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	you know how to burn an .iso right?
2012-11-01T12:13:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	 ok !
2012-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	maybe your cd drive is poop .. it's easy to make a usb ubuntu-installer with pendrive's usb universal maker
2012-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	can i use LIVE USB ubuntu , to solve MBR problem
2012-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	if you can do usb-boot, you can use pendrive's usb maker for the boot-repair iso probably.. (i'll check)
2012-11-01T12:16:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	there's an option of 'Try unlisted iso' with pendrive usb maker..
2012-11-01T12:17:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	the ubuntu-live may have the boot-repair app contained in it.. dunno
2012-11-01T12:17:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	d'nt worry jagginess  , i will try boot it
2012-11-01T12:18:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	but why use a tool that's not safe? next time use boot-repair :)
2012-11-01T12:18:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	you sure there's a problem with either the drive or cd?
2012-11-01T12:19:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	i think  with hard disk , while installing OS using live USB ,MBR  Error : can't find where am i now
2012-11-01T12:31:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	cuore_ : fresh OS means new .iso (to which you want to upgrade)
2012-11-01T12:32:00.000Z	jagginess	polp	are you using a live-linux?
2012-11-01T12:38:00.000Z	polp	jagginess	yes
