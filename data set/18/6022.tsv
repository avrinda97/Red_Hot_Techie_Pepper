2008-07-13T02:56:00.000Z	TehMarz		I tried to install the ATI accelerated graphics driver, but when I rebooted I was greeted by nothing but a black screen. Anyone know why this could be?
2008-07-13T02:57:00.000Z	Neo_The_User	TehMarz	go to the ATi website intall latest drivers
2008-07-13T02:58:00.000Z	TehMarz	Neo_The_User	Is the driver suggested by Ubuntu not updated, then?
2008-07-13T02:58:00.000Z	Neo_The_User	TehMarz	trust me. envy sucks with video stuff for ATi
2008-07-13T02:58:00.000Z	Neo_The_User		and the accelerated driver without envy is up to date
2008-07-13T02:58:00.000Z	Neo_The_User		but you dont have the driver. just the accelerator
2008-07-13T02:59:00.000Z	TehMarz	Neo_The_User	Would the latest driver allow dual monitors?
2008-07-13T02:59:00.000Z	Neo_The_User	TehMarz	are you using linux 32bit or 64 bit?
2008-07-13T02:59:00.000Z	Neo_The_User		yes
