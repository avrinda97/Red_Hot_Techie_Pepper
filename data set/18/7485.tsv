2008-01-13T01:41:00.000Z	Xintruder		Guys, I installed the latest nvidia driver manually. How do I enable it now?
2008-01-13T01:42:00.000Z	Xintruder		guys?
2008-01-13T01:43:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	Why did you do it manually?  Are you using an old version of Ubuntu?
2008-01-13T01:43:00.000Z	Xintruder	FrostRat	Because xlv advised me to do so, also, because gutsy installs an older driver
2008-01-13T01:45:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	It's been a while since I've done it manually, but I believe the readme on the site walks you through everything
2008-01-13T01:46:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	did you have to modify your xorg.conf by hand?  Once you've done that, the next time you start x it should be ok
2008-01-13T01:47:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	It's a good idea to print out the readme before you do it... you've got a few steps to follow exactly.  As alil234 says, the latest Ubuntu will install one for you, and it's really easy.
2008-01-13T01:48:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	just checked the site, looks like the script they've got there should configure pretty much everything for you
2008-01-13T01:50:00.000Z	Xintruder	FrostRat	it should, when it completes 'successfully', i reboot, run compiz and then ubuntu tries to install nvidia-glx-new! and im like what theh ell?!?
2008-01-13T01:50:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	I've never bothered with compiz... couldn't tell you. :(
2008-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	Xintruder	FrostRat	:( bah....... this sucks.. lol.
2008-01-13T01:51:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	it probably doesn't realize you've got it installed, since you didn't install the driver through apt-get / synaptic
2008-01-13T01:52:00.000Z	Xintruder	FrostRat	your right, thats why i was thinking of to enable it or something ><
2008-01-13T01:52:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	so I guess you were having problems with the driver Ubuntu gives you?
2008-01-13T01:53:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	I'd still go the Ubuntu way, unless you absolutely can't... less headaches
2008-01-13T01:53:00.000Z	Xintruder	FrostRat	tried that for like 5 days man, posted everywhere... seems like theres no solution yet....
2008-01-13T01:55:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	You could always do compiz manually, too. :D  Not sure how hard that is, though.
2008-01-13T01:57:00.000Z	FrostRat	Xintruder	If you were to download it and compile it yourself, just as you did with the driver.  But that might be a bit difficult/confusing if you're not used to that kind of thing... and as I said, I've never been into compiz, so I'm not sure what it would take.
