2006-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	hastesaver		what is vmware? Can I use it to install another OS on top of Ubuntu?
2006-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	the answer is yes
2006-05-17T08:10:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	thanks!
2006-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	there's awiki about using kqemu too - which is quicker than qemu
2006-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	thanks, I'll look for it.
2006-05-17T08:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KQEmu  <-- look here for enhanced qemu speed
2006-05-17T08:19:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	thanks. The Qemu page also mentions KQemu and -- at least at first glance -- different instructions... which one should I follow?
2006-05-18T07:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	worked for me...
2006-05-18T07:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	did you follow the full instructions? And is this on breezy?
2006-05-18T07:29:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	yes, on breezy
2006-05-18T07:29:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	and I just used the insQEMU.sh script, instead of the other detailed one
2006-05-18T07:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	the whole thing compiled and installed flawlessly here
2006-05-18T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	I used the script too
2006-05-18T07:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	As far as I can see, the full instructions are "download the script and run it" -- is there something more?
2006-05-18T07:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	hmm, I did it a while ago...
2006-05-18T07:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	I actually don't really remeber to be honest
2006-05-18T07:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hastesaver	you have build-essential installed etc?
2006-05-18T07:34:00.000Z	hastesaver	thoreauputic	yes
