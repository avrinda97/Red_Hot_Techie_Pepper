2012-10-01T03:52:00.000Z	Guest56408	Benn	Haha! I forgot to laugh, this is meant to be a Ubuntu Support, not a bloody comedy stand up chat room
2012-10-01T03:54:00.000Z	Benn	Guest56408	just ask your question instead of just saying that you have a problem with Wine. It's hard to not be a jerk when things like that happen.
2012-10-01T03:55:00.000Z	Guest56408	Benn	I have, now I want support please, is that any better, and you don't know me. So how? the hell I'm i jerk them ;-)??
2012-10-01T03:56:00.000Z	Benn	Guest56408	I was calling myself a jerk. All I know is that you downloaded a game successfully.
2012-10-01T04:00:00.000Z	Guest56408	Benn	Yes, I know then after that process Wine didn'e load the game I had download
