2006-06-14T15:00:00.000Z	geeksauce		crap, i thought it was done dowloading the update...it was just starting
2006-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	geeksauce		does the ubuntu server edition have a gui?
2006-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	nope
2006-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	Servers don't NEED X :P
2006-06-14T15:04:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	not really
2006-06-14T15:07:00.000Z	geeksauce	Kyral_FreeBSD	i don't know very much about linux, so installing a dedicated ftp server or something like that would be quite difficult without knowing my way around the whole setup
2006-06-14T15:07:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	HowtoForge.net is your Friend :D
2006-06-14T15:08:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	already has :P
2006-06-14T15:09:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	IntelMacs == Core Duo == Normal x86 :D
2006-06-14T15:11:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	I'm sure it can. Have I seen it yet? Nope
2006-06-14T15:12:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	In theory there is no reason why not
2006-06-14T15:13:00.000Z	geeksauce	Kyral_FreeBSD	i like to mess around with mac osx, i'm learning linux, and i know xp like the back of my hand.
2006-06-14T15:13:00.000Z	geeksauce	Kyral_FreeBSD	therefore, it would be nice to tri-boot
2006-06-14T15:23:00.000Z	geeksauce	Kyral_FreeBSD	you'd reccommend that over ubuntu?
2006-06-14T15:23:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	for old systems
2006-06-14T15:24:00.000Z	geeksauce	Kyral_FreeBSD	it's old, but it can run windows server 2k3 just fine, the only sucky thing is the 1 mb onboard video chip
2006-06-14T15:33:00.000Z	geeksauce	Kyral_FreeBSD	what was that link you sent me in reference to setting up ubuntu server?
2006-06-14T15:34:00.000Z	Kyral_FreeBSD	geeksauce	Look around on HowtoForge :D
