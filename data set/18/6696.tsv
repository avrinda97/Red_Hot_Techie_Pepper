2008-11-23T10:48:00.000Z	jazzyditty		it's cool. so, just google  "zero a drive"?
2008-11-23T10:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	You want to zero a drive?
2008-11-23T10:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Easiest way is "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/SDXX"
2008-11-23T10:49:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	I'm pretty sure that needs a sudo too
2008-11-23T10:58:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Try it with sudo?
2008-11-23T10:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Pretty much
2008-11-23T10:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Type "where sudo"
2008-11-23T10:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Sorry, "type sudo"
2008-11-23T11:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Yeah
2008-11-23T11:01:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	sudo before it
2008-11-23T11:01:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	"sudo dd if..."
2008-11-23T11:02:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	If you're getting permissions erros, it's because your user isn't allowed to access the drive directly
2008-11-23T11:02:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Give this a read:
2008-11-23T11:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	You're logged in right now with an account
2008-11-23T11:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	You don't know the password to login to your accoutn?
2008-11-23T11:05:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Are you on the live cd?
2008-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	Well :P
2008-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	jazzyditty	I doubt zero'ing the drive will do anything
