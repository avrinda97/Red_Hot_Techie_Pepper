2010-10-08T05:57:00.000Z	coz_	rusivi	 rather bugs
2010-10-08T05:58:00.000Z	coz_	rusivi	 understood...however I read that he wanted to know the "place" to report bugs   but I agree about the possibility it may not be a bug
2010-10-08T05:59:00.000Z	rusivi	coz_	/ mamece2: it may be a support question, then one would want to perform a "question" against the package versus a bug.
