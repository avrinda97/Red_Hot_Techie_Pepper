2008-09-08T03:33:00.000Z	enhazed		i was wondering if i could get some help with updating my drivers in ubuntu. i think it would solve a few glitches - especially visual. but i haven't been able to figure out how to do that by reading the help forums... grateful for any help, thanks
2008-09-08T03:34:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	what kind of issues are you experiencing might be better to look into the reason
2008-09-08T03:36:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	what vid card?
2008-09-08T03:40:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	what worked from erUSUL ? the command he gave was to get the card info?
2008-09-08T03:43:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	did you ever share the card info with us? i must have missed it.
2008-09-08T03:44:00.000Z	enhazed	tj83	no, sorry, i thought i'd just look for it myself... it's Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03) - any help finding a driver much appreciated :)
2008-09-08T03:44:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	did you enable the restricted driver?
2008-09-08T03:45:00.000Z	enhazed	tj83	there's no restricted driver to enable, the "hardware drivers" window is empty...
2008-09-08T03:47:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	perhaps you should check the /etc/X11/xorg.conf to see what driver is being loaded
2008-09-08T03:47:00.000Z	enhazed	tj83	i don't know how to do that, sorry
2008-09-08T03:48:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2008-09-08T03:48:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	that makes a back up first
2008-09-08T03:48:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	then gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-09-08T03:49:00.000Z	enhazed	tj83	ok, the file opened
2008-09-08T03:49:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	under configured video device
2008-09-08T03:51:00.000Z	enhazed	tj83	it's http://paste.ubuntu.com/44357/plain/ - not much video info
2008-09-08T03:51:00.000Z	tj83	enhazed	seems like it didnt detect it at all... /join #seaphor
2008-09-08T03:52:00.000Z	enhazed	tj83	ok, will do that. thank you
