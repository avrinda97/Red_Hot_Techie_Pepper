2005-04-16T14:26:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	was asking for a SERVER :)
2005-04-16T14:27:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	I use a combination of webmin for the gui and proftp for the server
2005-04-16T14:28:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	yeah
2005-04-16T14:29:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	hit webmin.com and have a look around, it can control everything
2005-04-16T14:31:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	yeah it's probably as easy as it gets
2005-04-16T14:31:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	wait one second..I seem to remember a nice graphical config tool...
2005-04-16T14:32:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	yeah forget webmin/proftpd, there is a gui server
2005-04-16T14:34:00.000Z	WeirdAl	afrosheen	don't leave me guessing :-O!
2005-04-16T14:34:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	I'm googling..totally forgot the name of the package
2005-04-16T14:36:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	ok got it
2005-04-16T14:36:00.000Z	afrosheen	WeirdAl	install proftpd and gproftpd, the gui frontend :)
