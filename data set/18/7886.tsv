2009-03-20T22:32:00.000Z	kalle_		i have a pk3 file with wrong checksum in ET / TCE. Help me
2009-03-20T22:33:00.000Z	binarymutant	kalle_	you can still use the pk3 file can't you?
2009-03-20T22:33:00.000Z	kalle_	binarymutant	what do you mean
2009-03-20T22:33:00.000Z	kalle_		when iam connecting to a server it says i have a pk3 file with wrong checksum
2009-03-20T22:34:00.000Z	kalle_		tcetest/mp_bin.pk3
2009-03-20T22:34:00.000Z	binarymutant	kalle_	download it from the server?
2009-03-20T22:35:00.000Z	binarymutant	kalle_	just remove it, if the server allows automatic downloading
2009-03-20T22:35:00.000Z	kalle_	binarymutant	it doesn't exist (anymore) on the server's site
2009-03-20T22:35:00.000Z	kalle_		so i donwloaded it somewhere else
2009-03-20T22:35:00.000Z	kalle_		but not workin
2009-03-20T22:36:00.000Z	kalle_		i have a local file with wrong checksum   tce/mp_bin.pk3
2009-03-20T22:36:00.000Z	binarymutant	kalle_	if the server doesnt have it then you don't need it
2009-03-20T22:36:00.000Z	kalle_		yes i need it
2009-03-20T22:36:00.000Z	binarymutant		then its not a pure server
2009-03-20T22:37:00.000Z	kalle_		because when i connect to that server it tries to download it
2009-03-20T22:37:00.000Z	binarymutant		try a new server? the checksum means someone else edited it
2009-03-20T22:38:00.000Z	kalle_		and the server worked very well few days ago when i had the ubuntu 8.04 but now i have 8.10 and all the problems
2009-03-20T22:38:00.000Z	binarymutant	kalle_	it's not an OS problem
