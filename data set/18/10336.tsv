2007-09-14T10:21:00.000Z	Tsukasa		can someone please help me get ubuntu installed on my raid0 array? it has two ntfs partitions, one of which i want to keep the other i dont care
2007-09-14T09:26:00.000Z	Tsukasa		hey guys, is anyone here familiar with getting ubuntu to install on raid arrays? im sitting here on the livecd with ntfs-3g and dmraid installed
2007-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	Adlai	Tsukasa	you need to use the alternate CD
2007-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	why is that?
2007-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	Adlai		because it has support for installing to software raid
2007-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	Adlai		and the normal install CD doesn't
2007-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	are you referring to dmraid?
2007-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	Adlai		yes
2007-09-14T09:28:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	i installed it on the livecd
2007-09-14T09:28:00.000Z	Tsukasa		its working
2007-09-14T09:28:00.000Z	Adlai		yes, but the installer on the normal livecd doesn't support installing to a raid array
2007-09-14T09:28:00.000Z	Adlai		I know, it seems annoying and non-intuitive
2007-09-14T09:29:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	ohh. cant i just make the partition via terminal and do a .... whats that debian command for changing where apt-get installs to
2007-09-14T09:29:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	and just apt-get the entire installation
2007-09-14T09:29:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	debootstrap
2007-09-14T09:29:00.000Z	Adlai	Tsukasa	well you can always perform the whole installation yourself
2007-09-14T09:29:00.000Z	Adlai		that should work fine
2007-09-14T09:30:00.000Z	Tsukasa	Adlai	that seems easier given that its like 3 or 4 terminal commands
