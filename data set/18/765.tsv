2011-09-20T09:26:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	my apologies, net died: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Slickness+Black?content=73210
2011-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	ah, so it does support it directly.. i have no idea then :\
2011-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	i THINK you can specify different settings for the gnome-panels in their properties if i'm not mistaken
2011-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	attempted that -- no dice! seems it's all set correctly.
2011-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	yes :D
2011-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	that's currently what i'm running, lol
2011-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	would be great if you could advise :-)
2011-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	be aware though that you will have absolutely nothing running in terms of panels
2011-09-20T09:30:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	so the top/bottom panel, will cease to exist?
2011-09-20T09:30:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	indeed. if you disable unity but don't substitue anything else - you won't have anything
2011-09-20T09:31:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	I strictly use command key shortcuts and gnome-terminal to use my computer now
2011-09-20T09:31:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	hrmm -- doesn't seem too be what I'm looking for! ;-), thanks anyway!
2011-09-20T09:31:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	though i have a fancy vintage screenlet clock that looks really nice against my background :o
2011-09-20T09:32:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	i'm gonna get you a screenshot, hold on xD lol.. just because i'm proud of it
2011-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	ok, no problems!
2011-09-20T09:34:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	http://cl.ly/291P2J123G2Q3v1D1h2G
2011-09-20T09:36:00.000Z	bz_	mordof	looks nice, similar to my desktop when I was running cairo-dock, I had no top/bottom panels.
2011-09-20T09:36:00.000Z	mordof	bz_	:)
