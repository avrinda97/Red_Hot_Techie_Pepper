2006-03-20T09:47:00.000Z	Kelsey23		Ive used VNC
2006-03-20T09:48:00.000Z	Kelsey23		But I belive that Terminal Services is superior
2006-03-20T09:48:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Kelsey23	well i want to be able to access my computer from a friends house.. will Terminal Services do that?
2006-03-20T09:49:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Kelsey23	ive been reading the forums about vnc4server, and vnc viewer, and using ssh to tunnel... is all this necessary?
2006-03-20T09:49:00.000Z	Kelsey23	OmegaAlpha	Terminal Services is for Windows Server systems, so probably not
2006-03-20T09:49:00.000Z	Kelsey23	OmegaAlpha	Get VNC if you are on Linux
2006-03-20T09:50:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Kelsey23	that i am.. is it necessary to use ssh along with vnc?
2006-03-20T09:50:00.000Z	Kelsey23	OmegaAlpha	 Bope
2006-03-20T09:50:00.000Z	Kelsey23	OmegaAlpha	 *Nope

2006-03-20T09:51:00.000Z	Kelsey23	OmegaAlpha	Yes
2006-03-20T09:52:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Kelsey23	r0bin, how do i do that from a win box? do i need to install a windows program to do so at the windows box (client)
2006-03-20T09:53:00.000Z	Kelsey23	OmegaAlpha	Yes, you need a client for Windows

2006-03-20T09:56:00.000Z	Kelsey23		I enjoy communication with people on IRC in Blowfish encryption
2006-03-20T10:02:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Kelsey23	do you remember what the client computers had to download in order to access the linux server?
