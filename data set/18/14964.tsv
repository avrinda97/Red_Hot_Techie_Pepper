2005-12-15T08:58:00.000Z	Kujila		can anyone help me?  -  The mac won't boot off the CD :(
2005-12-15T08:58:00.000Z	Kujila		Me or Madpilot?
2005-12-15T08:59:00.000Z	Kujila		I don't think it is but I will MD5 it to make sure I guess
2005-12-15T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	are you holding the "C" key at the chime?
2005-12-15T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	yes, that is how the mac knows to boot from the cd
2005-12-15T09:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	in OSX, go to the preferences > startup disk  and choose the cd
2005-12-15T09:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	then restart your mac
2005-12-15T09:05:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	: It says "Select the system you want to  use to start up your computer" and shows "Mac OS X 10.4.2 on Mac Disk"  and  "Network Startup"
2005-12-15T09:06:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	then you need to check your iso image integrity, and burn it using a burning software that doesnt start with "disk utility". also burn it as slowly as possible
2005-12-15T09:08:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	Is it possible to burn the PowerPC Ubuntu ISO on a Windows PC?
2005-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	it is possible, check your iso images md5 integrity and burn it slowly https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Verify
2005-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	Thank you very much
2005-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	Thanks
2005-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	The MD5 test passed successfully on the ISO, and I had burnt the CD @ 8x on a CD-R
2005-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	try it as slow as it will burn
2005-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	ok will do ty
2005-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	Kujila	nalioth	8x is the minimum it says
2005-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	nalioth	Kujila	that sounds weird, i can burn at 2x
