2007-12-26T04:12:00.000Z	World		Greetings and Merry Christmas all! Question= Is there anything that plays midi music embedded in web pages for Ubuntu?
2007-12-26T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	World	what a horrible horrible thing to ask.. ... ... you should be ashamed of yourself.. ... but yes.. I think there is
2007-12-26T04:13:00.000Z	World		slart maybe but I'm new to ubuntu
2007-12-26T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	World	I think there is some kind of plugin... can't remember the name.. but it makes all those..*shudder* old pages with midi background music work =)
2007-12-26T04:14:00.000Z	Slart	World	midi music on webpages is just as bad on windows as it is on ubuntu =)
2007-12-26T04:14:00.000Z	World		slart thanks. Some of us old farts still use midi.
2007-12-26T04:15:00.000Z	Slart	World	oh.. don't get me wrong.. the midi format is good.. I just hate web pages that insist on playing music
2007-12-26T04:15:00.000Z	Slart	World	you'll probably want to use timidity for playing midi's on ubuntu
2007-12-26T04:15:00.000Z	Slart		!timidity
2007-12-26T04:15:00.000Z	Slart		!midi
2007-12-26T04:15:00.000Z	World		slart me too, that's why I create them. Annoyance brings attention. lol
2007-12-26T04:16:00.000Z	Slart		ah.. there you are, world.. look at that link from ubotu
2007-12-26T04:17:00.000Z	World	phrantik	thanks lol
2007-12-26T04:19:00.000Z	World		OK I have TiMidity++ and it plays excilent on comand, however when I open a webpage with midi embedded it does not play.
2007-12-26T04:20:00.000Z	Slart	World	perhaps this one will help.. it's not the one I remember.. but it says it will play IE only bgsound midis https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1765
