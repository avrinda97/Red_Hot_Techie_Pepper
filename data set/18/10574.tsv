2006-12-05T16:22:00.000Z	Engrish		if an iso write keep failing at the same file is it a bad iso or bad disk?
2006-12-05T16:23:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	what error message do you get? hard to know without that =(
2006-12-05T16:26:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	did you get a md5 file with the iso, or did your burner program create it prior to burning?
2006-12-05T16:28:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	so you created it yourself prior to burning?
2006-12-05T16:28:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	 and then when the cd is burnt the image written to the disc fails the check?
2006-12-05T16:30:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	sounds like a broken disc imho, could be broken cd-burner/cd-reader, but broken disc is most likely
2006-12-05T16:38:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	try burning some other iso to that same cd-rw
2006-12-05T16:38:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	and you'll know if it's the cd-rw that fails
2006-12-05T16:40:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	take a look at http://www.distrowatch.com for a lot of different isos =)
2006-12-05T16:40:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	dunno any specific offhand
2006-12-05T17:21:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	it failed with another iso too?
2006-12-05T17:21:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	=(
2006-12-05T17:22:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	yes you do =)
2006-12-05T17:22:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	 you could try using instlinux if you want to install without adding any other bootable media
2006-12-05T17:22:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	haha
2006-12-05T17:23:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	http://sourceforge.net/projects/instlux it only does ubuntu 6.06, but you can always upgrade
2006-12-05T07:06:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	ok =(
2006-12-05T07:07:00.000Z	Doow	Engrish	did you try instlinux?
