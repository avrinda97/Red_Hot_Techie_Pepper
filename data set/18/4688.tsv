2009-03-04T04:29:00.000Z	puff		Hiyo... I'm installing ubuntu on a box that has no network.  Is there a way I can download a bunch of packages to a CD to use instead ofa repo?
2009-03-04T04:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	if another computer has ubuntu on it you could copy the contents of /var/cache/apt/archive to this computer?  just install/update everything you need on the ubuntu with network connection

2010-04-21T02:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	you will love the linux permissions on files when copying to ntfs - but if that's not an issue, it *should* be fine.

2010-08-17T03:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	don't do "partial" upgrades.  it will break things.
2010-08-17T03:15:00.000Z	puff	ZykoticK9	Good point.
2010-08-17T03:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	use "sudo aptitude safe-upgrade" from cli instead
2010-08-17T03:15:00.000Z	puff	ZykoticK9	Where does the lock file live?
2010-08-17T03:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	partital upgrade = the only time i use aptitude
2010-08-17T03:16:00.000Z	puff	ZykoticK9	Do you know where the apt/upgrade manager lock file is?
2010-08-17T03:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	not really - could you reboot?  if one locked up?
2010-08-17T03:16:00.000Z	puff	ZykoticK9	I could reboot, I guess, would that clean up the lock file?
2010-08-17T03:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	i believe so
2010-08-31T03:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	add /etc/default/grub set GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" and update grub
2010-08-31T06:11:00.000Z	puff	ZykoticK9	I think it depends on the hardware.  On mine, it's always eth1.
2010-08-31T06:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	puff	you have unusual hardware then
2010-08-31T06:12:00.000Z	puff	ZykoticK9	Maybe, ibm thinkpad t43p.
