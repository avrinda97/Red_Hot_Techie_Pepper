2008-09-20T21:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	did you do "sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox-3.0" ?
2008-09-20T21:31:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	will try right now
2008-09-20T21:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	No... I was just asking since you said v2 is still there...
2008-09-20T21:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	You *can* try "sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox-2" though
2008-09-20T21:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	if it is proving confusing, search the known installed packages for the firefox start script: "dpkg-query -S '/usr/bin/firefox' " - that will help work out which package needs to be removed
2008-09-20T21:35:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	I'll do that right now
2008-09-20T21:37:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	will try reinstalling
2008-09-20T21:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	how about the other firefox-2 files?
2008-09-20T21:38:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 don't see any
2008-09-20T21:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	okay... check places like /usr/lib/firefox just-in-case
2008-09-20T21:39:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 ok
2008-09-20T21:41:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 ok, will re-install ff 3.0
2008-09-20T21:41:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 brb
2008-09-20T21:45:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 ok... worked
2008-09-20T21:45:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 big thanx
2008-09-20T21:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	what was the solution?
2008-09-20T21:46:00.000Z	rxndx	IntuitiveNipple	 removing the /usr/bin/firefox app and changing the launcher to launch firefox-3.0 %u instead of firefox %u
2008-09-20T21:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rxndx	That doesn't sound correct - the firefox-3.0 package should install its own /usr/bin/firefox script
