2008-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	racarter		i need help figuring out why this linux machine isn't online
2008-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	racarter		i can't ping yahoo for example
2008-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	racarter		physically everything looks ok, and nothing has really changed on the machine
2008-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	racarter		i think you should use the sun java jre
2008-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	racarter		does banging your pc help fix it?
2008-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	racarter		i see no good reason why this machine should not be online
2008-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	racarter		no damn good reason i tell you
2008-01-08T09:14:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	what is the issue? please be precise
2008-01-08T09:15:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	sounds like a hardware issue--if you have a specific support question then ask away--if you just want to kibbutz then join #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-01-08T09:16:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	what card and chipset for that nic?
2008-01-08T09:16:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	when did it stop working
2008-01-08T09:17:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	it was working before? before what--what happened or was it just sudden you did nothing
2008-01-08T09:18:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	dont paste in the channel but is there a iwconfig listing at all?
2008-01-08T09:19:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	then your wireless card is not recognized; was it working with ubuntu before? gutsy I assume
2008-01-08T09:28:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	 all sorted then?
2008-01-08T09:29:00.000Z	racarter	bazhang	yes i think so
2008-01-08T09:29:00.000Z	bazhang	racarter	tried it out yet? if it still doesnt work then ask again and we can likely sort it out
