2011-01-05T14:52:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	try changing your routers encryption
2011-01-05T14:53:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	I've tried both WPA and WPA2 so there's no choice left.
2011-01-05T14:54:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	althoug, for temporary diagnostic purposes, I guess I should try WEP too, or leave the network unencrypted.
2011-01-05T14:54:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	is it a fresh install and is the routers firmware up to date ?
2011-01-05T14:54:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	wep is the same as no encryption
2011-01-05T14:54:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	very true
2011-01-05T14:55:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	did you try changing the wifi channel ?
2011-01-05T14:55:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	yes, fresh install, fresh computer (netbook) and firmware should be up to date, haven't check for a while though
2011-01-05T14:55:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	yes, and that seems to fix the problem for a few hours. always comes back
2011-01-05T14:55:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	(that's the really weird part...)
2011-01-05T14:57:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	reason 1...unspecifiedReason...Client associated but no longer authorized.
2011-01-05T14:57:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	looks like its loosing authentication for some reason
2011-01-05T14:58:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	Hmm, weird. Any ideas how to diagnose further?
2011-01-05T14:59:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	im not to shur about anything else..
2011-01-05T14:59:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	and how would that result in packet loss?
2011-01-05T15:00:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	or, well, I guess the problem is what causes the packet loss (or connectivity trouble), which then causes also dropped authentication when it gets bad.
2011-01-05T15:01:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	Ileden	im not shur
2011-01-05T15:02:00.000Z	Ileden	chibihogoshino	well, thaks for trying to help anyway!
