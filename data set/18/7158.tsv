2009-07-15T06:38:00.000Z	StrangeCharm__	dreamy	check that. also, when you say 'home directory' are you referring to the directory that a user is given when they log into the server?
2009-07-15T06:38:00.000Z	dreamy	StrangeCharm__	i think used that when i had to set  a server to boot from lan im not shure if its the same
2009-07-15T06:38:00.000Z	dreamy	StrangeCharm__	anywhere .. where the remote guest gets into
2009-07-15T06:39:00.000Z	StrangeCharm__	dreamy	that's set on a per-user basis, often with a deafult. check your conf file, or edit the settings?
2009-07-15T06:39:00.000Z	dreamy		k..
2009-07-15T06:39:00.000Z	dreamy	StrangeCharm__	i can only access trougth the browser usign ftp:// and the dir is empty
2009-07-15T06:39:00.000Z	dreamy		no pass asked
2009-07-15T06:40:00.000Z	StrangeCharm__		Interphase-  does the right-click menu indicate that you're clicking a flash object, or what?
2009-07-15T06:41:00.000Z	dreamy	StrangeCharm__	where is a dir called pub ? you know ?
2009-07-15T06:41:00.000Z	StrangeCharm__	dreamy	you'll have to log into the server, physically, or with ssh or similar to make those changes
2009-07-15T06:43:00.000Z	StrangeCharm__		Interphase-  because that's the default text that appears if you can't render the appropriate objects
2009-07-15T06:43:00.000Z	dreamy	StrangeCharm__	 ok.. but then a question about somth a bit different , when doing ssh (ip name) on my local newtork i get no user name asked .. i just have to type a passwrord i dont know wich
2009-07-15T06:47:00.000Z	StrangeCharm__		dreamy you need to specify the username at the command, like ssh username@host
2009-07-15T06:50:00.000Z	dreamy	StrangeCharm__	:ok thanks
