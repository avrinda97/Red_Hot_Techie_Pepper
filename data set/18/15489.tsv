2006-10-11T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie	ajtraynor	make the windows entry the default, and remove any "savedefault" lines in menu.lst
2006-10-11T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie		or keep default=0 and move windows to the top.  usually where you want your default anyway
2006-10-11T09:13:00.000Z	ajtraynor	vlt	i dont know how to do that?
2006-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	sproingie	ajtraynor	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst.  it's just a text file
2006-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	ajtraynor		and what do i type in
2006-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	ajtraynor		default =0
2006-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	sproingie	ajtraynor	what we said.  delete all the lines that say "savedefault" and move the windows entry (which is at the bottom) to the top
2006-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	ajtraynor		ah right cool
2006-10-11T09:15:00.000Z	ajtraynor		i get that through gnome
2006-10-11T09:15:00.000Z	sproingie	ajtraynor	the "top" meaning before the line that says BEGIN AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST anyway
