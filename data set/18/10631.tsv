2007-04-21T14:20:00.000Z	freakabcd		if I upgrade from edgy -> feisty using the update-manager thingy from the menu, it will still save the packages in /var/cache/apt/... right?
2007-04-21T14:20:00.000Z	freakabcd		cos i am going to upgrade my laptop and then use the packages to upgrade my other machine as well
2007-04-21T14:21:00.000Z	freakabcd		And is there any limit on the size of /var/cache/apt/... ?
2007-04-21T14:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	freakabcd	Yes, but that doesn't mean you will be able to revert to the previous packages
2007-04-21T14:21:00.000Z	freakabcd	Jordan_U	previous packages?
2007-04-21T14:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	freakabcd	I just wanted to be sure that you didn't thik that because the packages were there that you could go back to Edgy after the upgrade :)
2007-04-21T14:25:00.000Z	freakabcd	Jordan_U	no
2010-10-14T09:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	freakabcd	It's a controversial decision, most of the community disagrees with that statement.
2010-10-14T09:13:00.000Z	freakabcd	Jordan_U	ah, ok.
2010-10-14T09:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	freakabcd	No, there aren't.
