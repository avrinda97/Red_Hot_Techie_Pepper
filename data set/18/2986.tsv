2010-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	tolkad		Hey, I'm the sysadmin for a small startup and we run our servers on ubuntu
2010-05-22T10:18:00.000Z	tolkad		We had a little accident and I'm trying to restore from a backup. I used an encryption program that came with ubuntu and I'm trying to figure out how to decrypt. Can anyone help?
2010-05-22T10:18:00.000Z	tolkad		Please, I need to get the servers back up and running soon...
2010-05-22T10:19:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	"an encryption program" is not enough information.
2010-05-22T10:20:00.000Z	tolkad	mneptok	The command for it is "md5"
2010-05-22T10:21:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	md5 is a checksumming tool, not encryption.

2010-05-22T10:22:00.000Z	tolkad	mneptok	It's the program I used to encrypt the files before storing them on the backup drive
2010-05-22T10:23:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	so you wrote a Perl script and you don't know what it did?
2010-05-22T10:24:00.000Z	tolkad	mneptok	I do know what it did, it made a tarball of the files and then encrypted them with md5 and then stored the encrypted data in a file on the external drive
2010-05-22T10:24:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	so you obviously passed md5 arguments to the script, use the reverse md5 to decrypt
2010-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	tolkad	mneptok	Where can I get the reverse md5?
2010-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	tolkad	mneptok	I tried reading the md5 manual page, I can't figure it out
2010-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	waht is the data file on the external device, and what is its size?
2010-05-22T10:28:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	so an entire system's critical data is stored in a 32 byte file? ya think?
2010-05-22T10:34:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	in the future, use GPG for encryption. md5 is not the tool you want
2010-05-22T10:34:00.000Z	tolkad	mneptok	do you mean PGP?
2010-05-22T10:34:00.000Z	mneptok	tolkad	no, i mean GPG
