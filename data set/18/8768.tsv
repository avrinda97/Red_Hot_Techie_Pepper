2007-06-29T09:52:00.000Z	xlp		i have 3 hdd's, hd0 (sda) is winxp, hd1 (sdb) is backup, hd2 (sdc) is linux with multiple partitions (80gig as /, 4gig as swap, rest as ntfs/ext3/whatever). installed linux 3 times and grub keeps giving me error 17, now ubuntu wont let me completely format the linux drive as lost&found keeps appearing using 2gigs and i cant view the contents
2007-06-29T09:52:00.000Z	xlp		what i want is to be able to dual boot into windows xp and linux
2007-06-29T09:52:00.000Z	xlp		but i keep getting grub 17
2007-06-29T09:53:00.000Z	xlp		sata channel 2 = hd2 (linux), ch3 = winxp, ch4 = backup, bios is set to boot ch3 (winxp)
2007-06-29T09:53:00.000Z	xlp		grub is pointing to all the right places as well
2007-06-29T09:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	For the Lost and Found problem use sudo ( or "gksudo nautilus" to view it with the GUI )
2007-06-29T09:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	Yes
2007-06-29T09:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	gksudo just runs GUI programs as root
2007-06-29T09:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	How is the Lost and Found folder preventing you from unmounting the partition?
2007-06-29T09:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	If you get an error that a partition is mounted in gparted just right click it and choose umount
2007-06-29T10:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	gksudo is a command you use in a terminal to run GUI applications as root, in a terminal ( or run dialog ) type: gksudo <whatever>
2007-06-29T10:04:00.000Z	xlp	Jordan_U	so how would i get root access to that folder to delete it?
2007-06-29T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xlp	sudo rm -r /whatever/folder/you/want/to/delete or to do it from the file browser run: gksudo nautilus
