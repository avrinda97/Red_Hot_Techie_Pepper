2010-02-28T17:33:00.000Z	nexsja		'ello, i've had some trouble with wifi, so i decided to reboot, after rebooting the system wanted to do a disk check, so i let it
2010-02-28T17:33:00.000Z	nexsja		after the system booted up all my nvidia drivers were lost
2010-02-28T17:34:00.000Z	nexsja		i've downloaded 190 drivers from nvidia website, though i can't install them, says something about my gcc-4.4 version and that i don't have my kernel sources
2010-02-28T17:35:00.000Z	nexsja		thought that would be a good idea :/
2010-02-28T17:37:00.000Z	nexsja		does uname -a show my kernel version?
2010-02-28T17:38:00.000Z	nexsja		Package kernel-headers is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source
2010-02-28T17:39:00.000Z	viliny	nexsja	each and every kernel version has it's own header
2010-02-28T17:39:00.000Z	nexsja	viliny	so i've downloaded 2.6.32 kernel sources
2010-02-28T17:39:00.000Z	viliny	nexsja	what exactly does your uname -r return?
2010-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	nexsja	viliny	i've downloaded 2.6.32 kernel sources and extracting them now, then, when i'm installing new drivers i need to do --kernel-source-path <path_to_source>, right?
2010-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	viliny	nexsja	you can download deb packages too
2010-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	viliny	nexsja	http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2010-02-28T17:46:00.000Z	viliny	nexsja	easiest would be to use http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ to download a new kernel and the appropriate headers and update-grub to make your grub include the new installed kernel when you boot next time and then go ahead and install the nvidia drivers and just answer no when it complains about gcc compiler version and you're set :)
2010-02-28T17:47:00.000Z	nexsja	viliny	okay, so i need to download headers, image and source, right?
2010-02-28T17:50:00.000Z	nexsja	viliny	after i've downloaded headers, source and image (dpkg) i need to run them all and then run 'update-grub', did i get it right? :)
2010-02-28T17:50:00.000Z	viliny	nexsja	yes pretty much :)
2010-02-28T17:51:00.000Z	nexsja	viliny	does it matter in what order i install those packages? :)
2010-03-01T03:03:00.000Z	nexsja	viliny	hi, you still there? :>
