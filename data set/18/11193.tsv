2007-01-13T10:09:00.000Z	Robin		Actually, better yet, what is the equivelent of Environment variables in Ubuntu?
2007-01-13T10:09:00.000Z	Robin		It can't find that I have the Java Developement Kit installed.
2007-01-13T10:09:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	dpkg -l "*sun*" ?
2007-01-13T10:10:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	which package?
2007-01-13T10:10:00.000Z	Robin	egonw	I downloaded the binary from the sun website.
2007-01-13T10:10:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	better use: 1) the deb java-package
2007-01-13T10:11:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	please install the sun jdk deb from the ubuntu repos
2007-01-13T10:12:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	java5 is in the edgy repos, and java6 in the feisty repos
2007-01-13T10:12:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	the latter installs fine on edgy too, but be carefull not to upgrade to feisty itself
2007-01-13T10:15:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	the deb will set up /usr/bin/java to the right path etc...
2007-01-13T10:15:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	check: update-alternatives --config javac
2007-01-13T10:15:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	btw, you can set JAVA_HOME in your /home/$USER/.bashrc
2007-01-13T10:16:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	using the deb is also better for uninstalling etc
2007-01-13T10:16:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	and upgrading...
2007-01-13T10:17:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	moreover... in the past, the .bin from Sun now and then overwrote things it should not have...
2007-01-13T10:18:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	alternatively to adding it to your .bashrc, you can also prepend JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/jvm/java-bla to your command, e.g. handy when running ant:
2007-01-13T10:18:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	JAVA_HOME=bla ant
2007-01-13T10:22:00.000Z	egonw	Robin	ok, good luck! have to go now
