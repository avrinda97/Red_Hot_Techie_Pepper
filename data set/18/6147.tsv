2008-06-27T05:28:00.000Z	pgreptom		Hi   I bought a new 19" widescreen monitor.. trying to use 1680 x 1050, but the highest it'll let me go is 1440x990.  It's 1080i compatible.. and I can go higher on other OS's.  Any ideas on how to do this?  I'm guessing my only way is editing xorg?
2008-06-27T05:29:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	do you know which 19" it is?  most 19" are 1440x900 only
2008-06-27T05:29:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	I'm not sure.  When I play my PS3, it goes much much higher than 1440x900.. on Windows, it went to 1680x1050, and there was one option higher
2008-06-27T05:29:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	oh i see
2008-06-27T05:30:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	It's 1080i compatible.. so when I play my PS3, it goes nuts.. I think it's.. yeah, as spoonman said.. 1920x1080
2008-06-27T05:30:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	I'm not sure.  Let me start my PS3, and I'll tell you.  give me a second :)
2008-06-27T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	ya.  this is fine.  we just need to configure your ubuntu
2008-06-27T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	first, what video adapter are you using?
2008-06-27T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	have you installed the 'nvidia' proprietary driver for this card?
2008-06-27T05:32:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	Yes, it's installed.
2008-06-27T05:35:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	run "gksu nvidia-settings"
2008-06-27T05:36:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	 I'd settle for 1680x1050.  Nvidia-settings list 1440x900 as the highest
2008-06-27T05:37:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	ok.  i think the lcd is not giving nvidia-settings the resolutions, through EDID.  there are options to ignore edid.  look up UseEDID in the nvidia linux driver manual, but you'd have to make your own modelines in order to use 1680x1050.  this can be tricky
2008-06-27T05:38:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	Thanks for your help.  Sounds like more trouble than it's worth for something I don't even know if I'll like.
2008-06-27T05:38:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	i dont think 1680x1050 on a 19"w is too confortamble
2008-06-27T05:39:00.000Z	pgreptom	xtknight	I guess it's all what you're used to.  I run 1680x1050 on a computer at work.. it's a 20" widescreen, or maybe a 19" widescreen.  Not sure.
2008-06-27T05:39:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	probably a 20,21,or 22
2008-06-27T05:40:00.000Z	xtknight	pgreptom	yup.. or i could help you in offtopic (i have an lcd site)
