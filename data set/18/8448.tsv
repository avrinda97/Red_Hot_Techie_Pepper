2007-08-26T08:24:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz		can anyone help me with the ./configure and makeinstall thing?
2007-08-26T08:25:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	./configure sets up options. if it gives errors you'll need to download packages for the dependancies mentioned or something. make compiles. make install puts things where they should be ;)
2007-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz	Geek_	i know that so far, the only problem is installing it, cuz i have no idea how to do that
2007-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	have you untarred the tarball?
2007-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz	Geek_	i got this thing called Screenlets and its a tar.gz2 file
2007-08-26T08:27:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz	Geek_	 untarred a tarball?
2007-08-26T08:27:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	try running tar zxvf /path/to/file.tar.gz
2007-08-26T08:27:00.000Z	Geek_		that should extract it to a dir
2007-08-26T08:27:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	then ./config, and note what it complains about
2007-08-26T08:30:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	done?
2007-08-26T08:31:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz	Geek_	i have no ideo what tar zxvf /path/to/file.tar.gz
2007-08-26T08:31:00.000Z	Geek_		....
2007-08-26T08:31:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz		Here, wait up
2007-08-26T08:31:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	its a command. if you don't work that out you REALLY shouldn't be compiling things. also, do you have the build essential package installed?
2007-08-26T08:31:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz	Geek_	 /home/thomas/Desktop/screenlets-0.0.10.tar.bz2, thats the location
2007-08-26T08:32:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz		yes
2007-08-26T08:32:00.000Z	HazTheSpaz	Geek_	i have that
2007-08-26T08:32:00.000Z	Geek_	HazTheSpaz	so it should be tar (all those letters)  /home/thomas/Desktop/screenlets-0.0.10.tar.bz2
