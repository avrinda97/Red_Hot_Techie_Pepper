2010-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	cfedde		if you want some app from the remote to display on the local just be sure to use -X
2010-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	cfedde		easier to just to a remote X login.
2010-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	cfedde		imho
2010-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	cfedde		set up gdm to permit remote logins.
2010-10-18T09:56:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	cfedde	how?
2010-10-18T09:56:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	I need to research details.. give me a minute or two.
2010-10-18T09:56:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	cfedde	I see the option for remote stuff in GDM, but I've never actually encountered anyone using anything remote with GDM, heh
2010-10-18T09:57:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	it was the way we used to do things back when X11 "terminals" were popular.
2010-10-18T09:57:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	cfedde	I have used LTSP before, which was a very nice solution for computer labs, but that's only "remote" about 20 feet.  :p
2010-10-18T09:58:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	X11 over the net can be a pain. Though there are protocols for compressing it.
2010-10-18T10:01:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	jimisrvrox with most modern 1Gbit cards you don't even need a crossover.  They autodetect as part of the defualt protocol.
2010-10-18T10:03:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	re remote x11 consoles.  The details are in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
2010-10-18T10:03:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	the section in there you are looking for is the XDMCP part. And you want to enable it.
2010-10-18T10:03:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	that is on the server side.
2010-10-18T10:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	cfedde	I had heard about that, but not actually seen it in action.
2010-10-18T10:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	cfedde	in the GDM configuration in /etc/gdm/ ?
2010-10-18T10:05:00.000Z	cfedde	Samus_Aran	in the section about xdmcp
2010-10-18T10:05:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	cfedde	thanks, I will try that some time soonish  :)
