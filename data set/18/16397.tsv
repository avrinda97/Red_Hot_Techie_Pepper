2009-04-28T02:15:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	as you are using a binary only pos contact Nvidia about your problems :)
2009-04-28T02:15:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	its very unlikely you could get it working on any Linux as they all use the same pos binary only Nvidia driver
2009-04-28T02:17:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	also you claimed earlier to have modified an xfree.conf file which isn't even the right filename (not even years ago when XFree86 was the xserver)
2009-04-28T02:17:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	xorg.conf is the correct file to edit
2009-04-28T02:18:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	years ago (5+?) when XFree86 was still around it was called XF86Config
2009-04-28T02:18:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	not always when you use binary only crap
2009-04-28T02:18:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	the driver you are complaining about Nvidia themselves wrote
2009-04-28T02:19:00.000Z	calc	BSuntu	it has nothing to do with Ubuntu at all
