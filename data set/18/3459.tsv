2009-09-30T08:42:00.000Z	foey		opps, just used apt-get autoremove - It removed my Gnome install on Ubuntu server
2009-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	foey		Is there a IRC client for the terminal?
2009-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	foey		Thanks, ill try it now
2009-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	I second that vote for irssi
2009-09-30T08:53:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	are you using X?
2009-09-30T08:53:00.000Z	foey	KingNimrod	: No not using X
2009-09-30T08:56:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	think that irssi just takes its size from the terminal you run it in.
2009-09-30T08:57:00.000Z	foey	KingNimrod	: Yeh, I've used Ctrl+F1 to bring up the console. It's not too bad, just used SuSE with a higher res console before.
2009-09-30T09:00:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	I see what you mean - I'm used to a framebuffered console too
2009-09-30T09:01:00.000Z	foey	KingNimrod	: Hey, is there anyway to bring up my console session on F1 within a window within X? F7 is currently running Gnome
2009-09-30T09:02:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	hang on just looking something up...
2009-09-30T09:02:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrameBuffer
2009-09-30T09:03:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	looks like grub needs to be altered to use the frame buffer in the virtual ttys
2009-09-30T09:04:00.000Z	foey	KingNimrod	: Ahhh ok, will bookmark this and have a read through. Many thanks :-)
2009-09-30T09:04:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	to answer your other question, I don't believe it's possible to view vt1 from X
2009-09-30T09:04:00.000Z	foey	KingNimrod	: OK, no problems. Just would of been nice :-)
2009-09-30T09:05:00.000Z	KingNimrod	foey	you're welcome - I'll be reading it too. Didn't realise framebuffer wasn't the default until you mentioned it.
2009-09-30T09:07:00.000Z	foey	KingNimrod	: Yeh, I was using SuSE 11.1 the other day and the console was running a higher res, text was a lot smaller and smoother.
