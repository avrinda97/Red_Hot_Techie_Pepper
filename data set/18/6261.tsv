2008-11-09T07:35:00.000Z	dexter		is it advisable to use root account
2008-11-09T07:35:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	no
2008-11-09T07:37:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	because with power comes responsibility
2008-11-09T07:37:00.000Z	dexter	goat|lappy	ardchoille; so instead can i use a user account with administration rights??
2008-11-09T07:38:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	why?
2008-11-09T07:38:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	just be a user, and be happy.  when you cant do something because you don't have the power, use sudo
2008-11-09T07:39:00.000Z	dexter	goat|lappy	ardchoille; not using sudo....wen we create a user account...we can set the priviledges to administer the sysetm......wont this be necessary though i need to experiment on my kernel
2008-11-09T07:43:00.000Z	dexter	goat|lappy	ardchoille;  i m talking about a non-root account, i.e. a user account...just open users and group... and see the properties of any user account(non-root), there is a tab...called priviledges....in one of the options u get administer the system......so if i have 2 work with the kernel part and learn system administration...can i do that without checking this option
2008-11-09T07:44:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	you can do that without checking the option,  you can compile and modify the kernel with sudo, even when you are not in the administrator group
2008-11-09T07:45:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	yes,  responsible system administration includes knowing when to use your privileges
2008-11-09T07:47:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	when i first wanted to learn about he kernel, i read up on this:  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-linux-kernel/?S_TACT=105AGX59&S_CMP=GR&ca=dgr-btw01LKernalAnatomy
2008-11-09T07:48:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	but learning to modify it:  http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/how-to-customize-your-ubuntu-kernel/
2008-11-09T07:50:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	this could be of use:  http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/~dsw/public-files/kernel-docs/kernel-api/
2008-11-09T07:50:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	that shows kernel calls, and such,  google is your friend
2008-11-09T08:00:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	how about this,  its the last of my delicious links on the kernel: http://www.linuxhq.com/lkprogram.html
2008-11-09T08:00:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	other than that, i wish you luck
2008-11-09T08:31:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	ive got to go now though, so good luck with your education
2008-11-09T08:30:00.000Z	goat|lappy	dexter	^^
