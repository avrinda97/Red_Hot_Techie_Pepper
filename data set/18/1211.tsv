2011-04-27T09:05:00.000Z	Macer		do per directory permissions affect subdirs created within the dir?
2011-04-27T09:05:00.000Z	Macer		:)
2011-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	Macer		if they write something to the group directory
2011-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	Macer		ah ok. the umask has different settings on perms per number
2011-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	Macer		but thanks for the help. i will be able to figure it out.. but i was hoping to avoid having to constantly change permissions
2011-04-27T09:08:00.000Z	Macer		not too worried about executables
2011-04-27T09:08:00.000Z	Macer		more about protecting personal vs group files/dirs
2011-04-27T09:08:00.000Z	Macer		in a default manner where nobody can get things in the wrong place or read by others
2011-04-27T09:09:00.000Z	Macer		or accidently open up a group file to the entire system ;)
2011-04-27T09:09:00.000Z	Macer		by default
2011-04-27T09:09:00.000Z	Squall5668	Macer	you can set a parent folder to a certain mask and make sure anything in it is private, you don't need to change defaults and dont need to chmod all the time
2011-04-27T09:10:00.000Z	Macer	Squall5668	ah ok
2011-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	Macer	Squall5668	that is what i was trying to figure out ;)
2011-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	Macer	Squall5668	i will try that but i'm pretty sure that the files even in the new dir will take permissions from the umask
2011-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	Squall5668	Macer	ok, tell me what happend too :)
2011-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	Macer	Squall5668	you i think setfacl might do it :)
2011-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	Squall5668	Macer	still looking for it?
2011-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	Macer	Squall5668	yeah
