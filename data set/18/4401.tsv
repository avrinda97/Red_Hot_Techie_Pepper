2009-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	Let get a link...
2009-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	... did I miss your reply?
2009-09-20T07:18:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	http://www.google.com/search?q=logitech+controller&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a
2009-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	I hadn't replied yet :P
2009-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	wow! that was working in linux?
2009-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	frets on fire?
2009-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	 Yeah, I was playing some SNES games
2009-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	frets on fire?
2009-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	But that would probably work too :)
2009-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	did it work out of box first time?
2009-09-20T07:23:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	Yep... which makes me wonder why its not working now :(
2009-09-20T07:23:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	plus in to USB?
2009-09-20T07:23:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	check "lsusb" and see if it is listed.....
2009-09-20T07:27:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	Its showing up as "Logitech, Inc. Precision Gamepad"
2009-09-20T07:28:00.000Z	mdg_	RPG_Master	then it must be something in the game that made it stop working
2009-09-20T07:28:00.000Z	RPG_Master	mdg_	OK then, thanks :)  I'll start messing around with ZSNES's settings then
