2006-04-07T07:25:00.000Z	tanuki_		is it possible to use itunes under wine?
2006-04-07T07:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	If not, you can use something else instead; here...
2006-04-07T07:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	Wait a minute, I think that factoid is incorrect.  Google for SharpMusique and they have a Breezy .deb there.  I'll get on updating the bot.
2006-04-07T07:29:00.000Z	tanuki_	tonyyarusso	how do i install the deb package? im new.
2006-04-07T07:31:00.000Z	tanuki_	tonyyarusso	i enabled it but it still does not appear on the desktop
2006-04-07T07:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	Right-click and add a Launcher with sharpmusique as the command.
2006-04-07T07:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	I believe in gconf it's under Apps > Nautilus > something about show desktop trash
2006-04-07T07:38:00.000Z	tanuki_	tonyyarusso	thank you, that worked
2006-04-07T07:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	For the dpkg errors, try manually installing those dependencies (with apt-get, aptitude, or Synaptic), the try the dpkg -i again.
2006-04-07T07:38:00.000Z	tanuki_	tonyyarusso	what dependancies?
2006-04-07T07:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	Everything that it says "depends foo", "foo is not installed".
2006-04-07T07:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	You still stuck on getting the trash on the desktop?
2006-04-07T10:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	First, what program?
2006-04-07T10:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	No need.
2006-04-07T10:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	Enable multiverse and install acroread.
2006-04-07T10:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	Codename_V is also correct in that there are other apps.  Evince comes with Breezy by default.
2006-04-07T10:47:00.000Z	tanuki_	tonyyarusso	where do i find the evince app at?
2006-04-07T10:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	tanuki_	Still, I think gnomefreak is right; if not, you can run from a term.
