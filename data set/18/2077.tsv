2010-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	Stealth__		Thats the picture of my partitions
2010-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	use gparted instead
2010-09-26T22:45:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	don't even try to delete the files manually, you can seriously screw up your system that way
2010-09-26T22:45:00.000Z	Stealth__	MashPotato	I am planning on doing it from a live CD
2010-09-26T22:45:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	same thing, use gparted
2010-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	it allows you to format/delete them, so just use that option
2010-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	not as long as you don't touch the windows7 partition
2010-09-26T22:47:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	that is, sda1, sda2 and sda3
2010-09-26T22:47:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	yes
2010-09-26T22:47:00.000Z	Stealth__	MashPotato	last question, will i need 2gb of space to create swap?
2010-09-26T22:48:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	one gb will do, I guess
2010-09-26T22:49:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	in the worst case? you might be unable to boot windows, but if you have the recovery CDs/DVDs, you can easily recover the MBR with the recoveryshell of windows 7
2010-09-26T22:50:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	yes
2010-09-26T22:51:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	ubuntu will always ask you to install grub2, every time you install ubuntu, so that'll be fine
2010-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	yes, but the installer will take care of most things, just make sure that you __DONT__ erase the whole disk, because that obviously also remove windows7
2010-09-26T22:54:00.000Z	MashPotato	Stealth__	glad I could help
