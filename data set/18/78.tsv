2012-10-06T00:24:00.000Z	DanStamp		I'm having a nightmare here trying to get some via drivers installed on ubuntu.  The most recent version of ubuntu i can find with via support is 8.0.4 so I'm running that one.  So I'm on trying to compile the drivers for the machine, and its coming up "autoreconf: failed to run aclocal, no such file or directory".
2012-10-06T00:24:00.000Z	DanStamp		I've installed all the prerequesists as far as I can tell, and there is a aclocal but I assume its not in the place its looking?
2012-10-06T00:25:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	you have automake package installed?
2012-10-06T00:26:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	I have automake and autoconf installed aye.
2012-10-06T00:26:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	what does the "which aclocal" command return?
2012-10-06T00:27:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	As in just "which aclocal"? As that returns absolutely nothing.
2012-10-06T00:28:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	I do know there's an aclocal-1.10 in /usr/bin
2012-10-06T00:29:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	but I guess it might not be picking it up ros eomthing?
2012-10-06T00:29:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	maybe try making a symolic link named aclocal in /usr/local/bin (popinting to aclocal-1.10)
2012-10-06T00:33:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	That seems to have done something! ..let's see.
2012-10-06T00:34:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	Failed to run automake.  I guess same again then.
2012-10-06T00:34:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	are you getting the correct resolution on your via card?
2012-10-06T00:36:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	Not right now.  It's been an ongoing battle to get it working.  I'll link you to the post i made on the forums rather than spam up the chat with the story so far.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12277600#post12277600
2012-10-06T00:39:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	i would try forcing the vesa driver, should be good enough for standard resolutions, openchrome 2d acceleration with EXA is really experimental still and isn't even in the mainline kernel yet: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE0NTQ
2012-10-06T00:42:00.000Z	DanStamp	dlentz	I've actually tried the vesa driver in 10.04, using the same values for resolution and refresh rates that its previous users were using on the knoppix 2.4 via drivers, but that just left with a blank screen like most my other efforts
2012-10-06T00:45:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	i would try to get an xorg log from a failed X session where you tried to use vesa
2012-10-06T00:46:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	do you know what the res should be?
2012-10-06T00:50:00.000Z	dlentz	DanStamp	looks like it should be 1024x768 and ves should do that easy unless you're really limited on video RAM
