2012-05-27T03:58:00.000Z	jagginess	sinistrad	if i were you i'd take to see if i need special module parameters (like model= ) .. these go into the module options file, or can be tested on the fly with the modprobe command..
2012-05-27T03:59:00.000Z	jagginess	sinistrad	the option parameters are passed to the snd-hda-intel module
2012-05-27T03:59:00.000Z	sinistrad	jagginess	I created an .asoundrc file. I guess I'll need to relog to try if it works
2012-05-27T03:59:00.000Z	jagginess	sinistrad	may be related, you probably need something much simpler than what this post has..  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1191894.html

2012-05-27T04:01:00.000Z	sinistrad	jagginess	Hrm. I'll look into that. It seems helpful
2012-05-27T04:01:00.000Z	jagginess	sinistrad	echo "options snd-hda-intel model=hp-hdx" >> /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf

2012-05-27T04:02:00.000Z	jagginess	sinistrad	then simply reboot and see if sound works
2012-05-27T04:03:00.000Z	jagginess	sinistrad	btw you can pastebin that file if you want.. so i can take a look at it
2012-05-27T04:04:00.000Z	jagginess		(alsa-base.conf)
2012-05-27T04:05:00.000Z	sinistrad	jagginess	which file you want paste-binned?
2012-05-27T04:06:00.000Z	jagginess		, /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
