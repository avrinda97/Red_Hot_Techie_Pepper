2010-04-25T17:16:00.000Z	agronholm_		hi, is there any way to connect to a shared gnome session from a Windows box?
2010-04-25T17:16:00.000Z	agronholm_		I mean, I can connect via vnc but I'm not getting any display updates
2010-04-25T17:16:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	how do you mean display updates
2010-04-25T17:17:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	I have a still picture of the screen of how it was the moment I connected
2010-04-25T17:17:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	across what kind of network are you connecting
2010-04-25T17:17:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	LAN
2010-04-25T17:18:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	this repeats when you disconnect and reconnect?
2010-04-25T17:19:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	yup, I can control the remote machine but the screen isn't updating over vnc at all
2010-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	then i dont know :/
2010-04-25T17:20:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	I've never really gotten session sharing to work
2010-04-25T17:22:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	its worth a try, cant really think of why it wont update in the first place, aside from a sluggish connection
2010-04-25T17:22:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	a sluggish connection would mean slow updates
2010-04-25T17:22:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	yeh
2010-04-25T17:23:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	try a different viewer maybe?
2010-04-25T17:40:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	vncviewer perhaps?
2010-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	tried tightvnc and realvnc
2010-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	agronholm_	acicula	works with nouveau driver like I said
2010-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	acicula	agronholm_	yay for binary drivers :(
