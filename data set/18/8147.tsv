2008-06-16T16:40:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Right
2008-06-16T16:39:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	does ifconfig show ath0
2008-06-16T16:40:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Nope, it doesn't. Nor does iwconfig now
2008-06-16T16:40:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	is this a new development, ie did it show before
2008-06-16T16:41:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	since when eg what changed to lose it
2008-06-16T16:41:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	It seems to have gone away when I did that restart.
2008-06-16T16:41:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	what does lspci say about that card (one line)
2008-06-16T16:41:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Wireless isn't showing up in the Network Settings anymore either
2008-06-16T16:43:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	lspci spews a lot of info. SHould I grep for something specific?
2008-06-16T16:43:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	just the atheros number eg 5006 or 5007
2008-06-16T16:51:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	this is eeepc?
2008-06-16T16:51:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Yes
2008-06-21T12:20:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	BTW, I figured out what I did wrong a few nights ago: retrospectively obvious, but only after the fact.
2008-06-21T12:21:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	you sorted it out then?
2008-06-21T12:22:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Yeah. It turns out that when I ran the script the first time without a net connection, it set some things up anyway, which then got screwed up when I ran it again once connected and then yet again after a system update.
2008-06-21T12:22:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Completely blowing back to a fresh install, doing all updates, and *then* running the script worked.
2010-10-16T06:29:00.000Z	bazhang	jzitt	you might try #ubuntuone
2010-10-16T06:29:00.000Z	jzitt	bazhang	Heading over there. Thanks.
