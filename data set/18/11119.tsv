2008-01-31T21:56:00.000Z	NET||abuse		I have one more problem with my laptop,, I use nm-applet to connect to the wifi point in the house,, but untill 2 days ago it was on WEP, nm-applet had the configuration and wep key stored, then i updated the router to WPA-AES, now the old configuration still seems to be locked into nm-applet, and i can't see how you update the setup?
2008-01-31T21:56:00.000Z	NET||abuse		is there a profile manager or something that i can use with nm-applet?
2008-01-31T21:57:00.000Z	donald_	NET||abuse	remove the keyring for your WEP
2008-01-31T21:57:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	i did
2008-01-31T21:58:00.000Z	donald_	NET||abuse	then nm-applet should ask for the new key
2008-01-31T22:01:00.000Z	donald_	NET||abuse	maybe change the SSID of your home wifi ??
2008-01-31T22:01:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	nope,, the other 3 people in the house have their windows clients setup to use it now,, so would be a pain in the ass to go setting up again
2008-01-31T22:02:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	and i really would like to gain better control of the nm-applet profiles
2008-01-31T22:03:00.000Z	donald_	NET||abuse	i have changed my wifi from wep to open to wpa and have not had this problem. it will time out and ask for new keys
2008-01-31T22:04:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	it doesn't,, just flashes spinny connecting activty icon in the task tray, then cuts out back to disconnected look
2008-01-31T22:04:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	i get no prompt for the connection,, it's very annoying..
2008-01-31T22:04:00.000Z	donald_	NET||abuse	very odd
2008-01-31T22:04:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	if i click into nm-applet, select "Connect to other wireless network" and then setup the settings manually it works fine
2008-01-31T22:06:00.000Z	donald_	NET||abuse	out of ideas. i havent had issues with nm-applet
2008-01-31T22:06:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	:) cool,, well thanks for the ideas so far anyway ;)
2008-01-31T22:12:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	thanks for the help :)
2008-01-31T22:12:00.000Z	NET||abuse	donald_	killed the entries in the "default" keyring as well as "login" keyring,,, nm-applet worked now
