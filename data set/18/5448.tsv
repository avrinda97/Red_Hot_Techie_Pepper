2008-10-22T10:47:00.000Z	|sonic|		sorry for caps
2008-10-22T10:48:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	|sonic|	no sweat.  I think it's a wonderfully exciting way of installing Linux....
2008-10-22T10:48:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	|sonic|	anythign that makes it easier for someone to experience Linux as easily as possible is a good thing...
2008-10-22T10:49:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	|sonic|	almost no major performance hit... minor disk performance decrease... but other than that... you're using all of your hardware the way it was supposed to be...
2008-10-22T10:51:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	|sonic|	Ascorbic_Acid: its a fully native installation.. with the exception of the disk.  Instead of formatting or partitioning the hard drive.. you create a virtual disk that is merely a file located on your ntfs file system.  it's mounted as a disk and you don't even know the difference....
2008-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	|sonic|	Kr0ntab	can you help me dude ?
2008-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	|sonic|	sup bro
2008-10-22T11:52:00.000Z	|sonic|	Kr0ntab	well i think my external HDD shows errors
2008-10-22T11:53:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	|sonic|	okay... so with disk errors... you should try to focus on getting important data off... and replace the disk.
2008-10-22T11:55:00.000Z	|sonic|	Kr0ntab	, because i deleted Ubuntu manually i'm afriad of the boot now , not to get some problems loading , tough i'm not sure about disk errors. But couldn't load Ubuntu
