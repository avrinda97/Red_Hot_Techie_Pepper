2010-01-22T22:45:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		hi i am doing an update and i am asked about samba, it says keep the local version currently installed , etc etc
2010-01-22T22:45:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		install the package maintainers version means?
2010-01-22T22:45:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		ubuntus latest?
2010-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		i assume its  best to do  "install the package maintainers version"?
2010-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	dsearle	JoeSomebody	Unless you have edited the samba config manually
2010-01-22T22:47:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	dsearle	i have
2010-01-22T22:47:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		i'll have to copy it off
2010-01-22T22:48:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		where is that file again? :)
2010-01-22T22:48:00.000Z	dsearle	JoeSomebody	Well i would select the "keep current version"
2010-01-22T22:48:00.000Z	dsearle	JoeSomebody	I believe /etc/samba/smb.conf
2010-01-22T22:48:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		i am usually a latest version kind of guy
2010-01-22T22:50:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		so i have saved the bottom section, iirc that is the only part i need to write back?
2010-01-22T22:51:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		should i close all other programs like this one  while updating? (i usually do)
2010-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	dsearle	JoeSomebody	Would be a wise idea
2010-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		ok thanks
2010-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	dsearle	JoeSomebody	Usaully not much of a problem
2010-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		ok, later :0
2010-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	dsearle	JoeSomebody	but its "recomended" ;)
