2009-11-29T03:46:00.000Z	skinnYPuP	vermapratyush_	you'll need to add the path to the external drive into a grub option line. Then you can choose it at boot
2009-11-29T03:48:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	at the moment the grub is installed in my USB.. but i want it in my internal HDD..
2009-11-29T03:48:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	yes but it is inactive

2009-11-29T03:49:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	thanks
2009-11-29T03:50:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	one more thing .. how to i open the grub command prompt in grub2
2009-11-29T03:51:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	i do not get it by just typing "grb" in the terminal
2009-11-29T03:51:00.000Z	skinnYPuP	vermapratyush_	IDK anything about grub2 yet
2009-11-29T03:51:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	k
2009-11-29T03:53:00.000Z	skinnYPuP	vermapratyush_	I'd help ya out , but grub2 is on my list to learn about. I have heard of some cd iso's that will load usb drivers and boot o.s. on machines whose bios doesn't support usb boot. Maybe something can be learned from their methods. Does your pc not support boot usb ?
2009-11-29T03:54:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	it supports usb boot up
2009-11-29T03:56:00.000Z	skinnYPuP	vermapratyush_	is usb set to a higher boot priority in the bios than the internal hdd ? I have  done several  usb drive installs with no problem booting up.
2009-11-29T03:57:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	hmm.. lemme c try.. i think the external is on a higher priority than the interna;
2009-11-29T03:57:00.000Z	vermapratyush_	skinnYPuP	internal HDD
