2005-12-15T07:49:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		can't
2005-12-15T07:49:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		i don't know, but i can't do a normal install
2005-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		well, is there a way to get sound on server install?
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	install discover, it should auto-configure almost everything i think
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	yep
2005-12-15T07:52:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	you are running a server install, not a normal install right ?
2005-12-15T07:54:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	just installing it should do the trick, now you just have to turn up _all_ volumes, and sound should be working
2005-12-15T07:55:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	if you're using gnome, you'll also want to use esound (esd) as a sound interface. That means every app should be configured to use esd, not oss or alsa
2005-12-15T07:57:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	if you're using kde, you should either configure muse to use arts (the kde sound daemon), or configure arts (in kde) to release the "sound card" after 1 second if it's not being used.
2005-12-15T07:58:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	can't help you with the jack thing
2005-12-15T07:59:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	in the full-blown kde control center
2005-12-15T07:59:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	(i think)
2005-12-15T08:01:00.000Z	kyncani	MrBlowtatoes	well, you'll have to explore the gazillions of kde configuration menus by yourself :)
