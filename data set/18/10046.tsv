2008-08-29T01:24:00.000Z	Makzu		So does anybody know if Ubuntu has something similar to the 'world' file in Gentoo, like a list of all the packages I explicitly installed and not just their dependancies?  Like, a list that would contain abiword, but not libgtk or abiword-common?
2008-08-29T01:25:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	dpkg -l packageglob
2008-08-29T01:25:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	e.g. dpkg -l '*vim*'
2008-08-29T01:26:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	that doesn't work, I need a list of everything
2008-08-29T01:26:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	you can provide an empty glob.   dpkg -l
2008-08-29T01:27:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	well, not everything, just the things I have asked to install.  Not their dependancies
2008-08-29T01:27:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	and I don't care about libwhatever-3.9 when a package I actually care about needs it
2008-08-29T01:30:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	i don't know then sorry
2008-08-29T01:33:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	Thanks for your help anyway :/
2008-08-29T01:33:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	i'm sure there is a way, i just don't remember it
2008-08-29T01:35:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	I think the 'deborphan' command may be what I need here actually... I found it while googling around with some of the commands you gave me. :o
2008-08-29T01:35:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	be careful with deborphan
2008-08-29T01:40:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	are you wanting to remove all packages you didn't install manually/explicitly .. or just list them?
2008-08-29T01:40:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	I'm more looking for a list of everything I've installed explicitly, not to remove anything
2008-08-29T01:41:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	so that whenever I have to reinstall ubuntu I can also reinstall that entire list in one command
2008-08-29T01:41:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	then i dont think deborpan is the right tool
2008-08-29T01:42:00.000Z	Makzu	unop	but ""deborphan -a"" lists every package that doesn't have something else depending on it, which is close enough to what I want
2008-08-29T01:44:00.000Z	unop	Makzu	the way i see it -- if you create a diff between the packages installed on your setup now and that off a fresh install, you get the list of packages that need installing, does that not make sense?
