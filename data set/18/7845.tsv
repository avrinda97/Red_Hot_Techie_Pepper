2007-11-06T21:40:00.000Z	new2linx	arijus	well, if you run this command, "cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep multiverse", you should see the ones that say multiverse and they should NOT have a "#" in front of them.
2007-11-06T21:40:00.000Z	new2linx	arijus	yeah, that should do it.
2007-11-06T21:41:00.000Z	arijus	new2linx	my sources.list is already changed for multiverse
