2010-06-27T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		can that even work with openbox?
2010-06-27T14:07:00.000Z	foobazbar	Dr_Willis	thanks for the automated links, but they don't solve my problem.
2010-06-27T14:07:00.000Z	foobazbar		 is there a simple way to override the title for an auto-discovered boot entry?
2010-06-27T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I recall fluxbox habing some Autostart dir/file.. but no idea on lubuntu/lxde
2010-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	foobazbar	 theres some forum theres/links in there that mention editing the /etc/grub.d/ file. thats what you ahve to change.
2010-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	foobazbar	 be sure to make backups.
2010-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	foobazbar		as far as I can see, I'd have to remove os_prober altogether and replace it with multiple hard-coded entries.
2010-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	foobazbar	 also check out http://delicious.com/dr_willis/grub2  for my other links to grub2 info
2010-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	foobazbar		This seems a little heavy-handed to me.
2010-06-27T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	foobazbar	 or edit the file  and make it not show the info/comment out. or add some extra code.. yes.. it is a pain.
