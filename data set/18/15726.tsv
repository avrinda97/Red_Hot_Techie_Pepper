2005-04-06T14:26:00.000Z	pablo928		Seveas:is apt-get dist-upgrade usually a safe command?
2005-04-06T14:26:00.000Z	tritium	pablo928	mostly, but it can be dangerous depending on the status of packages in the repo
2005-04-06T14:28:00.000Z	tritium	pablo928	if you're not careful, you can inadvertently remove packages that you need
2005-04-06T14:29:00.000Z	tritium	pablo928	usually, yes
2005-05-19T13:10:00.000Z	tritium	pablo928	I'd give it at least a few weeks
2005-05-19T13:11:00.000Z	tritium	pablo928	sounds good.
2005-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	pablo928	tritium	are you a hoosier too?
2005-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	tritium	pablo928	only for a few more months, then it's back to New Mexico, where I'm from
