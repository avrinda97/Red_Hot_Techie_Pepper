2012-05-23T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	dontknow	please don't just say random words, ask a question wait for an answer
2012-05-23T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	dontknow	control your anger then, the attitude won't get you far
2012-06-21T16:27:00.000Z	ikonia	dontknow	so you use cpu, a fan kicks in, why is that a surprise
2012-06-21T16:28:00.000Z	dontknow	ikonia	is it normal in temperature increases like that, i didn't experience it in windows
2012-06-21T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	dontknow	when you use a cpu, it can get hotter, yes
2012-06-21T16:30:00.000Z	dontknow	ikonia	ubuntu uses high cpu for particular things then
2012-06-21T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	dontknow	no, if you use the cpu (launch a program) it may get hotter as it's in use
2012-06-21T16:31:00.000Z	dontknow	ikonia	why doesn't it get hotter when using windows?
2012-06-21T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	dontknow	I don't know
2012-06-21T16:32:00.000Z	dontknow	ikonia	it means ubuntu uses much more cpu
