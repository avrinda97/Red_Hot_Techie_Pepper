2005-05-31T12:02:00.000Z	brum		any nfs gurus around?
2005-05-31T12:02:00.000Z	zoro	brum	kinda - shoot
2005-05-31T12:09:00.000Z	zoro	brum	:/ that's strange
2005-05-31T12:09:00.000Z	zoro	brum	but i do know that for smb shares you need executable access to it
2005-05-31T12:12:00.000Z	zoro	brum	do check it out - i've had ALOT of trouble with samba in the past, and all of theem were to do with my conf files being a load of gay :)
2005-05-31T12:15:00.000Z	zoro	brum	shut up :p
2005-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	brum	zoro	i changed the share on the filer from NFS to CIFS w/ rwx access.. i can smbmount the drive and enter the dir, but cannot view the directory listing, or traverse any known sub-dirs... any ideas?
2005-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	zoro	brum	hmmm - interesting problem
2005-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	zoro	brum	sucks to be you! :p :D
2005-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	zoro	brum	i've never used CIFS, only NFS
2005-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	zoro	brum	is it possible that the parent directory of the share is readonly?
2005-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	zoro	brum	:/ no doubt it's a stupid f*cking problem :)
2005-05-31T12:28:00.000Z	zoro	brum	is the network cable connected? :p
2005-05-31T12:29:00.000Z	brum	zoro	nope...
2005-05-31T12:30:00.000Z	zoro	brum	nope what? :)
2005-05-31T12:30:00.000Z	zoro	brum	;) :D
2005-05-31T12:30:00.000Z	zoro	brum	well - if you can access it from windows, why not from lniux :/
2005-05-31T12:31:00.000Z	zoro	brum	were you able to access it from windows before the changes?
