2007-11-25T08:02:00.000Z	masmota		anyone got svideo out working?  i see the computer "booting up" on the tv, but when X kicks in, the television "flashes" but stays blank.
2007-11-25T08:02:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	what happens after running "xrandr --auto" ?
2007-11-25T08:03:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 dunno, gimme like 2 mins and i'll tell ya :)
2007-11-25T08:04:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 it didnt produce any output
2007-11-25T08:04:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 and no effect
2007-11-25T08:06:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 what should xrandr --auto do?
2007-11-25T08:06:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	it should try to enable all attached monitors
2007-11-25T08:13:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 any other suggestions?  im using an ati card if that helps
2007-11-25T08:14:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	ATI cards... multihead is only working on the older ones
2007-11-25T08:14:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	its a radeon8500... using the "ati" driver
2007-11-25T08:15:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	this wouldn't happen to be an old PowerBook or iBook?
2007-11-25T08:15:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 no this is a desktop machine i built
2007-11-25T08:16:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	that's odd, it really is supposed to work.
2007-11-25T08:17:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 well thats good, at least i know to keep trying
2007-11-25T08:17:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	does "xrandr" output descriptions of the monitor and the TV?
2007-11-25T08:17:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 all i tried was the --auto
2007-11-25T08:18:00.000Z	masmota	ephemient	 it just showed screen0 as vga
2007-11-25T08:24:00.000Z	ephemient	masmota	still around?
