2011-11-08T21:36:00.000Z	gp2mv3		hi, my trackpad isn't detected on my Dell XPS 15z, do you've a solution ?
2011-11-08T21:38:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	yeah, a server
2011-11-08T21:39:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	is that bad?
2011-11-08T21:39:00.000Z	gp2mv3	nkj	i'm not convincted by ubuntu server, i prefere debian or centOS on my servers but it's not bad ;)
2011-11-08T21:40:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	yes, I used to use both of those, but lately I find that ubuntu being used as a server isn't really so bad, and a lot of the depenency problems I used to run into aren't as frequent.
2011-11-08T21:41:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	this is a development server, so we need to be able to install new packages easily without dependency worries... but for single purpose servers I agree something like centos/debian with a locked down set of dependencies specific for the app makes a lot of sense.
2011-11-08T21:42:00.000Z	nkj		anyway - my problem is that, I did a dist-upgrade from 10.04 to 11.10 and now it seems udev and perl-base are having problems.
2011-11-08T21:42:00.000Z	gp2mv3	nkj	yes ubuntu on a prod server, it's a suicide though :D
2011-11-08T21:42:00.000Z	gp2mv3		but, who can help me with my not detected trackpad ?
2011-11-08T21:42:00.000Z	nkj		i managed to get apt and dpkg to stop complaining about them by downloading the .deb's and doing a --reinstall
2011-11-08T21:42:00.000Z	nkj		but when i run perlapps libperl segfaults.
2011-11-08T21:43:00.000Z	nkj		and udev creates some dmesg errors
2011-11-08T21:43:00.000Z	gp2mv3	nkj	did you z pkg-reconfig ?
2011-11-08T21:44:00.000Z	gp2mv3		*a dpkg-reconfig --all
2011-11-08T21:44:00.000Z	nkj		gop
2011-11-08T21:45:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	no, trying that out now.
2011-11-08T21:51:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	starts off fine, but at some point I get errors like: /bin/setupcon: 447: cannot open /dev/tty2: No such device
2011-11-08T21:51:00.000Z	nkj	gp2mv3	probably because udev isn't properly initializing the dev filesystem during boot
