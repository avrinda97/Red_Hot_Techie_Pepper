2006-10-27T08:07:00.000Z	riddlebox	adam_swe	time depends on your machine, but it really doesnt take that long
2006-10-27T08:07:00.000Z	adam_swe	riddlebox	how much is the download?
2006-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	riddlebox	adam_swe	are you downloading the iso or you going to use apt-get?
2006-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	adam_swe	riddlebox	i was thinking to apt-get it
2006-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	riddlebox	adam_swe	it takes a while to download then, and you will have to answer a few questions when it starts to upgrade
2006-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	riddlebox	adam_swe	I would just figure an hour to do it all on a decent connection
2006-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	adam_swe	riddlebox	700MB by apt-get? (i have a sucky connection)
2006-10-27T08:13:00.000Z	adam_swe	riddlebox	thx for the help but i g2g. bye! :)
