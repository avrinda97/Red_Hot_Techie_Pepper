2005-07-16T08:06:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	ah. i can try that.
2005-07-16T08:07:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	Actually, i can't.. it's most of an 80gb disk.
2005-07-16T08:07:00.000Z	phzi	crouton	you can save it gzipped, otherwise, I have no suggestions
2005-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	thanks for the ideas.
2005-07-16T08:09:00.000Z	phzi	crouton	hope it might help
2005-07-16T08:22:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	"dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=/dev/sda1/backup.file" look about right? Or should I pipe it to tar?
2005-07-16T08:52:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	today
2005-07-16T08:52:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	I didn't, but supposedly dumpe2fs can show information.
2005-07-16T08:53:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	Yeah, I'm tryin to find a filesystem to copy the file to.
2005-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	phzi	crouton	/sbin/fsck.ext3 -b <superblock backup location> /dev/sda1
2005-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	Yeah, I'm trying, all the backup superblocks are coming up with the same ' Illegal block number while checking ext3 journal for /' error.
2005-07-16T08:59:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	all the backup superblocks have the same error.
2005-07-16T09:58:00.000Z	crouton	phzi	hey, you still about?
