2006-09-11T16:02:00.000Z	djohnny79		can anybody tell me how to install dyndns on ubuntu? didn t find any suitable package in  the synaptic
2006-09-11T16:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	try ez-ipupdate
2006-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	ez-ipupdate is in universe - have you added repositories in system- admin - software properties ?
2006-09-11T16:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	no, go to System -Admin - Software Properties and enable all repositories first
2006-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	once you enable repos, you can find more or less everything in syanptic or add/remove programs
2006-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	BTW to complete nicks do for instance  thore <tab>
2006-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	make sure you update/reload
2006-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	djohnny79	thoreauputic	 Ah TAB is something great ;) i think il like it :P

2006-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	djohnny79	thoreauputic	 So back again, noiw with a valid domain, how can i setup ez-ipupdate?
2006-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	first register with dyndns.org, then run  sudo dpkg-reconfigure ez-ipupdate
2006-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	djohnny79	thoreauputic	r u gonna be here later? just noticed :I GOTTA GO :D
2006-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	if you are behind a router it won't work, BTW
2006-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	I assumed you knew what you were doing :)
2006-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	djohnny79	as Zorlac says, a lot of routers have the feature built in
