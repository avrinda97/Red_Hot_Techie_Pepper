2010-09-16T16:09:00.000Z	sadiq_		Tik ... is a process suposed to stay defunct after I try to kill the pid with sudo?
2010-09-16T16:11:00.000Z	sadiq_		so still...a reboot required...so much for sudo killing pids then :))
2010-09-16T16:11:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	What about "sudo killall transmission"?
2010-09-16T16:12:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	nothing on that sudo killall transmission
2010-09-16T16:13:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	Also try the following: "sudo killall -KILL transmission" and "sudo killall -SEGV transmission"
2010-09-16T16:13:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	nothing on those 2 commands :(
2010-09-16T16:15:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	Well, then... all you can do is either reboot or restart X: "sudo reboot" and "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" correspondently
2010-09-16T16:16:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	I'll reboot ....
2010-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	Should not.
2010-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	ok..ty
2010-09-16T16:54:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	Overall: find -type f /var/log -exec rm '{}' \;
2010-09-16T16:55:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	ahh...I was goin to gksu nautilus...but your command seems better :)
2010-09-16T16:56:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	 hmm... "find: paths must precede expression: /var/log"
2010-09-16T16:56:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	huh, uh... Sorry. find /var/log -type f -exec rm '{}' \;
2010-09-16T16:57:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	now it worked :)
2010-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	sounds like some wifi thing
2010-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	sadiq_	theadmin	it is..should I worry about them?
2010-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	theadmin	sadiq_	As for I never used wi-fi, I can't tell :D
