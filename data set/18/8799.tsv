2007-09-13T14:14:00.000Z	heartsblood		when I try to get modprobe to force the load of 'nvidia' I get FATAL: error running install command for nvidia
2007-09-13T14:14:00.000Z	heartsblood		hmm
2007-09-13T14:15:00.000Z	heartsblood		that's what I figured but I can't figure out why
2007-09-13T14:15:00.000Z	heartsblood		nvidia.com
2007-09-13T14:15:00.000Z	heartsblood		rev 100
2007-09-13T14:15:00.000Z	heartsblood		well for starters I dont like percompiled packages, I want to know how the damn thing ticks.  and second I NEVER had this much trouble with deb.
2007-09-13T14:16:00.000Z	heartsblood		><
2007-09-13T14:17:00.000Z	heartsblood		I understand it's not open source that's not what i'm trying to say
2007-09-13T14:17:00.000Z	heartsblood		I just want to be able to install a driver from the vender of my hardware.  I dont want to rely on the middle man.  no offense to those who maintain ubuntu.
2007-09-13T14:18:00.000Z	heartsblood		hmm
2007-09-13T14:18:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	and you can install one from nvidia or ati
2007-09-13T14:20:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	well it would have to be one suited for your system
2007-09-13T14:20:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	luckily the middleman was there for me so i did not need to ask synaptics for a touchpad driver or ibm for a hard drive driver
2007-09-13T14:21:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	want the version of the nvidia driver you grabbed from the site
2007-09-13T14:22:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	had you already installed the ubuntu provided nvidia driver?
2007-09-13T14:24:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	well luckily these things are programmed in such a way to provide helpful troubleshooting data
2007-09-13T14:36:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	best to build an ubuntu style deb then install it through apt
2007-09-13T14:39:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	heartsblood	you may just as well load the config you are using, then tweak from there
