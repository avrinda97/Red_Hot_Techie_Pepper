2006-03-28T10:05:00.000Z	zanth		i am trying to get an encrypted remote connection, tunneling vnc is an option I would like to avoid, I wanted to go with freenx but it won't install...apparently it is absent from the repositories and downloading from the site gives errors of nxagent refusing to install
2006-03-28T10:06:00.000Z	zanth		anyone have any suggestions?
2006-03-28T10:07:00.000Z	stepore	zanth	what repos do you have for freenx?
2006-03-28T10:09:00.000Z	zanth	stepore	I had the repository from this link: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=827499&postcount=44
2006-03-28T10:09:00.000Z	zanth	stepore	I also have everything available by default in ubuntu enabled
2006-03-28T10:09:00.000Z	stepore	zanth	what repose do you have. i'd rather not follow a forum
2006-03-28T10:11:00.000Z	stepore	zanth	try this one: deb http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl/ breezy-seveas freenx
2006-03-28T10:14:00.000Z	zanth	stepore	that doesn't seem to work
