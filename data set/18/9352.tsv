2007-06-29T12:58:00.000Z	piotr_		would be great if someone could me give me some hint how to improve the connection

2007-06-29T12:59:00.000Z	sldkfj		something like that
2007-06-29T13:00:00.000Z	sldkfj	piotr_	 here it is:  BCM43xx-fwcutter
2007-06-29T13:03:00.000Z	piotr_		sldkfj:that's what I used
2007-06-29T13:04:00.000Z	piotr_	sldkfj	thanks, I'll check it out
2007-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	sldkfj	piotr_	an y trouble use google with............ ubuntu feisty BCM43xx-fwcutter
2007-06-29T13:06:00.000Z	piotr_	sldkfj	ok, I'll try it out
2007-06-29T13:08:00.000Z	sldkfj	piotr_	there have been several that say their install was successful so it might come up when you reboot with no problem,
2007-06-29T13:08:00.000Z	piotr_	sldkfj	actually it's about problems to connect to access points. the wlan card does work
2007-06-29T13:09:00.000Z	piotr_	sldkfj	but often it tries to connect but it doesn't work to connect
2007-06-29T13:09:00.000Z	piotr_	sldkfj	it finds several access points so I don't know where to look for the problem. don't know too much about wlan so I don't know what to look for
2007-06-29T13:12:00.000Z	sldkfj	piotr_	crdlb is a guy here that I watched help another with the bdcm43xx  he might help you out if he's in.
2007-06-29T13:13:00.000Z	piotr_	sldkfj	ok thanks
