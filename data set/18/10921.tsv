2007-07-23T07:02:00.000Z	Zambezi		My Feistyserver kernelpaniced. It also did it with Dapper. How can I find the reason?
2007-07-23T07:03:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	more info pls.
2007-07-23T07:03:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	, It just froze. Couldn't SSH, couldn't ping, could FTP to it.
2007-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	any info on screen?
2007-07-23T07:05:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	No, just died. I remote it. It's basic installation with rtorrent and a non fully installation of VMWare. But I had the same setup with Dapper and also experienced the same problem.
2007-07-23T07:05:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	try with boot parameters: noapic noscsi
2007-07-23T07:06:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	I don't have a monitor to it.
2007-07-23T07:06:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	thats bad. you need to get one(or KVM console)
2007-07-23T07:07:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	serial-console is also possible
2007-07-23T07:08:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	I can connect a monitor, but I don't have space right now for it.
2007-07-23T07:08:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	what should I say
2007-07-23T07:08:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	I have more space next week.
2007-07-23T07:08:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	then fix it next week, hee
2007-07-23T07:09:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	If it's possible. I hate when it is like this. :-( I don't think there's problem with three versions. I think it's something with my computer.
2007-07-23T07:09:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	then download memtest86+
2007-07-23T07:14:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	It's installed, but it's not found in mem then tab.
2007-07-23T07:20:00.000Z	freemind	Zambezi	get "deep purple - child in time" while waiting ;)
2007-07-23T07:21:00.000Z	Zambezi	freemind	I'm running the test now. I might be my systemharddrive cause it's a relly old one.
