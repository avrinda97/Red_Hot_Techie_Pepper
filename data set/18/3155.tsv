2010-07-11T17:57:00.000Z	ACameron		I seem to be having troubles with my Ubuntu version.  I should be running 10.04, but menu.lst says "Ubuntu 7.10, kernel 2.6.32-23-generic" even after running update-grub. Also, when I try to reload package information, it's trying to find Packages.gz in main, universe, restricted, and multiverse, for gutsy (not lucid).
2010-07-11T17:58:00.000Z	ACameron		Opening "About Ubuntu" from the System menu informs me that I am "using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS".
2010-07-11T17:59:00.000Z	ACameron		Because it never prompted me to, and continued using grub1. So I did.
2010-07-11T17:59:00.000Z	MaRk-I	ACameron	edit 3rd party sources and change "gutsy" for "lucid"
2010-07-11T17:59:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	Is that in the "Other Software" tab of Software Sources?
2010-07-11T18:00:00.000Z	MaRk-I	ACameron	yes
2010-07-11T18:01:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	There are no third-party sources that say "gutsy" - they all say "lucid" or "lucid-security", etc.
2010-07-11T18:01:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	One of them said "stable", so I disabled it, but when reloading it's still looking for gutsy packages.
2010-07-11T18:02:00.000Z	MaRk-I	ACameron	look at those repos and if they say gutsy select them click "edit" and change gutsy for lucid
2010-07-11T18:02:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	Yes, I did that.  Every single checked repository did not say "gutsy".
2010-07-11T18:08:00.000Z	MaRk-I	ACameron	just to make sure, have your rebooted after the upgrade?
2010-07-11T18:08:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	I upgraded quite some time ago.  But I haven't rebooted since changing sources.list.  I'll try that now.
2010-07-11T18:08:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	ikonia: update-grub is still titling my ubuntu release as 7.10... anyway, rebooting; brb.
2010-07-11T18:11:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	ikonia: Update Manager still says my release is no longer supported, after rebooting.
2010-07-11T18:14:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	No, I upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04
2010-07-11T18:14:00.000Z	ACameron	MaRk-I	I don't remember exactly what my upgrade path was before 9.10.
2010-07-11T18:14:00.000Z	MaRk-I	ACameron	ok
2010-07-11T18:20:00.000Z	MaRk-I	ACameron	yw
