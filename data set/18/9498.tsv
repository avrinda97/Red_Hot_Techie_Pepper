2007-05-08T09:45:00.000Z	etzerd	Smilez	I heard about it
2007-05-08T09:46:00.000Z	etzerd	Smilez	Me too. I came from Opensuse 10.2 it's crap
2007-05-08T09:47:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	what don't you like about fedora, before you switch to ubuntu?
2007-05-08T09:48:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	codecs will always be somewhat of an issue
2007-05-08T09:49:00.000Z	etzerd	Smilez	what operating system that you use?
2007-05-08T09:50:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	i went from opensuse 10.2 -> ubuntu 7.04
2007-05-08T09:50:00.000Z	etzerd	Smilez	do you ever tried Fedora at all?
2007-05-08T09:51:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	I tried Fedora at school... on a test machine... that was about it
2007-05-08T09:52:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	I liked it, but not enough for my home PC
2007-05-08T09:53:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	KDE is slow imo.... i like Gnome
2007-05-08T09:53:00.000Z	etzerd	Smilez	what you mean by not enough for your home PC
2007-05-08T09:54:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	not sure really.... fedora just never really grabbed me... i guess im not a fan of redhat
2007-05-08T09:54:00.000Z	Smilez	etzerd	no problem
