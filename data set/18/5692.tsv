2008-10-21T15:31:00.000Z	balrog		i cannot get sound to come out of my laptop.  it sees my soundcard, and it could play music on the last boot, but evidently it decided to be tempramental and quit making sounds.
2008-10-21T15:31:00.000Z	balrog		oh, i forgot to ask a question.  anybody know how to get sound to _consistently_ work on an hp 2710p?
2008-10-21T15:31:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	does it play only or doesn't even play also
2008-10-21T15:32:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	thank you in advance.  some music players look like their loading the files (album artwork changes, etc), but the progress bar doesnt move.  some music players load and move the status bar, but nothing comes out.
2008-10-21T15:50:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	did you see the sound preferences?
2008-10-21T15:33:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	i have double checked that its not muted, but i could still be wrong because its very early in the morning here and i just finished writing a paper.
2008-10-21T15:33:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	please be sure.
2008-10-21T15:33:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	there is some ugly plugin
2008-10-21T15:34:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	holy crap.  skreemr makes noise.  wtf?  could the problem be flash?
2008-10-21T15:35:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	i dont know. which player you use?
2008-10-21T15:36:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	and now banshee thinks its playing away, but all i hear is the music from flash on skreemr.com...
2008-10-21T15:37:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	try playing form only one app
2008-10-21T15:38:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	i closed the skreemr tab, and restarted banshee.  its progress bar is not moving,  but it did load a song and try to play it (loaded album art too)
2008-10-21T15:39:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	or try playing with sound in preferences
2008-10-21T15:41:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	the ugly plugins for gstreamer are installed, and do you have any suggestions as to what particular preferences i should fiddle with?  the main volume, the microphone volume, etc?
2008-10-21T15:49:00.000Z	roxan	balrog	maybe you have used pulse and the daemon isn't up yeat
2008-10-21T15:50:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	yes
2008-10-21T15:57:00.000Z	balrog	roxan	thank you for showing me those, but none of those addressed my problem.  do you have anything else that i can try?
