2006-04-16T09:25:00.000Z	Howitzer		I would like to have an introduction to programming.
2006-04-16T09:25:00.000Z	Howitzer		What is the best language for this?
2006-04-16T09:26:00.000Z	Howitzer		It has to be moderately 'easy' and not cripple any future languages i might learn :D
2006-04-16T09:27:00.000Z	Howitzer		i tried doing some bash stuff
2006-04-16T09:27:00.000Z	Howitzer		like making little .sh scripts to backup folders, check if they're actually copied and then delete them :D
2006-04-16T09:27:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	bash is hell to start with
2006-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	you miss a white space and everything blows
2006-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	you're not confused until you reach pointers first time :)
2006-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	depdends on what you wanna do
2006-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	Howitzer	CosmoDad	i'm a bit interested in going for a programmer career later, that's why i want an introduction to it
2006-04-16T09:31:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	I'd start with Java if you wanted to know object-oriented programming...
2006-04-16T09:32:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	it's OO
2006-04-16T09:34:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	it's from MS :)
2006-04-16T09:38:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	C/C++ is probably quite useful, but also hard for a newbie (sic)
2006-04-16T09:38:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	pick your favorite opinion :)
2006-04-16T09:40:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	you should leave right now, people are getting weird :)
2006-04-16T09:42:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	I still need this GUI frontend for mplayer to convert mpg2 files to mpg4...
2006-04-16T09:43:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Howitzer	can't be too hard
