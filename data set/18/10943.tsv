2006-11-06T06:46:00.000Z	meathead		I was partitioning my windows ntfs partition in pmagic in dos and it froze, now it doesn't boot
2006-11-06T06:46:00.000Z	meathead		there is errors with the partition
2006-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	meathead		what application can I use to fix the partition
2006-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	his_dudnes	meathead	: i didnt see , i am not shure many can, i dont think this is the apropriate chanel..
2006-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	meathead		I'm not hosed
2006-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	meathead		there is no hosing
2006-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	meathead		I'm booted in ubuntu on cd
2006-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	meathead		there is no application to fix a corrupted ntfs partition in linux?
2006-11-06T06:49:00.000Z	meathead		I'm 99.9% sure there are about 101 applications that I could slap all on one boot disc and recover the partition with, most of which run on dos
2006-11-06T06:49:00.000Z	meathead		but you're telling me there isn't something equivalent to chkdsk in linux?
2006-11-06T06:49:00.000Z	his_dudnes	meathead	, i would try googling instead of irc for such a problem...
