2010-07-08T12:14:00.000Z	britta		Hello, I hope somebody can help me with this. I'm getting a little desperate. No wifi detected on my MSI U135 (RaLink RT 3090). It worked fine till an update on July 6th. ubuntu 10.04.
2010-07-08T12:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	Have you tried booting into a previous kernel?
2010-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	I'm not sure how to do that.
2010-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	Hold shift during boot and you will get a menu allowing to to select older kernels.
2010-07-08T12:17:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	thanks. Will try that and return.
2010-07-08T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	You're welcome.
2010-07-08T12:20:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	yess, I'm on wireless now... So how do I roll back the latest kernel - or is there another solution?
2010-07-08T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	First file a bug report stating that support stopped working with the kernel update. To file the bug report run "ubuntu-bug linux".
2010-07-08T12:22:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	a script fixed the non-support of ubuntu 10.04 already, so the fix needs a fix...
2010-07-08T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	What script? If you aren't using the built in drivers then you will probably need to recompile them each time there is a kernel upgrade.
2010-07-08T12:24:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	I'm just BP, a total non-geek...no compiling for me, I'm afraid. *sigh*.
2010-07-08T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	What script are you talking about.
2010-07-08T12:25:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	a Danish ubuntu guru sent it to me... would you like me to forward it to you so you can check it out?
2010-07-08T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	Yes.
2010-07-08T12:28:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	http://paste.ubuntu.com/460528/
2010-07-08T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	What happens when you run that script with the newest kernel?
2010-07-08T12:42:00.000Z	britta	Jordan_U	thanks for your help.
2010-07-08T12:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	britta	You're welcome.
