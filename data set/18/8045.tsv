2009-06-12T23:42:00.000Z	JuJuBee		how do I list all files/folders that start with a .  at command line?
2009-06-12T23:42:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	ls -ld .
2009-06-12T23:43:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	err, sorry, ls -ld .*  or ls -d .*
2009-06-12T23:56:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	thanks.  Now, how would I go about rm 'ing everything that started with a . in a users home dir?  I want to be certain before I do it.
2009-06-12T23:58:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	I believe "rm .[^.]*" should do it, add a -r to also remove directories.
2009-06-12T23:59:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	Yes, that would be safer. mv .[^.]* /some/other/dir
2009-06-13T00:01:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	 mv: cannot stat `.[^.]*': No such file or directory
2009-06-13T00:02:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	What shell are you using?
2009-06-13T00:02:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	bash
2009-06-13T00:03:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	The message means there are no hidden files or folders in the current directory
2009-06-13T00:03:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	Ok
2009-06-13T00:04:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	Does ls -d .* show anything other than . and .. ?
2009-07-11T18:48:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	Yeah, with the right DISPLAY variable; :0 is a good guess. DISPLAY=:0 command
2009-07-11T18:51:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	so wat is syntax to open say 'kate somefile.txt' on DISPLAY=:0 ?
2009-07-11T18:51:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	DISPLAY=:0 kate somefile.txt
2009-07-11T18:52:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	thanks
2009-07-11T18:52:00.000Z	JuJuBee	geirha	then the & to disconnect and let the app continue to run...
2009-07-11T18:52:00.000Z	geirha	JuJuBee	Yeah
