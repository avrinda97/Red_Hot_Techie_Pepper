2004-09-19T06:47:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	may be broken, file a bug and assign it to me please
2004-09-26T14:11:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	because today is our preview release
2004-09-26T14:11:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	and today's images are very close to what we'll be releasing as our first offering to the world
2004-09-26T14:38:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Kamion	so when are we expecting this new CD image?
2004-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Kamion	like partition resizing being 0% for the whole duration
2004-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	that depends on a number of factors
2004-10-17T06:05:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	like, for a start, the filesystem :)
2004-10-17T06:05:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	that's partman's fallback mode in certain cases
2004-10-17T06:06:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Kamion	ah, well I was resizing a 60 odd gb partition to 12gb, it was ext3
2005-01-04T15:37:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	debian-installer at first
2005-01-04T15:38:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Kamion	yeah, though when I upgrade the kernel, it resets it
2005-01-04T15:38:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	oh, *that* initrd
2005-01-04T15:38:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	initrd-tools
2005-01-04T15:38:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	I think that got fixed recently in hoary
2005-01-04T15:39:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	no, not that part
2005-01-04T15:41:00.000Z	Kamion	HrdwrBoB	http://bugs.debian.org/271038
2005-01-04T15:44:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Kamion	ah, excellent, and you can add it to /etc/mkinitrd/modules :)
