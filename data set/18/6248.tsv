2008-06-07T20:23:00.000Z	quantumelixir		Is getting a filesystem inconsistency during the routine drive chek a erious problem?
2008-06-07T20:25:00.000Z	quantumelixir		What is the best way to "manually fix" a broken filesystem as fsck asks me to?
2008-06-07T20:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis	quantumelixir	 i tend to boot a live cd and run 'fsck' on the filesystems
2008-06-07T20:25:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	Its happend a few times to you? file system inconsistencies?
2008-06-07T20:26:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	How serious is it really?
2008-06-07T20:26:00.000Z	dr_Willis	quantumelixir	 over the last 13 years..  a few times..    given the total disasters ive had under windows.. linux beats it 1000000%
2008-06-07T20:26:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	When does it happen exactly?
2008-06-07T20:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis	quantumelixir	 hard drives are the MOST unreliable part of a PC.  Stuff happens....
2008-06-07T20:28:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	how serious is a file system inconsistency?
2008-06-07T20:28:00.000Z	dr_Willis	quantumelixir	 i imagine it depends on how inconstant it is
2008-06-07T20:28:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	Mine says 0.3% of the files are non-contiguous
2008-06-07T20:29:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	That, and lot more blocks and sizes.. but thats all I can remember
2008-06-07T20:29:00.000Z	dr_Willis	quantumelixir	 that has nothing to do with inconstancyt
2008-06-07T20:29:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	Then?
2008-06-07T20:29:00.000Z	dr_Willis	quantumelixir	 boot live cd, run fsck on the unmounted filesystems to check them.. reboot
2008-06-07T20:30:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	What about this method that asks me to go to init 1 and then umount drives and do fsck?
2008-06-07T20:30:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	I dont think I have my livecd with me right now too
2008-06-07T20:31:00.000Z	quantumelixir	dr_Willis	When exactly does such a problem arise? What shouldnt I do from now on?
