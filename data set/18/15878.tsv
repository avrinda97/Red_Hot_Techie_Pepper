2005-06-22T13:46:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	ask
2005-06-22T13:46:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	don't piss off the people in #debian
2005-06-22T13:46:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	ok
2005-06-22T13:46:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	I asked already
2005-06-22T13:47:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	I just joined this channel to avert another flamewar in #debian
2005-06-22T13:47:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	thanks
2005-06-22T13:47:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	apt-cache search; aptitude search; apt-get install apt-file
2005-06-22T13:48:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	any real reason why the #ubuntu people can't answer this one?
2005-06-22T13:48:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	I have no idea
2005-06-22T13:48:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	but they aren't
2005-06-22T13:48:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	sorry, that last directed to the whole channel
2005-06-22T13:48:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	thanks for the info
2005-06-22T13:50:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	so what is the deal with #debian? I'm sure that answer applies in both distros.
2005-06-22T13:50:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	correct me if I'm mistaken
2005-06-22T13:56:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	yeah, this one does happen to be the same, but there are many others which aren't.
2005-06-22T13:57:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	Yes, I know.
2005-06-22T13:57:00.000Z	Guerin	uman	basically, it's a matter of opening floodgates.
2005-06-22T13:57:00.000Z	uman	Guerin	that's why I clearly said "this is the same between Debian and Ubuntu."
