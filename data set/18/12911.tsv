2006-04-21T15:02:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	care to share a little more detail?
2006-04-21T15:03:00.000Z	graveson	welshbyte	i am trying to import the totem player into firefox 1.5 but when the wizard appears ,the next button does not function
2006-04-21T15:04:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	um, "import the totem player"? what are you trying to do?
2006-04-21T15:05:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	ah then you just need to install the appropriate plugin for firefox
2006-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	and old bookmarks can be imported from the bookmarks manager
2006-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	graveson	welshbyte	i have tried all the plugins from the firefox and restricted format wiki pages but no luck :(
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	what kind of media are you trying to play? maybe there's no codec for it...?
2006-04-21T15:09:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	if you go to the page where the media is embedded you can hit Ctrl+i to get the page info dialog and then it'll be listed in the media tab as embedded media
2006-04-21T15:09:00.000Z	graveson	welshbyte	okay hang on -thnx
2006-04-21T15:13:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	make sure totem (or whatever program you have installed a firefox plugin for) can play mp3s and if it can't you'll probably need to install the appropriate codecs
2006-04-21T15:13:00.000Z	graveson	welshbyte	: ok let me verify that
2006-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	breezy, right?
2006-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	graveson	welshbyte	yes
2006-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	breezy does that
2006-04-22T07:27:00.000Z	graveson	welshbyte	any fix ,because my alt+f1 ..... is not working
2006-04-22T07:27:00.000Z	welshbyte	graveson	hm, no idea
