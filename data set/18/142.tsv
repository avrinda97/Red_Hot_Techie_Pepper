2012-08-06T18:39:00.000Z	dylan		sorry
2012-08-06T18:39:00.000Z	Jat421		it's like a schedule task in windows
2012-08-06T18:40:00.000Z	Jat421		do crontab -e
2012-08-06T18:40:00.000Z	Jat421		to edit the crontab file
2012-08-06T18:41:00.000Z	dylan		nano defkill
2012-08-06T18:41:00.000Z	dylan		whoops
2012-08-06T18:44:00.000Z	dylan		Jag421: I should have been a little more precise.  I'm writing a shell script, it needs to check if a process is running, and then if that process is running, search for a file.   If that file exists, it then needs to delete it.
2012-08-06T18:44:00.000Z	dylan		Jag421:then rinse and repeaat uintil that process is no longer running
2012-08-06T18:46:00.000Z	Jat421	dylan	yea that should be not hard to accomplish
