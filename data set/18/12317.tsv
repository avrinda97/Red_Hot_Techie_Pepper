2012-10-10T18:51:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	do you think i could fix it or is it not worth to try?
2012-10-10T18:51:00.000Z	MrElendig	nikos	ndiswrapper might work
2012-10-10T19:01:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	i read the link you sent me and i typed  "sudo ndisgtk' and i can see that neti2220 is already installed. why i havent wireless?
2012-10-10T19:01:00.000Z	MrElendig	nikos	what does iwconfig say?
2012-10-10T19:07:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1271303/ i have to say that now i can see a tick before wireless but i cannot scan wireless networks
2012-10-10T19:07:00.000Z	MrElendig	nikos	ip link wlan0 up && iwlist wlan0 scanning
2012-10-10T19:07:00.000Z	MrElendig	nikos	as root
2012-10-10T19:08:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	sudo ip link wlan0 up && iwlist wlan0 scanning?
2012-10-10T19:08:00.000Z	MrElendig	nikos	sudo -i then run the commands
2012-10-10T19:10:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	Command "wlan0" is unknown, try "ip link help".
2012-10-10T19:11:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	Command "wlan0" is unknown, try "ip link help".
2012-10-10T19:15:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	No scan results. WHY?
2012-10-10T19:17:00.000Z	nikos	MrElendig	i got: No scan results. why? any idea? why cannot scan. does it need any privileges maybe?
