2010-08-25T02:38:00.000Z	utkanos		is there a highly technical channel for ubuntu possibly with maintainers/developers?
2010-08-25T02:39:00.000Z	utkanos		i need to talk to someone who maintains the mkinitramfs package
2010-08-25T02:40:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	what build
2010-08-25T02:40:00.000Z	utkanos	ikonia	ubuntu 10.04
2010-08-25T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	working fine here - want to explain the issue ?
2010-08-25T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	when you drop back the shell, what happens to the process ID
2010-08-25T02:42:00.000Z	utkanos	ikonia	it stays in the process table indefinitely, forever, and goes nowhere
2010-08-25T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	can you truss that process ID ?
2010-08-25T02:43:00.000Z	utkanos	ikonia	this happens when i attempt to install a kernel via apt
2010-08-25T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	ok - so you're not trying to build an initrd, your installing a kernel
2010-08-25T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	what is the command you are using to run it manually
2010-08-25T02:46:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	is it with 1 kernel package, or everyone you've done
2010-08-25T02:46:00.000Z	utkanos	ikonia	this happens on EVERY package unless that update-initramfs parameter is seto to no
2010-08-25T02:46:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	so every kernel package you've installed has had this problem
2010-08-25T02:47:00.000Z	utkanos	ikonia	yes, unless i set that parameter to no
2010-08-25T02:47:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	ok - have you tried this on a clean install also, ( a re-install since)
2010-08-25T02:47:00.000Z	utkanos	ikonia	trying to not do that if I can
2010-08-25T02:48:00.000Z	ikonia	utkanos	ok, only asking as so many people are working fine, I wondered if you install may have an issue
