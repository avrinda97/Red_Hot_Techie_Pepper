2011-06-13T00:44:00.000Z	Short1		wondering if there is a different/better GUI distro for PPC than 10.10 Maverick Meerkat?  something else I could/should try?
2011-06-13T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	kde, lxde, xfce, kde
2011-06-13T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	did you MD5 test the ISO?
2011-06-13T00:30:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	i did not, but it is the Ubuntu_PowerPC_maverick from ubuntu.com
2011-06-13T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	doesn't matter where it's from. It can still be mangled in transit
2011-06-13T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	test the ISO so you know it's complete and consistent
2011-06-13T00:31:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	ahh okay
2011-06-13T00:32:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	would that affect the ability of the PPC to read it from USB and/or booting from USB?
2011-06-13T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	if the data is corrupt, it won't work correctly
2011-06-13T00:40:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	my DL did not pass md5!  re-downloading from cdimage.ubuntu.com
2011-06-13T00:40:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	thank you for the tip!
2011-06-13T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	np man, remember to MD5 test in future. Torrents help verify data
2011-06-13T00:42:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	I am using "hdiutil convert" to change the ISO to an IMG, and then dd if to make a bootable image on the Firewire per instructions on dl/server/dl from ubuntu.com
2011-06-13T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	md5 isn't linux specific ;)
2011-06-13T00:55:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	Is it possible to install vial Target Disk mode if I cannot get USB/FW to work?
2011-06-13T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Short1	not sure, not used it dude. If you have a floppy drive there is a floppy image to boot usb
2011-06-13T00:58:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	it's a Powerbook G4 12" =/
2011-06-13T02:14:00.000Z	Short1	ActionParsnip	got a working md5 checksum, still no love
