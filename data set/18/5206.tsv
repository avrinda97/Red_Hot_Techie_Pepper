2008-12-06T16:44:00.000Z	alkisg		Is there any way to access the run-program-dialog (Alt+F2) from the menus?
2008-12-06T16:45:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	I believe you can add it
2008-12-06T16:45:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	right click on Applications then edit menus
2008-12-06T16:48:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	thanks, but I didn't see it anywhere in there... I don't even know if the Alt+F2 dialog is an external application or if it is part of an already running app...
2008-12-06T16:48:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	yah I just looked, I thought it used to be there in hardy...you running ibex?
2008-12-06T16:49:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	yes, ibex. ardchoille: thanks, so I guess there isn't a menu...
2008-12-06T16:49:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	ahh...it's an applet....right click on the top panel and add to panel, it's in there
2008-12-06T16:58:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	here is the command like to add it to your menu " gnome-panel-control --run-dialog "
2008-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	thanks a lot. I'm writing a manual and I was looking for the menu equivelant to instruct the new users, but that's useful too.
2008-12-06T17:00:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	er...I just tested it and it didn't work...sigh
2008-12-06T17:00:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	ardchoille: and I think there isn't a gksu menu equivelant, right?
2008-12-06T17:06:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	from what I've read, it's part of the panel itself
2008-12-06T17:06:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	I'm trying to find what the panel applet calls..
2008-12-06T17:07:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	yah I ran the applet and looked at the processes, but I didn't seen anything specific to that applet
2008-12-06T17:07:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	maybe this applet itself is embedded...
2008-12-06T17:07:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	yah that's what I believe
2008-12-06T17:12:00.000Z	mrwes	alkisg	I think it's embedded into /usr/lib/gnome-panel
2008-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	alkisg	mrwes	thanks a lot... I think this is enough digging for today! :P :D
