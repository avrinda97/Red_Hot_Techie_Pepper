2009-01-15T02:15:00.000Z	mroc	Dre4m	in the settings for compiz, under general, you can change the number of desktops.
2009-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	Dre4m		I KNOW, its set to 1 . . and it wont let me change it
2009-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	Dre4m		stuck on 1
2009-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	mroc	Dre4m	compiz manager, general -> Desktop Size -> Horizontal Virtual Size
2009-01-15T02:17:00.000Z	Dre4m	mroc	 got you .  . . . but under that it says number of desktops . . .
2009-01-15T02:17:00.000Z	Dre4m		its set to 1 and i cant change it ...
2009-01-15T02:18:00.000Z	mroc	Dre4m	yes...i believe that setting will control the number of separate "cubes."  I could be mistaken about that though.
2009-01-15T02:18:00.000Z	mroc	Dre4m	but horizontal virutal size will change it from a cube to a hexagon to whatever...however many sides you'd like.
