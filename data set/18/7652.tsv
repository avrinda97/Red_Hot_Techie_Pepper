2008-09-02T18:14:00.000Z	Tyczek		Hi, I've problem. I installed mysql-server. I commented "bind adress- 127.0.0.1". Still nobody connect to server.
2008-09-02T18:15:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	what do you want to do?
2008-09-02T18:20:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	My friend wants to connect from other application. But it says.. host is not allowed to connect to msql server.
2008-09-02T18:20:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	from other app or from other host?
2008-09-02T18:21:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	and from other host.
2008-09-02T18:21:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	then make mysql listen on a public interface
2008-09-02T18:22:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	yes, i commented "bind-adress". It was told in guide.
2008-09-02T18:22:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	you're not supposed to comment it. you need to uncomment it and make it listen on the proper interface (usually 0.0.0.0)
2008-09-02T18:22:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	Hmm... Give me a minute.
2008-09-02T18:24:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	Nothing changed.
2008-09-02T18:24:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	what is your bind line?
2008-09-02T18:24:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	bind-address = 0.0.0.0
2008-09-02T18:24:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	Is it correct?
2008-09-02T18:25:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	sudo netstat -anp |grep 3306
2008-09-02T18:25:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	have you restarted mysql too?
2008-09-02T18:26:00.000Z	wols	Tyczek	so mysql listens and is working as intended
2008-09-02T18:27:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	Hm...
2008-09-02T18:32:00.000Z	Tyczek	wols	I just red, that I should put % in host column and restart mysql. But I don't know, how to do it.
