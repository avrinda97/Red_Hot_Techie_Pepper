2011-07-18T16:53:00.000Z	Reikoku		I just have a 4TB NAS device in RAID-5
2011-07-18T16:53:00.000Z	Reikoku		Moving 3TB over USB would be painful even with rsync
2011-07-18T16:54:00.000Z	Reikoku		I bought a cheap array off a datacentre that was shutting down, dr_willis
2011-07-18T16:56:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	there is no root login
2011-07-18T16:56:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	at least not by default
2011-07-18T16:57:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	Ahh, been a long time since I used Ubuntu :P
2011-07-18T16:57:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	logging into tty will help him exactly how?
2011-07-18T16:57:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	If he can log in at tty but not X, the issue isn't with login
2011-07-18T16:58:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	it most probably isn't
2011-07-18T16:58:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	Also if he can login at tty, it means he doesn't have to chroot in to fix the problem
2011-07-18T17:41:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	if you don't even use Linux, then be the heck quiet about different desktops :P
2011-07-18T17:42:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	I use different desktops :P
2011-07-18T17:43:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	It's a lot lighter than gnome/kde/unity :P
2011-07-18T17:44:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	You mean the whole OS booted in 5 secs or xfce did? :P
2011-07-18T17:45:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	the XFCE desktop
2011-07-18T18:02:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	press Esc when booting
2011-07-18T20:20:00.000Z	szal	Reikoku	will E17 ever come out of development state? ;)
2011-07-18T20:21:00.000Z	Reikoku	szal	I'm really not sure
