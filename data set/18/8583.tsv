2007-07-28T05:07:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9		sorry if someone tried to help me I got disconnected
2007-07-28T05:08:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9		It never worked.  I don't get to a login prompt my screen just stays black
2007-07-28T05:08:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9		Feisty on a homemade comp
2007-07-28T05:10:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	any error messages? try to pass the option "quiet" to the kernel in order to see the kenerl messages
2007-07-28T05:13:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	how does look like the entry for the normal boot in /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2007-07-28T05:15:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	the file /boot/grub/menu.lst controlls the list you see while booting (normal or recovery mode). it lists the options which will be passed to the kernel when you select the corresponding entry
2007-07-28T05:16:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	the options  (and I am assuming you mean everything after the root=UUID) are ro quiet splash for the regular bootup and ro single for recovery mode
2007-07-28T05:17:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	ok. remove quiet and splash from the normal boot line and reboot. this way you'll see the kernel messages and where it stops loading
2007-07-28T05:18:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	what does the single do?
2007-07-28T05:19:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	it puts you in "single user mode". the equivalent of "telinit 1". only the root user is allowed to log in. no graphics and no additional drivers
2007-07-28T05:20:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	that worked.  I was able to login.  Yay!!! You rule!
2007-07-28T05:21:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	hmm - i was prepared for debugging a problem. what happened? why are you able to log in now?
2007-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	I put back the quiet splash and waited 3 times the amount of time it took to start back up and didn't see anything onthe screen.  I then took off the quiet, same thing.  I am going to take off just the splash and see what that does
2007-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	go ahead
2007-07-28T05:30:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	The splash was the cause of my problem ubuntu can now load
2007-07-28T05:31:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	thanks for all the help.  But now I am just really curious why splash caused it to fail
2007-07-28T05:32:00.000Z	velko	LostAndConfused9	i'm happy that it now works. but have no idea why the splash gets in the way. i don't even use ubuntu
2007-07-28T05:32:00.000Z	LostAndConfused9	velko	well no matter what you rule.  thanks
