2008-08-21T04:58:00.000Z	seekingtruth		is there a windows version of Ubuntu installation?
2008-08-21T04:59:00.000Z	seekingtruth		wugu ior something?
2008-08-21T05:00:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	download the iso from www.ubuntulinux.com, insert the disc when windows is running and install it like any other application. it wont modify your boot sector.
2008-08-21T05:00:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	yes. you need the 'dm-crypt' package, then read the cryptsetup manual.
2008-08-21T05:01:00.000Z	seekingtruth	andax	how can I get wubi to use dm-crypt like the alternative install does?
2008-08-21T05:02:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	it's explained in the cryptsetup manual.
2008-08-21T05:05:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	keyloggers and screen capture trojans :)
2008-08-21T05:06:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	and network sniffers, and .. <stick whatever here>
2008-08-21T05:06:00.000Z	seekingtruth	andax	my bank websites never use the keybopard anyway!  i uses screen keyboard
2008-08-21T05:07:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	use wired ethernet connection, and do your banking from a live cd if you're paranoid.
2008-08-21T05:07:00.000Z	seekingtruth	andax	ill use virtualbox to run ubuntu.  Jack_Sparrow made me realise not to use Wubi
2008-08-21T05:08:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	virtualbox still won't protect you from sniffers/screen capture trojans and stuff like that
2008-08-21T05:09:00.000Z	seekingtruth	andax	how is a person infected with sniffers/screen capture trojans and stuff like that?
2008-08-21T05:09:00.000Z	seekingtruth	andax	how can I check if I have sniffers?
2008-08-21T05:09:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	i rather not discuss the details
2008-08-21T05:09:00.000Z	seekingtruth	andax	in other words, you dontr know. ok got it lol
2008-08-21T05:10:00.000Z	andax	seekingtruth	will you visit an url I give you?
