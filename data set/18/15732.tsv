2005-03-06T13:09:00.000Z	marcin_ant		hello - I got a question about user programs menu - applications:/// in nautilus doesn't work - is this broken in hoary?
2005-03-06T13:09:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	no longer in hoary :-((
2005-03-06T13:13:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	why it this broken or there is another solution?
2005-03-06T13:15:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	because menus follow the freedesktop policy, and there is not a GUI for changing them right now
2005-03-06T13:15:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	I guess someone is working to make that possible
2005-03-06T13:15:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	I really don't get it
2005-03-06T13:15:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	AFAIK davyd was working on this to enable menus editing in 2.10
2005-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	and now what?
2005-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	the SAME menus are now available through both gnome and KDE
2005-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	there will not be any way to edit menus in future in gnome?
2005-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	now you can wait or to see how to manually editing them :-(
2005-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	I don't know but I really expect so!
2005-03-06T13:17:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	I mean I expect they will be editable again
2005-03-06T13:17:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	I understand that developers want them to be compatible with freedesktop spec
2005-03-06T13:17:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	perhaps it is just a question of writting a new gnome_vfs plugin for the new menus or sth like that
2005-03-06T13:17:00.000Z	marcin_ant	prego	but for me it's yet another feature regression in gnome :(
2005-03-06T13:18:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	let's hope it is yet another transient feature regression
2005-03-06T13:18:00.000Z	prego	marcin_ant	perhaps you have to use KDE to edit the menus :-P
