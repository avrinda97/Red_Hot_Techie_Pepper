2009-07-04T01:41:00.000Z	jilbert		sorry im new to linux

2009-07-04T01:42:00.000Z	jilbert		okay. thanks..
2009-07-04T01:42:00.000Z	jilbert		let me check Halitech :)
2009-07-04T01:44:00.000Z	jilbert		oh one more thing.. just installed jaunty on 1 TB.. i made / 250 GB, 20GB swap/ and 750 GB /usr.. did i partitioned my disk right?
2009-07-04T01:45:00.000Z	jilbert		hmm..
2009-07-04T01:45:00.000Z	kane77	jilbert	you will have more than enough space.. 250 for / is quite a lot
2009-07-04T01:46:00.000Z	jilbert		i see.. oh well. that's okay i guess.. ill just resize that partition if i figure how to..
2009-07-04T01:46:00.000Z	kane77	jilbert	and swap should be 2x your ram.. if you have loads of ram it will never get used anyway :)
2009-07-04T01:46:00.000Z	jilbert		yes 20GB.. i think that's too big..
2009-07-04T01:47:00.000Z	jilbert	kane77	my bad. i shoul've made it that way
2009-07-04T01:47:00.000Z	jilbert		halitech: can i still edit my partitions?
2009-07-04T01:47:00.000Z	jilbert		without affecting my installation?
2009-07-04T01:47:00.000Z	kane77	jilbert	not that it's a problem, but it is wasting space
2009-07-04T01:48:00.000Z	kane77	jilbert	you should be able to shrink partitions and grow others either by using ubuntu livecd, or specialized gparted livecd
