2009-06-06T16:10:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	fortunately you dion need!
2009-06-06T16:10:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	you can install the Adblock Plus extension in Firefox
2009-06-06T16:18:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	do you use Skype or any download applications?
2009-06-06T16:18:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	and are you connecting your computer to the internet via a router or modem?
2009-06-06T16:23:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	I would then install a firewall. You can use install Gufw to help you configure it. Other than that you should be pretty safe if you follow the previous advice to only install software from the main repositories
2009-06-06T16:25:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	those are the main sources for software accessible by the program that installs the software for you. hihi
2009-06-06T16:25:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	click the Applications menu > Install software
2009-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	once itÅ› installed, open it and tell it to"Default deny"
2009-06-06T16:30:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	once you install gufw
2009-06-06T16:31:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	(the firewall)
2009-06-06T16:34:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	it will tell the firewall to refuse any unwanted connections (hackers or applications that are trying to do some connection without your explicit approva) to from your computer. Have a look here for additional info (the introduction is enough): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall
2009-06-06T16:35:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	enjoy. I need to go and create lunch
2009-06-06T16:36:00.000Z	chocobanana	roxanna	open it from the System > Administration menu
