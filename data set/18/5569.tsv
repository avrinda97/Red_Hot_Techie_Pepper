2008-09-25T22:05:00.000Z	lirui0073	snova	sorry i want to extract texlive
2008-09-25T21:49:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	the package is 'lzma', but i don't know what program specifically
2008-09-25T21:50:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	after you install it, run 'dpkg -L lzma | grep bin' and look for programs with 'un' in the name. that should do it.
2008-09-25T21:52:00.000Z	lirui0073	snova	thx
2008-09-25T22:05:00.000Z	lirui0073	snova	sorry i want to extract texlive.iso.lzma
2008-09-25T22:05:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	how big is it?
2008-09-25T22:06:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	ok, just checking. because iso files are usually cd images.
2008-09-25T22:06:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	run 'unlzma texlive.iso.lzma' to decompress it
2008-09-25T22:06:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	7zip is not lzma
2008-09-25T22:06:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	7zip uses lzma as it's primary compression algorithm, but it's not the same.
2008-09-25T22:07:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	you need to install the 'lzma' package if it isn't already.
2008-09-25T22:08:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	indian_munnda: sorry if i don't make sense, i'm getting confused by helping two people at once.
2008-09-25T22:09:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	to decompress .lzma files, you need the 'lzma' package, which contains 'unlzma' inside of it, the decompression program.
2008-09-25T22:12:00.000Z	lirui0073	snova	i check it,in SYNAPTIC already exist lzma package
2008-09-25T22:12:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	than run 'unlzma texlive.iso.lzma' to decompress the file
2008-09-25T22:13:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	chances are, this is a cd image. you need to mount it as if it were a normal cd drive to access the files in it (after decompression)
2008-09-25T22:14:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	create a directory to mount it on, via 'mkdir texlive'
2008-09-25T22:14:00.000Z	snova	lirui0073	then run 'sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 texlive.iso texlive' and you should be able to see the files in 'texlive'
