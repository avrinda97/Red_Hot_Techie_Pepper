2007-09-06T10:37:00.000Z	selinuxium		Hi All,   I have ghosted an IDE drive to a larger SATA drive. I have changed the hdaX's to sdaX's in fstab and grub. But on booting it says it cannot see /dev/sda6....  Any ideas
2007-09-06T10:38:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	does /dev/sda6 exist on the disk ?
2007-09-06T10:38:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	yes, it is the boot partitino
2007-09-06T10:38:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	doh!
2007-09-06T10:38:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	are you certain , have you booted from the livecd to check ?
2007-09-06T10:40:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	^^^
2007-09-06T10:40:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	so if you boot from a livecd you can see /dev/sda6 ?
2007-09-06T10:40:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	its not referencing the disk via uuid in menu.lst is it ?
2007-09-06T10:40:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	yes, i can mount it and see the contents...
2007-09-06T10:41:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	nope, i have editted there as well. And it is a standard path.
2007-09-06T10:42:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	something very wrong there then
2007-09-06T10:42:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	yep! :) I am glad I was heading down the right path though! :)
2007-09-06T10:43:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	is it grub that complains or the kernel booting
2007-09-06T10:44:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	when the kernel is booting, i see it do some acpi stuff then it waits for /dev/sda6/    then nothing and it dropsinto emergency console.
2007-09-06T10:44:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	ahhh, I bet your chipset drivers are still the old ones in /etc/modules.conf
2008-01-09T04:10:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	? I don't think that was aimed at me  :)
2008-01-09T04:10:00.000Z	ikonia	selinuxium	probably not, auto-complete is borking for me
2008-01-09T04:11:00.000Z	selinuxium	ikonia	np :)
