2012-06-19T10:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	you want to multi boot iso files?  grub can be setup to do that
2012-06-23T14:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	what part?
2012-06-23T14:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	sudo apt-get source $package
2012-06-23T14:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	why are you installing a tar file is the package you need not in the repository
2012-06-23T14:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	you should learn about the apt-get system of ubuntu as I assume you may not need to compile anything
2012-06-23T14:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	to compile things you need a set of development tools that you must not have installed
2012-06-23T14:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	and as you don't have an internet connection you will need to find a method to install offline
2012-06-23T14:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	by default the development and compilers are not present
2012-06-23T14:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	but what is this package you are trying to compile?
2012-06-23T14:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	I'm not sure what's on the dvd distrubution
2012-06-23T14:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	you do realize there is already leafpad in the ubuntu repository the is precompiled?
2012-06-23T14:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	you will need to install the package offline
2012-06-23T15:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	sounds like you should look at the program keryx that runs on multiplatform to gather needed deb packages to enable you to install offline https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware
2012-06-23T15:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	fuzzynurfhurter	oh ya if connecting to an wired net is an option you should have done that instead
