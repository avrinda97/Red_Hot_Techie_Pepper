2011-01-01T23:26:00.000Z	rs0832	skullboy	no i mean no updates in the repos
2011-01-01T23:27:00.000Z	rs0832	skullboy	but if you are sure there is one in the repos, you can download the .deb from packages.ubuntu.com and install
2011-01-01T23:29:00.000Z	skullboy	rs0832	no there ist but when i try to install the new ver from deb i get this "Breaks existing package 'libjpeg62-dev' dependency libjpeg62 (= 6b-16.1) "

2011-01-01T23:36:00.000Z	rs0832	skullboy	where did you get the deb from?
2011-01-01T23:39:00.000Z	skullboy	rs0832	http://packages.debian.org/sid/libjpeg62
2011-01-01T23:40:00.000Z	rs0832	skullboy	hmm then you may have to remove the older version and install the newer one... but ask on the channel if it will remove anything else because i am not sure if it will
