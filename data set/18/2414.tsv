2011-07-29T10:39:00.000Z	ap0th		hello all. anyone pretty knowledgeable with rdesktop?
2011-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	ap0th		trying to rdesktop from 10.4 to Vista and screen flashes then closes. no error on terminal.
2011-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	did you enable remote login?
2011-07-29T10:42:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-07-29T10:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	do you have a 3rd party firewall (not the Microsoft one)?
2011-07-29T10:43:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	no
2011-07-29T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	can you telnet to the socket ok? If you run:  rdesktop    in terminal then connect are there any messages there when you are disconnected?
2011-07-29T10:47:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	telnet to what socket? 3389?
2011-07-29T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	socket = ip + port
2011-07-29T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	telnet is great for testing services on servers
2011-07-29T10:50:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	I did try that...for example "telnet 172.16.0.17:3389" w/o luck - "Name or service not known" 3389 is RDP right?
2011-07-29T10:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	i believe so. You may want to read:  man telnet   to ensure your syntax is correct
2011-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	can other systems connect ok?
2011-07-29T10:53:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	no other systems
2011-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	I type "rdesktop 172.16.0.17" and then it acts like it is starting...I get the "autoselected keyboard" message and then right back to the terminal
2011-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	ok any interesting text in terminal.
2011-07-29T10:57:00.000Z	ap0th	ActionParsnip	nothing except the autoselected keyboard
2011-07-29T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ap0th	check event log in windows under system and security. May give clues too
