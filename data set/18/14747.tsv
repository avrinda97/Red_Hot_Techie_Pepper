2005-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Mez		IRIRC
2005-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Mez		#IIRC*
2005-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Mez		yeah
2005-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Mez		most people find 3Gb plenty
2005-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Mez		well
2005-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Mez		3gb fgor the file system is enough + some to play around with
2005-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Mez		my swap is 1Gb
2005-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	weezer	Mez	oh so a 4gb partition should be fine then
2005-06-18T08:14:00.000Z	weezer	Mez	cool thanks
2005-06-18T08:14:00.000Z	Mez	weezer	- hopefully - if you set up a swap and filesyetm in it
2005-06-18T08:14:00.000Z	weezer	Mez	I have 768 megs of ram and am not serving so not terribly concerned with the swap:)
2005-06-18T08:14:00.000Z	weezer	Mez	just make a 500meg one or something
2005-06-18T08:15:00.000Z	Mez	weezer	- It's RECCOMENDED that you ALWAYS have swap space AT LEAST DOUBLE your RAM
2005-06-18T08:16:00.000Z	weezer	Mez	too ture, but I am not hardcore linux yet so it should be enough for me for now:)
2005-06-18T08:16:00.000Z	weezer	Mez	think I will go do the install and see how it goes, thanks
