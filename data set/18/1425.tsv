2011-10-27T21:41:00.000Z	roasted_		Question - On Gnome Shell in 11.10 when I hit the wireless network icon in the upper right, some of the wifi networks show up as "UNKNOWN". Any idea why??
2011-10-27T21:41:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	Hidden ESSID?
2011-10-27T21:41:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	I don't think so. at work we have 3 SSIDs, and two showed up as unknown while the other I could read.
2011-10-27T21:42:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	Does the same thing happen when you "iwlist wlan0 scan"?
2011-10-27T21:42:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	I'm at a hospital now and I see like 4 networks. The one I'm connected to is an ATTWIFI hotspot, the others are unknown. So HERE I'm not sure... but at work we don't hide our SSIDs.
2011-10-27T21:42:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	I see a bunch of unknown entries, yes.
2011-10-27T21:42:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	being I'm in a hospital (and its packed) I wonder if its peoples laptops that have hotspot capability?
2011-10-27T21:42:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	wireless driver problems, that's all I can say
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	is "unknown" normally an indication of the ssid being hidden?
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	I think it is
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	well, I suppose that's possible but I find it hard to believe as it happened to TWO completely different model laptops.
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	11.10 32 bit on both with gnome shell.
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	Well, then a problem with wext
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	I wonder if I log out and into unity what would happen to nework manager
2011-10-27T21:43:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	perhaps thats worth checking out quick...
2011-10-27T21:44:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	you should probably try, yeah
2011-10-27T21:44:00.000Z	roasted_	theadmin	brb then..
2011-10-27T21:44:00.000Z	theadmin	roasted_	cu
