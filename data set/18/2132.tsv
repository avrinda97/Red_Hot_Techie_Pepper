2010-08-11T00:54:00.000Z	smilebar		so theres no easy way to get the "network mananger" into the top right panel with right-click on non excistant space?
2010-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	it's not an applet for the gnome panel.. it's an icon just like pidgin, skype or similar
2010-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	how do i put it there?
2010-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	open a terminal and run   "nm-applet&"
2010-08-11T00:55:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	so it stays there after the next reboot?
2010-08-11T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	it's usually started automatically
2010-08-11T00:56:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	nothing happens ...
2010-08-11T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	do you see any other icons up there?
2010-08-11T00:59:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	i see now : x-chat / USA / battery / speaker / mail-envelop / date-time/ speech bubble with a x / my name / and a turn-off button
2010-08-11T01:01:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	ok, try this.. find an empty spot on the panel (the grey bar), right click on it.. select "Add to panel", look in the list for "Notification Area". click on that and then click on the button marked "Add"
2010-08-11T01:02:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	sorry lol, theres not "empty space" all i can select if i right-click is "about" / "remove from panel" ...
2010-08-11T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	I meant, find somewhere on that grey bar where there aren't any icons.. I'm sure you can find some little corner that isn't occupied
2010-08-11T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	the left is fine.. you can move it to where you want it to be later
2010-08-11T01:04:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	okay i added "notification area" .. it adds three small horizontal lines
2010-08-11T01:05:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	ok.. that's probably because it won't get unless it's running when you start the applications.. now go to that terminal and run "pkill -9 nm-applet" and then "nm-applet &"
2010-08-11T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	see if it won't show up next to those 3 little lines
2010-08-11T01:07:00.000Z	smilebar	Slart	nope ... but thanks to aeon and xangua and alll for the help ... i'll just edit "networks" file in "/etc" nevermind > : D
2010-08-11T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	smilebar	well well.. you're welcome
