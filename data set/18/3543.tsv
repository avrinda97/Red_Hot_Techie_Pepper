2009-09-16T22:06:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	kill -9 sends singal for killing it
2009-09-16T22:06:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	be more clear about the type of signal you want to send
2009-09-16T22:06:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	sorry
2009-09-16T22:07:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	i want to send a signal like "pause" to a simple media software
2009-09-16T22:07:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	i know it is possible to pause/play media with that sending signals... but i just don't know send a signal different from kill
2009-09-16T22:07:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	are you coding it? or do you just want to pause?
2009-09-16T22:08:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	i just want to pause
2009-09-16T22:09:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	then use the pause button, read the man pages if the player is terminal only
2009-09-16T22:10:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	i read, but it doesn't specify anything like that. In the software chanel, people told me that is possible to control sending signals
2009-09-16T22:10:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	but i don't know how to send a signal to a process
2009-09-16T22:10:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	which player?
2009-09-16T22:11:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	gst-launch
2009-09-16T22:11:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	did you go through manpages??
2009-09-16T22:12:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	yes
2009-09-16T22:14:00.000Z	eddo	arvind_khadri	you know how to send a signal to any process?
2009-09-16T22:15:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	eddo	no
