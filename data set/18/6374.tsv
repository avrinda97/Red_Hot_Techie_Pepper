2008-06-04T23:39:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	i just removed ktorrent 2.2
2008-06-04T23:40:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	i couldn't find a place to update it so i want to install the newest version to my comp
2008-06-04T23:41:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	and add/remove only installs 2.2

2008-06-04T23:42:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	k take your time i'm jumping in the shower.
2008-06-04T23:42:00.000Z	Jalathan	brygee	i'll pm you than
2008-06-04T23:55:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	any luck?
2008-06-04T23:55:00.000Z	Jalathan	brygee	it's looking like 3.x will be KDE4 only
2008-06-04T23:56:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	aka not for ubuntu?
2008-06-04T23:57:00.000Z	Jalathan	brygee	KDE4 is in the repo's, and you could try installing & running "ktorrent-kde4" (sudo apt-get install ktorrent-kde4) under KDE3.  there might be another option though...
2008-06-04T23:58:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	i'm going to roll the dice
2008-06-04T23:59:00.000Z	Jalathan	brygee	ktorrent 3.x is currently being ported over to Win32, so i'm looking into seeing if it'll run under WINE
2008-06-05T00:00:00.000Z	Jalathan	brygee	i wish you good luck
2008-06-05T00:02:00.000Z	brygee	Jalathan	thank you for the good luck, would you recommend any torrent program
2008-06-05T00:04:00.000Z	Jalathan	brygee	ktorrent would be the best option that i've seen under the *nix area.  If you are running WINE, than utorrent is also an option.
