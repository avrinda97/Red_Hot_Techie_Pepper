2008-09-27T19:54:00.000Z	maniheer		doesn't anyone know wat /scripts/casper is?????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2008-09-27T19:54:00.000Z	maniheer		its wat it says when i'm booting
2008-09-27T19:55:00.000Z	maniheer		kernel panic
2008-09-27T19:55:00.000Z	maniheer		wat
2008-09-27T19:55:00.000Z	maniheer		is it?
2008-09-27T19:57:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	what does the kernel panic or other errors say *exactly*?
2008-09-27T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	and what guide are you following to make your own CD?
2008-09-27T20:05:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	well, is the file /scripts/casper there or not?
2008-09-28T19:22:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	google tells me there's a .vdi that's a CD image format for some proprietary burning program, and another .vdi that's an image for VirtualBox
2008-09-28T19:23:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	in that case, the obvious answer would be "use vbox"... :P
2008-09-28T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	but *is* it a CD to begin with? as far as i can tell, .vdi can very well (and perhaps *only*) be a hard drive image
2008-09-28T19:24:00.000Z	maniheer	LjL	inside the .vdi file is a .iso file
2008-09-28T19:25:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	i see that there is a "vditool" command (anyway, perhaps you could transfer that .iso from inside virtualbox to the host machine?)
2008-10-01T20:41:00.000Z	maniheer	LjL	how do I do that?
2008-10-01T20:41:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	what?
2008-10-01T20:42:00.000Z	maniheer	LjL	get +o and kick someone
2008-10-01T20:42:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	you don't
2008-10-04T18:13:00.000Z	LjL	maniheer	that spam is not appreciated
