2008-01-20T03:15:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	how'd you do that perl fix?
2008-01-20T03:15:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	killall processes? kill init, but then your machine will stop working :)
2008-01-20T03:16:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	you can look thru /etc/rc2.d and check for stuff that you don't need, but be sure you don't need it.
2008-01-20T03:25:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	you can disable it in system->prefs->startup first tab
2008-01-20T03:34:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	no, you can disable it in the sessions dialog
2008-01-20T03:35:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	system->prefs->sessins
2008-01-20T03:45:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	nautilus is your file browser, you want that
2008-01-20T03:46:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	if you're not using evolution, no
2008-01-20T03:46:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	do you have bluetooth?
2008-01-20T03:53:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	that's your window border drawer, and it allows you to move windows around the screen. Essential
2008-01-20T03:53:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	ah, so ubuntu's not a toy :)
2008-01-26T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	install zlib1g-dev
2008-01-26T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	apt-cache policy zlig1g-dev , what does it say about candidate?
2008-01-26T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	erm, that was apt-cache policy zlib1g-dev , not zlig1g-dev :)
2008-01-26T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud_	adub	that's an error in the stuff you're compiling itself ...
