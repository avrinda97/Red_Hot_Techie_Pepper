2011-02-09T13:46:00.000Z	its-me-again		i i am trying to set up file sharing using this http://senk9.wordpress.com/2010/09/26/how-to-stream-media-onto-your-android-device-easily-from-anywhere/  the 2 ip address i get from ifconfig and http://www.whatismyip.com dont work
2011-02-09T13:46:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	are you file sharing on a local network?
2011-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	its-me-again	brez	yes using the tutorial from ^ i mentioned
2011-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	ifconfig would show internal / whatismyip.com would show external.
2011-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	its-me-again	brez	if you read what i said ^ both do not work
2011-02-09T13:48:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	you could be getting the wrong IP from ifconig.
2011-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	he was helping you.. if both IP's aren't working, you're obviously doing something wrong.. so he was obviously covering the steps.
2011-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	pastebin your ifconfig -a, and someone will tell you the 'correct' one to use.
2011-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	its-me-again	brez	yes i did that the oip address from ifconfig wlan0 is not working
2011-02-09T13:57:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	can you ping your android devices internal IP (if on WiFi network?)
2011-02-09T13:57:00.000Z	its-me-again	brez	android dont hav a terminal i dont know how
2011-02-09T13:58:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	ping it from your linux box?
2011-02-09T13:58:00.000Z	its-me-again	brez	ok how then
2011-02-09T13:59:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	do you know the internal IP? if not.. you can probably get it from your router. Then in a terminal type "ping I.P.Address"
2011-02-09T14:00:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	grab it from the router
2011-02-09T14:00:00.000Z	its-me-again	brez	ok how can i get it from that idk about this
2011-02-09T14:02:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	try looking in the "about this phone" settings in adroid.. it may tell you.
2011-02-09T14:04:00.000Z	brez	its-me-again	Settings >> Wireless Controls >> Wi-Fi Settings, it's at the bottom under "WiFi settings"
