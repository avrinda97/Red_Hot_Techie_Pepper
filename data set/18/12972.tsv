2006-07-02T09:28:00.000Z	byen		sorry Frogzoo very frustated

2006-07-02T09:29:00.000Z	byen		logically it shud. But i dont see it
2006-07-02T09:29:00.000Z	byen		on Breezy it used to be on sda1
2006-07-02T09:30:00.000Z	byen		but on dapper it does not show up anywhere
2006-07-02T09:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	byen	tail -f /var/log/messages   - then plug it in & see what log is spat out
2006-07-02T09:33:00.000Z	byen	Frogzoo	i get Jul  2 11:33:11 localhost kernel: [17184983.864000]  usb 4-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 19
2006-07-02T09:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	byen	& that's all she wrote?
2006-07-02T09:34:00.000Z	byen	Frogzoo	^
2006-07-02T09:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	byen	in a perfect world, you'd get something like "Initializing USB Mass Storage driver..."
2006-07-02T09:38:00.000Z	byen	Frogzoo	so is there anything i can do
2006-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	byen	that's it? just the one line & nothing more?
2006-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	byen	Frogzoo	Jul  2 11:40:28 localhost kernel: [17185421.336000]  usb 4-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 123
2006-07-02T09:43:00.000Z	byen	Frogzoo	does that mean I am screwed.. or that there is still an option? what gets me is.. it used awesome on Breezy
2006-07-02T09:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	byen	not screwed, just delayed
2006-07-02T09:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	byen	google is your friend - what's the drive make/model?
