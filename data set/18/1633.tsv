2011-01-04T00:13:00.000Z	kenny_duehit		anyone know why ubuntu insists on changing what drives are assigned to sda, sdb, etc? it changes them almost everytime I boot
2011-01-04T00:15:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	how id you assigned them?
2011-01-04T00:21:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	what do you mean how did I assign them?
2011-01-04T00:21:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	well, i didn't quite understand what is your problem?
2011-01-04T00:21:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	you mean that disk that is used in / is next time mounted somewhere else?
2011-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	or what?
2011-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	yes.  1 boot, sda is for my 20gb drive. next boot sda links to me 500gb drive
2011-01-04T00:23:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	I would like to force consistency
2011-01-04T00:23:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	can you upload your /etc/fstab to pastebin.ubuntu.com
2011-01-04T00:24:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	ok, give me a second
2011-01-04T00:26:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/549956/
2011-01-04T00:27:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	and what about sudo blkid
2011-01-04T00:28:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/549957/
2011-01-04T00:29:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	aah, so those are external disks. you can mount them using uuid's still
2011-01-04T00:30:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	I know I can mount using uuid's, but is there a way to force a uuid to be assiciated with a specific dev?
2011-01-04T00:31:00.000Z	gobbe	kenny_duehit	uuid is consistent
2011-01-04T00:32:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	right, any hacks to force dev's to specific uuid's?
2011-01-04T00:32:00.000Z	kenny_duehit	gobbe	no is an acceptable response.....
