2009-06-20T06:09:00.000Z	comptroller		Hi - i have a question with subversion i am using on ubuntu
2009-06-20T06:10:00.000Z	comptroller		I am a newb - My question with subversion is that i can connect to a server and checkout files okay, and i can commit files okay; on the server side, the files show up as different versions when i do svn list --verbose; however, when i look at the files themselves on the server, they aren't changed
2009-06-20T06:11:00.000Z	comptroller		Where are the committed svn files?
2009-06-20T06:11:00.000Z	MatthiasM	comptroller	server / repo
2009-06-20T06:11:00.000Z	MatthiasM		yes
2009-06-20T06:12:00.000Z	comptroller	MatthiasM	okay, so if my repo was /home/svn/foo , and i imported /path/myproject into /home/svn/foo/myproject
2009-06-20T06:13:00.000Z	comptroller		then shouldn't i be able to see them in /home/svn/foo/myproject?
2009-06-20T06:13:00.000Z	MatthiasM	comptroller	not directly
2009-06-20T06:13:00.000Z	comptroller		I mean, should the /path/myproject that i imported - should these files be changing?
2009-06-20T06:14:00.000Z	comptroller		or rather, do i have to check out the whole project on the server that the code resides?
2009-06-20T06:14:00.000Z	MatthiasM	comptroller	you should read the getting started of svn
2009-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	comptroller	MatthiasM	I did read a bunch - I guess i'm just confused what happens when you 'import' a directory; i thought it just basically creates links to this directory, which serves as the main project that gets updated
2009-06-20T06:16:00.000Z	comptroller	MatthiasM	shouldn't i be seeing commited changes to the original directory that I imported?
2009-06-20T06:17:00.000Z	MatthiasM	comptroller	you have a repo, a working folder, and maybe other things
2009-06-20T06:17:00.000Z	MatthiasM		only the repo and the working folder gets changed by svn
2009-06-20T06:17:00.000Z	comptroller	MatthiasM	oh okay, so the original folder i imported doens't matter
2009-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	comptroller	MatthiasM	so could i delete the original folder i imported, and the repo will be fine?
2009-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	MatthiasM	comptroller	I'm not 100% sure, because I normaly add files which are already in the working folder
