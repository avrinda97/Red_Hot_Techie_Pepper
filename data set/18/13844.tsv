2007-02-26T11:27:00.000Z	eck		all of the major software for math is linux-centric
2007-02-26T11:27:00.000Z	eck		especially LaTeX and certain math packages
2007-02-26T11:28:00.000Z	eck		linux also offers a lot of scriptability and extensibility that is not possible in windows
2007-02-26T11:28:00.000Z	eck		i guess it depends
2007-02-26T11:29:00.000Z	eck		not very much, not very easily
2007-02-26T11:29:00.000Z	eck		whenever i have to use windows (e.g. at work) i always have to install cygwin
2007-02-26T11:29:00.000Z	eck		because I work in a very linux-oriented way
2007-02-26T11:30:00.000Z	eck		windows has no cli to speak of, dammit
2007-02-26T11:30:00.000Z	eck		!pastebin
2007-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	eck		or alternately /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	eck	Mach4, ubuntu doesn't use grub.conf, it uses menu.lst
2007-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	eck	Flannel	damn, you are right
2007-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	Flannel	eck	the only issue with SVN for normal data like that is that it'll end up taking twice as much space
2007-03-16T15:51:00.000Z	Flannel	eck	r4nge, if anything depends on it, it'll get reinstalled once you oinstall the thing that depends on it
2007-03-16T15:51:00.000Z	eck	Flannel	if it is part of LSB it could be the case that some other package actually uses it but the package maintainers didn't put it as a depends, which is what i would worry about
2007-03-16T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	eck	shrug.  I see no real reason to remove it either, it's what, a couple of Kb?
2007-03-18T08:17:00.000Z	eck	Flannel	do you know how many processors the desktop kernel can do?
2007-05-04T09:39:00.000Z	Flannel	eck	vbabiy, no.  ~yourusername is wrong.  Either, /home/username/ or ~
