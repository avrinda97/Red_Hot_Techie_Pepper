2005-10-03T11:26:00.000Z	bitblit		k so if I install ubuntu 5.10 preview, can I upgrade in place when it is released?
2005-10-03T11:27:00.000Z	bitblit		I'm trying to decide if I should switch from Gentoo to Ubuntu. I'm totally new to linux, and have Gentoo limping along. I'm tired of mapping mouse buttons and compiling sound drivers in my kernel :)
2005-10-03T11:27:00.000Z	bitblit		i take it ubuntu works out of the box more?
2005-10-03T11:29:00.000Z	bitblit		what is Colony 5?
2005-10-03T11:29:00.000Z	bitblit		looks like a different version of 510 that i'm downloading
2005-10-03T11:30:00.000Z	bitblit		says ubuntu-5.10-preview-install-i386.iso
2005-10-03T11:30:00.000Z	bitblit		not sure what breezy is
2005-10-03T11:31:00.000Z	Travis|H	bitblit	breezy is not officially out yet .. the current stable release is called Hoary Hedgehog
2005-10-03T11:31:00.000Z	Travis|H		Breezy Badger is slated to come out some time in October .. but there was a Preview Release (release candidate basically) that came out earlier this month
2005-10-03T11:32:00.000Z	Travis|H		and the latest test version (and likely last to be compiled before the final version is out) is Colony 5
2005-10-03T11:32:00.000Z	bitblit	Travis|H	so what should i get for a new install?
2005-10-03T11:32:00.000Z	Travis|H	bitblit	well ... for guaranteed stability and compatibility with the unofficial ubuntu starter guide ... 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog)
2005-10-03T11:33:00.000Z	bitblit		I'm confused because i have two pages up, both for Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger), one says Preview, one says Colony CD 5
2005-10-03T11:33:00.000Z	Travis|H	bitblit	well if you are going to install Breezy, install Colony CD 5
2005-10-03T11:33:00.000Z	bitblit	Travis|H	k ty
2005-10-03T11:34:00.000Z	bitblit	Travis|H	I take it colony 5 is just an updated preview build?
2005-10-03T11:34:00.000Z	Travis|H	bitblit	yea
2005-10-03T11:34:00.000Z	bitblit	Travis|H	cool, ty.
