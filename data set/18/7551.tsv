2008-06-20T02:15:00.000Z	Storrgie		I am running an XP virtual machine in VMware Workstation, the VM doesnt recognize the chipset/VGA/SCSI
2008-06-20T02:15:00.000Z	Storrgie		What can I Do?
2008-06-20T02:16:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 does the VM run in low-res mode?
2008-06-20T02:16:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	nope, i can run it in anything
2008-06-20T02:17:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 can or can't? if it runs but looks lousy, did you install the tools?
2008-06-20T02:17:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	nope, didnt install tools
2008-06-20T02:17:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 without the tools installed, resolution will be poor and performance will be awful.
2008-06-20T02:18:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 so XP comes up in the vm, but display is poor, right?
2008-06-20T02:18:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	nope display is nice, everything is pretty sweet except that the mouse is jittery
2008-06-20T02:18:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 yep, that's sign #1 you need the tools!
2008-06-20T02:18:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	lemme install tools
2008-06-20T02:19:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 you should see marked improvement once installed. also, will you be installing Win2K3 Server?
2008-06-20T02:19:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	right after i install SP3
2008-06-20T02:19:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	nope, I just need an XP VM to run Adobe CS3 in
2008-06-20T02:19:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	because i guess CS3 is a no go in ubuntu
2008-06-20T02:19:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 BE SURE to turn on graphics acceleration in Win2K3 Server. it's off by default (unlike XP) and it will be LOUSY to use until you do tools and enable it.
2008-06-20T02:20:00.000Z	bobstro	Storrgie	 oh then never mind. XP just needs the tools.
2008-06-20T02:20:00.000Z	Storrgie	bobstro	would you please come into #Digital-it
