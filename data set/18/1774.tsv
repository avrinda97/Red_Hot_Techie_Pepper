2011-04-01T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	sl33k_	in what respect ?
2011-04-01T15:38:00.000Z	sl33k_	ikonia	it says like this PREFIX=/path/to/where/I/want/directory
2011-04-01T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	sl33k_	what are you actually trying to do
2011-04-01T15:39:00.000Z	sl33k_	ikonia	this is before compile to find the prefix to the directories not in root.
2011-04-01T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	sl33k_	you can set --prefix to where ever you want then, --prefix is where you want to install it, that's up to you
2011-04-01T15:41:00.000Z	sl33k_	ikonia	will the path be something like ~/home/media/840...  or   /media/840 ?

2011-04-01T15:42:00.000Z	sl33k_	ikonia	yea but where to start the path. noobie at paths.
2011-04-01T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sl33k_	where ever YOU want
2011-04-01T15:44:00.000Z	sl33k_	ikonia	path will start with /media or /home/media?
2011-04-01T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	sl33k_	where YOU want
2012-03-23T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	sl33k_	just remove them using the package manager
