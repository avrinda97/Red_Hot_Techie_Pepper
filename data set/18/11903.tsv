2006-08-21T09:07:00.000Z	rayston		where is the sound adapter on ubuntu? what is the path?
2006-08-21T09:08:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	try the forums. You have asked that probably 20 times
2006-10-02T16:08:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	you have tried mounting it
2006-10-02T16:08:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: how do I do that? it shows up in the disks tool, but it isnt enabled (the browse button is greyed out) and clicking enable has no affect
2006-10-02T16:09:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	what is the name of the hard drive
2006-10-02T16:09:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: hdc1
2006-10-02T16:10:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	ok open up a terminal and do this first make the directory where you are going to mount it "mkdir whatever" then try mounting it in that directory "sudo mount /dev/hdc1 ~/whatever"
2006-10-02T16:13:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	did that work or what?
2006-10-02T16:14:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: it says : mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2006-10-02T16:14:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	what is the file system type? is it ext3 ntfs fat32 or what
2006-10-02T16:14:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: the type should be ext3
2006-10-02T16:15:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	do sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdc1 ~/whatever
2006-10-02T16:17:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock
2006-10-02T16:18:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: so, is my superblock bad?
2006-10-02T16:18:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	looks like the drive is corrupted
2006-10-02T16:18:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: does that mean its unsaveable?
2006-10-02T16:19:00.000Z	bruenig	rayston	here is where my knowledge stops
2006-10-02T16:20:00.000Z	rayston	bruenig	: thanx for the help so far
