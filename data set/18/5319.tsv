2010-03-28T06:13:00.000Z	Roasted		are laptop wireless adapters typically change-able for other modelS? I'm wondering if I can drop in an RTL 8187B card from 1 toshiba satellite tha's dead and put it in place of this BS ATheros card that wont work in another working toshiba...
2010-03-28T06:14:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	likely they are if it is the EXACT SAME model
2010-03-28T06:15:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	they're not... Satellite A215 vs L25
2010-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	i wouldn't swap them out.... but that is just me..... others might tell you it is ok.
2010-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	I just need to get this dang atheros working... its driving me nuts
2010-03-29T04:59:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	install madwifi?
2010-03-29T04:59:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	I'm dealing with a graphics issue - not the wifi issue. That's a whole other story in itself.
2010-05-09T09:53:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	so setup hardward raid 0 or raid 5
2010-05-09T09:54:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	hardware raid isnt an option. I either need to figure out how to do it software-wise or just continue rsyncing raw data to my backup drive
2010-05-09T09:56:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	if your main drive fails, you can just boot from the rsynced one.
2010-05-09T09:56:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	I dont have the rsync set up to take EVERYTHING - but I was told on forums you cant do that anyway, so I only rsync stuff in my home dir.
2010-05-09T09:57:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	sure you can.... i don't think you can for /dev or /proc but you can get everything else if you run it as root
2010-05-09T09:58:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	hm, really? I was told on forums that was kind of a definite no go...
2010-05-09T09:59:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	root can copy pretty much anything that isn't chmoded 000. and /dev/ and /proc/ are mounted on boot....
2010-05-09T09:59:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	you will need to install grub to the rsync drive's mbr to be able to boot from it.
2010-05-09T10:02:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	but wait... if I DONT install grub, I could technically use super-grub t0 boot the backup drive anyway - right?
2010-05-09T10:02:00.000Z	aetaric	Roasted	yes
2010-05-09T10:03:00.000Z	Roasted	aetaric	good deal. thanks bro.
