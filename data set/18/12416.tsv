2007-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	burepe_		Is this my video card? "01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. ProSavage KM133" this is out put from lspci
2007-01-05T10:18:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	ah thats a troublesome card ive heard
2007-01-05T10:18:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	yeah. it worked in 6.06 fine. Now I have 6.10 and it is junk
2007-01-05T10:20:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	sorry no. vesa not working?
2007-01-05T10:22:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	Yeah I got 800x600 resolution. It is too low. I tried to fix it by running the auto detector again and I got in an endless log-in screen loop. Same thing happend when I edited xorg.conf to use 1024x768
2007-01-05T10:23:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	you might google that card and see if there are some funky settings that work best in the xorg.conf file.  other than that the only thing i know about it is hearing a few friends complain about em
2007-01-05T10:24:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	how could it work in 6.06 and not now? maybe I should use a 6.06 live cd and check the settings
2007-01-05T10:25:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	updated drivers maybe?  personally im sticking with 6.06 for a while anyway :)
2007-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	thanks for the info. can you tell me what is the name of the card. I mean, what part of this line is the name I should search? 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. ProSavage KM133
2007-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	s3 prosavage km133
2007-01-05T10:29:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	s3 used to be a cool company for cards in the day
2007-01-05T10:30:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	try http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=318520 maybe.
2007-01-05T10:31:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	thanks
2007-01-05T10:33:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	is this a savage card?
2007-01-05T10:33:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	yep
2007-01-05T10:33:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	unless something has changed last few years
2007-01-05T10:40:00.000Z	burepe_	pike_	 I am gonna try out that link you sent me, but I also searched the card name and there wasn't so many hits, so I was wondering if there is a different way to refer to this card? savage? or vega? Do you know what I mean?
2007-01-05T10:41:00.000Z	pike_	burepe_	i normally think of it as an s3 card or savage i mean yours is a prosavage. not sure of diff
