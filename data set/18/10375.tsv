2007-01-14T07:29:00.000Z	habeeb		Hello.I would like to find a way to completely block access to a website. Both to my computer and to a macintosh laptop I have.
2007-01-14T07:29:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	do you mean from a browser ?
2007-01-14T07:30:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	ye.
2007-01-14T07:30:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	and the web site is a public one ?
2007-01-14T07:30:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	yes
2007-01-14T07:31:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	the two computers cant be simultaneously in the PC. You have to remove the ethernet cable from one and plug it to the other, to work.
2007-01-14T07:31:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	redirect the web site to 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts file - works for the Mac as well, if it runs OSX
2007-01-14T07:31:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	muh ?
2007-01-14T07:31:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	if I change my /etc/hosts, it will have effect in the mac pc as well? :/
2007-01-14T07:32:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	the Mac also has an etc/hosts file, if it runs OSX
2007-01-14T07:32:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	it does.
2007-01-14T07:32:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	no
2007-01-14T07:32:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	i see.
2007-01-14T07:32:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	well, if the modem allows you to eidt hosts
2007-01-14T07:33:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	just point the web site to a non-existent IP, like 10.0.0.1
2007-01-14T07:33:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	can you add host names in the modem/router ?
2007-01-14T07:34:00.000Z	habeeb	adaptr	do you know the option it might be in?
2007-01-14T07:35:00.000Z	adaptr	habeeb	how would I know how your modem works ? it should be in the manual
