2007-04-01T16:22:00.000Z	Kazol		Is there any way to refresh a floppy drive rather than remounting it?
2007-04-01T09:46:00.000Z	Kazol		I'm about to install Sun Java JRE. Should I download the rpm file or self-extracting file?
2007-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	Kazol		should I download rpm or self-extracting file??
2007-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	self extracting
2007-04-01T10:16:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	is there any reason you need to, you should probably use the repositories
2007-05-01T07:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	sudo apt-get remove programname
2007-05-01T08:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	as in make a copy?
2007-05-01T08:07:00.000Z	Kazol	bruenig	yes, to bypass the latest protection (not only css) while shrinking the dvd using k9copy.
2007-05-01T08:07:00.000Z	Kazol	bruenig	kind of like the linux equivelent of "anydvd"
2007-05-01T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	well I use xdvdshrink. It has never failed me even on commercial dvds
2007-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	Kazol	bruenig	does it remove dvd regions and do I update each week?
2007-05-01T08:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	it rips the thing into an mpg and then creates a dvd from that. So I guess you could say it removes dvd regions. So long as it can rip it, you can do whatever you want.
2007-05-01T08:10:00.000Z	Kazol	bruenig	so it could compress DVD9 into DVD5?
2007-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	yeah, that is what it does, "shrink"
2007-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	Kazol	bruenig	thx, but I'm having trouble installing it. I could not find good directions online.
2007-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	you get the .tar.gz, unzip and run the install.sh script
2007-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	Kazol	it will tell you what dependencies you are missing
2007-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Kazol	bruenig	thx, I'll try it later
