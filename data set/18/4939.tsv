2009-01-10T13:00:00.000Z	caiotormin		I'm having some problems with ubuntu's installation, probably caused by my vga
2009-01-10T13:00:00.000Z	caiotormin		anyone can help me?
2009-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	caiotormin		when I try to install, after the loading (orange bar) there was a black screen with the white cursor totally freezed/distorted
2009-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	caiotormin		my vga is VIA Chrome S#
2009-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	caiotormin		S3
2009-01-10T13:03:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	drop into a console and look at /var/log/messages/X*
2009-01-10T13:03:00.000Z	caiotormin	Iraimbilanja	even my ubuntu has not been installed?
2009-01-10T13:05:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	try Ctrl-Alt-Backspace at the distorted screen. It kills X so you get the console, hopefully.
2009-01-10T13:07:00.000Z	caiotormin	Iraimbilanja	I've seen this tip before, but when the screen is distorted, any command works :/
2009-01-10T13:07:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	you mean NO command works?
2009-01-10T13:09:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	Then reboot, and at the first Ubuntu menu, look at the options. I believe there may be stuff like "safe mode", or "select videomode" (somewhere at the bottom). For the latter, try a few different videomodes
2009-01-10T13:10:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	Also just in case, from the same menu, run "check cd integrity" AND "memory test"
2009-01-10T13:11:00.000Z	caiotormin	Iraimbilanja	I tried this, memory and CD was OK.. so, do you know some cheatcode to put on boot line? I tried also xforcevesa
2009-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	not really. But keep googling.
2009-01-10T13:14:00.000Z	caiotormin	Iraimbilanja	thank you anyway :)
2009-01-10T13:15:00.000Z	caiotormin	Iraimbilanja	which distro you uses?
2009-01-10T13:16:00.000Z	Iraimbilanja	caiotormin	giving Ubuntu a spin right now
