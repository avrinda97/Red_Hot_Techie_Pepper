2006-07-04T08:46:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	what happens when you type fglrx-info in term?
2006-07-04T08:47:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	did you manually make the deb packages and run them?
2006-07-04T08:47:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	the gui installer doesn't have them for ubuntu...read the whole guide :D
2006-07-04T08:47:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	read method 2
2006-07-04T08:48:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	oh ok you did that....did you do all the steps?
2006-07-04T08:49:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	maybe so
2006-07-04T08:49:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	automatix is the devil!
2006-07-04T08:50:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	well which are you running?
2006-07-04T08:51:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	i dunno then, sorry...it worked fine for me...the only problem i had was i had to replace libGL.so.1.2 with the old version

2006-07-04T08:52:00.000Z	juztin	andrew__	i think you do that with a text editor, no?
