2008-04-11T19:40:00.000Z	geirha	salko	do you have any package programs open? like update-manager or synaptic?
2008-04-11T19:40:00.000Z	geirha	salko	close it first, only one such program can function at a time, they lock each other out
2008-04-11T19:43:00.000Z	geirha	salko	log out to the login-screen. At the login-screen hit Ctrl+Alt+Backspace (this will restart it)
2008-04-11T19:43:00.000Z	geirha	salko	if the xserver-xgl package is installed, it will be used instead of xorg
