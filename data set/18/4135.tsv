2011-02-05T17:41:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	what do you want to achieve?
2011-02-05T17:42:00.000Z	Ddorda	mkanyicy	to login a user to his gnome desktop using ssh
2011-02-05T17:43:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	you want to open terminal and ssh to a machine and then a window pops up that you can click files on?
2011-02-05T17:44:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	rather try 'remote desktop' option
2011-02-05T17:45:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	you can also do 'ssh -Y username@remote-computer' and then type 'gnome-pannel'
2011-02-05T17:46:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	the remote pannel will 'replace' your local one
2011-02-05T17:46:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	in that way you have an access to files & apps in that machine, in a mouse click way
2011-02-05T17:47:00.000Z	Ddorda	mkanyicy	but that is not what i'm trying to do
2011-02-05T17:47:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	what are you trying to do, once again?
2011-02-05T17:47:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	like?
2011-02-05T17:47:00.000Z	Ddorda	mkanyicy	to connect a user to his gnome account
2011-02-05T17:49:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	now I realise what you want to do
2011-02-05T17:49:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	i misunderstood you completely
2011-02-05T17:49:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	sorry then
2011-02-05T17:49:00.000Z	Ddorda	mkanyicy	okay :) so you have an idea?
2011-02-05T17:49:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	nope
2011-02-05T17:50:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Ddorda	:/9
