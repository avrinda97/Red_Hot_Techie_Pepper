2011-01-23T15:05:00.000Z	Cornelius		hello, if i start 2 processes by using the & keyword: "gedit & vlc"; if i call "killall vlc" they both die. how do i stop that from happening?
2011-01-23T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	don't use &
2011-01-23T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	no you don't
2011-01-23T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	no, you put graphical apps in your session startup not rc.local
2011-01-23T15:08:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	its for a server, i have x11 running on it for testing only.
2011-01-23T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	so ? that doesn't change what I said
2011-01-23T15:09:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	im not familiar with "session startup", where can i find more info on it
2011-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	its my understanding that the session startup only runs after someone logs in, i need root to start them just after booting up. i think ive explored the session startup option
2011-01-23T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	that makes no sense, gedit won't start until after someones logged in and a desktop is running, so in that case sesison manager is fine
2011-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	gedit was an example. i actually need it for a few peices of software
2011-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	ok, ANY X11 software will only run after someone logs in, so the point is still valid
2011-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	well i have x11vnc and a teamspeak3 server that needs to run as root after boot. without a login, how do you prepose i run those?
2011-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	they are not X11 apps
2011-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	the examples you gave are X11 apps, those are not
2011-01-23T15:21:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	im aware of that, sorry i gave bad examples! do you have any suggestions as to how i can run them, and kill one without them both dying?
2011-01-23T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	you don't use & as I told you
2011-01-23T15:22:00.000Z	Cornelius	ikonia	yes thanks you've said that already. It still doesnt point me in the right direction
2011-01-23T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Cornelius	it doesn't as the & problem was for X11 apps, if you're not running X11 apps, you can just put them in rc.local
