2010-03-02T15:12:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	erUSUL	ok ty
2010-03-25T16:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jimi_Neutral	to remove configuration files when you remove a progam use aptitude purge instead of aptitude remove (apt-get has purge to so does synaptic)
2010-03-25T16:03:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	erUSUL	i just did sudo apt-get --purge profptd and it did not work
2010-03-25T16:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jimi_Neutral	maybe it is proftpd-basic or other proftp package the one holding the conf files (proftp is a virtual package)
2010-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	erUSUL	well the dir is called just 'proftpd' i did see somethign about basic when i installed it so i just tied that but says it isnt installed so it cannot be removed....i just wanna delete a damn file! how hard can it be! lol
2010-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jimi_Neutral	install it again; then purge
2010-03-25T16:07:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	erUSUL	cannot start proftpd, please check syntax of your config file in /etc/proftpd/proftpd.config......lolol
