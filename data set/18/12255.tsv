2011-03-07T21:19:00.000Z	joeb_		elFidel- dpkg -i didn't help elFidel  its asking for dependancies
2011-03-07T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	if you use apt-get or the package manager it matches and installs dependencies for you
2011-03-07T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	what command did you use to install and what package
2011-03-07T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	what did I just say "apt-get or the package manager (synaptic/aptitude/etc) will match and install dependencies for you
2011-03-07T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	what are you trying to install
2011-03-07T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	how are you trying to install it
2011-03-07T21:22:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	that's not using apt or the package manager
2011-03-07T21:22:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	don't download debs and install them that way
2011-03-07T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download/Ubuntu
2011-03-07T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	it says use the PPA
2011-03-07T23:12:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	it's still available isn't it ?
2011-03-07T23:17:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	what do you want to build ?
2011-03-07T23:19:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	why do you want to build it ? building things when you don't know what you are doing can have serious implications to your systems stability ?
2011-03-07T23:19:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	is there a problem with the package from the repo ?
2011-03-07T23:24:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	dpkg -l shows the application packages installed
2011-03-07T23:24:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	or you can just open the package manager which has a nicer interface
2011-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	joeb_	where are you suprirsed by that, as yesterday you where asking why it was removed, so you must have used it
