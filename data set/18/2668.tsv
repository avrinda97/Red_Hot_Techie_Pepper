2011-04-01T17:24:00.000Z	Uboss		I have Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop Edition (Normal Ubuntu), if I would like to change my Ubuntu to Ubuntu Netbook Remix Edition, can I?
2011-04-01T17:25:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 open synaptic package manager    ,, hit search ,, tyep   netbook,,, you probably wanth the gnome one not the kubuntu one
2011-04-01T17:26:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 so look for  ubuntu-netbook
2011-04-01T17:26:00.000Z	Uboss	coz_	I don't know :P I would like the Netbook edition which says in www.ubuntu.com (I would like to transform into that through upgrade process if possible).
2011-04-01T17:26:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	oh the 11.04
2011-04-01T17:27:00.000Z	Uboss	coz_	yeah but with Netbook's User Interface
2011-04-01T17:27:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	  well my suggestion is not to upgrade to 11.04  but clean install,,, however ,, it really is not ready
2011-04-01T17:27:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	  well the similar interface in is ubuntu netbook edition but not sure if it is identical to the natty netbook Unity
2011-04-01T17:27:00.000Z	Uboss	coz_	can I transform my ubuntu into ubuntu netbook's edition and stay on 10.04 as I am now?
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 sure ,, just install the ubuntu-netbook   ,, I would google ubuntu 10.10  netbook screenshots to be sure its what you want
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 rather google ubuntu 10.04
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 with  netbook and take a look at it
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	Uboss	coz_	thanks dude. :)
2011-04-01T17:29:00.000Z	Uboss		have a nice day everyone
2011-04-01T17:29:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 if your system is fairly  new  it should be able to handle it  otherwise  mutter,, the compositor will take up resources,,aka  a hog
2011-04-01T17:29:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 or wait until the end of April for the release of ubuntu 11.04
2011-04-01T17:30:00.000Z	Uboss	coz_	I have Ubuntu 10.04 LTS now. An idea came into my mind today if I would be able to change my Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.04 or 10.10. Anyway, I will search more and then decide. Thanks!
2011-04-01T17:31:00.000Z	coz_	Uboss	 ok
