2006-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		i wanted a question about ubuntu
2006-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		i think it is a very good distro
2006-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		but it is using a i386 kernel for "compatibility" but dapper cant run on a cel700+128ram
2006-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		i think the low-power pcs like pentium1 & co
2006-10-01T16:59:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		will never run with gnome and
2006-10-01T16:59:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		for fluxbuntu/xubuntu its okay it canrun on low machines. but dapper desktop??
2006-10-01T16:59:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		it needs a minimum 256mb of RAM
2006-10-01T05:00:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		and, thats my question
2006-10-01T05:00:00.000Z	dark_light	georgeofthejungl	well you can install the 'default' ubuntu dapper and then install xubuntu on top of it
2006-10-01T05:00:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		why not using a 686 kernel for gnome and kde version ?
2006-10-01T05:01:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl	dark_light	okay i know that but... for 686 kernel its minimum Pentium3 no ?
2006-10-01T05:01:00.000Z	dark_light	georgeofthejungl	yes, i think
2006-10-01T05:01:00.000Z	dark_light	georgeofthejungl	but ubuntu desktop doesn't come with 686 kernel.. i think
2006-10-01T05:02:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl	dark_light	:so why the ubuntu developers include it ? i know you must recompile all but why not a 686edition and386 edition
2006-10-01T05:02:00.000Z	georgeofthejungl		because installing a new kernel  is hard for newb I think
2006-10-01T05:03:00.000Z	dark_light	georgeofthejungl	no, installing a new kernel is just a matter of doing apt-get
2006-10-01T05:03:00.000Z	dark_light	georgeofthejungl	sudo apt-get install linux-image-686, then reboot
