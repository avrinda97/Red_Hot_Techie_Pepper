2005-06-19T11:26:00.000Z	greg		hey, i accidently screwed up my gnome, somehow the top bar ended up on the right, and i can't move it back to the top for some reason, any ideas why?
2005-06-19T11:27:00.000Z	nickrud	greg	it's because you can't grab taht thing with the mouse.
2005-06-19T11:27:00.000Z	greg	nickrud	can i do it manually then?
2005-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	greg	yeah, with app->system tools->Configuration editor
2005-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	greg	I really can't help you there, I'm not that brave
2005-06-19T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	greg	hang on a sec, I'll tell you where, I did that myself
2005-06-19T11:29:00.000Z	greg	nickrud	lol, figured it was for me
2005-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	greg	in the left panel, expand apps to /apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel_screen0, and change, in the right panel, orientation back to top
