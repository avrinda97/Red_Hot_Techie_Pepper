2006-02-25T09:57:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	main  and  main on the cd are !=
2006-02-25T09:58:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	true .. maybe its finding the one on the CD first.
2006-02-25T10:24:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	isn't it fdisk -p /dev/hdx?
2006-02-25T10:25:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	no.
2006-03-19T09:22:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	why don't you use swap?  you've never had a runaway proccess eat all your memory and cause a kernel panic?
2006-03-19T09:22:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	oom killer takes care of that.
2006-03-19T09:23:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	and if it didn't it wouldn't matter how much swap you had it would still fill it all up and panic anyway.
2006-03-19T09:24:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	takes longer :)
2006-03-19T09:26:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	yeah.... and i have one box with no usb and every linux i have installed on it yet, boots to a point where it sets up usb and "runs away" there,  if it has to fill swap it takes a long time for it to oomK and continue the boot,  without swap about 5 minutes.   so  there are pros & cons  to everything.
2006-03-19T09:30:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	is oomK a standard part of the kernel or does it need to be installed and configured?
2006-03-19T09:31:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	default afik
2006-03-19T09:32:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	okay ... I was doing some reading up.  Now that I know what it is, I've seen this in action before when it couldn't find any proccesses to kill to free memory and then still kernel panicked (that was some really badly configured machine)
2006-04-24T10:57:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	yeah, sorry for the imprecision.
2006-04-24T10:58:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	np.  only mentioned it because there is device nodes  ttys*
2007-07-21T10:40:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	I'm guessing you're using the console
2007-07-21T10:41:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	i use console mostly,   but run kde blackbox gnome and twm   at times
2007-07-21T10:43:00.000Z	intelikey	Falstius	& compengi it tickels me to watch linux users "freek" when you say "no swap"  just like it does to watch windows users "freek" when you san "firewall ?  what's that?"    or "anti-virus?  what for?"
2007-07-21T10:44:00.000Z	Falstius	intelikey	we run a lot of servers without swap.  But for my desktop it isn't an option.
