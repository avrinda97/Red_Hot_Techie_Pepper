2007-04-23T07:01:00.000Z	IncredibleHink		I need some help with my hot swap hard drive bay please
2007-04-23T07:03:00.000Z	IncredibleHink		How do i update my bios without the windows tool?
2007-04-23T07:03:00.000Z	\x-it	IncredibleHink	Update as in Flash your BIOS to a newer version?
2007-04-23T07:03:00.000Z	IncredibleHink	\x-it	yes
2007-04-23T07:03:00.000Z	\x-it	IncredibleHink	To do ^ you just have to burn a cd or write a floppy and use it as your startup drive
2007-04-23T07:03:00.000Z	\x-it		It will update fine
2007-04-23T07:04:00.000Z	\x-it		No need for the Windows program, use another one of the methods provided
2007-04-23T07:04:00.000Z	IncredibleHink	\x-it	sounds reasonable..... i dont think there is a newer bios for my board though.... but just a question i had
2007-04-23T07:04:00.000Z	\x-it		ah, ok
2007-04-23T07:04:00.000Z	\x-it		Yes, it is
2007-04-23T07:04:00.000Z	\x-it		Dell provides the Windows exe to do it, a bootup CD and a boot floppy all to do the same thing
2007-04-23T07:05:00.000Z	\x-it		It's pretty easy no matter the manufacturer though without Windows.
2007-04-23T07:05:00.000Z	IncredibleHink	\x-it	I have two 320gb SATA hdd, one installed internally and one installed in a hot swap bay..... why would my bios not detect the one in the hotswap bay? any ideas?
2007-04-23T07:05:00.000Z	\x-it	IncredibleHink	Was it recently hotswapped while your computer was actively on?
2007-04-23T07:05:00.000Z	IncredibleHink	\x-it	the computer has never seen it, but yes my initial try was while the computer was on
2007-04-23T07:06:00.000Z	IncredibleHink	\x-it	then i tried enabling it then booting up.... still no dice
2007-04-23T07:06:00.000Z	\x-it		Is it listed in your Bios before you get in Linux at all?
2007-04-23T07:08:00.000Z	IncredibleHink	\x-it	any ideas?
