2006-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		AC3 as well
2006-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		(and DVDs with CSS)
2006-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	Spec	Samus_Aran	mp3 isn't copyrighted in america anymore?
2006-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	Spec	Samus_Aran	I think what he meant to say was everything in VLC is free and opensource, and it's free/opensource implementations of patented formats
2006-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	it is fully patented.  currently they only charge for encoders, and ignore the people just decoding .. but their rules do state that there are fees even for the decoder.  they currently only go after hardware manufacturers, though
2006-06-12T12:09:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	I can't imagine them giving up their patent ... they earn many millions a year just on selling to hardware manufacturers (DVD players, portable music players, etc.)
2006-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	"Fraunhofer IIS-A, Audio & Multimedia" own most of the MP3 patents, and I think "THOMSON" has more
2006-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	Spec	Samus_Aran	The Fraunhofer patents expire April 2010, at which time MP3 algorithms become public domain.
2006-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	Spec	Samus_Aran	Furthermore, while attempts have been made to discourage distribution of encoder binaries, Thomson has stated that individuals using free MP3 encoders are not required to pay fees. Thus while patent fees have been an issue for companies attempting to use MP3, they have not meaningfully impacted users, allowing the format to grow in popularity.
2006-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	exactly the same as GIF/LZw
2006-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	and any day they can start cracking down and suing individuals and companies of all sizes and rake in billions
2006-06-12T12:15:00.000Z	Spec	Samus_Aran	You mean, in 2009?
2006-06-12T12:16:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	one would hope they wouldn't be as shady as UniSys (massively building up popularity, then suing like mad), but they do still go after anyone earning money even indirectly from an MP3 encoder
2006-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	a very new video codec
2006-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	once it is ironed out, it will offer better compression than XviD/DivX
2006-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Spec	Samus_Aran	for the trade off of cpu usage?
2006-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	currently it has pretty inefficient decoders, though
2006-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Spec	I suppose by the time it goes mainstream Joe Schmoe will have twice as fast CPU as is needed =p
