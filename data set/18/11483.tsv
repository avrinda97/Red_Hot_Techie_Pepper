2007-01-06T13:58:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	and then u run apt-get update
2007-01-06T13:58:00.000Z	scifi	cyber_brain_mfkg	ok so try recovery mode, then apt-get update
2007-01-06T13:59:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	hold on
2007-01-06T13:59:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	u said u was doing update of your programs after u finished update 2 6.10?
2007-01-06T14:01:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	then u enter maintenance mod and type sudo apt-get update
2007-01-06T14:02:00.000Z	scifi	cyber_brain_mfkg	yes. the main 718mb update downloaded. i also had updates available from the update alert synaptic pop-up, but there was a list of updates that were skipped, it then suggested i do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade again, which i did, and thats when the problem occured
2007-01-06T14:03:00.000Z	scifi	cyber_brain_mfkg	but wont it ask for my password again when i do sudo apt-get update ?
2007-01-06T14:04:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	just enter terminal mode and type sudo apt-get update or if that doesn't work type sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-01-06T14:04:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	that should fix your problem!
2007-01-06T14:05:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	yes but u know your password right?
2007-01-06T14:12:00.000Z	scifi	cyber_brain_mfkg	i tried recovery mode, after it scrolls thru line sof code, it eventually says Begin: waiting for root file system ... then nothing happens :P i may as well just download the 6.10 cd and do a fresh install :P
2007-01-06T14:14:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	that would be best! sorry but i don't know other solutions for your problem!
2007-01-06T14:15:00.000Z	scifi	cyber_brain_mfkg	luckily i wont lose any important data. im just using ubuntu experiment/experience linux as an alternative to windows :)
2007-01-06T14:15:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	scifi	ok!;)
