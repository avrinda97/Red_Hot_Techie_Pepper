2008-09-03T18:11:00.000Z	qr	jrib	that was meant for you.
2008-09-03T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	qr	:)
2008-09-06T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	qr	scilab, octave, maxima, scipy/numpy to name a few
2008-09-06T01:51:00.000Z	qr	jrib	those are all numerical packages afaik, which is not what I'm looking for
2008-09-06T01:52:00.000Z	jrib	qr	you need to be more specific than "mathematics" then.  Are you looking for symbolic manipulation?
2008-09-06T01:52:00.000Z	qr	jrib	yes, which is why I said "mathematica like"
2008-09-06T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	qr	never mind, I misread.  mathematica runs on linux, as does maple.  Try maxima and scipy
2008-09-06T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	qr	s/scipy/sympy
2008-09-06T01:54:00.000Z	qr	jrib	I'll try that, thanks.  I've used mathematica for linux before, but I can't find a version that works on my system (I'm getting libc version errors :\ )
2008-09-06T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	qr	bah, there's a page on help.ubuntu.com if you do a search
2008-09-06T01:55:00.000Z	qr	jrib	oh, excellent I'll go look for it
2008-09-06T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	qr	the maple page there I know works if you have that as I use it myself
2009-05-30T21:40:00.000Z	jrib	qr	does not exist
2009-05-30T21:40:00.000Z	qr	jrib	really? I was sure I read about one a while ago...
2009-05-30T21:41:00.000Z	jrib	qr	okay maybe.  I'm not aware of one though
2009-05-30T21:42:00.000Z	qr	jrib	it's alt+sysreq+k now (ubottu knew)
2009-05-30T21:42:00.000Z	jrib	qr	ah my mistake, thanks for taht info
