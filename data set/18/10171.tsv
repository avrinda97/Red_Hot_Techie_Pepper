2007-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	|Sora|		Is there a firewall for linux with good configuration capabilities?
2007-01-06T13:51:00.000Z	|Sora|		i want it to ask me before it does anything, not let it be preconfigured
2007-01-06T13:51:00.000Z	|Sora|		i think thats what iptables does, right?
2007-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	|Sora|		i didn't mean that
2007-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	|Sora|		i meant the rules are set before hand, not a tthe time of connection
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	|Sora|		ok, basically i want it to ask me "Do you wan tto allow this connection to this IP" bla bla.. something likethat
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	check out firestarter. it will let you right-click on connections to set the rules and let you decide what happen to that connection.
2007-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	it doesn't warn you about outgoing connections though. you need to monitor it yourself. it's not like Zonealarm but it is simple to use if you need a software firewall
2007-01-06T13:56:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	fortunatley it is not nesseccary
2007-01-06T13:57:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	give firestarter a go. I think you'll like it
2007-01-07T16:07:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	Beryl/Compiz is a 3d accelerated window manager
2007-01-07T16:09:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	there are some "fake" transparencies in a couple of window managers, but in Gnome you have no such option as far as I know
2007-01-07T16:12:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	right click on the bottom bar and add a window list applet to it
2007-01-07T16:17:00.000Z	|Sora|	Jowi	its a wine application that dont show up
2007-01-07T16:41:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	why wouldn't it be? steganography is to hide information inside other data. like hiding a message within a message.
2007-01-07T16:46:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	I would compare it to any other type of security measure - security by obscurity. not bad but also not foolproof.
2007-01-07T16:47:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	in truecrypt, the hidden volume is hidden. you need to know the exact name of the hidden volume in order to mount it. it is not visible.
2007-01-07T16:48:00.000Z	Jowi	|Sora|	someone can see that the file is 300MB large and that it only contain 290MB of data but that's it.
