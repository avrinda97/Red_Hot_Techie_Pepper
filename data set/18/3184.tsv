2011-06-05T12:21:00.000Z	adminewb		My 802.11g PCI wireless adapter on linux i386 requires ndiswrapper to use a Win32 driver; am I without recourse for using the same hardware on linux amd64?
2011-06-05T12:23:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	it would stand to reason
2011-06-05T12:24:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	if theres not a 32 bit kernel module that supports your hardware without ndiswrapper it's doubtful theres a 64 bit one
2011-06-05T12:25:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	and you're saying then that no one's done a 64 bit ndiswrapper to support windows 64 bit drivers
2011-06-05T12:25:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	no i didn't say that
2011-06-05T12:27:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	so how would I go about discovering one or confirming it doesn't exist?
2011-06-05T12:28:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	whats the chipset in  your wireless card
2011-06-05T12:31:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	it's a Marvell chip, let me see
2011-06-05T12:32:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88w8335 [Libertas]
2011-06-05T12:35:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	Marvell wireless chip is 88w8335 [Libertas]
2011-06-05T13:40:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	use the same UID/GID?
2011-06-05T13:41:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	that's harder to keep control of
2011-06-05T13:42:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	gnome.org or whatever...i'm sure they have a git repo pull it into your home dir and install the same repo in both ... done
2011-06-05T13:42:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	that also doesn't get at the core of the matter, which is that different distros all using same release of GNOME may still have different ideas how they want default settings to be
2011-06-05T13:43:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	make them read only after you set the settings how you want
2011-06-05T13:43:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	that would probably help, once I figure out how to restore things to how they were xD
2011-06-05T13:43:00.000Z	celthunder	adminewb	and the .files are there FOR YOUR SETTINGS if somethings overwriting them it's a trash program anyway don't use it
2011-06-05T13:44:00.000Z	adminewb	celthunder	wish it were so simple
