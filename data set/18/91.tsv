2012-09-22T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Avaris_	 if a new user works.. then you may want to reset all your settings for the old user.
2012-09-22T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Avaris_	 you dont need to do a fresh install IF its just user settings..
2012-09-22T18:54:00.000Z	Avaris_	Dr_Willis	gimme a min, ill try to make neew user
2012-09-22T18:56:00.000Z	Avaris_	Dr_Willis	so, it works. i made a new user
2012-09-22T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Avaris_	 using the console, make a backup directory in your probllem users home,, them move the .gnome* and .gconf* and perhaps some other directoryies to it. then try logging in to see what setting messed things up. BUT first. check who owns your .Xauthority file. it should not be owned by root
