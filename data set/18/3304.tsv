2009-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	I'm applying the postfix ++ operator to vim, because I like vim
2009-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	rance94	mhs	o ok
2009-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	I guess that's c++, but oh well
2009-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	rance94	mhs	soo i need help with vim like how do i run/compile after i type the code?
2009-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	ctrl+z, then type make
2009-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	then type fg and fix what didn't compile
2009-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	or look at eclipse
2009-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	rance94		ahhh thx alot this works with c++ right casue if it does i might yell and rejoice and luv vim
2009-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	rance94	mhs	i dont like eclipse i could never get it to work lol i like vim
2009-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	an even better solution is to use gnu screen with vim
2009-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	then you can have your editor in one screen, and run make in another screen, and switch back and forth
2009-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	rance94	mhs	can u pm me because i dont know how to do that
2009-11-20T08:53:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gnu+screen
2009-11-20T08:54:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	got a lot on my plate right now
2009-11-20T08:55:00.000Z	rance94	mhs	o ok well that control z thing didnt work :(
2009-11-20T08:55:00.000Z	mhs	rance94	don't give up on it.  screen + vim == very powerful and fast
