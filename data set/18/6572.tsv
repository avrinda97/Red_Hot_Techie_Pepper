2008-09-02T04:45:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	when I go to use an ssh connection I get a "connection refused", but vnc works fine
2008-09-02T04:46:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	what does vnc have to do with ssh?
2008-09-02T04:46:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	Well it just means that I can get through the firewall
2008-09-02T04:46:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	and try using the -v switch to ssh.  ssh -v user@host
2008-09-02T04:46:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	or lack there of
2008-09-02T04:47:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	that should make ssh verbose and give you an indication as to what's wrong.
2008-09-02T04:47:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	what does that do, verberos?
2008-09-02T04:47:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	ohh ok

2008-09-02T04:50:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	my guess is that sshd is not running, your firewall is blocking ssh connections or your router, if you have one, isn't setup to forward ssh traffic
2008-09-02T04:51:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	you say you have vnc access .. if you can try doing this.  sudo /etc/init.d/ssh* restart
2008-09-02T04:53:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	I get a "command doesn't exist"
2008-09-02T04:53:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	and I have used vnc before
2008-09-02T04:53:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	paste the full error message please.
2008-09-02T04:54:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	"sudo: /etc/init.d/ssh*: command not found"
2008-09-02T04:55:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	that indicates that you don't have openssh-server installed.
2008-09-02T04:56:00.000Z	vbman11	unop	"sudo apt-get install openssh-server"?
2008-09-02T04:56:00.000Z	unop	vbman11	yes
