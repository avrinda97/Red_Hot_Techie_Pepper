2008-05-29T19:25:00.000Z	sektor666		hey guys
2008-05-29T19:25:00.000Z	sektor666		i need some help with x11. i think.
2008-05-29T19:26:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	what is the issue?
2008-05-29T19:27:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	what graphics card? lspci | grep -i graphics
2008-05-29T19:28:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	ahh... those are blacklisted by compiz unfortunately and I'm not sure where.
2008-05-29T19:29:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	Yes, the maintainer of Compiz in Ubuntu blogged about it... hold on
2008-05-29T19:31:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	http://www.realistanew.com/2007/09/23/compiz-in-ubuntu-update/  ... you have a 965 card...
2008-05-29T19:32:00.000Z	sektor666	fde	hmm... i still don't quite understand. compiz is responsible for the desktop effects, right?
2008-05-29T19:32:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	yes
2008-05-29T19:33:00.000Z	sektor666	fde	well it's not desktop effects that i need in the separate x session. it's hardware acceleration for a game
2008-05-29T19:33:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	ahhh... sorry.
2008-05-29T19:34:00.000Z	sektor666	fde	but the game runs at 15fps in the main window and at 1 fps in the separate session
2008-05-29T19:36:00.000Z	sektor666	fde	i thought it might be xorg.conf-related, but then the main x session would be affected too, right?
2008-05-29T19:36:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	correct... I've never attempted to run multiple xsessions though, so I'm not sure if that's normal or what...
2008-05-29T19:37:00.000Z	sektor666	fde	from what i managed to establish, the script i use to start the game in a separate x session works for users with ati and nvidia cards. so it might be intel-related too
2008-05-29T19:38:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	perhaps... would appear support for that card isn't particularly good if Compiz guys aren't allowing it to be used.
2008-05-29T19:38:00.000Z	sektor666	fde	since i'm new to linux, i don't even know which part of x's configuration is responsible for enabling/disabling acceleration, so i'm not even sure where to start diagnosing the problem
2008-05-29T19:44:00.000Z	fde	sektor666	Most aren't bad at all... I have one... just that model is acting up.
