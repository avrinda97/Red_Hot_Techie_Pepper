2009-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	tado		hey all. firefox takes up to 10-15 sec to load, is it a normal start up time, or it's actually a slow one?
2009-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	om26er	tado	try chromium,
2009-12-06T23:01:00.000Z	tado	om26er	? another browser or..?
2009-12-06T23:02:00.000Z	om26er	tado	yes
2009-12-06T23:02:00.000Z	om26er	tado	to install chromium sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
2009-12-06T23:02:00.000Z	tado	om26er	i'll check it out, but i'm pretty fine with firefox for now. any clue on why it's not loading any faster?
2009-12-06T23:03:00.000Z	om26er	tado	might be some extensions causing that
2009-12-06T23:03:00.000Z	om26er	tado	disable all extensions, reboot and see if it helps
2009-12-06T23:04:00.000Z	tado	om26er	i'll give it a try
2009-12-06T23:07:00.000Z	tado	om26er	it's also weird, because it opens it up with a strange view while loading. this is a print screen of the 2sec it stays in that situation http://www.ShareCow.com/Download.aspx?request=2d6e4d5b-3a35-4a00-8bc2-77f08be3129a
2009-12-06T23:08:00.000Z	om26er	tado	you are using an older version of firefox. you might wanna try a newer version like 3.5.5
2009-12-06T23:09:00.000Z	tado	om26er	it's not in the repositories or..?
2009-12-06T23:10:00.000Z	om26er	tado	use ppa
2009-12-06T23:11:00.000Z	tado	om26er	i already use 3.5.5 :)
2009-12-06T23:12:00.000Z	om26er	tado	my mistake i thought you were using jaunty. but is it karmic?
2009-12-06T23:12:00.000Z	tado	om26er	yep, karmic
2009-12-06T23:14:00.000Z	om26er	tado	offtopic but for future uploading images you can use imagebin.org
2009-12-06T23:15:00.000Z	tado	om26er	i was wondering about something similar, honestly :) thanks
