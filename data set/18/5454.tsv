2010-10-14T17:37:00.000Z	kai696		what if i try to unmount THEN remount ? just incase
2010-10-14T17:38:00.000Z	kai696		negative, won't let me unmount from gparted
2010-10-14T17:38:00.000Z	sipior	kai696	try using lsof to see what's holding the partition open.
2010-10-14T17:39:00.000Z	kai696	sipior	: everything
2010-10-14T17:40:00.000Z	sipior	kai696	it's obviously not everything. find out which processes, and then kill them.
2010-10-14T17:42:00.000Z	sipior	kai696	i don't see the problem. you have the process IDs, what's keeping you from killing them?
2010-10-14T17:43:00.000Z	kai696	sipior	don't know how to on linux, and i don't know how to read that output
2010-10-14T17:44:00.000Z	sipior	kai696	ah, now we're getting somewhere. the process id is the second column. killing processes is done with "kill <pid>". alternatively, you can use pkill, if you like.
2010-10-14T17:45:00.000Z	kai696	sipior	but which processes would I kill to make the volume mount ?
2010-10-14T17:46:00.000Z	sipior	kai696	the ones that were reported by lsof as having open files on the partition you want to unmount.
