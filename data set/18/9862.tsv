2007-02-11T09:49:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	really?  the last i had heard of it was in middle school
2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	well, i use it often enough.  of course i have a kaypro and c64 that run it :)  there are emulators too.
2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	hahaha ... i threw away anything older than a socket A about 6 months ago
2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	the wife made me
2007-02-11T09:51:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	i had nearly 100 different systems. down to a dozen or so now
2007-02-11T09:58:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	probably SATA power connectors
2007-02-11T10:02:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	actually, free is the focus here.  use freedos, menuetos, haiku, and will likely use reactos when it goes beta.
2007-02-11T10:02:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	i havent really found a practical use for haiku or reactos
2007-02-11T10:03:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	i just like checking stuff out.
2007-02-11T10:03:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	i am guilty of that too ---- notice i didn't say i hadn't TRIED either OS, just that i couldnt find a practical use for them :)
2007-02-11T10:07:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	i think haiku will be useful pretty soon.  reactos problably in about a year but only for those things i REALLY need windows.  not that that will be too often.  but when an oss os goes v1 i add it to my rotation.
2007-02-11T10:08:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	i have a few "trash machines" that i am always loading new OSes on to test them
2007-02-11T10:10:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	i'm anti commercial for personal use.  and i'm kinda tired of paying for desktops that are basically a reshuffling of the same stuff around so it's hard for me to find in the new version.  like buying a new car and the only real changes are they moved the cup holders to places i'm not used to and don't like.
2007-02-11T10:12:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	windows is relatively inexpensive considering it is an operating system that people use every day of their life at work and home ----- granted you and I might know better than to run it, but windows suits most people's needs
2007-02-11T10:12:00.000Z	eontasticness_	larson9999	i've bought software before that i used on a regular basis, because i found it useful
2007-02-11T10:13:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	yeah, but i decided years ago i've paid enough for windows.
2007-02-11T10:15:00.000Z	larson9999	eontasticness_	i love windows for WORK.  makes me tons of money.  i'm only talking personal use.
