2007-05-13T08:11:00.000Z	griswald		hello, can wise people tell me if it is good to upgrade from dapper>edgy>feisty?
2007-05-13T08:11:00.000Z	griswald		or should i stay with dapper
2007-05-13T08:12:00.000Z	griswald		hmm
2007-05-13T08:13:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	i just installed feisty on another partition seperate from dapper, im liking feisty
2007-05-13T08:13:00.000Z	griswald	gaten	hmm ok
2007-05-13T08:13:00.000Z	griswald	gaten	i shall install fiesty then, thank you for your input people
2007-05-13T08:14:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	np, getting my feisty desktop to the point that my dapper was at only took like 2 hours of installing, feisty makes so many things easy
2007-05-13T08:14:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	i believe so. im using compiz, which works great
2007-05-13T08:15:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	but make sure you install gnome-compiz-manager to make your life easier
2007-05-13T08:15:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	wireless didn't work at all on my wife's laptop w/ feisty, so i can give you much help there
2007-05-13T08:16:00.000Z	griswald	gaten	well, wireless works on this computer under dapper, but when i go to fiesty it wont work with ndiiswrapper?
2007-05-13T08:16:00.000Z	griswald	gaten	iam using ndiswrapper atm
2007-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	i would assume it will, i just couldnt get the latop to work. doesnt mean you wont be able to
2007-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	griswald	gaten	you sound knowledgable about linux, may i ask you a part about a tutorial
2007-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	gaten	griswald	have at it
2007-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	griswald	gaten	is it possible to go to another room, the screen is filling up so fast on this screen
