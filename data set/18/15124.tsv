2005-05-04T12:32:00.000Z	transgress		irivers are nice, but for the price of 1 gig i can get 4 on an ipod... bleh
2005-05-04T12:34:00.000Z	transgress		people still watch tv?
2005-05-04T12:36:00.000Z	transgress		what really pissed me off about mtv... as if it weren't stupid enough that they had to make mtv2 just to show music videos... then they start showing shows on mtv2
2005-05-04T12:36:00.000Z	transgress		of course i didn't really like them before all that... but still... that was really asinine
2005-05-04T12:37:00.000Z	transgress		i prefer to download stuff nowadays... i don't even have my tv plugged in
2005-05-04T12:37:00.000Z	transgress		it's like i can watch mtv for a few days hoping to see the music video i want... or i can download it and watch it now and as often as i want
2005-05-04T12:39:00.000Z	karljp	transgress	is the iriver really that much more expensive?
