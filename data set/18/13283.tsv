2005-12-31T17:37:00.000Z	meepy		Ok, I try unistall in synaptic first, and then with the command you gave
2005-12-31T17:38:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	if you used dpkg-divert removing the package will still keep the diversion
2005-12-31T17:38:00.000Z	meepy	mwe	im new to linux, i don't really know what im doing hehe :(
2005-12-31T17:53:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	you used dpkg-divert and didn't remove the diversion
2005-12-31T17:53:00.000Z	meepy	mwe	I dunno what that is.
2005-12-31T17:54:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	you followed the firfoxNewVersion wiki to install ff1.5 right?
2005-12-31T17:54:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	it tells you to use dpkg-divert and make sure you remove the diversion if you remove ff1.5
2005-12-31T17:55:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	sudo dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/firefox will remove the diversion
2006-01-04T12:43:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	use checkinstall to install it instead
2006-01-04T12:43:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	it creates a .deb and installs it for your. you can then use dpkg -r to uninstall
2006-01-04T12:44:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	not all source packages provides an uninstall mecanism, but with those that do you can unstall with make uninstall from the source dir if you kept it
2006-01-04T12:45:00.000Z	meepy	mwe	what if I did not keep it?
2006-01-04T12:46:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	then you're probably fsck'ed or you can redownload and compile/install then make uninstall
2006-01-04T12:46:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	not all source packages provides make uninstall though, but most do
2006-01-04T12:47:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	no just use checkinstall instead
2006-01-04T12:47:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	instead of sudo make install you just type sudo checkinstall
2006-01-04T12:47:00.000Z	meepy	mwe	stupid question: using checkinstall so I then target the .tar.gz folder or the files itself?
2006-01-04T12:48:00.000Z	mwe	meepy	you ./configure and make as usual. at the point where you would sudo make install you would then sudo checkinstall instead
