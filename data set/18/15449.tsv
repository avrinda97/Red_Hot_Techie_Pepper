2005-03-22T12:15:00.000Z	ratl3		i havn't patched my kernel that much
2005-03-22T12:17:00.000Z	ratl3		writing support is in my kernel
2005-03-22T12:17:00.000Z	ratl3		2.10 vanilla
2005-03-22T12:18:00.000Z	ratl3		i'm on ubuntu
2005-03-22T12:18:00.000Z	ratl3		i don't know about the ubunto kernel
2005-03-22T12:18:00.000Z	ratl3		ubuntu
2005-03-22T12:19:00.000Z	ratl3		i just did a make menuconfig in my kernel dir
2005-03-22T12:19:00.000Z	ratl3		heh
2005-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	ratl3		what would be better for a myth tv machine
2005-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	ratl3		i've been leaning xfs
2005-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	I have a myth machine, running reiser.  I wish I had put XFS on it.  XFS is faster at deleting large files.
2005-03-22T13:27:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	That's exactly the wrong approach.  Telling them they "must" do something will only get their backs up.
2005-03-22T13:32:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	Umm...
2005-03-22T13:34:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	You're kidding yourself.
2005-03-22T13:41:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	you'll get no argument from me on that.
2005-03-22T13:42:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	Yeah, but they've supported you all these years. :-)
2005-03-22T13:54:00.000Z	ratl3	DarthFrog	haha
2005-03-22T14:14:00.000Z	DarthFrog	ratl3	and emacs itself isn't available.
