2007-03-20T13:21:00.000Z	jexdawg		how does one go about mounting a floppy ?
2007-03-20T13:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	mount /dev/fd0. Appears in /media/floppy iirc
2007-03-20T13:23:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	What does "file /mount/floppy*" say?
2007-03-20T13:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	Pf, doesn't even exist. xD Nevermind then...
2007-03-20T13:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	No.
2007-03-20T13:26:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	I could only give you advice on how to mount it manually... but you'd need to be root to access it. Or add it to fstab.
2007-03-20T13:26:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	Pastebin your /etc/fstab.
2007-03-20T13:27:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	cat /etc/fstab
2007-03-20T13:30:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	....uh... that's your exact fstab?
2007-03-20T13:31:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	Well that explains your floppy problems. xD
2007-03-20T13:31:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	"gksu gedit /etc/fstab" and go to the last line. Change /dev to read /dev/fd0
2007-03-20T13:32:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	Save. Then you can insert a floppy and "mount /dev/fd0" if it doesn't mount automatically (it might)
2007-03-20T13:37:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	I don't use gnome so I can't give you any advice about that error... sorry. Use "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" instead.
2007-03-20T13:40:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	What do you mean, locate? xD It's at /etc/fstab. You need to be root to edit that file, yes. What does sudo say? Your system is messed up.
2007-03-20T13:42:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	What does it say?
2007-03-20T13:44:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	What does it actually say?
2007-03-20T13:45:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	You ever used nano\pico or vi before?
2007-03-20T13:46:00.000Z	ArrenLex	jexdawg	miguel: I have to go... good luck, all!
