2010-08-13T20:26:00.000Z	NinjaNumberNine		Hi guys, does anyone know how to access the system files in a Live CD environment? (Kubuntu 10.04, but the distro doesn't matter)
2010-08-13T20:26:00.000Z	littlepenguin	NinjaNumberNine	you cannot change data on a cd
2010-08-13T20:28:00.000Z	NinjaNumberNine	littlepenguin	i just wansn'
2010-08-13T20:28:00.000Z	littlepenguin	NinjaNumberNine	after this do : dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-08-13T20:34:00.000Z	NinjaNumberNine	littlepenguin	i'm afraid i've been doing that all morning, with small variations and/or in exact copy. It always restarts into console tty and when i run startx, it says something about there being no screens found, (set up for dual screens with nvidia geforce 7xxx (i think it's 7300 to be exact) card and has been working well for several weeks. I have tried deleting, then reconfiguring, but to no avail... not to mention, the dpkg-reconfigure -p high
2010-08-13T20:35:00.000Z	littlepenguin	NinjaNumberNine	did you install nvidia driver
2010-08-13T20:36:00.000Z	littlepenguin	NinjaNumberNine	try sudo nvidia-xconfig
2010-08-13T20:40:00.000Z	littlepenguin	NinjaNumberNine	maybe you have the wrong drivers..you could try to use envy for graficsdriver installation
2010-08-13T20:40:00.000Z	NinjaNumberNine	littlepenguin	at this point i'd be glad to get back to even the vesa drivers and work from there... i cannot use envyNG in tty.
2010-08-13T20:41:00.000Z	NinjaNumberNine	littlepenguin	btw i wonder if there's anything to the new nouveau drivers ubuntu made for the nvidia cards?
2010-08-13T20:42:00.000Z	NinjaNumberNine	littlepenguin	it does? i hadn't known, mind telling be how to access it?
2010-08-13T20:42:00.000Z	littlepenguin	NinjaNumberNine	 sudo envy
