2006-06-10T16:21:00.000Z	h4v0k		how do i make it make your name red
2006-06-10T16:22:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	Where did you get that file from ?
2006-06-10T16:23:00.000Z	h4v0k	neutrinomass	its a game
2006-06-10T16:24:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	It's been compiled against libstdc5. I gues that by 'sudo aptitude install libstdc++5 ' the game may run...
2006-06-10T16:26:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	Since it's not in the repos, you might encounter other difficulties too. If this is the case, check the website for dependencies and install them by hand (you will realize why package managers are useful)
2006-06-10T16:29:00.000Z	h4v0k	neutrinomass	how do delete the file i made for it it says unable to delete it is a directory
2006-06-10T16:30:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	: If it's a file, then 'rm blah' should do it. If it's a directory, you need 'rm -r blah_dir'.
2006-06-10T16:32:00.000Z	h4v0k	neutrinomass	i forgot whats the command to make a passwd for root
2006-06-10T16:33:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	Ubuntu doesn't use a root account - have you enabled it ?
2006-06-10T16:33:00.000Z	h4v0k	neutrinomass	no i dont think so i just used my password for sudo
2006-06-10T16:35:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	You don't really need a root account. You can get a root account with "sudo -i". Otherwise, you're usually fine with "sudo <command>" (the "root" password is your user password )
2006-06-10T16:36:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h4v0k	A root account is not strictly neccessary, that's why it has been disabled. Most distros use it because of tradition(?) I guess ? Read the link ubotu gave you, it will probably be helpful.
