2007-02-07T14:34:00.000Z	Fedge		How can I install gnome from the command line?
2007-02-07T14:34:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-02-07T14:35:00.000Z	Fedge	musya	thanks a lot, i've been struggling for an hour
2007-02-07T14:37:00.000Z	Fedge	musya	once installed, "startx" starts up gnome, right?
2007-02-07T14:39:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	you can change the session type in the login screen
2007-02-07T14:40:00.000Z	Fedge	musya	could you elaborate a bit?
2007-02-07T14:41:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	in your login screen once you restart, you will see a menu option there go to session type, and choose gnome
2007-02-07T14:41:00.000Z	Fedge	musya	this is after ubuntu-desktop is installed?
2007-02-07T14:41:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	correct
2007-02-07T14:42:00.000Z	Fedge	musya	is there anyway to install gnome without having to DL and install the full blown desktop version?
2007-02-07T14:44:00.000Z	Fedge	musya	sounds like i should just stick to the whole thing
2007-02-07T14:44:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	thats the easiest way to go
2007-02-07T14:45:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	well i suppose you can delete it later,
2007-02-07T14:48:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	he said gnome2
2007-02-07T14:52:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	in terminal type synaptic
2007-02-07T14:55:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	either reinstall ubuntu with the desktop
2007-02-07T14:58:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	its ok, dont worry about that people who complain about others just think too highly of themselves
2007-02-07T14:59:00.000Z	musya	Fedge	id suggest installing the ubuntu-desktop and getting familiar with the terminal
