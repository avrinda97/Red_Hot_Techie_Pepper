2011-10-26T17:10:00.000Z	dr_willis		that sounds like a reinstall may  be faster.
2011-10-26T17:10:00.000Z	dr_willis		!clone
2011-10-26T17:12:00.000Z	dr_willis		if you have aptitude installed...
2011-10-26T17:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		gone
2011-10-26T17:15:00.000Z	gentoofan	dr_willis	It shouldn't let you do that on Windows. It doesn't permit directories that are open to be moved/deleted.
2011-10-26T17:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 eww.. you Could in theory  boot a live cd and perhaps reinstall the packages..  or copy the files from a differnt install.. neither is a great way to do it.
2011-10-26T17:09:00.000Z	gentoofan	dr_willis	is there a command I can do to reinstall all?
2011-10-26T17:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 not sure..  you would basically reinstall EVERYTHINg on the system i guess.. :()
2011-10-26T17:10:00.000Z	gentoofan	dr_willis	Isn't there a simple command to apt that I can do? E.g. apt-get install everything or something like that.
2011-10-26T17:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 perhaps tha variant of that clone trick
2011-10-26T17:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 the above commands did do that  via the package maanger tool aptitude
2011-10-26T17:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 yep. all of your apt* binaries/tools may be gond
2011-10-26T17:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 ive done worse in windows.. by accident.. :) accidently drag/dropped a special folder into some sub dir...
2011-10-26T17:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 its definatly happened to me in the past.
2011-10-26T17:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 its also stopped me from deleting single files that were NOT in use  :)
2011-10-26T17:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 but thats enough of windows ranting. heh.
2012-01-28T20:13:00.000Z	gentoofan	dr_willis	It should be able to work it out. Portage's emerge can do it without a problem.
2012-01-28T20:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	gentoofan	 cant say that ive nituced that,
