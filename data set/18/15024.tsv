2005-05-23T11:10:00.000Z	psychonate		btw people
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	psychonate		anyway, I was very angry yesterday because Firefox froze my system up entirely, and that should never happen IMO
2005-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	psychonate		so, if that happens again, I'm going to slaughter some random family
2005-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	psychonate		:(
2005-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	psychonate		I really don't like rebooting
2005-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	didn't kill -9 help?
2005-05-23T11:13:00.000Z	psychonate	Seveas	goofrider well, it was bad enough that I couldn't restart X with ALT+CTRL+BACKSPACE nor could I get to a console to issue kill commands
2005-05-23T11:13:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	sounds like a bigger problem tan an FF freeze
2005-05-23T11:15:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	if you REALLY want to know: download the source and look throught the .config ;)
2005-05-23T11:15:00.000Z	psychonate	Seveas	ah, I wouldn't know what to look for
2005-05-23T11:16:00.000Z	psychonate	Seveas	I assume that is a yes.
2005-05-23T11:17:00.000Z	psychonate	Seveas	I'm no expert, but I always thought that preemptible kernels were slightly less stable.
2005-05-23T11:17:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	no idea :)
2005-06-18T10:31:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	not really
2005-07-07T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	might be an I/O hang, which is a kernel thing and cannot be interrupted...
2005-08-07T14:41:00.000Z	psychonate	Seveas	isn't it only a dummy package?
2005-08-07T14:42:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	w32codecs?
2005-08-09T15:12:00.000Z	Seveas	psychonate	thanks for the 'most'
