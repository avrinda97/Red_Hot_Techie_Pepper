2005-10-22T09:47:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	what
2005-10-22T09:48:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	I tried the network-manager that you suggested and it royally screwed my system. There is some kind of conflict between what it does and the vmware network modules
2005-10-22T09:49:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	there were alot of kernel error messages so I removed network-manager. I wonder what was the problem...
2005-10-22T09:49:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	That is why you don't use vmware
2005-10-22T09:49:00.000Z	SEJeff		run linux natively :P
2005-10-22T09:50:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	no I run linux natively
2005-10-22T09:50:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	I installed vmware in linus
2005-10-22T09:50:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	Sorry, I guess it is not for you
2005-10-22T09:50:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	I don't use vmware, and it works surprisingly well
2005-10-22T09:51:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	yeah... I think it was due to a specific module that does bridged networking between guest and host
2005-10-22T09:51:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	Maybe I'll try to get rid of that one since I never use it
2005-10-22T09:53:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	If you are able to, nm is a really cool app
2005-10-22T09:53:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	I just wanted to try it... I guess it's mostly useful with a laptop which I don't have
2005-10-22T09:54:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	Actually, it does wired, wireless, and vpn
2005-10-22T09:54:00.000Z	SEJeff	frank23	If you do any 2 of those, it can't be beat
2005-10-22T09:54:00.000Z	frank23	SEJeff	ok thanks for the info ;-
