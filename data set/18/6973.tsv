2008-02-24T18:54:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist		omg #ubuntu+1 is NO help
2008-02-24T18:55:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	well it is still only Alpha5--best be patient ;]
2008-02-24T20:49:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	if you are not ready for breakage you should not be using Hardy--the channel for that is #ubuntu+1
2008-02-24T21:48:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	skip wubi and use the live cd
2008-02-24T21:39:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	on gutsy?
2008-02-24T21:47:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	sure, but you are on Hardy, right?
2008-02-24T21:48:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	no, i'm installing wubi, then upping it to a full partitions
2008-02-24T21:48:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	7.04 -> 7.10
2008-02-24T21:49:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	but i don't have any spare partitions
2008-02-24T21:49:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	resize with the installer will do it fine
2008-02-24T21:50:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	ok, but i'm doing a full vista backup first
2008-02-24T22:33:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	it wouldn't work as it is the mobo that doesn't work
2008-02-24T22:34:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	try the alternate cd then /msg ubotu alternate
2008-02-24T22:36:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	the problem is that the jmicron chipset wont support the grub bootloader
2008-02-24T22:39:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	well that is odd--what about lilo--is that still supported in ubuntu?
2008-02-24T22:40:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	lilo?
2008-02-24T22:41:00.000Z	bazhang	CorruptTerrorist	it is still supported apparently--an alternative to grub
2008-02-24T22:42:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	bazhang	i'll try wubi for a week, and if it blips at all, i'll go for the proper thing
