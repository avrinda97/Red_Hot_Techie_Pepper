2008-01-25T09:35:00.000Z	josiah		Is it not illegal for an ISP to cut down your speed from 800kbs to 24kbs because you use a lot of bandwidth? I stream movies and download a lot of files and they keep cutting my internet speeds down because of it. In the USA btw. Anybody know?
2008-01-25T09:36:00.000Z	josiah		doesnt that seem like a crappy thing for an isp to do? I have never delt with an isp that has done that before.

2008-01-25T09:37:00.000Z	josiah		i talked to them and they said if you use so much bandwidth the server throttles your speeds down
2008-01-25T09:37:00.000Z	josiah		and i dont believe anything like that was in the terms and agreement
