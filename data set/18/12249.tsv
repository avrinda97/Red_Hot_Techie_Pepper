2012-05-19T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	lubuntu (which is LXDE) is not an LTS release.
2012-05-19T20:32:00.000Z	zion	ikonia	thanks for clarification,Ill wait to see how will  Mint 13 perform on my old pc. If everything fails ill try Xubuntu. I think it has 5 yr LTS
2012-05-19T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	no, it doesn't
2012-05-19T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	only Ubuntu is LTS nowe

2012-05-19T20:33:00.000Z	zion	ikonia	Geez us with old PC dont have any luck with LTS
2012-05-19T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	that's not what it's there for
2012-05-19T20:34:00.000Z	zion	ikonia	so ill get securtiy updaes for ubuntu but wont get updates for LXDE and XFCE?
2012-05-19T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	you'll get security updates to the core OS components on any LTS release.
2012-05-19T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	but the external components such as xfce (for example) are down to the team that maintains it
2012-05-19T20:36:00.000Z	zion	ikonia	Well then Lubuntu can get security updates for 5 next years? It just wont get any LXDE updates after 18 months right?
2012-05-19T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	zion	at a basic level, sure, that's it
2012-05-19T20:37:00.000Z	zion		Thanks ikonia If I do remember correctly you helped me in past with ubuntu 10.10. Keep up the good work. Bye
