2010-11-24T10:22:00.000Z	weed_up		my ubuntu can't boot ，can someone help ？
2010-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	ferris_	weed_up	what is it doing? where is it getting stuck?
2010-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	weed_up		i opened my disk with winhex ，and found that the boot sector all filled with 00
2010-11-24T10:24:00.000Z	ferris_		did you install inside windows?
2010-11-24T10:25:00.000Z	ferris_	weed_up	did you install inside windows?
2010-11-24T10:26:00.000Z	weed_up		i install win7 in another hard disk
2010-11-24T10:27:00.000Z	ferris_	weed_up	did you install windows or ubuntu first?
2010-11-24T10:27:00.000Z	weed_up		install ubuntu first
2010-11-24T10:27:00.000Z	ferris_		that is the problem
2010-11-24T10:27:00.000Z	ferris_		win7 is a pain...
2010-11-24T10:28:00.000Z	ferris_		always install win7 first, then ubuntu... reinstall ubuntu
2010-11-24T10:28:00.000Z	weed_up		but i installed ubuntu in a removable hard disk
2010-11-24T10:29:00.000Z	weed_up		and then insatlled win7。。。forgot to remove the disk
2010-11-24T10:30:00.000Z	ferris_	weed_up	there may be a different way to get ubuntu up and running and some one else might help but the way I would do it is to reinstall ubuntu
2010-11-24T10:32:00.000Z	weed_up		anyone have some documents descripting the struction of UFS boot sector
2010-11-24T10:34:00.000Z	ferris_	weed_up	if you have both ubuntu and winblows then you could probably get away with just installing the grub boot loader...
2010-11-24T10:34:00.000Z	weed_up		i really  tired in reinstalling systems- -
2010-11-24T10:37:00.000Z	weed_up	ferris_	my two systems are in two separate HDD
