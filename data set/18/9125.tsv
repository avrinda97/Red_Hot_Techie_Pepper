2009-01-28T17:59:00.000Z	catbooted		after a major upgrade (mainly kde 4.2), my dns service doesn't work now
2009-01-28T18:00:00.000Z	catbooted		i can use proxy software such as tor to get online
2009-01-28T18:01:00.000Z	catbooted		i wonder if anyone has the same problem
2009-01-28T18:01:00.000Z	catbooted		after today's upgrades
2009-01-28T18:01:00.000Z	catbooted		how do i check my network configuration? i can't resolve any domain name directly now
2009-01-28T18:02:00.000Z	Boohbah	catbooted	cat /etc/resolv.conf
2009-01-28T18:02:00.000Z	catbooted	Boohbah	it says:
2009-01-28T18:02:00.000Z	catbooted		# Generated by NetworkManager nameserver 192.168.1.1
2009-01-28T18:02:00.000Z	catbooted		(2 lines)
2009-01-28T18:03:00.000Z	catbooted	Boohbah	should i delete it?
2009-01-28T18:03:00.000Z	catbooted		it looks like it's a virus!
2009-01-28T18:04:00.000Z	catbooted		looks like a virus edited my resolv.conf and wrote "nameserver 192.168.1.1"
2009-01-28T18:04:00.000Z	Boohbah	catbooted	uhm, no. it was written by networkmanager when you recieved an ip address from your dhcp server
2009-01-28T18:04:00.000Z	Boohbah	catbooted	so whatever nameservers your router is using aren't working
2009-01-28T18:05:00.000Z	catbooted	Boohbah	but another computer in my home can resolve domain names
2009-01-28T18:06:00.000Z	catbooted	Boohbah	how do i check if it's my machine's software fault?
2009-01-28T18:09:00.000Z	Boohbah	catbooted	dig @192.168.1.1 domain.com
2009-01-28T18:11:00.000Z	catbooted	Boohbah	connection timed out; no servers could be reached
