2005-12-18T06:12:00.000Z	Cokey		which is best for .nzb files?
2005-12-18T06:12:00.000Z	Cokey		i have no idea how to open them
2005-12-18T06:12:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	I would suggest a google search :P, and maybe a bit of context on what's in the file, and where you got it from
2005-12-18T07:11:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	it probably relies on x86-specific code
2005-12-18T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	you want an install CD
2005-12-18T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	it'll work on PPC also
2005-12-18T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	ah, yeah, I was the first time too
2005-12-18T07:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	of course, I gained my courage formatting an older machine about 9 times :)
2005-12-18T07:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	the installer should partition everything up for you
2005-12-18T07:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	it only gets finicky with NTFS, which is a Windows FS
2005-12-18T07:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	no, most utilities don't format when repartitioning, they can resize partitions
2005-12-18T07:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	nope, it takes the free space, and allocates it to another parition, but listen to cafuego when he says that disk utility formats everything
2005-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	you're going to want to use a utility from either the Live CD, or simply use the included partitioner on the installer, do NOT use disk utility
2005-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	of course
2005-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	1 :)
2005-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	yeah, it does
2005-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	yeah
2005-12-18T07:19:00.000Z	Razor-X	Cokey	X is your GUI system
