2005-12-11T12:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	unix is a Linux clone
2005-12-11T12:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	strange but true - ubuntu is not redhat - only the names have been changed to protect the guilty
2006-12-10T11:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	there's an amarok option to show in systray
2006-12-10T11:51:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	well, it says it's not going to be closed but it will leave it's icon in the systray, but it doesn't also, I don't get any programs in the taskbar when they are started ( but I do an another account, though on that one amarok also doesn't give a systray icon
2006-12-10T11:52:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	the 'show tray icon" is checked
2006-12-11T16:13:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	why ?
2006-12-12T16:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	you read them
2006-12-12T16:31:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	change your /etc/X11/xorg.conf so it looks like the docs, from "This is what the relevant portion of my xorg.conf file looks like:"
2006-12-12T16:32:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	why 7 buttons ?
2006-12-12T16:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	scroll button counts as 3
2006-12-12T16:45:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	with your suggestion X failed to load, I had to reconfigure and reboot
2006-12-12T16:50:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	and I have found the option: it's called autoscrolling in the FF-preferences
2006-12-13T09:26:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	/etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2006-12-13T09:27:00.000Z	dreamer	frogzoo	thnx!
2006-12-13T09:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	dreamer	a sudo in front, btw
