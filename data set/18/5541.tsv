2008-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	bobertdos	NiCK_NaME	Have people already given you fstab information?
2008-10-02T00:50:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	like i said im new to linux i have NO clue what fstab is...
2008-10-03T00:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	NiCK_NaME	Did you ever get your hard drive worked out?
2008-10-03T00:16:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	yeah i did, but i screwed it up agian and yeah...
2008-10-03T00:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	NiCK_NaME	Oi vei!! What did you do now??? :p
2008-10-03T00:18:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	well i been having this on on going battle with virtualbox... and it yeah... well long story short, i can NEVER get virtualbox to work and this last time it screwed something up i have no idead how or what and i had to re-install ubuntu (giving me horriable flash backs of MS Windows) and now my drives wont mount agian...
2008-10-03T00:20:00.000Z	bobertdos	NiCK_NaME	Unfortunately, my Virtualbox experience is pretty minimal, not sure I'll be of much help.
2008-10-03T00:21:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	do you know how to mount USB Drives ? and have them auto mount ?
2008-10-03T00:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	NiCK_NaME	with or without virtualbox?
2008-10-03T00:22:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	i have the awesome conversation, and still do on how to do that, but it is on a USB drive i cannot mount so it is doing me ABSOLUTLY no good LOL!!!
2008-10-03T00:23:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	without virtualbox  i gave up on it...
2008-10-03T00:23:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	i get goose bumps with i hear the word virtualbox now
2008-10-03T00:23:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	virtualbox is the devil in computer application form...
2008-10-03T00:24:00.000Z	bobertdos	NiCK_NaME	Well, again, if devices (especially flash drives), don't automount when you plug them in, something is fairly amiss.
2008-10-03T00:25:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME	bobertdos	yeah... its horriable
