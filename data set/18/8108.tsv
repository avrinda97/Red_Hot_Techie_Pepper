2008-08-09T18:30:00.000Z	SNIa		hmm
2008-08-09T18:31:00.000Z	SNIa	hdevalence	purge that plugin, try mplayer?
2008-08-09T18:31:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	it's not a big deal.. I'll probably end up downloading the coverage from torrents and not look at the olympic scores until I watch it..
2008-08-09T18:31:00.000Z	SNIa	hdevalence	funny that, thats what i'm watching :)
2008-08-09T18:32:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	unfortunately for me, the events I'm looking for are from 3AM-6AM local time... So it's not too feasible to try to watch live
2008-08-09T18:33:00.000Z	SNIa	hdevalence	VLC can record streams
2008-08-09T18:33:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	I'll look into that...
2008-08-09T18:37:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	I think I'll have to check whether having VLC record a stream would be higher/lower quality than the torrent option
2008-08-09T18:37:00.000Z	SNIa		anyone know of a tile horizontally, or tile vertically windows organizing app ?
2008-08-09T18:37:00.000Z	SNIa		i'm surprised ubuntu doesn't have that feature
2008-08-09T18:37:00.000Z	SNIa	hdevalence	if the torrent is a capture of a HD stream... then :)
2008-08-09T18:38:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	Canada is going to take gold in 500m and 1000m 1-person kayaking :D
2008-08-09T18:38:00.000Z	SNIa		sweet
2008-08-09T18:39:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	I think KWin can tile horixontally/vertically, but I'm not sure
2008-08-09T18:39:00.000Z	SNIa		anything for tile windows?
2008-08-09T18:39:00.000Z	SNIa		hmm
2008-08-09T18:40:00.000Z	hdevalence	SNIa	let me do some research
