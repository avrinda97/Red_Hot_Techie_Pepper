2006-04-18T12:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	Yeah.
2006-06-09T10:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	So do you have all of your hardware supported on Hoary then?
2006-06-09T10:42:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tonyyarusso	sure.
2006-06-09T10:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	True, but I've been amazed how much can change in a year.
2006-06-09T10:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	I probably would upgrade for the new OOo alone myself.
2006-06-09T10:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tonyyarusso	oo  i never mess with it.   but if i did i might agree with you.
2006-06-09T10:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	Fair enough.  (I can't really talk here - we have a laptop running Windows 3.1 in my house.)
2006-06-09T10:44:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tonyyarusso	 that's more than a year old   shame on you....   lol

2006-06-09T10:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	Most stable Windows machine I've ever seen.
2006-06-09T10:46:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tonyyarusso	yeah.  so why upgrade something that works....   and you will see my point.
2006-06-09T10:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Agent_bob	Yep.
2006-06-09T10:46:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tonyyarusso	but i see yours also.
