2011-06-07T06:48:00.000Z	DBoot		Does this channel help with dual booting by chance?
2011-06-07T06:48:00.000Z	DBoot		Actually it's more of a partition problem

2011-06-07T06:49:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	If you ask your question I'm sure someone will try to help you.
2011-06-07T06:51:00.000Z	DBoot		Alright, so I currently have 4 different partitions on my HDD. One is a system partition, one is an unallocated partition with 450gb, one is a recovery partition, and one is a HP_tool partition
2011-06-07T06:52:00.000Z	DBoot		I am trying to split the 450gb partition into two 50gb partitions to install both ubuntu and windows 7 on each, and with the remaining space I would like to format it to NTFS so that I may store media files on it
2011-06-07T06:53:00.000Z	DBoot		I am able to split the 450gb partition into three unformatted partitions, but when I try and put and format the storage partition to NTFS it says you may only have 4 primary partitions on your hdd. So now I am stuck
2011-06-07T06:53:00.000Z	DBoot		Anyone have any advice on what to do?
2011-06-07T06:54:00.000Z	DBoot		Quant: Would I be able to format the 450gb using extended partitions and run the operating systems using those?
2011-06-07T06:59:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	read this please. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_partition#PC_partition_types
2011-06-07T07:02:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	I always install Microsoft Windows 7 first, before any other operating system gets installed. Windows 7 is more particular about where it can be in a partitioning scheme and duel-booters need the boot loader of a Linux OS to provide a boot menu that will list all OSes on the system at launch.
2011-06-07T07:03:00.000Z	DBoot	quant	I was reading though that Windows has problems running on an extended partition? Is that true?
2011-06-07T07:04:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	Yes, that is my understanding, I was wanting you to see that tidbit in particular. :)
2011-06-07T07:04:00.000Z	DBoot		Hmm, I think I may be able to work this out. Thanks alot quant. You helped me big time.
2011-06-07T07:06:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	Yes, Linux can boot from an extended partition. That last "yes" was about Windows needing to boot from a primary partition, as far as I know.
2011-06-07T07:06:00.000Z	DBoot		Hmm, nvm. Didn't work. I was going to create a 50gb primary windows partition and then an extended partition for the other two. It doesn't allow me to do it though.
2011-06-07T07:07:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	let Windows make its own partitions.
2011-06-07T07:09:00.000Z	brown_fern	DBoot	I wouldn't try to make an NTFS partition with Linux and then put Windows 7 in that somehow, Microsoft Windows 7 will likely want to reformat to an NTFS of its own design anyway.
