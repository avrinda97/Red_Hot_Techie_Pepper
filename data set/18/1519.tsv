2011-02-04T11:35:00.000Z	vish	AbhijiT	not very sure either, i guess package was uploaded to replace rather than to co-exist , like Firefox and Minefeild
2011-02-04T11:36:00.000Z	AbhijiT	vish	yeah. but i mean the reason is political or technical?
2011-02-04T11:36:00.000Z	vish	AbhijiT	not sure what you mean by "political" , but it might have just been that no one saw the necessity for co-existing
2011-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	AbhijiT	vish	okay
2011-02-04T11:37:00.000Z	vish	AbhijiT	you can just remove the ppa and downgrade back to OOo , if you have issues..
