2011-07-28T08:20:00.000Z	cypha		same problem
2011-07-28T08:21:00.000Z	cypha		and use ubuntu classic?
2011-07-28T08:23:00.000Z	cypha		any suggestions?
2011-07-28T08:23:00.000Z	cypha		I just downloaded alltray as ActionParsnip suggested
2011-07-28T08:23:00.000Z	cypha		but I was wondering if there was a legit solution, since the alltray solution still doesn't provide alerts
2011-07-28T08:24:00.000Z	cypha		LifeIsPain pointed me to the gsettings solution
2011-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	cypha		me too
2011-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	cypha		that comes stock with ubuntu
2011-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	cypha		how do I do that?
2011-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	cypha		which is faster, KDE or gnome?
2011-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	Dice-Man	cypha	imho i would say xfce is between gnome and lxde
2011-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	cypha		i just wanted something that is lightweight, highly compatible, and doesn't look like windows 95
2011-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	Dice-Man	cypha	then xfce could be good
2011-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	Dice-Man		but the ball is on your side :) just test it's free !
2011-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	cypha	Dice-Man	how do I try all these different things?
