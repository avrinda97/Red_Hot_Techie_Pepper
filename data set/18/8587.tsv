2007-08-01T08:30:00.000Z	Meyvn		Tristan, i am on the traditional xchat now
2007-08-01T08:30:00.000Z	Meyvn		Tristan, the windows build
2007-08-01T08:31:00.000Z	Meyvn		Tristan, well xchat-gnome has no smilies in ubuntu
2007-08-01T08:31:00.000Z	Meyvn		Tristan, at least for me
2007-08-01T08:31:00.000Z	Meyvn		i prefer old school smilies

2007-08-01T08:32:00.000Z	TimeTraveller	Meyvn	it worked... thanks ! :) one more question can it it be dangerus to use other peoples .deb files .. i meen if they baked in some malware ? or is it better to compile self ?
2007-08-01T08:33:00.000Z	Meyvn	TimeTraveller	no problem. Yes, that could be possible, although not very likely. Always check if the source is reliable (such as with the official reopsitories)
2007-08-01T08:34:00.000Z	Meyvn		yes I agree with what the people said before me
2007-08-01T08:35:00.000Z	Meyvn	TimeTraveller	no system is safe. Sadly, this is the truth.
