2007-03-25T14:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		hello room
2007-03-25T14:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		is there anyway to make ntfs drives to be writable ?
2007-03-25T14:15:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		lolz
2007-03-25T14:15:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		I just asked the same question earlier
2007-03-25T14:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		is it possible to make ntfs writable ?
2007-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	yes it is but you need some modules.
2007-03-25T14:21:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	I'm looking in synaptic looks like installing ntfs_progs and ntfs_tools might work for you...on the other hand you can recompile the kernel and choose to compile ntfs_write module into the kernel.
2007-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	ok then recompiling the kernel is a good exercise to learn more, but that might be overkill at this point.
2007-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	if you're using gnome desktop, click on system up at the top, click administration, and then synaptic package manager.
2007-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	when synaptic's open, do a search for ntfs
2007-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	then select ntfsprogs and ntfstools
2007-03-25T14:25:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	after you've installed them open a terminal (applications->accessories->terminal
2007-03-25T14:29:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob	rickyfingers	I am in terminal now
2007-03-25T14:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob	rickyfingers	what should I do next ?
2007-03-25T14:34:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	now you can use ntfscp to overwrite files...but not create new ones...kind of a bummer.
2007-03-25T14:34:00.000Z	rickyfingers	ubuntu_noob	I know you can get read write capability with recompiling the kernel, but that is a somewhat lengthy process.
