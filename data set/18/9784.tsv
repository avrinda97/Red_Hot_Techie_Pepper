2012-02-24T20:28:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	Doesn't firefox just launch an ubuntu application to find them? In other words, I don't think it's firefox that does the gksu but is actually some other tool
2012-02-24T20:38:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	So, the application that actually does the work is gnome-codec-install which firefox simply launches, so THAT is what would need to change
2012-02-24T20:39:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	was that intended for me?
2012-02-24T20:41:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	my bad, saw your other reply. Well I mean once I've selected the plugin to install, another box comes up that asks me for my password that looks very similar to gksu. And I know fromm previous experience that gksu-ing as root on ubuntu is a no-go.
2012-02-24T20:41:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	Line 91 of /usr/share/pyshared/GnomeCodecInstall/PackageWorker.py
2012-02-24T20:42:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	you could just edit that to be gksudo :)
2012-02-24T20:44:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	How strange, on this debootstrap install, I don't seem to have /usr/share/pyshared/GnomeCodecInstall folder. :/
2012-02-24T20:46:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	weird. do you have a binary called gnome-codec-install? type "which gnome-codec-install"
2012-02-24T20:47:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	Hmm, nope, I don't either.
2012-02-24T20:47:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	it's a debian distro you say? Not ubuntu? (I don't care heh)
2012-02-24T20:49:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	it's a debootstrapped ubuntu 11.04 install. So a basic install of bash, few other libs etc, then I chrooted into it and started adding packages from the official repositories. No Gnome/KDE DE stuff either.
2012-02-24T20:49:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	oh nevermind I see what it is. Hmm. I don't know. Without being in the environment to poke around not much I can tell. Try to figure out what the binary is called that FF is calling to do the loading, view the source and see what's happening :-/
2012-02-24T20:50:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	so despite the minimal userspace, FF still loads the install plugins thingy?
2012-02-24T20:51:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	yes, the plugin-service-finder or so the taskbar says. Which then calls something that looks like gksu, when I'd rather have it run gksudo. :)
2012-02-24T20:51:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	I may have to look in to this debootstrap thing myself. been meaning to learn how to create a nice safe chroot environment for others to be able to develop on my servers
2012-02-24T20:53:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	what's the difference between gksu and gksudo anyway?
2012-02-24T20:53:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	martian	ah cool. Likewise I've been wanting to investigate ssh chroot jails etc.
2012-02-24T20:56:00.000Z	martian	CharminTheMoose	anyway, maybe if you bring up the plugin-service-finder then hit ctrl-alt-f1, log in, and inspect what processes are running, you could find the actual binary
