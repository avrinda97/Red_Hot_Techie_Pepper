2009-12-08T12:37:00.000Z	MeatPopsicle	bdfoster	its asking me on my smartphone what kind of authentication i want to choose on the network im creating

2009-12-08T13:03:00.000Z	MeatPopsicle	bdfoster	now how do i get all of these bad ad hoc networks off the network manager list?

2009-12-08T13:04:00.000Z	bdfoster	MeatPopsicle	right click on the network manager, select edit connections, and delete the ones you dont like
2009-12-08T13:05:00.000Z	MeatPopsicle	bdfoster	i did but some of them aren't listed in there
2009-12-08T13:07:00.000Z	bdfoster	MeatPopsicle	then you should be good.
