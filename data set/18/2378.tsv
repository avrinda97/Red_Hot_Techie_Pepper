2010-06-25T17:38:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	it came with a cd but i dont know what to do with it. only for windows
2010-06-25T17:33:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	go to "Keyboard shortcuts" in preferences
2010-06-25T17:34:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	you cant do fn shortcuts from there...
2010-06-25T17:34:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	sure, select any action, and set a new shortcut
2010-06-25T17:34:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	wait, Fn shorctuts from a notebook or from a Mac?
2010-06-25T17:35:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	fn shortcuts from a logitech wireless keyboard on a Dell Zino HD.
2010-06-25T17:35:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	not a laptop. a desktop
2010-06-25T17:35:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	I'm sorry, but Fn shortcuts are embedded into the hardware, for non-Mac machines at least
2010-06-25T17:36:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	you mean like Fn + F4 = louder volume?
2010-06-25T17:36:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	i mean fn + f1 has an icon for word processsing. if i type fn + f1 there is no response
2010-06-25T17:37:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	because.... that's a Windows key combination...
2010-06-25T17:37:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	the best thing you could do is assign a new command to that key
2010-06-25T17:37:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	in the same window, add a new command to OpenOffice.org writer, for example, Abiword, or whatever you'd like to start
2010-06-25T17:37:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	then how do i do that? if i type fn+f1 in the keyboard shortcuts it only picks up f1
2010-06-25T17:38:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	does that keyboard need drivers in Windows?
2010-06-25T17:38:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	do you need to install a CD, or download something in order to the keyboard to work properly
2010-06-25T17:40:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	gbillings	there you have it. Your keyboard has specific functions that are Windows-only... try to searh your KB model and linux, maybe there are community driverts, I'm sorry i can't do anything else about that :(
2010-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	gbillings	Beyecixramd	alright thank you anyways ill go search the world wide web for answers :_
