2005-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	michele	asparagus	change your startup volume from system preferences
2005-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	asparagus	michele	in osx?
2005-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	michele	asparagus	set it to your ubuntu volume and you'll see the yaboot boot screen
2005-08-23T05:03:00.000Z	michele	asparagus	yes
2005-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	asparagus	michele	i dont think i can see that startup volume from osx
2005-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	michele	asparagus	or you could boot your system with the option key pressed and it will ask you
2005-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	michele	asparagus	try with the option key. if that work, you'll see that from osx too
2005-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	asparagus	michele	i want the system to default on yaboot
2005-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	asparagus		just press "o" at startup?
2005-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	michele		go and verify then
2005-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	michele		option
2005-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	michele		alt
2005-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	michele		press 'option', power on the mac and keep the key pressed until a blue screen with buttons appears
2005-08-23T05:08:00.000Z	asparagus	michele	i only get one button..the partition with osx
2005-08-23T05:09:00.000Z	michele	asparagus	I guess you don't have yaboot installed, then
2005-08-23T05:09:00.000Z	michele		!start an editor war
2005-08-23T05:09:00.000Z	asparagus		hmm i had it when i i had ubuntu
