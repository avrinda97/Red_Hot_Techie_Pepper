2010-01-24T19:42:00.000Z	beachbrake		I have an acer extensa, and ubuntu 9.04 installed on it. It creates a series of short sharp tapping noise everytime any audio file is played. I tried to reinstall it, it went off, but came back again when I installed audacity. I failed to understand the problem. Can anyone help?
2010-01-24T19:43:00.000Z	beachbrake		Can I get any help herE?
2010-01-24T19:43:00.000Z	tekkno	beachbrake	i dont think you will find someone with the same problem. cause audacity doesn change something on the core audio system (pulseaudio). Try to update to the latest ubuntu, thats always the best try
2010-01-24T19:44:00.000Z	beachbrake	tekkno	precisely whey i shifted from ubuntu 8.04
2010-01-24T19:44:00.000Z	beachbrake		I suspect there is a bug somewhere.
2010-01-24T19:44:00.000Z	tekkno	beachbrake	there is a new audio system (pulseaudio), which may is the source of your problems.
2010-01-24T19:45:00.000Z	beachbrake	tekkno	:) yes.
2010-01-24T19:45:00.000Z	tekkno		you can try do deinstall it, but dont expect everthing to run better after that ;)
2010-01-24T19:45:00.000Z	beachbrake	tekkno	why does pulseaudio have problems?
2010-01-24T19:45:00.000Z	tekkno	beachbrake	because it uses a huge amount of overhead instead of the core alsa interface
2010-01-24T19:45:00.000Z	tekkno		it emulates a "fake" alsa device
2010-01-24T19:45:00.000Z	beachbrake	tekkno	I tried installing ubuntu studio.
2010-01-24T19:46:00.000Z	tekkno		for legacy application which cant work with pulseaudio directly
2010-01-24T19:47:00.000Z	beachbrake	tekkno	fake?
2010-01-24T19:48:00.000Z	tekkno	beachbrake	fake = emulation. make old application think that they talk to alsa directly (which is not true, cause its first goes to the pulseaudio backend)
2010-01-24T19:48:00.000Z	beachbrake	tekkno	:) ah! are you an ubuntu dev?
2010-01-24T19:49:00.000Z	tekkno	beachbrake	nope, just someone how does more with music, and so i know the problems of pulseaudio ;)
