2009-01-09T08:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	a-t	If you shift ctrl V     that line into a terminal it will return a url with the info we need
2009-01-09T08:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	a-t	Just paste that line into a terminal
2009-01-09T08:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	a-t	It will do all the work
2009-01-09T08:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	a-t	Ok, so it isnt in there so we need to see what drive partition it is with..   sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && sudo fdisk -l > ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && lsb_release -a >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && cat /home/$USER/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
