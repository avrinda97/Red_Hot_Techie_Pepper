2005-12-17T09:26:00.000Z	jackal24		can someone please tell me why modprobe can't find ndiswrapper?
2005-12-17T09:26:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	can you find ndiswrapper?
2005-12-17T09:26:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	yes
2005-12-17T09:27:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	but i don't know what to do next
2005-12-17T09:27:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	and it's in the right place in /lib/?
2005-12-17T09:28:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	the ko file is in /usr/src/ndiswrapper-1.1/driver/
2005-12-17T09:28:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	...
2005-12-17T09:28:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	the ndiswrapper module is in ubuntu already, use that
2005-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	i don't know how. i was having problems with getting my wifi to work, so i read in a forum to delete ndiswrapper and reinstall it
2005-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToSetUpNdiswrapper
2005-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	ignore anything you read on the forums unless someone with clue outside the forums says it is correct
2005-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	i followed that whole wiki and it didn't work
2005-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	"didn't work" is not a useful description of the problem
2005-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	i could get ndiswrapper to install bcmwl5. The card showed in the network settings dialog and even showed the APs, but wouldn't connect...
2005-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	bob2	jackal24	ignore the network settings dialog
2005-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	the light for the card won't light up
2005-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	jackal24	bob2	what am i looking for in dmesg?
