2006-01-02T09:14:00.000Z	tonyms		I'm building the binutils package from the package source on Breezy,
2006-01-02T09:14:00.000Z	tonyms		         and notice binutils-2.16.1 has a gcc build-dep.  Could this build-dep
2006-01-02T09:14:00.000Z	tonyms		         not be on c-compiler instead?  I already had gcc-3.4 installed; would
2006-01-02T09:14:00.000Z	tonyms		         that not have been sufficient?  Should I submit a bug report?
2006-01-02T09:15:00.000Z	tonyms		Argh, sorry about that!

2006-01-02T09:15:00.000Z	tonyms		Sorry if this question is overly clueless or in the wrong channel; I'm new to ubuntu...
2006-01-02T09:16:00.000Z	Sepheebear	tonyms	try changing the build-dep in the debian/control file
2006-01-02T09:16:00.000Z	Sepheebear		once the mozilla-mplayer package is installed usually everything works
2006-01-02T09:16:00.000Z	tonyms	Sepheebear	sure, I can do that--should I open a bug report and attach a patch?
2006-01-02T09:17:00.000Z	tonyms	Sepheebear	get in touch with the package maintainer?  Other?
2006-01-02T09:17:00.000Z	Sepheebear	tonyms	that would be good, try man debdiff
2006-01-02T09:17:00.000Z	tonyms	Sepheebear	okay, cheers.
2006-01-02T09:17:00.000Z	Sepheebear		bug reports work best for me
2006-01-02T09:17:00.000Z	tonyms	Sepheebear	I'll do that.  Thanks very much!
