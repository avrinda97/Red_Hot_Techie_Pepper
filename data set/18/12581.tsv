2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 	preaction	how might I do that if you please?
2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	preaction		[Ag0ny] : you made a backup, right?
2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 		mmmm
2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 		no?
2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	preaction	killaz	when did you last try?
2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	preaction		[Ag0ny] : what kind of card?
2007-01-31T17:16:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 		intel 950
2007-01-31T17:16:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 		i have a dell e1505 notebook
2007-01-31T17:16:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 		don't cringe, it was free
2007-01-31T17:18:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 	preaction	is there a command for me to just revert? I did it graphically through KDE
2007-01-31T17:18:00.000Z	preaction		[Ag0ny] : i've never used KDE's graphical utility, but it sounds like a stupid thing. it probably made a backup for you. look in /etc/Xorg
2007-01-31T17:19:00.000Z	preaction	killaz	because WPA works with the gnome-network-manager? did you install wpa_supplicant (or whatever it's called)
2007-01-31T17:19:00.000Z	[Ag0ny] 		thanks I'll try that preaction, xdude I entered the display controls and set the hardware driver
2007-01-31T17:21:00.000Z	preaction		you don't configure wpa manually by editing wpa_supplicant, but rather the /etc/network-interfaces (i believe, there's a wiki article about it)
2007-01-31T17:22:00.000Z	preaction	killaz	i've also had problems with certain linksys routers and WPA - shared key
