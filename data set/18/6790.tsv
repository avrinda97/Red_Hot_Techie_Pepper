2008-03-25T06:16:00.000Z	Jon855		I've a real question...
2008-03-25T06:16:00.000Z	Jon855		My network set up is like this. And I would want my laptop to act as a dhcp server for internet sharing...
2008-03-25T06:17:00.000Z	Jon855		Wifi -> Laptop -> Switch -> Computers.
2008-03-25T06:17:00.000Z	Jon855		how would I go about this?
2008-03-25T06:18:00.000Z	Jon855		anybody mind telling me the differences between ath0 and wifi0 ?
2008-03-25T06:19:00.000Z	Jon855		Okay. i'm just trying to get my internet to be shared over to my desktop
2008-03-25T06:20:00.000Z	Jon855		Nobody?
2008-03-25T06:21:00.000Z	Jon855		I thought I had explained it.
2008-03-25T06:21:00.000Z	Jon855		Wifi -> Laptop -> Switch -> Computers.

2008-03-25T06:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	are you saying you don't have internet access on the laptop but you do on the desktop machines.. and you want wireless to work on the lappy?
2008-03-25T06:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	yea.. I just read your post before mine just before hitting the enter key... sorry I don't know how to setup DHCP on Ubuntu
2008-03-25T06:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	In thinking about it wouldn't that require 2 nic cards.. in your case one wireless and one hardwired?  If so do you want to provide dhcp via wireless to the other machines? or via the hardwire?
2008-03-25T06:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	that was my point.. ok.. have you checked this out? http://ubuntulinuxhowto.blogspot.com/2006/06/setup-your-computer-to-be-router.html
2008-03-25T06:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	looks like that might point you in the right direction
2008-03-25T06:29:00.000Z	Jon855	Scunizi	I will try  this, thanks
2008-03-25T06:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	np I hope it works.. little things can be quite a dilema sometimes.
2008-03-25T06:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	Jon855	you can actually have both on the sys at the same time and choose what you want at logon with sessions
