2005-09-29T12:45:00.000Z	vbgunz		I have a question regarding Ubuntu backports... Does Breezy come with backports already enabled?
2005-09-29T12:46:00.000Z	vbgunz		there is no dvd decrypter for Linux :(
2005-09-29T12:47:00.000Z	vbgunz		does Breezy come with backports already enabled?
2005-09-29T12:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	no, but as of colony 5 they are in the sources.list
2005-09-29T13:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	the three menus at the top are more or less the same thing
2005-10-02T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	I always used kgpg
2005-10-02T10:37:00.000Z	vbgunz	Amaranth	I understand kgpg is built for KDE... *but* I think I understand anything made for KDE could still work on GNOME and without much problem *or* is it simlpe recommended I get the GNOME support version?
2005-10-02T10:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	it works fine in GNOME
2005-10-02T10:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	it even minimizes to the notification area (system tray)
2005-10-25T09:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	in order to select your entire home folder minus one you need to list all the other folders in the tar command
2005-10-25T09:52:00.000Z	vbgunz	Amaranth	on the command line I would have to list all 40 folders - the one I don't want?
2005-10-25T09:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	yep
2005-11-27T15:41:00.000Z	vbgunz	Amaranth	yeah... you see why command line is better ;)
2005-12-05T10:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/tips#app_icon
2005-12-05T10:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	vbgunz	It's for windows but it should work on linux, just change the paths.
2005-12-05T10:42:00.000Z	vbgunz	Amaranth	thanks, looking now!
2005-12-05T10:44:00.000Z	vbgunz	Amaranth	I think you hit it right on the head!
2005-12-05T10:44:00.000Z	vbgunz	Amaranth	I found that ugly globe... am going to murder it now...
