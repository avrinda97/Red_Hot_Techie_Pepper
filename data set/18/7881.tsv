2007-10-31T21:35:00.000Z	uu8		were not met:" which package does x.org need ?
2007-10-31T21:37:00.000Z	void^	uu8	perhaps libxv-dev, the documentation for the software you're trying to compile should come with a list of dependencies.
2007-10-31T21:37:00.000Z	uu8		thanks void^ i'll try that and report back
2007-10-31T21:53:00.000Z	uu8	void^	now iam stuck at the following error, gutsy does not have these package versions, shat to do ?

2007-10-31T21:57:00.000Z	void^	uu8	it has all those packages. run a few searches in apt/synaptics/whatever.
2007-10-31T21:58:00.000Z	uu8	void^	further i get these version related errors
2007-10-31T21:58:00.000Z	uu8		Requested 'renderproto >= 0.9.3' but version of RenderProto is 0.9.2
2007-10-31T21:58:00.000Z	uu8		Requested 'pixman-1 >= 0.9.5' but version of Pixman is 0.9.4
2007-10-31T22:01:00.000Z	void^	uu8	use a slightly older source package for whatever you're trying to compile.
2007-10-31T22:03:00.000Z	uu8	void^	trying to build xorg module (kdrive, Xephyr with evdev) , xorg mailing list told me to get from git, git has latest version, what to do, gutsy does not have evdev kdrive extensions that i need to use gutsy.
2007-10-31T22:04:00.000Z	void^	uu8	if you want to build an xorg module from git you'll likely have to build your entire xorg
2007-10-31T22:05:00.000Z	uu8	void^	i dont want to build anything, but gutsy "didn't packed the last kdrive tree with evdev", what are my options then ?
2007-10-31T22:10:00.000Z	void^	uu8	if you want the latest git/cvs version of some software you either build it yourself or find binaries. it's rather unusual to actually need such current versions.
2007-10-31T22:13:00.000Z	uu8	void^	i agree with you, i should not need to, but they left the kdrive/evdev out of the build in gutsy, in order to get that on gutsy, i am trying all solutions, is there a way, that xorg module will build with lower versions of the software that its complaining about (ala --force etc)?
2007-10-31T22:59:00.000Z	uu8	void^	kthx, bai
2007-10-31T22:59:00.000Z	uu8	void^	kthx, bai
