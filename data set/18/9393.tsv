2007-05-20T10:00:00.000Z	deCon		i need to print a pdf, but i dont have reader....but i can read pdfs???
2007-05-20T10:01:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	you'll probably find the built in pdf reader Evince is letting you view them - should be able to print them too
2007-05-20T10:02:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	for some reason it won't let me
2007-05-20T10:02:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	any chance that the PDF has been secured against printing? I know the latest versions of adobe can do that
2007-05-20T10:03:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	its in document viewer, i dont think adobe is installed yet
2007-05-20T10:05:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	I you said that the pdf is opening in document viewer? Click File - Properties and see if it has security on the pdf
2007-05-20T10:07:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	sure doesn't. It allows me to print to file, but when i select the printer i just installed...it doesn't allow the print button
2007-05-20T10:08:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	you could try using xpdf instead
2007-05-20T10:08:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	how to install?
2007-05-20T10:08:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	apt-get install xpdf
2007-05-20T10:08:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	thanks
2007-05-20T10:09:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	have you managed to print anything else to the printer? maybe something like a plain text document? Just to verify that the printer is set up correctly
2007-05-20T10:11:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	that is the problem, it won't let me print to anything. It will print a test page though...???
2007-05-20T10:17:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	if you can't print to the printer from more than one application (say gedit and Evince Document Viewer both) then I'd say there's something wrong with the printer setup.
2007-05-20T10:18:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	i'm at linuxprinting.org, but it doesn't seem to help me, i dont think i have installed correctly...can you help or send me somewhere that can better walk through
2007-05-20T10:29:00.000Z	gryph76	deCon	it looks like one or two others have run into the same problems with that printer - closest I've come to finding a solution is here: http://forums.freestandards.org/read.php?25,1671,1671
2007-05-20T10:29:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	thanks, ill check it out
2007-05-20T10:51:00.000Z	deCon	gryph76	fixed it...thank you! i've been trying to get this working for a couple months...now onto samba!
