2008-02-03T06:47:00.000Z	rainwalker		is PCRE in the repos?
2008-02-03T06:47:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	apt-cache search PCRE
2008-02-03T06:48:00.000Z	rainwalker	gmcastil	it listed a lot of things, how do I know what to install?
2008-02-03T06:48:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	pastebin the output...why do you need PCRE?
2008-02-03T06:48:00.000Z	rainwalker	gmcastil	I'm compiling a plugin for pidgin that says what you're listening to
2008-02-03T06:49:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	ah...yeah, that'd explain it...and yeah, that is kinda cool :)
2008-02-03T06:49:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	pastebin your output, and i'll take a look at it
2008-02-03T06:50:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	is the configure script giving you an error?
2008-02-03T06:50:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	that's hot....
2008-02-03T06:50:00.000Z	rainwalker	gmcastil	yes
2008-02-03T06:50:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	what error is ./configure giving you?
2008-02-03T06:51:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	sudo apt-get install pcregrep
2008-02-03T06:51:00.000Z	rainwalker	gmcastil	ok I saw that in synaptic but wasn't sure that's what I needed, thanks =)
2008-02-03T06:51:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	that last one is the dealio, i'd imagine - if it has any dependancies, it'l probably resolve automagically
2008-02-03T06:51:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	yup, np
2008-02-03T06:53:00.000Z	gmcastil	rainwalker	did configure pass through it?
2008-02-03T06:59:00.000Z	rainwalker	gmcastil	it didn't work
2008-02-03T07:01:00.000Z	rainwalker	gmcastil	should I just compile pcre myself?
