2008-01-12T10:48:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	what do you mean by stuck?
2008-01-12T10:51:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	can you press CTRL+ALT+F1?
2008-01-12T10:52:00.000Z	FYI	evil_tech	what does that do? (I've been removed from linux for a few years and don't remember that at all)
2008-01-12T10:52:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	will display kernel messages
2008-01-12T10:59:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	any thing other than bios bug #81?
2008-01-12T11:00:00.000Z	FYI	evil_tech	nope.... just goes to a blank (looks like the lcd is producing black) screen
2008-01-12T11:00:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	tried safe graphics mode?
2008-01-12T11:01:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	what are the specs on this laptop
2008-01-12T11:02:00.000Z	FYI	evil_tech	I just googled that also ... It appears people have been having trouble w/ the same 'series' (compaq f500)... amd 64 x2 tk-53, 1gb ram, nvidia stuff, broadcom wireless
2008-01-12T11:05:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	are you trying to install via the live cd or just play with the live cd?
2008-01-12T11:06:00.000Z	FYI	evil_tech	I'm trying to install now
2008-01-12T11:07:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	you could always try the alternate install if you cant get the live to go
2008-01-12T11:08:00.000Z	FYI	evil_tech	should I be using the 64 bit version (I have an AMD 64 x2 TK-53)?
2008-01-12T11:08:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	i'd stick with the i386
2008-01-12T11:58:00.000Z	evil_tech	FYI	the alternate installer should not have a start in safe graphics mode
