2010-01-26T21:48:00.000Z	sl00		Hi. I had problems with my mobile broadband modem (huawei e1750) but I solved it with usb_modeswitch and a udev rule so now it connects but.... my /etc/resolv.conf is empty. How do I fis that?
2010-01-26T21:48:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	you can add manually
2010-01-26T21:49:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	add "nameserver 208.67.222.222" to your resolve.conf
2010-01-26T21:49:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Well... I do not know what to add?!
2010-01-26T21:49:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Hm... what nameserver is that?
2010-01-26T21:50:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	OpenDNS , you can use 8.8.8.8 (Google Public Dns)
2010-01-26T21:50:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Okey.. but will not NetworkManager overwrite that file if I add another connection?
2010-01-26T21:50:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	I would really want it to do this automaticly :/
2010-01-26T21:51:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	It will, in Dial connection, you can setup DNS to be used as default
2010-01-26T21:51:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	inside network manager -> dial -> choose your connection -> edit -> IPV4 Config -> choose only automatic address -> add DNS and done
2010-01-26T21:51:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Ah I see.
2010-01-26T21:52:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Do you know what delimiter to use if I want more than one (just curious)?
2010-01-26T21:52:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	you can use "," not point, "," I don't know how to say in english, comma I guess
2010-01-26T21:53:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Great. Thanks!
2010-01-26T21:53:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	yw
2010-01-26T21:53:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	sl00	its comma? in English? in pt_BR its Virgula
2010-01-26T21:54:00.000Z	sl00	AndreMorro[BR]	Yeah.. comma :)
