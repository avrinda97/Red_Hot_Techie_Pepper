2010-07-15T23:29:00.000Z	Buttons840		how does set differ from export?
2010-07-15T23:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	ask in #bash
2010-09-10T02:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	sleep [seconds] && command
2010-09-10T02:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	or use "at"
2010-09-10T02:33:00.000Z	Buttons840	erUSUL	thank you, i'm looking at that "at" command; does this make any long term changes, (chron schedule or anything?) or will all changes be lost when terminal closes?
2010-09-10T02:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	at will run the command no matter th terminal.
2010-09-10T02:34:00.000Z	Buttons840	erUSUL	even after a reboot?
2010-09-10T02:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	i think so yes. you want that to be a "once" operation or a periodic thing? if it is periodic you want "cron" not "at"
2010-11-16T04:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	it may be a zombie or a process stuck in D state ... so rebooting is the only way
2010-11-16T04:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	sometimes killing the parent process helps
2010-11-16T04:34:00.000Z	Buttons840	erUSUL	the parent is process 1 i believe?
2010-11-16T04:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	then thats' no solution :)
2010-11-16T04:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	someone i said the same here actually killed init
2010-11-16T04:35:00.000Z	Buttons840	erUSUL	maybe jackd just wont work on this computer; but it often locks up and rebooting isn't a very timely solution every time
2010-11-16T04:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	probably sound driver bug ( or jack ) tried installing alsa backports modules?
2010-11-16T04:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	linux-backports-modules-alsa-lucid-generic ( or maverick )
2010-11-16T04:39:00.000Z	Buttons840	erUSUL	why do i use the backports?
2010-11-16T04:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Buttons840	to get newer sound drivers. it may help ( or may not ) worth a try. easy to install/uninstall
