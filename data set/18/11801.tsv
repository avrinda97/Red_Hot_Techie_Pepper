2006-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	jrib	freakabcd	microsoft is taking over your connection!  I don't that's really strange

2006-10-05T10:39:00.000Z	freakabcd	jrib	dude. i'm at uni!!
2006-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	jrib	freakabcd	it's in edgy
2006-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	freakabcd	jrib	and i can;t install that deb on dapper can i? without updating a bunch of other stuff
2006-10-05T10:51:00.000Z	jrib	freakabcd	well you could try to rebuild it on dapper.  I think seveas' repos has packages for vim7 on dapper.  But edgy will be out by the end of the month if you want to just wait
2006-10-05T10:51:00.000Z	freakabcd	jrib	end of this month?
2006-10-05T10:51:00.000Z	jrib	freakabcd	release every 6 months
2011-02-18T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	freakabcd	if for some reason you don't want to use ppa-purge, read its source and do what it does yourself (its less than 200 lines in bash).  You can also mess with pinning
