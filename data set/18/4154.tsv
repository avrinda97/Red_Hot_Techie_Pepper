2009-11-04T12:03:00.000Z	user101	MikeChelen	: It is like this from time i added options snd-hda-intel model=basic to alsa-base.conf
2009-11-04T12:05:00.000Z	MikeChelen	user101	why did you need to modify that file?
2009-11-04T12:05:00.000Z	user101	MikeChelen	to get surround sound.
2009-11-04T12:06:00.000Z	MikeChelen	user101	oh, is that digital output? maybe it needs to be switched to analog for the headphones
2009-11-04T12:07:00.000Z	user101	MikeChelen	every time??
2009-11-04T12:07:00.000Z	MikeChelen	user101	just to see if it works, there might be a better way
2009-11-04T12:09:00.000Z	user101	MikeChelen	nothing comes if i change connector output to analog headphones
2009-11-04T12:13:00.000Z	user101	MikeChelen	more fun is if i connect jack it plays in both headphone and speaker.
