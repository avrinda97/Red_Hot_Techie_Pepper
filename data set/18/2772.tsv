2011-05-07T09:57:00.000Z	K`zan		Hi all, upgraded my netbook to 11.04 (finally finished just a bit ago).  Problem is I have no menu or status bar, had to ctl-alt-del to get out of the gnome session.
2011-05-07T09:58:00.000Z	K`zan		Is there some what to get the menu back?
2011-05-07T09:59:00.000Z	K`zan		s/what/way/
2011-05-07T10:00:00.000Z	K`zan		Does unity not have a menu or anything?
2011-05-07T10:01:00.000Z	rzx237	K`zan	try deleting .config, .gnome in your home folder, sometime old configuration break when using new version of software, and login back
2011-05-07T10:02:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	Will try that, hopefully it works on a netbook :).  Thanks MUCH!
2011-05-07T10:04:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	got .config had no .gnome, retrying now!
2011-05-07T10:04:00.000Z	rzx237	K`zan	.config and .gnome, I mean
2011-05-07T10:05:00.000Z	rzx237	K`zan	you may want to back it up somewhere
2011-05-07T10:05:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	No .gnome :)
2011-05-07T10:05:00.000Z	K`zan		Too late :-/.
2011-05-07T10:05:00.000Z	rzx237		okay, .config
2011-05-07T10:06:00.000Z	rzx237	K`zan	and login back, so you now starting with empy config
2011-05-07T10:06:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	Did so, same reboot to get out.
2011-05-07T10:07:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	Used "gnome".  Will try "gnome classic" this time.
2011-05-07T10:07:00.000Z	K`zan		err "ubuntu ..."
2011-05-07T10:08:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	Used "ubuntu classic" and that worked!
2011-05-07T10:09:00.000Z	K`zan	rzx237	Thanks much for the help.  First time a dist upgrade that I have done worked :)!!!
