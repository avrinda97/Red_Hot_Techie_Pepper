2011-05-12T06:41:00.000Z	spl0it		Maybe if I simplify the question it will be easier: How do I bring focus to an application currently running in the background?
2011-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	I use win-tab for window switching with graphical apps... not sure if that helps
2011-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	alt-tab is the less fancy version of that win-tab
2011-05-12T06:44:00.000Z	spl0it	DaveD0101	yes, unfortunately it's not listed there...before the new version of ubuntu a small logo would show up near the block...but now - nothing
2011-05-12T06:44:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	oh in the notificaion area?  Sure the process is running?
2011-05-12T06:45:00.000Z	spl0it		Dave123: ps aux | grep truecrypt shows it running, and if I click on the icon it says 'TrueCrypt is already running'
2011-05-12T06:45:00.000Z	spl0it	DaveD0101	ps aux | grep truecrypt shows it running, and if I click on the icon it says 'TrueCrypt is already running'
2011-05-12T06:50:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	You got me... not sure how you'd get it back if it's not in the systray, won't allow you to relaunch the GUI and killing and restarting the process isn't an option...
2011-05-12T06:50:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	Though I'd guess there's a way.  I just don't know it.
2011-05-12T06:51:00.000Z	spl0it	DaveD0101	yeah I figure someone knows how to access a running application that's in the background (not a shell APP!)
2011-05-12T06:55:00.000Z	spl0it	DaveD0101	found a 'workaround' truecrypt -d = unmounted all current mounts
2011-05-12T06:55:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	then just killing and relaunching?

2011-05-12T06:57:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	wmctrl -a <name>
2011-05-12T06:57:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	I had to install wmctrl first though.
2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z	spl0it	DaveD0101	thanks - I'm not sure why this is necessary in the first place... wonder why the system tray doesn't work properly
2011-05-12T07:02:00.000Z	spl0it	DaveD0101	thanks again for the help - have a good one - must sleep now
2011-05-12T07:02:00.000Z	DaveD0101	spl0it	Np.
