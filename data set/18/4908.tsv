2009-09-01T19:15:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	thank you :-)
2009-09-01T19:17:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	of course, you can always try another window manager. i just kind of dealt with it on gnome/compiz
2010-04-26T20:36:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	ctrl-alt-minus does nothing, i take it?
2010-04-26T20:36:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	it zooms out or changes resolutions, but it doesnt reenable the monitor
2010-04-26T20:37:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	this isn't a CRT, right?
2010-04-26T20:37:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	nope, two lcds. an nvidia card. Usually extend the desktop across them
2010-04-26T20:38:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	logging out and in again doesn't help?
2010-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	it might.... there's an application I'm having trouble saving without being able to reenable the other monitor
2010-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	also, you might try running the nvidia control utility.
2010-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	running the nvidia control utility doesn't help, however
2010-04-26T20:41:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	alright, enough playing with nvidia control panel fixed it. thanks
2010-04-26T20:41:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	out of curiosity, what did you have to change?
2010-04-26T20:42:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	I had to manually disable twinview, and reenable it for the second monitor
2010-10-20T18:20:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	mdadm.conf should use UUIDs, and shouldn't care what the device is called (ideally)
2010-10-20T18:21:00.000Z	Travis-42	sipior	OK, I wasn't sure, since you specify the /dev location when creating the array. thanks
2010-10-20T18:21:00.000Z	sipior	Travis-42	yeah, i'm fairly sure those are mapped to UUIDs at array creation. easy to double-check, though.
