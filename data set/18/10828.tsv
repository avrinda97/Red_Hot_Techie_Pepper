2007-09-17T10:01:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	I recommed you using the lattest version of Ubuntu. There has been some improvements in the printing system since Dapper.
2007-09-17T10:03:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	sure https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
2007-09-17T10:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	it depends on the speed of your internet connection, in order to download the needed files.
2007-09-17T10:07:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	you can burn a Alternate CD to do the upgrade from the CD. It will save some disk space. How much free space do you have ?
2007-09-17T10:08:00.000Z	iammisc	KurtKraut	also, can I be sure edgy will work on my system?
2007-09-17T10:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	probably yes, since it is an improvement from Dapper. You may run it from a LiveCD to check for specific compability. But Edgy is not the latest version, the latest is Feisty (7.04).
2007-09-17T10:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	another version will be released within a month, it is called Gutsy (7.10)
2007-09-17T10:15:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	you'll probably have to download around 700mb of files. If you have more than 1gHz of processor and 256mb of RAM, after the dowload things should be installed withing an hour.
2007-09-17T10:15:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	don't forget to make backup of your personal files before trying an upgrade
2007-09-17T10:16:00.000Z	iammisc	KurtKraut	could it corrupt the hard disk?
2007-09-17T10:16:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	corrupt the disk ? No, but it can lead to an unstable install if something goes wrong, requiring a new fresh instal. But it quite rare.
2007-09-17T10:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	that's why backuping is always necessary
2007-09-17T10:17:00.000Z	iammisc	KurtKraut	but if i dual-boot windows then i'll just take my files from there
2007-09-17T10:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	other partitions and OSes should not be affected by any error.
2007-09-17T10:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	yes
2007-09-17T10:18:00.000Z	KurtKraut	iammisc	yes. This is an important task. Is requirable as much condoms for sex :P
