2011-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev		I migrated from Debian tonight. Then I copied lots of folders from old /home/user. I only could do this as superuser. Now all my folders belong to root. How can I make all of them, including subfolders, belong to me, a normal user?
2011-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev		Someone help me please?
2011-10-27T04:00:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	chown -R username:username BUT since you didn't do the original copy correctly most likely all the permissions are wrong, so things like .ssh will have the wrong permissions if you do this
2011-10-27T04:02:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	thank you. So I get on the folder via terminal and type chown -R username:username (same username twice, right?)
2011-10-27T04:04:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	chown -R u:u /home/u. yes. the u after the : is the group. most files are owned by you and the group is your group. however the permissions on things like .ssh/id_rsa may be wrong
2011-10-27T04:05:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	thank you. I'm doing it
2011-10-27T04:14:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	it worked! I'd never do it that fast, thanks a lot! :)
2011-10-27T04:15:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	id still be worried about your permissions. if you dont tell cp to preserve the owner permissions they could be all wrong
2011-10-27T04:16:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	even not having .ssh files?
2011-10-27T04:16:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	i would audit your permissions. you'll want to use find to figure out how things are permissioned
2011-10-27T04:17:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	when you cped and lost your ownership you probably changed the rwx bits. so you need to verify that nothing secret has been exposed
2011-10-27T04:20:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	It's only my wife and I that use this computer. She has hers own, so almost never she uses mine. I don't have anything here to hide from her. You mean exposure for local users or the internet?
2011-10-27T04:22:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	for local users mostly, but you should be sure to use cp -a next time
2011-10-27T04:23:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	also some programs will refuse to work if secret data is not permissioned correctly. examples would be the .ssh/authorized_keys file will be ignored if it is not permissioned correctly
2011-10-27T04:24:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	is there some simple document on the web explaining these terminal command lines? And about Ubuntu, do you know some webpage to increase productivity?
2011-10-27T04:25:00.000Z	escott	douglas-web-dev	and the most useful book is probably unix in a nutshell
2011-10-27T04:25:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	thank you for the advices
2011-10-27T04:26:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev	escott	Cool! I saved the book name :)
