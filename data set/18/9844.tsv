2007-02-15T12:40:00.000Z	Kelbizzle		so I'm trying to mount my reiserfs partition. It mounts to /mnt/hdb anyone know why I don't have write permissions to it?
2007-02-15T12:41:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	who owns /mnt/hdb
2007-02-15T12:41:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	root
2007-02-15T12:41:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	might try # chmod 777 /mnt/hdb
2007-02-15T12:49:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	 thanks setting it to 777 worked.
2007-02-15T12:49:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	awesome :)
2007-02-15T12:49:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	now to get it showing on the dekstop.
2007-02-15T12:50:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	browse to /mnt/name an create a link :)
2007-02-15T12:51:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	links don't look pretty. I want it to look like when I connect my usb drive.
2007-02-15T12:53:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	what type of mount is it?
2007-02-15T12:53:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	what the partition? what do you mean what type of mount
2007-02-15T12:54:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	ah, just a partition
2007-02-15T12:54:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	it's a second drive
2007-02-15T12:55:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	I'm sure there is a way to do it.. I'm not 100% certain how, your wanting a drive icon, like when you insert a CDrom an an icon pops up
2007-02-15T12:56:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	yea like macos x shows the mounted drives on the desktop. or if I connect my thumbdrive it shows on the desktop.
2007-02-15T12:59:00.000Z	royel	Kelbizzle	maybe ask in here again.. an let me know what you find out :)
2007-02-15T12:59:00.000Z	Kelbizzle	royel	 no problem.
