2012-10-05T12:50:00.000Z	schmo7000		so I don't know what path it's using for md5. It's something to do with how it accesses media mounts I guess.
2012-10-05T12:51:00.000Z	schmo7000		oh.
2012-10-05T12:53:00.000Z	schmo7000		oh.
2012-10-05T12:53:00.000Z	schmo7000		I figured it out.
2012-10-05T12:53:00.000Z	schmo7000		It puts %20 in the spaces in the pathname.
2012-10-05T12:54:00.000Z	schmo7000		So, like, if your CD is /media/Metallica is cool/Metallicachick.png it will md5 file:///media/Metallica%20is%20cool/Metallicachick.png and store the hash of this path in ~/.thumbnails/normal
2012-10-05T12:55:00.000Z	schmo7000		I have a feeling nobody else will ever have this question.
2012-10-05T12:56:00.000Z	schmo7000		I think it runs it through an escaping function call.
2012-10-05T12:57:00.000Z	schmo7000		It would be helpful to know which one it is.
2012-10-05T12:57:00.000Z	schmo7000		Probably something like thumbnail(md5(escape_uri(my_uri)))
2012-10-05T12:58:00.000Z	geirha	schmo7000	I'm not sure what nautilus thumbnails is, but typically, for a launcher, %u will result in a url (which gui applications typically groks), and %f will result in a filename (that command-line tools can grok)
2012-10-05T12:58:00.000Z	schmo7000	geirha	what accepts this %u parameter?
2012-10-05T12:59:00.000Z	schmo7000		Oh. printf?
2012-10-05T12:59:00.000Z	geirha	schmo7000	No, launchers (.desktop-files)
2012-10-05T13:00:00.000Z	geirha	schmo7000	I don't know if that's used for your case though
2012-10-05T13:02:00.000Z	geirha	schmo7000	At any rate, the best solution is to find a way to send your command a filename instead of an url in the first place. Converting an url back into a filename is very cumbersome
2012-10-05T13:03:00.000Z	schmo7000		hmm.
2012-10-05T13:06:00.000Z	schmo7000	geirha	it seems that when you create a shortcut using nautilus it stores a uri.
