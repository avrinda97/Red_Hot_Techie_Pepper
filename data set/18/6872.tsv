2008-03-11T23:48:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	what's the problem?
2008-03-11T23:49:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	I had it up and working yesterday but then my network went down and now there's no route to host.
2008-03-11T23:50:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	no route to host? that may not be nfs related... are you able to ping the host?
2008-03-11T23:51:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	I just found my problem. The IP changed from .106 to .102 for some reason.
2008-03-11T23:51:00.000Z	Barko		Is there anyway to have it adapt or no?
2008-03-11T23:51:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	Only if you can refer to it by hostname. Do you have an internal DNS server?
2008-03-11T23:52:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	I'm not sure. I'm only mounting a directory from another computer.
2008-03-11T23:52:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	Probably not then. If you control the DHCP server, you could create a reservation for you NFS server so it always gets the same IP address.
2008-03-11T23:53:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	Okay, I'll try working on the hostname then.
2008-03-11T23:55:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	I tried to unmount using the hostname but it won't work.
2008-03-11T23:57:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	Then you'll have to go by IP address. You could possibly setup a local DNS server, but it probably wouldn't be worth the effort unless this happens regularly.
2008-03-11T23:57:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	the router craps out every few weeks at random
2008-03-11T23:58:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	what kind of router is it?
2008-03-11T23:58:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	linksys
2008-03-11T23:58:00.000Z	ks3	Barko	if it'll run dd-wrt, you may want to look at that. http://www.dd-wrt.com
2008-03-11T23:59:00.000Z	Barko	ks3	Okay, thanks.
