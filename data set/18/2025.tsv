2010-09-10T06:23:00.000Z	diverted		can someone with a lot of patience help me install a program?
2010-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	diverted		the program comes in tar.gz but i dont know how to run it
2010-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	diverted	you need to extract the program from the tar.gz file.  tar -zxf tarname.tar.gz
2010-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	i already did that. i put it into /usr/local/src
2010-09-10T06:26:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	then i tried to run "sudo make install but i dont know how to run the program now"
2010-09-10T06:26:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	im not even sure if i actually installed it that way
2010-09-10T06:26:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	how can i check if i installed the program correctly?
2010-09-10T06:27:00.000Z	dsnyders	diverted	It's been a while.  I usually apt-get install things.  What is the program?
2010-09-10T06:27:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	its nothing from official repositories
2010-09-10T06:28:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	i got it from that link: http://draves.org/bomb/bomb-1.26.tar.gz
2010-09-10T06:28:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	if i navigate into the extracted folder and type "checkinstall" i only get some basic text
2010-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	diverted	is there a file called bomb in the folder?
2010-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	wohooo i think i got it!!
2010-09-10T06:31:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	i got the deb file now and i already installed it!
2010-09-10T06:31:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	but what next? how do i execute it?
2010-09-10T06:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	diverted	not sure.  is there a file called bomb in the folder?
2010-09-10T06:33:00.000Z	diverted	dsnyders	yes but when i click on it nothing happens
