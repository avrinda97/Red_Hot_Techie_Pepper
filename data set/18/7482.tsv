2008-01-04T05:48:00.000Z	jakel1		i know this is a ubuntu channel.... but thought i might ask seeing as i am waiting for my ubuntu machine.  I am currently using openSUSE, and i have a .dmg image i need to burn i was wondering if anyone knew of a tool i could use to burn a .dmg to a CD
2008-01-04T05:48:00.000Z	jakel1		or well DVD
2008-01-04T05:49:00.000Z	jakel1		.dmg is what mac OS X uses for disk images
2008-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	jakel1		so sheesh
2008-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	nickrud	jakel1	that's less than an hour ....
2008-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	jakel1	nickrud	i am on EST
2008-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	nickrud	jakel1	oh, now if it was gmt I'd really be impressed ;P
2008-01-05T01:51:00.000Z	nickrud	jakel1	look for the #begin debian automatic kernel (or similar) in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file, and move the windows stanza above it
2008-01-05T01:53:00.000Z	nickrud	jakel1	you might end up with two listings, one at bottom and one at top, but what the hey :)
2008-01-07T23:30:00.000Z	nickrud	jakel1	not an answer, but a pointer: if the user has no write privs to the system, you could run find on his home and remove everything after a certain date
2008-01-07T23:31:00.000Z	jakel1	nickrud	good thought, but this is for a school and students need to have access to write files and make installations
2008-01-07T23:32:00.000Z	nickrud	jakel1	maybe you can ask on edubuntu, it's for the educational version of ubuntu, maybe they know that use case
