2006-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	Hello
2006-06-09T07:32:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	alrite.. will have a look there..
2006-06-09T07:33:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	hm... that's just installing from a cd though... I upgraded through the update manager
2006-06-09T07:34:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	I tried updating from the manager and it didn't work.
2006-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	The best thing to do is to do a full install from the Dapper CD
2006-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	ah alright...
2006-06-09T07:36:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	Make sure you backup all your data first
2006-06-09T07:36:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	I would have tried that too if it wasn't for the fact that my CD is broken :( (hardware failure, not ubuntu's fault)
2006-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	guess I have to get a new CD player
2006-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	Can you get a new CD?  You can download it or get it shipped to you for free
2006-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	Oh, its you drive?
2006-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	I mean... yeah.. the drive is broken...
2006-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	hm could I write the live CD to a partition on my harddisk and boot from it you think?
2006-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	go to http://www.tigerdirect.com and you can get a new drive for $15 - $20.
2006-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	I'm not sure, I thought of that too
2006-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	igge	webdesigner	yeah I should probably get a new drive.. will probably take less time than figuring out how to get the live cd on to the harddisk
2006-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	webdesigner	igge	Yah it would
