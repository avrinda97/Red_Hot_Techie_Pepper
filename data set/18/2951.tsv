2012-01-23T04:24:00.000Z	phong_		i hate to enter password after screen out
2012-01-23T04:24:00.000Z	phong_		can someone tell me how to turn off screen always stay on?
2012-01-23T04:24:00.000Z	Guinness2702	phong_	look at power management settings and screensave settings
2012-01-23T04:24:00.000Z	phong_	Guinness2702	you meant the power supply?
2012-01-23T04:25:00.000Z	Guinness2702	phong_	now, "power management" it used to be off System->Preferences->Power Management, but I don't know how the unity interface does it

2012-01-23T04:25:00.000Z	phong_		thanks
2012-01-23T04:26:00.000Z	Guinness2702	phong_	but the password thing I think is done off screensaver settings
