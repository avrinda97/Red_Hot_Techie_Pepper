2009-09-03T19:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	you should be using /usr/local instead of /usr for things that are not managed by the package manager
2009-09-03T19:00:00.000Z	Beefcaked	lstarnes	yeah.... i kinda dont understand what you just said, sorry im just issuing the commands but i dont really know what they do
2009-09-03T19:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	it means that mkinstalldirs is not included in that program's sources
2009-09-03T19:12:00.000Z	Beefcaked	lstarnes	what can I do to make it work?
2009-09-03T19:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	report the issue to the developers of that program
2009-09-03T19:15:00.000Z	Beefcaked	lstarnes	its a driver im installing :s a ricoh webcam driver
2009-09-03T19:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	I think the package's name is subversion if it isn't svn
2009-09-03T19:26:00.000Z	Beefcaked	lstarnes	thanks grabbing it
2009-09-03T21:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	you need to load medibuntu's keys
2009-09-03T21:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get update
2009-09-07T01:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	system > administration > system monitor
2009-09-07T01:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	Beefcaked	no OS is like that, but some are closer than others
