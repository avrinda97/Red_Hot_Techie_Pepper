2009-11-03T11:51:00.000Z	mgmuscari		!hello | picasso_

2009-11-03T11:55:00.000Z	mgmuscari		thanks
2009-11-03T11:56:00.000Z	mgmuscari		ok... i have my /home, my package list, and my sources backed up. what am i missing...
2009-11-03T11:56:00.000Z	mgmuscari		... before i can go ahead and whomp my partition table and install windows 7 and 9.10
2009-11-03T11:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari		actually, yeah, what am i thinking, i have a bunch of config stuff for mpd and other things in there... thanks!
2009-11-03T11:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari		nah not important on my laptop
2009-11-03T11:58:00.000Z	mgmuscari		maybe i'll leave the lenovo service partition, i dunno
2009-11-03T11:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i hear ext4 has some stability issues with large files... i don't think i'll be going that route
2009-11-03T11:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari		also, i'm paranoid about encrypting things and losing the keys :/
2009-11-03T12:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mgmuscari	Ext4 has no problem with large files
2009-11-03T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mgmuscari	"mount -o loop file.iso /mountpoint" doesn't work?
2009-11-03T12:32:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Jordan_U	thanks, that worked for some reason, whereas none of the gdm-integrated utilities did
2009-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mgmuscari	np, would you mind filing a bug report about that if one hasn't been filed already?
2009-11-03T12:34:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Jordan_U	about the mounting of an iso? this is jaunty btw
2009-11-03T12:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mgmuscari	Yes
2010-05-16T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mgmuscari	Usually you just have to change settings in /etc/default/grub. You very rarely need to edit scripts in /etc/grub.d/
2010-05-16T09:04:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Jordan_U	good point - depends on what you're doing with it
