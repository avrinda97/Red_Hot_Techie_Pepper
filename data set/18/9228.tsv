2007-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	Bishy		hi anyone up to helping me install ubuntu? i'm fairly new to all this
2007-04-26T15:36:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Bishy	are you installing as a single boot, or you planning to do a multiboot?
2007-04-26T15:36:00.000Z	Bishy	therealnanotube	multiboot with vista x64 already on
2007-04-26T15:37:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Bishy	ah heh, that's a more complicated case. have you searched the google for ubuntu dual boot install howtos?
2007-04-26T15:38:00.000Z	Bishy	therealnanotube	pm
2007-04-26T15:39:00.000Z	Bishy	therealnanotube	sorry, yes i've checked google n stuff - i'm getting an error when i try and start - kernel panic

2007-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	Bishy	therealnanotube	tried that - same thing
2007-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Bishy	verify the iso checksum ? verify the cd burn (there's an option for that) ?

2007-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Bishy	ah. hmm... is it a feisty or a dapper?
2007-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	Bishy	therealnanotube	version 6.06
2007-04-26T15:44:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Bishy	ah, well, you could try getting v7.04, and see if that meets with more success?
2007-04-26T15:45:00.000Z	Bishy	therealnanotube	kk, i'll dl and try later
