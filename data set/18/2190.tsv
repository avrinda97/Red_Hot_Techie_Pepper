2011-01-20T08:13:00.000Z	CJ232		If my partitions are setup like [C:][D:][unalloted], can I move unalloted between C and D any way?
2011-01-20T08:15:00.000Z	CJ232		Anone know if I can move a non adjacent partition to next to it if there is another partiion in the way like | C: | D: | unalloted |?
2011-01-20T08:16:00.000Z	CJ232		How hard is it to "hop" paritions
2011-01-20T08:17:00.000Z	CJ232		yeah it jusrt moves it
2011-01-20T08:17:00.000Z	CJ232		not hops
2011-01-20T08:18:00.000Z	CJ232		I dont think
2011-01-20T08:18:00.000Z	CJ232		aycee what do you mean
2011-01-20T08:19:00.000Z	CJ232		and I can move the partition over with gparted ?
2011-01-20T08:20:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	you can mirrior the partition you want moved out of sequence, then after you verify its ok, you can remove the original
2011-01-20T08:21:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	i guess maybe we should ask why you think they need moved first?
2011-01-20T08:23:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	tell us what your trying to accomplish, maybe we can give you better answers
2011-01-20T08:27:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	unalloted space is just that unused, its not part of D:
2011-01-20T08:31:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	unalloted space is not part of a partition, hence its unalotted. If you want to use it the easy way would be grow D: into it
2011-01-20T08:33:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	are you running linux or windows or both?
2011-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	in in simple, which partition did you want bigger?
2011-01-20T08:36:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	ok then what you do is, you grow d into the unalocated space. when that is done, you drag the front edge of D and shrink it again, making a gap between C and D. When that finishes, you drag the back edge of C and give it the sapce you just made
2011-01-20T08:38:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	partition tools are free, but the average MS user isnt capable of using them without destroying the whole works.
2011-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	Wiesshund	CJ232	ive no idea what you just said
