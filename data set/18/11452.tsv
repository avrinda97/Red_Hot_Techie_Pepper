2006-07-26T16:54:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey I dont know I am new to linux and community
2006-07-26T16:55:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey do you mind if I explain what I am experiencing here?
2006-07-26T16:56:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey Well I read lots of Urdu webpages. Urdu is Pakistani language that uses arabic script and needs unicode fonts for Urdu to be installed and there are plenty of such fonts
2006-07-26T16:56:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey previously in breezy all I had to do was to copy paste fonts in .fonts or usr/share/fonts folder and fc-cache and firefox would display urdu pages correctltly
2006-07-26T16:57:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey with Dapper no matter how I paste fonts and where ever firefox doesn't recognize them and no other browser like epiphany or any other would recognize any of these fonts
2006-07-26T16:58:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey firefox on windows displays fonts correctly
2006-07-26T16:59:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey all browsers display such pages in other fonts like serif or ms fonts
2006-07-26T05:00:00.000Z	Noumaan		synnthjet I have read the guide you mentioned many times and followed each and every step mentioned there
2006-07-26T05:02:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey so what you suggest what should I do now? because the problem is with all browsers including epiphany and mozilla I guess there is something missing in ubuntu packages or gnome packages. Where should I go now?
2006-07-26T05:03:00.000Z	Noumaan		davey Do you think I should send him a private message?
2006-07-26T05:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Noumaan	what do you need?
2006-07-26T05:04:00.000Z	Noumaan	gnomefreak	 omg ok here is the problem any browsers in ubuntu doesn't render my urdu fonts properly. firefox in windows render the same correctly but in ubuntu it doesn't even recognize them
2006-07-26T05:05:00.000Z	Noumaan	gnomefreak	 not one font only i have used several urdu fonts including tahoma which is an ms font
2006-07-26T05:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Noumaan	please check out launchpad.net/bugs  i think i remember a few about that
2006-07-26T05:06:00.000Z	Noumaan	gnomefreak	 ok you mean I should file it as a bug?
2006-07-26T05:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Noumaan	there are already bugs on it iirc
