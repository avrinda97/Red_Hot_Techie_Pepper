2006-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	davidjohnston		so I have a few older boxes that I am debating installing Ubuntu server on....one would be a development server for my web projects in PHP or RoR, the other would be a subversion server
2006-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	davidjohnston		so do you all think I'm making the right decision on Ubuntu server for this
2006-07-02T13:50:00.000Z	davidjohnston		Anyone in here use Ubuntu Server??
2006-07-02T13:51:00.000Z	davidjohnston		i don't know...i'm just starting to look into Ubuntu...so probably
2006-07-02T13:51:00.000Z	davidjohnston		yea the server install cd
2006-07-02T13:51:00.000Z	davidjohnston		that's what I downloaded
2006-07-02T13:53:00.000Z	davidjohnston		healot:  do you think it is a good server system then...I couldn't find many details...does it use a gui
2006-07-02T13:53:00.000Z	davidjohnston		healot:  i don't have one...I just want opinions from people who use it
2006-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	davidjohnston		healot...that's what I thought and good with me
2006-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	EdLin	davidjohnston	if it's like Debian Stable it probably is an excellent server OS
2006-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	davidjohnston		Edlin:  yea that is what I was going with...i think I'm going to do an install tomorrow
2006-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	EdLin	davidjohnston	using Ubuntu rather than Debian will give you some nice things like PHP5 without using a third party repository.
2006-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	EdLin	davidjohnston	but otherwise I'd lean towards Debian
2006-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	davidjohnston		Edlin:  the other reason I was looking this direction
2006-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	davidjohnston		I want the PHP5 and such
2006-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	davidjohnston		i have used debian servers and don't care about the 3rd party repositories but still
2006-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	EdLin	davidjohnston	Ubuntu Dapper LTS has a long support cycle too, if that's an issue.
2006-07-02T13:56:00.000Z	davidjohnston	EdLin	 probably not too much but always nice to know
