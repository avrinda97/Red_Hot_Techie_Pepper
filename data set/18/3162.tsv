2009-12-09T07:03:00.000Z	jonz	con6	i don't use hotmail so i'm not sure. you may want to stay on here and see if an actual hotmail user gives you a more experienced answer. otherwise, you may be left with this solution (which honestly don't look difficult in the least, but it indicates that hotmail for some reason requires a different effor to setup with a desktop client)
