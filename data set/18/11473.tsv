2011-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	Are you not advising LILO then?
2011-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	indeed,  hardly any distro's do LILO by default anymore, which also means hardly anyone knows LILO
2011-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	some distro's still using the old nice old version of Grub, but later versions of Ubuntu that Grub 2 thing hmm
2011-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	Are you aware of my problem? Basically I am having trouble booting narwhal after the update I did. It seems to freeze and be stuck in an ubuntu loading menu :(.
2011-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	no, but i t just be an upgrade that went wrong
2011-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	^
2011-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	So how do I make an upgrade go wrong turned right?
2011-04-30T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	if you can't  boot up 11.04 after upgrading to it, maybe recovery mode from the boot loader can help some how, or just clean install
2011-04-30T08:52:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	dang. I was hoping not to do that. It sounds a little messy.
2011-04-30T08:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	well when it comes to re installing Linux distro's haveing a seperate /home really does help useually :)
2011-04-30T08:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	however in the case of Ubuntu,  I have always set that up on the install of Ubuntu, never afterwoulds, which is also possible
2011-04-30T08:53:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	I believe I did do that from reading a tutorial but I don't know what it xactly means. Is there anyway I can check?
2011-04-30T08:54:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	Is blurg bad or something lol?
2011-04-30T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	Blurg isn't reallyf or newbies, it's a new project, based on Grub 2,  so people can theme Grub better and such
2011-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	and things can mess up if you do it wrong or whatever
2011-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	stick with Grub
2011-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	casey	other boot loaders are quite pointless useualy now days
2011-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	casey	sebsebseb	yeah well i'm a newbie, so i'll trust you with that.
