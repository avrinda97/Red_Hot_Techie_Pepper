2008-12-02T18:41:00.000Z	alex_21		I can't use a front end theme manager, but I want to make my gdm login look like a Mac username - password style login. Can anyone walk me through set up via the command lne interface? I am blind, so help doing this visual stuff is appreciated greatly
2008-12-02T18:43:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> I can't, since I am blind
2008-12-02T18:43:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> CLI is the only way
2008-12-02T18:45:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> Yes, on a Mac, my native OS, but I maintain Ubuntu/Kbuntu/Xubuntu servers/desktops
2008-12-02T18:47:00.000Z	alex_21		<alex_21>: I need help in visually finding the right one that I need for this. Under OS X there is two logins, one with username and password text boxes and one with Icons. It is the first one I want

2008-12-02T18:49:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	that's what you already have by default...
2008-12-02T18:52:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	with icons, you mean?
2008-12-02T18:55:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	well, you _can_ design a custom login screen, or just use the default. which has two boxes, but not shown at the same time.
2008-12-02T18:55:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	configure the login screen in system>admin>login
2008-12-02T18:56:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	Maybe. In which case google is your friend.
2008-12-02T18:57:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	ok...
2008-12-02T18:59:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	I don't know, you'll have to look at the docs for that package.
2008-12-02T19:00:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	Yes
2008-12-02T19:03:00.000Z	lfaraone	alex_21	what is the command you are using?
