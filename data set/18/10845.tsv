2007-01-25T13:29:00.000Z	Atomiku		Odd... Ive added "deb http://kanotix.com/files/debian/ ./" to the etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-25T13:29:00.000Z	Atomiku		When I run apt-get install freenx, it says package not found
2007-01-25T13:29:00.000Z	TSWoodV	Atomiku	 Did you run "apt-get update" first?
2007-01-25T13:29:00.000Z	Atomiku		Nope, because i'm a noob ^_^;;
2007-01-25T13:30:00.000Z	Atomiku		Doing it now :p
2007-01-25T13:30:00.000Z	TSWoodV		LOL!
2007-01-25T13:30:00.000Z	Atomiku		Done it, Still getting E: Couldn't find package freenx
2007-01-25T13:31:00.000Z	TSWoodV	Atomiku	Try "apt-caceh search nx" and see what you get
2007-01-25T13:31:00.000Z	Atomiku	TSWoodV	Nothing in particular.
2007-01-25T13:32:00.000Z	TSWoodV		Atom-: Sorry - try "apt-cache search nx" - misspelled above.
2007-01-25T13:32:00.000Z	Atomiku		Yeah, I corrected that :-P
2007-01-25T13:32:00.000Z	TSWoodV	Atomiku	Then it seems that the entry in sources.list isn't where those packages reside.
2007-01-25T13:32:00.000Z	Atomiku		I've put it at the bottom
2007-01-25T13:33:00.000Z	Atomiku		When I did the update command, I believe I saw that deb entry I added
2007-01-25T13:33:00.000Z	Atomiku		Ahhh
2007-01-25T13:33:00.000Z	Atomiku		Failed to fetch http://kanotix.com/files/debian/./Packages.gz 404 Not Found
2007-01-25T13:33:00.000Z	Atomiku		Right... So lemme find a different tutorial.
2007-01-25T13:35:00.000Z	TSWoodV	Atomiku	kanotix is for all intents and purposes dead now anyway.
