2006-10-29T09:06:00.000Z	daftvader		I cannot get my smp k7 to run ubuntu
2006-10-29T09:06:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	Hi - mine is running it ok - what problem are you seeing
2006-10-29T09:07:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	i cant get the k7 smp to run though
2006-10-29T09:08:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	Ah I 'll admit to knowing nothing about Nvidia, but I've got an old Radeon in my smp k7; how far does the k7 smp get ?
2006-10-29T09:08:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	it got to login at the command line
2006-10-29T09:08:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	couldn't start x
2006-10-29T09:09:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	Ah not too bad; then that is probably your nvidia and not the k7 smp
2006-10-29T09:09:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	said something about x module is version 8774 while nvidia is version 8762
2006-10-29T09:09:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	Ah - I don't know the nvidia stuff
2006-10-29T09:09:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	yes but it used to run perfectly with dapper
2006-10-29T09:10:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	upafter i upgrade to edgy it screwed up. the kernel didn't change and neither did nvidia
2006-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	It will install a '-generic' kernel that happily likes my dual k7 (although for some strange reason it still had -i386 as default...)
2006-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	when you run that generic one: do you actually see 2 cores?
2006-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	Yes
2006-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	ah ok, I was getting worried that I can't use dual core
2006-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	penguin42	daftvader	Nah it's happy
2006-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	daftvader	penguin42	thankx I will try
