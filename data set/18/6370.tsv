2008-07-02T23:56:00.000Z	Dot2Kode		Ronald: hrmm..one sec..I dont use brasero anymore..let me look at something with it though...you need to be able to make an iso of it though..i cant remember though if it does that...
2008-07-02T23:56:00.000Z	Dot2Kode		grr
2008-07-02T23:56:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	i mean..freakin' nick complete =D
2008-07-02T23:57:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	when you try to do a 1:1 copy what does it say? also i assume you are coping to your hdd first right? not using 2 burners..
2008-07-02T23:57:00.000Z	RonLut	Dot2Kode	lol.... you are not the first with "Ronald".... I have only the dvd writing DVDROM, so I make the source and the writing the same....
2008-07-02T23:58:00.000Z	RonLut	Dot2Kode	I tried to do image first, then burning it but still doesn't work (same error)
2008-07-02T23:59:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	hrmm..heh..lets see....one sec..let me check something real quick..that is strange though..what is your error?
2008-07-02T23:59:00.000Z	RonLut	Dot2Kode	Error while burning: An unknown error occured. Check your disc.
2008-07-03T00:00:00.000Z	Dot2Kode		Ronald: lmfao
2008-07-03T00:01:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	it sounds like its that disk..when you burnt it did you burn it at a high speed?
2008-07-03T00:02:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	lot of times when you burn system disks like those...if you burn at a faster speed they tend to act very strange...hehe..
2008-07-03T00:02:00.000Z	RonLut	Dot2Kode	1. the disc is working (I installed ubuntu with that) 2.I burnt it at 24x or something like that...
2008-07-03T00:04:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	got me on that one partner...I have had them not copy though and still work just fine when i burn fast...i always burn system disks and any other disks for that matter sloooowwww..hehe..tends to work better...probably because my computer is one pile of fail though...hehe
2008-07-03T00:05:00.000Z	RonLut	Dot2Kode	;) ok so I guess nothing to do :\
2008-07-03T00:06:00.000Z	Dot2Kode	RonLut	u could try another disk burning software..i.e..k3b..its for kde but works just fine in gnome..
