2008-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	amenado		excalibas-> then its time for you to take a break, get a fresh start tomorrow morning.. :P  it will come to you,  metric 0
2008-02-27T07:36:00.000Z	amenado		sammyF-> you have a /etc/profile
2008-02-27T07:37:00.000Z	sammyF	amenado	yep
2008-02-27T07:38:00.000Z	sammyF	amenado	just adding the line to it? I just compiled code::blocks and it succeeded in removing /usr/local/lib from the library path .. permanently :/
2008-02-27T07:39:00.000Z	amenado		excalibas-> no problem, sometimes a lil rest would do wonders
2008-02-27T07:39:00.000Z	amenado		sammyF-> thats the global profile that every user when they logged on, is used
2008-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	amenado		sammyF-> except for ssh login I think..but am not 100% sure about ssh login
2008-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	sammyF	amenado	k, thanks :) ld.so.conf isn't used by ubuntu?
2008-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	amenado		sammyF-> it maybe ldconfig
2008-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	amenado		sammyF-> man ldconfig  and it does mention about ld.so.conf
2008-02-27T07:42:00.000Z	amenado		Geoffrey2-> i like nfs
2008-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	sammyF	amenado	thanks ... if I don't get along with ldconfig I'll just add the export to profile. /usr/local/lib is mentioned in ld.so.conf, so it SHOULD be used ... just that it isn't ;)
2008-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	amenado		Geoffrey2-> i like nfs == network file system
2008-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	amenado	usser	they have nfs client for windows
2008-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	amenado		usser-> its been available since w95 i believe
2008-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	amenado		usser-> but it may not be from microsoft itself, some third party
2008-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	sammyF	amenado	just so you know, in case someone else comes up with the same problem : ldconfig.real (as root) rebuilt the library cache apparently
2008-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	sammyF	amenado	everything should work again :) thanks again!
