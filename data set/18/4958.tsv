2009-03-11T04:14:00.000Z	racecar56	bruce89	it's because they took it out of intrepid
2009-03-11T04:14:00.000Z	bruce89	racecar56	I meant, why do you need 3.4?
2009-03-11T04:15:00.000Z	racecar56	bruce89	it's because something i got to compile won't work on 4.x, it's very old
2009-03-11T04:17:00.000Z	racecar56	bruce89	i meant g++-3.4 sorry
