2011-09-25T16:54:00.000Z	gingerling	ikonia	I am sorry. I am just so angry. I cant do what I want and no one can help me with that, and I keep ending up with people suggesting other stuff thats more work than what I want
2012-02-09T17:23:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	yes, that file is not on that server
2012-02-09T17:24:00.000Z	gingerling	ikonia	is that a problem with the repos then?
2012-02-09T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	it's a problem with that server if it's in other repos
2012-02-09T17:25:00.000Z	gingerling	ikonia	Is there any way for me to solve this? All I am doing is opening software centre and trying to install stuff as normal
2012-02-09T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	check other servers to see if the file is there
2012-02-09T17:26:00.000Z	gingerling	ikonia	sorry, I am a non-tech, not sure how to do this
2012-02-09T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	open the link in a web browser
2012-02-09T17:27:00.000Z	gingerling	ikonia	which link
2012-02-09T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	the link you just posted
2012-02-09T17:28:00.000Z	gingerling	ikonia	just searches for it like its a word
2012-02-09T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/liba/libav/libavdevice52_0.6.2-1ubun
2012-02-09T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	that is the link
2012-02-09T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gingerling	testing that link (not security.ubuntu.com) on other repo servers will confirm if the file should be there or not
