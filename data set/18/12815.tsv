2006-03-06T14:47:00.000Z	JakeK		what's the craze with ubuntu? what's so special?
2006-03-06T14:48:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	I doubt there is a blanket answer for that
2006-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	well its been around for a while
2006-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	you never used lnux?
2006-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	that would be part of it
2006-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	JakeK	mustard5	never used linux
2006-03-06T14:50:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	its not always 'easy' or we wouldnt need this support channel :)
2006-03-06T14:51:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	I saw a lasermouse running on an ubuntu live CD over the weekend
2006-03-06T14:51:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	it was working ok
2006-03-06T14:52:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	grab a live CD and try it...the liveCD wont affect your installation at all
2006-03-06T14:52:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	well thats what the liveCD is for...testing it without installing
2006-03-06T14:53:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	it boots up from CD and runs in RAM
2006-03-06T14:53:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	I had trouble with knoppix on a dialup connection myself :)
2006-03-06T14:55:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	you can fiddle around and installt them yes...at least I have seen people install fluxbox
2006-03-06T14:56:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	ubuntu runs gnome by default...or kubuntu runs KDE
2006-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	get the liveCD first to test it...then you won't muck anything up
2006-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	I don't think the Breezy Badger 5.10 liveCD has one of those
2006-03-06T15:03:00.000Z	mustard5	JakeK	and 5.10 is the current stable...I've seen it on the next development version as Madpilot said
