2006-08-24T09:25:00.000Z	tehsu		anyone
2006-08-24T09:26:00.000Z	tehsu		Whats a desktop cpu monitor program for linux
2006-08-24T09:26:00.000Z	tehsu		gdesktels?
2006-08-24T09:27:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	OR system > admin > system monitor
2006-08-24T09:46:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	type "acpi -t" to see the temp
2006-08-24T09:47:00.000Z	tehsu	IcemanV9	how can i check what clock its running at
2006-08-24T09:48:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	not sure which command to find out its clock running
2006-08-24T09:51:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	i think i found the command -- sudo powernowd -v
2006-08-24T09:53:00.000Z	tehsu	IcemanV9	i wonder if i can set it to never go up past a certain level
2006-08-24T09:54:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	not sure .. that's what i am looking for an answer myself. :)
2006-08-24T09:55:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	instead of gdesklets, try this one -- multiload_applet (cpu, load avg, mem, net, swap)
2006-08-24T09:56:00.000Z	tehsu	IcemanV9	do u know the aptget for it
2006-08-24T09:57:00.000Z	tehsu	IcemanV9	have u ever underclocked a gpu
2006-08-24T09:57:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	i think it is already installed .. and no, i never underclocked gpu before
2006-08-24T10:01:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	wish i knew the answer .. this is definitely on my "to-do" list. i'd like to know how to control its cpu step as well.
2006-08-24T10:04:00.000Z	tehsu	IcemanV9	i would really like to control the step and the gpu clock and ill be staying on ubuntu for my laptop
2006-08-24T10:06:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tehsu	sorry about that, but keep googling for holy grail answer. (i'll do the same for myself)
