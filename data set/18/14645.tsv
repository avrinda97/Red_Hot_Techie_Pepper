2006-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	tmdca		Hello. Can anyone help me? I just installed Ubuntu 5.1 on my laptop, a dell latitude c600 and there was some errors during the installation ("cpufreq: change failed with new_state 1 and result 0") and now my thuchpad doesent want to work.... Whats wrong?
2006-05-31T09:32:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	sounds like there was a rpoblem with the cpu frequency change.....
2006-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	I did. But it still dosent work...
2006-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	search for issues with your processor.
2006-05-31T09:34:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	Not, yet. Okay, ill do that ^^  Thanks for the help.
2006-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	I mean I'd try another distro... you can get rid of a variable if another distro installs.
2006-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	but in the end it's just a band-aid :-P
2006-05-31T09:36:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	but.. i like ubuntu. well, with my broadband it will take o couple of hours to download an other dist... so i guess i wait for the new one.
2006-05-31T09:37:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	I was just saying another distro because it will tell you if it's a probelm in the distro...
2006-05-31T09:39:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	I see. Ill try some other dist. :)
2006-05-31T09:40:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	:-)
2006-05-31T09:40:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	honestly, I'd suggest trying to see if slack would work (it's the most vanilla distro out there in my opinion)
2006-05-31T09:42:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	Thanks again. I feel so stupid when i ask my boyfriend. ^^
2006-05-31T09:43:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	hahahaha! I'm migrating my gf to linux as well :-D. I hope I can help her, and not make her feel stupid. I hate when I do that, I feel like such a dick. She's a bright girl, and deserves to be treated like it.
2006-05-31T09:46:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	Well, i used linux before i meet him. He just know more than me. Oh, great. Girls and linux is a great combo. You dont make her feel stupid if you just are nice and encourage her to seek the answers self. (like i do now...  =D  )
2006-05-31T09:47:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	tmdca	okay, I'll tell her to rtfm once a week :-P j/k.
2006-05-31T09:47:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	=D
2006-06-07T13:36:00.000Z	tmdca	tuxtheslacker	Hello again. I still got probs with my ubuntu... The touchpad looses sync one and a while... You got any idea whats wrong?
