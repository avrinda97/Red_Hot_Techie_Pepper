2011-08-08T22:36:00.000Z	stealz		can anyone tell me how to further customize the login window in ubuntu 10.04? I only found the option to enable the Appearance manager, but I want to make the Window Background transparent, so you can only see the login input field and username
2011-08-08T22:38:00.000Z	oCean	stealz	transparant? Why not use your desktop background as background in login window?
2011-08-08T22:39:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	The "Desktop Background" is already changed, I am looking for a way to further integrate it into the background
2011-08-08T22:39:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	for the background of the window, I only get to select a colour, not an image
2011-08-08T22:40:00.000Z	oCean	stealz	oh but it is possible to actually change the background
2011-08-08T22:42:00.000Z	oCean	stealz	10.04 right?
2011-08-08T22:43:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	to make myself clear: I have something like this: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SEbMh2ospl8/TX9sgmvgZ2I/AAAAAAAAAgg/U8zAp-n2isg/s1600/Ubuntu-login-screen.jpg and I want it to look more like this:  http://slim.berlios.de/themes/slim-lake.jpg
2011-08-08T22:43:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	yes
2011-08-08T22:43:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	I already changed what would be the desktop wallpaper
2011-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	I want the login window where you enter your info be transparent, except for the button where you select the user and the input box
2011-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	oCean	stealz	aah, the actual loginbox
2011-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	yes
2011-08-08T22:45:00.000Z	oCean	stealz	ok, sorry, don't know about that. And haven't a 10.04 available to try
2011-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	thanks anyways
2011-08-08T22:48:00.000Z	oCean	stealz	found this: https://answers.launchpad.net/gdm2setup/+question/101329  It seems not an easy task
2011-08-08T23:13:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	just saw the link you posted me
2011-08-08T23:13:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	seems helpful, but as you said, not an easy task
2011-08-08T23:13:00.000Z	stealz	oCean	thanks a lot
