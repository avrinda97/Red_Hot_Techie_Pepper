2007-01-09T09:43:00.000Z	Camden		back on the subject of the cd that i got from dell... it says "reinstallation cd ms win xp home edition serv pack 2"
2007-01-09T09:43:00.000Z	Camden		can i use that in vmware?
2007-01-09T09:43:00.000Z	Camden		i would like to wipe out my preinstalled win partition
2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	Camden		and use vmware whenever i would have booted to win xp
2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	probably not...If I'm not mistaken, the Dell XP installers look for a specific CPU ID that Intel sells to Dell only. They won't work on any other hardware
2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	Camden		someone said dell may have sent me a "restore cd"
2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	Camden	auTONYmous	but it IS the original hardware!
2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	Camden	auTONYmous	i dual boot now
2007-01-09T09:45:00.000Z	Camden	auTONYmous	i would like to wipe out the xp partition and replace it with vmware
2007-01-09T09:45:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	but it won't look that way to the XP install if you load it under VMware
2007-01-09T09:46:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	It's always worth a try, but if it doesn't work, you know why
2007-01-09T09:46:00.000Z	Camden	auTONYmous	what is the standard way of getting xp on vmware?
2007-01-09T09:46:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	a standard Retail or Corporate XP Home/Pro disk
2007-01-09T09:47:00.000Z	Camden	auTONYmous	do i have any chance of getting that from dell?
2007-01-09T09:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	the cd's that Dell, HP, and others give out are called OEM disks, with a bunch of OEM locks on them.
2007-01-09T09:48:00.000Z	Camden		would it be possible from someone to hack a solution that would somehow read the OEM OS off of the xp partition and move it into vmware on the linux partition??
2007-01-09T09:48:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	BUT, if you have a reinstall cd, then there's a chance that the cd's load process _may not_ check your hardware IDs
2007-01-09T09:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Camden	There IS a way, that requires having two computers and cloning the XP install across the network...VMware has a disk for it, but I'm still not sure it would boot.
