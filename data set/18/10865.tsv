2009-06-04T02:42:00.000Z	codeFiend		if I have a 7.04 server sitting around, how likely am I to fubar it by trying to upgrade to 8, and thence to 9?
2009-06-04T02:42:00.000Z	codeFiend		yeah I read the EOL upgrade guide
2009-06-04T02:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	usually depends on how much you added from outside repos.  the more unsupported stuff the less likely it will go smoothly
2009-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	I don't think there was much extra added... hmm.
2009-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	review your sources list
2009-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	ah sorry about the language. slipped out.
2009-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	all standard sources, plus security, plus a freenx service that I never got to work right so it can be safely removed anyway
2009-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	7.04 has reached eol right?
2009-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	yup
2009-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	there's an EOL upgrade guide on the wiki I was reading the other day
2009-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	if needed, use the old.roeps and go for it.  I assume you have a backup
2009-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	I think I'm going to drive to datacenter and make one before I do it :)
2009-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	make a sep home while you are at it
2009-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	what do you mean separate home?
2009-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	yes
2009-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	that keeps your files sep from os so os can more easlily be updated
2009-06-04T02:48:00.000Z	codeFiend	Jack_Sparrow	makes sense.
2009-06-04T02:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	codeFiend	FYI, I keep a stable and a testing linux on every box
