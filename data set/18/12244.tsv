2010-10-13T02:22:00.000Z	pianoboy3333		hey, I'm having an issue with getting the nvidia driver to work -- my X got reconfigured. Last time I had this problem ubuntu was using the driver from an earlier kernel. nvidia-xconfig does not work nor does nvidia-settings. how do I make sure my computer is loading the right nvidia driver?
2010-10-13T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	open hardware drivers tool and see if the nvidia driver is enabled there
2010-10-13T02:25:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	it says "a different version" of the 185 driver is in use. I've tried installing it before but it goes back to saying this
2010-10-13T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	what says that ?

2010-10-13T02:28:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	how did you install the nvidia drivers in the earlier ubuntu release ?
2010-10-13T02:29:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	I'm not sure. It's possible that I compiled it
2010-10-13T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	that's probably the reason then as it's an unsupported confiugration
2010-10-13T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	the upgrade won't have known about it as it was outside the package manager
2010-10-13T02:30:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	so what should I do? compile again?
2010-10-13T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	certainly not, that will just make it less supportible
2010-10-13T02:30:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	alright
2010-10-13T02:31:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	what should I do? should I try a different version?
2010-10-13T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	pianoboy3333	no, as the modules you installed will still be in use
2010-10-13T02:32:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	what should I try?
2010-10-13T02:40:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	any suggestions?
2010-10-13T02:52:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	still there?
2010-10-13T03:05:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	ikonia	still there?
