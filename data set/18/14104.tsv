2006-10-08T12:37:00.000Z	Nothing_About		i didnt know it goes into live cd mode
2006-10-08T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	you want the alternate ISO, not the desktop
2006-10-08T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	You want the alternate CD, its a  nice textmode installer, etc
2006-10-08T12:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	just power down, not going to break anyting ;)
2006-10-08T12:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	alternate ISO
2006-10-08T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	you'll have to hit enter at the beginning, because there are different install types
2006-10-08T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	it walks you through it pretty well.  And, worst case is you did something wrong, and you can fix it, or install again ;)  Most people reinstall after a month once theyve figured stuff out, to undo all the mistakes ;)
2006-10-08T12:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	no, no.  this is an entire other disk, Alternate ISO, you have the Desktop ISO
2006-10-08T12:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	correct.  the desktop ISO is a liveCd primarily
2006-10-08T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	probably not, no.
2006-10-08T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	you actually might want to consider xubuntu, instead of ubuntu
2006-10-08T12:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Nothing_About	xfce instead of gnome, it's more lightweight.  (the window manager, the main GUI thing)
