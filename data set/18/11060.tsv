2006-09-23T10:52:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	I'll read about that :) mine is amd sempron k8
2006-09-23T10:53:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	you might be able to use cpufreq-selector to set a lower cpu speed
2006-09-23T10:54:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	well, when I type with "/proc/cpuinfo" get "stepping        : 0"
2006-09-23T10:54:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	you can also set different frequency scaling modes
2006-09-23T10:55:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	it should be supported by the cpu, perhaps it is not supported by your kernel?
2006-09-23T10:55:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	I have a precompilated ubuntu kernell 2.6.15-27-k7
2006-09-23T10:56:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	I have the powernowd package installed, it might contain a necessary kenel module
2006-09-23T10:58:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	I have it installed, but it doesn't let me load it "# modprobe powernow-k8 FATAL: Error inserting powernow_k8 (/lib/modules/2.6.15-27-k7/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.ko): No such device
2006-09-23T10:58:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	is k7 kernel the problem?
2006-09-23T10:59:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	I have a k7 kernel and powernowd cpu scaling works for me
2006-09-23T11:01:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	doesnt work for me. all work realy fine but when I connect usb storage devices, only storage type, the temperature increment a lot
2006-09-23T11:01:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	might just be bad design of your chipset/motherboard/usb controller
2006-09-23T11:02:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	hard to know if it is a software or hardware problem
2006-09-23T11:02:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	maybe, In the spanish mailing list, I knew a guy with the same mother board and usb hd and with the same problem
2006-09-23T11:04:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	How can I know what program/daemon init when I connect a storage device? and what is the different between usb storage devices and others like usb mouse, with mice I haven't that problem
2006-09-23T11:05:00.000Z	the1	jsilva	lsof will show you who is accessing the /dev file for your drive
2006-09-23T11:06:00.000Z	jsilva	the1	thanks, that is a good idea, maybe that program/daemon keep running after umount usb storage devices
