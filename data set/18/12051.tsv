2006-06-27T08:45:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	what nic do you have?
2006-06-27T08:47:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	isn't that a restricted driver aswell?
2006-06-27T08:49:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	did you bould that module allready with your last kernel, cause you need to do that every time when you update your kernel
2006-06-27T09:09:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	have you installed your restricted drivers? sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
2006-06-27T09:09:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	eehm, thats the command if you're in your buggy kernel btw
2006-06-27T09:10:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	yes you do need it, but you can install it with your other kernel, just exec the command, copy the line and install it with the -25 change
2006-06-27T09:13:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	yup
2006-06-27T09:15:00.000Z	Exussum	Cas	- i have the lastest version
2006-06-27T09:15:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-25-amd64-generic
2006-06-27T09:16:00.000Z	Cas	Exussum	sorry dunno then, search the bugzilla and report a new bug if you can't find anything about it
2006-06-27T09:17:00.000Z	Exussum	Cas	- can i remove that kernel and reinstall it ? or is that difficult ?
