2007-01-03T06:18:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	take a look at NX before settling for vnc, its WAY WAY faster then vnc, and works just as well
2007-01-03T06:20:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	is it possible to get a client for windows though? i need to connect from a windows machine, but i doubt there is a freenx client on windows, or is there?
2007-01-03T06:20:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	there is
2007-01-03T06:20:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	just use the nomachines client, its freely avalable for windows, on their homepage
2007-01-03T06:21:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	nomachines is an nx client?
2007-01-03T06:21:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	http://www.nomachine.com/
2007-01-03T06:21:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	thanks, im checking it out
2007-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	why none of these are in the repositories?
2007-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	i just downloaded the win client from there, and use it in windows, on the linux side i use freenx, works like a charm
2007-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	no idea to be honest
2007-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	yea i figured, i will go for that then, seems like the best option
2007-01-03T06:25:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	so youre saying NX is faster AND safer than vnc?
2007-01-03T06:27:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	yes
2007-01-03T06:28:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	thanks again, ill install it
2007-01-03T06:33:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	dang, the NX client from nomachine.com has to be installed on the windows machine, but i need to remote accedd my linux box from public windows machines that dont give you admin privilages, so you cant install anything
2007-01-03T06:34:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	but the vnc viewer client thingie can be downloaded from realvnc as a single exe file that doesnt require any installation
2007-01-03T06:34:00.000Z	BULLE	houman	oh well, then vnc it is for you then
2007-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	houman	BULLE	thanks for youre help though, and happy new year
