2008-07-31T15:26:00.000Z	ogzy		ok i am back with a new password
2008-07-31T15:26:00.000Z	ogzy		i am looking for a gui for lsmod that will show me modules installed with their version numbers with a user friendly way
2008-07-31T15:27:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	maybe gnome-device-manager ?
2008-07-31T15:32:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	ok thats what i ned but it doesnt show the driver versions
2008-07-31T15:32:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	anyway to see them?
2008-07-31T15:35:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	Not really... the kernel doesn't even know it seems (cat /proc/modules) ... it's just the version of the module in that kernel.
2008-07-31T15:35:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
2008-07-31T15:35:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	just trying get as much info as possible about drivers loaded
2008-07-31T15:36:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	Any particular reason? This isn't Windows... drivers don't digress in the linux world...
2008-07-31T15:37:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	i know, just questining whether some compiled modules may have versions
2008-07-31T15:38:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	I don't understand why you'd want to do that... it's pretty much irrelevant.
2008-07-31T15:41:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	for example i have already compiled and installed my wireless driver, and someone came and wanted to see whether the driver is uptodate or not, he checked the latest tar.gz version and will need to check the current installed one right?
2008-07-31T15:42:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	I don't use out of tree drivers...
2008-07-31T15:42:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	but i stil want to see my compiled drivers version
2008-07-31T15:42:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	Out of tree drivers are an entirely different cattle of fish, it's up to whoever maintains those drivers to do versioning etc... try apt-cache show <module-for-driver> | grep Version
2008-07-31T15:43:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	apt-cache-show is for deb packages right not the ones compiled via make and then insmod
2008-07-31T15:44:00.000Z	fde	ogzy	That is entirely unsupported.
2008-07-31T15:45:00.000Z	ogzy	fde	let me be more spesific because my question is not related with apt database, r8180 is the module i have already installed, any way to see its version?
