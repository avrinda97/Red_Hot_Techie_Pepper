2012-05-04T17:05:00.000Z	johan`	BlauskaerM	Alright, I'll try that... Do you literally mean for me to type "startx 2>$1 some-file-name" (without the quotes)?
2012-05-04T17:06:00.000Z	BlauskaerM	johan`	"startz > crachlog 2>$1"
2012-05-04T17:06:00.000Z	BlauskaerM		startx*
2012-05-04T17:06:00.000Z	BlauskaerM		See if you get any content in the file now
2012-05-04T17:08:00.000Z	johan`	BlauskaerM	Hm, nah, I get the following error: $1: ambiguous redirect
2012-05-04T17:08:00.000Z	BlauskaerM	johan`	Will try it
2012-05-04T17:08:00.000Z	BlauskaerM		One moment
2012-05-04T17:09:00.000Z	BlauskaerM	johan`	Dont include the $
2012-05-04T17:09:00.000Z	BlauskaerM		my bad
2012-05-04T17:09:00.000Z	BlauskaerM		"startx > crashlog 2>1"
2012-05-04T17:09:00.000Z	johan`	BlauskaerM	Oh, alright, thanks
2012-05-04T17:11:00.000Z	johan`	BlauskaerM	Yeah, it... Hm, that's interesting. I didn't get any output so I wrote "startx 2>1 crashlog" in desperation and now X started
2012-05-04T17:12:00.000Z	BlauskaerM	johan`	Is there a -v flag or debug flag that you can use?
2012-05-04T17:12:00.000Z	johan`	BlauskaerM	... And there we go, I got an Xterm session up and wrote unity and now I have a unity session. How weird.
2012-05-04T17:13:00.000Z	BlauskaerM	johan`	hehe :P
2012-05-04T17:14:00.000Z	johan`	BlauskaerM	Seriously, I'm not even gonna try and find out what happened. Thanks anyway :-)
2012-05-04T17:15:00.000Z	BlauskaerM	johan`	If it works, why spend time fixing it? ;)
