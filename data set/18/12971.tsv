2006-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	sophie_		I tried mounting my old lvm partition from my other drive (a fedora install), it seemed to mount it, but nothing is there
2006-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	sophie_		it was fedora 4, I hope i havn't lost everything *sob*
2006-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	sophie_		filesystem shows up as 'unknown' in GParted
2006-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sophie_	first rule of file recover - don't panic
2006-03-25T07:40:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	I seem to be ok at the moment, whats the next rule?
2006-03-25T07:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sophie_	what file system was this?
2006-03-25T07:41:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	i'm pretty sure it was an ext3 filesystem using lvm
2006-03-25T07:41:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	the standard Fedora 4 setup
2006-03-25T07:42:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	The Disks manager shows a 'Free Space' partition with a size of 4096GiB
2006-03-25T07:42:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	which is impossible
2006-03-25T07:43:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	oops, talking to myself
2006-03-25T07:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sophie_	there's this might help: http://codeworks.gnomedia.com/archives/2005/general/lvm_recovery/
2006-03-25T07:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sophie_	there's this might help: http://codeworks.gnomedia.com/archives/2005/general/lvm_recovery/
2006-03-25T07:50:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sophie_	please read this before you attempt anything: http://codeworks.gnomedia.com/archives/2005/general/lvm_recovery/
2006-03-25T07:51:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	i'm reading that, but i cant even mount the ext3 filesystem to begin recovering the lvm
2006-03-25T07:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sophie_	maybe boot off a live cd
2006-03-25T07:51:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	cant access /etc/lvm to begin with, which is the crux of the solution
2006-03-25T07:51:00.000Z	sophie_	Frogzoo	already tried that
