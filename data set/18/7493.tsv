2007-12-31T11:08:00.000Z	jordan		Hi guys, i'm having a problem with my xubuntu box freezing when I go away and I'm not sure why.  The monitor is off but it will not respond or anything, forcing a hard reboot.  Where should I look for errors?

2007-12-31T11:13:00.000Z	jordan	truna	the last syslog output was 'Dec 30 20:17:01 subuntu /USR/SBIN/CRON[9170]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)'
