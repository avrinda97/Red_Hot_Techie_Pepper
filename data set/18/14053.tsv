2006-06-20T13:58:00.000Z	floppyears		does anybody know if there is an ubuntu version in spanish ?
2006-06-20T13:59:00.000Z	floppyears		meaning all the programs and everything is in spanish
2006-06-20T13:59:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	most of programs are translated to spanish
2006-06-20T13:59:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	only make sure you install language-pack-es and specify spanish language at login options in GDM
2006-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	floppyears	guillem101	so if I choose spanish as my version during installation almost everything will be in spanish ?
2006-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	sure
2006-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	floppyears	guillem101	I won't have an internet connection in the machiine where I will install it :(
2006-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	I've done in catalan, so in spanish should be even better
2006-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	bad news
2006-06-20T14:01:00.000Z	floppyears		?
2006-06-20T14:01:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	I would strongly recommend to have a internet connection in order to install/setup ubuntu
2006-06-20T14:02:00.000Z	floppyears	guillem101	I know, but these guys don't have internet :(
2006-06-20T14:03:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	perhaps you  could carry the machine where you have a internet connection, install there and return them the machine installed and configured...
2006-06-20T14:03:00.000Z	floppyears		thanks wulax
2006-06-20T14:04:00.000Z	floppyears	guillem101	the problem is that my friend lives out of town, and I will be miles away from my internet connection, and moswt people don't have internet in that town, and the few who do is dial up
2006-06-20T14:07:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	:-(
2006-06-20T14:09:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	I'm not 100% sure the spanish language pack comes in the ubuntu install CD. You may check it and see if all the programs they need are there... otherwise you may download all the SuSE CD's and do a install of it instead of ubuntu.
2006-06-20T14:10:00.000Z	guillem101	floppyears	IMHO SuSE is a good choice if you do not have an internet connection to apt-get and so on.
