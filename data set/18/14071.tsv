2005-09-16T14:49:00.000Z	don824chan		Package wine is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-09-16T14:49:00.000Z	don824chan		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2005-09-16T14:49:00.000Z	don824chan		is only available from another source
2005-09-16T14:49:00.000Z	don824chan		E: Package wine has no installation candidate
2005-09-16T14:49:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	are you using breezy or hoary?
2005-09-16T14:50:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	you dont know which cd you downloaded to install with? was it a "preview" cd?
2005-09-16T14:51:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	look in applications -> accessories for terminal. that's where it is in breezy
2005-09-16T14:57:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	do you have Terminal under the Applications -> Accessories menu?
2005-09-16T14:58:00.000Z	don824chan	Quinthius	yes*
2005-09-16T14:59:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	ok, you are most likely using Breezy then, which is a preview/beta release of the next version. most instructions on how to set things up are for Hoary, so changes may be needed
2005-09-16T15:02:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	as "linux on the desktop" becomes more popular, as ubuntu seems to be making it, there will be a lot more "not as computer savvy" people using linux who will need just as much computer help as windows users :P
2005-09-16T15:12:00.000Z	Quinthius	don824chan	there's no need to "log in" as root, any commands you would need to do as root, you can preclude with "sudo". or if you want an interactive root shell, run "sudo -H -s"
