2005-07-10T11:27:00.000Z	cmatheson		is there a way to make it so that postfix re-writes my user name on mail going out?  i want it to look like mail is coming from cameron.matheson@foobar instead of cmatheson@foobar
2005-07-10T11:28:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	you can do it muttrc MUA
2005-07-10T11:28:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	i've changed my 'from' variable to 'cameron.matheson@foobar', but it doesn't seem to be respecting it...
2005-07-10T11:29:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	google muttrc
2005-07-10T11:29:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	ok. would it be different than the 'from' variable though?
2005-07-10T11:29:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	MUA = mail user agent -- MTA = mail transfer agent -- postfix is MTA, mutt is MUA
2005-07-10T11:30:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	ok
2005-07-10T11:30:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	i think you have to enable one more setting
2005-07-10T11:30:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	oh ok, back to the manpage
2005-07-10T11:31:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	google is better
2005-07-10T11:31:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	oh ok
2005-07-10T11:32:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	"set envelope_from"
2005-07-10T11:32:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	ah, ok thanks a lot
2005-07-10T11:32:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	google "muttrc" second hit -- help very much
2005-07-10T11:38:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	hmm, it's changing my domain name, but it's still not working for the username
2005-07-18T15:46:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	just go change your sources.list
2005-07-18T15:46:00.000Z	khermans	cmatheson	to what?
2005-07-18T15:47:00.000Z	cmatheson	khermans	take all the 'us' that you see out of it
