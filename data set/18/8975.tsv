2007-06-14T11:28:00.000Z	shiester_miester		but it seems very awkward to use
2007-06-14T11:29:00.000Z	shiester_miester		whereas in windows it is extremely easy and can be done in like 3 mouse clicks

2007-06-14T11:30:00.000Z	shiester_miester		and i said "in LIKE 3 clicks" - it was not a statement of absolute fact
