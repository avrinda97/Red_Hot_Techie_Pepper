2005-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	epicenter_		 Why can't I seem to find a version of libgtk-dev newer than 2.0 when the 2.6 libraries is installed?
2005-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	epicenter_		*are installed?
2005-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	bob2	epicenter_	you should look at the package version, dude
2005-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	epicenter_	bob2	Well, I know 2.0 < 2.6. Isn't that what I am looking at? The version? :P
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	epicenter_	huh?
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	epicenter_	apt-cache show libgtk2.0-0|grep ^Version
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	epicenter_		reports nothing
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	bob2		Version: 2.6.4-0ubuntu3
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	bob2		Version: 2.6.4-0ubuntu2
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	bob2		that's what it should print
2005-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	epicenter_		why the hell is it labelled 2.0 then?
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	epicenter_	it's not
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	epicenter_		2.0 would indicate 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, things like that
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	epicenter_	the package name contains the SONAME, which is indeed 2.0
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	epicenter_		not 2.6 ..
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	epicenter_		wow, that's messed up.
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	bob2		the version is in the Version
2005-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	epicenter_	no, it's not
