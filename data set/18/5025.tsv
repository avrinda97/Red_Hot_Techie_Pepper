2008-12-29T06:02:00.000Z	hckyplayer024		hi im trying to install ubuntu on an older computer. The Live CD hasnt worked because my CD drive doesnt like it for some reason. Ive been able to make a bootable copy on my hard drive and when Ubuntu starts i click installer. However when the installer gets to the partitioner, everything is gray. Anyone have a solution?
2008-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	is this the same hard drive you are using to boot off?
2008-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	yeah that would do it
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	hckyplayer024	thirdwheel	I thought this was the problem but I have no other way to install it....
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	you can't really modify a hard drive that
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	you can't really modify a hard drive that's in use
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	do you have another that you can use?
2008-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	hckyplayer024	thirdwheel	you mean install another harddrive into the computer and do it like that?
2008-12-29T06:05:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	yeah
2008-12-29T06:05:00.000Z	hckyplayer024	thirdwheel	- ive tried to do it with my USB drive, but theres no option in my bios to boot from USB and the alternate CD doesnt work
2008-12-29T06:06:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	is this a laptop or desktop?
2008-12-29T06:06:00.000Z	hckyplayer024	thirdwheel	its a desktop
2008-12-29T06:08:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	what happens when you use the live cd?
2008-12-29T06:10:00.000Z	hckyplayer024	thirdwheel	it just says that the disk is unvalid. but it works on other computers just fine. Im pretty sure its something with the CD drive
2008-12-29T06:11:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	could well be, do you have a cd drive you can throw in?
2008-12-29T06:14:00.000Z	hckyplayer024	thirdwheel	im trying to look for one. do you have any other way for me to get ubuntu onto my computer
2008-12-29T06:16:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	i'm not sure sorry, if you have another hard drive you can throw in to put the live cd stuff on you could do it that way
2008-12-29T06:17:00.000Z	thirdwheel	hckyplayer024	yep that would be it, no worries
