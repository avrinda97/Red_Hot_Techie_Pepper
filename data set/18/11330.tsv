2012-10-06T13:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tapas	hello, fancy running into you here
2012-10-06T13:39:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	hi :D
2012-10-07T12:11:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	ugh, using gnome? ;D
2012-10-07T12:13:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	aah :D
2012-10-07T12:13:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	that's a simple one..
2012-10-07T12:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tapas	and have you seen the KDE control panel?  How are you supposed to do anything with that?
2012-10-07T12:15:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	i agree though, that the kde system settings are a mess, too
2012-10-07T12:16:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	too bad gnome 2 was replaced by these other abominations ;D
2012-10-07T12:16:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	it was bearable..
2012-10-07T12:16:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	i think you can turn that off..
2012-10-07T12:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tapas	indeed
2012-10-07T12:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tapas	I don't have as much IRC experience as you
2012-10-07T12:21:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	:D
2012-10-07T12:21:00.000Z	tapas	gordonjcp	yeah, i discovered linux by going to a CCC in hamburg 20 years ago. and my first experience with unix was sitting in  front of a terminal with an IRC client..
2012-10-07T12:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tapas	my first experience of Unix was on some horking great Sun box at uni, in the early 90s
2012-10-07T12:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tapas	until I got my own 386 that would run Linux I spent a lot of time poking about on a purloined account on a SCO box at Aberdeen Uni
