2006-08-22T16:33:00.000Z	FantasticFoo		i can't seem to get compiz working for the life of me... anyone know a good tutorial for fglrx users?
2006-08-22T16:34:00.000Z	FantasticFoo		i've tried all the tuts
2006-08-22T06:01:00.000Z	FantasticFoo		i upgraded my version of xserver-xorg to a newer version from an unofficial .deb package - it apparently isn't compatible with my system somehow. how can i "downgrade" to the dapper version?
2006-08-22T06:02:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	it was an official package. :(
2006-08-22T06:02:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	does this work? sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core=1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10
2006-08-22T06:02:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	what was an official package?
2006-08-22T06:02:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	hmm, i'll try that...
2006-08-22T06:03:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	xserver-xorg-core in dapper-updates is broken..
2006-08-22T06:03:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	crud!
2006-08-22T06:03:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	don't ask me how the bug slipped in ._.
2006-08-22T06:03:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	so i just follow that command, and bang?
2006-08-22T06:03:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	if it downgrades the package, then it should be fine
2006-08-22T06:04:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	sweet!
2006-08-22T06:04:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	after the command, try: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start     and X should start (if you use gdm as login manager that is)
2006-08-23T06:40:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	whats wrong
2006-08-23T06:41:00.000Z	profoX`	FantasticFoo	I think #xgl has more people and most people there seem to use ubuntu anyway ;)
2006-08-23T06:41:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	oh... ok!
2006-08-23T06:43:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	profoX`	i'll be in #xgl then, i guess
