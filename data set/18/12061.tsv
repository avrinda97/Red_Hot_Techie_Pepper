2006-05-30T16:13:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	the only reason you would want a virus scanner in linux is for protecting yourself from accidentally infecting a windows computer during file transfers
2006-05-30T16:13:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	how can that be a problem?
2006-05-30T16:15:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	say you download some file that has a virus onto your linux machine.  now if you go transfer that file to a windows machine, you might infect it but your linux machine is fine
2006-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	i've done it by accident once when backing up files from a windows machine onto my linux one
2006-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	hehe... kk.... try to remember that....
2006-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	yeah.. what BrianHH said
2006-05-30T16:18:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	so... when i recently started my cpu now, i got the message of a forced systemcheck, cause it had been mounted more than 30 times, its not actually a virus?
2006-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	no... thats a standard filesystem integrity check
2006-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	ah... kk
2006-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	every once in a while it checks to make sure the filesystems are good and nothing is corrupted
2006-05-30T16:21:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	and what will the os do if it find some corrupted files?
2006-05-30T16:22:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	try to fix them
2006-05-30T16:23:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	how long did it take to run the check?
2006-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	its not the first time, so the same as earlier - would be the most proper ansewer... not more than 4 min. approx
2006-05-30T16:25:00.000Z	bleech	Ubuntunoob	do you know which partition it was checking by any chance?  e.g. the root partition? the boot partition?  if you don't know what i'm talking about then don't worry
2006-05-30T16:27:00.000Z	Ubuntunoob	bleech	hehehe... kk... then i guess i shall not worry ;)
