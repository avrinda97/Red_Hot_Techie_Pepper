2006-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	k
2006-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	i aptitude installed xcompmgr so what will i do now :D?
2006-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	THX-1138	brainstew	- okay. let me post my xorg.conf - just two edits but you will see where they go.
2006-10-02T05:09:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	 ok..
2006-10-02T05:21:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	so if i add these 2 options to xorg.conf it will do what? .. i added them
2006-10-02T05:22:00.000Z	THX-1138	brainstew	 xcompmgr -cCfF -r 4 -l 0 -t 0 -D 5 & transset .6
2006-10-02T05:30:00.000Z	THX-1138	brainstew	- Are you still there?
2006-10-03T09:30:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	hi my problem:  well i was a jerk and changed dapper to edgy in sources.list .. upgraded and then changed back to dapper in souces.list and put dapper back.. so now the gdm looks like windows 98 or smthn.. how can i get the nice ubuntu look back?
2006-10-03T09:32:00.000Z	THX-1138	brainstew	- That sounds involved. - Use a band aid and cover it with a new theme?
2006-10-03T09:34:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	if i change themes.. if themes are the things under "user interface settings" .. then it will only change colors of the windows 98 looking theme
2006-10-03T09:34:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	id like to reinstall the part of ubuntu where the look is.. i removed gdm and reinstallid it.. but didnt work
2006-10-03T09:38:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	 thunar wont start because it doesnt find ubuntulooks module_path.. what should i do? reinstall?
2006-10-03T09:42:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	 the edgy thing was a serious mistake.. my xorg.conf is a mess.. ntfs-3g wont work  and shiid :(
2006-10-03T11:32:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	: hey.. where could i get better repos for dapper ?
2006-10-03T11:33:00.000Z	THX-1138	brainstew	- I am very conservative - not the one to ask. - ripping 100g of wma lossless to ogg as we speak.
2006-10-03T12:07:00.000Z	brainstew	THX-1138	Kamping_Kaiser - the main problem seems to be getting the hz rate to normal.. i need 1024x768@120 .. how can i do it.. where can i get a modeline.. most of the modelines i have put there do not seem to work?
