2005-02-05T08:33:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	wait I figure out if other apt source repo is needed in addition to the default sources for 3ddesktop
2005-02-05T08:33:00.000Z	Quarupted	bretzel	what?
2005-02-05T08:34:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	we can install 3ddesktop easy with apt-get but I can't say if the default sources repositries provides that package - wait...
2005-02-05T08:36:00.000Z	Quarupted	bretzel	?
2005-02-05T08:37:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	To be sure that it works: fireup terminal console and do sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list   - to edit the sources file
2005-02-05T08:40:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	yes if you want to use cmdline console but you can run synaptic which is really easy, and 3ddesktop appears at the beggining because of the alphabetic sorting of pkgs
2005-02-05T08:43:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	Oh! I forgot :  sudo apt-get update
2005-02-05T08:44:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	To update the pkg lists from the added rops
2005-02-05T08:52:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	?
2005-02-05T08:53:00.000Z	bretzel	Quarupted	Did you get 3ddesktop ? - Did you "sudo apt-get update" before apt-get install 3ddesktop ?
