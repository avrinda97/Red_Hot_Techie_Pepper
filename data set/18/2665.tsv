2012-05-29T09:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 i recall having to twiddle with the pavmixer app. once to get mine going. but i dont recall the exxact binary  name
2012-05-29T09:29:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	is it used by default by ubuntu?
2012-05-29T09:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 hdmi audio works for me. but it may depend on the chipset
2012-05-29T09:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 i also found it weird. that i had no sound on my hdmi. till i messed with the mixers,, then got annoyed and rebooted and it started working. ;) go figure.
2012-05-29T09:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 should not need to be ran as root
2012-05-29T09:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 try pavucontrol like was mentioned
2012-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	even with pavucontrol, it shows the hdmi, but has no sound
2012-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 all i did was twiddle with mine.. and suddendly it started working.  No idea what i did. ;)
2012-05-29T09:34:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	nothing is working
2012-05-29T10:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 i recall having to restart the pulse audio server once afer messing with siome settings to get it working,.
2012-05-29T10:15:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	how do i do that?
2012-05-29T10:50:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	it has a session on its own, thats nice of them to do that for me
2012-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	xisor	 the xbmc site i recall has a xbmcbuntu variant that  i think had ion specific variants
2012-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	i had xbmcbuntu on here, but i had the same problems as i had on the full ubuntu
2012-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	xisor	dr_willis	with an xbmc only session they wouldnt be much of any difference at all right?
