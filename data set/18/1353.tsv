2011-03-15T02:58:00.000Z	LittleRed		hey guys.. know where I can find mdia bar drivers for a sony laptop... been lookig for 3 days
2011-03-15T02:59:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	which version of Linux are you running? I might be able to help with that...
2011-03-15T03:00:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	Ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-15T03:02:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	Okay, you are trying to get your multimedia keys to work, right?
2011-03-15T03:03:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	it's an actual media bar like a touch pad... I tried the key set up already...
2011-03-15T03:04:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	have you tried xev, to detect if it's being seen correctly?
2011-03-15T03:05:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	xev
2011-03-15T03:06:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	specifically, you'll want to run 'xev' from a terminal, so you can see if your media bar is sending any commands.
2011-03-15T03:06:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	pages of info
2011-03-15T03:07:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	yep, it generates a LOT of data...!
2011-03-15T03:08:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	you're going to look for the "keycode" info... that tells you which button has been pressed.
2011-03-15T03:09:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	did you see this page? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaKeys
2011-03-15T03:09:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	only thing similar is a keymap notify entry
2011-03-15T03:10:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	it has info on how to assign multimedia functions to various keys. Give that a try.
2011-03-15T03:10:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	so I use that 'code' in the keyboard mapping utility?
2011-03-15T03:12:00.000Z	Edlyness	LittleRed	I think so. Give it a try.
2011-03-15T03:15:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	I'm lost again...
2011-03-15T03:15:00.000Z	LittleRed	Edlyness	I can't find where to put it...
