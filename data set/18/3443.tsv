2009-12-18T08:39:00.000Z	slix		Nobody has responded to my boot help request :( Where can I go for help on this? I'd really like to use Ubuntu more often.
2009-12-18T08:41:00.000Z	slix		(Reasking) I'm having trouble booting. It seems that every time I start up, there is a 50% chance for one of the following to happen: endless blinking underscore or the loading screen afterwards freezes. I attempted to make a new livecd and reinstall from that. I confirmed the md5 hashes of both the .iso and the files on the cd. While using the livecd, i had the same problems. Using the livecd, installing it without going into Ubuntu, and
2009-12-18T08:41:00.000Z	slix		check disk integrity all had a blinking underscore or frozen loading screen. After a couple of attempts, I was able to get into the check disk option and it confirmed that my disk was okay. I then put the .iso on my usb drive. Although it was faster, it had the same problems. I then came back to my already-installed Kubuntu (it took 6 tries to boot up! 2 blinking underscores, 3 frozen loading screens!)
2009-12-18T08:43:00.000Z	losha	slix	what you describe is not a well known failure mode, which is presumably why no-one has responded. My guess is it's something about your hardware that interacts badly with ubuntu. It will be very hard to diagnose. I assume windows boots flawlessly on this machine?
2009-12-18T08:43:00.000Z	slix	losha	Yes. :(
2009-12-18T08:44:00.000Z	slix		Well, this is a bit difficult.. If it is my hardware, I either give up on Ubuntu or figure out why.
2009-12-18T08:44:00.000Z	slix		And replacing it will be even harder.
2009-12-18T08:48:00.000Z	losha	slix	you could try other distros: fedora, bsd. Or a 3rd. party bootloader. Or run ubuntu inside virtualbox under windows. You could start by running a memtest overnight
2009-12-18T08:50:00.000Z	slix		A thirdparty bootloader, as in not grub2?
2009-12-18T08:51:00.000Z	losha	slix	exactly. I've never had to use one, but there are a bunch of them, some free, some not...
2009-12-18T08:54:00.000Z	slix	losha	Do you know of any good bootloaders?
2009-12-18T08:55:00.000Z	losha	slix	never had to use one personally. But see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_boot_loaders
2009-12-18T08:56:00.000Z	slix		Urgh, this is going to be difficult.
2009-12-18T08:56:00.000Z	slix	losha	If I had this problem on the livecd, how will a new bootloader help?
2009-12-18T08:58:00.000Z	losha	slix	Hmm. it might not. I would try bsd next. It's not even a linux variant, completely different kernel...
2009-12-18T08:58:00.000Z	slix	losha	I kind of wanted to try Ubuntu though :P
2009-12-18T08:59:00.000Z	slix		I think I'll deal with this issue for now (it only seems to manifest on bootup) and make a post on the Ubuntu forums.
2009-12-18T09:00:00.000Z	losha	slix	there's always virtualbox
