2007-10-26T15:58:00.000Z	buttercups	Hexxeh	ok this is how I got mine working on my x300, scroll down to "Install from ati.com (latest version of drivers)" at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI

2007-10-26T16:20:00.000Z	Hexxeh	buttercups	Nope, I rebooted after doing that, logged in, and just got a while screen, had to select Failsafe GNOME to get back in.
2007-10-26T16:22:00.000Z	buttercups	Hexxeh	, theres a few over at #ati right now
2007-10-26T16:22:00.000Z	Hexxeh	buttercups	Okay I'll try there.
2007-10-26T16:22:00.000Z	buttercups	Hexxeh	you did follow steps 14 15 16 at the link I gave you right?
2007-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Hexxeh	buttercups	Yep. I think that's why I got the whitescreen, Compiz was attempting to start but couldn't.
2007-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Hexxeh	buttercups	Does it have a log file somewhere?
2007-10-26T16:41:00.000Z	Hexxeh	buttercups	"aborting and using fallback: /usr/bin/metacity" when I type compiz into a terminal, any ideas?
