2007-04-21T09:55:00.000Z	Derek_Russo		Hi everyone, I'm just wondering what the default X directory is in feisty
2007-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	Derek_Russo		does anyone know the X directory as it is by default?
2007-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	Derek_Russo		Xorg that is
2007-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	magnetron_	Derek_Russo	there is several directories for X, rephrase your question
2007-04-21T09:58:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	I am trying to install my ati driver again, and it is asking me for the directory so it knows what version of xorg to use.  Here's the command line it wants me to fill out: X_VERSION=<xdir> ./ati-driver-installer-<ver>-<arch>.run [--install] 
2007-04-21T09:59:00.000Z	magnetron_	Derek_Russo	why not use the Restricted Drivers Manager? My experience is that it Just Works.
2007-04-21T10:00:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	is that a new feature in fiesty?  I just upgraded a few seconds ago
2007-04-21T10:00:00.000Z	magnetron_	Derek_Russo	yes
2007-04-21T10:00:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	great, let me give it a try
2007-04-21T10:02:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	Have to download a package first.  I'll let you know in a few minutes if it worked.  Thanks for the help
2007-04-21T10:07:00.000Z	magnetron_	Derek_Russo	proprietary ATI drivers do not support Compiz, disable them and use the FOSS ones
2007-04-21T10:08:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	how do I do that?  I'm very new to linux
2007-04-21T10:08:00.000Z	magnetron_	Derek_Russo	in proprietary drivers manager, disable flglrx
2007-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	Ok, I have done that
2007-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	well it was "ATI accelerated graphics driver" but I think it's the same
2007-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	magnetron_	Derek_Russo	it is. after restart, check the Desktop Effects preferences
2007-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	ok, let me try
2007-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	Derek_Russo	magnetron_	I'll be back in a minute
