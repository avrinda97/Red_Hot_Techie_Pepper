2012-08-17T07:16:00.000Z	aqqin		so I'm trying to get an ISO copied onto a USB
2012-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	aqqin		how do I do this
2012-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	aqqin		someone told me to just straiight-up copy it
2012-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	aqqin		copy the contents on the USB
2012-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	aqqin		unetbootin doesn't work
2012-08-17T07:19:00.000Z	aqqin		it's not a distribution-specific issue
2012-08-17T07:19:00.000Z	aqqin		I'm using openSUSE
2012-08-17T07:20:00.000Z	aqqin		Windows 7, bazhang.
2012-08-17T07:21:00.000Z	aqqin		 Well, #SUSE won't help, #windows won't help ( but they said YOU GUYS would be more helpful)
2012-08-17T07:21:00.000Z	Roasted	aqqin	what exactly are you trying to do?
2012-08-17T07:22:00.000Z	aqqin	Roasted	I'm trying to install windows via USB
2012-08-17T07:22:00.000Z	Roasted	aqqin	Okay, so you have a Windows 7 ISO on a USB flash drive. Right?
2012-08-17T07:22:00.000Z	aqqin	Roasted	I have the ISO, but it's not on a flash drive
2012-08-17T07:22:00.000Z	Roasted	aqqin	okay, so you want to get the ISO onto the flash drive?
2012-08-17T07:23:00.000Z	aqqin	Roasted	Because I'm using a Linux distro to copy the ISO
2012-08-17T07:24:00.000Z	Roasted	aqqin	Well unfortunately the #windows guys were incorrect. This issue isn't Ubuntu specific... which is what this chat is for.
2012-08-17T07:24:00.000Z	Roasted	aqqin	that being said, I often get help in the off topic chat (ubuntu-offtopic) with semi related Linux bits like this.
2012-08-17T07:24:00.000Z	Roasted	aqqin	however, between you and me, if unetbootin can't do the job, I have no idea what will.
