2008-08-15T05:56:00.000Z	syazdani		quick question. I have set my ubuntu box to be static ip and now dns server is not working. Looking at /etc/resolv.conf it seems like things have changed quite a bit in the new version. Is there a good documentation on what I'm supposed to do to fix this?
2008-08-15T05:56:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	nothing has changed
2008-08-15T05:56:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	resolv.conf works the same in 8.04 as it did in 6.06 and early
2008-08-15T05:57:00.000Z	syazdani	ikonia	alright, then it doesn't work the way it does on gentoo I guess. There is a warning saying do not edit this by hand.
2008-08-15T05:57:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	it works exactly the same was way as it does in gentoo
2008-08-15T05:57:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	nameservers are listed in there
2008-08-15T05:58:00.000Z	syazdani	ikonia	in where? I just want to add my nameserver to resolv.conf. I have static ip, so dhclient is not being called, but I don't want to edit /etc/resolv.conf if there is a better place to edit it.
2008-08-15T05:59:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	you have to edit resolv.conf - thats what it's there for
2008-08-15T05:59:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	you can put static info in there
2008-08-15T05:59:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	as I said it works exactly the same in every other distro
2008-08-15T05:59:00.000Z	syazdani	ikonia	so, I should just ignore the big warning in that file.
2008-08-15T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	which warning ?
2008-08-15T06:00:00.000Z	syazdani	ikonia	in the /etc/resolv.conf
2008-08-15T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	what does it say
2008-08-15T06:00:00.000Z	syazdani	ikonia	This is what it says:
2008-08-15T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	your not using dynamic
2008-08-15T06:01:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	so yes, you can ignore that
2008-08-15T06:01:00.000Z	ikonia	syazdani	although I'm concerned why you have that warning, I don't see it in an 8.04 box
