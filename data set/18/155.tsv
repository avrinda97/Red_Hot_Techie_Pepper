2012-10-11T06:36:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	it'll tell you serverlag if any.
2012-10-11T06:37:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	/ping is what you use on freenode.
2012-10-11T06:39:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	if its a open proxy, some servers will ban you.
2012-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	this: transparent proxy: (40317/59321) - 203.113.213.181:80 - (203-113-213-181-static.TCS.netspace.net.au.)
2012-10-11T06:44:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	the IRCd connects to your host on a list of ports, and checks the service header.
2012-10-11T06:46:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	im not nice when i use proxies.
2012-10-11T06:56:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	how are you testing this proxy? you can use my site to tell if its transparent or elite status proxy
2012-10-11T06:58:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	your proxy is setup as a transparent proxy, you need to set it up for stealth.
2012-10-11T06:59:00.000Z	yekoms	Baralabite	i dont know, i dont setup proxies i just rape them LOL.

2012-10-11T08:35:00.000Z	Baralabite	yekoms	I know what the issue is, it's something to do with the permissions, and shell
