2005-11-30T13:41:00.000Z	mpm23		ok intelikey thanks again, I guess it makes sense, but I don't know how apt-get could upgrade something that's not a part of the repos anyway, I guess the removal argument is the best argument I can grok right now...
2005-11-30T13:41:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	it cant...
2005-11-30T13:41:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	it can remove, but not upgrade
2005-11-30T13:42:00.000Z	mpm23	guestish	and how would you remove something that you installed from source without dpkg? is there a way?
2005-11-30T13:42:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	remove the files manually
2005-11-30T13:43:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	this is why there are packaging systems with central databases
2005-11-30T13:44:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	or like i said earlier, install everything from source SEPERATELY from everything else so if all else fails just prune the whole tree...
2005-11-30T13:44:00.000Z	mpm23	guestish	ok thanks, what's your take on the value of a deb versus a source code filemanually?  (As in Sun's Java conversion from bin to debian on the wiki)
2005-11-30T13:45:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	?
2005-11-30T13:46:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	a deb is a binary package, a source deb is a source package if thats what you mean
2005-11-30T13:48:00.000Z	mpm23	guestish	intelikey was trying to help me with my question which was this: I'm installing Sun's Java and on the wiki there's a place that describes how to build a deb from the sourcecode... I was wondering what the advantage of building the deb file is versus just using make and intelikey suggest (I think) that perhaps the advantage lay in the simple power to use dpkg to remove the whole thing at a later date...
2005-11-30T13:49:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	theres a tool called jpkg (iirc) that you use
2005-11-30T13:49:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	and java is distrubted binary only...
2005-11-30T13:51:00.000Z	mpm23	guestish	yes I'm in the process of converting that using jpkg... I didn't mean for the query to last this long, I was simply trying to understand Why it's important to convert it to a deb rather than installing it as-is
2005-11-30T13:51:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	because you can uninstall it and debian packages need it for dependency issues
2005-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	its gonna ask you to install java if it doesnt know its installed ( you used the install script instead of the deb file)
2005-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	get what im saying?
2005-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	guestish	mpm23	np, glad your question got answered...
