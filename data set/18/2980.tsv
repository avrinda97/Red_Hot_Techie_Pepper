2010-04-08T19:07:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	i got the idea clearly ;)
2010-04-08T19:07:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	http://pastebin.com/TBRkmH2z
2010-04-08T19:09:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	I tried with --configure too but without luck
2010-04-08T19:11:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	well, maybe someone else have a better ideia, but if I had this problem the thing I was going to do is to bakup /var/lib/dpkg/status then search for mysql-server inside it and manually remove the package from there, after them try running the apt-get install again
2010-04-08T19:12:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	gonna try that, I had already removed /var/lib/mysql too
2010-04-08T19:13:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	well, but remember of removing only the mysql-server package, not those who say to have him as dependency
2010-04-08T19:16:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	do u mean removing this? http://pastebin.com/wJ9mCvy1
2010-04-08T19:16:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	exactly (don't forget to backup status file), after that run apt-get install again
2010-04-08T19:19:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	no way :,(
2010-04-08T19:20:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	you may see if there isn't other mysql-server package, that you showed was the only one you finded ?
2010-04-08T19:21:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	I was running mysql-server-5.0 whithout problems but when I upgraded to mysql-server-5.1 something went wrong and both instances screwed up
2010-04-08T19:22:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	okay, take a look at the status file and search for mysql packages there... you may need to remove more them one from the list to apt-get reinstall all it is needed
2010-04-08T19:24:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	if you like I could give you some help, but for that I would like to inspect the file
2010-04-08T19:26:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	thanks but I have removed every description of the mysql-server package of status file and luck yet :(
2010-04-08T19:28:00.000Z	maginot	marcuy	that is odd... did you changed any repository or this happen after an update?
2010-04-08T19:28:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	this happened after upgrading to mysql-server-5.1
2010-04-08T19:40:00.000Z	marcuy	maginot	geekphreak also when I'm installing it and asks to change root password it shows: http://pastebin.com/CZgwCcxw may be this can be helpful
