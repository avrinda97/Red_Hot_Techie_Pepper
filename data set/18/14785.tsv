2005-06-17T05:09:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	how did using backports affect your system?
2005-06-17T05:10:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	i updated repositories (with backports) and it updated samba-common to a much higher version number than what's in there now.  when i tried to install regular samba to setup file sharing with my xp box, it refused to install because it said i had the wrong version of samba-common.
2005-06-17T05:13:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	actually, if you go cold turkey and not use windows xp or windows anything and just use linux for a few months, chances are you will never have any desire to use windows xp or whatever again. IMO.
2005-06-17T05:14:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	it's hard as i have been using dos/windows/microsoft os since i was 10 so i know it like the back of my hand...  i'm stepping into unchartered waters now.
2005-06-17T05:15:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	i do all my gaming on windows tho', and my customers are all windows so i have to keep up.
2005-06-17T05:15:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	well back then you devoted your learning to what you were learning, right? Do the same with Linux. :)
2005-06-17T05:15:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	that's what i am starting to do now :)
2005-06-17T05:15:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	it's just going to be a slow transition
2005-06-17T05:16:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	excellent :)
2005-06-17T05:28:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	the key in your question starts and ends with the word "if". If pigs could fly, planes might find it harder to fly. If, if, if.
2005-06-17T05:28:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	yes indeed...
2005-06-17T05:32:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	do yourself a favor and never bring up windows in your presence :)
2005-06-17T05:33:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	lol
2005-06-17T05:33:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	i have a 3ghz pc sitting next to me with an xp desktop staring at me right now
2005-06-17T05:34:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	I bet QNX 4 floppy would really go fast on that
2005-06-17T05:40:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	what if microsoft came out with their own distro of Linux?
2005-06-17T05:40:00.000Z	lotusleaf	syntaxerror64	are you from the future? Are you talking about M$:Solaris?
2005-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lotusleaf	that must be what i had read they were working on
