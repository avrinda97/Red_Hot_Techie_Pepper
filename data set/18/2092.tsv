2010-09-02T22:28:00.000Z	Hounddog		hi, i am just following this tutorial to create the boot partition https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CreateBootPartitionAfterInstall i am stuck at where i shall change the grub config...
2010-09-02T22:29:00.000Z	Hounddog		as there is no menu.lst anymore i looked up google and found it is /etc/default/grub
2010-09-02T22:29:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	yes
2010-09-02T22:30:00.000Z	Hounddog	itsux2bu	where do i set the default drive?
2010-09-02T22:30:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	never done that myself.. i've edited /etc/default/grub
2010-09-02T22:30:00.000Z	Hounddog	itsux2bu	that is what i am editing
2010-09-02T22:31:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	at top of that file.. 2nd line i believe.. it references a file.. maybe carefully look in there
2010-09-02T22:32:00.000Z	Hounddog	itsux2bu	http://www.pastie.org/1134215 this is the config
2010-09-02T22:35:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	i don't think that goes in that file.. look this beyond me and grub is dangerous to mess with.. i'm going to bow out.. i wouldn't want to tell you something i know nothing about
2010-09-02T22:36:00.000Z	Hounddog	itsux2bu	that's fine, i am just struggling to get the system started... it is looking as if it is not finding the mbr as it is stuck at "loading operating system" so i just wanted to create a boot partition and put it there
2010-09-02T23:02:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	what did the trick?
2010-09-02T23:03:00.000Z	Hounddog	itsux2bu	i went to channel #grub and there i just followed the link in the message
2010-09-02T23:05:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	cool link
2010-09-02T23:05:00.000Z	itsux2bu	Hounddog	glad you got it working
