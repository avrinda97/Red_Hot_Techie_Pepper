2006-04-22T05:35:00.000Z	bobbyd		hi
2006-04-22T05:35:00.000Z	bobbyd		I have a broken package that's blocking my apt system, how do I kill it?
2006-04-22T05:36:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	what's the exact error message? Put it on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ if it's more than 2 lines
2006-04-22T05:37:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	thanks, here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12408
2006-04-22T05:39:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	the command that the postrm script cannot find is in tetex-bin ; try installing that package and then removing lilypond
2006-04-22T05:40:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	thanks, how dod you tell that?
2006-04-22T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	I have the package apt-file installed, it allows me to look up a lot of info about packages.  I did apt-file search /usr/bin/kpsewhich . That's what told me which package it was in.
2006-04-22T05:42:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	ah great, thanks
2006-04-22T05:44:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	the problem is that it keeps trying to remove the lilypad thing before installing anything else, so I can't install tetex...
2006-04-22T05:45:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	try sudo aptitude install lilypond (to clear the lilypond removal request), then installing tetex-bin
2006-04-22T05:45:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	sometimes clearing this kind of thing up takes a few steps, don't get warped :)
2006-04-22T05:46:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	:)
2007-10-25T01:50:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	don't scroll while the pointer's on the window boxes lower right
2007-10-25T01:54:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	it seem to happen when the desktop is focussed, i just want to turn it off
2007-10-25T01:54:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	you're running compiz then?
2007-10-25T01:54:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	I'm just using the latest version of Ubuntu as it came
2007-10-25T02:00:00.000Z	nickrud	bobbyd	I know I saw something about that in system->prefs->advanced desktop, but can't find it
2007-10-25T02:00:00.000Z	bobbyd	nickrud	I'll have a look :) thanks
