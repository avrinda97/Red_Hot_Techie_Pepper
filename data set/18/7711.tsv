2007-11-28T05:28:00.000Z	jpeterman		Hi, got a question. When I torrent (I'm torrenting a legit cd, a Gutsy iso) at school, I use Deluge and it doesn't download anything, even with a non-standard port and encryped transmission. Can anyone suggest me how to find ports that will work?
2007-11-28T05:28:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	use a portscanner and find which ports are open
2007-11-28T05:29:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	nmap is the best theres a gui frontend called nmapfe
2007-11-28T05:30:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	from the cli type: sudo apt-get install nmapfe
2007-11-28T05:32:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	yup you need to run as root
2007-11-28T05:34:00.000Z	jpeterman	CochiseIRL	what options should I enable?
2007-11-28T05:35:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	one sec and i'll find out for you

2007-11-28T05:45:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	ok, you could try nmaponline.com
2007-11-28T05:51:00.000Z	jpeterman	CochiseIRL	nmaponline didnt find anything. I dunno wtf is going on with this firewall
2007-11-28T05:51:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	jpeterman	colleges/schools tend to have everything blocked by default
