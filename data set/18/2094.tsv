2010-08-19T19:49:00.000Z	stefan33	erry	 Your are looking for /etc/resolv.conf I believe
2010-08-19T19:50:00.000Z	stefan33	erry	 'man resolv.conf' should give you lots of info on the behavior and get you well on your way.

2010-08-19T19:51:00.000Z	stefan33	erry	 No worries, just making sure you can get all the info you might need :)
