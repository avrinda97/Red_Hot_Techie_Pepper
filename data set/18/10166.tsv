2007-01-06T17:10:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	well whats the problem? just install windows first if it's windows then ubuntu
2007-01-06T17:11:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	or are you using a dell emachine?
2007-01-06T17:12:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	theres a howto install ubuntu video on youtube, teaches you that stuff in about 10 minutes
2007-01-06T17:18:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	once linux is install you can access them from /media/hda or somethin simliar depending on your installation/hardware)
2007-01-06T17:19:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	linux doesn't use drive letters like windows. everything is a subdir of / (the root dir) and you can mount your other devices to any directory inside of any subdir in /. your cd rom, your windows partition, etc
2007-01-06T17:21:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	yes
2007-01-06T17:28:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	if you're worried about things you might want to just download vmware server for windows (it's free) and practicing installing linux on there before you do a real install on your hardware. i did that and it gave me a lot of confidence
2007-01-06T17:29:00.000Z	heapme	Aggort	theres no reason it shouldnt install if you created a / and swap partition , and then just start installing, it will format them probably and then install. the end
