2012-09-14T11:44:00.000Z	luingar		oh hey
2012-09-14T11:45:00.000Z	luingar	tsimpson	thanks a bundle, that was what i need
2012-09-14T11:46:00.000Z	luingar		so what's the first thing i should do after installing ubuntu? sudo apt-get update?
2012-09-14T11:47:00.000Z	luingar		none comes with ubuntu?
2012-09-14T11:47:00.000Z	POVaddct		they really should switch to sha256sum for the hashes. oh, they also have that: http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/SHA256SUMS
2012-09-14T11:48:00.000Z	luingar		what's the difference?
2012-09-14T11:49:00.000Z	luingar		why is sha256sum better than md5sum?
2012-09-14T11:51:00.000Z	POVaddct	luingar	md5 is considered as "broken". thus you can alter data and get the same md5sum.
2012-09-14T11:51:00.000Z	POVaddct	luingar	but i think its still difficult enough to do that, so md5 kind of works
