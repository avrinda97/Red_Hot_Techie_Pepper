2008-05-06T12:37:00.000Z	dessnr		hi all.  I've upgraded to hardy, but I notice that the drivers for the Point of View (NVIDIA) 7600gt still don't work.  I've tried everything under the sun and still no go.  Any chance of a date for problem solving on this issue?
2008-05-06T12:39:00.000Z	dessnr		good luck Bidget, I'm having trouble with an earlier card.
2008-05-06T12:39:00.000Z	dessnr		same Bidget
2008-05-06T12:41:00.000Z	dessnr		i tried envy and I get the same thing Xcell.  I get a message coming up saying that I have to run in low res, cause their is a problem selecting the driver.  I manually select the 7 series for my 7600GT and still nothing.
2008-05-06T12:42:00.000Z	Xcell	dessnr	try installing nvidia settings manager
2008-05-06T12:43:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	 i did that in gutsy, but i will try it here.
2008-05-06T12:45:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	do you have the sudo command for that off hand for downloading nvid manager?
2008-05-06T12:45:00.000Z	Xcell	dessnr	its in repros, just go to synapt, and in search type (nvidia)
2008-05-06T12:49:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	do i need to first enable the NEW drivers to be able to utilise the nvid config you speak of?
2008-05-06T12:49:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	cause when i enable them, i have the problem of having to run in low res.
2008-05-06T12:49:00.000Z	Xcell	dessnr	if you have the drivers, install them, but you should still be able to run that yes
2008-05-06T12:50:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	thanks, will give it a go.
2008-05-06T12:50:00.000Z	Xcell	dessnr	as i said, rebooting will allow x to figure things out
2008-05-06T12:50:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	yeah i rebooted many times for this in the past, but not two times in a row so I will try that now.
2008-05-06T12:51:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	shall do, back soon.
2008-05-06T13:45:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	(NVIDIA Drivers) good news, got it working.  now heres the long story.  i could not get it working in 7.10 (gutsy) for the life of me.  Couldn't work out why.  I installed hardy, and tried everything I had before.  Now heres the tricky bit.  I have Windows XP, fedora 8 and Ubuntu installed.  When I first did all this I had to alter the file in fedora 8's boot/grub/menu.1st.  I had to add the Ubuntu entry to the fedora boot/grub/menu.1st so that Ub
2008-05-06T13:45:00.000Z	Xcell	dessnr	is it working now?
2008-05-06T16:31:00.000Z	dessnr	Xcell	Big thanks to you man!  Everything is swimming along for me now!  My effects and desktop are coming along like never before!
