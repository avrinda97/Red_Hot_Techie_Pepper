2009-04-30T05:08:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	Good for you. Go troll elsewhere
2009-04-30T05:09:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	Ok, my mistake. What specifically are you referring to? They both have weaknesses
2009-04-30T05:13:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	Try doing any sort of advanced network attacks on your mac and get back to me
2009-04-30T05:13:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	Anyone who likes their choices being made for them

2009-04-30T05:14:00.000Z	CocoaCoder	piroko	- youre a little defensive - typical Linux user
2009-04-30T05:15:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	How about the ability to write your own kernel drivers, or perform wireless injection, or to not pay ridiculous premiums on mediocre software?
2009-04-30T05:17:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	Yep. It's a simple suite for simple minded people. Not very powerful :-/  And you sir, are a "typical" mac user. It goes both ways. And now you'll be going out the door
2009-04-30T05:18:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	You ignored my points
2009-04-30T05:18:00.000Z	piroko	CocoaCoder	Because you have nothing to say about them :-/
