2006-05-16T11:52:00.000Z	Sandig		hello
2006-05-16T11:52:00.000Z	Sandig		can i ask a question?
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		heh
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		ok
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		fair enough
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		so
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		i have a laptop with no cd drive but does support usb booting
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		is there a ubuntu net-install image/version that i could put on a usb stick
2006-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sandig		to install to the laptop?
2006-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	roryy	Sandig	have you looked through these ? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation
2006-05-16T12:02:00.000Z	Sandig	roryy	i could really do with a usb image that contains just a basic kernel and some drivers and will then go get all the packages it needs to install of the net
2006-05-16T12:03:00.000Z	roryy	Sandig	this is not sufficient? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/FromUSBStick
2006-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	roryy	Sandig	ubotu has a 'netinstall' factoid, not sure what that's about
2006-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Sandig	roryy	forgot to mention, the only usb stick i have accessable to me is only 128mb
2006-05-16T12:05:00.000Z	roryy	Sandig	just to be clear, i've never used any of these -- just trying to point you in a hopefully helpful direction
2006-05-16T12:06:00.000Z	Sandig	roryy	no problem. what ya got?
2006-05-16T12:06:00.000Z	roryy	Sandig	check your privmsgs from ubotu
2006-05-16T12:07:00.000Z	Sandig	roryy	checked. thanks for all your help.
