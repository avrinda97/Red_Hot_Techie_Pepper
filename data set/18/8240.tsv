2007-10-24T14:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	you can run konquerer in a gnome environment
2007-10-24T14:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	i think it just loads the qt libraries
2007-10-24T14:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	i've done it.  it runs fine, like other apps.  it looks a little different, but not unusably so
2007-10-24T14:33:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	i came into the conversation late.  hopefully i'm not misleading.  what is it that you want to do?
2007-10-24T14:35:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ozzloy	I'd like to have a file browser which has 1 file tree and 2 panes, like this  http://images.snapfiles.com/screenfiles/xplorer2.gif
2007-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	interesting.  i've never seen that before.  does the tree correspond to the left or right pane?
2007-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ozzloy	the tree always controls the pane you last clicked in
2007-10-24T14:36:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	also, i have no idea how to do that.  konqueror has a bajillion options, like everything in kde, so ... maybe
2007-10-24T14:37:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ozzloy	it's such a great file browser for windows... it has many good and useful features like if you double-click into empty space that means "go up" and so on...
2007-10-24T14:38:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	sorry, i don't do much visual directory walking, so i really don't know
2007-10-24T14:40:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	the only things that come to mind are: write the changes to some existing file browser; get this file browser working using wine and then use some hax to use it to browse your linux stuff
2007-10-24T14:40:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	barring the possibility that some file browser already does these things
2007-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	try "sudo apt-get install konquerer"
2007-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ozzloy	I just found this: looks just right http://rommel.parsed.nl/temp/konqueror-splitview.png
2007-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	it will probably have a bajillion dependencies
2007-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	hey, that does indeed look like the other one!
2007-10-24T14:42:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ozzloy	112mb for konqueror and all its deps ;)
2007-10-24T14:43:00.000Z	ozzloy	Shapeshifter	good luck with that
