2010-04-24T17:50:00.000Z	mozir		I'm using compiz and there is an annoying lag when I maximize windows from the taskbar. Is this a bug√ü
2010-04-24T17:50:00.000Z	mozir		*?
2010-04-24T17:50:00.000Z	Ahox	mozir	do you have compiz enabled?
2010-04-24T17:50:00.000Z	mozir		Yes, with ccsm
2010-04-24T17:51:00.000Z	Ahox		if so it could well be that your opengl is software rendered
2010-04-24T17:51:00.000Z	mozir		I have already enabled the drivers for my ATI card
2010-04-24T17:51:00.000Z	mozir		And everything else doesn't lag either
2010-04-24T17:51:00.000Z	Ahox	mozir	 can you run glxinfo|grep renderer
2010-04-24T17:52:00.000Z	mozir	Ahox	sure
2010-04-24T17:52:00.000Z	mozir	Ahox	OpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 3870
2010-04-24T17:53:00.000Z	Ahox	mozir	 this looks good. In this case I am sorry, I don't really have any other ideas...
2010-04-24T17:53:00.000Z	mozir	Ahox	Thanks for your help :) Ubuntu is great by the way
2010-04-24T17:54:00.000Z	mozir		Although I have another "problem": I'm used to Windows XP with Visual Studio for C++ development. I have never written a makefile and would be glad if I wouldn't need too. How can I get started with C++ on Ubuntu? Any IDE or easy compiler available?
2010-04-24T17:55:00.000Z	Ahox	mozir	 try kdevelop, it belongs to kde, however it is a really nice ide
2010-04-24T17:55:00.000Z	mozir		sereau: Thanks for both
2010-04-24T17:56:00.000Z	mozir	Ahox	I'll do that right now, thanks
2010-04-24T17:59:00.000Z	mozir		Is there some 3D game with good graphics out there for Ubuntu? I'd like to test my graphics card and the drivers - Can't really find something over the Software Center unfortunately
2010-04-24T17:59:00.000Z	Ahox	mozir	there is this nice oss racing game
