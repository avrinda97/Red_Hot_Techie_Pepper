2008-06-04T03:36:00.000Z	joni_		anyone had wireless problems after recent updates?
2008-06-04T03:37:00.000Z	SeaPhor	joni_	yes, not sure if related but i just rebooted the cable modem and the wireless router and all was ok again
2008-06-04T03:38:00.000Z	joni_		SeaPhor... this is certainly a driver/kernel issue... other machines are fine
2008-06-04T03:41:00.000Z	SeaPhor	joni_	the other machines are also Ubuntu? because my 4 Ubuntu boxes did the same but the 5 windows boxes didnt lose the connection, well hope you find it and post the fix here
2008-06-04T03:43:00.000Z	joni_		SeaPhor.. on another machine.. also ubuntu8.04... did have the same symptom after updates... However just re-installed the driver and worked.. for this machine it did not.
2008-06-04T03:43:00.000Z	joni_		brb time to try a re-start AGAIN.
