2007-06-17T08:11:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	I'm on a different PC, I reinstalled network-manager-gnome, and wpa_supplicant, and it asked for my wpa password when I booted, but still it isn't connecting
2007-06-17T08:11:00.000Z	spheard	bobbob1016_	havent you disabled wpa?
2007-06-17T08:11:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	yeah, and it connected, then I re-enabled it
2007-06-17T08:12:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	I'm not taking it down permanently
2007-06-17T08:12:00.000Z	spheard	bobbob1016_	no, no, just try a differnet encryption protocoll
2007-06-17T08:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	which one?  I'm not sure what I can change, everyone in my house blames me the second anything goes wrong with the network, and if I change something, they will blame that for any issue, if the web is slightly slow, I'll be blamed
2007-06-17T08:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	etc.
2007-06-17T08:15:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	I'll play with it then, so now I know it is the WPA at least
2007-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	spheard	bobbob1016_	know what you mean :-) fuckin luddites eh?
2007-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	kind of, with good reason, I used to use kazaa YEARS and YEARS ago, and that was my problem, so even now I'm still blamed
2007-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	kind of good reason
2007-06-17T08:22:00.000Z	spheard	bobbob1016_	I recon, If Im going to admin it I get to chew the bandwidth
2007-06-17T08:24:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	yeah, but my dad, the programmer since punch cards blames me for IP conflicts, even though my static ones are under 100, and DHCP starts at 100, and he also blames me for poor signal when he's behind the kitchen, fridge and stove and everything
2007-06-17T08:25:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	so I don't want to say "we're on wep or wpa2 now, here's the code"
2007-06-17T08:28:00.000Z	spheard	bobbob1016_	tell him its a vital security upgrade cos next door is looking a t child porn on our netwrok and the feds are gonna come down
2007-06-17T08:34:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	I did that when I put WPA on, he didn't buy it, so if I do it now, there's less of a chance he'll believe me
2007-06-17T08:34:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	not the child thing, but still
2007-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	spheard	it might be a keyring issue, since now when I enter the WPA password, it tries to connect, then when I try again, I have to re-enter the password
