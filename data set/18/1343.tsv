2011-03-31T03:01:00.000Z	Miciah		Hello.  Is there anything I might do that would fix 'Failed to fetch ... Size mismatch' errors from apt (apt-get or aptitude)?
2011-03-31T03:01:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	is that from install/upgrade or from update?
2011-03-31T03:01:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	Install.
2011-03-31T03:01:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	try "sudo apt-get update"
2011-03-31T03:01:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	Done that, repeatedly.
2011-03-31T03:01:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	I have a fresh install of natty.  I'm reinstalling a lot of packages, but many of them give me that error.
2011-03-31T03:02:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	oh. then in that case id guess maybe the server is being weird. you could try a different mirror i guess
2011-03-31T03:02:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	I've tried two, including us.archive.ubuntu.com.  I could try another mirror.
2011-03-31T03:02:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	i think us.archive and archive are the same
2011-03-31T03:03:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	I also tried archive.linux.duke.edu.  I could try another mirror...
2011-03-31T03:03:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	I did verify with curl -I and apt-cache showpkg, and the file sizes do indeed differ.
2011-03-31T03:03:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	is apt-get update giving you errors when you runi t?
2011-03-31T03:05:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	maco Yes, but not for the Ubuntu repositories, only for ftp.us.debian.org and apt.duke4.net.
2011-03-31T03:05:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	wait...you have debian and ubuntu repositories mixed?
2011-03-31T03:06:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	Yes, but I haven't installed anything from Debian at this point, I have Ubuntu pinned, and I've tried apt-get install -t natty and -t maverick.
2011-03-31T03:08:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	Anyway, the Content-Length from the mirror and the Size in the package listing definitely differ (I checked with curl -I and apt-cache showpkg).
2011-03-31T03:14:00.000Z	maco	Miciah	it sounds like you're having a local apt-cache problem, but i dont know how to fix it :-/
2011-03-31T03:16:00.000Z	Miciah	maco	OK, well thanks for trying.  I'll poke around some more.
