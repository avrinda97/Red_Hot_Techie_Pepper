2007-04-14T09:54:00.000Z	FreonTrip		Nothing big or system-killing, but I suspect it's holding back my performance.
2007-04-14T09:54:00.000Z	FreonTrip		How do I determine whether my AGP controller is supported?
2007-04-14T09:55:00.000Z	FreonTrip		Anyone?
2007-04-14T09:57:00.000Z	FreonTrip		Can anyone help me determine whether AGP is properly functional on my system?
2007-04-14T09:57:00.000Z	FreonTrip		Installing Flash isn't terribly hard...
2007-04-14T09:58:00.000Z	FreonTrip		...at least not in 7.04.
2007-04-14T09:58:00.000Z	FreonTrip		wj32's got the magic ticket if you can't make it happen elsewise.
2007-04-14T09:59:00.000Z	FreonTrip		No idea about wmode, I'm tech-savvy but new at a lot of this myself.  Can't wait to see what a doofus I look like when I install Slackware on my more powerful system... :-\
2007-04-14T10:00:00.000Z	FreonTrip		:P
2007-04-14T10:01:00.000Z	FreonTrip		I repeat until someone responds directly to the question:  Is there an easy way to determine whether AGP support is properly functional on my system?
