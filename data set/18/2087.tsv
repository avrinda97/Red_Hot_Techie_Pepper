2010-10-18T17:29:00.000Z	feen		Hello. I can't get a connection to the Internet with my Ubuntu machine. It attempts to connect and fails, but it works normally on Windows. Its a wired connection. It has worked before.
2010-10-18T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2010-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	does 8.8.8.8 ping?
2010-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	I could try, but I would have to unplug here to try there... Is there anything else I should do?
2010-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	thats all we need, if it pings then your DNS sucks
2010-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	OK brb
2010-10-18T17:39:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	Back. It does not ping. Tá¸§e error message is ''connect: Network unreachable''
2010-10-18T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	then you are not getting an IP address. Are the lights on the interface flashing ok? and showing link light on the router?
2010-10-18T17:41:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	All lights are flashing. As I said, it is working flawlessly in Windows...
2010-10-18T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	ok then i'd websearch for your wired chip to find guides and/or bug reports
2010-10-18T17:42:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	But it has worked absolutely fine for months. Yesterday I was upgrading to 10.10 and this happened.
2010-10-18T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	yes, you now have a different kernel with different drivers
2010-10-18T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	so you need to take some action
2010-10-18T17:44:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	No, sir. I couldnt complete the upgrade due to this problem...
2010-10-18T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	you may need to compile a driver,or download a package. you can even use ndiswrapper for it
2010-10-18T17:45:00.000Z	feen	ActionParsnip	How am I going to do that whithout a connection?
2010-10-18T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	usb storage / sd card
2010-10-18T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	feen	CD drive / floppy
