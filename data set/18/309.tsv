2012-10-17T21:42:00.000Z	uw		is there a way to get ".." to display in the the file browser?
2012-10-17T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	that is the directory one level up
2012-10-17T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	so you can't see the permissions for the higher directory while you are in the child
2012-10-17T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	you use the up arrow
2012-10-17T21:46:00.000Z	uw	ikonia	up arrow?
2012-10-17T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	in nautilus
2012-10-17T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	can you take a screen shot of what you are seeing
2012-10-17T21:50:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	so the back error should take you back  or "up" a level
2012-10-17T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	I'd suggest not installing dolphin
2012-10-17T21:52:00.000Z	uw	ikonia	when i first open the file browswer, the "back arrow" will be grayed out and cant be used
2012-10-17T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	it will pull in all the KDE dependencies which is quite a lot for a file browser
2012-10-17T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	there must be a setting for "show hidden files" or something which will show . and ..
2012-10-17T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	I'd be very dissapointed if that was not the case, there certainly is on my non-ubuntu nautilus browser
2012-10-17T21:53:00.000Z	uw	ikonia	i have "show hidden files" selected
2012-10-17T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	yeah, I've just tried that in mine, I agree
2012-10-17T21:55:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	go->open parent, a ver ugly solution
2012-10-17T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	uw	go to the "go" menu and then "parent directory"
2012-10-17T21:59:00.000Z	uw	ikonia	yup that works.  how can i get that in one button on the front?  not in a sub menu?
