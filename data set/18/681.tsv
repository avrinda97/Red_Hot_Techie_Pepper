2011-10-27T17:49:00.000Z	Onkeltem		How to configure gnome 3 screencasting?
2011-10-27T17:51:00.000Z	usr13	Onkeltem	I use recordmydesktop
2011-10-27T17:51:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	in gnome 3 there is some builtint mechanizm
2011-10-27T17:53:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	when I pressed that shortcut which start it, gnome-shell shows nothing (record button/icon e.g.), and is restarting in 20-30 seconds. Then I find recorded file in my home.
2011-10-27T17:55:00.000Z	usr13	Onkeltem	May be kind of like the difference between gtk-recordmydesktop and recordmydesktop, one has GUI controls and the other is just CLI
2011-10-27T17:55:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	thanks, I'll try it
2011-10-27T17:56:00.000Z	usr13	Onkeltem	Should be some documentation somewhere.  What is the package name?
2011-10-27T17:57:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	have no idea. It is part of gnome-shell
2011-10-27T17:58:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet
2011-10-27T17:58:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	there you will find all fancy things, including screencasting )
2011-10-27T18:00:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	well, the only "drawback" - it doesn't work for me LOL
2011-10-27T18:00:00.000Z	usr13	Onkeltem	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL1XCvj9VMA
2011-10-27T18:03:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	good! thank you a lot. The guy told in the video - it doesn't work )) I wonder how they are releasing stuff which doesn't work
2011-10-27T18:04:00.000Z	usr13	Onkeltem	I think he was talking about the keyboard shrot-cut (that doesn't work).
2011-10-27T18:05:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	exactly. He showed how to screencast using old good CLI ffmpet + convertor to WebM
2011-10-27T18:06:00.000Z	usr13	Onkeltem	Oh, ok.. Well maybe so. (Maybe it doesn't work.)
2011-10-27T18:09:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	have you tried Kazam?
2011-10-27T18:10:00.000Z	Onkeltem	usr13	worth to try - its good one and very easy to use, still lacking many obvious things
