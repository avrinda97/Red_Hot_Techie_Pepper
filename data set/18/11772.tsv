2006-07-05T07:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		automatix is NOT the best solution
2006-07-05T07:47:00.000Z	Subhuman_	Jack_Sparrow	automatix uses --force
2006-07-05T07:48:00.000Z	Subhuman_	Jack_Sparrow	suggest easysource, it is safer & acomplishes the same thing
2006-07-05T07:48:00.000Z	Subhuman_		!easysource
2006-07-05T07:48:00.000Z	Subhuman_		!easyubuntu
2006-07-05T07:48:00.000Z	Subhuman_		:S
2006-07-05T07:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		easyubuntu is almost as bad.. note the SAME warning
2006-07-05T07:49:00.000Z	Subhuman_	Jack_Sparrow	look at the code of both - easyubuntu is safe.
2006-07-05T07:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		It is not hard to manually install for the nvidia card
2006-07-05T07:49:00.000Z	Subhuman_	Jack_Sparrow	it will not force a package and it returns your source list to normal after.
2006-07-05T07:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Subhuman_	 Too many people still hose up their systems..
2006-07-05T07:51:00.000Z	Subhuman_	Jack_Sparrow	my automatix experience is nowhere near as good as my EU one, EU has NEVER failed on the 10+ ubuntu installs i have done, the 2-3 times ive used automatix have broken things on the suystem
2006-07-05T07:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Subhuman_	Glad it worked for you..  That has NOT been the case for all...  Perhaps that is why the Wiki page has people do it manually
2006-07-05T07:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Subhuman_	and they might learn something in the process
2006-07-05T07:52:00.000Z	Subhuman_	Jack_Sparrow	the wiki obviously will not use third party applications, as it then implies they need to support any issues with that too.
