2006-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	bz0b	The issue is when beta testers expect the same level of support as the release.
2006-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	bz0b	While devs expect (quite rightly), that beta (and developmental) releases are not intended for "newbies" that expect everything to "just work" - it may well, but those users should not expect teh same level of suppot.
2006-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	bz0b	Arafangion	i don't consider myself a newbie, but im not the greatest. like i did my own lfs install, gentoo install and everything worked without anyones help
2006-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	bz0b	Arafangion	so does that qualify me
2006-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	bz0b	Then you are not a newbie. :)
2006-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	bz0b	But my statements still apply.
2006-10-08T07:43:00.000Z	bz0b	Arafangion	ok, cool
2006-10-08T07:44:00.000Z	Arafangion	bz0b	Debian users has a particularly hard time with this, with so many clueless newbies trying to use debian unstable, just because it's got the latest and greatest, and then claiming that it's stable and always works well for them - when it's /not/ stable, heck, named "Sid" after the kid next door who breaks toys.
