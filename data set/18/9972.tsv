2007-10-28T23:06:00.000Z	Pelo	crackhead	 for the rest check here   http://cutlersoftware.com/ubuntuinstall/
2007-10-28T23:09:00.000Z	crackhead	Pelo	that didnt really help, i did extract here, but now i need to install it,
2007-10-28T23:10:00.000Z	Pelo	crackhead	 extracting the tar.gz folder is the first step,  no open a terminal,    cd to the extracted folder,  type ./configure,  install all required dependencies,  then make , then sudo make install
2007-10-28T23:13:00.000Z	Pelo	crackhead	did you cd to the folder first ?

2007-10-28T23:18:00.000Z	Pelo	crackhead	this doesn't seem to be a straight forward compile,  check on the site for installation instructions
