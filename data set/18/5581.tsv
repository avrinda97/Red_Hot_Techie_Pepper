2008-10-14T11:48:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd		Is this question OK? How to download yahoo music video?
2008-10-14T11:48:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	is it something like streaming music playing?? like lastfm?
2008-10-14T11:51:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	I cann't find the streaming url site for the music
2008-10-14T11:51:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	give me a link to see
2008-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	and there would be three cache files under SHOME/.mozilla/firefox/ryrqd4it.default/Cache
2008-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	The reason is because yahoo music video use NEW flash protocol which is hidden NOW
2008-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	do i need registration to play anything?
2008-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	Now.
2008-10-14T11:55:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	 You can watch that without registeration
2008-10-14T11:55:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	these are videos!
2008-10-14T11:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	Yes, music video.
2008-10-14T11:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	But there should be some hidden  streaming video files
2008-10-14T11:58:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	i cant see it somewhere in the source code. you can install downloadhelper for firefox and try your luck with its options. so far, downloadhelper does not "see" the video
2008-10-14T12:00:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	what is complicated?
2008-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	well you willl install a tiny firefox addon! big deal!
2008-10-14T12:03:00.000Z	jim_p	ubuntu_todd	thry downloadhelper!
2008-10-14T12:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	I am doing right now.
2008-10-14T12:10:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	jim_p	the Downloadhelper is gray  when I opened the video. But it works fine when I open the video in youtube.
