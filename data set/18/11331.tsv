2006-08-12T08:40:00.000Z	munsa		I think I messed with some settings in Mplayer
2006-08-12T08:40:00.000Z	munsa		hehe

2006-08-12T08:40:00.000Z	munsa		but I cant figure out what I did wrong
2006-08-12T08:41:00.000Z	Thunderous	munsa	if its something u have done, you could remove .mplayer from your home dir and have a fresh copy
2006-08-12T08:41:00.000Z	munsa	zipper_	how do I change it? I think I was playing around and messed something up.  I used Mplayer from CL but GMplayer dosent work eather its some sort of codev problem
2006-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	munsa		I suppose, But I think it is just some sort of setting I messed up
2006-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	Thunderous	munsa	then delete .mplayer from ur home dir
2006-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	munsa		Anyone know a good Chess Program ?
2006-08-12T08:43:00.000Z	munsa		yea
2006-08-12T08:43:00.000Z	munsa		ok
2006-08-12T08:44:00.000Z	munsa		if I sudo apt-get install mplayer will it overwrite the one I have there now? Or should I remove it firsT?
2006-08-12T08:44:00.000Z	munsa		Whats the command for delete?
2006-08-12T08:44:00.000Z	munsa		remove
2006-08-12T08:44:00.000Z	Thunderous	munsa	all you have to do is open a console and type 'rm .mplayer' and u will have a default fresh copy next time you start it
