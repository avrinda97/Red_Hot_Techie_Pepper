2009-08-29T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	what video card are you using ?
2009-08-29T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	what make ?
2009-08-29T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	no - what make is the video card
2009-08-29T17:53:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	do you know how to use a pastebin
2009-08-29T17:53:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	check out that link, do you think you can use that ?
2009-08-29T17:54:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	open up a terminal from applications -> accessories -> terminal menu and type "lspci" then use the pastebin link to show me the output
2009-08-29T17:55:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	does that make sense ?
2009-08-29T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	lets see
2009-08-29T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	looks fine
2009-08-29T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	I'm sorry to say I do
2009-08-29T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	you're using a Silicon Intergrated System (SIS) video card, these have very very bad support in the Xorg xserver, and even worse 3d support,
2009-08-29T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	there are specific Xorg configurations for the SIS video card drivers but to even have a chance of it working you have to do a fair bit of research
2009-08-29T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	9 times out of 10 it never works
2009-08-29T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	a better supported card is always going to be a better option
2009-08-29T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	budtoka	I'm sorry it's not more positive
