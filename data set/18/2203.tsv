2010-07-21T17:33:00.000Z	Guest55021		My wireless mouse 'pauses' and becomes unresponsive for periods ranging from 1 to 3 seconds, then begins working normally again. It doesn't seem to matter if there has been a period of inactivity. Sometimes in the middle of using it, it just pauses for a second or two.
2010-07-21T17:35:00.000Z	Guest55021		It is plugged into its very own usb channel (by itself in a pair).
2010-07-21T17:36:00.000Z	Guest55021		I spoke to logitech and as expected, as soon as I said linux they politely said they couldn't help me.

2010-07-21T17:47:00.000Z	Guest55021	violinappren	- That is correct.
2010-07-21T17:47:00.000Z	Guest55021	violinappren	- Yes - It is a logitech MX 1100 (replacing an MX Revolution whcih is very similar).
2010-07-21T17:51:00.000Z	Guest55021	violinappren	- Any ideas?
2010-07-21T17:52:00.000Z	violinappren	Guest55021	i suspect it's a bluetooth issue
2010-07-21T17:53:00.000Z	Guest55021	violinappren	- The box says it is a 2.4 GHz wireless. I don't think bluetooth is involved.
2010-07-21T17:53:00.000Z	violinappren	Guest55021	aha interesting
2010-07-21T17:54:00.000Z	Guest55021	violinappren	- I have another MX Revolution on the same desk for a computer 6 feet away from the other one. It is connected to a Windows 7 machine and does not display the behavior. I have disconnected the receiver and turned off the mouse but it did not help.
2010-07-21T17:55:00.000Z	violinappren	Guest55021	i suggest you report this as a bug
