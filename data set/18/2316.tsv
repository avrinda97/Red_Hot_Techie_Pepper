2010-06-21T21:30:00.000Z	bjarni		Hi.  I have ubuntu 9.10 64 bit, gnome.   Some webpages take ages to download.   Pages seem to stop downloading in some cases for a good while before continuing.  Pressing reload often helps.  Applies to Chrome and Epiphany and did with Firefox before I threw it out.  I'm on wireless.  Direct connection is better but not good at all.  Can someone point me in the right direction here?
2010-06-21T21:31:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	try going to the terminal and type ping google.com and see how your connection is
2010-06-21T21:33:00.000Z	bjarni	Krazyderek	Seems ok.  No packet loss, below 70ms.
2010-06-21T21:34:00.000Z	Krazyderek		70's is starting to get a little high
2010-06-21T21:34:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	is that on wireless?
2010-06-21T21:34:00.000Z	bjarni	Krazyderek	yes
2010-06-21T21:34:00.000Z	Krazyderek		yah
2010-06-21T21:35:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	try wired to see if it goes down
2010-06-21T21:40:00.000Z	bjarni	Krazyderek	My beloved son left my cable at friends house.  Can't check it right now.  But I'm a bit far from Google.  Domestic ping around 16ms.
2010-06-21T21:41:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	is it just specific webpages that are slow to load or even one's with a good ping?
2010-06-21T21:46:00.000Z	bjarni		Krazderek: Some pages are good.  Pages with alot of images are often bad.  Sometimes (too often) pages seem to choke on css.  Pages are displayed without formatting sometimes and pages with heavy css seem to be troublesome even if there are not many images.  I've tried to disable and remove flash completely with no effect
2010-06-21T21:47:00.000Z	bjarni		That was for Krazyderek
2010-06-21T21:50:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	have isolated the problem to the one machine on your local network to rule out your internet connection / router ?
2010-06-21T21:54:00.000Z	bjarni	Krazyderek	This machine is the only linux machine on the net.  I've experimented with all other machines shut down.  I have tried most suggestions to network tuning I've found (mru etc) in vain.  What troubles me is that it happens on all browser I've tried.  What's common to them?  Since reloading pages often helps I thought maybe it could be some cache problem.  Or - some problems loading from mediaservers?
2010-06-21T21:56:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	i doubt you'd have caching problems across multiple browsers... i've had problems with firefox not working with very specific pages unless i press reload multipl times but it was always limited to that browser
2010-06-21T22:00:00.000Z	bjarni	Krazyderek	Sipior: dns is under 16ms away.  I think it is cached in the router but not sure
2010-06-21T22:03:00.000Z	bjarni		Sipior: This seems good advice.  I'll check on this - but I gotta run now.  I'll get back to you later if that's ok
2010-06-21T22:06:00.000Z	Krazyderek	bjarni	good luck
