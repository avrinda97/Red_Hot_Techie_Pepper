2006-11-07T10:38:00.000Z	nothlit	bimberi	lol ok, what framebuffer does ubuntu use as a default, and how would i go about accelerating it if i have an nvidia comp, also is it true that vesafb doesn't go over vga=791
2006-11-07T10:39:00.000Z	bimberi	nothlit	geez, that's a bit of a leap.  no idea sorry :)
2006-11-07T10:39:00.000Z	bimberi	nothlit	although there is this ...
2006-11-07T10:39:00.000Z	nothlit	bimberi	hmm... is there a utility to easily set up libvga, and why does directfb not work
2006-11-07T10:39:00.000Z	nothlit	bimberi	lol don't worry, i wasn't gonna bother with those questions, you just said keep them coming :P

2006-12-02T15:15:00.000Z	nothlit	bimberi	i would feel safer with su -c then sudo myself, different password and permissions don't hang around for 15 minutes
