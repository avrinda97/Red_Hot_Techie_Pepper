2008-04-07T19:01:00.000Z	cusco		hello
2008-04-07T19:01:00.000Z	cusco		would somebody please take a look at this dependency problem?
2008-04-07T19:01:00.000Z	cusco		pasted here: http://www.paste.la/658
2008-04-07T19:02:00.000Z	cusco		that is teh output from apt-get install -f
2008-04-07T19:03:00.000Z	sami	cusco	have you tried apt-get clean and dpkg --configure -a
2008-04-07T19:03:00.000Z	cusco	sami	hold
2008-04-07T19:05:00.000Z	cusco	sami	yes it comes back to the same errors while configuring
2008-04-07T19:06:00.000Z	sami	cusco	What were you trying to install?
2008-04-07T19:08:00.000Z	cusco	sami	its not me its a friend of mine, he was apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop
2008-04-07T19:09:00.000Z	sami	cusco	Great going. apt-get autoremove
2008-04-07T19:09:00.000Z	cusco	sami	he alreadi did that... the packages are unpacked
2008-04-07T19:09:00.000Z	sami	cusco	Never delete kubuntu-desktop.
2008-04-07T19:10:00.000Z	sami	cusco	It has deps down to the kernel-image
2008-04-07T19:11:00.000Z	cusco	sami	what do you advise now?
2008-04-07T19:11:00.000Z	sami	cusco	I would recommend a complete reinstall acctually. There is too much work to fix that.
2008-04-07T19:15:00.000Z	cusco	sami	difference between apt-get and aptitude, apt-get does not remove nor install the recommended packages
2008-04-07T19:15:00.000Z	cusco	sami	that should not be a problem really
2008-04-07T19:16:00.000Z	sami	cusco	Well while you remove meta packages that depend on other packages as a mata should do. It should prompt you for a [Y/n] check box if you want to remove deps or now.
