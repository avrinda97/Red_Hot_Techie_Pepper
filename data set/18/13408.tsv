2005-12-16T16:55:00.000Z	aSt3raL		ok https://wiki.ubuntu.com//Rt2500WirelessCardsHowTo/
2005-12-16T16:55:00.000Z	aSt3raL		i did all that
2005-12-16T16:55:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	the module is trying to write to a file, and the file already exists.  You have to locate and delete the file.
2005-12-17T17:15:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	the module is the driver
2005-12-17T17:15:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	the rest should happen automatically when the hardware is detected.
2006-08-23T09:55:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	what happens?
2006-09-01T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	you added the directory to /etc/exports, and ran exportfs?
2006-09-01T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	you started NFS server on the exporting machine?
2006-09-01T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	it's mounted, you can't see it, but you can't umount it?
2006-09-01T08:29:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	you might try the root_squash option, that can produce odd behavior
2006-09-01T08:29:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	ok...
2006-09-01T08:29:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	it's easy to change, so try it.  As I said I've seen that option cause odd behavior.
2006-09-01T08:30:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	what happens when you try to umount?
2006-09-01T08:30:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	any log messages on the server side?
2006-09-01T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	aSt3raL	a stuck umount is one of te few things that frequently can only be cleared by a reboot
