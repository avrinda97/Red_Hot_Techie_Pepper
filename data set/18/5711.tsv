2008-09-03T20:02:00.000Z	Homicide		wow, that's a lot of people.
2008-09-03T20:02:00.000Z	Homicide		Anyone know what would cause me to be unable to update to 8.04 from 7.10 via update manager?
2008-09-03T20:02:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	use sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and tell us what the errors is it spits out
2008-09-03T20:04:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	no error of any sort visible.
2008-09-03T20:07:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/43071/ is all I get.
2008-09-03T20:08:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	apt-cacjhe policy libc6
2008-09-03T20:09:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/43075/
2008-09-03T20:09:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	you are still on gutsy. change your sources.list
2008-09-03T20:10:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	could you elaborate further or provide a link? I'm still fairly new to the whole linux thing.
2008-09-03T20:16:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	sudo apt-get update; apt-cache policy libc6    needs to say "hardy" somewhere. if it does, then you're done and can upgrade
2008-09-03T20:17:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	I see no mention of 'hardy' in any form.
2008-09-03T20:17:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	cause your sources.list doesn't have them either
2008-09-03T20:18:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	to be honest, I've nothing to lose on this system as-is. Should I just reinstall 7.10 and then immediately upgrade to 8.04?
2008-09-03T20:18:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	no. reinstalling is a windows user solution
2008-09-03T20:18:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and replace "gutsy" with "hardy"
2008-09-03T20:18:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	on it.
2008-09-03T20:19:00.000Z	wols_	Homicide	if you fsck up you break it all, but then it's at least a learning experience
2008-09-03T20:32:00.000Z	Homicide	wols_	i don't know why, but that worked. thank you and good day :D
