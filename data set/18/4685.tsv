2010-01-08T07:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	i think 32bit Ubuntu "should" be able to see up to 3.2GB memory (not sure though) -- AMD64 will also work for Intel 64bit CPUs as well.
2010-01-08T07:09:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	faileas,  so it will not mess with anything but my time TRYING to use the AMD64 iso ?
2010-01-08T07:09:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		LOL
2010-01-08T07:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	does "lscpu" show x86_64 for architecture?
2010-01-08T07:13:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		 ZykoticK9, I got   bash: lscpu: command not found
2010-01-08T07:13:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		  
2010-01-08T07:14:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		 faileas, Thank you ... nothing ventured, nothing gained ... I just did not want to fry my primary box !!
2010-01-08T07:14:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	what am I missing there ...?
2010-01-08T07:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	perhaps lscpu is only on 9.10 - what version you using?
2010-01-08T07:15:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	9.04
2010-01-08T07:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	on older versions you can use "cat /proc/cpuinfo" but it doesn't have such a nice clean answer to "is my cpu 64 bit"
2010-01-08T07:17:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	how about his ?  clflush size : 64
2010-01-08T07:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	not the same thing!  you'd have to google the CPU name to verify that it is 64bit
2010-01-08T07:18:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	model name : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E4500  @ 2.20GHz
2010-01-08T07:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	i'm "pretty" sure all the Core2Duo's are infact 64 bit
2010-01-08T07:19:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	THAT was also MY understanding
2010-01-08T07:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Don_Miguel	yup it's 64bit (so AMD64 would work for ya) http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2duo/specifications.htm?iid=prod_core2duo+tab_spec
2010-01-08T07:22:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	ZykoticK9	THANK YOU ... I will download the AMD64.iso .. and install tomorrow night !!
