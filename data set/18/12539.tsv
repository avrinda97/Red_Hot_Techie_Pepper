2007-01-07T09:01:00.000Z	jakob		how does ubuntu differentiate between files without file extensions?
2007-01-07T09:02:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	it examines the contents. see the file command :)
2007-01-07T09:02:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	file command?
2007-01-07T09:03:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	yea. its a command you can use to recognise what type of file a file is, without an extension. its the same system that your desktop uses.
2007-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	if I create a text file how do I tell ubuntu that it's a script?
2007-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	it will recognise it by the contents in the file and its file name
2007-01-07T09:05:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	so should I add an extension to ie. "myscript"?
2007-01-07T09:05:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	what type of script is it? bash script?
2007-01-07T09:06:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	no idea what that is, but it sounds like a batch file. But this is what I want in the script "sudo ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/lirc | sudo lircd"
2007-01-07T09:06:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	in which case you need to put a shebang at the top of the file: #!/bin/sh
2007-01-07T09:07:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	then the desktop should recognise it as a script
2007-01-07T09:07:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	a shebang?
2007-01-07T09:07:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	lol. thats what its called *shrug*
2007-01-07T09:08:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	how do I add that?
2007-01-07T09:08:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	open the script in a text editor and add it as a new line to the top
2007-01-07T09:08:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	ah, get it now.. Where should I put this script if I want it to run when I boot?
2007-01-07T09:09:00.000Z	mooey	jakob	hm. i guess in /etc/init.d/ and then link it properly but im not sure about that
2007-01-07T09:10:00.000Z	jakob	mooey	I thought the init.d was just commands.. I'll give it a try
