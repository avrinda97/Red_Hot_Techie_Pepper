2005-03-13T11:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	what is the problem?
2005-03-13T11:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	you will possibly have to reconfigure your x, I'd imagine.
2005-03-13T11:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	do you know whether you are using xfree or xorg?
2005-03-13T11:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	you can use the command: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2005-03-13T11:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	also, please be careful with refresh rates. Not sure about xfree, but with xorg there's the potential to permanently damage your monitor, afaik.
2005-03-13T11:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	it certainly does. :P
2005-03-13T12:01:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	it does give options like the video card, driver, keyboard, mouse but not about an external monitor
2005-03-13T12:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	Oh, I know there's no option about *external* monitor, but I think it does ask there for the name of your monitor. I imagine that's how it would happen; I would have thought you'd have to make some changes in bios essentially.
2005-03-13T12:02:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	no it doesn't even ask about the name of the monitor
2005-03-13T12:03:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	I thought I need to change /ets/X11/XFconfig-4
2005-03-13T12:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	that setup changes that file
2005-03-13T12:03:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	but I don't really know what to put in that file
2005-03-13T12:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	hmm, you're right. There is no monitor setup there; I'm getting confused with xorg reconfigure.
2005-03-13T12:04:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	it does but doesn't change it the way i need it to
2005-03-13T12:07:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	any other suggestions???
2005-03-13T12:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	hedu	Hmm, I see you haven't had much luck on the forums there either. Though, there's a previous thread there. You might have some luck searching on the linuxquestions.org forums. Sorry I can't be of more help here.
2005-03-13T12:08:00.000Z	hedu	apokryphos	: thanks anyways; which thread do you mean?
