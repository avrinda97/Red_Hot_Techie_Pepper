2004-10-03T07:32:00.000Z	Se7h		grrrr
2004-10-03T07:32:00.000Z	Se7h		i'm getting the dependencies stuff again
2004-10-03T07:34:00.000Z	Se7h		forget it
2004-10-03T07:34:00.000Z	Se7h		it is
2004-10-03T07:34:00.000Z	Se7h		tcl8.4 is already the newest version.
2004-10-03T07:35:00.000Z	Se7h		checking whether the Tcl system has changed... yes
2004-10-03T07:35:00.000Z	Se7h		configure: error:
2004-10-03T07:35:00.000Z	Se7h		  Tcl cannot be found on this system.
2004-10-03T07:35:00.000Z	Se7h		yeah but i get that
2004-10-03T07:35:00.000Z	Se7h		what is the path to it ?
2004-10-03T07:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	which tcl ?
2004-10-03T07:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	tcl header != tcl library
2004-10-03T07:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	you'll probably need  apt-cache search tcl header
2004-10-13T12:53:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	does it tell you why if you try to run it from the command line?
2004-10-13T13:00:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	what did you do before it broke?
2004-10-13T13:00:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	did you break of an upgrade that was halfway through?
2004-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	Se7h	Treenaks	just installed java
2004-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	Treenaks	Se7h	then that's the problem..
