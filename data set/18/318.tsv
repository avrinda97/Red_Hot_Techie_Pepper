2012-04-23T13:41:00.000Z	faustische		How do I set up Debian to mount iPod folders like Ubuntu. I mean Ubuntu mounts to filesystems for a jailbroken iPod, one for system folders and one for application folders.
2012-04-23T13:41:00.000Z	faustische		I have installed the following packages: libmtp8 libmtp-dev libusb-dev libusb-0.1-4
2012-04-23T13:41:00.000Z	faustische		But Debian only opens my photos folder
2012-04-23T13:43:00.000Z	faustische		Ubuntu 11.10 fails to mount my iPod, what's wrong?
2012-04-23T13:43:00.000Z	faustische		There used to be a command to fix this
2012-04-23T13:43:00.000Z	faustische		"tie" or something like that

2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	faustische	ikonia	oh no, the Ubuntu support is greater than Windows'
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	faustische	no, it's not
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	faustische	ikonia	yes it is, if you have a jailbroken ipod
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	faustische	apple devices have support in windows through itunes, no linux is supported for apple devives
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	faustische	ikonia	I've been syncing and transferring files to my iPad and iPod on Ubuntu for years
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	faustische	ikonia	jailbroken ipod, of course
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	faustische	it's not "better" supported, in linux if you think it is, great, good for you, byt you will have problems
2012-04-23T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	faustische	you've been working for years...yet as I've just said it's changed since ios 5
2012-04-23T13:45:00.000Z	faustische	ikonia	wrong!
2012-04-23T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	faustische	then if I am wrong you should have no problems with your ipod and not be asking questions about why it doesn't work
