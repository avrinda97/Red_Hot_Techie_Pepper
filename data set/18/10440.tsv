2008-12-03T04:23:00.000Z	SJrX		IT's Intrepid Ibex
2008-12-03T04:23:00.000Z	SJrX		Dapper is a LONG time old
2008-12-03T04:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	but still lts supported
2008-12-03T04:24:00.000Z	SJrX		Dapper Drake, Feighsty Fawn, Gutsy Gibbon, Hardy Herron, Intrepid Ibex
2008-12-03T04:24:00.000Z	SJrX	Jack_Sparrow	yeah that doesn't make it not old
2008-12-03T04:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	agreed
2008-12-03T04:24:00.000Z	SJrX		LTS just means security updates, the actual packages don't seem to change drastically
2008-12-03T04:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	exactly
2008-12-03T04:24:00.000Z	SJrX		I got rid of my dapper box a few weeks ago, since I was tired of PHP 5.1.4
2008-12-03T04:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	the user has no issues with 6.06 other than wanting to write to ntfs drive
2008-12-03T04:25:00.000Z	SJrX		Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't say they should move forward with every release
2008-12-03T04:25:00.000Z	SJrX		but I don't see any benefit in staying with an older LTS release
2008-12-03T04:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	A topic more suited to offtopic
2008-12-03T04:26:00.000Z	SJrX		How is it OT?
2008-12-03T04:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	If you were reading, he cannot get the newer buntus to install on his 450 mhz with limited ram
2008-12-03T04:26:00.000Z	SJrX		Hmmmm, I wasn't advising an upgrade, I just answered, and was talking with someone.
2008-12-03T04:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SJrX	ot as in discussion, not support
