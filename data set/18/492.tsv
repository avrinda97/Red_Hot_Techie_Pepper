2012-01-28T13:57:00.000Z	jdhfr		how to change language in console (with k..desktop)?
2012-01-28T13:59:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	Sorry, what exactly do you want to change? Your GUI's language or the language of CLI program output? If the latter, use "LANG=languagecode command", if the former, use your GUI's config tools
2012-01-28T14:00:00.000Z	jdhfr	theadmin	keyboard language, isn't that clear?
2012-01-28T14:00:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	No it wasn't. Keyboard for X or plain console?
2012-01-28T14:00:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	I mean, are you running X? If so, "setxkbmap languagecode". If not, "loadkeys languagecode".
2012-01-28T14:01:00.000Z	jdhfr	theadmin	full screen console
2012-01-28T14:01:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	Likely loadkeys, then. Try both and see which works, lol
2012-01-28T14:03:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	loadkeys your_language_code, e.g. "loadkeys fr" or "loadkeys ru" or "loadkeys de" or such
2012-01-28T14:04:00.000Z	jdhfr	theadmin	it says 'permissions denied' in hundred lines or so
2012-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	Ah, sorry, that needs root: sudo loadkeys whatever
2012-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	jdhfr	theadmin	and how to switch them now?
2012-01-28T14:27:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	Sorry, switch? Just loadkeys again, I, uh, don't think plain console offers switching between layouts in a sane way
2012-01-28T14:34:00.000Z	jdhfr	theadmin	i cannot, I just changed keyboard
2012-01-28T14:40:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	(s)he's wanting to switch a keyboard layout
2012-01-28T14:43:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	Well, you asked how to switch and I answered, what's the problem?
2012-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	It usually does. If you have a bad sound card, it's your fault :P
2012-01-28T16:00:00.000Z	theadmin	jdhfr	You mean system sounds? Who wants those anyway?
