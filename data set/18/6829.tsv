2008-06-26T05:51:00.000Z	Dunas		I just installed Ubuntu, installed the system updates, then installed a driver for my Nvidia 7600 (I believe it is) with no trouble. I restarted. Now my Acer P191w widescreen LCD monitor is saying input not supported once I get past the log-in screen. How do I fix this? Do I need to reinstall and do something differently to get it to support that graphics card without glitching up the monitor?
2008-06-26T05:51:00.000Z	Dunas		Erk
2008-06-26T05:51:00.000Z	Dunas		7100
2008-06-26T05:53:00.000Z	Dunas		Aaagh
2008-06-26T05:55:00.000Z	Dunas		Google hates me, so... is there a way to install the driver/configuration disc that came with an Acer 1440x900/19'' monitor into Ubuntu?

2008-06-26T05:57:00.000Z	Dunas		I'm pretty much in the dark with Ubuntu, but I'd really love to get this working- this one thing is keeping it from being my dream OS, pretty much.
2008-06-26T05:59:00.000Z	Dunas		If I could, I would, but I can't see a thing past the login screen.
2008-06-26T05:59:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Dunas	have you tried not installing drivers for the nvidia and just using the restricted drivers?
2008-06-26T05:59:00.000Z	Dunas	SeaPhor	That's what I did, the restricted drivers.
2008-06-26T06:01:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Dunas	i cna help you get back to start, without re-installing, but you will need to know what to do from there, as i haven't had any problems with any of my nvidia cards, and i have from 5200 to 8600
2008-06-26T06:02:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Dunas	*can
2008-06-26T06:03:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Dunas	and looks like RAdams may have the better approach
2008-06-26T06:04:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Dunas	if you need me i'll be in #SeaPhor
2008-06-26T06:05:00.000Z	Dunas	SeaPhor	Thank you.
2008-06-26T06:05:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Dunas	no worries bro
