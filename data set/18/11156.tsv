2006-09-03T11:13:00.000Z	lostboyz		has anyone here compared ubuntu with SUSE?
2006-09-03T11:13:00.000Z	lostboyz		ok
2006-09-03T11:13:00.000Z	lostboyz		what are your thoughts
2006-09-03T11:14:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	go to #ubuntu-offtopic, ultimately the answer is going to be depends on preference as all of these things are
2006-09-22T08:19:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	you have two home folders one on a different partition?
2006-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	ok, does the suse folder have your the same username folder as that might pose a problem
2006-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	should i still be old user?
2006-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	should i add old user name? or keep new user name?
2006-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	I don't think it is a good idea to try to mount the other home folder instead. Why not copy over the stuff you want from the old home folder. There are bound to be some issues doing it the way you are trying
2006-09-22T08:22:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	Why not just mount the other partition but not as the home folder and then just use it for storage
2006-09-22T08:23:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	i want to use old one for home
2006-09-22T08:24:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	can i copy config files
2006-09-22T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	yeah you could do it. I see now what you are trying.
2006-09-22T08:24:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	do you know how to do that?
2006-09-22T08:25:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	do you know how?
2006-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	I assume there will be system inconsistencies
2006-09-22T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	lostboyz	get into the directory with all the .files, it would be your username folder and do rm -tf .*
2006-09-22T08:40:00.000Z	lostboyz	bruenig	how do i create a zip backup
