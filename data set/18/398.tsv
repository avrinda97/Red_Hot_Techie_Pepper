2012-05-29T11:50:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Oh. Did that.
2012-05-29T11:50:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		No dice, unfortunately.
2012-05-29T11:52:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Is there a way to boot to terminal from GRUB?
2012-05-29T11:54:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Ah. Gotcha.
2012-05-29T11:56:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	you might have to chroot in from a live cd, hard to say here if the usb connects are not working.
2012-05-29T11:57:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	A half finished fresh installs sound like a reinstall to be honest.
2012-05-29T11:58:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	Fyodorovna	it was an upgrade, actually.
2012-05-29T11:58:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Should've been more clear.
2012-05-29T11:58:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		I think so.
2012-05-29T11:59:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	you might be able to get in with a chroot and run sudo dpkg --configure -a and this  sudo apt-get -f install  the second may finish the update.
2012-05-29T12:00:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		upgrade*
2012-05-29T12:00:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	you would not need the sudo though a chroot is root
2012-05-29T12:01:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	Fyodorovna	pepee: OK. I guess I'll try to get in with a chroot.
2012-05-29T12:05:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	would you like a link for the chroot?
2012-05-29T12:05:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	Fyodorovna	that'd be great.
2012-05-29T12:06:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	this is for reloading grub but once you are in just try the commands, not sure what the other user suggested I have been on the UF as well.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing
2012-05-29T12:07:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ForSpareParts	the chroot is in the right menu.
2012-05-29T12:09:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	Fyodorovna	so I want to get to grubs command line/rescue and chroot from there?
