2011-07-16T01:25:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	exutux	I've tried that once before, but it didn't seem to work. Maybe I should try it again?
2011-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	you need to delete alla entries and reboot
2011-07-16T01:28:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	exutux	Which file?

2011-07-16T01:28:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
2011-07-16T01:29:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	exutux	edbian: okay, I'm gonna try deleting the entries and rebooting, if it doesn't work I'll be back ina  few minutes. Thanks for the help!
2011-07-16T01:34:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	are you sure that you are deleting alla entries?
2011-07-16T01:37:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	device names depends on the drivers, i have too my wifi interface called eth1
2011-07-16T01:38:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	but isn't a problem
2011-07-16T01:38:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	exutux	I know, it's KERNEL value in its entry says it's for ethernet even though it successfully creates a wifi connection.
2011-07-16T01:39:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	ahve you tried it now?
2011-07-16T01:39:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	I have no problem with that tools and eth1
2011-07-16T01:41:00.000Z	exutux	aidan_follestad	you need to use airmon-ng befor...get down your wifi card and restart with airmon-ng it change it in mon0 or something else
2011-07-16T01:41:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	exutux	But if I type "airmon-ng" alone, the only interface is displays is eth1.
