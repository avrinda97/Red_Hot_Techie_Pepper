2005-07-04T06:39:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	a box is a computer
2005-07-04T06:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	if you'd like, I can post my sources.list and you can use it
2005-07-04T06:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	perhaps you should read an install guide rather than asking us every single thing
2005-07-04T06:55:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	all OSs can play nicely with eachother over a network or the internet
2005-07-06T08:06:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	what sort of restrictions do you want to ..   lol, I don't grade a distro by what it restricts me from doing
2005-07-06T08:06:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	Oh I know, NO distro!  Then you can't do anything!
2005-07-06T08:13:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	red hat sucks.  I'd say try Fedora instead
2005-07-06T08:16:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	LinuxNewbie	then you're not being specific enough.  And what you want can probably be accomplished with scripts
