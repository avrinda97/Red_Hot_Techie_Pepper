2010-03-09T03:43:00.000Z	bjj_blue		ah, so should it be 540 x ?
2010-03-09T03:45:00.000Z	red	bjj_blue	1980x1080 == HD resolution for most devices
2010-03-09T03:45:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 thanks!
2010-03-09T03:45:00.000Z	red		for most 720p tellys its 1360x768
2010-03-09T03:46:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 and this is everywhere in the world?  I'm in the U.S. in case it matters
2010-03-09T03:46:00.000Z	red		should be that, but u can always check ur tellys manual. it should be stated there aswell
2010-03-09T03:46:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 yeah finding the manual is the tricky part =)
2010-03-09T03:46:00.000Z	red	bjj_blue	remember to check what the native refresh rate of the television is. usually ubuntu tries to set it to 60hz for me, and my telly is 50hz, it will work but u get tearing while playing
2010-03-09T03:46:00.000Z	red	bjj_blue	what manufacturer?
2010-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 Advent
2010-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	red		meh, never heard of them :)
2010-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 never heard of it until i picked up the tv second hand yesterday lol
2010-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	red		have you checked if they have manuals at the website?
2010-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	red	bjj_blue	also, do you use a HDMI cable to connect to your television? some televisions have more than 1 HDMI port, and when so, the other one might be for DVD players and such, and when you plug a pc into such port there might be fuzzy image and a lot overscan
2010-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 no, i'm trying to do this via DVI
2010-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	bjj_blue		there's no HDMI cable. it's an older tv
2010-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	red		aight
2010-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	bjj_blue	red	 actually, i think it's CRT based
