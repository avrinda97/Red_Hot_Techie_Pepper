2012-01-22T07:16:00.000Z	jeremiah_		I want to install a few things to my pc (xubuntu 8.10) but nothing works.
2012-01-22T07:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	8.10 is end of life.
2012-01-22T07:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	basically not supported.
2012-01-22T07:19:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	10.04 is the long term release or the latest yes.
2012-01-22T07:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	every release before 10.04 is eol
2012-01-22T07:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	it is hmmmm.
2012-01-22T07:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	I started on open source so I didn't have any MS background or any really that probably helped
2012-01-22T07:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	how long you been working on linux and how often?
2012-01-22T07:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	took me 6 months to not delete the wrong stuff and I had no computer experience, give it time.
2012-01-22T08:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1599293
2012-01-22T08:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	you can install with just a ISO the link has the instructions.
2012-01-22T08:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	if you post on the ubuntu forums the person who made that thread will probably get you set up.
2012-01-22T08:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	give me the link to the page.
2012-01-23T01:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	jeremiah_	after you were informed of eol yesterday you don't mention your running one shame on you.
