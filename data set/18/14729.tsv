2007-11-07T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	  http://vsftpd.beasts.org/#features
2007-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	 it has about every function a ftp server can have..
2007-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	 ftp://vsftpd.beasts.org/users/cevans/untar/vsftpd-2.0.5/EXAMPLE/README  mentions that
2007-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	 they proberly got functions you havent even dreamed of. :)
2007-11-07T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	 a ftp SERVER does not have a guy. There may be some front ends to it. I dont know.
2007-11-07T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	 and i imagine to get full customization/use of it - you will need to use the shell and manually edit the various config files.
2007-11-07T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	 if all else fails thers a webmin interface to vsftp -->  http://www.debianadmin.com/fast-and-secure-ftp-server-with-vsftpd-in-debian.html
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	TW_	  you use the package manager normally to install stuff. theres no NEED to install the source from the programs homepage
