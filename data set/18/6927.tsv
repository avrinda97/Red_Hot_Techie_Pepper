2008-03-02T08:34:00.000Z	draicone		Is there anyway to upgrade feisty to gutsy using the ISO?
2008-03-02T08:35:00.000Z	draicone		My burner's broken and I'm trying to avoid downloading another 700mb
2008-03-02T08:35:00.000Z	draicone		With another 663mb download, yes, I can upgrade using the update manager. But I've got the ISO here, so I don't see why I shouldn't use it.
2008-03-02T08:36:00.000Z	draicone		I've tried mounting it but I can't mount it anywhere in /media
2008-03-02T08:36:00.000Z	draicone		No functioning burner =P
2008-03-02T08:36:00.000Z	draicone		Actually, wait, I can mount it to /media/cdrom1
2008-03-02T08:37:00.000Z	draicone		It just doesn't recognise the disc or autorun whatever it should
2008-03-02T08:37:00.000Z	cens0red	draicone	yah, just download the "alternate" disk, mount it as an iso, and use it to upgrade.
2008-03-02T08:37:00.000Z	cens0red		worked for me.
2008-03-02T08:37:00.000Z	draicone	cens0red	I don't think I have the "alternate" disk
2008-03-02T08:37:00.000Z	cens0red	draicone	just download the image. then mount it.
2008-03-02T08:37:00.000Z	draicone		What does the update manager do - just upgrade all the packages?
2008-03-02T08:38:00.000Z	draicone	cens0red	I've got the normal image, just not the alternate one
2008-03-02T08:38:00.000Z	cens0red	draicone	yeah.
2008-03-02T08:38:00.000Z	cens0red	draicone	you can't download the alternate one?
2008-03-02T08:38:00.000Z	draicone		If I do that I might as well use the upgrade manager
2008-03-02T08:38:00.000Z	draicone		And download another 700mb
2008-03-02T08:39:00.000Z	cens0red	draicone	upgrade managers worked fine for me, on the last two upgrades I've done.
