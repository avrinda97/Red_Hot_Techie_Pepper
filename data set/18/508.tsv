2012-10-02T22:01:00.000Z	Doxin		what's the idiom for compiling something in a build dir? I recal cding to the build dir and then invoking make in the source dir somehow. anyone got any pointers?
2012-10-02T22:02:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 what  are you using ? cmake autotools ?
2012-10-02T22:03:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	i'm not quite sure, it's not my code.
2012-10-02T22:04:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	what I'd usually do is just ./configure; make;
2012-10-02T22:04:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 it is good to keep the build dir clean for when you want to package easy way with cmake would be to go to source dir and mkdir build ; cd build  ; cmake ../  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path_were_it_installs       then you can clean up with a simple rm build
2012-10-02T22:05:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 where did you get the code ?
2012-10-02T22:05:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 can I see the it ?
2012-10-02T22:05:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	trying to compile gcc at the moment if it helps
2012-10-02T22:05:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	so ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/mirror/languages/gcc/releases/gcc-4.7.2/gcc-4.7.2.tar.bz2 [large download]
2012-10-02T22:07:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 you can install from repo  and  sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
2012-10-02T22:11:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 just set up the confiure file to install to where you want like a sandbox but then again this is gcc so that is hard
2012-10-02T22:11:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	that's just the install dir though, isn't it?
2012-10-02T22:11:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 correct
2012-10-02T22:14:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 I also say that this is a good read http://developer.gnome.org/anjuta-build-tutorial/3.2/anjuta-build-tutorial.html
2012-10-02T22:14:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	thanks
2012-10-02T22:14:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 ^^
2012-10-02T22:16:00.000Z	bobweaver	Doxin	 for what it is worth I just got done reading this http://books.google.com/books?id=HBbKghM2fGYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=autotools+book&source=bl&ots=wYIYKRhPom&sig=JveVLOxWuuGPMC5DMZM3V1Qs2Ao&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PC9rUPm7O-y30QHMk4GwDQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=autotools%20book&f=false               and it was a great book !!
2012-10-02T22:16:00.000Z	Doxin	bobweaver	found my answer though, thanks.
