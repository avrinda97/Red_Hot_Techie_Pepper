2010-01-31T04:58:00.000Z	evon		is there anyway to control where desktop icons appear
2010-01-31T04:58:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	you mean besides click dragging them ?
2010-01-31T04:59:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	yes i want them to appear in a specific area automatically
2010-01-31T05:00:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	you could try devilspie although i doubt you'll get what you desire
2010-01-31T05:01:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	lol. never heard of it but i will look it p
2010-01-31T05:01:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Devilspie
2010-01-31T05:18:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	there's no option in devilspie to control where icons appear
2010-01-31T05:19:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	i suspected as much
2010-05-17T05:41:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	 ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/ -oa
2010-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	thanks but i got the uuid already.  Now i just want to know how to use it in the fstab
2010-05-17T05:43:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	just be careful that blkid will read the uuid from fstab instead. which means if you put an incorrect uuid in the fstab then blkid will happily report that one
2010-05-17T05:43:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	instead of /dev/blah you put UUID=xxx.yyy.zzz
2010-05-17T05:44:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	thanks that's exactly what i want
2010-05-17T05:44:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	ie : UUID=77f37e19-6a98-499f-8355-542e323786a6 / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1
2010-05-17T05:44:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	or what ever the UUID is of your partition/block device
2010-05-17T05:47:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	is this line correct? "UUID=46F40811F40805C1    /media/datadisk ntfs    defaults 0 0"
2010-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	airtonix	evon	do you have this partition already mounted ?
2010-05-17T05:53:00.000Z	evon	airtonix	yes
