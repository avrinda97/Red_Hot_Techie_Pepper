2007-11-20T22:32:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	do you have the best drivers installed ?
2007-11-20T22:33:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	put your lspci listing on pastebin
2007-11-20T22:37:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	ok, done.
2007-11-20T22:37:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	and the URL is... ?
2007-11-20T22:38:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	not yet, but hopefully as a next step
2007-11-20T22:39:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	well, the Intel drivers should be loaded correctly
2007-11-20T22:39:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	are you attempting anything funny, say.. compiz-fusion ?
2007-11-20T22:39:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	again, not yet. this is a fresh install. the only thing I have put on so far is google earth
2007-11-20T22:40:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	put your /etc/X11/xorg.conf on pastebin as well, please
2007-11-20T22:40:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	ok.
2007-11-20T22:46:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	xoeg.conf= http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45274/
2007-11-20T22:48:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	looks like the correct driver is loaded, maybe its not that great of a video card ?
2007-11-20T22:48:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	it is onboard video, but I set it to 128 megs of memory, and it worked great under windows, which is why I would expect it to work well under linux
2007-11-20T22:50:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	try in the forums, for other users with similar symptoms ?
2007-11-20T22:51:00.000Z	SubSonik	neverblue	I guess. Thanks for the help!
2007-11-20T22:51:00.000Z	neverblue	SubSonik	looks like everything is fine from this end....
