2010-09-15T06:11:00.000Z	Guest34371		yeah, actionparsnip: that link is for older ubuntu
2010-09-15T06:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	Banshee can proably sync your Ipod
2010-09-15T06:13:00.000Z	Guest34371	sebsebseb	installing now...
2010-09-15T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	also in the future it is a good idea when using Desktop Linux in particular to buy players that support open formats and that are also Linux distro friendly such as,  what cowen sell
2010-09-15T06:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	a company who sell good players, that work well with Desktop Linux :)
2010-09-15T06:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	ah yes ebooks, they have stuff for that even,  if I remember correctly, been a while since I looked at their site
2010-09-15T06:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	Apple stuff doesn't always just work with Linux distros, because Apple doesn't support them
2010-09-15T06:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	as far as I know you can have a Touch working, but might have to do something first, before it works
2010-09-15T06:16:00.000Z	Guest34371	sebsebseb	from all the docs it looks like it is SUPPOSED to work, but nobody mentions the 4.1 ios that just came out. i think 4.1 broke all the syncing software
2010-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	ah right yeah bingo
2010-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	thats probably it
2010-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	used to work, untill Apple broke the support
2010-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	that was expected though, that they would eventually brake the support
2010-09-15T06:18:00.000Z	Guest34371	sebsebseb	i'm just trying to confirm that that is what happened
2010-09-15T06:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	Apple support Mac OS X, and sometimes Windows,  and they don't really care about other OS's, even though Mac OS X was based on FreeBSD
2010-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	may be able to run a Windows virtual machine, and use Itunes in that for it
2010-09-15T06:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	I think it might have some  kind of config or another program, might have to just use Windows in a vm for it or something
2010-09-15T06:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest34371	uh above, might work  after some kind of config,
