2007-07-23T13:07:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Are you sure that its a cifs filesystem? Not smbfs?
2007-07-23T13:09:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Hrm.
2007-07-23T13:10:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	I'm not really all that familar with CIFS unfortunately sorry.
2007-07-23T13:12:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	mount -t sifs -o username='username' /device /dir
2007-07-23T13:12:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	cifs rather
2007-07-23T13:14:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	you prefixed the command with sudo, right?
2007-07-23T13:15:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Did you replace /device and /dir with the device you are trying to mount and the directory you are trying to mount to?
2007-07-23T13:15:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Okay, (I have to ask).
2007-07-23T13:15:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Did it prompt you for a password?
2007-07-23T13:17:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Try replacing the ~/ with the fill path to your home directory.
2007-07-23T13:18:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	hmm. I'm not sure what to suggest.
2007-07-23T13:20:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	Its possible that the max number of concurrent connections is set to 1.
2007-07-23T13:20:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	But thats an odd configuration.
2007-07-24T10:39:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	edit your screensaver & power settings.
2008-11-17T03:27:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	You could use `watch` in combination with cat, or tail, or head, or similar.
2009-08-03T19:22:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	grep -Rl "string" /path/
2009-10-14T22:04:00.000Z	Pici	panfist	shift page-up generally
