2010-12-15T19:50:00.000Z	sosaited		Will 10.04 run properly on a 1.3ghz celeron M, with 512mb ram? (480 usable)
2010-12-15T19:50:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	yep, looks good
2010-12-15T19:50:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	though desktop effects may not work, that depends on your Video RAM
2010-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	That would be 32mb shared as ram is 512 but shows as ~480
2010-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	I will just need compiz without the cube
2010-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	I mean the memory of your graphic card. Is it shared?
2010-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	Yes iits shared
2010-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	If that's the case, then compiz should run fine without the cube. What is the graphic card manufacturer?
2010-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	sosaited		Intel 855
2010-12-15T19:53:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	you seem good to go
2010-12-15T19:53:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	Thanks
2010-12-15T19:53:00.000Z	cdbs		!ask
2010-12-15T19:53:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	you're welcome :) Enjoy using Ubuntu!
2010-12-15T19:54:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	Actually I have been using it for a while (Karmic, Lucid and Maverick), but installing on someone else's laptop, Already got Xubuntu 9.10 on it as its ram was 256mb,but now I upgraded it to 512mb for Ubuntu
2010-12-15T19:55:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	oh
2010-12-15T19:55:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	BTW is KDE better or Gnome for slower processors and ram?
2010-12-15T19:56:00.000Z	cdbs	sosaited	I am not very sure, but I think GNOME
2010-12-15T19:56:00.000Z	sosaited	cdbs	Hmm. THanks., I'll try lucid and hopefully it will be fine
