2008-04-25T22:09:00.000Z	suweid		Why would I want to upgrade? What new cool stuff do I stand to get?
2008-04-25T22:10:00.000Z	suweid		Apart from it saturating my 100mbit connection for 3 minutes, that is?
2008-04-25T22:11:00.000Z	suweid		Can someone please point me to a reason to upgrade? Why is there a new release in the first place? I don't understand why I couldn't just get individual package upgrades like I usually do? New backgrounds bundled, whaaat?
2008-04-25T22:11:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	read release notes
2008-04-25T22:12:00.000Z	suweid	pjoul	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/804 mentions new new backgrounds what so ever.

2008-04-25T22:15:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	pulseaudio, gio, gnome2.22, firefox3
2008-04-25T22:15:00.000Z	suweid	pjoul	yes - it says that firefox 3 beta is bundled now. Why couldn't i just install it. Ohh, new gnome?
2008-04-25T22:16:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	if you don't want it - don't install it. that'sso  easy
2008-04-25T22:16:00.000Z	suweid	pjoul	I want it, I just want to know why the hoopla! :)
2008-04-25T22:17:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	just because all that new shiny software :)
2008-04-25T22:17:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	and mind that fact that hardy will be supported longer than gutsy
2008-04-25T22:19:00.000Z	suweid	pjoul	Yeah, I don't know what "Support" rather than googling for help or coming here and complaining is. And I don't think either are going to be outlasted by "LTS" from canonical.
2008-04-25T22:20:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	and what about updates and securitys updates... that's the biggest support you can reach
2008-04-25T22:21:00.000Z	suweid	pjoul	Aah, the packages. Then yeah, that's worth a lot. Though I'll be probably updating the day after 9.?? comes out. :)
2008-04-25T22:21:00.000Z	pjoul	suweid	yes, that's your bussiness :)
