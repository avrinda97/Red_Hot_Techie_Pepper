2008-07-25T15:42:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	recordmydesktop is the package name?
2008-09-13T03:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	he's clearly an idiot
2008-09-13T03:57:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	just ban him
2008-09-13T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	im not ops
2008-09-13T04:11:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	does EnvyNG work without problems for you?
2008-09-13T04:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	absolutely
2008-09-13T04:12:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	I've tried it once and it didn't install sh*t
2008-09-13T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	did you run it with gksu envyng-gtk
2008-09-13T04:13:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	yeah... didn't work, so i've turned back to manual install
2008-09-13T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	whatever makes it work dude
2008-09-22T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	if they are identical it doesnt matter
2008-09-22T16:44:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	well, the description that i get via apt-search are 99% identical... but i've never tried out glut so i don't really know what are pros&cons for freeglut&glut
2008-09-22T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	only thing i can suggest is to try one for a while then try the other
2008-09-24T00:15:00.000Z	opt1k	ActionParsnip	when i try to compile eggdrop it says tcl is not installed, but i have tcl 8.3 installed, so why am i getting this error?
2008-09-24T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	opt1k	you could tell the compiler where to find tcl
