2006-08-17T13:25:00.000Z	CBMz		Umm.. I just installed kubuntu-desktop at my computer yesterday, does it mean i have to go to #kubuntu?
2006-08-17T13:26:00.000Z	CBMz		I still have ubuntu, but with kde.
2006-08-17T13:26:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	depends on the question :)
2006-08-17T13:27:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	is it through wine?
2006-08-17T13:27:00.000Z	CBMz	NickGarvey	No.
2006-08-17T13:27:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	and is something else using your sound card?
2006-08-17T13:28:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	other sounds work though?
2006-08-17T13:28:00.000Z	CBMz	NickGarvey	if amarok does, yeah.
2006-08-17T13:33:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	mmap.. hmm what does that mean..
2006-08-17T13:33:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	In computing, mmap is a POSIX-compliant Unix system call that maps files or devices into memory. It is a kind of memory-mapped I/O.
2006-08-17T13:33:00.000Z	CBMz	NickGarvey	So what should i do?
2006-08-17T13:34:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	 I think something is using your sound card
2006-08-17T13:35:00.000Z	CBMz	NickGarvey	is there a way to check if something uses my sound card?
2006-08-17T13:36:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	not to my knowledge.. but thats not very much heh
2006-08-17T13:36:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	I would check firefox or such
2006-08-17T13:43:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	:)
2006-08-17T15:47:00.000Z	NickGarvey	CBMz	cp -r
