2007-12-11T17:02:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	I'm trying to add a webdav source, although at this point I would be happy with ssh, ftp, or anything that litup the ok button.
2007-12-11T17:03:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	can you do in from the desktop ? i mean before even bothering with calendars try "places- connect to server"
2007-12-11T17:04:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	feel free to tell what was wrong :)
2007-12-11T17:07:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	Thanks, and now I have to go to work.  one more week and finals are over and atleast it will be just work, not work and school.
2007-12-11T17:07:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	np... brainlapse happens.. and now we know  a good question to ask the next guy having probs
2007-12-11T17:08:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	Yeah, "Retard... I know it's an obvious question, but are you using the checkbox to select the source?"
2007-12-11T17:09:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	I received a job offer but i'm considering saying no if they insist i use windows
2007-12-11T17:09:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	I don't know i'm so used to my current setup right ..
2007-12-11T17:09:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	i was too
2007-12-11T17:10:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	i've been maintaining my personal server on freebsd for years and tested linux dists occasionally
2007-12-11T17:10:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	i havent booted windows once since october 20th 2006
2007-12-11T17:11:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	but it uses so much memory.  I run windows xp as my environment, then I have a vm ware virt server to mimic my production machines.  I have samba access and dns setup so I can develop on my windows environment live to the ubuntu server and view everything like it would be in production.  BUT my vmware machines take up ~260MB each of ram.
2007-12-11T17:11:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	linux *uses* your memory
2007-12-11T17:11:00.000Z	kling0n	isleshocky77	the memory manager is much more effective than windoze
2007-12-11T17:13:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	This shouldn't be slow, right? http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00030440&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=326358&lang=en
2007-12-11T17:14:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	Well the desktop setup I have is just a straight setup, no virtualization at all.
2007-12-11T17:16:00.000Z	isleshocky77	kling0n	It's a different machine then my real machine.  My real machine I run Ubuntu Server in vm ware. And it runs smooth.  This is a Ubuntu Desktop setup on the laptop I gave you the link to.  Just a normal straight insall as the only os on the machine.
