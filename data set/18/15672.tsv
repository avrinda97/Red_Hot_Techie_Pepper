2005-04-30T15:42:00.000Z	space_oddity		and type "sudo -s"
2005-04-30T15:43:00.000Z	space_oddity		do you know wich partition is your fat?
2005-04-30T15:43:00.000Z	space_oddity		ok
2005-04-30T15:43:00.000Z	space_oddity		then "kedit /etc/fstab"
2005-04-30T15:43:00.000Z	space_oddity		or "gedit /etc/fstab"
2005-04-30T15:44:00.000Z	space_oddity		at the bottom enter "/dev/hda1       /media/hda1    vfat    user     0       0"
2005-04-30T15:44:00.000Z	space_oddity		than save and quit
2005-04-30T15:44:00.000Z	space_oddity		/dev/hda1
2005-04-30T15:45:00.000Z	space_oddity		koba... at the bottom enter "/dev/hda1       /media/hda1    vfat    user     0       0"
2005-04-30T15:45:00.000Z	space_oddity		this options work fine for me
2005-04-30T15:46:00.000Z	theine	space_oddity	but only root will have write access to the fat partition in this way, no?
2005-04-30T15:49:00.000Z	theine	space_oddity	I thought only the user who actually mounts the partition has write access in this way...
2005-04-30T15:49:00.000Z	theine	space_oddity	and root of course...
2005-04-30T15:49:00.000Z	space_oddity	theine	yes
2005-04-30T15:50:00.000Z	space_oddity	theine	... I think so! :-)
2005-04-30T15:50:00.000Z	theine	space_oddity	but if you leave /etc/fstab like this, it will be mounted at boot time by root and ordinary users won't have write access...
2005-04-30T15:51:00.000Z	space_oddity	theine	I think all will be able to write to it
2005-04-30T15:51:00.000Z	theine	space_oddity	I don't...
