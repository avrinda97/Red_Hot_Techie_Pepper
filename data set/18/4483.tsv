2009-11-23T11:17:00.000Z	ftab		how can I find a string in files ?
2009-11-23T11:17:00.000Z	ftab		is there any gnome tool for that or I have to rely on command line ?
2009-11-23T11:18:00.000Z	ftab		any gui tool for finding a string in files ?
2009-11-23T11:19:00.000Z	ftab		Sedated, :-) don't need a command line emmulator but a GUI tool
2009-11-23T11:19:00.000Z	ftab		:-)
2009-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	mattcen	ftab	Depending on what sort of files you are using there are probably gui tools that will work. E.g. You could probably use Eclipse for searching for code inside files
2009-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	mattcen	ftab	Mostly though, the command line and Grep are your best bet
2009-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	ftab	mattcen	I tried many options using grep but no luck
2009-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	mattcen	ftab	What are you searching for, and what sort of files are you looking in?
2009-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	ftab		let me send you
2009-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	ftab		find . | xargs grep "$settings['theme_url']=" -sl
2009-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	ftab		grep -H -r "displaze" ~/public_html/aftabnaveed-dsp/forum/*.php
2009-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	ftab		used that kind of patterns for searching
2009-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	mattcen	ftab	What was the find command for?
2009-11-23T11:23:00.000Z	mattcen		That xargs bit probably won't work as intented because the $settings will get expanded by the shell
2009-11-23T11:23:00.000Z	ftab	mattcen	I found that on google, but tried grep as well
2009-11-23T11:25:00.000Z	mattcen	ftab	So you're looking for 'displaze' in all forum/*.php files? If that's you're intent, that's what you're doing. Also remember that grep is case sensitive unless you use '-i'
2009-11-23T11:26:00.000Z	ftab	mattcen	let me try -i
