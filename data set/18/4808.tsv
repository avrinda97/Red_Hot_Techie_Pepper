2009-02-05T07:25:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	I don't see anything like that
2009-02-05T07:22:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	I can help you turn that sound off
2009-02-05T07:22:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	Ah, yes, but can you help me turning on the defined sounds? ;-)
2009-02-05T07:22:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	System -> Preferences -> Sounds -> System Beep
2009-02-05T07:23:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	Uncheck the system beep box
2009-02-05T07:23:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	I don't see that there
2009-02-05T07:23:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	Then hit the system sounds tab and have fun
2009-02-05T07:23:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-02-05T07:23:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	Intrepid
2009-02-05T07:24:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	Maybe it's in a different spot with Intrepid than Hardy
2009-02-05T07:25:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	I run 8.04 so maybe it was relocated in Intrepid, I don't know N-A
2009-02-05T07:25:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	What I've got in there is devices (where I've got everything on pulseaudio) and the sounds (the different sound events that I want it to play, but that it doesn't but instead just beeps the internal speaker)
2009-02-05T07:29:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	Yes, I got that explanation earlier, but if I do that, I just disable the beep, I don't get the right sounds
2009-02-05T07:30:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	I would imagine, with the way Hardy is set up, that it's the same format.  Disable the beep first, then add the sounds you wish to play in for the specific errors.  In Hardy, we have a check box to disable the system beep, which is the command I just sent you.  Then you have to find somewhere in your system preferences or administration a place where all your system sounds show up.
2009-02-05T07:31:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	&& _VIM_: Yes, but it doesn't work
2009-02-05T07:31:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	&& _VIM_: I've got the sounds selected, checked, and tested playback, but they don't play
2009-02-05T07:32:00.000Z	mikesholle1	N-A	I honestly don't have any other suggestions for you at this time N-A. Maybe someone else running Intrepid does.
2009-02-05T07:33:00.000Z	N-A	mikesholle1	Maybe :) Thx for the effort, I'm really confused if this is standard intrepid behaviour or not though, I can't find anything about it no matter how I search on google O_o
