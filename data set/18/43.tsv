2012-11-14T01:21:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	how did you umount?
2012-11-14T01:22:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	Well I just shut down my laptop and unplugged the hdd
2012-11-14T01:22:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	i guess it's USB?
2012-11-14T01:24:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	can you see the drive when you plug it in?
2012-11-14T01:25:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	Positive, it asks for pasword and shows me a message that there's no available key for a given one
2012-11-14T01:26:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	I also tried to open it up from terminal with cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc1 encr, but same effect
2012-11-14T01:26:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	try umounting it and then remounting
2012-11-14T01:26:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	no available key sounds... bad
2012-11-14T01:27:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	I've unplugged it and plugged it back if that's what you mean, I could try to reboot if it's going to help
2012-11-14T01:28:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	reboots often work miracles :-) but be careful of trying hotplugging it. I know USB is supposed to be resilient but.....
2012-11-14T01:29:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	ok, I'll try the reboot and get right back here
2012-11-14T01:38:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	any joy?
2012-11-14T01:38:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	not a bit :/
2012-11-14T01:41:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	Grrr. Frustrating. I'm afraid I'm at the limits of my knowledge here... sorry :-(
2012-11-14T01:41:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	other than trying a live distro to try and access and back up the files elsewhere
2012-11-14T01:42:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	no problem, thanks for your time man, kudos, I'm almost sure that the important data sits some other place one of my machines
2012-11-14T01:42:00.000Z	spajderix	Stuz719	Yeah I tried another machine just a second ago with some older ubu/kernel with the same effect so no update did it
2012-11-14T01:42:00.000Z	Stuz719	spajderix	YVW - hope it was of help. And at the risk of stating the obvious, here's a salutory lesson in data management. Back everything up. Test your backup. Then do it again. And then encrpyt!
