2010-01-10T19:49:00.000Z	ericrost		can anyone reproduce that latest flash and firefox on 64bit doesn't work in US on hulu?
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	ericrost		my 32 bit system works, my 64 bit doesn't (flash is correctly installed) stopped working at last update
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	ericrost		even works under wine on my 64 bit box
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	Mine worked out of the box.
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	update happened yesterday on my box
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	Can you provide more details regarding the issue?
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	it has worked for ages
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	Ah
2010-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	I'll hafta check, let me boot into it brb
2010-01-10T19:51:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	I get the message as though I'm using a proxy
2010-01-10T19:51:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	"Unable to stream video..."
2010-01-10T19:56:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	Okay, I just booted into my Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop installation, and there was no update for flash.
2010-01-10T19:58:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	what version of flash are you using?
2010-01-10T19:58:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	Let me check my synaptic
2010-01-10T19:59:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	if its repos its the 32 bit plugin and nspluginwrapper
2010-01-10T19:59:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	Likely. That's what I used to have to do with Debian, except that this was all done automatically so I have to inspect to see what exactly was installed. I see by synaptic flashplugin-installer is installed... but that's not particularly revealing
2010-01-10T20:00:00.000Z	ericrost	zig_	I'll try installing from synaptic, worried about performance, but I'd rather have functionality
2010-01-10T20:01:00.000Z	zig_	ericrost	About 90% of any performance boost I've ever achieved via customizing my system has been via a handrolled kernel.
