2008-12-30T20:26:00.000Z	Doonz2		Hey Guys need some help investigating wether my box was comprimised or not
2008-12-30T20:27:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	if you have any reason to suspect the box has been compromised you should a) disconnect it from the network, and b) wipe it
2008-12-30T20:29:00.000Z	Doonz2	popey	no i didn't it was typing commands and then at the end said "You Got Owned" and the shut down firefox
2008-12-30T20:30:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	possibly some malicious javascript on a dodgy site
2008-12-30T20:30:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	unlikely, thats probably a cron job
2008-12-30T20:30:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	ubuntu doesn't have a root user activated
2008-12-30T20:31:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	have you installed all pending security updates?
2008-12-30T20:33:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	from that address?
2008-12-30T20:33:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	do you have a password on your root account?
2008-12-30T20:36:00.000Z	Doonz2	popey	i dont remeber
2008-12-30T20:37:00.000Z	Doonz2	popey	- i have no outstanding updates waiting to be applied
2008-12-30T20:38:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	i cant look at your log right now, do you see root logging in okay _from_ that dodgy IP address ?
2008-12-30T20:38:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	where does it say root logged in from?
2008-12-30T20:40:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	you dont
2008-12-30T20:41:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	in your log, where do you see root logging in from? what IP or hostname?
2008-12-30T20:41:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	if it's anything _other_ than localhost then there may be an issue
2008-12-30T20:42:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	thats a _failed_ login, not success
2008-12-30T20:42:00.000Z	popey	Doonz2	where is the success logon as root?
