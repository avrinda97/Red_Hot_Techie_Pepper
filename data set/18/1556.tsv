2011-01-20T20:25:00.000Z	bhaveshnande		can any one tell me how can I use a grub from another ubuntu?
2011-01-20T20:26:00.000Z	bhaveshnande		I have 2 ubuntus installed
2011-01-20T20:26:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	both grub2 ?
2011-01-20T20:28:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	danny: default grub starts automatically but I want to use another one ; the ! triggers the channel ro-bot
2011-01-20T20:30:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	but you learn fast, nvm
2011-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	formating kills the mbr, too, where mbr (and so grub) resides, just delete unwanted partitons and then follow dann..
2011-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	you can use grub1 further on, if you like, but mind to mention it, as grub2 is commo since a longer time
2011-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	no "!" in front of usernames , and for nicks :
2011-01-20T20:42:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	it depends on the installer-medium wherever that is newer or older than the existing ones on the hd
2011-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	yes, and can also choose no new grub and add the new install manually to the existing grub
2011-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	or interchange grub1 and 2 as you  like
2011-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	bhaveshnande	DasEi	"and can also choose no new grub" ?
2011-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	at the end of an install, can proceed with no grub installation, yes
2011-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	bhaveshnande	DasEi	ok got it ty :D
2011-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	DasEi	bhaveshnande	so if there is  one, can add the install manually, too
