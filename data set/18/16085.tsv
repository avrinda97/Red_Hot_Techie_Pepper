2006-05-05T09:53:00.000Z	kman		RESENDING: I installed ubuntu 5.10, and when i boot there is no interface detected (not even loopback), any ideas?
2006-05-05T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	  check the wiki/forums yet?
2006-05-05T09:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	  sounds almost like a bad cd burn.. or some other odd hardware issue.
2006-05-05T09:56:00.000Z	kman	Dr_Willis	this is an original ubuntu CD, setup completed successfully
2006-05-05T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 you mean by setup - that it 'installed' ?
2006-05-05T09:59:00.000Z	kman	Dr_Willis	yep, install/setup you naem it. I can say that after logining in i get the followong message: "Could not look up internet address for machine. This will prevent GNOME from operating correctly. ..."
2006-05-05T10:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 if you had POSTED that earlier :P  lol.. ive seen that when your /etc/hosts file does not have the  ip/name for your local machine.  Ive not seen it affect anythingunder gnome to be honest
2006-05-05T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 for example in my hosts file -->  127.0.1.1       amd64     amd64
2006-05-05T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 and amd64 is my machines name. set in some other file.. i forget.
2006-05-05T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 ya could rerun the network config tools.   - ive never noticed sudo failing befor for that.  - you basicially need to just set a hostname.     i have 2 entrys for 127.0.0.1 ons for localhost and anotehr for the hostname.
2006-05-05T10:08:00.000Z	kman	Dr_Willis	[warning: newbie question]  How do i rerun the network config tools?
2006-05-05T10:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 the menu items have them there. -   if it will let ya get to gnome that is...
2006-05-05T10:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 type !hostname and read the bot msg. it mentions your exact problem. but not the fix. Lol
2006-05-05T10:12:00.000Z	kman	Dr_Willis	running "hostname" or the corresponding GUI util needs root privileges.... and I cant run sudo!!
2006-05-05T10:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 not sure what to tell ya there. i alwaus set root password. (shame on me)
2006-05-05T10:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 perhaps the other experts in here can tell ya how to work around that issue.
2006-05-05T10:14:00.000Z	kman	Dr_Willis	how can i login as root? how can i set the pass?
2006-05-05T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kman	 not sure. :P thats why i suggest the others may know how to get around that. I dont know a 'trivial' way of doing it.  You could reboot to the  rescue/failsafe mode in the grub menus
