2009-08-06T17:02:00.000Z	anujsingh		hi all
2009-08-06T17:02:00.000Z	anujsingh		i have a binary file with 755 attributes
2009-08-06T17:03:00.000Z	anujsingh		when i am trying to execute binary file as ./bpcd
2009-08-06T17:03:00.000Z	anujsingh		i have error -su: no such file or directory
2009-08-06T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anujsingh	 sure its not some script?  and not a binary file?  -su would be a typo looks like to me.
2009-08-06T17:04:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	no it's not a script, it's a bin file.
2009-08-06T17:09:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	no it's not a script, it's a bin file. http://pastebin.com/da7e26b3
2009-08-06T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anujsingh	 you are on a 32bit installed system? not 64bit?
2009-08-06T17:11:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	just a moment checking with file /bin/date
2009-08-06T17:12:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	file /bin/date gave mee 64 bit
2009-08-06T17:12:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	file /bin/date
2009-08-06T17:16:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	http://pastebin.com/d510d7298
2009-08-06T17:20:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	My OS is 64 bit http://pastebin.com/d510d7298
2009-08-06T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anujsingh	 then you need 64bit binaries i think..
2009-08-06T17:21:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	on rhel same binaries are working fine
2009-08-06T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anujsingh	 could be they got some 32/64 bit support libs then.
2009-08-06T17:23:00.000Z	anujsingh	Dr_Willis	can i have similar supported libs on ubuntu?
2009-08-06T17:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anujsingh	 no idea. i dont really mess with 32bit binaries any more.  see what jrib  says..  :)
