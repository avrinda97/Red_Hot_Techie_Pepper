2008-05-26T22:04:00.000Z	Industrial		I dont understand the way some things are packaged. Like the gstreamer plugins. I'm looking for the modplug plugin or anytihng to play mod files as a gstreamer plugin but I get these "packs" ... why?
2008-05-26T22:04:00.000Z	Industrial		apt-cache search gstreamer0.10-
2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 It would be insane to package each individual plugin.
2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	no it wouldnt, because now i have to go seach in what package the thing i need is
2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	which defeats the purpose of apt-get.
2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 Yes, and you would waste a lot of overhead in package files all for a 32kb plugin file.  \
2008-05-26T22:06:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 The purpose of apt-get is to automatically retrieve debian package files from a repository.  It has nothing to do with how things are packaged.  And you would need to search for the package name containing your mod plugin in any case.  Searching within the package is really no different.
2008-05-26T22:07:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	How do i know which package I need then?
2008-05-26T22:07:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	I'm not going to just install all of them
2008-05-26T22:07:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	furthermore i just want that one gstreamer plugin and not everything in the package
2008-05-26T22:09:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	"GStreamer plugins from the "base" set " ... what is in the "base" set? and the "good" set? and the "bad" set? this makes no sense to me.
2008-05-26T22:09:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 The package descriptions should specify which plugins each package contains, but I see that is no longer the case for all of them.  I do think this is a problem.  Though honestly, they're pretty small, I always just install everything.
2008-05-26T22:10:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	well I don't know which specific plugin I need. I'd like to be able to play module files (mod/it/s3m/etc) with  QuodLibet.
2008-05-26T22:12:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 Also, this is the way plugins are packaged by gstreamer upstream...  I agree the descriptions should ideally be changed.
2008-05-26T22:12:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	hmm ok ill check the gstreamer site then
2008-05-26T22:14:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins.html
2008-05-26T22:15:00.000Z	hackel	Industrial	 That's all you need to know. :)  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
2008-05-26T22:16:00.000Z	Industrial	hackel	thanks
