2008-07-17T13:57:00.000Z	negge	cckk	you mean a video thumbnail or a thumbnail of the cover picture?
2008-07-17T13:58:00.000Z	cckk	negge	a thumbnail of the cover picture
2008-07-17T13:59:00.000Z	negge	cckk	if you're looking at the folder in Icon view you should see thumbnails by default unless you've messed with some settings
2008-07-17T14:00:00.000Z	cckk	negge	i havent messed with any setting AFAIK but going over them would be a great idea since i am really new to this
2008-07-17T14:00:00.000Z	negge	cckk	so you don't see any thumbnail?
2008-07-17T14:00:00.000Z	cckk	negge	noothing not even one anywhere
2008-07-17T14:03:00.000Z	cckk	negge	 i just went under my music folder and went to view/reset viw to default
2008-07-17T14:03:00.000Z	negge	cckk	any change?
2008-07-17T14:03:00.000Z	cckk	negge	still no go
2008-07-17T14:03:00.000Z	negge	cckk	go to options and see if you can find anything there
2008-07-17T14:04:00.000Z	cckk	negge	how about preferences since there is no options?
2008-07-17T14:05:00.000Z	negge	cckk	yeah that's what I meant
2008-07-17T14:07:00.000Z	cckk	negge	 no love i change 2 items /preview/show thumbnails -- always /preview/only for files smaller than --1GB
2008-07-17T14:07:00.000Z	negge	cckk	that's weird
2008-07-17T14:08:00.000Z	cckk	negge	what about /preferences/tree view defaults/show only folders --checked
2008-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	negge	cckk	I don't see why that would help
2008-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	cckk	negge	it didnt anyway
