2008-02-23T08:52:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		alex -- if you dont know how to compile a package.... video editing in Linux will be beyond your abilities... (not a putdown, just a fact) ... Linux video editing apps aren't .... userfriendly...
2008-02-23T08:53:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		have fun then alex... But before you try .. let me sprinkle some Holy Penguin Water on you .... In naminae Padre, Spiritu Linus, amen.
2008-02-23T08:54:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		I know alex... it's ok :)
2008-02-23T08:56:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		alex, if you think about it ... the amount of time you're spending trying to get someone to do it for you, you could be spending learning how to do it ..... then next time you need to compile something, you'd have no need to ask anyone... so it's actually less work to learn it that to ask for step-by-step handholding... oh and to answer your question, no.
2008-02-23T08:57:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		besides, I saw 2 or 3 links, one of which I posted that would help you just fine.
