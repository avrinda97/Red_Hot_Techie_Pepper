2012-10-27T11:58:00.000Z	niadh		Hi all, I am experiencing a boot issue I can't work out. Ubuntu will not boot and shows on the text "GRUB_" on screen, however after using the SuperGrub CD I can boot ubuntu and have installed the latest updates and have ran grub-install on my root drive to no avail, the system will not boot. I've also tried the boot-repair tool which while being very useful in previous issues with bootloaders has not managed to do anything. Does anyone
2012-10-27T11:58:00.000Z	niadh		 have any suggestions that I haven't yet tried?
2012-10-27T12:00:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	tried update-grub2 ?
2012-10-27T12:01:00.000Z	niadh	pepee	Not yet, I thought that was run as part of grub-install? I'll try it just now.
2012-10-27T12:02:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	no idea, but I remember reading that you had to run that after installing it from a live cd
2012-10-27T12:05:00.000Z	niadh	pepee	I have the real system booted, I can use a supergrub CD to in effect chain load ubuntu, but ubuntu's own grub just sit's forever waiting with the word grub shown, it's not like it shows a boot prompt, just sits there. I'm running the disk utility in case it's the disk, but I really hope it's not.
2012-10-27T12:06:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	what computer is this?
2012-10-27T12:12:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	does it use EFI or a BIOS?
2012-10-27T12:13:00.000Z	niadh	pepee	BIOS I imagine, anyway to tell for sure?
2012-10-27T12:14:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	no idea :/
2012-10-27T12:15:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	try adding noefi to the kernel command line in grub
2012-10-27T12:16:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	that, if you can do that. can you edit that line?
2012-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	niadh	pepee	I can, though, I should add that this PC worked flawlessly for months, it just stopped booting yesterday. Not from the grub prompt, it doesn't even get to a point where I could edit a boot line, I can however use the supergrub CD to kickstart it and directly add it to the text file
2012-10-27T12:17:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	if it doesn't even show the grub menu, I'd try asking in #grub
2012-10-27T12:19:00.000Z	niadh	pepee	Is that an ubuntu channel or grub itself?
2012-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	a channel for grub
2012-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	pepee	niadh	this is freenode
2012-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	niadh	pepee	Ok, i'll try there then
