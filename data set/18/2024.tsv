2010-09-18T15:30:00.000Z	iShawnW		okay wtf does it take to just ftp/smb from win7 into 10.10
2010-09-18T15:30:00.000Z	iShawnW		even mac can connect, xp can connect, I have no vista so didn't test that
2010-09-18T15:32:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	i guess that question depends on what software you are using... (it's my assumption that every iteration of windows undergoes enough changes to make it incompatiable with other OS)
2010-09-18T15:33:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	its really felling like Bill blocked like smb port
2010-09-18T15:33:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	why?
2010-09-18T15:33:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	every other box i have can connect but yet win7 can't
2010-09-18T15:34:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	you must be forgetting a step, because i have win7 clients at work that make use of a ubuntu 10.04 ebox server
2010-09-18T15:34:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	10.10, I'm begining to regret it
2010-09-18T15:35:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	ok you need to ask in ubuntu+1
2010-09-18T15:35:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	do you know how to purge every part of samba? every dependancy?
2010-09-18T15:35:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	normal ubuntu channel is just for current release candidate. and #ubuntu+1 is for upcoming releases
2010-09-18T15:35:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	apt-get purge packagename ?
2010-09-18T15:37:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	upgrades are bad, repeat after me.
2010-09-18T15:37:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	it was first time thing, I was feeling to lazy to download the iso... it cam back to bite me in the butt
2010-09-18T15:44:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	for a long time now i make it a point to never upgrade, and to help with clean installs, i assign partitions to directories that i want to retain during a clean install, (a common one is to make /home use the majority of a hard drive)
2010-09-18T15:44:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	I do have a seperate /home, I was to lazy to boot to a live cd/usb
2010-09-18T15:45:00.000Z	airtonix	iShawnW	just a note though, if its a server with something like apache or mysql running you'll want to do the same for the /var directory
2010-09-18T15:46:00.000Z	iShawnW	airtonix	it was my desktop, trying to use smb/ftp to copy files to new lappy
