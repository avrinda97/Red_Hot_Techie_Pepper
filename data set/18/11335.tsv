2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	ripper		anyone installed fluxbox on ubuntu without breaking it?
2006-08-11T09:02:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	lol yeah
2006-08-11T09:02:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	it is applications used within gnome
2006-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	heh, why do you want to use fluxbox if you want 'nice' autoupdate and autodetection of usb?
2006-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	yeah
2006-08-11T09:04:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	anyway, you can do all that from the terminal if you want, or install the apps from gnome/kde that you want
2006-08-11T09:04:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	just if you are switching to fluxbox to save resources, it's silly to add all the crap back again
2006-08-11T09:06:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	lot's of ways ...look at dmesg
2006-08-11T09:06:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	look in your /proc directory
2006-08-11T09:07:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	you can also check out 'systat'
2006-08-11T09:10:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	ugh, more ram, the rest is cool
2006-08-11T09:10:00.000Z	ripper	phenez	yeah
2006-08-11T09:11:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	although i have ubuntu with fluxbox running on a p2 450 with 128 meg of ram, and it does a fine job
2006-08-11T09:11:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	just don't have any unneeded services etc running
2006-08-11T09:12:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	anything i don't need
2006-08-11T09:12:00.000Z	ripper	phenez	dont tell him that , he'll start rm'ing stuff like crazy (smacky)
2006-08-11T09:14:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	ah thought it was for you
2006-08-11T09:14:00.000Z	phenez	ripper	get him to use sysv-rc-conf or something
