2012-08-19T21:00:00.000Z	ebbers		What do you use vlc for? Because that may be why you havent had any problems
2012-08-19T21:00:00.000Z	ebbers		I have loaded Ubuntu 12.04 ten times on three different machines and everyone gave me trouble with sound including support for audacity and vlc
2012-08-19T21:01:00.000Z	ebbers		ok well there you have it. Watching videos and listening to music works but how about streaming to http
2012-08-19T21:01:00.000Z	ebbers		doesnt work
2012-08-19T21:02:00.000Z	ebbers		try streaming an mp3 w vlc on ubuntu 12.04
2012-08-19T21:03:00.000Z	ebbers		And Audacity is as glitchy as ever worse than ever before.. ok
2012-08-19T21:03:00.000Z	ebbers		ooops
2012-08-19T21:05:00.000Z	ebbers		So it goes. Trouble finding any support for this. I've been looking and looking for weeks
2012-08-19T21:06:00.000Z	ebbers		Where do i find support for ubuntu12.04 and vlc/audacity?
2012-08-19T21:07:00.000Z	islandmonkey	ebbers	Here. And #vlc and #audacity
2012-08-19T21:07:00.000Z	ebbers	islandmonkey	#Audacity is empty went to #vlc no one could solve
2012-08-19T21:08:00.000Z	ebbers	islandmonkey	#Audacity says send us an email
2012-08-19T21:09:00.000Z	ebbers	islandmonkey	I'm here because both vlc and audacity don't work in ubuntu 12.04. But I had no trouble with previous versions of ubuntu
2012-08-19T21:10:00.000Z	ebbers	islandmonkey	or should i say less trouble. VLC was a little glitchy on the 10.04 lts
2012-08-19T21:11:00.000Z	ebbers	islandmonkey	I don't know much about unity does it relate to the performance of these programs?
2012-08-19T21:12:00.000Z	ebbers	islandmonkey	so log out and back into unity 2d?
2012-08-19T21:12:00.000Z	islandmonkey	ebbers	ThinkT510 is talking to you, not me
