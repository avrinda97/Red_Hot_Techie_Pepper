2007-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	fortitUs		hey.. does ubuntu have better driver support than fedoracore?
2007-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	thats a matter of opinion
2007-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	just remember they both use the same kernels
2007-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	what do you mean find it ?
2007-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	fortitUs	ikonia	i need to get a value for that to compare the relative CPU speeds over many computers
2007-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	just type top and it shows the idle use
2007-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	the idels is guaged out of a calculation
2007-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	fortitUs	ikonia	i need to read the idle use in a program
2007-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	ahhh I see.
2007-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	fortitUs	ikonia	any ideas?
2007-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	I'll have to have a little ponder on that
2007-06-08T08:59:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	check out "sar" or vmstat
2007-06-08T08:59:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	try sar
2007-06-08T09:01:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	pardon
2007-06-08T09:02:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	it gathers stats into a database then works out the average idle - almost the same as top
2007-06-08T09:02:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	not what your after ?
2007-06-08T09:02:00.000Z	ikonia	fortitUs	yeah, thats do-able
2007-06-08T09:02:00.000Z	fortitUs	ikonia	impossible to implement :P
