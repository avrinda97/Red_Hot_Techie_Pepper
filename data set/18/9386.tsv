2007-04-14T09:28:00.000Z	hajhouse		does anyone know whether you can use Sprint Wireless PCS on Linux?
2007-04-14T09:29:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	 try the forum
2007-05-28T06:13:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	maybe not
2007-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	hours if it is USB1.0, minutes if it is fast USB
2007-05-28T06:13:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	so 30 minutes is not "slow" ?
2007-05-28T06:13:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	thanks , I was starting to wonder
2007-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	if you are curious, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB. USB speeds are 1.5 Mbit/s, 12 Mbit/sec, or 480Mbit/sec. If any of the cables or hubs or anything in the system is not rated for the high speeds the drive will fall back to the slowest speed
2007-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	so yeah it could be normal for copying 2 gigs to take hours
2007-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	I'm guessing the cable is the issue here then
2007-05-28T06:18:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	there is something  I need to account for,  because  2 gig at 15 mb/s should only take 2.5 minutes
2007-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	the speeds are Mbits/sec, not Mbytes/sec (i.e., you are calculating a speed that is 8 times too fast)
2007-09-20T08:15:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	pastebin your xorg.conf file so we can hve a look
2007-09-20T08:15:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	one moment
2007-09-20T08:18:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37963/
2007-09-20T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	hold on
2007-09-20T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	sorry, I've never seen a xorg.conf file like that one, I wouldnT' even know where to start
2007-09-20T08:22:00.000Z	hajhouse	Pelo	its pretty big i know. probably the most relevant part is the Modes section where i put in the modeline for 1440x900. i'm not sure why it doesn't work, though :(
2007-09-20T08:23:00.000Z	Pelo	hajhouse	there is a #xorg maybe they know
