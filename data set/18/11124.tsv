2006-09-08T14:11:00.000Z	Vegeta		On the GUI I can only create some forms of partition with a couple of different filesystem. How do I create the root partition?
2006-09-08T14:12:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	the root partition has nothing more than being mounted on /
2006-09-08T14:13:00.000Z	Vegeta	magnet	So that means it would be created "by its own"? And what about the partition names? I can't change them either. They just get a default name like "New Partiton #1"...
2006-09-08T14:14:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	huh, don't play with your root part in Gparted :) and the New Partition #1 is just temporary .. partitions are NOT named by you :)
2006-09-08T14:15:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	these aren't partitions names but mount points -- that's a totally different concept :)
2006-09-08T14:17:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	the root (/) partition can't be changed in Gparted because you can only remount it in single-user mode .. and btw, why would you want to change your / ? it requires a good understanding of how the OS works
2006-09-08T14:19:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	not always, some people make a /boot partition
2006-09-08T14:23:00.000Z	Vegeta	magnet	Will the swap have to be created at that place? That is where I create the partitions?
2006-09-08T14:24:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	what do you mean? you have to create the swap by yourself
2006-09-08T14:25:00.000Z	Vegeta	magnet	Yes. At the installation process, you can choose to partition the hd manually, is it there where the swap has to be created?
2006-09-08T14:26:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	if you do it manually, yes
2006-09-08T14:28:00.000Z	Vegeta	magnet	So how do I create /usr, /var, /home and ect..? Aren't they partitions?
2006-09-08T14:28:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	you could see them as partitions, but there are two different concepts here
2006-09-08T14:37:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	it is the directory onto which you'll "mount" a partition
2006-09-10T05:40:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	this has nothing to do with "Linux"
2006-09-10T05:41:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	what's your desktop environment? (gnome, kde or xfce)
2006-09-10T05:41:00.000Z	Vegeta	magnet	KDE
2006-09-10T05:41:00.000Z	magnet	Vegeta	blame KDE; I don't help with KDE
