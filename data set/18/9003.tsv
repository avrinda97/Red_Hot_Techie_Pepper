2007-05-30T15:01:00.000Z	Tacroy		Does anyone know offhand how to make dhcpd forward the dns server ipaddresses the dhcp server is using to its dhcp clients?
2007-05-30T15:01:00.000Z	Tacroy		I'm sure I made it do that at some point.
2007-05-30T15:03:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	it doesn't do that by default?
2007-05-30T15:03:00.000Z	Tacroy		I don't know, it doesn't seem to be doing that.
2007-05-30T15:04:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	what does it do, then?
2007-05-30T15:04:00.000Z	Tacroy	mwe	It seems like the client just doesn't get any DNS.
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	Tacroy		Er, any DNS server.
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	Tacroy		(I'm using my Windows laptop as the client, ipconfig /all shows no DNS server)
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	option domain-name-servers in dhcpd.conf I think
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	Tacroy	mwe	I am aware of that, but afaik there's no "auto" option.
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	Tacroy		So I'd have to come up with one that will always work.
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	Ah. I see what you mean
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	Tacroy		Bah, maybe I should just figure out why named doesn't seem to work.
2007-05-30T15:07:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	you want it to hand out the DNS server the the machine itself is using at that particular time?
2007-05-30T15:07:00.000Z	Tacroy	mwe	That would be useful, yes.
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	Tacroy	mwe	I could certainly do it with a bit of shell scripting magic, but that seems kludgey.
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	indeed
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	mwe	Tacroy	I don't know if it's supported by default
