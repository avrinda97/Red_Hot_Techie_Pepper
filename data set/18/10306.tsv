2007-02-01T10:12:00.000Z	seravitae		hey is there a way to turn on multithreaded compiling?
2007-02-01T10:12:00.000Z	seravitae		i have a dualcore cpu and compiling my kernel only uses one core.
2007-02-01T10:14:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	you'd have to call make with the -j option to parallelize the compilation
2007-02-01T10:16:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	I think you can set some environment variables that make reads, including one equivalent to the -j option
2007-02-01T10:17:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	 fair enough. how might i access the environment variables?
2007-02-01T10:18:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	'export MAKEFLAGS='-j 4', then try again
2007-02-01T10:19:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	oh, erUSUL's sounds better
2007-02-01T10:19:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	probably your compilation has finished on a single core by now ;)
2007-02-01T10:19:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	- no way. takes forever.
2007-02-01T10:20:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	haha, i did your export one first - now it's complaining that the makeflags are bad.
2007-02-01T10:21:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	empty
2007-02-01T10:22:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	 i did export MAKEFLAGS='' <--- now it errors out on compilation.
2007-02-01T10:26:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	if " export MAKEFLAGS='' " won't work, you may have to open a new shell.
2007-02-01T10:27:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	it was something else i forgot to change. it's all good now
2007-02-11T08:08:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	i installed xbindkeys but /usr/inlcude/X11/keysym.h and such doesnt exist so i can't determine the codes.
2007-02-11T08:10:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	try xbindkeys-config (extra package) for configuring. If you still get this error, you may need the build-essential package.
2007-02-11T08:11:00.000Z	seravitae	soundray	it's cool, i guessed it and it works.
2007-02-14T06:33:00.000Z	soundray	seravitae	are you behind a transparent web proxy?
