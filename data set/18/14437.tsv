2005-07-31T05:03:00.000Z	DekaPink		Ubuntu doesn't love me. xD
2005-07-31T05:05:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	Ubuntu IS love
2005-07-31T05:05:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	I'd believe you if I could get my ATI Radeon card to work. xD
2005-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	what's the problem exactly? (not that I know ATI Radeon......)
2005-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	Can't get any 3D acceleration.
2005-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	So games are all slow and/or not working.
2005-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	which games?    hahahah
2005-07-31T05:08:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	Most all of them. :P
2005-07-31T05:08:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	I suppose that there's no free driver with 3D support....
2005-07-31T05:08:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	I d'know... I know I've seen it work on linux before. :3 I'm guessing Ubuntu just doesn't like it yet. :3
2005-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	if it runs on another linux, it should also run on ubuntu
2005-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	And yet... xD
2005-07-31T05:11:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	what driver do you use, can you tell?
2005-07-31T05:13:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	just a guess: add  Load "dri" and Load "glx"  into the modules section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-07-31T05:14:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	Thanks, I'll try that. :)
2005-07-31T05:14:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	Those are already there. :3
2005-07-31T05:15:00.000Z	eth42	DekaPink	what does "glxinfo | grep rendering" say?
2005-07-31T05:16:00.000Z	DekaPink	eth42	direct rendering: No
