2008-05-03T22:14:00.000Z	zvacet	kuma	: delete extracted folder and when you only have source archive type sudo apt-get build-dep package_name
2008-05-03T22:16:00.000Z	kuma	zvacet	thanks, will do that
2008-05-03T22:19:00.000Z	kuma	zvacet	the sudo apt-get build-dep doesn't receibe files as parameters
2008-05-03T22:20:00.000Z	zvacet	kuma	: maybe I misunderstand you I think you need dependencies
2008-05-03T22:21:00.000Z	kuma	zvacet	yes, but i have the source code in a tar.bz2 file and the apt-get build-dep only works with online packages
2008-05-03T22:22:00.000Z	zvacet	kuma	: install that curl package ( if IÂ´m not wrong that one you are missing
2008-05-03T22:24:00.000Z	kuma	zvacet	already did =/ i deleted the uncompressed folfer, i will mak eit again and try to ./configure again
2008-05-03T22:27:00.000Z	zvacet	kuma	: that is all I can think of
2008-05-03T22:28:00.000Z	kuma	zvacet	still the same error, im going to try in ubuntu-es. thanks for your help :)
