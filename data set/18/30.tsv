2005-02-10T07:20:00.000Z	gort_		and fired oone back up
2005-02-10T07:20:00.000Z	gort_		so the export command should go in .bash_profile or .bashrc?
2005-02-10T07:21:00.000Z	gort_		.bashrc did the trick
2005-02-10T07:22:00.000Z	gort_		thanks LinuxJones
2005-02-10T07:23:00.000Z	gort_		i just installed ubutu (used to run FC3) and immediately upgraded to hoary
2005-02-10T07:24:00.000Z	gort_		so bear with me on the stupid stuff
2005-02-10T07:25:00.000Z	gort_		thanks moyogo
2005-02-10T07:26:00.000Z	gort_		are many *-devel packages installed by default?
2005-02-10T07:26:00.000Z	gort_		and are gcc and other compiling stuff?
2005-02-10T07:26:00.000Z	gort_		i need to get a jump on jhbuild
2005-02-10T07:27:00.000Z	jdub	gort_	none, but you've got gnome 2.9 already ;)
2005-02-10T07:29:00.000Z	jdub	gort_	install the package called 'build-essential'
2005-02-10T07:55:00.000Z	jdub	gort_	deb-src is sources, deb is binaries
2005-04-20T06:41:00.000Z	jdub	gort_	just continue to upgrade.
2005-04-20T06:42:00.000Z	jdub	gort_	most likely
2005-04-20T06:42:00.000Z	jdub	gort_	if you have hoary in your sources.list, have no upgrades pending, and have ubuntu-base/ubuntu-desktop packages installed, you're done.
2005-04-20T06:42:00.000Z	gort_	jdub	thanks....
2005-04-20T06:43:00.000Z	gort_	jdub	all i did after i installed warty was change my sources.list from warty to hoary
