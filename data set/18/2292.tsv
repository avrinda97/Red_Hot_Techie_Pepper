2010-06-24T04:38:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	gparted
2010-06-24T04:38:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	although other tools exist, that is very easy to use
2010-06-24T04:38:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	backup anything before you do though
2010-06-24T04:40:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	certain filesystems do not allow you to shrink, others don't allow you to resize at all
2010-06-24T04:40:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	not while it is mounted. go get a partedmagic cd
2010-06-24T04:40:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	the ubuntu live cd will have it to, but it will take longer too boot
2010-06-24T04:41:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	its an L and google
2010-06-24T04:41:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	most irc clients allow you to tab complete names
2010-06-24T04:43:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	yes
2010-06-24T04:44:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	it will copy its files to ram then boot ... so it is faster than ubuntu live
2010-06-24T04:44:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	oh i was talking about parted magic, but yes the live cd is the bootable one, probably
2010-06-24T04:45:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	cLcto
2010-06-24T04:47:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	 ... what do you mean what?
2010-06-24T04:47:00.000Z	Sangeeth	clcto	: And Sangeeth has no idea of what it is... But, thanks for your help clcto...
2010-06-24T04:48:00.000Z	clcto	Sangeeth	no idea what what is
2010-06-24T04:48:00.000Z	Sangeeth	clcto	: Sorry, that was a wrong "what"... Meant to be sent to someone else... Sorry again...
2010-06-24T04:49:00.000Z	Sangeeth	clcto	: Thanks again :) :)
