2007-05-22T11:00:00.000Z	clinton		hallo! I seem to be having a bit of an issue -- I have  GeForce4MX4000, running 7.03, and I believe the nVidia driver is loaded, but I can't get beyond 1024x768x50hz
2007-05-22T11:00:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	You mean, you can't get any higher refresh rate?  That's a deliberate (but _stupid_) feature of the nvidia drivers.
2007-05-22T11:00:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	I can't get a higher resolution either
2007-05-22T11:01:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	They mis-report the refresh rate (and use it for TwinView - your first monitor is 50hz, second is 51Hz, etc)
2007-05-22T11:01:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	It's being reported in the system --> preferences --> screen resolution panel, is there a different place to configure the nvidia driver properly?
2007-05-22T11:02:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	Well, running "nvidia-settigns" from a terminal will allow you to change the refresh rate, yes.
2007-05-22T11:02:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	well, that explains why I'm not dying of flicker with a 50hz refresh rate, becasue it's not really 50hz :P
2007-05-22T11:03:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	any idea why I can't seem to get above 1024x768?
2007-05-22T11:03:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	Yup, indeed.  How did you install the drivers?
2007-05-22T11:04:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	I just installed my system about an hour ago, this is my first foray into graphical linux :P I was poking around the system preferences, and went to system --> preferences --> desktop effects
2007-05-22T11:04:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	Ah, and it fired up the "Restricted Manager", yes?
2007-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	it told me to install the invidia driver, and gave me two buttons, "install" or "cancel." I clicked install, it asked me for my password, did the install in it's beautiful idiot proof manner, then told me to reboot and run desktop effects again.
2007-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	There was a bug in the pre-release version of Feisty (Ubuntu 7.04) where the restricted manager would incorrectly write the wrong resolutions to xorg.conf.
2007-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	after the reboot, it brought up the restricted driver manager, which says it's loaded and hunky dory.
2007-05-22T11:06:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	But if you're using the full release, I thought that was fixed.  However, it should be easy to fix.
2007-05-22T11:09:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	okay, so the section I want is "You use the "nvidia" driver (Binary drivers)
2007-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	RAOF	clinton	There should have been a suggestion to run the command "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" in that link, right?  That should fix your problem (when you select the right set of resolutions)
2007-05-22T11:14:00.000Z	clinton	RAOF	upon the edit of xorg.conf, do I need to reboot?
