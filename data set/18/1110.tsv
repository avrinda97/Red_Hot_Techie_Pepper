2011-12-15T00:26:00.000Z	skegeek		I need help troubleshooting frequest freezing
2011-12-15T00:27:00.000Z	skegeek		I've already turned off screen-locking, disabled monitor sleeping and disabled compiz.
2011-12-15T00:28:00.000Z	Exxon	skegeek	are you using swap..
2011-12-15T00:30:00.000Z	skegeek		I assume there is swap use.
2011-12-15T00:30:00.000Z	Exxon	skegeek	use .................free - m                 (then)
2011-12-15T00:32:00.000Z	skegeek	Exxon	So what does swap have to do with it?
2011-12-15T00:34:00.000Z	Exxon	skegeek	if how on ram like 512mb swap is activated..so if you can increase the ram to 2gb atleast there is no need for swap
2011-12-15T00:36:00.000Z	skegeek		The machine has 2GB RAM, it has only allocated 255 swap though.
2011-12-15T00:37:00.000Z	skegeek		Btw, this is a Toshiba Satellite A205, Oneiric Ocelot.
2011-12-15T00:38:00.000Z	Exxon	skegeek	then there is no need for swap at all swap is only for if; mem low and so that the swap can use the hdd for the purpouse..temp files
2011-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	skegeek		Could the freezing have anything to do with it being a Wubi install?
2011-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	skegeek		It froze on me twice already within 5 minutes of booting, without ANY apps up at all.
2011-12-15T00:45:00.000Z	skegeek		18G
2011-12-15T00:46:00.000Z	skegeek		The default was 18G, so that's what I gave it.
2011-12-15T00:47:00.000Z	Exxon	skegeek	with that free space you can install wubi with ease.
2011-12-15T00:50:00.000Z	Exxon		with wubi all partitions are pre-mounted ..designed to be that way
2011-12-15T00:51:00.000Z	skegeek	Exxon	The Ubuntu I'm using right now was installed via Wubi, but, I wanted to make sure it wasn't any part of the problem.
2011-12-15T00:53:00.000Z	Exxon	skegeek	wubi is for new users if there is any doubt please do tell us
