2012-11-25T05:52:00.000Z	H4x012		what backup software you offer to make hourly backup on linux server?
2012-11-25T05:54:00.000Z	H4x012		proka
2012-11-25T05:54:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	Yeah?
2012-11-25T05:55:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	I'm basically trying to ssh to my own PC, but instead of using my local IP address, I want to use the remote IP address I get from the ISP. I've found the IP address on ifconfig.me.
2012-11-25T05:56:00.000Z	H4x012	proka	do you have ssh server and client installed?
2012-11-25T05:56:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	Yes, installed and running.
2012-11-25T05:57:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	No probs :)
2012-11-25T05:58:00.000Z	H4x012	proka	so you did your config on /etc/ssh/ssh_config
2012-11-25T05:58:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	The thing that we found out is that nmap reports my port 22 as filtered
2012-11-25T05:59:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	I didn't touch anything there, should I?
2012-11-25T05:59:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	Ok, give me a second pls, I'll report back
2012-11-25T06:02:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	Done it. Should I try sshing now?
2012-11-25T06:04:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	Nope, it still says connection timed out.
2012-11-25T06:07:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	sudo service ssh stop && sudo service ssh start
2012-11-25T06:09:00.000Z	H4x012	proka	change your ssh port and try it again
2012-11-25T06:10:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	in /etc/ssh/sshd_config?
2012-11-25T06:13:00.000Z	proka	H4x012	I've changed it to 555, but it still reports port 22 in the error :S
