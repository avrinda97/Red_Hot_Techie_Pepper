2012-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	irreverant		Ok. I type sudo -
2012-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	irreverant		then I get type password for >>>>>>>
2012-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	irreverant		I do and it says command not found
2012-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	irreverant		what is sudo bash?
2012-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	irreverant		wait why doesn't su - work in ubuntu?
2012-08-04T16:13:00.000Z	irreverant		if I want to get super user or root access to install thing?
2012-08-04T16:14:00.000Z	irreverant		so sudo sh or sudo bash emulates/ creates the ability to run things in root/admin mode?
2012-08-04T16:14:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	Use sudo -i instead of sudo bash.
2012-08-04T16:17:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	su - never worked, since Ubuntu never had a root password set.
2012-08-04T16:17:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	Then you set a password for root yourself.
2012-08-04T16:20:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	sh is a shell, vi is an editor, and bash is a shell too.
2012-08-04T16:20:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	The important thing is, that sudo does not need a root password to be set.
2012-08-04T16:21:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	csh is the c shell, bsh is the bourne shell, bash is the bourne again shell and ksh is the korn shell.
2012-08-04T16:21:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	That question makes no sense.
2012-08-04T16:26:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	No.
2012-08-04T16:26:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	sudo -i
2012-08-04T16:27:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	Or in one step: sudo apt-get install firefox
2012-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	bekks	irreverant	Then use sudo apt-get only, instead of sudo whatever :)
