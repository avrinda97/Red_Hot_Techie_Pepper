2009-12-01T13:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor		I can't get my eee 1000HE to connect to wireless after suspend :(
2009-12-01T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	if you run: sudo lshw -C network    is it a broadcom wifi?
2009-12-01T13:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	let me check
2009-12-01T13:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	damn, somebody moved it (family member, not sure what they did with it), sorry :(
2009-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	is there a known issue with the eee's wireless?
2009-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	well, if it is (wait for the site to come up again (its down)) and use these guides: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks
2009-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	ok thanks, i'll check that when I find the machine
2009-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	its just crappy broadcom things not waking up, so you need a small script to re-modprobe the driver and they wake up
2009-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	thats it, the gui is different to suit the small screens on netbooks
2009-12-02T00:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	mentioned some cards requiring a re-mod-probe after suspend, how would I do that?
2011-12-06T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	could use:  df -h | pastebinit
2011-12-06T06:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	*if* he has pastebinit installed...
2011-12-06T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	its easy to install, great tool
2011-12-06T06:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	i agree, but getting every user that has stuff to post once to install it gets a little tiring :P
2011-12-06T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	true but very worthwhile
2012-06-29T04:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	he shouldn't need to use the grub recovery, he should be able to just use a TTY console (CTRL+SHIFT+F1) since that won't check ICE (only X does).
2012-06-29T04:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ActionParsnip	then just use "sudo chown....."
2012-06-29T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarwinSurvivor	possibly
