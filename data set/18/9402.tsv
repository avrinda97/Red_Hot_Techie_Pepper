2007-04-12T16:45:00.000Z	ROnewbie		every time I boot, I have to type this in order for my wifi to work "sudo iwconfig eth1 ap *mac nr* /  sudo iwconfig eth1 ap *wep key* / sudo dhclient eth1". What should I do not to have to do that every time ?
2007-04-12T16:46:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	script it maybe ?
2007-04-12T16:59:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	yes, execute your text editor as root
2007-04-12T16:59:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	sudo gedit or something like it
2007-04-12T05:17:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	i think so yes
2007-04-12T05:17:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	is iwlist -scan giving you something ?
2007-04-12T05:19:00.000Z	ROnewbie	Lightness1024	iwlist: unknown command `-scan'
2007-04-12T05:19:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	hm, sorry, wait 2 sec I will try
2007-04-12T05:20:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	yes no dash, just "iwlist scan"
2007-04-12T05:21:00.000Z	ROnewbie	Lightness1024	yep, I have lo, eth0, eth1, and a sit0 ,.... never saw sit0 before
2007-04-12T05:22:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	ok, I think for your actual wireless card you should get the list of every channel that you can recieve at the moment. and the encryption information also
2007-04-12T05:23:00.000Z	ROnewbie	Lightness1024	it's only eth1 that has that kind of info
2007-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	ok, then it must be your wireless card.
2007-04-12T05:25:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	but, its the old fashioned way to deal with that list, now you can find more usable GUI I think
2007-04-12T05:26:00.000Z	ROnewbie	Lightness1024	I think that's what I'm doing now, installing that - thoreau's advice. that's funny, I thought I had the network manager already.
2007-04-12T05:26:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	ok
2007-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	Lightness1024	ROnewbie	I have to go for dinner now (yeah japan time), my friend is waiting me. good luck with your wifi :) follow thoreauputic instructions ! bye
2007-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	ROnewbie	Lightness1024	thanks a lot, bye
