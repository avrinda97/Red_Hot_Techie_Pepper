2009-11-30T01:17:00.000Z	VirusTB		Ayone know of a good LIVE CD to run test's on aHDD?/
2009-11-30T01:17:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	all depends on what kind of test you want...  I do fine with an ordinary ubuntu flash stick that has smartmontools on it
2009-11-30T01:18:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 well I just got a USED HDD off ebay, I want to test it to the MAX!  I got it got cheap :P  (1TB for $47)
2009-11-30T01:19:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	yeah, the rescue cds will have disk utils on them.  I would advise hitting it with smartmontools and pulling the reports it can give from its extended test.
2009-11-30T01:19:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 smartmontool's runs frma USB?
2009-11-30T01:20:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	the software runs when booted from a usb device.  The drive needs to be connected via sata, esata or ide
2009-11-30T01:21:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 ah sweet sounds like that I need, where can I find it??  I got enough USB's for use, and the drive is SATA
2009-11-30T01:24:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	probably the easiest way is to download the ubuntu netbook remix image and write it onto a 1gb (or larger) USB stick...  then boot from it, install smartmontools via synaptic, and use it.
2009-11-30T01:25:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	doesn't matter if your rig is a netbook or not, it will work well enough for disk testing
2009-11-30T01:25:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 ok don't mean to be a retard but how do I get an netbook remix image? ?? no more Mininova

2009-11-30T01:27:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 thannk you so much, will be back after I come across issues :P will read some documentation now
2009-11-30T01:29:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 one last thing, how to I  QUICK format an disk in Ubuntu?
2009-11-30T01:29:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	oh that one I don't know, sorry
2009-11-30T01:33:00.000Z	Snausages	VirusTB	as long as you're not trying to put 10lbs of sugar in a 5lb sack you should be fine
2009-11-30T01:35:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	 ok great!  I think I will do that then. I got an 120GB IDE (would b good for my WinXP. Win_7, and Ubuntu program files).. and then I'll use two 1TB HDD in RAID for DATA! :D
2009-11-30T01:36:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	ghosting it wouldn't mess up my GRUB would it?
2009-11-30T01:37:00.000Z	VirusTB	Snausages	Action wil I think I will need some help later on this week.. I will try  to ghost my 3 Partitions from an SATA drive to an IDE drive, and set up two 1TB HDD in raid! :D
