2012-06-07T05:48:00.000Z	Bashmetim		There's a program that comes with gnome, called Displays. That's how I dork around with second monitors, and it usually works just fine.
2012-06-07T05:48:00.000Z	Bashmetim		Is it not working for you?
2012-06-07T05:49:00.000Z	Bashmetim		Search for it under 'settings' or 'system settings' maybe?
2012-06-07T05:50:00.000Z	Bashmetim		I'm not using gnome right now, else I'd check for you.
2012-06-07T05:51:00.000Z	Bashmetim		ALSO I am trying to save a 16 year old girl from data loss at the hands of ecryptfs! Can anyone help me out?
2012-06-07T05:51:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	you should tell us what is in the ecryptfs folder
2012-06-07T05:51:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	and ideally what was removed
2012-06-07T05:56:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	sounds like a recursive symlink
2012-06-07T06:08:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	there are some examples on dustin kirklands blog where a brute force attempt over a smaller space of passwords can be used to get access to the wrapped passphrase. its not an attack on the full ecryptfs passphrase just the wrapped one
2012-06-07T06:08:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	then just unwrap the passphrase?
2012-06-07T06:09:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	unless you dont have the wrapped passphrase anymore
2012-06-07T06:13:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	are you using ls -H ? or something. im consfused why ls would care about a recursive symlink
2012-06-07T06:14:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	what is the exact ls command you are giving
2012-06-07T06:18:00.000Z	Bashmetim	escott	has all the answers.
2012-06-07T06:20:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	its going to be hard to figure things out. but i think your symlink problem is because you are running: ls /path/to/something where "something" is a symlink to /path/to/something so its recursive. and by asking ls /path/to/something you are asking it to run through the symlinks. you can do ls /path/to and it should list something -> something
2012-06-07T06:25:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	i dont remember the structure or what its supposed to be. there are a couple of variants from a full $HOME encryption where .ecryptfs contains all ciphertext and is loopmounted onto ~. to these .Private folders which contain ciphertext and are mounted onto ~/Private
2012-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	two things i would do. (a) create a new user with an encrypted home and see what it is supposed to look like. (b) check out dustin kirklands blog. lots of good stuff on that
2012-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	escott	Bashmetim	yes
