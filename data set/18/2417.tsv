2010-06-01T21:22:00.000Z	iantlopp		strange: only from a theoretical standpoint here, as I've not messed with one.
2010-06-01T21:24:00.000Z	iantlopp		WHAT THE.... I just uninstalled vuze, installed deluge, and tried to open a torrent, and it opened vuze... HOW???
2010-06-01T21:26:00.000Z	iantlopp		no...
2010-06-01T21:26:00.000Z	iantlopp		for removal.. dont know about complete... but I'm running aptitude purge vuze right now.
2010-06-01T21:28:00.000Z	iantlopp		okay, fixed... stupid vuze
2010-06-01T21:30:00.000Z	iantlopp		I usually use cli myself, but didn't know the removal command off the top of my head... next time I'll just aptitude --help
2010-06-01T21:31:00.000Z	iantlopp		what's the point of variations of aptitude? i.e. apt-get
2010-06-01T21:31:00.000Z	iantlopp		why not just have all the commands be aptitude?
2010-06-01T21:32:00.000Z	iantlopp		aeon: understandable.. I tend to type apt-get mostly, but, it seems like more to remember...
2010-06-01T21:32:00.000Z	iantlopp		am I mistaken in thinking they're not the same program?
2010-06-01T21:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	iantlopp	good question and i'm not sure of the answer. i can only think that years ago, two different people started developing front-ends to dpkg/dselect (dselect is totally gone now btw), and both turned out to be very good and very useful.
2010-06-01T21:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	iantlopp	have you ever used just the command...  aptitude  ?
2010-06-01T21:36:00.000Z	iantlopp	onetinsoldier	I never thought of cli frontends to a cli program... heh
2010-06-01T21:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	iantlopp	roger. that's one large difference. aptitude developer went for making an ncurses interface, apt-get did not. but both have been very useful over the years. in more recent history, some of their functionality has seemingly been merged together. my point is, they used to be more different from each other than they are nowadays
2010-06-01T21:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	iantlopp	cheers :)
2010-06-01T21:38:00.000Z	iantlopp	onetinsoldier	cheers to what?
2010-06-01T21:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	iantlopp	nothing i guess.. just saying cheers m8
2010-06-01T22:13:00.000Z	iantlopp	onetinsoldier	possibly the same reason as me, the amd64 release doesn't boot on my system ;(
