2010-05-07T08:11:00.000Z	auk		anyone have issue with volume applet icon on gnome panel disappearing after upgrade to lucid?
2010-05-07T08:12:00.000Z	undecim	auk	Add the indicator applet to your panel
2010-05-07T08:13:00.000Z	auk	undecim	hmm very curious
2010-05-07T08:14:00.000Z	undecim	auk	yup. It sucks IMHO, but it's not too bad
2010-05-07T08:14:00.000Z	undecim	auk	There may be a way to merge them, but I haven't looked into it yet
2010-05-07T08:16:00.000Z	auk	undecim	yes i hated it when the they moved the volume icon into the notification area on karmic, cause i used to keep it in the far upper left corner for easy access
2010-05-07T08:16:00.000Z	auk	undecim	but having to separate ones, with no clear distinction of purpose, is plain ridiculous
2010-05-07T08:16:00.000Z	undecim	auk	Yeah. I also wish I could just use right-click on the rhythmbox icon like I'm used to...
2010-05-07T08:17:00.000Z	undecim	auk	Right-click now gets a panel menu :(
2010-05-07T08:17:00.000Z	auk	undecim	well i could swing the mouse to the corner and scroll, bring volume up or down
2010-05-07T08:17:00.000Z	auk	undecim	are there any bug/feature requests i can vote for?
2010-05-07T08:18:00.000Z	undecim	auk	What do you mean?
2010-05-07T08:19:00.000Z	auk	undecim	what i mean is can i vote on a bugs to get these things integrated/fixed in future releases
2010-05-07T08:20:00.000Z	undecim	auk	Launchpad or Brainstorm you could
2010-05-07T08:22:00.000Z	undecim	auk	hey, check out gnome-volume-control-applet. Just found it.
2010-05-07T08:23:00.000Z	undecim	auk	It was already install on my system and gave me the applet like in 9.10
2010-05-07T08:24:00.000Z	auk	undecim	nice! i had looked at it a whole bunch as package but couldn't figure out how to get it back on the panel
2010-05-07T08:25:00.000Z	auk	undecim	oh but it's in the notification zone...the old one
