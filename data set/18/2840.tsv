2010-05-24T03:39:00.000Z	BrainDance		This is just a real stupid question, but I remember a couple releases ago, there was something sort of like the "ubuntu software center" that worked as sort of a more user friendly front for synaptic package manager, but from what I can see, ubuntu software center has replaced it, and I cant find it anymore. I actually dont care for the software center, and synaptic isn't that great for just browsing for new random stuff,, what
2010-05-24T03:39:00.000Z	BrainDance		 was the program I'm thinking of called, and can I still get it?
2010-05-24T03:39:00.000Z	BrainDance		yeah Slart I think that's it
2010-05-24T03:40:00.000Z	BrainDance		I dont know why I cant get into software center, I guess I'll poke around synaptic for it
2010-05-24T03:40:00.000Z	BrainDance		thanks a lot Slart
2010-05-24T03:40:00.000Z	BrainDance		also, is there sort of a general chat channel? Not tech support  but just talking about ubuntu/linux in general?
2010-05-24T03:41:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	#ubuntu-offtopic
2010-05-24T03:54:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	Found it -> gnome-app-install
2010-05-24T03:57:00.000Z	BrainDance	arand	could I just apt-get that?
2010-05-24T03:57:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	I was able in karmic, not sure if it's still there in lucid, but try.
2010-05-24T03:59:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	Also, it will pop up in the admin menu instead, so if you want you'll have to move it "sudo aptitude install gnome-app-install"
2010-05-24T04:05:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	That rather sounds like multiple package managers might be active at the same time is that the case?
2010-05-24T04:05:00.000Z	BrainDance	arand	I have absolutely no idea :P
2010-05-24T04:06:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	Close synaptic, software centre, etc. and run the command
2010-05-24T04:06:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	"sudo aptitude install gnome-app-install"
2010-05-24T04:07:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	So did it install it alright?
2010-05-24T04:07:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	Administartion menu, under system
2010-05-24T04:09:00.000Z	arand	BrainDance	Well you could just run "gnome-app-install" or possibly "gksu gnome-app-install" from terminal...
