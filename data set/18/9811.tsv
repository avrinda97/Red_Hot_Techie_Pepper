2007-02-19T10:54:00.000Z	sethk	S0nyX	you need ncurses
2007-02-19T10:54:00.000Z	sethk	S0nyX	including the dev packages
2007-02-19T10:55:00.000Z	S0nyX		i used search on synaptic for ncurses and i got a whole bunch of ncurses whichone do i install
2007-02-19T10:56:00.000Z	sethk	S0nyX	the most recent one, and as I said you need both the run time and the dev parts.
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	sethk	S0nyX	you need libncurses, libncurses-dev.  you don't need ruby support, don't need 64 unless you are running 64 bit, etc.
2007-02-19T10:58:00.000Z	sethk	S0nyX	but the pieces are small enough that no harm will be done if you install a few that you don't need
2007-02-19T11:01:00.000Z	S0nyX	sethk	it worked, thanks alot
2007-02-19T11:01:00.000Z	sethk	S0nyX	np
