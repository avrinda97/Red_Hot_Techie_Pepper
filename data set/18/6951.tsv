2008-05-04T14:32:00.000Z	brunner	adred	don't do that, actually

2008-05-04T14:33:00.000Z	brunner	adred	do that instead
2008-05-04T14:34:00.000Z	brunner	adred	your normal username should show up when you type "whoami" and press enter
2008-05-04T14:34:00.000Z	adred	brunner	no such file or directory present
2008-05-04T14:34:00.000Z	brunner	adred	type whoami and tell me what it says
2008-05-04T14:34:00.000Z	adred	brunner	it displays my username
2008-05-04T14:34:00.000Z	brunner	adred	so sorry. replace ".pidgin" with ".purple"
2008-05-04T14:35:00.000Z	brunner	adred	ï»¿cd ~; mv .purple pidgin-old
2008-05-04T14:35:00.000Z	brunner	adred	then install pidgin again and give it a shot
2008-05-04T14:35:00.000Z	adred	brunner	successfully remove. installing pidgin now
2008-05-04T14:44:00.000Z	adred	brunner	 i think the problem is it takes too long for pidgin to connect to my xmpp account that's why it crashes when i click the tab options. never happened before. thanks anyway..
