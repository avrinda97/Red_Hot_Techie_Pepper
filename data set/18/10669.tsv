2007-03-27T14:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jetscreamer	Thanks, I always assume that if tab completion works that the person is still here, obviously tab completion only partially worked and I missed it :)

2011-01-25T13:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jetscreamer	Gnea: Believe it or not that's how the installer is intended to work. The idea being that the first disk is usually the one the BIOS will boot from. There is no reliable way to tell the BIOS boot order from within a booted OS, and while I would prefer that they always installed grub to the same drive the rest of Ubuntu was installed to but...
2011-01-25T13:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jetscreamer	The mbr portion of the Windows bootloader hasn't really changed since the DOS days. It still just chainloads the first partition marked "active".
2011-01-25T14:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jetscreamer	No. He doesn't have the required modules to access any partitions at the moment :(
