2006-08-25T15:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	sometimes
2006-10-12T10:26:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	a quick question if I may?
2006-10-12T10:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	what can i help you with?
2006-10-12T10:32:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	would this --> sudo aptitude update  && sudo aptitude upgrade  give me the chance to uninstall the new update and reinstall the old one if it was borked?
2006-10-12T10:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	no you have to install the old version
2006-10-12T10:33:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	that's what I meant, if I use synaptic the old one is removed from my cache so I stuffed
2006-10-12T10:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	get it from packages.ubuntu.com
2006-10-12T10:34:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	using aptitude would allow to remove the dependencies when I com to uninstall
2006-10-12T10:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	yes but the depends didnt cause the mess up im sure. and upgrading is just that upgrade not downgrade
2006-10-12T10:37:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	I am looking for a possible way to 'roleback' on those odd occasions the devs mess up and let through a borked update, it has happen twice recently
2006-10-12T10:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	if your using devel/testing version i would have to say get used to it. if you are running stable there are a few ways to downgrade easist is to download package from packages.ubuntu.com and install it with dpkg
2006-10-12T10:40:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	ohh ok thanx, well I am using stable, i.e. dapper not edge
2007-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	we got a troll in here
2007-05-28T15:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	not needed to compile apps
2007-05-28T15:24:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	true, just makes life easier
2007-05-28T15:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	TheGateKeeper	IDE has nothing to do with compiling an app. its use for writing code and compiling that code you wrote
2007-05-28T15:25:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gnomefreak	I thought that is what he/she wanted to do
