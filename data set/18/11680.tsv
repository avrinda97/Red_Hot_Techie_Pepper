2006-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	Barkley		ext3
2006-07-06T07:31:00.000Z	Barkley		is there a way to use du -h to get the size of all the top level directories in the folder where you are looking?
2006-07-06T07:31:00.000Z	Barkley		beautiful thanks fyrestrtr
2006-07-06T07:32:00.000Z	Barkley		this is why ubuntu will win....the community doesn't eat it's young :D
2006-07-06T07:32:00.000Z	JohnRobert	Barkley	it's not a competition
2006-07-06T07:32:00.000Z	Barkley	JohnRobert	ok, ok
2006-07-06T07:34:00.000Z	JohnRobert		djbdns has one very easy config file, but it's more complex to install
2006-07-06T07:34:00.000Z	JohnRobert		you have to run djb's service deamon thing
2006-07-06T07:36:00.000Z	Barkley	JohnRobert	i was busy there for a sec, but wanted to say okok, perhaps i should rephrase that, this is what i have found to be diff and refreshing about hte ub community :D
2006-07-06T07:37:00.000Z	JohnRobert	Barkley	what communities did you have trouble with? I don't actually use ubuntu
2006-07-06T07:39:00.000Z	Barkley	JohnRobert	none, just observing a diff in the enthusiastic helpfulness amoung ub users
2006-07-06T07:40:00.000Z	JohnRobert	Barkley	I dunno, I think the helpfullness is probably mainly due to the number of people rather than the individuals :p
