2012-09-20T21:58:00.000Z	Thisguy_	TJ-	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1217231/
2012-09-20T21:59:00.000Z	TJ-	Thisguy_	why are repeatedly pasting a link to a pastebin? How about asking a question!?
2012-09-20T21:59:00.000Z	TJ-	Thisguy_	Is it causing you problems?
2012-09-20T22:00:00.000Z	TJ-	Thisguy_	OK, well to begin with, yes, it ought to be the LAST rule else the other rules won't be processed
2012-09-20T22:01:00.000Z	TJ-	Thisguy_	You are running a local HTTP and IRC server?
2012-09-20T22:03:00.000Z	TJ-	Thisguy_	Your rules are on the INPUT chain; that is packets coming into an interface from an external connection.
2012-09-20T22:06:00.000Z	TJ-	Thisguy_	What you want is a rule to allow existing ESTABLISHED, RELATED connections
