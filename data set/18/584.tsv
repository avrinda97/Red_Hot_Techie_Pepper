2011-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	colloquialismic	sbts-tv	no... it is fully connected :(
2011-12-10T07:28:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	hmmmmm, let me look again....
2011-12-10T07:29:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	do you have a network cable connected, or are you trying to use wireless?
2011-12-10T07:29:00.000Z	colloquialismic	sbts-tv	it is wireless, and my router is connected... i can use it on windows..
2011-12-10T07:29:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	ahhhhhh, wireless. what version of ubuntu are you using?
2011-12-10T07:33:00.000Z	colloquialismic	sbts-tv	I am using 10.04 LTS
2011-12-10T07:34:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	ok, click on the network icon, and tell me if your wireless network is listed there
2011-12-10T07:35:00.000Z	colloquialismic	sbts-tv	Yup
2011-12-10T07:36:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	is it showing as connected, or just available?
2011-12-10T07:37:00.000Z	colloquialismic	sbts-tv	available
2011-12-10T07:37:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	is your wireless net configured for some level of wep or wpa encription?
2011-12-10T07:39:00.000Z	colloquialismic	sbts-tv	uh.... maybe thats the issue
2011-12-10T07:39:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	I would start off by removing all encription on the network if you can. then test to make sure you can connect.
2011-12-10T07:40:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	once you can connect readd WPA2 encription.
2011-12-10T07:40:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	be warned earlier versions of the wireless stack did have issues with WPA.
2011-12-10T07:41:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	also make sure you use WPA and not WEP. WEP is very easy to crack
2011-12-10T07:43:00.000Z	sbts-tv	colloquialismic	iirc there were also issues with some devices that could operate in "WPA/WPA2" mode. you should always use either "WPA" or "WPA2" with wpa2 being the preference
