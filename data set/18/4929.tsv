2009-01-12T19:18:00.000Z	Eliteslave		Is there a test or anything to determine the stability of linux client?
2009-01-12T19:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	what do you mean by 'client', exactly?
2009-01-12T19:20:00.000Z	Eliteslave	Gnea	I mean this  computer that I built, Is there a test to determine that it wont crash or will crash? or what can I do to test it to its limits and see if it will hold up or not?
2009-01-12T19:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	any application that's system intensive ought to do - gimp, blender, openoffice, mysql, any spreadsheet app: gnumeric, openoffice...
2009-01-12T19:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	you could also write a shell script that opens up 50 terminals and then closes them
2009-01-12T19:23:00.000Z	Eliteslave	Gnea	 Mind you im a complete Linux nublet lolol
2009-01-12T19:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	that's okay :)
2009-01-12T19:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	it's a tar archive, not a shell script - you can tell by the extension: .tar.bz2 (it's a bzip2 compressed tar archive)
2009-01-12T19:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	tar xvf ts2_client_rc2_2032.tar.bz2  actually
2009-01-12T19:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	nah, everyone starts somewhere - it'd be dumb to give up ;)
2009-01-12T19:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	good! then you should have a lot of fun :)
2009-01-12T19:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	2 different programs
2009-01-12T19:34:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	very nice
2009-01-12T19:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	did you install 8.04 or 8.10?
2009-01-12T19:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	you might find more stability with 8.04
2009-01-12T19:36:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	plus, 8.04 is LTS, while 8.10 is not.
2009-01-12T19:38:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	also, I highly recommend that you bookmark and refer to these sites as well: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Guide  and  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Hardy
2009-01-12T19:39:00.000Z	Gnea	Eliteslave	yes.
