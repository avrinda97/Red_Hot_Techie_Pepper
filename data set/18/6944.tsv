2008-02-27T11:02:00.000Z	tharwat		hi there, i need some help
2008-02-27T11:04:00.000Z	tharwat		i have pclinuxos 2008, i installed the nvidia driver, but still cannot use compiz-fusion, although i did all the settings (like full 3D desktop effects), so is there any special driver for the nvidia geforce go 7600?
2008-02-27T11:06:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	doesn't the go series have their own drivers .. dif than all the normal line of nvidia drivers?
2008-02-27T11:07:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	i think so, actually i just ran the linux live cd, so i am really new
2008-02-27T11:07:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	I see.. even on windows i THINK that the go series has a different driver.. all the other nvidia cards use the same driver for all the cards afaik
2008-02-27T11:09:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	yes right... well, do u have any idea how to install the driver?
2008-02-27T11:09:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	but you have pclinuxos
2008-02-27T11:10:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	so that will not work on my system
2008-02-27T11:11:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	No thats not it, you just have to find the driver... Im not sure how pclinuxos manages their packages.. and since its not open sources, you cant build it .. probably gotta install from binary
2008-02-28T01:37:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	hey
2008-02-28T01:38:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	well, i think it's simple since they are linux, am i right?
2008-02-28T01:38:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	depends .. there are different flavors which brings different methods and behaviors .. different programs .. etc
2008-02-28T01:40:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	well, the 3D effects are not working here (compiz-fusion), what i had to do is to install the graphic driver, then it allowed me to enable the 3D effects, i logged off then back on but there are no effects
2008-02-28T01:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	did you install ccsm?
2008-02-28T01:41:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	whats ccsm?
2008-02-28T01:42:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-02-28T01:42:00.000Z	tharwat	ph0rensic	can i download it using synaptic?
2008-02-28T01:42:00.000Z	ph0rensic	tharwat	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
