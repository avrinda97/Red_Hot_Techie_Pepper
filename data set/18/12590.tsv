2006-03-30T15:56:00.000Z	gfunk		The problem is, after the splash comes up and it goes through those list of items that are followed by "OK", I get left with a screen that just has a solid dash in the upper left hand corner of the screen
2006-03-30T15:57:00.000Z	gfunk		now, I know that whatever is supposed to be working is working properly
2006-03-30T15:57:00.000Z	gfunk		because when I blindly type in my username and passward then hit enter, I can hear the sound of it logging in
2006-03-30T15:57:00.000Z	gfunk		but it still just shows the dash
2006-03-30T15:58:00.000Z	gfunk		I can get into the ctrl-alt-f1 virtual terminal to work with things fine
2006-03-30T15:58:00.000Z	gfunk		but if I go to terminal 7, the screen just stays with whatever it shows last
2006-03-30T15:59:00.000Z	gfunk		so whatever is running by default appears to be running properly, it's just that I don't see any of it
2006-03-30T16:00:00.000Z	gfunk		Has anyone heard of a problem like this before?
2006-03-30T16:01:00.000Z	gfunk		rescue-kernel?
2006-03-30T16:01:00.000Z	gfunk		Please explain.
2006-03-30T16:02:00.000Z	ic56	gfunk	what's happened there is that X has not started at all.  tty 7 has no process running on it -- that's why when you press alt-f7 your keystroke is ignored and you stay in your current terminal.
2006-03-30T16:03:00.000Z	gfunk	ic56	What about me being able to type in my username and password blindly and when I hit enter, I hear the entrance sound effect?
2006-03-30T16:03:00.000Z	ic56	gfunk	from the text only screen, try typing `startx'.  This is what is used to start X.  Watch the messages that will get displayed (on the tty where you type startx)
2006-03-30T16:04:00.000Z	ic56	gfunk	you have a point.
2006-03-30T16:05:00.000Z	ic56	gfunk	but I thought you said that when you tried changing to the X tty with alt-F7, you stayed in your current tty?
2006-03-30T16:06:00.000Z	ic56	gfunk	so, it switches ttys but you end up in what appears to be an empty tty?
2006-03-30T16:08:00.000Z	gfunk	ic56	do you have any idea what might be causing this?
2006-03-30T16:10:00.000Z	ic56	gfunk	The error logs should be in /var/log/X??   You could also try startx, after you've kill it with ctl-alt-backspace to see the error messages live on your screen.  As to the cause, I suspect a GNOME config problem -- it's displaying black on black.  I don't know how to fix that thought.
