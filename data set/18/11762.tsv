2008-01-15T01:51:00.000Z	Leonox		very extrage... I would say a MEGA BUG or what?
2008-01-15T01:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Leonox	Did you install flash.. are you running a firefox version other than the one from official repos etc?
2008-01-15T01:52:00.000Z	Leonox	Jack_Sparrow	"Every thing comes from the repository... with the exception of flash plugin"
2008-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Leonox	Everything from official repos.. except flash.. and how did you install flash and where did you get it
2008-01-15T01:55:00.000Z	Leonox	Jack_Sparrow	where did I get it I don't remember verywel... where to put it... well where every body puts the firefox plugins, /usr/include/firefox/plugins... IRC...
2008-01-15T01:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Leonox	I would remove flash completely and reinstall per the bot link.. I personally used the one from hardy and seems to work fine for me.. but works for me.. you know the rest
2008-01-15T01:57:00.000Z	Leonox	Jack_Sparrow	what about the extrange thing when I logged into Ubuntu... the small window get frozzed and doesn't disappear onece every thing is loaded
2008-01-15T01:57:00.000Z	Leonox	Jack_Sparrow	or the extrange thing when I want to turn of the computer...
2008-01-15T01:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Leonox	I would start with what we know is broken..  Something else is also going on as well
2008-01-15T01:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Leonox	I would look through your plugins.. there have been a few bad ones in here lately
