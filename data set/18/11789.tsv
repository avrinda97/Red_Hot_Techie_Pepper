2006-06-17T05:11:00.000Z	jdmpike	dayspring	I started using it with Warty
2006-06-17T05:11:00.000Z	jdmpike	dayspring	used to use gentoo, but I got tired of compiling everything on my laptop
2006-06-17T05:11:00.000Z	dayspring	jdmpike	Linux is great! prob is too many try it for 2 hours and go back to MS windows as soon as they run into a challenge in Linux

2006-06-17T05:12:00.000Z	jdmpike	dayspring	I may run gentoo on my new 64 bit server though - it can compile things a bit quicker
