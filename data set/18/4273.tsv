2009-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	littlegreen		I'm on the dualboot train and my ubuntu is installed "Inside windows" .... but not on the same partition. Now I know how to access the partition that ubuntu is installed on, but how do I access the partition, that win is installed on?
2009-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	in that case you cant
2009-05-07T23:38:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	since your not really dualbooting from the hard disk
2009-05-07T23:38:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	I have 4 partitions and I can access 3 of them. Why not win's partition?
2009-05-07T23:38:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	did you use wubi?
2009-05-07T23:38:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	yeah...
2009-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	then due to the fact that your not booting from a partition, your booting from a virtual image on a mounted partition
2009-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	got it... I don't like it but I got it ;-) Thanks
2009-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	its a technicall issue... not something chosen to be so
2009-05-07T23:40:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	you can ditch that by removing windows installing ubuntu on the partition and then installing windows inside virtualbox
2009-05-07T23:40:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	sure thing. I can just reboot and copy/paste the items I need and then reboot again and use what I want... or I can just make a seperate installation ;-)
2009-05-07T23:41:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	sure
2009-05-07T23:41:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	I don't think I have enough RAM to do so :)
2009-05-07T23:41:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	anyways... thanks again! bb
2009-05-07T23:41:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	virtualbox has been re written to consume as little resources as possible
2009-05-07T23:41:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	you should give it a try unless you have less than 512 ram
2009-05-07T23:42:00.000Z	littlegreen	fevel	that's exactly what I have so... I won't be trying anything. I'll just make separate installation ;-)
2009-05-07T23:42:00.000Z	fevel	littlegreen	even better
