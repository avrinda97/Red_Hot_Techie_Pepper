2004-08-17T07:33:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	OOo should be there and installed by default, yes
2004-08-18T05:19:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	use UNKNOWN in cases where a bug component doesn't exist
2004-09-12T16:32:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	uh? every British keyboard I've used is pc105
2004-09-17T09:54:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	for me, orinoco_cs is loaded my the pcmcia layer
2004-09-27T08:43:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	oh, you mean all of this is just plugdev?
2004-09-27T08:44:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	the plugdev group and all admin tools expecting sudo to work are the first two major issues i can see
2004-09-28T06:56:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	sourcing the bash completion script slows down starting a shell by a good second for me :(
2004-09-28T06:56:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	there is that :/
2004-09-28T07:47:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	interestingly, though, ntpdate runs before pcmcia
2004-09-28T07:48:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	urgh :)
2004-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	oh, this is the "we must install exactly the same set of packages on every system!" thing
2004-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	I keep meaning to jump up and down on mdz and jdub's heads until they relent in the case of pcmcia-cs :)
2004-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	surely that can be detected at install time :)
2004-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	yes, and debian-installer does so, but we have explicitly overridden this by policy
2004-10-01T09:50:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	which I think is wrong in the PCMCIA case
2004-10-01T09:50:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	ditto
2004-10-11T05:52:00.000Z	Kamion	rburton	not yet
2004-10-11T05:52:00.000Z	rburton	Kamion	ok, i'm just eager :)
