2010-11-11T10:47:00.000Z	lea123		Hello mine is an AMD Turion 64 bit machine with 32 bit windows vista loaded. What would you recommend me to do ? Install the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Ubuntu ?
2010-11-11T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	64 bit.
2010-11-14T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrWqKbqDQpU (I have not checked the accuracy of the instructions in this video, but I assume they're good).
2010-11-14T13:02:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	Thanks I clicked on it...
2010-11-14T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	You're welcome.
2010-11-14T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	Just finished the video and I can confirm that the instructions are all correct (and though the video shows dual booting with XP, it's exactly the same with Vista).
2010-11-14T13:12:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	See it uses the first option - install side by side - I am using the 3rd option manual partitioning just to make sure my recovery partition of HDD doesn't get overwritten
2010-11-14T13:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	It won't get overwritten.
2010-11-14T13:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	Go with the install side by by side option, it leaves no room for human error :)
2010-11-14T13:15:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	Last time somebody told me ubuntu "forgot" to install my GRUB and it happens once in a while... This was when after my installation it would boot straight into VISTA without even showing the ubuntu option ..  it almost shattered my notion of using a computer :)
2010-11-14T13:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	Yes.
2010-11-14T13:22:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	The video makes it look as its open and shut thing.. :) Dunno how good the experience would be after a few months as WUBI just stopped working one fine day .... Thats the mystery that I just can't seem to solve
2010-11-15T10:47:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	Thank you for you inputs for the Ubuntu 10.10 installation yesterday. I am finally on it...  Its good But the windows in Ubuntu seems to be flying all over the place unlike Vista which seems more disciplined
2010-11-15T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	You're welcome. What do you mean by "flying all over the place"?
2010-11-15T11:02:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	Sorry I lost you. The FF froze :). What I meant was the dialog boxes opened are not over the ones from where it was opened . I sometimes find it below the pile of opened windows especially the empathy window. login on one window and talk on another which is somewhere down, Each tabs on FF gives an icon on the taskbar...

2010-12-14T13:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lea123	See http://portforward.com/ for instructions on configuring your router for port forewarding.
2010-12-14T13:46:00.000Z	lea123	Jordan_U	:  thanks I will have a look
