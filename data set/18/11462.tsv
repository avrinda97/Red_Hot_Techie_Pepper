2009-07-20T00:47:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	yes,
2009-07-20T00:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	probably not
2009-07-20T00:37:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	it was worth a shot... flashcam is giving me sucha headache with it's "unsupported format" message
2009-07-20T00:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	Adobe Flash for Linux closed source, but at the moment the best for Flash
2009-07-20T00:40:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	i've got the latest flash from adobe, but without flashcam, flash sites don't find the camera, and with flashcam it only finds the input not the output,
2009-07-20T00:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	what's Flash cam?
2009-07-20T00:46:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	https://sourceforge.net/projects/flashcam/
2009-07-20T00:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	heh
2009-07-20T00:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	so you want your web cam to work with this Flash thing?
2009-07-20T00:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	if you hae enough RAM   you can probably virtual machine Windows inside Ubuntu for it
2009-07-20T00:49:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	i want nothing to do with windows... and no, not enough ram anyways.
2009-07-20T00:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	how much?
2009-07-20T00:50:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	512rdram
2009-07-20T00:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	I think you can do XP with that
2009-07-20T00:50:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	i don't want to do xp
2009-07-20T00:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	why not?
2009-07-20T00:52:00.000Z	GeorgeAScott	sebsebseb	with the exception of a laptop running 2000pro for school stuff, and my winmo phone, i am windows free and it seems that turning to windows to get something to work instead of fixing the problem is a stupid thing to do
2009-07-20T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GeorgeAScott	depends what your issue is, anyway you might get some luck if you ask  about it in ##linux
