2005-11-07T16:36:00.000Z	haggren		okay, i'll take another look
2005-11-07T16:36:00.000Z	JDahl	haggren	you might consider just vim or emacs for all you editing needs, and copy files manually
2005-11-07T16:39:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	Sanne: nvu is only for html - actually it support the ftp-thingy....
2005-11-07T16:42:00.000Z	JDahl	haggren	if you're going to do development with GNU tools, do yourself the favor and spend an hour doing the VIM and Emacs tutorials. Those editors are really good, but take some getting used to. Syntax highlighting and code-indentation etc. is at least as good as in any other language specific IDEs
2005-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	Sanne: right, you're not the first who says that
2005-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	Sanne: ill look at emacs tomorrow.. btw. quanta doesnt have the ftp-support at all
2005-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	Sanne: conclusion: nvu has the ftp.thingy and quanta the php-coloring... but neighter has both
2005-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	Sanne: thanks (btw: er i ikke begge danskere?)
2005-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	JDahl	haggren	I am Danish- and chosing a tool just for ftp support seems odd. Just "rsync" files to your server when you're done editing
2005-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	i'm used to use macromedia homesite so my first thought was to find a direct alternative.. I know there are a lot of alternatives
2005-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	still the direct alternative was easier
2005-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	JDahl	haggren	google for "GNU tutorials" or "software development GNU" or something like that. After a day you'll know all you need
2005-11-07T16:51:00.000Z	JDahl	haggren	the hardest part of using Linux and GNU is when you want to do things like you were used to in Windows
2005-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	I realize that... and that is actually also the reason a havent switched over before
2005-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	haggren	JDahl	now im trying again
