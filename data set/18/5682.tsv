2008-09-11T22:06:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT		I have a folder in my trash that I can't delete do to permissions, when I start nautilus with root privs the trash is empty. how do I empty this?
2008-09-11T22:08:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	trash folder as moved recently
2008-09-11T22:09:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	I checked /.local/share/Trash nothing in it
2008-09-11T22:10:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	ok. Just in case you didn't knew
2008-09-11T22:11:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	ya it's odd, my trash that I access by just clicking it from the desktop chows it. But I can't find the files from the command line, or when I'm in nautilus as root.
2008-09-11T22:12:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	are the files hidden? If you try ls in the terminal, it won't show them
2008-09-11T22:12:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	Ya I tryed ls -a still didn't see anything in the trash
2008-09-11T22:15:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	have you looked for the files in /root/.Trash and /root/.local/share/Trash ? In case they exist
2008-09-11T22:17:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	No i'll look now
2008-09-11T22:19:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	No .local or .trash in my root dir
2008-09-11T22:22:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	so, you can see that folder with nautilus but not with the command line? Is that right? What happens when you double in the trash icon?
2008-09-11T22:26:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	thanks for the help
2008-09-11T22:27:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	oh, yeah. If it's in pen or external HD, it always go for .Trash in there, not for your home folder
2008-09-11T22:30:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	I don't know. I think it depends if it's one file or several small files. It didn't took him too long to delete by accident my 50Gb music collection though :'(
2008-09-11T22:30:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	ouch
2008-09-11T22:31:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	too quick. It doesn't give you enough time to press cancel once you see the name of the files that are being erased
2008-09-11T22:32:00.000Z	carandraug	Winston_SmithVT	yes. And if you select to not erase the files from trash when you remove it, the folder will still be there with the files. Same thing happen with Mac
2008-09-11T22:33:00.000Z	Winston_SmithVT	carandraug	ok, ya that was my problem not knowing that the trash would be on the usb drive
