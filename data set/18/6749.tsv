2008-04-02T00:15:00.000Z	nbkr	david49	The "universe" is a software repository. Something like a great software store. You have to activate that source for your system so the apt tools are abel to use it.
2008-04-02T00:15:00.000Z	david49	nbkr	thankyou, how do I do that?
2008-04-02T00:16:00.000Z	david49	nbkr	is it in ubuntu, or a site?
2008-04-02T00:18:00.000Z	nbkr	david49	run "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and remove the leading # from every line that stats with "deb" and has "universe" in it. Afterwards run "sudo apt-get update" on the console. You can also do it via gui, but I don't know how the settings are labeld in english. I run a german ubuntu version.
2008-04-02T00:19:00.000Z	david49	nbkr	thanks very much, I'll try and decipher that..I'm a noob........
