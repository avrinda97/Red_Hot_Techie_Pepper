2006-09-04T14:58:00.000Z	warfy		hi, is anyone free that can help me out?
2006-09-04T14:59:00.000Z	warfy		i need to get Wine installed but i dont have internet on ubuntu for the package manager
2006-09-04T14:59:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	Wine is one of the few packages for which a source install is best.
2006-09-04T15:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	mkdir ~/winehq
2006-09-04T15:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	And Use ./configure --prefix=/home/warfy/winehq
2006-09-04T15:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	Then, export PATH=$PATH:/home/warfy/winehq/bin
2006-09-04T15:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	(You fill in the blanks)
2006-09-04T15:06:00.000Z	warfy	Arafangion	I got this error message at ./configure --prefix=/home/warfy/winehq
2006-09-04T15:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	build-essential
2006-09-04T15:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	Also, might need some other dependencies as well.
2006-09-04T15:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	Perhaps try sudo apt-get build-dep wine first
2006-09-04T15:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	Refer to what I said to ardchoille  :)
2006-09-04T15:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	They do, but not neccessary by default.
2006-09-04T15:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	It's about 300MB or so extra.
2006-09-04T15:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	Ask your friends to package up their apt archives onto a CD that you can use as an archive.
2006-09-04T15:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	You are going to have to get the .deb's somehow.
2006-09-04T15:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	All you need is a local mirror of some sort.
2006-09-04T15:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	warfy	If you had a friend who was also an ubuntu user, you could just get tehir archive, and use dpkg-scanpackages to essentially turn that into an archive.
