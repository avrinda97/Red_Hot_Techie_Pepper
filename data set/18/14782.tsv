2007-05-17T13:11:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	PrimoTurbo	does it show up in terminal ok? ... just restart Nautilus and see if it shows up
2007-05-17T13:13:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	nomasteryoda	the problem is not the volume itself, the problem is that I have an icon for a 174.3GB Volume left in my computer:/// I have restarted and everything it doesn't go away
2007-05-17T13:13:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	PrimoTurbo	you restarted the computer?

2007-05-17T13:41:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	PrimoTurbo	just hit enter one time now...
