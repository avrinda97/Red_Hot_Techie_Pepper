2005-03-06T12:19:00.000Z	|QuaD-		i just wish it supported ical!
2005-03-06T12:19:00.000Z	drgalaxy	|QuaD-	why?
2005-03-06T12:19:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	why what
2005-03-06T12:20:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	calandar sharing is nice
2005-03-06T12:21:00.000Z	drgalaxy	|QuaD-	yes, but ical just describes calendars.. you still have to redownload your buddy's ical file and merge it
2005-03-06T12:21:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	so?
2005-03-06T12:22:00.000Z	drgalaxy	|QuaD-	wouldn't it be nice to have the basis for sharing be at least as functional as the M$ equiv?  how about some protocol for notifying people of updates?
2005-03-06T12:22:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	take it one step at a time
2005-03-06T12:22:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	exchange is very $$
2005-03-06T12:23:00.000Z	drgalaxy	|QuaD-	oh yes, I know.. I wouldn't want to use it.. but ical has been 'out' for a coupla years now and the insides of it haven't changed
2005-03-06T12:23:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	i think its nice.... basically so that i can keep my calandar remotely and have all my pims access it and change it
2005-03-06T12:24:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	i don't really need it to share with others, but i have multiple pims
2005-03-06T12:24:00.000Z	drgalaxy	|QuaD-	obviously you don't work in a group
2005-03-06T12:24:00.000Z	|QuaD-	drgalaxy	no i don't... not yet
