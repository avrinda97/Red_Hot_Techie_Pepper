2007-11-01T02:31:00.000Z	mjbunink		Hi all, I hope someone can help me... I have a fresh Gutsy install, and apt-got Thunderbird. But after starting, the app just dies on me, without reason. Does anyone know what I should do?
2007-11-01T02:32:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	did you try running from a terminal and see if it spits out any error messages?
2007-11-01T02:33:00.000Z	mjbunink	hoarycripple	will do that right now
2007-11-01T02:35:00.000Z	mjbunink	hoarycripple	no errors.., ends with  /usr/lib/thuderbird/components/libcommandlines.so (loading of it)
2007-11-01T02:35:00.000Z	mjbunink	hoarycripple	still, it ends without explanation
2007-11-01T02:36:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	this is a completely fresh install?
2007-11-01T02:37:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	meaning that there is no .thunderbird settings directory or something similar hanging around?
2007-11-01T02:37:00.000Z	mjbunink	hoarycripple	with updates untill yesterday, yes. At least system wise, installed a couple of other apps, which have no connection to moz or otherwise
2007-11-01T02:38:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	ok, well i think you are stuck doind a backtrace. use gdb to get a bt
2007-11-01T02:40:00.000Z	mjbunink	hoarycripple	k, can you point me to howto's?
2007-11-01T02:40:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	just man gdb or search google, gdb backtrace
2007-11-01T02:41:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	are you sure, there's no .mozilla dir? if there is, try deleting that first and start tbird
2007-11-01T02:41:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	backup the dir first of course :)
2007-11-01T02:43:00.000Z	mjbunink	hoarycripple	there is a .mozilla and even .mozilla-thunderbird
2007-11-01T02:43:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	delete those after backing up to some other filename
2007-11-01T02:43:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	and then try to start it
2007-11-01T02:44:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	something might be corrupt in there
2007-11-01T04:19:00.000Z	hoarycripple	mjbunink	any luck with that thunderbird issue?
