2009-03-21T23:22:00.000Z	ShinyHat		can someone help me be able to play media on vlc from a windows network?
2009-03-21T23:22:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	hmm, can you tell us a bit more? thanks!
2009-03-21T23:25:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	so what doesnt work?
2009-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	ok, so you have no debug  message. to get one just start vlc from the command line and open the media file
2009-03-21T23:27:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	any special command?
2009-03-21T23:27:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	no, just 'vlc $media-file' for now
2009-03-21T23:30:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	anything in particular i should be looking for?
2009-03-21T23:30:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	you can pastebin the output if you want and we take a look at it
2009-03-21T23:35:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	sorry it took so long, first time doing that :)  http://paste.ubuntu.com/135032/
2009-03-21T23:35:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	dont worry ;-)
2009-03-21T23:37:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	you need to replace $media-file with one of your media files ($media-file is a place holder only)
2009-03-21T23:37:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	ok, but local files work fine
2009-03-21T23:38:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	we were talking about remote files, right?
2009-03-21T23:38:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	would a local file yeild anything useful
2009-03-21T23:38:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	where in the file system do i find the mounted shared folder?
2009-03-21T23:40:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	/mnt?
2009-03-21T23:40:00.000Z	ShinyHat	user___	not in /mnt either
2009-03-21T23:41:00.000Z	user___	ShinyHat	'mount' might help us
