2010-06-01T11:14:00.000Z	zetheroo		why does google suck now?
2010-06-01T11:15:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	occasionally its given me results sorted in a crap way while it gives my friend the results sorted better :-/
2010-06-01T11:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	Docteh	I see
2010-06-08T12:01:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	that R isn't doing it?
2010-06-08T12:02:00.000Z	zetheroo	Docteh	no
2010-06-08T12:03:00.000Z	zetheroo	Docteh	I just did that command from within my Documents folder and it only took care of the RTF's within that folder and not in the subdir's
2010-06-08T12:03:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	you might have to fiddle with find and xargs but i just suck at using it
2010-06-08T12:05:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	find -name "*.rtf" | xargs chmod a-x
2010-06-08T12:05:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	that may or may not be right btw ;)
2010-06-08T12:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	Docteh	running it from withink the Documents folder
2010-06-08T12:07:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	oh is there spaces in some of the filenames?
2010-06-08T12:08:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	check for something like "Swordy Reply.rtf"
2010-06-08T12:10:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	yea that command just doesn't work with spaces in file names
2010-06-08T12:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	Docteh	btw ... whats the xargs for?
2010-06-08T12:11:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	run just the find command and then look at that for filenames with spaces
2010-06-08T12:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	Docteh	someone from #linux just said to do this ... wdyt?     find -name \*.rtf -type f -exec chmod a-x {} +
2010-06-08T12:17:00.000Z	Docteh	zetheroo	thats why you're using find
