2009-05-01T02:49:00.000Z	testor		Hello, I have a problem with VERY slow write speed to vfat-USB-sticks since jaunty...
2009-05-01T02:50:00.000Z	deany	testor	known problem.. thats all I know.
2009-05-01T02:50:00.000Z	deany	testor	Im stayin with Intrepid for now.  Jaunty is just too broke for me
2009-05-01T02:50:00.000Z	testor	deany	Thanks. My temporary fix was to disable the new "flush" option for mounting, but that is not a final solution, I think... thanks for the info ! ^^
2009-05-01T02:51:00.000Z	deany	testor	no prob.. the lack of fglrx support for my card has no solutution!
2009-05-01T02:52:00.000Z	testor	deany	Oh... Glad to use nvidia, at least since the drivers became more stable. Even the proprietary driver does not work?
2009-05-01T02:53:00.000Z	deany	testor	there is no proprietary driver, thats my point..  its either open source radeon or , open source radeon
2009-05-01T02:55:00.000Z	testor	deany	What card is this exactly? *g*
2009-05-01T02:55:00.000Z	deany	testor	one thats not supported no more
2009-05-01T02:55:00.000Z	deany	testor	mobility radeon 256mb 9800
2009-05-01T02:56:00.000Z	testor	deany	Oh, okay. My oldest Radeon here is a x1250 onboard which is still supported... so... bad luck for your card :(
2009-05-01T02:57:00.000Z	deany	testor	i know..   In windows driver versions dont matter.. they do with xorg/ubuntu
2009-05-01T02:58:00.000Z	deany	testor	im not missing out on anything anyway.. other than bug finding.
2009-05-01T02:58:00.000Z	testor	deany	Yes... but if you're lucky, one of the free drivers might implement 3d accel ;-) Okay ^^.
2009-05-01T02:58:00.000Z	deany	testor	radeon OSS driver does.. just not very well..
2009-05-01T02:59:00.000Z	testor	deany	Mhm. Maybe furhter developement might improve it ^^.
2009-05-01T03:00:00.000Z	deany	testor	maybe.   Im not waitin for maybe.
2009-05-01T03:01:00.000Z	testor	deany	Okay ^^. So good luck for the future, I will now try to change my mount-options for usb :P Bye ;-)
