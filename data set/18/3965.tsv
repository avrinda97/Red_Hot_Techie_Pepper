2010-04-08T17:32:00.000Z	haavaros		Hi! I need to expand the partition where I have Ubuntu. Can I do this with a Live USB?
2010-04-08T17:33:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	Do you have a seperate /home partition?
2010-04-08T17:34:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	No, I have everything on one partition atm.
2010-04-08T17:35:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	I guess just moving the homefolder to a seperate partition would serve the same purpose. How do I do that?
2010-04-08T17:35:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	Wouldn't it be a solution to create a new big /home partition (maybe seperate hd) and moove all your personal data to that /home partition, as this is probably the biggest folder ;)
2010-04-08T17:35:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Yep :) Googling it now
2010-04-08T17:36:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	1. create a new partition with gparted --> format ext4, mpuntpoint /home .... ;)
2010-04-08T17:37:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Ah, much simpler than the guides I found. thx
2010-04-08T17:39:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	There could be some problems with user names... Could be that your user folder changes rights to 'user 1000 or so, depending the order your user were added... first user --> 1000'
2010-04-08T17:40:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	... but probably not... ;)
2010-04-08T17:40:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Ok ... I'll give it a go :)
2010-04-08T18:07:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Hm, to move the home folder, do I first copy the folder to the new partition, then change fstab, then reboot?
2010-04-08T18:09:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	I would do exactly that ... You may even copy the files and then change the fstab on the harddisk via a live CD.
2010-04-08T18:09:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Yeah, ok ... I'm doing it via my regular install now, first moving the files, then changing fstab. Should that work?
2010-04-08T18:11:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	In that case I would change your fstab via recovery mode left <shift> before grub stats, using nano.
2010-04-08T18:11:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Ok, thanks
2010-04-08T18:11:00.000Z	minimec	haavaros	np
2010-04-08T18:37:00.000Z	haavaros	minimec	Hm, I got it working now ... But do you know where my old home folder is now? Somewhere under / ?
