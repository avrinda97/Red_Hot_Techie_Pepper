2008-11-16T12:04:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	this is no error
2008-11-16T12:05:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	i get more or less the same every single time. does the pc boot normally after that??
2008-11-16T12:05:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	??
2008-11-16T12:07:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	does it boot normally ? then there is no need to worry. at that point the most worrying circumstance to happen is a kernel panic.
2008-11-16T12:07:00.000Z	phillipbeynon	jim_p	no the machine doesn't boot past it. It attepts to load xwindows but then drops to the terminal.
2008-11-16T12:08:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	wait. does it show the ubuntu loading screen?
2008-11-16T12:09:00.000Z	phillipbeynon	jim_p	the F8 terminal hangs. If I switch to F1 i get "Starting up …  Loading, please wait…  Ubuntu 8.04.1 (None) tty1  (none) Login:"
2008-11-16T12:10:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	then it loads but it does not reach X
2008-11-16T12:12:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	what vga are you on?
2008-11-16T12:13:00.000Z	phillipbeynon	jim_p	correct, it attempts to load.   the UBUNTU screen comes up and the progress bar goes half way across before pausing for a while then moving again for a bit, then the creen fills with "/etc/init.d/rc: 317: Permission Denied"
2008-11-16T12:15:00.000Z	phillipbeynon	jim_p	"What VGA" I'm unsure what your trying to get at here. it is a laptop, so I'm using the LCD.
2008-11-16T12:15:00.000Z	jim_p	phillipbeynon	paste here the output of this               lspci | grep VGA
2008-11-16T12:19:00.000Z	phillipbeynon	jim_p	"00:02.0 VGA compatable controller:Intel corporation module 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphice Controller (Rev 03)"
