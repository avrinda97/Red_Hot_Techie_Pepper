2006-09-23T12:42:00.000Z	ubuntu		i need help when my pc boot while loading the /etc/init.d i get permission denined
2006-09-23T12:43:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	did you at any point try to edit something in that folder?
2006-09-23T12:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	i dont quite know
2006-09-23T12:45:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	Okay.  This happened to me once when I changed the permissions on a file while trying to edit it.  Hmm.
2006-09-23T12:46:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	so what do i do
2006-09-23T12:47:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	go to /etc/init.d and 'ls -lo'.  Look for any lines that don't start with "-rwxr-xr-x 1 root"
2006-09-23T12:48:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2553 2006-05-23 10:39 bootclean.sh
2006-09-23T12:49:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    8 2006-05-31 01:33 stop-bootlogd -> bootlogd
2006-09-23T12:49:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	It's the same way on my system.  Hmm.
2006-09-23T12:51:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	Uh, I don't know if this will work, but try going to /var/log and posting the contents of dmesg to pastebin
2006-09-23T12:53:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	seeing the exact error might help somebody, and might not.  I can't imagine why it would give you permissions trouble if the permissions are okay, unless something horribly unpleasant happened to root's permissions
2006-09-23T12:54:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24548
2006-09-23T12:57:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	sorry heres the dmesg  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24550
2006-09-23T12:59:00.000Z	Asc	ubuntu	Huh.  Thought the error would appear on that.
2006-09-23T13:00:00.000Z	ubuntu	Asc	what do i do :(
