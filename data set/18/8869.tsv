2007-07-16T12:02:00.000Z	primski		tonsofpcs....hm, perhaps you need a fake dns server and give each machine a FQDN?
2007-07-16T12:03:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	primski	shouldn't hosts cover that?
2007-07-16T12:03:00.000Z	primski		hm, proly should yea
2007-07-16T12:03:00.000Z	primski		what mail server r u using ?
2007-07-16T12:03:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	primski	on ubuntu, postfix, not sure about the server
2007-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		i'm installing postfix on the server [deb]  now
2007-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	primski	tonsofpcs	aham... other than try and help u find some tutorial, i dunno, you prolly did all that allreay ?
2007-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	primski		you only need postfix on sending machine i guess
2007-07-16T12:06:00.000Z	primski	tonsofpcs	integrating whole mail functionality, is probably too much work for this, you would need a fully functional mail server with mta and mbox, and have a client receive mail thru pop or imap
2007-07-16T12:06:00.000Z	primski		just sending notes between two comps should be done with less compications imho
2007-07-16T12:06:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	primski	I don't need netmail, just mail between the two
2007-07-16T12:07:00.000Z	primski	tonsofpcs	how would you be sending mail? mail client, a script, maybe php ?
2007-07-16T12:09:00.000Z	primski		Yazzy, /etc/models
2007-07-16T12:09:00.000Z	primski		erm i mean modules
2007-07-16T12:09:00.000Z	primski		:P
2007-07-16T12:10:00.000Z	primski		falstius, only the ones i dont want others to see :P
2007-07-16T12:12:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	primski	simple mail from one system to the other.  nothing fancy, just a way to send quick messages to myself from throughout the house
2007-07-16T12:12:00.000Z	primski	tonsofpcs	hm, i dont know, how that could be achieved, have u considered instant messaging server, like jabber ?
