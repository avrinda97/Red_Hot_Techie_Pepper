2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	s_spiff		anyone here can help me out with dual ethernet card setup??
2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	s_spiff	yeah I have that probletoo I think
2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	Pulseaudio		It works when it's on roaming mode and dhcp for me though s_spiff
2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	Pulseaudio		but I need a static non-dhcp ip
2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	s_spiff	Pulseaudio	umm.. which means no static ip na?
2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	s_spiff	Pulseaudio	how do u do that? as in get it to work in any way?
2008-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	s_spiff	for me, that is
2008-06-01T23:33:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	s_spiff	I just turn roaming mode on.
2008-06-01T23:33:00.000Z	Pulseaudio		I have two ethernet ports myself, both onboard however.
2008-06-01T23:33:00.000Z	s_spiff	Pulseaudio	but then that'll deleted your ip settings .. won't it?
2008-06-01T23:33:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	s_spiff	yeah which is why it's sorta down atm, I can't use it atm
2008-06-01T23:33:00.000Z	Pulseaudio		so yeah I still have that problem of yours
2008-06-01T23:34:00.000Z	s_spiff	Pulseaudio	lol okies... damn, this setup used to work fine for me before, dunno why its giving me issues on heron!
2008-06-01T23:34:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	s_spiff	actually It worked fine on heron, but at one point it stopped to work
2008-06-01T23:35:00.000Z	Pulseaudio		I assume it's got something to do with dhcp on the router, but that's in my case and I could be wrong
2008-06-01T23:35:00.000Z	s_spiff	Pulseaudio	ohhh ok.. no idea how?
