2006-04-10T15:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_rules	apokryphos	would i be out of line to ask someone down the road to hack my box in this room?
2006-04-10T15:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	ubuntu_rules	not sure what you mean
2006-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_rules	apokryphos	i am installing a logger right now, and i have heard the best way to avoid being hacked is to ask someone to hack your box so you can see how they got in and fix the hole
2006-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	ubuntu_rules	perhaps. If you have a standard linux setup you're more or less fine. I leave the worrying to the paranoid 8)
2006-04-10T15:39:00.000Z	ubuntu_rules	apokryphos	i dont want to get banned for asking...  but i am going to be starting a small company running linux and i want to know about the security holes before i get to that point...  lol
2006-04-10T15:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	ubuntu_rules	asking for someone to hack you? Erm...
2006-04-10T15:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_rules	apokryphos	not at the moment
2006-04-10T15:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	ubuntu_rules	you wont' get a response, and the best way to find out about any vulnerabilities is to search google.
2006-04-10T15:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	ubuntu_rules	also, please only use the !op call when there's an abusive poster of s ome kind in the channel. Any other use is a  misuse :)
