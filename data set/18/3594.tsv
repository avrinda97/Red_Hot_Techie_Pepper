2009-09-08T03:03:00.000Z	Stewy		hi folks. i've been banging my head against a brick wall all evening. same prob on 2 separate ubuntu machines (jaunty and hardy). neither of them have firewalls, but neither seem to want to accept incoming connections despite the ports being correctly forwarded. any pointers as to where i should look?
2009-09-08T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	can you ping the IPs on the LAN. Can you connect to localhost on the systems? Can you connect over the LAN via whatever service?
2009-09-08T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	use tab to complete my name ;)
2009-09-08T03:05:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	ah, nice tip with the tab :) hehe
2009-09-08T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	then the port forwarding is wrong. I suggest you use static IPs to ensure the IP forwaring stay consitant
2009-09-08T03:08:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	port forwarding is spot on, on both machines which are on separate networks altogether. i'm wondering if i may have a problem with /etc/network/interfaces. the gateway is set,
2009-09-08T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	doesnt matter if the gateway is set or not, as long as the relevant IP is reachable from the first router with the wan IP you are connecting to
2009-09-08T03:12:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	right. hmm. seems strange that i've got the same problem with two servers on completely different networks. like i said, i know 100% that port forwarding is correctly set otherwise the emails would be bouncing on one of them! hehe. could my problem have something to do with the way i'm invoking the program i wish to connect to? i'm trying to launch a luxrender server and the command is ".
2009-09-08T03:13:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	but telnetting to it from outside the network from my machine at home gives me a timeout
2009-09-08T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	you could try a traceroute
2009-09-08T03:14:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	good idea! bah my brains not working :D
2009-09-08T03:18:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	even though i'm only 2.8 miles away, it's 12 hops away.
2009-09-08T03:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	something not right there
2009-09-08T03:19:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	well i am on virgin, and the other on Plusnet ;)
2009-09-08T03:23:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	well i'm stumped hehe. ports are correctly forwarded as the email server on the other machine works fine. all i did was add another forward rule to the router, but it's not reaching luxrender. yet it does from another machine on the lan.
2009-09-08T03:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stewy	try rebooting the router
2009-09-08T03:27:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	can't from where i'm sat. will have to do it when i'm back in the office tomorrow.
2009-09-08T03:27:00.000Z	Stewy	ActionParsnip	cheers for the help though matey. i think i'll tackle it with a fresh head tomorrow :)
