2007-07-06T11:38:00.000Z	yondie	Rhynri	well if u are in to propitery it`s better to use Norton Ghost
2007-07-06T11:39:00.000Z	Rhynri	yondie	the idea is to use OS softs...
2007-07-06T11:39:00.000Z	Rhynri	yondie	i've tried P.I.N.G. - but that didn't work that well.

2007-07-06T11:43:00.000Z	yondie	Rhynri	basicly u boot on a bootable linux like knoppix  or ubuntu livecd
2007-07-06T11:43:00.000Z	yondie	Rhynri	save it on a thumbdrive if u like
2007-07-06T11:44:00.000Z	Rhynri	yondie	- i'd do that, but i have more than a dozen machines to clone
2007-07-06T11:45:00.000Z	yondie	Rhynri	well u can place all of those PC in a bootable linux like knoopix
2007-07-06T11:45:00.000Z	yondie	Rhynri	dat`s sounds pretty cool
