2005-04-16T08:51:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	Try again, maybe someone here can help ya
2005-04-16T08:51:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	during install?
2005-04-16T08:52:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	be sure it's not appearing as /dev/scd0, depending on the system config ubuntu may use scsi emulation
2005-04-16T08:53:00.000Z	joaquinz	skreet	: nop... there's no any scd0.. :(
2005-04-16T08:53:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	do an ls /dev/s* -- what do you get?
2005-04-16T08:53:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	I'm using serial ata as well
2005-04-16T08:53:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	and my cd is /dev/scd0
2005-04-16T08:54:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	what does /etc/fstab call your cdrom?
2005-04-16T08:55:00.000Z	joaquinz	skreet	: and how can i do this?
2005-04-16T08:55:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	It would be in your bios setup, under SATA, see how it's configured, look for "combined" or "enhanced" mode...
2005-04-16T08:56:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	... on the same chain as the dvd rom or no?
2005-04-16T08:56:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	Same cable..
2005-04-16T08:57:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	Thats really wierd.
2005-04-16T08:58:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	Well, unfortunatly i'm out of ideas :(
2005-04-16T08:59:00.000Z	skreet	joaquinz	theoretically if both drives work in another os then they should work here... but theory isnt always practise.
