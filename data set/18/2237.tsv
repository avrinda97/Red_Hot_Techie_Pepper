2010-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	how to do that
2010-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	try running:  gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf     delete all text and add this line:   nameserver 8.8.8.8
2010-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	then save the file, close gedit then close all browsers and rerun
2010-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	ok will try that
2010-07-15T00:12:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	what does this mean ... 8.8.8.8
2010-07-15T00:13:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	I mean ...  nameserver 8.8.8.8
2010-07-15T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	its google's public DNS, it may help
2010-07-15T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	it needs to go in the resolv.conf file   instead of aything you have in there
2010-07-15T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	is it better now?
2010-07-15T00:17:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	I tried that ... still same result
2010-07-15T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	can you ping other sites?
2010-07-15T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	can you ping your router?
2010-07-15T00:17:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	yes
2010-07-15T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amit08	ok then the connection beyond is bad, try rebooting the router
2010-07-15T00:21:00.000Z	amit08	ActionParsnip	I am not sure if thats the problem .. since my IRC is connected using same machine
