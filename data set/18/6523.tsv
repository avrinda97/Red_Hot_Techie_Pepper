2008-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	TooFly		what internet browser do you guys use?
2008-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	TooFly		hmm, ok
2008-05-03T07:09:00.000Z	TooFly		I'm new to Ubuntu, and am having problems with the majority of web pages
2008-05-03T07:09:00.000Z	TooFly		They connect, but won't load.
2008-05-03T07:09:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	what browser?
2008-05-03T07:10:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	Yeah, I changed the ipv6ignore to true
2008-05-03T07:10:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	change it back to normal- to it's default value.
2008-05-03T07:11:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	if it doesn't work you should give a go at making a new Firefox Profile.
2008-05-03T07:12:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	Ok, how do I do that? Also, I ran an offline install since in the past my install would hang at "Configuring apt...". Could this be the culprit?
2008-05-03T07:12:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	Try going, within Firefox, to Help > Check for Updates
2008-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	Ok
2008-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	The option is grayed out
2008-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	Okay, make a new Firefox Profile through the instructions at this link... http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Profiles
2008-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	Ok. What is your thinking behind this? (just curious).
2008-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	it's a Mozilla link, just something I keep bookmarked for safe keeping in case my Firefox gets mucked up. ;)
2008-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	I see. I have a fresh install of Ubuntu (firefox packaged), no changes! Is it still necessary to make a new profile.
2008-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	pwn247	TooFly	if your original Firefox install somehow gets mucked up, it's always good to just throw in a new profile. It wipes out any about:config edits and malicious addons.
2008-05-03T07:22:00.000Z	TooFly	pwn247	Making a new profile did not help, unfortunately
