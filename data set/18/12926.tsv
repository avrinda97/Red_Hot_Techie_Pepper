2006-07-29T10:40:00.000Z	roostishaw	eyequeue	have write permissions for. all within a bash script... so i need one command...
2006-07-29T10:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	roostishaw	do they have +w?  even as group or other?
2006-07-29T10:40:00.000Z	roostishaw	eyequeue	they dont have write permissions, only read.
2006-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	roostishaw	echo "line goes here" >> filename, but they would need +w
2006-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	roostishaw	eyequeue	im writing a bash script that needs to edit a file
2006-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	roostishaw	eyequeue	and thats the problem
2006-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	roostishaw	without +w, they can't do anything
2006-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	roostishaw	eyequeue	there's not awk command?
2006-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	roostishaw	eyequeue	or something i could do with sudo?
