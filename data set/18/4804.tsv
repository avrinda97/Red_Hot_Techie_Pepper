2009-02-06T06:20:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	I've followed the ati provided instructions and the ones from that webpage don't work because for some reason I can't unlock my Xauthority file.
2009-02-06T06:20:00.000Z	^hashbang^	nkei0	if you can manaually start X then use the link provided above to install the ati drivers
2009-02-06T06:21:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	I can't seem to install it that way, because I can't unlock my Xauthority though.
2009-02-06T06:21:00.000Z	^hashbang^	nkei0	huh? if you run startx you shouldn't be prompted to logon...
2009-02-06T06:22:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	I've already logged in to the ttyl command line when I login.  So yes, actually it does.
2009-02-06T06:22:00.000Z	^hashbang^	nkei0	if you can start "X" from the shell you have logged into does gnome start?
2009-02-06T06:23:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	Yes.  However, I am very limited as to what I can do because my Xauthority is locked.
2009-02-06T06:23:00.000Z	^hashbang^	nkei0	look in /tmp and remove all .X files... also look in ~/ for any .X files and remove those as well
2009-02-06T06:24:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	Which exactly is ~/?
2009-02-06T06:25:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	Okay, there were no x files there
2009-02-06T06:25:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	None there either.
2009-02-06T06:26:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	You want me to run it again?
2009-02-06T06:29:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	I've already done that, when I did that and typed startx, it worked.  Now i'm up and running GUI, but I have no Xauthority and therefore can't update, use firefox worth a crap (no address in the bar, no back/fwd/etc), no synaptic, and other crap like that.
2009-02-06T06:38:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	 Alright, I'll try going at it like this.  Based off the binaryhowto from the ubuntuforum !ati refers me to...  I can run the first command, but when i try to "sudo insmod /lib/modules/`uname -r`/volatile/fglrx.ko" I get an error about No such file or directory.  What should I be doing?
2009-02-06T06:41:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	What do you mean, which driver am I checking to see if installed? the newest ati or fglrx?  I don't think it is because all that is there is wlan and ath stuff
2009-02-06T06:46:00.000Z	^hashbang^	nkei0	its for the kernel release
2009-02-06T06:47:00.000Z	nkei0	^hashbang^	Did you get my last message about how that driver wasn't in the volatile folder?
