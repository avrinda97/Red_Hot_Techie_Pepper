2009-02-11T05:24:00.000Z	redvamp128	bartek_	 I thought ubottu would pick up on that !sound
2009-02-11T05:25:00.000Z	redvamp128	bartek_	 though this may or may not help but someone gave me this to try to help get 5.1 (I haven't tried this yet) Setting 5.1 sound in Ubuntu Hardy <http://74.125.47.102/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.cristalab.com/tips/configurar-sonido-5.1-en-ubuntu-hardy-c55716l/&amp;prev=hp&amp;usg=ALkJrhhOdNjR8Uqh74R0K6aWG5G8KhWh3w>
2009-02-11T05:27:00.000Z	bartek_	redvamp128	link does not work
2009-02-11T05:28:00.000Z	redvamp128	bartek_	 that was a google link -- The original page was in spanish-- so you may want to goto the spanish page and then copy that link over to google translate
2009-02-11T05:29:00.000Z	redvamp128	bartek_	 this is the spanish link Configurar sonido 5.1 en Ubuntu Hardy <http://www.cristalab.com/tips/configurar-sonido-5.1-en-ubuntu-hardy-c55716l/>

2009-02-11T05:37:00.000Z	redvamp128	bartek_	 you may want to copy that link over to google translate
2009-02-11T05:40:00.000Z	bartek_	redvamp128	it does not help
2009-02-11T05:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	bartek_	 as far as your remote control -- I don't have a clue-- you may also try going to alsa site and see if there are updated drivers (or there you may find clues to configure your Hdmi better) Main Page - AlsaProject <http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page>
2009-02-11T05:46:00.000Z	bartek_	redvamp128	i have newest alsa and nvidia drivers; i am fighting with problem for a long time
2009-02-11T05:49:00.000Z	bartek_	redvamp128	my remote control works as if it is part of keyboard
