2008-06-29T08:50:00.000Z	oldbluebox		Whenever I startup ubuntu, when it gets to the login screen, it's blank
2008-06-29T08:51:00.000Z	oldbluebox		I think it's due to a bad graphics card driver

2008-06-29T09:23:00.000Z	tj83	oldbluebox	type lspci in terminal and one line will say something like vga adapter

2008-06-29T09:52:00.000Z	tj83	oldbluebox	i am pretty sure it should be /var/log/Xorg.0.log that is where mine is located
