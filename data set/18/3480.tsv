2012-05-12T18:58:00.000Z	dpac		How does ssh maintain a connection even after my computer is suspended and resumed?
2012-05-12T18:58:00.000Z	jimmy_birer	dpac	it doesnt
2012-05-12T18:59:00.000Z	dpac	jimmy_birer	That's what I had thought. And you wouldn't believe the sorcery  that happened just now. There was a power cut, right? So no internet for me. So I suspended, I resumed after power came back, and lo and behold ssh was still there.
2012-05-12T19:00:00.000Z	jimmy_birer		dpac:did the remote machine you ssh`d have the same IP?
2012-05-12T19:00:00.000Z	dpac		jimerickson: Same IP? It's my web server, so yes it has a static IP, if that's what you mean
2012-05-12T19:01:00.000Z	dpac	jimmy_birer	 Same IP? It's my web server, so yes it has a static IP, if that's what you mean
2012-05-12T19:01:00.000Z	dpac		jimerickson: Oops, sorry.
2012-05-12T19:01:00.000Z	jimmy_birer	dpac	then ssh must have been reconnected
2012-05-12T19:02:00.000Z	dpac	jimmy_birer	My private keys are protected by a passphrase
2012-05-12T19:02:00.000Z	dpac	jimmy_birer	ssh-agent wasn't running
2012-05-12T19:02:00.000Z	jimmy_birer	dpac	your ssh must`ve not send a disconnect event to your remote host
2012-05-12T19:03:00.000Z	jimmy_birer	dpac	and when you suspend your computer it saves anything on the RAM (including all the passphrases)
2012-05-12T19:03:00.000Z	jimmy_birer		so when you resumed everything was good
2012-05-12T19:03:00.000Z	dpac	jimmy_birer	That's possible, but it was a power cut. So my router turned off. There's no way my router can resume connections even after a power cut. And there's no way remote host would keep a connection active without keep-alive packets from me.
2012-05-12T19:04:00.000Z	jimmy_birer	dpac	ahh,didnt read the power-cut part.
2012-05-12T19:04:00.000Z	jimmy_birer		saint iGNUcius must`ve helped you
2012-05-12T19:05:00.000Z	dpac	jimmy_birer	It's mindboggling. I'll try asking on stackoverflow or something
2012-05-12T19:06:00.000Z	jimmy_birer	dpac	yeah
