2006-05-29T13:48:00.000Z	g-nome		how can i change priorities of processes?
2006-05-29T13:48:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	top is an easy way
2006-05-29T13:48:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	or renice
2006-05-29T13:49:00.000Z	g-nome	amphi	what does it do exactly, "reniced" that is?
2006-05-29T13:50:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	man renice will give you some info; do you understand how nice values work?
2006-05-29T13:52:00.000Z	g-nome	amphi	not really
2006-05-29T13:52:00.000Z	g-nome	amphi	but how can i change priorities in terminal?
2006-05-29T13:52:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	the higher the nice value, the lower the priority (ie. the program is 'nicer' to others)
2006-05-29T13:53:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	-19 is highest priority, 19 is the lowest
2006-05-29T13:53:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	non-root users cannot decrease the nice value (increase the priority) of a process
2006-05-29T13:54:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	top is a fullscreen textmode prog that you can renice a process with
2006-05-29T13:58:00.000Z	g-nome	amphi	thanks
2006-05-29T13:58:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	yw
2006-05-29T13:59:00.000Z	g-nome	amphi	how can i concretely change the priority with "sudo top" for a process, let's say id 33333 ?
2006-05-29T13:59:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	hit r, type the PID, and the new nice value
2006-05-29T14:00:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	type the pid & hit enter that is
2006-05-29T14:03:00.000Z	g-nome	amphi	it worked, however i don't know how to scoll the processes and is there a function to sort them?
2006-05-29T14:20:00.000Z	amphi	g-nome	top is quite handy for renicing progs
