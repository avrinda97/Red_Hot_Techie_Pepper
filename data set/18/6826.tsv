2009-05-25T22:22:00.000Z	ThePhoenix		does anyone know why my signal strength is really low on ubuntu?
2009-05-25T22:24:00.000Z	ThePhoenix		I am connected to the correct netowrk if thats what you mean
2009-05-25T22:24:00.000Z	ThePhoenix		no its not the signal. Windows was at almost 100%
2009-05-25T22:25:00.000Z	ThePhoenix		but im using the windows driver with ndiswrapper
2009-05-25T22:25:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	is this a fresh install or you had it a while and always been low?
2009-05-25T22:26:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	is your wireless card listedin the restricted drivers?
2009-05-25T22:28:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	System>Admin..>Hardware
2009-05-25T22:35:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	re-check the restricted hardware drivers section ...
2009-05-25T22:29:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	so the box there is empty? and do you have restricted  enabled in Software Sources?
2009-05-25T22:31:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	System > Admin..> Software Sources, go thru all the tabs and enable all but the "CD Rom..." stuff
2009-05-25T22:32:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	then reload and run the updater
2009-05-25T22:33:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	after you make changes in Sources, it "reloads" the list of updates
2009-05-25T22:34:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	run the updater now
2009-05-25T22:37:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	hrmmm
2009-05-25T22:37:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	hrmmm looking
2009-05-25T22:38:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	try this in a terminal,   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade sources.list
2009-05-25T22:45:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	well, you may have to use the ndiswrapper after all, and that is always "if-fy" I have to go for now, but I'll do some research - you can always find me in #seaphor, and others there that can help too, sorry but time for me to go
2009-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	SeaPhor	ThePhoenix	you still here? look at this- http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/Compatibility/D-Link
