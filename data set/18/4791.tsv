2009-02-09T01:05:00.000Z	silidan		ï»¿hi, im not sure im in the right chat, but ill just ask:  Is it possible to link 2 pc over sata II ?
2009-02-09T01:05:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	It's possible, yes... but I haven't heard of anyone doing it
2009-02-09T01:06:00.000Z	silidan	Slart	can you give more details or a hint to a discussion / howto?
2009-02-09T01:07:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	it's possible in the same way as building a 200 meter long car out of tooth picks...
2009-02-09T01:07:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	I have no idea how one would do it.. but I guess it would take at least a couple of months to build the hardware and write some kind of driver for it..
2009-02-09T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	then it seems you know more about sata and how it communicates than I do
2009-02-09T01:09:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	what makes you think someone has done it? it seems easier to just use a regular ethernet connection
2009-02-09T01:11:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	if gigabig lan it too slow you're no longer playing in the "low budget" division =).. not sure what they use in supercomputers.. probably something special
2009-02-09T01:12:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	but go read up on the protocol SATA uses.. if you're lucky it's just software you need
2009-02-09T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	try ##linux ... or check kernel.org
2009-07-06T14:13:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	hmm.. system corruption? I would do a complete reinstall
2009-07-06T14:14:00.000Z	silidan	Slart	i had this issues before after a reboot they were fixed
2009-07-06T14:14:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	you might be able to fix the problems you can spot easily but there might be other things crashing and running amok where you can't see them..
2009-07-06T14:15:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	oh.. well.. a reboot is a pretty easy thing to try.. but I would look into what might be causing the problems.. could be bad memory or something
2009-07-06T14:15:00.000Z	silidan	Slart	exactly thats why im asking
2009-07-06T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	there is a memtest option in the grub menu .. run that for a day or so
2009-07-06T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	it's best to run it from a live cd or from the grub menu..
2009-07-06T14:17:00.000Z	Slart	silidan	there are some memory checkers you can run while the system is running too.. but you won't be able to check all your memory that way
