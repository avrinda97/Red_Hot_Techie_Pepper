2008-02-13T17:43:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	they're not going to go in the Windows recycle bin if you delete them in ubuntu
2008-02-13T17:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	check if a Trash: folder was created in your Win partition
2008-02-13T17:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	do they appear in your normal trash? i think they should
2008-02-13T17:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	that's a normal emotion
2008-02-13T17:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	can't you just delete it with rm?
2008-02-13T17:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	yes
2008-02-13T17:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ntemis	rm /path/to/your/win/partition/.trashwhatever_the_name_is
