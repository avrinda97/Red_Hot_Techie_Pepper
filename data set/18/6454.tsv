2008-05-10T04:10:00.000Z	Krimson		I have to use "Roaming Mode" to connect to the internet. When I set up the manual configuration my computer will not connect to my wireless network. Does anyone have a suggestion? I set up the rest of the computers on my network, they all run XP and Vista. This, the Ubuntu, is the only box which won't connect with manual settings.
2008-05-10T04:11:00.000Z	Krimson		Can anyone help me with my wireless network problem?
2008-05-10T04:12:00.000Z	Krimson		Amenado, I know, right?
2008-05-10T04:13:00.000Z	Krimson		Amenado, everything works fine in "Roaming Mode". This used to run Vista just fine with manual settings. I know the wireless card works and all the hardware is set correctly. I'm connected to the network now with it. I want to set a static IP and, when I try to do so through the manual config GUI, it won't connect.
2008-05-10T04:15:00.000Z	Krimson		Amenado, that's the problem. I want to boot the roaming mode, but when I attempt to connect using manual settings it refuses to connect.
2008-05-10T04:15:00.000Z	Krimson		I set my internal IP to a free IP address on my network so it won't conflict, I've picked the correct network, etc.
2008-05-10T04:16:00.000Z	Krimson		Amenado, thanks bud.
2008-05-10T04:17:00.000Z	Krimson		Hey, fde, got a moment?
2008-05-10T04:18:00.000Z	fde	Krimson	please ask the entire channel, if I know the answer, I'll chime in.
2008-05-10T04:18:00.000Z	Krimson	fde	I've been asking. You were a lot of help last night, so I didn't know if you caught my question or not. I thought you might have been busy.
2008-05-10T04:19:00.000Z	fde	Krimson	ahh, I'm sorry, I have no experience with wireless really... still using a desktop machine...
2008-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	Krimson	fde	That's no problem. Thanks anyway for your time. =)
2008-05-10T04:25:00.000Z	Krimson	fde	Does that uninstall everything to do with the program? Such as if it leaves residual data (e-mails or accounts, for example).
2008-05-10T04:25:00.000Z	fde	Krimson	that will remove all config files and application files... but apt never touches /home
2008-05-10T04:25:00.000Z	fde	Krimson	or /usr/local for that matter.
2008-05-10T04:26:00.000Z	Krimson	fde	Thanks
2008-05-10T04:28:00.000Z	fde	Krimson	freenet isn't in the archive.
2008-05-10T04:29:00.000Z	Krimson	fde	Oh, my bad.
