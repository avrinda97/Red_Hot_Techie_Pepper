2006-10-23T07:54:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR		I too a new to Ubuntu
2006-10-23T07:55:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR		can anyone help me?
2006-10-23T07:55:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR		ok sorry
2006-10-23T07:57:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR		I wanted to move a folder to /usr/lib
2006-10-23T07:57:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR		but it's not allowing me
2006-10-23T07:58:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR		ok will try
2006-10-23T07:58:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	what are you trying to do exactly?  It sounds like there may be a better option
2006-10-23T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	I don't use eclipse, but can't you use a directory in HOME like ~/.eclipse maybe?  Or at least use /usr/local/lib instead of /usr/lib, that's reserved for the package manager
2006-10-23T08:02:00.000Z	xTERMiNATOR	jrib	shall I pm you?
2006-10-23T08:02:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	it's better to just talk here, that way everyone can help
2006-10-23T08:03:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	well first did you check if the plugins were in the repositories?
2006-10-23T08:03:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	have you enabled universe?
2006-10-23T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	np, that's what this channel is for.  Just search for 'eclipse plug' in synaptic.  That turns up a few hits here
2006-10-23T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	usually you will want to use the repositories instead since it will help you manage your software from a central location (and you are pretty sure the package won't break things).  realplayer is actually available in the repositories: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RealplayerInstallationMethods
2006-10-23T08:07:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	no, you have to click on that link and read it :)
2006-10-23T08:07:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	np
2006-10-23T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	xTERMiNATOR	it's loading here, try refresh?
