2010-12-31T06:18:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	it remembered the basic config!
2010-12-31T06:19:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	good to know.
2010-12-31T06:06:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	you can add startups but as for certain workspaces im not sure
2010-12-31T06:06:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	ok thanks
2010-12-31T06:07:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	system > prefs > startup
2010-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	in startup, goto options.  it has an option to remember which apps, test it to see if it remembers location
2010-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	isnt that just for logging in and out? no rebooting?
2010-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	i never tested it but i dont see why a reboot vs a logout would matter
2010-12-31T06:09:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	right. as i said, still new to linux so not sure what the command is for, say, xchat. not familiar with file sys yet..
2010-12-31T06:10:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	is it usr/bin/xchat?
2010-12-31T06:10:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	hint: right click on the applications bar, edit menus, then goto properties of the applications for clues. :)
2010-12-31T06:11:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	thanks. looks like command is just "xchat." Does that make sense?
2010-12-31T06:12:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	yes thats correct.. the reason is because xchat is in your environment path
2010-12-31T06:12:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	for reference, type env |more in a shell
2010-12-31T06:12:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	right, figured. thanks so much
2010-12-31T06:13:00.000Z	Doinkle	luxurymode	AlT-F2 is handy to know too.  it parses what is in your path
2010-12-31T06:13:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	oh ok didnt realize ALT-F2 does path only
2010-12-31T06:16:00.000Z	luxurymode	Doinkle	gonna reboot and see if it keeps window config. brb
