2005-08-09T16:55:00.000Z	craig		Thanks in advanceget xine up and running but iam not sure wat iam doing wrong
2005-08-09T16:57:00.000Z	craig		 all iam trying to configure xine i have the xine-lib-1.1.0 and xine-ui-0.99.4 in my home directory i just need 2 know how 2 configure them if someone can help that would be great..
2005-08-09T16:58:00.000Z	craig		iam not sure wat iam doing wrong i have tryed some how to's but it still dont seem to work
2005-08-09T16:59:00.000Z	craig		i think iam just to noobish
2005-08-09T16:59:00.000Z	topyli	craig	how about 'sudo apt-get install xine-ui'
2005-08-09T05:00:00.000Z	topyli	craig	what did you do? how did it fail?
2005-08-09T05:01:00.000Z	topyli	craig	i guess xine will just show up in the menu
2005-08-09T05:02:00.000Z	topyli	craig	perhaps the menu didn't immediately update
2005-08-09T05:03:00.000Z	topyli	craig	just xine
2005-08-09T05:03:00.000Z	topyli	craig	if a menu item doesn't appear, it will still be lots easier to create a menu entry than building xine from source
2005-08-09T05:04:00.000Z	topyli	craig	anyway, i wouldn't use xine-ui. totem has a nicer ui and it can use xine as the backend
2005-08-09T05:11:00.000Z	topyli	craig	kill the panel
2005-08-09T05:12:00.000Z	topyli	craig	and?
2005-08-09T05:13:00.000Z	topyli	craig	and you installed xine-ui?
2005-08-09T05:15:00.000Z	topyli	craig	xinetd has nothing to do with xine. remove it and install xine-ui
2005-08-09T05:18:00.000Z	topyli	craig	first, remove xinetd. then worry about xine-ui
2005-08-09T05:19:00.000Z	topyli	craig	xine-ui is in the universe repository. you probably haven't enabled it
2005-08-09T05:19:00.000Z	topyli	craig	^
