2009-04-02T22:31:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	problem is windows didnt overwrite grub might have something to do with how i installed it on a different hdd then ubuntu but i dont know
2009-04-02T22:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	i cant understand what you mean
2009-04-02T22:33:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	i installed windows to a third hard drive that i have ubuntu is on the second but after installing windows ubuntu is what booted. i am checking now to see if it is as simple as i forgot to make the windows partitinion a boot partition
2009-04-02T22:34:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	no it has the boot flag
2009-04-02T22:34:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	grub doesnt see boot flags
2009-04-02T22:35:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	hmmm well either way i cant get windows to boot
2009-04-02T22:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	make a entry into menu.lst
2009-04-02T22:35:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	thats what i did
2009-04-02T22:36:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	after that install grub again
2009-04-02T22:36:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	??? how do i do that?
2009-04-02T22:37:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	ok that doesnt really tell me how to reinstall greub
2009-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	maybe try hitting escape
2009-05-11T07:39:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	tried that 2 rebootsd ago it didnt work
2009-05-11T07:45:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	if you want to skip fscks do sudo touch /fastboot
2009-05-11T07:46:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	and what does this command do?
2009-05-11T07:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	it would create a file fastboot, grub generally looks for 2 files before fsck forcefsck and fastboot, fastboot would make it skip the fsck
2009-05-11T07:47:00.000Z	yowshi	arvind_khadri	and how do i undo the command?
2009-05-11T07:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	yowshi	the file gets automatically deleted after the boot, so if again you want to skip, you would have to redo that command
