2006-11-29T14:39:00.000Z	Alzi2	Chewy954	no prob :)
2006-11-29T14:41:00.000Z	Chewy954	Alzi2	mind if i pm you?
2006-11-29T14:42:00.000Z	Alzi2	Chewy954	Sure.
2006-11-29T14:42:00.000Z	Alzi2	Chewy954	Just one thing: you need to type /msg nickserv register <password> before you can PM anybody here on IRC
2006-11-29T14:43:00.000Z	Alzi2	Chewy954	and don't forget the '/'. It's really important! if you don't, all will be able to read it
