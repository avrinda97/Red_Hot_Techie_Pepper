2007-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	thefirstdude		and nothing is there
2007-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	I've got that problem too
2007-05-16T10:49:00.000Z	thefirstdude	FurryNemesis	did you fix it?
2007-05-16T10:53:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	just about to try again
2007-05-16T10:54:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	it works now
2007-05-16T10:56:00.000Z	thefirstdude	FurryNemesis	where get libdvdcss from, apt-get says it's unavaiblabe?
2007-05-16T10:56:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	that's bizzare
2007-05-16T10:58:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	sorry, the package is actually call libdvdcss2
2007-05-16T10:59:00.000Z	thefirstdude	FurryNemesis	says libdvdcss2 is unavailabe to?
2007-05-16T11:00:00.000Z	thefirstdude	FurryNemesis	what repositories did you add?
2007-05-16T11:00:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	I didn't - but you need Universe and Multiverse repos enabled. Got those?
2007-05-16T11:00:00.000Z	thefirstdude	FurryNemesis	yeh
2007-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	then that's very weird
2007-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	maybe the repos are down
2007-05-16T11:03:00.000Z	thefirstdude	FurryNemesis	I'm trying the main repository vs us
2007-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	thefirstdude	then I really don't know what's wrong. Sorry
