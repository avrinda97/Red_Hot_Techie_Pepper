2011-07-01T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	you've said that
2011-07-01T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	it means there is a problem addressing a memory block
2011-07-01T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	again - memory problem
2011-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	it's a memory problem
2011-07-01T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	you boot from the ubuntu CD which has memtest on it
2011-07-01T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	then you have a hardware problem
2011-07-01T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	it's a MEMORY problem
2011-07-01T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	control the language
2011-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	there is certainly something wrong with the memory, that doesn't mean it's the actual ram though, but most likley
2011-07-01T22:50:00.000Z	Pat_Fail	ikonia	should I boot with memtest86(not linux version) and see if theres a problem?
2011-07-01T23:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	what do you want us to do about it ? you've been told you have a problem with your member
2011-07-01T23:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Pat_Fail	there is a problem with your ram , we've said this numerous times
