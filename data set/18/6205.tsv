2008-12-13T22:51:00.000Z	uffo		ubunu needs driver manager for ALL system then it comes to simple
2008-12-13T22:53:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	what do you mean "restore system components"?
2008-12-13T22:54:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	gui tool to reset wiwi drivers or load new driver (.so files etc)
2008-12-13T22:54:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	drivers are generally modules, not .so files. .so files are libraries
2008-12-13T22:54:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	like windows with left click update drivers
2008-12-13T22:54:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	i'm not a windows user, i have no idea how it works in windows
2008-12-13T22:55:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	drivers here are modules, and modules in turn are either in the default Ubuntu install or in packages. if they are from packages, removing them involves removing the packages.
2008-12-13T22:56:00.000Z	LjL		!packages > badawi    (badawi, see the private message from ubottu)
2008-12-13T22:56:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	there should be tool to open module pack to install it like windows and reactos has open driver folder
2008-12-13T22:57:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	wait, are you telling us that you installed the madwifi drivers from a random package that you downloaded manually?
2008-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	from madwifi website
2008-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	why did you do that? madwifi is *included* in a standard Ubuntu install.
2008-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	you really should ask the madwifi guy, because Ubuntu only supports the madwifi drivers that it *includes*.
2008-12-13T22:58:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	with this guide http://probing.wikidot.com/ubuntu-intrepid-8-10-replacing-ath9k-by-madwifi
2008-12-13T22:59:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	ah well, no wonder things get messed up if you follow random unofficial guides
2008-12-13T23:00:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	but why someone do not make binary driver packs like windows has that can be added
2008-12-13T23:00:00.000Z	LjL	uffo	because that's very much against the Ubuntu philosophy of things being provided in both source and binary form in the official repositories.
2008-12-13T23:01:00.000Z	uffo	LjL	if i want source then i download but usually i need driver and just install it simple way with some driver install tool like it should be
