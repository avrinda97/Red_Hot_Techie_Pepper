2007-07-19T07:29:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	You have gstreamer plugins installed?
2007-07-19T07:29:00.000Z	italianninja	ShackJack	i dont know. im new to ubuntu
2007-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	italianninja	ShackJack	and its driving me crazy already
2007-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Proprietary things like Xvid, mp3, etc.. aren't included by default but are trivial to add ib...
2007-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	italianninja	ShackJack	vlc wont play anything either
2007-07-19T07:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Check out the Totem built in player and instadd the gstreamer plugins "ugly" good" and "ffmpeg"
2007-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	In fact if you have 7.04 it should prompt you when using Movie Player to install right plug in to play the file..
2007-07-19T07:34:00.000Z	italianninja	ShackJack	dont know what version im running?
2007-07-19T07:34:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Open you system monitor (under admin and check out the first tab)
2007-07-19T07:37:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	at any rate, look for gstreamer under add/remove and install appropriate plugins (read descriptions)
2007-07-19T07:39:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Ubuntu easier to use and better community :P
2007-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	italianninja	ShackJack	lol so why is nothing working for me
2007-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Did you do what I said? and what do you mean "nothing" working.. I'm sure most thinkgs are working..
2007-07-19T07:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Put it this way - if you can't get Ubuntu working, you'll have a harder time with many other distros... THough you might want to check out Mint of Sambayon which are Ubuntu based and have some of those codecs preinstalled... But not worth the effort as it should be EZ for you to put the codecs on yourself...
2007-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	All you gotta do is put the extra gstreamer codecs and your porn will play fine - mine does ;)
2007-07-19T07:46:00.000Z	italianninja	ShackJack	can you talk me through installing every possible movie codex for totem
2007-07-19T07:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	italianninja	Not much more to it that what I said - go to add remove programs/sound and video - look for gstreamer  -- see descriptions, but you wand ffmpeg primarily, and "extra" plugins pack
