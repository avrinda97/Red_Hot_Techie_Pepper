2007-12-19T20:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	cant you just add it like it was a cd in your sources/list
2007-12-19T20:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	You can burn your already downloaded to hard drive files to a dvd which will be in /var/cache/apt/archives
2007-12-19T20:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	and see above aptoncd is very cool..
2007-12-19T20:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	If you run this it will make a copy of your current sources list..   cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/Desktop/sources.list.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)
2007-12-21T00:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	 Ah...    If it were me.. I would backup my mbr with dd   I would backup my grub/boot/menu.lst    ..  one of many options would be.. cp /boot/grub/menu.lst ~/Desktop/menu.lst.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)
2007-12-21T00:27:00.000Z	soroush	Jack_Sparrow	thanks. what if it wasn't loaded?
2007-12-21T00:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	what wasnt loaded
2007-12-21T00:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	There are others better at tis, but I would boot live, format the suse partition and repair grub.. but have those backup files handy in your email account or wherever for reference...  a copy of fdisk would also help people help ou..  sudo fdisk -l > ~/Desktop/Partition.Layout.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T).txt

2007-12-21T00:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	Do you only have one drive in the system
2007-12-21T00:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	Is the suse already an ext3?
2007-12-21T00:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soroush	are you in ubuntu now?
