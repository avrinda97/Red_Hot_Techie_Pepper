2007-03-08T12:35:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	I hope I'm not interrupting, do you have any info on wireless issues with ubuntu?
2007-03-08T12:36:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	umm not much, just from whatever I have read
2007-03-08T12:36:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	ah. well, thanks for the response anyway :)
2007-03-08T12:36:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	you have something specific?
2007-03-08T12:36:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	yes.
2007-03-08T12:37:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	I have an application i just installed called WifiRadar.
2007-03-08T12:37:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	what is the problem with your wireless?
2007-03-08T12:37:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	and what is that wifiradar supposed to do?
2007-03-08T12:38:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	WifiRadar is supposed to be a network profile manager.
2007-03-08T12:38:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	am not familar with wifiradar though, so i assume it has a config file to store profiles
2007-03-08T12:39:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	yes, it does have a place to store profiles.
2007-03-08T12:40:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	i myself have not been successful with connecting to a WPA enabled AP..my ACX111 chips does not have the wpa_supplicant
2007-03-08T12:40:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	Ah.  oh well. maybe I'll have to change my setup then.
2007-03-08T12:43:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	i have not used WPA on windows either
2007-03-08T12:44:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	It works on my windows side.  I dual boot on my laptop.  One side is windows xp and that side works pretty well for the wireless.  It just isnt working when i try to use the linux side...
2007-03-08T12:45:00.000Z	bulmer	lori	on the windows side, you're also able to get WPA working? thats wonderful
2007-03-08T12:45:00.000Z	lori	bulmer	yep. it works ok, (for windows...)
