2011-11-22T16:59:00.000Z	Lasers_		Simple question. If I'm not on linux, is it possible for me to uncompress *.deb?
2011-11-22T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	should be able to
2011-11-22T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	you won't be running gnome so it should use fewer resources
2011-11-22T17:04:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	But I'm not on linux. I can't uncompress it. It recognize it as a Debian binary format. :)
2011-11-22T17:04:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	I'll deal with it later when Im on linux. Nom nom nom.
2011-11-22T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	rename it to tar.gz  and retry
2011-11-22T17:05:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	Okay.
2011-11-22T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	windows is dumb and uses the file extension STILL
2011-11-22T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		primitive rubbish
2011-11-22T17:09:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	OSX. Heh. tar.gz didn't do the trick. I ended up installing unp and it worked. ;0
2011-11-22T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	does OSX have the ar command in terminal?
2011-11-22T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		unp is the daddy!
2011-11-22T17:11:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	ar?
2011-11-22T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	yes, ar
2011-11-22T17:11:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	It does. I don't even know what that is for.
2011-11-22T17:11:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	"create and mantain library archives"
2011-11-22T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lasers_	then you can run:  ar x filename     and extract the deb
2011-11-22T17:12:00.000Z	Lasers_	ActionParsnip	I'll try it for experiments.
