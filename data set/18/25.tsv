2004-09-27T06:05:00.000Z	andred		I hope the Trash applet will work for all sorts of delete operations in the future, not just for Nautilus delets. That would be cool.
2004-09-27T06:06:00.000Z	jdub	andred	yeah, that's the intention
2004-09-28T08:41:00.000Z	jdub	andred	not added, bugfix uploads ;)
2004-09-29T09:05:00.000Z	jdub	andred	we have a bugfix coming for that soon
2004-09-29T09:06:00.000Z	andred	jdub	Will it work to drag it to the Trash applet then?
2004-09-29T09:06:00.000Z	jdub	andred	no, gnome doesn't do unmount-by-trashing
2004-09-30T05:21:00.000Z	andred	jdub	I needed to add a .fdi thing for my IXUS 400 in /usr/share/hal/fdi/20freedesktop/ . Will that have to be done for all cameras an devices that should work with hotplugging?
2004-09-30T05:21:00.000Z	jdub	andred	no, only ones that are not already supported
2004-09-30T05:21:00.000Z	jdub	andred	please add that as an attachment in a bug
2004-09-30T05:22:00.000Z	andred	jdub	Yeah, I have added it in bugzilla. But there are really few .fdi files in that directory, like 4 of them. Are others built-in in some way?
2004-09-30T05:22:00.000Z	jdub	andred	mmm, think so
2004-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	jdub	andred	in configuration editor
2004-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	jdub	andred	go to /apps/nautilus/desktop
2004-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	jdub	andred	turn on the special icons you wnat
2004-10-01T15:18:00.000Z	andred	jdub	I hae for a few days now. I like drag-dropping stuff to those icons.
2004-10-02T07:59:00.000Z	jdub	andred	we're going to modify it after warty is out
2004-10-02T08:00:00.000Z	andred	jdub	Based on that theme? I think they've done most of the job already, so it probably would be wise to use it.
2004-10-02T08:00:00.000Z	jdub	andred	yes, modifying it
