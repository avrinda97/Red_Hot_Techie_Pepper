2011-05-30T09:41:00.000Z	pishguy		Hi all, why i cant use this command into rnd.sh: number=$[ $RANDOM % 3 ]
2011-05-30T09:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	syntax is wrong? do you have the right hashbang?
2011-05-30T10:06:00.000Z	pishguy	tensorpudding	i can use this command out of .sh no problem: number=$[ $RANDOM % 3 ]

2011-05-30T10:08:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	it's probably a bashism
2011-05-30T10:08:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	yeah, it's a bashism
2011-05-30T10:08:00.000Z	pishguy	tensorpudding	how to use that into bash script?
2011-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	the shell that's used is specified by the hashbang
2011-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	you need it to be the path to bash, not to sh
2011-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	usually, /bin/bash, or /usr/bin/env bash

2011-05-30T10:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	pishguy	it's probably possible, using some kind of script in startup, but that's a complicated and annoying thing to set up
