2009-04-08T02:07:00.000Z	happyhessian		hello
2009-04-08T02:07:00.000Z	happyhessian		i am so confused about java.
2009-04-08T02:08:00.000Z	happyhessian		well, i think i have the packages and plugins installed and it seems that a lot of java scripts work but a lot of things don't work
2009-04-08T02:08:00.000Z	happyhessian		including sun's test http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml
2009-04-08T02:09:00.000Z	happyhessian		and some sites that are sort of critical for me to access
2009-04-08T02:09:00.000Z	happyhessian		sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre, yes
2009-04-08T02:10:00.000Z	happyhessian		which packages should i have installed?
2009-04-08T02:10:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	that site seems to work for me.. with the little moving java guy
2009-04-08T02:10:00.000Z	happyhessian	Slart	i just see the little white cow in the big white snowstorm :-(
2009-04-08T02:11:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	you have installed java?
2009-04-08T02:12:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	hmm.. not really sure what else could be wrong..sorry
2009-04-08T02:17:00.000Z	happyhessian	Slart	I get this when i try and follow the guide http://pastebin.com/m54a61741.  Is that normal?
2009-04-08T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	eh.. no... it's never done that for me
2009-04-08T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	are you really really sure you've installed suns java runtime?
2009-04-08T02:19:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	hmm.. if I were in your situation I would uninstall all the java packages and start over.. installing according to the guide and so on
2009-04-08T02:20:00.000Z	happyhessian	Slart	right, i'll give it a shot
2009-04-08T02:41:00.000Z	happyhessian	Slart	for sun java what is the package for the firefox plugin
2009-04-08T02:41:00.000Z	Slart	happyhessian	might be icedtea.. not sure
