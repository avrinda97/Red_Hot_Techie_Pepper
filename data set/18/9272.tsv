2007-04-22T12:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	paste the output of 'lspci | grep -i vga'
2007-04-22T12:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	ouch
2007-04-22T12:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	I don't think a driver exists for that :/
2007-04-22T12:05:00.000Z	neilther1	Amaranth	craaaap
2007-04-22T12:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	that sounds fine
2007-04-22T12:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	if the only problem is that you don't get a GUI run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg'
2007-04-22T12:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	that just means if it detects an error it'll remount the partition read-only to prevent damage
2007-04-22T12:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	yes
2007-04-22T12:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	neilther1	If you don't have X, yes
