2009-11-12T03:29:00.000Z	akrohit	arkanabar	try chmod u+rwx <directory>, and then move to that dir
2009-11-12T03:30:00.000Z	arkanabar	akrohit	chmod -r also?
2009-11-12T03:30:00.000Z	akrohit	arkanabar	no needed

2009-11-12T03:31:00.000Z	akrohit	arkanabar	use -R
2009-11-12T03:33:00.000Z	arkanabar	akrohit	 ok, did that.  tried to run WoW.exe from pcmanfm, "Access denied"
2009-11-12T03:34:00.000Z	akrohit	arkanabar	Check the permission for that file
2009-11-12T03:36:00.000Z	arkanabar	akrohit	"ls:  cannot access Wow.exe:  No such file or directory"
