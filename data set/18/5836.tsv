2008-08-14T18:46:00.000Z	allupp		sry bug
2008-08-14T18:46:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	I installed xubuntu, and a clean boot I have just 20mb more free memory than a clean boot of ubuntu
2008-08-14T18:50:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	why won't teeworlds work?
2008-08-14T18:50:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	I play teeworlds too :-)
2008-08-14T18:50:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	your graphics card isn't up to scratch? what is the laptop?
2008-08-14T18:50:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	what is the spec?
2008-08-14T18:51:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	damn small linux, by its nature, doesn't use much ram. how much ram does it have?
2008-08-14T18:51:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	how much ram, and what graphics card does your cimputer have?
2008-08-14T18:52:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	you have 512mb ram? I run ubuntu on a 512mb ram thinkpad
2008-08-14T18:52:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	runs fine, and teeworlds...
2008-08-14T18:53:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	try and explain the problem you are seeing... will teeworlds not start at all?
2008-08-14T18:53:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	that is better... things are so much clearer now... perhaps you can remember what is the last thing that happens before you think 'darn, it isn't working' and tell us what it is
2008-08-14T18:54:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	let's sort this out so we can all jump into teeworlds server and instagib you over and over again
2008-08-14T18:55:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	there are no errors right? you just see the menu to load a game?
2008-08-14T18:56:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	are you runnign fullscreen or windowed?
2008-08-14T19:04:00.000Z	kr0gur	allupp	you making progress? I just had a good game on teeworlds, was playing ASL
