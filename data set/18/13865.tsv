2005-10-07T16:52:00.000Z	thompa		the ubuntu installer is for realplayer8
2005-10-07T16:53:00.000Z	thompa		i used to be able to install from the web site the binary
2005-10-07T16:53:00.000Z	thompa		helix is same is it not?
2005-10-07T16:54:00.000Z	thompa		the ubuntu installer says to download the file from realone then change the name.
2005-10-07T16:54:00.000Z	thompa		big waste of time
2005-10-07T16:55:00.000Z	thompa		missing libstdc++.so.5:
2005-10-07T16:56:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	is libstdc++5 installed?
2005-10-07T16:56:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	"sudo apt-get install libstdc++5" should do it
2005-10-07T16:58:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	installed real ages ago, can't tell if it work now or not (not really keen on removing it to test)
2005-10-07T16:58:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	...but the version i have now is from their site anyway.
2005-10-07T05:01:00.000Z	thompa	Jowi	still its an extra step or 2. Ubuntu is supposed to be less steps not more.
2005-10-07T05:02:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	that's Real for you :)
2006-06-23T15:03:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	what kind of monitor? LCD or CRT?
2006-06-23T15:05:00.000Z	Jowi	thompa	try to run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and set the the monitor by size. if that doesn't do it, try the more advanced option. or wait to see if Ohzie has a better suggestion (i don't own a widescreen monitor myself)
