2007-06-07T16:52:00.000Z	Samuel		I just installed Ubuntu 7.04 i386 on my laptop. I have an s-video cable attached from the laptop to another monitor. How do I tell the OS to do a dual screen so I have video on both screens?

2007-06-07T16:53:00.000Z	Samuel	kitche	: Sec.
2007-06-07T16:53:00.000Z	Samuel	kitche	: Actually, where in the OS do I look at my vid card profile? haha
2007-06-07T16:53:00.000Z	kitche	Samuel	type glxinfo in the terminal but it helps to how what your card is so you use the correct driver
2007-06-07T16:54:00.000Z	Samuel	kitche	: Give me 2 mins, ill find out.
2007-06-07T16:58:00.000Z	Samuel	kitche	: It's a Mobile Intel 915GM/GMS,910GML Express
2007-06-07T16:58:00.000Z	kitche	Samuel	ok is the driver your using intel or does it say i810
2007-06-07T16:59:00.000Z	Samuel	kitche	: In glxinfo?
