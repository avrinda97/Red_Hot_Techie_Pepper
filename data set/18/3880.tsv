2009-07-13T07:28:00.000Z	ndf		i'm not 'in denial'; i'm telling you the problem is fixed and you just keep going on about how you know my xp box is infected and some virus is doing something. just shut up! nothing is wrong, infected or anything
2009-07-13T07:29:00.000Z	ndf		whoopdy doo!
2009-07-13T07:29:00.000Z	ndf		i don't care
2009-07-13T07:29:00.000Z	Aarchon	ndf	xp is a virus
2009-07-13T07:29:00.000Z	ndf	Aarchon	don't you start as well
2009-07-13T07:33:00.000Z	Aarchon	ndf	why did you feel a bit upset earlier if i may ask ?
2009-07-13T07:36:00.000Z	ndf	Aarchon	i was telling Skaperen that i had fixed the problem and he insisted on repeating useless information about irrelevant and incorrect information about how windows mounts usb sticks. then he went on about how a virus has infected my stick and is now taking over the files on the live install, which is complete rubbish, nothing is wrong, i fixed the problem and it most certainly wasn't
2009-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	Aarchon	ndf	Well, windows is crap on mounting usb stuff because if, say E: exists itll not even try to mount the drive as F: because it felt! like not doing it or something (garbage)
2009-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	Aarchon	ndf	do you like windows at all ?
2009-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	Aarchon	ndf	Place a document file on your right side of the desktop. Rightclick on it and then edit it, save it and see where it ends up.
2009-07-13T07:41:00.000Z	Aarchon	ndf	No, listen please.
