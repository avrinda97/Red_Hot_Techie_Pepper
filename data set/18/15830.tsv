2006-12-17T11:22:00.000Z	hendrickvp		how do I change that?
2006-12-17T11:23:00.000Z	hendrickvp		when I try to change a file through ssh, I can load it, but when I goto replace the file on the server it will not allow'
2006-12-17T11:24:00.000Z	hendrickvp		text editor in os x
2006-12-17T11:26:00.000Z	hendrickvp		I know, but I can't figure out how to get those permissions
2006-12-17T11:28:00.000Z	hendrickvp		when I type ls -l  I get, total 4 .....next line..... -rw-r--r-- 1 bryan bryan 3515 2006-12-16 21:12 my.cnf
2006-12-17T11:29:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:30:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:32:00.000Z	hendrickvp		the only problem with that is... I can not write anything from my machine that I'm editing on
2006-12-17T11:33:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	hendrickvp		well, I should say that with mysql yes, with ssh no
2006-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 can you explain more clearly how you are accessing these files   in what way are you using ssh?
2006-12-17T11:35:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 so you're copying the file to your mac with ssh gui prog, then editing on the mac, then copying back over
2006-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 you will have to copy the file back to the remote system to a separate location, the user's home directory probably.
2006-12-17T11:37:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 then you will have to use sudo on the remote system to move it to the correct location.
2006-12-17T11:38:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 the problem is, when you connect to the linux system with ssh, you have the access rights of the user you're logged in as.  this user can read, but not edit the file you are interested in.
2006-12-17T11:53:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 cp file.foo  /original/file/location/file.foo
2006-12-17T11:53:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 why do you need to fix your permissions?
2006-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	wastrel	hendrickvp	 what permissions?   the permissions to write the file?
