2006-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	fxn		Ubuntu hangs on "booting kernel" in a fresh install in an Acer laptop, I read in a forum I need to enter "linux noapci", but where? and how do I avoid that in each boot?
2006-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	eh, that is done on the first boot at the install and it works
2006-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	read about "other options"
2006-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	but in the Grub menu what do I do?
2006-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	has the machine booted?
2006-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	the machine boots, the Grub menu shows up, and if I choose Linux-server boots until the kernel is loaded and there it hangs
2006-07-10T08:54:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	there is an 'e' key to press to edit the boot
2006-07-10T08:54:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	yes
2006-07-10T08:55:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	if I press that in the default option I see boot/kernel/initrd/savedefault/boot
2006-07-10T08:55:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	do I need to add "linux noapci" there?
2006-07-10T08:55:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	use that - and only edit the "kenel" lines
2006-07-10T08:55:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	use that - and only edit the "kernel" line
2006-07-10T08:56:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	oh, so that line ends in ro quiet splash, do I just add noapci at the end?
2006-07-10T08:56:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	append it to the end of the line, yes
2006-07-10T08:56:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	great
2006-07-10T08:57:00.000Z	ompaul	fxn	when the machine is booted do this "sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst" that is a L and add it to the end of the kernel lines
2006-07-10T08:59:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	thank you, the advice in that forum is not helping unfortunately, BTW I recalled it wrongly before, it hangs after the trace "booting the kernel", so maybe the kernel is not successfully loaded indeed
2006-07-10T08:59:00.000Z	fxn	ompaul	it's a pity, it even configured the wifi in the installation
