2006-11-07T07:13:00.000Z	tylerl		I just edited my xorg.conf file, and added 1280x1024 to each of my display settings, however it loads in 1024x768 and wont give me the option to put it higher. Why?
2006-11-07T07:13:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	did you try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
2006-11-07T07:14:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	Yeah.  I'll do it again I guess
2006-11-07T07:14:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	thats what finally set the right resolution in my case... just though i'd point it out
2006-11-07T07:15:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	when it asks for the resolution, make sure you select only the one you want...
2006-11-07T07:15:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	Ok.  I have a standard monitor.. so above 1024x768 would be... 1152x864?
2006-11-07T07:15:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	Followed by... 1280x1024?
2006-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	i'm always on 1400x1050 .. i kinda get lost with all those numbers too so..
2006-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	Haha

2006-11-07T07:20:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	It worked!
2006-11-07T07:20:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	good =)
2006-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	My laptop is docked, so I can use this Dell LCD.. i wonder what will happen if i undock
2006-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	Will it use the same settings?
2006-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	try it
2006-11-07T07:22:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	Since this is an LCD, is it possible to set a separate refresh rate for Vertical and Horizontal?
2006-11-07T07:23:00.000Z	Akuma_	tylerl	that stuff is over my head, sorry
2006-11-07T07:23:00.000Z	tylerl	Akuma_	:) Np.
