2005-06-16T09:12:00.000Z	sproingie		the default accelleration is pretty damn hyper
2005-06-16T09:12:00.000Z	sproingie		i just had to turn it down
2005-06-16T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie		there's many variants of wine.  if you want to play games, wine stable ain't gonna help much
2005-06-16T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie		wine from cvs or dx9wine will do it.  if you want idiotproof, buy a copy of cedega
2005-06-16T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie		thus concludes my sum knowledge of wine, as i actually just boot to windows when i want to game
2005-06-16T09:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	what games force you to boot to that crappy OS <G>
2005-06-16T09:15:00.000Z	sproingie	neighborlee	oddly, the games i like the most both have linux versions.  i'm just lazy
2005-06-16T09:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	ahhhh ok heh
2005-06-16T09:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	I was going to say..neverwinter nights has native linux version just in case you are interested..nwn.bioware.com
2005-06-16T09:16:00.000Z	sproingie	neighborlee	i'm aware of that, i just don't care to fill up both my win and linux partitions.  lt's not like i do anything else when playing nwn, so i treat windows like a console
2005-06-16T09:16:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	ahhh ok understood
2005-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	we all hope nwn2 works for us too..
2005-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	keep checking happypenguin.org ;-)..there are tons of good ones
2005-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	never heard of it..although there are tons of kewl games for linux these days
2005-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	sproingie	neighborlee	progressquest is the ultimate RPG
2005-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	how bout: uplink or darwinia or tale in the desert or venetta...savage is interesting although I dont know if linux support is still ac tive
2005-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	neighborlee	sproingie	i was going to say wine might do it
