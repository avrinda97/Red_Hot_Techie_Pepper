2008-04-18T07:51:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		everything I am reading is pointing me to some kind of bios problem, but i'm praying that's not it
2008-04-18T07:52:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		tried with 2 versions of ubuntu also
2008-04-18T07:53:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		any suggestions on another way I can install?
2008-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		I don't think so, it recognises it as linux and spits out some info abou the version, then asks me to press enter to boot from it then fails
2008-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		I am paraphrasing here but thats about it
2008-04-18T07:55:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		yeah I tried with the alternate of ubuntustudio and the live version of ubuntu I believe
2008-04-18T07:57:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		I'm not entirely sure, I believe it's primary
2008-04-18T07:57:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		it was the only drive in the machine a pulled it from and I didn't change the jumpers so I assumed it was configured right
2008-04-18T07:58:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		will that shoe up in bios, I can double check
2008-04-18T08:00:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		i386
2008-04-18T08:01:00.000Z	Orbixx	pwndNoobFerShur	You can try netboot installing.
2008-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur	Orbixx	I need special drivers for my NIC for that or something right?
2008-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	Orbixx	pwndNoobFerShur	It's a bit long-winded.
2008-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		pelo, neato thanks
2008-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	Orbixx	pwndNoobFerShur	Google for "unetbootin".
2008-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur	Orbixx	that is looking like it may be my best option or at least a good fallback
2008-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	pwndNoobFerShur		Thanks much guys
2008-04-18T08:04:00.000Z	Orbixx	pwndNoobFerShur	No problem.
