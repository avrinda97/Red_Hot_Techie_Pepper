2012-08-08T14:17:00.000Z	llutz_		you*
2012-08-08T14:18:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	my problem is that the remote dir I'm trying to mount is encrypted partition, so I can't use ssh-key
2012-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	you don't use a key for that (still dangerous)
2012-08-08T14:06:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	you don't, you should use a ssh-key for that  *
2012-08-08T14:06:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	I know it can be done with a ssh-key, but I have a reason to use bash script with a password in it
2012-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	it won't work
2012-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	you mean there is no way bash can do it?
2012-08-08T14:08:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	i don't know if there is _no_ way, but none i know. ssh won't accept keys from commandline because it would be shown in processlist, which you really don't want
2012-08-08T14:10:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	do you mean bash processlist can  be seen outside my home dir?
2012-08-08T14:11:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	the processlist has nothing to do with bash and homedirs, it can bee seen
2012-08-08T14:13:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	it is not a problem that it is visible, I would only need to make the script wok in the way that it can automatically mount a remote dir
2012-08-08T14:14:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	it is a problem, because openssh doesn't accept it by design for this reason
2012-08-08T14:14:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	iirc you cannot circumvent it
2012-08-08T14:16:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	does it mean my root password and the password in remote server should be the same in order to mount the remote dir without need to type in password
2012-08-08T14:16:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	no
2012-08-08T14:17:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	if you use ssh(fs) and no keys, it always will prompt your for the password
2012-08-08T14:18:00.000Z	llutz_	u1204	well sry then, cannot help you
2012-08-08T14:19:00.000Z	u1204	llutz_	ok, but thanks for discussion anyway, I'm a bit smarter now
