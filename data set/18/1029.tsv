2011-06-27T19:49:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	how can I determine which of the HOWTOs are safe to apply to my system?
2011-06-27T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	kkulhavy	Which HOWTOs?
2011-06-27T19:50:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ScanningHowTo
2011-06-27T19:50:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	or sometimes the howto refers to a bugreport and in the bugreport people mention various tricks to make it work
2011-06-27T19:50:00.000Z	Pici	kkulhavy	None of them look like they would harm your system if you did them.
2011-06-27T19:52:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ScanningHowTo they say "Add saned to the group which owns your scanner device:"
2011-06-27T19:52:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	my scanner device is owned by root. But I am not sure if it's OK from security point of view to add the saned to the root group
2011-06-27T19:53:00.000Z	Pici	kkulhavy	Its a bit weird, yes.
2011-06-27T19:53:00.000Z	Pici	kkulhavy	But if it works, it shouldn't be an issue. If it doesn't work, then remove the user from the group.
2011-06-27T19:54:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	my scanner device is /dev/bus/usb/002/002 and changes every time I unplug and plug the scanner
2011-06-27T19:54:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	and the persma are rw-r--r--
2011-06-27T19:55:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	it doesn't work
2011-06-27T20:40:00.000Z	kkulhavy	Pici	thanks, with your help I found my problem is Bug #217571 which was open 3 years 2 months ago and still has status "Confirmed" and is unassigned.
