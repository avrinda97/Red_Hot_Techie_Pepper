2008-09-13T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	corky`	if you want to log in as the same user on different Xs, you have to enable that in System-Administration-Login Window

2008-09-13T00:02:00.000Z	corky`	soundray	without killing the first one!
2008-09-13T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	corky`	that's the point of Switch User
