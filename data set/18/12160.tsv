2007-11-02T17:21:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	are you running a 32 or 64 bit system
2007-11-02T17:23:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	did you update your repository list
2007-11-02T17:26:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	do the upgrade then
2007-11-02T17:44:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	do you have a solid LAN line?
2007-11-02T17:44:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	straight or through a router?
2007-11-02T17:45:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	if the access point is firewalled, you might not be able to update. I suggest borrowing a friend's hardline.
2007-11-02T17:46:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	try connecting to that instead then
2007-11-02T17:47:00.000Z	Olde	Madoo	only other thing I can think to do is burn off a copy of 7.10 to CD and update that way.
