2009-04-25T04:24:00.000Z	ReL1K		there any way to roll back from 9.04 back to 8.10 from a shell? i updated and vmware fusion is not playing nice
2009-04-25T04:24:00.000Z	h00k	ReL1K	what exactly is it doing?
2009-04-25T04:25:00.000Z	ReL1K	h00k	when i boot up into X, i don't get a mouse and keyboard
2009-04-25T04:25:00.000Z	ReL1K	h00k	tried copying the xorg.conf from a 8.10 install to try and fix, reinstalled vmware-tools, all to no avail
2009-04-25T04:25:00.000Z	ReL1K	h00k	also did a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, no lucks
2009-04-25T04:25:00.000Z	h00k	ReL1K	that was going to be my next suggestion,
2009-04-25T04:26:00.000Z	h00k	ReL1K	perhaps this will help: http://swearingscience.com/2009/04/04/ubuntu-904-beta-in-vmware-fusion/

2009-04-25T04:27:00.000Z	ReL1K	h00k	lemme take a peek, thanks for the help
2009-04-25T04:28:00.000Z	ReL1K	h00k	no go :( i might just start from scratch
2009-04-25T04:28:00.000Z	ReL1K		and rebuild
2009-04-25T04:28:00.000Z	h00k	ReL1K	do you have your /home partition separate?
2009-04-25T04:29:00.000Z	ReL1K		noper
2009-04-25T04:29:00.000Z	ReL1K		same partition space
2009-04-25T04:29:00.000Z	h00k	ReL1K	that should make reinstalling and reconfiguring easier, perhaps think about doing that
2009-04-25T04:29:00.000Z	ReL1K		yea, was dreading but really wouldn't loose that much
2009-04-25T04:29:00.000Z	ReL1K		since i got a shell can just trans over
2009-04-25T04:30:00.000Z	h00k	ReL1K	yeah, I wish I knew about your problem more to help you
