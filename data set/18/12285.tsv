2006-06-02T12:51:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	thank you
2006-06-02T12:52:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	i tryed that already but the Synaptic doesnt look like it shows there .. and i have no settings button :(
2006-06-02T12:53:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	The settings is amenu at the top, and I would use "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" to check it manually. Make sure any repos don't have # before them as well
2006-06-02T12:53:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	Sorry, a menu
2006-06-02T12:54:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	this settings here not the main one Click the Settings button at the bottom and tick Show disabled software sources
2006-06-02T12:58:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	are there any other good repos  i might need to add ?
2006-06-02T12:59:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	Not really. Ubuntu packages are now becoming common on websites, if you find you need a certain package which is not in Ubuntu
2006-06-02T13:00:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	thanks
2006-06-02T13:01:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	I will get flamed for this, but I use "deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ sarge main" for realplayer and flashplayer
2006-06-02T13:02:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	nice i will add it too, what about mplayer what would be the best choise ? 3 5 or 686 ?
2006-06-02T13:02:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	686 I think (I get mplayer from that repo as well)
2006-06-02T13:04:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	how will i get rid of the error saying that there is no key for  ftp://ftp.nerim.net sarge Release ?
2006-06-02T13:05:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	I just keep it disabled most of the time, I just prefer installing packages from a repository to prevent tedious manual download of dependencies
2006-06-02T13:06:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	but it couldnt be indexed by apt in source.list because of the key ... so there is no way i can get flashplayer or realplayer installed ....
2006-06-02T13:07:00.000Z	thug	Warbo	or it will work without too ?
2006-06-02T13:08:00.000Z	Warbo	thug	There is an option to tell apt not to bother with GPG keys somewhere...
