2006-08-08T10:16:00.000Z	livecdhelp		I am trying to chown the  /home directory because somehow it got changed and I need to change it back to my username. Anyone have any idea how to do this. Right now I am in live cd and I mounted the drive and tried to do "sudo chown john -R username /home" and it says chown: 'john' : invalid user
2006-08-08T10:18:00.000Z	mainer	livecdhelp	its sudo chown <username:group> like chown -R john:users /home/john,you get the idea
2006-08-08T10:18:00.000Z	livecdhelp		the group is not necessary is it
2006-08-08T10:19:00.000Z	mainer	livecdhelp	yes in terminal do chown --help
2006-08-08T10:20:00.000Z	livecdhelp	mainer	http://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchown.htm is that not correct?
2006-08-08T10:22:00.000Z	mainer	livecdhelp	not afaik i've used chowned the way chown --help specifys,it worked:0
2006-08-08T10:22:00.000Z	livecdhelp	mainer	if that is not correct, john is the only user on the computer, I haven't really set up groups or multiple accounts, so what would the group be?
2006-08-08T10:22:00.000Z	mainer		primary group s.b. users,or john
2006-08-08T10:23:00.000Z	livecdhelp		so john:users
2006-08-08T10:23:00.000Z	mainer		yes
2006-08-08T10:23:00.000Z	mainer		k
2006-08-08T10:26:00.000Z	livecdhelp	mainer	i get the same error message, I think it has to do with the fact that I am in live cd
2006-08-08T10:26:00.000Z	mainer		did you chroot first?
2006-08-08T10:27:00.000Z	mainer		or sudo su in live-cd?
2006-08-08T10:28:00.000Z	livecdhelp	mainer	I sudo su before the chown
2006-08-08T10:28:00.000Z	mainer	livecdhelp	you probly need root=administrator privileges
2006-08-08T10:28:00.000Z	mainer	livecdhelp	you need admin in live-cd to change it seems like
2006-08-08T10:29:00.000Z	livecdhelp	mainer	I know or think I know there is some keyboard combination that when held allows you to boot into console instead of x, do you know how to do that, it seems like I could change it there
