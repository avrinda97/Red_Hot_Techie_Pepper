2008-07-22T15:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	from that error, I'm thinking you may need a Windows font package (just a hunch)
2008-07-22T15:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	is it sendfax or sendFax ?
2008-07-22T15:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	you have used both so far
2008-07-22T15:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	ps -e  will show what is currently running/sleeping
2008-07-22T15:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	and   top   is also useful
2008-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	check in  System - Administration - Users and Groups  (tick the Send and receive faxes in User Privileges for that user)
2008-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	is not granted by default
2008-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	was or is now?
2008-07-22T16:07:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	ubuntu user as in running from a live cd?
2008-07-22T16:13:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	the .ps file is what gets sent to the fax device (PS = PostScript)
2008-07-22T16:18:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fsloke	can't help any further really sorry, never used sendfax. Good luck
