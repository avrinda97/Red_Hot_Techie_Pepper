2007-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	Stev		hem... hi
2007-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	Stev		i've a problem with network-manager applet
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Stev		i can see wireless networks but cannot connect to them (with other programs everything works fine)
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Stev		seems that it's all ok but dhcp :D
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Stev		if i manually run dhclient eth1 then it works
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	Stev		02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection (rev 02)
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev		if i manually connect everything works (or if i use wifiradar)
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev		no
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev		not now :P
2007-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	Stev		seems that nm-applet forgets to get an ip :P
2007-08-25T05:22:00.000Z	greywhind	Stev	i also had to disable networkmanager because it would fail to connect to networks, whereas dhclient connected correctly.
2007-08-25T05:23:00.000Z	Stev	greywhind	i'm just trying to easily connect to a wpa network, but now i'm trying to get it working on an open network
2007-08-25T05:23:00.000Z	greywhind	Stev	i use iwconfig and dhclient through a terminal, since network-manager wasn't working. it seems fine.
2007-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	Stev	greywhind	any solution to easily connect to wpa networks?
2007-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	greywhind	Stev	umm... i know that w/ ndiswrapper you need a wpa extension... not sure about other drivers.
2007-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	greywhind	Stev	look up wpa-supplicant
2007-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	Stev	greywhind	i'm not using ndiswrapper
2007-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	Stev	greywhind	seems a quite messy...
