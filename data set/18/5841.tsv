2008-09-04T21:54:00.000Z	spree	nebux	what is your sound card?
2008-09-04T21:52:00.000Z	spree	nebux	ask a question.
2008-09-04T21:52:00.000Z	spree	nebux	What do you mean they don't "work"? Do they sit on the couch watching TV all day? Be descriptive, ask questions, be specific.
2008-09-04T21:53:00.000Z	spree	nebux	Do NOT private message me.
2008-09-04T21:53:00.000Z	spree	nebux	Nothing you private messaged me was read. Start over in the channel.
2008-09-04T21:55:00.000Z	spree	nebux	are you using a 64 bit processor
2008-09-04T21:56:00.000Z	spree	nebux	read this thread https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/234066
2008-09-04T21:56:00.000Z	spree	nebux	Looks like you need to set your sound preferences from autodetect to ALSA or PulseAudio solves the problem. Read the link I sent you there are instructions.
2008-09-04T21:58:00.000Z	spree	nebux	if it's not solved immediately, make sure you have saved your preferences, log out and reboot. It's an easy way to make sure there's not some program hogging your sound card resources and ensures the setting is saved.
2008-09-04T22:04:00.000Z	spree	nebux	and?
2008-09-04T22:05:00.000Z	spree	nebux	did it work? are you fixed?
2008-09-04T22:06:00.000Z	spree	nebux	try switching to all PulseAudio rather than ALSA then, maybe that will fix it. Also, are you running Flash 10 or 9
