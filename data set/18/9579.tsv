2007-03-30T06:49:00.000Z	need411		simple filesharing?  anyone care to point me to the wiki?
2007-03-30T06:49:00.000Z	need411		no no..  from my feisty (laptop) to my edgy (desktop)
2007-03-30T06:50:00.000Z	neozen	need411	ssh
2007-03-30T06:50:00.000Z	neozen	need411	stick openssh-server on one of them
2007-03-30T06:50:00.000Z	neozen	need411	that is probably the simplest way I've found of doing file transfers
2007-03-30T06:51:00.000Z	neozen	need411	never bothered installing ftp on my home server since I just use gftp (which can do ssh2 transfers) or winscp on windows to transfer stuff
2007-03-30T06:55:00.000Z	neozen	need411	for that... research nfs or samba
2007-03-30T06:55:00.000Z	neozen	need411	there... it gets a tad bit more complex (and I can't help you)
2007-03-30T06:56:00.000Z	neozen	need411	I think nfs is more linux2linux oriented... and might be simpler to set up
2007-03-30T06:56:00.000Z	neozen	need411	but I could be wrong
2007-03-30T06:57:00.000Z	neozen	need411	samba is ...... interesting
2007-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	neozen	need411	that's something I haven't really delved into yet... as I haven't found it essential to do so
2007-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	neozen	need411	lol.... I figure I'm a month or so away from using it
2007-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	neozen	need411	that's samba...
2007-03-30T06:59:00.000Z	neozen	need411	once you understand how crufty the protocol is .... you realize why they needed the big rig
2007-03-30T07:00:00.000Z	neozen	need411	indeed
2007-03-30T07:00:00.000Z	neozen	need411	here's some info http://nfs.sourceforge.net/
2007-03-30T07:01:00.000Z	neozen	need411	np
