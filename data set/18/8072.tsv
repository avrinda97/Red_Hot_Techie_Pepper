2007-11-04T03:15:00.000Z	pwnt-		any VLC expert here? I need help transcode some streaming online video.
2007-11-04T03:15:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	I'm hardly an expert but have fiddled with transcoding a number of things ... I assume you have gone through the transcoding docs ?
2007-11-04T03:16:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	although I'm ashamed to say the only transcoding I have done is on Windoze
2007-11-04T03:17:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	No i'm trying to transcode a video, connecting to my http://localhost:port - and then trying to record that streaming live video okay. when I click transcode and choosed mpeg2. and then raw. I click filename then finish, it starts recording but here it doesn't preview the picture, so I can't WATCH while recording, thats one issue, and #2 issue is that the record doesn't have sound.
2007-11-04T03:20:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	I have found similar issues when transcoding, particularlywhen dealing with basic mpeg2...I found I had to try various audio transcodings as sometime video would be fine but no sound, or certain combinations then could not be played by other devices
2007-11-04T03:20:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	what do I do then..
2007-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	are you using the GUI or the command line ?
2007-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	i'm in X. i just opened VLC. then trying to transcode by going to file > wizard, so yeah its a gui
2007-11-04T03:24:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	I can show you some of the full transcode commands I use if that helps
2007-11-04T03:24:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	I'd like to transcode the live stream + watching it in the same time, does your command do that?
2007-11-04T03:26:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	no but since you are getting some joy i.e. video but no sound then it may give you some ideas
2007-11-04T03:26:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	okay
2007-11-04T03:27:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	alternatively, what is your setting for the acodec=
2007-11-04T03:28:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	anything good, I'm not sure. pretty new with that, but i'd like to see good quality picture later on. and i'd love to put that match/video into a dvd. just like those dvd movies.
2007-11-04T03:33:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	standby preparing pastebin of samples
2007-11-04T03:38:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	ok here are some that I use. Maybe you can glean something from them otherwise sorry I can't help. As I said mainly trial and error got me what I wanted... I assure you VLC is capable of what you want so don't give up. http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m647d984d
2007-11-04T03:40:00.000Z	pwnt-	hipitihop	it doesn't record the sound
2007-11-04T03:45:00.000Z	hipitihop	pwnt-	As I said I have not doen transcoding on linux so if you are using any of the MP3 variantes without having the coded installed then it won't work
