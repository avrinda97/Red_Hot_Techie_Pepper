2007-07-14T16:05:00.000Z	BlackDesign		there you go :p
2007-07-14T16:05:00.000Z	BlackDesign		but anyone here who can help me with that grub prob?
2007-07-14T16:06:00.000Z	BlackDesign		yes, but I can't enter my linux now
2007-07-14T16:06:00.000Z	BlackDesign		it doesn't load the grub so...
2007-07-14T16:07:00.000Z	BlackDesign		I read something about reinstalling the grub through Live cd
2007-07-14T16:07:00.000Z	BlackDesign		but I don't know how
2007-07-14T16:07:00.000Z	BlackDesign		The strange thing is, I didn't reinstall windows or somehting...
2007-07-14T16:07:00.000Z	BlackDesign		sometimes it worked, other times it gave that error...
2007-07-14T16:07:00.000Z	BlackDesign		so I used to reset the computer and it was gone
2007-07-14T16:07:00.000Z	BlackDesign		now it keeps appearing
2007-07-14T16:08:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	did you do anything different between when it worked and when it didnt?
2007-07-14T16:10:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	it seems weird that it works and then doesnt... is the drive itself in good shape? did you try mounting it using a live cd to see if its working?
2007-07-14T16:13:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	oh, didnt see your message there
2007-07-14T16:20:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	how do you mean?
2007-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	if it's suddenly working then it likely isnt grub
2007-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	seems like either a hardware or bios thing to me
2007-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	if it was grub itself it would seem that you'd get the problem every time
2007-07-14T16:38:00.000Z	xhaan	BlackDesign	i hope its fixed then, itd be weird if that fixed it though
