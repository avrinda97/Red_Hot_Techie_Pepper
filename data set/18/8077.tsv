2007-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	silent	Snuxoll	it doesnt look professional enough
2007-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	silent	Snuxoll	companies like softer blends, not sharp vivid bright colours
2007-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	Snuxoll	silent	How does it not look professional?
2007-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	Snuxoll	silent	My colors aren't that sharp
2007-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	silent	Snuxoll	not ripping it, its a great theme, but i dont think it will be default
2007-10-15T12:18:00.000Z	silent	Snuxoll	honestly, change the orange to something softer and it's golden
2007-10-15T12:18:00.000Z	silent	Snuxoll	maybe darken a little
2007-10-15T12:18:00.000Z	Snuxoll	silent	OK, hold on
2007-10-15T12:20:00.000Z	silent	Snuxoll	I'm surprised you still use the default layout... I have a single panel on the left
2007-10-15T12:21:00.000Z	Snuxoll	silent	I'm quite happy with the default layout
