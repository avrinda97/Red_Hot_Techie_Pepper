2006-12-21T14:39:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		i'm convinced there's a firewall of some kind running on my 6.10 because port forwarding is working to other machines in the office but not to this server, regardless of what service is running.
2006-12-21T14:39:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		alternately every service on my machine is only listening to loopback.  how can i check to see which case is the problem?
2006-12-21T14:40:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	configure each service one by one, there is no default fire wall installed in desktop edition
2006-12-21T14:41:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- i've been trying for the last 4 hours.  i can access apache and ssh locally but i can't from the outside world.  can you help me a bit?
2006-12-21T14:41:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	I am pretty much sure that , 6.10 desktop edition do not have a firewall installed out of box
2006-12-21T14:42:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- it's server version, if that matters.
2006-12-21T14:42:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	yes it matters
2006-12-21T14:42:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- i check how?
2006-12-21T14:43:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- droyer 12307 7456 0 12:43 pts/0  00:00:00 grep firestarter
2006-12-21T14:44:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	try ps -ef | grep firestarter
2006-12-21T14:45:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- i did.  then i posted the output ("droyer 12310 " etc)
2006-12-21T14:45:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	hmm, then you should study your services. Sorry I never installed server version. I am using a desktop version for a server :)
2006-12-21T14:46:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- by study my services you mean check my config files?
2006-12-21T14:48:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	let me check
2006-12-21T14:50:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- i'm reading online and apparently iptables is running?  again, not sure how to check.  i'm very n00b
2006-12-21T14:50:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	 sudo apt-get install sysvconfig
2006-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	reverseblade	- couldn't find sysvconfig
2006-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	Aggrav8d	it is a program for inspecting services. try to enable the repos
