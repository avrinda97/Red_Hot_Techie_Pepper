2008-04-17T08:51:00.000Z	Ongaku		ok, I´m having some giant problem...I just installed this on a new computer...and it won´t load in regular mode..it just goes completely black and does nothing...so I have to go into recovery mode and use the gdm start command to get it to work...what´s up?
2008-04-17T08:52:00.000Z	Ongaku		it´s a 32 bit version of 7.04 if that matters....on a dual core processor on a VIA board
2008-04-17T08:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	on a normal boot, can you go to ctrl+alt+f2 and log in there?
2008-04-17T08:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	even in ctr+altf2?
2008-04-17T08:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	how about in ctrl+alt+f8
2008-04-17T08:55:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	have you tried?
2008-04-17T08:56:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	are you on another machine right now?
2008-04-17T08:58:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	did you check the dmesg ?
2008-04-17T09:00:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	try "dmesg | less" in a terminal and scroll to the end and see if there are any suspicious warnings...
2008-04-17T09:02:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	sure
2008-04-17T09:05:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	install pastebinit: sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2008-04-17T09:06:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	then "dmesg | pastebinit"
2008-04-17T09:08:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	did you do "dmesg | pastebinit"? where's the url?
2008-04-17T09:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	is that what it gave you?
2008-04-17T09:10:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	hmm. try again. that doesn't seem right. do "dmesg | pastebinit" (with out the quotes) and paste the resulting url
2008-04-17T09:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	nvm. just do "dmesg > dmesg.txt && gedit dmesg.txt" copy and paste from there and pastebin the result.
2008-04-17T09:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	hopefully 8.04 will fix your problem...
2008-04-17T09:17:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Ongaku	ok i really don't know what's wrong. my suggestion would be to boot normally, then go to ctrl+alt+f2. there, you will find a text login. see if you can login there...
