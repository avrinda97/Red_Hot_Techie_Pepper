2008-03-12T01:54:00.000Z	Y-Town		ANyone have any input on what runs better on Kubuntu/Ubuntu of either VM Ware or Virtual Box?  I need to install one of them on a server
2008-03-12T01:54:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	VMWare is the better software, imo
2008-03-12T01:55:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	very much so
2008-03-12T01:56:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	would yopu say VM Ware is stable to run 24/7 for a critical business application?
2008-03-12T01:57:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	yes, i use it in a production environment daily
2008-03-12T01:57:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	thanks
2008-03-12T01:58:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	lots of people are moving to virtualization of servers now instead of physical machines
2008-03-12T01:58:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	so it's very much a dependable solution
2008-03-12T01:59:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	nice to hear.  I have a customer database management software I use for my business that is Microshaft dependant
2008-03-12T01:59:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	shouldn't be a problem.  For example, I have a centos machine running vmware with an ms server 2003 machine running
2008-03-12T02:00:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	on which nearly all of my client's mission critical stuff is running
2008-03-12T02:01:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	so...have no fear, you can trust it fully
2008-03-12T02:01:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	is it possible to do remote login to the system running within vm ware?
2008-03-12T02:01:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	yes...what I do is install Logmein on the ms machine
2008-03-12T02:02:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	Perfect... thats how I do it now  :o)
2008-03-12T02:02:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	yep...then just putty to the linux side if you need to
2008-03-12T02:03:00.000Z	Y-Town	kestir	thanks bud :o)
2008-03-12T02:03:00.000Z	kestir	Y-Town	No problem at all man
