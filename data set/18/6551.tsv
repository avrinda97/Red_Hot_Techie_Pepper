2008-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	Hub441		i'm getting "Loading of player part 'XinePart' failed" in kaffeine on a fresh mythbuntu installation. couldn't find a solution on the web so fwar.
2008-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	deleting .xine from your Home folder with Kaffeine closed has been known to work
2008-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	Hub441	babolat	in addition it says "all audio drivers failed to initialize"
2008-05-05T16:47:00.000Z	Hub441	babolat	and deleting .xine didn't do it
2008-05-05T16:49:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	check that the xine-lib and xine-extracodecs, as well as the win32codecs are installed
2008-05-05T16:56:00.000Z	Hub441	babolat	can't find libxine-extracodecs (got uni/mutliverse and medibuntu enabled)
2008-05-05T16:57:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	and you're looking at All Available Apps?
2008-05-05T16:58:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	try sudo apt-get install xine-extracodecs
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	Hub441	babolat	apt-cache doesn't find that package either.
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	its xine-extracodecs, not *libxine-extracodecs*
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	Hub441	babolat	just searched for xine and greped for codecs
2008-05-05T17:00:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	and gave u no xine-extracodecs?
2008-05-05T17:00:00.000Z	Hub441	babolat	nope
2008-05-05T17:02:00.000Z	babolat	Hub441	its been renamed to lib3b2-extracodecs
