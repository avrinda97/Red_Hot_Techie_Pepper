2007-11-26T15:02:00.000Z	mely	bazhang	okay, thanks, will read up.

2007-11-26T15:20:00.000Z	bazhang	mely	you did it all. cheers :}
2007-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	mely	bazhang	Do you know how to fix the screen resolution? The most I have is 1024x768.
2007-11-26T15:22:00.000Z	bazhang	mely	which card? nvidia, ati, intel other?
2007-11-26T15:22:00.000Z	mely	bazhang	Nvidia.
2007-11-26T15:23:00.000Z	bazhang	mely	which drivers are you using? the ones from repositories?
2007-11-26T15:24:00.000Z	mely	bazhang	No. I'm using the restricted drivers. (And why is your name in red?)
2007-11-26T15:25:00.000Z	bazhang	mely	to highlight so people can follow the responses more easily--have you tried setting the resolution via the gui?
2007-11-26T15:26:00.000Z	mely	bazhang	I've tried that: System > Preferences > Screen Resolution. The max is 1024x768 and there aren't any other options for me to select.
2007-11-26T15:28:00.000Z	bazhang	mely	I can give you another link--I am not so good with fixing resolution
2007-11-26T15:28:00.000Z	mely	bazhang	I'd appreciate that other link.
