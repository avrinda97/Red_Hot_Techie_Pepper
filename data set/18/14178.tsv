2006-12-12T09:05:00.000Z	Molly_156		I dont' know how.
2006-12-12T09:06:00.000Z	Molly_156		It says "user already exists.
2006-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	Molly_156		I'm in console only, I'm lost.
2006-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	Molly_156		I'm trying really hard, but I'm lost.
2006-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	Molly_156		I honestly don't know. I'm just trying to get my one account to have write permission for FTP.
2006-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	Molly_156		So, what would have happened that would have blocked me from my /var/www dir even in SSH?
2006-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	Molly_156		I am, now.
2006-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	Molly_156		Now I'm hosed as a local user as well.
2006-12-12T09:10:00.000Z	Molly_156		FTP will work the same way, whatever I'm set as for local, will be that for FTP.
2006-12-12T09:12:00.000Z	Molly_156		So I understand, am I creating a group called www-dev?
2006-12-12T09:13:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	It should be auto created to be the default group for the www-dev user
2006-12-12T09:03:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	chown www-dev:www-dev /var/www ; Then add your user to the www-dev group.
2006-12-12T09:05:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	Then add the user
2006-12-12T09:06:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	system -> administration -> users and groups
2006-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	Okay. useradd or adduser is the commands.
2006-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	Give me a sec.
2006-12-12T09:12:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	Should fix it
2006-12-12T09:14:00.000Z	kjaer	Molly_156	Do what I said, and add your user to the www-dev group.
