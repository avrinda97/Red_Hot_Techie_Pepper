2012-09-11T20:01:00.000Z	fre		so what should i do with the problem. It occurs right after Bios ends completing all the neccessary operations it performs and gives a wat for the OS loading process per se. That is when i should come across the choice of OSs. What i find is this error of  /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr.mbr which is not available and then after I press "enter" windows 8(which is currently the main system) is loading. What does it mean? Is it me that is so stupid or this
2012-09-11T20:01:00.000Z	fre		is just that i am unlucky?
2012-09-11T20:02:00.000Z	fre		so what
2012-09-11T20:02:00.000Z	fre		hi
2012-09-11T20:04:00.000Z	fre		I guess i will undo partitioning and delete the system. That's sad. Thanx for all you efforts
2012-09-11T20:05:00.000Z	kunji	fre	You could try using an actual dual boot after that, using GRUB2 as your bootloader.
2012-09-11T20:07:00.000Z	fre	kunji	you see i can only boot ubuntu through livecd
2012-09-11T20:08:00.000Z	kunji	fre	 So you installed it as a windows app (the Wubi installer?)
2012-09-11T20:10:00.000Z	kunji	fre	for dual booting you would pick that option during the Ubuntu installation (the advanced partitioning stuff) and create an ext4 (or 3) partition for Ubuntu, and  a partition for the swap (ext2)
2012-09-11T20:11:00.000Z	kunji	fre	If Windows currently takes the entire drive, then you may need to shrink that partition, which can take a while
2012-09-11T20:13:00.000Z	kunji	fre	oh, so you're not using the Wubi installer
2012-09-11T20:13:00.000Z	fre	kunji	no i am not
2012-09-11T20:13:00.000Z	kunji	fre	can you paste the page with the directions you were following?
2012-09-11T20:14:00.000Z	kunji	fre	Ah, well then, do you know how far the install got?  Did it seem to complete successfully, or did the installer crash at some point?
2012-09-11T20:16:00.000Z	kunji	fre	It's possible that you just didn't install GRUB2 (the bootloader) to the right place.  So it is still using the windows bootloader.  Yeah, sounds like it completed successfully.
2012-09-11T20:21:00.000Z	kunji	fre	Sorry, what was the original question?
2012-09-11T20:22:00.000Z	kunji	fre	oh, right, I think you should try reinstalling just GRUB2 to the drive, not just to the partition.
2012-09-11T20:24:00.000Z	kunji	fre	I would use this documentation to go about fixing Grub https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing   it's never failed me yet ^_^
