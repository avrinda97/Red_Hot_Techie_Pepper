2009-05-11T19:24:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		Does anyone know where I can find detailed information about the differences in the sysvinit system for service start/stop/restart between Fedora and Ubuntu?
2009-05-11T19:24:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		I had Xvfb running as a service in Fedora, jsut switched to Ubunut Jaunty and now I'm getting grief
2009-05-11T19:25:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	well what's not working?
2009-05-11T19:26:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	can we see your fedora init script?
2009-05-11T19:27:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	and does sudo /etc/init.d/xfvb start work? Or how about sudo service xfvb start?
2009-05-11T19:28:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	please keep it in the main channel :)
2009-05-11T19:31:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	ah yes that not the nice way of stopping and starting xvfb. Try do sudo service start xfvb
2009-05-11T19:32:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	err s/xfvb/xvfb
2009-05-11T19:32:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	sorry, is an init script for xvfb not provided?
2009-05-11T19:33:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	one sec
2009-05-11T19:33:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	sorry, I'm not really familiar with xvfb
2009-05-11T19:35:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	but doing Xvfb :100 -ac works fine?
2009-05-11T19:36:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	so then using your init script whatever start should work right?
2009-05-11T19:36:00.000Z	mythbuster1848	ziroday	yeah, it shoudl
2009-05-11T19:37:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	do it with sudo prepended then
2009-05-11T19:38:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	not unless you specify them to
2009-05-11T19:38:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	even if the script owner is root
2009-05-11T19:39:00.000Z	ziroday	mythbuster1848	you might want to add a bit to the top that checks if you are using sudo/are root and warns if you aren't
