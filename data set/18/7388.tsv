2008-01-15T02:02:00.000Z	Rubiks120		hi, I did an update last night on a new system and it broke my wireless because it was compiled against 2.6.15-26 and now the computer has 2.6.15-29 I dont have internet acess how can I install the proper linux-headers?
2008-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	You should still be able to get to grub menu and boot from the old kernal
2008-01-15T02:07:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	ok, I modified grub.lst by commenting the entries refering to 2.6.15-29 that should boot me back to the -26 kernel correct?
2008-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	You should just be able to hit escape on boot and get to the list that would let you select from any of the options
2008-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	But your way should get you there... since you already did it
2008-01-15T02:09:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	oo, that would have been easier, I come from gentoo but put this installation together for my sister thinking it would be easier, so I am used to just modifying files either way I have got the computer booted to the older kernel I wil install the headers and rebuild to module then reboot back thanks for pointing out the obvious
2008-01-15T02:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	Welcome to Ubuntu
2008-01-15T02:10:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	definately different then Gentoo, but much better suited for my sister, support is pretty good too
2008-01-15T02:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	We try
2008-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	thats always a good thing to hear, hopefully I wont be spending too much time back here looking for help though
2008-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	Let her know we are here for the easy questions so she doesnt have to bug you all the time
2008-01-15T02:13:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	Irc is a bit over her head but I will throw it out there as she learns to use the system a bit more
2008-01-15T02:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	I have several 70+ yr olds using irc...   I use konversation, auto join #Ubuntu and #Compiz and ator register their nicks
2008-01-15T02:15:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	ok when you put it that way, its just a matter of showing her something new not sure if she will accept it or not I think is more the issue
2008-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	Agreed...
2008-01-15T02:17:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	my family is still very much a windows family, I have converted to linux, and this is my first step in showing them its really not too bad, I just wish the wireless support was a bit better in linux in general it would help my cause alot
2008-01-15T02:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rubiks120	Pick up a couple of decently supported wireless card, disable the onboards..  FYI, I still set them up as dual boot... works like a charm.
2008-01-15T02:20:00.000Z	Rubiks120	Jack_Sparrow	dual boot would be a good route to take, if I could convince my mom that I wont kill all her financial records
