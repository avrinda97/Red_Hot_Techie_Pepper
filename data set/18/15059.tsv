2005-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	n00d		my connection freeze after a while... does anyone have a clue about it ?
2005-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	no
2005-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	maybe you can give some detail...
2005-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	well, i connect using ADSL and a 3COM homeconnect modem... and then authenticate through web page my login... i was updanting my system and then i couldnt navigate anymore
2005-05-11T09:48:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	several times... I use pppoeconf as said in howto
2005-05-11T09:48:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	when you cannot navigate, can you still ping or use dig?
2005-05-11T09:49:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	its funny because I can still download files using apt-get but i cant navigate or talk with gaim... i need to disconnect and reconnect
2005-05-11T09:50:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	that is odd indeed, do you have any pppoe logs?
2005-05-11T09:50:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	i think i might have but im using windows right now cos i couldnt connect to irc
2005-05-11T09:51:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	can be a dialer problem ? i configured it to start with boot
2005-05-11T09:52:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	i have no experience with pppoe, but reading logs is my specialty :)
2005-05-11T09:53:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	hehe... could you point me in the direction of the specific logs so I can boot my linux machine to recover them
2005-05-11T09:54:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	/var/log/ppp or something
2005-05-11T09:57:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	ok... im going to restart and then i come back :) thanks
2005-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	hi there... i didn't find any log files
2005-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	is there a configuration that can deactivate my connection after a time ?
2005-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	Seveas	n00d	not that i know of, but remember that i have little experience with pppoe
2005-05-11T10:06:00.000Z	n00d	Seveas	anyway... you helped me a lot
