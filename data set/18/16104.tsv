2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	jmerlin_		no they're not
2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	jmerlin_		LOL
2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	jmerlin_		if by nicely you mean like building a car engine with wood
2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	jmerlin_		sure.
2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	jmerlin_		dx isn't meant to be translated into opengl
2006-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	jmerlin_		opengl entrypoints and dx entrypoints in the video drivers are completely different
2006-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	jmerlin_		your card supports the features of d3d directly if at all
2006-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	jmerlin_		not using them is STUPID
2006-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	jmerlin_		even if they aren't standard.
2006-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	jmerlin_		you pay $500 for a very good card
2006-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	holycow	jmerlin_	if its so great why do you even bother using linux?
2006-10-09T10:41:00.000Z	holycow	jmerlin_	no i'm offended that you would even consider help a company like ms expand its stranglehold
2006-10-09T10:42:00.000Z	holycow	jmerlin_	the moment dx is supported on linux is when the vid card companies can go 'to hell with ogl'
2006-10-09T10:47:00.000Z	holycow	jmerlin_	of what benefit do you hope this project to be then?
2006-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	holycow	jmerlin_	so i'm gonna try to understand why you think this is a good idea
2006-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	holycow	jmerlin_	how again do you hope that this will be beneficial?
