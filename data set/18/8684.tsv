2007-07-13T16:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robsomebody	The flash animation overlaps badly but I am using beta flash player
2007-07-13T16:56:00.000Z	robsomebody	Jordan_U	yeah, flash is still being "possitioned" its supposed to overlap in some areas
2007-07-13T05:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robsomebody	I normally wouldn't trust a random link to an ip addy, but I am tired and un-paranoid at the moment
2007-07-13T05:01:00.000Z	robsomebody	Jordan_U	yeah, but still, they didnt even port scan to check me out or anything
2007-07-13T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robsomebody	I even sent that info to you :)
2007-07-13T05:01:00.000Z	robsomebody	Jordan_U	i only log arbitrary data, the ip is just to seperate stuff so i can do statistics later
