2007-01-09T10:28:00.000Z	nn531		hey is there a way to make the program tabs in the bottom panel not so big?
2007-01-09T10:29:00.000Z	owh	nn531	Change the overall width of the applet.
2007-01-09T10:30:00.000Z	nn531	owh	what? how do i do that?
2007-01-09T10:30:00.000Z	owh	nn531	Right click on it, select properties.
2007-01-09T10:31:00.000Z	nn531	owh	and then?
2007-01-09T10:31:00.000Z	nn531	owh	unclick expand?
2007-01-09T10:31:00.000Z	owh	nn531	That's the wrong place to right click :-)
2007-01-09T10:31:00.000Z	owh	nn531	On the place where the buttons appear.
2007-01-09T10:33:00.000Z	owh	nn531	Have a look around, it should become obvious :-)
2007-01-09T10:34:00.000Z	owh	nn531	Did you find it?
2007-01-09T10:34:00.000Z	nn531	owh	i must be retarded, I clicked on the bar and then it only had two tabs up and then in the one tab it had like 3 options
2007-01-09T10:35:00.000Z	owh	nn531	What is the title of the window?
2007-01-09T10:35:00.000Z	nn531	owh	panel properties
2007-01-09T10:36:00.000Z	owh	nn531	It should say "Window List Preferences"
2007-01-09T10:36:00.000Z	nn531	owh	no dice man, i click where the tab should be if it were open and I get panel properties
2007-01-09T10:36:00.000Z	owh	nn531	On the bottom left of the screen is the show desk top button, next to it is a little set of dots. Right click there.
2007-01-09T10:38:00.000Z	nn531	owh	aha, thank you
