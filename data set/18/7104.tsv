2008-02-05T23:18:00.000Z	ubuntu32		I need help with merging partitions. Im so confused
2008-02-05T23:18:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	be more specific
2008-02-05T23:19:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	you can burn a gparted LiveCD and do it from there
2008-02-05T23:19:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	oh, well then you're halfway there ;)
2008-02-05T23:20:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	the ubuntu liveCD comes with gparted, so either should be fine.
2008-02-05T23:20:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	ok, load up gparted
2008-02-05T23:20:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	k, are the ext3 partition and then unallocated space next to each other?
2008-02-05T23:21:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	ugh, then you have to move them around so they are, as far as I know
2008-02-05T23:21:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	gparted will allow you to move partitions
2008-02-05T23:21:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	basically, move them so that they are next to each other, and then gparted will allow you to resize the ext3 partition to use up the unallocated space
2008-02-05T23:22:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	you backed up all your important data first, right?  always have a backup
2008-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	ubuntu32	nemilar	I cant move my root and the unallocated has no option to move :S
2008-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	can you move whatever is between them?
2008-02-05T23:25:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	you can, if you want, remove the swap; create a new swap at the end of the drive, and then extend your ext3 partition
2008-02-05T23:25:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	not sure if the liveCD will rewrite your configuration files so that everything works properly, though
2008-02-05T23:27:00.000Z	nemilar	ubuntu32	well now there is just the ext3 and a bunch of unallocated space next to it, no?
2008-02-05T23:32:00.000Z	ubuntu32	nemilar	I got it down to one last space
2008-02-05T23:36:00.000Z	ubuntu32	nemilar	What do i do now?
