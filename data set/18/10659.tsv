2006-11-09T07:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	Are you using OSS, or ALSA?
2006-11-09T07:25:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	whatever is the default with ubuntu
2006-11-09T07:26:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	which is better and which will fix the above problem?
2006-11-09T07:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	Alsa is better, and that is what Ubuntu uses by default.
2006-11-09T07:27:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	ok then i'm using alsa; do you have any idea why it does this?
2006-11-09T07:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	Some programs still use OSS though, including flash 7
2006-11-09T07:29:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	so I can't get around it with flash 7? does flash 9 fix that?
2006-11-09T07:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	Yes, flash 9 fixes that problem, and with other programs you can work around it using aoss...
2006-11-09T07:30:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	sweet thanks for your help
2006-11-09T07:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	sudo apt-get install alsa-oss then run the application, but with aoss in front of it like: aoss firefox
2006-11-09T07:32:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	awesome man thanks for your help
2006-11-09T07:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	np
2007-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	so you don't have to back up all your music etc when you reinstall
2007-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	Why not just keep it in your separate /home though?
2007-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	i guess there isn't a reason not to. I don't have a separate home partition though so i DO have a separate data partition
2007-06-16T09:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	strabes	god I hope not...
2007-06-16T09:27:00.000Z	strabes	Jordan_U	lol, bonzibuddy was the best app ever
