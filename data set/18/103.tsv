2012-09-09T23:39:00.000Z	d00durk00l		what can I use to send a large file to my friend?
2012-09-09T23:39:00.000Z	d00durk00l		any suggestions
2012-09-09T23:39:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	how big?
2012-09-09T23:45:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	true
2012-09-09T23:57:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	if the file is sensitive, you can just encrypt it before sending it on a SD-card. Just use a TrueCrypt volume and you're set.
2012-09-09T23:57:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Meris	No there is no addy to send it too ;)
2012-09-09T23:58:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	I see, well, in that case, go with sftp/ scp
2012-09-10T00:03:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	how much downstream bandwidth do you have?
2012-09-10T00:03:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Meris	2.73
2012-09-10T00:04:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	in MBit/s, or Mbyte/s?
2012-09-10T00:04:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	so how big is this file anyway?
2012-09-10T00:12:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	nice, (heh, you did *encrypt* the line first, didn't you ? <= just kidding ;-) )
2012-09-10T00:13:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Meris	?
2012-09-10T00:13:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	I mean the phone line of course ;-) nvm
2012-09-10T00:14:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Meris	Oh I could give a crap the stuff I am sending isn't senstive .. He just doesn't want to anounce his addy on his phone
2012-09-10T00:15:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	you  could use VoIP over an encrypted channel if "your contact" ;-) is that paranoid.
2012-09-10T00:16:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Meris	THank you sir
2012-09-10T00:21:00.000Z	Meris	d00durk00l	np
