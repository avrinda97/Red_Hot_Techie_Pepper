2010-10-11T01:51:00.000Z	tripelb		OK no one answers: let me put this another way. as soon as I start chrome the usage on the sustem monitor goes 100%. I closed chrome and ran top and there's no chrome things running. HELP!
2010-10-11T01:52:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	use htop to see what is hogging your cpu (on CLI...)
2010-10-11T01:52:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	ok. (I did top on cli.)
2010-10-11T01:53:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	I read, but htop is a little easier to read (and still CLI)
2010-10-11T01:53:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	installing htop mow.
2010-10-11T02:03:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	this is one of two htops http://imagebin.ca/view/ONEqHQ.html
2010-10-11T02:05:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	I guess its the fine flashplayer, what happens when you kill chrome from there?
2010-10-11T02:06:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	this is two of two http://imagebin.ca/view/P9nJ_fI.html  --- what do you mean fine flashplayer. what means kill chrome from "there". what is there?
2010-10-11T02:07:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	I'm sorry I dont understand. I'm not being difficult just dont want to go playing. Chrome often has shockwave crash.
2010-10-11T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	one of the niceties of htop is that you can interactively kill processes, so if you move the "cursor" to the line with "chrome" and press F9 you can kill the process
2010-10-11T02:23:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	ok I'll put that in a save file
2011-10-30T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	why don't you tell your chat client to keep what is happening in a channel?
2011-10-30T01:18:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	I have 5000 lines of backscroll. I am suddenly (broken Dell) using a mac. It's difficult. And it might just say "good night, sweet dreams".
2011-10-30T01:19:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	the person who answered your most likely used your nick, so just search for in in your backscroll
2011-10-30T01:19:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	OTOH if you could help me with my problem - reading an outboard USB ext4 partition - when I boot on a liveCD that is. Mac cant read it -> that I know of. Disk Utility tells me the partition is there.
2011-10-30T01:21:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	I didnt remember how to separate days, so I probably have one Gigantic File. And xchat-aqua will only search from the beginning of the backscroll in find. Basically, that's water under the bridge. AND of course they used my nick otherwise I wouldnt know anyone addressed me and we wouldnt be having this discussion. The tab turned blue.
2011-10-30T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	tripelb	at the moment I cannot see what you want/need - or what your problem is, so I cannot even say if I might be able to help
2011-10-30T01:22:00.000Z	tripelb	guntbert	NP. Have a great day!!
