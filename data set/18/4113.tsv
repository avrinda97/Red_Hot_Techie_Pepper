2009-06-04T00:20:00.000Z	webmaren		my gnome environment just stopped working for no apparent reason
2009-06-04T00:21:00.000Z	webmaren		i can still run in CLI but gnome just loads my background and then gives up
2009-06-04T00:23:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	what happens when you load a failsafe gnome?
2009-06-04T00:24:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	didn't think about that, one second
2009-06-04T00:26:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	failsafe just kicked my back to my login manager
2009-06-04T00:26:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	how about the Terminal option in the sessions menu?
2009-06-04T00:27:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	I use kdm as my login manager, there is no terminal option
2009-06-04T00:27:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	i'm using virtual consoles to access irc right now though
2009-06-04T00:28:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	there is no failsafe terminal?
2009-06-04T00:28:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	there is a failsafe option, which didn't work, no terminal option
2009-06-04T00:28:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	ok first kill kdm (/etc/init.d/kdm stop)
2009-06-04T00:28:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	with sudo
2009-06-04T00:29:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	oh i actually found a terminal option in another menu
2009-06-04T00:29:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	even better
2009-06-04T00:29:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	and I have already restarted both kdm and gdm from terminal multiple times
2009-06-04T00:30:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	can you use the terminal option?
2009-06-04T00:30:00.000Z	webmaren	cabrey	all it did was send me over to the virtual consoles I'm already using
2009-06-04T00:31:00.000Z	cabrey	webmaren	oh well, and I don't want you to restart kdm, stop it
