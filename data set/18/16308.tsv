2004-10-22T16:02:00.000Z	Mithrandir		we shouldn't have any really nasty bugs in warty, though, as they should have been found and weeded out before release.
2004-10-22T16:03:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	I have lousy disk performance too, this is what lsmod says: 
2004-10-22T16:03:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	ide_core              125272  4 ide_cd,ide_generic,via82cxxx,ide_disk
2004-10-22T16:03:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	can u help?
2004-10-22T16:03:00.000Z	Mithrandir	micX	are you using SATA?
2004-10-22T16:03:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	PATA
2004-10-22T16:04:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	Timing buffered disk reads:   36 MB in 10.25 seconds =   3.51 MB/sec
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	Mithrandir	micX	you can try putting via82cxxx in /etc/modules and see if it helps.
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	Mithrandir	micX	if that works, we have a bug we should track down.
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	# lsmod|grep via82cxxx
2004-10-22T16:09:00.000Z	Mithrandir	micX	load order is important.
2004-10-22T16:09:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	so if it's in /etc/modules it will load earlier?
2004-10-22T16:09:00.000Z	Mithrandir	micX	yes; try and report back. :)
2004-10-22T16:10:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	ok, I've edited it into /etc/modules. bbiab
2004-10-22T16:18:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	it seems a bit better, but:
2004-10-22T16:18:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	 Timing buffered disk reads:    2 MB in  4.63 seconds = 442.30 kB/sec
2004-10-22T16:20:00.000Z	micX	Mithrandir	ok, here goes...
2004-10-22T16:22:00.000Z	Mithrandir	micX	that's _really_ weird.
