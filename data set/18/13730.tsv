2005-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	ZeZu	which ATI card do you own?
2005-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	ZeZu		9800 pro

2005-10-16T12:54:00.000Z	ZeZu		something about that didn't make sense
2005-10-16T12:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	ZeZu	I've got a 9600XT, and it runs fine; the fglrx drivers should work for the 9800 as well
