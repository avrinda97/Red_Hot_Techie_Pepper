2010-04-30T17:29:00.000Z	mrsun		in 9.10 aprently you have a "preferences->hardware" thingie you can change it in
2010-04-30T17:29:00.000Z	mrsun		but aparently not in lucid for some reason ?
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	mrsun		and aparently i cant get any help here either :(
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	mrsun		sigh
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	mrsun		and i dont get it, why is there a "hardware" configuration tool in 9.10 but not in 10.04?
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	mrsun		where has it gone ?
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	mrsun		aparently its very simple using that but without it its hell on earth like everything else with linux
2010-04-30T17:33:00.000Z	mrsun		cant make more "specs" about that then that
2010-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	mrsun		If Ubuntu fails to detect any hardware (do be patient as this isnâ€™t always instant) then you can manually run the hardware configuration tool yourself from the System > Preferences menu.
2010-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	mrsun		system->preferences
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	mrsun	do you mean system > admin ? hardware driver?
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	mrsun	wildbat_10_40	no, aparently this was to configure hardware with
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	mrsun		so i could set my sound card to 6 channel insted of 2
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	mrsun	cos i don't see the hardware thing you said in 9.10
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	mrsun	wildbat_10_40	where the hell has people gotten that from then :/
2010-04-30T17:36:00.000Z	mrsun		and why isnt there a simple way somewhere to configure the channels on the audio when everything else is set up for you in ubuntu? :/
2010-04-30T17:36:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	mrsun	may be you installed some package be4?
2010-04-30T17:36:00.000Z	mrsun	wildbat_10_40	not me, some other guy and lost the link :/
