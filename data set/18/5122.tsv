2009-02-02T22:25:00.000Z	Photoguy		Does anybody else have any idea what to do when it hangs up on the login screen?
2009-02-02T22:26:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	You should try booting with acpi=off
2009-02-02T22:26:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	 how?
2009-02-02T22:27:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	When the boot menu comes up press "e" then go down to the kernel and press "e", then add "acpi=off" at the end of the long line where it has quiet and splash at
2009-02-02T22:27:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	i'll try that
2009-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	I tried acpi=off, but no success, still stuck at login window
2009-02-02T22:38:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	okay, try it again with "acpi=off", "noapic", and "nolapic"
2009-02-02T22:38:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	all three at once?
2009-02-02T22:39:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	Yeah, that's what I had to do when I first installed it on my Acer Aspire laptop.  I've since gotten it down to where I am only using "acpi=off"
2009-02-02T22:47:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	I tried that..
2009-02-02T22:47:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	Does it make any diffrence that I just changed the login screen theme?
2009-02-02T22:56:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	No luck with those:   Note: I did just change the login screen theme, so maybe that's the issue, any ideas for getting past the login screen?
2009-02-02T22:57:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	You can go to recovery mode and login to root on the command line and undo it
2009-02-02T22:57:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	 any kind of guide availble?
2009-02-02T22:58:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	I've never dealt with that and i'm pretty new, but the forums would be a good place to start
2009-02-02T22:59:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	 that's the problem, I've been searching. :P
2009-02-02T23:00:00.000Z	nkei0	Photoguy	Sorry, I haven't messed with it really.  I've only been using linux for about 3 months and it's been generally problem free
2009-02-02T23:00:00.000Z	Photoguy	nkei0	thanks for your help.
