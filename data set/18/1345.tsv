2011-08-03T22:27:00.000Z	Drknzz		Hi guys! I am having issues with a ralink wireless card in a laptop, anyone has experience with this chipsets?
2011-08-03T22:27:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	what model ?
2011-08-03T22:28:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Network controller: Ralink corp. Device 539f ---> Dumped by lspci
2011-08-03T22:35:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	go to the ralink website go to software linux and d/l the 539x source file
2011-08-03T22:36:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	extract the folder cd into it sudo make , sudo make install . then you'll have to black list the current driver being used in  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf . reboot and done
2011-08-03T22:38:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	also keep the folder around because you'll probably have to use it anytime you update/new kernel
2011-08-03T22:44:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Sorry, was googling on my own a bit and didnt see your instructions
2011-08-03T22:44:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Downloading the driver from there as of now
2011-08-03T22:45:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	http://ubuntulinux.co.in/blog/ubuntu/wifi-card-ralink-5390-configuration-in-ubuntu-10-10-64-bit/ theres a guide here too, if what i said didn't make much sense
2011-08-03T22:53:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Rebooting now, thanks
2011-08-03T23:08:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Hi man! Your link made the card work like a charm, i am not using the old Linksys usb WiFi card anymore
2011-08-03T23:09:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Thanks... just another question, how can i get the exact model of this laptop? It has no model info anywhere, i only know its an HP Pavilion dm1 and i am having screen-bright issues
2011-08-03T23:12:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	one sec running back and forth between the bbq .
2011-08-03T23:13:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	glad it worked for you though!
2011-08-03T23:14:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Dont worry, its just the ATi driver doing its job, i think everythings fine now. Thanks :)
2011-08-03T23:15:00.000Z	G00053	Drknzz	cool, lspci goes a long way for the future. chances are the model of your lappy really doesn't matter all that much
2011-08-03T23:15:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Ok, thanks, im off to configure everything for the final (new to linux) ubuntu user
2011-08-03T23:15:00.000Z	Drknzz	G00053	Good luck with anything you are doing XD
