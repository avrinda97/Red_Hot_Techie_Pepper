2012-04-22T20:25:00.000Z	XiRoN		Anyone know how to make a perminant RAMDisk in ubuntu?
2012-04-22T20:26:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	add the mount commands to your rc.local
2012-06-05T03:25:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	you can specify payload size with ping
2012-06-05T03:26:00.000Z	XiRoN	escott	I want to attempt to inject 100Mbits of data into my host
2012-06-05T03:26:00.000Z	XiRoN	escott	Will ping really do anythin?
2012-06-05T03:27:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	i thought you were trying to determine MTU. no ping will not work for what you are proposing
2012-06-05T03:28:00.000Z	XiRoN	escott	 I want to see how much incoming data my server can handle before it becomes unresponsive.
2012-06-05T03:28:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	ok. what protocol is the service you are testing?
2012-06-05T03:29:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	you could use something like curl
2012-06-05T03:29:00.000Z	XiRoN	escott	Really? :O

2012-07-01T20:07:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	if the ram is dedicated (ie to the video card) then its untouchable
2012-07-01T20:08:00.000Z	XiRoN	escott	Sorry what I meant was, If the ubuntu system needs ram does it take priority over taking swap space or physical RAM?
2012-07-01T20:10:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	still not sure what the question means. if there is memory pressure stuff in the LRU will be written out to swap
2012-07-01T20:19:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	no that would be impossible
2012-07-01T20:20:00.000Z	XiRoN	escott	Would, or wouldn't?
2012-07-01T20:20:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	totally impossible
2012-07-03T01:08:00.000Z	escott	XiRoN	-o
