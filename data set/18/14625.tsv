2007-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	bimberi	eyecue	yes. that's how I'd read that
2007-03-20T06:57:00.000Z	bimberi	eyecue	try 'sudo apt-get -f install'
2007-03-20T06:58:00.000Z	bimberi	eyecue	do you have a root group? 'grep root /etc/group'
2007-03-20T06:58:00.000Z	bimberi	eyecue	yes
2007-03-20T06:59:00.000Z	bimberi	eyecue	first line in my /etc/group is "root:x:0:"
2007-03-20T07:02:00.000Z	bimberi	eyecue	ctrl-c should cancel it.  Have you suspended output?  If so a ctrl-q will resume
