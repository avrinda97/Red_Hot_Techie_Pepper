2012-01-17T21:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		When I switch on my computer grub won't load the first kernel in the list. The kernel was upgraded sometime ago but I think the upgrade failed. As its grub 2 I cant edit the kernel list but the bigger problem is now I cant install any packages. I'm using ubuntu 8.04.4
2012-01-17T21:45:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	desktop or server?
2012-01-17T21:45:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	desktop
2012-01-17T21:45:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	only server is now supported
2012-01-17T21:46:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	This is a problem for me as my hardware wont run any more up to date release
2012-01-17T21:47:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	that doesn't automatically means desktop is now supported
2012-01-17T21:47:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	why won't your hardware run a more recent release?
2012-01-17T21:48:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	Last I heard there is no graphics driver for my graphics card on any newer release.
2012-01-17T21:48:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	what graphics you have?
2012-01-17T21:49:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	Its a twin display matrox card of some description. Cant remember which one.
2012-01-17T21:50:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	Its a Matrox G200
2012-01-17T21:54:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	matrox themselves don't seem to be supporting the driver anymore (last release in 2006)
2012-01-17T21:55:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	That's right. I got my card working using a driver from http://forum.tuxx-home.at/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=748&sid=0d433f4ca445cc74d20d384e0b68724a
2012-01-17T21:58:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	i'm not sure what to suggest sorry
2012-01-17T21:59:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	You would have no idea how to fix the problem with the package manager in ubuntu 8.04?
2012-01-17T22:00:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	well the desktop support has ended for 8.04 so the repos are likely no longer functioning
2012-01-17T22:01:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	auronandace	Oh I didnt realise the repos would have gone. That explains it
2012-01-17T22:04:00.000Z	auronandace	JonathanEllis	that factoid was removed quite a while ago
