2011-05-19T16:26:00.000Z	naquad		i've downloaded ubuntu 11.04 32bit distro from ubuntu.com, created a partition on my usb drive (type fat32) and dd'ed image there. when i'm trying to boot system stalls, all i see is black screen. any ideas what am i doing wrong?
2011-05-19T16:27:00.000Z	naquad		and i can't get it
2011-05-19T16:27:00.000Z	naquad		i don't have ubuntu on my main box
2011-05-19T16:28:00.000Z	naquad		thichlinux, dd if=... of=/dev/sdc1 it won't
2011-05-19T16:28:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	dd if=... of=/dev/sdc is the right way.
2011-05-19T16:28:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	It will not boot otheriwse.
2011-05-19T16:28:00.000Z	naquad	theadmin	this way it doesn't boot at all
2011-05-19T16:29:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	However, I'm not sure Ubuntu's images are dd-compatible. Read the instructions on ubuntu.com for creating a USB stick
2011-05-19T16:30:00.000Z	naquad	theadmin	it contains instructions only for win/mac/ubuntu, no instructions for non-ubuntu distros
2011-05-19T16:31:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	You should just use unetbootin. It's not ubuntu-only. Works on any Windows/Linux+GTK
2011-05-19T16:33:00.000Z	naquad	theadmin	arch linux doesn't have that thing in repos
2011-05-19T16:33:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	You're an arch user too?
2011-05-19T16:33:00.000Z	naquad	theadmin	yup. found unetbootin in aur
2011-05-19T16:33:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	Yeah, it is in AUR
2011-05-19T16:34:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	http://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en
2011-05-19T16:34:00.000Z	theadmin	naquad	And fsck other Pacman/AUR frontends :D
2011-05-19T16:35:00.000Z	naquad	theadmin	i've tried yaourt, didn't like it and got used to packer
