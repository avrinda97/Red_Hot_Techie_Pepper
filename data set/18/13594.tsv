2007-10-24T06:41:00.000Z	kenro		Where do I go for a good DC hublist?
2007-10-24T06:42:00.000Z	kenro		Ljt Who said anything about piracy?
2007-10-24T06:42:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	you, asking for DC hubs.
2007-10-24T06:44:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	how is that relevant to the topic of this channel?
2008-03-06T05:47:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	no, year, month
2008-03-06T05:48:00.000Z	kenro	LjL	 So having started in 2001, it only worked out that way...
2008-03-31T02:03:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	hmm?
2008-03-31T02:03:00.000Z	kenro	LjL	Are you saying you know nothing about b43xx firmware cutter?
2008-03-31T02:04:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	actually, no, i haven't said that. but it's true, i know nothing about it.
2008-03-31T02:05:00.000Z	kenro	LjL	 Then stay out of it.
2008-03-31T02:09:00.000Z	kenro	LjL	You're out of line. I'm sick and tired of having to worry over this, but can't afford a different lappy. Why doesn't Broadcom or Ubuntu fix it?
2008-03-31T02:09:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	you're out of line - and, i haven't the slightest idea.
2008-03-31T02:10:00.000Z	kenro	LjL	 You know we're never gonna accept the other's perspective...
2008-03-31T02:11:00.000Z	LjL	kenro	my perspective is that the attitude you've been showing is not acceptable. i don't know about your broadcom-related problem, sorry about that.
2008-03-31T02:13:00.000Z	kenro	LjL	 I need a new motherboard.
