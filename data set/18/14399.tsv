2006-01-02T12:35:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	if you have a mac question, ask it
2006-01-02T12:36:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	ok thanks:)
2006-01-02T12:36:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	what is the mac fs?
2006-01-02T12:37:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	HFS?
2006-01-02T12:39:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	is HFS the current mac file system?
2006-01-02T12:39:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	hfs+(something) (the 10.4 brings something 'extra' to hfs+)
2006-01-02T12:40:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	can you write to it?
2006-01-02T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	you can mount your drives temporarily by using 'hfs+'
2006-01-02T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	yes you can write to it, but i would only do it temporarily
2006-01-02T12:41:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	can you make a hfs file system?
2006-01-02T12:41:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	if you have hfstools installed
2006-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	and my main question was about spotlight
2006-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	what about it?
2006-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	is that an upcoming replacement to HFS?
2006-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	ubunoo	nalioth	that has not be releasted yet
2006-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	ubunoo	spotlight is completely different from a filesystem. join me in #kubuntu-offtopic please as we are.
