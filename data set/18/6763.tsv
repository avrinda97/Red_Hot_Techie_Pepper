2010-05-04T15:16:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	i installed it on i5 , works ok here, not sure about i7
2010-05-04T15:18:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	no worries here, did you run md5sum on iso?
2010-05-04T15:19:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	 ok should be ok then
2010-05-04T15:29:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	it run ok in live mode?
2010-05-04T15:29:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	how much ram you have?
2010-05-04T15:30:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	4gb is pretty good, got a pen drive?
2010-05-04T15:34:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	i would also check oher options , not sure if it is i7 issue though
2010-05-04T15:34:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	like system is not heating u, maybe try cleaning cd drive and all that
2010-05-04T15:43:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	i highly doubt it ,
2010-05-04T15:43:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	question for you, does it hang at exact same place?
2010-05-04T15:45:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	i dont get it
2010-05-04T15:46:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	honestly, i would clean the cdrom, start the process, when it start, go make me some coffee and watch tv, come back after 20 minutes :d
2010-05-04T15:47:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	or use a pen drive to install ubuntu
2010-05-04T15:51:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	can you borrow pen drive from friend?
2010-05-04T15:56:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	 connect the pen drive, boot from the live cd, it has option of making a bootable usb for ubuntu under >> system>>administration, use that
2010-05-04T16:00:00.000Z	geekphreak	brijith	 i dont work with raid that much, i will let the big boys handle that question :)
