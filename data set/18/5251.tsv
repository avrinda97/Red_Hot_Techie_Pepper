2009-11-09T10:56:00.000Z	sleepy_cat		hi i got Vbox 2.0 when i try to update i get a message "Conflicts with Installed package Vbox-2.1" how should i resolve this conflict
2009-11-09T10:56:00.000Z	sleepy_cat		i dont want to lost out on winxp which i am running in vbox
2009-11-09T10:57:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	where'd you get that?
2009-11-09T10:58:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	scunizi	I have VBox2.1 now i got an update message so i downloaded Vbox3.0 and when i try to run that .deb package I get a conflicting error.. i would delete my vbox but then i may lose out on my prior OSes i am running on my Vbox
2009-11-09T10:59:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	is the version your currently running direct from vbox or from the repos?
2009-11-09T11:01:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	go to their latest which I think is 3.5..  if you feel hesitant copy the current vm's to a different directory as a backup.. but I've never had an issue upgrading vbox.. it doesn't touch your vm's.. just the main program
2009-11-09T11:01:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	scunizi	 I am running Ubuntu 8.04LTS and it does not have Vbox.. in its repos.. (ie. synaptic package manager)
2009-11-09T11:02:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	3.0.1 vs <whatever> is what I'm running on my 8.04 install.. I upgrade with each release.. no issues.
2009-11-09T11:03:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	scunizi	its vbox 3.0.10 I go to help->check for updates
2009-11-09T11:04:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	it complains that the other is installed.. it will remove it and install the latest
2009-11-09T11:04:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	won't touch your vm's though.
2009-11-09T11:24:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	scunizi	I downloaded the .deb package.. now when i open it it gets oped says conflicts but does not give me an Install option.. its greyed out
2009-11-09T11:27:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	that's really strange.. is the older vbox open or the vm running?
2009-11-09T11:28:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	sure .. uninstall that one..
2009-11-09T11:29:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	no.. just the program itself.. not your vms
2009-11-09T11:45:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	scunizi	i deleted the old on .. took backup.. now i am installing the package.. should i keep the old kernal files back
2009-11-09T11:47:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	scunizi	hey cool it worked :)
2009-11-09T11:48:00.000Z	scunizi	sleepy_cat	:) have fun!
