2008-09-16T01:40:00.000Z	draginxx		HELP ~ I've put a civ2 CD in my laptop and now I can't eject the disc tray on my laptop :(
2008-09-16T01:40:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	umount the CD first, then press eject
2008-09-16T01:41:00.000Z	draginxx	jorrit	tried it, it gives me an error message saying theirs no media
2008-09-16T01:42:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	Can you see the CD in a file manager?
2008-09-16T01:42:00.000Z	draginxx	jorrit	when I go to Places > COmputer it shows a DVDRW Drive
2008-09-16T01:44:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	first close all file dialogs and terminals that are using the drive, secondly, right click on the DVDRom drive and click unmount
2008-09-16T01:45:00.000Z	draginxx	jorrit	tried, it only allows me to "Mount VOlume" and "Eject"
2008-09-16T01:46:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	When you click "eject", does it eject?
2008-09-16T01:46:00.000Z	draginxx	jorrit	it says "There's probably no media in the drive"
2008-09-16T01:46:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	try eject -r on the command-line
2008-09-16T01:47:00.000Z	draginxx	jorrit	just typed it in..it's "hanging"

2008-09-16T01:48:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	You can kill an unresponsive program with ^c
2008-09-16T01:52:00.000Z	jorrit	draginxx	Yes, Ctrl-c, or mostly written as ^c terminates the process you are currently running in your terminal.
2008-09-16T01:53:00.000Z	draginxx	jorrit	didn't do anything =/ either way it didnt fix the problem, I tried kiling all wine processes too
