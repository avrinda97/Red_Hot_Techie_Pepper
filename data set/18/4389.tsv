2009-07-16T17:59:00.000Z	fabzor3	orly_owl	use samba
2009-07-16T18:00:00.000Z	fabzor3		oh users... edit permissions of the folder i guess
2009-07-16T18:00:00.000Z	orly_owl	fabzor3	for sharing a folder in ~ to other users on the *same* PC?
2009-07-16T18:00:00.000Z	fabzor3	orly_owl	ahh the point of the ~ is that its a user folder...
2009-07-16T18:01:00.000Z	orly_owl	fabzor3	i know, so where would a shared folder be located?
2009-07-16T18:01:00.000Z	fabzor3	orly_owl	why not make a new folder in say /usr/pub/
2009-07-16T18:01:00.000Z	fabzor3		and make /usr/pub the shared one
2009-07-16T18:01:00.000Z	fabzor3		go to terminal and gksu nautilus
2009-07-16T18:02:00.000Z	fabzor3		and with the newly opened window you can hack your folders to pieces
2009-07-16T18:02:00.000Z	orly_owl	fabzor3	will that let all users access /usr/pub?
2009-07-16T18:03:00.000Z	orly_owl		i also need to make another shared dir that only 2 users can access.
2009-07-16T18:03:00.000Z	fabzor3		no it will just give you the necerry permissions to make the folder
2009-07-16T18:03:00.000Z	fabzor3		once you make it as root then you need to right click on it and edit its permissions
2009-07-16T18:03:00.000Z	fabzor3		go properties>permissions
2009-07-16T18:04:00.000Z	fabzor3		and it should say owner and group
2009-07-16T18:04:00.000Z	fabzor3		owner can stay as root but you need to change the group to whatever group both the users are
2009-07-16T18:04:00.000Z	fabzor3	orly_owl	you see what i mean?
