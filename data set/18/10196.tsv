2007-02-17T17:06:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	mount them as who ? root ?
2007-02-17T17:07:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	the first time you create a new partition, you need to sudo chmod 777 /mount/point, or only root will have access
2007-02-17T17:08:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	adaptr	i just tried that, it didn't work
2007-02-17T17:08:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	well, I've never used truecrypt, so I really couldn't say
2007-02-17T17:08:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	is there data on it already ?
2007-02-17T17:09:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	do an ls -la /mount/point when its mounted.. you need to investigate, sir
2007-02-17T17:13:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	adaptr	i did  ls -la, what do i need to see?
2007-02-17T17:13:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	permissions and ownership
2007-02-17T17:13:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	just paste it...
2007-02-17T17:16:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	adaptr	matt@matt-desktop:~$  ls -la /home/matt/Data/1
2007-02-17T17:18:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	adaptr	did you get what i pasted?
2007-02-17T17:19:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	what does cat report.txt say ?
2007-02-17T17:19:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	...or head, or tail, even.... catting 28MB would be.. silly
2007-02-17T17:25:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	it would make sense - in more ways than one - to disallow changing the ownership and/or permissions of an encrypted drive after it has been created, save through the interface specifically defined for truecrypt
2007-02-17T17:26:00.000Z	adaptr	linuxnewbie756	as I said before, never used it, no idea, sorry
2007-02-17T17:27:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	adaptr	there is one for windows, a gui that is, so wouldn't it make sense that there would be for linux?
