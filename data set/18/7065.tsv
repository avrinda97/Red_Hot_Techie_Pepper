2008-10-26T14:03:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	do NOT use firestarte
2008-10-26T14:03:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	you only need a firewall if you need to ristrict the network behind you
2008-10-26T14:04:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	how can they hack you if you don't open ports on apps...?
2008-10-26T14:05:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	put ssh on a different port
2008-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	linux firewalls only make sense for network administrators to make a network firewall to block things like games etc from windows boxes
2008-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	so absolutely no need in a lan gaming party!!
2008-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	what_if	graingert	how about at a lan party where more than one person in studying or has a CEH certification, lol
2008-10-26T14:08:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	trust us, you really don't need one
2008-10-26T14:09:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	what servers do you have listening on what ports?
2008-10-26T14:11:00.000Z	what_if	graingert	you want the whole list? all on default ports: mysqld sshd ipp
2008-10-26T14:12:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	the most they can do is try to break your ssh password; print to your printers and try and crack your mysql password
2008-10-26T14:12:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	with ssh, use public key authentication rather than passwords; and make sure your mysql and ipp password is secure; you really have no need for a firewall
2008-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	allso put ssh on an alternate port or just switch off all of your deamons
2008-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	(that you don't need)
2008-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	graingert	what_if	check out (google: securing ssh)
2008-10-26T14:14:00.000Z	what_if	graingert	will do. tyvm :)
