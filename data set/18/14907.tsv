2005-05-28T08:09:00.000Z	Mosi		Hyapadi: Assuming you can do this from another drive, "dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/targetdrive" should work fine, do it several times if you're especially concerned about forensics
2005-05-28T08:11:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	dban does it as often as you want and any way you want ;)
2005-05-28T08:12:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	nice :) but you don't have to download dd most of the time, and it's 20 second's work to write a shell script that will do it as many times as you want
2005-05-28T08:13:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	true:)
2005-05-28T08:14:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	I'm just doing it the lazy, not particularly concerned about confidential medical records way.
2005-05-28T08:14:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	lol, well downloading the floppy version and putting it in and boot seems pretty lazy to me too ;)
2005-05-28T08:15:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	lol :P there's a complicated reason for that that turned out to not work anyways, so it was more an exercise in futility
2005-05-28T08:16:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	think we should have told him the different efficiency of the diff. delete-algorithms on the diff. harddrives?
2005-05-28T08:17:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	You should tell me about that first if you want me to help you educate him :) I'm not a guru, that was jsut soemthing i happened to know
2005-05-28T08:18:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	well you know the Gutmann Method, right? 35 parses, great algo. but not so useful on harddisks manufactured after 2000 (i think that was the year)
2005-05-28T08:19:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	I'm really not a hardware guy. Lots of gigs is good, that's about how much i know about hard drive mechanics.
2005-05-28T08:19:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	on hdds after 2000 random patterns are more efficient ..for example mersenne prng
2005-05-28T08:19:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	Didn't know that, that's cool
2005-05-28T08:26:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	here's a link that might interest you regarding lots of gigs :) http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html
2005-05-28T08:30:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	did you check out that link ?
2005-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	i will do so now, i was distracted by something
2005-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	Mosi	othernoob	no flash plugin, i'm running on Live CD
2005-05-28T08:35:00.000Z	othernoob	Mosi	:/ that sucks, save the link, you'll like it, i'm sure :)
