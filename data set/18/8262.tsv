2007-09-15T10:01:00.000Z	steve_j		hi all - is there a quick command to check how much space my distro is taking? am using ubutnu server, so console only
2007-09-15T10:03:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	du / --summarize --exclude /home/* should do that
2007-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	thanks v much. don't suppose you can recommend a good xwindow package so i can manage bits of my server visually?
2007-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	locally?
2007-09-15T10:07:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	yeah
2007-09-15T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg  fluxbox fbdesk fbpager fluxconf , that's a nice small X
2007-09-15T10:09:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	thanks. is aptitude like a better apt-get?
2007-09-15T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	they both have their strengths, it's really a matter of taste
2007-09-15T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	aptitude has some extra useful switches you can use, but they're not needed much.
2007-09-15T10:11:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	thanks v much
2007-09-15T10:28:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	sorry to bother again. what  ls switches would let me recursively search for a particular file and then display the full path to that file (so i can find it and symlink it) righ tnow am using ls /* -R | grep mongrel_rails which shows mongrel_rails exists, but not where
2007-09-15T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	easiest way is locate mongrel_rails ; if it doesn't show up, do sudo updatedb and then locate again
2007-09-15T10:30:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	cheers
2007-09-15T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	 pidof
2007-09-15T11:15:00.000Z	steve_j	nickrud	it finds nothing, even tho i know a mongrel is running. if it's detached itself or something, is there a way to find it?
2007-09-15T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	steve_j	ps aux will show all the processes
