2008-01-26T07:15:00.000Z	leila		i installed the nvidia drivers from nvidia web site

2008-01-26T07:16:00.000Z	leila		i dont want install the ubuntu nvidia drivers
2008-01-26T07:16:00.000Z	__mikem	leila	you are sort of going to have to. Besides, i have never had any problems with them
2008-01-26T07:17:00.000Z	__mikem		And just for the record, those drivers are the nvidia official drivers
2008-01-26T07:17:00.000Z	leila	__mikem	what modules i have to write in xorg.conf?
2008-01-26T07:18:00.000Z	__mikem	leila	if you use the restricted driver manager, it should do everything for you
2008-01-26T07:18:00.000Z	__mikem		but before you do that, you might want to undo what ever you tried to do up til this point
2008-01-26T07:19:00.000Z	leila	__mikem	of course but i have installed the vendor drivers, i would like how to enable 3d with this drivers
2008-01-26T07:19:00.000Z	__mikem	leila	just trust me.
