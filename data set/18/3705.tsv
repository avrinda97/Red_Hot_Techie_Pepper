2009-08-15T10:09:00.000Z	spirosl		hi everyone
2009-08-15T10:09:00.000Z	spirosl		I've just recently installed ubuntu and let me say that it's fantastic!
2009-08-15T10:10:00.000Z	spirosl		i reinstalled windows VISTA and then UBUNTU on a dual boot scenario and if i can get ubunto working correctly then I'll bugger off Windows all together
2009-08-15T10:11:00.000Z	spirosl		so can i ask you guys , how can i determine if all of my devices on my laptop have been detected correctly
2009-08-15T10:12:00.000Z	spirosl		and do you prefer rythmic or amarok as a music player
2009-08-15T10:13:00.000Z	spirosl		anyonw know about how X / GNOME initialise on UBUNTU..
2009-08-15T10:14:00.000Z	spirosl		the only thing i found wrong with it
2009-08-15T10:14:00.000Z	spirosl		is that when it initialises for a split second i can see some graphics on the screen that are only a few pixels in length
2009-08-15T10:14:00.000Z	spirosl		and then the logo is brought up
2009-08-15T10:14:00.000Z	spirosl		im wondering if there is a way i can make it initialise properly
2009-08-15T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spirosl	 the video card  is intiilzing you mean and you see a little  bit of gfx junk?
2009-08-15T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spirosl	 if thats your biggest problem..  count yourself lucky. :)
2009-08-15T10:16:00.000Z	spirosl	Dr_Willis	yes ... is there a way to resolve it?
2009-08-15T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spirosl	 no idea. Im not to worried about seeing the card 'initilize'
2009-08-15T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spirosl	 its a driver  thing most likely.. so will depend on the driver/card/driver version/kernel version..
2009-08-15T10:17:00.000Z	spirosl	Dr_Willis	all i know is that i've instaled 9.04 and it seems to be working fine with my video card... so you think i should now go through all of my hardward and use the recommended drivers from each manufacturer.. my laptop is a HP laptop.
2009-08-15T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spirosl	 i see such artifacts every so often  then they vanish next driver releaee, and perhaps come back..  its  not worth loseing sleep over.
2009-08-15T10:19:00.000Z	spirosl	Dr_Willis	OK.. so what's my next plan... what should i do now? aside from using this great OS? should i go through each device to make sure its found and using the correct driver
