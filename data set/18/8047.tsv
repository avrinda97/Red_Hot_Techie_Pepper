2007-10-10T06:02:00.000Z	joaob		I tried mknod-ing /dev/hdb1, to no avail.
2007-10-10T06:03:00.000Z	joaob		and put it ina  directory that is in your PATH environment variable.
2007-10-10T06:05:00.000Z	joaob		anyone have any ideia on how to make /dev/hdb1 accessible ?
2007-10-10T06:06:00.000Z	juan__	joaob	can you be more specific?
2007-10-10T06:08:00.000Z	joaob	juan__	here it is...I have a recently installed system, and /dev/hdb1 is simply not there, in /dev.
2007-10-10T06:08:00.000Z	joaob	juan__	although there is a NTFS partition tehre which works under windows
2007-10-10T06:14:00.000Z	juan__	joaob	you need to install ntfs configuration tool
2007-10-10T06:15:00.000Z	juan__	joaob	you find it in add/remove
2007-10-10T06:16:00.000Z	joaob	juan__	I can't see how that will help , if the partiotin table is corrupt.
