2006-01-19T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	what problem is that?
2006-01-19T08:20:00.000Z	Exxcaliber	soundray	A strange one :)

2006-01-19T08:21:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	you have a device conflict. You may have to play with interrupt settings in the BIOS setup.
2006-01-19T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	is it a laptop?
2006-01-19T08:24:00.000Z	Exxcaliber	soundray	yep :)
2006-01-19T08:27:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	what's the device name of your CD?
2006-01-19T08:30:00.000Z	Exxcaliber	soundray	/dev/hdb
2006-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	unfortunately, your options are very limited in a laptop where hd and cd are on the same IDE channel.
2006-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	are you sure your BIOS won't let you change anything?
2006-01-19T08:34:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	maybe you can turn some unneeded device off (serial? infrared? sound?) -- that might fix it.
2006-05-05T07:29:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	why don't you just apt-get --reinstall install fdutils
2006-05-05T07:30:00.000Z	Exxcaliber	soundray	i didn't know I could do that, what will then happen?
2006-05-05T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	it will overwrite all the files in the fdutils package (dpkg -L fdutils to list them all), regenerating your /etc/ file in the process.
2006-05-05T07:31:00.000Z	Exxcaliber	soundray	anyways something with my internet connection is messed up so no connection to the repositories
2006-05-05T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	it will work without if the deb is still in the cache.
2006-05-05T07:33:00.000Z	Exxcaliber	soundray	are you like the author of fdutils, since you knew that mediarpm was part of that package!? :D
2006-05-05T07:33:00.000Z	soundray	Exxcaliber	no, I looked it up.
