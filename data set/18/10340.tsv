2006-12-14T16:12:00.000Z	dsnyders		How do I automatically run the same command in each sub-folder?
2006-12-14T16:13:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	for i in `find /path/to/dir`; do command $i; done;
2006-12-14T16:15:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	thanks for the pointer.  You too, jrib
2006-12-18T08:32:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	there's sbackup -- a simple desktop backup tool
2006-12-18T08:20:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	you can always install kasteroids now and remove it later
2006-12-18T08:22:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	Synaptic wants to install a whole mess of things: kjumpingcubes, korn, flac, atlantic, kadressbook, etc.
2006-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	I find that funny -- errm, on a more serious note, you can always install bacula from source
2006-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	In fact, It looks like it is installing the whole KDE evironment
2006-12-18T08:24:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	thats odd -- maybe there is a KDE/Qt front end to bacula that depends on KDE which inturn depends on all these various other packages
2006-12-18T08:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	Perhaps, but nothing but games should depend on kamusements.
2006-12-18T08:25:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	there are some odd dependants on that package -- i think they depend on the libraries
2006-12-18T08:26:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	perhaps there is a setting in synaptic for recommended packages vs strict dependencies?
2006-12-18T08:28:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	yes, I am installing via synaptic.
2006-12-18T08:28:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	n/m -- the problem exists otherwise too
2006-12-18T08:29:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	if i were to install bacula i'd build it from source
2006-12-18T08:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	any other backup packages?  I am just backing up from partition to partition on the same machine (different drives)
2006-12-18T08:31:00.000Z	un_operateur1	dsnyders	there's amanda which is used on redhat/fedora quite ubiquitously
2006-12-18T08:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	un_operateur1	Thanks.  I'll take a look at that one.
