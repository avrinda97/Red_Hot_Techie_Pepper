2009-07-29T15:32:00.000Z	jado		hi, i have an internet problem, sometimes after a while, it seems that the dns goes down so i can't browse anymore. Just now it went down and i can't ping www.google.com but i'm still connected (unknown host)
2009-07-29T15:32:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	are you behind a router?
2009-07-29T15:33:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	a home router yes, if i reboot it it's going to work, but i'm trying to find another solution than always rebooting
2009-07-29T15:34:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	try reconnecting your cable instead of rebooting the router
2009-07-29T15:34:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	maybe your DHCP server is not working well
2009-07-29T15:35:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	the problem is on every computer of the house, not just mine (windows XP/vista or ubuntu)
2009-07-29T15:35:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	then the problem is probably coming from your router, the DHCP server, try to change the router
2009-07-29T15:35:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	what's with the DHCP ? i do have an ip address; the problem is more on the DNS right ?
2009-07-29T15:35:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	DHCP is the system the router uses to assign a IP in your internal network (LAN)
2009-07-29T15:36:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	yes, and i do have an ip address so the problem is not coming from there (i'm well connected on internet as i'm talking to you right now) it's just that i can't solve domain names
2009-07-29T15:36:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	Does your router resolve DNSs from a preconfigured IP?
2009-07-29T15:37:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	what do you mean? from a computer with a fixed IP?
2009-07-29T15:38:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	have you checked the DNS settings on your router?
2009-07-29T15:39:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	i don't see such a setting in the router config
2009-07-29T15:39:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	then it's autoresolved, definitely the problem comes from the router
2009-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	yes but why the problem goes away when i reboot it ?
2009-07-29T15:41:00.000Z	jado	Beyecixramd	well i'll just reboot
2009-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	jado	OK
