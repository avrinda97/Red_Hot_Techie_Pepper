2010-10-04T03:30:00.000Z	jfarrell		hey guys, i have been trying for the past 30 to get ssh to start at system startup using update-rc.d - can anyone lend a hand, seems my linux is out of date
2010-10-04T03:31:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-10-04T03:32:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	All you need to do to get ssh (the server, right?) to start when you boot is install the 'openssh-server' package
2010-10-04T03:32:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	There's nothing else required, just `sudo apt-get install openssh-server` and you're done
2010-10-04T03:32:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	yup
2010-10-04T03:33:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	i have ssh already installe, though i did apt-get install ssh
2010-10-04T03:34:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	Can you connect locally?
2010-10-04T03:34:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	affirmative
2010-10-04T03:35:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	I meant locally over ssh, it's likely not an ssh issue if you can connect locally
2010-10-04T03:35:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	strange, it is saying i already have ssh
2010-10-04T03:35:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	'ssh' installs openssh-server, so yeah, you do.
2010-10-04T03:35:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	Are you port forwarding at your router successfully?
2010-10-04T03:36:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	this is all inside the network
2010-10-04T03:36:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	Do you have the correct IP?
2010-10-04T03:38:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	ahh i found the problem
2010-10-04T03:38:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	Good to hear
2010-10-04T03:41:00.000Z	jfarrell	Flannel	i dont suppose you have any ideas on how to autoamte that portion
2010-10-04T03:41:00.000Z	Flannel	jfarrell	I don't, no.  I don't deal with wifi a whole lot.  Someone else in this channel can probably help you though, just not me :)
