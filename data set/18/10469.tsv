2006-11-30T11:17:00.000Z	NoUse	Freshwaterlarry	have you run through the gnome printer wizard? I think that supports windows shared printers
2006-11-30T11:19:00.000Z	Freshwaterlarry	NoUse	 Nope.  I am using samba and cups, with firefox .  Should I try with Gnome?
2006-11-30T11:26:00.000Z	NoUse	Freshwaterlarry	yes the gnome printer wizard supports Windows shared printers
