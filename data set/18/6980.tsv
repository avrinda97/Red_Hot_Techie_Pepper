2008-02-29T19:26:00.000Z	vlt		Does it make sense to install chrootkit on a possibly compromised machine?
2008-02-29T19:27:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	not really, but its the best hes gonna do
2008-02-29T19:27:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	Shouldn't he rather check the hard drive from a voot disk?
2008-02-29T19:29:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	I pm'd you, you might not get it/be able to answer back if you are not regged
2008-02-29T20:06:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	nothing wrong with that
2008-02-29T20:07:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	err, whats the =>
2008-02-29T20:07:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	I just use "=>" here to show the result of the command.
2008-02-29T20:08:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	touch 1; touch 2; mv 2 1 should work fine
2008-02-29T20:08:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	I expected to be allowed to mv if I'm allowd to touch .. hmmmm
2008-02-29T20:08:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	Maybe it's an sshfs problem.
2008-02-29T20:08:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	is this done remotely?
2008-02-29T20:09:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	you might not have overwwrite permission
2008-02-29T20:09:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	There's a difference between write and overwrite?
2008-02-29T20:09:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	Didn't know that. Where is this defined?
2008-02-29T20:11:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	if its ssh then its in ssh config. Many applications permit you to create a file but not remove one. An overwrite effectivly removes the file
2008-02-29T20:19:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	`rm 1` is possible, and then also `mv 2 1`.
2008-02-29T20:19:00.000Z	vlt	Squawk	why not `mv 2 1`? Weird.
2008-02-29T20:20:00.000Z	Squawk	vlt	like I said, overwrite (I know ive seen overwrite permission in ftpd confs before)
