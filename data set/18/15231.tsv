2005-06-09T13:08:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	if i repeat apt-get then it gets ok after several time
2005-06-09T13:08:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	try apt-get clean
2005-06-09T13:10:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	i am still getting it ! note  i upgraded from debian testing to hoary could that be an issue ?
2005-06-09T13:10:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	do you have debian sources in your apt/sources.list?
2005-06-09T13:11:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	no totally .. ijust cut 'n paste from my laptop
2005-06-09T13:12:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	anyway what are the steps to get gpg keys for nerim if you dont mind ?
2005-06-09T13:13:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	see http://www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-06-09T13:13:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	but if you only have official ubuntu repositories in your /etc/apt/sources.list, that is not your problem
2005-06-09T13:15:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	i have not even universe
2005-06-09T13:16:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	how about apt-get install ubuntu-keyring?
2005-06-09T13:16:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	i also get this annoying thing on my laptop. however it goes away after a couple tries. but now on the server its still borking. this is kind of worrying !
2005-06-09T13:17:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	it cant authenticate keyring as well !
2005-06-09T13:17:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	i'm pretty sure that without ubuntu-keyring, it won't authenticate anything :)
2005-06-09T13:18:00.000Z	dos000	pestilence	i did apt-get update ; apt-get clean .. and now it seems to work !
2005-06-09T13:19:00.000Z	pestilence	dos000	good.
