2009-05-12T23:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	you don't need to upgrade  to a later version of Ubuntu for a newer VLC
2009-05-15T20:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	Ext3 has been around for years and is rather stable.   Ext4 has a few issues  that are mentioned in the release notes.   it checks the disk quicker and better with bigger files they say
2009-05-15T20:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	see above for release notes link
2009-05-15T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	you could install your own kernel,  but   I  woudn't really recommend doing so for distros such as Ubuntu,   if  you were  using Gentoo for example, well then sure if you want
2009-05-15T20:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	just  get the kernel updates  when they are available for Ubuntu :)
2009-05-15T20:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	old kernel and 9.04   does not sound  like they are going to play nice with each other.   plus the old kernel will have bugs that a later one does not have
2009-05-15T20:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	of course not
2009-05-15T20:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	siddhartha	is any big software totally  no bugs?  nope
