2010-02-12T22:05:00.000Z	WeirdAAR		Hello, I just saw the following when install Battle for Wesnoth. "The following packages were installed and are no longer needed "20-30 names". Type sudo apt-get autoremove to remove them". What should I make of this?
2010-02-12T22:06:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	copy/paste them if you are unsure, else just autoremove them

2010-02-12T22:06:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	copy & paste them to a local textfile for future reference, or just autoremove them
2010-02-12T22:07:00.000Z	WeirdAAR	nibbler	Well if terminal suggest I remove them I guess it's because they are unused?
2010-02-12T22:08:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	most likeley, yes. whenever a packet gets installed as dependency and not explicitly it is subject to autoremoval, once it is not directly needed anymore. but maybe you started using something of it - after all you could reinstall it easily anyways
2010-02-12T22:09:00.000Z	WeirdAAR	nibbler	Yeah that makes sense. I just a saw a package like "libqt4-sql-mysql" and I got not sure whether to do it or not
2010-02-12T22:10:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	thats why i recommended to make a local copy+paste, so that if you miss something you have less trouble finding out the package it belongs to or whatever
2010-02-12T22:10:00.000Z	WeirdAAR	nibbler	Could I be that I recently made a major update and this is the outdated packages?
2010-02-12T22:11:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	not outdated in a way taht there is newer versions of this on your system now, but outdated like in "not needed anymore"
2010-02-12T22:11:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	maybe foosoft-1.0-22 needed libbar as dependecy, but with foosoft-1.0-24 this dependency is gone.
2010-02-12T22:12:00.000Z	WeirdAAR	nibbler	Ok. Well I will make a local text copy as you suggested and use autoremove. Thanks for the help.
2010-02-12T22:12:00.000Z	nibbler	WeirdAAR	no problem
