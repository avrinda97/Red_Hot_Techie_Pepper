2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	danhs		once I've connected to a samba share through gnome, how can I *sign out*?
2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	danhs		I want to stop connecting as current suer
2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	danhs		but I set it to "save password forever"
2008-10-02T01:39:00.000Z	danhs		should be easy
2008-10-02T01:40:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	you can right click it in nautilus and disconnect
2008-10-02T01:42:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	that just sounds like permissions/share settings
2008-10-02T01:44:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	did you set up a chroot?
2008-10-02T01:44:00.000Z	danhs	ejer	no
2008-10-02T01:44:00.000Z	danhs	ejer	but it's possible the guy who originally did system might have
2008-10-02T01:47:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	what is the problem? that people can read others directories?
2008-10-02T01:47:00.000Z	danhs	ejer	no.  I can only read *my* directory for user I'm signed in as
2008-10-02T01:47:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	this is normal
2008-10-02T01:50:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	http://wwwold.openfiler.com/docs/faq/openfiler-administration-faq.html#d0e175
2008-10-02T01:51:00.000Z	danhs	ejer	problem is that I see same thing for my personal share as I see for /administrator
2008-10-02T01:51:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	it is not wacky if you set it up that way... you have total control
2008-10-02T01:52:00.000Z	danhs	ejer	the link you sent doesn't mention anything about seeing other users home directory
2008-10-02T01:52:00.000Z	ejer	danhs	you need to read admin guide
