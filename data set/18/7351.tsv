2009-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adam7	that'd wipe the partition. i'm fairly certain he has only 2 including the swap
2009-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	wiping was the point :)
2009-01-08T14:29:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	when I install XP I get 600x800, no sound, network. I'm lucky the keyboard works :/

2009-01-08T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adam7	all my hardware is on the HCL as works out of the box (even my wifi)

2009-01-09T15:01:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	does http://pastebin.com/m2aea0117 mean anything to you?
2009-01-09T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adam7	you are running a 32bit linux and trying to install 64bit packages
2009-01-09T15:02:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	it's not mine, it's from the same person who had the kubuntu-kde4 package
2009-01-09T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adam7	well whoever it is, thats whats happening
2009-01-09T15:03:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	ok, even though it says Errno architecture (x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi-2.6.15.7) does not match executable architecture (x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi-2.6.24-16-server) -- they're both x86_64 ?
2009-01-09T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adam7	if you run uname -a you will see what architecture you are running
2009-01-09T15:09:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	util-linux has things like dmesg/tail in it
2009-01-09T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adam7	press esc when grub offers it, you'll see recover mode next to your kernel
2009-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	adam7	ActionParsnip	does opera use gtk?
