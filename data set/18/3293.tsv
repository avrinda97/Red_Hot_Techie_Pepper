2009-11-02T22:40:00.000Z	Revol5		To get Flash working, I'm going to completely uninstall Firefox and reinstall it. When I get it back on, do I need to install both 3.0 and 3.5?
2009-11-02T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 i doubt if reinstalling \ firefox will make flash work
2009-11-02T22:41:00.000Z	Revol5	Dr_Willis	I'm running out of ideas haha
2009-11-02T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 flash is a pain. see if it works in Opera or Chrome/Chromium perhaps
2009-11-02T22:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 thers some extra flash-related package that might be needed i recall for sound in some cases
2009-11-02T22:45:00.000Z	Revol5	Dr_Willis	what does chromium have to do with flash?
2009-11-02T22:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 its another browser you can test. Ive had better luck with flash working in it then opera
2009-11-02T22:45:00.000Z	Revol5	Dr_Willis	On my repo it's a 'fast paced, arcade-style, scrolling space shooter'
2009-11-02T22:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	  its not in the repos. its the new browser by google.
2009-11-02T22:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 aka 'chrome'
2009-11-02T23:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 no its not.
2009-11-02T23:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 the firefox that came on my 64bit  Karmic.. is 64bit... from what that dialog shows
2009-11-02T23:06:00.000Z	Revol5	Dr_Willis	Did you do an upgrade or clean install
2009-11-02T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 been using beta and rc.. and i always do clean installs
2009-11-02T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 what does uname -a say about your system
2009-11-02T23:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 You got the 32bit installed it seems...
2009-11-02T23:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 if you got more then 4 gb ram.. you may want to reinstall 64bit.. or if you do a lot of encoding video or other hard core stuff.
2009-11-02T23:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Revol5	 proberly not an issue then
