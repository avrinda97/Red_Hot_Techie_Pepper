2005-08-31T14:30:00.000Z	adriyel__		you DO know that portage provides precompiled binaries over the net right?
2005-08-31T14:32:00.000Z	adriyel__		I use ubuntu 64
2005-08-31T14:32:00.000Z	adriyel__		I use Slack10.1 and slamd64, depending on my mood
2005-08-31T14:33:00.000Z	adriyel__		slackware/gentoo combined taught me a LOT about Linux
2005-08-31T14:34:00.000Z	adriyel__		reiserfs in my experience is more adaptable, stable, and faster
2005-08-31T14:34:00.000Z	adriyel__		there is no loss to using reiserfs, to my knowledge
2005-08-31T14:35:00.000Z	adriyel__		I guess some people are just stuck on ext3
2005-08-31T14:35:00.000Z	adriyel__		wtf? @ lassel
2005-08-31T14:35:00.000Z	adriyel__		you can?
2005-08-31T14:35:00.000Z	adriyel__		I'd suggest ReiserFS, personally. (don't use Reiser4, its still being dev'ed heavily)
2005-08-31T14:35:00.000Z	nerdy2	adriyel__	ext3 is based on ext2, which is readable/writable from windows
2005-08-31T14:36:00.000Z	adriyel__	nerdy2	ahhh. secondary piece of software and @ nalioth
2005-08-31T14:36:00.000Z	adriyel__	nerdy2	ext3 is the same as ext2, it just has journaling
2005-08-31T14:36:00.000Z	nerdy2	adriyel__	nothing can be done with windows alone, everything's secondary
2005-08-31T14:36:00.000Z	adriyel__	nerdy2	I know this. thank you
2005-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	adriyel__	nerdy2	thats why I use Linux, except for games
2005-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	nerdy2	adriyel__	tried battle for wesnoth? :)
2005-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	adriyel__	nerdy2	I play games that require skill, sorry.
