2007-03-21T10:37:00.000Z	l90bpm		you can change the ip address if you like.. but I usually just leave mine what dhcp changed..  none of that matters.. just how it's assigned matters.. static or dhcp
2007-03-21T10:39:00.000Z	l90bpm		after you get a static address you will have to go into the router
2007-03-21T10:39:00.000Z	l90bpm		192.168.x.x something to that affect
2007-03-21T10:39:00.000Z	l90bpm		yeah..
2007-03-21T10:40:00.000Z	l90bpm		probably under applications and gaming
2007-03-21T10:40:00.000Z	l90bpm		in here you can set a range..  I usually just make it 1 number all the way across
2007-03-21T10:40:00.000Z	l90bpm		two numbers the same or whatever
2007-03-21T10:40:00.000Z	l90bpm		and label it utor
