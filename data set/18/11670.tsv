2007-07-04T07:27:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	 I wish it was that easy
2007-07-04T07:27:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	it is 99 % of the time
2007-07-04T07:28:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	aptitude search canlib kvaser nothing there
2007-07-04T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	if you use apt-file, you can actually figure out which package a particular file is in
2007-07-04T07:31:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	what do you get when you type in apt-file search canlib.h
2007-07-04T07:31:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	it is not in any packages, that is what !find does with the bot
2007-08-04T06:15:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	what is hyperterminal meant to do
2007-08-04T06:16:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	I want to open up a serial port (com3 like) and see the data coming in
2007-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	I am gonna try gtkterm it looks similar
2007-08-24T16:59:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	I would suggest you install it from the repositories
2007-08-24T16:59:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	I have sun-java5-jdk installed.  it comes with 1.4
2007-08-24T16:59:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	then what are you hemming and hawing about
2007-08-24T05:09:00.000Z	hwilde	bruenig	if I do locate java and grep 1.5 it is there, but j2se/1.4 is also there.  netbeans seems to be looking at the 1.4
2007-08-24T05:11:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	perhaps you installed java 1.4 as well, perhaps blackdown or whatever it is
2007-10-04T05:47:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	it does that in post install scripts often
2007-10-04T05:48:00.000Z	bruenig	hwilde	how does it launch a random program, does it assign each program a random number and then use a random number generator to pick between them
