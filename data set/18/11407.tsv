2006-08-05T08:56:00.000Z	avu	nikin	http://ie.releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/6.06/release/ is one of the europen mirrors carrying the dvd
2006-08-05T08:56:00.000Z	avu	nikin	it's not on every mirror
2006-08-05T08:57:00.000Z	nikin	avu	i used this site to download stuff: http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/?C=S;O=A
2006-08-05T09:06:00.000Z	avu	nikin	it isn't
2006-08-05T09:07:00.000Z	nikin	avu	then what should i do, i have a wlancard and drivers are in source format, and without it i cant connect to internet...
2006-08-05T09:08:00.000Z	avu	nikin	you could burn a CD with the packages on another computer
2006-08-05T09:08:00.000Z	avu	nikin	I think I saw a HOWTO for something like that a while ago
2006-08-05T09:09:00.000Z	avu	nikin	let me check to see if I can find it
