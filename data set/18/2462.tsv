2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		I know soyo, but let's say that I can't and that CTRL + ALT + F1 does nothing
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		Nor Alt + Tab
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		I heard about SYSREQ keys to press or something
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		No smartviking
2010-05-19T23:12:00.000Z	MPX		I know all this sebsebseb
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	MPX		But I'm for example talking about a fullscreen game that has crashed, leaving me with a black screen, with a moving mouse cursor
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	MPX		and ALT + TAB (CTRL + f1) does not work
2010-05-19T23:13:00.000Z	MPX		That was it Cynthia thanks :D But is there not a key combo exept for CTRL + ALT + f1 that will bring me to a terminal?
2010-05-19T23:14:00.000Z	MPX		Is there not another one that can bring me into a safe shell?
2010-05-19T23:16:00.000Z	MPX		CTRL + ALT + BACKSPACE...I thought that was disabled in the newer UBUNTU distros....how can I re-enable that key combo?
2010-05-19T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MPX	Cynthia: its also a config item in the keyboard section in preferences
2010-10-25T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MPX	reapply your bootsplash theme maybe
2010-10-25T17:44:00.000Z	MPX	ActionParsnip	Thank you for the tip. Will try :)
2010-10-25T17:45:00.000Z	MPX	ActionParsnip	searching thru synaptic, I found no deb for this so that must mean it's a simple command right? Running Vanilla with no custom bootsplash. Do you know what that command would be? Is it in a config?
2010-10-25T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MPX	want the sunrise theme?
2010-10-25T17:47:00.000Z	MPX	ActionParsnip	I would just like the vanilla one to work :) I like vanilla =)
2010-10-25T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MPX	sudo apt-get --reinstall install plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo
2010-10-25T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MPX	there are lots of themes in the repos dude, just search for plymouth
