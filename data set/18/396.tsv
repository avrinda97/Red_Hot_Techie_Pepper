2012-03-28T23:41:00.000Z	mody		I had windows 7 & ubuntu latest sde by side,  have just done rcovery for windows and now I get "no such partition grub resque"
2012-03-28T23:41:00.000Z	mody		now i have installed a new ubuntu and i still see thee message!
2012-03-28T23:41:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	have you checked if ubuntu is even there?
2012-03-28T23:42:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	boot a ubuntu cd or usb open gparted and look if ubuntu is still on the HD.
2012-03-28T23:44:00.000Z	mody	Fyodorovna	my "try ubuntu" wont work i have just installed a fresh ubuntu again ow i think i have 2 installations of ubuntu
2012-03-28T23:45:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	you will need to boot the cd to a desktop to fix grub and get other info really.
2012-03-28T23:46:00.000Z	mody	Fyodorovna	im downloading boot repair and will make a bootable usb, will that work?
2012-03-28T23:47:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	possibly, but save the bootscript it makes if it doesn't to post.
2012-03-28T23:49:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	you can look in gparted, sudo fdisk -l will tell you of the partitions.
2012-03-28T23:50:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	to be honest we are missing a lot of info to really help you.
2012-03-28T23:52:00.000Z	mody	Fyodorovna	i had ubuntu and windows 7 side by side for  months, today i did a recovery for windows and that messed up the grub, i cant boot to windows nor ubuntu anymore all i get is partition message with grub rescue , so now i run live cd and did another ubuntu installation thought i lost my old one and now i think i have more than 5 partition in /dev
2012-03-28T23:53:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	your words mean very little to be honest to may variables here. You do not even know what is on thew HD as pf now.
2012-03-28T23:54:00.000Z	mody	Fyodorovna	its very clear, if i run fdisk -l , i will get:
2012-03-28T23:54:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	pastebin the fdisk
2012-03-28T23:55:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	pastebin the terminal output of fdisk
2012-03-28T23:55:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	that is all I have to hear good luck.
2012-03-28T23:56:00.000Z	mody	Fyodorovna	i have been very clear
2012-03-29T00:00:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	mody	without the bootscript your really risking many more problems and little sure help from the channel.
