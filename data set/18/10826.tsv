2006-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	idefix		so, I have this HP deksjet 710 C printer connected to my PC but I can't get it running, it won't print the test page.. what can it be?
2006-10-31T07:33:00.000Z	teledyn	idefix	did you try setting it up with cups?  http://localhost:631    and install cups and whatever filters you need?
2006-10-31T07:34:00.000Z	idefix	teledyn	the Printers window says my printer is Ready!
2006-10-31T07:35:00.000Z	teledyn	idefix	try restarting cups.  and try the cups interface i listed above and check job control make sure no old jobs clogging up the queue
2006-10-31T07:35:00.000Z	teledyn	idefix	( i don't know about the ubuntu printer config)
2006-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	teledyn	idefix	that main printing system for linux

2006-10-31T07:49:00.000Z	idefix	teledyn	sorry I switched dirs first and then executed
2006-10-31T07:51:00.000Z	teledyn	idefix	check out the cups homepage and look for an entry for your printer model.  maybe they have tips on setting it up.  and check the web interface i told you about.
