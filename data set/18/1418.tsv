2011-10-17T03:39:00.000Z	Jasonn		HUGE PROBLEM. Ok, so I did this http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/block-ssh-attacks-with-denyhosts/ and I blocked all hosts from connecting via ssh. What can I do?
2011-10-17T03:40:00.000Z	Ibis	Jasonn	Panic? o_O
2011-10-17T03:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	Ibis	:s ikr
2011-10-17T03:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	Ibis	I added my host to the allowed hosts, but I blocked all hosts, thinking that mine would be the exception
2011-10-17T03:40:00.000Z	Ibis		Nicke: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
2011-10-17T03:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	Ibis	any way I could "hack" my own server ?

2011-10-17T03:41:00.000Z	Ibis	Jasonn	Err, do you know security flaws of your server? Otherwise. It should be fine, if set up properly.
2011-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	Jasonn	Ibis	Well, I am running ircd on it, and thats it
2011-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	Jasonn		well
2011-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	Jasonn		also a torrent server, and a website
2011-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	Jasonn		torrent client *
2011-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	Ibis	Jasonn	It should be fine.
2011-10-17T03:43:00.000Z	Ibis	Jasonn	If problems come up, you'll know how to fix it. (That is if you find the source of the problem).
2011-10-17T03:43:00.000Z	Jasonn	Ibis	nothing else I can do to get into it? (its running debian, btw, but I thought this would be the best place to come)
2011-10-17T03:44:00.000Z	Jasonn	Ibis	I doubt you understand. I want to hack my own server because I blocked all SSH connections.
2011-10-17T03:44:00.000Z	Ibis	Jasonn	Okay.    I like to use ISPConfig3 for my productional server.
2011-10-17T03:44:00.000Z	Ibis	Jasonn	Then get cracking?
