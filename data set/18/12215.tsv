2012-01-14T19:13:00.000Z	Masters		I was trying out the fingerprint scanner but it caused problems during the screen lock
2012-01-14T19:14:00.000Z	Masters		so I went back into the common-auth file and removed the lines I added
2012-01-14T19:14:00.000Z	Masters		now it won't let me log in
2012-01-14T19:14:00.000Z	Masters		does anyone know the default root password?
