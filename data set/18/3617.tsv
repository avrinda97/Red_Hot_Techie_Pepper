2009-09-04T14:07:00.000Z	Hagus		cannot access `home/calum/.gvfs': Permission denied
2009-09-04T14:07:00.000Z	Hagus		Is that error serious?
2009-09-04T14:08:00.000Z	Hagus		Ought I to be denied access?
2009-09-04T14:08:00.000Z	Hagus		I am the only user of this machine.
2009-09-04T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	you should have full access to all your own data?
2009-09-04T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	what is the output of: ls -l ~/.gvfs
2009-09-04T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	ls -la ~/.gvfs/    sorry
2009-09-04T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	you dont have write ability for some reason
2009-09-04T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	sudo chmod -R o+w ~/.gvfs
2009-09-04T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	you missed the s off the end of the command
2009-09-04T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	dont run partial commands, you may damage your system
2009-09-04T14:16:00.000Z	Hagus	ActionParsnip	Thanks for the tip about partial commands - I knew that that applied when doing things like partitioning but shall be more careful generally now.
2009-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	Hagus	ActionParsnip	From a Google search, I saw that some are reporting this issue as a bug.  However the solutions offered did not work for me.
2009-09-04T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	its a directory
2009-09-04T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	i think its for automounting partitions, not sure but you should have ful access to everything in your home folder
2009-10-19T22:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	could install openoffice on vista too
2009-10-19T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hagus	makes sense to me
2009-10-19T22:37:00.000Z	Hagus	ActionParsnip	I shall try your tip.  It will be tomorrow evening before I know if it works though.
