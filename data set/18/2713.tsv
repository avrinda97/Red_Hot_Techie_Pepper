2010-07-07T07:50:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	which notifications?
2010-07-07T07:53:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	I'm having problems with the clicking sounds when you move the selection around. It works on Windows, but on Ubuntu, the sounds aren't coming through. The option is checked, so I'm thinking it's a pulseaudio problem.
2010-07-07T07:54:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	ding ding! You are correct, the old sounds are implemented in ALSA I think, while the videos/music is through pulse.
2010-07-07T07:55:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Dang... Well. What can I do? I want it to work.
2010-07-07T07:56:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	Why do you want the movement sounds so badly? They're also auto-disabled when you're playing videos so they don't get annoying. You could try disabling pulse, but someone else will have to help you there.
2010-07-07T07:57:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Yeah. I guess you're right. I've got another question about Boxee sound. Is there a way to make the volume change though the system volume and not just in Boxee?
2010-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Ok. Thanks anyway. Are you a boxee fan?
2010-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Haha. I figured.
2010-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	not really, XBMC
2010-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Is XBMC still an active project?
2010-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	yes.
2010-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	boxee is XBMC
2010-07-07T08:04:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Thanks man. I'm gonna give XBMC a go.
2010-07-07T08:05:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	stick with what you like best, but XBMC also provides nightlies :-)
2010-07-07T08:05:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	Nice. Boxee hasn't updated in a while?
2010-07-07T08:05:00.000Z	tim	dugger5688	I didn't mean ? i meant .
2010-07-07T08:06:00.000Z	dugger5688	tim	Yeah, not even sure if they're running the latest stable.
