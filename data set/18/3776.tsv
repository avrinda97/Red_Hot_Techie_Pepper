2012-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	slipknot		 hi i am trying to compile ardrone sdk on linux ubuntu 11.10 and i get this error http://pastebin.com/JyykmDqk any idea
2012-01-07T09:55:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	sudo apt-get install libcwiid-dev
2012-01-07T09:57:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	in fact, it seems like none of those packages were installed, so install all of them
2012-01-07T09:57:00.000Z	slipknot		sudo
2012-01-07T09:57:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	except libcwiid1-dev since that package doesn't exist anymore
2012-01-07T09:58:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	i installed i get the same error
2012-01-07T09:59:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	libavutil/avutil.h is in libavutil-dev so not all of them
2012-01-07T10:00:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	ok i will try
2012-01-07T10:00:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	there is a list at the start of your pastebin 'You should install the following packages...'
2012-01-07T10:05:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	the packages is installed the makefile bash script file show always routine checking library from begin
2012-01-07T10:07:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	http://pastebin.com/mDubLMEQ
2012-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	yes, libcwiid1-dev doesn't exist anymore, install libcwiid-dev instead (but keep all the rest on that line)
2012-01-07T10:12:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	i now it is installed for this reason i am confused why the make file show again that he need this file http://pastebin.com/bVLNViAT
2012-01-07T10:13:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	just say no when it asks you to install the package, and it should move on with the compile
2012-01-07T10:14:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	if not the code may need a bit of patching
2012-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	http://pastebin.com/YSVrBKQq i typed no and the same problem
2012-01-07T10:21:00.000Z	trism	slipknot	so you installed libavutil-dev? if so I am out of ideas
2012-01-07T10:32:00.000Z	slipknot	trism	finaly it work
