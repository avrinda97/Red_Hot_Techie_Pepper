2007-11-18T00:56:00.000Z	Dirtbag		Hi all, I have alot of vm questions, anyone familiar with using vm?
2007-11-18T00:56:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	depends on the cm? ;p
2007-11-18T00:57:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	what one do you use?
2007-11-18T00:57:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	VMware?
2007-11-18T00:59:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	when you install a vm, (in my case, I want to have ubuntu as main os, and if i need xp i want to vm xp)does it disapear once ubuntu shuts down?
2007-11-18T01:00:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	its like a seperate computer. you can even set XP to shutdown and start gracefully with your OS. its persistant though, you won't lose info if you use it as its supposed to be
2007-11-18T01:04:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	Ok, can the vm access the internet?
2007-11-18T01:04:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	sure
2007-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	does it do it through the host os or from the xp vm?
2007-11-18T01:18:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	once the vm is installed, do i update/add chipset drivers?
2007-11-18T01:19:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	vmware has a set of drivers included. all you'll need ;)
2007-11-18T01:19:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	ooh cool
2007-11-18T01:20:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	IMO server is free, get it, mess with it, get your hands dirty. its worth the cost in time ;)
2007-11-18T01:23:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	one last question then ill stop buggin ya =) can the vm os allow you to play games on it? directx9 an issue w/vm?
2007-11-18T01:24:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	i think VMware has cheatcoded support for an older DirectX. i would not trust it tho
2007-11-18T01:25:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	oops i lied, 1 more.. ill try the vmware one you suggested. what about virtualbox?
2007-11-18T01:26:00.000Z	faileas	Dirtbag	needs a custom kernel i think. Haven't tried it yet....
2007-11-18T01:26:00.000Z	Dirtbag	faileas	oh ok
