2010-10-16T16:23:00.000Z	Muffie		anyone can help me with STA installation?
2010-10-16T16:24:00.000Z	Muffie		I thought, in 2010, ubuntu 10.10 wouldnt have a problem with a simple wireless card...
2010-10-16T16:25:00.000Z	Muffie		and then, mark shuttleworth is still wondering why Ubuntu is not widely used.
2010-10-16T16:26:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	then use it ?
2010-10-16T16:26:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	well, I would need to compile the driver, but I dont have the headers neither network to get them
2010-10-16T16:28:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	do you know if I can get a binary driver somewhere?
2010-10-16T16:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	no you still need to compile it
2010-10-16T16:29:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	and how can I get headers with no network. I mean, I can use a pendrive, but what should i get and from?
2010-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	make a liveusb from an iso then use it where you have network connection to do this
2010-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	well, I have a live usb 10.10 that I used to install ubuntu
2010-10-16T16:31:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	cant I download a .DEB or something with linux headers?
2010-10-16T16:31:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	yes.
2010-10-16T16:31:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2010-10-16T16:32:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	uname -r shows: 2.6.35-22-generic
2010-10-16T16:35:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	what packages should I get to simulate this command: apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic
2010-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	what you should do is run a virtual machine on the machine you are currently on. then boot up the live iso and perform all these steps. then install apt-on-cd to make a iso of the local deb files you downloaded with apt then move that to your real machine to use
2010-10-16T16:37:00.000Z	airtonix	Muffie	surely virtualbox will run on the machine you are currently using ?
2010-10-16T16:37:00.000Z	Muffie	airtonix	sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter
