2010-01-11T02:24:00.000Z	tps_		hi... i cant seem to get pass the login. If i enter pass word it return me back to login. Help please

2010-01-11T02:26:00.000Z	tps_	Tiders	no... and there is no message like wrong password or anything like that
2010-01-11T02:26:00.000Z	tps_	Tiders	When i enter the password and hit enter, it behaves like it is about to go to the desktop and then just retun back to login
2010-01-11T02:26:00.000Z	tps_	Tiders	it is not live CD
