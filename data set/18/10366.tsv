2007-05-25T06:56:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		sh3r1ff, I changed the network interfaces back to dhcp from a backup file that I have of the interfaces file, it still give the network card the 127.0.0.1... what do I try next.  I have link lights on the card.  this only happened after my 'edgy' upgrade
2007-05-25T06:57:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	what kind of card is it?
2007-05-25T06:58:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	 no clue, it's an asus p3BF motherboard with a 300mhz pentium III in it.  it's old...but it's worked fine until I did the upgrade
2007-05-25T06:58:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	So is it a built in Ethernet controller?
2007-05-25T06:59:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	 no it's a pci plugged one
2007-05-25T06:59:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	I can check the brand here in a sec
2007-05-25T07:03:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	the thernet card is a SMC1244tx v2
2007-05-25T07:04:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	what does lspci -v show you?
2007-05-25T07:04:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	 my connection dropped for a sec. Did you paste that?
2007-05-25T07:05:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	I haven't pasted anything, I have to type it all in here...because I can't connect to the box because of it not seeing the network
2007-05-25T07:05:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	hang on

2007-05-25T07:16:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	I donly pasted in the portion that talked about the ethernet controller, because I have to type everything in... I can't paste from that machine as it's not on the internet...
2007-05-25T07:17:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	one sec
2007-05-25T07:18:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	clearze1	ok
2007-05-25T07:21:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	You said it was working in the earlier versions of ubuntu correct?
2007-05-25T07:27:00.000Z	clearze1	Clarrisa_2008	Your best bet would be to get a livecd of the earlier verison boot it up then run lsmod and see what module is running your ethernet device also lspci will give you more information about the chipset after you have the correct driver. The only other option I know is to compile drivers from source but I'm not sure they are what you would need.
