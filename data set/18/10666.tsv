2011-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	I assume that you installed "within Windows" using Wubi?
2011-02-21T10:45:00.000Z	chriss_	Jordan_U	is there a way to undo that?
2011-02-21T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	It's not wrong per-se, it's just that Wubi has some disadvantages relative to a normal dual boot install where Ubuntu gets its own partition.
2011-02-21T10:48:00.000Z	chriss_	Jordan_U	is there anything I can do or even undo the wubi install
2011-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	You can uninstall Wubi and install Ubuntu normally. You'll have to be sure that there are no files within wubi that you haven't copied somewhere else first.
2011-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	chriss_	Jordan_U	I just installed it and I don't think there are any files anywhere else how do I go about uninstalling wubi?

2011-02-21T10:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	You're welcome.
2011-02-21T11:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	Yes.

2011-02-21T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	There is Wubi installer on the Ubuntu CD as well. To install normally you need to boot from the CD (Insert the CD into your CDROM drive and reboot the computer).
2011-02-21T11:34:00.000Z	chriss_	Jordan_U	I will be able to partition my drive that way and without affecting my windows files right ?
2011-02-21T11:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	Yes.
2011-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	chriss_	Jordan_U	ok thanks I will do it now
2011-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	Though it's always good to have important files backed up.
2011-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chriss_	You're welcome.
2011-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	chriss_	Jordan_U	thanks I did that
