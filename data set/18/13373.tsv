2005-11-28T15:45:00.000Z	robbietjuh		hello all
2005-11-28T15:46:00.000Z	robbietjuh		can someone please give me a little help regarding a lan ip?
2005-11-28T15:47:00.000Z	robbietjuh		i have in ubuntu server lan ip 10.0.0.152 but needs  to be *.151  where can i change that?
2005-11-28T15:47:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 /etc/network/interfaces
2005-11-28T15:49:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 Then I presume the interface you want to have that address is configured dynamically?
2005-11-28T15:49:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 If that's the case, you will need to configure the DHCP server to assign that particular IP to that box.
2005-11-28T15:50:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 What is providing the DHCP service on your LAN?
2005-11-28T15:51:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 Well, some routers allow you to assign specific IP addresses based on the MAC address of the requesting client.
2005-11-28T15:52:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 If yours doesn't, then you will either have to use static IP addresses, or disable the DHCP server in the router and run a DHCP server on the linux box.  Anyway, good luck with it.
2005-11-28T15:55:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 Again, in your /etc/network/interfaces file, you can specify, "iface ethx inet static" and then make sure it has a static IP entry such as, "address 192.168.1.5".
2005-11-28T15:58:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 No.
2005-11-28T15:58:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 You would want two lines...
2005-11-28T15:59:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 "iface eth0 inet static" on one line, and, "address 10.0.0.151" on another.
2005-11-28T16:04:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 I should probably mention that you'll also need a few other directives in your /etc/network/interfaces file for that interface (such as gateway, etc.) if you're running it with a static configuration.
2005-11-28T16:05:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 Hold on a sec... I'll send an example to the pastebin...

2005-11-28T16:13:00.000Z	robbietjuh	rob_p	 Thanks m8
2005-11-28T16:14:00.000Z	rob_p	robbietjuh	 np :-)
