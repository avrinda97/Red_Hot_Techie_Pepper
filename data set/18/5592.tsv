2009-05-10T16:00:00.000Z	userek		hi, I'm trying to install 9.04 on a hp laptop and the installer wont run, there is an error: modprobe: FATAL: /lib/modules/kernel-version****/modules.dep doesn't exist
2009-05-10T16:00:00.000Z	userek		or something like that
2009-05-10T16:00:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	did you try the Alternate version?
2009-05-10T16:01:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	no, what is it?
2009-05-10T16:03:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	it tells me nothing that i don't know...
2009-05-10T16:03:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	try the option to scan the CD for defects. That way you might find out if something went wrong while burning your image.
2009-05-10T16:04:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#bt  <= See how you can download 4 different versions? (32bit desktp/ alternate and AMD64bit Desktop/ Alternae)
2009-05-10T16:04:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	alright, i'll see
2009-05-10T16:07:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	though i don't see how the text mode installer would work better ;), i guess its a bug because after searching a bit there are people with the same issue, and they claim their cd's orked on other machines
2009-05-10T16:09:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	In that case the "bug" is tied to some aspect of your hardware. It runs (and installs) great on my box
2009-05-10T16:10:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	so you say that if it works on your computer and doesn't on someone's else its not a bug?
2009-05-10T19:31:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	mind your language please...You can reconfigure X through the menu to redetect your screeen.
2009-05-10T19:35:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	i'm trying to but this window is too big for that resolution! this should never happen! never! is this supposed to be user friendly? i ran on more problems than using distributions that require to configure everyting by yourself
2009-05-10T19:36:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	Wine is a compatibility layer that tries to it's best, but sometimes you run into some bugs like this one.
2009-05-10T19:36:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	*especially* when you use the Beta versions.
2009-05-10T19:37:00.000Z	userek	matreya6	but ubuntu should back to the normal resoltuion instead of keepeng me in 640x480 after the reboot even in gdm
2009-05-10T19:38:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	true, that seems to be the bug you have encountered. There is also a non-graphical way to configure Xorg which might help you in this case.
2009-05-10T19:39:00.000Z	matreya6	userek	Why would you reboot when you can drop to console mode instead?
