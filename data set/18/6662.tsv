2008-05-07T00:42:00.000Z	HSNews	genii	how I can set: ip,dns-servers,gateway,broadcast to eth1 and use eth1 as Internet adapter. And disable eth0 permanently
2008-05-07T00:44:00.000Z	genii	HSNews	The idea would be to try and deduce the driver name of the eth0 device. Because it is NVidia offhand the name I do not know. This would be from looking at the output of the two commands I specified. Then once tghe driver name is known, put that into the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
