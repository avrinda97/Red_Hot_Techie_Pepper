2011-03-21T12:49:00.000Z	pikkie		my problem is that i have installed ubuntu server on two 1TB drives that runs on raid1, and after i connected another usb drive the server wont start. when i removed the usb drive the server still dont start. i need to get information off the hard drives then i can reformat or whatever i need to do to set that up again, but first i need the data
2011-03-21T12:51:00.000Z	pikkie		is there anybody that can help me to get to the data on the drives?
2011-03-21T12:52:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	can you be more specific
2011-03-21T12:52:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	start with what you're trying to do specifically
2011-03-21T12:58:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	the server version doesn't come with a gui unless you specifically ask it to install
2011-03-21T12:59:00.000Z	pikkie	whizken	yes. and i do not want the gui anyway
2011-03-21T13:00:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	you're trying to locate a usb 1tb drive in /media?
2011-03-21T13:00:00.000Z	pikkie	whizken	the server does not boot now
2011-03-21T13:01:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	how long ago did you install the server?
2011-03-21T13:01:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	the best thing to do is reinstall if you just installe dit and didn't make ne changes
2011-03-21T13:01:00.000Z	pikkie	whizken	i installed it two weeks ago and it ran fine. just friday i added the usb then all the problems started
2011-03-21T13:02:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	is your usb drive still connected when you reboot? connect any external devices and reboot it
2011-03-21T13:03:00.000Z	pikkie	whizken	there is nothing attached to the server. only the two drives inside
2011-03-21T13:03:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	message when you boot it up?
2011-03-21T13:04:00.000Z	pikkie	whizken	the message is that i cant find the boot drive
2011-03-21T13:05:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	i haven't messed with a server iso in almost a year and only for a few days if i did
2011-03-21T13:05:00.000Z	whizken	pikkie	i suggest you wait for better assistance or reinstall if you didn't do much to the server
2011-03-21T13:06:00.000Z	pikkie	whizken	i cant reinstall before the data on the server is backed up
