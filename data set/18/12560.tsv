2006-04-04T14:30:00.000Z	SKoRM		hey people, can any one hint me towards some way of speeding up ubuntu, im running it on a old laptop
2006-04-04T14:31:00.000Z	SKoRM		hmm
2006-04-04T14:33:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	but seriously.  it can be trimmed to a lean system but turning off all the un-nesseccery stuff that starts at boot time and removing gnome and using xfce4 or fvwm  or the like.
2006-04-04T14:38:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	want a list of what i have running so you kinda know what is needed ?
2006-04-04T14:39:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	runlevel  will show what you are in now.
2006-04-04T14:40:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	you probably only want to mess with S and 2
2006-04-04T14:41:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	i think everything listed there is pretty essential.
2006-04-04T14:51:00.000Z	SKoRM	intelikey	whats the defult password for root?
2006-04-04T14:51:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	there is no root password unless you set one.
2006-04-04T15:10:00.000Z	SKoRM	intelikey	its diffentlay starting fastrer ;)
2006-04-04T15:11:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	yes and will run faster, but at the price of making some thing manual rather than auto.
2006-04-04T15:13:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	if you can do most of your work from console and don't need all the eye candy a gui provides.  even a 386 is usable.   not fast, but usable.
2006-04-04T15:15:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	what errors ?    and don't flood. use the pastebin if needed.
2006-04-04T15:16:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	you didn't  ^C that thing did you ?
2006-04-04T15:19:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	oh you want gdm/kdm/xdm   to run at boot?
2006-04-04T15:21:00.000Z	SKoRM	intelikey	can i pm you?
2006-04-04T15:21:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	ok
2006-04-04T15:22:00.000Z	intelikey	SKoRM	if you are regestered you can....
