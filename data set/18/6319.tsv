2009-12-18T23:00:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	nothing. you would have removed the root partition, which of course will make the system unbootable, but the home partition would remain. It will of course depend on LVM remaining in tact
2009-12-18T23:02:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	technically, if you have a boot part that is not wrapped in lvm then the system wouldn't strictly speaking be unbootable, but unusable as you wouldn't have a mounted root part, but that's a triviality and I think you question has more to do with how deleting one partition effects another.
2009-12-18T23:02:00.000Z	Hilikus	zanberdo	how will it remain intact? i actually had that problem (or similar) i had a partition that extended two physical areas and from windows i formatted one of the two into NTFS (so LVM was screwed now) and AFAIK the LVM metadata was lost so all the data was lost, even in the untouched part
2009-12-18T23:03:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	if I understand your situation correctly: LVM remains intact but you've deleted a specific partition within the LVM container, yes? So, with LVM remaining intact the other partition (/home in your example) should remain unhindered
2009-12-18T23:03:00.000Z	Hilikus	zanberdo	actually no, i think LVM was not intact, only a PART of it was intact
2009-12-18T23:05:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	lvm creates physical volumes that then permit the creation of logical volumes that then permit you to partition the logical volumes however you choose. if you did not touch the physical or logical volumes and only removed a partition created within a logical volume, then LVM should not be effected, just the partition in question.
2009-12-18T23:06:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	for instance, I use LVM to create two physical volumes for my netbook: a 4GB PV and a 16 GB PV which I then created a single LV of 20GB which I further partitions (and encrypted) for my file system. if I were to delete say sda5 (as an example), LVM would be unaffected, just the partition I removed.
2009-12-18T23:07:00.000Z	Hilikus	zanberdo	well, i guess i did touch the physical volume, windows doesn't know about lvm so i guess it formatted the PHYSICAL volume. i had 2 physical volumes that i made into 1 logical volume. but for argument's sake assume each physical volume was a logical volume. if the first PHYSICAL volume is destroyed, will the second one die too? i thought so because the metadata is lost as well
2009-12-18T23:07:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	I missed a step, I created another PV out of the two PV's, which allowed for a single PV to create the LV from ... but that's a triffle
2009-12-18T23:08:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	your mixing windows into the equation takes me out of my depth. But based on your description if you mangled a PV it's dependent LV will be disrupted.
2009-12-18T23:09:00.000Z	Hilikus	zanberdo	yea, what you're saynig is removing sda5 the right way, using LVM tools. what i'm talking about is an accident, like windows formatting it, or a part of the disk just dieing. i just want to know how independent are the individual logical volumes
2009-12-18T23:10:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	yeah, I think if your PV's are whacked you can bet the associated LV's are also whacked.
2009-12-18T23:11:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	I'm curious how windows got into the mix. Did you attempt to install windows after you'd already installed linux?
2009-12-18T23:13:00.000Z	Hilikus	zanberdo	partially my fault, but windows also screwed up. i bought a new hdd that had no partition table so i didn't know how to create a PT from linux so i say i'll do it from windows by just telling it to format the drive. i remembered the unit appears there and when you access it it detects it's not formatted and offers to do it. so i did that but the unit that appeared in windows was not from the new drive but my LVM partition. so windows sug
2009-12-18T23:16:00.000Z	Hilikus	zanberdo	basically, windows thought it was unassigned space when in reality it was an LVM type partition
2009-12-18T23:20:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	ah, yes, well I see the problem and yes, if windows ended up reformatting any part of the lvm partition I'd guess all bets are off. You might try booting to a live CD and using the lvm tools to see if you can even see the pv's or lv's.
2009-12-18T23:21:00.000Z	zanberdo	Hilikus	If you can see the lv which contains your home part then maybe you can recover it.
