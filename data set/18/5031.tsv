2008-12-28T06:59:00.000Z	ra		Why do repositories exist?
2008-12-28T07:00:00.000Z	ra		sirstan:It doesn't make sense to me?  They are so far behind
2008-12-28T07:00:00.000Z	ra		It is if the old stuff doesn't work and the new stuff does
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	ra		Exactly so we should make sure what is in the repositories actually works
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	ra		sirstab: Not at all
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	... what doesnt work?
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	ra	sirstan	not at all
2008-12-28T06:59:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	so we dont need to install from source (see Gentoo)
2008-12-28T07:00:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	because they have all the dependencies defined.  ubuntu has a policy of not upgrading versions once distributed.. so if ubuntu 8.04 shipped with open office 2.0 . . it wont upgrade to 3.0 for you.. you need to install ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	then install from source.  99% of the time the distribution version is easier to use than installingfromsource.
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	it does?
2008-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	if it doesnt, bugs.ubuntu.com
2008-12-28T07:02:00.000Z	ra	sirstan	 Zsnes, Pcsx, Wine is at 1.1.1 which doesn't work with PLATNIUM rated games
2008-12-28T07:03:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	virtualbox installed  just fine  for me (8.10)
2008-12-28T07:03:00.000Z	ra	sirstan	 Yeah it installed, then I tried to partition over 100gigs and it didn't work
2008-12-28T07:04:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	That isnt a repo issue.. thats a ubuntu policy.  they wont use a newer rev once its released.
2008-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	No one would use Linux if there werent  repos.
2008-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	sirstan	ra	Just look at LFS userbase vs. Ubuntu user base.
