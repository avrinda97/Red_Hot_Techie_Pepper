2007-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	omegacenti_	Punkunity	its not the ease of use for average joe for Windows, its once you stop being average that windows is so horrible.

2007-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	Punkunity	omegacenti_	i agree, and i will never go back to just windows, and if ubuntu gets some real top-shelf games, then i will never gogto winows
