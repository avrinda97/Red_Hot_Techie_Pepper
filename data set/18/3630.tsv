2009-08-31T04:23:00.000Z	coolcat		why am i not able to use ls via ssh, It issues: ls: illegal option -- - what command should I use instead?
2009-08-31T04:23:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	sounds like your command line is malformed. Care to share it?
2009-08-31T04:25:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	Here is what I type: mzimbres@gate[29]:ls (new line)ls: illegal option -- - usage: (new line)ls [-ABCFGHILPRSTUWZabcdfghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]
2009-08-31T04:26:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	doesn't look quite right. Try adding a space before the ls
2009-08-31T04:27:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	Produces the same thing...
2009-08-31T04:28:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	what *exactly* are you typing, again?
2009-08-31T04:29:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	I am typing just "ls"
2009-08-31T04:31:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	I thought you said you were using ssh?
2009-08-31T04:32:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	Yes I am : ssh mzimbres@gate...
2009-08-31T04:32:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	so the ssh runs and you are successfully logged in to the target system?
2009-08-31T04:33:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	Yes, exactly
2009-08-31T04:33:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	and what kind of system are you logged into? It's os and version? And do you know what shell it's running?
2009-08-31T04:35:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	FreeBSD, csh
2009-08-31T04:35:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	try typing /bin/ls . Any better?
2009-08-31T04:36:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	I typed sh and got it to work, but there is no bash... I supposed I was in bash...
2009-08-31T04:36:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	so you're all set now?
2009-08-31T04:37:00.000Z	coolcat	losher	Yes, I think I am , thank you
2009-08-31T04:37:00.000Z	losher	coolcat	good
