2009-05-08T17:36:00.000Z	Umaro__		hmmm, in order to handle ntfs partitions I should install ntfs-config but it is not available!
2009-05-08T17:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	What do you mean by handle
2009-05-08T17:39:00.000Z	Umaro__	Jack_Sparrow	I'm trying to use this one
2009-05-08T17:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	Read write is the default
2009-05-08T17:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	Which version of ubuntu
2009-05-08T17:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	lsb_release in a term if you dont know
2009-05-08T17:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	They can get locked to read only by windows
2009-05-08T17:41:00.000Z	Umaro__	Jack_Sparrow	that is what have happened
2009-05-08T17:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	You can clear by going in and out of windows, twice or force mounting it
2009-05-08T17:43:00.000Z	Umaro__	Jack_Sparrow	the problem is that I have no windows installed at the moment. I want to install it on one of my harddrives but first I want to copy everything from it do another drive and then reformat it
2009-05-08T17:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	So what exactly do you need to do
2009-05-08T17:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	Force Mount a Drive  http://forum.notebookreview.com/archive/index.php/t-211958.html
2009-05-08T17:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	You can use the dd command to image that drive or partimage
2009-05-08T17:46:00.000Z	Umaro__	Jack_Sparrow	I tried the mount command but didnt get it to work
2009-05-08T17:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	sudo mkdir /media/locked-drive then sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/locked-drive -o force  substitute your locked drive for sda1
2009-05-08T17:48:00.000Z	Umaro__	Jack_Sparrow	I have a space in the name of the locked drive, cant get it to work with it
2009-05-08T17:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	can't use it in a command, because of the space in it: ctrl+alt+backspace (<---) key twice.. or use tab complete
2009-05-08T17:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Umaro__	Can't use it in a command, because of the space in it: ctrl+alt+backspace (<---) key twice.. or use tab complete        is what I had in my notes
