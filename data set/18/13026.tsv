2006-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	kotatsu	meisam	by default linux supports ELF and a.out... you can add others... anything executable will try to be run, and if you have the approriate software it will run
2006-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	kotatsu	meisam	like you can execute python if you have the python interpreter, .NET if you have mono, .exe if you have wine
