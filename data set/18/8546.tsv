2007-08-06T08:23:00.000Z	Optimus55		I see people having problems with nvidia cards here. when i got ubuntu installed it was okay but once i got the nvidia-glx package all hell broke loose. resolution was stuck at 800x600 etc. It took me two days, an all nighter and a reinstall to fix all problems but i eventually got it all out
2007-08-06T08:23:00.000Z	Optimus55		i would gladly post my xorg.conf for any other nvidia users to see but right now im in xp and cant see the ext3 partition :(
