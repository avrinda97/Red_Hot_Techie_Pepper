2011-01-21T07:14:00.000Z	kannan_		hi guys, i would like some help with configuring my "Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000" with ubuntu 10.10 x86_64.
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		i have two issues: 1. middle button copy/paste does not work in terminal. 2. the scroll button and the side buttons don't work.
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		my xorg.conf settings are the default: Section "InputDevice"
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		    # generated from default
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		    Identifier     "Mouse0"
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		    Driver         "mouse"
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		    Option         "Protocol" "auto"
2011-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	kannan_		    Option         "Device" "/dev/psaux"
2011-01-21T07:17:00.000Z	jetole	kannan_	FloodBot2 is right. Paste it to another site like pastebin.com and then paste the link in here
2011-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	kannan_	jetole	sorry about that. i don't use irc that often and there were only 5 or 6 lines.
2011-01-21T07:19:00.000Z	jetole	kannan_	understood
2011-01-21T07:19:00.000Z	jetole	kannan_	since, well at least 10.04 and maybe even 9.10, ubuntu doesn't create one when you log install it
2011-01-21T07:21:00.000Z	jetole	kannan_	I forgot your original question but try taking a look at the progeam nvidia-settings
2011-01-21T07:21:00.000Z	kannan_	jetole	but that does only monitor settings and i am good. I want to change my mouse settings.
2011-01-21T07:22:00.000Z	jetole	kannan_	ah yeah right. Now I remember
2011-01-21T07:22:00.000Z	jetole	kannan_	I mean I remember your question. Don't remember the mouse specifics but try reading: man xorg.conf
2011-01-21T07:24:00.000Z	kannan_	jetole	is there some howtos about the mouse settings?
2011-01-21T07:24:00.000Z	kannan_	jetole	i use a dual screen with ati at work but it is on CentOS with the default ATI catalyst driver.
