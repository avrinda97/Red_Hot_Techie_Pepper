2007-05-11T13:24:00.000Z	Bidash		since the automatic process didn't do anything, i wanna do the manual process from this site https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows. my question is.. since it's about breezy and i want feisty, can i follow those directiosn except i just replace breezy with feisty in that link they give? (manual process)
2007-05-11T13:26:00.000Z	Bidash		question about netboot (locally): since the automatic process didn't do anything, i wanna do the manual process from this site https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows. my question is.. since it's about breezy and i want feisty, can i follow those directiosn except i just replace breezy with feisty in that link they give?

2007-05-11T13:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Bidash	that looks like its okay - not tested
2007-05-11T13:28:00.000Z	ompaul		it myself
2007-05-11T13:28:00.000Z	Bidash		okay
2007-05-11T13:32:00.000Z	Bidash	ompaul	what do you make of this; the instlux supports breezy but no newer than that. if that is cause of instlux then that doesnt apply to my situation but if that is cause of netbooting then it applies to my situations. i have no idea how to find that out, any ideas?
2007-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	Bidash	ompaul	"my situation" is the one you replied to before
2007-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Bidash	try it
2007-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	Bidash	ompaul	what is the worst that can happen, according to your guess? (my guess is useless)
2007-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Bidash	it fails .. and you learn that it does not work
2007-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	Bidash		haha
2007-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	Bidash		very funny
2007-05-11T13:34:00.000Z	Bidash	ompaul	i mean is there a risk that i cant boot back into windows?
2007-05-11T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Bidash	that will always be a risk - backup backup backup etc - but then I never think about sharing my machine with things other than linux kerenels
2007-05-11T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Bidash	grab the iso and use it
2007-05-11T13:35:00.000Z	Bidash		i cant burn it
2007-05-11T13:36:00.000Z	Bidash		perhaps i need the iso anyway to do this netboot stuff.. not sure.. the ubuntu guide hasnt said anything about it.. i wonder where it's gonna get all the ubuntu content from X)
2007-05-11T13:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Bidash	find someone with a burner and get them to give you a hand - .se is not exactly short of people with computers ;-)
