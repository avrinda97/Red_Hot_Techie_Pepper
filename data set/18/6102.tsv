2010-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	Tao		I've got a problem with my comp/monitor
2010-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	Tao		While the comp will turn on, the monitor remains in what seems to be standby mode
2010-04-26T00:09:00.000Z	Tao		The light on the monitor is yellow and its blinking
2010-04-26T00:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	ok this may be a hardware issue
2010-04-26T00:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	I had recent issues with a oldish monitor myself,  sounds like a hardware issue to me
2010-04-26T00:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	is this before the operating system has loaded up?
2010-04-26T00:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	will it do this if the computer is turned off?
2010-04-26T00:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	uh you were just saying about a monitor issue, now your saying about ethernet?
2010-04-26T00:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	hardware issues are off topic by the way ##hardware would be more appropriate
2010-04-26T00:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	it's ##hardware  and are you registered on Freenode?
2010-04-26T00:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	ok sometimes  it seems that people have to be registered on the network, before they can join certain channels
2010-04-26T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	so maybe ##hardware is registered users only channel, I don't know though
2010-04-26T00:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	what's the problem now?
2010-04-26T00:25:00.000Z	Tao	sebsebseb	Earlier I put my computer on standby, and everything looked to be ok. But I came back a few hours later and attempted to turn my computer on. While the CPU did turn on, the monitor presumably remained in standby mode because the light on it is blinking yellow. I tried disconnecting various things to no avail. I also tried another monitor with similar results
2010-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	uh yes I already suggested going to ##hardware with that, but you  haven't got your name registered yet or something?
2010-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	well patience then
2010-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	ask later even in there
2010-04-26T00:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Tao	or maybe try another channel with your issue such as #ubuntu-offtopic
