2010-04-17T01:44:00.000Z	Cryp71c		which apt package should I use for an apache2 installation with plans to run https and php?
2010-04-17T01:45:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	apache2 php5
2010-04-17T01:47:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	the code I have (and intend to run on this server) references another server on our network, but I can't change the code from "localhost", can I add in host entries to direct localhost requests to that server, would that interfere with anything else/
2010-04-17T01:49:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	iam not correctly understand what you want to achive
2010-04-17T02:29:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	/etc/php5/conf.d/ i think
2010-04-17T02:30:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	the directory is there, its empty though.
2010-04-17T02:31:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	what do you want? conf files of plugins?
2010-04-17T02:31:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	the /etc/ where the .so's are stored so I know what extensions are available presently.
2010-04-17T02:33:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	/etc/php5/conf.d/ surely
2010-04-17T02:34:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	or /usr/lib/php5 ...
2010-04-17T02:35:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	/etc/php5/conf.d/ is only config of plugins
2010-04-17T02:35:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	wierd, I have a 20090626+lfs dir in /usr/lib/php5
2010-04-17T02:36:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	inside it
2010-04-17T02:36:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	yeah, there's a single .so for pdo, but its an odd directory name, was expecting etc/
2010-04-17T02:37:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	directory by Ubuntu, they do some wired things
2010-04-17T02:43:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	can I change that directory and the references to it without breaking the ability to install modules via aptitude?
2010-04-17T02:43:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Cryp71c	i didint done it, so i can not aswer you, but what for?
2010-04-17T02:45:00.000Z	Cryp71c	zaxonspox	its just a terrible directory name, non-standard and such :(
