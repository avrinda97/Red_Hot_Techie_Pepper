2005-07-02T08:42:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	no need to repeat
2005-07-02T08:46:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	you've disabled WPA and WEP on the access point, right?
2005-07-29T13:07:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	why do you want the kernel source?
2005-07-29T13:07:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	yeah
2005-07-29T13:08:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	what are the kernel sources labeled as?
2005-07-29T13:08:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	why do you want them?
2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	it's highly unlikely you need the source for that
2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	its stated sources.... but ill give it  a try real fast right now.... brb
2005-07-29T13:13:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	i guess all i needed was the headers... you were right
2005-07-29T13:21:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	but anyway... where do you install the kernel sources from?
2005-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	you don't, generally
2005-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	it's in the linux-source-* packages, tho
2005-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	its the wrong version listed... its a 2.4 kernel
2005-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	I don't know what you're talking about, ubuntu certainly has the linux-source-2.6 packages
2005-07-29T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	toddmc	yes, it's linux-source, not kernel-source
2005-07-29T13:36:00.000Z	toddmc	bob2	thanks... g'night
