2011-11-18T18:24:00.000Z	ThePendulum		The live disc runs just fine as well, looks great too with Gnome 3, so I feel like ruling out the video card
2011-11-18T18:24:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 i had the same issue with mint 12: live ok, install nok
2011-11-18T18:24:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	Were you able to solve it?
2011-11-18T18:25:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	I basically bricked my entire system, nothing can be installed
2011-12-27T21:31:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 useful link? http://sourceforge.net/projects/nahlwe/
2012-05-24T18:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 repair the grub
2012-05-24T18:20:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	How? And why should it be repaired at all?
2012-05-24T18:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 why? because it is broken
2012-05-24T18:21:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	I installed Ubuntu as the latter
2012-05-24T18:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 still, the link(s) may be useful
2012-05-24T18:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 it's explained in that link
2012-05-24T18:23:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	I´m afraid I don´t see an explaination for it, it´s all using Ubuntu which is not accessible
2012-05-24T18:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 boot from a live cd or thumbdrive, work from there
2012-05-24T18:24:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	Again, Windows won´t let me for whatever reason
2012-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	The Mac Mini G4 is a PowerPC model, so it doesn't have the Intel processor
2012-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	I think ubottu is a bit outdated on the topic. Afaik, Ubuntu 12.04 has a PowerPC release
2012-07-26T16:18:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	ThePendulum	 try lspci|grep VGA (that's in capitals)
2012-07-26T16:19:00.000Z	ThePendulum	MonkeyDust	That'll give me the driver/card name, but not the version. mz|` know right
