2009-05-05T14:01:00.000Z	shadeslayer	michael_	can you change the passworrds?
2009-05-05T14:01:00.000Z	michael_	shadeslayer	i can access the one xp harddrive, from bios i changed the password.. but then there is ANOTHER password (exact same screen, different hard drive (i'm assuming that's the ubuntu one)
2009-05-05T14:02:00.000Z	michael_	shadeslayer	after xp install there was no password, only after ubuntu install
2009-05-05T14:28:00.000Z	shadeslayer	michael_	the partition table got corrupted maybe,i had the same problem,had to make a new table
2009-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	michael_	shadeslayer	i can't even get there.. nothing is showing and no options are clickable
