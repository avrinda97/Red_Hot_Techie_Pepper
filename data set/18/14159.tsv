2005-10-05T15:04:00.000Z	maddler		question: how do I avoid having console messed with log? tried to modify /etc/syslog.conf but nothing changed
2005-10-05T15:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	is ksyslogd startet at boot?
2005-10-05T15:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	klogd*
2005-10-05T15:05:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	yup... but where can I confiure it?
2005-10-05T15:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	It shouldn't need configuring. It should take all log messages by default :/
2005-10-05T15:06:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	damn... it's impossible to work on the console... :|
2005-10-05T15:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	how does your /var/log/messages set for permissions?
2005-10-05T15:08:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	640
2005-10-05T15:08:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	tried stopping *log* but still getting garbage on the console...
2005-10-05T15:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	that would be u+rw-x g+r-xr o-xrw, right?
2005-10-05T15:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	/etc/init.d/klogd restart
2005-10-05T15:09:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	u+rw g+r o-rwx
2005-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	does the kernel logger go down and up ok when you sudo /etc/init.d/klogd restart
2005-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	yes... it stopped and started...
2005-10-05T15:14:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	Very peculiar.
2005-10-05T15:14:00.000Z	BlueEagle	maddler	Does anything get written to /var/log/messages?
2005-10-05T15:16:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	no way... can't stop having garbage...
2005-10-06T16:08:00.000Z	maddler	BlueEagle	looks like thos annoyng log lines come directly from kernel... or at least printks is used...
