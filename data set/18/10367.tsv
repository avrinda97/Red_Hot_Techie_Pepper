2010-06-08T17:04:00.000Z	pythonic		hi, ubuntu suggests extra packages for multimedia (flash, video codecs, etc.). how can i tell which of these are free software?
2010-06-08T17:05:00.000Z	pythonic		does ubuntu install non-free software?
2010-06-08T17:06:00.000Z	pythonic		which of these are non-free?
2010-06-08T17:06:00.000Z	pythonic		"flashplugin-installer" seems to be a smoking gun
2010-06-08T17:07:00.000Z	pythonic		i understand the flash plugin is the non-free plugin from adobe, yes?
2010-06-08T17:09:00.000Z	pythonic		which are flashplugin-installer, libavcodec-unstripped-52, libdvdread4, libk3b6-extracodecs, libmp3lame0, libxine1-ffmpeg
2010-06-08T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	  the repository they are in. is a clue.  'free' means gpl licensing 'free' in most cases. not 'you got to pay $$ for it non free'
2010-06-08T17:12:00.000Z	pythonic	Dr_Willis	i know what Free means, but even some Free Software may not be distributed because of patents, dmca
2010-06-08T17:12:00.000Z	pythonic	Dr_Willis	ubuntu is not clearly making a distinction between Free but patented and Non-Free
2010-06-08T17:13:00.000Z	pythonic	Dr_Willis	i'd like to install Free Software like libdvdcss, but i don't want Non-Free software like adobe flash
2010-06-08T17:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	  I recall some ubuntu variants that focus on doing just that. but i never pay any attention to it.  So cant help much more
2010-06-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	 last i checked the default was  no rules.. thats sensible.
2010-06-08T17:47:00.000Z	pythonic	Dr_Willis	no rules is insane
2010-06-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	 no it is not.
2010-06-08T17:48:00.000Z	pythonic	Dr_Willis	yes it is
2010-06-08T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	 take it to the forums or ubuntu-offtopic then.  if you want to argue the point.
2010-06-08T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	 thats debateable.. elsewhere.
2010-06-08T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pythonic	 whatever.
