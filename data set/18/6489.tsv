2008-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	Supgee		When I boot in Ubuntu, the Ubuntu logo comes up and the orange loading bar goes back and forth for awhile, and then it goes to "BusyBox V1.1.3" and it's just a black screen with white text. How do I actually load the Ubuntu GUI?

2008-05-06T06:34:00.000Z	llamakc	Supgee	when the computer starts up, just after the BIOS POST screen hit the escape key. You'll get the GRUB menu. Arrow down to recovery mode
