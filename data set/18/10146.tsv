2007-01-06T09:35:00.000Z	TimeWaster		help!!!
2007-01-06T09:36:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	hi. What seems to be your issue?
2007-01-06T09:39:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	post your /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old (after loading the drivers that crash X, THEN coming back in vesa).
2007-01-06T09:40:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	also, it would help to know what card you're using. Most likely someone else has hit this issue, and has posted about it somewheres.
2007-01-06T09:42:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	ok, then you'll somehow need to download /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old from your LiveCD onto a floppy or networked computer. Otherwise we really can't help.
2007-01-06T09:42:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	also, the logs'll tell me exactly what card you've got. So, in short, those logs would do the trick.
2007-01-06T09:46:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	does the computer have a floppy drive, and do you have a floppy?
2007-01-06T09:47:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	that should work
2007-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	TimeWaster	javaJake	could you pls prvmsg me? i cant prvmsg you due im not registered
2007-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	javaJake	TimeWaster	boot the LiveCD, let X crash. Then punch Ctrl+Alt+F1. This will give you a terminal. Run "cp /var/log/Xorg.0.* ~/" to save the logs in your home directory. Burn the Xorg logs onto a disc.
