2007-09-29T11:10:00.000Z	wundaboy		i have an ext3 filesystem that comes up with errors every time it boots and i cant figure out how to fix it
2007-09-29T11:10:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	fsck error?
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	wundaboy		yeah
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	if you are taken to a recovery console, then just type fsck and let it run
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	thats it
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	wundaboy	scguy318	i tried ... it ran and fixed some things
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	wundaboy		then it exited
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	wundaboy		i rebooted, errors again
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	dying HDD?
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	wundaboy		it came up with a console again ... i tried fsck and it said that it was dangerous to run fsck on a mounted fs
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	wundaboy	scguy318	i hope its not dying ...
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	was this in recovery mode?
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	wundaboy	scguy318	it told me it was starting a recovery console
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	weird, you can try doing fsck from a LiveCD
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	after sudo umount -a of course
2007-09-29T11:13:00.000Z	wundaboy		hrmm thats an idea, ill try that out
2007-09-29T11:13:00.000Z	wundaboy	scguy318	yeah im not a linux nub ... i just have never had an fs that would not fix itself
2007-09-29T11:15:00.000Z	scguy318	wundaboy	yeah, I suggest backing up, if you're getting fsck issues twice in a row, it may be your HDD
