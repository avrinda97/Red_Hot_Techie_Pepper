2008-10-01T16:55:00.000Z	sledge		from putty
2008-10-01T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	sure, that would work (assuming you've followed the steps on the wiki to install openssh-server on the server)
2008-10-01T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	share the "something"
2008-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	you're connecting to your own computer?
2008-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	with putty?  why not just use 'ssh' in a shell?
2008-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	it's fine.  Just seems strange to me to use putty on linux.  Let's make sure you can actually ssh first.  Did it succeed?
2008-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	sledge	jrib	because my school uses windblows
2008-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	to transfer files you can use a program like winscp
2008-10-01T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	you need to setup your router so you can connect from the outside world though

2008-10-01T17:09:00.000Z	sledge	jrib	correct
2008-10-01T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	sledge	it's timing out
