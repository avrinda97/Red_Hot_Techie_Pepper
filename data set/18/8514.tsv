2007-08-21T15:27:00.000Z	lil-g-man		_ergo_, so now i double click on the freespace or click 'create new partition' yeah on those 20gb
2007-08-21T15:27:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, what's next?
2007-08-21T15:27:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, the type has to be primary?
2007-08-21T15:29:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, now i'm all confused :D
2007-08-21T15:29:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, i've got 20gb free, i'm thinking of having 2gb for swap
2007-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, 3 partitions is like swap, home and ext3?
2007-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo i've got 2gb on laptop
2007-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, so i should make 2000MB, use as swap, primary or logical? and beginning or end?
2007-08-21T15:32:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, crap i need step by step help :)
2007-08-21T15:33:00.000Z	lil-g-man		ergo, do i need boot partition even if i'm thinking about dualboot with vista?
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	kahrytan	lil-g-man	SWAP has to be as big as physical memory. I use twice my memory size.
2007-08-21T15:36:00.000Z	lil-g-man	kahrytan	so swap 2048 since i've got 2gb ram, what do i do with other settings? like primary or logical and beginning or end?
2007-08-21T15:51:00.000Z	lil-g-man	kahrytan	my vista mount point is media/sda1, is it okay that the mount point for ext3 is / ?
2007-08-22T11:49:00.000Z	kahrytan	lil-g-man	Look under mic
2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z	lil-g-man	kahrytan	it's not there
2007-08-22T11:52:00.000Z	kahrytan	lil-g-man	if you got headset, mic is control for the microphone on the headset and regular volume for head phones.
2007-08-22T11:52:00.000Z	kahrytan	lil-g-man	Linux isn't going to treat headset any differently then any other speaker/mic
2007-08-22T11:54:00.000Z	lil-g-man	kahrytan	i get the sound on headphones and on laptop speakers, i can't get the sound only on headphones
