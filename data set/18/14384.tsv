2005-08-08T06:44:00.000Z	neighborlee		how do I adapt my current system so pressing eject button on cdrom drive ejects the media ???
2005-08-08T06:45:00.000Z	f_newton	neighborlee	I dont think there is a script for that
2005-08-08T06:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	do you know if its a project being worked on possibly to add this as a feature ?
2005-08-08T06:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	yeah I know..its so lame ( no offense)..I want to use eject button cause I paid for it LOL
2005-08-10T11:25:00.000Z	f_newton	neighborlee	are you experiencing problems with system operations?
2005-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	yes..I get the weird dektop lockups that others also are seeing  in gnome
2005-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	but not others are seeing it of course..so I guess in my case at least bad ram is indeed a culrprit
2005-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	f_newton	neighborlee	weird lockups in gnome?  have you checked your logs?
2005-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	several times
2005-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	nothing useable or enlightening
2005-08-10T11:28:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	hmm interesting..what log should show me this culprit
2005-08-10T11:30:00.000Z	f_newton	neighborlee	two questions 1.  is this a laptop  2.  is it bargain ram?
2005-08-10T11:30:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	heh
2005-08-10T11:31:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	not laptop..and it is not bargain ram..it is this..rambus stuff that came with my dell dimension 8200 system
2005-08-10T11:31:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	yes
2005-08-10T11:31:00.000Z	neighborlee	f_newton	ONLY from dell faik
2005-08-10T11:32:00.000Z	f_newton	neighborlee	well if worse comes to worse you can buy a new system n send the old one to ME
2005-08-10T11:34:00.000Z	f_newton	neighborlee	is another convert from fedora
