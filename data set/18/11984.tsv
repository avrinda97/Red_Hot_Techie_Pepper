2007-05-16T11:29:00.000Z	Necator		Hi I'm trying to run azureus and it was on for a about 5 minutes and suddenly dissapeared. now when i try to load it hte window comes up and then dies again. any ideas?
2007-05-16T11:30:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	the azu-package is broken (as always). for a quick fix you could try to rename/delete ~/.azureus... on the long run rather d/l from sourceforge and replace the azureus.jar
2007-05-16T11:31:00.000Z	Necator	stefg	thanks i didnt know that. How do i uninstall it ill just use the bittorrent client that was built into ubuntu
2007-05-16T11:31:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	sudo apt-get remove --purge azureus
2007-05-16T11:33:00.000Z	Necator	stefg	whats the purge part do?
2007-05-16T11:33:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	delete remaining config-files think as 'apt-get nuke azureuse' :-)
2007-05-16T11:34:00.000Z	Necator	stefg	will it also work on wine? since that is broken too and i want to try to remove it
2007-05-16T11:35:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	sure... sudo apt-get remove --purge wine ... then delete the (hidden) ~/.wine dir in your home-dir
2007-05-16T11:36:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	that might indicate another problem... actually wine became really neat during the last year
2007-05-16T11:37:00.000Z	Necator	stefg	do you think my java is messed up? and any ideas on this wine problem ? pelo any ideas on this wine problem?
2007-05-16T11:40:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	make sure you have the latest java by 'sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin' then 'sudo update-alternatives --config java' to verify your system is using it
2007-05-16T11:42:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	copy and paste the 2 cammands i gave you to a terminal
2007-05-16T11:43:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	i assume you#re on Feisty, aren't you?
2007-05-16T11:43:00.000Z	Necator	stefg	ya i just installed last night after fixing tons of errors on my computer. I think i broke my bios a little bit too lol. Then i couldnt configure windows for my folks so i was like dammit i wanted linux for a long time let me just install it.
2007-05-16T11:44:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	good approach :-)
2007-05-16T11:44:00.000Z	Necator	stefg	ive wanted to use linux for over a yr but my parents prevented me lol
2007-05-16T11:45:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	telling tehm they are immune to malware might change their minds (Did in my case after a trojan devastated my dad's pc)
2007-05-16T11:47:00.000Z	stefg	Necator	you'll find taht an interesting read
