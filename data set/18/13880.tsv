2005-10-27T15:54:00.000Z	p0windah	StarKruzr	should
2005-10-27T15:54:00.000Z	StarKruzr	p0windah	thanks
2005-10-27T16:01:00.000Z	p0windah	StarKruzr	/etc/init.d/networking restart
2005-10-27T16:02:00.000Z	StarKruzr	p0windah	does that mean that after a shutdown -r now it should have worked too?  because it didn't
2005-10-27T16:02:00.000Z	p0windah	StarKruzr	if it didnt, check the settings of your dhcp server
2005-10-27T16:03:00.000Z	p0windah	StarKruzr	its possible your dhcp server has leased the ip to your mac for X days/hours
