2008-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	Gearsmith		How do I do a reinstall?
2008-01-15T09:01:00.000Z	Gearsmith		I didn't use a disk. I downloaded it when I used to have WIndows.
2008-01-15T09:01:00.000Z	Gearsmith		:-\
2008-01-15T09:02:00.000Z	Gearsmith		Yeah.
2008-01-15T09:03:00.000Z	Gearsmith		Because I messed around in Ubuntu trying to get VirtualBox to work and now I messed up something with my video card I believe. Everything graphics related is running a little slower than before. And whenever I resize any of my windows it interfers with my wobbly windows and the whole system becomes unbearably slow.
2008-01-15T09:04:00.000Z	Gearsmith		And yeah, I did a wubi install the first time.
2008-01-15T09:05:00.000Z	Gearsmith		I just wanna completely reinstall Ubuntu.
2008-01-15T09:05:00.000Z	Gearsmith		I just told you I never booted it from a CD to begin with.
2008-01-15T09:06:00.000Z	Gearsmith		I don't have Windows..
2008-01-15T09:07:00.000Z	Gearsmith		I'm on Ubuntu right now, but I need to reinstall it. Can the ISO fit on a 700 MB CD?
2008-01-15T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	yes
2008-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	just do a reinstall
2008-01-15T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	just like you did an install. Put in the disk, answer the questions
2008-01-15T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	you did a wubi install?
2008-01-15T09:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	oh. And, what does 'used to have windows' mean?
2008-01-15T09:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	you'll need to burn a disk somehow if you want to do a normal install, but no one is really sure what your intent is
2008-01-15T09:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	how are you on line?
2008-01-16T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Gearsmith	it's hidden; if you want to see it right click the menu bar and select edit, it's under accessories as file browser
