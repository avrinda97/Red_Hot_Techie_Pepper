2010-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	benny1		is there a chat room for newbies that aren't geeks who just need some help? lol
2010-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	benny1		wish I could slow this down. I'm in my 60's lol. Very happy to be using open source, just need some help getting firefox to work with reasonable speed again
2010-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	is this a new install?
2010-05-02T23:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	do you have another browser installed that you can compare speed with?
2010-05-02T23:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	there are several possible reasons that it would act slow, one thing you might do is disable ipv6 - a good thing to do no matter what: enter about:config in the address bar, hit enter. click through the warning message and find the following, change yours as needed: network.dns.disableIPv6;true
2010-05-02T23:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	you will have to restart FF for the change to take effect
2010-05-02T23:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	what chat client are you using?
2010-05-02T23:45:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	you might consider opneing up a blank document in gedit, then you can cut and paste items of interese for further review...
2010-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	did you get the ipv6 disabled?

2010-05-02T23:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	look for the entry I posted, about 4 fifths of the way down
2010-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	restart FF
2010-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	That may not entirely solve your issue, but it can't hurt!
2010-05-02T23:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	good :)
2010-05-02T23:50:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	ipv6 is a good thing, but it has been *very* slow to be adopted, so disable for now is best for performance, unless you really need it.
2010-05-02T23:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	there is a google E installer, you'll have to download the binary, and follow the installer instructions.
2010-05-02T23:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	It's still IP, but has been extended to allow for more address space, and for automatic routing config, and so on...you can read up on it on Google...now!
2010-05-02T23:53:00.000Z	greezmunkey	benny1	Despite what *some* folks here say, we do try our best to help...
