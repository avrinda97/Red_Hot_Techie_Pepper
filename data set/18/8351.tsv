2007-09-02T05:35:00.000Z	hopender		Ok i'm using Wine and it makes the programs slightly transparent, How do I get rid of this it is quite annoying in counter-strike
2007-09-02T05:35:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	what window manager are you using?
2007-09-02T05:35:00.000Z	hopender		What do you mean window manager
2007-09-02T05:35:00.000Z	hopender		I have compiz-fusion if thats what you mean
2007-09-02T05:37:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	hmmm. not sure about that one. I know in Beryl you can force set ARGB visuals for it (had that problem with some apps like qemu, wine and SDL apps)
2007-09-02T05:37:00.000Z	hopender	Jowi	Where in beryl did you do that, cause Compiz-Fusion is beryl, beryl was just discontinued
2007-09-02T05:37:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	you should have a similar option in compiz-fusion i guess
2007-09-02T05:38:00.000Z	hopender	Jowi	where was it?
2007-09-02T05:38:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	i need to start up my beryl session to check. can you give me a minute?
2007-09-02T05:38:00.000Z	hopender		sure
2007-09-02T05:38:00.000Z	Jowi		brb
2007-09-02T05:41:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	in Beryl its in "Window Management" -> "Set window attribs by various criteria" -> "Disable ARGB visual" and there I added "c:SDL_App:1" for example.
2007-09-02T05:42:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	use xprop to get the window class needed
2007-09-02T05:43:00.000Z	hopender		I found No Arg Visuals
2007-09-02T05:43:00.000Z	hopender		what do i type in the text box
2007-09-02T05:44:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	never tried compiz-fusion so i can't help there. maybe try in #ubuntu-effects
2007-09-02T05:44:00.000Z	Jowi		!beryl
2007-09-02T05:44:00.000Z	Jowi	hopender	i hope i pushed you in the right direction anyway. gonna switch back to ion3 now :)
