2007-02-06T14:10:00.000Z	KenSentMe	b0c1	maybe it's a good idea to share that error

2007-02-06T14:13:00.000Z	KenSentMe	b0c1	have you got mono-apache-server(2) installed?
2007-02-06T14:13:00.000Z	b0c1	KenSentMe	this is the problem ;)
2007-02-06T14:15:00.000Z	KenSentMe	b0c1	i wouldn't know. Maybe you should ask in general in this channel (so not only ask me), and someone can help you. I don't know how to solve this
2007-02-06T14:16:00.000Z	b0c1	KenSentMe	can you tell me another package which can't decide between two or more package?
2007-02-06T14:16:00.000Z	KenSentMe	b0c1	i wouldn't know any
2007-02-06T14:17:00.000Z	KenSentMe	b0c1	just ask again in this channel, but then with a complete layout of your problem
2007-02-06T14:18:00.000Z	b0c1	KenSentMe	I reported this bug, and it's confirmed, so I wait....
2007-02-06T14:19:00.000Z	b0c1	KenSentMe	I only asked , maybe somebody can another way to solve this...

2007-02-06T14:20:00.000Z	KenSentMe	b0c1	then you have to wait indeed. Have you searched the forums at http://ubuntuforums.org?
2007-02-06T14:20:00.000Z	b0c1	KenSentMe	nope... thnx the idea...
