2008-02-17T23:26:00.000Z	amenado		I use wget
2008-02-17T23:27:00.000Z	amenado		smithw-> you were booting from a liveCD to fix those?
2008-02-17T23:28:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	no. I opened the console, logged on to my account, sudo -s, unmounted the drive and then fsck'ed it.
2008-02-17T23:29:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	I cd'ed to the root first (my /home and / partitions are two different ones). and I fsck'ed with the /home partition unmounted
2008-02-17T23:30:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	console
2008-02-17T23:30:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	ctrl+alt+f1
2008-02-17T23:31:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	it runs and says it's ok. I tried with the -f flag also, but again it just ran the check and said it's got no problems. yet, when I mount it, it still reports 0 blocks free, even if not all blocks are being used.
2008-02-17T23:33:00.000Z	amenado	smithw	after mount /home, can you see any data from it?  you may want to save its contents since you already have access now
2008-02-17T23:34:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	I can see all data, and I also can write to it (I did a simple "touch test.txt; echo "test" >> test.txt;" and it returned no problems). the only thing that seems odd is the reporting of free space...
2008-02-17T23:35:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	yeah, that's the only thing I haven't tried... I just figured that rebooting would be the same as mounting and the unmounting the drive, but who knows what may happen... I'll give it a shot
2008-02-17T23:42:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	rebooting didn't change a thing. df -h still reports Size: 7.4G; Used: 7.0G; Avail 0
2008-02-17T23:43:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	well, thanks... I'll do that then
2008-02-17T23:51:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	which method do you suggest for me to back up the data? I have an HD with an empty ntfs partition that I can reformat to ext3. I assume formating with fdisk and using cp to copy the files would make me lose file permissions, and using dd to simply copy the data from one partition to another would also copy the error...
2008-02-17T23:53:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	I'd like to make this new partition the /home partition after I copy everything, and then merge the flawed current /home with /
2008-02-17T23:54:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	I'd better do this stuff on a livecd, am I right?
2008-02-17T23:55:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	if I can get away with not using a livecd, I'd prefer it, because I don't have any empty CD-R's to burn gutsy, the only livecd I have now is edgy
2008-02-17T23:58:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	ok, I will, thanks.
2008-02-18T00:00:00.000Z	smithw	amenado	will tar -cvf /dev/hdxy copy everything correctly? reading tar's man page gave me that impression, but I can't afford not to be sure
