2010-02-09T08:37:00.000Z	CryptoMole		I have a question about running older versions of ubuntu like edgy eft can you still do it ?
2010-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	you could install them from their ISOs but there wouldn't be updates / repositories for you to add software with... kinda useless really
2010-02-09T08:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	audacious is "almost" the same as xmms was
2010-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	xmms is OLD man
2010-02-09T08:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	oh i used to use it all the time (for years)
2010-02-09T08:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	and i don't like xmms2 at all
2010-02-09T08:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	have you tried bmpx?  i haven't, but its also suppose to be similar accorting to !xmms
2010-02-09T08:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	you have one very specific requirement there!
2010-02-09T08:47:00.000Z	CryptoMole	ZykoticK9	hey xmms did this on its own with all my wav and .flac files
2010-02-09T08:48:00.000Z	CryptoMole	ZykoticK9	thanks for trying to help.
2010-02-09T08:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	i hope you find a suitable alternative
2010-02-09T08:52:00.000Z	CryptoMole	ZykoticK9	hey bpmx only for ubuntu?
2010-02-09T08:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	? no idea -- i doubt it, if it's in ubuntu usually mean i can run on any linux
2010-02-09T08:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	OH YA - that's probably what it is!
2010-02-09T08:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	^ that's where i got it from
2010-02-09T08:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	if you're using Lenny, why are you here?  wouldn't #debian be a better place?
2010-02-09T08:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	i search in ubuntu's repo it isn't here either
2010-02-09T08:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CryptoMole	good luck man - i'm off to watch some TV for a while, hope you find a solution/alternative - or get XMMS going ;)  take care man
