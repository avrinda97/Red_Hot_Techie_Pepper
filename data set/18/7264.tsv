2012-08-06T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	you need the closed source one for raw usb access
2012-08-06T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	can you give a pastebin of:   lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -i | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'      Thanks
2012-08-06T22:44:00.000Z	Paola	ActionParsnip	  No LSB modules are available.
2012-08-06T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	you didn't run what I said but it's good enough
2012-08-06T22:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	can you use a PASTEBIN and give the output of the command I gave please
2012-08-06T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	can you give a pastebin of the output of:  sudo apt-get update
2012-08-06T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	and please don't repeat like that, you asked the same users the same thing. I'm VERY sure they saw the first time
2012-08-06T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	yes
2012-08-06T23:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	it will work, you do realise that Lucid desktop only has 9 months support left...
2012-08-06T23:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paola	it's in the repos, just use sotfware centre as you expect
