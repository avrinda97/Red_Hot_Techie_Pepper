2006-07-10T11:50:00.000Z	cypher1		can i upgrade to dapper from breezy by just using the install/live cd ?
2006-07-10T11:51:00.000Z	gatekeeper	cypher1	have you got broadband connection?
2006-07-10T11:51:00.000Z	cypher1	gatekeeper	yes i do have.. but i do not want to download now
2006-07-10T11:52:00.000Z	cypher1	gatekeeper	i have the install/live cd with me
2006-07-10T11:54:00.000Z	gatekeeper	cypher1	not sure how you would use the liveCD other than a fresh install, you could backup the bits you want, install then do a restore but the easiest way is to install the update-manager and use that
2006-07-10T11:54:00.000Z	cypher1	gatekeeper	thanks
2006-07-10T11:57:00.000Z	gatekeeper	cypher1	*warning* update-manager will download what it needs :-)
2006-07-10T11:57:00.000Z	cypher1	gatekeeper	i want the update to use the cd i have and not to download anything from the internet
2006-07-10T12:01:00.000Z	gatekeeper	cypher1	like I said the only way I know (but others may know different) is to back what is important to you do a fresh install and then restore back the bits you have backed up, e.g. knode folder which holds all the config information
