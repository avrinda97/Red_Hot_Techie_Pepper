2008-11-20T09:47:00.000Z	JohnWittle		So... I'm on a PowerPC computer. I do not want to install linux on this computer. I want to boot off of a Linux PPC LiveCD and use the USB Ubuntu Install tool that is available on the LiveCD, but as far as I can tell the PPC CD is only the installer.
2008-11-20T09:48:00.000Z	JohnWittle		Anyone?
2008-11-20T09:50:00.000Z	JohnWittle		Anyone know how I can boot Ubuntu off of a CD on a PPC processor?
2008-11-20T09:50:00.000Z	raven	JohnWittle	u'd need a PPC version..
2008-11-20T09:51:00.000Z	JohnWittle	raven	Yes, the only PPC iso I could find is install-only, can't actually boot ubuntu off of it.
2008-11-20T09:52:00.000Z	raven	JohnWittle	oic... u could try unetboot to make a bootable USB of the ppc iso
