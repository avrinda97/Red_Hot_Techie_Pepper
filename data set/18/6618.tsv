2009-03-10T03:37:00.000Z	sexcopter		hi, i'm using this laptop (ubuntu) and have a pc with ubuntu on it along with all my music. i reckon i should be able to control the pc using this laptop and ssh to play my music, and have tried ssh -X <ip>. However when I run quodlibet (media player of my choice), it tries to associate with the filesystem on my laptop, not the filesystem on the host pc. Is there a way I can do this? ie dial into the pc and play with the files on *that* pc?
2009-03-10T03:39:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	the music needs to be accesible from where ql is running
2009-03-10T03:41:00.000Z	sexcopter	zash	so if i run ql from an ssh shell i initiated on this laptop, and the host is the pc, where would you say ql is running?
2009-03-10T03:42:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	if you ssh to another computer and run ql there, it runs on the other computre
2009-03-10T03:44:00.000Z	sexcopter	zash	that's what i thought, and it just forwards X to this laptop. so i can't understand why things like "file -> open" lead to the local filesystem on my laptop, and not the filesystem where it is running (on the pc)
2009-03-10T03:44:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	thats weird
2009-03-10T03:44:00.000Z	sexcopter	zash	going to try anothe rprogram
2009-03-10T03:45:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	i know that trying to ssh -X firefox redirects it somehow and runns firefox on your local system
2009-03-10T03:45:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	might be something similar
2009-03-10T03:45:00.000Z	sexcopter	zash	must be the case, because i'm trying vlc and browsing the fs on the pc... wow, that's odd!
2009-03-10T03:46:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	i know that should work, because i did exactly that a while ago
2009-03-10T03:47:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	but now i have my music on a external hdd, and just forward the audio to another computer with pulseaudio
2009-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	sexcopter	zash	pulseaudio can do that? that's neat. doesn't quite fit my situation, but neat nonetheless

2009-03-10T03:49:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	if you just ssh -X theothercomputer, and run quodlibet manualy from there
2009-03-10T03:49:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	what output do you get
2009-03-10T03:49:00.000Z	zash	sexcopter	also, check what processes are runnig on both computers after that
2009-03-10T04:00:00.000Z	sexcopter	zash	sorry, got called away from the laptop for a moment. i have to do dinner now, but i'll look into it some more. thanks for your help!
