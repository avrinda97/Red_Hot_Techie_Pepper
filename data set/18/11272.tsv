2006-08-23T05:38:00.000Z	zyclop	ashik	what kind of files are you trying to play? .mp3 or .ogg ?

2006-08-23T05:41:00.000Z	zyclop	ashik	it seems, that you don't have a plugin for mp3

2006-08-23T05:43:00.000Z	zyclop	ashik	sorry, but wtf are you trying to tell me?
2006-08-23T05:44:00.000Z	ashik	zyclop	I need to know what should I do to have plugin for mp3
2006-08-23T05:45:00.000Z	zyclop	ashik	you'll have to download a package that enables mp3 support. I'm trying to find out wich one at the moment.
2006-08-23T05:46:00.000Z	ashik	zyclop	thanks
2006-08-23T05:48:00.000Z	zyclop	ashik	do you have multiverse enabled?
