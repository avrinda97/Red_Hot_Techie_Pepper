2008-02-27T09:38:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	haven't answered yet...although this is kind of a ubuntu question as well
2008-02-27T09:41:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	I just installed eclipse and it currently wants to use the java-6-sun JRE but i'd like to use Java 5, but I it's not there (i have sun-java5-jdk installed)
2008-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	in the new project window, I can choose Use a project specific JRE, but java 6 is the only option
2008-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	yes, both the jdk and jre
2008-02-27T09:44:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	that's what my professor is going to use to grade it, so I'd prefer it.  Although it seems I've fixed it by pointing Eclipse to it (in /usr/lib/jvm) manually so problem solved
2008-02-27T09:44:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	but thanks for your help
2008-02-27T09:46:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	I don't believe I have
2008-02-27T09:46:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	amenado	I would like to use it to set sun-java5-jdk as the default
