2008-05-07T03:36:00.000Z	Creationist		I just installed Hardy today and am trying to migrate my Firefox2 settings (I removed Firefox 3 because it wasn't compatible with any extensions).  All of my bookmarks show up in the new FF2, but none of my extensions work.  They're listed as being installed, but they aren't usable and I can't uninstall them either.  Anyone know how to fix this?
2008-05-07T03:37:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	you see, firefox 3 evolved from firefox 2, and isn't compatible any more.
2008-05-07T03:43:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	then how do you expect to save your settings?
2008-05-07T03:43:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	all of firefox's user-specific settings are kept in ~/.mozilla
2008-05-07T03:44:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	unless you can recover ~/.mozilla from your trash bin, your settings are not recoverable. follow komputes' instructions on how to get firefox working properly again.
2008-05-07T03:45:00.000Z	Creationist	nubbie_	I don't think you've read what I asked.  I have a backup of ~/.mozilla/
2008-05-07T03:45:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	then purge firefox, reinstall it, and copy ~/.mozilla back to your home directory.
2008-05-07T03:45:00.000Z	Creationist	nubbie_	lol already done all that
2008-05-07T03:46:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	i don't know how you can expect the settings from firefox 3 to be compatible with firefox 2.
2008-05-07T03:46:00.000Z	Creationist	nubbie_	Nevermind... I don't think you've read a thing I've written.  Thanks anyway.
2008-05-07T03:47:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	there are firefox extensions to back up your bookmarks. install the extension in ff3, use the extension, install ff2, install the same extension and backup your bookmarks.
2008-05-07T03:50:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	FF3 plugins will NOT work with FF2.
2008-05-07T03:50:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	that does NOT mean their plugins are compatible between firefox versions.
2008-05-07T03:51:00.000Z	Creationist	nubbie_	For the last time.... that has nothing to do with what I'm asking.  PLEASE either pay attention or stop trying to "help."
2008-05-07T03:52:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	i don't think you're understanding what's being told to you. you say you're trying to get the ~/.mozilla folder you had using FF3 working with FF2, and you're wondering why the plugins aren't working. several people, including myself, are telling you they aren't compatible.
2008-05-07T03:52:00.000Z	Creationist	nubbie_	No.  I'm not trying to get FF3 settings into FF2.
2008-05-07T04:06:00.000Z	nubbie_	Creationist	why not just reinstall all of the plugins manually? ie. delete the contents of the plugins folder within ~/.mozilla and install them one by one from mozilla's site. there isn't much effort involved.
2008-05-07T04:06:00.000Z	Creationist	nubbie_	I have about 20 of them :)
