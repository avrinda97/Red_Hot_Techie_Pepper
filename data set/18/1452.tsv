2011-02-17T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	that is unacceptable to "eff" please stop now
2011-02-20T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	it's owned by root, so only people in the admin group can use sudo to edit it
2011-02-20T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	that's pretty secure
2011-02-20T22:41:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 i am my own admin.. :(
2011-02-20T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	so what's the problem ?
2011-02-20T22:41:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 i need to lock it so that only some temp user or soemthing which i create a random pass on the fly which i wont remember, can edit it
2011-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	why do you want to do that ?
2011-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 i want it so that the only way i can edit it is by rebooting and booting into a live cd and editing the file
2011-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	why do you want that ?
2011-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 to make it less likely for me to proraastinate on reddit and stuff
2011-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	if you change the ownership from root, that is not a good idea
2011-02-20T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	you just need to learn self control to stop editing it
2011-02-20T22:43:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 i know man, i know, but this would help solve this very real problem for me
2011-02-20T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	it would create more problems that it will solve
2011-02-20T22:43:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 even though i could alwasy reedit the file by rebooting, the fact that i have to reboot gets me thinking, and will make me sooo much less likely to do it
2011-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	take yourself out of the admin group
2011-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	derpyderp	ikonia	 mmm, and then how do admin stuff?
2011-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	derpyderp	you need to reboot and enter single user mode
