2007-02-07T10:48:00.000Z	ducky		Finally I got firefox32 installed in Edgy64, but although Flash9 is there where it's supposed to be, it doesn't come up.
2007-02-07T10:50:00.000Z	ducky		Has anyone successfully got firefox32 working on amd64 with flash and such?

2007-02-07T10:51:00.000Z	ducky	m_o_k	Installing from automatix won't try to put it into the firefox64 that's also installed?
