2005-08-10T08:23:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		it doesn't.
2005-08-10T08:24:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		either way
2005-08-10T08:26:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		how do I start daemons?
2005-08-10T08:26:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	for example?
2005-08-10T08:26:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	you have apache installed?
2005-08-10T08:28:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	did you try going to http://localhost in your browser?
2005-08-10T08:29:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	did you try? casuse I think it is...
2005-08-10T08:29:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	hows that work?
2005-08-10T08:33:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	try just sudo apache restart
2005-08-10T08:34:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	alternatively, you dont have t installed. sudo aptitude install apache, or apache2 to install it.
2005-08-10T08:34:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	ha. that does not install servers...
2005-08-10T08:37:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	dont quote me on all this. But, I am fairly sure there are no servers installed. You can always find out if something is installed by the letter that shows up beside a package name when you search for it using": aptitude search package, if there is an i beside the package name, it is installed. a p means you can install it, and a v means it is not a real package.
2005-08-10T08:39:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	I think the diff between a server and a normal install is that a server install does not install a graphical user environment, like gnome, or such.
2005-08-10T08:42:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	hum...I use apache, just cause I use it. If you are not running a business or anything very important, I think there will be little to none difference on which you choose.
2005-08-10T08:48:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will upgrade everything. ALways check your sources.list for non ubuntu repos, even backports before you do that. keep only the official repos when upgrading.
2005-08-10T08:59:00.000Z	dbernar1	spanglesontoast	I dont understand that question.
