2007-04-26T07:27:00.000Z	kenthomson		Namaste!, I am in deep trouble-Here is my question. I had u.6.10 (fully updated) and through update manager two days ago i selected "Upgrade to 7.04", it went on and downloaded all the packages, than maybe in-between all this the system shut-down. I restarted it, and update manager downloading the remaining packages to complete the dist.upgrade, as soon as that was done i started getting debconf popups about setting up new software for feisty,
2007-04-26T07:27:00.000Z	kenthomson		after i setup up some then the terminal in update manager read setting up s/w (unpacking...setting up replacement), so i went out. When i returned i found the computer off, i restarted it and found that ubuntu wouldn't boot, the grub entry still has the 17-11 kernel and when i try to run it, the loading-bar (the one that fills up as ubuntu loads itself) is 1/8 full, and below it reads "mounting root file system" than nothing, a black screen comes
2007-04-26T07:27:00.000Z	kenthomson		and a prompt with "infiarams> " (or somethinhg like that) and a blinking cursor. I can't startx or anything ubuntu hasn't even loaded 1/8 when this strange cursor comes up. Now my system is unbootable for 3 days. Please help!!!
2007-04-26T07:28:00.000Z	kenthomson		Anyone interested in helping me?
2007-04-26T07:28:00.000Z	Parmenion	kenthomson	the best way would be to download fiesty desktop cd and reinstall
2007-04-26T07:29:00.000Z	kenthomson	Parmenion	thats the last thing on my mind, can't i get back my edgy?
2007-04-26T07:29:00.000Z	Parmenion	kenthomson	it seems its stuck permanently between edgy and fiesty.
2007-04-26T07:30:00.000Z	kenthomson	Parmenion	so couldn't i edit some text files from a live-cd or something to get t back to edgy or something
2007-04-26T07:30:00.000Z	Parmenion	kenthomson	the best way would honestly to wipe everything and then install fiesty ... It would be alot of work and I cant walk you through it(lack of experience)
