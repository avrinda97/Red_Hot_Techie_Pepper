2008-06-27T01:00:00.000Z	beli		hey folks, i want to remove evolution, but there are too many dependencies....i dont want to fuxxor my system....
2008-06-27T01:01:00.000Z	unop	beli	you can remove evolution and all the depends. without affecting things too much -- but i have always found it best to let evilution be
2008-06-27T01:02:00.000Z	beli	unop	hmm...i am not using it at all...but all the time updates to it.........that's why i want to drop it
2008-06-27T01:02:00.000Z	beli	unop	i think minimalistic...what i dont need can go to the rubbish bin
2008-06-27T01:03:00.000Z	unop	beli	so go ahead and uninstall evolution -- if any critical depends. are removed, you can always install them again later
2008-10-01T20:25:00.000Z	unop	beli	there is no manpage for cd
2008-10-01T20:25:00.000Z	beli	unop	s/cd/bash/
2008-10-01T20:25:00.000Z	unop	beli	or just.  help cd
2008-10-01T20:26:00.000Z	beli	unop	or...or...or ;)
2008-10-01T20:27:00.000Z	unop	beli	are you alright?
2008-10-01T20:27:00.000Z	beli	unop	sure, why?
2008-10-01T20:27:00.000Z	unop	beli	just behaving quite oddly there .. :)
2008-10-01T20:27:00.000Z	beli	unop	why?
2008-10-01T20:28:00.000Z	unop	beli	never mind - it's trivial.
2008-10-01T20:28:00.000Z	beli	unop	if it's trivial, why are you telling me? ;)
2009-06-18T13:08:00.000Z	beli	unop	i ignored him...i hate it to be flamed while trying to help
2009-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	unop	beli	su works too - atleast it does for me
2009-06-18T13:06:00.000Z	beli	unop	shouldnt on a fresh install...maybe you altered configuration
