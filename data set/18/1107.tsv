2011-05-27T10:01:00.000Z	wflme		unlikely
2011-05-27T10:01:00.000Z	wflme		they wouldn't help me with my rootkit problem
2011-05-27T10:02:00.000Z	wflme		and the issue being?
2011-05-27T10:03:00.000Z	wflme		you know, there's another OS
2011-05-27T10:04:00.000Z	wflme		Windows 7 is robust and stable
2011-05-27T10:05:00.000Z	wflme		why would you even want to play 3d videogames running ubuntu?
2011-05-27T10:05:00.000Z	wflme		girls mostly don't like those running ubuntu. and if they do, you're unlikely to like them.
2011-05-27T10:07:00.000Z	wflme		no sane person would ever want linux for a desktop
2011-05-27T10:08:00.000Z	wflme		fine server, alright. but desktop? come on
2011-05-27T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wflme	that is offtopic here
2011-05-27T10:08:00.000Z	wflme	ActionParsnip	exactly what?
2011-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wflme	do you have a support question?
2011-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	wflme	ActionParsnip	you're dodging the question
2011-05-27T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wflme	by asking if you have a support question? That makes no sense. What is your question?
2011-05-27T10:10:00.000Z	wflme	ActionParsnip	I do indeed
2011-05-27T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wflme	what is it?
2011-05-27T10:11:00.000Z	wflme	ActionParsnip	what rootkit do I install in my test installation with a recent kernel. Preferably a LKM one
2011-05-27T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wflme	ah, not used anything like that, sorry
