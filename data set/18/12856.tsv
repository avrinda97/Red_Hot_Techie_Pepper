2011-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	Jamesuperfun		Anyone need help with anything?
2011-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	Jamesuperfun		Thats NOT getting help?
2011-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	Jamesuperfun		WARNING: I suck with terminal.
2011-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	Jamesuperfun		Now I think of it, I have an issue. Help please?
2011-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	Jamesuperfun		Wireless wont work
2011-01-05T12:11:00.000Z	Jamesuperfun		The prop drivers are in use, but wireless is still 'disabled'.
2011-01-05T12:11:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	which driver are you using?
2011-01-05T12:12:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	hmm ok that's not particularly useful, pastebin (don't paste) your lspci -nnk output
2011-01-05T12:13:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	everyone had to start from somewhere
2011-01-05T12:16:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	have you pasted the `lspci -nnk' output into pastebin?
2011-01-05T12:17:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	hmm hard to diagnose when you're using broadcom's proprietary driver, it might be acpi issue
2011-01-05T12:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	pastebin your `dmesg' output
2011-01-05T12:20:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	you'll need to unload wl first prior to using b43 and to prevent wl from loading you'll need to blacklist it
2011-01-05T12:22:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	for some reason that output of dmesg isn't complete
2011-01-05T12:23:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	I think there's more than that for some reason, do this `sudo aptitude install pastebinit && dmesg| pastebinit -'
2011-01-05T12:25:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	paste me that pastebin link :)
2011-01-05T12:27:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	hmm well I suppose you could try ask again later when you have more time I suppose
2011-01-05T12:29:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Jamesuperfun	wl driver is not the best choice, and the support for that specific chipset via b43 (community derived) is slowly maturing
