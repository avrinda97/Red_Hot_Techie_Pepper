2010-11-19T04:42:00.000Z	Wicked		how do i change system policies?
2010-11-19T04:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	which ones ?
2010-11-19T04:42:00.000Z	Wicked	ikonia	well mainly the shutdown one
2010-11-19T04:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	which one
2010-11-19T04:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	I have no idea what your talking about, any user can shut a box down
2010-11-19T04:43:00.000Z	Wicked	ikonia	this prompts for a password. this laptop is not mine and the user does not want to be prompted for a password every time you log off
2010-11-19T04:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	by default it shouldn't ask him
2010-11-19T04:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	is that user in the "admin" group ?
2010-11-19T04:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	then there is something wrong (not policy based) as it shouldn't prompt him
2010-11-19T04:46:00.000Z	Wicked	ikonia	ive had this happen on several installs. i literally did a default install and updated the system with apt then went to reboot and it failed to let me without entering my password.
2010-11-19T04:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	how are you rebooting ?
2010-11-19T04:46:00.000Z	Wicked	ikonia	from the menus
2010-11-19T04:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	I've never seen it (surprising)
2010-11-19T04:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	it's dead and unsupported
2010-11-19T04:55:00.000Z	Wicked	ikonia	ok so just use the standard flash?
2010-11-19T04:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	that's what most do
2010-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	it does it all for you
2010-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Wicked	just install the package flashplugin-nonfree
