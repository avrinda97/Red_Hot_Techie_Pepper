2006-02-22T10:03:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk		small question... I have a brandnew server here with a 12 port 3ware 9550SX, containing about 5TB of HDD space... any chance I can use about 20GB for Ubuntu and the other 4.980TB for data (as one partion)?
2006-02-22T10:04:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	i think so, had problems with the fs?
2006-02-22T10:05:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	not yet... but the array seems to be divided into sda / sdb / sdc, although I did not configure this in the bios...
2006-02-22T10:06:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	it doesnt seem to see the raid config right?
2006-02-22T10:06:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	so I figured this must have something to do with partition size limitations or something
2006-02-22T10:07:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	It does... although I needed dapper flight 3 to make the 3ware 9550 work
2006-02-22T10:08:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	then you should have no problems, if it doesnt work with fdisk you should google about linux with big diskspaces, havnt got a 4tb box laing around here to try ;)
2006-02-22T10:08:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	no time huh... I know the feeling :)
2006-02-22T10:09:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	lol more like no money :p
2006-02-22T10:09:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	errr... just missed the N in havnt :p
2006-02-22T10:10:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	ohwell... I'll try google then. Thanks anyway :)
2006-02-22T10:30:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	think I found the problem...
2006-02-22T10:30:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	3ware has this nice little option in it's bios called '2TB autocarving'
2006-02-22T10:31:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	lol ok thats nice... :S
2006-02-22T10:32:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	so its a bios thinh?
2006-02-22T10:32:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk	ablomen	Think so... I turned it off, now I have to rebuild the entire(!) array :s
2006-02-22T10:33:00.000Z	ablomen	iGad_bigdisk	well good luck, hope it works
