2005-06-09T12:52:00.000Z	danb		I'm frankly stunned that no-one here knows how to get a flash drive working properly :(
2005-06-09T12:53:00.000Z	danb		human: mine did too, SOMETIMES. Now I can't write jack
2005-06-09T12:53:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	when you say you can't write, do you mean you copy stuff to the drive, take it to another machine, and it's not there?
2005-06-09T12:53:00.000Z	danb		human: could you look to see what it says about sda in yr mtab/fstab please?
2005-06-09T12:54:00.000Z	danb	pestilence	I've had it working a few times, copying/deleting files off it under KDE, but most of the time I can mount/read OK but not delete/write
2005-06-09T12:55:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	is it mounted read-only?
2005-06-09T12:55:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	what kind of filesystem does it carry?
2005-06-09T12:55:00.000Z	danb		pest: vfat
2005-06-09T12:56:00.000Z	danb		pest: I deleted the mtab/fstan entrys for it, but then mtab adds one when I plug it in but as ro
2005-06-09T12:57:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	so remount it as rw...
2005-06-09T12:57:00.000Z	danb		IIIears: As I say, I've had it working under Linux but I want it setup so I can plug it in a guarantee it'll be rw, not ro and rw sometimes
2005-06-09T12:58:00.000Z	danb		pest: How can I make sda ALWAYS be mounted rw?
2005-06-09T12:58:00.000Z	danb		.. whatever I need to do here..
2005-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	well, you can mount it yourself.  that would guarantee it.
2005-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	as far as having hal mount it automatically rw, i'm not sure.  you probably have to edit the hal configuration files
2005-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	danb		pest: thats crap though,, I want to click on it and have it mounted rw. I've seen this work ya know! :)
2005-06-09T13:00:00.000Z	danb		pest: aha! Hal config files! That might be the one
2005-06-09T13:01:00.000Z	pestilence	danb	you can explore the devices that hal knows about by using hal-device-manager
