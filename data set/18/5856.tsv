2009-11-23T09:12:00.000Z	keppi		xubuntu comes with different packages
2009-11-23T09:14:00.000Z	sdk	keppi	- is xubuntu more light-weight in terms of default packages?
2009-11-23T09:15:00.000Z	sdk		Keppi - the website isn't very explanatory
2009-11-23T09:15:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 yes it's pretty snappy and lightweight.  I run it on my slower pc's
2009-11-23T09:16:00.000Z	sdk		keppy - do you like thunar? How does it compare?
2009-11-23T09:17:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 works just fine for me.  Accessing network resources through it is a bit tricky though
2009-11-23T09:17:00.000Z	sdk	keppi	- can I pretty much install any regular deb packages in xubuntu without issues? I'm somewhat new to linux, and I'm looking for a pretty simple desktop environment. I like gnome, but I was thinking about trying xfce
2009-11-23T09:17:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 yes, you can get them off synpatic as well
2009-11-23T09:18:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 gnome is a pig compared to xfce
2009-11-23T09:18:00.000Z	sdk	keppi	- what do you think of xfburn? have you used it? Or Ristretto (the image viewer)?
2009-11-23T09:19:00.000Z	sdk		Keppi - [sorry] what do you mean by pig?
2009-11-23T09:19:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 I haven't burned anything with linux yet.
2009-11-23T09:20:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 gnome uses a lot more resources, and is slow vs xfce it runs slower on older boxes
2009-11-23T09:20:00.000Z	sdk	keppi	- I like speed, but what's the trade off?
2009-11-23T09:20:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 one of my xfce boxes runs as a live music streamer and the other runs as an internet kiosk
2009-11-23T09:21:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 tradeoff depends on what you require out of the system.  I don't really see any downsides to it.  Tends to be updated less often then gnome.
2009-11-23T09:24:00.000Z	sdk	keppi	- thanks / ardchoille - thanks
2009-11-23T09:24:00.000Z	keppi	sdk	 no problem
