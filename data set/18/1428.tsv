2011-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	ray_		I wanted to learn how to remove ubuntu from a hard drive that has 2 versions of ubuntu installed on it. So I decided to try it out and learn how to do it. How is it done?
2011-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	ray_		I have no worry of losing data, as all my info is backed up
2011-02-22T16:02:00.000Z	ray_		What's the name of the folder?
2011-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	ray_		I know some commands that can help him out maybe
2011-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	ray_		sudo chown -R username /the/path/to/thefolder  sudo chgrp -R username /the/path/to/thefolder   sudo chgrp -R username /the/path/to/thefolder  find /the/path/to/thefolder -type f -exec chmod 640 \{} \; find /the/path/to/thefolder -type d -exec chmod 750 \{} \;
2011-02-22T16:05:00.000Z	ray_		oops sorry
2011-02-22T16:05:00.000Z	ray_		I will be back
2011-02-22T16:05:00.000Z	ray_		http://paste.ubuntu.com/570515/
2011-02-22T16:07:00.000Z	ray_		ha ha, ya, I was pasting from a text file I haven't used in a little
2011-02-22T16:07:00.000Z	ray_		I modified it first though
2011-02-22T16:08:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	I'm not sure what you are atempting to do, but can't you just use gparted and reformat the disk that has the now uneeded install of ubuntu?
2011-02-22T16:13:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	well for one I would need to see like sudo fdisk -l ; to get an idea of the locations of each;  then just to delete all in the root of the disk should be as easy as sudo rm -r /path/to/delete/
2011-02-22T16:22:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	well to format a disk I think it can't be mounted
2011-02-22T16:23:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	there are also other ways to test ideas like this by doing them in a virtualbox so you don't damage a working system
2011-02-22T16:24:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	 to see what you are now using you can see with the command mount  that will show what drives are mounted to what directory
2011-02-22T16:26:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	virtualbox is cool you can play with toys you don't even have yet,  like raid systems that need 6 hard disk to try,  even though you don't have the disks yet you can setup a virtual system to test it
2011-02-22T16:28:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	you should take a look at gparted,  it will display what is mounted and the size of each partition and enable you to format if needed
2011-02-22T16:30:00.000Z	sacarlson1	ray_	it was default installed but maybe needs install in later versions,  there is also a disk utility that might have replaced it
