2011-04-30T04:43:00.000Z	Kibo		Good night guys. Maybe someone could help me? I might have rebooted my system before the upgrade to 11.04 was over (the login screen was showing "reboot needed" or something to that effect). Now the box won't boot, and the kernel/dist is not showing on GRUB screen. Can I salvage it with a 10.10 live (USB)?
2011-04-30T04:43:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	So, is it at the place where it shows grub> ?
2011-04-30T04:47:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	Sorry, no. The actual boot screen (to select the kernel version)
2011-04-30T04:48:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	Ahh okay, I see what you mean now.
2011-04-30T04:49:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	Sorry for the poor explaining. :-)
2011-04-30T04:51:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	Do you know if I CHROOT to the partition and do a dist-upgrade would work?
2011-04-30T04:52:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	hmm, I'm not sure... I never had that problem, so yeah :/ today, I had a different problem where grub2 wouldn't recognize my kernel :/
2011-04-30T04:53:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	Well, I think the worse it could do is finish destroying the install... Not too different of the current situation... :-)
2011-04-30T04:53:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	Alright lol
2011-04-30T04:54:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	I'll keep you posted... ;-)
2011-04-30T05:04:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	Just an update... Tried the apt-get dist-upgrade, the machine complained and asked for a "dpkg --configure -a". It's still running, I think it's finishing the upgrade... Still hopeful... ;-)
2011-04-30T05:04:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	yeah it must be, so when that finishes it should work :)
2011-04-30T05:04:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	I hope so!! lol
2011-04-30T05:05:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	Good luck dude! :P
2011-04-30T05:05:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	Thanks a bunch, man! ;)
2011-04-30T05:05:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	np
2011-04-30T06:54:00.000Z	Kibo	Kevin147	It was a LOT of work and wait, but it worked. Natty Narwhal is running... ;) Thanks again!
2011-04-30T06:55:00.000Z	Kevin147	Kibo	Sweet!! Glad its working! np :)
