2005-03-01T08:21:00.000Z	robertj	thoreauputic	haha, I wish it was, it's bad
2005-03-01T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	well, fink and darwin are kind of tricky ;)
2005-03-01T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	the file system is weird
2005-03-01T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	agreed - it's bsd underneath, but it's well hidden
2005-03-11T07:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	yes, I can
2005-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	hmm .. let me try
2005-03-11T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	hmm - interesting - I can't get that to work
2005-03-11T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	but it has other options - maybe I chose a bad option
2005-03-11T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	I just noticed - using the connect to server I get an icon on the desktop: clicking it asks for my ftp password
2005-03-11T07:21:00.000Z	robertj	thoreauputic	but does it work?
2005-03-11T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	yes - Iget a nautilus window on my website's ftp
2005-03-11T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	appears to work fine
2005-08-08T06:34:00.000Z	robertj	thoreauputic	I almost always end up having mine in /var/somewhere as well
2005-08-08T06:50:00.000Z	robertj	thoreauputic	fine, but that's a whole extra keypress I hope you know
2005-08-08T06:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	heheh - I *do* hope you don't get carpal tunnel syndrome ;)
2005-08-08T06:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	robertj	it isn't slow on *my* mac either ;)
2005-08-08T06:56:00.000Z	robertj	thoreauputic	that second gig of ram really kinda made sure it stays snappy
2005-08-08T06:56:00.000Z	robertj	thoreauputic	although VirtualPC is still not as fast as a decent P2
