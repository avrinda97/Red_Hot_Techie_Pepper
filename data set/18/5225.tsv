2008-11-27T14:29:00.000Z	toastedmilk		So, even after checking linuxselfhelp.com, linuxmint.com's wiki, and ubuntu's grubhowto, I'm still having grub issues with Error 22 and command-line grub issues with Error 27! Help!!
2008-11-27T14:31:00.000Z	toastedmilk		I need help with repairing grub.  I'm receiving Error 22 and in the command line on a live cd I'm receiving Error 27. Can someone help?

2008-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	maybe the command for selecting the root partition is wrong. when the boot loader comes up, select your ubuntu and press "e" (edit)... tell me, what the line similar to hd(1,0) says
2008-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	the boot loader on the live cd?
2008-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	wait a sec. your live cd wont boot either?
2008-11-27T14:36:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	no, I'm booted on it
2008-11-27T14:36:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	just making sure that's what you were asking
2008-11-27T14:36:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	how does the error 27 come up?
2008-11-27T14:36:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	setup (hd0)
2008-11-27T14:36:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	your drive might just not be hd0
2008-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	I'm gonna check my BIOS
2008-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	the numbering might change, especially if you change your hardware or the bios boot order
2008-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	I just deleted a partition
2008-11-27T14:38:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	thats not the case, i meant. shouldnt matter. of course, only if you didnt delete your ubuntu
2008-11-27T14:38:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	An extra partition of ubuntu that I used to re-mount my hdd
2008-11-27T14:38:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hmw_pidgin	nope.  I'm restarting now. cross your fingers
2008-11-27T14:39:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	toastedmilk	as i understood, you cant put grub to your hard drive anymore. boot from hd and try hd(0,...) instead of hd(1,...) or vice versa (error 22)
