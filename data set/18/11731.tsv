2006-06-19T13:19:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	how is it easier? can you explain that to me?
2006-06-19T13:19:00.000Z	mada		later magic
2006-06-19T13:20:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	how is ubuntu easier?
2006-06-19T13:20:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	yes
2006-06-19T13:20:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	I've tried debia, mandriva, red hat, dsl
2006-06-19T13:21:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	the entire install can be done from a graphical livecd and you don't even have to know what the bash shell is to make the entire OS fully functional and it auto checks for updates ... i just find all of that convenient for a desktop
2006-06-19T13:21:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	my dual opteron server runs debian and always will, but for my desktop ... ubuntu is just more convenient
2006-06-19T13:22:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	is there anything else? I mean the directory structure or something ?
2006-06-19T13:22:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	it just seems like I could set up any linuz to do that. I don't see the advantage (I'm new to linux, and I'm a programmer)
2006-06-19T13:22:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	naw, directory struture is pretty standard and almost mirror image to debian, so its just firmiliar to me
2006-06-19T13:23:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	well then download and try to install and manage slackware or gentoo during daily use and with doing updates and you will understand where i am coming from
2006-06-19T13:23:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	i am a programmer :)
2006-06-19T13:24:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	are the differences between distros don't seem very different to me. Just programs that come with it are different, or the package management is different
2006-06-19T13:24:00.000Z	ZDUX	mada	sorry I had a brain fart half way though the sentence
2006-06-19T13:25:00.000Z	ZDUX		I like apt-get
2006-06-19T13:25:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	yup, thats pretty much the only difference, different people feel more comfortable with apt, some with yum, others with emerge ... so those will use what they like
2006-06-19T13:25:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	no prob
2006-06-19T13:26:00.000Z	mada	ZDUX	the reason there are so many distros are what comes standard with different ones might cater to one user but not to another, along with the package management and even things like dsl for older machines ... each distro is still linux, but is just specifically different to the user it tries to cater to
