2007-01-18T15:33:00.000Z	z0rz		Is there a way to make an SSH tunnel from Computer A to Computer B via Computer C?
2007-01-18T15:34:00.000Z	z0rz		Why?
2007-01-18T15:35:00.000Z	z0rz		Ok is it possible to have Computer A and Computer B connect to Computer C via two seperate SSH tunnels and then be able to transfer data back and forth using Comptuer C?
2007-01-18T15:35:00.000Z	z0rz		LIES!

2007-01-18T15:35:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	can you be more specific ?
2007-01-18T15:38:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	all you need to do is set up sshd forward on your computer. then connect to it. "sshd -L" is your friend.
2007-01-18T15:38:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	your school does allow "-L" ?
2007-01-18T15:38:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	i.e., outbound. not inbound
2007-01-18T15:39:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	then it should be cool.
2007-01-18T15:40:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	forward from one host to another. man ssh and then look for "-L". it's best explained there.
2007-01-18T15:41:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	if your school machine drops all outbound to certain port then you are doomed.
2007-01-18T15:41:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	what's the use ?
2007-01-18T15:42:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	man ssh.
2007-01-18T15:42:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	go read
2007-01-18T15:42:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	read again
2007-01-18T15:42:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	look for "-L"
2007-01-18T15:43:00.000Z	vustar	z0rz	fuck off you n00b
