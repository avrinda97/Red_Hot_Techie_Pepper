2007-05-14T10:56:00.000Z	duffyd		hi, I think this may just be a general ubuntu issue but I can't seem to get my internet browsers to recognise any host entries I put in my /etc/hosts file - anyone having a similar issue?
2007-05-14T10:56:00.000Z	duffyd		if I ping the host addresses they work fine but in the browser it doesn't recognise the changes
2007-05-14T10:57:00.000Z	justin_	duffyd	does dns resolve when you ping google.com ?
2007-05-14T10:57:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	yes
2007-05-14T10:57:00.000Z	justin_	duffyd	mmm
2007-05-14T10:58:00.000Z	justin_	duffyd	sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser
2007-05-14T11:00:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	exactly the same issue
2007-05-14T11:00:00.000Z	justin_	duffyd	so it wont go to the webby from the browser but it will resolve via terminal?
2007-05-14T11:01:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	I did see a thread here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=317242 that spoke about some ipv6 issues with the /etc/hosts file
2007-05-14T11:01:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	I tried them but no dice
2007-05-14T11:02:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	just so you've got a context for this - I'm a web dev and I've got a dev site setup on another ip address and for some reason none of my browsers are recognising this address assignment in /etc/hosts
2007-05-14T11:03:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	yup
2007-05-14T11:03:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	I was under the understanding that I could just override dns by specifying an ip address in /etc/hosts
2007-05-14T11:03:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	ok
2007-05-14T11:05:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	http://pastebin.us/35468
2007-05-14T11:06:00.000Z	justin_	duffyd	its a lot easier than we thought
2007-05-14T11:06:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	oh cool
2007-05-14T11:07:00.000Z	duffyd	justin_	ok
