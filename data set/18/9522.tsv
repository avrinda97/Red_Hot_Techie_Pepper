2007-03-31T07:00:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: so you get no gnome apps?
2007-03-31T07:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	You can use gnome apps in gnome, kde, window maker, blackbox, etc.
2007-03-31T07:01:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: yes but to have the gnome apps on your comp it is easy to assume you've installed gnome, do you install each app independently?
2007-03-31T07:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	Ah, no, I installed Ubuntu and then installed wmaker for use. I use gnome apps in wmaker.
2007-03-31T07:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	so I have all the gnome stuff too
2007-03-31T07:02:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: so you get the hundreds of gnome apps with wm? i'm confused
2007-03-31T07:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	the window manager just manages windows, you can run gnome apps in any window manager, and I think you can run any kde app in any window manager.
2007-03-31T07:03:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: i know that, but do you install all the gnome apps independently (one by one)
2007-03-31T07:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	No, I installed Ubuntu, that uses gnome by default, then I installed and use wmaker. So, I had all the gnome stuff already when I installed Ubuntu
2007-03-31T07:08:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: i had to step away, are we still talking about wm's?
2007-03-31T07:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	Sure
2007-03-31T07:09:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: ok my point earlier was that you still have gnome, you just change it at the session manager no?
2007-03-31T07:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	Right
2007-03-31T07:10:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: ok
2007-03-31T08:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	Wow, fluxconf is even in the repos, nice
2007-03-31T12:04:00.000Z	ant-	ardchoille	: we've been telling him to do that all day long
2007-03-31T12:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	Ah, good point.
2007-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	ant-	Good point
