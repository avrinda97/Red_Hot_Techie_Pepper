2005-08-11T07:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	i don't have an XF86Config-4 -- only xorg.conf
2005-08-11T07:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	i think you'll only have the XF86* file if you upgraded from warty to hoary
2005-08-11T07:52:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	hmmm. i have a clean hoary
2005-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	any ideas where it came from? try maybe 'dpkg -S XF86Config-4' (or XF86config-4, whatever the name is)
2005-08-11T07:56:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	i think XF86config-4 appeared after i install ATI drivers for 9200
2005-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	ah. maybe use the ATI driver packaged by ubuntu instead
2005-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	i think you can find info here: (ubotu will say more)
2005-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	alright ill try uninstlling ati ,reset xserver and install ubuntu ati drivers
2005-08-11T08:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	you can try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' to get a more-or-less working xorg.conf (without accelerated ati drivers)
2005-08-11T08:02:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	that was what i was meaning
2005-08-11T08:06:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	do i need to manually remove all ATI files manually first, before i install ubuntu ATI drivers ?
2005-08-11T08:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	i'm not sure; it's probably best to do so
2005-08-11T08:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	does the driver not have an 'uninstall' option?
2005-08-11T08:07:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	no
2005-08-11T08:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	i believe the nvidia provided .sh or .run file has uninstall; i'm not familiar with ati's driver
2005-08-12T14:07:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	ubuntu will keep the other oses, i tried
2005-08-12T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	equex	ok, thanks for the confirmation
2005-08-12T14:08:00.000Z	equex	HappyFool	the other way is probably different :D
