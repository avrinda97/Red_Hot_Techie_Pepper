2005-10-26T06:18:00.000Z	ScatterBrain		help.  I have a machine that will not do a an apt-get upgrade.
2005-10-26T06:18:00.000Z	ScatterBrain		It simpley stops when trying to install openssh-client.
2005-10-26T06:19:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	questions like that need to be accompanied by the full apt error, /etc/apt/sources.list and a description of what you're trying to do
2005-10-26T06:19:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	I'm using the hoary repos nothing unofficial.
2005-10-26T06:20:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	/etc/apt/sources.list, the error -> #flood
2005-10-26T06:20:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	hold on.
2005-10-26T06:22:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	it's over there.
2005-10-26T06:23:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	where "stops" = ?
2005-10-26T06:23:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	look in #flood.
2005-10-26T06:23:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	where you didn't elaborate on it either
2005-10-26T06:25:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	btw, I'm chrooted into the box via Knoppix at the moment.
2005-10-26T06:25:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	I still have no idea what you're talking about
2005-10-26T06:25:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	"blank line" is not a useful description
2005-10-26T06:26:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	no. errors no further information.  apt simply hangs there.
2005-10-26T06:26:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	sorry for not being very descriptive.
2005-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	I can cancel out of apt, with a <ctrl>-C, but nothing happens.
2005-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	bob2	ScatterBrain	nothing happens = ?
2005-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	bob2	no apt-hangs.
