2008-05-26T22:41:00.000Z	shishirmk		hey has any1 used lynx in here?
2008-05-26T22:41:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	yes
2008-05-26T22:42:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	command line web when I'm recovering a system mostly
2008-05-26T22:42:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	that plus wget are indespensable with a system goes wonky
2008-05-26T22:44:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	someone above here just showed you how to do that
2008-05-26T22:45:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	are you wanting to download something or browse something?
2008-05-26T22:46:00.000Z	shishirmk	zaphar_ps	actually do neither. I just want to make this HTTP get request. The PHP script sitting there will take these parameters and add it to a database
2008-05-26T22:47:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	use wget then lynx is overkill for that
2008-05-26T22:47:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	wget <url>
2008-05-26T22:48:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	how do you know it didn't work?
2008-05-26T22:48:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	did it return an error?
2008-05-26T22:48:00.000Z	shishirmk	zaphar_ps	things werent there in that database
2008-05-26T22:49:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	wget should have downloaded a file for you
2008-05-26T22:49:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	look inside the file and see what the webserver returned
2008-05-26T22:50:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	that will tell you what errors the webserver might have returned
2008-05-26T22:51:00.000Z	shishirmk	zaphar_ps	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/14845/
2008-05-26T22:52:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	enclose url in quotes after wget
2008-05-26T22:56:00.000Z	zaphar_ps	shishirmk	did that work?
