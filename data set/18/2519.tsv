2010-05-04T23:06:00.000Z	plutonium45		I have even deleted .deb file in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2010-05-04T23:07:00.000Z	Slart	plutonium45	the deb file is just kept as some kind of backup copy.. it isn't used when the system is running
2010-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	Slart	plutonium45	have you tried using another repository? in case that package is broken in yours??
2010-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	plutonium45	Slart	I installed that font by downloading the .deb file from ubuntu

2010-05-04T23:10:00.000Z	plutonium45	Slart	yes its ttf-sil-gentium
2010-05-04T23:10:00.000Z	Slart	plutonium45	hang on.. let me try to install that on my machine.. see if something breaks

2010-05-04T23:11:00.000Z	Slart	plutonium45	ok.. let me start up my laptop then.. I haven't updated my desktop yet
2010-05-04T23:15:00.000Z	Slart	plutonium45	hmm.. no problem installing and removing that package
