2007-07-30T12:45:00.000Z	kalusn		have anyone tried intels powerTOP in gutsy? can you tell how its working?
2007-07-30T12:45:00.000Z	kalusn		get deluge
2007-07-30T12:46:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	were you talkin to me?
2007-07-30T12:47:00.000Z	kalusn	_imran_	hmm.. yeah, but I wouldn't listen to my advice, since it's pretty ignorant
2007-07-30T12:48:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	ok...do you have any other suggestions?
2007-07-30T12:48:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	ok, it connected to 1 seed
2007-07-30T12:49:00.000Z	kalusn	_imran_	does torrent sharing work well with other bittorrent programs on your computer?
2007-07-30T12:49:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	well, it works well on windows
2007-07-30T12:49:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	now 1 seed, 3 peers
2007-07-30T12:50:00.000Z	kalusn	_imran_	I think azureus is working just fine then... just a wee bit slow
2007-07-30T12:50:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	do you know how to set a file so that it doesnt seed when it is done downloading?
2007-07-30T12:51:00.000Z	kalusn	_imran_	not in azureus, since im using deluge
2007-07-30T12:51:00.000Z	_imran_		kalus
2007-07-30T12:51:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	ok
2007-07-30T12:53:00.000Z	kalusn	_imran_	In deluge though, you can set it too stop seeding when you reach a certain share ratio... I really recommend that you try and use deluge. It's very well integrated into gnome
2007-07-30T12:53:00.000Z	kalusn		and a good torrent manager
2007-07-30T12:53:00.000Z	_imran_		does anyone know how to set a .torrent file not to seed when it is done downloading in azureus
2007-07-30T12:54:00.000Z	_imran_	kalusn	i'll try tomorrow
