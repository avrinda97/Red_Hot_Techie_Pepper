2012-01-12T08:46:00.000Z	LinuxRules	hass	you set /dev/shm read only
2012-01-12T08:47:00.000Z	LinuxRules		?
2012-01-12T08:47:00.000Z	hass	LinuxRules	you mean to fix chrome?
2012-01-12T08:48:00.000Z	hass		[3885:3894:754175093:FATAL:base/shared_memory_posix.cc(193)] Creating shared memory in /dev/shm/com.google.chrome.7BVJNT failed. This is frequently caused by incorrect permissions on /dev/shm.  Try 'sudo chmod 777 /dev/shm' to fix.: No such file or directory
2012-01-12T08:48:00.000Z	hass		Aborted
2012-01-12T08:48:00.000Z	LinuxRules	hass	meant to say is your shared memory read only? (/dev/shm/) thats one thing that makes chrome fail but it wont be read only unless you modified fstab
2012-01-12T08:48:00.000Z	hass		makes sense now
2012-01-12T08:48:00.000Z	hass		i'll try chmod
2012-01-12T08:49:00.000Z	LinuxRules		chmod wont fix
2012-01-12T08:50:00.000Z	LinuxRules		mount -o remount/rw /dev/shm might
2012-01-12T08:50:00.000Z	hass	LinuxRules	I changed the permissions and Chrome opened
2012-01-12T08:50:00.000Z	LinuxRules	hass	cool
2012-01-12T08:51:00.000Z	hass	LinuxRules	I do have a modified fstab file.  Will this happen again if I restart?
2012-01-12T08:51:00.000Z	LinuxRules	hass	what did you change it to though , nothing like 777?
