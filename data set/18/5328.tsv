2008-11-10T03:30:00.000Z	Bowtrik		Anyone know how to fix my Ubuntu theme problem? :( It keeps going back to default on logouts or reboots.
2008-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	how are you adding the theme
2008-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	The theme I am using I added with Synaptic Package Manager. It is a normal Ubuntu Theme.
2008-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	how are you applying the theme?
2008-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	Through the System>Appearance dialogs.
2008-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	Pardon me System>Preferences>Appearance
2008-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	Did you have any ideas on that? Or maybe any luck googling? I personally couldn't find a fix, but I didn't search THAT hard I guess.
2008-11-10T03:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	whats the issue?
2008-11-10T03:39:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	My Ubuntu theme. Keeps going back to default.
2008-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	if you are launching stuff with sudo / gsudo it wont stick
2008-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	you could make sure you have write access to the theme files
2008-11-10T03:41:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	How would I go about doing that?
2008-11-10T03:41:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	That was another thing I was wondering about, because one of the themes I did install, I can't delete. But the theme I want to keep, won't stay.
2008-11-10T03:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	its hard to have to leaf through so much text without highlighting
2008-11-10T03:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	especially when it gets fast
2008-11-10T03:45:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	I was just being sarcastic. Hehe.
2008-11-10T03:59:00.000Z	Bowtrik	ActionParsnip	Still there? I have an update on my theme issue. I tried a different theme, and rebooted gnome, and it stayed. Is there perhaps something simply wrong with the theme I chose?
2008-11-10T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bowtrik	very possible
