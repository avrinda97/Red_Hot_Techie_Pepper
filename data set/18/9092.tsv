2011-03-06T16:08:00.000Z	thevishy		what software do I use to create a USB that can install bu netbook ubuntu version ?
2011-03-06T16:10:00.000Z	thevishy		folks any idea on how to burn an iso to a USB Flash drive so that it can install the OS for me like  DVD does
2011-03-06T16:11:00.000Z	thevishy		the links say usb creator software basically but what I found to download was live usb creator wonder if they are same
2011-03-06T16:11:00.000Z	thevishy		Live word is a bit confusing as I dont want a CD based OS ...
2011-03-06T16:12:00.000Z	thevishy		what is the size suggested for Linux including Swap for 1 GB netbook with 160 GB hdd
2011-03-06T16:13:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	I generally suggest between ram +0.5GB to 2x ram.
2011-03-06T16:14:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	I'd suggest 2gb; you have the disk space to spare.
2011-03-06T16:18:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	don't think so, and few people are suggesting unetbootin any more.
2011-03-06T16:19:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	let me go check out pendrivelinux.  what OS?
2011-03-06T16:20:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	what OS are you planning to install on your USB drive?
2011-03-31T23:46:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	I'd think it'd have to, to save configuration into your /boot directory.
2011-03-31T23:47:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	there is also "sudo update-grub" for all your grub reconfiguring needs.
2011-03-31T23:50:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	upgrading to a new release actually changes your repo list and then updates all your software to versions in the new repo
2011-03-31T23:50:00.000Z	thevishy	arkanabar	thats fine . But say I am using a USB of an ISO ....will it intelligently overwrite by existing partition
2011-03-31T23:52:00.000Z	arkanabar	thevishy	if you're installing, when you get to partitioning make sure to format the partition you select to do that.
