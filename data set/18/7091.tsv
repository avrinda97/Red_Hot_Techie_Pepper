2008-07-06T09:33:00.000Z	jscinoz		is the update-grub2 script in the package grub-pc supposed to actually do anything
2008-07-06T09:33:00.000Z	jscinoz		good thanks earlmred
2008-07-06T09:33:00.000Z	jscinoz		trying to get grub2 to work but having a few issues >_<
2008-07-06T09:35:00.000Z	stemount^	jscinoz	don't do that cmd
2008-07-06T09:35:00.000Z	stemount^	jscinoz	do this instead
2008-07-06T09:36:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	one second, gotta go use the alternate cd rescue shell + activate lvm + chroot into system >_<
2008-07-06T09:36:00.000Z	stemount^	jscinoz	heh
2008-07-06T09:36:00.000Z	stemount^	jscinoz	why do you use LVM? :O
2008-07-06T09:37:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	its this: 4 velociraptor > software raid 0 > encryption > lvm > home/root/swap
2008-07-06T09:38:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	nvidia fakeraid is horrible
2008-07-06T09:39:00.000Z	stemount^	jscinoz	I know I bought a cheap HP server to play with and nearly cried
2008-07-06T09:44:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	rm -f /boot/grub/grub.cfg; update-grub2; didnt work, grub.cfg is not recreated
2008-07-06T09:45:00.000Z	stemount^	jscinoz	are you positive GRUB is installed? ;)
2008-07-06T09:45:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	aye yes, packages grub2 (meta) and grub-pc are present
2008-07-06T09:45:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	and on boot, i get to have fun with a grub2 rescue prompt
2008-07-06T09:48:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	any ideas why update-grub2 doesnt seem to do anything?
2008-07-06T09:50:00.000Z	jscinoz	stemount^	*prod* you still alive after earlmred's headasplosion?
