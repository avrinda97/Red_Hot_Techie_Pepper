2008-05-15T21:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	turn it off in what way?
2008-05-15T21:26:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	i don't want rhythmbox to try to access my ipod at all
2008-05-15T21:27:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	if it's open and i mount my ipod rhythmbox tries to search it for playable files and finds all kinds of things because i use rockbox instead of itunes
2008-05-15T21:27:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	no i figured that one out :D   now i want the ipod not to appear on the left under "source"
2008-05-15T21:28:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	or is there a way i can rebuild the itunes style database so it doesn't take forever searching everything?
2008-05-15T21:28:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	just the database files
2008-05-15T21:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	you can stop rhythmbox launching when you plug an ipod in
2008-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	yeah i did that and now it doesn't open. which is good. but if it is open and there is an ipod it starts searching
2008-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	hm, don't know then
2008-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	ramukmar, as i understand it, Rhythmbox will use the itunes.db file if it's there, but i don't know how to make one
2008-05-15T21:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	no, audacious is basically a modern version of xmms
2008-05-15T21:34:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	i never used xmms. what does that mean? no library?
2008-05-15T21:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	big playlists
2008-05-15T21:35:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	ok thanks
2008-06-24T19:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	qemu?
2008-07-05T03:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	hiptobecubic	isn't it dash by default?
2008-07-05T03:00:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	gordonjcp	i'm pretty sure it's bash
