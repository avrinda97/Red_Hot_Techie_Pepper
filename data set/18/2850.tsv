2010-02-14T06:45:00.000Z	robertpolson		im not exactly an expert on this
2010-02-14T06:45:00.000Z	robertpolson		but if you post on the ubuntu forum with your specs and stuff
2010-02-14T06:46:00.000Z	robertpolson		you might get some ppl who had the same issues
2010-02-14T06:46:00.000Z	robertpolson		but do a search first to see if you find anything
2010-02-14T06:46:00.000Z	robertpolson		just on google or whatev
2010-02-14T06:47:00.000Z	robertpolson		 I need to reinstall windows seven (it got corrupted) - my machine also has ubuntu installed on a separate partition w/ GRUB as bootloader... is it possible to reinstrall win7 without losing my other partitions?
2010-02-14T06:47:00.000Z	robertpolson		gah
2010-02-14T06:48:00.000Z	robertpolson		Need to re-install win7 without formatting entire hdd... GRUB is my bootloader though. possible?
2010-02-14T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	robertpolson	 should be, Yu may need to reinstall grub.
2010-02-14T06:48:00.000Z	robertpolson	Dr_Willis	how would i do this? i'm not very good with the technical stuff.
2010-02-14T06:53:00.000Z	robertpolson	Dr_Willis	thanks, but neither of those help me, do you have any other links?
2010-02-14T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	robertpolson	 what do you mean neotehr help? You must be a speed reader to come to that conclusion so fast
2010-02-14T06:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	robertpolson	 if you reinstall windows - it will overwrte the linux loader. you then need to reinstrall grub loader,
2010-02-14T06:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	robertpolson	 the bootloader is not the 'rest of the hd'
2010-02-14T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	robertpolson	 trhe win7 cd is supposed to have repair features  - see #windows channel
2010-02-14T06:57:00.000Z	robertpolson	Dr_Willis	will do. thanks for all the help!
