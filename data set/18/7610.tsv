2007-12-09T04:19:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	do i need to do that only for sda or for every single partition ?
2007-12-09T04:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	might depend on x
2007-12-09T04:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	what does fdisk -l       last letter is  L
2007-12-09T04:14:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	nope, not realy, as it doesnt realy matter what "x" i use it always thinks that the "selected disk does not exist"
2007-12-09T04:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	what does fdisk -l       last letter is  L show
2007-12-09T04:15:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	it lists all the partitions on /dev/sda ;)
2007-12-09T04:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	had you edited ANY of the partitions .. which would change all uuid's for that drive..
2007-12-09T04:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	my guess is uuid's are wrong.. let me give you another thing to try
2007-12-09T04:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	sudo vol_id -u /dev/sda7
2007-12-09T04:19:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	i doubt this drive/partition has any uuids, it's a copy of a running system from a different box
2007-12-09T04:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	but your grub will have uuid's ... post your grub menu lst
2007-12-09T04:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	we only want to check the first one or the one you see in grub menu
2007-12-09T04:20:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	i figured that much, so i already replaced all uuids in menu.lst and fstab with good old /dev/sdaX ;) but i'll try it with uuids again
2007-12-09T04:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	Ok...
2007-12-09T04:23:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	vol_id returns a uuid, interesting
2007-12-09T04:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfsoul	:)  I get lucky sometimes
2007-12-09T04:24:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	probably because it's a copy of partition and not of the files
2007-12-09T04:26:00.000Z	wolfsoul	Jack_Sparrow	still i'm wondering what the uuid has to do with my grub problem, my problem is with grub itself not the update-grub script
