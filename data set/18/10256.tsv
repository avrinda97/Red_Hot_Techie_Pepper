2007-08-16T15:51:00.000Z	Branden		i have just install ubuntu and now i am getting grub error 17 at boot.  How do i go about fixing this on that computer
2007-08-16T15:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	have you tried to google Grub 17?... its getting pretty common..
2007-08-16T15:53:00.000Z	Branden	IndyGunFreak	Yeah i am fishing through some forums right now
2007-08-16T15:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	how is your current hardware setup, and how did you install Ubuntu?
2007-08-16T15:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	i suspect what happened(just guessing), is Grub was installed to the wrong drive.  Try goign to your bios, and changing the boot order of the drives.
2007-08-16T15:56:00.000Z	Branden	IndyGunFreak	I think i tried that.  I will try it again, maybe it didnt save my settings
2007-08-16T15:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	are you on a RAID with those two drives
2007-08-16T15:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	you still there?
2007-08-16T16:00:00.000Z	Branden	IndyGunFreak	yeah
2007-08-16T16:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	are you on a raid?
2007-08-16T16:00:00.000Z	Branden	IndyGunFreak	it was trying to boot the correct drive, the other drive prompts me to reboot.  No i am not on raid
2007-08-17T16:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	hmm, just make sure i understand your setup right, . 2 hard drives, 1 has Windows installed one big partition, Drive 2, has 1 windows partition, and an Ubuntu partition.
2007-08-17T16:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	hmm, i wonder if grub somehow got put on the wrong windows partition?
2007-08-17T16:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	so you have 4 OS's?  What OS's?
2007-08-17T16:04:00.000Z	Branden	IndyGunFreak	windows 2000, windows me, windows 2000, ubuntu
2007-08-17T16:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	why do you have two copies of win2k?  and why on earth woudl you have winme?  thats like a big windows virus.
2007-08-17T16:05:00.000Z	Branden	IndyGunFreak	the win2k must remain seperate, and i am unsure of winme at this time
2007-08-17T16:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Branden	sorry, i've never setup Ubuntu to boot multiple Windows Distros, and Ubuntu, I've booted Windows XP, and multiple linux distros, n prob.
