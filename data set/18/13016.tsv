2007-06-28T09:56:00.000Z	matt__		would anyone know how I could take the soundcard output and stream it over shoutcast or something? I am using VNC for remote desktop but this has no sound, and i was looking for a way to stream sound over the internet using another application to go along with vnc.
2007-06-28T09:56:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	shoutcast could work ... but why would you pipe system sounds?
2007-06-28T09:57:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	well sound editing for one
2007-06-28T09:57:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	ahh, then you can use shoutcast with the ability to stream wav
2007-06-28T09:58:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	but from what i see, i can only select a playlist of soundfiles to stream
2007-06-28T09:58:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	shoutcast allows you to configure a directory and then it creates a playlist based in the directory
2007-06-28T09:58:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	check the config file, also, make sure the directory ends with a slash :)
2007-06-28T09:58:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	why are you editing sound remotely though?
2007-06-28T09:58:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	well what directory would i choose to be able to send system sounds?
2007-06-28T10:00:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	no idea, afaik, there is nothing that can pipe /dev/dsp over network ...
2007-06-28T10:00:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	i use thin clients connecting at various places between the house, connecting to instruments, etc. It would also be useful to just be able to hear sound without having to find the file and stream it over to my thin client
2007-06-28T10:01:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	its hard to explain without it sounding strange
2007-06-28T10:01:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	sorry, I don't know how to achieve what you want. I understand what you are saying ...
2007-06-28T10:01:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	thanks
2007-06-28T10:05:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	i don't know much about the linux sound system, what is /dev/dsp?
2007-06-28T10:06:00.000Z	slavik	matt__	default sound device :)
2007-06-28T10:08:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	i use alsa
2007-06-28T10:15:00.000Z	matt__	slavik	why did it matter if i was running alsa or oss?
