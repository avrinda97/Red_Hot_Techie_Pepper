2006-11-09T10:29:00.000Z	rednaxel		last night I installed the latest NVIDIA driver, Version: 1.0-9629 - and managed to get Beryl working, all wonderful... today the X does not start anymore, complains about different versions of kernel modules
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	rednaxel		anyone here managed to get AIGLX/Beryl working with Edgy and NVIDIA 1.0-9629 ?!?
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	guillem101	rednaxel	i do
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	guillem101		(64bit)
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	guillem101		but I do
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	guillem101		no problems, and I've reboot some time ago
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	rednaxel	guillem101	did you compiled your kernel or something?
2006-11-09T10:32:00.000Z	guillem101	rednaxel	I was using nvidia installer but I used the repositories later on
2006-11-09T10:32:00.000Z	guillem101	rednaxel	arre you using the installer??
2006-11-09T10:32:00.000Z	rednaxel	guillem101	yes
2006-11-09T10:32:00.000Z	rednaxel	guillem101	is there a repo with version 1.0-9629 ?!?
2006-11-09T10:32:00.000Z	guillem101	rednaxel	then the problem may be that you have upgraded your kernel
2006-11-09T10:33:00.000Z	guillem101	rednaxel	yes, there are repos
2006-11-09T10:33:00.000Z	guillem101		let me check
2006-11-09T10:33:00.000Z	rednaxel	guillem101	it's a fresh install of Edgy
2006-11-09T10:34:00.000Z	guillem101		I cannot reach the mouse right now... rednaxel , check the beryl home page, at the wiki they have the repos for the drivers
2006-11-09T10:34:00.000Z	guillem101	rednaxel	alternatively you might run "nvidia-installer" and get gujded by the program. I guess it will compile the kernel module
