2008-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	drguildo		how do i remove pulseaudio from ubuntu 8.10?
2008-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	drguildo		Slack, no, now i have no sound and am getting gstreamer errors when i go to test it under preferences
2008-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	drguildo		Slack, since removing it
2008-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	joebodo	drguildo	follow the instructions here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio
2008-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	drguildo	joebodo	they don't work. /etc/asound.conf doesn't exist
2008-11-12T00:09:00.000Z	joebodo	drguildo	why not just select alsa in system->preferences->sound ?
2008-11-12T00:10:00.000Z	joebodo	drguildo	plz dont give out misinformation
2008-11-12T00:10:00.000Z	drguildo	joebodo	what misinformation?
2008-11-12T00:11:00.000Z	joebodo	drguildo	downgrading is not easy and is not the solution people are looking for
2008-11-12T00:11:00.000Z	drguildo	joebodo	it's the only solution if there isn't a fix available and you want sound to work
2008-11-12T00:12:00.000Z	drguildo	joebodo	anyway, switching to alsa in sound preferences still gives a gstreamer error
2008-11-12T00:13:00.000Z	joebodo	drguildo	do you test shounds work in preferences -> sound ?
2008-11-12T00:13:00.000Z	drguildo	joebodo	i just got it to work by closing pidgin but same problem even with pulseaudio. man sound really is completely broken in 8.10
