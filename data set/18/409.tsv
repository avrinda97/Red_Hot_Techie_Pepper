2012-03-01T10:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	I guess you need to at least get the grub console active instead of the flash blinker to get an idea where the problem is locking up
2012-03-01T10:18:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	ok
2012-03-01T10:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	best guess is that is don't like your graphic adapter and stops there, if so maybe force vga until you find drivers that work
2012-03-01T10:20:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	i have used a usb before on this computer and got it working fine, this used to be my old primary desktop like a month ago, then i got a new chassis plugged everything and it worked, i switched out hard drives and let it sit for a while while i used my other computer, when i came back maybe a week later ive been having nothing but trouble
2012-03-01T10:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	when it was working I'm not sure you were using the same version of ubuntu, or something else broke,  disable all internal components in bios is another option
2012-03-01T10:22:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	it was the same version of ubuntu, i havent touched anything, thats why i cant figure out whats wrong :/
2012-03-01T10:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	well your blind until you see the grub console and what the problem might be
2012-03-01T10:23:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	i cant see anything
2012-03-01T10:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	yes I know that's why L3top suggested the esc key to enable grub console, not sure it works or not
2012-03-01T10:25:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	the esc key does nothing
2012-03-01T10:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	well it's now installed can the boot configs be changed so that you can see the grub console?
2012-03-01T10:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	oh but this is on the usb so can't be changed?
2012-03-01T10:27:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	its not installed, it was installed on another hdd, but i needed it for my main computer so i have a smaller hdd in with no OS, yes this is a USB
2012-03-01T10:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	I'm running out of idea's so maybe pxeboot from the other system?  maybe the problem is the usb hardware
2012-03-01T10:29:00.000Z	drounse	sacarlson	whats pxeboot?
2012-03-01T10:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	drounse	boot from ethernet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYQCFEnjWYA
