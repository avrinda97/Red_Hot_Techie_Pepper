2007-05-01T16:13:00.000Z	PurpZeY		Is it easy to install Fiesty to an external USB drive, and if so, will grub still load up during booting?
2007-05-01T16:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY		Would instally Ubuntu to an external USB drive be any different than installing to an extra internal drive?
2007-05-01T16:16:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	yes, because grub will look for its menu.lst on a drive that might not be present
2007-05-01T16:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	Ahhh...So, in other words, if the drive wasn't present it wouldn't just proceed to the XP drive...It will look for grub and get stuck?
2007-05-01T16:18:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	grub will try to look on the (not present) sda1 for it's menu.lst, won't find it and throw error 17
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	So, is that a difficult/impossible setup?
2007-05-01T16:21:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	no, it just requires a separate partiton for grub, or not using grub at all to boot the USB-ubuntu. there might even be BIOS's that can boot from USB, so grub can be installed to the USB sticks MBR, because the hd's MBR is not looked at
2007-05-01T16:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	If my bios would support booting to USB How do I setup the ubuntu install properly?
2007-05-01T16:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	No I mean, I know how to do the install itself, but is there some particular setup I need w/ the seperate grub partition or anything?
2007-05-01T16:24:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	that depends on your bios. You'll need the alternate install CD to determine where grub gets installed in the process. Desktop CD can't do that
2007-05-01T16:25:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	got it, thanks.
2007-05-01T16:28:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	make sure to use tmpfs for /tmp and avoid a swap-partiton on the USB-disk... flash memory does not like to be written too often
2007-06-06T09:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	Out of curiosity, reinstalling ubuntu desktop won't reinstall gnome?
2007-06-06T09:33:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	no it would just check if all the default packages are installed. a metapackage does nothing more than having a predefined set of dependencies
2007-06-06T09:34:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	So what would you do if you somehow corrupted gnome?
2007-06-06T09:36:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	dpkg-reconfigure or apt-get install --reinstall the package off the app which got corupt
2007-07-04T13:58:00.000Z	stefg	PurpZeY	avahi-daemon and network-manager are my favourite victims to blame
2007-07-21T10:47:00.000Z	PurpZeY	stefg	I've walked that path...I am in a little bit of a more quirky situation
