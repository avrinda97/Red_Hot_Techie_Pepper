2007-04-01T11:48:00.000Z	SpOrTiF	xtknight	how i can see all operator of this channel?
2007-04-01T11:48:00.000Z	xtknight	SpOrTiF	they are not ops until a request
2007-04-01T11:48:00.000Z	xtknight	SpOrTiF	just to keep privacy i guess
2007-04-01T11:48:00.000Z	xtknight	SpOrTiF	besides, you go slower than the speed limit when the cops are near you, no? :P
2007-04-01T11:48:00.000Z	xtknight	SpOrTiF	they do hear too.  but they are called by a command i'd rather not type because i'd disturb the giants
