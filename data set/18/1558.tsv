2012-05-30T22:27:00.000Z	amh345		apache tell me to go here
2012-05-30T22:27:00.000Z	amh345		because it's distro specific
2012-05-30T22:29:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	We don't package apache2.4 for any of our releases. Why do you need to 'upgrade' to 2.4?
2012-05-30T22:30:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	PCI compliance requires it. heres a snippet from the findings "Apache HTTP Server versions released prior to version 2.4.2 place a
2012-05-30T22:32:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	let me check something, be just a minite.
2012-05-30T22:35:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	ok thank you.  any info you can find would be greatly appreciated.   im going nuts here.   i've done the build.  i've done the install all went well. except it wouldnt run without tons of errors.
2012-05-30T22:37:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	Okay, It looks like you're talking about the issue listed in CVE-2012-0883, according to our CVE tracker, it appears that we have a patch applied against the apache2.2 that would prevent this scenario from being applicable. ( see http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2012/CVE-2012-0883.html )  So theres no need to switch to the 2.4 branch of apache.
2012-05-30T22:38:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	thank you so much!!
2012-05-30T22:41:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	if you're talking about the patch I just mentioned, you don't need to. That was applied on the source package before it was built and distributed to our package repositories. The resulting binaries do not have the issue.
2012-05-30T22:42:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	oh. i see.
2012-05-30T22:43:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	PCI relies on version numbers, which often do not reflect the patches that have been applied against the source.
2012-05-30T22:44:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	ok. time to plea my case to them
2012-05-30T22:51:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	According to our CVE tracker, we have always used that patch, so you've never been vulnerable to this particular CVE.
2012-05-30T23:07:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	im sorry to be a bother about this stuff. but PCI are being really anal.  they're asking for version nubmers and all that stuff to prove that it's patched.  can you link me to the CVE tracker post? or something that has that info?
2012-05-30T23:09:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	You can point them to http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2012/CVE-2012-0883.html
2012-05-30T23:14:00.000Z	Pici	amh345	It was never an issue for us because we happen to apply a patch to the source package that prevents the situation from occurring. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276670 should be helpful to explain why debian (and therefore us) uses that patch.
2012-05-30T23:23:00.000Z	amh345	Pici	that you very much for all the information.  and helping to better understand how this works.   i've submitted my appeal
