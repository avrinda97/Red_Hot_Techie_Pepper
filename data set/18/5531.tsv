2008-10-05T16:26:00.000Z	Kehnoo		if I have a raid with md should I run badblocks for the md-drive or invidiual drives?
2008-10-05T16:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	individual drives for hardware, meta device for software/file system, best to let fsck manage bad blocks for you
2008-10-05T16:28:00.000Z	Kehnoo	ikonia	my fsck process has been stuck for 3 days and the chaps at other channel said I should run badblocks
2008-10-05T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	badblocks can be called from fsck
2008-10-05T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	are you using software raid ?
2008-10-05T16:29:00.000Z	Kehnoo	ikonia	yes
2008-10-05T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	does /proc/mdstat show the array as in sync
2008-10-05T16:29:00.000Z	Kehnoo	ikonia	yes
2008-10-05T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	what type of array 0,1,5,6 ?
2008-10-05T16:30:00.000Z	Kehnoo	ikonia	5 with 9 + 1 spare
2008-10-05T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	how are you trying to extend it ?
2008-10-05T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	keep in mind that dynamic growth of raid 5 arrays is still experimental
2008-10-05T16:32:00.000Z	Kehnoo	ikonia	I did mdadm --grow few times with only 1 disk so it should be fine. I had it mounted between disk additions and data seemed to still there
2008-10-05T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	just keep in mind that it is buggy
2008-10-05T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	just because it has worked doesn't mean you should be fine
2008-10-05T16:33:00.000Z	Kehnoo	ikonia	so should I wait for the fsck to finish?
2008-10-05T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	in my opinion yes
2008-10-05T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Kehnoo	file system integrity is important
