2012-08-19T00:16:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	you can `chown` things owned by a nonexistent account
2012-08-19T00:19:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	let my clarify that.
2012-08-19T00:21:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	can you use `sudo` from your current account?
2012-08-19T00:22:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	if you can, all this other stuff is completely unnecessary.
2012-08-19T00:25:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	just run that command, no need to do anything else.
2012-08-19T00:25:00.000Z	Mothra	Moonlightning	1000
2012-08-19T00:27:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	`sudo chown -R $USER ~`
2012-08-19T00:28:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	with `sudo`?
2012-08-19T00:30:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	`ls -ld ~/.gvfs`
2012-08-19T00:31:00.000Z	Mothra	Moonlightning	ls: cannot access /home/stevesenior/.gvfs: Permission denied
2012-08-19T00:31:00.000Z	Mothra	Moonlightning	I was using sudo
2012-08-19T00:34:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	if you're getting a permission-denied as root, I honestly don't know what to tell you…
2012-08-19T00:36:00.000Z	Mothra	Moonlightning	are you talking to me when you are refering to getting other error? That is the only output I have gotten from the commands I have run
2012-08-19T00:37:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	you should be fine, then, I guess, except for that one directory|file.
2012-08-19T00:39:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	I honestly don't know. Try googling it?
2012-08-19T00:40:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	there's your answer, I guess… XD
2012-08-19T00:43:00.000Z	Moonlightning	Mothra	~/.gvfs is the folder where things like remote server get mounted to [from ActionParsnip]
