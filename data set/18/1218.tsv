2012-01-03T06:29:00.000Z	juan_		how do i create a script that i can double click and have it run some commands? my wireless card does not work unless i do two commands
2012-01-03T06:30:00.000Z	escott	juan_	put the commands in a file. have the file start with #!/bin/bash run chmod +x filename
2012-01-03T06:30:00.000Z	escott	juan_	and put the file in $HOME/bin
2012-01-03T06:31:00.000Z	juan_	escott	 i didnt get that, can i put the commands in a paste bin and you show me what i got to do?
2012-01-03T06:32:00.000Z	escott	juan_	not sure how else i would say it. you want a file that starts #!/bin/bash and the subsequent lines should have whatever else you want
2012-01-03T06:32:00.000Z	juan_		im a very very new guy to linux....:(
2012-01-03T06:32:00.000Z	escott	juan_	save that file as $HOME/bin/startwireless.sh, and then open a terminal and type chmod +x ~/bin/startwireless.sh
2012-01-03T06:32:00.000Z	juan_		ahhh i got it
2012-01-03T06:34:00.000Z	escott	juan_	if you want these commands run on every boot you can put them in /etc/rc.local, and if you want it on every login add it to gnome-session-properties

2012-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	juan_		since they need sudo, i dont know if it will be correct.
2012-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	escott	juan_	you cant have sudo commands in a script that you double click it wont work. you need to add these commands (without the sudo) to /etc/rc.local. in fact if all you are doing is loading modules you should be modifying /etc/modules
2012-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	escott	juan_	im not sure what the cd hybrid_wl command is supposed to do. it shouldnt make a difference
2012-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	juan_	escott	cd hybrid is to get to that folder where i do the third command
2012-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	juan_	escott	where i run the third command the insmod....
2012-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	escott	juan_	i dont think modprobe looks at the current working directory
2012-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	juan_	escott	i dont know, its just the steps in the readme of the broadcom readme steps
2012-01-03T06:42:00.000Z	juan_	escott	you still there?
