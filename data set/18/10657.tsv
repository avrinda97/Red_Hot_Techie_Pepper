2012-06-17T02:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	Nobody has said anything about redownloading the iso.
2012-06-17T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	Yes, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows has very clear instructions on how to do this, including screenshots.
2012-06-17T02:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	The iso filename has the word "desktop" in it, that refers to its intention to be used on "desktop" (or laptop/nebook) computers as opposed to servers.
2012-06-17T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	Then you follow http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-desktop
2012-06-17T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	You're welcome.
2012-06-17T03:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	Could you write down, or post a picture (taken with a camera) of the exact error message?
2012-06-17T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	I think an actual picture of the error message would still be helpful if it's not too much trouble.
2012-06-17T03:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dreadiscool	You can upload the image to http://imagebin.org/?page=add
