2009-11-13T14:50:00.000Z	UncleD		What software do I need to login to my ubuntu server from Windows XP and see the "Windows" version of ubuntu rather than just the terminal prompt?
2009-11-13T14:51:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	you mean like a remote desktop client?
2009-11-13T14:53:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	TightVNC will do the job
2009-11-13T14:53:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	http://www.tightvnc.com/
2009-11-13T14:53:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	do i need to install tightvnc server on my ubuntu machine?
2009-11-13T14:54:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	nope, it already has a vnc server and client, just install that to your windows machine, I recommend NOT running it as a service on your windows machine, just start and stop it when you need it.
2009-11-13T14:55:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	ok what i'm saying is lets say my ubuntu server is ubuntu.com
2009-11-13T14:55:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	heres a howto I wrote, I think it "should" get you setup they way you need to be http://www.mylinuxinstaller.com/Guides.html
2009-11-13T14:57:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	that howto just shows how to install tight vnc
2009-11-13T14:57:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	my question is once ive installed tight vnc, how do i log into my ubuntu box with it
2009-11-13T14:58:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	run the TightVnc Viewer from the Windows Applications menu, make sure you have the vnc server turned on in Ubuntu (System>Preferences>Remote Desktop)
2009-11-13T14:59:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	there will be a wizard that will let you put in the url of your Ubuntu box when you run the TightVNC viewer client
2009-11-13T15:00:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	I it appears that I need to install vncserver on my ubuntu box though
2009-11-13T15:00:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	because i hanvent setup vnc on my ubuntu box. ie. no password, no vnc server setup
2009-11-13T15:00:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	it is already installed, you just have to enable it through System>Preferences>Remote Desktop
2009-11-13T15:01:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	look up a ways hehe, you missed my previous post on it :)
2009-11-13T15:01:00.000Z	UncleD	starcannon	can i enable remote desktop remotely through the terminal prompt
2009-11-13T15:02:00.000Z	starcannon	UncleD	you should be able to, that'd be a gconftool thing I'd think, or there are other ways of doing it; I have never tried that though
