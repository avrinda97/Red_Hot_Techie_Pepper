2011-07-25T21:50:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	or, aplay /dev/urandom
2011-07-25T21:53:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	 it worked with aplay /dev/urandom, but I heard nothing.  I checked the output and it said:  Output Dummy.  Whaaaaat?
2011-07-25T21:53:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	cat /proc/asound/cards
2011-07-25T21:53:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	usr13: I heard nothing
2011-07-25T21:56:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	 No such file or directory with cat /proc/asound/cards
2011-07-25T21:57:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	do you have /proc/asound?
2011-07-25T21:58:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	 I don't think so.  I'm running sudi apt-get install sox now, so I'll check when it's finished
2011-07-25T21:59:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	 No such file or directory
2011-07-25T22:00:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	sound will not work without /proc/asound/, what's your sound card? lspci|grep -i audio
2011-07-25T22:02:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	I typed in lspci|grep -i audio and nothing happened.
2011-07-25T22:03:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	lspci
2011-07-25T22:03:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	if lspci doesn't show your sound card, you may have disabled audio in BIOS
2011-07-25T22:06:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	it's probably nothing to do with software, if lspci doesn't show audio card
2011-07-25T22:08:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	first, you would like to reboot, and enter BIOS setting at during power on self test, then, audio would just work
2011-07-25T22:09:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	 I am SO new at this.  How do I enter BIOS setting?
2011-07-25T22:09:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	it depends on your mainboard. :( usually, it's Del, F2, F10, etc.
2011-07-25T22:11:00.000Z	dli	RoniW	without lspci showing audio card, there's nothing you can do with software, after that, you need the kernel driver to get /proc/asound/ , after that, it may be just alsamixer
2011-07-25T22:12:00.000Z	RoniW	dli	 usr13:  ThinkT510:  Y'all have a great day and thanks again!
