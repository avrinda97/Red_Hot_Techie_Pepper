2008-03-24T05:27:00.000Z	LumberCartel		I've been setting up some old machines for people with Ubuntu Linux on them (they were previously Windows boxes from a school that upgraded their hardware, but the licenses weren't transferrable), and the few people who received them are very happy with them.
2008-03-24T05:28:00.000Z	LumberCartel		I've been using g4u to replicate Ubuntu installs, and all is working well, but some of these machines have larger drives and I'd like to know how to set up a partition using the extra disk space.
2008-03-24T05:28:00.000Z	LumberCartel		Any help would be greatly appreciated.
2008-03-24T05:29:00.000Z	LumberCartel		I've found a few other poor families without computers -- the kids will be using Ubuntu with OpenOffice.org for their homework.  I've been giving these machines away for free.
2008-03-24T05:30:00.000Z	LumberCartel		Sorry c-ron, that was meant for kindofabuzz.
2008-03-24T05:31:00.000Z	LumberCartel		I'm fairly new to Linux, and am wondering:  How can I get a list of partitions, and how can I create a new one?  I know how to mount partitions from separately mounted drives already.
2008-03-24T05:33:00.000Z	LumberCartel		Google hasn't been very helpful for partition management solutions in Ubuntu -- all I keep finding is stuff about Windows partitions, which is what I'm trying to get the world to get away from.
2008-03-24T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	 'sudo fdisk -l' for a list, to make/move/alter them - i normally use gparted.
2008-03-24T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	 same name as the command under windows. :) well used to be under windows.
2008-03-24T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	  gparted will show them also - of course.  but fdisk -l is a good command to get a list of all the disns on a system
2008-03-24T05:36:00.000Z	LumberCartel	Dr_willis	 I see hda1, hda2, and hda5 only.  Seems others are left out of the list?
2008-03-24T05:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	 what others?  It should list all that are seen by the bios.
2008-03-24T05:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	  thats how extended and logical and primary partitions are named. 1-4  = primaries, 5+ = logicals/extendds
2008-03-24T05:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	 http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Partition.html has a lot of info. Some of it may be a little out of date.
2008-03-24T05:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	 under many new disrtos - the ide drives are called by the 'sd' type names. hda1 = sda1, and so forth. Due to some changes in how drives are handled. - somthing to watch out for
2008-03-24T05:42:00.000Z	LumberCartel	Dr_willis	 Thanks.  I'm familiar with some of this stuff from NetBSD.  It seems that Linux does things quite differently.
2008-03-24T05:42:00.000Z	LumberCartel	Dr_willis	thanks again for all your help.  I'll be reading for a while then I'll return if I have any more questions.
2008-03-24T05:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LumberCartel	 bsd names the drives in a different way also.. GRUB also names them in a different way also. :)
