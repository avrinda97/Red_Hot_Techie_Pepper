2012-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	pinportal		ok, ubuntu 12,04 64bits will be recomended by canonical? why?
2012-01-25T01:41:00.000Z	pinportal		ok but i have a AMD 32 bits that  is running  ubuntu 11,10
2012-01-25T01:43:00.000Z	pinportal		how can i use the ubuntu 12,04 because my processor is 32 bits
2012-01-25T01:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	the release is available in 32bit
2012-01-25T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	I'm on Precise 32bit right now..
2012-01-25T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	64bit isn't faster than 32bit overall.
2012-01-25T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	how do you mean "chance"?
2012-01-25T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	and how do you mean "advanced"
2012-01-25T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	well, it's made for WIndows.
2012-01-25T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	you can check the appdb to see how it runs in wine
2012-01-25T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	if you use the PC mainly for gaming, I'd stick with windows. Running games doesn't make an OS advanced.It means the devs have neglected to code it for any other OS.
2012-01-25T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	so thats no reflection of the OS
2012-01-25T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	games like urbanterror, Doom3, penumbra and return to castle wolfenstein ALL run natively on BOTH OSes
2012-01-25T01:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	Windows 7 is still supported by Microsoft even when Windows 8 comes out. You don't need to upgrade just because a new release is out
2012-01-25T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	what client?
2012-01-25T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pinportal	http://xchatdata.net/Using/Assistant   shows how
