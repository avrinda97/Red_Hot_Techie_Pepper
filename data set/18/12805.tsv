2007-01-03T17:13:00.000Z	maddash		he's gone lol
2007-01-03T17:14:00.000Z	maddash		you realize that banning would do nothing if the abuser were using dial-up or something, rah?
2007-01-03T17:15:00.000Z	maddash		has anyone ever managed to get fglrx working on breezy? and I'm not talking about the caveman version from ubuntu repos (ver 8.16.20, I think)
2007-01-03T17:17:00.000Z	maddash		dependencies, daniel1988.
2007-01-03T17:19:00.000Z	daniel1988	maddash	sure, but why it tries to install linux-image-2.6.17-10-386 if it already has installed linux-image-2.6.17-10-genteric ?
2007-01-03T17:20:00.000Z	maddash	daniel1988	there's a package called "linux-image-[...] -generic"?
2007-01-03T17:21:00.000Z	maddash	daniel1988	if you meant plain old  "linux-image-[...] ", it's a virtual package, I think...you still need the "linux-image-[386/686/k7/etc] "
2007-01-03T17:21:00.000Z	daniel1988	maddash	there is already installed kernel source generic, why it needs 386
2007-01-03T17:22:00.000Z	daniel1988	maddash	anyway, should I let it install them?
2007-01-03T17:22:00.000Z	maddash	daniel1988	I don't think you have a choice...
2007-01-03T17:22:00.000Z	daniel1988	maddash	ok, thx
2007-01-03T17:23:00.000Z	maddash	daniel1988	np.
