2010-08-14T14:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	first of all, did you install using wubi (the windows installer) or a normal install ?
2010-08-14T14:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	do you see grub:sh> or grub:rescue> ?
2010-08-14T14:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	type 'ls' and type here what shows up
2010-08-14T14:19:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	only that?
2010-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	how many partitions do you have?
2010-08-14T14:25:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	do you have ubuntu live cd?
2010-08-14T14:28:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	ok here are the options: a) you can make an ubuntu live cd to that we can investigate this issue further  b) use the windows cd to fix the problem but you'll not be able to access ubuntu and you'll have to reinstall it
2010-08-14T14:40:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest98456	if you don't mind, please also burn ubuntu live cd to further investigate this issue because I've seen this reported here more than once
