2011-05-10T05:17:00.000Z	vacho		how do I create a script that runs a set of commands??
2011-05-10T05:18:00.000Z	vacho		what does ./ mean basically.
2011-05-10T05:19:00.000Z	vacho		ok
2011-05-10T05:19:00.000Z	vacho		how do I launch a .sh file?
2011-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	vacho		ok thanks
2011-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	vacho		I made a file called aptana.sh .. when I do ./aptana.sh it says: permission denied
2011-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	./ means the directory you are in RIGHT NOW  (:
2011-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	Do this "chmod a+x aptana.sh"
2011-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	you get that message because you actually don't have the needed rights..
2011-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	vacho	jstoone	lastly, how do I create a shortcut on desktop that runs my sh script ? :D
2011-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	Yea that's ok too ;)
2011-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	one sec
2011-05-10T05:24:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	"ln -s /your/script/file/ /link/destination/
2011-05-10T05:25:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	so it would be "ln -s aptana.sh ~/Desktop"
2011-05-10T05:25:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	that is if you're in the same folder as your .sh script (:
2011-05-10T05:44:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	look up compiz-configuration, could have something
2011-05-10T05:45:00.000Z	vacho	jstoone	thanks
2011-05-10T05:46:00.000Z	jstoone	vacho	You're welcome
