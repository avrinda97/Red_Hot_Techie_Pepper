2008-09-07T08:13:00.000Z	mn		what do I need to use flash stuff on kubuntu on FF3?
2008-09-07T08:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	You can either install flashplugin-nonfree from the repos or just let firefox do it itself. If you go with flash 9, you'll want to install libflashsupport as well.
2008-09-07T08:14:00.000Z	mn	bobertdos	how do i get flash 9
2008-09-07T08:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Apparently, flash is also included in ubuntu-extras, so either way.
2008-09-07T08:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Oh sorry, misread a previous post.
2008-09-07T08:17:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Go into a terminal and type sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree libflashsupport
2008-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	It'll be an option under the Options menu at the login screen (Select Session)
2008-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Did you get flash working?
2008-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	mn	bobertdos	Yes, and ok thanks
2008-09-07T23:49:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Normally, one uses the dpkg command in the terminal. sudo dpkg -i <package>
2008-09-08T00:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	I just got back to my computer. What is it you're needing to do in VLC?
2008-09-08T00:34:00.000Z	mn	bobertdos	 I just installed VLC because totem was default playing my dvd in Italian so I want to know if I can get rid of Totem without sacrificing functionality to save disk space
2008-09-08T00:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	I think you can. It would just be a matter of uninstalling totem-xine or totem-gstreamer. Hopefully, it won't take any dependencies with it.
2008-09-08T00:36:00.000Z	mn	bobertdos	so VLC and totem do exactly the same things?
2008-09-08T00:38:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Well, they're both media players, but the main difference is that Totem uses all the external codecs and VLC uses mostly internal ones (they're hard linked to the progran).
2008-09-08T00:38:00.000Z	mn	bobertdos	so which do you think is better?
2008-09-08T00:40:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	Well, I go back and forth between the two. VLC tends to be a little easier to maintain exactly BECAUSE it uses hard-linked codecs.
2008-09-08T01:45:00.000Z	bobertdos	mn	I think he's having Grub issues.
