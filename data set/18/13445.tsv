2006-01-08T16:37:00.000Z	New2UbuntuGuy		that would explain alot :D
2006-01-08T16:37:00.000Z	New2UbuntuGuy		let me check..
2006-01-08T16:38:00.000Z	New2UbuntuGuy		thank you so much for all your help...if I can get a cat walking around on her desktop, she will be beside herself with joy, and for mother in laws, thats a VERY good thing
2006-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	New2UbuntuGuy		not so much that, cause she loves the resultant grand child...
2006-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	New2UbuntuGuy		but the resultant grand child likes to sit with her and watch the desk mate cat that I had on this old win98 machine
2006-01-08T16:40:00.000Z	New2UbuntuGuy		no kitty? crap
2006-01-08T16:41:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	oneko works fine for me
2006-01-08T16:56:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	which oneko?
2006-01-08T16:56:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	/usr/X11R6/bin/oneko is the command for oneko
2006-01-08T16:57:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	dpkg -L pkgname
2006-01-08T16:57:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	so xpenguins should already be in your path
2006-01-08T16:58:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	only problem with xpenguins is it doesn't pay nice with the nautilus desktop.. (meaning icons will have trails carved through them by the penguins)
2006-01-09T17:04:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	kill the processes
2006-01-09T17:06:00.000Z	polpak	New2UbuntuGuy	excellent
