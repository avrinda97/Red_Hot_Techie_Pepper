2010-03-10T02:26:00.000Z	hmw		I am looking for a driver that lets one access an Ubuntu 9.10 partition from within Windows. What should I be googleing for? Looks like I am too stupid today to find it.
2010-03-10T02:26:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	fs-driver.org i think.. but it does not support ext4 as far as i know.
2010-04-18T03:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	this may help.. http://www.linuxatemyram.com/
2010-04-18T04:01:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	do you suspend/hibernate your box?
2010-04-18T04:01:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	no.
2010-04-18T04:03:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	according to free, 1.5 GB seem to be in use for buffers
2010-04-18T04:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	that link i gave you will explain how to understand free
2010-04-18T04:04:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	i am reading it right now
2010-04-18T04:04:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	defacto the "next page" it links to.
2010-04-18T04:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	ah, it has been awhile since i've looked at the page
2010-04-18T04:05:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	i can't turn of swap, so I think, the memory leak theory applies.
2010-04-18T04:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	does top show where the memory has went?
2010-04-18T04:07:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	buffers
2010-04-18T04:10:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	1) buffers are not the same as file cache, are they?? 2) if so, i should be able to turn off swap, right? 3) Now I am confused.
2010-05-15T08:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
2010-05-15T08:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	 uh drop the -nl on that
2010-05-15T09:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	hmw	disregard my post.. it is horribly wrong
2010-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	hmw	bastid_raZor	heh. :) now i put it on my blog, i will never have to ask again
