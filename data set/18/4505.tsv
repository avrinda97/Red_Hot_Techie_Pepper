2009-06-24T04:27:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	hard drive encryption, FDE
2009-06-24T04:34:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	do you want to give a benchmark of FDE impact?
2009-06-24T04:34:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	oh, sorry, misread that
2009-06-24T04:34:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	Please do. :3
2009-06-24T04:34:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	Meh?
2009-06-24T04:38:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	software-based FDE will give you around a 30% performance hit on most modern machines, most software will allow you to hit 40gig/hour on the initial encryption. That's why I recommend hardware based encryption, the harddrive takes care of that.
2009-06-24T04:39:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	You're talking about buying a hardware with capacity of encryption?
2009-06-24T04:40:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	Is Segate is the only one capable of this?
2009-06-24T04:40:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	pretty much, yeah
2009-06-24T04:41:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	this is an example: http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/laptops/momentus/momentus_5400_fde/
2009-06-24T04:44:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	Thanks for the link.  It's interesting thing to know.  We would have to set this up before installing Ubuntu?
2009-06-24T04:51:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	I'm a Security Consultant, I only work with commercial FDEs and have only done deployments under Windows (customer is king) so I don't know how you would setup a key management tool on *nix
2009-06-24T04:52:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	I suggest you checkout truecrypt (open source) and see how they support FDE vendors
2009-06-24T04:52:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	Hmm.  How did you naturally set it up in Windows?  Before the installation?
2009-06-24T04:53:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	crashanddie_	I'll look into FDE on Wikipedia.  Nice nickname.  Hacker movie. ;3
2009-06-24T04:54:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	not hacker movie
2009-06-24T04:54:00.000Z	crashanddie_	mobi-sheep	FDE vendors such as WinMagic provide key management tools which take care of the pre-boot authentication and keyfile management
