2007-02-11T17:26:00.000Z	mike1o		u know how in linux if u select something it's automatically copied onto the clipboard... well how do i get that (in python)?
2007-02-11T17:27:00.000Z	Jowi	mike1o	you should ask in #python
2007-03-10T09:58:00.000Z	Jowi	mike1o	first have a look at linuxpringing.org
2007-03-10T09:59:00.000Z	Jowi	mike1o	linuxprinting.org (corrected typo)
2007-03-10T10:00:00.000Z	Jowi	mike1o	you might be out of luck. or, there might be a similar driver to use. depends on the printer. got a name + model number?
2007-03-10T10:00:00.000Z	mike1o	Jowi	bulmer, i have even tried similar printers... but it just prints rubbish
2007-03-10T10:01:00.000Z	mike1o	Jowi	xerox workcentre pro 412
2007-03-10T10:10:00.000Z	Jowi	mike1o	xerox seem to have no driver available for anything else than win. however, over at ibm.com I see that it uses HP PCL6 and the following pdt files: hppcl5.pdt / HPLJ4.PDT. maybe that will help you. taken from here: http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas1cc6ee2005999a36d862569c100796da4
2007-03-10T10:12:00.000Z	mike1o	Jowi	where do u suggest i go about getting the driver to test it out?
2007-03-10T10:18:00.000Z	Jowi	mike1o	maybe this one but unsure http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-PCL_6_PCL_XL_Printer
