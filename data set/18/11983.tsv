2007-01-15T17:37:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	thanks man for the adduser
2008-04-16T00:18:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	the kernel is not finding the filesystem for /. probably the kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst is wrong or your intrd is broken
2008-04-16T00:20:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	is my system completely lost _
2008-04-16T00:22:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	not your system .... it's rather you being a bit lost. it takes some knowledgable look at the boot process to find out where and why the boot hangs.
2008-04-16T00:23:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	i say that i would read a lot to save the system, but i do not know what to do
2008-04-16T00:23:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	what did you do with startup manager?
2008-04-16T00:25:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	i tried not to having the bootsplash screen anymore
2008-04-16T00:25:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	so you edited /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2008-04-16T00:27:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	i do not know what did the program exactly
2008-04-16T00:27:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	how did you install?
2008-04-16T00:27:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	sudo apt-get install startupmanager
2008-04-16T00:29:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	after skimming over the docu i guess that your /boot/grub/menu.lst is hosed. So you are on live cd now?
2008-04-16T00:30:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	yes. i am in cd now, i did mount in /mnt and chrooted
2008-04-16T00:31:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	so can you paste the /boot/grub/menu.lst of the installed system to pastebin ?
2008-04-16T00:32:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	and while you're at it add the output of 'sudo fdisk -l' as well
2008-04-16T00:35:00.000Z	ubuntu__	stefg	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63346/
2008-04-16T00:40:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	looks normal. so my next guess would be a broken initrd. unfortunaly an 'update-initramfs' won't work in a chrooted environment, so you might have better luck by trying to 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic' in the chroot
2008-04-16T00:42:00.000Z	stefg	ubuntu__	after that is done i'd rewrite grubs MBR.
