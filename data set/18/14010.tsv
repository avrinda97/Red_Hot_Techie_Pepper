2011-06-18T04:26:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	Does it work while running the liveCD?
2011-06-18T04:28:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	Are volume levels turned up?

2011-06-18T04:31:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp  #and listen for noise, try plugging into another port. Ctrl-c to stop

2011-06-18T04:37:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	Or just:   grep audio /etc/group
2011-06-18T04:38:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	And show us.
2011-06-18T04:39:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	Just see if your user name is in group audio
2011-06-18T04:39:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	But yes, it would be helpful if we could see.
2011-06-18T04:39:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	Ok ther eis your problem
2011-06-18T04:40:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	You simply need to add your user-name to group audio.  vim /etc/group  and put a comma after plulse and type in the user name.  Log out and back in again.
2011-06-18T04:48:00.000Z	usr13	Rain	Yes, everyting is case sensitive in Linux
