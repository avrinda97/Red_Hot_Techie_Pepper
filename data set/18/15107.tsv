2005-05-06T16:51:00.000Z	ruukia		is possible to get 32 bit color on ati mobility radeon 9000 IGP ?? i'm running ubuntu 5.04 on my laptop
2005-05-06T16:51:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	more like 24bit
2005-05-06T16:52:00.000Z	ruukia	WhiteRabbit	i got 24 bit but is 32 bit possible ?
2005-05-06T16:53:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	better yet you tell me why 32bit is better than 24bit or is it really better as 24bit could be better?! hm ;)~
2005-05-06T16:53:00.000Z	ruukia	WhiteRabbit	honestly dunno :) i was asking cuz my xp supported 32bit ... more colors i guess .
2005-05-06T16:54:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	Heh
2005-05-06T16:55:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	Note that there is no 32 bit color. its a tricky term for 24bit really ;)~
2005-05-06T16:56:00.000Z	ruukia	WhiteRabbit	dcraven, hehe thx :)
2005-05-06T16:57:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	long as your in 24bit in linux thats great
2005-05-06T16:57:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	its that same as your 32bit in windows
2005-05-06T16:57:00.000Z	ruukia	WhiteRabbit	my screen still looks a bit fuzzy though
2005-05-06T16:58:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	laptop? lcd?
2005-05-06T16:59:00.000Z	ruukia	WhiteRabbit	yup laptop lcd (acer travelmate 2200) with subpixel smoothing
2005-05-06T05:00:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	open prefs & goto font
2005-05-06T05:00:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	ruukia	change it to subpixel lcd mode & hit details & choose hinting full
2005-05-06T05:01:00.000Z	ruukia	WhiteRabbit	yup i had already set it at that ...
