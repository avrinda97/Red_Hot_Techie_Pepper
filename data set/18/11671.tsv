2008-12-20T10:49:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 with twinview here i can drag  to either monitor.  Im not sure how you are starting 2
2008-12-20T10:49:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	my mouse goes between but no program windows
2008-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 sounds like you may have twinbview enabled wrong, or somthing else odd. ior using 2 seprate X servers.
2008-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	yeah separate x servers
2008-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	but I don't see why I can't open two instances of firefox
2008-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	maybe dragging between xservers is a stretch but I should be able to spawn one in each monitor
2008-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	I can do it with terminal shells and games and stuff
2008-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 firefox checks.. if its allready running it dosent allow a 2nd one.. and yes You can force stuff to start on the 2nd X display. with the right DISPLAY variable.
2008-12-20T10:52:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	 that's the odd thing I only see X :0
2008-12-20T10:53:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 i never use the seprate X display settings. I just tell twinview sot use one WIDE display and i drag windows back/forth all the time.. You DO have to restart the X server the first time you enable twinview i recall
2008-12-20T10:54:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	I have two application menus at the top and two clocks and two logoffs, but in the process list I only have display :0    I can't force firefox to DISPLAY=localhost:1
2008-12-20T10:54:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 no idea on that then. i never use  twinview that way.
2008-12-20T10:55:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 i have one panel/clock/logoiff and its ont he left side..
2008-12-20T10:55:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	ok right so you would think I have two x servers, but i only see one.    Error: cannot open display: localhost:1
2008-12-20T10:56:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 twinview may be some how bypassing that method
2008-12-20T10:57:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	no I think it is application dependent since shell and text editor and kasteroids work on both, but firefox is user session
2008-12-20T10:57:00.000Z	willis__	hwilde	 no idea then. when in doubt check the twinview docs I guess.
2008-12-20T10:57:00.000Z	hwilde	willis__	firefox issue not twinview
