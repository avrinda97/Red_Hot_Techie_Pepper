2011-08-10T21:26:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	Hello
2011-08-10T21:26:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	gksudo
2011-08-10T21:28:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	For future reference;  It's best that you do not use enter for punctuation.  Put all of  your post on one output.
2011-08-10T21:30:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	Use the command   sudo
2011-08-10T21:30:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	gksudo gedit <file-name-here>
2011-08-10T21:32:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	Issue command:    gksudo gedit <file-name-here>
2011-08-10T21:33:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	But first, make sure it is really a text file, (not binary).  i.e.  file <file-name-here>
2011-08-10T21:35:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	Issue command:    gksudo gedit <file-name-here>
2011-08-10T21:36:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	He means you should hold Ctrl key and hit o
2011-08-10T21:37:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	He means you should hold Ctrl key and hit o  #That is for when you are done editing.
2011-08-10T21:38:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	what is the name of the file?
2011-08-12T18:37:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	Are you saying you can not go from one console tty to another?
2011-08-12T18:38:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	Like Ctrl-Alt-F6   &  Ctrl-Alt-F7  ?
2011-08-12T18:38:00.000Z	JakeR003	usr13	if i use switch user it ask for a password to unlock screen - ctrl + alt + Fx is not working at all
2011-08-12T18:40:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	I'm not sure what you are asking.  Ctrl-Alt-F6 should take you to tty6 and Ctrl-Alt-F5 should take you to tty5  If not, there is something basically wrong with your system.
2011-08-12T18:41:00.000Z	usr13	JakeR003	But yes, for sure, if you switch to another user, you will need to provide a password for that user.
