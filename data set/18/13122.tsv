2006-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	arcade	Subhuman	Except, of course, that KDE is easier to use, way more powerfull, got a faster development cycle, and so forth ..
2006-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	Subhuman	arcade	but it looks like crap, horrible config panel, more buttons/harder to use.... and so forth :P
2006-05-27T05:18:00.000Z	arcade	Subhuman	Got a more intuitive interface, great config panels, more buttons and functionality, easier to contribute to (especially as a translator).
2006-05-27T05:18:00.000Z	Subhuman	arcade	I used KDE for the first few months of my linux life, but once moving to gnome i couldnt go back.
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	arcade	Subhuman	I first used twm, then fvwm2, then afterstep - then went on to using KDE 1.x ;)
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	arcade	Subhuman	Been using KDE ever since.
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	Subhuman	arcade	well if you've never tried gnome dont knock it :D
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	arcade	Subhuman	I've also had my run ins with gnome, but I really didn't like the experience.
