2011-12-12T03:01:00.000Z	CHABI		so I'm trying to set up a vpn between my Oneiric Laptop and my Windows 7 desktop. The connection works, but the remote desktop vieweronly returns a blank black screen. Anyone able to help me figure out what's going on?
2011-12-12T03:02:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	hm.. i think you mix up some things... do you want vpn or vnc?
2011-12-12T03:04:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	do you want to control the other computer remotely?
2011-12-12T03:05:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	ok, first of, vpn is "virual private network" it is for establishing secure network connections, not more not less... it got not too much to do with remote control
2011-12-12T03:06:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	except if you might want to secure your remote communication
2011-12-12T03:06:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	what you want now is a software the manages the remote control
2011-12-12T03:06:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	so what you want is  program called vnc on your windows computer and vnc on your linux compter
2011-12-12T03:07:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	is responsible for sending the screen of the windows computer to your linux computer and seding the keyboard input from linux to windows
2011-12-12T03:07:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	i don't konw vinigre
2011-12-12T03:08:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	vnc is the best know program in that area
2011-12-12T03:08:00.000Z	CHABI	mister	makes sense sofar. Vinigre is Oneiric's built in remote desktop viewer
2011-12-12T03:08:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	i am not sure if the linux desktop viewer will work with windows
2011-12-12T03:09:00.000Z	CHABI	mister	vinigre has a vcn protocol
2011-12-12T03:10:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	i was never in the situation to remote control a windows computer from linux ... once i was but the i used teamviewer ... it's a quick and dirty solution
2011-12-12T03:11:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	if you are sure that the remoteviewer can handle windows then head on... i am sure there is a good tutoral or how-to in the interwebs
2011-12-12T03:11:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	good night
2011-12-12T03:11:00.000Z	mister	CHABI	have to o to bed ;)
2011-12-12T03:11:00.000Z	CHABI	mister	thanks for the help
