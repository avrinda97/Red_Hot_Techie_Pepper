2012-08-19T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	http://sourceforge.net/projects/remastersys/files/  looks dead
2012-11-09T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	use your backups
2012-11-09T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	why is there no backup if the data is important?
2012-11-09T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	try foremost
2012-11-09T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	I suggest you revise your backup procedure, it seems to detroy data.....
2012-11-09T04:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	unmount the partition, you will need a partition mounted writable to put ALL the files on there that it comes across
2012-11-09T05:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	if you are using foremost, you want the partition unmounted
2012-11-09T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jagosix	try foremost on the unmounted partition
