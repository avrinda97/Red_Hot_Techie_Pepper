2008-05-14T03:07:00.000Z	negge		why does the latest set of updates require a restart?
2008-05-14T03:07:00.000Z	negge		that's not normal right
2008-05-14T03:08:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	it's very normal
2008-05-14T03:08:00.000Z	negge	makkbe	never happened to be before
2008-05-14T03:08:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	some updates requires a restart

2008-05-14T03:11:00.000Z	negge	makkbe	you know why I get this when trying to update again:
2008-05-14T03:14:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	do a apt-cache policy openssh-client openssh-server and you will see why
2008-05-14T03:16:00.000Z	negge	makkbe	okay
2008-05-14T03:17:00.000Z	negge	makkbe	can you take a look at it if I paste it to pastebin?
2008-05-14T03:17:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	sure

2008-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	basically, it has to do with the priorities of the packages
2008-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	what you can do is install both packages manually
2008-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	with sudo apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server
2008-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	negge	makkbe	I'll try that
2008-05-14T03:21:00.000Z	negge	makkbe	it worked when I used the GUI:)
2008-05-14T03:22:00.000Z	makkbe	negge	ok, goodie
