2007-02-02T15:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	And / or mplayer and all the plugins.
2007-02-02T15:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Yes.
2007-02-02T15:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	pretty much, yes, for the newest WMV vids you will need w32codecs also.
2007-02-02T15:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	The ubotu link explains everything very well.
2007-05-19T14:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	sudo
2007-05-19T14:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Use sudo -s
2007-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	What chipset is your wireless card?
2007-05-31T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Your BIOS password can be bypassed by using the recovery password most BIOS's have, then your GRUB pass with a grub floppy and your login using single user mode :)
2007-05-31T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	What do you mean by "startup password" ?
2007-05-31T11:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Anywhere :)
2007-06-28T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Have you tried installing msttcorefonts ?
2007-06-28T05:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Yes
2007-06-28T05:59:00.000Z	illriginal	Jordan_U	is there a site that has different fonts for linux? Artistic like fonts as well?
2007-06-28T06:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	AFIK any font can be used in Linux
2007-06-28T06:01:00.000Z	illriginal	Jordan_U	doesn't it have to be a certain font type?...
2007-06-28T06:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illriginal	Considering that you can use Microsoft's fonts in Linux I would assume you could use anyone's, but I don't know much about fonts
