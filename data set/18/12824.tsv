2006-03-05T17:01:00.000Z	rupan3	CyCloBot	turn on all the debugging.. its on one of the pages, two settings
2006-03-05T17:01:00.000Z	rupan3	CyCloBot	then run your install in expert mode
2006-03-05T17:02:00.000Z	rupan3	CyCloBot	and disable the last 5 or so options, and it will detect your cdrom drive as a floppy
2006-03-05T17:02:00.000Z	rupan3	CyCloBot	at least, that's what it did for me
