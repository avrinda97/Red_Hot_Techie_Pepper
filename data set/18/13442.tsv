2005-12-03T17:47:00.000Z	Astxist		eww that's alot of ports :
2005-12-03T17:47:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	maybe less ports, but can i do that? like put a range? coz in the gui it doesnt let me
2005-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	but later on, after i edit the line, firestarter starts normally..
2005-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	what prog are you using?
2005-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	firestarter
2005-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	that needs all those ports that is
2005-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	but firestarter is a firewall?
2005-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	bittornado, doesnt need that many perse
2005-12-03T17:49:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	it only really needs one
2005-12-03T17:49:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	they do that to make blocking hard and avoid other things using ports
2005-12-03T17:50:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	you can configure the range for bittornado make a smaller one you don't need one that large
2005-12-03T17:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	ok... i guess i can just narrow its range to 10 ports
2005-12-03T17:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	nevertheless though, can i put a port range for firestarter?
2005-12-03T17:50:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	:)
2005-12-03T17:51:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	or i guess i can make 10 seperate entries... k thanks
2005-12-03T17:51:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	well I can seem to use a range without it complaining
2005-12-03T17:51:00.000Z	Astxist	pppoe_dude	I'll check it for you just a sec
2005-12-03T17:55:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Astxist	its ok... i looked it up on google before, there didnt seem to be anything referring to port ranges, so i tried iptables... but now im just gonna use 10 entries to be on the safe side
