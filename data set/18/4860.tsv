2009-04-02T05:49:00.000Z	dublisk		Hi, I downloaded ubuntu 64 bit version, and it says ubuntu AMD_64, is there not an IA_64 version as well?
2009-04-02T05:50:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	AMD is for x86 processors... I'm not really sure what your asking
2009-04-02T05:50:00.000Z	dublisk	m0se5	IA_64 is intels competing 64 bit archetecture I thought
2009-04-02T05:51:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	oh.. ok, they arcitector types used for the linux kernel isn't exact to the brand, just the type.. AMD and Intel make x86... short answer.. you have the right one.
2009-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	sudo apt-get linux-source
2009-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	oops... sudo apt-get install linux-source
2009-04-02T06:17:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	apt-get install linux-source linux-headers  ...second time I said it.
2009-04-02T06:19:00.000Z	dublisk	m0se5	couldn't find package linux-source ...second time I said it.
2009-04-02T06:21:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	lol Did you do this command? "sudo apt-get install linux-source ...second time I said it."   cause that's funny... Don't execute every command you see... there's a popular one that will render your systen unusable... goes something like this rm -rf /bla
2009-04-02T06:22:00.000Z	dublisk	m0se5	no, I was making a wise crack
2009-04-02T06:32:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	yes. lol and I'm all about the wise cracks... It's kinda nice to be here again. I've been gone a few years now.
2009-04-02T06:35:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	honestly... sudo apt-get install linux-source linux-headers
2009-04-02T06:35:00.000Z	dublisk	m0se5	I don't understand whats complicated about what I said
2009-04-02T06:36:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	me either.. so direct and precisely about one thing too.
2009-04-02T06:37:00.000Z	dublisk	m0se5	Do you think I'm just making it up that that apt-get is not finding linux-sources?
2009-04-02T06:37:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	A seemingly stupid question but are you pasting that command into a terminal?
2009-04-02T06:38:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	I'm not thinking anything about it. I just answered a question.
2009-04-02T06:38:00.000Z	m0se5	dublisk	+1 internetz to me
