2011-05-02T21:37:00.000Z	KM0201		iceflatline: you obviously don't get satire... i'm using 11.04
2011-05-02T21:37:00.000Z	KM0201		oops, iceroot see above
2011-05-02T21:38:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	and what is the problem about going to ubuntu.com and download it?
2011-05-02T21:38:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	read what i said again, and really put your thinking cap on
2011-05-02T21:39:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	i dont get what you want
2011-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	id on't want anything... you obviouskly didn't get it, and explaining it to you would just make you laugh at yourself.
2011-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	yeah just stop your strange conversation here
2011-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	i did.. you kept it up
2011-05-28T01:00:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	every iso works from usb
2011-05-28T01:01:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	the iso works, but installing from them requiers some workarounds... for instance, the alt. cd... since it errors out if it can't mount the CD, so you have to mount your USB as a cd.
2011-05-28T01:02:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	why should the content of the iso mount itself again?
2011-05-28T01:02:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	have you used the alternate cd from a usb?
2011-05-28T01:02:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	i am using everything from usb because my pcs dont have cdroms
2011-05-28T01:03:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	have you used the alternate cd, from USB.... i know the live cd's work, and presumably, the mini iso works
2011-05-28T01:04:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	This step is only needed for the Alternate install CD and Ubuntu 6.10 or older.

2011-05-28T01:04:00.000Z	KM0201	iceroot	dunno, it's never worked for me w/ any ubuntu distro...if it works for you guys, thats great.... but it dind't work for me w/ 11.04 either.
2011-05-28T01:05:00.000Z	iceroot	KM0201	ok, 11.04 is just an upgrade here, first install was 8.04 and then getting the updates
