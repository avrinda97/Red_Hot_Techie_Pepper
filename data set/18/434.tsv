2012-02-19T21:14:00.000Z	sungsam		I know, you are busy, but I'll repeat myself:
2012-02-19T21:14:00.000Z	sungsam		ok, guys, so I asked you about my ext2 error, because I was freaking out, that I've been hacked, giving this example: http://whitestar.linuxbox.org/pipermail/exploits/2006-November/000006.html
2012-02-19T21:14:00.000Z	sungsam		but if as a ubuntu user, we were hacked, how can we tell? What'd be the first clue?
2012-02-19T21:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	I"ve seen attempted hacks in my logs of ssh activity
2012-02-19T21:16:00.000Z	sungsam		How could you tell, it was an attempted hack?
2012-02-19T21:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	after attacks were easy to see when my web index page changed and again looked at the apache2 logs to see where they had gone
2012-02-19T21:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	attempted I see many failed logins
2012-02-19T21:17:00.000Z	sungsam	sacarlson	sounds logic. I was more curious about a private system.
2012-02-19T21:17:00.000Z	sungsam	sacarlson	or anybody, how secure is UFW?
2012-02-19T21:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	mine is private but it's very dependent one what ports and programs you have active
2012-02-19T21:18:00.000Z	sungsam	sacarlson	when I nmap my LAN it always states all 1000 ports are closed.
2012-02-19T21:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	 netstat -pant will tell what is listening
2012-02-19T21:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	and to be open is normaly something you must add unless pnp is active on your router then I guess anything is posible
2012-02-19T21:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	and by the way there are about 65000 different ports as I recall
2012-02-19T21:22:00.000Z	sungsam		holly crap, I have and established connection with some weired Bulgarian ip!!
2012-02-19T21:22:00.000Z	sungsam		in whois it says role LIR ADMIN. What deos it mean?
2012-02-19T21:22:00.000Z	sungsam		how can I disconnect it?
2012-02-19T21:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	sungsam	you sure it isn't part of your irc connections?  it should also state what app is it connected to
