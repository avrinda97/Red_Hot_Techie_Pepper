2007-09-20T08:58:00.000Z	sandy		<predaeus> then tell me what to do
2007-09-20T08:59:00.000Z	sandy		<predaeus> but i dont have any firewall software in my system can you tell me what to do or how to check
2007-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	nah I meant, did you change anything or did you just install fresh?
2007-09-20T08:57:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	sounds like you are behind a firewall that blocks http.
2007-09-20T08:59:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	did you do a fresh install?
2007-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	sandy	predaeus	ya i know but i have to keep this system
2007-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	did you install Ubuntu yesterday and it is not working, or did you use it for some time and it suddenly doesn't work anymore?
2007-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	sandy	predaeus	ya i have install in 2 week ago
2007-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	sandy	predaeus	i used it for some time
2007-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	I am not sure but maybe there is a proxy setting in gnome that might cause that. Did you configure a proxy?
2007-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	sandy	predaeus	i think the problem came from a site . I used one site to download more then 1 file from rapid share
2007-09-20T09:05:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	sounds very unlikely, the browser should not be able to change system wide proxy settings. But if you are using firefox check Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Network to see if a proxy is enabled.
2007-09-20T09:06:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	are you using Firefox?
2007-09-20T09:09:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	Then check Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Network to see if a proxy is enabled. Also run "gnome-network-preferences" and check if a gnome wide network proxy is enabled.
2007-09-20T09:09:00.000Z	sandy	predaeus	they can not changed
2007-09-20T09:10:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	it should be set on direct connection and not using a proxy.
2007-09-20T09:11:00.000Z	predaeus	sandy	if both programs are not using a proxy, then I don't know. Might be a different problem or a different setting or maybe your ISP.
