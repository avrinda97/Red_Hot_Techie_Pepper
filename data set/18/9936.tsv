2007-03-10T07:39:00.000Z	atomiku		What command shall I do to copy my linux / partition to another partition?
2007-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	atomiku		Could cp do the job properly?
2007-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	atomiku		rsync eh
2007-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	atomiku		Because the thing is...
2007-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	atomiku		My hard drive is faulty, got the SMART error, failure imminent etc etc
2007-03-10T07:41:00.000Z	atomiku		normally when I try I access the hard drive, the lil light on my box stays on and normally linux goes into read only mode
2007-03-10T07:41:00.000Z	atomiku		Yeah
2007-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	atomiku		I'm not yet ready to accept it may be permanently f**ked, but im gonna move everything on the faulty hard drive to another hard drive and try and fix it another time
2007-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	atomiku		So.... rsync.... lemme take a look into this
2007-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	atomiku		Yeah
2007-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	PirateHead	atomiku	take a look at Dirvish as well. It uses rsync and provides functionality on top of it
2007-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	PirateHead	atomiku	have no clue whether that's off-topic concerning your question =D
2007-03-10T07:43:00.000Z	PirateHead	atomiku	does LILO load it correctly?
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	PirateHead	atomiku	in grub, try booting failsafe.
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	atomiku	PirateHead	i did.
2007-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	atomiku	PirateHead	What failsafe ?
2007-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	PirateHead	atomiku	I think it's called "failsafe GNOME" or something.
2007-04-20T08:38:00.000Z	PirateHead	atomiku	run a recovery mode boot?
