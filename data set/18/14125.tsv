2008-12-26T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Define picky
2008-12-26T11:18:00.000Z	moses	Flannel	i dont want gnome to rape my resources
2008-12-26T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	That has nothing to do with the kernel
2008-12-26T11:19:00.000Z	moses	Flannel	well what is killing my resources on my current ver of xubuntu?
2008-12-26T11:19:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	I have no idea.  But the kernel won't have anything to do with gnome, or whatever else, using your resources
2008-12-26T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Yes. http://www.xubuntu.org/get  the mirrors will have both the Desktop and the alternate CD
2008-12-26T11:28:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Please stop using the enter key as punctuation
2008-12-26T11:29:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Is this an installed system?
2008-12-26T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Alright, reboot, and at the GRUB menu (right after the POST screen, you may need to hit escape to see it) choose the recovery console.  From there, you can cat /etc/passwd, and take a look at the usernames on the system.  Type "init 2" to finish the boot process and get back to the login screen
2008-12-26T11:32:00.000Z	moses	Flannel	there are several options; resume, repair, root, xfix
2008-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Are you booting to the liveCD?
2008-12-26T11:34:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	You're booting ot that CD though?
2008-12-26T11:34:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	You get those options at the grub menu?
2008-12-26T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	moses	Right.  You want to choose the recovery mode kernel at the GRUB menu
2008-12-26T11:38:00.000Z	moses	Flannel	when i boot to that recovery it gives me those options
