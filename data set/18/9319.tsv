2008-10-02T08:55:00.000Z	Shak-		hey guys, I compiled a custom iwl4965 module (wifi) but its really unstable, any idea how I could load over the old one that came with the kernel?
2008-10-02T08:56:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	how did u compile it?
2008-10-02T08:56:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	using compat-wireless?
2008-10-02T08:56:00.000Z	Shak-	usser	yep
2008-10-02T08:56:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	so it was compat-wireless?
2008-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	Shak-	usser	well I used compat-wireless to compile it so yes
2008-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	do you still have the folder with the compat-wireless sources from which u installed?
2008-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	Shak-	usser	yes I do
2008-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	if u have it just do sudo make uninstall
2008-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	Shak-		oh
2008-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	from within it
2008-10-02T08:58:00.000Z	Shak-	usser	then my old module will reload itself?
2008-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	compat-wireless doesnt overwrite native modules it puts them in the update folder, and after you uninstall that folder will be deleted and the kernel will revert back to old modules
2008-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	you'll have to rmmod and modprobe of course
2008-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	Shak-	usser	ah I see, should I rmmod iwl4965 first?
2008-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	Shak-		ok
2008-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	Shak-		k here goes
2008-10-02T09:00:00.000Z	usser	Shak-	yea rmmod iwl4945 mac80211 cfg80211 led_class in that order
