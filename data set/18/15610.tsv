2005-02-22T09:40:00.000Z	Tuxadermist	Dreamer3	my Gaim dies too, I found feeding it helps, on a serious note try running it from a terminal and watching what happens maybe
2005-02-22T09:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Tuxadermist	nothing useful from terminal
2005-02-22T09:41:00.000Z	Tuxadermist	Dreamer3	well at least you got a good gaim joke outta it. hehe
2005-02-22T09:42:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Tuxadermist	now that's kind of upsetting
2005-02-22T09:42:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Tuxadermist	reinstalling the .deb fixed it *looks upset*
2005-02-22T09:42:00.000Z	Tuxadermist	Dreamer3	so it just crapped out ?
2005-02-22T09:43:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Tuxadermist	i hate it when "windows solutions" work on linux... make me feel not good
2005-02-22T09:43:00.000Z	Tuxadermist	Dreamer3	hehe, no doubt
