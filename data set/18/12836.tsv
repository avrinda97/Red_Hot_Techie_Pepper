2006-03-03T10:57:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	why not?
2006-03-03T10:57:00.000Z	tane|	amphi	tried but wont work
2006-03-03T10:58:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	you tried the method I suggested above?

2006-03-03T10:58:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	and what error did you get?
2006-03-03T10:59:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	don't worry, i'm sure we've all heard the word before
2006-03-03T11:00:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	you can't mount / when you boot from cd?
2006-03-03T11:23:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	that is not sensible ;)
2006-03-03T11:25:00.000Z	amphi	tane|	the sysresccd.org iso is very useful for this sort of thing
