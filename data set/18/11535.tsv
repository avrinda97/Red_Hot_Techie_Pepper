2007-08-28T06:52:00.000Z	Cin		hi can I change firefox to use mplayer instead of totem movie player?
2007-08-28T06:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	remove the totem firefox plugin
2007-08-28T06:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	1 sec I have a good link for this
2007-08-28T06:52:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	is it possible to use mplayer in the browser instead?
2007-08-28T06:53:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	k
2007-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	totem is nice and all the progress bar doesn't actually do anything? all you can do is pause... O_o
2007-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	mplayer is soo much better
2007-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	I agree
2007-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	does Stage6 work with this method?
2007-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	also has a nice right click save as feature for embedded browser vids
2007-08-28T06:56:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	oh, disregard that last question; mentioned in the article ho ho
2007-08-28T06:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	yeah just for future reference as there is a handy bug fix in that thread :D
2007-08-28T06:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	you wil most likely need to do it yourself.. I dont think this has been addressed in gutsy yet afaik
2007-08-28T06:57:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	I'm on Feisty
2007-08-28T07:21:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	sweet, got it to open in mplayer
2007-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Cin	nice one...is it behaving the way you need it to
2007-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	I think so. it opens up an mplayer window, so then I have access to all the mplayer cool stuff
2007-08-28T07:23:00.000Z	Cin	Paddy_EIRE	I'm using that firefox add-on
