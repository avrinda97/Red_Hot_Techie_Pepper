2005-03-31T15:58:00.000Z	fsantos		Hi everyone! I'm trying to use Citrix ICA client and keep getting this error. /usr/lib/ICAClient/wfica: error while loading shared libraries: libXaw.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	raetsel	fsantos	did you try looking in the synaptic pkg mgr for the libXaw?
2005-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	raetsel	fsantos	Just tried a quick check for the libXaw ver 7 is installed, ver 6 is available but not installed
2005-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	raetsel		assuming that is the right library
2005-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	fsantos	raetsel	I know this is present in this RPM: XFree86-libs-3.3.2pl2-1.i386.rpm
2005-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	fsantos		Let me check...
2005-03-31T16:03:00.000Z	raetsel		Hmmm fsantos sounds like could be a library path thing then, though can you find the files other than in the rpm? check LD_LIBRARY_PATH maybe?
2005-03-31T16:04:00.000Z	fsantos	raetsel	how do I check if a certain lib is installed?
2005-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	fsantos		ok
2005-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	fsantos	raetsel	I have run a find and got libXaw.so.7
2005-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	raetsel		as soon as a computer system has to talk to paper you are asking for trouble :o)
2005-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	raetsel		fsanstos: do you have the synaptic GUI package mgr?
2005-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	fsantos	raetsel	yes. I'm looking at it but can't find which package contains that lib... The RPM I mentioned eralier was found using google but I do not want to install it as I may break something.
2005-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	raetsel	fsantos	in the synaptic mgr just click search and enter libaw6
2005-03-31T16:11:00.000Z	raetsel		it has the lovely ubuntu family circle by it in on my system fsantos so it part of the main ( I think )
2005-03-31T16:12:00.000Z	raetsel		 yes gaim supports MSN but aMSN is a nicer interface
2005-03-31T16:13:00.000Z	raetsel		Well it's as ugly as the windoze version I guess, Spiral :o)
2005-03-31T16:13:00.000Z	fsantos	raetsel	Dude... You just made my day! Thank you for showing me the obvious... ;-) I was trying to browse for it and couldn't find it anywhere. Search worked just fine! Excellent!
