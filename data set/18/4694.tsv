2011-06-11T17:50:00.000Z	MIH1406		Hi, I want compression application with more options than the FileRoler
2011-06-11T17:51:00.000Z	MIH1406		I want a GUI
2011-06-11T17:51:00.000Z	MIH1406		I do not have time for learning the shell
2011-06-11T17:52:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	what options are you looking for in that application?
2011-06-11T17:54:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	zip files are for compression AND archive
2011-06-11T17:54:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	why would you want to avoid the compression?
2011-06-11T17:55:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	large jpg files?
2011-06-11T17:56:00.000Z	MIH1406	julie	large number of scanned documents with 600 DPI
2011-06-11T17:57:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	using zip is the simplest solution no matter what if you don't want to use the shell
2011-06-11T17:58:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	the price to pay for compressing is probably very minimal (and so far I don't see why you said they were compressed)
2011-06-11T18:00:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	everyone here knows what a JPG is
2011-06-11T18:01:00.000Z	MIH1406	julie	do they also know they are compressed?
2011-06-11T18:02:00.000Z	MIH1406	julie	I am actually waiting the process to finish! :)
2011-06-11T18:02:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	FYI jpg is a more compressed image file format than BMP, but is still compressible
2011-06-11T18:05:00.000Z	MIH1406	julie	it is compressible but it is time consuming with large files :)
2011-06-11T18:05:00.000Z	MIH1406	julie	I am still waiting!!
2011-06-11T18:06:00.000Z	julie	MIH1406	go take a coffee
2011-06-11T18:08:00.000Z	MIH1406	julie	jrib thanks
