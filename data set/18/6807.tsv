2008-03-26T12:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	I'm still a bit unsure about dealing with NTFS. I'd have a backup if you do decide to try. (But you should already have a backup right;))
2008-03-26T12:51:00.000Z	voxluna	DistroJockey	yeah I did make a full bkp before I resized the partition.  I had been playing with Wubi but then did the "real" thing.
2008-03-26T12:52:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	ntfs3g is pretty good these days though from what I here
2008-03-26T12:52:00.000Z	voxluna	DistroJockey	I had heard in the past (in kernel notes, or something) that it wasn't reliable.  not sure where exactly.
2008-03-26T12:52:00.000Z	voxluna	DistroJockey	ideally I might be able to use my D:\Documents\Thunderbird\ across both platforms, for example
2008-03-26T12:53:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	*nod* I would so it is fairly reliable, as long as both systems are shut down cleanly
2008-03-26T12:53:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	would say^
2008-03-26T12:53:00.000Z	voxluna		I'll just be more vigilant in my DVD backups, I guess
2008-03-26T12:54:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	never hurts :)
2008-03-26T12:54:00.000Z	voxluna		wonder if I could rig this box to do remote bkps onto the server's DLT?  ;)
2008-03-26T12:54:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	probably :)
2008-03-26T12:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	rsync would be worth a look in that case
2008-03-26T12:56:00.000Z	voxluna	DistroJockey	it'd be nice to get the laptop backed up somehow, it has a lot of user-downloaded music, but it's XP
2008-03-26T12:56:00.000Z	voxluna		I tried Wubi, it blew up on the Acer.  ugh.
2008-03-26T12:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	External USB HDD's are nice. Sorry Wubi didn't work. (not tried that yet)
2008-03-26T12:59:00.000Z	voxluna	DistroJockey	yeah that I use on this box, an internal drive that just sits there ready for bkps.  only thing is, it is 1) not removeable and 2) runs all the time.
2008-03-26T12:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	voxluna	Western Digital ones I like better than Seagate, due to heat issues  (those being the top 2 manufactures)
2008-03-26T12:59:00.000Z	voxluna	DistroJockey	I suppose an external is really the fastest though.
