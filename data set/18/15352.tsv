2005-04-07T10:50:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	I followed that guide, but even after adding all the necesary repositories, I get errors when trying apt-get (some of the dependent libraries are not available it seems)
2005-04-07T10:51:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 i getting it now just fine
2005-04-07T10:51:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 apt-get update
2005-04-07T10:54:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	I did do that, still having the problem. Specifically, it says that libarts, libdvdread, and others have unresolvable dependencies.  Are you using warty and trying to install the 386 version?
2005-04-07T10:58:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	any clue what my problem might be?
2005-04-07T10:59:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 you have broadband
2005-04-07T11:01:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 chage your repositories to hoary then and get lastest ubuntu
2005-04-07T11:03:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	Is that a wise choice at this point anyways? I will not experience other problems from updating, will I?
2005-04-07T11:04:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 yes
2005-04-07T11:19:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	Thank you for your help, but I am new to Linux and I think I will stick with Warty because I assume there is more documentation about it/problems with it.
2005-04-07T11:20:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 in one week hoary will be released
2005-04-07T11:20:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 its really nice now
2005-04-07T11:21:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	I just mean things like ubuntuguide.org, they seem to be geared towards warty, you know?
2005-04-07T11:21:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 it will change soon
2005-04-07T11:22:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	*sigh* fine
2005-04-07T11:22:00.000Z	geneo93	kpeterson	 most everybody here has made the change
2005-04-07T11:25:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	Once I change my repositories list, how do i get everything to update?
2005-04-07T11:28:00.000Z	kpeterson	geneo93	sorry could have looked that one up.  I sure hope MPlayer install works after this :-P
