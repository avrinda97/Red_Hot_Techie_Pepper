2008-02-29T18:42:00.000Z	brobostigon		good afternoon everyone
2008-02-29T18:43:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	hello. although it's mid morning here. :)
2008-03-04T18:46:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	just add the proper nameserver into resolv.conf, and then change its permission so it can only be read by anyb ody, including root, tht means it will never be changed by anything
2008-03-04T18:46:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	the dhcp client won't reset the permissions if needed?
2008-03-04T18:46:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	it cant change the permissions
2008-03-04T18:48:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	technically, if the client was run as root it could if the code had support to , but I'll try it out and see. Thanks.
2008-03-04T18:48:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	it works, because its what i have done
2008-03-04T18:49:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	sounds like a plan to me then. :)
2008-03-04T18:52:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	looks like it did reset it. set to 444, reconnected to the wifi ap and now the resolv.conf is 644
2008-03-04T18:53:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	how do i look up the permissons on my resolv.conf, so i can tell you what to set it too??
2008-03-04T18:54:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	from a terminal, you can do ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
2008-03-04T18:56:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 23 2008-03-04 13:45 /etc/resolv.conf
2008-03-04T18:59:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	that says that root can write to it. looks like the client knows how to modify the permissions to allow itself to update the file.
2008-03-04T19:00:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	well i dont kn ow what else to say, you situation is the same as mine, and can only suggest what i did.
2008-03-04T19:01:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	thanks anyway. :)
2008-03-04T19:02:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	can you change it permissions so that even root cant change it,
2008-03-04T19:03:00.000Z	waylandbill	brobostigon	that's what I did. but the network manager runs as root and probably calls chmod() from the standard lib before writing out the file.
2008-03-04T19:03:00.000Z	brobostigon	waylandbill	ok, was just an idea.
