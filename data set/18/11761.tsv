2008-05-18T22:32:00.000Z	yacc	Jack_Sparrow	it's the fastest way to backup a DVD. OTOH, it's the most "stupid", and worse, since my Ubuntu install it stopped working.
2008-05-18T22:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yacc	YOu are not by chance using a fat32 to store the temp or anything are you
2008-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	yacc	Jack_Sparrow	mplayer -dumpstream is the next on the scale. Slightly more clever about what it's doing, but potentially a bit slower ;(
2008-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yacc	I use k9copy and I am in no rush ...

2008-05-18T22:35:00.000Z	yacc	Jack_Sparrow	ogle can play most DVDs, but offers no option to capture the mpeg PS :(
2008-05-18T22:36:00.000Z	yacc	Jack_Sparrow	The only DVD player that knows about navigation and that does that I know about is VLC, ...

2008-05-18T22:36:00.000Z	yacc	Jack_Sparrow	cnat?
2008-05-18T22:37:00.000Z	yacc	Jack_Sparrow	Well, VLC is good but 1x slow.
