2010-04-29T12:20:00.000Z	iceroot	wildbat	it has a nice usability (not like xfce4) and is using less ressources then xfce4
2011-07-18T01:53:00.000Z	iceroot	wildbat	maybe something like drbd
2011-07-18T01:54:00.000Z	iceroot	wildbat	http://www.drbd.org/  but maybe a overkill
2011-07-18T01:56:00.000Z	wildbat	iceroot	something like that ~ but that's for block device ~ i need something folder level. but good to know that too ;>
2011-07-18T01:57:00.000Z	iceroot	wildbat	the folders are on the same machine?
2011-07-18T01:57:00.000Z	wildbat	iceroot	nope

2011-07-18T03:25:00.000Z	wildbat	iceroot	that;s ntfs ~ he need to change mount options
2011-07-18T03:26:00.000Z	iceroot	wildbat	ah yes you are right
2011-07-25T02:04:00.000Z	iceroot	wildbat	its depending on your vga + ram, has nothing to do with the mainboard
