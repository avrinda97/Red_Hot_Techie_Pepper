2011-05-16T06:11:00.000Z	squonk		Hi guys.
2011-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	squonk		I was curious about that... I love Chrome on Win, but this build came with Firefox
2011-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	it can be removed. Its one of the first things I uninstall
2011-05-16T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	yes, very
2011-05-16T06:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	its a billion times more powerful than DOS
2011-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	its closer topowershell
2011-05-17T11:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	indeed :-)
2011-05-17T11:20:00.000Z	squonk	ActionParsnip	the build I have installed is the gnome build.
2011-05-17T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	you can use any irc client you desire, even ones which use KDE
2011-05-17T11:23:00.000Z	squonk	ActionParsnip	good good, I can continue my explorations then. I am having a ball discovering the apps.
2011-05-17T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	very healthy, you may find apps you prefer which differ from the default
2011-05-17T11:25:00.000Z	squonk	ActionParsnip	well I thought I'd muck around with it from the wubi and then I'll see about actually installing on a dedicated box.
2011-05-17T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	best way to learn. Sadly wubi is harder to fix if you super break it. It's performance is also directly impacted by the fragmentation in NTFS
2011-05-17T11:30:00.000Z	squonk	ActionParsnip	I suspect that is the price one pays for the self installation package, i.e. since it's largely generic you are limited, whereas one who compiles their own kernel and sets their own scripts to run on the system will of course, fair better. Didn't know about the NTFS fragmentation issue, so is FAT32 the better for linux then?
2011-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	your wubi "disk" is stored in your windows partition as a file. As the data fragments (as NTFS always does) it will fragment the wubi file, making the ubuntu OS run slower. A true install doesn't suffer fragmentation due to the nature of Ext4
2011-05-17T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	i don't recommend FAT based filesystems at all unless it absolutely cannot be avoided
2011-05-17T11:35:00.000Z	squonk	ActionParsnip	Then my instincts are correct. I can cut my teeth on this build and as my knowledge and confidence increases I can actually do the dedicated system pure ubuntu.
2011-05-17T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	squonk	sounds like a plan :-)
