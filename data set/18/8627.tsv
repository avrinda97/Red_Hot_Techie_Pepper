2011-01-26T23:56:00.000Z	abstrakt		anyone have recommendations for size of system partition?
2011-01-26T23:56:00.000Z	bastidrazor	abstrakt	if you're using a seperate home then / 10GB if you plan doing an upgrade in the future.
2011-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	really? 10G is all you need for a system drive?
2011-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	I will be running a LAMP server (just for local dev) etc
2011-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	so I'm going to possibly have large files like databases and webroot folders
2011-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	I mean, if I can tell MySQL to store the literal db files on my /home partition then I guess everything is cool
2011-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	bastidrazor	abstrakt	you're lack of information on what the 'system' would doing resulted in a vague answer.
2011-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	no worries
2011-01-27T00:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	I'm not accusing you of anything bad :)
2011-01-27T00:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	so now with more information, what would you suggest
2011-01-27T00:02:00.000Z	bastidrazor	abstrakt	most desktops would be fine with a / of 10GB :)
2011-01-27T00:03:00.000Z	bastidrazor	abstrakt	how much do space do you expect to use? 30-40GB worth? if you have the available space then leave yourself lots of room
2011-01-27T00:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	yeah, unfortunately space is actually a little bit tight on this system, dual boot with XP
2011-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	I guess, if I really look at it objectively, I don't think that my /var/www folder ever exceeds much more than 1-2G
2011-07-29T22:29:00.000Z	bastidrazor	abstrakt	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2011-07-29T22:29:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	thx
2011-07-29T22:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	bastidrazor	sweet that works quite well, thanks :)
2011-07-29T22:30:00.000Z	bastidrazor	abstrakt	you're welcome.
