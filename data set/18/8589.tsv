2007-07-27T10:46:00.000Z	devang		hey what's a GUI program on Ubuntu for burning image files?
2007-07-27T10:47:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	r-click the image, burn
2007-07-27T10:49:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	as i said, right-click the image in nautilus (the file manager), there is a "write image"
2007-07-27T10:49:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	in that case, install the kubuntu-desktop package
2007-07-27T10:49:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	I can't right click and burn the image as an image it just burns the file
2007-07-27T10:50:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	nautilus should have a write image option when you r-click an .iso
2007-07-27T10:50:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	or the old-fashioned way, cdrecord foo
2007-07-27T10:50:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	Nope just a write to disc which just writes the file
2007-07-27T10:51:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	that should write the image
2007-07-27T10:51:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	It didn't lol I wasted 4 discs trying 4 different ways
2007-07-27T10:58:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	what wifi card?  do you know?
2007-07-27T10:59:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	Atheros 5007eg at least that's what windows said and yes a laptop
2007-07-27T11:50:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	yeah, pretty much
2007-07-27T13:32:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	you meant opera>konqueror/safari>firefox>lynx>IE :)
2007-07-27T13:34:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	lol?
2007-07-27T13:40:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	I just googled jfgi.. lol i didn't know what it meant
2007-07-27T13:41:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	devang	for irony, it stands for "just f---ing google it"
2007-07-27T13:41:00.000Z	devang	ConstyXIV	yea lol when I said google it I meant i'd have to google it myself to find the features page of flock and stuff so it'd be quicker if the person themselves did it
