2009-04-08T04:32:00.000Z	Matson		Im running Hardy...
2009-04-08T04:32:00.000Z	Matson		:)
2009-04-08T04:33:00.000Z	Matson		the Ubuntu installer should tell the person what the name of the install they are installing
2009-04-08T04:33:00.000Z	Matson		if it did, it was not obvious enough, I just did it 6 times in a row
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Matson		what is the default MTA for ubuntu?
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Matson		I was using exim4 on debian
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	exim4 for debian postfix for ubuntu
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	either will work
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	if you already know exim4, i recommend sticking to it
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Matson	Titan8990	sure, but I want to go with whatever most people are using
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Matson	Titan8990	I've done all of em
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	why is that even a factor?
2009-04-08T04:36:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	I have add good experience with the exim4 mailing list....
2009-04-08T04:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	but anyways... postfix would be more popular in ubuntu because it is easier... many to most ubuntu users are new to linux
2009-04-08T04:41:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	like how?
2009-04-08T04:43:00.000Z	Matson	Titan8990	sort them by size
2009-04-08T04:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	Matson	you could use a bash script, not sure if someone has already released a utility to do it
