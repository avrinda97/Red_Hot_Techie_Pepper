2006-07-15T07:02:00.000Z	theBeno		On the new ubuntu installer, when do I set the root password?
2006-07-15T07:02:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	The root password is unset (therefore disabled) by default, for security reasons.
2006-07-15T07:02:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	We would encourage you to use "sudo" when you need root functionality:)
2006-07-15T07:03:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	That's pretty good I guess, but doesn't sudo have security risks?
2006-07-15T07:03:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	Like what?
2006-07-15T07:04:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	Not sure myself, but I've read some things on it.
2006-07-15T07:04:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	I think the idea for Ubuntu, is to stop users from running as root for their normal user.
2006-07-15T07:04:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	root user is disabled, so you cannot ssh in as root, etc. etc.
2006-07-15T07:05:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	Which leaves sudo as the only option to perform admin options. That's the way I see it anyway.
2006-07-15T07:05:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	Yeah, that's good for the average joe who will never use ssh, but I like my advanced features.
2006-07-15T07:07:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	If you do "sudo passwd", you can set the root password, which means you'll be able to login directly, or using su etc.
2006-07-15T07:08:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	Yeah, and I'll probably remove sudo.
2006-07-15T07:09:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	As Chousuke, you can use "sudo -s" to perform the same thing as "su". But, if you know plenty about Linux, you'd have already made up your mind about sudo vs su :)
2006-07-15T07:11:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	And I don't like su. ^_^
2006-07-15T07:11:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	sudo*
2006-07-15T07:11:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	Hehe fair enough, then you can use "sudo passwd" to re-enable it.
2006-07-15T07:15:00.000Z	theBeno	moogman	I run FreeBSD and gentoo systems, but just trying Ubuntu because it's the latest big thing.  Especially with LTS support etc.
2006-07-15T07:17:00.000Z	moogman	theBeno	Ah, nice to see the support having effect. You'll find Ubuntu "easier" than most other Linux/UNIX IMHO, if you stick with the way they want to do things
