2007-06-30T09:12:00.000Z	vladuz976		i am interested in buying a vaio series C and wanna make sure hardware is compatible
2007-06-30T09:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	Can you give some specs on the hardware? And are you buying this in store of online?
2007-06-30T09:13:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	in the store. they have choice of celeron or core duo
2007-06-30T09:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	Bring in a LiveCD :)
2007-06-30T09:14:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	the store? you think they'll let me do that?
2007-06-30T09:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	I have never tried it myself, but if you make it clear you are going to buy something?
2007-06-30T09:15:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	that's the problem i'm in japan and my japanese is very limited. they'll probably think i am crazy
2007-06-30T09:20:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	maybe i am better off buing a Dell online, at least that way i know it's working
2007-06-30T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	I definitely agree there :)
2007-07-15T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	There might be a better way but you could just use gnome-panel for a panel
2007-08-18T15:12:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	what's wrong with that
2007-08-18T15:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	Nothing, but this is a support channel, you want ubuntu-offtopic
2007-08-18T15:12:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	oh cool, thanks
2007-08-22T07:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	You can get pidgin from getdeb
2007-08-22T07:51:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	what is getdeb and what does pidgin have to do with gimp?
2007-08-22T07:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vladuz976	It means that I have official stayed up to late and need to go to sleep :)
2007-08-22T07:51:00.000Z	vladuz976	Jordan_U	oh ok
