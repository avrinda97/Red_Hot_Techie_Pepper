2011-02-06T16:32:00.000Z	Anubis1		hi
2011-02-06T16:33:00.000Z	Anubis1		i just upgraded some packages on my 1004LTS machine(kubuntu) and now i can see only some colored rectangles on my screen.
2011-02-06T16:33:00.000Z	Anubis1		i cant access any console
2011-02-06T16:33:00.000Z	Anubis1		what should i do ?
2011-02-06T16:34:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	So you cannot get to tty1 with Ctrl+Alt+F1 ?
2011-02-06T16:34:00.000Z	Anubis1	ysis	i tried already
2011-02-06T16:36:00.000Z	Anubis1		so, any idea ?
2011-02-06T16:37:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	So you're stuck in a unusable X11 session? You could try Alt+SysRq+R to get the keybord to raw mode. Then try Alt+F1 again.
2011-02-06T16:38:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	Alt+SysRq+K should kill X, but maybe it will just restart and give the same situation. I would disable autostarting X11 and try with startx first.
2011-02-06T16:39:00.000Z	Anubis1	ysis	i'm stucked in something. i don't know where. is there a way to restart in some interactive way and tell which services to start and which not >
2011-02-06T16:39:00.000Z	Anubis1		?
2011-02-06T16:41:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	So switching to raw mode didn't work?
2011-02-06T16:41:00.000Z	Anubis1	ysis	it didnt work at all
2011-02-06T16:41:00.000Z	Anubis1		it like being dead somehow
2011-02-06T16:42:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	Hmm, do you have ssh access to the machine? I don't know how to enable/disable services in ubuntu at boot time... In Gentoo I can use press "i" to get into interactive boot mode. Don't know if this works for ubuntu or kubuntu
2011-02-06T16:44:00.000Z	Anubis1	ysis	i know that "i" is entering in interactive mode (redhat) but i'm not sure if it's working on ubuntu/kukbuntu
2011-02-06T16:46:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	So did you try or google for ubuntu interactive boot mode? Sorry that I can't help more, but I never booted ubuntu interactively.
2011-02-06T16:46:00.000Z	ysis	Anubis1	You could also use a live cd to change the startup behavior I guess. But this is maybe a little fiddly.
