2005-11-29T08:51:00.000Z	Mabus06		can someone help me to update my emu10k1 drivers?
2005-11-29T08:51:00.000Z	Mabus06		I downloaded the tar file of the recent release, unarchived it, and I have a folder with a bunch of files in it, what do I do with it?
2005-11-29T08:52:00.000Z	Mabus06		uh... noob it down for me
2005-11-29T08:52:00.000Z	Mabus06		there were no docs, cheery one
2005-11-29T08:53:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	You're going to need the header files associated with your current kernel. Run 'sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-$(uname -r)'
2005-12-21T15:47:00.000Z	Mabus06	cafuego	you around?
2006-01-13T08:53:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	'whose'
2006-01-16T07:36:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	Depends on what you're going to do with XP and Linux.
2006-01-16T07:37:00.000Z	Mabus06	cafuego	I want to use Windows for gaming, and Linux for everything else.
2006-01-16T07:37:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	I'd probably do 100GB XP, 10GB Linux /, 50GB /home, 1GB swap.
2006-01-16T07:37:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	Adjust the XP and /home depending on what you foresee as space needs. If it's just games, maybe 40GB will do for XP.
2006-01-16T07:38:00.000Z	Mabus06	cafuego	I meant how. What do I install first, and what order do they need to be in?
2006-01-16T07:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	Install XP first.
2006-01-16T07:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	And put XP at the beginning of the drive.
2006-01-16T07:38:00.000Z	Mabus06	cafuego	and ubuntu can resize the partitions without deleting things on the windows one?
2006-03-04T16:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	Yes, 'cdrecord' will do that. (all GUI tools use cdrecord).
2006-03-04T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	'cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc speed=8 -v -eject -data foo.iso'
2006-03-28T11:16:00.000Z	cafuego	Mabus06	move ssh to port 2222; that'lls top it for now.
