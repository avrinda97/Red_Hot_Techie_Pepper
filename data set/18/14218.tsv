2006-06-06T05:27:00.000Z	Stormx2		This isn't a new dapper install.
2006-06-06T05:27:00.000Z	Stormx2		I tried upgrading from breezy, and it broke my system. So I installed breezy again and upgraded straight away. I had to install OO.o a couple of days ago. And it looks like wine >_<

2006-06-06T05:32:00.000Z	spikeb	Stormx2	that doesn't really look like windows, but it doesn't look like the rest of your desktop either
2006-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	spikeb	The dialogs are all windows based.
2006-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	spikeb	I swear. Look at the bottom, thats a big give away
2006-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	spikeb	Stormx2	i noticed that, it doesn't fit into your gtk theme and it should
2006-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	spikeb	Stormx2	do you have the openoffice gnome integration or gtk integration installed?
2006-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	spikeb	I... don't know
2006-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	spikeb	Stormx2	check :)
2007-03-23T09:03:00.000Z	spikeb	Stormx2	yes and yes.
