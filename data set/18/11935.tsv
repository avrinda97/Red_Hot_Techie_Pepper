2008-11-13T03:00:00.000Z	facefaceface		hi, my ubuntu box is down with a 'broken' upgrade ... unfortunately I forgot what version I was running, so I'm finding it hard to work out what to read here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FeistyUpgrades (for example)
2008-11-13T03:00:00.000Z	facefaceface		can someone tell me how to determine my current ubuntu version (I have a shell)
2008-11-13T03:01:00.000Z	facefaceface		OK, thanks LjL, I'm 6.06
2008-11-13T03:01:00.000Z	facefaceface		looks like I should have done a sequential upgrade
2008-11-13T03:03:00.000Z	facefaceface		if I am 6.06.2.LTS, should I go to 7.04 LTS then 8.4?
2008-11-13T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	7.04 is not lts
2008-11-13T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	7.04 is not lts
2008-11-13T03:04:00.000Z	facefaceface	ikonia	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/UpgradeFromOldVersion
2008-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	7.04 is not lts
2008-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	facefaceface	ikonia	I am 6.06.2 LTS, where should I go? 8.04 lTS?
2008-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	yes,
2008-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	as the doc suggests <quote> upgrade from an LTS release to the next LTS release (for example, Ubuntu 6.06 LTS to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS)  </quote>
2008-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	facefaceface	ikonia	and should I try to do that in one step?
2008-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	follow that guide though
2008-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	facefaceface	ikonia	ah! right! (so blind!)
2008-11-18T02:54:00.000Z	facefaceface	ikonia	I don't have the applet either
2008-11-18T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	walk down
2008-11-18T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	facefaceface	calm down
