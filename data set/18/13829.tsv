2005-10-13T14:37:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	what is your question?
2005-10-13T14:38:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	install the nvidia
2005-10-13T14:40:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	use your head.
2005-10-13T14:40:00.000Z	tylerdurden	nalioth	im new to linux, i uninstall the ati drivers once and xserver wouldnt boot
2005-10-13T14:42:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	open a terminal and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and choose the VESA driver
2005-10-13T14:42:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	then remove your card, drop in the nvidia and restart
2005-10-13T14:43:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	at that point you can install the nvidia driver of your choice
2005-10-13T14:45:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	identify yourself with nickserv, so you can receive info from ubotu
2005-10-13T14:45:00.000Z	nalioth	tylerdurden	/msg nickserv help register
