2005-01-20T10:27:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	Really?  Then maybe you can tell me why my machine locks up whenever I try to do anything openGL
2005-01-20T10:27:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	hmm, perhaps some AGP motherboard crap. my ti4200 works liek a charm
2005-01-20T10:28:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	What do you mean "AGP motherboard crap"?
2005-01-20T10:28:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	well, there are 2 AGP bus drivers I think...
2005-01-20T10:29:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	agpart and nvidias own agp
2005-01-20T10:29:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	have you read the binary driver readme?
2005-01-20T10:29:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	nope
2005-01-20T10:30:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	try it, it has some troubleshooting help. new nv drivers have worked great for me
2005-01-20T10:30:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	I just did a lsmod
2005-01-20T10:30:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	and it appears that both nvidia_agp and agpart are running
2005-01-20T10:30:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	might that be a problem?
2005-01-20T10:31:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	I was kinda hoping you'd tell me.
2005-01-20T10:31:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	I won't, because I haven't had the prob myself. You should really consult the driver readme
2005-01-20T10:31:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	I recall there was a chapter about that
2005-01-20T10:33:00.000Z	vafnord	Nonphasis	Where do I find this binary driver readme?
2005-01-20T10:33:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	check out /usr/share/doc/
2005-01-20T10:34:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	if that doesn't help go to nvidias homepage and d/l the driver
2005-01-20T10:34:00.000Z	Nonphasis	vafnord	I cant say directly because I'm on my soon-to-be-hoary box ATM
