2012-02-18T22:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	"seahorse - GNOME front end for GnuPG" i don't think seahorse is keyring related
2012-02-18T22:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	DANGER don't delete root stuff
2012-10-09T16:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	"lsb_release -a" from terminal is one way
2012-10-09T16:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	you can see "/msg ubottu version" i believe for that same direction
2012-10-09T16:53:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	ok, ubuntu 10.04
2012-10-09T16:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	does "lsusb" show the device for starters?
2012-10-09T16:55:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	hmm.. one entry i dont know what it is "Atheros Communications, Inc". The others dont look like wlan devices.
2012-10-09T16:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	atheros is probably your wlan - does it show a model number?  if so, i'd search online for support for that particular model.
2012-10-09T16:57:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	no, it just shows the string i typed. but i have the package. its a tl-wn721n.
2012-10-09T16:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	for general wireless you could check the "/msg ubottu atheros" factoid, just a general wireless help wiki page a believe, not atheros specific!
2012-10-09T16:58:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	hmm.. maybe i install the latest ubuntu version and see if it supports it out of the box?
2012-10-09T16:59:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	but how do i know it doesnt support it already?
2012-10-09T16:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	well, 10.04 ISN'T going to have the best hardward support at this time... so that "could" work, but 0 guarantee.
2012-10-09T17:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	you'll have to search online, or is someone here happens to have the same hardware (perhaps they'll know more).  best of luck.
2012-10-09T17:01:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	i mean, maybe my machine supports this stick, but i have to enable wlan somewhere?
2012-10-09T17:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	do you have a networking icon in top right corner?  check in that (it's Network Manager btw)
2012-10-09T17:02:00.000Z	no_gravity	zykotick9	no. i dont have a top panel.
2012-10-09T17:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	no_gravity	i see.  well, good luck.
