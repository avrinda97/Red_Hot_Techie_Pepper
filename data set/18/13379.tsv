2006-06-08T07:33:00.000Z	C-O-L-T		I use Ubuntu 6.06 and cannot connect to the internet via nor via DHCP neither via Static IP. Under WIN XP everything works well.
2006-06-08T07:34:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Your network adapter is properly installed ?
2006-06-08T07:35:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	I suppose because sometimes works my network and sometimes not it is like weather :)
2006-06-08T07:35:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Is it a wireless card ?
2006-06-08T07:36:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	no it is an Nvidia Ethernet Card and I use LAN
2006-06-08T07:36:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	does 'ifconfig -a' display your card ?
2006-06-08T07:37:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	I can not say because now I am in windows and if I boot to ubuntu I don't have net so I always have to boot in order to talk with you. But I have tried to use Static IP and everything, I tried iptables --flush, everything and sometimes works and sometimes not
2006-06-08T07:38:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Well, don't touch things you don't understand - I don't understand the IP tables either, heh. Anyways, are you SURE there is a DHCP service running ?
2006-06-08T07:39:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	If you have DHCP running, then we'll go with that
2006-06-08T07:39:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	under windows works well, my provider says that they recognize computers from their ethernet card address so called MAC address.
2006-06-08T07:40:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Ok, good.
2006-06-08T07:40:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	so what is the problem
2006-06-08T07:41:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	But next time you boot into Ubuntu, notice the boot-splash screen! There might be errors [failed]  messages. Then, from a console, try 'ifconfig -a' to see if the card is found. If a IP is not assigned, try 'dhclient eth0' (eth0 is the name of your network card)
2006-06-08T07:41:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	I have tried dhclient eth0 and cannot connect to network
2006-06-08T07:41:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Unfortunately, my wireless network card is not reliable in Dapper either. It is found on every 3rd boot - so I haft to use my wired LAN instead
2006-06-08T07:42:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Any errors ?
2006-06-08T07:43:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	Jemt	I am gonna boot to ubuntu now look for errors and something any useful commands which I can try in terminal>?
2006-06-08T07:43:00.000Z	Jemt	C-O-L-T	Good
