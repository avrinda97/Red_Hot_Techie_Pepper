2011-04-29T21:34:00.000Z	tarunno		Hello guys
2011-04-29T21:34:00.000Z	tarunno		happy release to all
2011-04-29T21:35:00.000Z	tarunno		I have a question
2011-04-29T21:35:00.000Z	tarunno		I read the Cannonicals official blog earlier
2011-04-29T21:35:00.000Z	tarunno		they said there won't be any netbook version in 11.04
2011-04-29T21:36:00.000Z	tarunno		but I can see a torrent file for 11.04 in Ubuntu site
2011-04-29T21:36:00.000Z	tarunno		why is that?
2011-04-29T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tarunno	i don't see how the two are linked
2011-04-29T21:37:00.000Z	tarunno	ActionParsnip	which two?
2011-04-29T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tarunno	the lack of netbook and the torrent you can download ubuntu with
2011-04-29T21:39:00.000Z	tarunno	ActionParsnip	in this page it shows a torrent file for downloading "ubuntu-11.04-netbook-i386.iso" http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download
2011-04-29T21:39:00.000Z	tarunno	ActionParsnip	which seems like a deadlink
2011-04-29T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tarunno	I always use: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/release/
2011-04-29T21:40:00.000Z	tarunno	ActionParsnip	I use the mirror hosted in my country
2011-04-29T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tarunno	I use torrents, much faster and allows you to give back to the community
2011-04-29T21:43:00.000Z	tarunno	ActionParsnip	I download the ISO from mirror and then share that in our local tracker to BitTorrent it ;)
2011-04-29T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tarunno	same sort of deal
2011-04-29T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tarunno	using torrents in the first instance means less faff
