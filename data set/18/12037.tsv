2007-01-09T13:03:00.000Z	The_Machine		so..  data recovery of a formatted FAT32 partition..  not really easy at all with linux?
2007-01-09T13:03:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	it is possible
2007-01-09T13:04:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	gpart and/or testdisk are nice to get things back
2007-01-09T13:06:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	do you have enough space on another partition to do a full dump of the lost one?
2007-01-09T13:07:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	can you pull it over the network?
2007-01-09T13:08:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	there is dd :)
2007-01-09T13:10:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	if you're looking for a good alaround admin and forensics livecd, take a look at grml
2007-01-09T13:15:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	there is a frontend to the sleuthkit: autopsy, really good !
2007-01-09T13:18:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	it is quite easy, and if you first make the image you can mess around with that as much as you like
2007-01-09T13:19:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	use dd and tunnel it over the net with ssh or netcat
2007-01-09T13:22:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	here's another link for you http://www.lnx4n6.be it explains stuff like pulling images over a net
2007-01-09T13:23:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	the netcat-dd thing is what you need
2007-01-09T13:24:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	 if your done with the image, i'll guide you through the rest if you want.
2007-01-09T13:24:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	btw i wouldn't recommend the cd they use on the site. i think grml has far more possibilities
2007-01-09T14:07:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	mount -o loop iso dir
2007-01-09T14:08:00.000Z	The_Machine	jpjacobs	did you basically just memorize that command?
2007-01-09T14:09:00.000Z	jpjacobs	The_Machine	thats the image you just made right?
2007-01-09T14:10:00.000Z	The_Machine	jpjacobs	no, something a coworker sent me
