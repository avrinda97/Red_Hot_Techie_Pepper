2009-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	mneptok	vdubhack	what is this file? what is its purpose?
2009-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	vdubhack		libnet
2009-12-27T06:24:00.000Z	vdubhack		mneptop: libnet, its needed to install snort
2009-12-27T06:24:00.000Z	vdubhack		mneptop: I cant even delete the file now either
2009-12-27T06:24:00.000Z	mneptok	vdubhack	why not install snort form the repository?
2009-12-27T06:25:00.000Z	vdubhack	mneptok	It doesnt apear to be the latest stable release according to what their web site is saying is the latest release.
2009-12-27T06:26:00.000Z	mneptok		!latest
2009-12-27T06:26:00.000Z	mneptok	vdubhack	i'd suggest using the packaged version
2009-12-27T06:26:00.000Z	vdubhack	mneptok	guess I should try installing that one and then doing the new version after once its met all dependancies?
2009-12-27T06:27:00.000Z	mneptok	vdubhack	no, as you won;t have the development versions of the libraries to link against
2009-12-27T06:27:00.000Z	vdubhack	mneptok	man this is a pain I will install that way. Any clue how to delete the libnet file now since I dont have permission to it?
2009-12-27T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	vdubhack	sudo rm -r /path/to/directory
2009-12-27T06:28:00.000Z	vdubhack	mneptok	thanks you were a big help
2009-12-27T06:29:00.000Z	mneptok	vdubhack	np np
