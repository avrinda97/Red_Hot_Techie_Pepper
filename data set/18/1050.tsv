2011-06-18T18:26:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	that sounds like a bad disk, not a bad filesystem
2011-06-18T18:27:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	/msg dpkg aptitude clone    for example
2011-06-18T18:28:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	the disk in brand new though
2011-06-18T18:28:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	and?
2011-06-18T18:28:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	that would be a pita
2011-06-18T18:31:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	there is no error from fsck, but when I copy the file, I get things like "cp: lecture de «myroot/var/log/kern.log»: Erreur d'entrée/sortie" which means input/ouput error
2011-06-18T18:31:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	check your kernel log
2011-06-18T18:32:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	and use LANG=C <command> next time. we don't speak french very well. maybe even use export LANG=C;<command>
2011-06-18T18:32:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	k
2011-06-18T18:34:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	I do got a _lot_ of errors in kern.log like this : http://pastebin.com/ALDWG0fG
2011-06-18T18:35:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	I see a new disk in your future
2011-06-18T18:35:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	could be other things too of course, cable for example
2011-06-18T18:35:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	on the other hand, the 'cp' command only output i/o errors for 6 files
2011-06-18T18:36:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	it's in a laptop
2011-06-18T18:36:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	then ignore them. still, some of your hardware is shot
2011-06-18T18:36:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	any way to tell the system to not use those bad sectors ?
2011-06-18T18:46:00.000Z	AciD_	wols	using "dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 == "install" { print $1 }' | xargs apt-get -y --reinstall install" to reinstall all my packages, I get that error : E: Could not perform immediate configuration on 'bash'. Please see man 5 apt.conf under APT::Immediate-Configure for details. (2). any idea about that ?
2011-06-18T18:47:00.000Z	wols	AciD_	no
