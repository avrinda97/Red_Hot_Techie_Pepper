2008-11-19T14:43:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		the tracker had 2 somethings going on... but when I opened it, it didn't show anything...
2008-11-19T14:45:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		it says starting sessions... and then it just disappears.
2008-11-19T14:45:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		Ubuntu is totally screwed.
2008-11-19T14:46:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		how do I find out if it's my HD or a software problem?
2008-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		what good is changing my tracker settings if Ubuntu isn't running properly?
2008-11-19T14:50:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		first I noticed FireFox wasn't saving HTML pages. then I noticed it wasn't saving images.
2008-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		then it started having problems loading web pages and it froze up when I tried to copy the URL to a link file. so I switched terminals even though I have no idea what to actually do in other terminals, and when I came back and lots of windows were glitched and missing contents.
2008-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		Because I save "save page as" and hit enter and no files are created. same with image files.
2008-11-19T14:53:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		oh. error in the terminal. (firefox:32281): GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:
2008-11-19T14:53:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
