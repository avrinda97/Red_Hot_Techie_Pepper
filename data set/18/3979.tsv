2010-01-29T08:10:00.000Z	MindVirus	b0w	That is very not good.
2010-01-29T08:11:00.000Z	MindVirus	b0w	Have you been overclocking?
2010-01-29T08:11:00.000Z	b0w	MindVirus	why? what does overclocking mean, i just installed the "IMPORTANT" updates via update manager
2010-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	MindVirus	b0w	It's either a hardware problem or you downloaded your program wrong.
2010-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	MindVirus	b0w	No, your RAM may be faulty.
2010-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	b0w	MindVirus	how can i download again the file and reinstall it?
2010-01-29T08:13:00.000Z	MindVirus	b0w	sudo apt-get autoclean if you can do that.
2010-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	MindVirus	b0w	Did that help?
2010-01-29T08:16:00.000Z	b0w	MindVirus	cant do that i got this error: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
