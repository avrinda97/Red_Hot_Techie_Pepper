2010-10-24T03:00:00.000Z	raguanu		HELP: Just installed maverick on my laptop. live cd worked fine. but i don't see the desktop after logging in. just the wallpaper is shown. Did apt-get upgrade from terminal (ctrl alt f1). didn't help
2010-10-24T03:02:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	think you have to run update first and aptitude is better
2010-10-24T03:03:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	I did apt-get upgrade after seeing this problem; din't help
2010-10-24T03:03:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	update
2010-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	Update just updates the package list. isn't it? I did that prior to upgrade.
2010-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	good
2010-10-24T03:06:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	how can i solve this 'wallpaper only no desktop after logging in' problem?
2010-10-24T03:07:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	can you log out?
2010-10-24T03:08:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	yes. from the tty thing
2010-10-24T03:09:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	I guess the panel fails to load
2010-10-24T03:10:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	i saw the panel while running on live cd though?!
2010-10-24T03:11:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	I would be inclined to reinstall if that is an option for you
2010-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	reinstall just the panel? is it possible?
2010-10-24T03:13:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	its name is gnome-panel but that may not help
2010-10-24T03:14:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	i will try reinstalling that. is it also possible desktop effects are enabled which cause the problem? is there a way to disable it through tty?
2010-10-24T03:16:00.000Z	robin0800	raguanu	at the log on screen you can choose failsafe but its never worked for me
2010-10-24T03:17:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	i will try the failsafe as well. thanks for the suggestions.
2010-10-24T03:21:00.000Z	raguanu	robin0800	good news. safe mode works fine!
