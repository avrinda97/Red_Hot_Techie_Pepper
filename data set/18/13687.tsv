2006-02-27T06:20:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	you can set it to suspend at a certain battery % using gnome-power-manager
2006-02-27T06:21:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	actually it looks like you can have it sleep after an idle time in gnome-power-manager as well as a battery charge level
2006-02-27T06:21:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	do you have gnome-power-manager installed (not the battery monitor applet)
2006-02-27T06:25:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	if i right-click on the gnome-power-manager notification area icon and select Preferences, there is a slider labeled "Put computer to sleep after"
2006-02-27T06:26:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	I've never used it. I can say that gnome-power-manager in dapper is much better than what's in breezy
2006-02-27T06:26:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	i've never used that setting, I use gnome-power-manager though
2006-02-27T06:27:00.000Z	eldad_	fangorious	I didn't understand - what do u use for auto suspending. I have the menu you mentioned only it never worked for me!
2006-02-27T06:28:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	i don't have it suspend after x minutes. I have it hibernate at 5% battery, and that works
2006-02-27T06:29:00.000Z	eldad_	fangorious	I guess there's a problem with my gnome-power-manager. it has "suspend" in its menu but that does nothing on my laptop
2006-02-27T06:30:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	bummer. i suggest filing a bug
2006-02-27T06:31:00.000Z	eldad_	fangorious	but I guess there's something which is mal-configured since I can suspend from the terminal and sleep button...
2006-02-27T06:33:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	well, i had a problem with g-p-m on breezy where suspending by closing the lid would cause an endless loop of suspend-on-resume, and that was resolved as 'works in dapper'. you're problem may be a similar situation. filing a bug is probably the best bet, as the problem will be looked at by the g-p-m author
2006-02-27T06:34:00.000Z	eldad_	fangorious	i'll do that... how do I get dapper to work...? :)
2006-02-27T06:35:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	well, dapper is still beta. you can download an image from cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/flight-4 at your own risk
2006-02-27T06:36:00.000Z	eldad_	fangorious	thanx... do u know how to script an auto suspend, say... using "cron" and "pmi action suspend"
2006-02-27T06:37:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	sorry, never ventured that far into it
2006-02-27T07:03:00.000Z	eldad_	fangorious	well, bug is post (g-p-m) thanx anyway!
2006-02-27T07:03:00.000Z	fangorious	eldad_	good luck!
