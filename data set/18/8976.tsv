2007-08-25T12:04:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	nope, just a crossover
2007-08-25T11:54:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	you don't have permission, try sudo ping.
2007-08-25T11:55:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	sudo ping does the exact same thing
2007-08-25T11:56:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	what are you trying to ping? can you ping 127.0.0.1?
2007-08-25T11:58:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	Well then, something isn't configed correctly.
2007-08-25T11:58:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	yes I thought much the same
2007-08-25T12:00:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	all I did was click the network manager applet in the tray and set the IP & subnet automatically for the 2nd NIC
2007-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	Why did you do that?
2007-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	the ip/subnet is already set on the other computer, so i was under the impression that they needed to be on the same subnet to work
2007-08-25T12:02:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	Ok, but the boxes can't share the same IP address, but they do share the same subnet.
2007-08-25T12:03:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	of course, the IP addresses are different by +1
2007-08-25T12:04:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	Ok, are they sharing a router or switch, can you ping them?
2007-08-25T12:05:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	The boxes are connected via a crossover cable, and you can't ping them? Bad cable?
2007-08-25T12:05:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	nope, i use the same cable for windows->windows networking
2007-08-25T12:06:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	So the only thing that changes is booting linux or windows?
2007-08-25T12:06:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	yep
2007-08-25T12:07:00.000Z	shiester_miester	n2diy_	and I'd love to be able to do the networking from ubuntu, since thats one less thing I have to rely on windows for
2007-08-25T12:07:00.000Z	n2diy_	shiester_miester	Hmmm, tha is interesting?
