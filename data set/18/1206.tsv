2011-04-28T22:30:00.000Z	Fodi69		hi, when I have a window at "fullscreen" (in unity), why the close, minimize button not clickable, when I'm hitting the top of the screen?

2011-04-28T22:33:00.000Z	Fodi69		can I configure somehow the close/minimize/maximize buttons BUT WHEN AT FULLSCREEN?

2011-04-28T22:36:00.000Z	Fodi69		maybe opensuse
2011-04-28T22:36:00.000Z	Fodi69		will work :D

2011-04-28T22:40:00.000Z	step21	Fodi69	not afaik
2011-04-28T22:40:00.000Z	Fodi69	step21	but why, this ultimately sucks and no config for it?
2011-04-28T22:41:00.000Z	step21	Fodi69	prob because that's how it makes sense ... in classic you can still configure them
2011-04-28T22:41:00.000Z	step21	Fodi69	also, don't spam
2011-04-28T22:42:00.000Z	Fodi69	step21	yeah, but this way it is UNUSABLE......
2011-04-28T22:43:00.000Z	step21	Fodi69	I find it quite usable. like I said if you want the old one back choose classic at login
2011-04-28T22:44:00.000Z	Fodi69	step21	this layout is kind of nice, but fucking buggy and unusable :(
2011-04-28T22:45:00.000Z	step21	Fodi69	taste varies I guess. anything specific that you don't like (not that I can do anything about it)
