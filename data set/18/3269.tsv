2010-03-02T00:38:00.000Z	niko-mojo		This doesn;t seem to get my internal speaker working ... hmm sudo modprobe pcspkr
2010-03-02T00:40:00.000Z	niko-mojo		echo -e '\a'  no beep at all
2010-03-02T00:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	At a console tty or an xterm / gnome-terminal?
2010-03-02T00:41:00.000Z	niko-mojo		gnome
2010-03-02T00:41:00.000Z	niko-mojo	Jordan_U	gnome
2010-03-02T00:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	Do alert sounds from other applications play?
2010-03-02T00:42:00.000Z	niko-mojo		Jordun_U getting an alert every time you reply to me
2010-03-02T00:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	Ubuntu 9.10?
2010-03-02T00:43:00.000Z	niko-mojo	Jordan_U	9.04 , tried this also to load the module sudo modprobe pcspkr
2010-03-02T00:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	Does your computer have a hardware beep? Many computers don't ( in 9.10 the hardware beep is disabled but gnome-terminal uses the system alert sound instead )
2010-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	So in 9.04, IIRC, if you don't have a hardware beep you won't hear anything from echo -e '\a'
2010-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	niko-mojo	Jordan_U	how can I tell if I have a hardware beep ?
2010-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	One way you can test if you have hardware beep is by installing the "beep" package and running "beep"
2010-03-02T00:47:00.000Z	niko-mojo	Jordan_U	beep made no sound
2010-03-02T00:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	Is this a laptop?
2010-03-02T00:48:00.000Z	niko-mojo	Jordan_U	yes
2010-03-02T00:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niko-mojo	Laptops generally don't have hardware beep. I don't know off hand how you can configure 9.04 to act like 9.10 and use the system alert sound instead.
2010-03-02T00:51:00.000Z	niko-mojo	Jordan_U	- so its a system alert that I'm trying to call ... thought this would the easy part
