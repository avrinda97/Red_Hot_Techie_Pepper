2006-05-16T08:37:00.000Z	tenstop		I only see a PATH=
2006-05-16T08:37:00.000Z	tenstop		Not a $PATH=.
2006-05-16T08:39:00.000Z	intelikey	tenstop	adding a path to the existing path ?   syntax;   export PATH="$PATH:/new/path"
2006-05-16T08:40:00.000Z	tenstop		Ok, it says:
2006-05-16T08:40:00.000Z	tenstop		if [ -b ~/bin ]  ; then
2006-05-16T08:40:00.000Z	tenstop		PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}"
2006-05-16T08:40:00.000Z	tenstop		fi
2006-05-16T08:40:00.000Z	intelikey		-b ?    not  -d ?
2006-05-16T08:40:00.000Z	tenstop		Woops, it is -d.
2006-05-16T08:41:00.000Z	intelikey		what that if statement does is add $HOME/bin  to the path if it is a dir. else it leaves the path unchanged.
2006-05-16T08:42:00.000Z	tenstop		Ok.
2006-05-16T08:42:00.000Z	intelikey	tenstop	what path are you trying to add ?
2006-05-16T08:42:00.000Z	tenstop		What I'm trying to do is add a program to the path so that if I type 'shorten', it'll run a program located in ~/Desktop/shorten/shorten
2006-05-16T08:43:00.000Z	tenstop	paradizelost	I'm trying to use it with shntool, which just checks for it to be in the path.
2006-05-16T08:45:00.000Z	intelikey	tenstop	you don't add programs to the path veriable.  you alias programs.    add this to you file    alias shorten='/the/path/and/the/executable.name -args'   <--- replacing the example of course.
2006-05-16T08:45:00.000Z	tenstop		Ah, ok then.  Thanks, intelikey
2006-05-16T08:45:00.000Z	intelikey	tenstop	anytime.
2006-05-16T08:49:00.000Z	intelikey	tenstop	example;   alias ll='/bin/ls -lAh --color=auto'
