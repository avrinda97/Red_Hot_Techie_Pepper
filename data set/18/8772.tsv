2009-08-15T15:32:00.000Z	eboyjr		Hey, can anyone tell me which graphics cards (any) work on the HP Pavillion dv9700?
2009-08-15T15:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 when in doubt - stick with nvidia cards.
2009-08-15T15:33:00.000Z	eboyjr	Dr_Willis	The graphics card is shot.. vesa works, but the resolution is 800x600 (too small) Maybe there was something I could do
2009-08-22T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 shouldent be. if you set up a 'persistant' save location/file.  the permissions should stay correct
2009-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 unless you want to start the Installer. :)
2009-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	eboyjr	Dr_Willis	Lol thanks :)
2010-07-12T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 you may want to setup a live flash drive  some how - boot using that. and fsck/recover any data. that HD may be badly broken
2010-07-12T18:14:00.000Z	eboyjr	Dr_Willis	coz_: Isn't there something in initramfs? And my hard disk is okay actually cuz I'm using it right now while IRC'ing... It's a sturdy netbook just maybe the power went out which caused the hd errors
2010-07-12T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 head crashing into platters - bad karma :)  You can fsck it if you want.. but its possible it may have future issues
2010-07-12T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 i always keep a flash drive  with a rescue/restore/repair disrto on it. for such cases
2010-07-12T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 the ubuntu-rescue (recovery?) variant i recall is CLI only
2010-07-12T19:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 theres a ubuntui recovery variant. and otehr rescue live cd/usb vasriants. depending on you rneeds
2010-07-12T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 check  disrtowatch.com - they mention most of the variants,
2010-07-12T19:50:00.000Z	eboyjr	Dr_Willis	Cool thank you very much :)
2010-07-12T19:52:00.000Z	eboyjr	Dr_Willis	Do you know of a simple good liveCD version of a distro that's under 150 MB's? Ubuntu-rescue-remix is 177 MBs
2010-07-12T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	 tiny core linux = 11 mb. install what you want.
2010-07-12T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eboyjr	  I dont see a reason for the 150mb limit. :) so ive never paied attention tio the sises
2010-07-12T19:53:00.000Z	eboyjr	Dr_Willis	alright lol well im in a bit of a hurry
