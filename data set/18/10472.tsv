2008-01-07T06:58:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	open up a terminal
2008-01-07T06:58:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	type 'top' without the '' in the command line
2008-01-07T06:59:00.000Z	tinman	UnNaturalHigh	i know the terminal
2008-01-07T06:59:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	so either allow it to finish indexing or set it to not start up with ubuntu
2008-01-07T07:00:00.000Z	tinman	UnNaturalHigh	will this index everytime i start? or once and stop bothering me?
2008-01-07T07:00:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	the first time it has to index all of your files-although you can adjust that to index only certain directories or omit ones
2008-01-07T07:01:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	afterwards it only has to update the files that have been removed/added
2008-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	tinman	UnNaturalHigh	thanks a lot, astro76 too :)
2008-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	it has started before as it comes enabled by default in ubuntu
2008-01-07T07:03:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	updatedb I believe is for slocate
2008-01-07T07:03:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	I don't use it
2008-01-07T07:03:00.000Z	UnNaturalHigh	tinman	I prefer the find command for the odd time I need to search for something
2008-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	tinman	UnNaturalHigh	can  i upload that file to a shell and somehow make it posible for justin to dl it?
