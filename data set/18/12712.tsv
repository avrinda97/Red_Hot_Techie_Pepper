2006-03-17T08:58:00.000Z	Muleario		I have another question: is it possible to make xchat do a system beep when someone sends a message with your name in it? ;)
2006-03-17T08:59:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	yes
2006-03-17T09:01:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	I created the original patch to do it, and it was ignoring. A while later they author did added the feature. It is currently called Beep on hilighted messages.
2006-03-17T09:01:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	I mean ignored
2006-03-17T09:02:00.000Z	Muleario	Edgan	and I would just put Muleario in the "Extra words to highlight on" field?
2006-03-17T09:03:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	No, it should just work. It auto highlights when someone says your nick
2006-03-17T09:03:00.000Z	Muleario		Oh I see
2006-03-17T09:04:00.000Z	Muleario		hmm it's not working...I wonder if perhaps I have system beeps disabled or something. Just upgraded to dapper two days ago
2006-03-17T09:04:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	does your pc speaker work? Not sure if Ubuntu enables it by default.
2006-03-17T09:04:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	you may need to modprobe pcspkr as root
2006-03-17T09:05:00.000Z	Muleario	Edgan	I just did sudo modprobe pcspkr and there was no output
2006-03-17T09:05:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	that is normal for modprobe
2006-03-17T09:06:00.000Z	Muleario		edgan: oh wow, it works now! Ha. is it on by default now or will I have to add this to sessions?
2006-03-17T09:06:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	I guess it isn't. You will need to make sure the module is loaded on each boot
2006-03-17T09:07:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	Not sure if Ubuntu has it's own way, but you could create rc.modules as a shell script to call modprobe pcspkr. I know Debian used to do it that way. You could also add it to rc.local.
2006-03-17T09:08:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	and that is /etc/rc.modules
2006-03-17T09:08:00.000Z	Muleario	Edgan	I'm about to enter it as an entry in /etc/modules. should that work?
2006-03-17T09:08:00.000Z	Edgan	Muleario	probably
