2009-12-05T05:40:00.000Z	watr		I have some experience with Linux, but none working with Linux-to-OSX samba configs. I am trying to get file sharing to work with OSX, can someone help me?
2009-12-05T05:41:00.000Z	Fizix	watr	I too was having funky issues with my friend's OS X laptop
2009-12-05T05:41:00.000Z	Fizix		McNellis: if both screens are on Ubuntu, you don't need TwinView
2009-12-05T05:41:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	have you got your ubuntu to connect to the OSX machine?
2009-12-05T05:41:00.000Z	Fizix	watr	yea, we connected via samba shares
2009-12-05T05:42:00.000Z	Fizix		I think you have to tell it to share a folder via Samba; I don't think it defaults to that. OS X that is
2009-12-05T05:42:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	yeah, I have it set to that. I can access my ubuntu box from OSX, but I can't access OSX from ubuntu
2009-12-05T05:43:00.000Z	Fizix		McNellis: I simply plug both monitors into the same card and you the display configuarations to control it from there
2009-12-05T05:43:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	I keep getting a permission denied error
2009-12-05T05:43:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	so it must be something with the password encryption I assume...
2009-12-05T05:43:00.000Z	Fizix		Watr: Does OS X, like Windows, depend on it being on the same workgroup in order to see it?
2009-12-05T05:44:00.000Z	watr		no
2009-12-05T05:44:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	no
2009-12-05T05:44:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	OSX recognizes and lists my laptop as an available share as long as ubuntu is set up for samba sharing and smbfs is installed
2009-12-05T05:45:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	So you can connect to OSX from ubuntu?  What steps did you take to get it working?
2009-12-05T05:46:00.000Z	Fizix	watr	It's been a few months now and a lot of it was trial and error; I'm afraid to say I don't remember exactly what did it :/
2009-12-05T05:46:00.000Z	watr	Fizix	can you post your smb.conf so I can take a look?
2009-12-05T05:52:00.000Z	Fizix	watr	File is pending to be sent you you; waiting on your authorization. Also, I'm pretty sure it was my buddy on the OS X side that had to change things around
