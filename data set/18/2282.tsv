2010-06-27T04:46:00.000Z	wajimba		anybody? how do I kill the current session and start a new one using tty?
2010-06-27T04:47:00.000Z	wajimba		typos_king: it froze and I don't want to take the entire system down
2010-06-27T04:49:00.000Z	wajimba		typos_king: yeah, what's the command to launch gnome? I tried xstart and it says "server is already active for display 0"
2010-06-27T04:49:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	gdm
2010-06-27T04:50:00.000Z	wajimba		yeah, how do I restart the gdm
2010-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	gdm will start with X
2010-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	wajimba		typos_king, _ath, !gdm isn't working either
2010-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	what exactly are you trying to do.
2010-06-27T04:53:00.000Z	wajimba	_ath	the current session froze, trying to start a new one without taking the whole system down
2010-06-27T04:54:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	change to that screen, and ctrl alt backspace
2010-06-27T04:54:00.000Z	_ath		?
2010-06-27T04:54:00.000Z	_ath		tried that?
2010-06-27T04:55:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	by changing to the X screen i mean ctrl + alt + F7
2010-06-27T04:56:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	if gdm has already died, but X is still running, kill X and restart it.
2010-06-27T04:57:00.000Z	wajimba	_ath	yeah, that's got it. Thx :)
2010-06-27T04:57:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	yw.
2010-06-27T04:57:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	for future reference, ctrl alt backspace tries to restart the X server.
2010-06-27T04:57:00.000Z	_ath	wajimba	 so if you get gui problems that look terminal, that's your first port of call.
