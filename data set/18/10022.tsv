2007-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	yes there is a bug for Ubuntu Edgy Live CDs in combination with some ATI Radeon cards
2007-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	I have an nvidia chipset, Pentium D processor
2007-01-19T07:06:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	do you get to see the menu of the live-cd
2007-01-19T07:51:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	what boot parameters have you tried so far?
2007-01-19T07:52:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	just the defaults, minus the quiet and splash
2007-01-19T07:53:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	Damn Small Linux (knoppix base) failed as well with "Cant find KNOPPIX filesystem"
2007-01-19T07:53:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	did you get any error messages after doing that?
2007-01-19T07:54:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	boot parameters that have been suggested for such problems are: noapic, noagp, noapm, nolapic, pci=noacpi, acpi=off, vga=..., ht=on, pci=bios, usb=bios, fb=false
2007-01-19T07:55:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	Yes, that it cant find the ramfs
2007-01-19T07:55:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	did the self-check of the CD go ok?
2007-01-19T07:56:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	No i get the same problem
2007-01-19T07:56:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	It fails copying over to the ramfs (so it seems) and it drops to busybox
2007-01-19T07:56:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	its brand new, and i tried another one with the same results
2007-01-19T07:59:00.000Z	Monika|K	livingtm	maybe do a RAM check, maybe that is damaged
2007-01-19T08:00:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	I didn let the mem test run very long
2007-01-19T08:00:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	but it seemed ok
2007-01-19T08:01:00.000Z	livingtm	Monika|K	It always fails the same way.. very strange.
