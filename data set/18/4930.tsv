2009-01-12T06:33:00.000Z	yow|laptop		cant pulseaudio do that?
2009-01-12T06:33:00.000Z	yow|laptop		hmmm, dont think ive ever tried it. ive used sound within a browser and also a music player at the same time though
2009-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	well that's exactly what isn't working for me.
2009-01-12T06:35:00.000Z	yow|laptop	Matillo	- which flash plugin is selected for your browser?
2009-01-12T06:35:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	adobe flash.
2009-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	My music player hangs up until the sound resource is freed.
2009-01-12T06:37:00.000Z	yow|laptop	Matillo	- is pulseaudio or alsa selected in your sound settings? what does alsamixer show?
2009-01-12T06:37:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	I've tried both and autodetect, and alsamixer showed the levels? Not off.
2009-01-12T06:38:00.000Z	yow|laptop	Matillo	hmmm. its possible that it could be a restriction on your sound card. did it ever work for two inputs?
2009-01-12T06:39:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	In windows it did, yeah.
2009-01-12T06:40:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	Well, I played a flash video, without audio, then paused and unpaused my music player, and now the music player's not playing again.
2009-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	yow|laptop	Matillo	- it sounds like its grabbing the audio and not letting go then
2009-01-12T06:42:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	Well it's happening with any sources, not just flash or music.
2009-01-12T06:43:00.000Z	yow|laptop	Matillo	- are system sounds enabled and esd as well?
2009-01-12T06:43:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	system sounds yeah, ESD?
2009-01-12T06:43:00.000Z	yow|laptop	Matillo	- system > prefs > sound
2009-01-12T06:44:00.000Z	Matillo	yow|laptop	ok, i sees it. Yes it's on.
