2008-07-09T09:11:00.000Z	freetube		i'm not use to having porn pop up on this computer when i open firefox. when i started a new session it didn't do that though. makes me wonder if someone was surfing porn and firefox crashed.
2008-07-09T09:11:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	Porn popups can and usually do work independantly of malware. It's probably a homepage set to a porn popup site as well as the pop-up blocker disabled
2008-07-09T09:14:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	hmm not disabled. i'm not sure popups were present. just allot of tabs with a bunch of porn site (porntube for instance). the history has youtube listed as the last site (well, homepage then youtube.com)
2008-07-09T09:15:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	Well it's pretty blatant that someone was perusing porn on your system. Change the homepage back to your normal homepage and see if the popups go away
2008-07-09T09:15:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	A lot of porn sites give a popup to set the site as the default homepage.
2008-07-09T09:16:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	the home page is not set to a porn site. it is the correct site. that's why i'm wondering if someone stumbled into porn through youtube maybe. or somehow an infection occurred.  i guess it maybe would have occurred although nothing did occur given the browser/os combination though. it was just the initial "won't go away without killing browser" type site
2008-07-09T09:17:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	But now it is remedied?
2008-07-09T09:18:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	well after i killed the browser and started it back up without reopening the old tabs (since firefox saves tabs when crashed) it does not appear infected (no porn sites pop up as tabs nor search bars of any kind).
2008-07-09T09:19:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	That is not an infection, it is just a feature of Firefox. It just happened that there were multiple tabs that had pop-up porn sites. If you don't open tabs then it is gone and not malware.
2008-07-09T09:20:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	right- i guess it was a bad click by my dad on youtube to a third party site with malicious content. when the browser crashed he didn't reopen it. I guess when i opened it the things then came up
2008-07-09T09:21:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	it sure felt like i was on windows. never have i experienced that in 12 years of using linux
2008-07-09T09:21:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	There was no malicious content, it just sounds like he started looking at porn and closed out Firefox without knowing abut the saved-tabs options. There is no malware.
2008-07-09T09:21:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	It was re-opening a multitude of porn sites that already allowed pop-ups made it freak out, nothing else.
2008-07-09T09:21:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	well i had to kill the browser because the site kept popping up a message insisting i install activex something or other.
2008-07-09T09:22:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	That's a website trying to do stuff, it's not malware, just annoying.
2008-07-09T09:22:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	If you don't want it to happen again just tell your dad to not browse porn on your computer.
2008-07-09T09:22:00.000Z	freetube	Templar_Xion	probably right. i still was not expecting it.
2008-07-09T09:26:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	freetube	It's over now, no worries, kay?
