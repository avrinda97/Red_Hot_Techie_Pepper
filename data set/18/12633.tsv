2007-06-08T06:32:00.000Z	anthony_		Alright, when I partition the disks while installing from the alternate cd, which option is best if I have a 9GB hd and a 3.2 Gb hd, which previously had Windows XP installed and now have files from failed attempts to install ubuntu?
2007-06-08T06:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	maybe put / & swap on the 3gig, and the rest on the 9gig /usr, /var, /home
2007-06-08T06:34:00.000Z	anthony_	Frogzoo_	I would have to choose the manual option to do that, right?
2007-06-08T06:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	manually partition is all
2007-06-08T06:55:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	you can have 3 primary partions + 1 extended partition/in the extended partition, you can have more logical paritions
2007-06-08T06:55:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	on the 9gig, make /usr, /home, /var primary paritions
2007-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	anthony_	Frogzoo_	thanks. So I start with a primary partition. I guess that makes sense.
2007-06-08T07:01:00.000Z	anthony_	Frogzoo_	do I go to where it says, "Label for the file system in this partition" type /usr and continue?
2007-06-08T07:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	yep, and specify mount point as /usr & file system as ext3
2007-06-08T07:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	labels are only for your ref - whatever you like
2007-06-08T07:17:00.000Z	anthony_	Frogzoo_	does it make sense to set a partition up with 9.1 GB of space for the root file system?
2007-06-08T07:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	I said put / & swap on the 3gig
2007-06-08T07:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	1 gig for /, 2gig for swap
2007-06-08T07:20:00.000Z	anthony_	Frogzoo_	they should both be primary partitions, right?
2007-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	yep
2007-06-08T07:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	nope, not needed
2007-06-08T07:26:00.000Z	anthony_	Frogzoo_	I set the mount point to / on one partition and swap on the other?
2007-06-08T07:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	anthony_	correct
