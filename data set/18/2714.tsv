2010-03-14T00:42:00.000Z	dbone		Hey everybody, I can't log into my linux dist. because I ran "sudo chage" and accidentally made the password expire.  I think I need to to use chmod but I don't know how.  Can someone help?
2010-03-14T00:43:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	if you have no other sudo-enabled users, maybe you can boot into recovery mode; i don't know if there's an easier way
2010-03-14T00:44:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	right now I'm on a live cd, I was in here earlier and someone mentioned using chmod.
2010-03-14T00:45:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	oh, i don't know about the livecd approach...
2010-03-14T00:45:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	it's usb.  still no?   Okay, I think i'll google chmod
2010-03-14T00:46:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	alternatively, I don;t think i can boot into safe mode as root without the user password, do you know a way?
2010-03-14T00:46:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	oh really? didn't know that...i thought maintenance mode logs you into root foryou...
2010-03-14T00:47:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	there's a trick to get root shell from GRUB menu without any passwords but i don't think i should go around sharing it...
2010-03-14T00:49:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	wait, i'm sorry im a bit of a newbie, how exactly do a log into safe mode then
2010-03-14T00:49:00.000Z	dbone		I've tried rebooting and holding esc but that does nothing
2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	when you restart your computer, do you get a little message that say, "press escape to enter the boot menu..." and it goes away after three seconds?
2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	no unfortunately
2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	I use xubuntu, could that be why?
2010-03-14T00:50:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	that boot menu should have a recovery mode. yeah, sometimes i don't get that either...i don't remember when you get it and when you don't
2010-03-14T00:51:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	so what do you suggest I do?
2010-03-14T00:52:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	here are the official instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode once you do that, you have root access and you can try to undo whatever you did to lock yourself out (reset user passwords maybe)
2010-03-14T00:52:00.000Z	Ganymede	dbone	i can't say that i've done this before though
2010-03-14T00:52:00.000Z	dbone	Ganymede	ha, okay thanks though!
