2012-02-04T06:48:00.000Z	ben_		Can someone please help me? Ubuntu Software Center won't work for me. It shows the app page but it freezes my computer
2012-02-04T06:50:00.000Z	ben_		ugh...
2012-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	ben_		Yep. Everything is all set and reasy
2012-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	ben_		ready*
2012-02-04T06:52:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	when was the last time you updated?
2012-02-04T06:53:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	try using synaptics instead and see if it freezes
2012-02-04T06:54:00.000Z	ben_	oldude67	what is synaptics?
2012-02-04T06:55:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	synaptics is probably under pref. in your menu look its the old style of software center
2012-02-04T06:55:00.000Z	ben_	oldude67	under the Applications menu in the top left hand corner?
2012-02-04T06:57:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	if not look under system settings i cant remember i havent used xfce in a while. im going with the lxde setup and its a little different.
2012-02-04T06:57:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	i think there is a #xubuntu channel as well.
2012-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	 i know there is a #xfce they would know more for sure.
2012-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	ben_	oldude67	I couldn't find the channel. Is it synaptic package manager? Sorry for bothering
2012-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	yes thats it.
2012-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	ben_	oldude67	and I just click that?
2012-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	oldude67	ben_	just open it at the top it has a search just type in the program you are looking for. you got it.
2012-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	ben_	oldude67	thank you very much. I'll let you know if it works or not. brb
