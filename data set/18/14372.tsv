2005-08-08T11:36:00.000Z	sproingie		flash works fine on the 32 bit firefox
2005-08-08T11:36:00.000Z	sproingie		you want to do a lot of multimedia stuff, you may as well just run a 32 bit dist tho
2005-08-08T11:36:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 i'm just gonna do 32bit
2005-08-08T11:37:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 I'm just gonna use i386
2005-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	my onobard nick works in it
2005-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	msi motherboard
2005-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	sproingie	melio	asus motherboard.  nvidia chipset.  a good half of all amd64 motherboards i'd say
2005-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 via chipset here
2005-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 I was actually afraid of nvidia chipsets when they came out for amd64
2005-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	dono why. just fraidy cat I guess
2005-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	sproingie	melio	they work dandy.  i'm astonished fc4's installer doesn't support them
2005-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 that is kinda odd actually.
2005-08-08T12:23:00.000Z	sproingie	melio	i don't know, because it rhymes?
2005-08-08T12:24:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	how is it african?
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	sproingie	melio	uh... it's an african word.  the distro's home is based in south africa.
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 isnt that spelled afrikan then?
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	sproingie	melio	if you're dutch i suppose.  it's not an afrikaans word tho
2005-08-08T12:26:00.000Z	melio	sproingie	 I'm not dutch :P
