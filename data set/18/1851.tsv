2011-11-23T14:52:00.000Z	jennie	proxx	, please explain what you said ""proxx its offtopic, high download speeds also appear to break files, at least i have with 60mbit connection""
2011-11-23T14:53:00.000Z	proxx	jennie	when i download files at max speed, i often have to download files 3 times to get the checksum right, but this is offtopic as i said.
