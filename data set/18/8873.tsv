2007-06-13T06:17:00.000Z	Hip-no		hello everyone
2007-06-13T06:18:00.000Z	Hip-no		is there someone here who might help me run a few simple things to install VMware tools on my mac, where I'm running Ubuntu Feisty with VMware Fusion?
2007-06-13T06:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	Sure, make sure that you don't still have the Ubuntu iso set as the virtual CD rom or nothing will come up when you go to install vmware-tools ( vmware gets confused with 2 cdroms )
2007-06-13T06:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	I can walk you through it
2007-06-13T06:29:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	thanks... please!  I'd much appreciate it
2007-06-13T06:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	Double click the tar.gz file and it choose to extract it to your desktop
2007-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	I have extracted VMware to the desktop
2007-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	Once you have the folder "vmware-tools" on your desktop open a terminal and run: sudo Desktop/vmware-tools/vmware-install.pl
2007-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	OK, I'll dot hat
2007-06-13T06:37:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	 I tried running the vmware-install and I got this:  sudo Desktop/vmware-tools/vmware-install.pl
2007-06-13T06:37:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	but I did run the command that IndyGunFreak suggested, which is for VMware player
2007-06-13T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	Sorry, I got the name of the folder wrong run: sudo Desktop/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl
2007-06-13T06:38:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	do I type 'perl' first?
2007-06-13T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	No, it should just run
2007-06-13T06:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	Ok, I think you can just choose the default for all of the questions
2007-06-13T06:50:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	thanks for your help... the vmware tools are installed and working!
2007-06-13T06:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hip-no	np :)
2007-06-13T06:52:00.000Z	Hip-no	Jordan_U	 and IndyGunFreak by the way, it is pretty cool to run Feisty through vmware on my macbook pro... I'm figuring it will be a great way to learn linux while using it without having to destroy all my OSX stuff
