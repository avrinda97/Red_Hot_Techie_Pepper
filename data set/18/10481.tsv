2007-03-18T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego_		You have an incomplete install
2007-03-18T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego_		You probably didn';t install an mpm. get 'apache2-mpm-prefork'
2007-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	cafuego_		prefork is the standard one that works with php; if you don't need php, and are running a high-volume sit,m you may want to experiment with other mpms.
2007-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	naught101	cafuego_	that's already installed
2007-03-18T06:38:00.000Z	cafuego_		Hmm
2007-03-18T06:41:00.000Z	naught101	cafuego_	if I try re-installing it, which packages should I re-install?
2007-03-18T06:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	naught101	I'm checking
2007-03-18T06:41:00.000Z	naught101		cool
2007-03-18T06:42:00.000Z	cafuego_	naught101	Actually, doesn't matter: 'sudo touch /etc/apache2/httpd.conf'
2007-03-18T06:42:00.000Z	cafuego_	naught101	It' an empty file anwyay.
2007-03-18T06:42:00.000Z	naught101	cafuego_	empty? ok, I'll give it a go
2007-03-18T06:43:00.000Z	cafuego_	naught101	Yes, all configuration is done via symlinks in sites-enabled and mods-enabled, and ports.conf
2007-03-18T06:43:00.000Z	naught101	cafuego_	cool, it worked, but i got this:sudo touch /etc/apache2/httpd.con
2007-03-18T06:43:00.000Z	naught101		sorry
2007-03-18T06:43:00.000Z	naught101		apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
2007-03-18T06:44:00.000Z	naught101		seems to work anyway
2007-03-18T06:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	naught101	yeah, that's fine
2007-03-18T06:45:00.000Z	naught101	cafuego_	now, when I got to http://localhost/test.php it tries to downlowd the file... know how to fix that? I have php installed properly as far as teh instructions go
