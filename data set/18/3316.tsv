2009-10-30T01:55:00.000Z	akrohit		I just installed ubuntu 9.10 Karmic. Why is there a delay after login? I am using xmonad as WM.
2009-10-30T01:56:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	xmonad?
2009-10-30T01:56:00.000Z	akrohit	carresmd	yes
2009-10-30T01:57:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	are you using compiz with xmonad?
2009-10-30T01:58:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	are you using compiz with xmonad?
2009-10-30T01:58:00.000Z	akrohit	carresmd	no compiz
2009-10-30T01:59:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	I'm sorry can't help you then :-(
2009-10-30T01:59:00.000Z	akrohit	carresmd	just after login there is a screen which shows a bar moving for few seconds, both for gnome and xmonad
2009-10-30T02:00:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	ah.. that's the new GDM doing it's work
2009-10-30T02:00:00.000Z	akrohit	carresmd	can it be disabled in any way?
2009-10-30T02:00:00.000Z	akrohit	carresmd	its kind of irritating
2009-10-30T02:01:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	not sure about that.. let me check
2009-10-30T02:08:00.000Z	akrohit	carresmd	did you get anything on login delay?
2009-10-30T02:08:00.000Z	carresmd	akrohit	still looking ... it's a hard thing to find
