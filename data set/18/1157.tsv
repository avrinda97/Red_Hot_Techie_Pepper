2011-05-24T10:30:00.000Z	albertolempira		Is there a kind of "registry" like in windows in which i can delete entries for a specific application?
2011-05-24T10:30:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	no.
2011-05-24T10:32:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	a config file or something that i can edit
2011-05-24T10:32:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	What do you mean "thinks"?
2011-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	I'm trying to install Frostwire after mistakenly erased its folders and files in my filesystem, but the software center tells me that the version i'm trying to install is not co-installable with the one that is "installed".
2011-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	Then tell aptitude to force
2011-05-24T10:36:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	to force installation you mean?
2011-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	ok i get it let me try it
2011-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	Then install with sudo apt-get install --force-yes packagename
2011-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	i get the same error http://pastebin.com/UQMp7FSP
2011-05-24T10:43:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	I'm stumped.  Let me see what I can find.
2011-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	ok thanks! I'm looking for a solution too, that's why i think it might be some sort of config file
2011-05-24T10:49:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	What happens if you type "dpkg --remove frostwire"?
2011-05-24T10:50:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	dpkg: warning: there's no installed package matching frostwire
2011-05-24T10:53:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	Download the .deb manually from the repository for the OLD version you deleted, dpkg -i packagename, and then uninstall it properly
2011-05-24T10:55:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	I finally did it!, it happens that the actual name of the old "package" was frostwire:i386 so I just did dpkg --remove as you told me with "frostwire:i386" and it removed it, then i tried to install it from the ppa and it worked! Thanks a lot for your help!
2011-05-24T10:55:00.000Z	PseudoGou	albertolempira	You're welcome!!  Good luck and G-D bless!
2011-05-24T10:57:00.000Z	albertolempira	PseudoGou	you too!
