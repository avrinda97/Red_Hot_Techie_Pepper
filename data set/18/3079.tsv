2009-12-19T20:23:00.000Z	Bookman		I have a USB thumb drive and it shows up in lsusb, but it never mounts.  How to mount this drive?
2009-12-19T20:24:00.000Z	jaceleon	Bookman	did you remove your USB safely?
2009-12-19T20:24:00.000Z	Bookman	jaceleon	don't know, shared computer
2009-12-19T20:24:00.000Z	jaceleon		AUdacious2, is that fast?
2009-12-19T20:25:00.000Z	jaceleon		if you're going to use a USB flash disk, you are supposed to SAFELY remove the USB...
2009-12-19T20:25:00.000Z	Bookman	jaceleon	I understand, but that does not help me mount it :)
2009-12-19T20:25:00.000Z	jaceleon		if the USB is removed just like whiz, Bookman, it goes on read-only mode...
2009-12-19T20:25:00.000Z	jaceleon		the do this bookman
2009-12-19T20:26:00.000Z	jaceleon	Bookman	sudo mkdir /media/disk - then do the next one
2009-12-19T20:27:00.000Z	jaceleon	Bookman	sudo mount/dev/sdb (assuming that the USB is SDB) /media/disk
2009-12-19T20:28:00.000Z	jaceleon		Bookman?
2009-12-19T20:28:00.000Z	Bookman	jaceleon	I'm here but your last statement makes no sense
2009-12-19T20:29:00.000Z	jaceleon		you will type those on a terminal, Bookman...
2009-12-19T20:29:00.000Z	Bookman	jaceleon	This makes no sense:  sudo mount/dev/sdb
2009-12-19T20:30:00.000Z	jaceleon		first, type lsusb on terminal
2009-12-19T20:30:00.000Z	Bookman	jaceleon	I assume you mean sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/disk
2009-12-19T20:30:00.000Z	jaceleon		yes
2009-12-19T20:30:00.000Z	Bookman	jaceleon	and I get mount: you must specify the filesystem type
