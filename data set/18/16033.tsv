2004-12-02T11:16:00.000Z	SirG3		Anyone know how I'd put yaboot back my iMac? I was installing OS 9 to test Mac on Linux and it overwrote it ><
2004-12-02T11:17:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	Install to the MBR with ybin -v -v
2004-12-02T11:20:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	how would I go about that? I'm booted into Ubuntu (kinda?) through the CD because I can't boot into Linux because it boots into OS X because yaboot got overridden
2004-12-02T11:29:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	how would I go about that ((12:17:08) eim: SirG3: Install to the MBR with ybin -v -v)? I'm booted into a shell through the CD because I can't boot into Linux because it boots into OS X because yaboot got overridden :-(
2004-12-02T11:30:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	You need to use the Ubuntu PPC CD to rescue boot to your linux partition.
2004-12-02T11:31:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	Once turned on your Mac hold 'C' for CD-ROM boot.
2004-12-02T11:31:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	I am booted off of the Ubuntu CD...... and sjoerd: it doesn't show up :-/ just the button to boot off of OS X.......
2004-12-02T11:35:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	so what should I do? :-/
2004-12-02T11:35:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	Rescue boot your linux system and reinstall yaboot (MBR) via ybin.
2004-12-02T11:38:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	erm, excuse my ignorance, rescue boot?
2004-12-02T11:39:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	Use the Ubuntu PPC install CD as boot resource to rescue your previous Linux installation. chroot to / and execute ybin.
2004-12-02T11:39:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	ok, how would I mount the Ubuntu partition? I tried mount /dev/hda11 /mnt/ubuntu (after creating /mnt and /mnt/ubuntu)?
2004-12-02T11:41:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	Should work if /dev/hda11 is your root partition.
2004-12-02T11:42:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	it is, but  ls /dev/ doesn't show any hda.......
2004-12-02T11:43:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	That's strange. try dmes |grep hd and check if you've the kernel supports your hdd.
2004-12-02T11:45:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	| KobrAs: I booted off the CD, hit esc and got into a shell, that the proper way eh?
2004-12-02T11:48:00.000Z	eim	SirG3	Yes.
2004-12-02T11:52:00.000Z	SirG3	eim	*sigh* I have no clue why I can't mount that partition!
