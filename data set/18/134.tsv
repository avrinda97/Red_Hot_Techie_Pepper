2012-08-16T14:39:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	do you know what the fact behind the restricted extras is?
2012-08-16T14:39:00.000Z	minhus	k1l_	yes i do know
2012-08-16T14:39:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	no you dont
2012-08-16T14:40:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	if its forbidden to ship them ootb, ubuntu cant ship them.
2012-08-16T14:42:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	if you know it, why do you want it tp be on a cd/dvd? that doesnt make any sense
2012-08-16T14:44:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	just download the packages you want with apt-get
2012-08-16T14:45:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	but you can create your own cd/dvd with you favorite apps. just take  a look at remastersys
2012-08-16T14:46:00.000Z	k1l_	minhus	and since you dont have a support questtion pls transfer the question to #ubuntu-discuss
