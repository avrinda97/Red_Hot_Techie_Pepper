2007-03-27T07:50:00.000Z	rhys		i enabled the root account, and it broke sudo. so i disabled the root account..and sud is still broken
2007-03-27T07:50:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- describe "broken"
2007-03-27T07:51:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- so if you type sudo su what happens?
2007-03-27T07:52:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	nothing.
2007-03-27T07:52:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- touch /etc/sudoers
2007-03-27T07:52:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	as in it exists, but there is nothing about my user in it
2007-03-27T07:53:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	thats what i need to know.  ill try it
2007-03-27T07:53:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- if you cant edit the file you may need to boot to single user mode and do it.
2007-03-27T07:54:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	to use sudo i must be part of the admin group?
2007-03-27T07:54:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- yes.  :)
2007-03-27T07:55:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- hopefully you dont let any ol' chap use sudo...
2007-03-27T07:55:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	first useful bit of ubuntu support ive ever had. thank you much. i never use sudo in slackware.
2007-03-27T07:55:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- yes... in ubuntu they recommend you NEVER touch the root account and do everything through sudo.
2007-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	i personally think zenwalk is better in every aspect save for package support. package support in ubuntu (debian) is so huge.
2007-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- agreed.  I think Slackware runs much speedier though.  You get bloat with completely binary systems like Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE...
2007-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	Hansel	rhys	- Slackware and FreeBSD = all I run on servers.
2007-03-27T07:59:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	zenwalk is backwards compatible, and has basic support in netpkg (slapt-get) for dependencies..which i dont have much trouble with anyay.
2007-03-27T07:59:00.000Z	rhys	Hansel	im realitivly new. my first system was 9.1 slackware
