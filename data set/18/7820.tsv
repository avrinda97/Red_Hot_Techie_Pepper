2007-11-15T03:09:00.000Z	Sirvaldor		how do i unmount my xp harddrives? when i attempt to do so says i need root access how do i gain the access needed to unmount them?
2007-11-15T03:09:00.000Z	Sirvaldor		it would be even better if i could disable  the desktop icons
2007-11-15T03:11:00.000Z	DShepherd	Sirvaldor	you dont want the mounted volumes to show on the desktop?
2007-11-15T03:13:00.000Z	DShepherd	Sirvaldor	open gconf-editor... go to apps -- nautilus -- desktop. In the right panel just uncheck volumes visible
2007-11-15T03:15:00.000Z	Sirvaldor	DShepherd	sorry for the late reply i don't want them to show up on my desktop but i want them to still be mounted
