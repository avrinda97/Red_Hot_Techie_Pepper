2008-05-08T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	install the package "PHP5"
2008-05-08T18:11:00.000Z	bennyf11	ikonia	I have already done this
2008-05-08T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	"sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5"
2008-05-08T18:12:00.000Z	bennyf11	ikonia	that is also already installed
2008-05-08T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	restart apache and it should work
2008-05-08T18:13:00.000Z	bennyf11	ikonia	how do i do that??
2008-05-08T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
2008-05-08T18:14:00.000Z	bennyf11	ikonia	I get an error saying that /etc/init.d/apache command not found
2008-05-08T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2008-05-08T18:16:00.000Z	bennyf11	ikonia	I have restarted the server, still no luck. How would i tell if PHP is correctly installed
2008-05-08T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	put <php? phpinfo(); ?> in a file called index.php on your webserver and view it
2008-05-08T18:19:00.000Z	bennyf11	ikonia	Its still requesting me to download it (the index.php file)
2008-05-08T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	one moment
2008-05-08T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	can you look in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled and see if php5 is in there
2008-05-08T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	sudo a2enmod php5
2008-05-12T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	bennyf11	should be /usr/bin
