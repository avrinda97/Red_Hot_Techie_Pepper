2009-10-02T17:02:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	I don't want to leave any MacOS on my macbook, wan to use entire HD for Ubuntu
2009-10-02T17:02:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	I'm pretty sure you can't do that.
2009-10-02T17:02:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	I did it last night on my Macbook, just having issues on macbook pro
2009-10-05T16:08:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	Have you set a root password?
2009-10-05T16:08:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	ummm not sure, let me check
2009-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	there is no password set for roon in /etc/shadow
2009-10-05T16:10:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	huh. OK.
2009-10-05T16:10:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	so, is that the issue? do i need to set one ?
2009-10-05T16:11:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	no, don't set a root password
2009-10-05T16:11:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	I was under the impression that GUI interface uses sudo
2009-10-05T16:11:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	it uses gksudo
2009-10-05T16:12:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	ok, so any idea why is it failing ?
2009-10-05T16:12:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	are you set to "administer the system"?
2009-10-05T16:13:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	yes, I am set as system admin
2009-10-05T16:15:00.000Z	cybersplice	ghatak	try gksudo apt-get update from terminal
2009-10-05T16:17:00.000Z	ghatak	cybersplice	it works fine
