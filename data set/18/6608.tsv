2008-05-09T01:00:00.000Z	tony403		the last few years and different distros, my sound volume never works in a full screen game or video. anyone else have the same problem?
2008-05-09T01:00:00.000Z	tony403		does sound volume work for anyone in full screen mode?
2008-05-09T01:00:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	how many sound cards do you have?
2008-05-09T01:01:00.000Z	tony403	PeterFA	just an audigy 2 with onboard off in the bios
2008-05-09T01:02:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	ok, ever ran alsamixer?
2008-05-09T01:03:00.000Z	tony403	PeterFA	yes, alsamixer works, just the volume dial on my keyboard. always have to manually change the volume on the speaker
2008-05-09T01:03:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	alsamixer is a good no-bs volume changer.
2008-05-09T01:03:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	it doesn't screw up, ever. Sometimes it's tricky just because there are many channels and some affect in different ways.
2008-05-09T01:05:00.000Z	tony403	PeterFA	so how do i link alsamixer with my keyboard volume dial to work in full screen?
2008-05-09T01:06:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	that's not what I was getting at... anyways, there are a lot of issues surrounding your question to be asked: Are these wine programs? Are they DOS ones? Do they use the KDE sound stuff? Do they do their own? Are they using OSS?
2008-05-09T01:06:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	Gnome sound stuff?
2008-05-09T01:07:00.000Z	tony403	PeterFA	no wine. all programs. I never had one work in full screen using the keyboard volume control. both kde and gnome
2008-05-09T01:09:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	that's because they're probably built to have their own volume control and not assuming that the signal from the volume up/down really means you want the volume to go up or down. You'll have to find a way to get it to go around the game system for interpreting the key strokes (because your volume up/down buttons are keys) and hand them off to KDE or Gnome, whichever you're suing.
2008-05-09T01:10:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	what those games are doing is handing the sound they want to play to the sound system of the computer and forgetting about it.
2008-05-09T01:11:00.000Z	tony403	PeterFA	thanks. it's not a real big deal. just wondering if i was the only one
2008-05-09T01:11:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	you may be able to find a way to bind those keys so that they're interpreted first but I don't know.
2008-05-09T01:12:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	I don't think that's the right approach because when the game is closed then the sound will be really high, so you'd have to turn it down, which doesn't really solve the problem.
2008-05-09T01:12:00.000Z	PeterFA	tony403	you'll just have to live with it.
