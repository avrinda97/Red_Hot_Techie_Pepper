2005-03-30T08:09:00.000Z	limaunion		having some troubles while upgrading to Hoary, apt-get update displays many errors while trying to fetch Packages.gz (404 Not found) any ideas what's going on ? I'm following the wiki steps...
2005-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	did you change all your sources.list?
2005-03-30T08:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	could you www.pastebin.com the error output?
2005-03-30T08:14:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	thanks for your help, now I just left 'deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hoary main restricted' and it's ok.
2005-03-30T08:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	alrighty :)
2005-03-30T08:15:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	will see what's going on because I started with synaptic and now can't start gnome (after upgrading from Warty)
2005-03-30T08:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	you're on hoary now? Was the dist-upgrade successful?
2005-03-30T08:18:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	yes, my notebook was till 2 hours ago, I updated my /etc/apt/ and made the update via Synaptic, going to the 'upgrade' section or something like that and selected all of them (all went ok), next I restarted the system but now it seems that some packages were left, apt-get dist-upgrade seems to be taken care of that
2005-03-30T08:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	in Terminal, try typing sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-03-30T08:21:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	yes, I did that, now it's download mainly gstreamer packages and some others, don't now why Synaptic didn't updated those. fam is going to be removed, is that ok ?
2005-03-30T08:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	yes, that's fine. Go for it.
2005-03-30T08:22:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	ok, thanks
2005-03-30T08:30:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	maybe you can help me, apt-get dist-upgrade finished ok, but I still can't start gdm, /etc/init.d/gdm start doesn't work (no errors, just nothing). dpkg -l | grep xorg shows only 1 package, and dpkg-l | grep -i xfree shows 3, one still version 4.3 (xserver), any idea...?
2005-03-30T08:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	what farruinn said... also, does startx work?
2005-03-30T08:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	you should, then. It's a metapackage with all the dependencies.
2005-03-30T08:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	or rather... depends on all the necessary stuff.
2005-03-30T08:34:00.000Z	limaunion	apokryphos	but ogra says 'before' and here http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryUpgradeNotes says after (now for me ;) )
2005-03-30T08:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	limaunion	before is best
