2007-04-11T15:12:00.000Z	Galga		hi
2007-04-11T15:12:00.000Z	Galga		whenever i run update manager, it halts, and nothing happens onwards
2007-04-11T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	does the machine hang or just update manager
2007-04-11T15:13:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	just the update manager
2007-04-11T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	ok - try sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-04-11T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	if you have errors you'll get output from the apt command
2007-04-11T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	rather than hidden behind the gui
2007-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	shall i kill the update manager ?
2007-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	when i typed sudo apt-get upgrade in terminal, it started right away with updating
2007-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	ok - lets let it complete
2007-04-11T15:17:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	i can still see the gui of update manager hanged at processing step though
2007-04-11T15:17:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	ok thank
2007-04-11T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	the fact that apt-get is running while you can see the gui means the gui was doing nothing as there is not a lock file problem
2007-04-11T15:21:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	thanks for the information, besides after the download completes, can i update my edgy to the newer latest release, perhaps by downloading the required files only ?
2007-04-11T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	the latest edgy release - or fesity
2007-04-11T15:22:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	fesity
2007-04-11T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Galga	I'd advise against until its stable
2007-04-11T15:23:00.000Z	Galga	ikonia	ok
