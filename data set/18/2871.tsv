2010-02-05T08:52:00.000Z	krysis	arghh2d2	well i was going to use my moms windows xp to fix the file system, a few people have said they get the same error on their hard drives because when using windows somehow windows transfers created corrupted files or because of windows' incorrect hibernating system... so im gna scan it on a windows pc just to fix windows problem -.-;
2010-02-05T08:53:00.000Z	arghh2d2	krysis	dosfsck is open source linux-ware if you dont trust windows (like me)

2010-02-05T08:55:00.000Z	arghh2d2	krysis	stfu with the attitude...i said ubuntu isnt geared for power users...i just come here to help people if i can, not in some competition...grow up kid.
