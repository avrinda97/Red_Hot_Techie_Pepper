2007-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	mg		mike, did you configure ndiswrapper in any way?
2007-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	mg		mike, like extracting the winxp firmware
2007-04-16T06:34:00.000Z	mg		mike, its a piece of software which emulates the windows ndis interface so that linux can use windows drivers

2007-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	mg		mike, somewhere you want
2007-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	the last result says "ethernet controller-unknown device 1904:2031 (rev 01)" on lspci
2007-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	I have checked lib/modules/kernel/net and there is no folder that says 8139D either
2007-04-16T06:41:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	apparently the system is seeing that it's there but it's not recognizing it ...how do I add an appropriate driver to the system?
2007-04-16T06:43:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	sure thing!
2007-04-16T06:44:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	yes, I agree it should be, but for some strange reason it's not :(
2007-04-16T06:46:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	I tried it on two slots- no luck
2007-04-16T06:48:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	what should I try?
2007-04-16T06:52:00.000Z	Zakman3	mg	I have no idea what in Heaven's name that means but I'm trying it *g*
