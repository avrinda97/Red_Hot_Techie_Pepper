2009-02-23T09:47:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	whats the chance of me messing up my vista partition in this procedure ?
2009-02-23T09:47:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	if u dont know what u are doing ... high
2009-02-23T09:49:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	i ll give it a shot :)
2009-02-23T11:35:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	alright, that didnt work :) now not even vista boots :)
2009-02-23T11:36:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	it has to be fixed
2009-02-23T11:36:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	surely u did something wrong
2009-02-23T11:37:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	first thing that is wrong is ubuntu not automaticly creating that like in 8.04 if that was there, i wouldnt be stuck
2009-02-23T11:37:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	it creates that automatically :S
2009-02-23T11:37:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	no vista then ubuntu
2009-02-23T11:39:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	i was tryin to assign / to the ext3 partition of ubuntu, then swap is swap of corse and the vista partition is now set as not used, but if i enable mount point windows, nothing can be written ... error
2009-02-23T11:40:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	:S
2009-02-23T11:40:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	that isnt funny :(
2009-02-23T11:40:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	hmmm i cannot guide u to fix that ... u need someone with knowledge to fix it
2009-02-23T11:41:00.000Z	hitman1985	x-ip	i guess i can just kiss my vista partition good bye and just format the whole deal :(
2009-02-23T11:42:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	:(
2009-02-23T11:42:00.000Z	x-ip	hitman1985	i'm sorry :S, 'boot problems' needs some knowledge to be fixed
