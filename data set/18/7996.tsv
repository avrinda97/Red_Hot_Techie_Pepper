2007-10-31T01:27:00.000Z	RobotBanana		Hey guys, I just had a really weird  problem. I loaded up the Ubuntu LiveCD on my computer for the first time, and it ran fine. Maybe a little slower than I remember it being on other PCs. Then I tried to restart, and it beeped twice and immediately powered down.
2007-10-31T01:27:00.000Z	RobotBanana		Then my PC wouldn't turn on again....
2007-10-31T01:27:00.000Z	RobotBanana		I had to turn off the power supply, unplug it, then plug it back in and go. Then it worked.
2007-10-31T01:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	did you flip the switch in back, wait 30 seconds and try again?
2007-10-31T01:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	make sure a video card or sound-card didn't come out the slot also.
2007-10-31T01:28:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	Yeah, and that worked. But before I did that it wouldn't power up. Any idea what caused that?
2007-10-31T01:29:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	could be bad hardware?
2007-10-31T01:29:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	Windows doesn't have any problems....
2007-10-31T01:30:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	i386 or x64?
2007-10-31T01:30:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	I have ubuntu on my laptop, and I decided to try the LiveCD for shits and giggles on my desktop, then that happened.
2007-10-31T01:32:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	In your bios is any of the "cache to RAM/Memory" options enabled?
2007-10-31T01:32:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	Haven't checked. Although I did update my BIOS today...
2007-10-31T01:35:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	Hmm... While I was in the LiveCD, I tried to install the NVIDIA drivers through the restricted package manager, and I have an 8800. Do the drivers maybe not support 8800s?
2007-10-31T01:35:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	did you install nvidia-glx-new?
2007-10-31T01:36:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	Just the drivers in the Restricted Package Manager.... not sure what those are.
2007-10-31T01:42:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	if you installed proprietary drivers that's probably what did it.
2007-10-31T01:43:00.000Z	RobotBanana	MilitantPotato	I hope so. I'm a little scared to try loading the CD up again though just in case, hehe. :)
2007-10-31T01:44:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	RobotBanana	Run memtestx86 from the liveCD overnight, aswell as prime95 (two instances, one per core as the afinity) in windows for atleast 6 hours
