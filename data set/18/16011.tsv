2007-07-21T10:45:00.000Z	T-Connect		How I do this? /usr/games -> Point to allacrost.exe then run ./allacrost -i
2007-07-21T10:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 that made very little sence.
2007-07-21T10:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 cd to the dir where the game is at,, run it from the terminal
2007-07-21T10:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 if the comallamand is          allacrost -i , then you run      allacrost -i ?
2007-07-21T10:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 from a terminal it shoudl spit out info .
2007-07-21T10:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 dont 'click' use the shell, is what seems to be needed.
2007-07-21T10:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 open a shell, cd to where that game is at. (cd /usr/game/whatever) then RUN thge command  ./whatever -i
2007-07-21T10:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 it may be time to learn some bash basics.   You are most liklely doing somthing fundamental wrong.
2007-07-21T10:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 it may be you are in the wrong directory, use 'ls' and LOOK and see what files are there
2007-07-21T10:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 shell basics. :)
2007-07-21T10:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 also the command   'which  allacrost' will tell you where its at
2007-07-21T11:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 you are getting things way confused..   ./allacrost -i  will run a program in the current dir. try it with out the ./
2007-07-21T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 logical - since the directory does not exist.
2007-07-21T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 Your useeage/command is making no sence at all. Perhaps you should start from the beginning with what you are trying to do.
2007-07-21T11:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 'cd /usr/game' makes sence. 'cd ~' will go to your /home/username dir.
2007-07-21T11:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 you are confusing several things at once.. earlier you were trying to 'cd' to a file.
2007-07-21T11:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 or just try    allacrost -i
2007-07-22T15:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	T-Connect	 Huh? you mean the irc server ports?
