2007-01-24T10:48:00.000Z	gnoodles		Hi Everyone...
2007-01-24T10:49:00.000Z	gnoodles		Anyone know if there's a way to add a "restart into Windows" option in the restart dialog box? IE, SO I don't need to be there for the Grub screen?
2007-01-24T10:51:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	is this a frequent requirement?
2007-01-24T10:57:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	shtrat may be right i dont play games as such
2007-01-24T10:51:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	yes i agree ... i solved it by running windows inside a vmware server in ubuntu
2007-01-24T10:52:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	the other advantage s that way you can get files readily to and from both os environments
2007-01-24T10:53:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	i find it works very well
2007-01-24T10:53:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	as far as i can see its by far the most straightforward way if you must have windows available on the same pc
2007-01-24T10:56:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	its just like running windows
2007-01-24T11:01:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	you could edit /boot/grub/menu.lst but that is sort of more trouble than its worth for one off situations
2007-01-24T11:06:00.000Z	gnoodles	tom47	Thanks for the info on vmware. I'll try it out.
2007-01-24T11:39:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	sounds like your mileage varied
2007-01-24T11:44:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	see above
2007-01-24T11:52:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	its doesn't make a lot of sense to me either unless somehow you have borked the mbr and need to reinstate it .... i woulo begin by checking the disk with fsck
2007-01-24T11:54:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	no i dont think you would
2007-01-24T12:03:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	what is the third option in your menu.lst?
2007-01-24T12:06:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	is that what you wanted to do in the next boot ie memtest?
2007-01-24T12:07:00.000Z	tom47	gnoodles	did you allow for grub using a funny numbering system ie 4=3
