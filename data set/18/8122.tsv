2008-05-23T02:57:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	what are you trying to accomplish
2008-05-23T02:58:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	does it show up anywhere
2008-05-23T02:58:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	what I meant was does it show up on the desktop
2008-05-23T03:01:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	so you have said. does the icon appear on the desktop?
2008-05-23T03:02:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	then change the permissions
2008-05-23T03:04:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	is this the only thing where permissions are fouled up?
2008-05-23T03:05:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	you didnt enable root did you
2008-05-23T03:06:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	have you tried creating a new user and see if it has the same issues with that player
2008-05-23T03:13:00.000Z	masterloki	bazhang	I got this message in the new user when i tried move a file over "cannot be copied because you do not have permissions to create it in destination
2008-05-23T03:15:00.000Z	bazhang	masterloki	move a file over from the mp3player?
2008-05-23T03:17:00.000Z	masterloki	bazhang	and put the file I want on there and try to move it back right
