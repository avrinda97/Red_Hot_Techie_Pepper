2010-08-19T20:45:00.000Z	meek_		does the universe component also contain non-free software? the homepage does not clearly state this
2010-08-19T20:45:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	I dont think so, but let me check.
2010-08-19T20:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	I think it's in restricted, but try this:
2010-08-19T20:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	$ grep "restricted\|multiverse" /etc/apt/sources.list | grep -v "^#"
2010-08-19T20:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	dpkg -l linux-restricted-* |  grep -vE "^[a-z]n"
2010-08-19T20:51:00.000Z	meek_	KE1HA	I'm not using ubuntu. There are licence policies for main and restricted on the homepage, but not for universe. the homepage says: "The universe component is a snapshot of the free, open-source, and Linux world.". what does that mean?
2010-08-19T20:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	means it's covered by GNU Lic.
2010-08-19T20:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	See here for more info on GNU open-source Lic: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html
2010-08-19T20:52:00.000Z	meek_	KE1HA	so it means it contains free and only free software?
2010-08-19T20:53:00.000Z	meek_	KE1HA	I know the definition of free software
2010-08-19T20:53:00.000Z	meek_	KE1HA	I just found the sentence unclear
2010-08-19T20:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	well non-free doesn't mean it costs you anything.
2010-08-19T20:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	I try to rationalise it similar to restricted drivers, there free, but non open to open-source development.
2010-08-19T20:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	But agreed, it is kind of confusing.
2010-08-19T20:54:00.000Z	meek_	KE1HA	they are not free in terms of free software foundation
2010-08-19T20:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	yes, that's what way I understand it.
2010-08-19T20:57:00.000Z	meek_	KE1HA	I mean there's no explanation for what "free" and "open-source" means for the universe component. and "linux world" could also include non-free software. there's a detailed licence policy for main and restricted, but not for universe
2010-08-19T20:58:00.000Z	KE1HA	meek_	I suspect there's legal begal stuff in all that, I just dont have the "legal begal" answers :-)
