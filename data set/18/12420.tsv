2006-05-02T13:34:00.000Z	Warbo	alxwind	It is all of those. The one for a firewall would be 192.something
2006-05-02T13:36:00.000Z	Warbo	alxwind	You need to open that on your router, for your 192.168.something.something address of your PC
2006-05-02T13:37:00.000Z	Warbo	alxwind	Is your DSL Modem connected with Ethernet (network)?
2006-05-02T13:38:00.000Z	Warbo	alxwind	Then you have a router :)
