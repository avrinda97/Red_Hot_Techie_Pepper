2005-06-02T08:29:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	thanks.  "linux-image-686"
2005-06-07T07:56:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	i'm contemplating using the mplayer codecs instead.
2005-06-07T07:56:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	I downloaded the mplayer codecs, but I don't know how to get mplayer to use them
2005-06-07T07:57:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	hmm. can't help you with that i'm afraid.  i use the underrated totem :-)
2005-06-08T07:19:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	gnome-gv
2005-06-08T07:19:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	tritium: thanks
2005-06-08T07:20:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	i've tried others but always come back to xpdf though
2005-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	I don't like gnome-gv much
2005-06-08T08:00:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	that's nautilus launching the default media player: totem
2005-06-08T08:01:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	so I guess I either want to turn off the pretty graphics in totem (can I?) or change the default media player for mp3 files in nautilus (can I?)
2005-06-08T08:01:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	yes and yes.
2005-06-08T08:02:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	eidt->prefs in totem.  or right-click->properties->open-with in nautilus.
2005-06-08T08:02:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	click on the radio button for the desired default.
2005-06-08T08:03:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	I've turned off the graphics in totem, but the gui is still huge - there's just a big grey area where the graphics used to be.  can't you get rid of that bit altogether?
2005-06-08T08:04:00.000Z	reka	dooglus	afaik no.  it's more of a movie player after all.   try a dedicated music player like beep-media-player
2005-06-08T08:05:00.000Z	dooglus	reka	I can't see how to get nautilus to change its default - but thoreauputic is helping me with this.
