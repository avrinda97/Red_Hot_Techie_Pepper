2008-07-12T22:31:00.000Z	genia4		Hi, how would I use aptitude to install all packages recommended by currently installed packages
2008-07-12T22:31:00.000Z	genia4		can't get the searc expression right :(
2008-07-12T22:33:00.000Z	mouser-	genia4	I thought I had your answer, but actually, I'd like to know that too.
2008-07-12T22:33:00.000Z	mouser-		hi TURKEY
2008-07-12T22:34:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	tried everything, all sorts of complex ?fors. Can't get them right though, I think bash is eating some of the special chars...
2008-07-12T22:36:00.000Z	mouser-	genia4	do you have many packages to install, or could you simply do it manually in aptitude or synaptic?
2008-07-12T22:37:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	many
2008-07-12T22:38:00.000Z	mouser-	genia4	I suspect you've tried the man page already?
2008-07-12T22:38:00.000Z	genia4		of course
2008-07-12T22:38:00.000Z	genia4		and the online docs
2008-07-12T22:40:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	I can't get ?for to work in aptitude, or anything with ? for that matter
2008-07-12T22:40:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	when I press "/" to start a search and type ?name(whatever), it gives me an error
2008-07-12T22:41:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	"invalid preceding regular expression"
2008-07-12T22:42:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	even ?true doesn't work :(
2008-07-12T22:45:00.000Z	mouser-	genia4	If it's bash, it might not be ubuntu specific - you could try asking in other channels/forums as well, as well as hanging around here.  People join all the time; there will certainly be someone with more experience than I.  My experience is limited with anything beyond reading man pages and basic coding.  Still, I'd like to know the answer as well.  If you happen to find it, let me know.
2008-07-12T22:46:00.000Z	genia4		 mouser- no problem
2008-07-12T22:57:00.000Z	genia4	mouser-	figured out, pm?
2008-07-12T23:25:00.000Z	mouser-	genia4	Figured it out?  Yes, please PM.
