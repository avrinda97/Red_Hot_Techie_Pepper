2008-08-03T03:42:00.000Z	yoyoned	tympaniplayer	what are you trying to do?  can you be a little more specific
2008-08-03T03:43:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		yes when i hit enter on the boot screen, the ubuntu logo comes up...and then after about a min or so i get this message saying that the job control turned off
2008-08-03T03:43:00.000Z	yoyoned	tympaniplayer	how long do you wait
2008-08-03T03:43:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		after it says the job has stopped?
2008-08-03T03:44:00.000Z	yoyoned	tympaniplayer	have you tried any of the other options on the boot screen, has ubuntu ever booted
2008-08-03T03:44:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		no it has never booted
2008-08-03T03:45:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		i just installed it using a Live CD
2008-08-03T03:46:00.000Z	yoyoned	tympaniplayer	try booting into recovery mode.  It will be an option at boot
2008-08-03T03:47:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		i tried that and it got so far
2008-08-03T03:47:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		and then i just had a blinking cursor
2008-08-03T03:48:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		yoyoned....should i have waited longer in recovery boot?
2008-08-03T03:49:00.000Z	yoyoned	tympaniplayer	I'm not sure, that is an unusual error.
2008-08-03T03:50:00.000Z	tympaniplayer		yoyned: tell you what ill try again and come back...by the way the message that i get says /bin/sh: can't acces tty, job control turned off
