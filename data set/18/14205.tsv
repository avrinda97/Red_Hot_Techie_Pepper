2005-12-28T15:14:00.000Z	brother_of_jared		Amaranth I just followed the excellent advice on how to install truetype fonts...
2005-12-28T15:14:00.000Z	brother_of_jared		my question is, I won't need to re-create the directories each time so which part of the process would I do each time I want to add a font?
