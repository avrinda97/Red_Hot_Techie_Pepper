2007-09-27T15:18:00.000Z	NotSure		I use kubuntu
2007-09-27T15:18:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	that's a function of the shell, not Konsole
2007-09-27T15:18:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	echo $SHELL
2007-09-27T15:19:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	~/.bash_history
2007-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	unless you changed the default history variable in another environment file
2007-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	NotSure	mneptok	no it is not where konsole stores the history, if i erase this file, i will still see commands before
2007-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	bash loads the entire history when it starts. you need to delete the file without Konsloe running
2007-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	NotSure	mneptok	in other words, it stores it in ram?
2007-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	or swap.,
2007-09-27T15:23:00.000Z	mneptok	NotSure	what are you trying to accomplish? no history at all, ever?
