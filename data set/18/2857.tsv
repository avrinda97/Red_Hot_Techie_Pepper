2010-02-05T06:10:00.000Z	evolv		I'd really like to use Ubuntu, but it seems that my Toshiba laptop refuses to cooperate
2010-02-05T06:10:00.000Z	evolv		I've tried installing from my USB drive, and after what appears to be a successful installation
2010-02-05T06:10:00.000Z	evolv		I then tried to install within Windows to dual boot, just to see if that works
2010-02-05T06:11:00.000Z	evolv		but the same problem persists
2010-02-05T06:11:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	Explain what happens when you try to boot ubuntu
2010-02-05T06:11:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	it looks like it's loading, then the screen goes black
2010-02-05T06:12:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	Does it freeze the machine at that point? Or can you still here it working?
2010-02-05T06:12:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	it's definitely frozen, the only thing I can do is ctrl-alt-del twice to reboot
2010-02-05T06:12:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	Which graphics card do you have and which version of ubuntu did you install?
2010-02-05T06:13:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	it's integrated
2010-02-05T06:13:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	but it's an "ATI Mobility Radeon"
2010-02-05T06:13:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	and version of ubuntu?
2010-02-05T06:13:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	9.10
2010-02-05T06:14:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	How far does ubuntu load up?
2010-02-05T06:14:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	some typical text scrolls on the screen, indicating boot up, then it just goes black
2010-02-05T06:17:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	Can you try booting with radeon.modeset=1 to see if it makes a difference?
2010-02-05T06:18:00.000Z	evolv	soreau	I honestly don't know how to make that adjustment
2010-02-05T06:19:00.000Z	soreau	evolv	At the grub prompt, press e then append this option to the line with vmlinuz after the other args (for instance ro quiet splash radeon.modeset=1)
