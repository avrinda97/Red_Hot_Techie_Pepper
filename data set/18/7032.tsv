2008-02-20T02:55:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb		Why is my windows wobbly?
2008-02-20T02:56:00.000Z	macogw	natlinuxnewb	you have compiz turned on and the wobbly windows plugin enabled
2008-02-20T02:56:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	macogw	its weird
2008-02-20T02:56:00.000Z	macogw	natlinuxnewb	after using it, i feel like the windows not moving is unnatural :P
2008-02-20T02:57:00.000Z	macogw	natlinuxnewb	if you install compizconfig-settins-manager you can customize which plugins are off and on
2008-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	macogw	I think i did something that turned it on. Something in appearance maybe
2008-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	macogw	natlinuxnewb	you turned on desktop effects
2008-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	macogw	Yeah i turned on effects in ... you got it
2008-02-20T02:59:00.000Z	macogw	natlinuxnewb	wobbly windows and desktop cube are the most commonly requested settings, so those are the defaults when you turn on effects
2008-02-20T02:59:00.000Z	macogw	natlinuxnewb	use ccsm to turn off wobbly windows and keep cube or whatever you want
2008-02-20T02:59:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	macogw	 whats  cube?
2008-02-20T02:59:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	macogw	and whats ccsm?
