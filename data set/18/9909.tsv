2007-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	newbie		I open .cvs file via openoffice, copy and paste to gedit -- then it display
2007-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	newbie		Is there any quick way to do this one as in windows?
2007-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	newbie		Thanks
2007-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	newbie		i m newbie - so i do not know how to use vi
2007-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	newbie		a .cvs file is a txt file looks like "data","data name","data data"
2007-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	cables	newbie	you mean .csv?
2007-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	cables	newbie	right click, go to Open With
2007-05-29T06:39:00.000Z	newbie	cables	then ... ?
2007-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	cables	newbie	go to open with other application. It's fairly obviouss from there.
2007-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	newbie	cables	yes, but i 'd like to open with gedit, you know it is a txt file
2007-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	cables	newbie	then select gedit from the list.
2007-05-29T06:41:00.000Z	newbie	cables	i wonder why gedit can not display the context
2007-05-29T06:41:00.000Z	cables	newbie	did you select it? Perhaps it's a bad file.
2007-05-29T06:42:00.000Z	newbie	cables	well , it looks funny, if open with gedit
2007-05-29T06:44:00.000Z	newbie	cables	when i open with openoffice and copy to gedit, it is exactly what i m expecting , but just too many steps
2007-05-29T06:50:00.000Z	cables	newbie	nice try. You don't know what terminal is, or how to use Open With, but you know what less is?
2007-05-29T06:50:00.000Z	cables	newbie	drop the act
