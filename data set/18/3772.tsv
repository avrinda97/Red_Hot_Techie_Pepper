2011-11-03T00:18:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	for your first question, click the home folder icon in the launcher, then File/Connect to server...
2011-11-03T00:21:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	for the second problem, launchers just point to desktop files, so if you save the .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications, you can edit it with a text editor and then drag and drop it back to the launcher
2011-11-03T00:22:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	or if you install gnome-panel, you can use: gnome-desktop-item-edit ~/.local/share/applications/launcher_name.desktop; to use the old gui dialog to edit one
2011-11-03T00:23:00.000Z	Kartagis	trism	hmm, I don't need unity launcher editor then
2011-11-03T00:25:00.000Z	Kartagis	trism	where do I find the .desktop file? /usr/share/applications/?
2011-11-03T00:26:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	yes, they are usually there
2011-11-03T00:29:00.000Z	Kartagis	trism	can you give me a /me to test?
2011-11-03T00:33:00.000Z	Kartagis		it didn't work :S
2011-11-03T00:34:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	what are you trying to do?
2011-11-03T00:35:00.000Z	Kartagis	trism	unless I start kvirc with en_US.UTF-8, I get weird stuff
2011-11-03T00:37:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	in natty, I often had to change the name of a launcher if I edited it in ~/.local/share/applications, otherwise the version in /usr/share/applications would override it (the Name= key in the .desktop file)
2011-11-03T00:38:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	I haven't used unity enough in oneiric to know if that is still an issue
2011-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	Kartagis	trism	do I need to copy it to ~/.local/share/applications?
2011-11-03T00:39:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	it is usually a good idea if you are editing it, otherwise updates can wipe out your changes (after editing, drag and drop it back to the panel, or you won't get the new version)
2011-11-03T00:40:00.000Z	Kartagis	trism	editing in /usr/share/applications/ didn't do it
2011-11-03T00:40:00.000Z	Kartagis		anyway, I'm off
2011-11-03T00:41:00.000Z	Kartagis		later
2011-11-03T00:41:00.000Z	trism	Kartagis	good luck
