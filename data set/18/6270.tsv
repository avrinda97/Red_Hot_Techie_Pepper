2008-05-30T13:40:00.000Z	a7c		does anyone know a way to extract an .exe driver without installing it?
2008-05-30T13:41:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	try opening with archive manager.
2008-05-30T13:43:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	archive manager returns "and error occurred while loading the archive", I'm gonna go with the cabextract idea
2008-05-30T13:43:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	if all else fails you can try to use wine to extract it (that's usually my last resort)
2008-05-30T13:44:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	dont have wine, never even heard of it, gonna try cabextract. brb >.<
2008-05-30T13:49:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	sudo aptitude install cabextract ?
2008-05-30T13:49:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	thanks!
2008-05-30T13:50:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	that kinda failed actually...do i need to extract it first?
2008-05-30T13:51:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	do, you have to execute this --> sudo aptitude install cabextract
2008-05-30T13:53:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	sudo aptitude update
2008-05-30T13:53:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	and then try again please
2008-05-30T13:54:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	what exactly did that acheive? (besides displaying a bunch of errors)
2008-05-30T13:55:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	sudo aptitude install cabextract shoudl install cabextract. If that won work because it cant find it, then type sudo aptitude update
2008-05-30T13:56:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	neither of those worked -.-
2008-05-30T13:56:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	what did the command << sudo aptitude update >> give you? please pastebin that.
2008-05-30T13:57:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	can't paste...irc is on a separate computer, as ubuntu comp has no internt -.-
2008-05-30T13:58:00.000Z	hischild	a7c	explains why it wont install that package. Can you get ubuntu pc with internet? Do you know how the repo's work?
2008-05-30T13:59:00.000Z	a7c	hischild	dunno what repo is, cant get internet on ubuntu pc, no hardline available -.-
