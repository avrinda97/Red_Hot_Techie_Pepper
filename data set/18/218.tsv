2012-07-03T22:24:00.000Z	Stark		Anyone know how to make a bootable volume from an ISO in Ubuntu?
2012-07-03T22:25:00.000Z	Stark		unetbootin doesn't work
2012-07-03T22:25:00.000Z	Stark		dd doesn't work
2012-07-03T22:25:00.000Z	Stark		a Windows 7 VM with Microsoft's official software for creating Windows 7 boot disks, also doesn't work
2012-07-03T22:25:00.000Z	Stark		Any other methods?
2012-07-03T22:27:00.000Z	Gyges	Stark	maybe a pc problem with booting from that usb
2012-07-03T22:27:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Same disk I used to install this installation of Ubuntu, as well as my previous Windows 7 boot disk
2012-07-03T22:27:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Plus I've tried it with another disk
2012-07-03T22:28:00.000Z	Gyges	Stark	is it fat 16?
2012-07-03T22:28:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Not sure. I've formatted it many a time in many a way, though.
2012-07-03T22:28:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Including NTFS, FAT (whichever FAT the Disk Utility does by default), and no partition scheme at all
2012-07-03T22:29:00.000Z	Gyges	Stark	FAT32 should work, but FAT16 is safe
2012-07-03T22:29:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	As in, FAT16 will *definitely* work?
2012-07-03T22:29:00.000Z	Gyges	Stark	NTFS wont do
2012-07-03T22:29:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Although, DD formats it to UDF anyway
2012-07-03T22:30:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	And a lot of things don't recognize the UDF at all, just see it as empty, e.g. Windows and GParted
2012-07-03T22:30:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Ubuntu seems to recognize the UDF volume, though
2012-07-03T22:31:00.000Z	Stark	Gyges	Not sure... it's a Dell XPS M1530 with BIOS revision 12
