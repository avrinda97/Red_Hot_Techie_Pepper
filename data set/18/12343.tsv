2007-03-05T13:17:00.000Z	TeePOG		hi guys, how do I set up ssh equivalent logins for all my machines? I need to login as admin to quite a few machines, and would prefer not to type that many ssh passwords
2007-03-05T13:18:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	you can use ssh with keys, so you only need to type the passphrase for the key
2007-03-05T13:18:00.000Z	TeePOG	Lynoure	would I have to type the passphrase every time?
2007-03-05T13:20:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	you can also set no passphrase, though I do not recommend it if you can avoid it. Or use caching.
2007-03-05T13:21:00.000Z	TeePOG	Lynoure	it'll be only from one workstation, which is in an access-controlled area. I think it'll be safe with no passphrase
2007-03-05T13:21:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	How many machines you are dealing with?
2007-03-05T13:21:00.000Z	TeePOG	Lynoure	a lab, it's about 80 all told
2007-03-05T13:22:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	access controlled physically or networkwise? You'd want both.
2007-03-05T13:22:00.000Z	TeePOG		yes Lynoure, both ...
2007-03-05T13:23:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	Well, you are the admin there, I assume, so both the decision and the responsibility on it is yours. :)
2007-03-05T13:23:00.000Z	TeePOG		yes Lynoure, thanks... just needed a bit of advice as a kickstart to a monday morning
2007-03-05T13:25:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	Enjoy the week :)

2007-03-05T13:27:00.000Z	TeePOG		actually Lynoure, i think that I'm going to go with shosts-based authentication ...
2007-03-05T13:27:00.000Z	TeePOG		it seems more secure
2007-03-05T13:28:00.000Z	TeePOG		thanks for the help Lynoure, it pointed me in the right direction
2007-03-05T13:29:00.000Z	Lynoure		[StingRay] : if you just want to fix a single bug, making a patch for the existing package can be better as then devs can apply the fix to the official ones.
2007-03-05T13:30:00.000Z	Lynoure	TeePOG	It's actually quite fun to help people who are willing to do some digging on their own too. So you are very welcome.
