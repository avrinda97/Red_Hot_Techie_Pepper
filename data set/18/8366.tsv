2007-10-12T08:51:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	I don't think that website has enough images to load
2007-10-12T08:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	what?
2007-10-12T08:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	yea i bet, u got any? this one i thot was rather amazing cuz he's using PAINT, he must have a tablet tho
2007-10-12T08:54:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	no, any 2000 dpi mouse would do the trick, and I realize doing it with photoshop would seem easier, as it is more featured, however, the quality increases with the switch. It's unbelievable
2007-10-12T08:55:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	yea but have u ever tried to draw with a mouse? its certainly not natural
2007-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	no, its simply another form of art. as sculpting is different from drawing, and drawing from painting, using a mouse is becoming more prevailent
2007-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	particularly with gaming-grade mice with high dpi sensitivity
2007-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	thats craziness when tablets are so cheap and so much easier and more functional
2007-10-12T08:57:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	i got one 4 years ago for 80$ and its seen a lot of abuse, and it still works like a charm
2007-10-12T08:58:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	^
2007-10-12T09:03:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	it probably is a tablet, based on his sketchings he builds tone and colour on
2007-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	oh ya the spiderman definitely a tablet, its apparent in his starting sketch outlines
2007-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	lines of varying opacity (black to gray)
2007-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	yea
2007-10-12T09:16:00.000Z	Evanlec	silent	lol ? why am i waatching billy joel ?
2007-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	silent	Evanlec	I set up a media center pc for watching movies on our TV... she thought linux was going to be complicated... but after a < 1 minute tutorial... "that's it??" "Wow that's really nice... its easier than windows!"
