2008-02-13T21:47:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	hmmm... okay, that could be it then
2008-02-13T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2008-02-13T21:44:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	it's already installed (I've tried using apt-get)... didn't work with Opera for whatever reason... I'll try removing/reinstalling it though
2008-02-13T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	opera should link against it in the same way firefox did
2008-02-13T21:45:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	key-word "should".... it didn't =P
2008-02-13T21:46:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	I just re-ran the installation using apt-get... opera isn't returning an error saying I need to install flash player... the area where the video should be displaying is just grey
2008-02-13T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	there was a bug with the new version of flash for operaa and konqueror
2008-02-13T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	I was under the impresion it had been fixed, that doesn't mean it has
2008-02-13T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	one moment
2008-02-13T21:47:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	alrigthy
2008-02-13T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	check the note from ubotu
2008-02-13T21:49:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	thanks!
2008-02-13T21:51:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	I followed those instructions... no luck
2008-02-13T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	the flash fix is a bit of a touch and go think, I'm not sure how the fix for opera/konqueror works so I can't comment, last time I looked it was still borked
2008-02-13T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	you may want to check out some guys in #kubuntu and see if it's working with konqueror ok
2008-02-13T21:52:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	okay... thanks for the help :)
2008-02-13T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Hammer89	bit of a weak suggestion I know, but without being able to test it myself, I can't really help out
2008-02-13T21:53:00.000Z	Hammer89	ikonia	that's alright
