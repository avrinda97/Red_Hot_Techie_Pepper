2006-07-11T11:34:00.000Z	bajsi		sorry
2006-07-11T11:34:00.000Z	bajsi		can you tell me some distro that has a purpose to act as an gateway? like ipcop and such
2006-07-11T11:35:00.000Z	obfusco	bajsi	i use monowall, very small and nice
2006-07-11T11:36:00.000Z	bajsi	obfusco	does it support vpns?
2006-07-11T11:36:00.000Z	obfusco	bajsi	personally, i use it as an IPSec gateway
2006-07-11T11:36:00.000Z	bajsi	obfusco	it works well?
2006-07-11T11:37:00.000Z	bajsi	obfusco	how is the driver support? i mean, will it find my ethernets? =))
2006-07-11T11:37:00.000Z	obfusco	bajsi	I never had trouble with it, it's a fairly low-traffic environment, but it runs well on some pII 233MHz or so
2006-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	bajsi	obfusco	strang, i cant find the image-file
2006-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	bajsi		just for soekris
2006-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	bajsi		generic-pc-1.22.img
2006-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	bajsi		maby that
2006-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	obfusco	bajsi	i found the driver support like linux in general, fairly good with a few misses here and there
2006-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	bajsi	obfusco	is "generic-pc" for a regular PC?
2006-07-11T11:39:00.000Z	obfusco	bajsi	yes, but there is a live cd that makes things easier
