2008-07-20T01:16:00.000Z	CharlieMFC		Hi, I'm very new to Ubuntu and need help do I just ask my question?
2008-07-20T01:18:00.000Z	CharlieMFC		Cool :) Right, I've installed Ubuntu within my Win XP installation as I'm very interested in changing to Linux, the install has gone fine, but I can't get my wireless adapter to work. I look into installinh Ndiswrapper, nut it says I should have a wired connection to do this. Unfortunately, I only have a wireless connection... Am I screwed?
2008-07-20T01:19:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	what is the wireless card model and brand?
2008-07-20T01:17:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	yup, just ask...
2008-07-20T01:20:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	ouch... D-Link... i never got mine to work... but it was a diffrent model, and ill admit, i was lazy and just gave up...
2008-07-20T02:00:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	can i get a link to where you downloaded it?
2008-07-20T02:02:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	im trying to open it.. hold on...

2008-07-20T02:07:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	where do you have it saved right now?
2008-07-20T02:08:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	ok, basicly, that has to be compiled
2008-07-20T02:08:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CharlieMFC	sometimes, hold on..
