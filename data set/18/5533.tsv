2008-10-07T01:27:00.000Z	luminrd		I am on a machine with integrated graphics, it only runs at around 600x800. what should I do
2008-10-07T01:28:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	run 'gksudo displayconfig-gtk' and see if you can select a more appropriate display than what's autodetected.
2008-10-07T01:30:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	hello?
2008-10-07T01:31:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	sorry! Didn't see your comment. Ok will give that a shot
2008-10-07T01:32:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	Do I need to restart X after that
2008-10-07T01:32:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	yes
2008-10-07T01:34:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	what did you do?
2008-10-07T01:35:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	ran that command you told me, and selected a different model option
2008-10-07T01:36:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	did you pick a generic one?
2008-10-07T01:36:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	yes
2008-10-07T01:37:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	did you close the dialog after that, or did you hit Ctrl-Alt-Backspace after that?
2008-10-07T01:37:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	I think I may have picked LCD though, this is a CRT. Guess I'll give it another go. Yes, I closed the dialog and restarted X
2008-10-07T01:38:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	no dice :(
2008-10-07T01:39:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	It has changed it back to "Plug n' Play"
2008-10-07T01:39:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	that shouldn't be. Did you call it with gksudo?
2008-10-07T01:39:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	indeed
2008-10-07T01:40:00.000Z	soundray	luminrd	is 800x600 the best available through System-Preferences-Screen Resolution?
2008-10-07T01:40:00.000Z	luminrd	soundray	indeed it is
