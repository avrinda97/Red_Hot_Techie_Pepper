2006-04-29T16:49:00.000Z	blindx		Okay, I want to remove all .jpg files from /media/ipod and all child folders, doing "rm -r /media/ipod/*.jpg" does not work.. anyone know why?
2006-04-29T16:49:00.000Z	blindx		but i thought -r was 'recursive'
2006-04-29T16:50:00.000Z	blindx		Well, I've also run that command in /media/ipod "rm -r *.jpg"
2006-04-29T16:50:00.000Z	blindx		and it tells me "rm: cannot remove `/media/ipod/*.jpg': No such file or directory
2006-04-29T16:50:00.000Z	blindx		"
2006-04-29T16:51:00.000Z	blindx		how do i tell it to go into directories?
2006-04-29T16:52:00.000Z	blindx		brb, no one answer my question till i get back please :P
2006-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	blindx		rm `find . -name "*.jpg"` -- now what that does, is runs the "find" command to find all .jpg files in the current and child directories, then removes them using rm, right?
2006-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	blindx		no?
2006-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	blindx		lol
2006-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	it is gonna look for all jpgs in the directory you start the command in and subdirs and deletes them
2006-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	IF it works that is
2006-04-29T05:05:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	:)
2006-04-29T05:06:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	do rm < find...
2006-04-29T05:06:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	but im not good at that
2006-04-29T05:06:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	 :)
2006-04-29T05:07:00.000Z	hachre_	blindx	try ' instead of "
