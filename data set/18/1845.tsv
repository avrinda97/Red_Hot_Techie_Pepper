2010-10-23T04:42:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	do you need to keep windows or any other os? or data?
2010-10-23T04:42:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	I just need to keep Windows 7 which is  on it's own partition. I purposely left myself free unallocated space on the hdd for this install
2010-10-23T04:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	there is a option to install side by side with windows
2010-10-23T04:43:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	I'd rather it be on a separate partition though ... that option tried to combine them side by side
2010-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	I'm just confused with how to set up my root, swap and home partitions because all the documentation on the web conflicts each other
2010-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	oh ok, do you plan to install any other linux distro, or do you plan to ever reinstall ubuntu?
2010-10-23T04:45:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	Ubuntu will be my first attempt working under Linux so I really don't know if I plan to or not .. it's best to assume I might
2010-10-23T04:45:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	ok, then you need 2 partitions, how much space did you give?
2010-10-23T04:46:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	I have 40.3gb of free space to work with
2010-10-23T04:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	ok you need a / (root) partition and a /home partition, the root should be around 8+ or up to 15-16gb, its dependant on how much applications you plan to install (i'd say 12gb is fine) then the rest for /home (which will be your userspace containing your personal data including application settings for your user
2010-10-23T04:49:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	So I won't be needing a swap/virtual memory partition at all?
2010-10-23T04:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	a swap file is just as fine (apparantly equal speeds on some sata hdds), how much ram do you have?
2010-10-23T04:50:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	4gb
2010-10-23T04:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	then a swap file should be fine, just for hibernation etc
2010-10-23T04:57:00.000Z	metap0d	aeon-ltd	Thanks man --  the install is underway!
2010-10-23T04:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	metap0d	ok best of luck :)
