2010-02-15T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brokenwall: if the system is a laptop then try websearching that too, there may be specific guides for it and how to get linux running nice
2010-02-15T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rabbi1: it can look how you want, so screenshots are fairly pointless
2010-02-15T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Joe_: that's as much as I know. I never got it running

2010-02-15T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!vmware | gngkai
2010-02-15T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gnakai: you'd be better in #vmware for vmware settings
2010-02-15T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brokenwall: I gave a command. I need the output from it
2010-02-15T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brokenwall: sorry, crossed wires
2010-02-15T23:51:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	im on my desktop, my laptop has no way to get a network connection, so I can only give you the information you want line by line
2010-02-15T23:55:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	yes the Wifi Scan shows networks, as well as my network
2010-02-15T23:55:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	but nothing will connection, WPA, WEP, or unsecured
2010-02-15T23:56:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	tried WICD it won't connect either
2010-02-15T23:56:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	I am also unable to connection via CLI using iwlist
2010-02-15T23:58:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	sorry, i meant iwconfig, which won't connect,
2010-02-16T00:00:00.000Z	brokenwall	ActionParsnip	yes there are, I have also tried going back to 9.04 as well as seeing if 10.04 works, and neither network connections work
2010-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokenwall	i'd look in your routers logs to see if it recieves the dhcp request
