2005-01-03T08:09:00.000Z	occy	cheatersrealm2	trying to get my Mom and Dad setup on Ubuntu.
2005-01-03T08:10:00.000Z	cheatersrealm2	occy	what's wrong with it?
2005-01-03T08:11:00.000Z	cheatersrealm2	occy	what happens when you try running it?
2005-01-03T08:11:00.000Z	occy	cheatersrealm2	it doesn't run :)
2005-01-03T08:11:00.000Z	cheatersrealm2	occy	does it give an error?
2005-01-03T08:12:00.000Z	occy	cheatersrealm2	I can run java games just fine.  But the app appears to try and load and then just does nothing.
2005-01-03T08:12:00.000Z	cheatersrealm2	occy	it doesn't give you any error messages?
2005-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	occy	cheatersrealm2	no, but I've verified under Windows with IE6 and Firefox that the particular web java app does indeed work.
