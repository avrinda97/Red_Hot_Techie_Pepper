2009-03-07T21:48:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		I am looking for a 8.04.2 DVD
2009-03-07T21:49:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04.2/release/ i'm afraid there's only 8.04.1 (despite the URL name)
2009-03-07T21:50:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	ok they are 8.04.1
2009-03-07T21:50:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	given that they say "dvd" in the file name, and they're 4Gb big, what do you think?
2009-03-07T21:52:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	there aren't any 8.04.2 dvds, period
2009-03-07T21:52:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	means ?
2009-03-07T21:53:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	there arnt any 8.04.2 dvd
2009-03-07T21:54:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	it means what you're looking for DOES NOT EXIST
2009-03-07T21:54:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	sorry. i can't make up a link, because there isn't a link.
2009-03-07T21:54:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	hmm
2009-03-07T21:54:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	but why do you absolutely need 8.04.2 rather than 8.04.1?
2009-03-07T21:55:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	: not strictly .. was just looking for it
2009-03-07T21:55:00.000Z	LjL	silv3r_m00n	well keep in mind that even if an 8.04.2 DVD existed, you'd likely still have to do a few APT upgrades after installing it, anyway
2009-03-07T21:56:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	: that's fine
2009-03-07T21:56:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	LjL	was just looking for the latest thing I cud get
