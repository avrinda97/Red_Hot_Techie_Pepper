2010-07-22T04:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sammy	Follow this guide to re-install grub from a LiveCD: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-07-22T04:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sammy	The problem you're having is that the grub-pc package was configured incorrectly, so grub didn't get re-installed properly when you upgraded to the new version.
2010-07-22T04:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sammy	Once you're booted again you need to make sure this doesn't happen again by running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc". It will ask you some questions, one will be what devices to install grub to. Be sure to select your boot drive and *no* partitions. Keep the other settings at their default. Some will be blank, that's normal.
2010-07-22T04:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sammy	You can choose to install to all of your drives if you're not sure which is first in the BIOS boot order, just make sure that no partitions are selected (like sda1).

2011-05-02T02:39:00.000Z	sammy	Jordan_U	I wasn't running a gui but I can. I'll run that check for the fastest mirror and then try the update. very good suggestion, thanks. 'm still not sure what 'mirror file' its talking about is missing
2011-05-02T02:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sammy	You're welcome.
