2010-04-06T07:11:00.000Z	crazygir		qmail: Depends: ucspi-tcp but it is not installable <-- why would this not be installable?
2010-04-06T07:11:00.000Z	crazygir		I also see an 'E: broken paackage'
2010-04-06T07:11:00.000Z	crazygir		any thoughts?
2010-04-06T07:12:00.000Z	crazygir		might be a bit slow
2010-04-06T07:13:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	is ucspi-tcp in your repos? Check sudo apt-get update && apt-cache search ucspi
2010-04-06T07:15:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	nothing
2010-04-06T07:16:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	so you don't have the package in your repos. That's the problem. Are you using any unofficial repos?
2010-04-06T07:17:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	I'm not that kinda user.. this is stock ubuntu server.. I would expect qmail to install fine
2010-04-06T07:18:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	hmm,.. that's weird if it's a stock installation. Have you run partial system updates?
2010-04-06T07:18:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	I haven't no, but it is possible one of my admins has.. someone else is actually responsible for this system, but I need to setup qmail :P
2010-04-06T07:19:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	how are you trying to install qmail. apt-get install or by a download .deb file?
2010-04-06T07:20:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	apt-get install
2010-04-06T07:21:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	anyway, it's good practice to run a apt-get update before installing a new package.
2010-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	no go
2010-04-06T07:26:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	qmail is is your repos right? Don't have access to an Ubuntu server to check
2010-04-06T07:27:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	qmail is, the other package isnt'
2010-04-06T07:30:00.000Z	gaveen	crazygir	it's not likely that they've included qmail without the deps. :/ Anyway, try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qmail
2010-04-06T09:20:00.000Z	crazygir	gaveen	that was for you.. sorry ganadist
