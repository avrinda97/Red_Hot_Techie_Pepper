2008-07-17T15:43:00.000Z	Peddy		can someone please tell me how to search for a file on my system that is exactly 226MB? Thanks
2008-07-17T15:44:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	find might have some switches to search for a specific file size..man find for syntax
2008-07-17T15:45:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	any specific ideas? I don't even know where to begin :O
2008-07-17T15:47:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	I've got a simpler solution... right click on your gnome panel (the grey thing where the applications menu is located).. select "+Add to panel".. find the Search for files app.. click ok
2008-07-17T15:47:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	now click that new icon on the panel.. you can search for names, sizes, dates etc
2008-07-17T15:48:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	is the program just called 'search', because I already have tracker installed.
2008-07-17T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	nope.. I didn't mean the tracker search thingy.. although you might be able to use that too
2008-07-17T15:49:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	so its just 'search'?
2008-07-17T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	 but I think it only searches files you've already indexed.. that other one "Search for files..." searches everything in the file tree
2008-07-17T15:51:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	there's no app called 'search for files'. Only 'search', and 'tracker search tool', and some other irrelevant stuff.
2008-07-17T15:51:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	I have all repos enabled.
2008-07-17T15:54:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	here's a screenshot of my "Add to panel" window http://i38.tinypic.com/15xvbf5.jpg
2008-07-17T15:55:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	oh man I'm sorry, I was looking at my add/remove window :O
2008-07-17T15:55:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	I'm trying it now.
2008-07-17T15:55:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	hehe.. try again =)
2008-07-17T15:59:00.000Z	Peddy	Slart	thanks for the help, I'm sure It'll turn something up. Handy tool, btw.
2008-07-17T15:59:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	yes, it's nice
2009-01-17T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	Peddy	install the ssh server.. configure it.. start it
