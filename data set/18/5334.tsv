2008-11-08T18:29:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity		Hi! What kernel modules run laptop keyboards/touchpads?
2008-11-08T18:31:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	I guess they're often treated like mice (not all of course). To see the modules available in vanilla kernel, doenload kernel source, unpack, do "make manuconfig" and have a look.
2008-11-08T18:32:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	ehm, damned typos: make menuconfig, of course
2008-11-08T18:32:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	hmm.
2008-11-08T18:32:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	my problem is that my laptop keyboard/touchpad have stopped working in both livecd and install
2008-11-08T18:33:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	hmm... try to investigate kernel log
2008-11-08T18:33:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	I figured that rmmodding and modprobing the keyboard module might help
2008-11-08T18:33:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	yeah, am reading dmesg now
2008-11-08T18:33:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	similar think happened to me years ago; the thing was that there was a specific module added and my touchpad got treated "specially", thus breaking what was working before :-/
2008-11-08T18:34:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	hmmm
2008-11-08T18:39:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	any idea which modules? what make of laptop was it?
2008-11-08T18:39:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	don't remember the module, but it was >3 yrs ago on a prehistoric noname gericom/clevo laptop :)
2008-11-08T18:40:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	if you "make menuconfig" with recent kernel, you can see what touchpad drivers are available
2008-11-08T18:40:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	will try that, thanks
2008-11-08T18:41:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	on a side note, I still am using the laptop occasionaly :)
2008-11-08T18:42:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	same issue on gentoo livecd :O
2008-11-08T18:42:00.000Z	dent	Insomnia1ity	I remember I forced the touchpad to be treated like ps2 mouse somehow
2008-11-08T18:43:00.000Z	Insomnia1ity	dent	dmesg indicates it already is a PS/2 mouse
