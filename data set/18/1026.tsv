2011-06-30T08:09:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE		how do I copy from a removable device to my home folder? (in terminal)
2011-06-30T08:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	is it mounted?  cp /media/usb-location/files.txt /home/username/pathtocopyto
2011-06-30T08:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	ok. then that command, but with the actual paths. if it automounted, it should be in /media/
2011-06-30T08:13:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	cp -r /source /destination  if you want recursive copy. mv /source /dest  to move
2011-06-30T08:13:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	it automounted, but it's not in media.
2011-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	maybe in /mnt
2011-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	nope
2011-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	type  mount   and hit enter. if it's mounted, it'll be listed
2011-06-30T08:15:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	it's a zune, it's listed, and I can access the files, but I cannot copy them.
2011-06-30T08:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	what output does mount give you?
2011-06-30T08:21:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	not sure. I can see both hard drives, but not my zune.
2011-06-30T08:21:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	and I don't know what it would call my zune...
2011-06-30T08:21:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	"see"? in nautilus you mean? type mount  in a terminal, and pastebin the output.   dmesg  as well
2011-06-30T08:29:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	you could get vmware and windows...
2011-06-30T08:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	maybe if you snoop the usb and become a c guru, you could write the world a zune driver?
2011-06-30T08:47:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	I've got some friends who could write the driver, I just have to figure out how to crack my way in. there's a way to do it in windows, but I can't implement the same strategy in ubuntu
2011-06-30T08:50:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	THIS_IS_INSANE	root won't help. not if there is no driver. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=622332
2011-06-30T08:52:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	Seven_Six_Two	in theory, if you convinced the zune that what it was connecting to was the zune software, it would grant complete read/write access, this would make it possible to do what I'm saying
