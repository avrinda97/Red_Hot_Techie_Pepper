2010-02-12T18:42:00.000Z	DexterLB		hi
2010-02-12T18:42:00.000Z	DexterLB		I have a ~/torrents folder which occupies 100%+several bytes of the disk space, and all software reports that I have no free diskspace left. But fdisk -l shows that that's not the case, and the problem is that ~/torrents is actually a symlink that points to a big folder on another filesystem (smbfs). how do I fix the false readings?
2010-02-12T18:43:00.000Z	ascheel	DexterLB	type this:  df -h
2010-02-12T18:43:00.000Z	DexterLB		and /home is 100% used
2010-02-12T18:44:00.000Z	DexterLB		as reported by df -h
2010-02-12T18:44:00.000Z	ascheel	DexterLB	then it's 100% used.  it doesn't lie.
2010-02-12T18:44:00.000Z	DexterLB		no it's not a share, it's a SYMLINK
2010-02-12T18:45:00.000Z	DexterLB		it points to a share
2010-02-12T18:45:00.000Z	DexterLB		sorry for caps
2010-02-12T18:45:00.000Z	DexterLB		!caps|DexterLB
2010-02-12T18:45:00.000Z	DexterLB		du|sort also says that ~/torrents is the biggest
2010-02-12T18:46:00.000Z	ascheel	DexterLB	then cd to ~/torrents and type this:  du -sh
2010-02-12T18:46:00.000Z	DexterLB	ascheel	it says it's 11Gb
2010-02-12T18:46:00.000Z	ascheel	DexterLB	do you disagree with that?
2010-02-12T18:47:00.000Z	DexterLB		no
2010-02-12T18:47:00.000Z	DexterLB		it's correct
2010-02-12T18:47:00.000Z	DexterLB		and the entire HDD is 20Gb
2010-02-12T18:47:00.000Z	ascheel	DexterLB	I guess I'm confused.  What's the problem?
