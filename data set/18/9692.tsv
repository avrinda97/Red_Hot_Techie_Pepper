2012-06-14T12:56:00.000Z	AdvoWork		is there anything out there that will report disk usage on /  thats not slow? im doing du -csh /  but it takes forever!! and doesn't report anything for ages, and massively slows my system down
2012-06-14T12:57:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	would 'df' be enough?
2012-06-14T13:01:00.000Z	AdvoWork	fidel	not really, i need to know whats taking up all the space on my drive, ie which folder(s)
2012-07-11T15:07:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	apt-cache policy PACKAGENAME will show you the available versions via your sources
2012-07-11T15:08:00.000Z	AdvoWork	fidel	that lists 9.1 but thats too current for what I need
2012-07-12T12:24:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	in case you want to sync them ..rsync might be an option
2012-07-12T12:27:00.000Z	AdvoWork	fidel	basically i'm mounting a folder to another location on a shared server so just want to make sure they contain all files
2012-07-12T12:28:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	see c3l's comment
2012-07-12T12:30:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	using 'diff' in cli might work as well
2012-07-12T12:34:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	let us know what method you have choosen at the end ;)
2012-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	talking about nautilus/ thunar or ?
2012-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	AdvoWork	fidel	that i'm not sure, any idea how I find that out?
2012-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	you dont know what app you are using?
2012-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	if so - shame on you -> click help -> about ;)
2012-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	AdvoWork	fidel	its just the default file browser on a new installation, so i assume nautilius?
2012-07-27T14:42:00.000Z	AdvoWork	fidel	so any ideas? its nautilis 3.4.2
2012-07-27T14:42:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	rephrase your question - and lets see ;)
2012-07-27T14:45:00.000Z	fidel	AdvoWork	seems like you might need to use gconf editor ro enable a user-enterable path inside nautilus
