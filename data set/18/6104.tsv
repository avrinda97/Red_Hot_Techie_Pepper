2008-07-19T03:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	Why not have it just listen on 80 ?
2008-07-19T03:02:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	im not sure it will work. in the end i'd like FTP,ssh, and that application to all work behind whatever firewall/router they have.
2008-07-19T03:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	I would suggest installing something like webshell that will almost certainly work if you set it to listen on port 433 that way you can fix the other stuff once you are behind the firewall and know what they do and don't block

2008-07-19T03:07:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	great idea, thanks. hopefully that wont kill my server (P2 256RAM
2008-07-19T03:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	Actually you probably want the original http://antony.lesuisse.org/qweb/trac/wiki/AjaxTerm unless you need iphone compatibility :)
2008-07-19T03:10:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	you're right. btw, this thing is beautiful! ive been looking for something like this for a while
2008-09-01T09:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	System -> Preferences -> Session make sure that network manager applet is checked
2008-09-01T09:42:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	i dont see a preferences in my system panel
2008-09-01T09:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	That's very odd
2008-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	i suppose it would be.
2008-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	Right click on System, choose edit menu and see if Preferences is just unchecked or actually missing
2008-09-01T09:46:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	right clicking just opens the panel
2008-09-01T09:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	Ok, try "alacarte" at a terminal or run dialog
2008-09-01T09:48:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	my desktop envirnment is seriously messed up. i dont even have a desktop. im just going to reinstall xubuntu and be done with it
2008-09-01T09:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	Wait
2008-09-01T09:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FarmCretin	Try simply creating a new user and see if it has a desktop / network manager applet etc
2008-09-01T09:50:00.000Z	FarmCretin	Jordan_U	great idea, ill do that now. if not, then i'll reinstall. thanks btw
