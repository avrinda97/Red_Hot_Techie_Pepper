2007-06-09T05:28:00.000Z	omegacenti_		Alright, wish me luck.. deleting my windows partition :)
2007-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	omegacenti_		I can hear something screaming in my laptop...
2007-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	omegacenti_		oh? I just thought it was the soul of windows dying...
2007-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	omegacenti_		Hmm, It doesn't seem like it wants to let me unmount sda1 (NTFS partition) Most likely other partitions are also mounted on these mountpoints. You are advised to unmount them manually.
2007-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	omegacenti_		Any suggestions?
2007-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	omegacenti_		[agatha] : Doh.
2007-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	omegacenti_		Gah! can I force an unmount?
2007-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	sudo umount doesn't work?
2007-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	omegacenti_	erisco	I didnt try it... how would I unmount sda1 with that command?
2007-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	sudo umount /sda1
2007-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	I think
2007-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	just type in $ mount and see what it is mounted as
2007-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	it won't blow anything up :P
2007-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	omegacenti_	erisco	I have no idea how to implement "$ mount". Mind clarifying?
2007-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	when something starts with that dollar sign it means to put it into your terminal :P
2007-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	omegacenti_	erisco	oooo nifty... shows what everything is and where.. nice
2007-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	omegacenti_	erisco	I am new but love to learn :)
2007-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	erisco	omegacenti_	yes it does. You should see where sda1 is mounted
