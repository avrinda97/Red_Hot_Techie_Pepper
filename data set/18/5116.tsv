2008-12-09T03:39:00.000Z	Rolaulten	samile	just enter the path to the sscript - /home/user/script?
2008-12-09T03:39:00.000Z	samile	Rolaulten	yes the script must have executable permissions though
2008-12-09T03:40:00.000Z	Rolaulten	samile	yea, I did that part with chmod
2008-12-09T03:40:00.000Z	samile	Rolaulten	what output did you get when running the script
