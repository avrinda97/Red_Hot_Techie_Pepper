2009-03-11T04:51:00.000Z	AngryElf		okay -- I've got 1.5GB of memory in this box -- cat /proc/meminfo says that only ~40MB is free, top only has 4 processes using >0% memory (10 + 5 + 5 + 2)% which is no where near ~1.1GB of ram -- so where is all my memory going to?
2009-03-11T04:52:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	run "free -m", and the second line with numbers is the values you actually care about
2009-03-11T04:52:00.000Z	AngryElf		total: 1516, used 1482
2009-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	were those numbers from the first or second line with numbers?
2009-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	AngryElf		1.3GB of ram to run a recently opened firefox - 4 terminals, calc and pidgin?
2009-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	AngryElf	cbane	first line
2009-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	you don't care about that line
2009-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	AngryElf		the swap?
2009-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	it's the second line with numbers you actually care about
2009-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	AngryElf		the -/+ buffers/cache line?
2009-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	yes
2009-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	AngryElf		looks like -- used: 411, free: 1104
2009-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	AngryElf		"-/+ buffers/cache" runs into where the total might be
2009-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	so you have 1104 MB free
2009-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	the rest is being used to cache stuff from your hard drive, and other things like that
2009-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	AngryElf	cbane	it feels like the first line -- 1516/1390/125 total/used/freer
2009-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	cbane	AngryElf	it will be released if anything actually needs the memory
2009-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	AngryElf	cbane	thanks
