2009-03-27T02:57:00.000Z	jado		hi, how can i connect with ssh to a computer which has an IP 'ip' and a name 'name'
2009-03-27T02:59:00.000Z	jado		i do have a ssh server that i have just installed
2009-03-27T02:59:00.000Z	jado		actually, i'm trying ssh username@ip but that asks me a password : Password: and i can't find it
2009-03-27T02:59:00.000Z	jado		when i try ssh username@localhost that asks me a password and entering mine workd
2009-03-27T02:59:00.000Z	janjud	jado	why not just clarify things, what is the exact ip address so we can advise you correctly?
2009-03-27T03:01:00.000Z	jado	janjud	why would you need the ip address ?
2009-03-27T03:02:00.000Z	janjud	jado	you  are making it more difficult if you dont give full info, we have to ask you several more questions..so please provide clear info right away so no more asking back and forth
2009-03-27T03:04:00.000Z	jado	janjud	this info is correct and complete ; i'm on a local network which ip is x and my username is y ; i have tried to connect to my own ssh server (on my own computer) with ssh y@x mais that asks me a password that i cannot find ; i have also tried with ssh y@localhost or ssh y@mycomputername and with these commands that asks me a password which is the password for the username x
2009-03-27T03:05:00.000Z	jado	janjud	ask me if you need something else
2009-03-27T03:06:00.000Z	janjud	jado	try this instead  ssh -l username x
2009-03-27T03:06:00.000Z	janjud	jado	try this instead  ssh -l username x   or in your case  ssh -l y x
2009-03-27T03:07:00.000Z	janjud	jado	but if you can not find your own password for the user y, umm login as root and change the password for user y
2009-03-27T03:08:00.000Z	jado	janjud	actually the problem is that it's not the password for y that is asked when i enter your command
2009-03-27T03:08:00.000Z	janjud	jado	well its not clear what you are asking for then,
2009-03-27T03:09:00.000Z	janjud	jado	make sure the remote host has entries in either /etc/host or your nameresolver can resolv the remote hostname
2009-03-27T03:09:00.000Z	janjud	jado	thats why if you are only clear of your ip address, it gets much easier.. anyhow am off for now
2009-03-27T03:10:00.000Z	janjud	jado	see that, we have to make so many assumptions,  you were not clear to begin with.. you are wasting our time
2009-03-27T03:10:00.000Z	jado	janjud	ok. sorry i wasted your time ; bye
