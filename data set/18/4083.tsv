2009-06-10T21:08:00.000Z	bushpig		can somebody help me please, I am trying to recover data from a desktop hard drive.  I am on a laptop booting ubunto live cd and the data i want to recover is in a USB enclosure and connected.  Ubunto is recognising it and i can navigate into the drive but only get so far, when i try and enter /home/myuser it says i have no permissions
2009-06-10T21:09:00.000Z	bushpig		so i have tried via the terminal and then it gets weird.  From terminal i try and navigate into /media/disk/home
2009-06-10T21:09:00.000Z	bushpig		but in that path it only displayed 'ubunto' not my users

2009-06-10T21:12:00.000Z	isaac_	bushpig	try it with booting Puppy instead of Ubuntu.  I use Puppy a lot for forensics/recovery.
2009-06-10T21:13:00.000Z	isaac_	bushpig	Puppy Linux.  Very small distro, very handy.  Boots USB drives.
2009-06-10T21:13:00.000Z	bushpig	isaac_	 reiserFS also ubunto has split the drive into 2 directories disk and disk-1 must be partitions
2009-06-10T21:14:00.000Z	isaac_	bushpig	I recommend it for anyone booting from a live cd to work on a crashed install.
2009-06-10T21:16:00.000Z	bushpig	isaac_	 sounds like a possible plan but i am hoping to get it done via the live cd i am on, do you know why i cannot navigate into my home/myuseR? it ust goes /media/disk/, it lists the drives folders but when i try and enter /home it lets me but then displays 'ubunto and nothing of what should be there, it inda loops me back
2009-06-10T21:17:00.000Z	bushpig	isaac_	 i seem to have nailed it
2009-06-10T21:17:00.000Z	isaac_	bushpig	go to View, show hidden files
2009-06-10T21:18:00.000Z	bushpig	isaac_	 ok how do i now locate the laptops hard drive?
2009-06-10T21:20:00.000Z	isaac_	bushpig	if My Computer doesn't show the internal hard drive it may have failed.  Try /media/ folder and see what drives are listed.
2009-06-10T21:21:00.000Z	bushpig	isaac_	 i need the path as i am using terminal
2009-06-10T21:24:00.000Z	bushpig	isaac_	 root@ubuntu:/media/disk/home/khronus# cp /media/disk/home/khronus/ /media/USB2
