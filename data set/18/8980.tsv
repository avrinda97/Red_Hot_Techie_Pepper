2007-05-28T05:01:00.000Z	aphrodite1	gnomefreak	Terminal, firefox, etc., work fine, but everything else is rectangles. sys: 1: PangoWarning: No builtin or dynamically loaded modules were found. This probably means that there was an error in the creation of: '/etc/pango/pango.modules'. You should create this file by running pango-querymodules.
2007-05-28T05:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aphrodite1	did you run that command?
2007-05-28T05:01:00.000Z	aphrodite1	gnomefreak	how do I run that command?
2007-05-28T05:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aphrodite1	try pango-querymodules
2007-05-28T05:02:00.000Z	aphrodite1	gnomefreak	thanks i'll just try
2007-05-28T05:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aphrodite1	if not try apt-cache search libpango and install one of them (cant think of the exact name of package off hand.
2007-05-28T05:03:00.000Z	aphrodite1	gnomefreak	running pango-querymodules says command not found
2007-05-28T05:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aphrodite1	give me a few minutes to finish what i am doing and when i return i will help you more. right now i have 4 ttys open and its geting hard to keep track of everthing im running
2007-05-28T05:04:00.000Z	aphrodite1	gnomefreak	trouble is outside of terminal and firefox i can't see what i'm doing. can i run synaptix in term to get rid of pango?
2007-05-28T05:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aphrodite1	synaptic yes might work but you have to know the package. you shouldnt need to remove pango as iirc it is needed for alot of apps
2007-05-28T05:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aphrodite1	try sudo apt-get install --reinstall libpango.... whatever the package name is
