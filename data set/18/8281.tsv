2007-09-11T07:19:00.000Z	Ignominy		Who can I talk to about an install problem?
2007-09-11T07:20:00.000Z	Ignominy		When I go to boot from the CD I get the following message: "The system memory manager (EMM386.EXE) has detected an error caused by a fault in one of the device drivers or programs loaded in the system.
2007-09-11T07:20:00.000Z	Ignominy		Due to this fault, the system is probably in an unstable state, and you are therefore recommended to reboot the computer immediately. If the problem persists, then try to isolate which program is at fault (if you have loaded several, then load them one at a time until the fault appears), then contact the technical support department for that program.
2007-09-11T07:21:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	isn't that a windows error?
2007-09-11T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	I had a problem like that after partitioning with gparted.  try    sudo fdisk -l   in a terminal , fdisk told me my partition table was fubar'd. I had to repartition with cfdisk and reinstall everything
2007-09-11T07:24:00.000Z	Ignominy	nickrud	I can't even get to Grub.
2007-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	try with a livecd I guess.
2007-09-12T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	well, it's not necessarily bad
2007-09-12T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	what did it, that's the pertinent question
2007-09-12T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	no, only an option added to your current config
2007-09-12T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	then it did exactly what you asked it to, that's an option you just set for your nvidia driver
2007-09-12T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	install the ntfs-config package
2007-09-12T08:34:00.000Z	Ignominy	nickrud	did that as well.
2007-09-12T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	thats about all I know about ntfs-3g, I don't write to ext3 with windows or ntfs with linux
2007-09-12T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	I only read: I'm gonna be booting into that os to use anything I would have written, so I just read it from there
2007-09-12T08:37:00.000Z	Ignominy	nickrud	my WinXP install has gone bad (corrupt driver, I think) and repeated attempts to fix the install aren't going so well.  What I'm trying to do with the ntfs-3g is transfer files from one ntfs drive to another ntfs so I don't loose data.  any suggestions?
2007-09-12T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	put it on an ext3, when you finally fix your windows, read it with an ext3 driver
2007-09-12T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Ignominy	that's just a personal pref, I'm real conservative with my data. I didn't switch to ext3 from ext2 for a couple of years
