2007-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	so do u know another gutsy goblin mirror? then the official ubuntu tribe 5 download link in the devlopers news letter(s)
2007-08-26T08:29:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	none of them seem to have tribe 5....
2007-08-26T09:50:00.000Z	rexy_	FFForever	boot the live cd
2007-08-26T10:17:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	any clue why it can't mount selected partition?
2007-08-26T10:17:00.000Z	rexy_	FFForever	does the partition exist?
2007-08-26T10:18:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	i just restored grub......
2007-08-26T10:18:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	they where there when i did a fdisk -l.....
2007-08-26T10:18:00.000Z	rexy_	FFForever	check the partitions with fdisk?
2007-08-26T10:19:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	can i get a partition list from grub's command line?
2007-08-26T10:21:00.000Z	rexy_	FFForever	it ussually works, just hardware mixing and sound daemons need better integration
2007-08-26T10:22:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	but why can't more then one device use sound at a time?
2007-08-26T10:22:00.000Z	rexy_	FFForever	because your device probably doesnt support hardware mixing, thats what you use sounddaemons for
2007-08-26T10:27:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	should i just reinstall ubuntu :D
2007-08-26T10:28:00.000Z	rexy_	FFForever	you should be able to repear grub from the livecd
2007-08-26T10:28:00.000Z	FFForever	rexy_	the funny thing is i am looking at the grub menu.lst and it all looks right
