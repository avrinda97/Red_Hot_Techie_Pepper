2012-03-04T04:28:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	so your connecting to the ssh server from the same machine the server is running on, so you know it works, however you want to connect remotely?
2012-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	are you connecting to the ssh server from the same machine?
2012-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	i can connec to it in the same network but not out side the network its in
2012-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	 no
2012-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	from my laptop
2012-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	ah right... well you need to make sure that the correct port is open on your router/firewall
2012-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	ok
2012-03-04T04:32:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	give me a sec :)
2012-03-04T04:32:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	then you should be able to connect via your IP or hostname depending on your DNS etc
2012-03-04T04:33:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	how do i setup dns on the server?
2012-03-04T04:34:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	that's a very large question, I'd suggest Googling for specific tutorials
2012-03-04T04:35:00.000Z	jeregon	tr33m4n	all i want is to set an address to my server and connect to it persay in the librery
2012-03-04T04:37:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	if you have a domain name hosted by someone, simply add an A record to the DNS settings provided by them pointing to your IP address
2012-03-04T04:39:00.000Z	tr33m4n	jeregon	however if you have a dynamic ip you will have to sign up for a service like DynDNS, otherwise you'll have to keep writing down your ip everytime the connection refreshes
