2006-03-03T13:54:00.000Z	andrewski		does anyone know why i cannot run anything through sudo?  i try 'sudo ls' and get nothing, just back to the terminal.
2006-03-03T13:54:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	then you have no files there
2006-03-03T13:55:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	"ls" wont return anything if no files are there
2006-03-03T13:55:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	try "ls -l"
2006-03-03T13:56:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	dyrne: no, i can't do *anything*.  that's just my "obvious" test; this is in my ~.  i noticed this because i couldn't adjust the time or the start the network or users programs....
2006-03-03T13:56:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	just try "sudo -s" and tell me if it changes u to "root"
2006-03-03T13:57:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	no, keeps me listed as "andrew", according to my PS1.
2006-03-03T13:57:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	hm that seems pretty messed up. perhaps ur sudo binary is broken.
2006-03-03T13:58:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	i guess that's possible, though i just upgraded to the latest breezy version.
2006-03-03T13:58:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	i was thinking it was just my user, but i created a test user and tested there with the same result.
2006-03-03T13:58:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	does it actually ask u for ur user password when u try to sudo anything?
2006-03-03T13:58:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	yeah, as you'd expect: the first time, and not after that for a while.
2006-03-03T13:59:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	hmm, im sorry i dont know what to suggest, that seems like an odd problem. something iver never came across
2006-03-03T13:59:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	but i don't get any errors or anything... 'sudo ls' returns nothing, as does 'gksudo users-admin' (after typing my password, of course, which does pop up)
2006-03-03T14:00:00.000Z	linkd	andrewski	sorry :( no idea
2006-03-03T14:00:00.000Z	andrewski	linkd	no worries, thanks for helping. :)
