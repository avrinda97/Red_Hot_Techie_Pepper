2007-04-17T07:11:00.000Z	Shootfaster	Juanca	- I had a problem like this on a faulty hard drive
2007-04-17T07:11:00.000Z	Shootfaster	Juanca	- but hopefully its only a BIOS problem
2007-04-17T07:12:00.000Z	Shootfaster	Juanca	- boot up your PC and click del (or f2, whatever key it says) to get to your bios
2007-04-17T07:13:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	I will do it right now
2007-04-17T07:16:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	I think it detect it, it says SAMSUNG SP...
2007-04-17T07:18:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	and the boot priority is set: cd, floppy, HD, ethernet
2007-04-17T07:23:00.000Z	Shootfaster	Juanca	- just a thought - did you commit changes to gparted?
2007-04-17T07:24:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	What you mean "to Gparted", with Gparted yes I did "erase" the previous partition I've made
2007-04-17T07:24:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	I think maybe I did it wrong and left something blocked or something
2007-04-17T07:25:00.000Z	Shootfaster	Juanca	- when you make changes in gpartedd, it just sort of shows you a preview of what your about to do. It wont touch the disk till you click on commit
2007-04-17T07:28:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	What do I do. Do I start with the ubuntu CD again to check?
2007-04-17T07:31:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfaster	no, I'm in another pc now, but I can start it
2007-04-17T07:33:00.000Z	Shootfaster	Juanca	join #Shootfast
