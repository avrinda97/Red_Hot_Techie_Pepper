2012-04-26T14:18:00.000Z	Ben64		i'm seeding it on my server.
2012-04-26T14:18:00.000Z	Ben64		it is out.
2012-04-26T14:18:00.000Z	Ben64		it's out
2012-04-26T14:19:00.000Z	Ben64		http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/

2012-04-26T14:19:00.000Z	Ben64		read the page i linked
2012-04-26T14:19:00.000Z	LjL	Ben64	it's not been announced, and anyway take this to #ubuntu-release-party, it doesn't belong here
2012-04-26T14:20:00.000Z	Ben64		its on ubuntu.com!
2012-04-26T14:20:00.000Z	Ben64		http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/
2012-04-26T14:20:00.000Z	LjL		sigh
2012-04-26T14:20:00.000Z	LjL		next one who says it's out or posts a link gets a ban
2012-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	Ben64		whats with the power tripping and ignorance
2012-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	LjL		#UBUNTU IS A SUPPORT CHANNEL - take this to #ubuntu-release-party or #ubuntu-offtopic - anything that's not Ubuntu technical support doesn't belong here. clear enough?
2012-04-26T14:25:00.000Z	Ben64	ThePendulum	don't talk about 12.04 in here until the topic changes or people get mad at you
2012-04-26T14:25:00.000Z	LjL	Ben64	no need to jump at them, they've been informed, they know now, they said "ok". if you have grudges with the rules, take them to #ubuntu-ops
