2011-08-22T18:14:00.000Z	Dans326		My wife crashes her computer more than anyone Ive ever seen so I want to simply install windows and her apps then clone the hard drive to my server then next time she crashes it I just go to the server and tell it to restore her computer is this possible
2011-08-22T18:15:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	maybe its' hard ware issues
2011-08-22T18:16:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	2 years ago I got us identical systems  with in three months hers had crashed twice the second time the hard drive was toast  shes on her third computer and countless reinstalls
2011-08-22T18:19:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	nope Ive done scans of her machine checked for anything and everything  hell last time I did a reinstall got it all working she installed her sims game then rebooted and it came up with system restore
2011-08-22T18:21:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	really weird
2011-08-22T18:23:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	: something is definitely messing up
2011-08-22T18:24:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	so Ive basically given up on figuring out what she is doing to it and just looking for a quick fix for it. So is there a way to just install everything and then clone the HD to my server  and then later restore using network boot
2011-08-22T18:24:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	like full backup?
2011-08-22T18:25:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	regular back up hard drive is common though?
2011-08-22T18:25:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	yea just clone it once and then use that same starting point
2011-08-22T18:29:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	: I'm not shore really, i have always had a separate harddisk for that
2011-08-22T18:29:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	destroying 3 sets of hardware in 2 years should also be unheard of
2011-08-22T18:30:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	yeah, a bit weird
2011-08-22T18:30:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	 its been theorized that my wifes body has an excess electrical charge that effects electronics but the only proof of this is the number of toasted computers she leaves in her wake
2011-08-22T18:31:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	 lol, a seriously led-padded laptop lol
2011-08-22T18:32:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	I have heard of that, one guy had to walk around with one onion in each of his hands every day, for his body to decharge
2011-08-22T18:34:00.000Z	Dans326	silverarrow	 I dont know about that but my wife cannot wear digital watches they never last more than a week or so even with coating the metal portions with nail polish
2011-08-22T18:35:00.000Z	silverarrow	Dans326	maybe she should try a good walk in nature, every day, with one onion in each of her hands LOL
