2008-02-10T10:00:00.000Z	papuccino1		Hello
2008-02-10T10:00:00.000Z	papuccino1		Just wanted to say, whoever invented the "negative window" is a freakin' genius.
2008-02-10T10:00:00.000Z	papuccino1		It's so useful for reading ebooks or any text.
2008-02-10T10:00:00.000Z	papuccino1		So easy on the eyes.
2008-02-10T10:00:00.000Z	papuccino1		Try it out if you have compiz
2008-02-10T10:01:00.000Z	papuccino1		superkey + n    (superkey is the windows key)
2008-02-10T10:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	papuccino1	ok you've got my curiosity.. how to I make a window "negative"
2008-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	papuccino1		Just press superkey + n Scunizi
2008-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	papuccino1		You have to activate it in the compiz gnome manager.
2008-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	papuccino1	do you have to have all the bells and whistles turned on?
2008-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	papuccino1	Scunizi	System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Settings
2008-02-10T10:03:00.000Z	papuccino1	Scunizi	no, I only have the ones I like for instance, while holding the windows key and mousewheel up I zoom in dynamically. WHICH IS SUPER USEFUL.
2008-02-10T10:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	papuccino1	yes  I use that too.. can I make any window negative?  It's not working in xchat
2008-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	papuccino1		Maybe you don't have it activated.
2008-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	papuccino1	Scunizi	search for it in the Gnome Compiz Manager.
2008-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	papuccino1	never mind I found it.. in ccsm.. nice!
2008-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	papuccino1	Scunizi	how about it huh? Incredible, so much easier on the eyes. -cries-
2008-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	papuccino1	reminds me of irssi
