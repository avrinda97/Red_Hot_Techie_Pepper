2006-11-28T14:09:00.000Z	poolkey172		Hi guys .... anyone know how I can probe for my soundcard ?
2006-11-28T14:09:00.000Z	poolkey172		lspci
2006-11-28T14:10:00.000Z	poolkey172		Hmmm that is strange....
2006-11-28T14:12:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	yes. go here and follow the instructions: http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ . You should be able to locate your soundcard and which module it uses. then "sudo modprobe modulename" to enable it
2006-11-28T14:14:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	going to check if your soundcard is ok? play a sound to it. "aplay /usr/share/sounds/login.wav"
2006-11-28T14:18:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	no idea. check the fluxbox man pages :)
2006-11-28T14:19:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	i have no idea how to do that or if doing it from KDE will work
2006-11-28T14:21:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	a window managers (fluxbox, openbox, pekwm etc) keyboard shortcuts are specific to that window manager. you will probably find better help on the fluxbox homepage or irc channel
2006-11-28T14:22:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	if you use fluxbox as a window manager for KDE then it is the fluxbox keyboard shortcuts you will need to set.
2006-11-28T14:23:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	you will probably not ("probably" since I make a guess here) be able to set them in a KDE app.
2006-11-28T14:24:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	maybe this will help or maybe it won't. you might be able to set it in the fluxconf application...?
2006-11-28T14:25:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	i do not know
2006-11-28T14:35:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	yes that is one way of doing it.
2006-11-28T14:37:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	i thought you had a problem with keybindings, not the keyboard map
2006-11-28T14:39:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	glad you managed to find out yourself :)
2006-11-28T14:40:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	depends on your keyboard. I need to use the pc105 to get the correct mapping even if my keyboard lack a numeric keypad :(
2006-11-28T14:41:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	no, a swedish one
2006-11-28T14:42:00.000Z	Jowi	poolkey172	the pc105 is about the physical model of the keyboard. then you can specify the language with XkbLayout in xorg.conf
