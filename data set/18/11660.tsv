2006-08-15T08:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	sounds proprietary, write them
2006-08-15T08:13:00.000Z	Denial	eyequeue	i dont have an dvdrom i need only some files from the daa file ...
2006-08-15T08:15:00.000Z	Denial	eyequeue	but i dont have poweriso in source list ... `!?
2006-08-15T08:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	if it is "compressed, password protected, etc" i think you're stuck
2006-08-15T08:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	no, as i said, it sounds proprietary
2006-08-15T08:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	pay then #30, plus pay that other company for their "os" if you need those files, i guess
2006-08-15T08:18:00.000Z	Denial	eyequeue	 proprietary ?
2006-08-15T08:18:00.000Z	Denial	eyequeue	 what os ? sorry i dont understand
2006-08-15T08:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	$29.95 http://www.poweriso.com/    plus microsoft windows
2006-08-15T08:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	i don't know what ms charges these days for that
2006-08-15T08:19:00.000Z	Denial	eyequeue	mkay , is there no Open src tool for ?
2006-08-15T08:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	Denial	as i said, it seems to be a proprietary format, write them and ask them to use OPEN protocols
2006-08-15T08:21:00.000Z	Denial	eyequeue	lol i understand now ;o)
