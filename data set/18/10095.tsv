2009-05-17T08:09:00.000Z	ttmrichter		Is there anybody present who can assist with setting up an SSH-tunnel-through-Squid proxy?
2009-05-17T08:09:00.000Z	ttmrichter		I followed the guide on howtoforge but came up empty on actual results.
2009-05-17T08:10:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	ttmrichter	it may be due to the fact that squid will proxy http application layer traffic... and not just a generic TCP connection, specifically SSH.
2009-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	ttmrichter	you may have some luck tunneling ssh through an HTTP tunnel...
2009-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	I'm using SSH as an HTTP tunnel.
2009-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		hehe... yeah I know...
2009-05-17T08:12:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	ssh -L 8080:myserver:8080 to be precise.
2009-05-17T08:12:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	ttmrichter	is squid proxying port 22?
2009-05-17T08:12:00.000Z	ttmrichter		This is a configuration I've used before on someone else's box, but that person is incommunicado so I'm trying it on a VPS of my own.
2009-05-17T08:13:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	I don't know?
2009-05-17T08:13:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	Why would it?  I'm tunnelling local 8080 to remote 8080.  Squid shouldn't see 22 at all.
2009-05-17T08:14:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	ttmrichter	perhaps I was assuming something about your question.  I thought you are on a host behind a squid proxy... intercepting port 22 traffic.
2009-05-17T08:15:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	I'm behind the Great Firewall and need to tunnel past it to see the web unhindered.  My method of choice is using SSH as a tunnel so that I access localhost:8080 as a proxy and it tunnels through SSH to a remote server under my control at 8080, which happens to be a squid proxy.
2009-05-17T08:15:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	I know the technique itself works because I've been using it for years.  But my service provider has gone west and I have to set this up myself.
2009-05-17T08:16:00.000Z	ttmrichter		It isn't working.  :)
2009-05-17T08:16:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		yes  me too
2009-05-17T08:21:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	ttmrichter	sorry about that.  So does your firewall allow outbound SSH?  ANd if so... are you making a successful connection to the SSH server
2009-05-17T08:27:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Kr0ntab	I'm administering the machine with SSH, so yeah, SSH is not a problem.
