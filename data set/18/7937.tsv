2008-01-04T06:09:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	doesnt do that for me, on any distributions with 2.6.22 and higher
2008-01-04T06:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	Then we need to figure out where the cutoff is...  I have feisty on this box.
2008-01-04T06:11:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	they made changes 2.6.22 and above all required to have uuid for id, but if you format a partition its uuid changes along with the swap partitions if you install a distro on it.
2008-01-04T06:13:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	its a pain in the butt but someone figured that was needed, probably the man himself.
2008-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	http://linuxmint.com/wiki/index.php/UUID_-what_is_it_and_why_is_it_a_problem   has some info
2008-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	UUID ic calculated using the size and location and other info...
2008-01-04T06:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	Where did you see that it is not that way since that version of kernal
2008-01-04T06:16:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	i watched it change, I use sidux and kanotix, sidux dealt with it back in jan 2007
2008-01-04T06:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	I was looking for a wiki or some other solid info...
2008-01-04T06:17:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	i have no problem with it, i just get the new uuid with ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and make change to my fstab as needed.
2008-01-04T06:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	Agreed .. it is easy to fix fstab...   but that page I linked is dated oct 07 and still shows that uuid's change based on size and location of the partition on the drive.
2008-01-04T06:19:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	commenting out the uuid is a bad idea as when the kernel gets changed they rely on uuids
2008-01-04T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	I never suggested commenting out the uuid.. that page does... but I personally like them...
2008-01-04T06:20:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	i think it might pertain more to Ubuntu than other debian distros
2008-01-04T06:22:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	 yes , they are a pain but needed. everyone has an opinion on uuid's and its likely to be around a long time. i work with them as needed.
2008-01-04T06:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	The only point of contention was.. do that all change when you change one...   I understand that uuid's change for all partitions on the drive past from the partition you change to the last partition on that drive
2008-01-04T06:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wirechief_	do they all change..
2008-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	wirechief_	Jack_Sparrow	 well, on sidux and kanotix i can say that only the partition that is formated and the swap but thats when you install a new distro on it. The others remain the same and don't change, and using ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid will show that.
