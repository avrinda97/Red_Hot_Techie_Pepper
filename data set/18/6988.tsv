2009-10-25T15:52:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	where is it, ill test
2009-10-25T15:52:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	yeah - it's stable for me either... and there are no problems at all, except the system test tool :) goto: System->Administration->System Test
2009-10-25T15:53:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	ok will do. it kills the PC i gather :)

2009-10-25T15:54:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	:D
2009-10-25T15:56:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	how about compiz? is it better? I removed it cos was slowing down my PC something rotten
2009-10-25T15:57:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	it depends on your hardware i think :)
2009-10-25T15:57:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	what kind of graphik card do you have?
2009-10-25T15:58:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	Nvidia 6800
2009-10-25T15:59:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	maybe i don't have enough ram?
2009-10-25T16:00:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	or there is a problem with the driver
2009-10-25T16:00:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	i have a X1300 bulti into my HP NC6400 with 128 MB GDDR :) it works very well :-/
2009-10-25T16:01:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	it worked ok before, was in karmic when it went odd
2009-10-25T16:02:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	so, i suppose there is some trouble with the driver used...
2009-10-25T16:03:00.000Z	cybic	aftertaf	maybe it'll get better after the release :)
2009-10-25T16:03:00.000Z	aftertaf	cybic	not tried since a couplaweeks, maybe will test again now :)
