2006-08-05T12:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		my laptop's in ubuntu, and now my hard drive access light is going solid.
2006-08-05T12:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		for no apparent reason.
2006-08-05T12:20:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		this ain't good.
2006-08-05T12:21:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		windows is corrupt enough to begin with
2006-08-05T12:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		there
2006-08-05T12:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		my laptop, in ubuntu, is now completely frozen.
2006-08-05T12:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		unresponsive to attempts to kill X, or switch VT's
2006-08-05T12:24:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		this is crazy.
2006-08-05T12:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		mmhmm
2006-08-05T12:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		"<BHSPitMonkey> unresponsive to attempts to kill X, or switch VT's"
2006-08-05T12:25:00.000Z	ompaul	BHSPitMonkey	rather than doing anything can you leave it for a while - 40 minutes and see if it unfreezes
2006-08-05T12:28:00.000Z	ompaul	BHSPitMonkey	can you ssh into it?
2006-08-05T12:29:00.000Z	ompaul	BHSPitMonkey	before you start the box again press esc and do some of the stuff off this
2006-09-05T16:53:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	ompaul	thanks
2006-11-15T16:28:00.000Z	ompaul	BHSPitMonkey	it is the nick of anyone on the live cd ...
2006-11-15T16:28:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	ompaul	that's a defect. and plus, who cares?
2006-11-15T16:28:00.000Z	ompaul	BHSPitMonkey	well if you think it is a defect then I suggest you report it as a bug
2006-11-15T16:29:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	ompaul	if I was to report any bugs, they would be the serious ones that are damaging my hardware every night... I just can't get any specific data about them...
