2005-12-02T16:28:00.000Z	s00d		Hello. I'm having a problem trying to install Breezy Badger (got my CDs today :-D). I think it's due to the lack of disk space (2gb). It constantly freezes when trying to install the packages after reboot. I tried booting the installer with "linux archive-copier/copy=false". but then it just freezes when installing packages (presumably because it doesn't know where they are). Is there any way I can finish this install?
2005-12-02T16:29:00.000Z	s00d		Is it possible to install without caching the packages onto the hard drive?
2005-12-02T16:30:00.000Z	s00d		indypendent: What about this "linux archive-copier/copy=false" option?
2005-12-02T16:30:00.000Z	bimberi	s00d	perhaps try a server install first, then install desktop components after that
2005-12-02T16:31:00.000Z	s00d	bimberi	what are the packages for the desktop component? Wasn't there just a dummy package like "gnome-desktop" or something?
2005-12-02T16:31:00.000Z	bimberi	s00d	ubuntu-desktop
2005-12-02T16:31:00.000Z	s00d	bimberi	Ah, thanks. So I just apt-get install that?
2005-12-02T16:32:00.000Z	bimberi	s00d	yep :) (not sure if you'll have the same problem but worth a try)
2005-12-02T16:32:00.000Z	bimberi	s00d	apt-cache search <keywords>
2005-12-02T16:32:00.000Z	s00d	bimberi	I think I might be okay if I just install gnome without the office software etc.
2005-12-02T16:33:00.000Z	s00d	bimberi	which package would that be?
2005-12-02T16:33:00.000Z	bimberi	s00d	not sure, let me have a look
2005-12-02T16:39:00.000Z	bimberi	s00d	sry, struggling to find a post on the forums ...  (still looking)
2005-12-02T16:40:00.000Z	s00d	bimberi	Thanks for trying. Any help is appreciated.
2005-12-02T16:40:00.000Z	s00d	bimberi	IUsnt' there jsut an umbrella package in synaptic?
