2008-06-14T00:10:00.000Z	kunwon1		I'm getting a lot of 404 errors from different repos (several different subdomains of ubuntu.com) when I do an aptitude update. When I try to install iftop via aptitude, it says the package is untrusted. I've googled and see that this can be caused by aptitude not being able to authenticate the repo? But I haven't made any changes on my system recently, definitely haven't deleted any keys. What could be causing this? This is the output of aptitude

2008-06-14T00:11:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	Edgy has reached EOL, it's no longer supported/updated, as such, the mirrors have been taken offline.  You should upgrade
2008-06-14T00:12:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	I was afraid of that, ty
2008-06-14T00:12:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	In the mean time, you can use http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
2008-06-14T00:12:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	but, just recognize that its dangerous (for instance, you probably have the SSH vulnerability)
2008-06-14T00:12:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	I'm going to upgrade now
2008-06-14T00:14:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	That's fine, update-manager-core should suffice
2008-06-14T00:14:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	ok, thanks. I didn't know there was a version that could run from CLI
2008-06-14T00:14:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	but still, if you're going to do it manually (which is fine, make sure you have ubuntu-standard, ubuntu-minimal, and your kernel metapackage installed.
2008-06-14T00:15:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	which method is safer?
2008-06-14T00:16:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	either is fine.  update-manager just does all taht stuff for you, basically.  If you know what you're doing (know what to make sure you have, what to make sure you disable, etc) there identical
2008-06-14T00:16:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	alright, thanks.
2008-06-14T00:20:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	It's because you've switched your mirrors, and they have new keys.  You can either add them, or just ignore it. (it'll go away when you switch back to your old mirror)
2008-06-14T00:20:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	I haven't switched my mirrors.
2008-06-14T01:04:00.000Z	Flannel	kunwon1	What's up?
2008-06-14T01:04:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	I think I found the problem, one moment
2008-06-14T01:07:00.000Z	kunwon1	Flannel	yes. Here's what caused my issue - do-release-upgrade firsts reads the sources.list, and does an apt update, on edgy repos. The upgrade will fail if these are 404 - Then, later in the process, it alters sources.list by changing all occurances of edgy to feisty, but this fails because it's not pulling from archive.ubuntu.com or whatever, it's pulling from old-releases. So what I did, is start do-release-upgrade with an 'old-releases' sourc
