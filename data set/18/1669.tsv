2011-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	compdoc	mrmcgibby	what kernel is it running?
2011-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	mrmcgibby	compdoc	3.0
2011-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	compdoc		thats the kernel it should have
2011-10-28T19:54:00.000Z	compdoc	mrmcgibby	there was a upgraded kernel released a few days ago - you have to run the update manager to install it
2011-10-28T19:55:00.000Z	mrmcgibby	compdoc	The problem is that when I reinstalled I used a 64-bit installer on a system that was running 32-bit, so I need the kernel to be reinstalled
2011-10-28T19:55:00.000Z	mrmcgibby		I want the reinstall to wipe the system and start again
2011-10-28T19:55:00.000Z	mrmcgibby	compdoc	but it doesn't seem to be doing that
2011-10-28T19:55:00.000Z	compdoc	mrmcgibby	it will install the kernel you chose
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	compdoc		are you using a cd?
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	mrmcgibby	compdoc	yeah, it should, but it isn't
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	mrmcgibby		yes
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	mrmcgibby		I still have a bunch of old kernels
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	compdoc		do you have more than one hdd?
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	mrmcgibby		no
2011-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	compdoc		oh, it is leaving the old kernels behind
2011-10-28T19:57:00.000Z	mrmcgibby		yeah, I thought it would delete *everything* except for /home and reinstall, but it didn't do that
2011-10-28T19:58:00.000Z	compdoc	mrmcgibby	can you just backup /home somewhere and then erase?
2011-10-28T19:59:00.000Z	mrmcgibby	compdoc	yes, but I'd like to avoid that
