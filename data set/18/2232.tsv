2010-07-16T13:49:00.000Z	srthmb		Can anyone assist in enabling 1650x1080 on my desktop? There is no option in my nvidia x server and I'm afraid I'll have to edit my xorg-conf
2010-07-16T13:51:00.000Z	beanage	srthmb	did you click detect displays?
2010-07-16T13:51:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	Yep.
2010-07-16T13:52:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	I tried putting the resolution under the "advanced" tab in the nvidia x server settings and it worked, now my desktop is expanded beyond the sixe ogf my monitor
2010-07-16T13:53:00.000Z	beanage	srthmb	whats it say under panning:?
2010-07-16T13:53:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	let me take a look, one moment.
2010-07-16T13:54:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	where would I see the panning options at? I'm sorry.
2010-07-16T13:55:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	Oh, that's where I put it 1650x1080. that's what's under panning. I put that in manually.
2010-07-16T13:56:00.000Z	beanage	srthmb	in nvidia x server settings ->  xserver display config ->  Display tab
2010-07-16T13:56:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	I input 1680x1050 manually and that didn't do anything but expand my screen haha
2010-07-16T13:57:00.000Z	beanage	srthmb	 what monitor do you have? brand and model?
2010-07-16T13:59:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	I'm pretty sure it's a LG L226WT-BF 22-inch Widescreen
2010-07-16T14:02:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	any ideas? My monitor and video card support the resolution.
2010-07-16T14:04:00.000Z	beanage	srthmb	yeah sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange
2010-07-16T14:05:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	ddcprobe not found?
2010-07-16T14:07:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	did you make a typo? apparently, that command does not exist.
2010-07-16T14:11:00.000Z	srthmb	beanage	greping monitorrange didnt provide results, do you just want me to pastebin the output?
