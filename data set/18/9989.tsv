2007-03-09T07:42:00.000Z	tehquickness		I am importing a bunch of songs both mp3s and wmas, The files are in one folder names music, then with a seperate folder the main for each artist with the songs in there. Is there a simple scripts that will run through the whole thing recursively and delete all the wmas
2007-03-09T07:43:00.000Z	tehquickness		Let me check I think I tried that
2007-03-09T07:43:00.000Z	tehquickness		but maybe I tried rm -rD *.wma
2007-03-09T07:44:00.000Z	tehquickness		or better yet is there a way to just copy out all the mp3s to another folder
2007-03-09T07:45:00.000Z	tehquickness		maybe cp -r *.mp3 /forlder/to/copy/to
2007-03-09T07:45:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	find can help with both of those
2007-03-09T08:58:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	for i in */*; do echo cp \"$i\" \"`basename $i`\"; done
2007-03-09T08:58:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	maybe change */* to */*.mp3
2007-03-09T08:58:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	that will output the copy commands so you can check it, then save the output and run it, or change that to actually do it
2007-03-09T09:00:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	for i in */*.mp3; do echo cp \"$i\" \"`basename $i`\"; done
2007-03-09T09:00:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	that should be very close, save that output and check it, then run it
2007-03-09T09:00:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	(from the /music dir)
2007-03-09T09:02:00.000Z	tehquickness	kelsin	this giving things like this basename: extra operand `Massacre'
2007-03-09T09:03:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	you'll have to debug it yourself, it's working for me and all of my music (including japenses characters and tons of long names with spaces)
2007-03-09T09:06:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	it should: find -iname "*.mp3" -exec cp {} . \;
2007-03-09T09:06:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	again from the music dir
2007-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	it should: find -iname "*.mp3" -execdir cp {} . \;
2007-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	kelsin	tehquickness	you might need the execdir like someone else mentioned
