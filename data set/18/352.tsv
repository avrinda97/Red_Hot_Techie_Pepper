2012-07-11T01:27:00.000Z	hilarie		I have a silly question... so I have an internet connection, modem, directly connected to my home server, which then connects to my wifi router (netgear n600) is there a way to make it so my server doesn't look at all traffic as though it was coming directly from the router, but from the devices connected to it?
2012-07-11T01:27:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	yes it's called VPN
2012-07-11T01:27:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	another option is setting up an SSH tunnel
2012-07-11T01:27:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	those are your two basic choices for this
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	eph3meral		i'm on a GeForce 8600 GT
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	hilarie		So there is no way for it without setup on each computer?
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	eph3meral		not too far away, it's been just fine for me
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	no
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	each computer will require setup, that is correct
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	hilarie		I would have to go buy a switch for that right?
2012-07-11T01:28:00.000Z	eph3meral		uhh... no?
2012-07-11T01:29:00.000Z	eph3meral		don't think you need a switch, just make sure to open up your wireless router to let the connections come in for the VPN or SSH server
2012-07-11T01:29:00.000Z	hilarie	eph3meral	I was just hoping to be able to do it in a straightforward way, I have both ubuntu and windows computers at home
2012-07-11T01:29:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	that process is called "port forwarding" also sometimes known as "opening a port" - though if you learn about firewall rules the pedantic ones will tell you there's no such thing :P
2012-07-11T01:30:00.000Z	eph3meral		but those are the common names for the process
2012-07-11T01:30:00.000Z	hilarie	eph3meral	I get all of that, but every piece of traffic that the server sees is coming from the router, its doesn't see that, Its a  2nd 'nat'?
2012-07-11T01:31:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	sorry I don't quite follow, and I've gtg keep working, good luck
2012-07-11T01:31:00.000Z	eph3meral	hilarie	if you explain a little more generally (like I'm an alien) what you want, i might be able to suggest some things
