2007-09-23T07:34:00.000Z	whileimhere		Hi. I was wondering if anyone can recommend a site that discusses cleaning up all the excess packages that synaptic holds onto. Is there a way to limit how long those packages sit as deb files on a harddrive?
2007-09-23T07:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whileimhere	I burn var/cache/apt/archives to a cd every month or so, just so I dont need to download them again .. then I clear that folder
2007-09-23T07:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whileimhere	There is a terminal comand to clean it out.. not sure synaptic has a way to do it
2007-09-23T07:40:00.000Z	whileimhere	Jack_Sparrow	Can you please tell me what terminal comman it is so I can write it down?
2007-09-23T07:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whileimhere	terminal or cli... looks kinda like a dos prompt...
2007-09-23T07:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whileimhere	applications, accessories, terminal
2007-09-23T07:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	whileimhere	I cant remember the command, as I dont like to purge then, I hate eating up bandwidth downloading them again for a reinstall on this or another pc
2007-09-23T07:43:00.000Z	whileimhere	Jack_Sparrow	I cna understand that.
