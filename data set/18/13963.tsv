2005-10-06T07:51:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	 ah ok
2005-10-07T05:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	you can try booting off the live-cd and using gparted (i think it's on the live-cd)
2005-10-07T05:01:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	StarKruzr: Is it ok to get gparted through synaptic and use my Ubuntu install or is it preferrable to use it with the liveCD?
2005-10-07T05:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	resizing mounted ("live") partitions is not a good idea
2005-10-07T05:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	hence using the live-cd is a good idea
2005-10-07T05:03:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	 ok I'll burn a live cd
2005-10-07T05:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	first check that it has gparted
2005-10-07T05:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	'safest' is back all personal data up first
2005-10-07T05:06:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	 yep I have that done, I did that before installing Ubuntu itself ;)
2005-10-07T05:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	also, you can maybe remount /home on a new partition, instead of resizing
2005-11-06T11:59:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	 I don't have that either
2006-01-17T12:08:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	when the ops come they are going to want someone to kick :P
2006-01-17T12:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	i'm busy putting donning my chainmail armour
2006-01-19T09:16:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	seveas taught him yesterday :)
2006-01-19T12:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	fwiw, earlier someone had a similar problem, and also had to create the admin group
2006-01-19T12:45:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	he doesn't know if he used expert
2006-02-24T13:56:00.000Z	_jason	HappyFool	sebastian: k3b
2006-02-24T13:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	_jason	that was it, ta. maybe if it had a more logical name ;)
