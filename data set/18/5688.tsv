2008-09-15T01:14:00.000Z	cheeky		to my ps3 via wireless  router?
2008-09-15T01:14:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	Use Mediatomb
2008-09-15T01:15:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	But I suggest you build it from SVN... the package in Hardy isnt all that great. Works... but it's not awesome
2008-09-15T01:15:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	is it like a music player for linux?
2008-09-15T01:16:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	i am pretty new to it wat package do i need to get to be exactt?
2008-09-15T01:16:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	No, it's a DLNA-server, to stream music to DLNA enabled stuff, like the PS3. It's what I use.
2008-09-15T01:16:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	sudo apt-get install mediatomb
2008-09-15T01:17:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	is it gui player /?
2008-09-15T01:17:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	let me see the wiki
2008-09-15T01:17:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	brb
2008-09-15T01:18:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	Then browse to http://localhost:49152/ to do configuration etc. No, it's like a webserver... you will see it on the PS3 and use that GUI, isnt that what you wanted?
2008-09-15T01:19:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	hell yeah man looks sweet i should try it;but then again does this open more listneing ports and can .. cause vaunerability in your linux box .. if i dont even have my iptables configured !
2008-09-15T01:20:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	I wouldnt worry too much... but sure, if you're paranoid, use ufw or something to just let the PS3 access it
2008-09-15T01:21:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	ufw ?
2008-09-15T01:21:00.000Z	cheeky	hateball	sooo much i dont know of
2008-09-15T01:21:00.000Z	hateball	cheeky	master google-fu, and you shall learn ;)
