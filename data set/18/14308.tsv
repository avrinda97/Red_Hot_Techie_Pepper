2005-08-23T07:57:00.000Z	guim		hi all
2005-08-23T07:57:00.000Z	guim		i have a question about imageMagik command tools
2005-08-23T07:58:00.000Z	guim		does anyone know if mogrigy or any of the available comamnd allow to modify a complet set of GIF images colors?
2005-08-23T07:58:00.000Z	guim		I mean replace color X by color Y in 50 images
2005-08-23T07:58:00.000Z	guim		at once
2005-08-23T07:58:00.000Z	guim		?
2005-08-23T07:59:00.000Z	displague	guim	for a in *gif; do mogrify blah $a; done ??
2005-08-23T07:59:00.000Z	displague	guim	oh - you mean the frames of the gif?
2005-08-23T07:59:00.000Z	guim		I have 100 .gif files
2005-08-23T08:00:00.000Z	guim		where I want to change color #124589 by #156785 for example
2005-08-23T08:00:00.000Z	displague	guim	then what i said will work
2005-08-23T08:00:00.000Z	guim		mogrify blah $a; done ??
2005-08-23T08:01:00.000Z	guim	displague	could you give a command example?
2005-08-23T08:01:00.000Z	displague	guim	just make sure the wildcard fits the files.. yes... "for a in pr0n-*.gif; do mogrify -options "$a"; done" ... you may have to give to file names, so "mogrify $a $a.new" might be needed.
2005-08-23T08:01:00.000Z	guim		i didn't get it
2005-08-23T08:02:00.000Z	guim		ok I can't do that in justb one commaden line then
2005-08-23T08:03:00.000Z	displague	guim	i use convert (also imagemagik) all the time, so i would say "for a in *jpg; do convert -scale 640 $a; done"  (but i wouldn't really do that, i'ld try to preserve tags
2005-08-23T08:03:00.000Z	displague	guim	you run that from the shell
