2008-01-05T10:54:00.000Z	Eyemean		hi, how can i temporarily disable xgl so i can have Direct rendering?
2008-01-05T10:55:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	are you running Ubuntu 7.10?
2008-01-05T10:59:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	I believe you just have to restart X (CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE)
2008-01-05T10:59:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	but make sure you have everything closed, becasue running that will immediately kill all programs
2008-01-05T11:00:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	Firefox includes a session restore so if Firefox gets killed (like by CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE), it will ask if you want to restore your session (windows and tabs) when you start it again.
2008-01-05T11:06:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	no problem, enjoy!
2008-01-05T11:07:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	hmmm, try 'touch ~/.config/xserver-xgl/disable' (again without quotes)
2008-01-05T11:09:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	XGL is a display server, FGLRX is a device driver for Radeon video cards
2008-01-05T11:10:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	once you get to that directory, right click in the window and chose Create File -> Empty File and then name it 'disable' (without quotes of course)
2008-01-05T11:14:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	haha it's ok, but in the future you can use a Pastebin (look for the message from ubotu).  Feel free to create the folder xserver-xgl inside .config if you wish.
2008-01-05T11:21:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	what kind of video card do you have?
2008-01-05T11:21:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	and you have fglrx installed?
2008-01-05T11:22:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	if you type in 'glxinfo | grep direct' what shows up/
2008-01-05T11:23:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	so then you have 3D acceleration enabled now
2008-01-05T11:24:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	hmmm. I'm not sure then what the problem is....you can check out the channel #cedega and they might be able to help)
2008-01-05T11:33:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	yeah, fglrx doesn't support direct rendering when XGL is used
2008-01-05T11:34:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	hahah I know what you mean.  I'm stuch with a Radeon as well
2008-01-05T11:36:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Eyemean	the laptop I have came that way ;)
