2012-11-29T02:56:00.000Z	zoidberg1		i`ve got a powerpc ubuntu 10.4 lts and i want to upgrade, buts that not posssible because of broken packages
2012-11-29T02:57:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zoidberg1	 fastest, cleanest and most efficient way is fresh install after backup
2012-11-29T02:57:00.000Z	zoidberg1	MonkeyDust	-1 this is windows style
2012-11-29T02:58:00.000Z	zoidberg1	MonkeyDust	no i don`t want to reinstall because of problems with my disk drive and no ability to boot from usb
2012-11-29T02:59:00.000Z	zoidberg1	MonkeyDust	its powerpc and openboot its not easy to boot from usb
2012-11-29T03:01:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zoidberg1	 in the future, best make a separate /home partition, i guess you're skilled enough to know how to do that
2012-11-29T03:03:00.000Z	zoidberg1	MonkeyDust	the problem is that i cant boot from as much as anything but my harddisk
2012-11-29T03:03:00.000Z	zoidberg1	MonkeyDust	because of drive failure and openboot problems...
2012-11-29T03:06:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zoidberg1	 you have our advice, but also read this http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/04/ubuntu-10-04-12-04-upgrade-how-well-does-it-go
