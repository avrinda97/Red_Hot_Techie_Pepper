2006-04-01T12:38:00.000Z	hippie23	wd3	no... I dont
2006-04-01T12:38:00.000Z	hippie23		doesnt seem to affect anything
2006-04-01T12:38:00.000Z	wd3	hippie23	well i installed conky and gdesklets, and everytime i log in session they aren't running, whats the save session for?
2006-04-01T12:39:00.000Z	hippie23		to save your prevoius session
2006-04-01T12:40:00.000Z	hippie23		like I have xmms, streamtuner and gaim running, I log out and check the save session button, and they will be there when I boot up again
2006-04-01T12:41:00.000Z	hippie23		I unchecked the save session button to leave it so it brings up just xmms, streamtuner and gaim, but leaving it checked will start you from where you left off the previos time
2006-04-01T12:42:00.000Z	wd3	hippie23	when u log in do u choose start xfce or last?
2006-04-01T12:43:00.000Z	hippie23		I just log in and and it automaticaly starts xfce... unless I tell it to start KDE or fluxbox
2006-04-01T12:43:00.000Z	hippie23		I like xfce so I lust use it all the time
2006-04-01T12:43:00.000Z	hippie23		just*
2006-04-01T12:45:00.000Z	wd3	hippie23	i want to use xfce all the time so how do i prevent the other options or how do i autochoose xfce to boot up?
2006-04-01T12:46:00.000Z	hippie23		when you lon in, it will pop up a box that tells you that xfce is not your defult session... click on the "make defult" button... then it should go to xfce every time
2006-04-01T12:48:00.000Z	wd3	hippie23	i don't see that box. i have a box at the top it says "last" then something else and the bottom it says "xfce" so i choose xfce.
2006-04-01T12:49:00.000Z	hippie23		ok
2006-04-01T12:49:00.000Z	hippie23		I cant explain it any further
2006-04-01T12:50:00.000Z	hippie23		I suck with written language
2006-04-01T12:52:00.000Z	wd3	hippie23	what's the diff between last session and xfce?
