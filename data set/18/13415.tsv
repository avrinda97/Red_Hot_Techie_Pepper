2006-04-19T07:11:00.000Z	yipe		I'd really appreciate if someone would look at that pastbin.... limewire is just SUCH a resource hog
2006-04-19T07:12:00.000Z	yipe		huh?
2006-04-19T07:12:00.000Z	yipe		I just did sudo dpkg -i
2006-04-19T07:13:00.000Z	yipe		yes, this was after installation
2006-04-19T07:13:00.000Z	yipe		yes it is
2006-04-19T07:14:00.000Z	yipe		okay.... what did that just do?
2006-04-19T07:15:00.000Z	yipe		I don't see any files with a .exe after them
2006-04-19T07:17:00.000Z	yipe		well.... what's the equivalent?
2006-04-19T07:17:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	file names have no magical significance in real operating systems such as linux or unix
2006-04-19T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	no, nothing
2006-04-19T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	and it should not.
2006-04-19T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	the reason for having extensions in windows is the the early primitive versions had a file system with no concept of file attributes
2006-04-19T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	so the only way to make a file into a type was to use it's name
2006-04-19T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	but that was eliminated in other operating systems around 1965
2006-04-19T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	it's not
2006-04-19T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	it isn't difficult at all, it just isn't done by name
2006-04-19T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	web browser type programs don't use file names anyway, they use an attribute in html
2006-04-19T07:20:00.000Z	sethk	yipe	even in windows these days the name is not significant for most programs
