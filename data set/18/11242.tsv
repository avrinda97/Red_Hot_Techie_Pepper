2006-08-27T15:05:00.000Z	opexoc		is there someone who can tell is it possible to run ubuntu with
2006-08-27T15:05:00.000Z	opexoc		kernel 1.0 version
2006-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	no.  Why would you want to do that anyway?
2006-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	why no ?
2006-08-27T15:07:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	because it's meant for specific kernel versions, 2.6.15 in dapper, 2.4.something in breezy, etc.  Why are you interested in getting it to work on 1.0?
2006-08-27T15:07:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	it is a kind of experiment.
2006-08-27T15:08:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	so if I wanted to install 2.6.17 kernel, would not I do that ?
2006-08-27T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	nope.  Well, you could compile it yourself.  If we're being purely experimental, I suppose it may be possible.  I'm not familiar with such older kernels.  I imagine theres a bit of an interface difference, you'd almost certainly need to compile everything
2006-08-27T15:13:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	Generally, I am newbie in subject linux. I am only wondering is it possible. I don't really reinstall my kernel or something ever.
2006-08-27T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	No, I can't imagine it would be possible.  Without major rewrites of some stuff
2006-08-27T15:16:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	I want to execute something like that http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217657&highlight=kernel now... and I am wondering is it add some entry in my grub config stuff ( can I use my old kernel automatically) ?
2006-08-27T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	Yes, it should still allow you to boot your old kernel.  I didn't really look closely though.
2006-08-27T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	but, yeah, it won't touch your old ones
2006-08-27T15:18:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	ok so it looks quite secure. So, I will try it surely.
2006-09-03T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	he didn't.
2006-09-03T15:10:00.000Z	opexoc	Flannel	so how he knew like linux kernel should have seen?
2006-09-03T15:11:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	because he had an idea as to how it should behave, and from that, you can decide how you want it to work.  This is really a better topic for #ubuntu-offtopic though, we can continue there if you still have questions
2006-09-03T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	opexoc	one doesn't need to see the source / know how something works to be able to mimic it.  Its pretty easy once youre familiar with how it interacts with everything.
