2011-10-28T16:30:00.000Z	wh1zz0		Hi guys.. Pls how can I kill a previous remote desktop session on linux. I keep getting this error ---> the terminal server has exceeded the maximum number of connections... Each time I try to login. I use rdesktop for ubuntu but all the tutorials I found online after asking google are all windows tutorials (cmd) ... How can I get this solved please.. Thanks in anticipation of any swift response.
2011-10-28T16:32:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	use rdesktop -0  hostname
2011-10-28T16:33:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	That will connect to the console of the Winblows box. You can then use task manager to kill off the other sessions that are leftover.
2011-10-28T16:35:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	rdesktop -0 <hostname>
2011-10-28T16:35:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	where -0 is zero
2011-10-28T16:36:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Sinjet	YES!!
2011-10-28T16:36:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Sinjet	that's the command I was looking for
2011-10-28T16:36:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	Good deal!
2011-10-28T16:37:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Sinjet	 I usually connect lie this.. rdesktop -g 85% -u user <computer> ... where g is for geometry and u is for user
2011-10-28T16:38:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	rdeskop -g 85% -0 -u user <computer>
2011-10-28T16:38:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Sinjet	However, to kill, is it -O or -0 .. i.e rdesktop -0 <Computer> or rdesktop -O <computer>.. ?
2011-10-28T16:38:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	That is the command to connect to the "console" of the Winblows box.
2011-10-28T16:39:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	Once there, you can use task manager and view the "users" tab.
2011-10-28T16:39:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	And kill of any leftover sessions.
2011-10-28T16:39:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	It is zero, correct.
2011-10-28T16:40:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Sinjet	Yeah from there I can find my way.. Thanks... whew, no wonder it didnt work, I used alpabet O
2011-10-28T16:40:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Sinjet	 Thans again
2011-10-28T16:40:00.000Z	Sinjet	wh1zz0	 Awesome. Good luck!
