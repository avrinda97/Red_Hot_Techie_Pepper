2007-11-07T07:49:00.000Z	dudewithtwoheads		could someone help me, this is starting to anoy me a lot, i tryed everything but i simply can't insall kubuntu on my laptop.. any ideas ?
2007-11-07T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	what happens when you try to install it?
2007-11-07T07:50:00.000Z	dudewithtwoheads	sethk	well i get an error... and root witouth gui
2007-11-07T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	you might try doing a normal ubuntu install (rather than kubuntu), and then install the kde desktop.  The end result is the same as a kubuntu install
2007-11-07T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	if you have problems even doing that, then use the text mode install on the alternate cd, then install the desktop as a second phase.
2007-11-07T07:52:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	download the ubuntu cd, and/or the alternate cd
2007-11-07T07:53:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	probably it's the alternate cd that will solve your problem.
2007-11-07T07:54:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	I would recommend downloading the alternate cd.  The text mode install, followed by the desktop install as phase 2, is the best way to deal with your situation.
2007-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	is there a loaded module name "usb-storage"?
2007-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	dudewithtwoheads	sethk	i think i saw that modul loaded
2007-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	check.  If it is loaded, then my theory is wrong.
2007-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	use dmesg instead of tail /var/log/messages.  See if you see messages from usb-storage, and a reference to a SCSI drive.
2007-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	do you possibly have a non-standard kernel configuration?
2007-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	sorry  also  :)
2007-11-07T08:01:00.000Z	dudewithtwoheads	sethk	no, everything is standard, i found some forums with people having same problem like mine on this laptop.. they cant fix it i think :S
2007-11-07T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	using the text mode install is usually the key to this type of situation.  The full install works with a much larger range of video hardware.  So when the GUI install fails, the text mode install succeeds, and then the more powerful installation/configuration programs for the KDE (or gnome, or whatever) desktop can be used.
2007-11-07T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	you boot the alternate cd, and text mode install is one of the boot menu options.  extremely easy, once you download it.
2007-11-07T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	dudewithtwoheads	you'll find instructions at the download site on ubuntu.com
