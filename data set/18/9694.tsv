2008-09-03T21:56:00.000Z	russe11		My wireless (broadcom 4306, driver installed via restricted drivers manager) quit working after the most recent kernel update, any ideas?
2008-09-03T21:57:00.000Z	argento	russe11	easy go what to previous kernel... dont use propposed updates
2008-09-03T21:59:00.000Z	russe11	argento	I just installed it when it came up in the update manager, I didn't use any beta anything.
2008-09-03T22:00:00.000Z	argento	russe11	whats the kernel version?
2008-09-03T22:00:00.000Z	russe11		something -18 I believe.
2008-09-03T22:00:00.000Z	russe11	argento	2.6.24-18-generic
2008-09-03T22:00:00.000Z	argento	russe11	update to -19 and install linux-backports
2008-09-03T22:02:00.000Z	russe11	argento	Do I need to do something special to update my kernel to -19? It's not showing up as an update.
2008-09-03T22:03:00.000Z	argento	russe11	check repositories
2008-09-03T22:03:00.000Z	russe11	argento	I did apt-get update and apt-get upgrade
2008-09-03T22:03:00.000Z	argento	russe11	check in synaptic repositories
2008-09-03T22:05:00.000Z	argento	russe11	System --> Administration --> Software Sources check if you have selected correct repos
2008-09-03T22:05:00.000Z	russe11	argento	What would be the correct repos?
2008-09-03T22:06:00.000Z	argento	russe11	all but ubuntu-proposed
2008-09-03T22:06:00.000Z	argento	russe11	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Hardy
2008-09-03T22:06:00.000Z	russe11	argento	IdleOne, Yeah, I've got all of them, but if argento thinks kernel -19 will fix it I can wait.
2008-09-03T22:07:00.000Z	argento	russe11	there is a -19 kernel
2008-09-03T22:07:00.000Z	russe11	argento	I guess it's just not showing up for me right now, but I'm sure it will soon.
