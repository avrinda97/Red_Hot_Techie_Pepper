2009-01-28T17:43:00.000Z	Gianpon		Hi everyone! I need an advice. I have to share a linux app. data file with the community but I dont't like the megaupload like sites because of the little respect for the intellectual property of this kind of sites. Ufortunately I don't have my own host to share it, do you have any suggetion for this problem?
2009-01-28T17:44:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	If you want to distribute something for Ubuntu in a DPKG format, you could get a PPA repository. Alternatively, I can host your files on my website (without any promise of having them up forever and ever, but definitely for at least 6 months) if they're not too big
2009-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	thank you for your proposal. But I must refuse because I need something more flexible, I must update the file frequently and unfortunately it is not dpkg
2009-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	I'll give you a quota'ed FTP account with a home directory as a subdir of /var/www, that way you can host as much as you want up to a certain size limit
2009-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	How much space would you need?
2009-01-28T17:48:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	not more than 5 megs
2009-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	Oh, that's nothing then :)
2009-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	As long as you are _reasonably_ certain that you aren't violating any international laws or anything, and you don't want access control (i.e. anyone can go download it), I can host your file over HTTP, while allowing you to modify/upload it again over FTP
2009-01-28T17:51:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	I'm abslolutely sure about the first point, but on the second I have some doubt... I need something to share this file with other people (if interested), what's the point in hiding it into the web?
2009-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	You mean you _don't_ want to hide it? Well that's what I'd be giving you anyway. Non-authenticated, regular old HTTP access.
2009-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	If you _did_ want access control, that would be more complex to setup
2009-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	no no, nothing like that, at now I just need 300KB and the possibility to let someone download the file, the 5 MB were only for possible short term improvement, I'm going to find another solution in any case.
2009-01-28T17:59:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	You're right I misunderstood the access control...
2009-01-28T18:03:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	Sorry I was AFK
2009-01-28T18:05:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	no problem, but I was really thinking about it, ï»¿is it possible that the only free sharing are for free software and not for free contents? this sounds weird to me, it is not?
2009-01-28T18:05:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	Sourceforge, PPA, etc. tend to be for sharing software, yes... I'm not sure about "data", or "content", it depends on what type. Most services want to charge you a fee for that.
2009-01-28T18:08:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gianpon	Let me set up your FTP account
2009-01-28T18:09:00.000Z	Gianpon	allquixotic	thanks!
