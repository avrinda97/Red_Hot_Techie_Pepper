2010-11-07T19:50:00.000Z	anygivenname		anyone into public key auth?
2010-11-07T19:50:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	Please ask your real question
2010-11-07T19:51:00.000Z	anygivenname		it used to ask for log-in & password....now after using public key auth....it is asking for log-in & passsphrase !!
2010-11-07T19:51:00.000Z	anygivenname		isnt it not supposed to ask for anything ?
2010-11-07T19:52:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	If your key was generated with a passphrase then it will ask for that, yes
2010-11-07T19:52:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	If you do not want it to ask for a passphrase then when generating your key [Enter] past the passphrase request
2010-11-07T19:53:00.000Z	anygivenname	io	but it will still ask for log-in....while it should not
2010-11-07T19:53:00.000Z	anygivenname		as per the different site & people I asked here
2010-11-07T19:54:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	I just tested that on a default client and server SSH installation, the key was generated without a passphrase and was not requested by the server
2010-11-07T19:55:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	You skipped the passphrase request when generating your key?
2010-11-07T19:55:00.000Z	anygivenname		no...i entered a passphrase
2010-11-07T19:55:00.000Z	anygivenname		did it ask for log-in aswell on ur testing ?
2010-11-07T19:56:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	Then it is going to request it, isn't it? Generate a new key without a passphrase which will achieve the setup you want - no passphrases
2010-11-07T19:56:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	No
2010-11-07T19:57:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	Do not specify a passphrase when generating your key and then "ssh <user>@<server>" and it will not request a user nor passphrase
2010-11-07T19:57:00.000Z	anygivenname		ok....got it.....but I understood the passphrase give more power
2010-11-07T19:57:00.000Z	anygivenname		I mean more security
2010-11-07T19:58:00.000Z	io	anygivenname	What do you mean by more power? It adds an extra sense of security to the authentication, but using a cleartext password is what SSH keys aim to avoid - I don't personally see the point, but that choice is upto you
