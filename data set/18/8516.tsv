2007-08-15T15:15:00.000Z	tracer903		I have ubuntu 7.04 and it is not detecting my cd-r drive or digital camera
2007-08-15T15:16:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	I'm not sure I know enough to diagnose your digicam, but I can probably help you with your CD-R.
2007-08-15T15:17:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Is your CD-R drive IDE or SATA or USB?
2007-08-15T15:17:00.000Z	tracer903	MrObvious	ok, thanks, my cd-rom is a memorex 52x
2007-08-15T15:18:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Okay. Do you know which channel it's in?
2007-08-15T15:18:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Choose Primary Master, Primary Slave, Secondary Master, or Secondary Slave.
2007-08-15T15:19:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Okay is it on the end of the IDE cable or in the middle?
2007-08-15T15:22:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	What happens when you type sudo mount /dev/hdc /media/hdc
2007-08-15T15:23:00.000Z	tracer903	MrObvious	mount: mount point /media/hdc does not exist
2007-08-15T15:24:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Oops, try sudo mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom
2007-08-15T15:25:00.000Z	tracer903	MrObvious	mount: No medium found
2007-08-15T15:25:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Put a cd in there.
2007-08-15T15:25:00.000Z	tracer903	MrObvious	Ok, i just put one in.
2007-08-15T15:26:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Now repeat that command.
2007-08-15T15:26:00.000Z	tracer903	MrObvious	mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
2007-08-15T15:26:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Sounds like it's working then.
2007-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	Hmm. IDK much about the automounting feature.
2007-08-15T15:28:00.000Z	MrObvious	tracer903	YW. Maybe someone might have an idea.
