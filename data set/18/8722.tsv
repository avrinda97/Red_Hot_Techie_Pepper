2007-09-28T09:49:00.000Z	skarface		xchat is the better graphical client... I also like irssi, but it's text-based
2007-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	skarface		I don't know what an xdccklipper is, but there are lots of scripts for it on its website
2007-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	skarface		probably
2007-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	skarface		I have kubuntu gutsy
2007-09-28T09:52:00.000Z	skarface		no
2007-09-28T09:52:00.000Z	skarface		but you can right click the file and choose open with or something of that nature
2007-09-28T09:52:00.000Z	skarface		i assume, in gnome
2007-09-28T09:53:00.000Z	skarface		and then change the default
2007-09-28T09:53:00.000Z	skarface		I hate konqeuror, though. dolphin is looking a little better.
2007-09-28T09:55:00.000Z	skarface		yeah that sounds like fluxbox, Nyle ...
2007-09-28T09:55:00.000Z	Nyle	skarface	i know, any 'box' wm, but I like kde because its nicer
2007-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	skarface	Nyle	probably because the gutsy beta just went out
2007-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	Nyle	skarface	im quite positive the gtk2 toolkit does not allow on the fly color scheme changing, like the kde kcrontrol > appearance > colors applet
2007-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	skarface	Nyle	I didn't say it does. I think you want someone else.
2007-09-28T10:10:00.000Z	Nyle	skarface	i know, I'm just saying, can you confirm this for me?
2007-09-28T10:10:00.000Z	Nyle	skarface	you don't use gnome?
2007-09-28T10:18:00.000Z	skarface	Nyle	got it.
2007-09-28T10:19:00.000Z	Nyle	skarface	glad someone does :)
