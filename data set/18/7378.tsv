2012-04-08T23:42:00.000Z	dpy		hi guys
2012-04-08T23:44:00.000Z	dpy		does anyone know any free personal online storage like ubuntu one, but that doesn't require a client-side daemon, but simply a user action with e.g. ssh/scp/webdav or something?
2012-04-08T23:45:00.000Z	dpy		I want something that simply has a webdav/ssh/scp interface
2012-04-08T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dpy	you don't HAVE to install the app at all
2012-04-08T23:46:00.000Z	dpy	ActionParsnip	how do I upload/download then?  Webdav?
2012-04-08T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dpy	you can use the web interface to your account at the very least....
2012-04-08T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dpy	http://dropdav.com/
2012-04-08T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dpy	found that using websearching.....tried it?
2012-04-08T23:49:00.000Z	dpy	ActionParsnip	requirements: 1) Free (no $$), 2) Accessable through http/webdav/ssh/scp
2012-04-08T23:49:00.000Z	dpy	ActionParsnip	dropdav violates requirement 1

2012-04-08T23:53:00.000Z	dpy	ActionParsnip	I appreciate you performing the search for me, but I was asking for a recommendation. A recommendation is hard to give if you haven't used any of these.
2012-04-08T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dpy	No worries. I'd just try a few
2012-04-08T23:55:00.000Z	dpy	ActionParsnip	sugarsync appears to have the "autosyncing with our proprietary software feature"... I don't want to install any software specific to any storage service.
2012-04-08T23:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dpy	why don't you ask them..
