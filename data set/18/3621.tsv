2009-09-15T20:55:00.000Z	Beefcaked		hi guys maybe you can help me.... ubuntu is using more power in this laptop than vista had
2009-09-15T20:56:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	install and run powertop
2009-09-15T20:56:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	thank you. does ubuntu have something like hardware profiling in windows where in i can set to a hardware profile where some of my devices are disabled?
2009-09-15T20:58:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	I'm not sure. btw, the changes powertop makes don't last, so you have to keep it running
2009-09-15T21:01:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	ive installed powertop through synaptic... how do i use this?
2009-09-15T21:01:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	run sudo powertop in a !terminal
2009-09-15T21:02:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	no, just terminal ;) But if you type !terminal here the ubottu bot will tell you where to find it.
2009-09-15T21:04:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	i have it running and i enabled the USB auto suspend. its reporting that an i915@pci is topping the interrupt list. of course.. keyboard and mouse
2009-09-15T21:05:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	that your graphic card i think, 3D effects
2009-09-15T21:06:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	you can google it to see how to disble it, lots of people have that
2009-09-15T21:06:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	mmm. i have aero on vista on all the time but it still lasts so much longer. 1:30hours on vista but only 30 minutes on ubuntu.
2009-09-15T21:07:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	i'm not sure, it might be a buggy driver. How many cpu states can you see in powertop?
2009-09-15T21:07:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	sorry, i dont know what a cpu state is?
2009-09-15T21:08:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	thats how fast your cpu is working, C1 is full speed, C4 is low speed. Low speed uses little power.
2009-09-15T21:09:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	im using a celeron. I have c0 (cpu running), another c0 and c1, c2, c3 on (mwait running0
2009-09-15T21:10:00.000Z	Trijntje	Beefcaked	if you dont see C4 somewhere in the powertop screen you should be able to enable these options in you bios. I have to go now, googling ubuntu powertop should give you a lot of information
2009-09-15T21:11:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	btw.. im currently doing everything powertop asks me to do. the thing you said earlier.. do you mean i have to do this stuff again so i save power the next time?
2009-09-15T21:11:00.000Z	Beefcaked	Trijntje	oh okay, thank you very much, i appreciate the help!:)
