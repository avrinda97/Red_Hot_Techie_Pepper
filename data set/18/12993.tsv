2006-01-28T16:59:00.000Z	Zorlon	lightbright	Actually in almost all irc channels it is considered correct behaviour to wait 10 or 20 minutes between asking questions...
2006-01-28T17:00:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	according to what OP?
2006-01-29T17:01:00.000Z	Zorlon	lightbright	Read the Fine Manual on IRC usage and you will have your answer..it is not a situation where it goes from channel to channel it is more a societal situation regarding IRC usage
2006-01-29T17:01:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	who wrote this "Fine Manual on IRC"? and are you claiming that every channel founder uses this as a golden rule?>
2006-01-29T17:02:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	how come I have seen you ask questions before the 10-20mins period?
2006-01-29T17:05:00.000Z	Zorlon	lightbright	The Book of IRC Alex Charalab would be a real good start...secondly no I did not state that every channel follows this rule rather that it is considered proper etiquette to do so...a 10 second google search would do a lot for you too..but all you want to do is be the one who is right
2006-01-29T17:06:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	how come I have seen you ask questions before the 10-20mins period?
2006-01-29T17:06:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	dont you apply that which you preach?
2006-01-29T17:08:00.000Z	Zorlon	lightbright	Give me specifics..the only thing I asked about today was a journaling program for Ubuntu...it doesn't mean you can't ask more than one question for 10 or 20 minutes..just the same question repeatedly...the conversation is pointless
2006-01-29T17:08:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	thats just your personal opinion, and not agreed upon by every single person that comes here
2006-01-29T17:10:00.000Z	Zorlon	lightbright	I never inferred otherwise....
2006-01-29T17:10:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	good :)
2006-01-29T17:10:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	we have an understanding then :)
2006-01-29T17:11:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	you preach a more accurate sermon with your life than you do with your lips :) people believe more what you DO, than what you SAY! never forget that
2006-01-29T17:13:00.000Z	Zorlon	lightbright	You don't even know me or what I have or have not done..that is a really stupid thing to say..so pidof15
2006-01-29T17:13:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	once again, thats just your personal opinion, and not agreed upon by every single person that comes here
2006-01-29T17:14:00.000Z	lightbright	Zorlon	your mother didnt call me little boy
