2006-11-13T14:20:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Hello all - I have an Mplayer codec question. How do I configure Mplayer so that it will usually succeed in playing video files, whether they are mpeg, mov, avi, etc.? I assume it needs the Windows codecs; where are they found?
2006-11-13T14:20:00.000Z	Sierra	Nutubuntu	you need to see the restricted codecs section of the wiki

2006-11-13T14:21:00.000Z	Sierra		;p
2006-11-13T14:21:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		T/y, nolimitsoya
2006-11-13T14:25:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Sierra and nolimitsoya - looks like the pages you pointed me to will help. Do you know whether Mplayer uses the same backend as Totem (e.g., gstreamer and/or xine)? I'm more or less leaning toward Mplayer rather than Totem
2006-11-13T14:26:00.000Z	Sierra	Nutubuntu	i reccomend VLC
2006-11-13T14:27:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Sierra	I tried VLC and rejected it, but I don't remember why. (I *think* b/c it wouldn't play some vid format I needed.) Mplayer does *most* of what I want, but I am having trouble with some video formats, and I am guessing it's probably a codec issue.
2006-11-13T14:27:00.000Z	Sierra	Nutubuntu	what are you trying to play?
2006-11-13T14:28:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Sierra	nothing too tricky. It gives me weird output (kaleidoscope colors, no sound) on some .wmv files and some .mov files
