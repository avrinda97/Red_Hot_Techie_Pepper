2012-01-25T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gunfire	the web, or man pages
2012-01-25T23:39:00.000Z	gunfire	ActionParsnip	ok let me google it
2012-01-25T23:45:00.000Z	gunfire	ActionParsnip	how can i install weechat_0.3.6-2build1.debian.tar.gz
2012-01-25T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gunfire	depends what is in the archive, simply naming the archive is worthless
2012-01-25T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gunfire	the app is in the repos, albeit a slightly earlier version
2012-01-25T23:50:00.000Z	gunfire	ActionParsnip	 i want the latest version bcoz i have it's config file which i used to use in arch linux.
