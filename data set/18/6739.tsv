2008-04-03T03:46:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	can you post the packages to pastebin? or, better yet, in a terminal, run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` and paste the output of that?
2008-04-03T03:48:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	 Will try that ... will have to be in a few more minutes ... thanks !
2008-04-03T04:29:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61963/   Results of (1) sudo apt-get update
2008-04-03T04:32:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	that looks fine- what's the eric.lavar repository for?
2008-04-03T04:33:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	I pasted   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61963/
2008-04-03T04:36:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	your pastebin output looks fine- what's the eric.lavar repository for?
2008-04-03T04:54:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	that    http://eric.lavar.de   seems to be for some "Third Party Software"  result of  sudo apt-get upgrade ---> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61965/   and I see some errors, but no idea how to fix them.
2008-04-03T04:57:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	what does line 2 of /var/lib/dpkg/available say ?
2008-04-03T05:01:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	better yet, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=722101
2008-04-03T05:04:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	line 2 of /var/lib/dpkg/available says       Status: install ok installed
2008-04-03T05:04:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	did you see that forums link? the solution there was to copy available-old to available (both in /var/lib/dpkg)
2008-04-03T05:08:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	 I missed that link ... and see that "available" lines 1 & 2 say: Package: python-bittorrent

2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	`sudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/available{,.backup} && sudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/available{-old,}` <-- fancy way
2008-04-03T05:29:00.000Z	troxor	Don_Miguel	or sudo -s , then cd /var/lib/dpkg/, then mv them around :)
2008-04-03T05:51:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	troxor	That worked !!  14 updates .. and all seems good ... Thank YOU !!!
