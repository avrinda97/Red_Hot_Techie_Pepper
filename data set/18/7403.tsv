2010-01-22T12:55:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	so that people looking over your shoulder cant tell how long the password is
2010-01-22T12:56:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	if your willing to listen and do some research, were always happy to help
2010-01-22T12:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	could you please run 'lsusb' and paste the output on paste.ubuntu.com
2010-01-22T13:00:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	no, paste to the site   paste.ubuntu.com
2010-01-22T13:01:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	cool, when you submit it, it will change the URL, we need that new URL to see the paste
2010-01-22T13:01:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	now, paste the new link in the channel
2010-01-22T13:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	It just helps us by showing us info from your system, and doesnt flood the channel in the process. Now, there seems to be a bug with your tuner card, so make sure its in the system before ubuntu boots, then you need to look into something like MythTV
2010-01-22T13:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	movied_	yep, rules, regulations - basically its common sense and family friendly
