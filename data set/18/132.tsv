2012-08-17T14:13:00.000Z	casualuser		greetings!
2012-08-17T14:14:00.000Z	casualuser		can someone suggest me if I can do smth with my x32 with pae kernel to force system see 4Gb
2012-08-17T14:15:00.000Z	casualuser		at the time only 2.7 + shared video
2012-08-17T14:17:00.000Z	casualuser		total 2+2 Gb
2012-08-17T14:17:00.000Z	casualuser		video share 256Mb
2012-08-17T14:17:00.000Z	casualuser		in htop I can see 2.7G (3G - 256Mb shared video mem)
2012-08-17T14:18:00.000Z	casualuser		3.2.0-27-generic-pae
2012-08-17T14:18:00.000Z	casualuser		using 3.2.0-29-generic-pae system halts on load
2012-08-17T14:20:00.000Z	casualuser		I've just upgraded my q45 laptop from 1+1 to 2+2 G but it seems system just can't see full 4G amount of mem
2012-08-17T14:21:00.000Z	casualuser		any suggestions except reinstall and switch to x64 ?
2012-08-17T14:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	casualuser	 thats very possible it has some hardware limits
2012-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	casualuser	 i would test with a Non-Pae kernel, and with a 64bit live cd.  to see how much ram they report.
2012-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	casualuser	Dr_Willis	testing with non-pae is an idea but vista at the same laptop see 4G
2012-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	casualuser	 vista may be lieing.. or counting memory differntly then how linux does..
2012-08-17T14:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	casualuser	 you just said the video is taking 256mb of ram.. so vista is definatly showing numbers of  whats installed..not whats 'useable'
2012-08-17T14:32:00.000Z	casualuser	Dr_Willis	bios also reporting 4G
2012-08-17T14:33:00.000Z	casualuser	Dr_Willis	actually I haven't check memory usage in vista to much but just have taken a quick look in system info as vista installed just for rare cases
2012-08-17T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	casualuser	 you dont upgrade 32 to 64bit.. you reinstall.
