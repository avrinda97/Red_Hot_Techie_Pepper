2007-12-16T13:25:00.000Z	lockd		I've searched for 2 ubuntu reccommended packages, "xgame" and "etswitch", etswitch doesn't work and xgame is hard as heck to locate
2007-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	lockd		i.e. inexistant
2007-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	lardarse	lockd	waht are you trying to install?
2007-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	i'm trying to do something to FORCE a game to stop trapping the, for instance, ALT-TAB.
2007-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	and rather let Windowmaker get it so I can alt-tab and switch/minimize
2007-12-16T13:27:00.000Z	lardarse	lockd	hmm...
2007-12-16T13:27:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	it's rare

2007-12-16T13:27:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	because it is hellish and near impossible to do, but i'm gonna do it by darn
2007-12-16T13:27:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	a little -help- of course would be nice

2007-12-16T13:30:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	any idea of how to do said task?
2007-12-16T13:30:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	and no, there won't be a package for that
2007-12-16T13:30:00.000Z	lardarse	lockd	none at all
2007-12-16T13:30:00.000Z	lardarse	lockd	i dual boot for a reason :-)
2007-12-16T13:30:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	and arcane perl scripts, and kernel hackery
2007-12-16T13:31:00.000Z	lockd	lardarse	and yes, i will rewrite a kernel if the bug is in that deep
