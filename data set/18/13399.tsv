2006-08-13T15:33:00.000Z	raddy		Flannel : sorry gdeskles
2006-08-13T15:33:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	Believe so.   Haven't done so myself though
2007-10-04T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	synaptic package manager lets you see all the packages, not just the select ones in add/remove
2007-10-04T11:55:00.000Z	raddy	Flannel	for eg i added pidgin 3rd party backport, the website says they updated pidgin to 2.1.1 but i am running 2.1.0, and ubuntu says you are up to date when i check for updates.
2007-10-04T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	Did you add a repository for pidgin? or just downloaded the deb file?
2007-10-04T11:59:00.000Z	raddy	Flannel	ofcource i added the repo.
2007-10-04T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	Then the repos must not be updated.  You can check manually if you'd like, browse to the repos with a web browser and take a gander at the Packages.gz file for version number

2007-11-03T20:28:00.000Z	raddy	Flannel	nope, each boot shows checking file systems, and all my windows file systems are checked
2007-11-03T20:29:00.000Z	raddy	Flannel	because of the bootsplash is not fully working

2007-11-03T20:33:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	The bootsplash shouldn't have any effect on fsck.  Although they could both be caused by some other issue
2008-05-11T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	You need to reinstall, unfortunately
2008-10-03T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	raddy	#ubuntu+1 for Intrepid questions, but yes.
