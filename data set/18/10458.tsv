2007-10-19T18:58:00.000Z	fuzzy		hi people.. i have a weird problem.. after struggling with x while getting the resolution to work, suddenly the mouse cursor dissapeard.. what could i have done wrong?
2007-10-19T18:59:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	when the cursor disappears, are the Capslock and ScrollLock lights on your keyboard blinking on and off?
2007-10-19T19:00:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	no.. now i realize the caps lock even doesn't work.. damn
2007-10-19T19:01:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	Did you hand-edit the xorg.conf file when you were fiddling with resolutions?
2007-10-19T19:01:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	no.. i did it with dpkg-reconfigure, but i really have **no** idea what i've changed at all..
2007-10-19T19:02:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	Ah, when dpkg-reconfigure command - was it   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver.xorg   or was it missing the -phigh part?
2007-10-19T19:03:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	it was missing the phigh part
2007-10-19T19:05:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	OK. Re-run the command without -phigh one more time. then when it asks about your mouse device put /dev/psaux if it's a ps2 mouse or /dev/ttyS0 if it's a serial mouse or the recommended one if it's a usb
2007-10-19T19:07:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	the mouse is a laptop mouse, is it then a serial one?

2007-10-19T19:07:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	For just changing resolutions, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg   next time :) It won't bug you about allt he devices etc etc
2007-10-19T19:07:00.000Z	genii		fuzzy:Likely serial
2007-10-19T19:08:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	ok.. thanks.. i didn't know that..
2007-10-19T19:08:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	ok i will try that
2007-10-19T19:09:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	also there should be a backed up copy of xorg.conf date-stamped. you can restore your old one by copying it over the messy current xorg.conf
2007-10-19T19:09:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	(if the reconfigure doesn't take)(
2007-10-19T19:10:00.000Z	genii	fuzzy	work calls me away for a minute but i have not left, checking msgs, scroll when I get i return
2007-10-19T19:12:00.000Z	fuzzy	genii	ok.. i'm going to restart x now, see if it worked.. will let u know
