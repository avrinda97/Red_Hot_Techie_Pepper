2007-08-11T07:59:00.000Z	lueho		where does software install usualy in linux?
2007-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	Goldfisch	lueho	Make sure it runs alright. If so, then I suggest moving it to /usr/local/bin, and if that doesn't exist, yes, you can put it in /usr/bin. /usr/local is usually for custom stuff, compared to "official" stuff.
