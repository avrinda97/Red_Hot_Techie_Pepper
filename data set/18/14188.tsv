2005-10-06T09:27:00.000Z	samu2		is the default calculator that comes with ubuntu known to be funny when using stored variables?
2005-10-06T09:28:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	 I use it a lot but not with stored variables, what are you doing? are you talking cli or X ?
2005-10-06T09:29:00.000Z	samu2	ompaul	i stored a number 0.160...... in memory R1. then i enter 0.412*R1 and get 11.something
2005-10-06T09:29:00.000Z	samu2		which doesnt seem right to me
2005-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	cli ? bc?
2005-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	samu2		if i enter the 0.160andsoon number manually i get the right number
2005-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	samu2	ompaul	the calculator in accessories
2005-10-06T09:34:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	just tested that, no problems there  perhaps you hit divide?
2005-10-06T09:34:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	some other key doh?
2005-10-06T09:34:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	.16 and .412?
2005-10-06T09:36:00.000Z	samu2	ompaul	i just did a simple calculation first to get 0.160890357 then i pressed Sto and chose R1. then i clear. enter 0.412* from the keyboard then press Rcl and chose R1 again. press = and i get 11.42734736
2005-10-06T09:38:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	doing it exactly as you have told me to I get 0.066286827
2005-10-06T09:39:00.000Z	samu2	ompaul	but you didnt do it EXACTLY like me. because you dont know what calculation got me 0.160... in the first place.
2005-10-06T09:39:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	care to join #ubuntu-offtopic
2005-10-06T09:40:00.000Z	samu2	ompaul	so it must be my Sto that goes wrong
2005-10-06T09:40:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	however I can put that number in storage
2005-10-06T09:41:00.000Z	samu2	ompaul	i get 11.4 no matter what i do
2005-10-06T09:41:00.000Z	ompaul	samu2	pm me this is not really channel material and if you have several steps I am willing to try it
