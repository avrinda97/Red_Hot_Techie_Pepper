2010-08-06T22:26:00.000Z	Alonea		anyone know how to go back to a previous kernel and remove the newer ones?
2010-08-06T22:28:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	you can edit your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file to show all available kernels at boot and select the one you want
2010-08-06T22:29:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	I did that, but when I load an earlier one and try to install drivers it complains of missing folders and stuff for that kernel
2010-08-06T22:31:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	fortunately I've never had to revert to an earlier kernel: what problem specifically are you having?
2010-08-06T22:31:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	wireless no longer works no matter how many time I reinstall the drivers.
2010-08-06T22:32:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	uh oh, what kind of wireless card are you using?
2010-08-06T22:32:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	and they used to work fine before, but after some update or another its broken
2010-08-06T22:32:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Atheros AR8132 / L1c Gigabit Ethernet Adapter (rev c0)02:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. Device 002c (rev 01)
2010-08-06T22:34:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	that's what I was afraid of. Atheros chipsets are notoriously buggy with linux systems. I just had a problem with the exact same 8132 chipset on a client's laptop and ended up having to reinstall Windows 7 which broke my heart
2010-08-06T22:35:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	and the thing is, its worked perfect for months. no issues once I started compiling them
2010-08-06T22:35:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	atheros has a linux driver for that family of chipsets on their support page but, I couldn't get it to work.
2010-08-06T22:36:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	I dont use those. I use the ones from this guide:http://linuxon1001p.blogspot.com/2010/03/fixing-wireless.html
2010-08-06T22:40:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	I didn't try the wireless driver install, just the ethernet driver and couldn't get it to work. Spent hours trying to figure it out and finally gave up. If you figure it out, please let me know. jonathanrlively@aim.com I service computers for a living and one service I'm proud to offer is setting up people with open source solutions and those *expletive* atheros chipsets have been making my life miserable. I always stick wit
2010-08-06T22:41:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	oh? my ethernet works fine. I am talking to you on it
2010-08-06T22:42:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	Never had an issue with wired, just wireless
2010-08-06T22:46:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	yeah, definitely a kernel version problem with the driver modules used. I always have problems with hardware vendors like Atheros and ATI and linux. They only offer limited support for their hardware. Next kernel update might break your ethernet too.
2010-08-06T22:46:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	if I wasn't already stressed out I would reinstall OS, but I need to calm down
2010-08-06T22:47:00.000Z	jonathanrlively	Alonea	hahaha, I feel your pain. I've spent the last two days just trying to get my login sound to work. Not a big deal but, stuff like that drives me crazy. And wireless connectivity is way more important.
