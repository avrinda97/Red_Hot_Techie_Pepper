2008-04-26T01:56:00.000Z	amenado		jPratt-> nothing i see yet myself, i haft to try the bcm43xx chips and see
2008-04-26T01:57:00.000Z	amenado		gpled-> i already told you the servers are extremely busy, just be patient
2008-04-26T01:58:00.000Z	amenado		needcdrom-> the server side may be busy
2008-04-26T01:59:00.000Z	amenado		csais-> are you trolling?
2008-04-26T02:00:00.000Z	amenado		Daat do you have an existing 7.10 running? would you like to try and boot the downloaded 8.04 iso from hd?
2008-04-26T02:00:00.000Z	amenado		dystopianray-> just checking..
2008-04-26T02:00:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	i had 7.10, but updated to 8.04 yesterday :P that's when the problems started
2008-04-26T02:00:00.000Z	amenado	DaaT	can you reboot back to 7.10?
2008-04-26T02:01:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	the only options at boot i have are 8.04 (with new and previous kernel)
2008-04-26T02:02:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	believe so. It's... 2.24 I think (trying to recall from memory) and new is 2.26, or something. You probably know it better than I do :)
2008-04-26T02:02:00.000Z	amenado	DaaT	then try to boot from the previous and we can probably load the new 8.04 from hard disk
2008-04-26T02:03:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	will do. How do I go about booting the ISO from HDD?
2008-04-26T02:05:00.000Z	amenado	DaaT	you have to mount the iso, then copy it over to a ext2 partition ext2 okay not ext3 and then put an entry on exisisting menu.lst for the new 8.04
2008-04-26T02:06:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	i'll look into it. But i have to say, when i boot into 7.10, there are no taskbars (top and bottom). Happened after yesterday's update
2008-04-26T02:07:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	yay :)
2008-04-26T02:09:00.000Z	DaaT	amenado	and drivetrax, thanks for the help. I'll keep trying to install from CD, though with it not accepting any user commands... *crosses fingers*
