2009-07-12T09:22:00.000Z	CatEater	edbian	sure, why not? someone else said xrandr, i didn't
2009-07-12T09:23:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	xrandr is used to configure your video settings :)  Resolution size etc etc.
2009-07-12T09:23:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	More specifically what is your problem then?  (Forget about xrandr)
2009-07-12T09:24:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	Than we do need xrandr!!  funny funny.
2009-07-12T09:24:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	in ubuntu run "xrandr -q" to see what the virtual card supports.
2009-07-12T09:25:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	What is the max listed?
2009-07-12T09:26:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	What is preventing you from doing that?
2009-07-12T09:26:00.000Z	CatEater	edbian	max listed is 1360x768
2009-07-12T09:26:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	That is an odd size huh.  Do you want to switch your resolution or do you want me to help you install ubuntu to the HDD natively?
2009-07-12T09:27:00.000Z	CatEater	edbian	i want to run ubuntu in a vm, at 1024x600
2009-07-12T09:28:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	Is that resolution listed in xrandr -q ??
2009-07-12T09:28:00.000Z	CatEater	edbian	not listed
2009-07-12T09:29:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	Not looking good man :(.  I don't know how to change the hardware of a virtual machine :(.  That command lists what the graphics card is capable of.
2009-07-12T09:30:00.000Z	edbian	CatEater	Try what Scunizi said.
