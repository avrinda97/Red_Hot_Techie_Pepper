2010-08-19T12:03:00.000Z	abhijit	hubi123	i think test disk does that. you just read their manual and give it a try
2010-08-19T12:05:00.000Z	hubi123	abhijit	My English is weak, so I ask again. TestDisk can help me?

2010-08-19T12:06:00.000Z	abhijit	hubi123	you can translate that testdisk page your your language using google
2010-08-19T12:07:00.000Z	abhijit	hubi123	there is google tool to do this
2010-08-19T12:07:00.000Z	abhijit	hubi123	or just ask in the your language channel so they can tell you more specific about it. which is your langauge?
2010-08-19T12:09:00.000Z	abhijit	hubi123	test disk may damage your hdd if used in wrong direction.
2010-08-19T12:11:00.000Z	hubi123	abhijit	This may the Lord will guide me? I think a long time it would not last, and health, I would have saved ...
