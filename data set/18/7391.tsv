2009-08-12T17:46:00.000Z	odinsbane		So I have a directory it is own by a user and in that users group.  I"ve done chmod 777 and still I get a permission denied from samba.
2009-08-12T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 samba can have its own 'security' features/limits as well.
2009-08-12T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 trying to make a 'public' share?
2009-08-12T18:17:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dr_Willis	I guess so
2009-08-12T18:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 thers some smb.conf settings to allow guest acc4ess, and  perhaps an example of a public share. or check teh samba docs in the 'samba-doc' package - it has books with examples of settng up public shares.
2009-08-12T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 if things are set up right your user can also make their own 'public' share that everyone can read/write to.
2009-08-12T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 the users /home  directories canbe set up to be a special share. Yes. :)  i always set up the users 'home' shares.
2009-08-12T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 the users can also set up their own shares in their own home area.
2009-08-12T18:37:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dr_Willis	we are going to use a server to share a hardrive for backing up our windows computers
2009-08-12T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	  Thats should be doable rather easially. I dont have a smb.conf with a public share on this pc.. or id paste my example.
2009-08-12T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 i know the 'using samba' book in the samba-doc pckage has such an example.
2009-08-12T18:38:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dr_Willis	I think it is setup, when my boss gets in we'll finish the accounts
2009-08-12T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	  i also always give every linxu user a samba password with 'sudo smbpasswd -a username' out of old habbit also.
2009-08-12T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 i also have the habbit of setting up identical user names on the linux/wondows machines. :)
2009-08-12T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 somthing to watch out for with samba shares is  if you access them from the linux side and windows side.. that Linux IS case Senesetive.. that can sometimes cause issues  for example you had a Directory named "Downloads' vs 'downloads'  in the same share.
2009-08-12T18:44:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dr_Willis	now that I got it working I can start reducing permissions.
2009-11-22T19:39:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dr_Willis	is there a way to check for hibernate.  I try to avoid that issue by not using hibernate.
2009-11-22T19:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	odinsbane	 i just never use hibernate/suspend any more.   i find linux boots fast enough where i dont need it.. and windows.. well its so flakey with it..i dont use it.
