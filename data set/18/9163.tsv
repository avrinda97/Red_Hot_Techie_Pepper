2007-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	neverblue		need some direction in setting up apache2 in ubuntu, so I have a sites-available in /etc/apache2/, now is this a required "virtual host", and I need to add another "vh", or should I just change it appropriately?
2007-05-03T12:32:00.000Z	neverblue		seems each apache install can be very different, by what #apache tells me
2007-05-03T12:32:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	 you need a new VH for each distinct site.
2007-05-03T12:33:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	 actually, not technically true, but helpful...
2007-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	just to clarify, I have a <vh *> tag beginning the file, so I would need to add to that tag, or create a <vh new> tag, to say, point to a users dir?
2007-05-03T12:37:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	sudo /path/to/apache2/binary/ restart
2007-05-03T12:37:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	that doesnt work
2007-05-03T12:37:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	I'm confused about your vh setup
2007-05-03T12:38:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	its just a normal new install setu
2007-05-03T12:38:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	may I pm an example?
2007-05-03T12:38:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	i have a default fle in /etc/apache2/sites-available
2007-05-03T12:43:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	no pms I guess...
2007-05-03T12:43:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	:(
2007-05-03T12:43:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	we can just join a random channel?
2007-05-03T12:44:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19003/
2007-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	that works too :)
2007-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	wirelessmonkey	neverblue	We're smart like that ;)
2007-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	neverblue	wirelessmonkey	so that is close to whats listed in my default
