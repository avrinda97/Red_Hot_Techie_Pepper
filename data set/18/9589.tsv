2007-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	shafto		Guys, is there anyway to make totem play wmvs from a website link? Where they start embedded in webpages?
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	mplayer mozilla plugin, in repositories i think
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	depends though, wmv9/wma3 dont work so well, especially on 64bit
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	shafto	xtknight	do i need mplayer installed too?
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	probably, just install mozilla-mplayer
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	shafto	xtknight	but how do i stop totem from trying to play um?
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	oh, i have no idea
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	it opens in an external window?
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	shafto	xtknight	no the ones that embedded, say on bbc news
2007-03-24T07:47:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	yeah i know but are the embedded ones spawning external totem windows in order to play?
2007-03-24T07:47:00.000Z	shafto	xtknight	no
2007-03-24T07:48:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	ok, what is the 'totem' you speak of?  it is using totem embedded instead of mplayer embedded you mean?
2007-03-24T07:49:00.000Z	shafto	xtknight	totem is the standard movie player
2007-03-24T07:49:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	*pulls hair out*  yeah i know that :P   but you are saying totem is trying to play them instead of mplayer?  what do you want to happen?
2007-03-24T07:50:00.000Z	shafto	xtknight	Ohh sorry, yeah thats right, but they never work, so i want mplayer to play um instead
2007-03-24T07:50:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	oh ok.  well remove totem's browser plugin somehow perhaps, it would be in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins or ~/.mozilla/plugins
2007-03-24T07:50:00.000Z	xtknight	shafto	actualyl just remove totem-mozilla pkg
