2005-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	Fanskapet		hmm XFCE really owns KDE, nice with a slick and light GUI
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	Fanskapet		i use gnome-terminal really
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	Fanskapet		but good old xterm would work fine for me too
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	Fanskapet		i just use gnome-terminal for the tabs nothing more nothing less :)
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	reisio	Fanskapet	just for the tabs?
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	Fanskapet	reisio	well mostly atleast :)
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	reisio	Fanskapet	there's a package called "terminal" for Xfce that has tabs...mega unbloated compared to gnome-terminal
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	Fanskapet	reisio	okey well maybe i'l take that in consideration then.. but i have no access to internet via ubuntu right now since Telia fucked up their installation-date.. for the third time :(

2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	Fanskapet	reisio	does o
2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	Fanskapet	reisio	does it build on amd64 bit?
2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	reisio	Fanskapet	I wouldn't know
2005-08-08T13:24:00.000Z	reisio	Fanskapet	don't see why it wouldn't, but I've really no idea
2005-08-08T13:24:00.000Z	Fanskapet	reisio	seems to miss some nice things that the gnome one has though like displaying the path as tab-names instead of just "tab 1" "tab 2" etc.
2005-08-08T13:25:00.000Z	reisio	Fanskapet	uh, that's completely dependent on your ~/.bashrc :p
2005-08-08T13:25:00.000Z	reisio	Fanskapet	my "terminal" uses paths, because I've configured my ~/.bashrc to do it that way
2005-08-08T13:25:00.000Z	Fanskapet	reisio	ah okey.
