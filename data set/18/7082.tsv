2008-03-14T01:34:00.000Z	crdlb	kjoz	that's your real refresh rate

2008-03-14T01:34:00.000Z	kjoz	crdlb	can i change it? My eyes are killing me
2008-03-14T01:34:00.000Z	crdlb	kjoz	is it a CRT?

2008-03-14T01:35:00.000Z	crdlb	kjoz	LCD screens do not refresh
2008-03-14T01:35:00.000Z	crdlb		so they don't flicker at all
2008-03-14T01:36:00.000Z	kjoz	crdlb	any recommendations ? Sometimes even look at the monitor
2008-03-14T01:37:00.000Z	crdlb	kjoz	whatever the problem is, it's not the refresh rate
