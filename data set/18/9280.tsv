2007-04-21T15:02:00.000Z	Stonekeeper		hi! is the bcm43xx native driver still limited to 11mbs?
2007-04-21T15:03:00.000Z	Stonekeeper		should i use ndis for bcm43xx?
2007-04-21T15:03:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	I don't believe it is
2007-04-21T15:04:00.000Z	Stonekeeper	fade_uk	you dont believe it's limited? it's because I'm using G only on my router but speed is capped to 11mbs. I'm sat next to it
2007-04-21T15:04:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	I'm using the bcm43xx driver with firmware from cafuego, and I think I've got a 54M connection
2007-04-21T15:05:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	tried using iwconfig to alter the setting?
2007-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	Stonekeeper	fade_uk	oh no, how do i do that?
2007-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	to be honest I've never tested it properly, but I can set it to 54M, and I'm pretty sure that I've read that it's supported in the changelog
2007-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	iwconfig <nic> rate 54M
2007-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	Stonekeeper	fade_uk	thanks for your time pal
2007-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	wireless-rate 54M
2007-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	in /etc/network/interfaces to make it aplpy on startup
2007-04-21T15:08:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	not sure, I've had it in there pre-nm-applet
2007-04-21T15:08:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	but I'm unaware of any other way of configuring it
2007-04-21T15:09:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	try transferring something and see if it's any faster?
2007-04-21T15:10:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	that's PC->PC as I would presume your internet connection is slower than 11mbps anyway?
2007-04-21T15:11:00.000Z	fade_uk	Stonekeeper	odd it's eth1 everywhere for me
2007-04-21T15:14:00.000Z	Stonekeeper	fade_uk	was it baking hot where you were today?
