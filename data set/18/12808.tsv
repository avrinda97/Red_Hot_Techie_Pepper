2006-03-20T15:19:00.000Z	s_spiff	chuckyp	i got dc++..but too slow...i wanted something better
2006-03-20T15:20:00.000Z	s_spiff	chuckyp	anything else apart from frost wire?
2006-03-20T15:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	I use bit torrent a lot.  Pretty fast once it gets cranking.
2006-10-19T14:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	i'm sure the gaim people do
2006-10-19T14:04:00.000Z	s_spiff	chuckyp	umm wher can i get them? any channel for that?
2006-10-19T14:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	i dunno #gaim or ##gaim i'm sure is here.
2006-10-19T14:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	apt-cache showpkg gaim
2006-10-19T14:17:00.000Z	s_spiff	chuckyp	thanks
2006-10-19T14:28:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	ont he forums are some walkthroughs
2006-10-19T14:28:00.000Z	s_spiff	chuckyp	i did check, but couldn't find anything on the amd64 forum
2006-10-19T14:29:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	you would probably have to compile it on your own.
2006-10-19T14:29:00.000Z	chuckyp	s_spiff	unless someone has a deb.  I thought I saw a deb for gaim 64bit on the forums.
2006-10-19T14:29:00.000Z	s_spiff	chuckyp	will look for it. thanks
