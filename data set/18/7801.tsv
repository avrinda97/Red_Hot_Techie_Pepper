2009-02-03T03:06:00.000Z	dmi3on	user_	run thightvnc or ultravnc from vista
2009-02-03T03:07:00.000Z	dmi3on	user_	and i both i get same screen
2009-02-03T03:07:00.000Z	user_	dmi3on	uh, dont know nothing about vista, sorry :-(
2009-02-03T03:09:00.000Z	dmi3on	user_	i think probelem is with server because if i run sudo vncserver everything works fine only i cant kill server with comman vncserver -kill :1
2009-02-03T03:10:00.000Z	dmi3on	user_	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/vnc-server-and-red-hat-8-blank-screen-103360/ that is exactly like my problem i just have blank startup
2009-02-03T03:10:00.000Z	user_	dmi3on	hmm, i think you can kill any program by using: kill -9 $pid
2009-02-03T03:10:00.000Z	dmi3on	user_	in fron should be vcnserver ?
2009-02-03T03:11:00.000Z	user_	dmi3on	sorry, what is "fron"?
2009-02-03T03:13:00.000Z	user_	dmi3on	ps axu | grep vncserver to find the process id. then "kill -9 $processid" (replace $processid with _your_ value)
2009-02-03T03:13:00.000Z	dmi3on	user_	thx
2009-02-04T00:27:00.000Z	user_	dmi3on	ah, i remember you, could you just repost your vnc server command?
