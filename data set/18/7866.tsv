2008-02-29T02:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I'm trying to setup my displays so that the external display can be a higher resolution than the laptop's internal LCD display
2008-02-29T02:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I've got it basically setup - except that when I boot up, the resolution that gnome takes up is equal to the resolution of the laptop panel (1024x768) vs the resolution of the external screen (1280x1024)
2008-02-29T02:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Basically, it shoves the gnome panels/desktop in the upper left corner - and doesn't stretch across the remaining screen space
2008-02-29T02:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Anyone have any solutions?

2008-02-29T02:41:00.000Z	Cpudan80	daef	I can edit the file by hand, if you know what I need to do
2008-02-29T02:41:00.000Z	daef	Cpudan80	post your config in any pastebin...

2008-02-29T02:45:00.000Z	daef	Cpudan80	try to restrict 1024 for the external display... (remove "1024x768" from line 118)
2008-02-29T02:46:00.000Z	Cpudan80	daef	hrm... ok
2008-02-29T02:46:00.000Z	Cpudan80	daef	brb - restart x
2008-02-29T02:48:00.000Z	Cpudan80	daef	Same result
2008-02-29T02:48:00.000Z	daef	Cpudan80	shame...
2008-02-29T02:50:00.000Z	Cpudan80	daef	Kinda weird --- the desktop looks ok (ie. it takes up the full 1280x1024) --- just the gnome panels and such are stuck in the other mode
2008-02-29T02:50:00.000Z	daef	Cpudan80	try the default X-background - there you see if your resolution is okay...
