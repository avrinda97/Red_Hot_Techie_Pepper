2007-01-19T10:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	gksudo "update-manager -c"
2007-01-19T10:19:00.000Z	Zaggynl	gnomefreak	is there a way of reversing in case things break?
2007-01-19T10:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	nope
2007-01-19T10:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	if it breaks its because of outside software more than likely
2007-01-19T10:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	most of the time its fixable but wont know until its tried.
2007-04-06T15:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	easier to upgrade and please see #ubuntu+1 for feisty questions
2007-04-06T15:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	upgrade to edgy first
2007-04-06T15:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zaggynl	that would be due to unsupported packages most likely. only supported way to upgrade is dapper to edgy to feisty. skipping one can cause very very bug issues
