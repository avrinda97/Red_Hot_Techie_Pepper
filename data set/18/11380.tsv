2006-08-04T14:12:00.000Z	Flowking		Does xmms play mp3's in ubuntu ? .. redhat has patched it so that it does not and users are forced to use rhythmbox or other things
2006-08-04T14:12:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	yes if you have the mp3 codecs
2006-08-04T14:13:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	see this (other redhat "recommended players work great") http://mange.dynalias.org/linux/misc/xmms_redhat_packaged/xmms_redhat_packaged.png
2006-08-04T14:14:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	They are the "LOCKIN"-Devil itself
2006-08-04T14:14:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	no free linux distros have out of the box mp3 support
2006-08-04T14:15:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	i was using linux before most anyone in this channel... im developing it
2006-08-04T14:15:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	I code gadmintools.org atm
2006-08-04T14:17:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	then I obviously have absolutely no clue what you are talking about?
2006-08-04T14:18:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	in that case can you help me with my /etc/network/interfaces file?
2006-08-04T14:18:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	Flowking, "no free linux distros have out of the box mp3 support" i know.. redhat patched xmms to not support mp3
2006-08-04T14:18:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	youre no coder perhaps.. then i see why youre not getting the lockin
2006-08-04T14:19:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	redhat "Use commercial apps or dont listen to mp3's at all"
2006-08-04T14:19:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	or no longer free as in free speech right?
2006-08-04T14:19:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	not free as in anything dude
2006-08-04T14:20:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	ouch
2006-08-04T14:20:00.000Z	aujordanh	Flowking	you know alot about networking?
2006-08-04T14:20:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	speech must always be free (say "shit" on efnets linux channel, for each iteration youll be banned *2 weeks :P)
2006-08-04T14:21:00.000Z	Flowking	aujordanh	So we stuck an army of ugly bots there :)
