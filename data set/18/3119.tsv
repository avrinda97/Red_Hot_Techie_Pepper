2009-12-10T08:01:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb		Hey I have a set up of 3 monitors, 2 of which are in twinview and 1 as a separate X screen... However, the problem is that the two twinview monitors are stretched, as in it shows up as one large monitor instead of two separate monitors.
2009-12-10T08:01:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb		I couldn't figure out how to fix this :X
2009-12-10T08:01:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb		Any ideas?
2009-12-10T08:03:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb		I guess no one likes to mess with xorg.conf eh?
2009-12-10T08:03:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb		:(
2009-12-10T08:04:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	why would you want to do that?
2009-12-10T08:04:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	it is mostly automatic now...
2009-12-10T08:04:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	just joined the channel.
2009-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	I thought that was what TwinView was supposed to do? Stretch?
2009-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	what do you want?
2009-12-10T08:07:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	set them all as separate?
2009-12-10T08:07:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	run Nvidia X server settings with sudo and set things up the way you want to clobber /etc/xorg/xorg.conf
2009-12-10T08:10:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	Detect Displays, click on screen, choose config?
2009-12-10T08:12:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb	freetown2	but well, it only shows me 3 options for the monitor: Disabled, Separate X screen, or TwinView.. Disabled of course disables the screen entirely, Separate X screen is not what I want, and TwinView spans between two monitors.
2009-12-10T08:12:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	so what do you want? a clone?
2009-12-10T08:13:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb	freetown2	No, quite simply I want two monitors which have their own sets of panels, and then a third monitor with a separate X screen.
2009-12-10T08:16:00.000Z	freetown2	LinuxN3wb	i'd get a three screen stretched desktop and then run flightgear!
2009-12-10T08:16:00.000Z	LinuxN3wb	freetown2	I have 1920x1200 monitors... There are no 3 screen stretchers for that in my price range.
