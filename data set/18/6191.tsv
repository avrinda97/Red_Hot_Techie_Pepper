2008-06-10T02:45:00.000Z	Renate		bdm43:  ms wireless desktop elite (kybd and mouse).  it worked just fine, until the last round of updates.
2008-06-10T02:50:00.000Z	Renate	BCM43	 ubuntu is refusing to recognize my "ms wireless desktop elite" kybd and mouse, since the last updates.  when i reboot, it flashes when loading the dell bios, but then goes off once ubuntu takes over.  i have the driver.exe on disk and downloaded, but it will not let me install it, even under wine.
