2006-06-01T08:51:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		I've just tried to install Dapper on a system with 256MB of RAM
2006-06-01T08:51:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		is there a way to install it without going through Live?
2006-06-01T08:52:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		that's text based install, right?
2006-06-01T08:53:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		well that's a big step aside from FC5 style of installing
2006-06-01T08:53:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		Ubuntu wants to be a Linux fro humans
2006-06-01T08:53:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		it should be a way to install it directly graphical
2006-06-01T08:54:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		don't you think?
2006-06-01T08:54:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		yes
2006-06-01T08:54:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		but it goes through Live
2006-06-01T08:55:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		I tried
2006-06-01T08:55:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ubuntuNewbee	what do you mean by goes through live?
2006-06-01T08:55:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ubuntuNewbee	no, you don't have to use a live cd, just download the iso of the install cd
2006-06-01T09:06:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	KenSentMe	lord_rob: these are the facts: I downloaded Desktop CD and booted from it. The menu showed and there it was the Start/Install Ubuntu. I clicked on it hopping that the installer would ask me what on earth I want: Start for trying, or Install Complete, all in graphical. But nothing of what I would have liked happened. It just started to load and load... It loaded the tryout version...
2006-06-01T09:07:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ubuntuNewbee	no, you don't have to use a live cd, just download the iso of the install cd
2006-06-01T09:08:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	KenSentMe	text based is not an option to show it to others
2006-06-01T09:08:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ubuntuNewbee	it's not text based
2006-06-01T09:09:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ubuntuNewbee	sorry, i misunderstood
2006-06-01T09:12:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ubuntuNewbee	it's a text install, but that doesn't mean it's hard. You don't have to do things manually, it just doesn;t look that fancy etc.
