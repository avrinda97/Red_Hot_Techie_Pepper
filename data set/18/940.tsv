2011-08-09T21:10:00.000Z	irrumator_		I'm having this issue whenever I try to sudo apt-get update now for some reason: E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
2011-08-09T21:10:00.000Z	irrumator_		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2011-08-09T21:10:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	yes
2011-08-09T21:11:00.000Z	irrumator_	edbian	so..you familiar with this problem and how to fix it?
2011-08-09T21:12:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	yep
2011-08-09T21:12:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	ps -e   lists all processes.  Do you see any dpkg, apt, aptitude, or synaptic processes running in that list?
2011-08-09T21:13:00.000Z	irrumator_	edbian	yeah, i grep'd for apt, aptitude, and synaptic. the only one that returned something was apt for:  5973 ?        00:00:00 update-apt-xapi
2011-08-09T21:13:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	Kill it
2011-08-09T21:14:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	I'm not really sure what it is.  Probably something to do with the gui update-manager
2011-08-09T21:15:00.000Z	irrumator_	edbian	great success :) thank you so much mon kapitan!
2011-08-09T21:15:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	sure
2011-08-10T03:38:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	nmap
2011-08-10T03:38:00.000Z	irrumator_	edbian	yeah, i know of that tool, but not sure how to scan myself...
2011-08-10T03:39:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	namp <ip address of machine>     That's all there is to it
2011-08-10T03:39:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	Might wanna give it -A to get more detail :)
2011-08-10T04:46:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	chmod 640 /path/to/file/
2011-08-10T04:46:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	Learn what 640 represents and I think ls -l will be clear enough :)
2011-08-10T04:47:00.000Z	edbian	irrumator_	:)
