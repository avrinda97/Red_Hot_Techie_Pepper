2009-12-15T21:29:00.000Z	sacarlson		just no method to live boot
2009-12-15T21:31:00.000Z	sacarlson		want the checksum?
2009-12-15T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson		ubuntu-9.10-alternate-i386.iso
2009-12-15T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson		I guess the alternate copy has no live cd option
2009-12-15T21:34:00.000Z	sacarlson		yes or no?
2009-12-15T21:36:00.000Z	sacarlson		bummer I think I need to down load another copy

2009-12-15T21:36:00.000Z	sacarlson		I wanted to try the usb pen drive install on it
2009-12-15T21:37:00.000Z	sacarlson		I have two ISP so if one fails I will go to the other
2009-12-15T21:38:00.000Z	sacarlson		does the USB pen drive boot work on 9.10?
2009-12-15T21:38:00.000Z	Slart	sacarlson	if your motherboard supports booting from usb I think it will work on ubuntu as well
2009-12-15T21:39:00.000Z	Slart	sacarlson	why not give it a try.. then you can tell us if it works.. I haven't heard anything about problems with usb booting and 9.10
2009-12-15T21:40:00.000Z	Slart	sacarlson	let us know the result.. for when the next person asks the same question =)
