2008-04-25T18:46:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	I'm not sure, but I could install it with aptitude.
2008-04-25T18:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	no it is not
2008-04-25T18:45:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	How do I find a package I could install with Gutsy's repositories then? Thanks.
2008-04-25T18:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	which package?
2008-04-25T18:46:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	xfonts-artwiz2
2008-04-25T18:46:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	Do I need to uncomment some lines in sources.list?
2008-04-25T18:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	was it in the official gutsy repos?
2008-04-25T18:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	there is xfonts-artwiz
2008-04-25T18:47:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	hm yeah my sources.list may be incorrect
2008-04-25T18:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	that package was not in gutsy either
2008-04-25T18:52:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=artwiz&searchon=all&suite=gutsy&section=all
2008-04-25T18:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	oh sorry i thought you mentioned xfonts-artwiz2 earlier
2008-04-25T18:53:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	Yeah sorry typo
2008-04-25T18:54:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	Is it okay if I add the gutsy universe repository line in my sources.list in order to install that xfonts-artwiz package?
2008-04-25T18:55:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	i wouldn't think so, no
2008-04-25T18:55:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	How do I get that package then? Thanks.
2008-04-25T18:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	LainIwakura	no idea, find out why it's not included in hardy
2008-04-25T18:56:00.000Z	LainIwakura	dystopianray	Alright.. thanks.
