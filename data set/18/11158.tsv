2006-09-04T16:26:00.000Z	caseyomah		Oh, not the big man though. lol
2006-09-04T16:27:00.000Z	caseyomah		Beep to the point of buzz.
2006-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	no
2006-09-04T16:28:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	Mute, volume down everything, unmute main, volume up one at a time.
2006-09-04T16:28:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	i did but its something in OSS mixer
2006-09-04T16:28:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	so with all volumes down it still beep/buzzes?
2006-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	then turn up main and listen, then one at a time, if the beep comes back mute that one again.
2006-09-04T16:31:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	Unfortunately there is no "revert" button in Mixer.
2006-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	if you find it's PCM (Wave) that is beeping it could be a stopped process using it, a reboot would fix that.
2006-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	i have rebooted 4 times i think
2006-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	Not that then.
2006-09-04T16:33:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	Now im in Alsa mixer and its PCM that is beeping. If i mute it, then it stops.
2006-09-04T16:34:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	Unmute then it starts again
2006-09-04T16:36:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	can i use some command and see wich programs that are using OSSmixer atm?
2006-09-04T16:36:00.000Z	Naik0	caseyomah	can i use some command and see wich programs that are using OSSmixer atm?
2006-09-04T16:37:00.000Z	caseyomah	Naik0	I don't know of any...
