2006-11-16T08:07:00.000Z	cobelloy		hi - I need to move my home folder to another partition, or maybe home and /usr - how do I do it without breaking the system?
2006-11-16T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	you want to move it or just copy it?
2006-11-16T08:08:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	I am running low on space on the part it is installed on
2006-11-16T08:09:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	did you think maybe you could use the other partition to host all of your personal files to free up space in /home
2006-11-16T08:09:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	i already have most of my personal files on a seperate part
2006-11-16T08:10:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	well, it can be done. I wouldn't be confident enough to guide you because of the chance of failure (I don't want that over my head).
2006-11-16T08:14:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	is there any way to resize the root partition while ubuntu is running?
2006-11-16T08:14:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	no
2006-11-16T08:14:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	go into the live cd
2006-11-16T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	yeah you can't resize beyond an extended partition
2006-11-16T08:16:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	you are not in a good situation. It will be near impossible to resize your root partition without losing all your data, at least from what I am thinking your situation is
2006-11-16T08:16:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	I have an extended with three parts in it, I want to delete one and extend another in to the empty space
2006-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	even from the live cd?
2006-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	oh, well delete the other partitions in the extended partition, and extend the root partition, should be fairly simple
2006-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	yeah
2006-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	cobelloy	the only reason I balked was because I thought you were trying to make the root partition  bigger than the extended partition, which obviously is troublesome
2006-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	ok - will give that a try then - thanks
2006-11-16T08:18:00.000Z	cobelloy	bruenig	yes - it is hard to give a complete explanation in one sentence ;)
