2006-02-24T14:21:00.000Z	uber_spaced		how do I mount a palm pilot?
2006-02-24T14:21:00.000Z	uber_spaced		i.e.
2006-02-24T14:22:00.000Z	uber_spaced		mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1 ?
2006-02-24T14:22:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 mount the internal memory card?
2006-02-24T14:22:00.000Z	uber_spaced	wastrel	sure, that will be a good start
2006-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 you mean sync or mount the internal memory card?  is it a usb palm?  with hotplug my usb device appears once i hit the hotsync button on the palm
2006-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 and you can't mount the memory card without support for that on the palm device
2006-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	uber_spaced	wastrel	where does it mount to?  what entry in the dev folder?
2006-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	uber_spaced	wastrel	ok ok.  I'll go into KDE and try it.
2006-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 /dev/USB0 for me... it depends on whether usb devices are already plugged in
2006-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 er /dev/ttyUSB0
2006-02-24T14:27:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 tail -f /var/log/messages  - that should show you when you hit hotsync what's going on....
2006-02-24T14:29:00.000Z	uber_spaced	wastrel	i'll take a look into it.
2006-02-24T14:42:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 i think for mp3's you need to put them on the removable media
2006-02-24T14:42:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 kpilot can only sync over palm databases
2006-02-24T14:42:00.000Z	wastrel	uber_spaced	 best bet is to get a flash card/sd card reader
2006-02-24T14:42:00.000Z	uber_spaced	wastrel	I see; so i'll probably need a card reader or something...
2006-02-24T14:43:00.000Z	uber_spaced	wastrel	again, thanks.
