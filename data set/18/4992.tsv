2009-01-05T17:41:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	 Would you know if I should have DNS server enabled?
2009-01-05T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	use nslookup (some ip), if you get responses from 127.x.x.x or localhost you have one installed
2009-01-05T17:42:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	 It's not installed yet.  I'm using alternative disc this time.
2009-01-05T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	then you dont have one and rely on other servers for resolution
2009-01-05T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	could try puppy linux
2009-01-05T18:41:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	 See the issue ortsvorsteher is having with his driver.  Any idea why?
2009-01-05T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	install nvidia-settings so you can configure the card
2009-01-05T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	same
2009-01-05T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	apt-cache search <anything>
2009-01-18T05:34:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	Anything you would like me to try with alltray?  I want the gold. :)
2009-01-18T05:34:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	I can install it... if that's the case.
2009-01-18T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	it allows you to send apps that sit in the program list to the system tray, like thunderbird doesnt run there, it runs in the app list
2009-01-18T05:36:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	I see the info on that one.  But I'm asking if you would want me to test something for you.  I'm trying to be a helping hand here.  Lol.
2009-01-18T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	oh it works, just sharing my knowledge
2009-01-18T05:37:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	The apps looks good.  I'm testing it.
2009-01-18T05:37:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip	Thanks. :)
2009-01-18T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jinja-sheep	stuff you want out of the way you can shove down there with alltray, thunderbird is a good example
