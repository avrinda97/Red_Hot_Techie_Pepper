2008-02-19T08:08:00.000Z	rilo		What would cause "sudo ifconfig eth0 down" to execute without errors, but not bring the interface down?
2008-02-19T08:09:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	rootkit   bug   warpper script   kernel bug   ???
2008-02-19T08:10:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	oh   and    sudo error    to test that one   do    sudo echo boo     if it says boo it's not sudo
2008-02-19T08:12:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	hm, it does say boo
2008-02-19T08:13:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	oh   and    sudo error    to test that one   do    sudo echo boo     if it says boo it's not sudo
2008-02-19T08:16:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	would you care to test sudo for us.     sudo echo boo
2008-02-19T08:16:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	why wouldn't sudo be able to use echo... I did say it returned "boo"
2008-02-19T08:18:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	sorry i didn't see your first post of "it returns boo".   ok. that rules out it being sudo.   you did    ifconfig      just to see that the eth0 is still up ?
2008-02-19T08:19:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	yea... I brought down the two vmware interfaces and that worked fine... eth0 still hanging on strong though
2008-02-19T08:23:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	check the process table to see what might be running interfearance there ?    i'm like you.  that's a new can of verms,  very interested in what is causing it...
2008-02-19T08:33:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	nfs shares ?
2008-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	nope
2008-02-19T08:36:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	hmmm   samba ?       i'm trying to think of anything that might possably hi-jack a network interface...
2008-02-19T08:36:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	nope! hardly anything on here
2008-02-19T08:37:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	i'll second the band wagon, i'm no troll either.
2008-02-19T08:38:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	so does that mean you're really an agent? :)
2008-02-19T08:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rilo	heh.  yeah and a creationest.  which is what i was refering to.
2008-02-19T08:39:00.000Z	rilo	Agent_bob	haha, oh :D
