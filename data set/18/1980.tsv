2012-08-30T11:48:00.000Z	nbubuntu		Hi , anyone know which program which able to move file with GUI interface ? reason using command line mv works but doesn't show % of complete. Maybe a GUI Move file program able to show it ?
2012-08-30T11:49:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	the file manager, nautilus ?
2012-08-30T11:51:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	luftikuss : nautilus file manager doesn't have move option
2012-08-30T11:51:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	it does
2012-08-30T11:51:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: I mean in gui which show % of complete
2012-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	it does
2012-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: huh ? where ?
2012-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	when you move a file.....it shows you a progress bar if it's big enough to take longer than a nano second
2012-08-30T11:53:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: that one is Cut and paste file.Not move file.
2012-08-30T11:54:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	1.) cut and paste IS move 2.) if you drag and drop with shift, it's move.
2012-08-30T11:54:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	there is also set "move" paths
2012-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: drap and drop = copy , cut and paste is move ?
2012-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	please re-read what I sid
2012-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: why when I cut a folder to another partition my folder modified date get change while command line mv doesn't ?
2012-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	no idea, how the file manager processes it ?
2012-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	ikonia	nbubuntu	again if you drag while holding shift it will move
2012-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: ok , thanks , I guess cut and shift is the different.Thanks for telling :D
2012-08-30T12:12:00.000Z	nbubuntu	ikonia	: nope , it doesn't reserve the modified time
