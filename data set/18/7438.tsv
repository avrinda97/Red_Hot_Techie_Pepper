2009-08-05T00:17:00.000Z	proq		does anyone know of an administrative tool to completely lock down the UI for a machine while it is in maintenance mode?
2009-08-05T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	what do you mean lock it down in maintenance mode ?
2009-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	check the uuid's in grub's menu.lst and fstab again
2009-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	I changed all the UUIDs to /dev/sda2
2009-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	are you %101 certain ?
2009-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	yes
2009-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	thats all that could be effecting it, please pastebin your menu.lst, your fstab and the output of "sudo blikd"
2009-08-07T22:18:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	I don't see a tool called blikd in repos or on my system
2009-08-07T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	you open the terminal and type "sudo blikd"
2009-08-07T22:18:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	yes, and it says not found
2009-08-07T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	sorry sudo blkid
2009-08-07T22:20:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/249339/
2009-08-07T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	please also put the output of "sudo blkid"
2009-08-07T22:22:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/249340/
2009-08-07T22:22:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	try setting the UUID's instead of the device names, I agree it shouldn't matter but lets check it
2009-08-07T22:39:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	nope, I changed my uuids in fstab and menu.lst and it is still using sda1 as /
2009-08-07T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	proq	I can't see how it can be mounting the wrong file system ?
2009-08-07T22:40:00.000Z	proq	ikonia	I don't either.  this is pretty weird
