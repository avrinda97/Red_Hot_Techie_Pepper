2008-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	Shaba2		dam I am downloading and iso
2008-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	Shaba2		I hate to have to reboot
2008-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	Shaba2		only 13% done
2008-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	Shaba2		but will firefox pic up where it left off
2008-07-07T00:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	Let me take a stab at it. What are you trying to kill?
2008-07-07T00:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	What comand sequence did you try to use?
2008-07-07T00:32:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	If you do umount it, you'll have to use the force option
2008-07-07T00:34:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	When I kill a process, I use the following sequence: ps -fu <my username> | grep <name of the process I'm trying to kill.
2008-07-07T00:35:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	Then look for the PID of the process you want and kill that number.
2008-07-07T00:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	What you might actually want to do is use the mount command to see all the mounted deives.
2008-07-07T00:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	Identify the device path of your cdrom drive and use THAT path to forcefully umount it.
2008-07-07T00:41:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	Like I said, you will need to FORCE it. Type man umount to see what the option is for forcing.
2008-07-07T00:41:00.000Z	Shaba2	bobertdos	I tried "sudo umount /media/cdrom0 -f"
2008-07-07T00:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	Try looking up the device path instead.
2008-07-07T00:43:00.000Z	Shaba2	bobertdos	is that not /media/cdrom0?
2008-07-07T00:44:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	Type mount to see a list of everything that's currently mounted.
2008-07-07T00:47:00.000Z	Shaba2	bobertdos	"umount /dev/scd0 -f" says "umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy"
2008-07-07T00:49:00.000Z	bobertdos	Shaba2	I think you're stuck. If I were you, I'd just wait for your iso to finish, if it can.
