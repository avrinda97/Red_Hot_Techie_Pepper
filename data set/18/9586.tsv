2007-12-19T21:34:00.000Z	adamski84		i am trying to install swiftfox
2007-12-19T21:34:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	that's a shellscript
2007-12-19T21:35:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	well... no
2007-12-19T21:35:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	just an indicator that its can be opened by a shell
2007-12-19T21:36:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	yep
2007-12-19T21:36:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	chmod +x nameoffilehere
2007-12-19T21:37:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	and put ./ in the front of it
2007-12-19T21:37:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	(unlike dos, the current path is NOT searched for commands by default)
2007-12-19T21:38:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	as this could be a security risk
2007-12-19T21:39:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	no
2007-12-19T21:39:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	but I can pass you a good tutorial
2007-12-19T21:40:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	http://help.ubuntu.com/
2007-12-19T21:40:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	there's a basic guide there that's pretty good
2007-12-19T21:41:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	a good terminal guide to get you started is located here: http://www.linuxcommand.org/
2007-12-19T21:42:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	will help get you interacting with your linux machine through the terminal instead of the gui
2007-12-19T21:42:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	which tends to be more usable across different distros of linux
2007-12-19T21:42:00.000Z	neozen	adamski84	and unix in general
