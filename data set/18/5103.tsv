2008-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	iminhell		How do I delete a folder that it says i can not delete?    I want to remove /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.27-9/arch/sh
2008-12-16T14:11:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	why do you want to remove that folder?
2008-12-16T14:12:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	just a duplicate of a makefile that i think may be the root of my dvd playback troubles, I don't have -9 on here.
2008-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	i don't understand how a makefile can be the source of dvd playback trouble. Can you explain it? And do this for me and give me the output .. uname -a
2008-12-16T14:17:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	http://paste.ubuntu.com/86121/       I can't get any dvd to play, I submitted a bug because we though we found the problem, they list it as answered now but I still don't have a fix, I've not had good luck with Ubuntu yet. Here is the link to my launchpad --> https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/54351
2008-12-16T14:18:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	you have a specific reason not to be on the -9 kernel?
2008-12-16T14:18:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	and do you have the libdvdcss package from medibuntu installed?
2008-12-16T14:19:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	not really  and yes
2008-12-16T14:19:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	well i would always suggest to be on the latest kernel, which would be the -9 kernel in this case. You've tried the fix they gave? adding it to .bashrc
2008-12-16T14:20:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	 It wouldn't add to the .bashrc. At least when I looked at the files I saw nothing relating to dvdcss
2008-12-16T14:21:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	that's because .bashrc isn't related to libdvdcss, dvdcss or anything for that matter. However, what you'll be adding there will affect all applications. Are you willing to try it?
2008-12-16T14:21:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	if those links to the paste still work, that was exactly what was in those files
2008-12-16T14:22:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	i know .bashrc :-) The effect would be that you won't have to set the env variable, because it's set as soon as you login.
2008-12-16T14:22:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	can try, I got nothing to loose
2008-12-16T14:23:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	alright. It's fairly easy actually, open up a terminal and copy this command to execute -->echo "export DVDCSS_METHOD=title" >> ~/.bashrc
2008-12-16T14:23:00.000Z	hischild	iminhell	then log out, back in, and see if it works.
2008-12-16T14:30:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	didn't work
2008-12-16T14:44:00.000Z	iminhell	hischild	 you still here?
