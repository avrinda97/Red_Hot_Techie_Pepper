2010-01-11T01:10:00.000Z	askreet		Does anyone else have an issue with bash starting in / instead of $HOME?
2010-01-11T01:11:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 no, but I've seen that issue before.  Usually means your home directory isn't associated with your username
2010-01-11T01:11:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	Yeah, it's in passwd, the $HOME variable is set correctly and typing 'cd' puts me in ~.
2010-01-11T01:12:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 go to system -> Administration -> Users and Groups, make sure your home directory is listed next to your login name
2010-01-11T01:12:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	Yeah it's all based on /etc/passwd -- which is correct.
2010-01-11T01:13:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 open a new terminal, then type export | grep -i "yourhomedir"
2010-01-11T01:14:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	$HOME is set.
2010-01-11T01:14:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 that command returns your properly set one?
2010-01-11T01:16:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 check your .bashrc, /etc/bash.rc, /etc/profile or /etc/profile.d/ for cd commands or scripts that cd to root,
2010-01-11T01:16:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	Good point.  Checking.
2010-01-11T01:20:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	In many ways, yes.
2010-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 find anything in those locations?
2010-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	No 'cd' in either system-wide file :(
2010-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	And I moved my user files out of the way.
2010-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	I give up for now.  Going to go play video games.  Nothing like not solving a problem.
2010-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	laebshade	askreet	 heh.  Create a new user, log in with it, and see what happens
2010-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	askreet	laebshade	I will some other time.  baddies need squishing.
