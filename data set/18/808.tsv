2011-08-31T08:05:00.000Z	dskdaskads		I have a weird problem with sensors: it only shows temp of core0 and core2 but I think it detected all 4 cores when I installed sensors for the first time. is there a solution for this?
2011-08-31T08:06:00.000Z	dskdaskads		...
2011-08-31T08:06:00.000Z	dskdaskads		it's a quad cpu..
2011-08-31T08:07:00.000Z	dskdaskads		lol
2011-08-31T08:07:00.000Z	dskdaskads		SYstem Monitor detects all 4cores
2011-08-31T08:07:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	could be that those two monitors are malfunctioning and not reporting.
2011-08-31T08:08:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	if it's showing two of them but not the other two then I'd go for the two not showing being broken. There shouldn't be different modules for each monitor
2011-08-31T08:09:00.000Z	dskdaskads	Polah	when you say "broken".. you mean the hardware or configuration?
2011-08-31T08:09:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	could be configuration selected to not report those two actually, you could take a look at that. I'd go for hardware though
2011-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	dskdaskads	Polah	like I said before.. I remember it detected all cores
2011-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	hardware failure then. You could try from a live session to see if it picks them up, or another operating system
2011-08-31T08:14:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	on the moon is my guess
2011-08-31T08:14:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	do you have another operating system at hand you could check on to see if the monitors are functioning?
2011-08-31T08:15:00.000Z	dskdaskads	Polah	backtrack
2011-08-31T08:15:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	you could try on backtrack. I'd go for Windows anyway since that's a whole different kernel and suchlike
2011-08-31T08:15:00.000Z	dskdaskads	Polah	if u know a free app for win7 pm me
2011-08-31T08:16:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	speccy or CPU-Z should be able to tell you core temperatures
2011-08-31T08:36:00.000Z	Polah	dskdaskads	then that's probably onboard. GPUs that don't have dedicated video memory (i.e. onboard GPUs) borrow from the system memory. 256MB would seem pretty normal and would give you 3.7GB instead of the full 4GB
