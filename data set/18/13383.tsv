2005-12-23T17:14:00.000Z	shadox		well, i just downloaded the 1.5 version
2005-12-23T17:15:00.000Z	shadox		but when i install it, it allways sais E: can not found the package, but the package is on my desktop
2005-12-23T17:16:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	is it a .deb package?
2005-12-23T17:16:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	if so, you have to open a command line, cd Desktop then dpkg --install __FILENAME__
2005-12-23T17:17:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	in that case you would have to compile it
2005-12-23T17:17:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	you can't just simply install it
2005-12-23T17:18:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	if you need the new firefox, I suggest you download the latest dapper package, I can give you the url
2005-12-23T17:20:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	http://wservices.ch/~lucas/ablage/firefox_1.4.99+1.5rc3.dfsg-1ubuntu6_i386.deb
2005-12-23T17:21:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	you have to wait a little bit, I am not finished uploading it
2005-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	it is only 50% by now
2005-12-23T17:27:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	did you enable main in sources.list(apt)
2005-12-23T17:29:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	what gives you apt-cache search gstreamer?
2005-12-23T17:30:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	or when you search in synaptic?
2005-12-23T17:34:00.000Z	lucasvo	shadox	can you paste the output on pastebin.com?
