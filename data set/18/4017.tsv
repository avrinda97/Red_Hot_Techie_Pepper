2009-06-12T08:52:00.000Z	lexxy		hey people
2009-06-12T08:52:00.000Z	lexxy		how are yall?
2009-06-12T08:54:00.000Z	lexxy		yeah
2009-06-12T08:54:00.000Z	lexxy		I downloaded the Jaunty  distro but I keep havin trouble trying to use my wireless card
2009-06-12T08:54:00.000Z	lexxy		its a netgear WNDA3100
2009-06-12T08:55:00.000Z	lexxy		I was wondering if u have any suggestions as to accessing a driver
2009-06-12T08:56:00.000Z	lexxy		aparrently from my quick skim through google it is an atheros but I'm not exactly sure about the chipset
2009-06-12T08:57:00.000Z	lexxy		says a pan0
2009-06-12T08:58:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	use the command:  "sudo lspci"  --> you can use it to get more information on your wireless card :)
2009-06-12T09:04:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	System > Administration > Hardware drivers ?
2009-06-12T09:05:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	should be called ath5k, not askk5
2009-06-12T09:06:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	what's strange is that it doesn't get pulled in automatically
2009-06-12T09:07:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	System > Administration > Hardware drivers    ... have you checked there?
2009-06-12T09:11:00.000Z	lexxy	Dev_u_pper	there be no listin
2009-06-12T09:12:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	ath5k does not support the chipset in your card Netgear WNDA3100, as per ath5k current supported chipsets: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/ath5k#supported_chips
2009-06-12T09:12:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	there may be a better driver for it
2009-06-12T09:12:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	(though, this at least explains why the kernel chose not to load the ath5k... mostly because it wouldn't work :P)
2009-06-12T09:17:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	lexxy	good news!  They are adding support for this card in the upcoming linux kernel.  The sad part is that you will have to wait until the next version of ubuntu until your card is supported by the new kernel.  Until then, use ndiswrapper
