2011-03-25T01:52:00.000Z	lordjj		Can someone tell me how to mount a USB drive through terminal and copy files to it?
2011-03-25T01:52:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	man mount; man cp
2011-03-25T01:53:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	can you tell me pore specific commands
2011-03-25T01:54:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	I didn't know what to write after "mount"
2011-03-25T01:54:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	also what does a directory outside the filesystem look like?
2011-03-25T01:55:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /path/to/mount/point if it's FAT you need -o uid=username,gid=username,
2011-03-25T01:56:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	sdb1 is just as an example,  tail|dmesg will tell you what device you just connected
2011-03-25T01:57:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	what do you mean by: /path/to/mount/point
2011-03-25T01:57:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	it can be anything you want like /mnt or /home/lordjj/myusbstick
2011-03-25T01:58:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	there is no such thing as "outside the filesystem" in Linux everthing is mounted within the "/" root filesystem
2011-03-25T02:00:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	so after mounting, what will the directory to the USB drive look like?
2011-03-25T02:01:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	same as E:\ in windows but at /mnt/Lazy/
2011-03-25T02:03:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	can u write an example where you mount a USB drive and copy a folder from home to it?
2011-03-25T02:06:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	http://paste.ubuntu.com/585064/
2011-03-25T02:06:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	thanks :)
2011-03-25T02:09:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	OK so add a "-v" to the cp command and if you have special characters you might tell the mount command to use utf8, ask if you need details
2011-03-25T02:11:00.000Z	lordjj	dfh	if there are spaces in the folder names, I can use "" right?
2011-03-25T02:11:00.000Z	dfh	lordjj	correct, or single quotes or you escape with "\"
