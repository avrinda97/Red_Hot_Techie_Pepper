2010-10-04T13:20:00.000Z	sentmen	ilovefairuz	Sorry, i readed it not good
2010-10-04T13:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sentmen	what you do NOT assign a static ip, the nic gets a dynamic ip, what ip is that?
2010-10-04T13:23:00.000Z	sentmen	ilovefairuz	I don't get an ip
2010-10-04T13:25:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sentmen	so the network doesn't work (without a static ip) ?
