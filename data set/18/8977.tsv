2008-02-04T00:55:00.000Z	EdgeT	Phuz	anywhere
2008-02-04T00:55:00.000Z	EdgeT	Phuz	but Firefox's useless, same as updates
2008-02-04T00:55:00.000Z	EdgeT	Phuz	and I really don't get it, DNS's configured and stuff
2008-02-04T00:55:00.000Z	EdgeT	Phuz	yep, I can ping domain names
2008-02-04T00:56:00.000Z	Phuz	EdgeT	but you can't get HTTP traffic, hmm
