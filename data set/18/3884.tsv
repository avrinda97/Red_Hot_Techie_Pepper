2009-07-12T18:51:00.000Z	watson516		Would anyone be able to help me out with an Nvidia driver installation?
2009-07-12T18:51:00.000Z	arand	watson516	state the problem
2009-07-12T18:52:00.000Z	watson516	arand	Thanks. I have tried to use the Hardware Drivers tool in the system->admin but that doesn't work...doesn't error, just doesn't work
2009-07-12T18:53:00.000Z	watson516	arand	I tried to manually download a .run file from nvidia which I am just about positive is the correct one for me, stopped gdm and attempted installation...it worked but after restart it errored
2009-07-12T18:54:00.000Z	arand	watson516	what kinds or errors? Does /var/log/Xorg.0.log show anything related?
2009-07-12T18:55:00.000Z	watson516	arand	the Xorg.0.log file is roughly 200 lines long and I have no idea what any of it means
2009-07-12T18:56:00.000Z	watson516	arand	the error was something along the lines of the header module couldn't be found (nvidia created it I think...during installation)
2009-07-12T18:56:00.000Z	arand	watson516	look for messsages prepended by (EE) talking about nvidia.
2009-07-12T18:57:00.000Z	arand	watson516	cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE
2009-07-12T18:58:00.000Z	watson516	arand	(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)
2009-07-12T19:00:00.000Z	arand	watson516	ok, so the driver was not able to install correctly...
2009-07-12T19:01:00.000Z	arand	watson516	When installing manually from *.run do you get errors similar to the last section of this question: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-180/+question/59795
2009-07-12T19:03:00.000Z	watson516	arand	I got no errored during installation of the driver (except that it couldn't connect to the internet to download the header module...or something along those lines)
2009-07-12T19:04:00.000Z	arand	watson516	did it succed in compiling it by itself after that?
2009-07-12T19:04:00.000Z	watson516	arand	yes
2009-07-12T19:07:00.000Z	watson516	arand	I have installed it about a year ago on an older version of ubuntu with no troubles
2009-07-12T19:09:00.000Z	arand	watson516	What does "lspci | grep VGA" give you?
2009-07-12T19:10:00.000Z	watson516	arand	00:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C51 [Geforce 6150 Go] (rev a2)
