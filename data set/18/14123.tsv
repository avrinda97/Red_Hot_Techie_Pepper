2007-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Comrade-Sergei	er... what?  Download and burn it
2007-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Comrade-Sergei	that page will have a number of methods

2007-05-01T14:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Comrade-Sergei	What do you want to add?
2007-05-01T14:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Comrade-Sergei	beryl starts when you login, not when you boot up.  Or at least, that's how I understand it.  Ask in #ubuntu-effects, they know ebst
2007-05-01T14:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Comrade-Sergei	that's a different method (its user specific, isntead of your entire machine)
