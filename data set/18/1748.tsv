2010-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	mingdao		What is a relatively lightweight file browser with thumbnails for looking at 100 jpegs in a single directory?
2010-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	mingdao		NB: I have been using "feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 *"
2010-11-25T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	I was about to suggest feh... not sure what exactly you are looking for.  Maybe "pornview"?
2010-11-25T03:01:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	No, I don't look at photos of your sister.
2010-11-25T03:02:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	please don't do that.  Despite it's name, it's just an image viewing app.
2010-11-25T03:08:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	sorry ... still inappropriate name ... wouldn't install it and give someone the wrong idea ... few will do
2010-11-25T03:09:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	you might want to check it out and see if it's the app you are looking for.  If it is, you could always recompile it with a new name
2010-11-25T03:09:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	what 'upstream' do you work on?
2010-11-25T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	dead project :)
2010-11-25T03:11:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	I've used Slackware (and worked on the project) for some many years ... just a few days into an Ubuntu install, and can't even figure out grub :-)  .... don't know if it would be worth the time to figure out how to recompile a gui app atm
2010-11-25T03:11:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	yeah, I can relate to dead projects
2010-11-25T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	I don't know of other light weight image viewers.  Maybe gthumb?
2010-11-25T03:12:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	probably just stick with feh ... can't complain about it, and the thumbnail mode window fits perfectly here
2010-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	your wish is...
2010-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	?
2010-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	mingdao	he was k-lined
2010-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	missed it
2010-11-25T03:15:00.000Z	mingdao	jrib	see it now ...
