2006-04-09T06:15:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	good luck
2006-04-09T06:17:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	updating software is done with apt
2006-04-09T06:18:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	it's a requirement
2006-04-09T06:24:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	what do you need to do? basic stuff can be done without ever opening a terminal
2006-04-09T06:24:00.000Z	Omega_	mwe	I want maintaining my system to not feel like a month long cisco study.
2006-04-09T06:24:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	yes
2006-04-09T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	it does?
2006-04-09T06:26:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	or just use synaptic. most people do. it's gui
2006-04-09T06:27:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	I agree linux is not yet ready for my mom
2006-04-09T06:28:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	unless i help her a few days a week. but then again she hates it in the first place. She's in love with the imac
2006-04-09T06:30:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	you can do all basic stuff from the gui
2006-04-09T06:31:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	suse or mandrake or something maybe, then
2006-04-09T06:32:00.000Z	mwe	Omega_	I don't understand why you're using linux if you don't like it
