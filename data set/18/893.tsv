2011-08-05T10:23:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		action, any idea on what to do next after rescatux has failed
2011-08-05T10:23:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		no its 2 250gb hdd
2011-08-05T10:23:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		maxtor
2011-08-05T10:25:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		i didnt think it was possible for a system to fail this deep
2011-08-05T10:25:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		it seems like everything i have tried has failed miserably
2011-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		not sure if you saw previous chat but my grub has been impossible to restore
2011-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		i first got a grub error and attempted bootrepair and rescatux to restore but nothing worked
2011-08-05T10:28:00.000Z	csdserver	resc_user_2169	 what happens when you expect the grub screen?
2011-08-05T10:28:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		not the grub screen but when i boot from hdd after install i have a grub error
2011-08-05T10:29:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		and no restoration has worked
2011-08-05T10:32:00.000Z	resc_user_2169	csdserver	 any ideas at all?
2011-08-05T10:34:00.000Z	csdserver		what is the error exactly?  does it halt your system and give you any message?
2011-08-05T10:37:00.000Z	csdserver	resc_user_2169	you have access to the filesystem with your boot/grub/grub.cfg ?
2011-08-05T10:38:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		it is saying no such file or directory
2011-08-05T10:40:00.000Z	csdserver	resc_user_2169	 are you on your grub command line for the non-booting system?
2011-08-05T10:41:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		yes but right now i am booted off of the  rescatux live cd
2011-08-05T10:42:00.000Z	resc_user_2169		like i said, im new to this so it would make sense to live cd ubuntu as we speak?
2011-08-05T10:45:00.000Z	csdserver	resc_user_2169	i'm looking at what rescatux can do.  I've never used it before.  If you use a command line 'df -h' command, what is the output?
