2007-09-24T07:56:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Ownatik	try sudo grub-install /dev/sda1 (assuming sda1 is your ubuntu root partition)
2007-09-24T07:58:00.000Z	Ownatik	MasterShrek	, got the same message, even if I --recheck
2007-09-24T07:58:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Ownatik	try sudo cfdisk /dev/sda and make sure sda1 is your ubuntu partition
2007-09-24T07:59:00.000Z	Ownatik	MasterShrek	ok it<s sda4 :P
2007-09-24T08:00:00.000Z	Ownatik	MasterShrek	I still get it ...: ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sda4
2007-09-24T08:01:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Ownatik	try typing 'mount' to see if something is mounted at /boot
2007-09-24T08:02:00.000Z	Ownatik	MasterShrek	no nothing mounted as boot

2007-09-24T08:09:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Ownatik	are you sure sda4 isnt your swap partition? typing mount will show for sure whats mounted at /
