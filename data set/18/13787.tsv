2005-10-21T11:17:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	whats your problem?
2005-10-21T11:18:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	you might have to be more specific about the error
2005-10-21T11:20:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	I think I got tricked by that too.....you might find you can scroll down the screen further
2005-10-21T11:21:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	now your heading out of my level of knowledge :)
2005-10-21T11:23:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	what you are describing to me sounds exactly like a situation I thought I was in, but then discovered I was simply misunderstanding the choices
2005-10-21T11:23:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	I know you have to be quite careful with dual boot and XP/ntfs...
2005-10-21T11:24:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	I would be reading up on the forums about other peoples XP experiences before diving in
2005-10-21T11:25:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	I don't have much of clue about XP...never had it
2005-10-21T11:26:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	I know that I have read many threads of XP users seeking advice on restoring their system after mucking up the XP boot
2005-10-21T11:26:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	so I am very hesitant to comment
2005-10-21T11:27:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	more reading more questions...when you are sure then do it
2005-10-21T11:27:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	and backup your XP side
2005-10-21T11:28:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	you visited the ubuntu forums?
2005-10-21T11:29:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	try the customisation tips and tricks section
2005-10-21T11:29:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	you can do searches on the forum too
2005-10-21T13:11:00.000Z	mustard5	pullmyfin	yeah?
