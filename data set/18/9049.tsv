2007-05-16T14:01:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		crap if i could find a simple and powerful easy solution on linux the ni wouldnt even try to give him the anydvd/clonedvd windows apps
2007-05-16T14:02:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		khrajin I dont know what that is or means. l_ocke I need something very easy to use like 1 click straight copy taht wont get blocked by dvd protection. I mean he wants as brainless as possible. If you ever try anydvd/clonedvd combo youll see how easy it is.
2007-05-16T14:02:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		So if you or anyone has a good easy dvd coping solution in linux please let me know what app you use.
2007-05-16T14:02:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		l_ocke can I find the k3b in the add/remove program thing?
2007-05-16T14:03:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		l_ocke I'm curious I've noticed I can right click a cd in ubuntu and it has a copy option. Will that get the job done it self for dvds?

2007-05-16T14:04:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		l_ocke what is the difference from synatpic package manager and the add/remove programs one? i used add/remove programs to install all my plugins and wine and such.
2007-05-16T14:07:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		l_ocke i looked at k3bs description in add/remove and it says its for cd coping I'm not sure it does dvd coping.
