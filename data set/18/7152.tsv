2009-05-09T07:45:00.000Z	xGeek		Quick question: I'm running gidentd on my ubuntu 8.04 server (yes I haven't upgraded yet) and I would like for it to listen on only one of my IP addresses. The problem is that the gidentd.conf file says that it's just a place holder. Is there no way to change the default behaviour of gidentd and what IP it binds to?
2009-05-09T07:46:00.000Z	xGeek		Well I wouldn't say impossible... :)
2009-05-09T07:47:00.000Z	xGeek		Nobody has any experience with gidentd?
2009-05-09T07:48:00.000Z	xGeek		Thank Gnea. I already asked.
2009-05-09T07:49:00.000Z	xGeek		Anymore automated responses you'd like to send my way.
2009-05-09T07:49:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	no, you asked if anyone here has experience with gidentd - that's not a properly formed question - what is your issue with gidentd?
2009-05-09T07:50:00.000Z	xGeek	Gnea	I did. If you scrolled up you would see my question. My question is can I bind gidentd to a specific IP address since gidentd.conf says that it's just a place holder.
2009-05-09T07:50:00.000Z	xGeek	Gnea	...
2009-05-09T07:50:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	i'm not sure about that, it's been awhile since i installed it. hrm, i could possibly see..
2009-05-09T07:53:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	that's pretty odd, have you searched google at all? now you've got me interested...
2009-05-09T07:54:00.000Z	xGeek	Gnea	Yeah. It defaults to ipv6 (which is fine) and the gidentd.conf file clearly states (this is just a place holder). *shrug* I guess I could find a different identd program. I don't want anything serving on an IP that it's not needed on.
2009-05-09T07:55:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	yeah, just saw that... well, i tend to only run gidentd on servers, which is where i tend to place firewalls, so I would just tweak my firewall a bit
2009-05-09T07:55:00.000Z	xGeek	Gnea	I guess I could block it using iptables, but that seems like a bad hack.
2009-05-09T07:55:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	if it's a desktop, then i'd do the same there if i had multi-ips
2009-05-09T07:55:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	it is, but it gets the job done
2009-05-09T07:56:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	i would just deny access to * on port 113 and then open it up to just that ip
2009-05-09T07:56:00.000Z	xGeek	Gnea	Thanks man.
2009-05-09T07:56:00.000Z	Gnea	xGeek	cheers
