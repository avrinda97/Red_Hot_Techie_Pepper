2012-09-09T22:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	mutio: It's perfectly safe to install both OSs to the same drive.
2012-09-09T22:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	You've already "formatted" the drive, so you've lost both the original Windows install and the new Ubuntu install?
2012-09-09T22:35:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	Yes but I can reinstall them ofc
2012-09-09T22:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	Do you know if your firmware is UEFI?
2012-09-09T22:38:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	No i don?t know. Where can I display it?
2012-09-09T22:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	It would be somewhere in your motherboard's documentation, and there's probably a way to tell if Windows was installed via UEFI from within Windows but I don't know it.
2012-09-09T22:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	I would recommend simply installing Ubuntu again, using the guided partitioning rather than setting anything up manually, and come back here if you have problems booting Windows again and we'll get you fixed up.
2012-09-09T22:42:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	I did use the guided partitioning thats why Im confused what couldve gone wrong.
2012-09-09T22:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	It's hard to tell without being able to look at how things ended up after the install. If the same thing happens again, it should be pretty easy for me to figure out why and how to fix it.
2012-09-09T22:44:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	Alright thanks for helping, I will install Ubuntu now using the guided partitioning again and come back here if the problem persists.
2012-09-09T22:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	You're welcome.
2012-09-09T23:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	Can you run boot info script and pastebin the RESULTS.txt which it produces?
2012-09-09T23:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	I will be gone for a few minutes, but I *will* be back (though possibly from my phone where typing will be slow).
2012-09-09T23:49:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	ubottu I cant download the tool because I cant install ndiswrapper
2012-09-09T23:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	Can you connect via ethernet, or copy boot info script over via a USB drive?
2012-09-09T23:54:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	I appreciate your help with my boot problem but I would rather try to figure out why I cant install the ndiswrapper packages first
2012-09-09T23:55:00.000Z	Chris123	Jordan_U	Ill post RESULTS.txt as soon as I got my internet to work
2012-09-10T00:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chris123	OK. I will be in and out for the next few hours.
