2009-12-12T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ascavasaion	 or check out vnc and ssh tunnles.
2010-04-06T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ascavasaion	 a user can right click on a folder and set up 'user made shares' or you can just edit /etc/samba/smb.conf as needed
2010-04-06T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ascavasaion	 or use some of the samba front ends.
