2010-11-14T13:27:00.000Z	Iszak		So I have sound but the sound applet is a speaker with three dashes and I cannot control the audio slider known problem?
2010-11-14T13:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 it may set to controll the 'pcm' channel, or some other channel. instead of the proper master channel.
2010-11-14T13:28:00.000Z	Iszak	Dr_Willis	any fix?
2010-11-14T13:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 no idea. ive had a few pc's that ive had to tweak to use PCM instead of 'master' (or visa versa)   but not had to do that in ages.

2011-05-08T16:03:00.000Z	Iszak	Dr_Willis	it was definitely broken.

2011-05-08T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 answer is to switch to the classic desktop at GDM login
2011-05-08T16:14:00.000Z	Iszak	Dr_Willis	I want to remove the files too
2011-05-08T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 i would say use an older release then.
2011-05-08T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 its too embedded into differnt things..
2011-05-08T16:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 so go for it then..  fire up package manager and see.
2011-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	Iszak	Dr_Willis	could I not install ubuntu alternative then install gnome 2/3 without unity (hooray)
2011-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 11.04 comes with unity as its gnome...
2011-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Iszak	 the alternative cd - installs the normal desktop.. so yes it does.
