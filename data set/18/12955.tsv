2008-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	defrysk	zamba	you have an atheros model that doen not work in hardy , it does in intrepid tho
2008-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	zamba	defrysk	but how can ubuntu eee not support this?
2008-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	defrysk	zamba	so read the howto , its pretty straitforward

2008-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	zamba	defrysk	and the distro is called ubuntu eee..? that puzzles me

2008-09-29T15:36:00.000Z	zamba	defrysk	this makes no real sense
