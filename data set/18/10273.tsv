2008-04-26T13:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		I wanna see some install horror stories..lol, maybe we need a channel devoted to that
2008-04-26T13:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		not very smart.
2008-04-26T13:17:00.000Z	ferris_	IndyGunFreak	my install was horrible.... well, the install on two machines were flawless on 8.04, but the configuring the wireless took me about 20 minutes, after I pulled my head out of a dark place.... on the old pc, no problems at all.
2008-04-26T13:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ferris_	hmm, mine was fairly smooth on my PC and Laptop.... i set my wireless up the same way I did in gutsy(with a madwifi patch because my device gets misdetected).
2008-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		actually, i don't think i had any problems on either machine..lol
2008-04-26T13:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		i don't like Firefox's new download manager.. the old one was better(when doing multiple downloads)
2008-04-26T13:21:00.000Z	ferris_	IndyGunFreak	they were both smooth. I was impressed that it was the easiest installs ever. I have literally installed over 1000 times. From win95 to vista, BeOs, RH, GENTOO, Debian (many versions of it) but Ubuntu 8.04 was incredibly easy. I thought they did a particularly nice job on the manual partitioner
2008-04-26T13:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ferris_	i agree completely... i'm still curious why they put a beta version of FF in the final stable release, thats usually a no-no w/ Canonical
2008-04-26T13:23:00.000Z	ferris_	IndyGunFreak	yeah... i just installed the swiftfox and it is a much better version
2008-04-26T13:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ferris_	hmm, hadn't thought of swiftfox
2008-04-26T13:23:00.000Z	ferris_	IndyGunFreak	yeah... it is pretty quick
2008-04-26T13:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ferris_	is it still th beta, or based on 2.0.whatever was stable?
2008-04-26T13:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ferris_	and where did you get it, i don't see it in the repos, or does it need compiled?
2008-04-26T13:25:00.000Z	ferris_	IndyGunFreak	you can get it through spm, but you have to add the repos.
2008-04-26T13:25:00.000Z	ferris_		i can give you the repos in a sec
2008-04-26T13:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		ferret: spm?  got a link
2008-04-26T13:26:00.000Z	ferris_	IndyGunFreak	deb http://getswiftfox.com/builds/debian/branch unstable non-free
