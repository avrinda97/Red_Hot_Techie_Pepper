2006-01-09T10:45:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3		crap, i went through the entire process and I am not getting any new resolution showing up in gnome, despite having set them all up in the config... restarting now
2006-01-09T10:46:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3		Man, Ubuntu takes forever to startup...
2006-01-09T10:47:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3		colonelpanique: I am comparing Ubuntu to OS X on the *exact same hardware*
2006-01-09T10:49:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3		Hah! A reboot was what was needed! Why oh why can't small notes like this be added? Like "Log out to autodetect resolutions otherwise it will fail without giving you any useful errors" and "Now that you've finished reconfiguring X.org, please reboot"
2006-01-09T10:50:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	You don't need tor eboot after reconfigureing Xorg.
2006-01-09T10:50:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	cafuego	It didn't work out that way. I logged out, and logged back in, but the new resolutions could not be found until reboot.
2006-01-09T10:50:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	You forgot to restart X, which is a different issue.
2006-01-09T10:51:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	Loggoing out doesn't restart X.
2006-01-09T11:26:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	There's a limit to how much Linux can process raltively low-quality fonts.
2006-01-09T11:26:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	cafuego	Then I think I need to rip some fonts off my OS X machine, as it has no problems making any non-bitmap fonts look screamingly good.
2006-01-09T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	Even then, X isn't quite as advanced as Quartz (But you can certainly try, just dump the .dfont files in ~/.fonts)
2006-01-09T11:28:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	cafuego	I really would kill for better looking anti-aliasing about now.
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	cafuego	the stuff under Linux looks rather like bitmaps that have had a slight gaussian blur applied... just like Windows
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	Yes, that's a matter of font rendering engine.
2006-01-09T11:34:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	Why don't YOU write a antialiasing engine?
2006-01-09T11:38:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	have you been through /usr/share/doc/libfreetype6 yet?
2006-01-09T11:39:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	cafuego	I'm actually looking at stuff related to that now...
2006-01-10T15:41:00.000Z	cafuego	blueandwhiteg3	Not for blue&white G3's, no.
