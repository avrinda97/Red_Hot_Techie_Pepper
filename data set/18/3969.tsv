2009-06-25T19:44:00.000Z	daemoof		the dating/revisions of ubuntu..  what is their methodology..  was told there was oe?
2009-06-25T19:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 ubuntu 9.04 - relased on the 4th month of 2009
2009-06-25T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 ubuntu has to be one of the best/easiest disrtos to use - that ive seen. and ive seen a lot.
2009-06-25T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 learn how the system works.. all linux use 'mount' as the underlaying method to access files.
2009-06-25T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 ive missed your original problem,. fstab is for read  by the mount command and can define options for specific mount points/devices.. or you can do it all from the command line.
2009-06-25T19:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 theres 1000's of docs and guides and books on linux. start with the basics. work your way up.
2009-06-25T19:50:00.000Z	daemoof	Dr_Willis	 I have GParted open, want to wipe the drive on the other netbook I am trying to get ubuntu instaled on.  Currently have  a flasjhj drve mage of ubuntu easy peasy, (was told to get another, wll page upp in a sec for that info, though want to just use current img) I  want to wipe and install onto thiss drive that is inside this Acer aspireone but it is coming up /dev/sda1/ ad the ountpoint is /cdrom   hen i try to use the GUI
2009-06-25T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 you normally cant  do things to a hard drive it its being accessed. so be sure the disk is unmounted. I used the  Ubuntu netbook remix image  on a flash drive to install my AcerAspireOne.   I found Easypeasy lacking in ways.
2009-06-25T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daemoof	 if you want to whipe the hard drive - i normally boot a distro from a flash drive. and use gparted and just 'delete' all parittiosn.. or use the 'fdisk' command and delete them that way - if gparted is being a pain.  of course Most installers will also delete all the partiotions for you if you tell them to do so.
