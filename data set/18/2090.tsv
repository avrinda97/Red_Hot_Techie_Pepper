2010-08-20T15:42:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	do you have any imp data on xp partition?
2010-08-20T15:43:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	then why dont you just go go gparted, umnount xp and delte it and create new partitin there? or you can extend your current linux partition to that free space?
2010-08-20T15:43:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	you currently have both xp and ubuntu installed ? right?
2010-08-20T15:44:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	wait
2010-08-20T15:45:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	see this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=485514
2010-08-20T15:45:00.000Z	domfliss	abhijit	sudo echo "GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true" >> /etc/default/grub that was a command I was given
2010-08-20T15:45:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	as i guess you may only need to update grub or reinstall grub nothing else. its so simple just delete xp from gparted
2010-08-20T15:55:00.000Z	domfliss	abhijit	my mount point is in windows media on gparted.  If I remove it will I still be able to boot up?
2010-08-20T15:56:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	i am not sure. i dont konw. you ask someone else.
2010-08-20T15:56:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	have you seen the forum link i have given to you?
2010-08-20T16:02:00.000Z	abhijit	domfliss	just for you info that resizing a partition take a looooooooooot time depend on the size of the resizing partition.
