2012-10-10T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amos	I recommend you enable the partner repo and install the adobe-flashplugin package. If you are using Chrome (not Chromium) you don't even need any of the adobe flash plugins installed
2012-10-10T13:13:00.000Z	amos	ActionParsnip	how do i enable the partner repo ?
2012-10-10T13:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amos	youy can use software centre, or uncomment the lines in /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-10-13T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amos	is there a router between?
2012-10-13T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amos	if you are using a crossover cable then you will need to set IP addresses on the interfaces as there is no DHCP server
2012-10-13T16:46:00.000Z	amos	ActionParsnip	 how do i go about with the DNS servers and domains?
2012-10-13T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amos	you don't need it, you will be contactting the other system via IP
