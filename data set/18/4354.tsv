2009-05-07T12:13:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		Ok so... Sudo will not accept my root password but su will in the console.. i cant log in as root, and my user account mark is in the admin group but sido wont recognize it as an admin and requires the root password to modify the system but it rejects the password?
2009-05-07T12:13:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		And I thought Vista was messed up
2009-05-07T12:14:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		no sudo tells me that my admin account password is not able to modify system settings even though it is in the admin group
2009-05-07T12:14:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		I typed in the mark password, and sudo tells me this : Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root
2009-05-07T12:14:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		Mark is not root
2009-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		mark and root have very different passwords
2009-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		LOL all I am trying to do is install divx codex's to watch a video lol
2009-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		apparently it is not
2009-05-07T12:16:00.000Z	mib_jbrkpo82		i did adduser mark admin
