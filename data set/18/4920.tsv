2009-01-27T17:59:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Pici	I read somewhere that I should be avoiding ubuntu-restricted-extras.

2010-02-24T19:53:00.000Z	Pici	kinja-sheep	If you're looking for a specific package, you can either use packages.ubuntu.com, or aptitude changelog $packagename, or if you want to see changelogs for current updates, then install apt-listchanges.
2010-02-24T19:54:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Pici	Thanks! That looks promising.
