2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 fire up synaptic, and start cliking/installing
2006-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 this is called.. asking a question.. then replying with another statement after the first questionis answered.. you should of said that to begin with. :P
2006-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 you installing somthing from Source then?
2006-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 what are you trying to install exactly?
2006-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 rar and unrar are in the apt-get repositories.
2006-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 you may need to enable the other repositories in synaptic to find rar/unrar
2006-09-28T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 what files?
2006-09-28T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 you are doing this the hard way
2006-09-28T05:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 sudo  synaptic, search for rar, check the rar paclages mark them to be installed  and click applty
2006-09-28T05:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 they shoudl get auto-downloaded and installed
2006-09-28T05:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 then you need to update your  repositories - see how that says      In component multiverse,
2006-09-28T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 fire up synaptic and enable the multiverse and other repositories, then the other programs should be there.
2006-09-28T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kojima-Kazuma	 synaptic -> settings -> repositories   (logical eh?)
