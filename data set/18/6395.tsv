2008-09-01T08:18:00.000Z	geremy		is there a quick way to know what .deb in /var/cache/apt/archives corresponds to a given package?
2008-09-01T08:19:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	there are no .debs in that directory
2008-09-01T08:20:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	I believe there are, according to the online docs
2008-09-01T08:20:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	BS
2008-09-01T08:20:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	in the directory you named there isn't a single .deb
2008-09-01T08:20:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	I'm finding plenty, and the docs indicate they should be there.
2008-09-01T08:22:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	I am staring at it. are you running an older version, perhaps?
2008-09-01T08:22:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	or intrepid?
2008-09-01T08:22:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	ls -l /var/cache/apt
2008-09-01T08:22:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	I get the archives directory etc
2008-09-01T08:23:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	no debs
2008-09-01T08:23:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	yes. archives directory is NOT a .deb, is it? I told you already: /var/cache/apt != /var/cache/apt/archives/
2008-09-01T08:24:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	I'm sorry, but you're clearly not understanding. I am staring at this, and it is fact; I am staring at the online docs, and they appear correct. unop confirms. something is wrong on *your* end
2008-09-01T08:24:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	ls -l /var/cache/apt
2008-09-01T08:25:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	I have already done so, and confirmed the correct placements according to the docs
2008-09-01T08:25:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	which is under archives
2008-09-01T08:25:00.000Z	wols_	geremy	learn to READ
2008-09-01T08:26:00.000Z	geremy	wols_	Thank you for your courteous assistance. It won't be needed anymore.
