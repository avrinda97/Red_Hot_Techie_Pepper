2007-05-13T15:56:00.000Z	premier_		hello, a freind of mine screwed (like really messed up) his permissions.  according to ls -al, /home/him/.gnome2/ has full rwx permissions, but whenever he tries to boot gnome, he gets an error saying that something needs to edit .gnome2 and cannot get permissions.
2007-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	premier_		hello, I'm trying to play a media file with strange, ultra new windows codecs called h264... how do I install them?
2007-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	works in any of the media players
2007-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	premier_	Chilling_Silence	not for me
2007-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	you'll be prompted to install codecs
2007-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	what player? mplayer works? totem (gstreamer) needs plugins downloaded though
2007-05-13T05:16:00.000Z	premier_	Chilling_Silence	vlc, mplayer, kplayer, kaffine, xine
2007-05-13T05:16:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	if you've got mplayer from apt, it'll have support
2007-05-13T05:16:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	you sure its h.24?
2007-05-13T05:17:00.000Z	premier_	Chilling_Silence	apparently its a new version (version 2?)
2007-05-13T05:17:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	whats a new version? version of the codec? mplayer isnt at 2.X....
2007-05-13T05:17:00.000Z	premier_	Chilling_Silence	codecs
2007-05-13T05:18:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	nah mate....
2007-05-13T05:18:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	play it from terminal with mplayer, see what it says, /msg me
2007-05-13T05:20:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	thats not h.264
2007-05-13T05:20:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	you need win32codecs for mplayer or the bad-plugins for gstreamer
2007-05-13T05:24:00.000Z	Chilling_Silence	premier_	that work?
2007-05-13T05:39:00.000Z	premier_	Chilling_Silence	you still there?  I installed something called avifile-win32-plugin from the repos, that didn't work
