2008-03-22T03:00:00.000Z	flush	icanhasadmin	no its an usb key
2008-03-22T03:03:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	flush	the only way i know of fixing that is to mkfs, which will delete info on the drive. so if you want to make it up on your harddrive, "mkfs.vfat -F 16 -n NewDriveName /dev/sdb1(or current location)" should fix
2008-03-22T03:03:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	flush	but again back up info on the flash drive first
