2006-05-22T13:54:00.000Z	Atomizeus		has anyone tried setting up a dhcpd on ubuntu?
2006-05-22T13:54:00.000Z	drumline	Atomizeus	having trouble?
2006-05-22T13:54:00.000Z	Atomizeus	drumline	I am now yeah
2006-05-22T13:54:00.000Z	Atomizeus		it used to work fine
2006-05-22T13:54:00.000Z	Atomizeus		but since the latest re-install it refuses to start
2006-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	Atomizeus		says something about adding the network segment for it...
2006-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	Atomizeus		which is weird
2006-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	Atomizeus		server ip is: 157.215.43.79 (Blame my boyfriend for the strange IP :P)
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	drumline	Atomizeus	i suppose that address is one of those test ranges..
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	Atomizeus		the config is set to use 157.215.43.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 range: 157.215.43.85 157.215.43.250
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	Atomizeus	drumline	eek :S
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	Atomizeus		so I'll just have to play with the netmask, range, etc?
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	drumline	Atomizeus	checking my config
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	Atomizeus		its weird that first time I created a config it worked fine, but the latest install doesn't :S
2006-05-22T13:58:00.000Z	drumline	Atomizeus	dapper?
2006-05-22T13:58:00.000Z	Atomizeus	drumline	nope, breezy
2006-05-22T13:59:00.000Z	Atomizeus		keeping everything stable for this network (once its up, I'll use a similar network structure for my work systems)
2006-05-22T13:59:00.000Z	drumline	Atomizeus	so you upgraded the dhcpd package and then it went buggy?
