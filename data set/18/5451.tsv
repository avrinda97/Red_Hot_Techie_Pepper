2008-10-21T22:10:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN		Hi all. I have an ISO file I want to burn using the Live CD, however when I try to eject the Live CD, I can't. I right click on the drive and go to Eject but it tells me there's probably no media...
2008-10-21T22:11:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN		I've tried eject /dev/cdrom which does work, however inserting a blank doesn't detect so I can't proceed
2008-10-21T22:11:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	You can't eject the LiveCD while using it to run the system.
2008-10-21T22:11:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN	jadedoto	oh. So is there anything I can do to get this ISO burned?
2008-10-21T22:12:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	Burn it with the host OS you have running, or if you are booted into the LiveCD and trying to burn the ISO there, use a different drive than you have the LiveCD in
2008-10-21T22:13:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN	jadedoto	The host OS is fried. The ISO is a backup of all of the data that I need. The system is a laptop with only one burner... so I guess that means I can't do anything, right?
2008-10-21T22:13:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	Use the liveCD to make a liveUSB image
2008-10-21T22:14:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN	jadedoto	No USB drive. Just a laptop and a live CD right now ;)
2008-10-21T22:14:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	If your laptop can boot off of a usb drive, then you can boot off of the usb drive and use the cd drive to burn
2008-10-21T22:15:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	What is the host OS you are trying to fix?
2008-10-21T22:15:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN	jadedoto	Windows XP. I think a virus took out the system files. I've tried everything (recovery CDs, live Windows CDs, etc), but nothing, so I've decided to start from scratch.
2008-10-21T22:16:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	What exactly are you trying to do? You can just reinstall windows from the install CD.
2008-10-21T22:17:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	Alternatively, you could actually instal Ubuntu on the laptop, and in the installer, tell it to use the free space on the windows partition. It will create a small area and install ubuntu on that
2008-10-21T22:17:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN	jadedoto	I have a lot of work I need to backup, and Windows no longer boots, hence why I was hoping I could use the Ubuntu live CD to back them up first, then reinstall Windows.
2008-10-21T22:17:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	and then  you can boot into that install and burn whatever data you need
2008-10-21T22:17:00.000Z	ThisIsMeAndN	jadedoto	I had no idea you could do that! That sounds like exactly what I need
2008-10-21T22:17:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	That will keep your windows files, just use the free space on the drive to make a small install of ubuntu
2008-10-21T22:23:00.000Z	jadedoto	ThisIsMeAndN	You're welcome!
