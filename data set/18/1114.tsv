2012-07-16T13:54:00.000Z	BrixSat		hello, i have alsa in my systen and not the pulse audio. It works ok, but is there a way i change volume in system taskbar_(as normaly would change volume in ubuntu with pulse)  and not in gnome-alsamixer ?
2012-07-16T13:55:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	out of curiousity, why are you using alsa?
2012-07-16T13:56:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 i need rivendell audio and it only works with alsa!
2012-07-16T13:56:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	you're using Rivendell?  Awesome.  What for exactly?
2012-07-16T13:56:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 radio show every evening at 12pm :)
2012-07-16T13:57:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	cool.  We've been thinking at deploying it at the radio station I volunteer at.  How are you liking it?
2012-07-16T13:58:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 its cool, kind of dificult to start of... but its easy to insert audio, and prepare the audio, you just need a lot of extra space cause it converts all for wav
2012-07-16T13:58:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 the only thing i havent been able to do is automated playout
2012-07-16T13:59:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	I need to get a test setup going so I can try it out myself, but where oh where will I find the time. :)
2012-07-16T13:59:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 will the radio have a lot of shows?
2012-07-16T14:02:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 you can also use for a more automated version airtime from sourcefabric
2012-07-16T14:06:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	was afk for a bit... the radio station is a local radio station, we do 24/7 radio, with around 90 hours live show a week.
2012-07-16T14:07:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	looks like airtime is more for one radio show, not for an entire station.
2012-07-16T14:08:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 airtime is more for the "autodj" and dj's would stream from home to there. Not good for fm radio station
2012-07-16T14:08:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 airtime is ideal for webradios where everybody broadcasts from home
2012-07-16T14:09:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	BrixSat	will Rivendell be able to carry a whole station though?
2012-07-16T14:09:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 rivendell could andle 2 or 3 radio stations if done right!
2012-07-16T14:11:00.000Z	BrixSat	Hyperbyte	 if you seperate the things like rivendell-server in a server machine and rivendell in a couple of pc's each of these pc's can use audio from server and be a diferent radio
