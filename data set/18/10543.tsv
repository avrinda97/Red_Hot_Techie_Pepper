2007-04-09T07:25:00.000Z	andys		Can someone send me an initramfs for 2.6.17-11-386 ?
2007-04-09T07:26:00.000Z	andys		My initramfs-tools is corrupt.
2007-04-09T07:27:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	try 'apt-get clean && apt-get install --reinstall initramfs-tools'
2007-04-09T07:27:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	then repeat whatever it was you were trying to do that needed an initramfs rebuild
2007-04-09T07:28:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	apt-get clean purges all cached .deb packages from your system
2007-04-09T07:29:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	means on the (very remote) chance that one of the downloaded packages is corrupt, it'll force a redownload
2007-04-09T07:29:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	how did you manage to corrupt it
2007-04-09T07:29:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	?
2007-04-09T07:32:00.000Z	andys	Eagleray	I cannot use my debian package tools as 1 install script needs to be completed first.  The only way I can fix that is by running letting the script run update-initramfs-tools.  I cant do that because my initramfs-tools is corrupt.  Long loop of problems <_<
2007-04-09T07:32:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	why can't you force it to install anyway and ignore any issues?
2007-04-09T07:34:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	leave the current problem in a half-installed state
2007-04-09T07:34:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	and fix initramfs-tools
2007-04-09T07:34:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	then once you've fixed initramfs-tools, fix the problem
2007-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	I can't remember the command to force it, but it is there
2007-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	try man apt-get and man dpkg
2007-04-09T08:11:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	excellent :D
2007-04-09T08:13:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	kingcobra, numan, foutrelis: It's 2:12am here and I'm seriously tired, so I'm going to bed. Good luck solving your issues.
2007-04-09T08:13:00.000Z	Eagleray	andys	no worries, good luck
