2005-10-28T15:29:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	before "apt-get dist-upgrade" you should type "sudp apt-get update"
2005-10-28T15:39:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	using universe and multiverse allows you much more fun (many more programs available)
2005-10-28T15:42:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	it means you get the same warranty as everyone else
2005-10-28T15:55:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	it depends on your current installation
2005-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	find the button marked 'search'
2005-11-02T16:51:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	use the livecd to do your gparted work
2005-11-02T16:51:00.000Z	jonny	nalioth	I only have the warty live cd does that include gparted?
2005-11-02T16:52:00.000Z	nalioth	jonny	if it does not, you can apt-get it
