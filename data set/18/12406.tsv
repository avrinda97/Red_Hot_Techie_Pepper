2006-06-17T11:32:00.000Z	keleus		i wish someone would patch windows! at least give us the option MS!!!
2006-06-17T11:34:00.000Z	keleus		doesnt matter
2006-06-17T11:34:00.000Z	keleus		i had a geforce2 MX
2006-06-17T11:34:00.000Z	keleus		and the nvidia-glx worked fine
2006-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	keleus		no
2006-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	keleus		nvidia legacy is for the TNTs i believe
2006-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	keleus	no
2006-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	keleus	hatake_kakashi	i had a geforce2 MX. thats LESS than the GTS Pro he has
2006-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	keleus	Geforce2 MX/MX 400 requires legacy :p
2006-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	keleus	hatake_kakashi	then explain how it used to work?
2006-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	keleus	hatake_kakashi	less than 8 months ago? (at which point i lost the machien for various reasons)
2006-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	keleus	I tried the normal glx and it failed to boot x properly, when I switched to legacy it worked
2006-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	keleus	hatake_kakashi	did nvidia fork the drivers?
2006-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	keleus	beats me, it was when I had to get the propriatory drivers, I had to make sure that I get the right one or x goes ballistic
2006-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	keleus	the nvidia site has a list of which cards needs to get legacy drivers
2006-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	keleus	hatake_kakashi	they probably forked it...
2006-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	keleus	beats me, when I grabbed the drivers, I saw for linux, there was two parts on nvidia, one is the legacy and the other, not
2006-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	keleus	hatake_kakashi	ah! thats definatly new to me
