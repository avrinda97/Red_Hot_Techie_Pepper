2009-10-15T13:44:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	Is the resolution all right in the GUI?
2009-10-15T13:44:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	Nvidia I think
2009-10-15T13:45:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	what do you get?
2009-10-15T13:48:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	strange indeed. what graphic driver did you install? how did you install it?
2009-10-15T13:48:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	I installed a ATI graphics driver proposed by the HW manager
2009-10-15T13:49:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	HW manager, you mean System --> Administration --> Hardware Drivers?
2009-10-15T13:49:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	jeppz
2009-10-15T13:51:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	okay, is the resolution pretty in the GUI?
2009-10-15T13:52:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	sry it is a ATI card I checked with another computer right now, I never get past the bootup splash so I don't now
2009-10-15T13:53:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	all right, access the grub menu (press ESC to access the grub menu), the choose recovery mode
2009-10-15T13:55:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	booted up and ready to go :)
2009-10-15T13:56:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	look for the xfix option. Choose that. It will automatically configure your xorg.conf (GUI configuration file) to the failsafe version
2009-10-15T13:57:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	and then choose resume ? I actually tried this earlier, no sucess
2009-10-15T13:59:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	oh.. XD. I think I'm at a brick wall. I've had experience with Nvidia. Just tried to help, it could be related..
2009-10-15T14:01:00.000Z	jontore	mo0nykit	Thank you anyway, the quickest solution is to reinstall the Os you think
2009-10-15T14:02:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	np :) yeah that's the quickest one :P
2009-10-15T14:02:00.000Z	mo0nykit	jontore	some advice: After a fresh install AND update, look at System --> Administration --> Hardware Drivers. That's the first place to go :)
