2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	its not dumb, its legal restrictions
2007-04-29T07:47:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	no you just need to install the right codecs
2007-04-29T07:48:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	codecs are not the issue here, the problem Im finding are all the libs that work with video tools have had aac and xvid disabled in edgy, is this fixed in feisty
2007-04-29T07:49:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	oh, not sure, perhaps for things in main due to license restrictions
2007-04-29T07:49:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	so basically Feisty is usless if you have a 5G iPOD
2007-04-29T07:50:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	well, for a start i would say it is useless :p but I dont know, try searching the forums there should be instruction on how to get it working

2007-04-29T07:51:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	aah so a "normal user" (yes Ive read the forums) has to spend 4 hours debugging, compiling. linking swapping libs to get his their ipod working, ffs, yeah I can see people rushing to use Ubuntu
2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	yes within the USA but outside they dont exist
2007-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	aaah yeah, so if a newbie cant use your "newbie friendly distro" (total rubbish) then go use Windows
2007-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	er what?
2007-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	I didnt say that
2007-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	ipod support should be better, I dont disagree
2007-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	a newbie will never get half the stuff to work in Ubuntu, because there is so much disabled in the libs (Im amazed how much is actually disabled) that it a barely functional rig for multi media
2007-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	its not perfect, however, this isnt the forum to have a debate over that
2007-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	try #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	mc44	Linux_Galore	file a bug if you want it fixed
2007-04-29T08:11:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	mc44	they know about it
