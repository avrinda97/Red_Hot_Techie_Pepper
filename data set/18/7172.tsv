2010-09-17T23:05:00.000Z	wessel		something with essentials
2010-09-17T23:05:00.000Z	wessel		It needs to be Java Development Kid x64
2010-09-17T23:06:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	  did you enable the partner repositories?
2010-09-17T23:06:00.000Z	wessel	coz_	I just did an install :o
2010-09-17T23:06:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 ok open  system/aministration/synaptic package manager
2010-09-17T23:07:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 that is fixable
2010-09-17T23:07:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 open synaptic
2010-09-17T23:07:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 when synaptic is opened  click "Settings  / Repositories"
2010-09-17T23:08:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 go to the "Other software"  tab  and tick both partner repositories
2010-09-17T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 close that  Reload... first   hit "Search"  then type in icedtead.... mark ALL of the ones listed as installed   to "REMOVE COMPLETELY"
2010-09-17T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	  then hit Search again  and type   sun java   scroll down for the sun-java6  packages
2010-09-17T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	  tick the ones you want  including the sun-java6-plugin
2010-09-17T23:10:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	  did you check all of that I just posted?
2010-09-17T23:10:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	  ok and did the sun java6  packages show up in the list?
2010-09-17T23:11:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	  that is going to be dependent on if the applications and needs you have work with icedtea....they dont here  so I never use icedtea  because most of the java application I have or my clients have require sun java
2010-11-11T21:41:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 there are alternatives  Pinta  comes to mind...also imagemagick
2010-11-11T21:42:00.000Z	coz_	wessel	 Pinta  is simple enough but has default plugins ...not too dissimilar to a low end photoshop
