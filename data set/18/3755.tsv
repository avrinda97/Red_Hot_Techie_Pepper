2009-08-06T20:50:00.000Z	Brazz		Hi there everyone
2009-08-06T20:50:00.000Z	Brazz		yesterday I followed the steps of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver and indeed my graphics got much better
2009-08-06T20:50:00.000Z	Brazz		although after that I tryed to run world of warcraft
2009-08-06T20:51:00.000Z	Brazz		and the graphics were pretty bad
2009-08-06T20:51:00.000Z	trayzz	Brazz	I have the same problems with my HD2600
2009-08-06T20:52:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	well then we need a solution =p
2009-08-06T20:52:00.000Z	trayzz	Brazz	Are you using the HD driver?
2009-08-06T20:53:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	my video card is Radeon Mobility 9000
2009-08-06T20:54:00.000Z	trayzz	Brazz	i use xserver-xorg-video-radeonhd, there's apparently a debug file but's a little more complicated then i thought
2009-08-06T20:55:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	until yesterday  I could not have "destop Effects" in a high mode and still run youtube... that was fixed, now
2009-08-06T20:56:00.000Z	trayzz	Brazz	it took me a while to make mine run, still not all of the compiz effects work
2009-08-06T20:56:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	I use ubuntu 9.04
2009-08-06T20:59:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	what's ubuntu tweak pal?
2009-08-06T21:01:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	have you got your radeon drivers installed anyway?
2009-08-06T21:02:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	you dont have a clue of how much I have been asking google now-a-days haha, just today when I was trying to search for something google replyed: "get off!"
2009-08-06T21:03:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	everytime I was following some other guides or advises, after a reboot my ubuntu would freeze at the logging screen, but with some really weird graphics
2009-08-06T21:04:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	even tho this time it worked I still dont wanna enable the catalyst driver before I talk to someone to make sure I won't have to install ubuntu once again for the 10th time
2009-08-06T21:08:00.000Z	Brazz	trayzz	thanks mate
