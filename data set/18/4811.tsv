2009-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	gafir		Hi, is anybody familiar with Inkscape on Ubuntu: It appears I cannot use any of the raster effects - even though I try uninstalling and reinstalling Inkscape using Synaptic Manager - Any idea why I can't use Blur effects, colorize effects, etc? Thanks for your help
2009-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	hang.. let me try.. see if it work for me
2009-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	thanks
2009-02-04T19:58:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	If I try to blur a shape or colorize a shape, nothing happens, I get the dialog box, but no effect
2009-02-04T19:58:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	I don't think it ever worked on my machine.
2009-02-04T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	have you checked the status bar text when you select a tool from the raster set?
2009-02-04T20:01:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	at the bottom, you mean?
2009-02-04T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	yes
2009-02-04T20:02:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	well I try blur, it says : "Path" (9 nodes) in layer glossy.
2009-02-04T20:02:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	I have my shape selected
2009-02-04T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	no, before that.. when you just hoover above the blur option
2009-02-04T20:03:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	it says "Blur selected bitmaps".. do you have any bitmaps selected?
2009-02-04T20:03:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	well it's a shape, so I guess it's not a bitmap, sorry not very familiar with this
2009-02-04T20:03:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	I guess I have to convert the shape into a bitmap
2009-02-04T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	I guess those filters only work on bitmap objects.. not the general vector objects you play around with in inkscape
2009-02-04T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	yes, I think so too
2009-02-04T20:04:00.000Z	gafir	Slart	Ok, I'll try to find how to convert the shape into a bitmap, and then maybe it will work, thanks for your help Slart, I couldn't see the message in my status bar well because the drop down menu was hidnig it on my screen
2009-02-04T20:05:00.000Z	Slart	gafir	you're welcome
