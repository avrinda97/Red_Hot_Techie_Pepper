2005-11-17T08:06:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	ah ok...so a 686 kernel is what he is after then?

2005-12-06T08:04:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	have you edited it already?
2005-12-06T08:04:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	mustard5	Well, its kinda already messed up :-P
2005-12-06T08:05:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	mustard5	yeah.. it says somthing about some GLX thingey failing to load
2005-12-06T08:05:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	I would look in the comments at the top of the xorg.conf file and run the command it shows in there
2005-12-06T08:05:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	that should autodetect everything again
2005-12-06T08:06:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	mustard5	The ATI driver wiped out those comments.
2005-12-06T08:06:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	k let me look it up...
2005-12-06T08:07:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	k
2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	your in root already too, so sudo is not really required
2005-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	normally it would be being done from a user login prompt
2005-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	mustard5	Did it work?
2005-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	yeah..you should have a new xorg.conf now
2005-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	mustard5	Biscuitian_Warhe	check it out to confirm
