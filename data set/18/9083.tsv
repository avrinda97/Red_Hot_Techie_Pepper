2007-05-20T10:34:00.000Z	OlliK		Hi, all!
2007-05-20T10:35:00.000Z	OlliK		I have a small problem. I installed this ejabberd jabber-server a while ago, now I'm not using it and the service is not on autostart. However, whenever I try to shut down / restart the computer it jams when it is "shutting down jabber server ejabberd", and only way to turn off PC is to force it of by power button
2007-05-20T10:36:00.000Z	OlliK		I wanted to get rid of this ejabberd since I'm not even using it, so I tried to sudo apt-get remove it, but when I try to remove it starts to shut down the server and jams there
2007-05-20T10:36:00.000Z	OlliK		So I seem to have no way to uninstall / get rid of it, any suggestions?
2007-05-20T10:36:00.000Z	digital_k	OlliK	in terminal, do a : sudo apt-get -f install
2007-05-20T10:37:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	what does the -f do ?
2007-05-20T10:37:00.000Z	digital_k	OlliK	you can also search for it in synaptic and remove it that way.
2007-05-20T10:40:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	ok I typed sudo apt-get -f install, and it stops there, this is what it says in the end:
2007-05-20T10:41:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	the sudo apt-get install -f is still in process, it is trying to start ejabbed server
2007-05-20T10:41:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	can I just ctrl+c it?
2007-05-20T10:43:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	ok it went forward automatically now, this is what it said:
2007-05-20T10:44:00.000Z	digital_k	OlliK	hmmm something is definitely getting crossed.
2007-05-20T10:44:00.000Z	digital_k	OlliK	search for it in synaptic, and see if it shows as installed there, and completely remove it.
2007-05-20T10:45:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	I'm guessing that synaptic is a packange manager for ubuntu? In my case (kubuntu), I'll start Adept Manager, I'll try to remove it from there
2007-05-20T10:49:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	It seems to do exactly same as what it did when I tried to remove it with apt-get, it jams in the process, Adept has now been trying to remove it for 5 minutes
2007-05-20T10:49:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	in apt-get it jammed while saying "shutting down jabber server, ejabberd"
2007-05-20T10:49:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	Although I didn't have it started
2007-05-20T10:52:00.000Z	OlliK	digital_k	Adept seems to have crashed.. it doesn't respond anymore, removing ejabberd 50%
