2009-01-17T17:47:00.000Z	bthompson		hey guys how can i make sure that i see ntfs volumes from programs...for instance when i use amarok i can't see my ntfs volumes where my music is stored...
2009-01-17T17:48:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	are they mounted?
2009-01-17T17:48:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	i guess open office is fine amarok only looks at /
2009-01-17T17:49:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	it should be in /media
2009-01-17T17:50:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	thats my problem possibly..give me a sec..
2009-01-17T17:51:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	that is my problem...
2009-01-17T17:53:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	ubuntu mounts stuff in /media by default, but shows it in the 'Computer' location. However, some apps don't know about this so you have to point them directly to /media
2009-01-17T17:56:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	next question...i have 3 160 gb drives...i just came from a windows world...so bare with me...i completely wiped out windows an am loving ubuntu by the way...i want to convert the other 2 drives that are ntfs...to linux....im used to just formating the whole things ntfs and make folders and saving data on those drives..do i just do the same thing with ubuntu and format them and create ext3..
2009-01-17T17:56:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	yep, although Ubuntu can read ntfs too
2009-01-17T17:58:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	so is there even a need to do that?  I guess what would be the benefit of me moving on that data around so i could get to ext3 on all my drives..
2009-01-17T17:58:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	you only need to use a linux filesystem if you want to put linux on it
2009-01-17T17:59:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	unless you want the benefits of ext3...
2009-01-17T17:59:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	ok thats cool..i guess it would be go to leave the one drive ntfs as it is a portable drive that i often take to a friends house...he wouldn't be able to read it...
2009-01-17T17:59:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	what would be the benefits...
2009-01-17T18:01:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	no need to defrag, journaling support (less likely to become corrupted), quieter
2009-01-17T18:02:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	well that sounds like a lot better option to me then...is there anyway for a user to read ext3 in windows...maybe if i put an app on the portable drive that they have to install...
2009-01-17T18:05:00.000Z	emorris	bthompson	Ext2Fsd, but I think it must be installed rather than run from the disk. If you still need Windows to access it on a regular basis, you may as well stay with NTFS though.
2009-01-17T18:06:00.000Z	bthompson	emorris	its not a regular basis...maybe 2 times a year..i have taken it to a friends how to copy movies on to or whatever...
