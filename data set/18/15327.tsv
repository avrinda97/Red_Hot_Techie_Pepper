2005-08-09T12:44:00.000Z	sataere		Can anyone help me?  I'm very desperately in need...my wireless card (linksys) is based on the atheros chipset, and uses the madwifi drivers.  I've used these drivers under other distributions with no problem, and under Ubuntu they look as though they are working (the card lights up and goes through the proper series of flashes), but although it says it's connected and activated, I can't actually connect to the net!!!
2005-08-09T12:45:00.000Z	sataere		My AP even logs my MAC address as having connected but I still can't get online!!!!
2005-08-09T12:46:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sataere	and you have SSID/WEP key set correctly in network-admin?
2005-08-09T12:47:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sataere	you sure you're not using MAC address filtering on the AP?>
2005-08-09T12:47:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	Yes.  I have checked checked and rechecked.  I use the exact same settings for my g/fs cisco card, and it works fine.
2005-08-09T12:55:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	Okay, I set up my AP to give me a static IP, and it still won't work.
2005-08-09T12:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sataere	and you don't have any ACL or MAC Address filtering?
2005-08-09T12:56:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	I also copied and pasted the WEP key from the AP config to my card config
2005-08-09T12:56:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	I will triple check
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	No MAC filtering, I don't think my AP even supports ACL filtering.
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sataere	MAC filtering = ACL (Access Control List)
2005-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	Ah.  Then no, absolutely no filtering.
2005-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	I have triple checked.
2005-08-09T12:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sataere	do you have SSID broadcast enabled or disabled?
2005-08-09T12:59:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	enabled
2005-08-09T12:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sataere	disable WEP and try again- also SSID's are case sensitive...this is just to test
2005-08-09T13:00:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	testing now
2005-08-09T13:00:00.000Z	sataere	jasoncohen	brb
