2011-05-28T18:51:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	is it a Seagate harddrive?
2011-05-28T18:51:00.000Z	no_idea	hmuller	yes...
2011-05-28T18:51:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	it spins but is not recognized?
2011-05-28T18:52:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	you have the same problem I have with one of my disks, google "seagate bsy bug"
2011-05-28T18:52:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	There is a fix for the problem, but you have to build a special cable
2011-05-28T18:53:00.000Z	no_idea	hmuller	special? how special?
2011-05-28T18:54:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	you have to order stuff off the internet and have soldering skills and small torx screwdrivers
2011-05-28T18:55:00.000Z	no_idea	hmuller	cant just re-case the drive?
2011-05-28T18:55:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	no, the bug is in the firmware on the drive.  replacing the card on the drive will not work either.
2011-05-28T18:56:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	I have all the parts but still have to build the cable. So I haven't done the fix yet but I expect it will work
2011-05-28T18:58:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	my seagate drive was in a maxtor central access fileserver
2011-05-28T18:58:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	I thought the device died, but it was the seagate drive
2011-05-28T19:09:00.000Z	no_idea	hmuller	its not showing up under mint or windows either
2011-05-28T19:10:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	I know, I tested my drive under other OSs as well. It's the Seagate BSY bug.
2011-05-28T19:13:00.000Z	no_idea	hmuller	did you revert the firmware?
2011-05-28T19:13:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	not yet, I am building the cable Sunday and will apply the fix then
2011-05-28T19:14:00.000Z	no_idea	hmuller	keep me posted?
2011-05-28T19:16:00.000Z	hmuller	no_idea	Sure, check back here this time Sunday and I'll let you know how it went
