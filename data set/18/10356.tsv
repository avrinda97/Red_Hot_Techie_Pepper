2006-12-18T08:02:00.000Z	floris84		I'm trying to get a touchscreen module to load but It doesn't work
2006-12-18T08:02:00.000Z	floris84		does anyone know where to put the driver file?
2006-12-18T08:03:00.000Z	floris84		I had set it in /usr/X11R6/Lib/Modules/Input
2006-12-18T08:04:00.000Z	floris84		it's a serial touchscreen it doesn't show up
2006-12-18T08:05:00.000Z	floris84		I can see it's output but Xorg doesn't load the driver
2006-12-18T08:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	floris84	insmod blah.ko
2006-12-18T08:06:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	It's an Xorg driver not a kernel driver, does it still show up in lsmod then?
2006-12-18T08:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	floris84	not sure
2006-12-18T08:08:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	do you know where to put an xorg input driver?
2006-12-18T08:09:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	i've tried all of the locations but it won't load strangely enough
2006-12-18T08:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	floris84	checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2006-12-18T08:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	floris84	somewhere under /usr/lib/xorg/modules from the looks of things
2006-12-18T08:13:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	nope It still keeps complaining about not finding the driver
2006-12-18T08:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	floris84	are you sure you have a compatible driver ?
2006-12-18T08:14:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	well, it's compiled for xfree could the error be that i'm running Xorg?
2006-12-18T08:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	floris84	more than likely
2006-12-18T08:17:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	well maybe I need to compile it for xorg then
2006-12-18T08:17:00.000Z	floris84	frogzoo	I'll look into compiling xorg thanks for the help!
