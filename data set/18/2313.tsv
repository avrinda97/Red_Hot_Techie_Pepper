2010-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	so how can he fix this?
2010-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	edbian	mmomjian	The extended partition is a the container for logical partitions.  Primary partitions cannot reside inside an extended partition
2010-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	He's trying to shift around the partition sizes
2010-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	he's in a live cd
2010-06-19T05:48:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	the issue is the extended partitions appears to be locked for some reason
2010-06-19T05:49:00.000Z	edbian	mmomjian	inaety is the swap on? It mounts any swap partitions found automatically

2010-06-19T05:55:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	He'll probably fill that in once he scales ext4 up
2010-06-19T06:01:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	good catch on the swap
2010-06-19T06:02:00.000Z	edbian	mmomjian	O thanks :P
2010-06-19T06:02:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	I would do that if I didn't have 150GB of games... :P
2010-06-19T06:02:00.000Z	edbian	mmomjian	:)

2010-06-19T06:08:00.000Z	mmomjian	edbian	I think he meant like single commands, not recompiling your own stuff, etc
2010-06-19T06:08:00.000Z	edbian	mmomjian	ah
