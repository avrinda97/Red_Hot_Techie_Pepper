2009-08-24T17:56:00.000Z	darklight84		Greetings. I need to get the package libgnome-2.0 for Ubuntu Hardy.
2009-08-24T17:56:00.000Z	darklight84		I'm trying to build the latest version of GnoTime and I am getting this error when I run .configure
2009-08-24T17:56:00.000Z	darklight84		checking for LIBGNOME... configure: error: Package requirements (libgnome-2.0 >= 2.0.0) were not met
2009-08-24T17:56:00.000Z	darklight84		can anyone help me?
2009-08-24T17:58:00.000Z	Stormx2`	darklight84	gnotime is in the repositories - why are you compiling?
2009-08-24T17:58:00.000Z	darklight84	Stormx2`	because I wanted the latest version. the version in the repository is a few versions old
2009-08-24T17:59:00.000Z	Stormx2`	darklight84	Run this, then: sudo apt-get build-dep gnutime
2009-08-24T17:59:00.000Z	Stormx2`	darklight84	then try compiling.
2009-08-24T17:59:00.000Z	darklight84		okay
2009-08-24T18:02:00.000Z	darklight84	Stormx2`	OK, did that, now I'm getting
2009-08-24T18:02:00.000Z	darklight84		checking for XSS_EXTENSION... configure: error: Package requirements (xscrnsaver) were not met: No package 'xscrnsaver' found
2009-08-24T18:05:00.000Z	Stormx2`	darklight84	I can only assume it's asking for xscreensaver
2009-08-24T18:05:00.000Z	darklight84	Stormx2`	update. I solved it. thanks. needed libxss-dev for that
2009-08-24T18:05:00.000Z	darklight84		now running make
2009-08-24T18:06:00.000Z	Stormx2`	darklight84	if you want the package to be managed under apt, have a look at checkinstall
2009-08-24T18:06:00.000Z	Stormx2`		!checkinstall | darklight84
2009-08-24T18:07:00.000Z	darklight84		thanks!
2009-08-24T18:12:00.000Z	darklight84	Stormx2`	thanks again, it worked like a charm. :) bye
