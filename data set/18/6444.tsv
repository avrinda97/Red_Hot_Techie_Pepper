2009-01-29T01:23:00.000Z	Izinucs		Is there a program that will convert a movie iso to avi?
2009-01-29T01:24:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	dvd::rip, it is installable via apt, or add/remove programs, and offers a GUI.
2009-01-29T01:25:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	thanks.. it'll actually read an iso huh. that's good news
2009-01-29T01:25:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	the package is "dvdrip"
2009-01-29T01:26:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	yep.. got it on my lappy but just now putting it on the desktop
2009-01-29T01:26:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	depending on your depth of knowledge with ssh/network shares (beit samba or nfs) you can use dvd::rip in cluster mode to speed things up.
2009-01-29T01:27:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	that's interesting.. a bit beyond me.. but interesting.
2009-01-29T01:27:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	very, since you can rip dozen of dvds to iso, then que them with dvdrip for transcoding on the farm.
2009-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	how do I mount the iso in dvd:rip? Open project? New Project?
2009-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	I dont have a linux machine in front of me, however new project rings a bell, then choosing the iso in the source blank
2009-01-29T01:31:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	k thanks.. I'll play around
2009-01-29T01:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	I tried ripping again and dvdrip aborts with "Not enabling PSU core, because this movie has only one PSU."
2009-01-29T01:47:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	ok, and? PSU core has todo with audio/video snycronization
2009-01-29T01:47:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	i had no idea.. new to all this transcoding stuff.
2009-01-29T01:47:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	uncheck the box, as well Izinucs in the prefernces area there is a check for all required software and directory rip premissions, Id run that test.
2009-01-29T01:48:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	(the box for ENABLE PSU CIRE)
2009-01-29T01:49:00.000Z	macd	Izinucs	again if I had one in front of me I could check a few more things, maybe Pici has a workstation with it installed ;)
2009-01-29T01:49:00.000Z	Izinucs	macd	the psu core was set at "no" as default..
