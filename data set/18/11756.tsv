2006-09-20T16:58:00.000Z	holler	Jack_Sparrow	sorry
2006-09-20T05:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	holler	Do you have a card reader in that box?
2006-09-20T05:06:00.000Z	holler	Jack_Sparrow	no
2006-09-20T05:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	holler	Do you have 4 usb ports?
2006-09-20T05:06:00.000Z	holler	Jack_Sparrow	yes
2006-09-20T05:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	holler	then you should be fine
2006-09-20T05:07:00.000Z	holler	Jack_Sparrow	hmm...so its just a refresh of the ports?
2006-09-20T05:08:00.000Z	holler	Jack_Sparrow	now that i think about it, it makes sense, the usb ports are attached to my Screen, possibly when my screen has been turned on and off...
2006-09-20T05:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	holler	agreed.
2006-09-20T05:10:00.000Z	holler	Jack_Sparrow	great, thanks for the quick resolution =)
