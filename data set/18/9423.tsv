2007-04-09T08:24:00.000Z	Alanius		I have two ethernet devices
2007-04-09T08:24:00.000Z	Alanius		I can activate them both at the same time
2007-04-09T08:24:00.000Z	Alanius		but I can't use them both at the same time
2007-04-09T08:25:00.000Z	Alanius		through one, my computer is connected to the router+internet, through the other, my computer is connected to another computer
2007-04-09T08:25:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	/sbin/route
2007-04-09T08:25:00.000Z	Alanius		what does that do?
2007-04-09T08:25:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	/sbin/route shows the routing table.  sounds like you have a problem with your default route sending all traffic to one location and nothing through the other ethernet
2007-04-09T08:26:00.000Z	Alanius		so how do I change that?
2007-04-09T08:26:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	well you should have two IP Addresses right?  you need a default route to the first one with the internet and a secondary route to the second one connected to your other computer
2007-04-09T08:27:00.000Z	Alanius	Answer	yes, I have two IP adresses
2007-04-09T08:27:00.000Z	Alanius		how do I make a secondary route?
2007-04-09T08:28:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	and these two ip addresses are on separate networks right?
2007-04-09T08:28:00.000Z	Alanius	Answer	wait a second, I have one IP address on both computers
2007-04-09T08:28:00.000Z	Alanius		my second ethernet device does not have an ip
2007-04-09T08:29:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	on the computer with two interfaces, you should have two different IPs.  one to the internet and one to your pc
2007-04-09T08:29:00.000Z	Alanius		so I should manually set the IP for the second eth device?
2007-04-09T08:30:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	yeah you will need the second interface set to an IP similar to the pc your trying to connect
2007-04-09T08:30:00.000Z	Answer	Alanius	the IP for the second interface needs to be different than your first interface so that it doesn't route all traffic there
