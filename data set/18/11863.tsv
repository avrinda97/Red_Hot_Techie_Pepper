2007-01-31T17:05:00.000Z	Pooky		leave it to exchange to make my transition to linux a serious pain in my ass.
2007-01-31T17:06:00.000Z	Pooky		Microsofts mail/calendar groupware type server
2007-01-31T17:06:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	yeah I know, I have to use the damn thing at work, it is horrible
2007-01-31T17:07:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	are you using evolution?
2007-01-31T17:07:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	yep, not against Exchange though, via POP3
2007-01-31T17:07:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	ah, my issue is with how evolution handles public folders on exchange servers
2007-01-31T17:08:00.000Z	Pooky		evolution seems to only want to show me the top level of any folder
2007-01-31T17:08:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	Get the users to migrate to SharePoint :-p
2007-01-31T17:08:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	haha, I wish, it's a major university
2007-01-31T17:08:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	ha ha
2007-01-31T17:09:00.000Z	Pooky		I tried joining #evolution, and that was kind of fruitless
2007-01-31T17:09:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	I work at a major corporate in Oz, and we used to have Lotus Notes. Very nice, ran on Solaris and Windoze. Then we "upgraded" to Exchange/Outlook. What a mess.
2007-01-31T17:10:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	ugh!
2007-01-31T17:11:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	We now run something like 10 Xeon blades for the Exchange servers when a single RedHat blade could have handled it running Notes
2007-01-31T17:12:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	haha, yeah, I've seen the networking diagrams for my work for the exchange servers, it's mind boggling just how many machines they need just for storage.
2007-01-31T17:13:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	know of any other freenode channels that are good for general linux support?
2007-01-31T17:15:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Pooky	not really sorry. I am just popping past.... but I recall some open source groupware that interfaces to Exchange and then you can use IMAP on top of that ... could you do that?
2007-01-31T17:16:00.000Z	Pooky	ben_underscore	nah, I need a specific exchange feature, which is their public folders. I've got email and calendar working just fine.
