2008-12-16T07:42:00.000Z	FluxD		Hi, Is there a way to see when ubuntu system was installed?
2008-12-16T07:44:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	yes -- look at the date of the log files in /var/log/installer/
2008-12-16T07:45:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	command to see date thru ssh?
2008-12-16T07:46:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	just ls -l /var/log/installer/
2008-12-16T07:48:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	any other way?
2008-12-16T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	that method will work
2008-12-16T07:48:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	I have two boxes on ubuntu server 8.04, one was isntalled after the other and it has older files
2008-12-16T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	strange
2008-12-16T07:49:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	so any other way :)
2008-12-16T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	do determine the date of install?  Inspect the log files in that same directory.
2008-12-16T07:51:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	same thing
2008-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	the dates in /var/log/installer/syslog should be accurate
2008-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	I think this is a modified kernel could be coz of that, so any other way you can think of?
2008-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	both methods I've given you are correct
2008-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	also, "coz" is not a word
2008-12-16T07:57:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	I trust you but I know for sure 1 box is like 3 months older than the other and its files are older. Example 2008-05-14 10:46 <--- newer box  2008-07-22 12:26 <--- older box
2008-12-16T08:05:00.000Z	FluxD	tritium	I trust you but I know for sure 1 box is like 3 months older than the other and its files are older. 2008-05-14 10:46 <--- newer box  2008-07-22 12:26 <--- older box any idea why ?
2008-12-16T08:06:00.000Z	tritium	FluxD	nope
