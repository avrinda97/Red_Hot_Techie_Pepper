2010-08-05T17:48:00.000Z	Aaron1		Hey guys I've downloaded Ubuntu installation disk (10.04) and it will not boot up ( I am getting a blank screen right after I click "try ubuntu.." or if I enable the advance settings (by trial and error: "nomodeset") it will show the loading screen but then will stuck (clicking F1 shows it stops right after "setting sensors limit [ok])) Any Idea how can I solve this ?
2010-08-05T17:50:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	did you check the disc for defects?
2010-08-05T17:51:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	you have dl from windows?
2010-08-05T17:52:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	and burnt to cd using nero or sumthin... and when you check disc it appears to be ok, it returns test with 0 defects?
2010-08-05T17:53:00.000Z	Aaron1	livindaylight	I have used "Infrarecorder" , I have checked the disc from the boot menu
2010-08-05T17:54:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	consider trying to put iso on usb-stick. I can't say why, your cd is not working
2010-08-05T17:55:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	you've done md5sum test of iso, burnt it to cd, checked for defects but get blank screen why you click on 'install' what can one say?
2010-08-05T17:55:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	try another cd ? alternatively, try usb, I don't know what else to suggest
2010-08-05T17:56:00.000Z	Aaron1	livindaylight	alright , I will try USB-stick , thank you for your help
2010-08-05T17:56:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ don't know if you know this site
2010-08-05T18:01:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	good question: I don't know :)
2010-08-05T18:08:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	might not be the best idea. Had any other opinions?
2010-08-05T18:09:00.000Z	Aaron1	livindaylight	I am still trying to find my USB-stick but I have located only my 512MB and unfortunately it is not enough
2010-08-05T18:10:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	its best to use a pendrive. I asked in #linux and #ubuntu-uk and couple people say it might not be a good idea. Maybe don't want to risk it
2010-08-05T18:11:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	wouldn't want you to hate ubuntu afterwards :)
2010-08-05T18:11:00.000Z	Aaron1	livindaylight	: Ok my other option is MicroSD 2GB on a cardreader but I think it will be slow
2010-08-05T18:14:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	i'd like to know whether that works out
2010-08-05T18:17:00.000Z	livindaylight	Aaron1	kewl, good luck ;)
