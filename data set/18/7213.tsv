2010-03-25T06:32:00.000Z	histo	dsnyders	you would need to find where the evenlog is stored on the drive and read it that way
2010-03-25T06:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	histo	I don't think that they're text files.
2010-03-25T06:33:00.000Z	histo	dsnyders	it may be.  Windows saves a lot of stuff in plain text and xml in wierd directorys.  If its in the registry or something i'm sure there are tools
