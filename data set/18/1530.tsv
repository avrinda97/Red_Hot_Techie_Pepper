2011-05-25T14:35:00.000Z	A_J		is There a Separate Netbook Version of ubuntu, if yes a Link Please.
2011-05-25T14:37:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	No, there's no longer a separate netbook remix
2011-05-25T14:37:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	The netbook remix code was merged into the desktop edition, and now, there's only one edition for all: Ubuntu
2011-05-25T14:37:00.000Z	A_J	cdbs	and dcg how do i turn down the power on 11.04 then ?
2011-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	Umm, what do you mean?
2011-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	A_J		i'm pretty sure it won't be able to run 11.04 smoothly
2011-05-25T14:38:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	Okay, it seems you're running Gnome classic, it doesn't seem to have a shutdown menu
2011-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	A_J	cdbs	which version do u recommed for a netbook 11.04, 10.10 or 10.04LTS ?
2011-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	I'd suggest you to install package unity-2d and use that, you're using the classic old style panel env
2011-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	11.04, of course
2011-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	install unity-2d, it'll give you a good interface
2011-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	as for shutdown
2011-05-25T14:39:00.000Z	A_J		cdbs,is that a package unity-2d ?
2011-05-25T14:40:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	Ctrl+Alt+Delete should suffice, but I recommend installing unity-2d for a better experience across the system
2011-05-25T14:40:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	yes, the package name is unity-2d
2011-05-25T14:40:00.000Z	A_J		okie ty cdbs.. btw what time does ActionParsnip  come around ?
2011-05-25T14:40:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	after installing, at next boot you should have a new session to choose at GDM login screen titled "Ubuntu Unity 2D session" or similar
2011-05-25T14:41:00.000Z	cdbs	A_J	^^ :D
