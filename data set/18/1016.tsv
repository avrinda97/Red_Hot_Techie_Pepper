2011-07-05T02:54:00.000Z	Gryllida	wslayer	Can you boot safemode and check logs?
2011-07-05T02:56:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	when i reboot two or three times grub menu shows up and i can enter in the system fine
2011-07-05T02:56:00.000Z	Gryllida	wslayer	One you enter the system, please check the logs
2011-07-05T02:57:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	what log am i supposed to check?
2011-07-05T02:57:00.000Z	Gryllida	wslayer	/var/log/kern.lorg for starters.
2011-07-05T03:05:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	I only have ubuntu installed on this machine, couldn't be that the system is trying to "skip" grub menu going directly to ubuntu but something weird happens on the process?
2011-07-05T03:05:00.000Z	Gryllida	wslayer	I don't know. I need logs for more details.
2011-07-05T03:06:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	what part of kern.log should i check? I'm sorry im newb with linux
2011-07-05T03:07:00.000Z	Gryllida	wslayer	`tail /var/log/kern.log` nd see anything relevant to the problem. Maybe syslog too

2011-07-05T03:13:00.000Z	Gryllida	wslayer	sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get upgrade -- will it fix the issue?
2011-07-05T03:15:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	i will reboot brb
2011-07-05T03:19:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	it's working :) thanks
2011-07-05T03:25:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	but I'm wondering why ubuntu selected from grub menu after too much reboots worked fine... weird
2011-07-05T03:26:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	btw is there a key to fire the ubuntu menu during boot?
2011-07-05T03:27:00.000Z	wslayer	Gryllida	s/ubuntu/grub
