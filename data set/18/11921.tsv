2006-06-06T13:51:00.000Z	rody-DruAl		It doesn't continue running the normal vga bootscreen after Configuring X.. I think it has something to do with that
2006-06-06T13:52:00.000Z	rody-DruAl		when I put the cd in another pc, it runs fine
2006-06-06T13:54:00.000Z	rody-DruAl		I have the same problem as this guy: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25193   But there are no solutions there
2006-06-06T13:56:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	try this,. ctrl+alt+backspace at once - it will restart the gui - what spec is that box?
2006-06-06T13:57:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	trying now
2006-06-06T13:57:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	that is one nasty card - you really need to follow this
2006-06-06T13:58:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	that is the problem are you sure?
2006-06-06T13:59:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	pretty sure
2006-06-06T14:00:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	ok, gonna try that now
2006-06-06T14:05:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	how do i install those drivers when i can't get into the system?
2006-06-06T14:07:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	you go to a terminal, CTRL+ALT+F1 and log in, the instructions you have are in text so you type them out and bingo - the thing is that its a lot of effort to try this out
2006-06-06T14:07:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	one thing you could try is this,
2006-06-06T14:08:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	i can't get into a terminal, because ctrl-alt-f1 says: Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel
2006-06-06T14:08:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg << and there in choose VESA I don't know if that will work Try F2 in that combination up to F7
2006-06-06T14:10:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	i get a lot of black screens, but not a normal terminal window
2006-06-06T14:15:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	ompaul	how do i get in a terminal screen?
2006-06-06T14:16:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	ctrl+alt+f1-6 7 is gnome
2006-06-06T14:23:00.000Z	ompaul	rody-DruAl	no idea how to do that on a live CD
