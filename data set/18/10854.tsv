2007-02-25T09:02:00.000Z	tenco		ok. i installed the drive now in a p3 733mhz with 512mb ram. there it boots but not on my p1 200mhz 64mb ram. how could that be?
2007-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	umm thats way too low of a spec..you need more memory 192 meg as min
2007-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	it will be a route
2007-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	router
2007-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	no desktop install
2007-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	it dont matter, to load ubuntu thats the min
2007-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	unless you have a cdrom that has the bare minimum ubuntu..
2007-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	oh no. how odd. are there ubuntu kernels i can get through apt which have lower ram usage?
2007-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	i use linux-image-server
2007-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	im not familiar with all the different versions, but for such a low spec system, try DSL linux instead
2007-02-25T09:06:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	you need to start reading the readme files to learn the min requirements for these
2007-02-25T09:06:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	why does ubuntu kernels require so much ram? after all, it's just a linux kernel
2007-02-25T09:07:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	which should do fine with 64mb
2007-02-25T09:07:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	i cant answer that ..im not the packager for ubuntu :)
2007-02-25T09:07:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	i need better support :)
2007-02-25T09:07:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	i gave you an alternative...DSL linux
2007-02-25T09:08:00.000Z	bulmer	tenco	fork out the big mullah..aka greenbux then you will get great support ..hehehe
2007-02-25T09:08:00.000Z	tenco	bulmer	:)
