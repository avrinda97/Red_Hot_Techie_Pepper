2006-02-25T08:27:00.000Z	Brumac		how come in the installation of ubuntu it does not give you the option to create a swap partition??
2006-02-25T08:28:00.000Z	Brumac		well I see primary and logical
2006-02-25T08:28:00.000Z	Brumac		is logical the swap?
2006-02-25T08:28:00.000Z	Brumac		"confused"
2006-02-25T08:29:00.000Z	Brumac		I was going step by step on the ubuntu site
2006-02-25T08:29:00.000Z	Brumac		but nowhere in the partition disks menu do I see create partition or swap.
2006-02-25T08:29:00.000Z	intelikey	Brumac	the default install actually doesn't allow for installing without a swap      or at least it isn't easy to continue.
2006-02-25T08:29:00.000Z	Brumac		It created a logical partition of 8MB???
2006-02-25T08:29:00.000Z	Brumac		wierd
2006-02-25T08:30:00.000Z	Brumac		is swap primary or logical???
2006-02-25T08:31:00.000Z	Brumac		which do I choose those?
2006-02-25T08:31:00.000Z	intelikey		logical by default
2006-02-25T08:31:00.000Z	Brumac		looks like Ubuntu created an 8MB logical swap partition on its own
2006-02-25T08:32:00.000Z	Brumac		I see.... #6 logical 8.2MB.....underneath that I see pri/log 10.5 GB FREE SPACE
2006-02-25T08:32:00.000Z	intelikey	Brumac	how much free disk space did you have ?
2006-02-25T08:32:00.000Z	Brumac	amphi	I have over 500MB of RAM
2006-02-25T08:33:00.000Z	Brumac		Any ideas?
2006-02-25T08:33:00.000Z	intelikey	Brumac	there is an app in the repos that will create and use a swap file if and when needed.   you might want to install without swap and use that, just a thought....
