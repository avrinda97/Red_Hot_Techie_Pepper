2006-01-17T06:12:00.000Z	Mapionetka		thats going to cause some rather large issues
2006-01-17T06:12:00.000Z	Mapionetka		would a cron job every 10mins or so to set recursive permissions etc be acceptable?
2006-01-17T06:12:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Mapionetka	Sure. Why not? Depends on how deep it goes.
2006-01-17T06:13:00.000Z	Mapionetka		not very
2006-01-17T06:13:00.000Z	Mapionetka		and the server doesnt do much else with its time
2006-01-17T06:13:00.000Z	Mapionetka		is there a better way to do it?

2006-01-17T06:16:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Mapionetka	man crontab
2006-01-17T06:16:00.000Z	Mapionetka		so i should be using crontab not cron?
2006-01-17T06:17:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Mapionetka	cron is the daemon, crontab manages the schedules.
