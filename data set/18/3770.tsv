2009-09-16T02:36:00.000Z	jrib	trism	ha didn't see you just made the same suggestion, would have saved me some typing :)
2009-09-16T02:37:00.000Z	trism	jrib	yours was more clear I kind of rambled in there
2009-09-16T02:41:00.000Z	jrib	trism	-i will edit the file in place if you don't give it a parameter
2009-09-16T02:42:00.000Z	trism	jrib	yeah I'm always wary of doing that though, like to check that the files look ok first
2009-09-16T02:42:00.000Z	jrib	trism	very true
2009-09-16T02:42:00.000Z	jrib	trism	-ifoo makes backups though :)
2009-09-16T02:43:00.000Z	trism	jrib	nice, I'll have to try that next time
2009-10-22T04:57:00.000Z	trism	jrib	I got one, hehe
2010-04-09T22:46:00.000Z	trism	jrib	well, that would skip every dot in a file name, wouldn't it?
2010-04-09T22:47:00.000Z	jrib	trism	.[^.]* for files beginning with '.' and having second character non-dot and then    ..?*  for files beginning with .. and having second character . (and you don't want ..)
2010-04-09T22:48:00.000Z	jrib	trism	anyway, I'll stick to zsh...
2010-04-09T22:50:00.000Z	trism	jrib	oh I see, for some reason I assumed the glob would apply to [^.], yeah that would be a better way
2011-08-12T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	trism	klingelbart: nautilus will also hide files listed in a .hidden file
2012-09-19T00:53:00.000Z	trism	jrib	nice command (remembers that for later)
2012-10-15T21:35:00.000Z	jrib	trism	oh can you specify that an app only starts for a certain session in a .desktop?
2012-10-15T21:39:00.000Z	trism	jrib	a couple of the xdg autostart files have it but it isn't well documented unfortunately
2012-10-15T21:39:00.000Z	jrib	trism	ah, cool
2012-10-23T22:58:00.000Z	jrib	trism	interesting... here too
