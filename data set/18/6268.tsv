2012-07-02T20:01:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	why so. it can be done by mysql command
2012-07-02T20:03:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	? mysql follows a client-server model, i'm not sure i get your issue sorry
2012-07-02T20:03:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	if i want to use php development with mysql on linux. i only need to install mysql-server ?
2012-07-02T20:04:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	Existing configuration file (./config.inc.php) is not readable.    this is what i get in windows. using xampp. the config.inc.php is presend in phpmyadmin folder.
2012-07-02T20:05:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	you'll need both, which doesn't mean they both need to reside on the same machine
2012-07-02T20:06:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	php will automaticaly connect to mysql-server . so why do i need mysql-client ?
2012-07-02T20:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	ask in ##windows .. never used php on windows sorry
2012-07-02T20:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	if you install mysql-server it will pull-in the mysql-client as a dependency
2012-07-02T20:08:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	you might be mixing the mysql logic with the packaging of mysql on linux as compared to windows
2012-07-02T20:09:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	ok
2012-07-02T20:09:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	 so to use mysql-server . you have to have mysql-client. even if you doo all by php and phpmyadmin
2012-07-02T20:09:00.000Z	blurry		?
2012-07-02T20:11:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	ok. can you tell me about the phpmyadmin error?
2012-07-02T20:11:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	Existing configuration file (./config.inc.php) is not readable.    this is what i get in windows. using xampp. the config.inc.php is presend in phpmyadmin folder.
2012-07-02T20:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	are you running a lamp stack on ubuntu? if not, take a good look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
2012-07-02T20:12:00.000Z	blurry	glitsj16	no that error is in windows
2012-07-02T20:14:00.000Z	glitsj16	blurry	the way php, mysql and apache (or nginx ..) are inter-related on linux differs quite a bit from windows, really worth a read if you want to run it on linux .. if you pastebin your config and provide the link i'll have a look
