2011-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	airtonix		why won't ssh client use the key i tell it to use? i specify it with -i  and it tries EVERY OTHER key except the one i tell it to use... it's almost as if it's trolling me and use the -i switch to sya "lololol ignore this key when attempting to use public-key authentication lolollololol"
2011-12-15T06:27:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	what is the full command you're using?
2011-12-15T06:28:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	i have a correct entry in my ~/.ssh/config, and i can use the shortcut for other entries i have in there... so it fails on both : ssh shortcutname, and ssh user@remote.host.tld -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-keyname
2011-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	verbose mode helping any? -v or -vv or -vvv?
2011-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	versbose mode reveals it is trying every other key
2011-12-15T06:30:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	rfi: permissions are 0600, it works when i prefix the ssh command with : SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh ... (but that is unacceptable when i need to use fabric deployment with a public key)
2011-12-15T06:30:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	possibly related? http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=513235
2011-12-15T06:31:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	rfi: i expect that when i say "use this key" that it would freakn use that key not ignore it
2011-12-15T06:31:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	I agree, so maybe it's a bug
2011-12-15T06:32:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	looking at bug report now
2011-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	ugh, fails when there isn't both the private and public key in ~/.ssh (or at same location as the private)
2011-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	aha!
2011-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	so i guess when i have an entry in ~/.ssh/config then this scenario works
2011-12-15T06:39:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	but yes, you are right there is another bug with ssh-agent where if you don't have an entry in ~/.ssh/config then -i gets ignored when there are more than 6 keys imported to the ssh-agent
2011-12-15T06:40:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	weird. I use config and only have public keys for most of my connections
2011-12-15T06:42:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	yes but if you try to connect to a remote host that you have'nt created a shortcut for in ~/.ssh/config and need to specify -i. then ssh-agent forst tries all it's managed keys before using the one you specified... so it will fail if ssh-agent has more than 6 keys
2011-12-15T06:42:00.000Z	airtonix	somsip	since ssh protocol only tried 6 keys before failing
2011-12-15T06:43:00.000Z	somsip	airtonix	hmm. I use config for ssh'ing but -i for scp and have no problems. But anyways, if you've found your solution that's what matters
