2012-04-02T20:35:00.000Z	drdee		Hi folks, I got 4 identical machines, all running 10.10 server edition. 1 one of them randomly crashes very frequently. It's not the memory (I checked that) and it's not the hard drives, I checked that as well. There are no traces in the log files, how can I debug this?
2012-04-02T20:37:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	crash as in it just turns off for no reason, stalls or hangs and then shut down, or? cause if it turns off, powersupply maybe... stalls and hangs, bad memory (check with memtest if you havent done that already) o.O
2012-04-02T20:37:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	no, it hangs, it is still on but I have to press the reset button to get it back to life
2012-04-02T20:38:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	did it start when you updated it?
2012-04-02T20:38:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	let me rephrase, did this problem start after you updated the computer
2012-04-02T20:38:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	Not sure what you mean, it boots fine after a crash and I reset it
2012-04-02T20:39:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	not that I am aware off, the other 3 machines have the same config
2012-04-02T20:39:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	my suspison is that it is somehow USB related but that's more a hunch than facts
2012-04-02T20:40:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	lol sorry, my hands are not being nice to me... and ok... hmm... driver maybe? what makes you think usb?
2012-04-02T20:43:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	well a year ago the exact same problem happened to another machine, there I disabled USB on the motherboard and then the problem went away. No the first machine (with USB enabled) does not have the problem but another one has it. but it just sucks to   disable USB  :)
2012-04-02T20:45:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	that is interesting... how old are the mobo's? and to tell youthe truth, if it worked before, maybe try it again and if it does, maybe look into a new mobo... out of curiosity, what os are you using? 10? 11?
2012-04-02T20:46:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	mobo's? i am running 10.10 server
2012-04-02T20:46:00.000Z	drdee		motherboards?
2012-04-02T20:46:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	mobo = motherboards :)
2012-04-02T20:46:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	18 months
2012-04-02T20:47:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	ouch o.O ok... hmm... i wonder if the driver on your 10.10 got updated, or maybe there could be a actual problem with the mobo itself and screwing with the os? :s i am not sure where to go with this...
2012-04-02T20:51:00.000Z	FrozenMind	drdee	sorry i can't be more help... :(
2012-04-02T20:55:00.000Z	drdee	FrozenMind	np, thanks!
