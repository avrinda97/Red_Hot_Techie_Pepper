2010-02-22T01:35:00.000Z	jpapertowel		i'm getting sick of no linux dists supporting software raid :(
2010-02-22T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	all linux distro support software raid, fakeraid is poor in all distros, try not to use it
2010-02-22T01:36:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	i'm using software raid and grub won't install, how do i boot without a loader?
2010-02-22T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	 you install grub to the disk - not to the raid meta device
2010-02-22T01:36:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	how do i install grub to the disk?
2010-02-22T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	also - make sure you have a seperate /boot partition if you are using raid 0 or 5,
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	select the raw disk devices as the device
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	also make sure your talking about software raid and not fake raid
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	oh...guess I have to reinstall and make a boot partition this time *sigh*
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	these stupid wiki articles need to be updated to tell you things like this
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	the limitations of raid 1 and 5 are well documented
2010-02-22T01:39:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	can my /boot partition be ext4?
2010-02-22T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	sure
2010-02-22T01:55:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	i'm at the part where i make the /boot partiton, should I make 2 boot partitions and RAID them or make 2 boot partitions and leave them as it is?
2010-02-22T01:56:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	you can raid them, just use raid 1
2010-02-22T01:56:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	can't use raid0? :/
2010-02-22T01:56:00.000Z	ikonia	jpapertowel	no, /boot raid 0 or 5 is not supported
2010-02-22T02:19:00.000Z	jpapertowel	ikonia	i'm on the grub install stage of the installer, but it says grub-install to (hd0) fails :(
