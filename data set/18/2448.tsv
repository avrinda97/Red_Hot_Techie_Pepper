2010-05-13T03:44:00.000Z	primetime34		What is the location of the grub2 file?
2010-05-13T03:46:00.000Z	primetime34		Any idea how to make grub try and boot from a secondary hard drive?
2010-05-13T03:47:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	you have the grub menu to do so if grub detected your 2nd HD got a OS
2010-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	primetime34	wildbat	 my 2nd hard drive has two partitions and one of them has lucid installed.  However, when I try to start up, it isn't booting into it
2010-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	wildbat		!grub2 | primetime34
2010-05-13T03:49:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	try update-grub2
2010-05-13T03:49:00.000Z	primetime34		What should my grub.cfg file say if it is trying to boot from a '3rd' hard drive?
2010-05-13T03:51:00.000Z	primetime34		Now it doesn't say 'no operating system' but is just sitting on the blinking cursor in upper left hand corner
2010-05-13T03:54:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	so where you at ?
2010-05-13T03:54:00.000Z	primetime34	wildbat	 idaho, USA
2010-05-13T03:55:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	i mean your computer screen ~ you said no os
2010-05-13T03:55:00.000Z	primetime34	wildbat	 haha...yeah, it would just flash between no os and a flashing cursor
2010-05-13T03:56:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	aftert eh boot menu?
2010-05-13T03:56:00.000Z	primetime34	wildbat	 bios boot...I don't ever see a linux boot
2010-05-13T03:57:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	so you never see a grub menu? ~ boot with shift key hold down and see ~ not same message you got, you Bios set to boot a wrong drive
2010-05-13T04:00:00.000Z	primetime34	wildbat	 holding shift down does nothing...my bios says it'll boot from my external, but I have it partitioned into two drives...is that my problem?
2010-05-13T04:01:00.000Z	wildbat	primetime34	if that's so ~ your external don't have grub installing mbr ~ check with the web page on how t install it back
2010-05-13T04:01:00.000Z	primetime34	wildbat	 do you have a link?
