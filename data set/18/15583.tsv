2005-10-30T12:11:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	josh__	instead of asking us what each command does ... you can either try it or do man <command>
2005-10-31T12:35:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	josh__	cs ?
2005-10-31T12:37:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	josh__	hl2 doesn't work with wine ... unless i am mistaken
2005-10-31T12:38:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	josh__	you need wine but as i said last i heard wine doesn't support hl2 ...
2005-10-31T12:45:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	josh__	terminal has it too ...
