2012-07-24T21:29:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	I'm a little disturbed by that - I thought I was running a very minimal installation.
2012-07-24T21:31:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	That was for Ubuntu 9.04 and below.
2012-07-24T21:34:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	I can't see anything in that panel that looks like settings... (12.04 LTS here)
2012-07-24T21:35:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	try looking up for "keyring"
2012-07-24T21:40:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	this is so silly. All I can find is a "Passwords and Keys" app. AFAIK I've only installed the bare gpg. I can't find anything that seems like it might be of use...
2012-07-24T21:42:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	isn't it in preferences?
2012-07-24T21:45:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	I am referring to Tools > Preferences.
2012-07-24T21:47:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	I'm stuck with whatever garbage they replace Gnme with in 12.04.  I've got a UI bar on the left hand side with a "System Settings", and that's about it.
2012-07-24T21:52:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	my point being that I can't find anything resembling what you describe. It's a clean install of 12.04 off branded media. The only thing that resembles what you describe is the "Password and Keys" tool. I can't find anything else.
2012-07-24T21:53:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	a minute ago, I told you to open up Password and Keys, click on tools, click on preferences, and uncheck "Cache PGP passphrases"
2012-07-24T21:58:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	there's nothing there but an editor for keyservers.
2012-07-24T22:02:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	it does cache, which is why it is showing you the login keyrings.
2012-07-24T22:05:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	the best I can do is run gpg with --no-use-agent. This works for me, but I cant expect users here to do this :(
2012-07-24T22:12:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	having any more luck finding information than I am?
2012-07-24T22:18:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	lmsmith	I see.
2012-07-24T22:19:00.000Z	lmsmith	MorpheusChalice	ty for the help.  Wasted too much effort on this already.
