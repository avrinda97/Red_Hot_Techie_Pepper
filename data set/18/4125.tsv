2012-02-08T17:40:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	i've stumbled through port forwarding in the past... I'll help if I can. What are you trying to acheive?
2012-02-08T17:46:00.000Z	hariom	flintwingel	I am trying to access my test site running on Django development server to be able to access from the outside (internet)
2012-02-08T17:47:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	so you've got a router handling your internet connection..? and you've forwarded port 80 to your test veirtual server ?
2012-02-08T17:49:00.000Z	hariom	flintwingel	I have a modem that gets the internet line, and this modem is connected to my router. In the router I have setup Virtual Server port forwarding to my internal ip (where the dev test site is running) and the port but some how I am not able to reach to it.
2012-02-08T17:51:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	and you can get to your dev site ok from your ocal network OK?
2012-02-08T17:52:00.000Z	hariom	flintwingel	yes. I tried from other PC within the network and I am able to access
2012-02-08T17:52:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	so the issue seems to be with the router... what is it?
2012-02-08T17:53:00.000Z	hariom		I am not sure whether it is with the router or it is with the modem.             ISP -> Modem -> Routers -> (Computers).
2012-02-08T17:53:00.000Z	hariom		How do I test if it is reaching to the router or not?
2012-02-08T17:53:00.000Z	hariom		flintwingel:How do I test if it is reaching to the router or not?
2012-02-08T17:54:00.000Z	flintwingel		haroim: if it is genuinely just a modem then is should pass all traffic through both wways with interfering
2012-02-08T17:54:00.000Z	flintwingel		what make&model are the modem & router?
2012-02-08T17:55:00.000Z	hariom		router: belkin; modem: Beetel
2012-02-08T17:56:00.000Z	hariom		flintwingel:router: belkin; modem: Beetel
2012-02-08T17:58:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	canyou give me model names or numbers as well so I can look them up
2012-02-08T18:00:00.000Z	hariom	flintwingel	Belkin G Router and Beetel: 110TC1
2012-02-08T18:19:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	the beetel is not just a modem, from what I can tell it's a full blown router in it's own right whih means you'll need to port forward through it & the belkin (http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Beetel/110TC1/110TC1index.htm)
2012-02-08T18:19:00.000Z	flintwingel	hariom	try taking the belkin out of the way and just go the the beetel for testing
