2004-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	melazyboy		the package VLC is out of date
2004-12-13T08:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	define "out of date" :-)
2004-12-13T08:23:00.000Z	melazyboy	Xenguy	The version of the program is not consistant with the term 'bleeding edge' it lacks a newer version which includes numerous bug fixes
2004-12-13T08:24:00.000Z	melazyboy		yea i could =/
2004-12-13T08:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	If I understand Ubuntu correctly it is possible for software to become outdated between the time of one release and the next - and this is normal.  Is this the case here by any chance?
2004-12-13T08:25:00.000Z	melazyboy		One of them affects me, sound, cuts out in wmvs, i can wait just an fyi =D
2004-12-13T08:26:00.000Z	melazyboy	Xenguy	Not to start a fight, but there isn't an instance when that isn't the case, is any software outdated when first released?
2004-12-13T08:26:00.000Z	Xenguy		BTW I've never heard of this VLC thing (everyone is always on about 'mplayer' which never seems to work for me) -- is VLC a real alternative to mplayer, or am I asking about apples and oranges?
2004-12-13T08:26:00.000Z	melazyboy	Xenguy	I prefer it
2004-12-13T08:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	I'll let that one go at this hour ;-)
2004-12-13T08:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	hrm, OK, good to know
2004-12-13T08:27:00.000Z	melazyboy		It preforms excelent, the options are where i want them, it has a very minimalistic look, without feture bloat like skinning support =D
2004-12-13T08:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	is it newish, or has it been around for some time?
2004-12-13T08:28:00.000Z	melazyboy		and out of the box it supports everything except rms, and .rams
2004-12-13T08:29:00.000Z	melazyboy	Xenguy	It's on slashdot alot, it's been around for over a year, it's lead by that 'dvd bob' or what ever his name is, he is using an open source codec he created in the player, rather than a wrapper around microsofts
2004-12-13T08:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	man that sounds quite awesome - I'd like to give it a whirl then (is it still buggy at all?)
2004-12-13T08:31:00.000Z	melazyboy	Xenguy	The sound issue doesn't affect everyone, it just cuts out some times when playing WMVs but the seek on VLC seems to be 10x faster tha other programs i have used, (not to say i have given other programs the same chance i have given vlc) but its pretty well rounded
2004-12-13T08:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	melazyboy	so just a bit glitchy around wmv's then -- sounds worth a try -- thanks for the tip
