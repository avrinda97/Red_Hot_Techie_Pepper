2009-08-12T21:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	just type the command in as you would type it on the command line
2009-08-12T21:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	put sudo before it
2009-08-12T21:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	yes
2009-08-12T21:11:00.000Z	caseys	lstarnes	then how do i put the password in
2009-08-12T21:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	echo "password" | sudo -s
2009-08-12T21:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	actually, that may be -S
2009-08-12T21:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	however, it is much more secure to input the password manually
2009-12-29T01:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	caseys	are your SMTP username and the from address identical?
