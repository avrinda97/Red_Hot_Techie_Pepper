2010-04-02T04:01:00.000Z	kevin_		hello. does anyone know how I can access my xorg.conf file? it does not appear under \etc\x11
2010-04-02T04:02:00.000Z	kevin_		im trying to change the screen res. since i only have 840x600
2010-04-02T04:03:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	gives you administrative priveledges required to make changes to the system
2010-04-02T04:04:00.000Z	kevin_	acicula	ok thx
2010-10-15T01:28:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	the drivers that come with ubuntu, did those not work for you? i assume since you are inst manually you are  using nvidias run file?
2010-10-15T01:29:00.000Z	kevin_	acicula	the default drivers did work. However they are missing some functionality as well as being a bit choppy. I am trying to install via the nVidia run file.
2010-10-15T01:31:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	ah ok, thats pretty vital info. Whats not working precisely, you ran the .run file and now no gui will come up or?
2010-10-15T01:36:00.000Z	kevin_	acicula	well, the default drivers allow me to use the computer. I'm using it now. However I think that they are limited and that the nV drivers would be better. I can't run the .run file because I have to be in text only mode, and that's what my goal is right now. I was thinking that because I have 6 screens it wierds out the ctrl + alt + f1-6 thing.
2010-10-15T01:38:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	well not very knowledgeable about multicard setups,does it use multiple x servers or just one for all cards?, you can shutdown the x server by typing sudo service gdm stop in a terminal. The nvidia has an uninstall flag i think if things dont work. Id recommend removing the existing nvidia-binary drivers before installing the nvidia drivers manually(and remove those first before reenabling the drivers that came with ubuntu)
2010-10-15T01:42:00.000Z	kevin_	acicula	It uses one x server for all the screens, when I do "sudo service gdm stop" i am not taken to the command prompt, that's the issue. Instead I'm put into a black screen that I can type on, but there is no prompt at all, can't execute commands.
2010-10-15T01:43:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	oic
2010-10-15T01:43:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	tried booting rescue mode and dropping to a rootshell without starting the gui
2010-10-15T01:45:00.000Z	kevin_	acicula	haven't tried that, i thought that the recovery mode used a different kernel, and installing the drivers with that kernel would not work for the other kernel. Is that true?
2010-10-15T01:46:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	eh it uses the samme kernel
2010-10-15T01:47:00.000Z	kevin_	acicula	ok, I'll give that a shot, thanks!
2010-10-15T01:47:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	look in menu.lst or whatever the grub file is, the kernel options are different
2010-10-15T01:47:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	getting a terminal without a prompt means there isnt a login program running
2010-10-15T01:48:00.000Z	acicula	kevin_	kinda obvious i admit, but could be its hidden somewhere, thing shift and ctrl and such also may serve as hotkeys for more terminals
