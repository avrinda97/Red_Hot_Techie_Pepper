2005-11-06T11:58:00.000Z	BinkS		ok cool, how do i run though :/
2005-11-06T12:00:00.000Z	BinkS		what roms should I get though?
2005-11-06T12:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 i have about 12GB of xmame roms. :P
2005-11-06T12:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 when you run xmame the first time it should make a .xmame dir. thats where the user can keep their own personal settings. and roms
2005-11-06T12:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 type xmame in a shell. :P
2005-11-06T12:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 you need to download the roms and put them in the right place.
2005-11-06T12:08:00.000Z	BinkS	dr_willis	do they have to be for xmame then? As google isn't helpful :(
2005-11-06T12:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 theres DOZENS of sites out with mame info. google for 'mame' not xmame :P
2005-11-06T12:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 xmame is the "X" version of mame.
2005-11-06T12:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 the xmame confg file in /etc/ says to put them in  /usr/share/games/xmame/roms
2005-11-06T12:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 OF ya can set that configl to put them whever.. OR you can use the command line optuons
2005-11-06T12:12:00.000Z	BinkS	dr_willis	leave them in zip folders or unzip?
2005-11-06T12:19:00.000Z	BinkS	dr_willis	I am still getting that error, when I have just put a rom in it ???
2005-11-06T12:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 i got all my roms in that dir. and 'chmod 644' them all.
2005-11-06T12:21:00.000Z	BinkS	dr_willis	it seems its trying to load pacman before it does anything?
2005-11-06T12:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 its defaults to the pacman rom by default
2005-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	BinkS	 did you Download a packman.zip rom ?
