2012-01-15T02:32:00.000Z	Seveas	nivyaj	libreoffice didn't exist yet back then :)
2012-01-15T02:32:00.000Z	Seveas	nivyaj	when oracle decided to screw the openoffice community, the community told oracle to [well, not very nice things indeed], and created libreoffice, based on the openoffice code
2012-01-15T02:34:00.000Z	nivyaj	Seveas	how come when i typed !info synergy i didn't get the definetion like you did
2012-01-15T02:34:00.000Z	Seveas	nivyaj	because ubottu doesn't like to repeat itself
2012-01-15T02:34:00.000Z	nivyaj	Seveas	is ubottu a bot?
2012-01-15T02:34:00.000Z	Seveas	nivyaj	yes. I wrote most of its code a long time ago :)
2012-01-15T02:35:00.000Z	Seveas	nivyaj	almoxarife: in 10.04, libreoffice is not available. Stick with openoffice
2012-01-15T02:36:00.000Z	nivyaj	Seveas	i love this bot!
