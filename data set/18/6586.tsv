2008-04-27T06:13:00.000Z	davelee		(worked on 7.10)
2008-04-27T06:13:00.000Z	davelee		i have an intel onboard ac97 thingo
2008-04-27T06:13:00.000Z	davelee		ff3 is supposed to fix the memory leak FF was famous for
2008-04-27T06:13:00.000Z	davelee		should use less memory
2008-04-27T06:14:00.000Z	davelee		so
2008-04-27T06:14:00.000Z	davelee		can anyone gimme some ideas?
2008-04-27T06:14:00.000Z	yoursfaithfully	davelee	Did you check your audio card model number to see if there are driver issues?
2008-04-27T06:15:00.000Z	davelee	yoursfaithfully	well - it works under every other OS i've used including ubuntu 7.10. SHould i still check ?
2008-04-27T06:16:00.000Z	davelee		so ....
2008-04-27T06:16:00.000Z	davelee		sound ....
2008-04-27T06:16:00.000Z	yoursfaithfully	davelee	It might be a good idea.  There was a problem with my laptop audio limited to recent Ubuntu distros - headphone jack awareness didn't work, neither did the mic - I just needed to patch ALSA and re-install
2008-04-27T06:17:00.000Z	davelee	yoursfaithfully	where do i check? i don't even know specifically the model number
2008-04-27T06:19:00.000Z	davelee		i'm using the server kernel - should i reboot and try generic ?
2008-04-27T06:19:00.000Z	yoursfaithfully	davelee	 If you can identify your audio chipset, I think it will go easier for you.  Maybe search for specs for your laptop or desktop?
