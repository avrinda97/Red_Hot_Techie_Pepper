2006-01-18T11:19:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Hmm, no suggestions eh?
2006-01-18T11:19:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	isn't there a package called dvdrip?
2006-01-18T11:20:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	Yes. I'm trying it out now, but.. It's painfully slow.
2006-01-18T11:20:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	any other packages in the same category in synaptic?
2006-01-18T11:21:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	synaptic?
2006-01-18T11:22:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	a gui front-end to apt, that can list packages in categories, so find the category with dvdrip, and there might be some other choices there
2006-02-19T16:58:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	he actually asked his question 2 or 3 times that I saw before he said that, and nobody volunteered a response
2006-02-19T16:59:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	granted I agree that he should have just assumed that meant nobody could help. but it wasn't his opening statement
2006-02-19T16:59:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	I wasn't here to actually see it. I just FINALLY got Kubuntu to install on one of my server boxes after a failed MD5Sum check on a package.
2006-02-19T16:59:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	how you like it so far?
2006-02-20T17:00:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	For a binary-oriented distribution, Kubuntu is pretty nice. It's not without it's serious flaws, however. MD5Sums on a CD is /bad/. And this has happened in 4.10 and 5.10 now.
2006-02-20T17:01:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	did you use the same mirror for each? I've never had bad checksums for Ubuntu images
2006-02-20T17:01:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	Yes. The MD5 of the disc checked out.
2006-02-21T09:14:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	it's not just you, happens to all of us. (still haven't figured out why I don't have shutdown/restart in my logout dialog)
2006-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	Well, are you using kdm or gdm?
2006-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	kdm
2006-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	fangorious	And you don't get the option to shutdown/restart?
2006-02-21T09:16:00.000Z	fangorious	Psi-Jack	I can shutdown/restart from kdm. But once logged in (to gnome), after selecting System->Log out, there's no option to shutdown or restart
