2008-11-04T08:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	dominik1	is that it?   What kind of laptop is it?
2008-11-04T08:30:00.000Z	dominik1	danbhfive	it is a HP: Compaq: Presario V2000
2008-11-04T08:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	dominik1	is your wifi light lit?
2008-11-04T08:32:00.000Z	dominik1	danbhfive	no it is not, but pressing the button that should light, unlight it does not show a response
2008-11-04T08:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	dominik1	well, I don't know why you are having a problem, but I think that your wifi not lighting up is the problem
2008-11-04T08:37:00.000Z	dominik1	danbhfive	how do I get it to light up under linux? it works fine when I boot into windows, it is enabled in windows, and it is enabled in my BIOS
2008-11-04T08:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	dominik1	http://www.tux.org/~peterw/v2000/    I dunno.  According to that page, it should work.  So, its a bug
2008-11-04T08:41:00.000Z	dominik1	danbhfive	is there an alternative way of enableing the wifi card? also he might have been useing a different wifi card
2008-11-04T08:43:00.000Z	dominik1	danbhfive	also my video card is nto recognized.  when I go to the hardware manager it tells me it has a driver but it is not activated, when I activate it a window pops up dowloading somthing but the bar stays at 0% then that window just closes, without an error message and the driver is still not activated.
