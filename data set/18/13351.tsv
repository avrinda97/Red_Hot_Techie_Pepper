2006-01-24T09:53:00.000Z	Rodietze		hey I've installed windows again and now It has overrided the boot screen
2006-01-24T09:54:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	reinstall grub
2006-01-24T09:54:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	just grub?
2006-01-24T09:54:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	yes
2006-01-24T09:55:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	but when I try to install now Ubuntu doesn't show my partitions... just the entire disk... so I'm afraid of loosing my entire HDD ?
2006-01-24T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	you mean you repartitioned your disk and erased ubuntu?
2006-01-24T09:57:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	no, I had ubuntu in the ext3 partition at hda6 but had win in hda1 and data in hda5, but after reinstalled windows on the hda1 grub was gone and Ubuntu istaller doesn't give me the option to choose hda6 (ext3) anymore
2006-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	that does indicate a problem
2006-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	oh no! another problem nooo :P really?
2006-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	if the partition was overwritten, that's certainly a problem.  Installing windows shouldn't do that, but it isn't all that difficult a mistake to make
2006-01-24T09:59:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	oh its not overriden... just doesn't appear
2006-01-24T10:00:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	the only way I know of to make it "not appear" is to rewrite the partition table without it.
2006-01-24T10:00:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	if in fact it isn't overwritten, and you know the boundaries, you can re-establish it with fdisk
2006-01-24T10:01:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	oh thankks, so I'll try :)
2006-01-24T10:01:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	but I'm still a bit confused.  If you had installed ubuntu and used /dev/hda5, why are we talking about hda6?
2006-01-24T10:01:00.000Z	sethk	Rodietze	or did I get that wrong
2006-01-24T10:04:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	well lemme explain u again anyways heh, I have 3 partitions here, hda1 = ntfs that has windows on it, hda5 = ntfs taht has data on it and hda6 = ext3 that has ubuntu, but since I had to format hda1 yo reinstall windows the grub was gone, and I can't use Ubuntu anymore coz windows boots automatically
2006-01-24T10:05:00.000Z	Rodietze	sethk	but when I try to reinstall Ubuntu the installer gives me just on choice, the entire hdd as 'HDA 80GB', so I'm afraid coz before I used to have the 3 partitions
