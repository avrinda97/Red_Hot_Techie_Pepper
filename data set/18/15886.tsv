2006-06-06T16:13:00.000Z	valberg		ahh a complete removal then...
2006-06-06T16:14:00.000Z	valberg		how do i remove something completely, with dependencies, using apt-get ?
2006-06-06T16:15:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	I think apt-get remove will automatically remove dependencies if they are not used by anything else
2006-06-06T16:15:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	doesn't look like it... i think
2006-06-06T16:20:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	^^
2006-06-06T16:21:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	whats the issue?
2006-06-06T16:22:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	xserver-xorg-core wants to overwrite a file that is also owned by gatos...
2006-06-06T16:23:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	this might not be the best way, but... you could apt-get remove gatos (taking the xserver with it, and then apt-get the xserver back
2006-06-06T16:23:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	and when i try to apt-get remove gatos i get two dependency problems with libfontenc1 and libxfont1 depending on xserver-xorg-core
2006-06-06T16:25:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	so i've tried doing that...
2006-06-06T16:26:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	oh :(
2006-06-06T16:27:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	trying to use synaptic to do it...
2006-06-06T16:27:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	my last option
2006-06-06T16:28:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	but now it removes alot of stuff
2006-06-06T16:43:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	what did you do?
2006-06-06T16:44:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	couldn't find out how to do that in cmd apt-get
2006-06-06T16:44:00.000Z	chapium	valberg	whichever too works best :D
2006-06-06T16:45:00.000Z	valberg	chapium	it did indeed remove the xserver-xorg-core packages and all it dependencies... but they're in place now... running the apt-get dist-upgrade with style now (untill the next error occurs that is :P)
