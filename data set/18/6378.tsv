2008-05-17T02:28:00.000Z	amenado		Bodsda-> yeah if it will be on a different path
2008-05-17T02:29:00.000Z	amenado		Bodsda-> the ! is needed if the destination file already exist
2008-05-17T02:30:00.000Z	amenado		Bodsda-> a lil more practice will make it less complex
2008-05-17T02:31:00.000Z	amenado		Bodsda-> also , look for vim cheat sheets  so  you'd get exposed to its advanced features
2008-05-17T02:32:00.000Z	amenado		Bodsda-> that way, you will learn regular expression along side with vim..
2008-05-17T02:33:00.000Z	amenado		Ntsunda-> can you boot from the liveCD okay?
2008-05-17T02:34:00.000Z	amenado		Bodsda-> okay good luck, enjoy..
2008-05-17T02:35:00.000Z	amenado		Ntsunda-> once you are in liveCD, open a terminal and type  fdisk -l  to find out what your system sees as storage devices

2008-05-17T02:35:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	I do that and it returns nothing at all :-(
2008-05-17T02:37:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	fdisk -l <enter> returns me to the next line with no results
2008-05-17T02:39:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	GParted also comes back and tells me "no devices detected"
2008-05-17T02:39:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	 I've been at this for 10 hours already, can't tell you how many reboots
2008-05-17T02:50:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	lshw returns SATA Controller IDE Mode config: driver=sats_sis latency=64 module =sata_sis
2008-05-17T02:57:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	thanks for your help - I'm calling it a night
2008-05-17T02:59:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	I've also been googling, I think I'm gonna carry on playing with bios settings too - but I'll pick it up again in the morning
2008-05-17T03:00:00.000Z	Ntsunda	amenado	- perhaps I should just go and buy an IDE drive
