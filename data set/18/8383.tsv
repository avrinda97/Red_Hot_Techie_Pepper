2007-08-27T12:27:00.000Z	notacake		anyone got any experience with compression algorithms?
2007-08-27T12:28:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	since you're asking in here and not in some more specific channel I'll take a shot at your question
2007-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	well I've tried #compression, totally dead in there, basically I'm trying to figure out what algorithm some raw compressed data has been compressed with
2007-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	ouch.. that sounds really really hard if not impossible.. unless there are some headers or magic numbers involved I'd say you won't have much success
2007-08-27T12:30:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	as a last resort I'm going to write some code that just tries lots of algorithms with different settings, I know it'll be ASCII output so that's a start
2007-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	you have no idea what so ever what kind it might be?
2007-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	I mean.. you could use the right algorithm but miss some padding at the start and you wouldn't even know it.. the number combinations are huuuuuuuge
2007-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	nope, doesn't seem to have any headers, it's from a proprietary format so it's probably striped the compression headers
2007-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	do you have any idea what kind of data is it, once it uncompressed?
2007-08-27T12:33:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	yeh I'm pretty sure I have one of the files uncompressed
2007-08-27T12:33:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	"pretty sure" =) well.. I'd start comparing those and see if you can find anything resembling huffman trees etc..
2007-08-27T12:35:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	yeah looks like that's the way to go, I would reverse engineer the exe, but it's got an encrypted entry point
2007-08-27T12:36:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	someone really doesn't want you to have that information.. =)
2007-08-27T12:36:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	someone called "Microsoft" =)
2007-08-27T12:37:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	I'm surprised microsoft has any proprietary formats left to crack
2007-08-27T12:37:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	they have when it comes to the Xbox 360
2007-08-27T12:39:00.000Z	Slart	notacake	ah.. forgot about that "little toy" =)
2007-08-27T12:40:00.000Z	notacake	Slart	anyway I better get working, thanks for your time
