2005-02-19T17:51:00.000Z	snoopy		I cant get my cd burner to work, ubuntu detects it the device maneger
2005-02-19T17:52:00.000Z	snoopy		and it worked under my old distro without any extra config
2005-02-19T17:53:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	What are you using to try and burn?
2005-02-19T17:54:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	But what are you using to burn the iso?
2005-02-19T17:55:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	What is the error you get?
2005-02-19T17:56:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Have you tried mounting a normal CD in it?
2005-02-19T17:58:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	it is an IDE burner right?
2005-02-19T17:59:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Are you using the user account that you created when installing?
2005-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	It may be worth trying from the command-line.
2005-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Are you running warty?
2005-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Have you checked the permissions on the CD device?
2005-02-19T06:03:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Has it been working previously in Ubuntu?
2005-02-19T06:04:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Is this a fresh install?
2005-02-19T06:06:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	You aren't trying to use ide-scsi emulation are you?
2005-02-19T06:07:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	I know, just checking.
2005-02-19T06:08:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Have you checked any logs for error messages such as /var/log/messages?
2005-02-19T06:09:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	Might be worth having a look, especially when you boot NGOME and try and use the nautilus CD burner.
2005-02-19T06:09:00.000Z	TheMuso	snoopy	As I don't really know what is going on.
