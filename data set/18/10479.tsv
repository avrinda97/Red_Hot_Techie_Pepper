2007-03-22T10:27:00.000Z	goosfraba4u		HELP! just got a MyBook (usb drive) and can't mount it any way I try.
2007-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	goosfraba4u		the damn thing is on FAT32 (if that's responsible for it?)
2007-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	ant	goosfraba4u	: i assume it doesnt show up under lsusb
2007-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	nope
2007-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	ant		:(

2007-03-22T10:29:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	I wouldn't bother you guys if it did

2007-03-22T10:30:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	*resort
2007-03-22T10:30:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	so any other suggestions?
2007-03-22T10:32:00.000Z	ant	goosfraba4u	: well after looking on the web, seems like other poeple are using theirs.. so it is possible.
2007-03-22T10:35:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	thanks. I know it's possible. The question is, "how?"
2007-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	just tried (watch -d "dmesg | grep usb")
2007-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	when I unplugged my mouse, it changed, but when I plugged in the MyBook... nothing...
2007-03-22T10:43:00.000Z	ant	goosfraba4u	: if its not showing up in dmesg i dont know where to start
2007-03-22T10:45:00.000Z	goosfraba4u	ant	thanks for your support on this one. Bad usb port. Just plugged it in one of the ones in the front and it autodetected. (Thats what happens when you have 16 usb ports... :) )
2007-03-22T10:48:00.000Z	ant	goosfraba4u	: thats almost funny, i was thinking earlier that you might be using a usb 1.1 and needing a usb2 but it shoulda worked none the less
