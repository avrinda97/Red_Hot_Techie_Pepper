2008-06-02T20:41:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	thank you for telling me the system-wide command.
2008-06-02T20:45:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	is there any way to remove black patches on screen when i use higher refresh rates for a particular resolution?
2008-06-02T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	i havn't seen that problem ...
2008-06-02T20:46:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	that problem does not appear when i use lower refresh rates, though
2009-05-04T18:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	maybe it does not support it... ffmpeg from repos has some codecs disabled for legal reasons
2009-05-04T18:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	medibuntu has alternative packages
2009-05-04T18:40:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	should i install medibuntu's version of ffmpeg?
2010-08-15T16:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	the process may be not be smp/threaded so maybe it can only run in one cpu no matter what
2010-08-15T16:09:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	so thats why we need to strictly go for SMP software wherever possible, to take full advantage of multicores, is it?
2010-08-15T16:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	correct.
2010-08-15T16:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	not all tasks can be parallel though
2010-08-15T16:11:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	yeah, thank u, fine:)
2010-09-11T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	edit /etc/default/grub and add it to the string that has splash and quiet. then do « sudo update-grub »
2010-09-11T14:43:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	while running update-grub its showing the error: "grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for /"
2010-09-11T14:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	sriramoman	if you are not in the afected system. you will have to chrrot to it to make the changes
2010-09-11T14:45:00.000Z	sriramoman	erUSUL	i issed it as root user
