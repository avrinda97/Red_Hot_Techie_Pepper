2005-04-08T12:11:00.000Z	lok		[nrx] , use a live-cd and use the qtparted gparted or parted for partitionning your hd
2005-04-08T12:12:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	lok	so i suppose you have to change how much ram it uses?
2005-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		nrx, you have a usb? floppy?
2005-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	lok	^thehatsrule^	there's NOTHING to do with your ram when you wants to partitioning your hd
2005-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		what do you have then? ;p
2005-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	lok	yes, but i couldnt install anything when i booted off default options on ubuntu
