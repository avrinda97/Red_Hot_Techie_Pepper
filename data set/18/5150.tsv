2009-05-25T07:28:00.000Z	jhonnyboy		Hello everyone, i just finished installing my web server sucessfully, but how can i log into it to use ftp to update files from another computer??
2009-05-25T07:28:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	ssh is the standard recommendation
2009-05-25T07:29:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	you don't have to, but it's going to be faster, easier, and more secure
2009-05-25T07:29:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	install openssh-server
2009-05-25T07:30:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	fryguy	then i have to configure it?
2009-05-25T07:30:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	no
2009-05-25T07:35:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	fryguy	Ok just finished installing openssh-server. How can i test it out? Do i have to set up a username/password to log in?
2009-05-25T07:36:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	it uses the same usernames/passwords as everything else on your system
2009-05-25T07:41:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	what server are you trying to log into, what what are you trying to log into? ssh?
2009-05-25T07:41:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	fryguy	yep, ssh. I isntalled the openssh server but dont know what to do next
2009-05-25T07:41:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	well what do you WANT do to?
2009-05-25T07:42:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	fryguy	try to edit and see the files from another computer
2009-05-25T07:46:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	just edit it directly on the machine in a shell, or use winscp or another sftp client to do the transfers back and forth
2009-05-25T07:50:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	use the adduser command (or edit the necessary things in /etc manually)
2009-05-25T07:50:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	fryguy	thanks fryguy :D
2009-05-25T07:55:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	fryguy	adduser worked like a charm! Would you happen to know of any software that would back up a directory after a certain time period?
2009-05-25T07:56:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	cron + any backup solution (i like rdiff-backup, but there are doesn'ts of options)
2009-05-25T07:58:00.000Z	fryguy	jhonnyboy	deluser or userdel, i forget
