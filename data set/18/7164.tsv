2008-04-01T03:58:00.000Z	unop_		why does everything have to look like vista? can't anything be original anymore?
2008-04-01T03:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	unop_	vista IMH but opinionated O vista is ugly
2008-04-01T03:59:00.000Z	unop_	IdleOne	maybe it is, maybe it's not -- but i mean - trying to make ubuntu look like vista, why?
2008-04-01T04:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	unop_	I dont understand it either
2008-04-13T04:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	unop_	how do i execute that script?
2008-04-13T04:23:00.000Z	unop_	IdleOne	try this out - it should work, if it does, uncomment the last line and change the directory to your Pictures folder so a copy is saved there - http://pastebin.com/m5c0fdadc
2008-04-13T04:23:00.000Z	unop_	IdleOne	err, also take echo off of the last-but-one line
2008-04-13T04:26:00.000Z	unop_	IdleOne	you'll need to make a cron job to run this daily
2008-04-13T04:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	unop_	will do thanks

2008-04-13T04:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	unop_	thank you very much for doing this :)
2008-04-13T04:34:00.000Z	unop_	IdleOne	yw :) i'm going to update the forum post with the changes
2008-04-13T04:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	unop_	this may be a dumb question but I should set the screensaver to blank screen correct?
2008-04-13T04:54:00.000Z	unop_	IdleOne	I blank the screen but don't use a screensaver .. if you're asking me what you should do, well, that depends on what your comp. does really, i find screensavers to be resource hogs and can't use them
