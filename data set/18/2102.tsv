2010-08-24T08:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	what does dig google.com  give you.  does dns work?
2010-08-24T08:46:00.000Z	dschuett	sacarlson	i don't have any dns set up on my router... can i just use 8.8.8.8 (google's)
2010-08-24T08:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	without dns you have no internet
2010-08-24T08:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	what is the contents of /etc/resolv.conf
2010-08-24T08:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	well what was in the resolv.conf
2010-08-24T08:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	can you ping 74.125.153.147
2010-08-24T08:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	can you ping 68.105.28.11
2010-08-24T08:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	yes if he can't ping his dns then dns is not his problem
2010-08-24T08:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	but I don't know what error he got when he tried
2011-03-02T21:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	dschuett	maybe a dns problem?  how long does dig google.com take,  maybe winbind problem?
