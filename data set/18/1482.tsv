2011-03-20T03:34:00.000Z	kpoman		anyone ?
2011-03-20T03:36:00.000Z	kpoman	iqpi	if I wanted to compile my own kernel, how do I know which .config is now running on my box so I can make oldconfig of it ?
2011-03-20T03:37:00.000Z	kpoman	iqpi	and will I lose my gl/compiz/vbox/etc... kernel modules dead ?
2011-03-20T03:38:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	you wont loose anything, but you will have to rebuild them to run with that kernel
2011-03-20T03:39:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	just reinstalling the driver
2011-03-20T03:39:00.000Z	kpoman	iqpi	so basically I will lose the deb / synaptic / updates / etc ability
2011-03-20T03:39:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	no, you wont loose that
2011-03-20T03:39:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	your system will be with the same programmes you had
2011-03-20T03:40:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	but you will need to rebuild you drivers for you vga and perhaps virtualbox modules
2011-03-20T03:41:00.000Z	kpoman		just a last question, how do I know if I run x386 or amd64 ?
2011-03-20T03:42:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	run uname -r
2011-03-20T03:42:00.000Z	kpoman		2.6.35-27-generic
2011-03-20T03:42:00.000Z	iqpi	kpoman	if you see something about x86_64 = 64 bits, if you see i386 then x32
