2008-03-07T22:58:00.000Z	Downsay	brobostigon	my sound isn't working after I upgraded to gutsy, so now it says I am missing kernel headers
2008-03-07T22:59:00.000Z	brobostigon	Downsay	if youre in gnome, go into your admin menu, and start synaptic
2008-03-07T22:59:00.000Z	Downsay	brobostigon	done, I'm in synaptic
2008-03-07T23:00:00.000Z	brobostigon	Downsay	at the top there should be a button called search, press it, and in the opened box type in the package you need
2008-03-07T23:00:00.000Z	Downsay	brobostigon	I've done that as well, there are many packages that come up with kernel header
2008-03-07T23:51:00.000Z	brobostigon	Downsay	try, sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-headers
2008-03-07T23:52:00.000Z	Downsay	brobostigon	this is what it gives me: http://pastebin.ca/932420
2008-03-07T23:54:00.000Z	brobostigon	Downsay	try, sudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.22-14-generic, that should work if you have the latest kernel and all recent updates
2008-03-07T23:55:00.000Z	Downsay	brobostigon	that didn't work
2008-03-07T23:59:00.000Z	Downsay	brobostigon	here's my pastebin, it didn't work: http://pastebin.ca/932427
2008-03-08T00:01:00.000Z	brobostigon	Downsay	try, sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-$(uname -r), denand already suggested it, it should work,
