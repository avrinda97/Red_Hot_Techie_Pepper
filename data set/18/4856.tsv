2009-04-27T23:07:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	I've found those guides to be confusing myself, really.
2009-04-27T23:08:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	I'm not the most experienced compiler, etc. though
2009-04-27T23:08:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	well google how to compile
2009-04-27T23:08:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	i was surprised at first when people asked me to google everything, but it really does work
2009-04-27T23:09:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	you can teach yourself a lot just through wiki's and man pages
2009-04-27T23:09:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	there are evidently a lot of people out there teaching for free
2009-04-27T23:09:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	I understand that, but between buying a ten dollar modem that works and rifling through twenty tabs (which is when I gave up), I'd choose the former
2009-04-27T23:10:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	I'm all for learning more about the system, but it reached a point where I didn't want to go any further
2009-04-27T23:10:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	yeah you have to make a decision. do you want to get really involved in the technical details, or just buy something that has support
2009-04-27T23:11:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	don't take this the wrong way, but why isn't the lucent winmodem supported to just work? A lot of windows machines have those sets. Is there some sort of legal reason?
2009-04-27T23:12:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	there isn't inbuilt kernel support yet
2009-04-27T23:12:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	That's all? How odd. I remember reading something about Intrepid supporting it a long time ago, but I guess that never happened
2009-04-27T23:12:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	windows is has the largest marketshare, so companies like Lucent write windows drivers as a priority
2009-04-27T23:13:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	it's stupid not to really
2009-04-27T23:13:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	of course, but if we could incorporate packages and whatnot to support winmodems manually, why couldn't we make it work like any other piece of hardware in linux ("just work")?
2009-04-27T23:14:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	well I'm sure in time it will be built into the kernel
2009-04-27T23:14:00.000Z	daedra	cornwall	and there may even be distributions with the drivers in it's kernel
2009-04-27T23:15:00.000Z	cornwall	daedra	wish I could contribute to help implement it, but I'm afraid I must selfishly allocate my time differently
