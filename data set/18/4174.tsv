2009-11-19T04:34:00.000Z	Redeemed		I installed songbird on Karmic a couple weeks ago when Marmic came out, and it was working fine, now suddenly my media library won't load... any suggestions
2009-11-19T04:35:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Clear out your library and re-add all your music.
2009-11-19T04:38:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	What is the status of songbird is it a finished work, beta etc?
2009-11-19T04:40:00.000Z	Redeemed	linuxguy2009	it is finshed and still supported I beleive
2009-11-19T04:41:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Did you check for broken packages etc?
2009-11-19T04:41:00.000Z	Redeemed	linuxguy2009	yup
2009-11-19T04:42:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	open system monitor and make sure all instances are closed. (Im downloading songbird now to test it, Ive never tried it before.
2009-11-19T04:43:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Also might want to look in /home/useraccount/.songbird folder and delete the folder to set back to factory defaults and lose all custom settings.
2009-11-19T04:46:00.000Z	Redeemed	linuxguy2009	there doesn't seem to be a .songbird folder.. i might have to do a reinstall and see what happens
2009-11-19T04:46:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	You did hit Ctrl+H to show hidden folders right?
2009-11-19T04:47:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Might also be in .conf or a few other places.
2009-11-19T04:49:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Bash doesnt show hidden folders by default.
2009-11-19T04:50:00.000Z	Redeemed	linuxguy2009	no, but if you type the folder exactly, it will nav there anyway :P
2009-11-19T04:51:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Did you check in .conf?
2009-11-19T04:51:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Might also be in different caps etc. Might try nautilus since you dont know the exact folder name.
2009-11-19T04:52:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Its in your home folder somewhere, it saves personal customizations there.
2009-11-19T04:53:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Redeemed	Did you remember to purge configuration files?
2009-11-19T04:53:00.000Z	Redeemed	linuxguy2009	crap lol
