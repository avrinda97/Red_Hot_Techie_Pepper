2006-11-19T17:16:00.000Z	mngrif		(i'll try this the n00b way) can someone help with an installation problem?:
2006-11-19T17:18:00.000Z	AndiM	mngrif	specifics, please ;)
2006-11-19T17:19:00.000Z	mngrif	AndiM	gave out specifics 10 minutes ago :P in short ubiquity is saying i don't have a root partition selected when i do infact have one selected. apparently it wants the "reformat" box checked on whatever i pick as /. this is with 6.10
2006-11-19T17:19:00.000Z	mngrif	AndiM	and the livecd won't use /etc/resolv.conf
2006-11-19T17:20:00.000Z	AndiM	mngrif	does that partition have wrong existing filesystem? ext3, reiser, resier4, xfs, jfs, ...?
2006-11-19T17:20:00.000Z	mngrif	AndiM	it's ext3, clean, but it does have data i can't backup, so i can't reformat it

2006-11-19T17:22:00.000Z	mngrif		[i can't search because of the dns issue, i'm ssh'd into my router to use irc] 
2006-11-19T17:22:00.000Z	mngrif		can you resolve launchpad.net for me?
2006-11-19T17:22:00.000Z	mngrif		wait, i can do that :P

2006-11-19T17:23:00.000Z	mngrif		grrr... does the livecd have the console installer on it?
2006-11-19T17:25:00.000Z	AndiM	mngrif	all I can say is: good luck!
2006-11-19T17:26:00.000Z	mngrif	AndiM	i make my own luck.... *grabs a rocket launcher* this is gonna be ugly.
2006-11-19T17:29:00.000Z	AndiM	mngrif	we need heroes such as you and me to save the world *smirk*
2006-11-19T17:29:00.000Z	mngrif	AndiM	" Since you must reformat the root file system for use by the installer in any case, you can easily work around this problem by deleting and re-creating the partition in question in the advanced partitioner." what kind of crap is this?!
2006-11-19T17:29:00.000Z	mngrif	AndiM	oh i assure you, i save the world from M$, one day at a time, one computer at a time....
2006-11-19T17:31:00.000Z	AndiM	mngrif	ick.
