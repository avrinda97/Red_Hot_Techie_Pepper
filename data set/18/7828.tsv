2008-03-04T22:17:00.000Z	Pip		At which level should I read Effective C++ ?
2008-03-04T22:17:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	after you understand the basics
2008-03-04T22:18:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	Thanks
2008-03-04T22:18:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	also, C++ is a very hard language to start with
2008-03-04T22:19:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	feel
2008-03-04T22:19:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	i would recomend getting some years experience before you start with some higher level language, like python
2008-03-04T22:20:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	You recommend some script language to me ?
2008-03-04T22:20:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	Why later for python ?
2008-03-04T22:20:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	the other way around =)
2008-03-04T22:21:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	start with python or any high level language, then when you got that under control you can do C++
2008-03-04T22:22:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	I don't understand
2008-03-04T22:23:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	i just wouldnt recomend anyone to go C++ as first language to learn, when there are so many nicer languages out there
2008-03-04T22:24:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	when you feel comfortable
2008-03-04T22:24:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	or when you need it
2008-03-04T22:25:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	Does Bjarne think so ?
2008-03-04T22:25:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	i think so yes
2008-03-04T22:28:00.000Z	mavi-	Pip	yeah ive been coding C++ since 95 =)
2008-03-04T22:28:00.000Z	Pip	mavi-	So you must be a master of it
