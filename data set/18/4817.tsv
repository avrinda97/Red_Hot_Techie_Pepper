2009-02-04T10:39:00.000Z	nellmathew		hey guys : in cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules - wlan0 is being used by "b43-pci-bridge", that's why it's not showing up with ndiswrapper, what should i do?
2009-02-04T10:39:00.000Z	nellmathew		# PCI device 0x14e4:0x4320 (b43-pci-bridge)
2009-02-04T10:39:00.000Z	nellmathew		SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:90:4b:5a:e4:d5", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="wlan*", NAME="wlan0"
2009-02-04T10:40:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	your using ndiswrapper for a broadcom wireless card correct?
2009-02-04T10:40:00.000Z	nellmathew		yes
2009-02-04T10:40:00.000Z	nellmathew	Sylphid	nothing else seems to work.. so i'm trying ndiswrapper in intrepid
2009-02-04T10:41:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	add 'blacklist b43' to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2009-02-04T10:42:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	you will need to reboot afterwards
2009-02-04T10:42:00.000Z	nellmathew	Sylphid	i already blacklisted bxm43xx, b43, b43legacy, ssb & added ndiswrapper to modules though..
2009-02-04T10:43:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	what driver does  sudo lshw -C network  show that your wireless interface is using
2009-02-04T10:44:00.000Z	nellmathew	Sylphid	my problem is iwconfig doesn't show "wlan0".. i read on the forums to check if it's being used by anything else by doing "Check the contents of the /etc/iftab file and make sure that no other device has the wlan0 driver name reserved for it: cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules" .. it is being used by something else.. no further info though
2009-02-04T10:45:00.000Z	nellmathew	Sylphid	driver=b43-pci-bridge latency=64 module=ssb
2009-02-04T10:45:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	and your sure that b43 is blacklisted?
2009-02-04T10:46:00.000Z	nellmathew	Sylphid	it's definitely on the list.. let me try another reboot then, should i try to blacklist b43-pci-bridge too maybe?
2009-02-04T10:46:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	you should not need to
2009-02-04T10:46:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	try this first
2009-02-04T10:47:00.000Z	Sylphid	nellmathew	sudo modprobe -r b43 && sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
2009-02-04T10:50:00.000Z	nellmathew	Sylphid	done.. iwconfig still doesn't show wlan0, let me try rebooting.. brb 2 min, thanks for you help btw!
