2006-04-26T14:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	Haven't been following, but I have a T43 myself - what's up?
2006-04-26T14:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	Have you tried the ScanModem utility from linmodems.org yet?
2006-04-26T14:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	Might be a good place to start.  I'm running some quick searches too.
2006-04-26T14:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	Should tell you chipset and such, and if you're lucky, recommend a driver.
2006-04-26T14:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	It appears from what I'm seeing that the modem on that model is actually the same as mine.  "IBM Integrated 56k modem", MDC-2, in the CDC slot?
2006-04-26T14:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	Erm, hold on.
2006-04-26T15:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	This is my lspci output: 0000:00:1e.3 Modem: Intel Corp. 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Modem Controller (rev 03)
2006-04-26T15:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LetMe	Either way, you might want to check out the trial versions of both the HSF (what I use) and HCF drivers from linuxant.com/drivers, see if they work, and if they do, go ahead and buy a license.  If not, keep exploering the other possibilities, but that's one option anyway.
