2005-08-06T06:52:00.000Z	f_newton		anyone here know why when I installed ubuntu I didnt get asked for a root password and now I cant seem to get into su -?
2005-08-06T06:52:00.000Z	f_newton		excuse me ?
2005-08-06T06:53:00.000Z	f_newton		I want to log in as root
2005-08-06T06:53:00.000Z	f_newton		to do maint on my install
2005-08-06T06:53:00.000Z	f_newton		you arent listening I guess...
2005-08-06T06:53:00.000Z	f_newton		there must be a root acct with a password
2005-08-06T06:54:00.000Z	f_newton		if this has a community root password then I am gonna toss it in the trash
2005-08-06T06:54:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	you never need to be root, and thus ubuntu has root logins desabled
2005-08-07T15:19:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	the only thing really worth getting from backports are the stuff in hoary-extras that are not available otherwise
2005-08-10T12:45:00.000Z	f_newton	topyli	he still needs to run ./install script
2005-08-10T12:45:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	no
2005-08-10T12:46:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	pavel makes nice debs and rpms
2005-08-10T12:46:00.000Z	f_newton	topyli	unless OOo has changed their process
2005-08-10T12:46:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	this reveals a bunch of debs
2005-08-10T12:50:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	see the site i linked to above. pavel rocks so hard i can't sleep :)
2005-08-10T13:18:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	if i need a windows app i use windows :)
2005-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	hide a windows box under the desk or in the nearby closet and VNC into it. it's the ultimate windows emulator :)
2005-08-10T13:21:00.000Z	topyli	f_newton	i also got rid of it (gave it to the lady). i realized it's been too long since i needed it. i only miss worms armageddon :)
