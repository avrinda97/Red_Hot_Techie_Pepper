2006-03-10T07:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak		ok people use #ubuntu+1 for dapper talk
2006-03-10T07:22:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	Only reason I asked here was due to the fact that most everyone over on #ubuntu+1 has an idle time of an hour or more
2006-03-10T07:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zarephath	thats because everyone comes in here
2006-03-21T13:58:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	Is XGL enabled upon in install with Flight 5?
2006-03-21T13:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zarephath	no

2006-03-23T16:37:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	Really that sits on a panel in gnome? I thought that was command line?
2006-03-23T16:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zarephath	that sits in your terminal when you type it
2006-03-23T16:38:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	And that wasn't my question...thanks anyway..I know how to do command line
2006-03-24T17:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zarephath	make sure you have multiverse repos enabled
2006-03-24T17:11:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	I'll double check, but am pretty sure it is...thanks
2006-03-24T17:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zarephath	make sure its not the backports lines but the universe lines should have multivverse in them
2006-03-24T17:13:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	Gotcha...is it ok to leave it in the backports too though?
2006-03-24T15:45:00.000Z	Zarephath	gnomefreak	How would I specify a ip range in the portmap file?  192.168.0.2-192.168.0.50 ?
2006-03-24T15:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Zarephath	if you ask the room you might get a better answer
