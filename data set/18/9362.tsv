2008-05-05T16:39:00.000Z	manchicken	ticky	most of the time they seem to work as soon as you plug them in.
2008-05-05T16:39:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	yes, that's what i read, but it is not my case
2008-05-05T16:40:00.000Z	manchicken	ticky	You may want to lsusb and see if your model has support.
2008-05-05T16:40:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	i have a generic (kind of homemade) joystick
2008-05-05T16:41:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	can you priv. msg me?

2008-05-05T16:42:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	i don't want to bother the rest of the channel
2008-05-05T16:42:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	so when i do lsusb, i get a lot of "Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 " msgs
2008-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	nothing
2008-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	manchicken	ticky	Then you don't have it plugged in...
2008-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	yes, jscalibrator does not detect a thing
2008-05-05T16:45:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	so. how should i proceed?
2008-05-05T16:45:00.000Z	manchicken	ticky	Is the joystick currently plugged in completely?
2008-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	i see a red light on
2008-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	manchicken	ticky	And it's plugged into the USB?
2008-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	ticky	manchicken	yep
2008-05-05T16:51:00.000Z	manchicken	ticky	Try unplugging and then plugging it back in, then checking dmesg.
