2007-04-29T15:12:00.000Z	slavik	nr4g3d	no
2007-04-29T15:12:00.000Z	slavik	nr4g3d	unless it is smaller than 1024
2007-04-29T15:13:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	alrighty, thx. Must be something with the way i'm using sockets then in perl... :/
2007-04-29T15:13:00.000Z	slavik	nr4g3d	pastebin your script
2007-04-29T15:14:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	pastebin? sorry I'm not familiar with what you mean. Or do you mean paste in chat the script? I'm not intending to be a wise crack or anything heh.
2007-04-29T15:16:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	hi slavik, thx. I just pasted it.
2007-04-29T15:16:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	or rather, just pastebinned it. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18285/
2007-04-29T15:17:00.000Z	slavik	nr4g3d	where does it stope working?
2007-04-29T15:18:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	well the weird thing is i execute the script and its continuing to run, but when I try to use a socket connection to connect to port 7070, i get a refused connection even though this server script is being ran.
2007-04-29T15:19:00.000Z	slavik	nr4g3d	ahh, then it's a firewall thing, install firestarter and open the proper port
2007-04-29T15:20:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	alrighty, I will do that. thanks a bunch
2007-04-29T15:21:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	my only thing i'm not necessarily sure of is that when i do an nmap it claims that port is opened... could it just be opened but not accepting or something?
2007-04-29T15:21:00.000Z	slavik	nr4g3d	the client script is run on the same machine?
2007-04-29T15:22:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	as the server script? no.
2007-04-29T15:25:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	I just ran the server script and client on the same machine, and they are talking with little problems, so I'm assuming this is indeed a firewall problem. I am proceeding to install firestarter
2007-04-29T15:25:00.000Z	nr4g3d	slavik	thank you :)
