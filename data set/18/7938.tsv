2007-12-29T18:18:00.000Z	Tobias92		How do I discover which codec is attributed to a .avi file in ubuntu?
2007-12-29T18:19:00.000Z	Tobias92		If I play it in mplayer the screen goes all pink :(
2007-12-29T18:20:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	you use "file filename.avi"
2007-12-29T18:20:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	righto, divX 5, thanks. How do I force mplayer to use that?
2007-12-29T18:21:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	it will automatically if it's supported. see if "mplayer -vo x11 filename.avi" also give you the pink tone.
2007-12-29T18:22:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	it doesnt thanks. But I cant set it on full screen, I get black bars all around. Can't I tell it to "stretch out"?
2007-12-29T18:23:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	mplayer -vo x11 -zoom (i think)
2007-12-29T18:23:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	thanks a million! :)
2008-01-04T18:24:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	tricky question. make sure /etc/lirc/hardware.conf has got the correct LIRCD_ARGS. example, I need to use LIRCD_ARGS="-H dev/input -d /dev/input/event0 /etc/lirc/lircd.conf" for appleir controller.
2008-01-04T18:25:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	might be as easy as to find the correct /dev/input/eventX to use. that is specific to your hardware...
2008-01-04T18:26:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	how do I find such event? :P
2008-01-04T18:27:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	Myself, I experimented. But I think it's best to google for an example /etc/lirc/hardware.conf for your controller.
2008-01-04T18:27:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	so its hardware.conf I need to configure for my device, not lircd.conf?
2008-01-04T18:28:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	hardware.conf maps to the correct device. lircd.conf contain the key bindings. lircmd.conf I don't use at all.
2008-01-04T18:29:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	ok thanks
2008-01-04T18:30:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	perhaps there is a lirc irc channel if you're lucky.
2008-01-04T18:43:00.000Z	Jowi	Tobias92	perhaps this page can help you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallLirc/Gutsy
2008-01-04T18:43:00.000Z	Tobias92	Jowi	thanks!
