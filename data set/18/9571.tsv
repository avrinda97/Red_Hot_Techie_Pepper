2007-04-06T13:28:00.000Z	jva		i'm on an older pc, and ubuntu is a bit slow. how can i make it faster?
2007-04-06T13:28:00.000Z	jva		for example can i reduce the eye-candy and effects of gnome to make it more lightweight?
2007-04-06T13:29:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	gnome is never going to be light weight. xfce is only alternative for that. gnome pulls in all kinds of stuff to do simple things. it constanly borrows existing progs and loads em instead of something coded from scratch if that makes any sense
2007-04-06T13:29:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	i mention xfce becaulse of gtk
2007-04-06T13:30:00.000Z	jva	dyrne	does xfce use gtk?
2007-04-06T13:30:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	yeah
2007-04-06T13:30:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	same themes etc.
2007-04-06T13:30:00.000Z	jva		is there a gnome control panel?
2007-04-06T13:31:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	you can run gnome-panel from xfce or fluxbox for that matter if you want. you can even just start x with nothing but a windows and run gnome-panel. but gnome apps will be bloated
2007-04-06T13:32:00.000Z	jva	dyrne	what's gnome panel?
2007-04-06T13:32:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	open a terminal and type 'pkill gnome-panel'
2007-04-06T13:33:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	itll relaunch
2007-04-06T13:33:00.000Z	jva	dyrne	is there a thing like gnome control center?
2007-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	yeah. do a apt-get install xubuntu-desktop  you can choose between xfce and gnome at the login screen by clicking 'sessions' button
2007-04-06T13:35:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	by default the de for xubuntu looks pretty lame but can be setup to look as cool as any other
2007-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	dyrne	jva	there are gui tools
2007-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	jva		how can i test my download speed?
2007-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	jva	dyrne	no i meant like a center that would allow me to reduce font quality and the rest
