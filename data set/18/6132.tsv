2008-06-24T05:49:00.000Z	yoyone1	stiv2k	there isn't one
2008-06-24T05:49:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	what do I do now?
2008-06-24T05:49:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	my /etc/passwd file got erased when I tried to add a new user via the GNOME users and groups setting.
2008-06-24T05:50:00.000Z	yoyone1	stiv2k	try opening terminal and typing passwd
2008-06-24T05:51:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	I can still log in but I cant start X or use sudo or do anything
2008-06-24T05:52:00.000Z	yoyone1	stiv2k	how do you log in
2008-06-24T05:52:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	im forced to use the console right now
2008-06-24T05:52:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	the root password got erased
2008-06-24T05:52:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	or something
2008-06-24T05:53:00.000Z	yoyone1	stiv2k	do you know how to use a recovery cd likesystem rescue cd
2008-06-24T05:53:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	so I have to reinstall?
2008-06-24T05:53:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	this is bullshit
2008-06-24T05:54:00.000Z	yoyone1	stiv2k	no, boot a live cd,chroot into system, and type passwd in terminal to redo root password
2008-06-24T05:54:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	but i lost _all_ the other passwd entries
2008-06-24T05:56:00.000Z	stiv2k	yoyone1	they arent real users, just users like `gdm` and stuff
2008-06-24T05:58:00.000Z	yoyone1	stiv2k	I don't think every etc/passwd file is the same
