2006-11-10T10:43:00.000Z	avagant		Soulseek > all.
2006-11-10T10:43:00.000Z	avagant		Nicotine is a Soulseek made in Python.
2006-11-10T10:43:00.000Z	avagant		Soulseek port, version whatever.
2006-11-10T10:43:00.000Z	avagant		They need to update soulseek on windows though, cause that things been out since I discovered it 2 years ago.
2006-11-10T10:44:00.000Z	avagant		if you need to restart your eth0 connection do this:
2006-11-10T10:44:00.000Z	avagant		sudo ifdown eth0
2006-11-10T10:44:00.000Z	avagant		and then sudo ifup eth0
2006-11-10T10:45:00.000Z	avagant		It's the equivilent to clicking network connections and "disconnecting".
2006-11-10T10:45:00.000Z	avagant		Man I didn't think it would be so hard to learn Ruby.
2006-11-10T10:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	avagant	ifup eth0 reports error getting interface flags, no such device
2006-11-10T10:50:00.000Z	avagant	dsnyders	How did you upgrade to Edgy?
2006-11-10T10:51:00.000Z	dsnyders	avagant	I ran a couple of scripts on a website.
2006-11-10T10:52:00.000Z	avagant	dsnyders	Did it have "gksu update-manager -c" in it?
2006-11-10T10:52:00.000Z	dsnyders	avagant	I do not remember.  I have seen that command since, though.
2006-11-10T10:53:00.000Z	avagant	dsnyders	That's apparently the "prefered" way to upgrade to Edgy.
2006-11-10T10:55:00.000Z	dsnyders	avagant	I've tried that command since the original upgrade failed.  However, with no XWindows, the gksu command fails.
2006-11-10T10:55:00.000Z	dsnyders	avagant	apparently that's one of the ways the upgrade can fail.
