2010-10-15T20:39:00.000Z	dev2		I have added a command to /etc/rc.local because i need it to start before login.  When I run the command from the console it runs, but the same command /appears/ to fail when run from the rc.local file.  Is there somewhere I can see why it failed?
2010-10-15T20:40:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	What command is it?
2010-10-15T20:40:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	Maybe it needs a service like DBus to be running
2010-10-15T20:40:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	Or maybe it's a command that you need to run as a user, not as roto?
2010-10-15T20:40:00.000Z	undecim		root*
2010-10-15T20:41:00.000Z	dev2	undecim	 is there somewhere errors get logged so I can see what is happening?   I'm running it with sudo -u me BUNDLE_GEMFILE=/home/code/library/Gemfile  /usr/bin/merb -m /home/code/elibrary
2010-10-15T20:43:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	You can output stderr to a file by putting "2>>/path/to/a/file" at the end
2010-10-15T20:43:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	You don't have encrypted home directory, do you?
2010-10-15T20:43:00.000Z	dev2		not to my knowledge
2010-10-15T20:44:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	Also, try changing "-u" to "-iu" to simulate inital login and setup env vars properly
2010-10-15T20:44:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	Without that, the wrong $HOME and other env vars will be set, and the command could fail reading config files, etc.
2010-10-15T20:44:00.000Z	dev2	undecim	 ok, I'm trying these things.
2010-10-15T20:45:00.000Z	dev2	undecim	 makes sense.  I'll get back in a few  thanks!
2010-10-15T20:45:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	I have to leave for ~30 min right now
2010-10-15T20:45:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	So if the problem persists after that, I'll be back later
2010-10-15T20:45:00.000Z	dev2	undecim	 no prob, thanks :)
2010-10-15T22:06:00.000Z	undecim	dev2	Sorry was gone longer than I intended. Did you get it worked out?
2010-10-15T22:08:00.000Z	dev2	undecim	thanks!  it worked out. :)
