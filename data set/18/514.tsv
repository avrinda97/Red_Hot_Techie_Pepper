2012-01-26T07:28:00.000Z	psyrus		if you touch 3 fingers on your trackpad in ubuntu 11.1, it will move the whole window  , u just move your 3 fingers around on the pad, 2 for scrolling, and one for point/click
2012-01-26T07:30:00.000Z	psyrus		okay, another thing i just somehow did was take a snapshot of my screen
2012-01-26T07:30:00.000Z	psyrus		if i can do that, i wonder if i can record video
2012-01-26T07:31:00.000Z	psyrus		well, there is a "prt scr" button on my laptop on the upper mid-right section, it takes screen snapshos

2012-01-26T07:35:00.000Z	psyrus		it iinsalled some kinda generic drivers, i dont actually see my specific video card listed
2012-01-26T07:36:00.000Z	hydrox24	psyrus	using what tool to list the drivers?
2012-01-27T07:12:00.000Z	hydrox24	psyrus	probably something to do with architecture incompatibilities by the sounds of things.
2012-01-27T07:13:00.000Z	hydrox24	psyrus	essentially it DOESNT sound right..
2012-01-27T07:13:00.000Z	hydrox24	psyrus	can you paste the output on pstebin and put the link here?
2012-01-27T07:13:00.000Z	psyrus	hydrox24	okay whatever I dont care i'll run i different snes emulator -- i just dont see how vlc could possibly conflict with zsnes ??!
2012-01-27T07:20:00.000Z	hydrox24	psyrus	It's more of an issue simply because of the package management and dependency resolution systems
2012-01-27T07:20:00.000Z	hydrox24	psyrus	one of the few disadvanteages of their amazingness
2012-01-27T07:22:00.000Z	psyrus	hydrox24	its hard for me to describe the advancement of computer technology, it's all happening very quickly, so imo, i call it all "early" stages really
