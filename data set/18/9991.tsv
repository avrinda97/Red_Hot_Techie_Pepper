2007-12-15T02:17:00.000Z	mindy		How can I install the rt2x00 drivers for my rt2500 rather than the rt2500 drivers already included in my Gutsy kernel? I see the source via apt-get, but this would require a custom kernel. Any way I can avoid rolling my own for support?
2007-12-15T02:18:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	You only need to build the custom drivers, not the whole kernel.
2007-12-15T02:18:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	You cna install and use `module-assistant' for that.
2007-12-15T02:18:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	when I run make from the rt2x00 directory in /usr/src/modules I get errors...
2007-12-15T02:19:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	Did you install the required kernel-headers package?
2007-12-15T02:19:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	linux-headers-2.6.22-14-generic
2007-12-15T02:20:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	uname -r : 2.6.22-14-generic
2007-12-15T02:20:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	Hmmm ok.
2007-12-15T02:20:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	Can you pastebin the error?
2007-12-15T02:21:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	the first is  #error Wireless radio support not enabled in kernel!
2007-12-15T02:21:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	I'll pastebin the rest. one sec...
2007-12-15T02:22:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	http://pastebin.org/11613
2007-12-15T02:26:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	Hmmm... does the rt2x00 README mention any odd options needed for wifi? I'd have thought it would be fine with the normal ones.
2007-12-15T02:30:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	how can i cross-reference the requirements with the options set in my default gutsy kernel image>
2007-12-15T02:31:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	The options in the current kernel are set in /boot/config-$(uname -r)
2007-12-15T02:33:00.000Z	mindy	cafuego	CONFIG_NET_RADIO doesn't appear in my current conifg.
2007-12-15T02:34:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	Not set in mine either, but it does wifi just fine.
2007-12-15T02:35:00.000Z	cafuego	mindy	I suspect those drivers might just be out of date wrt kernel config.
