2004-12-12T15:04:00.000Z	jdub		cross-grading is waaaay not the way to do it
2004-12-12T14:28:00.000Z	jdub		there's one on cdimage.ubuntu.com, but i wouldn't recommend using it
2004-12-12T14:28:00.000Z	jdub		better to install warty and upgrade
2004-12-12T14:29:00.000Z	bancus	jdub	I *can't* install warty
2004-12-12T14:29:00.000Z	bancus		hence the issue
2004-12-12T14:29:00.000Z	bancus		it tanks during the base-system install
2004-12-12T14:29:00.000Z	bancus		after the partition formatting, I might add
2004-12-12T14:29:00.000Z	bancus		so I'm stuck with windows until I can get this working
2004-12-12T14:30:00.000Z	jdub		tried md5summing the disk?
2004-12-12T14:30:00.000Z	jdub		not sure the hoary installer is going to be that much more useful for you
2004-12-12T14:30:00.000Z	bancus		it can't find /cdrom/dist//Release
2004-12-12T14:30:00.000Z	bancus		like it doesn't know that it's installing warty
2004-12-12T14:31:00.000Z	bancus		also, can I md5sum under windows?
2004-12-12T14:31:00.000Z	jdub		rm, not sure
2004-12-12T14:31:00.000Z	jdub	bancus	you might want to check bugzilla for bugs about that issue, i know it's been raised a couple of times
2004-12-12T14:32:00.000Z	bancus		google shows nothing, but I'll check bugzilla
2004-12-12T14:33:00.000Z	bancus	jdub	bugzilla doesn't seem to contain anything either
2004-12-12T14:41:00.000Z	bancus	jdub	the md5sum of the ISO checks out, but I have no way of verifying the disk itself
