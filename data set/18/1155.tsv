2011-05-14T13:02:00.000Z	angheloko		hello guys.. i'm about to do a dist-upgrade on a minimal install ubuntu... any drawbacks if a do dist-upgrade with no-install-recommends on it to keep the installation at a minimum?
2011-05-14T13:04:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	 are you running on very low system resources?
2011-05-14T13:07:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	experiment with 11.04 just as it is.  You have WAY more than enough system resources to take care of it
2011-05-14T13:08:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	what would u suggest? i want it to be as minimal as possible - build ground-up or up-down?
2011-05-14T13:09:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	 your resources are vast and there's no reason to go minimal
2011-05-14T13:12:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	I think it is funny.... you are trying to install new items but then tell it NOT to install anything
2011-05-14T13:13:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	i thought if i run that it will just update/upgrade packages that are already installed and it won't install any extra package :?
2011-05-14T13:14:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	try just running the update and make it tell you what it suggests then delete anything or uncheck anything you don't want
2011-05-14T13:14:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	i
2011-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	ok thanks.. i'm just ran do-release-upgrade.. i'll build it from top-down if anything gets intalled that i don't want
2011-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	thats your best option.  Like I said.  You have a puter that will handle anything you give it right now
2011-05-14T13:21:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	u have wicd installed or some other network manager?
2011-05-14T13:25:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	firewall issue perhaps?
2011-05-14T13:25:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	Netwerk Connections .... the basic Ubuntu netwerk manager
2011-05-14T13:34:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	u have a strange setup... why do u want a static ip.. the easiest i can think of to reserve an ip is to configure ur router
2011-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	good for you buddy
2011-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	angheloko	_Anomaly	thanks.. now at 76%... afraid i can't help u much cos u have quite a unique situation there
2011-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	_Anomaly	angheloko	thanx buddy.  Yeah I like my setup.  I pay for nuttin and no one can figure out how I did it
