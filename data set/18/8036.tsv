2007-12-23T04:01:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	towlie	I've done it. You have to use the entire disk, I believe.
2007-12-23T04:01:00.000Z	towlie	Odd-rationale	well i installed it on my macbook and didnt use the entire disk
2007-12-23T04:02:00.000Z	towlie	Odd-rationale	but ive got a problem. i had to remove the boot arguements splash and quiet because if either one was used the screen went black and hung.
2007-12-23T04:03:00.000Z	towlie	Odd-rationale	ever since i removed those arguments it boots but without a loading gui
2007-12-23T04:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	towlie	So when you boot up, do you get GDM?
