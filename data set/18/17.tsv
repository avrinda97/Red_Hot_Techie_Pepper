2005-03-22T14:12:00.000Z	DarthFrog		Holy sheepshit, Batman.  I just thought I'd install xemacs for a looksee.  It wants 103 MB of disk space!! For an editor!!   Now that's bloat.
2005-03-22T14:14:00.000Z	DarthFrog		Well, vim actually.
2005-03-22T14:16:00.000Z	DarthFrog		Universe & mulitverse.
2005-03-22T14:17:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	emacs21
2005-03-22T14:17:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	use apt-cache search to find things
2005-03-22T14:17:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	Thanks!  Yeah, emacs21 is the ticket.
2005-03-22T14:19:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	Wow, "apt-cache search" seems just the ticket.  thanks.
2005-03-22T14:19:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	ubuntu has all kinds of tickets ;-) ;-)
2005-03-22T14:21:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	So I'm finding out.  :-)  I'm growing to like Ubuntu very much.  Especially now that KDE is available for it.
2005-03-30T12:01:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	ubuntu is more than just "desktop" debian :)
2005-03-30T12:02:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	How do you see it?
2005-03-30T12:03:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	it kicks butt for servers too, it just happens to have a really awesome desktop
2005-03-30T12:03:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	Not arguing against using Ubuntu for servers but why wouldn't you use regular Debian for that?
2005-03-30T12:04:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	because ubuntu is newer, has excellent security support, etc.
2005-03-30T12:04:00.000Z	jdub	DarthFrog	big difference betweeen warty and woody :)
2005-03-30T12:04:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	OK, I've not investigated that.
2005-03-30T12:05:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	Yeah, woody is old now.  But sarge isn't.
2005-03-30T12:07:00.000Z	DarthFrog	jdub	Let's agree, then, that Ubuntu makes for a truly excellent desktop Linux.
