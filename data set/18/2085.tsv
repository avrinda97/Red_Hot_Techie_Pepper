2010-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	clps		i use conky. but this code : ${downspeed eth0} is not working for wireles. can we add another clock for wireles and if possible for other connections types ? . thanks!
2010-08-22T20:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	for wireless you would need the wirless interface.. most likely wlan0
2010-08-22T20:49:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	 i try it but is not working on conky :(
2010-08-22T20:56:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	yes it does seem downspeed/upspeed has depreciated.
2010-08-22T20:56:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	? so ?
2010-08-22T20:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	try downspeedf and upspeedf
2010-08-22T21:00:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	 not working :(
2010-08-22T21:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	what does conky display when you use that?
2010-08-22T21:01:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	i have a small graph and a numeric value for down and up speed seperated...
2010-08-22T21:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	i understand that. what i'm asking is what does conky display when you use ${downspeedf wlan0}? is it blank output on conky or does it show an error?
2010-08-22T21:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	there is a #conky if i'm unhelpful :)
2010-08-22T21:07:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	 Down ${downspeed  downspeedf} k/s ${alignr}Up ${upspeed eth0} k/s
2010-08-22T21:08:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	${downspeed downspeedf} is incorrect. replace it with ${downspeedf eth0} or with wlan0  ..which ever interface you're trying to use.
2010-08-22T21:09:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	and the same with upspeed replace it with upspeedf
2010-08-22T21:10:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	dont look for first line. i m trying it now...
2010-08-22T21:24:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	i assume with your lack of further response that solved it issue?
2010-08-22T21:25:00.000Z	clps	bastid_raZor	conky chanlle solved it. my connection is eth1. but we dont know why ?
2010-08-22T21:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	clps	ahh, excellent. finding the right interface is always good :)
