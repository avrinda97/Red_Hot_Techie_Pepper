2011-02-08T18:50:00.000Z	giannis		Hi! i wrote a simple program in C...and i want it to run by pressing Alt+F2....but it runs only at the terminal...why? :/
2011-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	does your program have a graphical interface?
2011-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	no it's so simple
2011-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	but it has a while(1) statement
2011-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	then it's probably still running.. check a ps auxw
2011-02-08T18:53:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	$ps auxw?
2011-02-08T18:53:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	aye
2011-02-08T18:54:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	it's not there....it's not running
2011-02-08T18:54:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	strange
2011-02-08T18:56:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	it opened the program but in a terminal....i want to run it "silently".. like a daemon
2011-02-08T18:57:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	then it should work by launching it normally with alt+f2. probably your program exits for some reason.
2011-02-08T18:58:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	if i build a gui...it will be able to start it from the gui right?
2011-02-08T18:59:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	that's not the point. if you are programming a daemon, then it should definitely have no user interface.
2011-02-08T19:00:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	  int main()  {    load_settings();   while(1){   moveFiles();  sleep(5);   }     return 0;   }       that's the main
2011-02-08T19:01:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	you might be havnig segfaults within moveFiles()
2011-02-08T19:01:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	No cause it runs so fine at terminal....i tested that
2011-02-08T19:02:00.000Z	Sonne	giannis	i wouldn't know then
2011-02-08T19:02:00.000Z	giannis	Sonne	ok thank you
