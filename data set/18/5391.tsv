2008-11-02T01:54:00.000Z	raonid		can't install Intrepid because the installation doesn't recognize any of my partitions
2008-11-02T01:54:00.000Z	raonid		anyone?
2008-11-02T01:54:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	did you read the release notes about that?
2008-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	ok, thanks!
2008-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	i read something, didn't find an answer
2008-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	any link?
2008-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	are your partitions mounted?
2008-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	no
2008-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	not even swap?
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	don't know, I'm trying to install using an .iso direct from de hd
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	that's probably related
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	but I've always installed this way
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	but there's a bug in the installer this time
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	maybe you can try the alternate cd
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	I'm having problems exactly with the alternate
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	don't know then.  You may have to burn a cd
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	raonid	jrib	I'll try burning when I get one, but can you tell me about the bug on the installer?
2008-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	jrib	raonid	it's just what's on the release notes
