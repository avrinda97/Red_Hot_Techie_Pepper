2008-09-18T22:25:00.000Z	jedimindtrick		I have a mapped FTP (Places > connect to server), and im opening a file directly through that 'map', but i cannot seem to save the file in gedit through the shorthand map. however if i goto my home folder/.gvfs/my_mapped_place and save it through there, ti works just fine ... is there a "fix" to make it so that I can just save directly through the mapped setup rather than having to navigate to that folder ?
2008-09-18T22:27:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	it is not going to be stable working like that, expect to have file problems.. best to save locally then copy over
2008-09-18T22:27:00.000Z	jedimindtrick	ejer	its extremely inefficient considering what im doing, its just on my LAN anyway - i could use a suggestion on how to share my other computer's folders (also running ubuntu)
2008-09-18T22:28:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	share the folder and mount it on local machine, don't use fTP mapping if you can avoid it
2008-09-18T22:29:00.000Z	jedimindtrick	ejer	is there no network sharing native to ubuntu? seems a little backwards to have to install windows sharing services to share it, then connect to it through samba from another ubuntu box
2008-09-18T22:29:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	sure there is, just they built it in, you can right click a folder and share it
2008-09-18T22:29:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/nfs-server-and-client-configuration-in-ubuntu.html is for NFS mounts
2008-09-18T22:30:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	it is ok to install samba :)
2008-09-18T22:30:00.000Z	jedimindtrick	ejer	yeah but it just seems so backwards :)
2008-09-18T22:30:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	it works very well, it is a native linux app
2008-09-18T22:31:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	there are many other ways, this is just the easy way
2008-09-18T22:33:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	you need to add yourself to the sambashare group
2008-09-18T22:33:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	actually you may just need to log out and back in
2008-09-18T22:35:00.000Z	jedimindtrick	ejer	that seemed to work (loggin out/in)
2008-09-18T22:35:00.000Z	jedimindtrick	ejer	so how do i access this from the guest computer then ? i went to network but nothing is being listed ?
2008-09-18T22:35:00.000Z	ejer	jedimindtrick	new groups are not applied till you log back in
