2010-08-26T12:30:00.000Z	srv	AshDragon	any ideas?
2010-08-26T12:31:00.000Z	AshDragon		not right off.  can you view the ftp log and see if the remote system actually connects?
2010-08-26T12:31:00.000Z	AshDragon		it could be an authentication issue
2010-08-26T12:32:00.000Z	srv	AshDragon	i understand, but to change that
2010-08-26T12:33:00.000Z	srv	AshDragon	i love drama
2010-08-26T12:33:00.000Z	AshDragon	srv	look at the ftp log if you have access.  if the remote computer doesn't connect at all, it's a networking issue on either end.  if it doesn't authenticate, that's easy enough to fix.
2010-08-26T12:34:00.000Z	srv	AshDragon	where can i find ftp log?
2010-08-26T12:37:00.000Z	AshDragon	srv	i'm not sure right off.  (sorry, distracted)
