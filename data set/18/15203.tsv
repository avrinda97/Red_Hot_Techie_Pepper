2007-10-28T09:26:00.000Z	MFen		what's the command-line version of "update-manager -c -d" ?
2007-10-28T09:26:00.000Z	MFen		i want to upgrade a headless host to gutsy from the feisty
2007-10-28T09:27:00.000Z	MFen		i know i can a) edit sources.list  b) run apt-get dist-upgrade... but update-manager -c -d seems to do some other things. also, it's simpler (just a command, no manually configs editing) and thus is preferable to me
2007-10-28T09:27:00.000Z	MFen		is there an aptitude or apt-get equivalent of that?
2007-10-28T09:28:00.000Z	MFen		no X.
2007-10-28T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	MFen	no there isn't
2007-10-28T09:29:00.000Z	MFen	nickrud	ok, thanks
2007-10-28T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	MFen	server?
2007-10-28T09:29:00.000Z	MFen	nickrud	yeah
2007-10-28T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	MFen	then you have no choice :)
2007-10-28T09:29:00.000Z	MFen	nickrud	does update-manager -c -d do anything other than edit sources.list for you?
2007-10-28T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	MFen	yes, at the least it makes sure that ubuntu-desktop is installed. Doesn't apply to you.
2007-10-28T09:30:00.000Z	MFen	nickrud	aha. thanks. :)
2008-02-12T08:32:00.000Z	MFen	nickrud	no worries.
