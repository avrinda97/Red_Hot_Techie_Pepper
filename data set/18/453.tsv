2012-08-06T23:14:00.000Z	Kingsy		ok guys, I have just installed the propriety AMD catalyst control drivers from AMD directly.. however lspci -k | grep VGA still says I am using 03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Barts PRO [ATI Radeon HD 6800 Series]   <-- which is still the open ones right?? does that mean i am not using the correct driver?
2012-08-06T23:15:00.000Z	Kingsy		shouldnt it be fglrx or whatever its called?
2012-08-06T23:15:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	that output does not show the driver name.  Only the hardware name
2012-08-06T23:15:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	fglrx is the proprietary driver name
2012-08-06T23:16:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	lspci -k does show driver names.  But what you posted here in the channel does not appear to list the driver in use.
2012-08-06T23:16:00.000Z	Kingsy	deadmund	so how do you check to see what driver you are currently using? to make sure you are using the propriety one?
2012-08-06T23:17:00.000Z	Kingsy		sorry I thought that lspci -k showed that module you were currently using
2012-08-06T23:17:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	lspci -k   (but sometimes that lies) the BEST way is to look at lsmod.  lsmod's output is very large so use grep
2012-08-06T23:17:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	read what I said.  lspci -k  does show the driver.  But you did not paste enough of the output to show the driver name here in the channel.
2012-08-06T23:18:00.000Z	Kingsy	deadmund	oh ok.. let me have another look
2012-08-06T23:18:00.000Z	Kingsy		oh yeah Kernel driver in use: fglrx_pci
2012-08-06T23:19:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	there ya go
2012-08-06T23:19:00.000Z	Kingsy	deadmund	still.. I am not happy with the driver.. the output on the 3rd monitor isnt full screen
2012-08-06T23:19:00.000Z	Kingsy		it was with the open radeon drivers
2012-08-06T23:19:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	so then use the open source drivers?
2012-08-06T23:20:00.000Z	Kingsy	deadmund	the performance was HORRENDUS
2012-08-06T23:20:00.000Z	Kingsy	deadmund	like so bad even screensavers were jumpy.. heh
2012-08-06T23:20:00.000Z	deadmund	Kingsy	well pick the one that you think is best
