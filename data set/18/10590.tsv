2007-09-08T08:35:00.000Z	shwouchk		I can't get either of ralink 2500 cards (usb&pci) to work... I followed the guides... help? please?
2007-09-08T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	 what is a ralink card ?
2007-09-08T08:36:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	a ralink based wifi card
2007-09-08T08:36:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	ralink chipset
2007-09-08T08:36:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	 did you try with ndiswrapper ?
2007-09-08T08:36:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	not really an option
2007-09-08T08:37:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	why not ? donT' they have a windows driver ?
2007-09-08T08:38:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	no, I can't get it into the box
2007-09-08T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	 put the install cd in ,  you should get a msg asking if you want to use it as  a repos ,  say yes,  then you can install ndiswrapper from apt-get / synaptic  if that doesn't work,  browse the install cd,  under  /pool/man/N
2007-09-08T08:41:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	the only way to get a net connection is via the wifi cards which aren't working
2007-09-08T08:41:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	 ndiswrapper in on the install cd,  you don'T need to get it over the internet
2007-09-08T08:42:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	I do need the windows drivers
2007-09-08T08:42:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	 the cd that came with the card ?
2007-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	that might work.. how would I extract the drivers off the EXE though?
2007-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	how are you getting on the internet atm ?  can't you get the drivers from the intenet and then transfer then to linux using eitehr a fat32 partiton or a flash driver or something ?
2007-09-08T08:44:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	you might be able to extract the .exe with the archive manager in ubuntu but I am not srue
2007-09-08T08:45:00.000Z	shwouchk	Pelo	I use it on another box which does have linux.. no way to move the data though
2007-09-08T08:46:00.000Z	Pelo	shwouchk	I'm sure you can figure something out , I 'm hoping that you are a resourcefull individual
