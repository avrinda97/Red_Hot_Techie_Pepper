2009-12-01T00:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	isolat3dsh33p	GNU/Linux doesn't care about file extensions. But you could use .sh if you really needed one
2009-12-01T00:37:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	ardchoille	thanks :D
2009-12-12T15:48:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	ardchoille	there is?
2009-12-12T15:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	isolat3dsh33p	yes, I've used it
2009-12-12T15:49:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	ardchoille	for folder? what is it called?
2009-12-12T15:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	isolat3dsh33p	not for folder, for alt+tabbing
2009-12-12T15:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	isolat3dsh33p	switching apps (ALT+TAB)
2009-12-12T15:51:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	ardchoille	you mean the super+tab?
2009-12-12T15:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	isolat3dsh33p	no, press alt+tab on your keyboard
2009-12-12T15:53:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	ardchoille	I does different things. Maybe my key bindings configured different from your :D
2009-12-12T15:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	isolat3dsh33p	perhaps
