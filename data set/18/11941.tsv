2007-06-27T14:46:00.000Z	arooni		whats a good media plaeyr
2007-06-27T14:46:00.000Z	arooni		i want a winamp linke player
2007-06-27T14:47:00.000Z	arooni		but i also want to be able to have the app scan my entire comp for media
2007-06-27T14:47:00.000Z	arooni		so i can have a media library
2007-06-27T14:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	then perhaps you want rhythmbox
2007-06-27T14:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	probably not a lot of point in doing that
2007-06-27T14:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	'cos there are lots of native mp3 players in Linux
2007-06-27T14:49:00.000Z	arooni	gordonjcp	can any mentioned play files on NTFS drives/ scan files on NTFS drives?
2007-06-27T14:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	that's a different problem
2007-06-27T14:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	you need to mount the ntfs drive
2007-06-27T14:51:00.000Z	arooni	gordonjcp	but i can double click and play files on those drives
2007-06-27T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	then the drives are mounted
2007-06-27T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	you're pretty much there, in that case
2007-08-04T14:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	it's possible
2008-07-17T13:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	that means it's being treated as a serial port
2008-07-17T13:43:00.000Z	arooni	gordonjcp	ok how do i use it?
2008-07-17T13:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arooni	no idea, I don't have a pocketpc
2008-07-17T13:43:00.000Z	arooni	gordonjcp	it has a microsd card in it
