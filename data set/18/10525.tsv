2009-05-11T00:52:00.000Z	bercik		but its funny but there is nothing like this
2009-05-11T00:53:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	did you install the compizconfig-settings-manager?
2009-05-11T00:53:00.000Z	bercik	Slart	no, ikonia told me that it will be installed by default
2009-05-11T00:53:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	I'm not sure if the settings manager is.. compiz is installed by default though
2009-05-11T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	just try running "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager" in a terminal
2009-05-11T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	I think by default you can only chose between, no effects at all (ie compiz disabled), some effects or "enable everything, with extra fireworks.. and little frogs.. and lightning.. etc"
2009-05-11T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	if you install the settings manager you can be a little more detailed about how you want it to work
2009-05-11T00:56:00.000Z	bercik	Slart	so how do i enable all the fireworks frogs and stuff? :)
2009-05-11T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	in system, preferences, appearance.. in the last tab..
2009-05-11T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	it's called Visual Effects
2009-05-11T00:57:00.000Z	bercik	Slart	works :)
2009-05-11T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	greak
2009-05-11T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	in the settings manager you can enable some more stuff if you want it.. I really think it should be installed by default.. I don't really understand why it isn't
2009-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	bercik	Slart	and do You know the managers package name?
2009-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	it's the one I told you about.. compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	bercik	Slart	thanks again and sorry
2009-05-11T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	bercik	no worries
