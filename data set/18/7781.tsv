2007-12-24T12:14:00.000Z	ere4si		I'm trying to install the java plugin for firefox and the link I make to the java lib is always broken - how do I get it to work pls?
2007-12-24T12:15:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	install java from the package mamner
2007-12-24T12:15:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	done that and had no luck... - still no plugin
2007-12-24T12:17:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	well theres also firefox plugins
2007-12-24T12:18:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	that always sends me to manual install - and I can only make broken links...
2007-12-24T12:18:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	did you try synaptic?
2007-12-24T12:19:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	yep - and it installed java1.4 and gave me no plugin - I've enabled java in firefox's preferences
2007-12-24T12:20:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	what about the java website?
2007-12-24T12:21:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	that's where the manual install takes me
2007-12-24T12:21:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	got java 1.6 from there
2007-12-24T12:22:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	w8 if you got it, y do u need to manually install it?
2007-12-24T12:23:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	I need to link the java plugin to firefox - and every time I make the link it is broken
2007-12-24T12:23:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	firefox has its own plugins tho
2007-12-24T12:24:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	but trying to install them says I need to manually install - that takes me to sun - and .... broken link
2007-12-24T12:25:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	really? tahts odd, i got it through firefox's own plugins without having to manually install anything. sorry i dunno why that would happen
2007-12-24T12:25:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	thnx for you efforts :)
2007-12-24T12:33:00.000Z	ere4si	pvl1	learnt a lesson - copied and pasted the commands to install java - sun calls the file .s0 when it is .so - it's installed now !
2007-12-24T12:34:00.000Z	pvl1	ere4si	lol, well then congrats.
