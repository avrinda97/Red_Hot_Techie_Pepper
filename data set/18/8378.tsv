2007-08-31T07:11:00.000Z	riotkittie		err.  im trying to toss dapper onto a spare partition, using the live cd. when i get to setting up partitions, gparted spits out errors about one of my many fat32 partitions having errors.  i have chkdsk /f'ed drives C, D, G, H and I. WinXP reports that theyre all fine. :| Also, it's spitting out a message about partition 0,0,0.  does that make sense to anyone? :P
2007-08-31T07:11:00.000Z	riotkittie		could my problem stem from the fact that i am trying to install to an external eSATA drive? or should that not be an issue?
2007-08-31T07:12:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	partition 0 is the mbr
2007-08-31T07:12:00.000Z	riotkittie		warbler > why would it be seeing my mobo as a partition?
2007-08-31T07:13:00.000Z	riotkittie	IndyGunFreak	i was thinking that :P  but i was hoping that was not the case. thank youuuuuuuuu.
2007-08-31T07:13:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	the mbr - master boot record - is the first section on hard drive
2007-08-31T07:13:00.000Z	riotkittie		errr i dont know why i typed mobo
2007-08-31T07:13:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	can you - in bios - select to boot from usb?
2007-08-31T07:14:00.000Z	riotkittie		warbler > of course i can but why would i do that?
2007-08-31T07:14:00.000Z	riotkittie		She. <cough>
2007-08-31T07:15:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	how do you - at boot - get the comp to recognise the external drive - that is what you want - yes?
2007-08-31T07:15:00.000Z	riotkittie		warbler > the computer recognizes the drive fine at boot.
2007-08-31T07:16:00.000Z	riotkittie		my issue is that gparted is telling me there are errors with a fat partition, and then saying something about 0,0,0
2007-08-31T07:17:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	sounds like your master boot record is broke - have same prob - gparted only sees my disk as mt
2007-08-31T07:18:00.000Z	riotkittie		if my MBR was broke, wouldnt i have issue booting into the Win OS and 2 distros that i've got installed?
2007-08-31T07:19:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	I triple boot with no probs - just can't change partitions cause gparted can't see them
2007-08-31T07:20:00.000Z	riotkittie		it seems to pick my partitions up without a hitch. theyre all listed, and everything it list is correct.
2007-08-31T07:20:00.000Z	warbler	riotkittie	what's the error about partition 0:0:0...
