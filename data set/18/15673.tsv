2005-02-10T15:30:00.000Z	bzbb		why an ISA SB pro 2
2005-02-10T15:32:00.000Z	bzbb		and we are all windows based
2005-02-10T15:32:00.000Z	bzbb		so I need to keep in touch with such things
2005-02-10T15:34:00.000Z	bzbb		we are addeding OS x soonsih though
2005-02-10T15:34:00.000Z	bzbb		in the near future, we are going to have an all digital setup
2005-02-10T15:35:00.000Z	bzbb		thats about all
2005-02-10T15:35:00.000Z	spiffy	bzbb	you wanna buy him one? ;-)
2005-02-10T15:35:00.000Z	bzbb		no, but i have a bunch in a box in my basement
2005-02-10T15:36:00.000Z	spiffy		ahh well, not everyone is so fortunate.
2005-02-10T15:37:00.000Z	bzbb	spiffy	true, but, ISA?
2005-02-10T15:37:00.000Z	spiffy		its in the defualt kernel, so why not use it if you got it?
2005-02-10T15:37:00.000Z	bzbb		if you can get it working
2005-02-10T15:38:00.000Z	spiffy	bzbb	ive gottenw weirder things than ISA working ;-)
2005-02-10T15:38:00.000Z	bzbb		I do have a 286 running dos 3.3 with a working soundblaster 8 bit and an ethernet card in it
2005-02-10T15:38:00.000Z	bzbb		that was a pain setting up
2005-02-10T15:39:00.000Z	spiffy	bzbb	that sounds similiar to kurtos's set up. I was helping him last night. drivers load and all that, but alsa cant find any cards.
2005-02-10T15:40:00.000Z	bzbb		well, setting up an SB 8 bit on dos 3.3 is a bit different than using ubuntu, I should hope
2005-02-10T15:40:00.000Z	spiffy	bzbb	thank god. Just wondering if its not some weird irq problem.
