2011-06-20T10:30:00.000Z	velofille		heya anyone awake who can help diagnose a problem (preferably somebody with higher level linux experiance or debugging)
2011-06-20T10:31:00.000Z	velofille		my Dell studio 17" is just freezing randomly since installing 11.04 - reinstalled fresh and same problem, used both ubuntu and kubuntu
2011-06-20T10:32:00.000Z	velofille		nothing in any error logs that i can see, terminals are open and gkrellm running, and it literally just freezes with no slow down or error messages
2011-06-20T10:34:00.000Z	velofille		so anyone know of any bugs or problems or help on debugging?
2011-06-20T10:35:00.000Z	velofille		i personally think its related to touchpad, never happens when im not using it. and usually happens when im using the touchpad
2011-06-20T10:37:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	when it freezes, then you click on the touchpad button, are you able to resume normal operations
2011-06-20T10:37:00.000Z	velofille	jkbrntot	nope, nothing fixes it other than hard reset
2011-06-20T10:39:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	freezing does not occur in previous ubuntu versions?  which versions have you tried?
2011-06-20T11:18:00.000Z	velofille	jkbrntot	nope it did not happen in previous versions. Only started with Natty. I am debating installing debian or an older ubuntu to take hardware out of the equation
2011-06-20T11:24:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	sounds delicious.  im gonna go eat now.. made me hungry...
2011-06-20T11:24:00.000Z	velofille	jkbrntot	it was actually - nachos complete with bacon, sour cream, cheese, etc
2011-06-20T11:25:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	yeah trying another kernel or distro or version would narrow it down
2011-06-20T11:25:00.000Z	velofille	jkbrntot	its the whole ass of backing it all up and reinstalling - im so lazy :)
2011-06-20T11:26:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	yeah...  install on another partition (still need to backup)?  try liveCD?  liveUSB?
2011-06-20T11:28:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	choose yes?  you mean the upgrade?   also doing a clean install (of 11.04) fixes some of the bugs.     lucky you have lots of hdd space on hand
2011-06-20T11:30:00.000Z	velofille	jkbrntot	on the 2nd install of kubuntu i opted 'yes' for encrypted home dirs, but ended up not being able to use some of my files due to long filenames
2011-06-20T11:30:00.000Z	velofille	jkbrntot	256chars is the limit, but if you have 36 chars and encrypt it, it makes it a whole lot longer, so reduces file name char limit
2011-06-20T11:32:00.000Z	jkbrntot	velofille	ah complexities... good to know, tnx for sharing
