2009-04-07T02:34:00.000Z	DieseL`		hi, anyone know of a way of setting monochrome fonts for gnome terminal
2009-04-07T02:34:00.000Z	DieseL`		irssi looks teribble with all these horrid smooth fonts
2009-04-07T02:36:00.000Z	DieseL`		anyone know of a way of setting monochrome fonts for gnome terminal
2009-04-07T02:36:00.000Z	DieseL`		no hinting etc.
2009-04-07T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	try changing the font.. or not using the gnome-terminal
2009-04-07T02:37:00.000Z	DieseL`	Slart	there must be a way of setting it?
2009-04-07T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	try starting xterm
2009-04-07T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	it's gnome.. the decision has been made for you =)
2009-04-07T02:39:00.000Z	DieseL`	Slart	this is nice and all, but any way to reconfigure xterm?
2009-04-07T02:39:00.000Z	DieseL`		translucent BG etc?
2009-04-07T02:39:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	reconfigure? I think there is a settings file somewhere.. but I'm not really sure.. haven't used xterm in.. oh.. 10 years or so =)
2009-04-07T02:40:00.000Z	DieseL`	Slart	lol fair enough, erm how about setting xterm as the default for ubuntu
2009-04-07T02:41:00.000Z	DieseL`		cd /etc/
2009-04-07T02:41:00.000Z	DieseL`		ls
2009-04-07T02:41:00.000Z	DieseL`		oooppps
2009-04-07T02:42:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	I'm not sure where the default terminal is used.. you could change the one shortcut in system, accessories to use xterm instead of gnome-terminal
2009-04-07T02:42:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	oh.. you mean like when you double click a sh-script..
2009-04-07T02:44:00.000Z	Slart	DieseL`	create a script, right click on it, select "open with" might change some of the associations.. not sure if that is the best way though
