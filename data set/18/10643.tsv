2007-07-11T11:09:00.000Z	NoobSauce		I just installed the latest feisty on my comp, and I can only type in all caps. I tried keyboard auto-detect, and it pinned it as us layout (which is correct I'm pretty sure). I tried doing a ctrl-alt-f1 to type in terminal, and there, the keyboard works as expected. Also, the keyboard works fine with other ubuntu boxes running feisty... any ideas what could be wrong with the xserver setup?
2007-07-11T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	Can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-07-11T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	It hasn't "come out" it's still beta
2007-07-11T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	It may be that it will be more stable, but I doubt that it is now
2007-07-11T11:33:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	compiz just never worked well for me, it hosed all my xservers. Beryl is pretty good, although running it on integrated intel graphics is pretty taxing for my laptop... it crashes a lot due to heat...
2007-07-11T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	Did you follow the isntructions @ wiki.com/Macbook ?
2007-07-11T11:38:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	yeah, that saved my arse!
2007-07-11T11:42:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	I have macbook (not pro). Those systems are basically identical
2007-07-11T11:49:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	I don't think you can turn it off. You just have to turn the sensitivity of the mouse activating to a lower value (I forget what the setting is)
2007-12-03T04:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	Do you have more than one GPU?
2007-12-03T04:51:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	It's possible. This is a multimedia motherboard... I'll look it up
2007-12-03T04:55:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	So the motherboard is an ASUS M2A-VM HDMI motherboard. It has DVI, as well as analog out + a card with HDMI out. I'm thinking it might have multiple GPUs (one for the HDMI, one for everything else). If that's the case, what difference does it make? Vesa shouldn't go through any of the GPUs, right? It's CPU-only from what I understand (?)
2007-12-03T04:56:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	Actually, I'm virtually certain there would have to be multiple GPUs, so I'm going to just unplug the HDMI card and eliminate that as a potential problem
2007-12-03T04:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	VESA should always work, but for some reason it sometimes doesn't. Most of the times I have heard about it not working were from people with multiple GPU's
2007-12-03T04:58:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	IndyGunFreak: This would be a first as well. I've understood vesa to basically not use the GPU at all, but rely 100% on CPU rendering... So it'd be odd that the GPUs would in any way affect things...
2007-12-03T05:00:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	If it's indeed the multiple GPUs causing a problem, This could be a big problem since this is supposed to be a multimedia box! :P I'm not sure what would happen if it works without the other GPU :P
2007-12-03T05:01:00.000Z	NoobSauce	Jordan_U	LjL: IndyGunFreak: So without the HDMI-out card, it works... I'm unsure what I can do about this though... maybe this is a motherboard issue... /me -> forums
2007-12-03T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NoobSauce	There is a way in your Xorg.conf to specify a specific PCI BUS ( I don't remember how ), that might get it working
