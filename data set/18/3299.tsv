2009-11-14T09:46:00.000Z	dogon		Hello, I'm having a little problem with running 32-bit executables on 64-bit ubuntu... my teacher has compiled a 32-bit c++ executable and I can't run it.  Isn't there backward compatability with the 64-bit OS? Do I have to do something "special" to get it running?

2009-11-14T09:50:00.000Z	Blue1	dogon	what is it then a bin file?
2009-11-14T09:51:00.000Z	Blue1	dogon	well what are you try to run - what is the file extension?
2009-11-14T09:52:00.000Z	dogon	Blue1	there is no file extention, but when I type 'file referee' (referee is the name of the file) it gives me the following info: " ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel... blah blah"
