2009-07-05T02:58:00.000Z	Klarth		Would anyone mind helping me?
2009-07-05T02:59:00.000Z	Klarth		Okay, basically, I can't run live disks
2009-07-05T02:59:00.000Z	Klarth		for Ubuntu 9.04
2009-07-05T02:59:00.000Z	Klarth		I can install it normally
2009-07-05T02:59:00.000Z	Klarth		Also, I can run Ubuntu 8.x live disks
2009-07-05T03:01:00.000Z	Klarth		but, more importantly, I'm running ubuntu 9.04 right now, and I firefox refuses to open, something about directory possibly having read or write problems, because of a potentially full disk. I'm guessing it's referring to the root directory, because I can't install updates because apparently there's "not enough space in '/'"
2009-07-05T03:02:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	how large is your harddisk?
2009-07-05T03:03:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	could you pls paste the output of `df -t`
2009-07-05T03:05:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	df -T
2009-07-05T03:07:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	there's a utility called pastebinit - `sudo apt-get install pastebinit`
2009-07-05T03:08:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	so after you install pastebinit, run df -T | pastebinit
2009-07-05T03:08:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	clearly your root partition is full
2009-07-05T03:10:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	Applications > Accessories > Disk Usage Analyzer
2009-07-05T03:19:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	what is x?
2009-07-05T03:20:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	how did you install it? how are you trying to delete it?
2009-07-05T03:21:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	moving to trash does not free any disk space, and, what is the file location?
2009-07-05T03:22:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	apparently a different drive. the output from your `df -hT` will help.
2009-07-05T03:22:00.000Z	dragon_	Klarth	also try `cd /home; du -sh * | pastebinit`
