2010-07-03T03:58:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Looking it up now...

2010-07-03T04:03:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	So after updating grub, burg is gone?  Is that it?
2010-07-03T04:04:00.000Z	NitzchONot	maxwellian	yes, i updated GRUB2 today and after the reboot, my BURG's gone :<
2010-07-03T04:04:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Is it actually uninstalled?  Or just not running on startup?
2010-07-03T04:06:00.000Z	NitzchONot	maxwellian	no, it's installed.. it didnt got removed. It just got 'overwritten' by GRUB and doesnt load anymore.
2010-07-03T04:06:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Looking here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Burg/  it seems burg-install might be your answer...
2010-07-03T04:08:00.000Z	NitzchONot	maxwellian	thanks. Im gonna reboot (damn thats the only way :< ) and i'll come back with the results.. thanks for your time :D
2010-07-03T04:08:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Hold on...
2010-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Is burg-emu of any use?
2010-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	NitzchONot	maxwellian	Dont think so, it just emulates how burg will look.
2010-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Okay, good luck!
2010-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	NitzchONot	maxwellian	cheers, thanks :)
2010-07-03T04:11:00.000Z	NitzchONot	maxwellian	thanks mate, "burg-install" worked! Cheers:D
2010-07-03T04:12:00.000Z	maxwellian	NitzchONot	Great news!  Have fun!
