2010-04-11T08:54:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	did you try apt-get —reinstalling the kernel?
2010-04-11T08:55:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	no, i don't think so... what command do i run? apt-get -reinstalling?
2010-04-11T08:56:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	 sudo apt-get —reinstall linux-generic
2010-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	while chrooted
2010-04-11T09:00:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	the line theadmin gave you is correct… linux-generic should install the headers and the image
2010-04-11T09:03:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	i hate to ask the obvious but you apt-get updated first?
2010-04-11T09:04:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	yeah
2010-04-11T09:07:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	there's an article here about wxpython causing apt-get -f install to error: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=184446
2010-04-11T09:07:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	 try apt-get -f remove wxpython2.5.3 or whatever your version number is
2010-04-11T09:12:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	thanks, reading the link.  i get the same error when i try that
2010-04-11T09:13:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	did you try apt-get purging after removing the wxpython thing?
2010-04-11T09:15:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	not sure how to do that
2010-04-11T09:16:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	give this a shot… "sudo apt-get clean ; apt-get -f install ; apt-get -f install linux-generic"
2010-04-11T09:17:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	i get "E: Couldn't find package linux-generic
2010-04-11T09:18:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	try theadmin's version, using apt-get -f install linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
2010-04-11T09:18:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	i did it that way, too
2010-04-11T09:24:00.000Z	bribroder	asdf123	try linux-rt instead
2010-04-11T09:25:00.000Z	asdf123	bribroder	same :/
