2006-05-26T09:06:00.000Z	anjin_		Dumbass ATI cards.  I had to unplug the PC to reboot.. now I can get to a esktop.  Why now when not before?  Damned if I know... thanks for all the help guys.  I'm still a Linux noob, but I'm learning!  Ubuntu is on my laptop and I use it on an ancient PII as a file server.  If TheGIMP ever gets as powerful and usable as Photoshop, I may make the switch 100% :)
2006-05-26T09:08:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	pantone is a big problem for gimp
2006-05-26T10:42:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	there should be a howto at tldp.org, dunno how out of date it is
2006-05-26T10:43:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	: Thanks, I'll take a look at that
2006-05-26T10:53:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	wacom should be well supported; I used an old serial one a while back
2006-05-26T10:55:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	Perhaps, but the link you gave me was - to be frank - way over my head.  I found a few links on google that pointed to a Wacom on Linux page on sourceforge.  I downloaded a package from there and tried running the install-sh, but nothing happened
2006-05-26T11:00:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	never ;)
2006-05-26T11:00:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	ntfs needs some umask stuff in /etc/fstab I believe - sorry to be vague, but I don't use it
2006-05-26T11:02:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	: Thanks.. I'll check out the Ubuntu forums for ntfs support.  Any ideas on my k3b problem would be appreciated though :)
2006-05-26T11:02:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	sorry, don't use it
2006-05-26T11:02:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	: Ok, thanks anyway though :)
2006-05-26T11:09:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	even after they closed darwin? not that too many cared, I suppose
2006-05-26T11:09:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	if you want bsd, you know where to find it ;)
2006-05-26T11:10:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	: Yeah, but BSD doesn't run Adobe appz :)
2006-05-27T10:51:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	you have to log out and in again if you add yourself to a group, for it to be effective; type groups in a term to see what groups you are currently in
2006-05-27T10:52:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	- the groups command shows me in the cdrom group.
2006-05-27T10:52:00.000Z	amphi	anjin_	good
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	anjin_	amphi	- I added myself to the cdrom group before logging into this session, so it should work already... but does not.
