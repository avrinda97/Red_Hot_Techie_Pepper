2005-11-21T16:01:00.000Z	rowanjl		ok people, I think we need to ask zxsykco what his current problem is and start over.
2005-11-21T16:02:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	He's trying to install nvidia drivers
2005-11-21T16:02:00.000Z	rowanjl	polpak	thats not his problem
2005-11-21T16:02:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	his problem is he's fsked up his xorg.conf and cannot get it working
2005-11-21T16:03:00.000Z	rowanjl	polpak	getting warmer, but that still won't help
2005-11-21T16:03:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	we told him to dpkg reconfig it
2005-11-21T16:03:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	which he was, but stopped when he was asked where his video card was
2005-11-21T16:05:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	what is your problem?
2005-11-21T16:07:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	what was the error?
2006-01-09T13:43:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	are you using the ubuntu repo for wine, or the winehq one?
2006-01-09T13:43:00.000Z	rowanjl	polpak	the repo
2006-01-09T13:43:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	winehq is a repo also
2006-01-09T13:45:00.000Z	rowanjl	polpak	its from the Binary Universe repo, I've not added any others
2006-01-09T13:49:00.000Z	rowanjl	polpak	er, did you have any ideas?
2006-01-09T13:50:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	I usually just install the winehq repo, sudo apt-get install wine winetools, then run winetools to download all the required MS libs etc
2006-01-09T13:50:00.000Z	rowanjl	polpak	I'll try that thanks
2006-01-09T13:50:00.000Z	polpak	rowanjl	I play wesnoth, vendetta online, and qgo
