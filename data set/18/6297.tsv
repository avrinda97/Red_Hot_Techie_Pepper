2008-05-27T19:20:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer		what command can i use with apt-cache, or a similar command to see the files provided by a given package?
2008-05-27T19:20:00.000Z	hoggie	wirelessdreamer	: try apt-cache search "bla"
2008-05-27T19:21:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer	hoggie	search only checks package names, it doesn't say what files are provided, so i can't find where it gets installed to
2008-05-27T19:22:00.000Z	hoggie	wirelessdreamer	: i didnt get what you wanna do? you want to check which pkg's need to be installed also when installing a specific pkg? or where its installed too?
2008-05-27T19:23:00.000Z	hoggie		Hey.. which application allows me to add subtitles to a movie? (to play it together and also to create a new file with vid+subtitles)??
2008-05-27T19:23:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer	hoggie	no i want th check what files get installed when i install a package, like where it puts its binaries and config files
2008-05-27T19:25:00.000Z	hoggie	wirelessdreamer	: hmm.. i dont know how to check that.. i just know that usually u can find it in /usr/sbin /usr/share /sbin
2008-05-27T19:25:00.000Z	hoggie		!subtitles
2008-05-27T19:26:00.000Z	hoggie		how can i inject subtitles to a movie file??

2008-05-27T19:29:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer	hoggie	thats why i need to find out what it installs, no command runs it, its web browser based
2008-05-27T19:29:00.000Z	hoggie		how can i inject subtitles to a movie file??
2008-05-27T19:30:00.000Z	hoggie	wirelessdreamer	: whats the name of it? you cab find / -name <filename>
2008-05-27T19:30:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer	hoggie	package is called roundcore-webmail
2008-05-27T19:31:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer	hoggie	using find still won't tell me if it installed a file that doesn't have that name in it
2008-05-27T19:31:00.000Z	wirelessdreamer	hoggie	did you try apt-cache search subtitle? a big list comes up for it, i've never tried any of them before though
2008-05-27T19:33:00.000Z	hoggie	wirelessdreamer	: hmm im afraid i cant help you then, try googling for the same problem and see what the search produces, you can be amazed sometimes how a specific problem happens to another fraustrated buddy! and i didnt try it. cause i wanted to see which is recomended instead of trying them all before :) but thanks i think ill do that after all :)
