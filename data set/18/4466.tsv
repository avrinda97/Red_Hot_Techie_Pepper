2009-10-17T01:39:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		How can I use gksudo something to edit files on a server with a graphical application on my computer?
2009-10-17T01:41:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	you need to open the connectio to the remote machine with ssh -X ... - (capital X)
2009-10-17T01:42:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	I thought that required X on the server (which would be unusual)
2009-10-17T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	it would require the actual program (for instance gedit), not an X server
2009-10-17T01:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	as Ronnie just said, but don't use graphical programs with sudo
2009-10-17T01:45:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	Ronnie: Thanks, I think I'll copy the file so I own it, edit with a graphical application then copy it back
2009-10-17T01:46:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	easy enough done - use scp for the copying
2009-10-17T01:48:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	trism: ANY good editor will let you edit over sftp (etc) - the issue is you do so as yourself, not as root, so you cannot edit root's files except with copying or changing permissions
2009-10-17T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	from experience I prefer changing the ownership on the remote machine, but in such a case I would simply use a non GUI editor
2009-10-17T01:51:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	I wouldn't change permissions/ownership on the original though - copy it, do your work, then copy it back
2009-10-17T01:53:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	of course - I assumed as much :) , but still: is the task so big that you don't want to use nano or joe or vi(m) ?
2009-10-17T01:54:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	Yes.
2009-12-03T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	try with dig -x IP
2009-12-03T01:43:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	cool, I'll read the man page
2009-12-03T01:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	dig is the standard dns tool under linux - so that time will be well spent :)
2009-12-10T00:50:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	another one: getent passwd
2009-12-16T02:00:00.000Z	guntbert	Mike_lifeguard	on karmic rsyslogd is used
2009-12-16T02:00:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	guntbert	ok, I'll double-check I've modified the right one...
