2009-09-08T16:32:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	Would you like to install lubuntu?
2009-09-08T16:32:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	Or do you already have Ubuntu and want Lxde?
2009-09-08T16:32:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	Why can't it install ubuntu?
2009-09-08T16:34:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	There isn't an 'Install' button on the desktop?
2009-09-08T16:35:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	Where did you get it from?
2009-09-08T16:42:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	This is simple to get what you want. Get the 9.04 Xubuntu liveCD, install that, add the Lxde package. You're done, it works, it's upgradable.
2009-09-08T16:43:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	It is capable of installing Xubuntu.
2009-09-08T16:45:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	lubuntu	How about this, when you ask for advice? you take it. That'd be nice.
