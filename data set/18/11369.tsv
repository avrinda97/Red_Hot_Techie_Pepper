2006-09-22T14:33:00.000Z	Enselic		How do I kill old links created with ln?
2006-09-22T14:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	rm
2006-09-22T14:36:00.000Z	Enselic	eyequeue	is there an easy way to locate where the link is?
2006-09-22T14:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	i'm not sure i understand.  you have some link you want to get rid of but don't know where it is?  how do you know you have it?
2006-09-22T14:38:00.000Z	Enselic	eyequeue	When I try to run 'anjuta' it says can not find '/usr/bin/anjuta'   and when I cd /usr/local/bin (the right place for anjuta) and do ln -s anjuta anjuta, it says 'anjuta already exists'
2006-09-22T14:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	okay, syntax error :)  but why isn't /usr/local/bin/ in your path?  a user should *not* be messing in /usr/bin/ that is the exclusive domain of the package management system
2006-09-22T14:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	i can tell you how to do the symlink, but i want to be sure you know it's unwise
2006-09-22T14:41:00.000Z	Enselic	eyequeue	/usr/local/bin is in my path, but I think the old anjuta link is somewhere as well
2006-09-22T14:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	ln -s /original/file/with/path /place/you/want/the/symlink
2006-09-22T14:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	first though, run this, as non-root
2006-09-22T14:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	"which anjuta" and tell me what the output is please
2006-09-22T14:45:00.000Z	Enselic	eyequeue	Hmm, this is strange, 'which anjuta' gives '/usr/local/bin' while 'anjuta' gives 'bash: /usr/bin/anjuta: No such file or directory'
2006-09-22T14:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	i think you may have had something in /usr/bin at login, let's see if it is gone, then i can fix tha for you
2006-09-22T14:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	ls /usr/bin/anjuta, see if it sees anything
2006-09-22T14:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	if there is nothing there now, try logging out and back in, that should clear the error
2006-09-22T14:48:00.000Z	Enselic	eyequeue	it's nothing there, I try to login and out
2006-09-22T14:50:00.000Z	Enselic	eyequeue	it works now, thank you very much for you help :)
2006-09-22T14:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	Enselic	glad that fixed it :)  np
