2008-07-14T20:15:00.000Z	andare		i do have ubuntu
2008-07-14T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	there is no package for it as I recall, you have to remove it by hand
2008-07-14T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	manually remove the files you installed
2008-07-14T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	that is one of the downsides of not using package managed software
2008-07-14T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	that doesn't change anything
2008-07-14T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	an OS is as secure as the user who maintains it, ubuntu and any linux distro can be very unsecure
2008-07-14T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	this is not the channel to discuss it, join #ubuntu-offtopic for general discussion, and you can also read up on some generic white papers on security to explain the differences
2008-07-14T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	an ubuntu OS support channel
2008-07-14T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	that depends on the reason it's slow, you need to diagnose why it's slow
2008-07-14T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	overclocking is a bad idea
2008-07-14T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	and is not something that is a topic in this channel
2008-07-14T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	how much ram do you have ?
2008-07-14T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	and what cpu ?
2008-07-14T20:27:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	no problem, from what you've said you've got enough ram to run ubuntu, try disabling advanced desktop effects from the "system -> administraton" menu
2008-07-14T20:27:00.000Z	ikonia	andare	sorry the system -> preferences menu
