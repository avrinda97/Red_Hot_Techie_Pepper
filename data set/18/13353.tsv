2007-12-21T23:08:00.000Z	velko	krabador	by the way - there are easier methods for creating live cd/dvd/flash disks. you type just two commands and have the live image: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB
2007-12-21T23:10:00.000Z	krabador	velko	with savings?
2007-12-21T23:11:00.000Z	velko	krabador	what do you mean by savings?
2007-12-21T23:12:00.000Z	krabador		(i`m italian....) when i update something
2007-12-21T23:13:00.000Z	velko	krabador	if your usb stick is big enough you can create second partition on it and put all your data there
2007-12-21T23:13:00.000Z	velko	krabador	every software you install during the live session is lost
2007-12-21T23:13:00.000Z	krabador	velko	2gb
2007-12-21T23:13:00.000Z	krabador		i would load in persistent mode
2007-12-21T23:14:00.000Z	velko	krabador	it's enough for / and data partitions
2007-12-21T23:15:00.000Z	velko	krabador	if you put your data on the second partition you'll be able to carry it with you. but your customization settings won't be saved. the programs you install during the live session also. they are put in ram and are volatile
