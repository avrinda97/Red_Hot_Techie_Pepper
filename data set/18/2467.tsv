2010-05-09T06:27:00.000Z	Jon--		OH DEAR GOD! I just did a mv ~/Desktop ~/bin  I meant to move A file from the desktop I screwed up. now I don't HAVE a ~/Desktop directory. Help?
2010-05-09T06:29:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	mv it back.
2010-05-09T06:30:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	I did. And I must say, that was one of my worst "OMG U CAN DO ANYTHING" in Ubuntu moments. Scared me =D
2010-05-09T06:34:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	./script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
2010-05-09T06:34:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	I meant more, how do I grab command line arguments in a bash script?
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	$1 $2 $3
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	And safely?
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	So I don't seg fault, how do I check if command line args WERE passed?
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	$# is the number of arguments you received.
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	I don't understand
2010-05-09T06:36:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	$1 holds arg1, right?
2010-05-09T06:36:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	How can I check if $1 is defined?
2010-05-09T06:36:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	Yes.
2010-05-09T06:36:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	If you pass 2 arguments to the script, $# is equal to 2.
2010-05-09T06:36:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	Oh. I see. Thanks.
2010-05-09T06:37:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	And your script won't die if you reference $1 but weren't passed any arguments.  The variable will probably have the empty string or 0.
2010-05-09T06:37:00.000Z	Jon--	Appl6	I'm used to C, where shit explodes if you don't code well ;)
2010-05-09T06:38:00.000Z	Appl6	Jon--	Yeah, obviously it's never good to rely on it, in C or bash or anywhere else.
