2006-09-21T10:46:00.000Z	flicovent		Please, can anyone help getting Ubuntu running on a G3? I am currently using it on a intel box and it worked fine but isn't with the g3.
2006-09-21T10:47:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	does it help if i know how to get it to work on a g4?
2006-09-21T10:50:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	please put my name on your replies if you want me to notice them :-)
2006-09-21T10:51:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	G4 might help, tried the support forum but to no avail so far though.
2006-09-21T10:51:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	yes, i've read this now... but what is your problem?
2006-09-21T10:53:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	the problem is that even if i boot holding the c key, it just goes to a white screen with a command prompt.
2006-09-21T10:54:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	and does mac work on that machine?
2006-09-21T10:55:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	yes, the prompt is after the "welcome dapper" screen.
2006-09-21T10:56:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	so, the c key works or not?
2006-09-21T10:56:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	that is: when you press the c key does it boot on the cdrom?
2006-09-21T10:56:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	yes, it must do to have the ubuntu screen, I believe but it must be cutting out or something.
2006-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	sorry, you're giving me too few and too general informations. if you don't exactly describe what's happening there, we/I can't guess!
2006-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	wondered if it's a dodgy disk but not sure how to check or anything.
2006-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	... and now i have to leave an prepare the dinner.
2006-09-21T10:59:00.000Z	a_l_e	flicovent	the simpliest way is to download again the iso... or to burn a new cd... 1/2 hour if you have some sort of DSL
2006-09-21T10:59:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	thankyou all the same, :) :-/
2006-09-21T11:00:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	OK, will try that.
2006-09-21T12:03:00.000Z	flicovent	a_l_e	are you back yet please? Sorry, my friend (laddercoins) can be more specific about the problem with the G3.
