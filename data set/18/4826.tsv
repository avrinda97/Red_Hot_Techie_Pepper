2009-04-17T04:08:00.000Z	helper	EagleScreen	where i can modify file shutdown.c where is the path?
2009-04-17T04:09:00.000Z	EagleScreen	helper	it is source code, are you programmer?
2009-04-17T04:10:00.000Z	helper	EagleScreen	no but check this : https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/303574 last one does this fix if i modify it like this ?
2009-04-17T04:12:00.000Z	EagleScreen	helper	a .c file is not a configuration file, it is source code file, so to take effect you have to recompile the software
2009-04-17T04:13:00.000Z	helper	EagleScreen	ok then i need to go to the configuration file because i install package ndiwrapper now i remember so i can install usb wireless window's driver after that the problem maybe config where i can check shutdown config?
