2008-04-26T19:05:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	there are no networks under nm-applet ?
2008-04-26T19:04:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	Ehm.. It didn't work. :/ But the WLAN switch says that is turned of, eventhough it is on...
2008-04-26T19:05:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	try turnign it on/off
2008-04-26T19:05:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	I did.. nothing happened
2008-04-26T19:05:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	only the wired connection is there..
2008-04-26T19:06:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	try right-clicking nm-applet and disable and re-enable wireless networking
2008-04-26T19:06:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	There isn't any "wireless networking"
2008-04-26T19:07:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	then the wireless driver isn't loaded. has it showed up in the hardware drivers manager yet ?
2008-04-26T19:07:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	no :/
2008-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	do you have windows in a dual boot?
2008-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	I tried installing it manually before. Compiled ndiswrapper, installed the broadcom windows driver etc. but it didn't work. I followed the guide on the ubuntu wiki.
2008-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	Nope. Only linux.
2008-04-26T19:09:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	the wireless switch is on but do you have a wireless light too ?
2008-04-26T19:09:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	no.. the light indicates it to be off, but I have tried switching it back and forth.
2008-04-26T19:09:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	I think this is the problem. try rebooting and turning the wireless off/on before the OS loads. the light should come on.
2008-04-26T19:10:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	mkay.
2008-04-26T19:14:00.000Z	minus198	mut80r|brb	Hm.. this is really weird. The light won't change... I'll try to boot the liveCD and see if it works better.
2008-04-26T19:15:00.000Z	mut80r|brb	minus198	mmk. my light comes on on boot-up. then it goes off when the OS loads but I can still connect (am connected right now with a BCM4311)
