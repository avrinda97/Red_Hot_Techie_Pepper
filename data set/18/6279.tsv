2008-06-23T14:23:00.000Z	cyberbuff		hello. I installed Hardy recently. But looks like ubuntu is keeping my CPU a little too busy. Can someone suggest me a lightweight linuxdistro?
2008-06-23T14:24:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	xubuntu or fluxubuntu could be better alternatives in that case
2008-06-23T14:25:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	that's fluxbuntu sorry, typo
2008-06-23T14:28:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	is nt that in beta?
2008-06-23T14:29:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	not at all, xubuntu and fluxbuntu are full leightweight distro's
2008-06-23T14:29:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	i run xubuntu right now as we type, have been since 7.10, works great
2008-06-23T14:30:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	ok. i will try. alternatively i am wondering whether i should uninstall some packages from hardy. Will that help me?
2008-06-23T14:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	it wouldn't do much no, besides lightening your hard disk .. gnome (and the gnome based applications) are what makes regular ubuntu a bit heavy on older hardware
2008-06-23T14:33:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	so you mean xubuntu is good? i am really confused which one to go for
2008-06-23T14:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	i do believe you can uninstall ubuntu-desktop and replace that with xubuntu-desktop, no need to reinstall since the underlying linux base is exacxtly the same
2008-06-23T14:33:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	since i am familar with ubuntu i think i should go for xubuntu
2008-06-23T14:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	sure xubuntu is good, it's officially supported by canonical just like kubuntu and ubuntu
2008-06-23T14:34:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	you mean just install XFCE?
2008-06-23T14:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	i think xubuntu-desktop does that yes, hang on i'll check
2008-06-23T14:34:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	ok.
2008-06-23T14:37:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	all you need to do is install the "xubuntu-desktop" package, then choose the "xfce-session" or similar selection from the GDM login manager and you're all set
2008-06-23T14:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	cyberbuff	do that via Synaptic and you'll get to see what gets installed that way before committing, just to be on the safe side
2008-06-23T14:38:00.000Z	cyberbuff	glitsj16	ok. i will try.
