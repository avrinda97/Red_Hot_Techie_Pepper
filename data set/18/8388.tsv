2007-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	craven		i well
2007-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	Slart	craven	have you searched google? or the ubuntu forums? I've seen so many people ask about grub error 17 there must be an answer somewhere
2007-08-27T05:42:00.000Z	Slart	craven	too bad I wasn't paying attention when those other people asked or I could have helped you =/
2007-08-27T05:46:00.000Z	craven	Slart	iv looked a round and most of them need a live cd to recover i use a alternitive installtion so what can i do?
2007-08-27T05:47:00.000Z	Slart	craven	yes.. I think you'll need a live cd... can't you download and burn one of the ubuntu installation cd's?
2007-08-27T05:48:00.000Z	craven	Slart	my pc will not run a live cd it only has 128 mb
2007-08-27T05:48:00.000Z	Slart	craven	ahh.. how did you install it? using the alternate install cd?
2007-08-27T05:49:00.000Z	Slart	craven	I'm wondering if grub doesn't have a small restore cd of their own
2007-08-27T05:49:00.000Z	Slart	craven	I'll look around.. brb
2007-08-27T05:50:00.000Z	craven	Slart	i got a rescue mode on the alternitive disk
2007-08-27T05:50:00.000Z	Slart	craven	ah.. that sounds like a good thing.. tried it?
2007-08-27T05:53:00.000Z	Slart	craven	here is one rescue-disk thingy http://geocities.com/supergrubdisk/
