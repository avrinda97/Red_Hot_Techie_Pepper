2006-11-30T09:36:00.000Z	Joakim		Hi everybody
2006-11-30T09:36:00.000Z	Joakim		I'm going to install World of Warcraft now
2006-11-30T09:37:00.000Z	Joakim		BUt I'm missing the font
2006-11-30T09:37:00.000Z	Joakim		Anybody who knows what font it is?
2006-11-30T09:37:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Verdana or Tahoma ?
2006-11-30T09:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Lol, it was just a guess, glad it worked :)
2006-11-30T09:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	In what are you installing it, though? Wine or Cedega? and following a guide? if such, which one? :P
2006-11-30T09:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Ah, I see
2006-11-30T09:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Ah, yeah, the patch thing
2006-11-30T09:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Whoops, doesn't susprise me
2006-11-30T09:42:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	From where?
2006-11-30T09:43:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	I didn't know about those two that were needed by WoW, thanks for that though :D
2006-11-30T09:43:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	cool!
2006-11-30T09:45:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Ah, nice... Wine can take its sweet time compiling x)
2006-11-30T09:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	I see o.o - by the way that sourceforge link doesn't work, looks like it got cropped
2006-11-30T09:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	*clicks to see*
2006-11-30T09:51:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Just run the .exe file and just that oO?
2006-11-30T09:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Joakim	Ah, thanks xD
