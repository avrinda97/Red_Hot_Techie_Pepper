2007-12-30T17:45:00.000Z	ActySofts		any ideas how to mount ntfs partition with write support in gutsy? I've looked everywhere, but I either see read-only or with a driver other than ntfs-3g
2007-12-30T17:45:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	ntfs-3g :P
2007-12-30T17:46:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	I'm not sure of the state of the ntfsmount in ntfsprogs but that's what I like
2007-12-30T17:46:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	works well too
2007-12-30T17:46:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	you add an entry to your fstab and you mount your NTFS part with it
2007-12-30T17:47:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	are you specifying ntfs-3g in the fstab entry?
2007-12-30T17:47:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	why do you have ro :)
2007-12-30T17:48:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	I'm thinking that's why you couldn't get rw :P
2007-12-30T17:48:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	well, take it off :P
2007-12-30T17:49:00.000Z	ActySofts	scguy318	I did a sudo mount -a, but still read-only
2007-12-30T17:49:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	with ro omitted?
2007-12-30T17:49:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	umount then mount
2007-12-30T17:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	sudo umount /dev/hdc1 then the mount -a
2007-12-30T17:51:00.000Z	ActySofts	scguy318	now the icons on my desktop aren't clickable O.o
2007-12-30T17:51:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	mm...:S
2007-12-30T17:51:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	does it say anything when you mount?
2007-12-30T18:51:00.000Z	scguy318	ActySofts	System -> PRefs -> About Me I think
2007-12-30T18:51:00.000Z	ActySofts	scguy318	there's no way to change it there AFAIK
