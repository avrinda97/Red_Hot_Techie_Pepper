2008-07-10T22:19:00.000Z	gokul		yes
2008-07-10T22:20:00.000Z	gokul		cprog.cpp
2008-07-10T22:21:00.000Z	gokul		c_lisp:error : no such file or directory
2008-07-10T22:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	don't copypaste :P
2008-07-10T22:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	was that a g++ or a bash error? :)
2008-07-10T22:22:00.000Z	gokul	Chousuke	copypaste what ?
2008-07-10T22:23:00.000Z	gokul	Chousuke	: yeah i know..thanks
2008-07-10T22:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	anyway, C++ programs are compiled with g++; install build-essential and you're fine :)
2008-07-10T22:25:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	the command is g++ source.file -o name_of_output_executable
2008-07-10T22:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	try with that and your program will compile
2008-07-10T22:26:00.000Z	gokul	Chousuke	: wt shud i put in place of name_of_output_executable ?
2008-07-10T22:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	whatever you want
2008-07-10T22:27:00.000Z	gokul	Chousuke	gimme an example..suppose my source file is abc.cpp..shud i try the followin : g++ abc.cpp -o abc.exe ?
2008-07-10T22:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	though usually you don't add .exe to executable names in Linux
2008-07-10T22:28:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	so just g++ abc.cpp -o abc
2008-07-10T22:28:00.000Z	Chousuke	gokul	if you don't specify the -o option, the default filename will be "a.out"
2008-07-10T22:29:00.000Z	gokul	Chousuke	: thanks a lot..its workin now
2008-07-10T22:29:00.000Z	gokul	Chousuke	now i can get back to my assignments..phew
