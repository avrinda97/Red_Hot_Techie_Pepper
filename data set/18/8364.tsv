2007-09-19T09:44:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	go for it
2007-09-19T09:46:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	this guide is great http://forlong.blogage.de/article/2007/8/29/How-to-set-up-Compiz-Fusion
2007-09-19T09:47:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	u want to set Horizontal distance to 2 or however many u want, and leave the other values at 1 under general options in ccsm
2007-09-19T09:47:00.000Z	Bllz	Evanlec	... that explains that. Thank you!
2007-09-19T09:48:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	the beginning of the guide http://forlong.blogage.de/article/2007/8/29/How-to-set-up-Compiz-Fusion explains how to get cube
2007-09-19T09:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	no...
2007-09-19T09:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	try ctrl+alt+left mouse button drag to use the cube
2007-09-19T09:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	make sure you have the cube plug-in enabled and also cube rotate plug-in, follow instructions from the link i gave you, and then restart X with ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-09-19T09:54:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	viewport mouse switcher has nothing to do with it
2007-09-19T09:58:00.000Z	Bllz	Evanlec	all good now... just had to restart X!  Duh! lol
2007-09-19T09:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	glad to hear :)
2007-09-19T09:59:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	yes it is a good site, fishtank plugin, im guessing maybe try enabling the water plug-in ?
2007-09-19T10:01:00.000Z	Bllz	Evanlec	will do!  I'll let you help other noobs in need! thanks again
2007-09-19T10:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	np ;)
2007-09-19T10:02:00.000Z	Bllz	Evanlec	I lied.  One last question.  Compiz/Emerald will quit on me for seemingly no reason and I have to restart them both via compiz --replace and emerald --replace, respectively.  Do you know what's up with that?
2007-09-19T10:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	im not exactly sure
2007-09-19T10:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	Bllz	disable expo plug-in ;)
