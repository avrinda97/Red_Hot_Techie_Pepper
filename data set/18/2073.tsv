2011-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	WinstonSmith		hi! how do i enable trash on an external hdd? since the user cant write to the root of the external hdd, they cant create the trash directory. where do i configure that? e.g. the rights which the temp mounts are mounted. do i have to add my user to some group?
2011-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	you want a trash on an external HDD?
2011-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	yes
2011-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	uhm, why?
2011-02-26T14:12:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	well because its my external data storage and it is GOOD(tm) to be able to retrieve stuff from trash if you accidentally delete it?
2011-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	I thought that anything you delete went into the "regular" trash :P
2011-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	the regular trash works per partition
2011-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	ah, my bad
2011-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	so no trash on ext hdd
2011-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	hmm, I just plugged my external drive and deleted a file. it went straight to the trash
2011-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	I think you're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist..
2011-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	which FS?
2011-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	FAT32
2011-02-26T14:25:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	gah, thank you!
2011-02-26T14:26:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	:)
2011-02-26T14:48:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	well nearly true. i386 is the most compatible
2011-02-26T14:49:00.000Z	tobier	WinstonSmith	yes, but I don't think it matters on a modern system :)
2011-02-26T14:49:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	tobier	i686 if your system supports it is nearly always the better choice
