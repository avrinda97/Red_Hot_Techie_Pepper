2011-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	aioe		not even to mentionthe system menu had vanished
2011-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	aioe		ah.. heh.. well just bewcause your a bot doesnt mean you're not intelligent
2011-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	Like me? I know what a computer is. Who doesn't? xD
2011-10-15T06:07:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	that unity interface would be great for someone new.. its fairly intuitive.. but I've been an IT guy a long time, used old linux boxes, hpux, win3.1.. all that crap.. and I cant for the life of me get used to unity.. I dont want to search for my app, I know where it is, its right there in games or whatever
2011-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	I believe that's the only part that should be fixed.         Make Dash either be "start menu" or default Unity/Gnome3 thing.
2011-10-15T06:11:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	yeah that was my primary gripe..I literally had to search for most everything because there was no browsing to say games no matter what you do, and yet I see a bunch of stuff I dont even have installed there and cant find stuff I do without searching
2011-10-15T06:11:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	my other issue is I just dont really like the crazy mac style its got going on where maximized windows become the upper bar
2011-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	What use did you really ever had with the upper bar? Blank with nothing in it?
2011-10-15T06:13:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	but most of all its the simple fact that I was converting a neglected debian machine I installed for her ages ago to ubuntu to get more recent packages, and she and her kids will not know how to use it if its not the _same_ and I simply couldnt replicate their setup on 11.10 no matter how hard I tried
2011-10-15T06:13:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	I like how they did away like that. It reminds me of the Tabs on top stunt that google Pulled off, and got many other browsers following and doing the same.
2011-10-15T06:13:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	yeah well its a transition that you need to be willing to make not have forced down your throat with no working fallback
2011-10-15T06:14:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	at least in natty both worked properly
2011-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	Understood. This alienated me when I first used it, and I then quickly got used to it. I like this even more because we nolonger has bloaty proccess named "metacity" running anymore. This shot up to like well over 400mb of memory. Insane!
2011-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	oh I've always hated megashitty
2011-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	I'm a hardcore sawfish user, personally.. I have loved that wm for ages
2011-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	Yea... TBH, I actually found Unity faster. I'm sure believe this is like an improved metacity.
2011-10-15T06:34:00.000Z	Ibis	aioe	Hey HEY! Me lieks pweetie funtz0r
2011-10-15T06:35:00.000Z	aioe	Ibis	yeah well I think its nice looking too but when it comes to being able to speed read and type at the same time.. this just hurts my eyes with its script italiac look
