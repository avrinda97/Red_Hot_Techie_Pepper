2010-01-07T20:06:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON		Cant ping local machines but can ping router... Any Ideas?
2010-01-07T20:06:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	router blocking pings?
2010-01-07T20:07:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	router doesnt block pings. I can ping the ubuntu machine from others
2010-01-07T20:08:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	traceroute {ip of machine on network}
2010-01-07T20:08:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	where does pinging stop?
2010-01-07T20:10:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	traceroute no reply
2010-01-07T20:10:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	where did it no reply?
2010-01-07T20:11:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	they are all   1 * * * 2 * * *, etc for 30 hops
2010-01-07T20:11:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	30 hops?!  that's not right
2010-01-07T20:13:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	yea. I don't know I can ping router and localhost but not any machines. but can recieve pings. and IPTABLES is set to accept
2010-01-07T20:13:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	i think your issue is a route issue
2010-01-07T20:14:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	route or router? Im pretty sure the router is set right. It hasnt changed and it used to work. untill i reinstalled karmic
2010-01-07T20:14:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	if you're getting 30 hops to reach a machine on your local network, it's going outside of the network, ... you might have your gateway as an external ip.  should be the ip of your router.  pastie.org what you get from # route
2010-01-07T20:15:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	it didnt jump 30 hops. It didnt get a reply
2010-01-07T20:15:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	unless i fail at using traceroute
2010-01-07T20:16:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	are you wireless?
2010-01-07T20:16:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	bluebaron	I can't say I know what that means.   --  Everything is wired
2010-01-07T20:17:00.000Z	bluebaron	inferno_daulXEON	i don't know what too tell you .. gotta get back to work
