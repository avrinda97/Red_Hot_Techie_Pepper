2010-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	pc500		I have a box which I was doing a release upgade via SSH and lost connection.  Is it possible to resume the upgrade process still running in th ebackground?  I can still SSH into it.  Or should I just reboot and see what happens?  What's the best recovery method?
2010-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- i would try and resume the upgrade via ssh first.  As a general rule its stated that you shouldnt do major upgrades via ssh but this isnt always possible
2010-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- I tried but apt-get has a lock file still present
2010-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- I can remove it, but I do see the upgrade process running still in ps aux
2010-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- is it a zombie process
2010-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- you can try and kill the process and then restart it from the beginning
2010-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- do you have physical access to the machine
2010-10-28T05:04:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- says no upgrade avialable
2010-10-28T05:04:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- No, but I do have VNC access to an IP kvm.
2010-10-28T05:04:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- ok.  Is the server mission critical?
2010-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- yeah i agree with Cmdr
2010-10-28T05:06:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- try a reboot and see what comes out the other end
2010-10-28T05:06:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- But at this point I can reboot it I guess and try again, but it migh tbe fubarred
2010-10-28T05:08:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- yeah i use it to support about 300 machines.  It rocks
2010-10-28T05:08:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- It's really good for either having a machine always "phone home" -- or remote 1-of support
2010-10-28T05:08:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- Or maybe if they had a "host your own" solution I'd lik eit more
2010-10-28T05:09:00.000Z	valium	pc500	- yeah that would be cooler
2010-10-28T05:12:00.000Z	pc500	valium	- it told me some shit was curropted -- then I ran dpkg -a -something as it said and it seems ot be continuing where it left off
