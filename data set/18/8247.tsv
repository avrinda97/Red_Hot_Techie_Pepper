2007-10-05T11:50:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		hey folks!
2007-10-05T11:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		i have a 3 button mouse and it works great... but i want to emulate the middle button by pressing left & right button @ same time (middle button is hard to push).... what should i add to my xorg config file to do this?
2007-10-05T11:51:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	i forgot, though I know that the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg asks you to enable it or not :P
2007-10-05T11:52:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	scguy318	but everything is perfect;  i dont want to go through that again ;p
2007-10-05T11:55:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	ive totally forgotten, you could check the man page of xorg.conf
2007-12-26T04:34:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	which part?
2007-12-26T04:34:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	sudo modprobe ibm_acpi or sudo modprobe thinkpad_acpi
2007-12-26T04:35:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	scguy318	do i have to do that everytime i login?  or just 1 time?
2007-12-26T04:36:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	scguy318	i get this error: bash: /proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth: Permission denied
2007-12-26T04:36:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	looks like that file it mentions does not exist
2007-12-26T04:36:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	the modprobe has to be done at each reboot unless you add the name of the module into /etc/modules
2007-12-26T04:37:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	scguy318	i thought it was giving me an error that i just didn't have those files enabled
2007-12-26T04:37:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	well, for some reason the bluetooth file in /proc does not exist
2007-12-26T04:42:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	lsmod | grep ibm-acpi
2007-12-26T04:43:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	scguy318	thanks.  what happens when i do sudo modprobe ibm-acpi ....... and then i run your grep command and i get back nothing
2007-12-26T04:44:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	weird, you probably should check dmesg | tail
2007-12-26T04:45:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	scguy318	no mention of the bluetooth thing when i runt htat command.......... any other ideas?
2007-12-26T04:45:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni-mobile	unfortunately no, I'm not familiar with Bluetooth :( you probably should repose your question for others
