2009-01-18T01:09:00.000Z	rory096		does anyone know why network manager or my network connection in general would just disconnect and stop working unless i restart whenever i'm downloading something using bittorrent? it seems to do it faster the higher my download speed. my wireless card is a Broadcom Corporation BCM4311, if that helps.
2009-01-18T01:11:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	Wireless tends to have more issues with high traffic.  Do you know if the router is crashing or just your adapter?
2009-01-18T01:12:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	just the adapter. the router stays up, and other computers are unaffected. once i restart, it's back to normal.
2009-01-18T01:14:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	what bittorrent application are you using
2009-01-18T01:14:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	azureus
2009-01-18T01:17:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	 I would lower the values of the connection settings to prevent azureus from overloading your adapter
2009-01-18T01:17:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	what do you mean?
2009-01-18T01:19:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	Do you know how to adjust Azureus settings?
2009-01-18T01:20:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	sort of. what exactly should i adjust?
2009-01-18T01:21:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	I think lowering max connections to 60 should help the most
2009-01-18T01:21:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	it's already at 50
2009-01-18T01:24:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	Do you know if DHT is enabled.  DHT uses a ton of traffic to communicate with peers, I would try disabling that.
2009-01-18T01:25:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	where would i find that in the options?
2009-01-18T01:25:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	Go to Tools -> Options -> Plugins -> Distributed DB
2009-01-18T01:27:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	done. i'm turning off my max upload and download speeds to see if it breaks again.
2009-01-18T01:27:00.000Z	klingon	rory096	ok, gl!
2009-01-18T01:27:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	thanks
2009-01-18T02:20:00.000Z	rory096	klingon	it seems to be working. thanks for your help!
