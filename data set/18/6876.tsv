2008-03-11T22:45:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	used em both gutsy is way better
2008-03-11T22:45:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	but had some serious issues with firefox and my intel 965 (compiz doesn't support it)
2008-03-11T22:45:00.000Z	Aragorn94	ItchyHobo	Isn't the installation like two hours long?
2008-03-11T22:46:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	nope
2008-03-11T22:46:00.000Z	Aragorn94	ItchyHobo	how long?
2008-03-11T22:46:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	dont remeber exactly but it is definitely not 2 hours long :)
2008-03-11T22:47:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	firefox is't very stable on gutsy, mine has issues with java and opening new windows; it just freezes
2008-03-11T22:48:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	sometimes it works fine
2008-03-11T22:48:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	and yeah google toolbar with firefox also has some probs
2008-03-11T22:49:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Aragorn94	but the saddest thing is i didn't get to enjoy compiz cuz i have an intel965ryck motherboard :(
