2008-12-24T18:42:00.000Z	Andy_		Hi, I used xubuntu and liked it, its way faster then windows and i love it, but i am not able to play sound on it and after searching for a long time I came to the solution that its not supported on my laptop, so now I want to completely remove xubuntu with its config files and all, I want no back or anything..just like a format..any idea how to do it?
2008-12-24T18:42:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	whatever OS you plan installing will you assist on that
2008-12-24T18:42:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	uh..i already have winXP installed
2008-12-24T18:43:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	good then
2008-12-24T18:43:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	but i want to remove xubuntu...and if atall i delete the aprtition i am sure the "Select OS" option will stay there forever, any way of UN installing it completely without problems?
2008-12-24T18:44:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	yeah
2008-12-24T18:46:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	oh..WHAT!? i mean..like if i format the drives?Like..I mean i make them visble in XP right click and do the format or delete them...xubuntu will be gone right? but the "select OS"option at startup will that also remove xubuntu kernel select thingy?
2008-12-24T18:46:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	removing the bootloader might end you up not being able to boot your xp
2008-12-24T18:47:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	it all depends a lot on your configuration
2008-12-24T18:47:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	just tell me what will happen if I just delete the partitions from the disk manager?
2008-12-24T18:48:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	if this hosts any files needed by grub, maybe even only menu.list it might render your system useless if you dont know how to fix it
2008-12-24T18:49:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	XP and xubuntu are completely in different drive and i guess no way connected..
2008-12-24T18:49:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	if you are right about no connection, then its save to delete it.
2008-12-24T18:51:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	if ..it does show the select OS option..I AM DOOMED right? no way to ensure that it wont show up?
2008-12-24T18:52:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	if ..it does show the select OS option..I AM DOOMED right? no way to ensure that it wont show up?
2008-12-24T18:53:00.000Z	Andy_	nibbler_	if ..it does show the select OS option..I AM DOOMED right? no way to ensure that it wont show up?
2008-12-24T18:54:00.000Z	nibbler_	Andy_	you might be doomed
