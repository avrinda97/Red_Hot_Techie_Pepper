2005-11-26T11:36:00.000Z	smo	dell500	you can loop thru the shell, but beware you'll end up with no id3 tags at all like that
2005-11-26T11:36:00.000Z	dell500	smo	that's what easytag is for :)
2005-11-26T11:37:00.000Z	dell500	smo	i have a whole system for my mp3s nowadays lol, i've been doing it for the past 3 weeks sorting and deleting
2005-11-26T11:37:00.000Z	smo	dell500	you might want to stick an echo in there the first time around, to make sure I didn't get # and % the wrong way around again
2005-11-26T12:41:00.000Z	smo	dell500	not unless you've made a backup.  if not, you really do need osx or windows for the ipod updater
2005-11-26T11:57:00.000Z	smo	dell500	does mount show it as rw or ro?  I've seen a few people with removable usb devices that should be rw, mount as ro . i still haven't figured out why
2005-11-26T11:58:00.000Z	dell500	smo	hold on
2005-11-26T11:58:00.000Z	dell500	smo	and thrice` : /dev/sdc2 on /media/ipod type vfat (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,noatime,umask=077,gid=1000,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,user=dell500)
