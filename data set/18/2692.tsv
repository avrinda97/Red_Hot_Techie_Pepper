2010-07-08T01:59:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	So is 2) then the home partition on a separate drive
2010-07-08T01:43:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	what's the problem?
2010-07-08T01:43:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	Was upgrading 9.10 to 10.04 (doing an alternate iso upgrade), over my system
2010-07-08T01:45:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	One partition for linux, one for windows, one for a dell recovery utility thing, I think...
2010-07-08T01:45:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	how was it partitioned before (9.10)
2010-07-08T01:45:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	THe partitioning doesnt seem any different now, just the fact that linux wont boot anymore
2010-07-08T01:46:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	the "easiest" might be to just reinstall.  You can boot into a live cd to save off documents and settings first.
2010-07-08T01:48:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	Perhaps I can do this...although I would have to reinstall a fair amount of things
2010-07-08T01:49:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	I know how to boot into a LiveCD and I have one on me
2010-07-08T01:49:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	save the "." directories under your home directory for your settings
2010-07-08T01:50:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	I'd probably save your whole /home tree to a different drive/partition
2010-07-08T01:50:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	(in a terminal:  cp -rp /home /path/to/save/to/)
2010-07-08T01:52:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	try what ChogyDan gave you (though I still might save the home directory tree first).
2010-07-08T01:54:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	its true that all the user's settings are in /home folder? boy thats nice
2010-07-08T01:55:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	yes, that's one reason many have /home on a separate partition so that if a reinstall is required you can just use it as is without a reformat.
2010-07-08T01:56:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	sjm	That sounds pretty cool, is there some sort of guide for setting that up
2010-07-08T01:57:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	don't think so, but it's offered, if I remember correctly, as one of the partitioning options at install time.
2010-07-08T01:58:00.000Z	sjm	Silent_Dream	I think the options are similar to: 1) easy (all one partition - more Windows like) 2) separate partitions for several things and 3) manual partitioning.
