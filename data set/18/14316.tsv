2005-08-22T10:27:00.000Z	bgerson		I'm completely new to Linux.  Tried using ubuntu Live CD on a laptop.  Will not recognize USB drive.  Can't see anything to modify.
2005-08-22T10:27:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	bgerson	LiveCD can't do very much, it's much better to install Ubuntu completely.
2005-08-22T10:28:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		~dvd
2005-08-22T10:28:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		!dvd
2005-08-22T10:28:00.000Z	bgerson		TU, Concord_Dawn but the installation requires that I boot with the CD version as the drive will be wiped when the installer on the USB drive executes.
2005-08-22T10:29:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	bgerson	I don't understand.....
2005-08-22T10:29:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		no Sonderblade
2005-08-22T10:29:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		if it's a dependancy, you need to install it.
2005-08-22T10:29:00.000Z	bgerson		Instructions are to boot with Live CD.  When the Desktop appears, plug in the USB drive and run the installer.  It will format the drive and install.
2005-08-22T10:30:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	bgerson	umm.........might I ask why you can't just use the Ubuntu Install CD?
2005-08-22T10:30:00.000Z	bgerson		I'm trying to do this on a laptop but it seems as if this is going to be better served on a desktop.
2005-08-22T10:30:00.000Z	bgerson		Do you mean using the Install CD to install on the internal hard drive?
2005-08-22T10:31:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		yes bgerson
2005-08-22T10:32:00.000Z	bgerson		Ah, but the installer from the USB drive needs to format the hard drive.  I imagine that's going to mess up the ubuntu installation.  ;-)
2005-08-22T10:32:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		yes jupiterste
2005-08-22T10:33:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		make a shell script that does mkdir <name>
2005-08-22T10:33:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		and then just cycle down the list.
2005-08-22T10:43:00.000Z	bgerson	Concord_Dawn	no way to resolve this, huh?
