2009-03-08T02:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	No
2009-09-28T00:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	Gedit has syntax highlighting
2009-09-28T01:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	What are you trying to do?
2009-09-28T01:47:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	I'm not entirely sure. I've been told to "grep your configuration files for RedirectMatch ^/$" and by configuration files, he's talking about Apache configuration files...
2009-09-28T01:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	I am not sure what whoever told you that meant by the "^/$" at the end because it doesn't make sense as part of a regular expression
2009-09-28T01:49:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	no idea. his mind moves in mysterious ways
2009-09-28T01:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	What are you trying to do?
2009-09-28T01:52:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	get my apache server to work properly
2009-09-28T01:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	What about it is not working?
2009-09-28T01:53:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	I get an "It works!" message instead of my index.html file..
2009-09-28T01:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	If you run "sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 stop" do you still see "It works!" or do you get an error that it couldn't connect?
2009-09-28T01:55:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	I still get the message
2009-09-28T01:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	Then there is another another apache running somewhere, if you aren't connecting to localhost then it may be another computer
2009-09-28T01:56:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	I can guarentee no other computer on my network is running Apache.
2009-09-28T01:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	Is this a fresh install of apache?
2009-09-28T02:00:00.000Z	ChrizC	Jordan_U	all is fine now.
2009-09-28T02:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChrizC	Actually, it was probably the browser cache the entire time
