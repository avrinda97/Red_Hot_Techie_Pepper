2005-04-17T12:40:00.000Z	mackid		hey all
2005-04-17T12:41:00.000Z	mackid		i have a problem.  i just tried to start enemy-territory, the game.. it normally works, but this time it didn't.. my screen resolution changed and i ended up looking at my gnome desktop in like 640x480 or whatever.. so i hit ctrl-alt-bkspc to restart X, but it just killed X and when it tried to restart it gave me an error
2005-04-17T12:41:00.000Z	mackid		"I will disable this server for now, when it is working correctly, restart GDM"
2005-04-17T12:42:00.000Z	mackid		any ideas, folks?
2005-04-17T12:43:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	do a "grep \(EE\) /var/log/Xorg.0.log" to see the error lines in the X logs.
2005-04-17T12:44:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	open the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see if there is any useful info too.
2005-04-17T12:45:00.000Z	mackid	dcraven	(EE) NVIDIA(0) FAILED TO INITIALIZE NVIDIA KERNEL MODULE
2005-04-17T12:47:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	did the "modprobe nvidia" give any output?
2005-04-17T12:47:00.000Z	mackid	dcraven	it did now
2005-04-17T12:47:00.000Z	mackid	dcraven	it did not
2005-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	oh my.
2005-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	I've also had a problem where some rogue broken GDM process is still in memory too. Maybe a /etc/init.d/gdm stop might help.. Never know.
2005-04-17T13:14:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	congrats :)
2005-04-17T13:15:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	did you get the pleasure of seeing the April 1st GDM?
2005-04-17T13:15:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	I almost died laughing.
2005-04-17T13:15:00.000Z	mackid	dcraven	i did, and it actually freaked me out when i first saw it
2005-04-17T13:16:00.000Z	mackid	dcraven	i was like "WTF?"
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	dcraven	mackid	a broken kernel.
