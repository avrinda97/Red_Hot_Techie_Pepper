2007-07-07T15:33:00.000Z	sharperguy		spinning the cube takes it to about 40%
2007-07-07T15:33:00.000Z	sharperguy		but it makes no sence because its meant to be using the gpu
2007-07-07T15:33:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	you need to use direct rendering, not in-direct rendering
2007-07-07T15:35:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	as I said, using direct rendering will make the GPU do the work instead of your CPU.
2007-07-07T15:35:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	except what your talking about doesn't exist get (xeglx?)
2007-07-07T15:36:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	Oh, sorry I thought you were using the nVIDIA driver.
2007-07-07T15:36:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	i am
2007-07-07T15:38:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	is it possible at all to get direct rendering with anything then if nvidia doesnt do it?
2007-07-07T15:39:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	nVIDIA does do it, but if you have too many windows open, the next window will be black unless you resize it to a point where it can be drawn.
2007-07-07T15:40:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	well my problem is that it's using more cpu than i would expect instead of gpu
2007-07-07T15:42:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	changing to direct rendering will make the GPU do all the processing, as opposed to the CPU doing the work.
2007-07-07T15:43:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	how can i tell if its using direct rendering or not then (i though it did it automatically if it was available)
2007-07-07T15:44:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	what are you using? Beryl or Compiz?
2007-07-07T15:45:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	in the beryl-manager, you can right click, and I don't remember where it is off the top of my head...but in something like "options" you can select it
2007-07-07T15:45:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	hmm, i already looked in there
2007-07-07T15:45:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	sharperguy	not the program, the tray icon.
2007-07-07T15:46:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	uder renering there is options for, indirect and XGL rendering
2007-07-07T15:46:00.000Z	sharperguy	Megaqwerty	or automatic
