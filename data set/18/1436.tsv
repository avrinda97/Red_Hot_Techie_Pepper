2011-02-25T08:53:00.000Z	Osmodivs		iS THERE  any software in Ubuntu that lets you send text messages to a cel phone?
2011-02-25T08:53:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	It takes no special software to send text to a cell phone.  It's no different than sending any other email.
2011-02-25T08:54:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	Well, I am no sending a message to a Blackberry or iPhone, I am sending it to a NOKIA 1100 - those with a green and black displays -
2011-02-25T08:56:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	Here's how it works:  ###-###-####@tmomail.net or  ###-###-####@vtext.com or ###-###-####@mobile.mycingular.com  etc. etc. etc.
2011-02-25T08:59:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	Well, it's because I downloaded SIM-IM from synaptic, and there is this SMS option where you have to set up the port for conection, but there is no way to change the blank empty Port box
2011-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	I have not idea about SIM-IM. Is it in the repos?
2011-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	Yes
2011-02-25T09:02:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	Why would you need it in the first place, (is what I do not understand).
2011-02-25T09:02:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	well, it would be just easier to send SMS thru my PC than a cel phone
2011-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	That way I do nto take my hands out of the keyboard
2011-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	Did you not read what I just told you?
2011-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	What mail client do you use?  Or do you use one?  If not, what web-based mail server do you use?
2011-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	I dont want to send e-mails, i want to send text messages (SMS) to a cel phone
2011-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	Surely what ever you  use has contacts or addressbook capability.  Right?
2011-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	It takes no special software to send text to a cell phone.  It's no different than sending any other email.
2011-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	Osmodivs	terry	Well, some of those old NOKIA 1100... well, i'll try sending one from Hotmail
2011-02-25T09:05:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	SMS is no different than email.  (Is there any other way to say it?)
2011-02-25T09:08:00.000Z	terry	Osmodivs	Only difference is that some phones may only accept messages that are less than 128 characters. (I think it's 128, not totally sure, it's been a while, because now days, most phones will recieve much longer, or pretty much anything you want to send, even multi-media.)
