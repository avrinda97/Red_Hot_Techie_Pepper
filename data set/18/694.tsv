2011-10-22T01:40:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	is there a button to disable and enable the touchpad, have you tried toggling the button?
2011-10-22T01:41:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	this would be a button on your touchpad, it was a question?
2011-10-22T01:43:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	is your touchpad connected to a laptop or is it separate
2011-10-22T01:46:00.000Z	aawara	happymonkey	currnetly a usb mouse is working but mousepad/touchpad is not working
2011-10-22T01:47:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	there is no button to turn on your touchpad on your laptop.  This is correct?
2011-10-22T01:49:00.000Z	aawara	happymonkey	: yes
2011-10-22T01:51:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	do you have xserver-xorg-input-synaptics installed ?
2011-10-22T01:51:00.000Z	aawara	happymonkey	let me chek on my laptop
2011-10-22T01:55:00.000Z	aawara	happymonkey	i dont think so that i have xserver-xorg-input-syanaptics
2011-10-22T01:55:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	install that package
2011-10-22T01:56:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	it's likely your mouse will work
2011-10-22T01:56:00.000Z	aawara	happymonkey	from ububtu software centre?
2011-10-22T01:56:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	I'm not sure
2011-10-22T01:56:00.000Z	happymonkey	aawara	I use the terminal for everything :)
