2009-07-08T20:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		After installing phpmyadmin, where should I point my browser to use it?
2009-07-08T20:30:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2009-07-08T20:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	Thanks, but there's nothing there
2009-07-08T20:31:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		hm, maybe it needs to be started up...
2009-07-08T20:31:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	No, it shouldn't need to be started. Are you getting a 404 error?
2009-07-08T20:32:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	Yes, a 404. (and btw, the process is running)
2009-07-08T20:32:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	Very strange. I've got phpmyadmin running fine on my machine and there's no process.
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	Not that you should have to, but have you tried restarting Apache since installing pma?
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	yeah, I misunderstood what I was looking at
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	Nope, will restart apache now...
2009-07-08T20:34:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	no effect :\
2009-07-08T20:34:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	You've checked that it's properly installed? whereis phpmyadmin
2009-07-08T20:35:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	phpmyadmin: /etc/phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin ... it did whinge about a badly put together package when installing
2009-07-08T20:35:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	sudo dpkg --configure -a?
2009-07-08T20:36:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	Was that the error?
2009-07-08T20:36:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	using an old style of packaging or something? I can reinstall to get the text if you like (& actually, it said to complain to the package maintainer anyways)
2009-07-08T20:37:00.000Z	Celauran	Mike_lifeguard	No harm in purge & reinstall I guess. I've got pma running without issue on both Hardy and Jaunty, though, so it's a bit strange.
2009-07-08T20:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Celauran	k, I'll do that... thanks anyways
