2012-03-09T01:58:00.000Z	helo__		How can I reinstall / fix grup without reinstalling ubuntu
2012-03-09T01:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	helo__	What about your grub installation is broken?
2012-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	I moved my linux partition from the end of the drive to the beginning (after removing windows)
2012-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	helo__	This guide will probably allow you to boot again https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot , but I'd personally like to see boot info script output as your symptoms are not normal for having just moved a partition.
2012-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	Since I moved the partition, I'm guessing grub doesn't know where it's config is anymore... I'm going to try this fix. Thanks. Back with results in a few
2012-03-09T02:24:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	After following these instructions, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot, I still cannot boot. The system now boots to the message "Disk Error\nPress any key to restart"
2012-03-09T02:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	helo__	I'm still waiting for boot info script output.
2012-03-09T03:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	helo__	Are you having any problem running boot info script?
2012-03-09T03:11:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	about to try that now
2012-03-09T03:12:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	The other fix had no affect at all]
2012-03-09T03:12:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	after following the instructions, I still never get a grub menu (doesn't seem like grub loads as it moves on to PXE)
2012-03-09T03:18:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	From that boot script, everything looks good... I'm lost. "Grub2 is installed on the MBR of /dev/sda and looks at sector 1 of the same hd for core.img. core.img is at this location and looks in partition 5 for /boot/grub" That is all right
2012-03-09T03:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	helo__	Please pastebin the entire output. ( http://pastebin.ubuntu.com )

2012-03-09T03:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	helo__	Are you sure that your BIOS is booting from sda and not sdb or sdc? (note that drive numbering can differ in the BIOS and linux, you need to check by size / manufacturer to be sure).
2012-03-09T03:25:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	sdb is the live disk
2012-03-09T03:26:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	sdd is some internal device I never use...
2012-03-09T03:32:00.000Z	helo__	Jordan_U	thanks for trying... I have to go. I will be back on later to try again...
