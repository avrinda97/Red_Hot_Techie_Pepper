2006-02-21T08:44:00.000Z	zebraFusion		how can I restart all current running programs
2006-02-21T08:44:00.000Z	zebraFusion		or even a single one?
2006-02-21T08:45:00.000Z	zebraFusion		from command line
2006-02-21T08:46:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 you can restart currently running services with their init script.
2006-02-21T08:46:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 for example  sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart
2006-02-21T08:46:00.000Z	zebraFusion	wastrel	would Azureus be in that same location?
2006-02-23T08:44:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 double-click the titlebar to roll up
2006-02-23T08:45:00.000Z	zebraFusion	wastrel	that maximizes...
2006-02-23T08:45:00.000Z	zebraFusion	wastrel	ideally I want it to ONLY close up to the titlebar
2006-02-23T08:45:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 system > preferences > windows
2006-02-23T08:46:00.000Z	zebraFusion	wastrel	perfect... Thanks
2006-02-25T16:46:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 bz2 is supposably smaller, gz is older
2006-02-28T14:01:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 ctrl-alt-backspace is the only thing i can think that would do that.
2006-02-28T14:02:00.000Z	zebraFusion	wastrel	I'm aware of that command but I'm absolutely sure it's not it
2006-02-28T14:02:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 your gnome keybindings are in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts
2006-02-28T14:03:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 dunno other wm's
2006-02-28T14:03:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 maybe helpful  http://davesource.com/Solutions/20050105.Control_Alt_Delete_Disable.html
2006-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	wastrel	zebraFusion	 most stuff like that is in /etc  /etc/ssh/
