2007-05-28T13:42:00.000Z	holycow		just install your windows cd an duse that to remove all partitions and reinstall on ntfs
2007-05-28T13:43:00.000Z	holycow		they will give you the opportunity to reformat and reinstall everything
2007-05-28T13:43:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	holycow	I believe majd is really having a different problem than the partitions
2007-05-28T13:44:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	holycow	his windows cd isn't detecting his HD, while ubuntu did :)

2007-05-28T13:44:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	holycow	in my opinion, it sounds like SATA, which requires a seperate floppy to load the driver. in any event a windows problem
2007-05-28T13:44:00.000Z	holycow	Tom_Kun_	i'm thinin same
2007-05-28T13:52:00.000Z	holycow	Tom_Kun_	oh thats what they do now
