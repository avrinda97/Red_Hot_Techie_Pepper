2007-10-21T15:42:00.000Z	niller		just installed the new live CD.... i have one thing to say: GREAT STUFF!!!!
2007-10-21T15:42:00.000Z	niller		only issue i have atm is that i cant get my bluetooth mouse to work
2007-10-21T15:43:00.000Z	murlidhar	niller	perhaps that can be solved by goin in the bluetooth preferences
2007-10-21T15:44:00.000Z	niller	murlidhar	i tried and for a sec it saw the Kensington Mouse, but it wouldnt activate it
2007-10-21T15:45:00.000Z	murlidhar	niller	in the services tab check the input service
2007-10-21T15:46:00.000Z	niller	murlidhar	it only sees my cell phone which is laying on the table
2007-10-21T15:46:00.000Z	murlidhar	niller	then u may have to configure it from terminal
