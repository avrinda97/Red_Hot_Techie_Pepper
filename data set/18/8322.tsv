2008-02-18T05:07:00.000Z	nano__		what better, compiz with Xgl or with Xorg server?.....anybody?
2008-02-18T05:09:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	x and aiglx is the way to go
2008-02-18T05:09:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	how come?  isn't xgl suppose to be the next best thing?
2008-02-18T05:09:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	because xgl appears not to be actively under development
2008-02-18T05:10:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	can i install aixgl via synaptics?
2008-02-18T05:10:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	you don't need to do anything special. it comes by default. it only works depending on your hardward
2008-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	do i need to put in a switch in my xorg.conf file ?
2008-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	how can i check to see if my aixgl is running?
2008-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	what is your display card?
2008-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	 check system > preferences > appearance
2008-02-18T05:12:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	and see the desktop effects section.
2008-02-18T05:12:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	i don't see any desktop effects option.....
2008-02-18T05:12:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	use system > administration > restricted manager to install the proprietary drivers
2008-02-18T05:13:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	im running fiesty fawn and the latest nvidia drivers i could get via restricted drivers were almost 1.5 yrs old; instead i disabled restricted drivers and downloaded newest nvidia drivers and installed them
2008-02-18T05:14:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	desktop effects wasn't a strong point of feisty :)
2008-02-18T05:14:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	: i agree, so what do u think i should do next in order to see if aiglx is working?
2008-02-18T05:15:00.000Z	nucco	nano__	not sure. I would recommend you upgrade if it is not too much trouble
2008-02-18T05:15:00.000Z	nano__	nucco	thnx
