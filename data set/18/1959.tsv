2011-02-27T19:13:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	see above
2011-02-27T19:15:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	uname -m is printing kernel-architecutre not what the cpu can do
2011-02-27T19:15:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	i have a 64bit cpu here running a 32bit ubuntu, uname -m is showing i686, cat /proc/cpuinfo is showing lm
2011-02-27T19:16:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	I got that by now :)
2011-05-07T14:16:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	in the cronfiles under /etc/cron.d I think a username should be specified
2011-05-07T14:16:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	yes you are right
2011-11-21T22:39:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	can't you just use apt-file and then search the corresponding source package?
2011-11-21T22:39:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	(I'm not 100% percent sure what you're after)
2011-11-21T22:40:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	i am searching in what kernel-package a specific file is
2011-11-21T22:40:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	i dont really get the difference between linux-header, linux-source, linux-image and so on
2011-11-21T22:43:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	the source is the actual kernel sourcefiles, header files contain reusable code (declarations/classes) which can be used with other code that needs compiling. The -image is the compiled binary
2011-11-21T22:43:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	but those are not source packages.
2011-11-21T22:45:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	i thought when i want to rebuild a kernel i am just picking apt the source-file with apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)  do some patching and build it up again
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	so i dont get the difference between "apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)" and "apt-get install linux-source-3.0.0"
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	if i am correct, both contains the uncompiled kernel
2011-12-08T00:22:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	not bad, you are getting faster :)
2011-12-08T00:22:00.000Z	oCean	iceroot	hehe
2011-12-31T17:30:00.000Z	iceroot	oCean	we are not offtopic when we are speaking about freedom
