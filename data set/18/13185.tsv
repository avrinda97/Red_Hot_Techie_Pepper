2006-01-22T06:09:00.000Z	cello_rasp		are there any text editors for gnome that support regular expression find and replace? for that matter is there anything like "flash renamer" (it allows batch renaming of files) for linux? i really can't get my head around bash programming just yet
2006-01-22T06:09:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	gedit
2006-01-22T06:10:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	does that support regex find and replace?
2006-01-22T06:10:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	yes
2006-01-22T06:11:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	if there are any guides on how to get that working i would be grateful... gedit doesn't seem to do so
2006-01-22T06:11:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	but gedit does have a file size limitation
2006-01-22T06:13:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	check this out....http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sed1line.txt
2006-01-22T06:14:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	no pain no gain
2006-01-22T06:16:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	help me out with gedit here : "The text "/\nguff/" was not found."
2006-01-22T06:19:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	what are you trying to match is a guff after a newline?
2006-01-22T06:19:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	that's right. I don't have any gedit plugins installed either..
2006-01-22T06:19:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	it seems every program has a different way of handling regex patterns
2006-01-22T06:21:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	and what do you want to replace the match with
2006-01-22T06:21:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	i'm just trying a find..
2006-01-22T06:23:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	grep -n guff file.dat
2006-01-22T06:23:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	hah, so much for gedit.
2006-01-22T06:23:00.000Z	cello_rasp	toko123	but thanks for the help
2006-01-22T06:25:00.000Z	toko123	cello_rasp	I'm not real familiar with regex. when i need to find and replace I generally use sed but to find a match only I would use grep
