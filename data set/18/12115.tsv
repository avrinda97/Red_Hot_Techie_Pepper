2006-07-07T05:41:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	Stop being rude, an op *may* greet you out the door
2006-07-07T05:43:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	If you can't figure it out, YOU ARE a beginner.
2006-07-07T05:43:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	Just read it!
2006-07-07T05:44:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	I wish there was a Wiki Link for managing "A New User In Denial"
2006-07-07T05:46:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	How 'bout you just go pay for Conanical's commercial help? They obviously won't make mistakes.
2006-07-07T05:47:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	Because if you can't read a wiki, Canonical should be able to help, right?
2006-07-07T05:47:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	I know, the text is more important than the problem.
2006-07-07T05:48:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	For windows-like systems, see KDE. What are you talking about "Windows Like"
2006-07-07T05:49:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	KDE even has a KStartMenu, I'm sure you'd feel right at home
2006-07-07T05:52:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	XFCE.
2006-07-07T05:53:00.000Z	SonicChao	Carmen-	If you sware at me one more time.....
