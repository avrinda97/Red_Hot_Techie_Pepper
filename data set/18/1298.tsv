2011-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	Newb4Life		E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
2011-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	Newb4Life		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2011-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	Newb4Life		That is what I said
2011-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	Newb4Life		I am trying to end it
2011-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	Newb4Life		I cannot stop them
2011-04-06T01:02:00.000Z	Newb4Life		its frozen
2011-04-06T01:02:00.000Z	Newb4Life		That is what I said
2011-04-06T01:02:00.000Z	Newb4Life		Yes
2011-04-06T01:02:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	is it possibly waiting for input?
2011-04-06T01:02:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	some packages (like java) wait for you to accept a license or answer a configuration question before tehy can finish installing
2011-04-06T01:03:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	oh if you rebooted it while the install was going..yeah itll be stuck. delete the lock file as ZykoticK9 said, then "sudo apt-get -f install"
2011-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	ubottu is a bot. telling it things like that won't work. Pici is the one who told the bot to give you instructions
2011-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	try without the  ; dpkg --configure -a
2011-04-06T01:08:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	just the sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2011-04-06T01:08:00.000Z	maco	Newb4Life	does it tell you what's using it and offer to kill it?
2011-04-06T01:09:00.000Z	Newb4Life	maco	no it doesnt
