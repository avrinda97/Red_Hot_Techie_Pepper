2010-08-26T05:02:00.000Z	UnderSampled		I'm installing kate on (gnome)ubuntu 10.04, and it seems to be stuck at: kbuildsycoca4(4788) kdemain: Emitting notifyDatabaseChanged ("servicetypes", "xdgdata-mime", "services", "apps")
2010-08-26T05:02:00.000Z	UnderSampled		what does it mean?
2010-08-26T05:02:00.000Z	UnderSampled		!hello | venzil
2010-08-26T05:03:00.000Z	Riddell	UnderSampled	it's just updating the settings cache
2010-08-26T05:03:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	why is it stuck there?
2010-08-26T05:03:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	can I just ^C out of it?
2010-08-26T05:04:00.000Z	Riddell	UnderSampled	I doubt that'll do anything, kate runs in the background usually
2010-08-26T05:05:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	I thought this was in the apt-get
2010-08-26T05:06:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	I can't check though, because it's filled the terminal's buffer
2010-08-26T05:06:00.000Z	Riddell	UnderSampled	if you just press return do you get your prompt?
2010-08-26T05:06:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	lol. I do
2010-08-26T05:06:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	what''s that mean?
2010-08-26T05:08:00.000Z	Riddell	UnderSampled	apt-get installed some files which caused kbuildsyscoca to go "ooh new files, best update myself" and it printed some debugging stuff while doing the update
2010-08-26T05:08:00.000Z	Riddell	UnderSampled	you probably started a KDE app on the same terminal earlier so kbuildsycoca outputs to that terminal
2010-08-26T05:08:00.000Z	Riddell	UnderSampled	I should fix it so it doesn't output needless debugging by default
2010-08-26T05:10:00.000Z	UnderSampled	Riddell	cool.
