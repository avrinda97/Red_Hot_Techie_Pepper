2007-06-15T05:33:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	ok so u do have breezy.
2007-06-15T05:35:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	what does " sudo apt-get update  " (without the quotes) in the terminal give you.
2007-06-15T05:40:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	you could try doing a dist-upgrade... but i dont know how that would work.
2007-06-15T05:45:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	if you are willing to wait, you might download 7.04 or request a cd
2007-06-15T05:46:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	what are ure system specs?
2007-06-15T05:49:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	it should be fine
2007-06-15T05:50:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	7.04 was last april
2007-06-15T05:50:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	you have to download the cd image, that was the waiting time i was refering to.
2007-06-15T05:51:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	yah. u could dual boot the two versions.
2007-06-15T05:51:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	then what would u like to do?
2007-06-15T05:52:00.000Z	peanutb	CNTRLX	you could try upgrading to dapper, then to edgy, and then to fiesty, but it would take a lot longer.
