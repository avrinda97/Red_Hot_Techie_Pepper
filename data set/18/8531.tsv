2008-03-11T05:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	that's what I just said... :/
2008-03-11T05:17:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	- never fails to hit home if not from a bot
2008-04-21T07:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	you ought to have it pull up a graphic that says  by by MS
2008-04-21T07:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	seriously.. why not just put the sys monitor on the upper bar of the screen?
2008-04-21T07:18:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	- Maybe i'll do that on another machine :P  But i'm fixing my freind's laptop and he wanted an easily accessable system moniter
2008-04-21T07:18:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	- security, i think
2008-04-21T07:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	don't know how that would make any difference..
2008-04-21T07:19:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	- oh, you mean on the toolbar?  That would be last ditch
2008-04-21T07:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	right click bar.. select "Add to Panel" and attach it.. then you're done..
2008-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	- THanks for the suggestion, but it would still be nice to get the keyboard shortcut
2008-04-21T07:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	there ought to be a way to put it in System/Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts.. but there's lots of stuff there and no "Add" button
2008-04-21T07:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	maybe in the conf file for that app.
2008-04-21T07:21:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	- yeah, i asked here because the one thing i'm dissapointed about ubuntu was a lack of GUI keyboart shortcut changes
2008-04-21T07:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	check this out.. http://blog.laptopmag.com/keyboard-shortcuts-in-linux-success
2008-04-21T07:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	np.. :)
2008-08-20T01:09:00.000Z	RequinB4	Scunizi	sudo apt-get purge pidgin
2008-08-20T01:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	RequinB4	thanks.. I was using --purge thats why it wasn't working
