2011-09-23T03:54:00.000Z	MTPrower		Hey guys, all my attempts at dual-booting Kubuntu and my existing installation of Windows 7 are failing. Can somebody give me some very basic, step-by-step information?
2011-09-23T03:55:00.000Z	MTPrower		Actually, ideally, I don't even want to use Windows 7. I just want to get Kubuntu working on my hard drive without losing my many gigs of files. I've been reading for the last two days and trying all sorts of stuff
2011-09-23T03:56:00.000Z	MTPrower		xD
2011-09-23T03:57:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	define not boot
2011-09-23T03:57:00.000Z	MTPrower	smw	I don't have an option to boot Kubuntu at system startup. It just boots Windows
2011-09-23T03:57:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	did you install grub to your boot sector?
2011-09-23T03:58:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	did kubuntu ask if you wanted to install grub? Did you say no?
2011-09-23T03:58:00.000Z	MTPrower	smw	no. I couldn't even figure out if I wanted it, due to so little information being given about it
2011-09-23T03:58:00.000Z	MTPrower	smw	it did not ask
2011-09-23T03:59:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	Grub is the boot loader. It chooses which OS to boot.
2011-09-23T04:01:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	I will warn you that backups of important data is a good thing :-)
2011-09-23T04:01:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	we are not responsible for any lost data.
2011-09-23T04:01:00.000Z	MTPrower	smw	dude, I can't do that
2011-09-23T04:02:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	can't do what? backup?
2011-09-23T04:02:00.000Z	MTPrower	smw	yep. Have nothing to back up to, and can't afford anything
2011-09-23T04:03:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	my definition of backup is my free dropbox account.
2011-09-23T04:03:00.000Z	smw	MTPrower	anything I could not stand loosing is there :-P
2011-09-23T04:03:00.000Z	MTPrower	smw	I used to use a dropbox. I need 360 GB of space though
