2008-08-08T11:09:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	dislo	(right on, a few guys from my team are there too)  Why don't you take the SD card out, and put it back in and see if it's mount?
2008-08-08T11:09:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	dislo	*mounted
2008-08-08T11:13:00.000Z	dislo	joejoecircusboy	it does auto mount perfectly
