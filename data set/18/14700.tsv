2005-06-28T12:32:00.000Z	Heimdall		hi
2005-06-28T12:34:00.000Z	Heimdall		can I ask a question about ssh ?
2005-06-28T12:34:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	don't ask to ask
2005-06-28T12:36:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	scp or sftp
2005-06-28T12:37:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	scp user@host:remotename localname
2005-06-28T12:37:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	or vice-versa
2005-06-28T12:38:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	nautilus can add sftp servers as a network server from the places menu
2005-06-28T12:39:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	putty (the windows ssh program) has pscp and psftp variants
2005-06-28T12:44:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	if you have full network access, Places->
2005-06-28T12:45:00.000Z	Heimdall	djm62	: what ?
2005-06-28T12:45:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	the menu: Places->Connect to Server
2005-06-28T12:46:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	will give you full drag-n-drop both ways
2005-06-28T12:49:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	can you put the sequence of commands you're using to make the full connection in a pastebin?
2005-06-28T12:54:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	ssh tunnelling is your solution, I think
2005-06-28T13:11:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	ah-ha...can you type the commands on the middle machine? is there an ssh server on the local machine too?
2005-06-28T13:16:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	if you can have a shell on B and sshd on A you can do (on B) "scp user@c:file user@a:file"
2005-06-28T13:17:00.000Z	Heimdall	djm62	: aaah this is an idea !
2005-06-28T13:19:00.000Z	djm62	Heimdall	if that doesn't work, try an IP-over-Carrier Pigeon connection :-S
