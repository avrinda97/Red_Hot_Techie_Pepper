2009-11-02T09:56:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	Ask the right person and the person will tell you any *nix is the right choice.
2009-11-02T10:00:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	Ubuntu uses Gnome -- Kubuntu uses KDE -- Xubuntu uses XFCE -- You get the idea.  There also are Lubuntu and other varieties of *buntu.

2009-11-02T10:05:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	There are "blubuntu-theme" which will make Ubuntu blue. :)
2009-11-02T10:06:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	No. You can install both on a same partition -- You can switch between them.  Like switching between different games installed on a same system.
2009-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	Shoshana	kinja-sheep	: but i need download both or ubuntu come with kubuntu too ?
2009-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	Ubuntu come with GNOME by default. When you get it up and running, you can install KDE packages.
2009-11-02T10:09:00.000Z	Shoshana	kinja-sheep	: KDE packages + ubuntu its like kubuntu ?
2009-11-02T10:10:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	Yes.
2009-11-02T10:13:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	Alternate CD have the option of LVM (to treat multiple physical drives as a single gigantic partition or others) and cryptsetup (for full-system encryption).
2009-11-02T10:13:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Shoshana	Ubuntu can be blue. I changed my appearance to show you.
