2006-07-04T13:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	you can download the ISO & burn your own - it's a ~600Mb download
2006-07-04T13:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	the LiveCD? Yes
2006-07-04T13:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	go to the download page, get the "desktop" ISO file, burn it, that'll get you the LiveCD w/ install option
2006-07-04T13:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	the ISOs you download are completely identical to the pressed CDs from ShipIt
2006-07-04T13:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	there should be an "Install Ubuntu" link on your desktop, if you're running the LiveCD
2006-07-04T13:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
2006-07-04T13:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	no problem - only suggestion I've got is to ease off on the Enter key a bit - one line per thought is good :)
2006-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto - i think I gave you this URL already, though?
2006-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	697Mb, it looks like
2006-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	language, thanks - and it looks like you got a bad download..
2006-07-04T13:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	your download must have been stopped somehow
2006-07-04T13:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	takes 6-8 weeks, maybe a bit less if you're lucky
2006-07-04T13:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	try downloading it again - the Ubuntu servers are fairly fast
2006-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	there are options for partitioning during the install, but the LiveCD won't touch your harddrives at first
2006-07-04T14:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	start your machine w/ the CD in your drive
2006-07-04T14:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Duff	you'll need to tweak your BIOS to allow booting from CDROM before HDD
