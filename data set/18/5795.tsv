2008-09-01T13:48:00.000Z	dr_willis		Hmm.. Most vnc clients ive seen fit that bill.
2008-09-01T13:49:00.000Z	dr_willis		Theres more vnc client/servers out then just the one built into ubuntus gnome.
2008-09-01T13:49:00.000Z	euthymos	dr_willis	such as?
2008-09-01T13:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	euthymos	 just looking in the package manager shows vnc4server, tightvnc, and proberly others.. time to hit google and the package manager
2008-09-01T13:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		!find vncserver
2008-09-01T13:50:00.000Z	euthymos	dr_willis	they're not for other platforms :(
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	euthymos	 err... you can use any vncclient to connect to about any vncserver.. reguarless of the os..
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	euthymos		ok
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	euthymos		where should I go
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	dr_willis		I think some of them even have a java based vncclient you can use in a browser
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	euthymos	dr_willis	that's not the point. I'm searching for an open source VNC server/client couple that just works everywhere
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	euthymos		thank you however
2008-09-01T13:51:00.000Z	dr_willis		check the tightvnc, and vnc4servers  homepages.. they may have windows ports.. Not sure what you really mean by 'other platforms'
2008-09-01T13:52:00.000Z	euthymos		windows, mac, linux
2008-09-01T13:52:00.000Z	euthymos		these are the platforms
2008-09-01T13:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	euthymos	 look for one done totally in java then I guess.. or .net
2008-09-01T13:52:00.000Z	euthymos		thank you however, bye
2008-09-01T13:52:00.000Z	euthymos	dr_willis	thanks
