2007-01-29T07:33:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	but how do i _use_ it, the manual is a bit cryptic...
2007-01-29T07:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	those threads talk about it.  Moreso than I know
2007-05-05T05:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	thelostpatrol, Ubuntu doesn't use the root account.  You use sudo to run the command (rm) in this case.
2007-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	no they're not.  Unless you've set your root password.
2007-06-23T06:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	Preview program?  just compile and view?
2007-06-23T06:05:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	i've been doing that...
2007-06-23T06:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	that's the normal method.  get vim-latexsuite or something, you can \ll to compile.  What do you want in a 'preview' sort of thing?
2007-06-23T06:06:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	what it will look like in a pdf/dvi/output as i type, or at the touch of one button
2007-06-23T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	check out Lyx, it's a Latex GUI sort of thing.  Might be what you're looking for.
2007-06-23T06:09:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	i found Lyx but i couldn't find a deb for it :P
2007-06-23T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	It's in universe.
2007-06-23T06:12:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	thanks! :D
2007-10-26T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	no, use gksu not sudo
2007-10-26T12:20:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	i know...
2007-10-26T12:20:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	but suppose i want to copy and move files with gnome-terminal... how would i do that?
2007-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Moniker42	mv or rename or cp
2007-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	Moniker42	Flannel	do you know which one? =\
