2008-11-08T19:23:00.000Z	tarelerulz		Is the iso for install Ubuntu and live cd too ?  I am trying to get Ubuntu 8.10
2008-11-08T19:25:00.000Z	tarelerulz		sound a bit funny ,but I am  stoked to see nautilus have tabbing .  about time
2008-11-08T19:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	tabbing in nautilus is just pointless for us spatial users though :p
2008-11-08T19:29:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Paddy_EIRE	 if It use it as well as Konqueor .  It had that great filter feature view .  File size view was great with it too.
2008-11-08T19:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	yeah konqueror is sexy but I like my minimal spatial browser
2008-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	nautilus is supposed to be minimal and clean.. dont bog it down with unneeded "features/bloat" I would happily switch over to kde if I needed those things... leave nautilus alone ;(
2008-11-08T19:34:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	gnome is gnome kde is kde
2008-11-08T19:36:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Paddy_EIRE	they are bother linux gui .  innovation is great for us all.  Political different should not get in the way of getting better.  Take KDE porting it app building frame work to windows and with it goes some of the apps.
2008-11-08T19:37:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	yeah good point
2008-11-08T19:38:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Paddy_EIRE	 I can't wait until I here someone windows person use some app that was on kde/linux first and be like that is cool.  I would say I know been using it for years.
2008-11-08T19:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	hehe
2008-11-08T19:40:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Paddy_EIRE	 VLC is one thing I have seen my windows friends started using and telling how cool it is.   Not some codec pack like megacodec pack .
2008-11-08T19:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	yeah it really solved a lot of headaches
2008-11-08T19:41:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Paddy_EIRE	 Just good software getting to all windows and mac bothers. Make it about the software not os .
2008-11-08T19:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	yeah but the GNU/Linux OS is the main delight
2008-11-08T19:43:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Paddy_EIRE	 I mean your talking to guy that reads config and can't stop smiling .   I love the idea behind it.   This laptop don't have anything ,but Linux working now. Not looked back
2008-11-08T19:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	:D
2008-11-08T19:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	tarelerulz	sorry to sound like a nag :P but use the offtopic :D
