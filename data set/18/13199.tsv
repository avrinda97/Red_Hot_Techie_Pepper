2005-12-26T13:15:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	'gimpshop' isn't proprietary
2005-12-26T13:15:00.000Z	dbernar1	Eleaf	is it in Ubuntu?
2005-12-26T13:15:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	Gimp is in Ubuntu
2005-12-26T13:16:00.000Z	dbernar1	Eleaf	any clues on how to install?
2005-12-26T13:16:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	do you want to install gimpshop instead of gimp?
2005-12-26T13:19:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	?
2005-12-26T13:21:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	I found a debian package if you want gimpshop
2005-12-26T13:23:00.000Z	dbernar1	Eleaf	where is it from, please give me a link.
2005-12-26T13:23:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	alright
2005-12-26T13:24:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	here is the debian package http://mirror.suramya.com/redirect.php?id=3%20target=_new
2005-12-26T13:25:00.000Z	dbernar1	Eleaf	thanks. Is there any information about this deb anywhere? I am not gonna just install from somewhere, for security reasons.
2005-12-26T13:25:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	this is where I found it from, the link is near the bottom of the page http://linux.suramya.com/tutorials/Install_GIMPShop/
2006-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	dbernar1	Eleaf	larger than what? Larger than the aiff, or the mp3?
2006-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	larger than the mp3
2006-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	I converted an mp3 to an aiff and edited that.  Then converted that again to mp3, it is larger than the origional
2006-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	dbernar1	Eleaf	I can think of the rate thing, not sure what it is called, the quality setting.
2006-01-05T14:03:00.000Z	Eleaf	dbernar1	even using a smaller bitrate
