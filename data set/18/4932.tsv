2009-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	eimh		I wanted to install ubuntu, I downloaded the latest iso and burned it to a cd, but there wasn't a setup.exe in it?
2009-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	eimh		How can i install ubuntu?
2009-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	did you make a dvd already?
2009-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	eimh	Digital8	yep, still in my dvd-rom
2009-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	do you seek to install it on a raw hard drive? or within windows
2009-01-11T08:18:00.000Z	eimh	Digital8	Will I lose my windows when I install ubuntu? isn't ubuntu a program-like-something?
2009-01-11T08:19:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	it is an entire operating system. it can, however, be installed within windows on the latest versions -- and can be installed side-by-side with windows as normal
2009-01-11T08:19:00.000Z	eimh	Digital8	hmm which should I prefer?
2009-01-11T08:19:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	that depends on how you want to use it
2009-01-11T08:19:00.000Z	eimh	Digital8	I liked that cube style look, am I able to install just that feature?
2009-01-11T08:20:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	compiz/beryl? as seen on youtube videos?
2009-01-11T08:20:00.000Z	eimh	Digital8	yep, I think so
2009-01-11T08:21:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	i have not used the ubuntu-within-windows method myself, but if you want to play games and all that jazz as seen in some of the videos..i'd go with a full install (assuming you're comfortable doing so)
2009-01-11T08:21:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	doing a full install is as simple as rebooting with the dvd in your drive
2009-01-11T08:21:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	it will guide you to installing it in a side-by-side form,
2009-01-11T08:21:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	if you have two computers, i suggest that you use a 2nd one to ask questions during the install
2009-01-11T08:22:00.000Z	eimh	Digital8	thanks for your advice
2009-01-11T08:22:00.000Z	Digital8	eimh	you're welcome
