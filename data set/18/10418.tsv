2007-01-02T08:36:00.000Z	alecjw	RingDonut	sudo aptitude install usplash-dev
2007-01-02T08:38:00.000Z	RingDonut	alecjw	"Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "usplash-dev"
2007-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	alecjw	RingDonut	that's starnge. it works fine for me...
2007-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	RingDonut	alecjw	are you using Ubuntu 6.06?
2007-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	alecjw	RingDonut	nope. edgy

2007-01-02T08:47:00.000Z	alecjw	RingDonut	wouldn't it be easier to upgrade to edgy?
2007-01-02T08:49:00.000Z	RingDonut	alecjw	Vorbote: I'm actually only doing this so I can use the program to make a custom distro then upgrade to xubuntu
