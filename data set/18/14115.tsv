2007-01-14T15:40:00.000Z	nilsl		How do I install from a live cd in the terminal?
2007-01-14T15:42:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	the Desktop CD?  Nope.  the alternate CD is what you're looking for
2007-01-14T15:44:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	the Desktop CD will install, but only through the liveCD
2007-01-14T15:44:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	ubuntu-6.10-desktop-powerpc.iso
2007-01-14T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	correct.  That'll install, but only through the liveCD
2007-01-14T15:45:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	There should be an install for terminal somewhere there.
2007-01-14T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	you'll boot, then on the desktop there's an install option.  You want the 'alternate' CD for just an installer.  Available at the same place you got that one
2007-01-14T15:46:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	it'll be ubuntu-6.10-alternate-powerpc.iso
2007-01-14T15:46:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	I don't get no install option, and besides, that's what I asked for ... If there were any alternatives.
2007-01-14T15:47:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	no, there isn't.  the desktop Is ONLY a liveCD, and only able to install through the liveCD
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	I question that.
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	well,you can go ahead and question it all you want, it won't change the facts.
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	Of course it will.
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	The installationfiles are there, and I have a terminal, all I need.
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	go troll elsewere please.
2007-01-14T15:49:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	Well, stfu, since I was just asking about another way, but I'm fairly sure there's some hack out there to do this.
2007-01-14T15:50:00.000Z	Flannel	nilsl	there's an "install" command on your desktop, that's the method you use to install.  The other would be just to copy all the crap, as if you were in any generic liveCD, like this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromKnoppix  But, the installer on the desktop should work fine for you, dingbat.
2007-01-14T15:51:00.000Z	nilsl	Flannel	lol, so what are you talking about then?
