2004-12-10T17:57:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I turn my computer back on
2004-12-10T17:58:00.000Z	Hikaru79		And I get to the login screen
2004-12-10T17:58:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I put in my user/pass
2004-12-10T17:58:00.000Z	Hikaru79		It does some processing
2004-12-10T17:58:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Then spits out this error: http://www.pastebin.com/124313
