2012-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	L3top	chovynz	find /path/to/parent/dir -name "* *" -type f | rename 's/ /_/g'
2012-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	L3top	chovynz	that will do so recursively... if you only want the one directory add -maxdepth 1
2012-09-22T16:57:00.000Z	L3top	chovynz	change -f to -d for directory names
2012-09-22T16:58:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	is there some way i can test this, before running on my 40k+ folder?
2012-09-22T16:59:00.000Z	L3top		good call llutz.
2012-09-22T17:01:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	llutz usr13 thanks bloody awesome. thanks for your help
2012-09-22T17:15:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	why would this be happening?         Can't rename /var/www/usb/Audio Adrenaline/8 Great Hits /var/www/usb/Audio_Adrenaline/8_Great_Hits: No such file or directory     this is after running find /var/www/usb -name "* *" -type d | rename 's/ /_/g'^C
2012-09-22T17:16:00.000Z	chovynz		ignore the ^C
2012-09-22T17:18:00.000Z	L3top	chovynz	because renaming Audio Adrynaline to Audio_Adrenaline means that Audio Adrenaline/8 Great Hits no longer exists as it is going in order?
2012-09-22T17:18:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	did i need to change the dirs first?
2012-09-22T17:19:00.000Z	L3top		I would expect you need to do a maxdepth first, then let it try and traverse... but this will occur with every nested spaced directory I would expect chovynz
2012-09-22T17:19:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	does the / after the space break teh pattern?
2012-09-22T17:20:00.000Z	chovynz		lol
2012-09-22T17:21:00.000Z	L3top	chovynz	you could probably setup a loop which changed the maxdepth one directory at a time until all operations were complete
2012-09-22T17:22:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	does maxdepth go in find or rename?
2012-09-22T17:22:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	find am i right?
2012-09-22T17:25:00.000Z	chovynz	L3top	well this is better - Can't rename /var/www/usb/Audio Adrenaline /var/www/usb/Audio_Adrenaline: Permission denied
2012-09-22T17:26:00.000Z	L3top	chovynz	ls -l /var/www/usb/Audi*                      who owns it?
