2009-07-18T09:45:00.000Z	j2daosh		ya know, i cant say as i have had a problem with network manager, i use the kde version and its nice
2009-07-18T09:47:00.000Z	j2daosh		lol BB8, im just messing with you. i dont come in here much because my system is already set to go and i dont update so nothing breaks :P
2009-07-18T09:47:00.000Z	j2daosh		but on a lighter note, if you used the Knetwork manager, things would work much better :P
2009-07-18T09:48:00.000Z	j2daosh		lol zenlunatic no thanks
2009-07-18T09:49:00.000Z	j2daosh		thats just asking for trouble :P

2009-07-18T09:49:00.000Z	j2daosh		lol well the only other bottle i know is jack :P
2009-07-18T09:49:00.000Z	j2daosh		but thats too strong for some
2009-07-18T09:49:00.000Z	Kalmi_	j2daosh	I couldn't get a modem(phone) working in KDE... worked fine in Gnome... YMMV as always :)
2009-07-18T09:50:00.000Z	j2daosh	Kalmi_	well see the wonderful thing about kubuntu/ubuntu, the underpinning is the same
2009-07-18T09:50:00.000Z	j2daosh		so i just apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and away i go
2009-07-18T09:50:00.000Z	j2daosh		using both kde and gnome applications :D
2009-07-18T09:52:00.000Z	j2daosh		now, back to what i was asking before i was sidetracked by a M$ fanboi, where is the complete source list for the newest ubuntu?
2009-07-18T09:52:00.000Z	j2daosh		i just converted my girlfriend to linux and i want to make sure she gets the most out of it
2009-07-18T09:52:00.000Z	Kalmi_		j2daosh... well... wonderful... NM frontend works well for some things on KDE and for some things on gnome... wonderful...
2009-07-18T09:53:00.000Z	j2daosh	Kalmi_	thats why i have both installed and just load into KDE, i like the windows manager better with KDE but i like some of the gnome apps better, so it works out because i get my nice windows manager and all the neat little applications that work with gnome :D
