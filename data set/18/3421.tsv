2009-11-01T04:10:00.000Z	Jester05		when i click to configure my card its also only giving me one option for what to do w/ them where it usually said sep. X, clone, twinview.... its only saying sep. x the others are grayed out.  This may be due to it not realizing I have another monitor but I'm not sure
