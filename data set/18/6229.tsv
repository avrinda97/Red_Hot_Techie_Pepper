2008-12-18T20:54:00.000Z	bluey		does anyone know how to enable USB in virtualbox?
2008-12-18T20:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	It's not available in virtualbox-ose, you have to use the proprietary one
2008-12-18T20:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	Just uninstall the OSE, and go to virtualbox's website and install from there
2008-12-18T20:56:00.000Z	bluey	ASULutzy	 does that mean i have to pay for it?
2008-12-18T20:56:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	No, it's free, it's just not open source
2008-12-18T20:56:00.000Z	bluey	ASULutzy	will i have to remove my windows image too?
2008-12-18T20:56:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	No, you can use the same image
2008-12-18T20:57:00.000Z	bluey	ASULutzy	i am trying to run itunes on Vbox... do u think it will work... i mean for connecting to my ipod touch
2008-12-18T20:58:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	Hmm, it probably will
2008-12-18T20:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	There are a couple things you can use to interface with your ipod via Ubuntu without a VM, I think gtkpod or something, let me check
2008-12-18T20:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	Have you tried sudo apt-get install gtkpod ?
2008-12-18T20:59:00.000Z	bluey	ASULutzy	 i hope so. i spent a lot of money on this ipod and i will be damned if it makes me have to dual boot with XP.... no gtkpod doesnt work with ipod touch
2008-12-18T21:00:00.000Z	bluey	ASULutzy	yes i got gtkpod installed
2008-12-18T21:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	Ah, so you're right... Well, what I will say is, I've had nothing but great experiences with USB passthrough using the non open source edition of Vbox
2008-12-18T21:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	There was one thing I had to change in /etc/fstab to get it to work, but once I did that, it was easy-peasy
2008-12-18T21:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	Yea, the OSE does not support USB passthrough whatsoever (other than mounting the folder as a shared folder, but that'd only work for like pendrives and stuff :)
2008-12-18T21:03:00.000Z	bluey	ASULutzy	wish me luck.. will let u know how it goes
2008-12-20T01:17:00.000Z	ASULutzy	bluey	You need to make sure you are in vboxusers, and that the line in /etc/fstab is correct (and that the gid you have there is actually the correct gid of the group vboxusers) then once you do that, you should just create the filter in settings for VBox that says like, "Allow everything" then you the usb icon in the bottom right of VBox should allow you to right click on it
