2009-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	interesting.
2009-10-22T11:48:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	what kind of routing problems are you having?
2009-10-22T11:48:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	I'm not sure. I can't get to outside world from the ubuntu machine
2009-10-22T11:48:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	is your network interface up? can you ping your gateway IP?
2009-10-22T11:49:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	yes and yes
2009-10-22T11:49:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	and I can do dns lookups on outside world
2009-10-22T11:49:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	where is your DNS resolver located?
2009-10-22T11:49:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	traceroute shows the connection timing out after the fourth hop (two hops pas the gateway)
2009-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	traceroute from the mac plugged into the same network, however, gets all the way to the end with no problem at all
2009-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	dhcp sets the dns hosts to be in local subnet, ip's starting with 10.
2009-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	and the mac has an identical network setup?
2009-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	ifconfig on the mac also...
2009-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	yeah, just dhcp.
2009-10-22T11:53:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	do you mind pasting the traceroute that dies on the 4th hop?
2009-10-22T11:54:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	unfortunately don't have it here, already left office, and irc was blocked on that network so couldn't get on to ask my stupid questions then, heh
2009-10-22T11:55:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	right now I'm just trying to get an idea of what else I could possibly look at next time I go there
2009-10-22T11:55:00.000Z	Boohbah	codeFiend	ahhh, this was an office network... can you contact the network admin?
2009-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	codeFiend	Boohbah	yeah, I'll try to get some contact info, but there's no sysadmin on site there, they let a lot of people go recently apparently. was hoping to solve it myself.
