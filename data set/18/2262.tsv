2010-07-09T11:46:00.000Z	cggaurav		This is a simple query , though I am unable to find the solution online. If I want to run a C++ program I do ./helloworld from the current directory. How would I do it from lets say home/ ?
2010-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	Voldenet	cggaurav	what do you mean?
2010-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	Voldenet		cd to your home
2010-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	Voldenet		and enter full path to program
2010-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	Voldenet		like: /home/myprogs/helloworld
2010-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	cggaurav	Voldenet	: Lets say the program sits in home/a/b/c/helloworld.cpp
2010-07-09T11:48:00.000Z	cggaurav	Voldenet	How would I see the output without cd from home instead of c
2010-07-09T11:48:00.000Z	cggaurav		?
2010-07-09T11:48:00.000Z	Voldenet		gcc /home/a/b/c/helloworld.cpp -o /home/a/b/c/helloworld
2010-07-09T11:48:00.000Z	Voldenet		then cd ~
2010-07-09T11:48:00.000Z	Voldenet		/home/a/b/c/helloworld
2010-07-09T11:49:00.000Z	cggaurav	Voldenet	gives me no output.
2010-07-09T11:49:00.000Z	cggaurav	Voldenet	though from c it does.
2010-07-09T11:49:00.000Z	Voldenet		Well, put your sources on pastebin

2010-07-09T12:04:00.000Z	cggaurav	Voldenet	Excuse me for the delay.
2010-07-09T12:11:00.000Z	cggaurav	Voldenet	I figured it out.;)
2010-07-09T12:12:00.000Z	Voldenet	cggaurav	no problem ;P
