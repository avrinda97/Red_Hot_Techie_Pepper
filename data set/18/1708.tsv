2010-12-20T19:25:00.000Z	l33tch		can anyone tell me how to attach/dettach a usb device (non-storage) via console?
2010-12-20T19:27:00.000Z	User51	l33tch	maybe you need to install the driver of the USB??
2010-12-20T19:27:00.000Z	User51		i had a couple of USBÂ´s that needed a driver
2010-12-20T19:28:00.000Z	User51		who has/had the low voice problem on skype too?
2010-12-20T19:29:00.000Z	l33tch		user51: it's there already :( even modprobing it does nothing...
2010-12-20T19:30:00.000Z	User51		ah :(
2010-12-20T19:30:00.000Z	User51		maybe i can install the windows skype with wine ??
2010-12-20T19:30:00.000Z	l33tch		Siearra 3g modem basically.. .modprobe sees the device merely as sierra
2010-12-20T19:34:00.000Z	l33tch		sam: yup.. there.. has wokred fine till i attached it to a virtual machine in virtualbox.... since then nothing, though still visible in lsusb and all thet normal spots
2010-12-20T19:36:00.000Z	l33tch		sam: it's strange.. all other devices work as soon as i detach.. the just re-attach to the main system.. but in this case.. even rebooting doesn't help
2010-12-20T19:37:00.000Z	l33tch		sam: is there maybe somewhere ike fstab, but for usb modules that i can look?
2010-12-20T19:38:00.000Z	l33tch	User51	what sounds server is your skype using?
2010-12-20T19:39:00.000Z	l33tch		sam: thanks... i'll spend some time lookign through there...
2010-12-20T19:39:00.000Z	User51	l33tch	i dont know?
2010-12-20T19:39:00.000Z	User51		where can i see that ? :P
2010-12-20T19:40:00.000Z	l33tch		user51: right click the sklype icon on the panel and in options under sound devices...
