2008-04-12T12:55:00.000Z	meoblast001		can anyone tell me how to access a printer on one machine from another machine?
2008-04-12T12:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	meoblast001	maybe CUPS will help? Visit the admin interface at the following address in your web browser:  http://localhost:631/
2008-04-12T12:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	meoblast001	using the IP number is probably the best bet
2008-04-12T12:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	meoblast001	IP instead of the computer name
2008-04-12T12:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	meoblast001	ohh, wanna link me to the guide you are using?
2008-04-12T12:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	meoblast001	and what exactly was it you are trying to do?
