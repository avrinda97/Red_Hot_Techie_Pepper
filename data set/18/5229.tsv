2008-11-23T11:55:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	you've some possible fixes there
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	if you want to know if you're using the right /dev you can write this command eject -T -m cdrom1
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	it should eject your drive
2008-11-23T11:58:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	replace cdrom1 for whatever you want if it doesn't work
2008-11-23T11:58:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	you can try dvd, dvdrw, cdrw
2008-11-23T12:01:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	then it's the correct device
2008-11-23T12:02:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Goth	n8tuser so then i try sudo hdparm -i  /dev/cdrom and i get /dev/cdrom: No such file or directory
2008-11-23T12:02:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	try dvdrw
2008-11-23T12:04:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	after you discover the right device try this     hdparm -d1 -X66 /dev/<your device>
2008-11-23T12:05:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	that's weird...try this
2008-11-23T12:05:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	ls /dev/d* && ls /dev/cd*
2008-11-23T12:14:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	that command should turn DMA on and UDMA mode 2
2008-11-23T12:15:00.000Z	Goth	arghh2d2	lol
