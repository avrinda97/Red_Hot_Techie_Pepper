2008-05-02T03:15:00.000Z	ozfalcon		How do I change the places locations (ie documents, videos, music, pictures)
2008-05-02T03:16:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	replace them with symlinks to the actual location
2008-05-02T03:22:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	No i want to put them in a subdirectory to clear up my home dir.
2008-05-02T03:23:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	these are just bookmarks. put them where you want them and bokkmark tehm again
2008-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	ok thanks
2008-05-02T03:25:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	ah, I can just move them and they know where to look. Cool
2008-05-02T03:42:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	you stat that in ~/.bashrc or
2008-05-02T03:42:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	you should look in ~/.profile :)
2008-05-02T03:42:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	k
2008-05-02T03:43:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	it'
2008-05-02T03:43:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	it's already done for you
2008-05-02T03:46:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	Doesn't seem to work. I have a folder "bin" in my home, The commands are executable. But I can't run them from command.
2008-05-02T03:47:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	"SET |grep PATH" doesn't show it as there.
2008-05-02T03:50:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	in my .profile is a statement that says PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH, with check if it exists before it. i didn't put it there, so i guess that's a default
2008-05-02T03:51:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	I see what it's doing, IF it exists it sets it. (I have to logout/in AFTER putting the bin folder there)
2008-05-02T03:52:00.000Z	stefg	ozfalcon	or simply source .profile again
2008-05-02T03:53:00.000Z	ozfalcon	stefg	But that only works for the current terminal.
