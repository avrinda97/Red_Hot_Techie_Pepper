2008-02-12T23:52:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	that's feisty -- kernel naming scheme changed in gutsy
2008-02-12T23:52:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	yeah, but i don't have gutsy installed
2008-02-12T23:54:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	on feisty you don't want the 2.6.22 kernels anyway
2008-02-12T23:54:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	I'm trying to get enough packages ready for an upgrade to gutsy, but i need the wireless drivers so i can actually get online
2008-02-12T23:55:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	apt-get -d dist-upgrade -- that'll download all packages without installing them
2008-02-12T23:56:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	nah, didn't do anything
2008-02-12T23:56:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	you need to point your /etc/apt/sources.list to gutsy first :)
2008-02-12T23:58:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	do I add to the sources.list or change the lines from feisty to gutsy?
2008-02-12T23:58:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	the latter
2008-02-12T23:59:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	where do they get downloaded to?
2008-02-12T23:59:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	/var/cache/apt/archives
2008-02-13T00:01:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	still nothing downloaded
2008-02-13T00:01:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	pastebin your sources.list and the complete output of apt-get
2008-02-13T00:02:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	sources.list http://phpfi.com/296080
2008-02-13T00:02:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	output http://phpfi.com/296081
2008-02-13T00:03:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	one thing unrelated to this: you're missing the -updates repo for universe and multiverse
2008-02-13T00:04:00.000Z	Seveas	_Lucretia_	anyway, I think I forgot to tell you to do apt-get update before doing apt-get -d dist-upgrade :)
2008-02-13T00:06:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	Seveas	which repos?
