2007-03-18T09:59:00.000Z	thugren		Hey how do you start in the termail mode?
2007-03-18T10:00:00.000Z	thugren		when your booting?
2007-03-18T10:01:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	you could stop gdm loading on boot
2007-03-18T10:03:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	if you want to do that you could do "update-rc.d gdm remove"
2007-03-18T10:05:00.000Z	thugren	montyp	I am trying to get the  Nvidia driver installed.
2007-03-18T10:05:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	you won't need to disable gdm then
2007-03-18T10:05:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	have you installed nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-legacy?
2007-03-18T10:06:00.000Z	thugren	montyp	K.., I have those installed So How do I get them working?
2007-03-18T10:06:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	you may also need to install the linux-restricted-modules
2007-03-18T10:07:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	i am guessing this is the problem ... did they restricted modules get installed as well?
2007-03-18T10:09:00.000Z	thugren	montyp	k know what? :)
2007-03-18T10:09:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	what?
2007-03-18T10:11:00.000Z	thugren	montyp	Okay.. I have those all installed..  I have the nvidia-glx. Because i have a 6800 PCI-e card
2007-03-18T10:12:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	did you upgrade recently or anything? When you upgrade the kernel, you have to get the new restricted modules
2007-03-18T10:13:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	so get install the new restricted modules, then install nvidia-glx again
2007-03-18T10:17:00.000Z	thugren	montyp	Okay.. so how do Install it?
2007-03-18T10:17:00.000Z	thugren	montyp	Okay.. Or does it add it when you select it?
2007-03-18T10:17:00.000Z	montyp	thugren	um, "apt-get install linux-restricted-modules"
