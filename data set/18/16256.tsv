2005-05-24T16:08:00.000Z	dan_a		Hi guys, I need a hand with a failed dist-upgrade.  I was running Woddy + Backports, attempted to upgrade to Hoary and I think it's gone pear shaped.
2005-05-24T16:08:00.000Z	Seveas	dan_a	where did it fail?
2005-05-24T16:09:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	and I don't seem to have a lot of the packages I should have in the list
2005-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	do I need to set me default dist in apt.conf or something like that?
2005-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	Seveas	dan_a	no idea, i can give you my /etc/apt/* if you want?
2005-05-24T16:12:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	sounds good
2005-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	Seveas	dan_a	http://kaarsemaker.net/~dennis/etc_apt.tar.gz
2005-05-24T16:14:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	thanks for that
2005-05-24T16:14:00.000Z	Seveas	dan_a	and don't forget to install ubuntu-desktop :)
2005-05-24T16:15:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	don't want that package, it's a server
2005-05-24T16:15:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	anyway, part of the problem is that I can't see that one
2005-05-24T16:15:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	I wanted Ubuntu-base
2005-05-24T16:15:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	yes :)
2005-05-24T16:15:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	can't see that either
2005-05-24T16:16:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	yep, that's the problem
2005-05-24T16:18:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	ahhh, I think I was missing the pgp stuff
2005-05-24T16:29:00.000Z	dan_a	Seveas	I think that's cured it, thanks for that
2005-05-24T16:30:00.000Z	Seveas	dan_a	yw, glad i could help
