2009-12-17T05:20:00.000Z	PeanutHorst	ActionParsnip	that's not my question.
2009-12-17T05:20:00.000Z	PeanutHorst		!eol
2009-12-17T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	its dead and gone and has been for a year now
2009-12-17T05:20:00.000Z	PeanutHorst	ActionParsnip	my question is, do the mirrors still mirror it.
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	so i would very much doubt you will find any repos
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	PeanutHorst		my friend won't want to do an upgrade, i'm just trying to get her to install xchat
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	could compile it from source
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	PeanutHorst		hah
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	PeanutHorst		not without build-essential, ActionParsnip
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	PeanutHorst		and that won't be present on the system
2009-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	install it from the install cd
2009-12-17T05:22:00.000Z	PeanutHorst	ActionParsnip	not without gtk-devel and all that jazz
2009-12-17T05:22:00.000Z	PeanutHorst		THAT's not on the install cd
2009-12-17T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	true, you will have to compile those
2009-12-17T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	you can install xchat from the install cd too
2009-12-17T05:24:00.000Z	PeanutHorst	ActionParsnip	REAL xchat, or xchat-gnome?
2009-12-17T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PeanutHorst	may have to make do, if she won't upgrade you are stuck
