2009-02-19T01:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		question - will Bad Things happen if I delete certain .list files in /var/lib/dpkg/info ?
2009-02-19T01:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		I've had a spot of filesystem corruption leaving a bunch of them needing to be replaced, but dpkg won't work due to the files being the wrong format

2009-02-19T01:12:00.000Z	lupine_85	vigo_	I don't have a backup of /var
2009-02-19T01:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		bit of an oops on my part
2009-02-19T01:12:00.000Z	vigo_	lupine_85	Make one before you goof with it.
2009-02-19T01:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		wedll, kind of goes without saying
2009-02-19T01:13:00.000Z	vigo_	lupine_85	I do not see as anything could really go bad, there is the restore function
2009-02-19T01:14:00.000Z	lupine_85	vigo_	I was just wondering if anyone actually knew before I tried it
2009-02-19T01:14:00.000Z	lupine_85		`file *list | grep HTML |wc -l` gives me 8 entries, "woo"
2009-02-19T01:16:00.000Z	lupine_85		right, crunch time
2009-02-19T01:16:00.000Z	vigo_	lupine_85	But you never know, so back it up if you have data that you want saved, OSs crash, is normally user error, try this, copy the text from that command, save it, then edit the other, if goof ups happen, then replace the original configs
2009-02-19T01:17:00.000Z	lupine_85	vigo_	mmhm. ooh, it downgrades the problem from an error to a serious warning
2009-02-19T01:17:00.000Z	lupine_85		win
2009-02-19T01:17:00.000Z	vigo_	lupine_85	That sounds better.
2009-02-19T01:18:00.000Z	vigo_	lupine_85	Gratzi!
2009-02-19T01:21:00.000Z	lupine_85		OK, I can install stuff again now *phew*
2009-02-19T01:22:00.000Z	vigo_	lupine_85	Whew! neato work
