2009-04-23T04:49:00.000Z	EoL{s}		If I shrink a partition using Windows Vista, and I choose "use largest continuous free space" installer option, will that affect any of my other partitions?
2009-04-23T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	after shrinking, the largest contiguous space will be the space you made
2009-04-23T04:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	then its not right
2009-04-23T04:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	if you plan your partitions you do not have to resize as you can make the windows partition use only part of the drive
2009-04-23T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	no, do not disregard it
2009-04-23T04:52:00.000Z	EoL{s}	ActionParsnip	I reduced the Windows Vista partition by about 17 gigabytes.
2009-04-23T04:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	Ive never used resize as i plan my partitions first
2009-04-23T04:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	so im not the guy to ask
2009-04-23T04:55:00.000Z	EoL{s}	ActionParsnip	I'll try to do it manually then. Just one thing, one guide told me to make the slack space 500mb, another told me to make it double my computer memory. Which is best?
2009-04-24T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	have you installed video drivers?
2009-04-24T05:12:00.000Z	EoL{s}	ActionParsnip	Not yet. I kind of figured that was the problem. Just making sure...
2009-04-24T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	i wouldnt start troubleshooting anything til you have all drivers and full updates
2009-12-15T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	you'll need to edit grub using the proper method to make the changes last between kernel updates
2009-12-15T04:21:00.000Z	EoL{s}	ActionParsnip	All I want to do is set the timeout of GRUB to 0.
2009-12-15T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	you set that in /etc/default/grub
2009-12-15T04:25:00.000Z	EoL{s}	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I just found a "grub" file in my /etc/default/
2009-12-15T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EoL{s}	read te grub2 docs all will be explained
2009-12-15T04:27:00.000Z	EoL{s}	ActionParsnip	Thanks for the help. I think I've found what I need/
