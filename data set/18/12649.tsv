2006-07-25T11:21:00.000Z	seanh		Anyone come across this before---trying to install Dapper for a friend, on a new mid-spec laptop, and the live system runs so absurdly slow that it's just not reasonable to do the install. Takes about 1 hour to respond to the first question-choosing the language. The Breezy live CD is fine on the same laptop. Was considering trying a text mode install. What would be the best solution?
2006-07-25T11:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	sounds like a bad burn. Just went through that 20 minutes ago. A fresh burn solved that problem. For text mode installs, try the alternate cd.
2006-07-25T11:23:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	- hmm.. it's a CD from shipit.I guess it could be a bad burn still
2006-07-25T11:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	hrmm, you never know. I've had bad cds come in sealed packages before.
2006-07-25T11:24:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	- right, I'll burn another. Do you know if the text mode install is any different than the live install in dapper? i.e. does it just install the standard desktop system like it used to in breezy?
2006-07-25T11:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	yeah, its the same thing, only you get more options. I personally recommend it to everyone over the desktop cd.
2006-07-25T11:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	make sure its on a 700 MB blank, not a 650 MB one.
2006-07-25T11:28:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	- 700MB = 80 minutes?
2006-07-25T11:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	yeah
2006-12-16T07:35:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	you can browse network places in ubuntu.
2006-12-16T07:36:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	-- oh yeah. Since when? Does installing samba or smbfs enable that automatically?
2006-12-16T07:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	its always been there (well, ever since I've been using ubntu)
2006-12-16T07:41:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	-- okay I see some windows shares, but I get errors when I double-click them
2006-12-16T07:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	you must have the permissions to view them.
2006-12-16T07:45:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	sonicGB_ : I click on Network Servers, Windows Network, MSHOME, get "Couldn't display MSHOME, The location is not a folder". Sometimes it actually does open it and show the shares, sometimes not. ?
2006-12-16T07:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	seanh	it depends if your workgroup master is online or not.
2006-12-16T07:45:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	: you mean the Windows user?
2006-12-16T07:47:00.000Z	seanh	fyrestrtr	sonicGB_ : Okay, when I get into the server, I see the share "CONKER", it says it's a smb-share, when I click it I get a long error message about "Cannot open CONKER because the filetype indicates it's a desktop configuration file, but the contents show it's a smb-share
