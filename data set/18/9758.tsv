2007-03-10T12:14:00.000Z	Rei-chan		How do I stop this PC from rebooting after starting a Ubuntu 6.10 install?
2007-03-10T12:14:00.000Z	t35t0r	Rei-chan	acpi=off
2007-03-10T12:15:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Tried that. Tried fb=false too.
2007-03-10T12:15:00.000Z	t35t0r	Rei-chan	any special kernel messages before it reboots?
2007-03-10T12:15:00.000Z	t35t0r		where when does it reboot
2007-03-10T12:16:00.000Z	Rei-chan	t35t0r	I wish. It gets to loading the kernel sometimes, toher times, to loading the initd. Reboot seems almost random.
2007-03-10T12:16:00.000Z	Rei-chan		This is the box, its got Gentoo on it right now.
2007-03-10T12:16:00.000Z	t35t0r	Rei-chan	run memtest?
