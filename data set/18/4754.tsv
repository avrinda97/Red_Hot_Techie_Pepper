2009-02-15T21:19:00.000Z	trialman		if the kernel image and initrd are in the /boot directory, why would i have a kernel panic?
2009-02-15T21:20:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	why would its location matter?
2009-02-15T21:20:00.000Z	trialman	danbhfive	the images are supposed to be in /boot?
2009-02-15T21:21:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	well, a kernel panic means your kernel is found, it runs, but then it crashes
2009-02-15T21:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	whats wrong?
2009-02-15T21:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	are you using intrepid?  if so, try installing linux-backports-modules
2009-02-15T21:26:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	8.10 = intrepid
2009-02-15T21:27:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	try tab completion
2009-02-15T21:28:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	if you have the -generic kernel installed, then you should get the -generic version of lbm, I think
2009-02-15T21:28:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-intrepid-generic
2009-02-15T21:29:00.000Z	trialman	danbhfive	so what if i'm compling a kernel with the wireless extensions?
2009-02-15T21:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	sorry, I've no idea.   That means you aren't using the ubuntu kernel, right?   Anyway, here is the bug report for the ubuntu kernel: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/259157
2009-02-15T21:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	well, you might as well give lbm a shot.  It won't mess up your attempt to compile your own kernel, and it might get your ath5k working.  Worth a shot?
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	trialman	danbhfive	lbm?
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	the package I was telling you about earlier, Linux-Backports-Modules
2009-02-15T21:37:00.000Z	trialman	danbhfive	but once i make the kerenel and do a make install, do i have to run a mkinitramfs comand or something?
2009-02-15T21:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	trialman	I dunno.  I've never compiled a kernel before
2009-02-15T21:39:00.000Z	trialman	danbhfive	hmm, done it a few times on linux, several times on the BSD's, a bit different.
