2006-02-26T09:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	that machine has an ati graphics card ?
2006-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	LinuxJones	yes
2006-02-26T09:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	you might want to install the binary drivers for your ati card.
2006-02-26T09:03:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	LinuxJones	: Im a bit noob, so, how do I do that?
2006-02-26T09:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	does your screen work if the second monitor is not plugged in ?
2006-02-26T09:04:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	LinuxJones	: nope
2006-02-26T09:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	are you on the linux machine right now, or another one ?
2006-02-26T09:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	you only have 1 machine right ?
2006-02-26T09:06:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	LinuxJones	: I have a server machine with windows XP also...
2006-02-26T09:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	ok well can you post your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to pastebin.ca ?
2006-02-26T09:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	I am off for a quick cig brb
2006-02-26T09:36:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	you can just install the binary driver for ati cards for your kernel in the restricted repo.
2006-02-26T09:38:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	LinuxJones	: Im all new to this, how do I do that?
2006-02-26T09:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	1 sec will get you a link
2006-02-26T09:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ConfidentiaL	I have to split for an hour or so search the wiki or maybe someone can get you a link using uboto here in the channel. BYE
2006-02-26T09:41:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	LinuxJones	: Did you find the link?
