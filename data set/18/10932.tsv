2007-03-14T12:52:00.000Z	arooni		the volume buttons my sony laptop only adjust pcm volume... how can i get it to adjust 'front' volume (as thats what really seems to control volume on my system)
2007-03-14T12:54:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	I suspect the buttons won't actually adjust the volume on the channel you've chosen, the only way you can do it is via the volume control at the top, IIRC..
2007-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	so i cant tell it do a different channel
2007-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	you could run a script to adjust the volume on that specific channel if you setup a matching keyboard command/shortcut via X or the like, but otherwise no..
2007-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	what would i type from the command line
2007-03-14T12:58:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	Which channel was the one you needed adjusted?
2007-03-14T12:58:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	'Front'
2007-03-14T12:59:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	try 'amixer sset Front +1 unmute'..
2007-03-14T12:59:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	yeh, sset..
2007-03-14T13:00:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	how can i create an alias for that
2007-03-14T13:01:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	you can either use xbindkeys to make keys on your keyboard adjust it, or you can use .bashrc
2007-03-14T13:03:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	Yup, it'll just override the volume up/down keys on your keyboard..
2007-03-14T13:03:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	ok i just installed it
2007-03-14T13:04:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	follow the instructions in https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ticket/916 (post by Mathew, about half way through)
2007-03-14T13:43:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	can you have buttons toggle?
2007-03-14T13:43:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	with xbindkeys... ie. the firs ttime you do it ... it does X ... the second it does Y
2007-03-14T13:43:00.000Z	halex-ab	arooni	what do you mean?
2007-03-14T13:44:00.000Z	arooni	halex-ab	i.e. have a Mute/Unmute function
