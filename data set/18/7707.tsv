2007-11-29T16:29:00.000Z	yapyccky		hello, anyone here never has a dell d820 laptop with nvidia geforce 7400? i've a big problems in settings up
2007-11-29T16:29:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	what problem in detail?
2007-11-29T16:30:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	my video card is so slow...i've 512mb video ram
2007-11-29T16:31:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	i've installed nvidia-glx-new but nothing...
2007-11-29T16:31:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	in which case u think your video card is slow?
2007-11-29T16:32:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	3d-application or video-decoding?
2007-11-29T16:32:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	everywhere
2007-11-29T16:33:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	i see black box when i open a window before it appear. when i move an abject in inkscape it takes time to move and it moves realyl slow
2007-11-29T16:33:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	do you use any 3d-desktop-feature?
2007-11-29T16:34:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	i dunno what to check and how to set up my videocard
2007-11-29T16:35:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	i guess there is smt wrong somewhere but i dunno where :)
2007-11-29T16:40:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	but i to think if your 2d-desktop not renders proper then you couldn't blame your video-card
2007-11-29T16:40:00.000Z	yapyccky	b2ag	what do u mean
2007-11-29T16:40:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	cpu-speed
2007-11-29T16:41:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	or applications try to run special features like overlays
2007-11-29T16:42:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	if overlay (video, tv, ...) not displayed proper you could blame your video-card :)
2007-11-29T16:44:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	what does glxinfo show you?
2007-11-29T16:45:00.000Z	b2ag	yapyccky	maybe you could join #quiteplacetotalk and paste it there
