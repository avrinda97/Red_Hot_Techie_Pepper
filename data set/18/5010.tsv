2009-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	omnydevi	nbeebo	- you could put in the live cd, mount your filesystem, and move them to a usb device or some such
2009-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	nbeebo	omnydevi	thanks alot but i dont really understand..
2009-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	omnydevi	nbeebo	- right now I am on the live CD, if you have the Ubuntu CD, you can put it in, select "try ubuntu without changes to your computer" and get back on pidgin and i can walk you through the rest
2009-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	nbeebo	omnydevi	i dont think you know what my problem is sorry.. i ctrl+x a file, nautilus freezes for about 30 sec or generally slow then i cant paste it anymore---
2009-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	omnydevi	nbeebo	- I understand, is this a new install or this just start happening?
