2007-03-01T15:54:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	source is platform independent but you have to compile it yourself
2007-03-01T15:54:00.000Z	runlevel-work	gravemind	compile?
2007-03-01T15:55:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	yeah, it
2007-03-01T15:55:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	It's not that hard. Go to synaptic and search for build essentials
2007-03-01T15:55:00.000Z	runlevel-work	gravemind	im lost
2007-03-01T15:55:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	no problem. Its at System>Administration>Synaptic
2007-03-01T15:56:00.000Z	runlevel-work	gravemind	is this a source code?
2007-03-01T15:56:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	this will allow you to install things from source
2007-03-01T15:57:00.000Z	runlevel-work	gravemind	ok so i need to upload synaptic?
2007-03-01T15:57:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	what are you trying to install, by the way?
2007-03-01T15:58:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	open synaptic, and search for "build-essential"
2007-03-01T15:58:00.000Z	runlevel-work	gravemind	do i have to compile synaptic first?
2007-03-01T15:58:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	no, synaptic is already installed.
2007-03-01T15:59:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	at the top of the screen there's a menu called system. click on it and go to administration, then go to synaptic
2007-03-01T15:59:00.000Z	runlevel-work	gravemind	click?
2007-03-01T15:59:00.000Z	gravemind	runlevel-work	lol...
