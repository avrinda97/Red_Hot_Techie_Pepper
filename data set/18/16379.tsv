2005-08-12T12:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_		how would I go about shrinking an ext3 partition??
2005-08-12T12:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	gparted or qtparted
2005-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	you shouldn't do that... you should keep a swap
2005-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	but... "sudo gparted" will help out
2005-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	good luck :)
2005-12-14T15:04:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	it's tough... if vino did reverse VNC, I'd be all about it
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	what format are both of them?  one is probably a swap
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	and inside that extended is something
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	/dev/hda1 == your install
2005-12-14T15:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	/dev/hda5 is probably a swap
2005-12-14T15:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	well, why do you have it, whats on it?  mount it?  u sure it's not a swap... gparted tells you
2005-12-14T15:07:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	it probably says something... what does it say under "Filesystem" ?
2005-12-14T15:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	unallocated shouldn't say anything because it's formatted
2005-12-14T15:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	are you sure hda1 says extended?  did you install ubuntu?
2005-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	unallocated means you can make a partition ont hat space
2005-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	now rezise your hda1 onto that unallocated area
2005-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	apply the changes to delete the first partition
2005-12-14T15:10:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ubuntu_	and what free space is left?  is there another partition at all? or just /dev/hda1
