2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	coroner	soulhack	i only just joined, forgive me if im off subject, are you trying to burn an iso using nero ?
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	soulhack	coroner	yes
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	soulhack		is that bad?
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	coroner		nah its fine, ill help you if you like
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	soulhack	coroner	yes, well, i think i did it already
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	soulhack		or, it's burning
2005-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	coroner		ahh good, you did tick the finish cd button aswell ?
2005-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	soulhack	coroner	i might have, not sure :S
2005-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	coroner		well if the cd doesnt load even after it says burn complete, chances are you need to tick the finilise cd tickbox. which means itll close the cd properly and not leave it open for more files later etc (multisession)
2005-03-18T17:54:00.000Z	soulhack	coroner	okay, i think i said i did not want to create a multisession.
2005-03-18T17:54:00.000Z	soulhack		But an ISO-image
2005-03-18T17:54:00.000Z	coroner	soulhack	yeah shouldnt have a problem then
