2008-02-18T09:51:00.000Z	jw144000		How do I write in Hebrew in Ubuntu?
2008-02-18T09:51:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	Do you have your keyboard set up yet?
2008-02-18T09:52:00.000Z	jw144000	emmajane	Yeah
2008-02-18T09:53:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	and the language pack?
2008-02-18T09:53:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	i.e. the locale....
2008-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	jw144000	emmajane	I don't know if I have the language pack installed.
2008-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	Give this page a try: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HebrewLocalizationHowto
2008-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	I think it's what you're looking for...
2008-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	jw144000	emmajane	OK, thanks.
2008-02-18T09:56:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	I haven't played with language switching in a while, but it used to be that you could install two different keyboard layouts for two different languages. I had french and english at one point and would switch between the two by pressing both "shift" keys at once. Is that what you're looking for?
2008-02-18T09:57:00.000Z	jw144000	emmajane	Yeah
2008-02-18T09:57:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	it was an internationalization option in KDE, but I don't know how it works in gnome. Hang on and I'll see if I can find it.
2008-02-18T10:06:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	Are you using the default Ubuntu install?
2008-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	Try this: System -> Preferences -> Keyboard -> Layouts -> Add... and choose the right layout
2008-02-18T10:09:00.000Z	emmajane	jw144000	I don't see how to do the double-shift short cut in Gnome though. :(

2008-02-18T10:24:00.000Z	jw144000	emmajane	I found out how to enable Hebrew using the switch key thing. I wish I could find a way to make the keyboard homophonic for Hebrew
2008-02-18T10:27:00.000Z	jw144000	emmajane	n/m, I figured it out
