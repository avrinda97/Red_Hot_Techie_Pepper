2011-03-12T01:04:00.000Z	MeanEYE	W43372	I'd like to help but I have no clue what the problem is...
2011-03-12T01:04:00.000Z	MeanEYE	W43372	am just saying so you know you are not being ignored...
2011-03-12T01:04:00.000Z	W43372	MeanEYE	My clock is wrong every time I reboot.
2011-03-12T01:05:00.000Z	MeanEYE	W43372	to which time clock resets?
2011-03-12T01:05:00.000Z	W43372	MeanEYE	Do what?

2011-03-12T01:07:00.000Z	W43372	MeanEYE	It's different every time.

2011-03-12T01:08:00.000Z	MeanEYE	W43372	hm, and it's always 5 hours behind?
2011-03-12T01:12:00.000Z	W43372	MeanEYE	I guess I assumed that when I typed my city in it would pick the time zone on it's own. I just went in and fixed all of it.
2011-03-12T01:13:00.000Z	MeanEYE	W43372	is it ok now?
2011-03-12T01:13:00.000Z	W43372	MeanEYE	Yeah, it's all good. But while I'
2011-03-12T01:14:00.000Z	W43372	MeanEYE	 But while I've got you here; I've noticed a few times when the machine is shutting down in the text part before it turns off there's a little red * and it says something about pulse audio, but the screen goes blank too fast for me to read anything about it
