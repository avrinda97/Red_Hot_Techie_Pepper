2008-09-26T08:27:00.000Z	XeKtRuM		better
2008-09-26T08:27:00.000Z	XeKtRuM		how can I disable a device
2008-09-26T08:27:00.000Z	XeKtRuM		?
2008-09-26T08:28:00.000Z	genii	XeKtRuM	blacklist it's driver
2008-09-26T08:28:00.000Z	XeKtRuM		damn
2008-09-26T08:28:00.000Z	XeKtRuM	genii	the problem it is that I have two devices using the same driver
2008-09-26T08:28:00.000Z	XeKtRuM		but I only want to disable 1
2008-09-26T08:29:00.000Z	genii	XeKtRuM	Some bios allow disabling of onboard devices like ethernet adapter, serial port,soundcard etc etc. Might be way to go if the one you don't want is onthe motherboard
2008-09-26T08:30:00.000Z	XeKtRuM	genii	in fact the one I need it is the one in the motherboard, and I need to disable the one from my Ati Card (I m talking about sound devices)
2008-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	genii	XeKtRuM	I think you'd have to muck around in the udev system for it, unfortunately
2008-09-26T08:33:00.000Z	XeKtRuM	genii	:o :( ok, thanks anyway
2008-09-26T08:33:00.000Z	genii	XeKtRuM	You might want to try setting the onboard as the primary
2008-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	XeKtRuM	genii	the only thing I want it is that my default soundcard (MB) goes in /dev/dsp and not in /dev/dsp1
2008-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	genii	XeKtRuM	asoundconf   has commands for listing and choosing the primary device for sound
2008-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	XeKtRuM	genii	my MB soundcard it is allready as the default one
2008-09-26T08:35:00.000Z	genii	XeKtRuM	No other immediate ideas come to mind then
2008-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	XeKtRuM		The thing it is that (I dont know Why) I cant reproduce systems sounds cause makes my system crash when playing sounds
2008-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	XeKtRuM	genii	and a lot of software dont work cause my sound card it is in /dev/dsp1 and not /dev/dsp
