2011-08-09T00:48:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	does it 'hang'?
2011-08-09T00:48:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	because if it does, it might be helpful to see a strace log.
2011-08-09T00:49:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	I don't know if it hangs, but I can close the window without problems.
2011-08-09T00:49:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	How do I do a tracelog?
2011-08-09T00:51:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	strace -o trace.log <program> I guess
2011-08-09T00:51:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	it might also be helpful to figure out if you could reproduce such a 'hang' behaviour with one of the alsa command line utils (the non-interactive ones i mean)
2011-08-09T00:52:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	I don't know any of them, so I will first have to investigate that
2011-08-09T00:53:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	I guess one of the first things alsamixer does is something like 'get a list of all available devices'.
2011-08-09T00:55:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	taht strace command gave me a pretty long doc, but I have no clue what I should look for.
2011-08-09T00:56:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	well...
2011-08-09T00:57:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	if the app 'hangs' then this log tells you 'where' it hangss.
2011-08-09T00:57:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	ah, okay.
2011-08-09T00:58:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	in that case the log would point you in the direction of the crash
2011-08-09T01:00:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	That gave me this in the terminal: (gnome-alsamixer:5614): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_type_instance_get_private: assertion `instance != NULL && instance->g_class != NULL' failed
2011-08-09T01:00:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	that's hardly a help, I think. :-(
2011-08-09T01:05:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	Sorry, computer crashed. I'll have a look at the tracelog
2011-08-09T01:06:00.000Z	melanie_	Mrokii	damnit! :-/
2011-08-09T01:15:00.000Z	Mrokii	melanie_	The trace is a very long document (not that it would tell me anything): http://pastebin.com/UXU01Jdt
