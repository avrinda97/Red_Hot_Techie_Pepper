2004-12-07T13:08:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	ummm have you tried more than one DVD?
2004-12-07T13:08:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	did you mount with sudo?
2004-12-07T13:09:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	to mount *anything* you need super user privileges.
2004-12-07T13:09:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	you need to mount as sudo.
2004-12-07T13:13:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	does it mount at all?
2004-12-07T13:13:00.000Z	darksword	socomm	?

2004-12-07T13:14:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	try another disk, maybe a store bought movie.
2004-12-07T13:15:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	shouldn't be /media/dvd or something
2004-12-07T13:15:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	`cd /media && ls'
2004-12-07T13:16:00.000Z	socomm	darksword	check what entries are there.
