2010-10-14T22:30:00.000Z	appi_uppi		Hi, While ubuntu 10.04 running on desktop PC suddenly pushes blink screen and then reboots.
2010-10-14T22:30:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	while doing what?
2010-10-14T22:31:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	any activity such as either browsing, etc
2010-10-14T22:32:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	heat buildup perhaps?
2010-10-14T22:32:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	no not really
2010-10-14T22:32:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	how do you figure?
2010-10-14T22:33:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	even for the first time login, I am not able view mouse pointer. I have lock and unlock to view pointer.
2010-10-14T22:34:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	may be compatibility issues?
2010-10-14T22:35:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	perhaps... when the system locks, can you use sysrq to restart or do you have to press the power/reset botton?
2010-10-14T22:36:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	I mean, for the first login I am not able to view mouse pointer. But When I manually lock the screen and later unlock it will make mouse pointer visible on the desktop.
2010-10-14T22:37:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	ooooooooh.... what kind of mouse?
2010-10-14T22:38:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	serial, samsung pleomax
2010-10-14T22:38:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	what computer accepts serial mice anymore?
2010-10-14T22:39:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	Its old desktop PC. 2.4 GHZ, Pentium 4 with 512 mb RAM
2010-10-14T22:41:00.000Z	appi_uppi	Gnea	I do have laptop. But I am yet install ubuntu 10.04. Presently I testing it on Desktop Personal Computer to check the performance and it is awesome.
2010-10-14T22:41:00.000Z	Gnea	appi_uppi	okay, can you get a USB mouse?
