2006-07-07T07:47:00.000Z	eternalsword		I tried to install ubuntu 6.06 amd64 version on a Dell with Pentium D.  Install completes successfully and grub loads fine, but when ubuntu is booting, it stalls at "Running local boot scripts".  Anyone have any idea what I can do?
2006-07-07T07:47:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	try rebooting and booting in safe mode, by hitting Esc when GRUB is loading
2006-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	still having the same problem?
2006-07-07T08:02:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	did booting in safe mode give any further insight?
2006-07-07T08:03:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	yup
2006-07-07T08:04:00.000Z	eternalsword	crouton	what exactly should I have been looking for?  the local script was all comments except for EXIT 0
2006-07-07T08:04:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	hmm, that's weird
2006-07-07T08:05:00.000Z	eternalsword	crouton	 it's a fresh install, not an upgrade
2006-07-07T08:06:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	strange. booting in safe mode should have given you more text to read, which might have helped narrow down the issue.
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	eternalsword	crouton	there were no problems when booting in safe mode.
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	the other thing you could try is to disable acpi when the machine boots.  You'd also do this in GRUB.
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	oh really? booted fully to login prompt?
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	eternalsword	crouton	fully to root
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	very interesting. desktop or server install?
2006-07-07T08:08:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	no, just curious. usually desktop loads more stuff
2006-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	eternalsword	crouton	actually to be more specific it has [ Ok ]  for the "Running local boot scripts" and then it stalls
2006-07-07T08:11:00.000Z	crouton	eternalsword	with the forums down, i can't really help much other than to say boot into safe mode and keep digging
2006-07-07T08:11:00.000Z	eternalsword	crouton	okay, thanks anyways.
