2010-11-06T03:47:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		err, wessel ^^
2010-11-06T03:47:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		!info x11vnc
2010-11-06T03:48:00.000Z	wessel	tonsofpcs	I never reinstalled something before on linux
2010-11-06T03:48:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	wessel	me neither
2010-11-06T03:48:00.000Z	wessel		I have only used sudo apt get install my file
2010-11-06T03:48:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	wessel	you could dpkg reconfigure [blah]
2010-11-06T03:49:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		vnc is not secure, ssh is.  You make VNC secure by creating a secure shell (ssh) tunnel, then run the vnc over it, rather than exposing vnc to the outside world
2010-11-06T03:49:00.000Z	wessel		well my eclipse is behaving weird, I would like to make a clean install, so I'm sure I can rule out any settings that I changed
2010-11-06T03:49:00.000Z	wessel		ah so the the command to reinstall is called reconfigure! :D
2010-11-06T03:50:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	wessel	apt-get remove [blah], apt-get clean, apt-get install [blah]  iirc, but that doesn't guarantee settings reset.  dpkg reconfigure resets settings (if the package was made right)
2010-11-06T03:50:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		you could also read the man page of [blah] to figrue out how to reset settings
2010-11-06T03:52:00.000Z	wessel		I'm not sure my dpkg has the reconfigure option
2010-11-06T03:52:00.000Z	wessel		it has --configure
2010-11-06T03:53:00.000Z	wessel		wessel@wegumar7 ~ $ sudo dpkg --configure eclipse
2010-11-06T03:53:00.000Z	wessel		dpkg: error processing eclipse (--configure):
2010-11-06T03:54:00.000Z	wessel	tonsofpcs	I'm pretty sure the eclipse package was made right
2010-11-06T03:54:00.000Z	wessel	tonsofpcs	or are you referring to the dpkg package?
2010-11-06T03:55:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	wessel	no, eclipse
