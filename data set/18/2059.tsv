2010-10-15T02:29:00.000Z	mostholy		hey, i have a question regarding hooking my laptop up to my TV set
2010-10-15T02:29:00.000Z	mostholy		anyone have any crunchbang experience?
2010-10-15T02:30:00.000Z	mostholy		i assume i can use similar applications for my crunchbang laptop as my ubuntu one
2010-10-15T02:30:00.000Z	mostholy		anyone know how hot get my laptop display to show up on my TV?
2010-10-15T02:30:00.000Z	mostholy		i've got it connected with a monitor cable
2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	using the fn key?
2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	mostholy	tarzeau	i'm not familiar with the term fn key.  i'm pretty new to linux in general
2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	tv monitors often can't do very high resolution, so set the output to something low
2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	there's a key on your laptop in another color, Fn or so? bottom left?
2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	mostholy	tarzeau	its a Hi Def TV
2010-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	mostholy	tarzeau	you still here?
2010-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	sure
2010-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	the Fn key is like shift or ctrl or alt
2010-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	it's dead, pressed alonely. but combined with the right other key, it's very powerful
2010-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	check the color of the fn letters on the key
2010-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	then look for this color on other keys
2010-10-15T02:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	it should look like a screen symbol, that which will switch outputs
2010-10-15T02:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	mostholy	it's very cool that you know the Fn key
