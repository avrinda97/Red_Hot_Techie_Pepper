2008-07-18T07:23:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	this book worked for u ?
2008-07-18T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	I used it a lot once
2008-07-18T07:24:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	i hopefully work for me.. because over the internet we found a lot of old tutorials right ?
2008-07-18T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	the basic admin is the same everywhere, since it's based on unix. Each distro has it's quirks at higher levels.
2008-07-18T07:26:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	look,, i got ubuntu server, but i'd like to be a guru at red hat
2008-07-18T07:26:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	for better job
2008-07-18T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	then you will need to use redhat. The configuration of each system (apache, bind, etc) is fundamentally the same, so your skills will transfer simply, but the do lay out the configs slightly differently
2008-07-18T07:28:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	i think the same , where can i get a copy of redhat ?
2008-07-18T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	you can get fedora for free, it's sorta the alpha of red hat.
2008-07-18T07:30:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	but anyway can i read the rute book ?
2008-07-18T07:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	absolutely
2008-07-18T07:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	you will learn a lot about basic stuff, that is the same everywhere
2008-07-18T07:32:00.000Z	Dewente	nickrud	I appreciate your help brother
2008-07-22T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Dewente	shell, sed, awk then
