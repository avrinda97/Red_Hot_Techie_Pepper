2009-09-26T07:07:00.000Z	Shidash		So I am looking for any possible suggestions. I am getting quite desperate. Not having sound is a pretty major issue for me.
2009-09-26T07:08:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Is this with Pulseaudio?
2009-09-26T07:08:00.000Z	Shidash	XDevHald	ALSA or Pulseaudio, I can't tell
2009-09-26T07:10:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Try that first and let us know back on this channel
2009-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	What Architecture do you run? I.E: Amd64 etc
2009-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	Shidash	XDevHald	Not sure
2009-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Goto System > System Monitor and select the "System" tab
2009-09-26T07:21:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	It will say "Processor"
2009-09-26T07:23:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	This is 9.04...
2009-09-26T07:24:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Did you ever find out what processor you're running?
2009-09-26T07:25:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Thanks, just a sec
2009-09-26T07:26:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure
2009-09-26T07:30:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	I see you have alsa-base 1.0.18rc3 - Did you see that there is a full development for 1.0.18.dfsg-1ubuntu8 ?
2009-09-26T07:31:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Also make sure you have alsa-utils 1.0.18-1ubuntu11
2009-09-26T07:33:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	Type in synaptic: alsa
2009-09-26T07:39:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	To the right of the repo name does it show the version?
2009-09-26T07:44:00.000Z	Shidash	XDevHald	Check your PMs.
2009-09-26T08:29:00.000Z	XDevHald	Shidash	You are VERY welcome
