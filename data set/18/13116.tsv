2006-01-08T13:49:00.000Z	jenda		Help! xmms and OO.org segfault immediatly after startup! It worked fine yesterday and now it doesn't
2006-01-08T13:49:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	Have you installed or updated anything since yesterday?
2006-01-08T13:50:00.000Z	jenda	PuMpErNiCkLe	Yes, I have, I installed the nvidia driver
2006-01-08T13:51:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	Anything else?
2006-01-08T13:51:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	Or just the driver?
2006-01-08T13:52:00.000Z	jenda	PuMpErNiCkLe	hmm... just the driver, i.e. I installed the kernel module, ... and I did install lynx
2006-01-08T13:53:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	That doesn't sound like it should cause any problems with OOo... 0_0
2006-01-08T13:54:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	Is reinstalling OO.o and xmms in synaptic easily manageable for you?
2006-01-08T13:55:00.000Z	jenda	PuMpErNiCkLe	yes, no too bad. Dow big would that be...
2006-01-08T13:56:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	*big*
2006-01-08T13:56:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	couple hundred MB
2006-01-08T13:57:00.000Z	jenda	PuMpErNiCkLe	I'll start out by reinstalling xmms and then I'll see if it helps
2006-01-08T13:57:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	okay
2006-01-08T13:59:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	apt-get install nvidia-glx failed?
2006-01-08T14:00:00.000Z	jenda	PuMpErNiCkLe	odat: Yes, it failed.
2006-01-08T14:12:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	There should be an uninstall script with the nVidia download.
2006-01-08T14:16:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	possibly...
2006-01-08T14:16:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	jenda	I commented it out, so I dunno :)
