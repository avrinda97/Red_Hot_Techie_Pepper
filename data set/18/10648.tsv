2006-11-09T11:59:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	nvidia didn't load even after the restart. i get the same warning.
2006-11-09T12:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	Try asking on #ubuntu-xgl , just tell them you just need help with the drivers and not XGL.
2006-11-09T12:01:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	okay thanks
2006-11-09T12:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	you can check the version with: uname -r.
2006-11-09T12:15:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	it says i am using 2.6.17-10-386, that should be fine for nvidia-glx right?
2006-11-09T12:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	No, it should be 2.6.17-10-generic
2006-11-09T12:17:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	oh, in the wiki it said the generic would crash x, how do i change to generic?
2006-11-09T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	It said generic would crash X? I didn't realize that.
2006-11-09T12:18:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	maybe that was for dapper or something
2006-11-09T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	Can you give me a link to the guide you are using?
2006-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia?highlight=%28nvidia%29
2006-11-09T12:25:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	 here is the excerpt: Note: you have to select the restricted modules first because the nvidia-glx package automatically installs the i386 one - and if you have a generic kernel image, the X will not work
2006-11-09T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	Blame the ambiguity of the English language! I think the wiki means that the 386 will break x , not the generic :)
2006-11-09T12:30:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	huh. well i guess it is good that it didn't install.
2006-11-09T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	So uninstall the 386, install the generic, install the restricted modules, then install the nvidea drivers, in that order.
2006-11-09T12:30:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	how do i remove the 386, is it the linux-restricted-modules?
2006-11-09T12:39:00.000Z	tich_	Jordan_U	you were so right, that seems to have worked. i am going to check my xorg.conf right now.
2006-11-09T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tich_	:)
