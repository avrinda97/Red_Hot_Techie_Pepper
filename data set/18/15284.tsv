2005-04-16T15:14:00.000Z	samuel		hello all
2005-04-16T15:14:00.000Z	samuel		anyone here switched over from debian?
2005-04-16T15:15:00.000Z	samuel		to sid?
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	samuel		hmmmmm......
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	samuel		sounds like not really worth changing over from sid
2005-04-16T15:17:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	i came from sid because ubuntu is stable, i.e. changes only two times a year :)
2005-04-16T15:18:00.000Z	samuel	topyli	hahaha, i just broke my X-server on sid yesterday, so i thought that would be a good excuse to try it out
2005-04-16T15:21:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	go ahead, it's nice and works out of the box
2005-04-16T15:22:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	which is sort of sad because half the fun in a virgin debian installation is the set-it-up-so-it-works-for-you part :)
2005-04-16T15:23:00.000Z	samuel	topyli	two questions: does it have synaptic and are debs interchangable?
2005-04-16T15:23:00.000Z	samuel	topyli	as in are debs interchangable between ubuntu and debian?
2005-04-16T15:24:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	synaptic is the primary tool. all the debs are recompiled and put to ubuntu repos. it's nice
2005-04-16T15:25:00.000Z	samuel	topyli	debs are recompiled? so if i have my own debs i will need to recompile them? or are they just recompiled for branding purposes?
2005-04-16T15:26:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	they're recompiled on ubuntu to make sure they work. debian debs may work too (your own debs probably will), but it's all there in the ubuntu repos anyway
2005-04-16T15:26:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	also, because ubuntu is frozen every six months and unstable is unstable you never know when unstable debs work and when not
2005-04-16T15:27:00.000Z	samuel	topyli	ok, thanks for all the info... gonna go leave the download alone now, hopefully next time im in this chat its on an ubuntu distro
2005-08-02T08:31:00.000Z	topyli	samuel	archive.ubuntu.com
2005-08-02T08:31:00.000Z	samuel	topyli	aaa, thanks
