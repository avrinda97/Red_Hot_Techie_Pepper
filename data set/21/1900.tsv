2010-03-23T10:43:00.000Z	traeq	stsm	yes. that's exactly it
2010-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	yes then it might be the best to just output what ever comes in from your mic (on the ubuntu laptop)
2010-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	traeq		okay. and as you said previously, you don't know which setting does this?
2010-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	i'm gonna go for a smoke and a new cup of coffee, if you didn't find the setting then i'll try to find it
2010-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	traeq	stsm	okay, i'll keep you posted
2010-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	but now your question is much more simple: "how can i output whatever comes in trough my microphone"
2010-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	ok brb, good luck
2010-03-23T10:53:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	so did you find it?
2010-03-23T11:09:00.000Z	traeq		Well, that's interesting.
2010-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	traeq	stsm	it turns out that I have a bigger problem than I thought
2010-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	traeq	stsm	thanks for your advice and everything. if i hadn't looked where i looked, i don't think i would have ever found this out
2010-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	traeq		i don't think the microphone i was planning on using even works, now
2010-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	thats kindof essential :p
2010-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	traeq		yes, i agree. :)
2010-03-23T11:11:00.000Z	traeq		the weird thing is, that my laptop has a built in mic
2010-03-23T11:11:00.000Z	traeq		i assumed that when i could record successfully, it was going through the headset by default
2010-03-23T11:11:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	check if it has a volume control in the cable, if its really broken, you could use a mp3 player or something similar, with a audio cable
2010-03-23T11:11:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	for testing i mean of course
2010-03-23T11:11:00.000Z	traeq		it does have a volume control, but i've already set it as high as it goes
2010-03-23T11:12:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	no you can also record without something plugged in
2010-03-23T11:12:00.000Z	stsm	traeq	but since its a laptop it might also have a builtin mic
