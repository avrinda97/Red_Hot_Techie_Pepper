2010-08-14T08:57:00.000Z	st__	xissburg	depends on version, but most likely you want repair
2010-08-14T08:58:00.000Z	st__	xissburg	then you'll be able to boot windows and invesgate further
2010-08-14T08:58:00.000Z	xissburg	st__	repair, yea I got there but what I have to do there? I tired FIXBOOT, FIXMBR...
2010-08-14T08:59:00.000Z	st__	xissburg	if you would really tried fixboot or fixmbr, you wouldn't have 'grub rescue' prompt
