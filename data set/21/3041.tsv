2011-10-06T04:35:00.000Z	launch		Hi all, Ubuntu 11.10 will be a lts or not?
2011-10-06T04:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	no, it will not be
2011-10-06T04:36:00.000Z	launch	mbeierl	thanks, and ill be able to upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10?
2011-10-06T04:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	iirc, the LTS are every two years: 8.04, 10.04, making the next 12.03
2011-10-06T04:37:00.000Z	mbeierl		c/03/04/
2011-10-06T04:37:00.000Z	launch		Can we upgrade from a non lts to a lts?
2011-10-06T04:37:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	yes, the upgrade will be presented to you once 11.10 is official
2011-10-06T04:38:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	the LTS is no different than any other release, if you upgrade every 6 months.
2011-10-06T04:38:00.000Z	launch	mbeierl	right thanks ;)
2011-10-06T04:38:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	it's just for those who want long term consistency, LTS to LTS gives you 2 years without major changes
2011-10-06T04:38:00.000Z	launch	mbeierl	its even better since i got more recent software on no lts version?
2011-10-06T04:39:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	sorry, I don't quite understand the question.
2011-10-06T04:39:00.000Z	launch	mbeierl	i think i prefer upgrading each 6 month and get latest software version
2011-10-06T04:40:00.000Z	launch		10.04 for example got firefox 3
2011-10-06T04:40:00.000Z	launch		we are now at firefox 7
2011-10-06T04:40:00.000Z	launch		..
2011-10-06T04:41:00.000Z	launch	mbeierl	i will not necessary get into trouble if i choose a non lts version?
2011-10-06T04:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	that is true, the LTS will not introduce new versions as quickly.  Once they are proven stable and useful, they probably wil get backported to LTS. But, no, sticking with 6 month releases will not get you into trouble. Installing the alphas probably will, and the betas could too :)
2011-10-06T04:43:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	the only real reason to stick with LTS is for low-volume churn in the applications/user interface/etc.  As an example: the 11.04 introduction of Unity upset a lot of people.  LTS users would not even hear of Unity until 12.04
2011-10-06T04:43:00.000Z	launch	mbeierl	thanks
2011-10-06T04:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	launch	you're welcome!
