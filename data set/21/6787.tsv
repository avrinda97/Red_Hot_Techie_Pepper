2007-07-03T06:13:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	explain your problem to me and i'll see if i can help.
2007-07-03T06:14:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	did you dual boot or did you overwrite your windows install?
2007-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	i know... you can either repair grub and boot into windows... or you can repair the windows MBR
2007-07-03T06:18:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	if i were you and i didnt have a windows xp cd...
2007-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	ubuntu is still on it
2007-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	AT THE COMMAND LINE DO A "fdisk -l" and look for the drive that has NTFS.
2007-07-03T06:32:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	grub-install /dev/hda
2007-07-03T06:32:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	i meant "sudo grub-install /dev/hda"
2007-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	ubuntu is installed on your slave or master drive?
2007-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	how did you "remove it"?
2007-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	rich115	then your only option is a Windows XP cd.
