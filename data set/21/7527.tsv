2006-09-11T14:33:00.000Z	geoaxis		hello people , can any one suggest how to improve UI performance of Gnome in ubuntu
2006-09-11T14:34:00.000Z	geoaxis		switching to some other WM is not an attactive option for me
2006-09-11T14:35:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	there's some lightweight themes in gnome, like mist
2006-09-11T14:37:00.000Z	geoaxis	sp0rk	, intel builtin mother board
2006-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	check out some of the other themes that gnome has, some are lighter on resources than other
2006-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	geoaxis	sp0rk	, and uglier too
2006-09-11T14:39:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	well, that's what you ahve to work with! haha...all i can say is try a different WM
2006-09-11T14:41:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	why is changing your wm not an option?
2006-09-11T14:42:00.000Z	geoaxis	sp0rk	, i am trying to setup a system for a friend , so that its compareable to WInXP in look and feel , ease of use install etc
2006-09-11T14:42:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	try xfce, it's lighter than gnome but still fairly usable
2006-09-11T14:44:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	i would say that's a waste of time, you can switch from the command line
2006-09-11T14:44:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2006-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	howso?
2006-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	yeah, it can be...and that's just a sudo apt-get install kubuntu away
2006-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	geoaxis	sp0rk	: get X configured for 3d rendering
2006-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	what kind of card does the box have?
2006-09-11T14:48:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	i don't think there are binary drivers for that, so what you've got is as configured as it'll get
2006-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	seriously, give xfce a try
2006-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	you *might not* be able to get 3d working on that card, and it might not even be worth it
2006-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	i think it would
2006-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	sp0rk	geoaxis	and if it didn't, you could just get it as his default session from the gdm login screen
