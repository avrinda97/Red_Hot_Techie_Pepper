2009-11-02T04:46:00.000Z	aquachica		Pulseaudio bug fix didn't work for me.  Sound Preferences still doesn't see my hardware.  When I select Alsa and test, I do get a beep.
2009-11-02T04:47:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	if you do get a beep then it should woprk. just disregard sound prefferences
2009-11-02T04:47:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	get the gnome alsa mixer out of the repository for control
2009-11-02T04:47:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	The problem is that I still do not hear audio when I play files.
2009-11-02T04:47:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	gotcha. did you try changing the hardware profiles?
2009-11-02T04:48:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	How do I do both?
2009-11-02T04:48:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	and what sound card do you have?
2009-11-02T04:48:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	HDA Intel
2009-11-02T04:49:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	in the Multimedia Systems Selector, change the "device" pulldown to other things listed there and test them all
2009-11-02T04:50:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	Alsa and OSS both give me a beep, but Alsa allows me to select a device "ALC861".
2009-11-02T04:50:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	Pulseaudio does not give me a beep.

2009-11-02T06:38:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	glad to know you got it straightened out. thanks for the update :)
2009-11-02T06:31:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	I finally did it.  I removed Ubuntu from my computer.  After looking at the Live CD, I think all of my problems had to do with the network upgrade.
2009-11-02T06:39:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	You're welcome. I am NEVER updating over the network again.
2009-11-02T06:39:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	I had better results with the LiveCD, but it still had an issue with the Dummy Audio. It did see my hardware though.
2009-11-02T06:41:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	so you're not having the popping issue though?
2009-11-02T06:42:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	I did not notice it with the LiveCD, but I can tell you once I have finished installing 9.10.
2009-11-02T06:47:00.000Z	TheCheeze	aquachica	sounds good. gonna be afk for a bit putting the baby sto sleep so fel free to pm me results
2009-11-02T06:48:00.000Z	aquachica	TheCheeze	okay.
