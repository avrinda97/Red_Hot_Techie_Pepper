2009-04-22T13:09:00.000Z	crushyy		is there anyway to undo what fsck has done to my drive?
2009-04-22T13:10:00.000Z	gm|lap	crushyy	i have a feeling that there isn't. what did it do?
2009-04-22T13:10:00.000Z	gm|lap		consider that this isn't windows, as, well, there isn't any undelete mechanism in ext2 to start with
2009-04-22T13:10:00.000Z	crushyy	gm|lap	it made all my files and folder gone. and now all i have is a folder lost+found in my drive
2009-04-22T13:11:00.000Z	gm|lap		ouch.
2009-04-22T13:11:00.000Z	gm|lap		what's in that folder, anyway?
2009-04-22T13:11:00.000Z	crushyy		some million folders like #10087123 etc
2009-04-22T13:11:00.000Z	gm|lap		either fsck is broken or your hard drive is SEVERELY broken
2009-04-22T13:11:00.000Z	crushyy		and some thousands files like #02348234 also
2009-04-22T13:12:00.000Z	gm|lap		i take it you've booted onto a livecd?
2009-04-22T13:12:00.000Z	crushyy		hard drive is fine. its just one partition of that.
2009-04-22T13:12:00.000Z	crushyy		drive wasnt corrupted :( it did. now i cant even recover
2009-04-22T13:12:00.000Z	crushyy		is there anyway i can recover my projcets and files?
2009-04-22T13:13:00.000Z	crushyy	gm|lap	no i am on windows for the moment
2009-04-22T13:13:00.000Z	gm|lap		so how did you find that out?
2009-04-22T13:14:00.000Z	crushyy		i found it when i booted on livecd as well as ext2fs
2009-04-22T13:16:00.000Z	crushyy	gm|lap	anyway i can recover my files back? those are .frm files of my visual basic project which i stored there
2009-04-22T13:17:00.000Z	gm|lap	crushyy	it's VERY tricky to pull off, ESPECIALLY with a binary file like a .frm file
2009-04-22T13:17:00.000Z	gm|lap		the trick involves searching /dev/hda or /dev/sda or whatever the harddrive is
2009-04-22T13:17:00.000Z	crushyy	gm|lap	.frm is not binary files, they suppose to be plain text (syntax infact)
2009-04-22T13:19:00.000Z	gm|lap	crushyy	what's your harddrive device called in linux?
