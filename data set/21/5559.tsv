2009-09-10T07:18:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	have you looked at the !appdb ?
2009-09-10T07:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	it gets a good rating on appdb
2009-09-10T07:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	you probably need to run it as wine cdrom/installer.exe
2009-09-10T07:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	do you know how to use a terminal?
2009-09-10T07:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	well, on the teminal: cd /media/cdrom
2009-09-10T07:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	where is the cdrom mounted?
2009-09-10T07:39:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	when you open it, what is the location?
2009-09-10T07:44:00.000Z	G-man	danbhfive	anthony@anthony-desktop:/media/cdrom0$
2009-09-10T07:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	what is the name of the .exe?
2009-09-10T07:45:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	so try: cd /media/cdrom0 && wine setup.exe
2009-09-10T07:49:00.000Z	G-man	danbhfive	 did you catch that?
2009-09-10T07:50:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	ok, im looking now.  Hmm, do you get any errors on the terminal?
2009-09-10T07:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	have you tried installing the latest wine?
2009-09-10T07:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	try this site, add the repo so you can get the beta version of wine: http://www.winehq.org/download/deb

2009-09-10T07:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	Adding the WineHQ APT Repository:
2009-09-10T07:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	maybe, do you have your graphics driver installed?
2009-09-10T07:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	G-man	well, I would try installing the wine
