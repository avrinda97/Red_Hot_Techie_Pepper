2011-05-19T16:51:00.000Z	natalie		is vlc and skype not in the lubuntu repos
2011-05-19T16:51:00.000Z	natalie		??
2011-05-19T16:53:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	nothing is compatible with skype, they use a proprietary codec and API for their software
2011-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	have you ever used a PPA before?
2011-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	natalie	gaelfx	maybe, not familiar with the name, but from the literature its a package source right?
2011-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	yeah, sort of, you might want to look for a Skype PPA and add that instead
2011-05-19T16:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	that way, in 50 years when they update Skype for linux again, you won't have to download and install it again
2011-05-19T17:03:00.000Z	natalie	gaelfx	google for ppa skype ubuntu brings me http://www.ehow.com/how_5665129_install-skype-ubuntu.html but it doesnt feel right
2011-05-19T17:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	PPA's should only come from launchpad.net
2011-05-19T17:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	alternatively, you could try imo messenger, it's web-based, but I don't know if it does video
2011-05-19T17:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	(you can use your skype for chatting there, no calls though, afaik)

2011-05-19T17:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	wait, nevermind, that's old
2011-05-19T17:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	did you try opening the skype.deb with dpkg?
2011-05-19T17:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	seems like the medibuntu method on the ehow site is the best way to go
2011-05-19T17:13:00.000Z	natalie	gaelfx	thanks, will try now
2011-05-19T17:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	fml?

2011-05-19T17:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	natalie	haha, ok, I got it, my leetspeak is off today. At least it works, right?
2011-05-19T17:27:00.000Z	natalie	gaelfx	thank god for that, and thanks for your help. this girl made it a prerequsite and im trying to impress her
