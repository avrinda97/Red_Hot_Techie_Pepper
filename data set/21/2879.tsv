2009-05-27T03:36:00.000Z	jvogel		hi
2009-05-27T03:36:00.000Z	jvogel		i figured i can ask the same question in here as in debian
2009-05-27T03:37:00.000Z	jvogel		Hi - I want to update my kernel to 2.6.29 and i was wondering what's the best way to do this.  I found this: http://wiki.debian.org/iwlagn but that says "experimental" ... what does it mean by experimental? is the kernel still "stable"?
2009-05-27T03:37:00.000Z	jvogel		18:33 < jvogel> i'm running squeeze, an image i made a couple weeks ago
2009-05-27T03:37:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	the kernel has always had "safe/stable" and "experimental" code
2009-05-27T03:37:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	even tho they say "experimenta" isnt 2.6.29 labeled "stable"?
2009-05-27T03:38:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	...again
2009-05-27T03:38:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	the kernel has always had experimental code
2009-05-27T03:38:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	if you choose not to include it, your kernel is stable
2009-05-27T03:42:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	it says "# aptitude install linux-image-2.6.29-1-686"
2009-05-27T03:42:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	what is -1-686 ?
2009-05-27T03:43:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	i assume a version number, but how do i know the latest?
2009-05-27T03:43:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	686 means it's for i686 machines, which yours supports
2009-05-27T03:43:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	and -1 means revision one by the ubuntu team to 2.6.29, i believe
2009-05-27T03:43:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	if im running amd64 what od i put?
2009-05-27T03:44:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	aptitude search linux-image will help you :D
2009-05-27T03:44:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	oops forgot!
2009-05-27T03:46:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	It's not listing 2.6.29 image...
2009-05-27T03:47:00.000Z	raylu	jvogel	whta does it list?
2009-05-27T03:47:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	oops misconfigured my sources.list
2009-05-27T03:47:00.000Z	jvogel	raylu	let me try again
