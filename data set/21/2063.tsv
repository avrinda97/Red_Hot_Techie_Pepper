2010-01-31T12:28:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_		hey all, is it possible to update gnome environment without reinstalling ubuntu?
2010-01-31T12:29:00.000Z	ascheel	GabrielSOE_	do you want to go from Kubuntu to Ubuntu or what?
2010-01-31T12:30:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	I don't understand, I mean when I have an earlier version of gnome can i update it without reinstalling the system?
2010-01-31T12:31:00.000Z	ascheel	GabrielSOE_	what version of Ubuntu are you on?
2010-01-31T12:39:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	ubuntu 9.10
2010-01-31T12:39:00.000Z	ascheel	GabrielSOE_	what was that a response to?
2010-01-31T12:40:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	the version I'm running
2010-01-31T12:40:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	the version I'm running 9.10
2010-01-31T12:41:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	the version I'm running 2.28.1
2010-01-31T12:41:00.000Z	ascheel	GabrielSOE_	so you need to upgrade gnome?  To which version?  Or do you just need to reinstall?  What problem are you having?
2010-01-31T12:42:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	Idon't really have a problem, I just want to know how do I install or reinstall Gnome or upgrade a version without reinstalling the system
2010-01-31T12:44:00.000Z	ascheel	GabrielSOE_	if you want to reinstall gnome, sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome   But why do you need to reinstall it?  You got settings problems?
2010-01-31T12:45:00.000Z	GabrielSOE_	ascheel	not really just wanted to know how it's done. just incase
2010-01-31T12:45:00.000Z	ascheel	GabrielSOE_	reinstallations are rarely needed.  If you needed to reset the settings in your login, just delete the .gconf directory in your home directory.  Boom, factory setup.
