2010-01-16T00:43:00.000Z	ekristen		good afternoon
2010-01-16T00:43:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	evening
2010-01-16T00:44:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	would you perhaps have powerstepping on?
2010-01-16T00:44:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	not familiar with that? what is it?
2010-01-16T00:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	when the applications and programs need more processing power, the processor speed is hastened
2010-01-16T00:46:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	it's to do with powersaving and overheating
2010-01-16T00:48:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	any problems with disabling it? I am trying to verify that it does change
2010-01-16T00:49:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	I see it fluctuating
2010-01-16T00:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	if you don't mind an increased powerusage, shorter batterylife if using a laptop and perhaps a bit higher CPU temperatures, then no. But for normal user, there's no need to disable it
2010-01-16T00:50:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	its a media center, encoding a lot of video
2010-01-16T00:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	the cpu speed should go up when needed
2010-01-16T00:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	you'll probably not even notice a difference in performance, how much RAM do you have?
2010-01-16T00:51:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	I'd say adding that RAM will have more effect on the performance :-)
2010-01-16T00:52:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	definitely
2010-01-16T00:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	yes?
2010-01-16T00:53:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	if you click the "Alternative download options, including Ubuntu installer for Windows", you'll see an option for 64-bit
2010-01-16T00:53:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	and for other download options too
2010-01-16T00:54:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	that should help too ;)
2010-01-16T00:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	np
2010-01-16T01:54:00.000Z	ekristen	Myrtti	9.10 refuses to see my hard drive, previous version looks fine
2010-01-16T01:55:00.000Z	Myrtti	ekristen	do you have encrypted stuff?
