2007-03-23T06:44:00.000Z	robe_		There's a way to download some package avoiding the use of Synaptic Package Manager?
2007-03-23T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	what irc client are you using?
2007-03-23T06:45:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	xchat from ubuntu 6.10
2007-03-23T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	you should have another tab at the bottom that says "ubotu".  If you click on it, you can read the information ubotu sent you about APT.  See it?
2007-03-23T06:46:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	yes
2007-03-23T06:48:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	I've used Synaptic Package Manager to install my package and it work well. But now the network administrator set passwords in the proxy for each user and the Synaptic Package Manager failed to download the package. Do you know why happen that?
2007-03-23T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	did you go to system > preferences > network proxy and set up the proxy including your password?
2007-03-23T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	and synaptic also has proxy settings in it's edit menu:  preferences > network
2007-03-23T06:53:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	I've configured the network proxy in System/Preference/Network proxy but anyway I can't download any package
2007-03-23T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	right, how about in synaptic's network settings?
2007-03-23T06:54:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	I've tried there but I don't see the option to set the user and password
2007-03-23T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	ok, I'm not on edgy atm... butunder the Network tab, there is no "authentication" button?
2007-03-23T06:55:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	no
2007-03-23T06:56:00.000Z	jrib		!aptproxy | robe_
2007-03-23T06:56:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	I've tried in the form "http://user:password@server:port" but it doesn't work
2007-03-23T06:57:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	OK, I'll see it right now!
2007-03-23T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	robe_	sorry, I thought that was simpler... see this post: http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/debian-linux-help/55599-configuring-proxy-synaptic-package-manager-ubuntu.html
2007-03-23T06:57:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	Ok, thanx
2007-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	That doesn't work :-(
2007-03-23T07:18:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	I'm downloading the package through "apt-get install"
2007-03-23T07:18:00.000Z	robe_	jrib	exporting the variable "http_proxy" ;-)
