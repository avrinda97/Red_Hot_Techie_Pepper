2008-08-14T02:33:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	why don't you like pidgin?
2008-08-14T02:34:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	not very customizable and i don't like the ui :/
2008-08-14T02:34:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	you can always switch to Windows and wait for Alpha .... :D
2008-08-14T02:34:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	windows has miranda im :(
2008-08-14T02:34:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	never really got to like it.
2008-08-14T02:35:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	you need to spend some time configuring it, but after that it's the best
2008-08-14T02:35:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	always used trillian and liked it
2008-08-14T02:35:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	i liked trillian too, until i used miranda
2008-08-14T02:35:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	it's MUCH lighter
2008-08-14T02:36:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	Alpha is the "new" Trillian ... has been announced for over a year now
2008-08-14T02:36:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	hmm, wasn't that out a year ago?
2008-08-14T02:36:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	oh
2008-08-14T02:36:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	the trillian that's supposed to run off the browser?
2008-08-14T02:37:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	trillian astra?
2008-08-14T02:37:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	I checked last week and it is still alpha version - but it is the new way of instant messenging
2008-08-14T02:37:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	i used that about a year ago
2008-08-14T02:37:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	it wasn't all that great
2008-08-14T02:38:00.000Z	juro	Stavros	how could it be. the only thing that they can get new users with is integrating Slype
2008-08-14T02:38:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	well, it was too heavy, not pretty enough...
2008-08-14T02:38:00.000Z	Stavros	juro	you couldn't customize everything...
