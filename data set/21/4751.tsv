2009-11-28T03:16:00.000Z	DaZ	owen1	on some sites flash doesn't cache
2009-11-28T03:17:00.000Z	owen1	DaZ	i watched a youtube video, i can download the flv from about:cache
2009-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	owen1	DaZ	btw, i think that about:cache is getting it from youtube and not from my local machine.
2009-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	DaZ	owen1	youtube caches in /tmp
2009-11-28T03:19:00.000Z	owen1	DaZ	where in /tmp. i have 2 folders starts at pulse* but i can't access them.
