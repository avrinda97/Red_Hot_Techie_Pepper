2007-03-04T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	gksu "update-manager -c"
2007-03-04T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	Since Dapper is a LTS, it won't nag you about Edgy unless you ask (with the -c)
2007-03-04T14:43:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	that's what I did, but then i get a message saying my system is up to date
2007-03-04T14:43:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	you didn't add the -c probably
2007-03-04T14:43:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	but i did :)
2007-03-04T14:45:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	er, no -d, that's if you're on edgy and wan to upgrade to feisty (while still unstable).  You should use gksu not sudo, but I don't think that'd cause the problem.  I don't know.
2007-03-04T14:46:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	I have edgy cd, and I could upadet from the cd, but I'm afraid that the programs on the cd are not latest versions compared to what I have on my laptop (with usual updates for dapper)... so do you think such an update would make sense...?
2007-03-04T14:48:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	I've just tried with gksu, but the same shit happens again :(
2007-03-04T14:48:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	pastebin your sources.list
2007-03-04T14:49:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	what was the link for that?
2007-03-04T14:52:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	it's on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8675/
2007-03-04T14:55:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	I don't know.  Looks like everything is in order.  You probably don't want to upgrade though, automatix is liable to break your system on upgrade.
2007-03-04T14:56:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	actually, update-manager could be seeing the third party packages and refusing to upgrade... but, I don't know if it'd do that.
2007-03-04T14:56:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	yes, that's what I'm afarid of too :d You think I should wait then for feisty?
2007-03-04T14:57:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	Feisty won't be any better (unlessyou were planning on installing Feisty clean).  To upgrade to feisty, you'd still have to upgrade through edgy.
2007-03-04T14:57:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	and what if I update from the cd I have already? do you think that would be the best solution maybe?
2007-03-04T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	do you have the Desktop CD or the Altenrate CD?
2007-03-04T14:59:00.000Z	renu	Flannel	 i have a desktop one at the moment, but i can easily download the other one, if you that that'd be better (forgot to lighten you :)
2007-03-04T14:59:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	I don't think it'd help anyway, probably the same issue you have now.  What you might want to do is check out launchpad.net for bugs in update-manager.  Someone might have had this same thing, and a workaround is available, or whatnot (or an explanation)
2007-03-04T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	renu	another place you might look would be the forums (ubuntuforums.org)
