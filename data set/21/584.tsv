2011-09-15T01:32:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	the apt-get does not utilise the aptdeamon, so if the aptdeamon is not installed properly or such, apt-get might work, but software updater and software center will not
2011-09-15T01:33:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	Do you know how I can fix this (  aptdeamon  ) ?
2011-09-15T01:34:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	My internet connection has been really slow this past week, could that be the problem?
2011-09-15T01:35:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	you could try aptitude reinstall aptdeamon
2011-09-15T01:36:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	Ok, How do I put it in the terminal, I'm not too hot on the codes. I am really new to Linux.
2011-09-15T01:36:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	sudo apt-get install aptitude
2011-09-15T01:37:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	sudo aptitude reinstall aptdeamon
2011-09-15T01:38:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	Ok, Oh forgot I'm installing Ubuntu restricted extras! Damn. Ok thanks for the help.:-))
2011-09-18T16:23:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	are you running Unity?
2011-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	Yes, :D
2011-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	try installing unity-2d instead, you might have better luck
2011-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	just do sudo apt-get install unity-2d
2011-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	Ok I'm doing it now. But may I ask why Ubuntu has made 11.04 like this. You can't add things on the top or side toolbar. You can't move your windows around. I thought it was supposed to be user friendly? I'm finding it very difficult to work with, and I know my way around Ubuntu.
2011-09-18T16:30:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	If you decide you prefer gnome, you can select Ubuntu Classic in the bottom menu of the login screen, then the user interface will be the same as v10.10
2011-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	whether you decide to run Unity-2d or gnome, you will have to select it (on first run) at login time, from the menu that appears when you have clicked your username, but not entered your password
2011-09-18T16:34:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	Ok it's installed. I went into the classic Ubuntu in the log on screen. But the windows were all under the top tool bar and I could not move it,
2011-09-18T16:45:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	How do I maximise and minimise the windows?, the maximise and minimise button has gone and it's been replaced by the name of the program.? How do I get it back?
2011-09-18T16:48:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	you can edit the settings with gconf-editor
2011-09-18T16:48:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	you might have to install it first.
2011-09-18T16:49:00.000Z	RedViper	jwrigley	But it was working just now?
2011-09-18T16:50:00.000Z	jwrigley	RedViper	please explain the situation, I am not quite with you.
