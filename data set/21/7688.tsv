2006-08-04T12:27:00.000Z	sanmarcos		why do I get 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded. when I do apt-get upgrade, as for example linux-image-server has an updated version, (dapper-security) and apt upgrade doesnt automatically show me that?
2006-08-04T12:29:00.000Z	DaveLibu	sanmarcos	  did you do  apt-get update    recently?
2006-08-04T12:29:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	obviously, else policy wouldnt show me the updates
2006-08-04T12:29:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	inetutils-inetd btw
2006-08-04T12:30:00.000Z	DaveLibu	sanmarcos	   ok  so i install  that   and that will get me a running inetd?
2006-08-04T12:31:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	I'd recommend xinetd
2006-08-04T12:31:00.000Z	DaveLibu	sanmarcos	  ok i will try xinetd
2006-08-04T12:32:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	help.ubuntu.com -> Servers
2006-08-04T12:33:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	inetd is netkit-inetd apparently
2006-08-04T12:42:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	xinetd is supposed to be "next-generation" but I am no expert, check /etc/inetd.conf
2006-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	DaveLibu	sanmarcos	  yes i saw that from apt-cache show   looked like  xinetd was the new things    but i had just installed talk and talkd   and they had set up  /etc/inetd for talk   so i played it safe
2006-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	unix philosophy :)
2006-08-04T12:47:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	try ping -b to your broadcast address
2006-08-04T12:48:00.000Z	DaveLibu	sanmarcos	 ok
2006-08-04T12:48:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	never tried talk, is it any good?
2006-08-04T12:48:00.000Z	DaveLibu	sanmarcos	  it is primitive    i just figured it is so simple it would be easy to set up
2006-08-04T12:49:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	like wall
2006-08-04T12:49:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	it does interrupt your work
2006-08-04T12:51:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	nice, I will try it, I like the concept
2006-08-04T12:51:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	yeah I used to do screen multisessions for that
2006-08-04T12:54:00.000Z	sanmarcos	DaveLibu	no not really, I mean to implement, it can be done easily
