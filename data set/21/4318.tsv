2008-11-23T12:43:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	ya maybe ur right.. i dont know.
2008-11-23T12:34:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	why is it secure?
2008-11-23T12:34:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	it doesn't nudge users into using programs like IE or Outlook by defualt
2008-11-23T12:38:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	at first the whole microsoft software development has changed, security is a big issue and programs like the IE and Outlook have truly evolved. At second, nowadays security issues and attack vectors mainly aim at browser plugins like flash, which is "in a way" system independant..
2008-11-23T12:38:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	not really saying windows is insecure either i just said linux was secure.  i think an xp sp2 install is not bad as long as you avoid IE
2008-11-23T12:40:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	but ya the browser plugins are a problem
2008-11-23T12:43:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	at this point i'd like to emphasize that i almost only run *nix-like systems and have to work with ms OSs a lot while not liking it, but following the latest security issues over the ongoing year i feel to have read more about linux holes than windows flaws. i dont like that impression and it may be incorrect, but thats what i feel
2008-11-23T12:45:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	unix seems to have so many more libraries and it's hard to tell .  but i know freebsd/openbsd are really really secure at laest
2008-11-23T12:45:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	i dunno anymore about some linux distros
2008-11-23T12:45:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	nothing is _really_ secure
2008-11-23T12:46:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	"Only two remote holes in the default install, in more than 10 years!"
2008-11-23T12:46:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	i like openBSD and its philosophy
2008-11-23T12:47:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	and the projects focus on code review and security. But still there have been 2 holes, and thats remote holes
2008-11-23T12:49:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	lol ya
2008-11-23T12:49:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	well cant be perfect, im just saying that's pretty good
2008-11-23T12:50:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	actually on first glance we were talking about linux
2008-11-23T12:51:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	ya
2008-11-23T12:51:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	i may agree linux is not necessarily more secure than windows.  it depends on the apps u run.  apache vs.. IIS..hmmm
2008-11-23T12:52:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	we will continue in 20 mins
2008-11-23T12:52:00.000Z	tenX	xtknight	ttyl
2008-11-23T12:53:00.000Z	xtknight	tenX	okay
