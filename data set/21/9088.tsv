2005-11-28T15:39:00.000Z	Raskall		a small crisis here. I installed kubuntu with apt-get a few weeks ago just to see what the fuzz was about. Never liked it. But after yesterdays apt-get upgrade, my bootsplash is blue and says kubuntu instead of the lovely ubuntu logo.
2005-11-28T15:40:00.000Z	Raskall		how do I fix this? (want to keep kde-things because I often find kde-apps I like)
2005-11-28T15:40:00.000Z	Raskall		didn't help getting rid of the kubuntu-desktop package
2005-11-28T15:40:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	 you can change the splash screen :) lemme find the link...
2005-11-28T15:41:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	:) I know I can change it. But I can never seem to learn how to use initrd-commands
2005-11-28T15:43:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	i use a program actually.  Gnome SPash Screen Pref... located under system->preferences->spash screen
2005-11-28T15:44:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	ahh.. I could disable the splash screen altogether. :) lovely.
2005-11-28T15:44:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	I really don't like bootsplash, you see.
2005-11-28T15:46:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	but that app, is it just to insert a jpg (or whatever)?
2005-11-28T15:46:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	http://www.gnome-look.org/ has some really good screens. but if you really dont like them, thats ok too. hmm i wonder if it speeds anything up not having them?
2005-11-28T15:46:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	I would love to have a picture of my daugher as bootsplash
2005-11-28T15:47:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	it can be done
2005-11-28T15:47:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	the app accepted it and activated it.. I'll try..
2005-11-28T15:52:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	you misunderstood. That app was to control the login splash in gnome. I want to change the bootsplash, the graphic show when the computer is booting (before you can log in)
2005-11-28T15:53:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	you mean where you select OS? Grub Screen?
2005-11-28T15:53:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	between that and gdm login, yes. :) Where you see services get started.
2005-11-28T15:54:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	i'll look into it now. I definetly want to change that too.
2005-11-28T15:58:00.000Z	ookami	Raskall	seems that screen is called usplash ? ....
2005-11-28T16:05:00.000Z	Raskall	ookami	seems like that, yes. But how to change it? I suspect we have to make a new initrd-image for the kernel
