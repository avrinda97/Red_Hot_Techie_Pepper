2010-12-18T04:05:00.000Z	kcorcoran		is it safe to assume ubuntu v10.10 32bit can only take advantage of 3GB RAM?
2010-12-18T04:06:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	no , either kernel or pae are capable of more
2010-12-18T04:07:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	server-kernel or pae
2010-12-18T04:09:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	that was no question, but an answer, either pae or serverkernel can do that
2010-12-18T04:09:00.000Z	kcorcoran	DasEi	 sorry, i don't understand who I would configure PAE
2010-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	you mean how, see link ubott.. gave or simply install server-kernel , reboot (and choose)
2010-12-18T04:13:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	4 PB, good enough for pacman

2010-12-18T04:16:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	I guess it's a 64 bit cpu, go witht 64 bit then, how many cores ?
2010-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	kcorcoran	DasEi	dual core
2010-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	DasEi	kcorcoran	I'd use 64 bit
