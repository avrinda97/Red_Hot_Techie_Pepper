2008-09-26T04:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	30th Oct
2008-09-26T04:40:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	is there a countdown thing for this release ?
2009-01-17T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	you can sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and add whatever you wish, or uncomment what's already in there
2009-01-22T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	installing it on the same machine as what?
2009-01-22T17:38:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	what do you mean ?
2009-01-22T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	you can't just say same machine/hard drive without saying what it is on the same drive as
2009-01-22T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	its like saying "my beer is the same"
2009-01-22T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	"same as what" is the next question, the statement is missing a piece of information
2009-01-22T17:39:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	it's on the same drive as another ubuntu install... going to install this one so i can extract some files as a replacement.
2009-01-22T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	if its another *buntu theres no real advantage in having 2 installs unless its to play, what *buntu are you installing?
2009-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	if you want to see your mount points where your current system is mounting you can read /etc/fstab. If you want to have a clean install of the other *buntu you will need another partition to install / to but can use the same partition as the standing install for /swap
2009-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	they're both Ubuntu 8.10. i messed with some /etc files and it's locked into a Read only system... i am goinng to install this one to extract those files and use them as a replacement.
2009-01-22T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	you could use: 'sudo chmod -R 755 /' which will make them full access for owner (root) and read/executable for everyone else in the world
2009-01-22T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	if you want to copy over the files, you could create a new partition after resizing what you have and install to that and copy over, Im not sure thats a great soloution but thats how I'd do it
2009-01-22T17:45:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	i've already an empty partition for this install. will using / as the moint point affect my other install ?
2009-01-22T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	yes as thats the mount point for the running install, you'd have 2 installs and the new partitions will be mounted as / in that boot
2009-01-22T17:48:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	how can i install 2 ubuntus on the same hard drive(different partitions) ? could i use // as a mount point for / ?
2009-01-22T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	its essentailly a dual boot
2009-01-22T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stargazer	thats why you should reboot to recovery -> root console and unmount / fsck there
2009-01-22T18:18:00.000Z	Stargazer	ActionParsnip	gordonjcp: it says / is clean. gives me number of files and blocks too.
