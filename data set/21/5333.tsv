2008-07-11T17:24:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	sudo lshw
2008-07-11T17:25:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	it might, and even suggests that you run it with sudo
2008-07-11T17:27:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	it pulls a lot of information from /proc and /sys that your user might not have access to.
2008-07-11T18:04:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	Not in this channel though.
2008-07-11T18:05:00.000Z	holyguyver	Pici	of course not, but I can lead him to the right channel on the right server :-p
2008-07-11T18:06:00.000Z	holyguyver	Pici	if someone would prefer a different distro I see no problem in recamending one that they might like more.
2008-07-11T18:18:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	Please don't play with the bot here, query it in a private message or in #ubuntu-bots
2008-07-11T18:18:00.000Z	holyguyver	Pici	but I like cammiting bot abuse :p
2008-07-11T18:20:00.000Z	holyguyver	Pici	have you never commited bot abuse just for kicks?
2008-07-11T18:20:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	No, I have a permanent ubottu query window for that
2008-07-11T18:21:00.000Z	holyguyver	Pici	when will ubotu be back?
2008-07-11T18:22:00.000Z	Pici	holyguyver	I dont have a timeline on that, but the bots are running the same code.
2008-07-11T18:22:00.000Z	holyguyver	Pici	, I know but it is just not the same, it is like when Rose had to choose between The Doctor & the clone hand Doctor.
