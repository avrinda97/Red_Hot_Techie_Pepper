2007-12-19T12:19:00.000Z	lucian_		if i install an application with aptitude, and then remove that application wtih apptitude will it ALSO remove all the dependencies that it installed for that single application?
2007-12-19T12:20:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	that is aptitude's strength, although with apt-get auto-remove apt-get is getting closer
2007-12-19T12:21:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	thanks... im installing a one-time use and i dont want all its dependencies remaining installed
2007-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	right click the icon on the desktop, select properties, and on the last tab, click the triangle next to settings. Change the mount point (just the last word, replacing MAX HD)
2007-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	thank you :)
2007-12-26T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	you didn't do  /media/<name> did you
2007-12-26T11:37:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	yea... the mount point was blank
2007-12-26T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	  in a terminal, type:  gconftool --recursive-unset  /system/storage/volumes
2007-12-26T11:41:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	rock on.. thanks a mill.
2007-12-26T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	so repeat and just change the last word , replaceing MAX HD :)
2007-12-26T11:46:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	this is gonna sound odd.. i did what you said, i think it worked but... when i right click the icon and goto the volume label it says the mount point is /media/EHDD now.. but when I navigate to the /media directory.. there isn't an EHDD directory there. However, clicking on the desktop icon brings it up.
2007-12-26T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	that is odd. is there anything in the media directory?
2007-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	is this an ntfs disk?
2007-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	under the volume tab, its showing the same mount options/parameters as it did before, just no folder
2007-12-26T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	by folder, do you mean mount point
2007-12-26T11:50:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	yes, sorry. left over windows vocab
2007-12-26T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	that is very strange, I have directories that appear and disappear in /media with the names I set there
2007-12-26T11:51:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	im going to try and unmount it again and restart the automount... hopefully it's just a glitch
2007-12-26T11:52:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	thats odd... sudo umount /media/EHDD/ worked... this might be a nautilus issue...
2007-12-26T11:52:00.000Z	nickrud	lucian_	try ls /media
2007-12-26T11:54:00.000Z	lucian_	nickrud	its alright.. nautilus wasn't refreshing or something
