2008-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	arbir	I've messed with it in the past, but don't have the right stuff installed right now to test again

2008-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	arbir	hope it's not a wasted trip
2008-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	that channel is like empty
2008-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	which is ur default file manager  ?
2008-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	arbir	nautilus in spacial mode
2008-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	whats that spacial mode ?
2008-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	i have been using thunar, the lightwreight manager, its less buggy somehow
2008-06-08T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	arbir	it's an aquired taste, it doesn't use a tree view, it uses separate windows for each directory; depending on how you click it leaves the original open or closes it, also the windows show up in the same place on the desktop each time it's opened
2008-06-08T08:59:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	dont think i have taste for that
2008-06-08T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	arbir	don't knock it till you've used it for a while, it's really nice once you've set it up the way you work
2008-06-08T09:01:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	have u tried thunar ?
2008-06-08T09:02:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	also, which music player do you use as default ?
2008-06-08T09:02:00.000Z	nickrud	arbir	used it for a while on a weak computer, but not much. And that first rate software, amarok ;)
2008-06-08T09:03:00.000Z	arbir	nickrud	yell0w,.. also the fonts are small, and i dont have qtconfig for qt3, unless there is an amarok based on qt4
