2011-09-12T04:56:00.000Z	mamece2		can someone explain me the third step? 2) Go into the /etc/X11 folder and rename the xorg.conf to some other file such as xorg.conf.jimbo.backup. Copy the xorg.conf.failsafe to xorg.conf.
2011-09-12T04:56:00.000Z	mamece2		3) Issue the two commands above about initramfs and the framebuffer.
2011-09-12T04:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 you aer just moving a file to a new name. and keeping the old under a differnt name
2011-09-12T05:00:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	i mean the 3th step, issue the two commands above about initramsd and the freambuffer
2011-09-12T05:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 no idea what you are doing or how those apply,
2011-09-12T05:03:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	i have a disconnected plymouth error
2011-09-12T05:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 personally - i just disable plymouth normally. I find it adds pointless problems for little gain.
2011-09-12T05:04:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	have you heard about it_
2011-09-12T05:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 at the grub menu, you could hit 'e' to edit the lines and replace 'quiet splash' with text, and get to  the console that way normally.
2011-11-27T20:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 i dont see the logic in that statement..
2011-11-27T20:51:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	like my problem its got no logic
2011-11-27T20:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 put it on the forums. or askubuntu.com
2011-11-27T20:53:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	theres a LOT of threads about boot error problem, no body has an answer. i have 2 days searching in forums, and 1 in iRC chats
2011-12-04T23:02:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	its a 94' trident
2011-12-04T23:02:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	theres no xorg.conf anymore in lubuntu 11.10 so i cant use my old video card, xorg -configure doesnt work neither
2011-12-04T23:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 x auto configures.. if you have an old xorg.conf you could try it.
2011-12-04T23:03:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	i dont, i even made a xorg.conf from scratch
2011-12-04T23:04:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	i think X doesnt get the xorg.conf from /etc/X11/
2011-12-04T23:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 it does. every nvidia system i got has one in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-12-04T23:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	mamece2	 they are just a few lines in my case. for my twinview settings.
2011-12-04T23:05:00.000Z	mamece2	dr_willis	 mines just a trident TGUI9440 rev 3
