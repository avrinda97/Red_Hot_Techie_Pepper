2006-05-16T12:49:00.000Z	pingveno		I'm trying to get a dual head, extended desktop arrangement for the VGA port on my ThinkPad T43, but I'm having problems finding good advice around the Web on setting it up.
2006-05-16T12:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	well hey :) I am on a Thinkpad T43. How can I help?
2006-05-16T12:50:00.000Z	pingveno	fyrestrtr	have you done anything with the external monitor?
2006-05-16T12:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	yes, it works great.
2006-05-16T12:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	even when docked :)
2006-05-16T12:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	no, not extended. I use it as mirror in my setup. But extended is possible.
2006-05-16T12:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	are you using binary drivers?
2006-05-16T12:57:00.000Z	pingveno	fyrestrtr	how would I find out if I have the binary drivers or not?

2006-05-16T12:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	you need to manually install them, if you didn't then you don't have them :)
2006-05-16T12:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	the binary drivers from ATI have support for dual monitors in their control panel application.
2006-05-16T12:59:00.000Z	pingveno	fyrestrtr	ah, I see
2006-05-16T13:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI (read the Using drivers from ati.com section).
2006-05-16T13:01:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	the default drivers (the non ati.com ones) have a famous bug with suspend/resume support. In that it will corrupt your display when you resume.
2006-05-16T13:01:00.000Z	pingveno	fyrestrtr	interesting... I haven't had any problems with either
2006-05-16T13:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	are you sure you are using binary drivers?
2006-05-16T13:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	I had mixed success with WoW. Because my card only has 32 MB RAM, I couldn't play it on full screen resolution -- had to use Windowed mode. Also had to use the directx, not opengl -- opengl caused all sorts of artifacts that I had to install patches for. It was a big PITA. nVidia's binary drivers don't have such issues.
2006-05-16T13:05:00.000Z	pingveno	fyrestrtr	with WoW? impressive
2006-05-16T13:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	I used the guide at winehq.
2006-05-16T13:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	I got lucky. I got a Dell Inspirion, 2 Ghz/ 2 GB / 100 GB -- and use that to play WoW :D
2006-05-16T13:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pingveno	WoW keeps teasing me with that nVidia -- the way its meant to be played logo on the graphics option screen. As if I didn't know I should have gotten an nvidia card.
