2006-09-05T15:05:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Is there any way to apply the ubuntu patches to a vanilla kernel?
2006-09-05T15:07:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Lo.
2006-09-05T15:08:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Easy Ubuntu
2006-09-05T15:08:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Automatix is dangerous. Well it can be
2006-09-05T15:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	so can gparted
2006-09-05T15:09:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	gnomefreak	What exactly does gparted have to do with Easy ubuntu/Automatix.
2006-09-05T15:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	you said automatix is dangerous
2006-09-05T15:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	so is gparted
2006-09-05T15:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	have you looked at the source lately?
2006-09-05T15:10:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	gnomefreak	So can skiing down a mountain backwards nakid, but that never came into the convo, So why gparted?
2006-09-05T15:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	automatix isnt any more dangerous than gparted
2006-09-05T15:11:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	gnomefreak	no but when theres a safer option, why not use it. Personally i dont use either but if someone wants to...
2006-09-05T15:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	i dont use either myself but automatix code has changed alot the only one we support in this channel is do it yourself. but false info is not a good thing. definitly on a subject so flamable hence why the factoid for it changed
2006-09-05T15:15:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	gnomefreak	False info? I dont use either so im not qualified to comment really as i said, but im just passing on info that has been on varius forums/mailing lists plenty of times.
2006-09-05T15:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	automatix is as unsafe as using a 3rd party repo
2006-09-05T15:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	it backs up anything it over writes you cant figure out how to use the backups thats not automatix fault
2006-10-04T16:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	what is your question
2006-10-04T16:54:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	gnomefreak	no worries, its sorted
2006-10-04T16:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	ok
2006-10-08T16:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Crippy-Boy	we only _need_ to say it once
2006-10-08T16:54:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	gnomefreak	I was being sarcastic because of the above, about 6 people said it twice :-)
