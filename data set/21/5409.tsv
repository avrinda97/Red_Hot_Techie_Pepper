2007-11-23T02:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	Sure, I'll try tackling it with you
2007-11-23T02:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	First thing I'd like to know is weather installing the bluebuntu-look theme get's rid of the brown, if it does we can just look at the theme
2007-11-23T02:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	( I can't do this because the switch is so fast for me I don't see the intermediate brown )
2007-11-23T03:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	Ahh, so you know the cause, I didn't realize you were that far yet :)
2007-11-23T03:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	Ok... I'll try switching some themes.
2007-11-23T03:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	Meanwhile, check this out... http://gnomesupport.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2366
2007-11-23T03:05:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	No... changing GDM greeter does not change the brown background that is drawn between succesful login and the desktop background set by the user.
2007-11-23T03:06:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	Neither does setting the background colour in the greeter, using simple greeter with colour only, etc. Quite simply, there is no gui way to change the background.
2007-11-23T03:06:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	I can follow this advice here to manually change the background colour... but as I said I'm looking for a more elegant fix to this apparent bug.
2007-11-23T03:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	What about changing the color of the solid background image ( it may display that before the actual background )

2007-11-23T03:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	If desktop is set to colour black, and greeter background is set to colour black, a brown desktop will be drawn between those two points.
2007-11-23T03:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	Just to be thourough try enabling the entire bluebuntu theme ( go into System -> Preferences -> Appearance and any tab that has an option for bluebuntu, choose it )
2007-11-23T03:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	I remember on an old machine ( with Edgy a while ago ) that I saw an intermediate blue, and I was using all bluebuntu at the time
2007-11-23T03:14:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	No... trying all the different ones was one of the first things i tried before filing a bug report. As I said I can edit the presession defaults to force a colour. I've posted it here. http://pastebin.com/m76a12285  What you'll notice if you read through, is that it tries to capture the background colour at least two times, only if every attempt to obtain the system themes backgroun colour fails does it then set a defaul
2007-11-23T03:15:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	I wonder... could it be as simple as a path change... maybe the path to the theme that the presession is looking for has changed?
2007-11-23T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	ArthurArchnix	I have confirmed the bug at least
2007-11-23T03:28:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	Think I've got it.
2007-11-23T03:58:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	So... here's the real bug report. A fix is apparently in the works. Temporary workaround is to set default to 'x'.

2007-11-23T03:59:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Jordan_U_	Just thought I'd let you know.
