2011-07-03T03:08:00.000Z	ka_		westz- Whenever I boot my computer my wireless is off and I need to enter the command sudo modprobe b43 and it turns on.  but every so often I lose the connection and II can't reconnect (the wireless card is still working but it won't connect to my network)
2011-07-03T03:09:00.000Z	ka_		westz- so I would like to get the wireless to be automatically on whenever I start ubuntu and also to stop disconnecting
2011-07-03T03:09:00.000Z	ka_		I'm not sure... I don't really know how to check
2011-07-03T03:09:00.000Z	ka_		westz_ I'm not sure what that is.  I've had windows all my life, I really new to linux
2011-07-03T03:11:00.000Z	ka_		westz_ thanks, I'll google it.
2011-07-03T03:12:00.000Z	ka_		i'll have a look and maybe see if someone here has seen this problem before
2011-07-03T03:13:00.000Z	ka_		westz_yeah Iknow.. I do already have it installed
2011-07-03T03:13:00.000Z	ka_		westz_ I do
2011-07-03T03:14:00.000Z	ka_		westz_ I think
2011-07-03T03:14:00.000Z	ka_		no an old xps
2011-07-03T03:14:00.000Z	mneptok	ka_	laptop?
2011-07-03T03:15:00.000Z	ka_		yeah
2011-07-03T03:15:00.000Z	mneptok	ka_	does it have a mini-PCIe slot where the Broadcom is installed?
2011-07-03T03:15:00.000Z	ka_	mneptok	I 'm not sure...
2011-07-03T03:16:00.000Z	mneptok	ka_	are you using it now? if not, flip it over and look for a panel to remove and gain access to the PCIe slot.
2011-07-03T03:16:00.000Z	ka_		I have only tried it on my network
2011-07-03T03:16:00.000Z	ka_		I am using it now
2011-07-03T03:17:00.000Z	mneptok	ka_	path of least resistance is to just replace the Broadcom with an Intel card that has support in the mainline kernel
2011-07-03T03:17:00.000Z	ka_		09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM5906M Fast Ethernet PCI Express (rev 02) 0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11a/b/g (rev 01)
2011-07-03T03:17:00.000Z	ka_		I'd prefer not to invest in new hardware for this.  Its my old laptop that I just replaced the windows OS because it was seriously slow
2011-07-03T03:17:00.000Z	mneptok	ka_	my Dell Inspiron cam with a Broadcom. i replaced it immediately.
