2011-09-01T02:52:00.000Z	hylian		is there a non x version of ubuntu besides the server version and the minimal? I don't need all this stuff..
2011-09-01T02:53:00.000Z	qin	hylian	Any version, when boot with "text" flag.
2011-09-01T02:53:00.000Z	hylian	qin	ahh, and how do i use that flag?
2011-09-01T02:54:00.000Z	qin	hylian	boot, hold shift, in grub menu e (edit), replace "splash" with "text".
2011-09-01T02:55:00.000Z	hylian	qin	but i am not just trying to get out of x, i am trying to install without x, etc... trying to lighten the load...
2011-09-01T02:56:00.000Z	qin	hylian	minimal or server
2011-09-01T02:57:00.000Z	hylian	qin	in my first post, i asked for something other than server or minimal, so are you saying that's all there is?
2011-09-01T02:58:00.000Z	qin	hylian	Propably not. Just whanted to stress that you are free to use/remove X from your system.
2011-09-01T02:59:00.000Z	hylian	qin	thanks, i thought so. good to know...
2011-09-01T03:03:00.000Z	qin	hylian	apt-cacher is ok for it.
2011-09-01T03:03:00.000Z	hylian	qin	yeah, that would work too. I usually do things the hard way, LOL. :_
2011-09-01T03:11:00.000Z	qin	hylian	Still apt-cache works over http or ftp and can be used on any machine in lan, since most of updates are done at downtime anyway.
2011-09-01T03:11:00.000Z	hylian	qin	yeah, it's just that his internet is so very slow. i can handle it. thanks though.
2011-09-13T08:16:00.000Z	qin	hylian	xinit
2011-09-13T08:19:00.000Z	qin	hylian	from tty: xinit -- :1 vt8 will give you plain xserver, either you can stop gdm or boot into text.
2011-09-13T08:19:00.000Z	hylian	qin	so this would give me cli, but when i wanted, i could fire up firefox, for instance?
2011-09-13T08:20:00.000Z	qin	hylian	It will give you xterm on vt8, and you can run there whatever you want.
2011-09-13T08:22:00.000Z	hylian	qin	yeah, i've been able to do that already, i hate xterm with a passion. ok, thanks, thats what I thought.
2011-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	qin	hylian	it is just terminal of xserver, like tty, but white.
2011-09-13T08:24:00.000Z	hylian	qin	i know, but it always displays small for me, and i also would default it black for me. i was hoping there was a way to get something similar to ctrl alt f1, for instance, plus x11 capability. cli that can actually load images or videos, for intance.
2011-09-13T08:26:00.000Z	hylian	qin	i actually installed terminator and then built a custom xsession option for it. it works pretty well, but I was looking for something a little more, tty + x11. thanks anyhow.
