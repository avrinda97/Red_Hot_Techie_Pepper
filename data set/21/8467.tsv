2006-03-30T12:32:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		liable : , this is exactly what I have done
2006-03-30T12:32:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		I will tell you the whole story
2006-03-30T12:32:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		I come home
2006-03-30T12:32:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		on windows , there is net & lan
2006-03-30T12:33:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		I reboot to Linux
2006-03-30T12:33:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		there is net , again
2006-03-30T12:33:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		but when I reboot to win again
2006-03-30T12:33:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		liable : , ok .
2006-03-30T12:33:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		whatever you say .
2006-03-30T12:34:00.000Z	Dalamar_M		so , my point is that the time I rebooted from Lin To Win , there was authentication problems .

2006-03-30T12:34:00.000Z	Nabiki	Dalamar_M	Authentication problems, what kind?
2006-03-30T12:37:00.000Z	Nabiki	Dalamar_M	So you can only access the local network under Windows and the Internet under Linux?
2006-03-30T12:39:00.000Z	Dalamar_M	Nabiki	: , in Linux i seem to NOT connect to either , in Win I seem to have Lan (at least the local FTP server).
2006-03-30T12:39:00.000Z	Nabiki	Dalamar_M	What kind of network adapter are you using?
2006-03-30T12:41:00.000Z	Dalamar_M	Nabiki	: , I have two : One is onboard ,and the other is PCI. Both Realtek RTL319 ...
2006-03-30T12:42:00.000Z	Nabiki	Dalamar_M	Is your network configured with interfaces for at least one of the adapters?
2006-03-30T12:44:00.000Z	Dalamar_M	Nabiki	: , I cant get your point .
2006-03-30T12:44:00.000Z	Nabiki	Dalamar_M	 You need to make sure that linux knows how to access at least one of  the connections, and that you have that connection connected.
2006-03-30T12:45:00.000Z	Nabiki	Dalamar_M	  one is likely eth0 and the other eth1 or similar.
2006-03-30T12:45:00.000Z	Dalamar_M	Nabiki	: , yes , it's like that .
