2005-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	qjimbo		yeah it is but it's awful
2005-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	qjimbo		like having capslock enabled makes you type ! instead of 1
2005-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	qjimbo		on gaim
2005-12-01T13:58:00.000Z	qjimbo		XD
2005-12-01T14:00:00.000Z	qjimbo		oh yeah there's an odd thing I've noticed in ubuntu, in that when typing, I have a bad habit of enabling caps lock for even single letters,in ubuntu it seems a bit slower than windows at seeing when I've disabled capslock so I end up typing THe instead of The etc.
2005-12-01T14:00:00.000Z	qjimbo		I've adjusted to it now though, but it's a bit odd
2005-12-01T14:00:00.000Z	qjimbo		yeah it's a bad habit :p
2005-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	qjimbo		 but holding down keys on the keybaord never feels very natural
2005-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	qjimbo		I prefer to hit it ^^
2005-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	 Damn winex..
2005-12-01T13:14:00.000Z	qjimbo	it	that doesn't sound like a very secure way to go :p
2005-12-01T13:14:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	Do you think I don't have a secure password on it?
2005-12-01T13:14:00.000Z	qjimbo	it	doesn't matter
2005-12-01T13:14:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	 Matters to me. I like being root rather than typing sudo apt-get install build-essential every day.
2005-12-01T13:14:00.000Z	qjimbo	it	it means if a malicious program is run it can totally screw you over as opposite to only screwing over files your user can access
2005-12-01T13:15:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	 I'd rather just type su if I need to do something off of root.
2005-12-01T13:16:00.000Z	qjimbo	it	oh right, I thought you logging into gnome as root
2005-12-01T13:16:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	 I'm on gnome right now..as root.
2005-12-01T14:00:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	 some times that happens to me except when I press the shift key I hold it too long.
2005-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	it	qjimbo	 I just need to take my finger off sooner. lol
