2009-09-14T22:14:00.000Z	{g}		Hey People! I need a programm that shows every jpg in a folder and lets me either delete the current jpg and proceed to the next one or just proceed to the next one. Both with one keypress, so I can look through a lot of images fast. Would you guys write a bash script for that or use some existing app?
2009-09-14T22:15:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	I would write a script...
2009-09-14T22:17:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	how would you display the jpg?
2009-09-14T22:18:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	display from imagemagick or whatever, there's a bunch of options
2009-09-14T22:20:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	don't laugh, but you know what might do what you want: pornview
2009-09-14T22:21:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	hmm.. no, i dont want an app with that name :)
2009-09-14T22:21:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	sed s/pornview/gview/  in the source?
2009-09-14T22:24:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	trying some other viewers first...
2009-09-14T22:26:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	feh's man page claims to do this
2009-09-14T22:27:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	(and works) I just confirmed
2009-09-14T22:29:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	what is feh?
2009-09-14T22:30:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	ok, installing that one too. is there any downside of installing lots of apps?
2009-09-14T22:30:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	space on your hard drive
2009-09-14T22:30:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	hmm.. feh is purely command line?
2009-09-14T22:30:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	yeah
2009-09-14T22:31:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	well it shows you the image obviously and then has some keybindings
2009-09-14T22:31:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	ok, doing "man feh" now
2009-09-14T22:36:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	feh is best so far. all i am missing is that i can overwrite existing files with a rotated version. because often the images have to be rotated. would be nice to be able to do that in the same process as to sort out which one to delete.
2009-09-14T22:38:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	feh does this with <> :)
2009-09-14T23:39:00.000Z	{g}	jrib	yes, feh rotates but it doesnt let you overwrite the file afterwards.
2010-02-16T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	{g}	keep reading the page, you'll have to create it
