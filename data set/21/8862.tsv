2005-12-28T08:37:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	 just ask
2005-12-28T08:40:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	  did you try and look at your windows files before you started the partition program  you know looking around
2005-12-28T08:41:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	  do you have a window open showing your ntfs files
2005-12-28T08:46:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	 you cant resize a drive if its full
2005-12-28T08:47:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	 boot windows and find out how much free space your NTFS drive reports
2005-12-28T08:49:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	  is windows running right now  with the LiveCD in a window?
2005-12-28T09:58:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	 your paste pushed like 4 other peoples questions off the screen
2005-12-28T10:06:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	  found some google posts about your NTFS problem, they solved it by resizing with Knoppix-liveCD QtParted they said same thing Ubuntu CD wouldnt resize NTFS
2005-12-28T10:07:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	 this guys blog  read Dec15th  http://www.cs.ust.hk/~joseph/Blog/2005/11/ubuntu-on-ibm-thinkpad-t43-2668-hh5.html
2005-12-28T10:30:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	   id try the Knoppix qtparted    never hurts to have a knoppix cd laying around anyway
2005-12-28T16:06:00.000Z	pashaw	parti	  much better  :P
2005-12-28T16:07:00.000Z	parti	pashaw	& bunrning_B... I got a huge problem now....  I killed WIndows !!
