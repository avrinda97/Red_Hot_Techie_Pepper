2007-06-07T11:42:00.000Z	varka	sudo	why dont you try the drivers from the repository first nvidia-glx, nvidia-glx-legacy or nvidia-glx-new ?
2007-06-07T11:42:00.000Z	varka	sudo	what type of nvidia graphicsadapter do you own?

2007-06-07T11:45:00.000Z	varka	sudo	what type of nvidia graphicsadapter do you own?
2007-06-07T11:46:00.000Z	sudo	varka	1sec

2007-06-07T11:48:00.000Z	sudo	varka	yes
2007-06-07T11:49:00.000Z	varka	sudo	so my advice would be to uninstall the driver from the nvidia site and try nvidia-glx-new
2007-06-07T12:04:00.000Z	sudo	varka	: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
2007-06-07T12:15:00.000Z	sudo	varka	thank you. that envy fixed it all.

2007-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	varka	sudo	till the next kernel-update...
2007-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	varka	sudo	if you dont use the ones from the repository...yes
2007-06-07T12:19:00.000Z	sudo	varka	i can't seem to install the nvidia-glx for beryl
2007-06-07T12:23:00.000Z	varka	sudo	if you tried to install the drivers from the nvidia site before it could be difficult to install the ones from the repository as the installer often changes some links and configs which are differently needed for the driver from the repository
2007-06-07T13:51:00.000Z	sudo	varka	i get the following error when trying to install nvidia-glx
