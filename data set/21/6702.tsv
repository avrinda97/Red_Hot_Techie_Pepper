2007-02-18T11:56:00.000Z	Meltdown79		Guys, i have never compiled a program before, i downloaded a tar.bz2 file, unpacked it, did ./configure and then make... is that all? =) Lol... im a damn n00b
2007-02-18T11:56:00.000Z	Meltdown79		cry
2007-02-18T11:58:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	thats about it. i usually have /home/myusername/local directory so i do ./configure --prefix=/home/username/local;make;make install just to test it before actually installing to /usr/local/ or wherever
2007-02-18T11:58:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	thanx man
2007-02-18T11:59:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	just did make on wine, and it takes FOREVER... is does "make" take a long time? =) lol
2007-02-18T12:00:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	ubuntu usually has very new version of wine you shouldnt have to install. wine has an ubuntu repo too you can add to sources.list
2007-02-18T12:00:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	er shouldnt have to compile i mean
2007-02-18T12:01:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	i know.. hehe.. i got it in my sources.list and i did the apt-get install .. but wine just didnt work on my ubuntu 6.10... the newest version of wine at least.. so i thought i should try to compile it =)
2007-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	you often need to run winecfg and set a few things up.  its a gui tool
2007-02-18T12:03:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	yepp, i did run winecfg but i got this error when trying to save changes http://pastebin.ca/362243
2007-02-18T12:03:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	and when trying to install dreamweaver 8 i got this error http://pastebin.ca/362233
2007-02-18T12:05:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	well the first error can be fixed probably by doing: sudo chown -R ~/.wine   i dont know about the second
2007-02-18T12:05:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	er sudo chown -R Meltdown79 ~/.wine
2007-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	im no wine expert but i normally just wine installer.exe  from anywhere
2007-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	me too... hmm....
2007-02-18T12:13:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	is it configured for win2k or 98?
2007-02-18T12:14:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	i did winecfg and chose Windows XP and then pressed OK =)
2007-02-18T12:14:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	bah  rm -fr ~/.wine and rerun config maybe
2007-02-18T12:17:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	when removing .wine dir and doing winecfg it creats .wine dir..but i get this message "Failed to open the service control manager." any idea?
2007-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	dyrne	Meltdown79	might /j wine   i really dont have alot of experience with it other than basic stuff
2007-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	Meltdown79	dyrne	kk thanx man
