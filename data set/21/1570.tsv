2010-07-30T05:06:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	you use use an adhoc network
2010-07-30T05:07:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	well, i was able to get Server A on the network using Server B as an internet gateway, is that what you mean?
2010-07-30T05:08:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	if A can connect to B then it's already reachable
2010-07-30T05:09:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	thats what i thought - A and B can talk back and forward no problem. But C on my network cannot get to A
2010-07-30T05:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	there was no 'C' in your question, you can setup an wirless access point using hostapd + dnsmasq on one of them and get them all to connect to it
2010-07-30T05:11:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	ahh so Server B needs to be an access point
2010-07-30T05:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	it should be normally the one having access to the wired network
2010-07-30T05:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	the machine with the wired connection should access as a wireless access point, and all other machines connect to it
2010-07-30T05:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	how is A connected to B?
2010-07-30T05:15:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	does A have a wireless connection ?
2010-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	alright, can you setup an adhoc wirless network between B and C?
2010-07-30T05:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	well it's the simplest way, the other would be setting up B as a wireless access point using hostapd
2010-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	might sound dumb - but if i did get hostpad setup - do i need any special featuires on my other router in order to finish the setup (WDS?)
2010-07-30T05:22:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	not at all, just that the wireless card supports access point mode (AP mode)
2010-07-30T05:23:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	you can use open, wep or wpa/wap2 encryption without any extra software
2010-07-30T05:24:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	cool - ok i might try that - you reckon tough to setup? or straight forward? i'm reasonably ok with ubuntu
2010-07-30T05:25:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	not at all tough, hostapd.conf and dnsmasq.conf can be very minimal, but be sure to get the IPs right
2010-07-30T05:27:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	the machine thats the access point, would it still be able to get out onto the internet wirelessly through my router, as well as being an AP?
2010-07-30T05:27:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	yes
2010-07-30T05:27:00.000Z	KwikkSilva	ilovefairuz	cool thx :-) i'll give it a go!
2010-07-30T05:28:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	KwikkSilva	most drivers support creating more than wireless interface from the same physical interface
