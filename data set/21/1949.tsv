2010-03-04T17:24:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	Likely in your home folder or root directory
2010-03-04T17:30:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	Should already be isntalled.
2010-03-04T17:32:00.000Z	Guest85246	jimlovell777	how it should be installed
2010-03-04T17:33:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	Compiz is automatically installed. It's still there unless you manually removed it.
2010-03-04T17:33:00.000Z	Guest85246	jimlovell777	how i enabe it
2010-03-04T17:35:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects Tab
2010-03-04T17:36:00.000Z	Guest85246	jimlovell777	"combiz is not installed "
2010-03-04T18:04:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	sudo apt-get install screenlets
2010-03-04T18:06:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	sudo apt-get install screenlets
2010-03-04T18:07:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	I'm starring at it in synaptic right now, it's there.
2010-03-04T18:18:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	No disrespect intended, is english your first language?
2010-03-04T18:19:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	perhaps try an appropriate channel for your primary language so the help makes more sense to you.
2010-03-04T18:21:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	Depends on the problem. Compiz comes installed and screenlets is as easy as opening synaptic and marking it for installation
2010-03-04T18:24:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Guest85246	try ##ubuntu-eg
