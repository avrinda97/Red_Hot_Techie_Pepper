2006-05-15T15:11:00.000Z	vladuz976		does anybody know how to release a project under a software license like bsd or GPL ?
2006-05-15T15:11:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	if you use the GPL, it just needs a COPYING file, along with a notice in the app saying it's under the gpl
2006-05-15T15:12:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	and then just put it on freshmeat  or sourceforge?
2006-05-15T15:12:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	if you want, yeah
2006-05-15T15:12:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	if you want,i can check and see real quick if there's like a guide to using the gpl
2006-05-15T15:13:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	if you know where to look
2006-05-15T15:13:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	i'll look real quick here
2006-05-15T15:14:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	ok
2006-05-15T15:14:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-howto.html
2006-05-15T15:15:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	you know anything about BSD license, i have software written in lisp
2006-05-15T15:15:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	i'll see if there's a howto for the bsd license
2006-05-15T15:20:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	not finding anything
2006-05-15T15:20:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	me neither
2006-05-15T15:22:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	again, all you probably have to do is have a notice somewhere in the app or tarball that the code is under the BSD license, and a copy of said license
2006-05-15T15:22:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	probably
2006-05-15T15:23:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	thanks
2006-05-15T15:23:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	most apps have that info under the about menu :)
2006-05-15T15:25:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	for some reason most lisp project are released in BSD, dunno why
2006-05-15T15:25:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	lisp hackers are probably old bsd hackers too :)
2006-05-20T14:20:00.000Z	spikeb	vladuz976	yes
2006-05-20T14:21:00.000Z	vladuz976	spikeb	people at school say gimp sucks
