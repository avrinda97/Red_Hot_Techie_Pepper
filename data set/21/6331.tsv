2007-04-21T06:25:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	server?
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	it's not too hard, I can tell you how
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	I'm listening
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	it's going to be a quick lesson though as I need to go
2007-04-21T06:29:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	shot
2007-04-21T06:29:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	yup
2007-04-21T06:29:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	You have to download the server from the website
2007-04-21T06:29:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	extract it and run the script
2007-04-21T06:30:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	....I know, but I want to use feisty's vmware server modules
2007-04-21T06:30:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	when you run the config script, it'll probably have an error
2007-04-21T06:30:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	ok, keep going..
2007-04-21T06:30:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	isn't that what I'm explaining?
2007-04-21T06:30:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	lol
2007-04-21T06:31:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	if it has an error when you run the config, you'll probably have to download the vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
2007-04-21T06:32:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	ummm ok
2007-04-21T06:32:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	did that all make sense?
2007-04-21T06:32:00.000Z	underwatercow	jorge_	I used all defaults in the install and it worked fine
2007-04-21T06:32:00.000Z	jorge_	underwatercow	I was reading a forum post with that info too
