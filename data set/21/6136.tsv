2007-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	soundless		Hi could someone forward me to a channel where people MIGHT help me learning to program
2007-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	soundless		I don't know I'm a total noob I know the basics and I did some 'scripting in Second Life' but I just want to start to learn some programming doesn't matter which language
2007-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	soundless		visual basic on linux?
2007-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	soundless		which one is easier to learn?
2007-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	soundless		I do :P
2007-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	soundless		omg lol -.-
2007-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	soundless		anyway ty r00t I'll try PERL then ty ^_^
2007-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	You're on the verge of starting a religious war here, asking what language. I'm going to add fuel to the fire with my recommendation: Learn Python. Certainly far easy to learn than Perl, and it's certainly much easier to read and understand your programs if you come back and look at them a day later.
2007-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	and Python is more lightweight than Java. Quick, before anyone fills your head with confusing and conflicting advice :). Go look at the tutorial on http://docs.python.org/tut/
2007-05-27T06:43:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	I did look at it I did follow it but it doesn't really help... I mean I need to learn some build in functions cause I've found out that it's a lot easier to learn while trying.. just reading doesn't help... that's why I need support
2007-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	You mean you are trying to learn how to implement your own functions, or trying to learn what built-in functions Python offers?
2007-05-27T06:45:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	the built-in functions.. cause I know the basics..
2007-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	+ I could use some GUI help I really want to start building GUI's (tried glade with no suc6 0,0)
2007-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	Oh, by the way, here's a free book I found invaluable when I was learning Python (still do, for that matter): http://www.diveintopython.org/. Mark Pilgrim starts by posing some real world problems he faced, and shows how he solved them in Python.
2007-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	wow thnx I'll try the book ty ^_^
2007-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	Oh. I don't have much experience with GUIs myself. What little I do have, I learnt by tinkering with wxWindows, or wxPython. Let me see if I can find a link for you. I do know, though, that the SPE python editor comes with the wx packages, and all the documentation; I just can't remember if there were any examples.
2007-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	wxPython, I've read something about that but wasn't that for windows? (sorry if I'm wrong)
2007-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	Here's a fairly hefty demo using wxPython: http://pythonide.blogspot.com/. This also seems to be the home page for the editor. You can install the editor using ubuntu's package manager. Also check out this page for more info on SPE: http://www.serpia.org/spe
2007-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	ty again you're a really great help :)
2007-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	VenusianTreen	soundless	I've joined #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to ask any more questions.
2007-05-27T07:00:00.000Z	soundless	VenusianTreen	tyvm I'll try to read this stuff before I ask anymore questions
