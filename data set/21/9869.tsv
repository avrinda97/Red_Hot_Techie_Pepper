2005-12-28T09:34:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	do that in private, please.
2005-12-28T09:38:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	no, we don't have a dirty mind, you're too much of a geek...
2005-12-28T10:57:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	there is probably 10 ways. You can try samba(ubotu knows about samba) and you can use ftp, are two ways you can try.
2005-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	poningru	dabaR	well the thing is I cant setup anything on my windows computer
2005-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	set up samba on Ubuntu, or an sftp server on Ubuntu, and install a ftp client(perhaps filezilla) on the windows.
2005-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	do you have an ssh server installed on Ubuntu?
2005-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	poningru	dabaR	no
2005-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	you wont be able to connect to it from anywhere then.
2005-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	windows has a built in telnet client in the command prompt.
2005-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	poningru	dabaR	do I need to set up a telnet server on linux?
2005-12-28T11:02:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	you need to not set up one. It is not secure.
2005-12-28T11:02:00.000Z	poningru	dabaR	oh that will do then
2005-12-28T11:03:00.000Z	dabaR	poningru	Ubuntu does not come with a telnet server installed, mostly for reasons as above.
2005-12-28T11:04:00.000Z	poningru	dabaR	thanks dude
