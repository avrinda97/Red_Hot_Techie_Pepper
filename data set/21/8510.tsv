2006-12-13T13:43:00.000Z	drcode		is there cd  that I can download packges for easyubuntu?
2006-12-13T13:43:00.000Z	drcode		I use modem 33k
2006-12-13T13:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	do not use easyubuntu.
2006-12-13T13:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	for multimedia stuff, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2006-12-13T13:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	no.
2007-08-02T16:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	gmail can do that, just set it up from preferences.
2007-08-02T16:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	procmail can do that.
2007-08-02T16:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	you have to download it to forward it, how else can you do it?
2007-08-02T16:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	if you want to forward it from the server, then you need to set a rule on the server itself.
2007-08-02T16:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	no, it has nothing to do with imap or pop3
2007-08-02T16:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	forwarding requires access to the email envelope.
2007-08-02T16:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	only two computers have access to it, the server and the client. So, either you forward from the client (procmail) or you forward from the server.
2007-08-02T16:27:00.000Z	drcode	fyrestrtr	it will also download local the attacment or only the email envelope?
2007-08-02T16:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	you want to forward emails that are recieved on your machine? Example would be you are checking 5 accounts on your local machine, and you want to forward all email from one of those accounts to another email address.
2007-08-02T16:28:00.000Z	drcode	fyrestrtr	no
2007-08-02T16:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	then what do you want to do?
2007-08-02T16:28:00.000Z	drcode	fyrestrtr	 I want to forward mail that are on gmail account
2007-08-02T16:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	drcode	then logon to gmail, and in mail preferences, set the forward.
2007-08-02T16:34:00.000Z	drcode	fyrestrtr	?
