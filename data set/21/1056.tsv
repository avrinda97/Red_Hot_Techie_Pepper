2011-02-19T05:11:00.000Z	poss_		well restarting seemed to work
2011-02-19T05:12:00.000Z	poss_		and I found another work around too, apparently I have to make sure and press eject on each disc, otherwise ubuntu doesn't recognise there is a new disc in the drive
2011-02-19T05:12:00.000Z	poss_		thankyou again for your help fine people
2011-02-19T05:13:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Glad it worked out.
2011-02-19T10:55:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	"None of the hard drvies are showing up at all" what are you doing to try to get them to show?
2011-02-19T10:55:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Because you have to mount them first.
2011-02-19T10:56:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	You could try two things. One (the easier but less likely for it to "automagically" work) is go to Places->Computer and see if they're there.
2011-02-19T10:56:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Oh.
2011-02-19T10:56:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Have you tried doing it from the CLI?
2011-02-19T10:58:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	type in "sudo fdisk -l" to view all partitions.
2011-02-19T10:59:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Well just so we're clear, Ubuntu did not ruin the drives. Ubuntu is just not mounting them.
2011-02-19T10:59:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Did you burn it at the slowest speed?
2011-02-19T11:01:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	If you feel there may be an error with the CD you may wish to check it for errors. I will ubottu you in a moment.
2011-02-19T11:02:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Ah. Hmm. You could always forfeit the GUI. IT could just be a graphics card like somebodyearlier stated. To do so, just type in "CTRL+ALT+F1"
2011-02-19T11:04:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Awesome. Now just follow this guide: http://www.scottklarr.com/topic/133/how-to-mount-and-unmount-a-drive-in-linux/
2011-02-19T11:06:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Since that's a bit vague this goes into more well-explained detail if you wish: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/mounting.html (more plain english)
2011-02-19T11:11:00.000Z	poss_	Starminn	so fdisk shows the drives are there, but when i actually go to mount them it says they dont exist
2011-02-19T11:11:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	I've never had to mount a drive myself, so beyond the simple "howto" I'm not of much use. Perhaps others will chime in?
2011-02-19T11:18:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	By the way, to get your GUI back type in "CTRL+ALT+F7". F1->F6 are terminals.
2011-02-19T11:19:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	Lol. Same here first time I did it
2011-02-19T11:20:00.000Z	Starminn	poss_	What's the filesystem type? If Windows it's NTFS. If Linux it's probably ext<something>. To specify filesystem type while mounting you type in "mount -t <filesystem type> ......" with .... being the rest of the comman.
