2007-02-15T10:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	how about Linux for Things That Eat Human Souls? http://www.warbard.ca/temp/CthulhubuntuLogo.png
2007-02-15T10:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	are they good, technical bug reports, or "OMG Ubuntu is borken!!!!!11111oneoneone"?
2007-02-15T10:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	despite the name, a rage128 card only has about 32 or maybe 64Mb of RAM - it is not a modern card by any stretch...
2007-02-15T10:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	with a card that elderly, I'm not surprised
2007-02-15T10:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	so you've got hardware problems. How is this Ubuntu's fault?
2007-02-15T10:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	if another distro works better with your hardware, use it. File bugs with Ubuntu, and check back in a few months - april's release might solve some of your issues...
2007-02-15T10:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	installing ubuntu took about 30min; installing ati drives another 5, done. (at least for me...)
2007-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	me? no, I run a much newer ATI card - 9600XT
2007-02-15T10:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	blazemonger	please stop using your Enter key as punctuation - you've been asked about that before...
