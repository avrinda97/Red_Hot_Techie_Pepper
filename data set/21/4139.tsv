2009-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder		Guys, quick question. Do I need to be root for make install, i.e., ./configure && make && sudo make install?
2009-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	Only the make install stuff.  What are you installing?
2009-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Pidgin
2009-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	whats wrong with the one in the repos?
2009-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Too old. And I have lots of time on my hands to mess with things
2009-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	Whats too old about it?
2009-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Awesome. Thanks :)
2009-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	I am on hardy. And I believe it is 2.4.2 on hardy
2009-01-29T05:53:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	vim can read gzip just fine.  The issue would be the fact that it's got multiple files in it.
2009-01-29T05:54:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	hmm. Never knew that. Not much of a vim kinda guy :)
2009-05-16T01:17:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	sudo update-grub
2009-05-16T01:18:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Well, update-grub ran fine.... would it have symlinked the images properly?
2009-05-16T01:18:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	update-grub doesn't really deal with those symlinks.  The next time you install a new kernel image, it'll update those links.
2009-05-16T01:18:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	^^
2009-05-16T01:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Ah alright. And any reason why -11 was considered as no longer needed by apt? It is weird to see kernels being considered "no longer necessary" and automatically removed
2009-05-16T01:21:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	Well, I'm a bit curious as to why -11 was removed but not -7.  But, the autoremoval of old kernels is (apparently) something that was added recently.  It's to keep them from cluttering and taking up too much room.  I presume it has some rubrick of which were run successfully vs not.
2009-05-16T01:22:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Yeah, you are right. -7 is still installed on this PC, and -11 was recommended to be removed... interesting
2009-05-16T01:23:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	I'm not sure how it makes that decision.  It's an apt configuration thing as far as I'm aware.
2009-05-16T01:24:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Alrighty, Thanks a lot!
2009-05-16T01:48:00.000Z	Flannel	WebcamWonder	sudo updatedb?
2009-05-16T01:49:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Flannel	Ahh, didn't know it required sudo privileges. Thanks
