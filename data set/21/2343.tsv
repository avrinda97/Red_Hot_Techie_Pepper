2009-11-04T04:07:00.000Z	nukasl		has anyone heard of a clicking noise being a problem with 9.10?
2009-11-04T04:08:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	more info?
2009-11-04T04:08:00.000Z	nukasl		so, it's like a repeating clicking noise... kinda staticy. not hard drive, sounds like its coming from my laptop speakers inspite of others being plugged in  tc111 xt28
2009-11-04T04:09:00.000Z	nukasl	tc111	xt28 repeating, highly annoying. it may go away when i play music but then starts again when that stops.
2009-11-04T04:09:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	is your 'mic' muted?
2009-11-04T04:10:00.000Z	nukasl	tc111	how do i do that?
2009-11-04T04:10:00.000Z	nukasl	tc111	i just installed 9.10 about an hour ago... it was a problem present even during install. fwiw.
2009-11-04T04:11:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	click on speaker icon and choose 'volume control'
2009-11-04T04:11:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	desktop, notebook, netbook? sound card chipset?
2009-11-04T04:12:00.000Z	nukasl	tc111	notebook hp pavillion dv6000 amd turion 64 x2. don't know about my sound card...
2009-11-04T04:13:00.000Z	nukasl	tc111	muted mic turned sound themes off no luck.
2009-11-04T04:14:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	sound card chipset should be a crystal sound 4xxx, muting just the mic should disable other sounds... curious
2009-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	what does 'sudo lspci -vnn | grep audio -i' return from a console?
2009-11-04T04:17:00.000Z	nukasl	tc111	how do i copy text using xchat?
2009-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	nukasl		thanks, tried to right click
2009-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	tc111	nukasl	sorry, don't use xchat...
