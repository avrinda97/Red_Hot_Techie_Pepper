2009-12-06T01:03:00.000Z	rivoot		Bad luck, this morning just tried an usb wifi card and worked right out-of-the-box
2009-12-06T01:04:00.000Z	rivoot		Roasted did you get any error when the boot hangs ?
2009-12-06T01:04:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- I got a low resolution error one time, when I selected to boot into low graphics mode, it did nothing, sat at a black screen
2009-12-06T01:04:00.000Z	Roasted		dr_willis - yeah, its weird. Sometimes it asks for a login as if   I have ubuntu server installed - but I dont.
2009-12-06T01:05:00.000Z	Roasted		Im just gonna boot to a live cd and move my stuff to my server through the livecd gui.
2009-12-06T01:05:00.000Z	Roasted		why do you think gnome backfired tho? All I did was apt-get install ubuntu-desktop on kubuntu and now its giving me the finger.
2009-12-06T01:06:00.000Z	Roasted		dr_willis - yeah man, lemme try startx quick, if that fails Im nuking this thing. Its my spare rig anyway, no big deal, I use it for testing. Just sucks I did such a simple thing and gnome borked it all.
2009-12-06T01:06:00.000Z	Roasted		dr_willis - I had this system running with kubuntu for about 2 months now, no problems.
2009-12-06T01:07:00.000Z	rivoot		Roasted If it just starts with Comand line, try writing Init 5 and see what happens,
2009-12-06T01:07:00.000Z	Roasted		dr_willis - I instal ubuntu desktop, log out, select gnome, log in, and now the entire thing is FUBARd. I cant even get into kde.
2009-12-06T01:07:00.000Z	Roasted		dr_willis - I dont know what else I COULD blame. Stable system. Rock solid. Added Gnome. Crash. Pretty black and white. :(
2009-12-06T01:07:00.000Z	rivoot		the best you can do though, it's a clean new installation
2009-12-06T01:08:00.000Z	rivoot		Roasted I would recommend you just pick gnome or kde and stick with it x)
2009-12-06T01:09:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- but, theres official guides, ACTUAL guides, that say oh hey you can install gnome and kde and select it at the login screen.
2009-12-06T01:10:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- I t's not like I'm performing surgery on my OS. I'm doing soemthing that is posted to be a valid choice for people who want to tinker with KDE and Gnome.
2009-12-06T01:10:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- just sticking with one is something developers should be saying IF this isnt a good option to do, but theyre not, they seem to encourage it
2009-12-06T01:10:00.000Z	rivoot	Happehwalrus	I don't remember, some friend lent it me for a while
2009-12-06T01:11:00.000Z	rivoot		Roasted But when you do it, you get this kind of issues >.< , I'm not saying you can't, but I prefer having just one
2009-12-06T01:11:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- well, thats why I have ubuntu on a 20gb partitiona nd kubuntu on a 20gb partition, sharing the same home directory on my main rig.
2009-12-06T01:11:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- this is just my spare rig I was trying to tinker with.
2009-12-06T01:12:00.000Z	Roasted	rivoot	- simply becuase Im a long time gnome user who has been playing with kde and I cant decide which I like more.
