2007-09-13T06:50:00.000Z	Xaelgrim		I said before, but i get flooded out
2007-09-13T06:50:00.000Z	Xaelgrim		I was aksing for help with a sound issue
2007-09-13T06:50:00.000Z	Xaelgrim		I cant hear anything
2007-09-13T06:51:00.000Z	Xaelgrim		I tried the faq that was given to me but it is faulty
2007-09-13T06:51:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	what sound card
2007-09-13T06:54:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	you should be using the intel-HDA driver I think
2007-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	it's not supposed to be user friendly. It's a driver lol. This isn't something people usually deal with on a day to day basis
2007-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	I'll get you the URL, but as for compiling and configuring the drivers, well the FAQ is for that
2007-09-13T06:59:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	the faqs aren't always updated the moment something changes, you've got to be open to new things every now and then =P
2007-09-13T07:00:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-hda-intel
2007-09-13T07:00:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	note that it has to do with the kernel, i.e. anti-user friendly
2007-09-13T07:01:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	it's step by step though
2007-09-13T07:02:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	this is the URL to download the source code for the driver
2007-09-13T07:02:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-1.0.14.tar.bz2
2007-09-13T07:03:00.000Z	matthew_	Xaelgrim	unarchive it and compile it. There's plenty of wiki pages and howTOs on doing that
