2009-08-26T12:45:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	  sudo aptitude install build-essential
2009-08-26T13:08:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	in terminal  sudo updatedb  then when that finishes  locate iostream   anything found?
2009-08-26T13:14:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	sudo updatedb only updates the database you wont get anything   locate iostream is the one that tells where iostream is
2009-08-26T13:17:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	line in program  should be     #include <iostream>  not     #include <iostream.h>
2009-08-26T13:19:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	can you paste your cpp program?

2009-08-26T13:32:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	you installed  build-essential?
2009-08-26T13:35:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	you installed  build-essential?
2009-08-26T13:36:00.000Z	legend2440	juicy	 in terminal try    g++ <filename>.cpp? it should give program called  a.out or similar  if it compiles
