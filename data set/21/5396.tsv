2007-12-01T04:50:00.000Z	riddareralf		Hey all, I need a good ftp client, recently I've used gFTP but I don't really like it so much and it's not that stable
2007-12-01T04:50:00.000Z	riddareralf		What do you use?
2007-12-01T04:50:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	ftp
2007-12-01T04:51:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	How about using FTP at the command line?
2007-12-01T04:51:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	It's quick and easy.
2007-12-01T04:51:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	Well I'm not sure
2007-12-01T04:51:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	I rather use a GUI one to start with, it's easier when I work
2007-12-01T04:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	Or, you can use the built-in "Connect to Server..." that lets you access FTP shares as part of the Gnome virtual file system.
2007-12-01T04:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	Places -> Connect to Server...
2007-12-01T04:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	choose Public FTP, put in your login, and it should come right up.
2007-12-01T04:53:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	My point is that, while I'm sure you can find some neat FTP programs out there, Ubuntu has a lot of FTP functionality built in.
2007-12-01T04:53:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	I understand, I'll try that out, right away
2007-12-01T04:57:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	They ask me for a keyring?
2007-12-01T04:58:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	If it says to give a default password for a keyring, then just put in something memorable.
2007-12-01T05:00:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	Why should I use public ftp? Then it only tries to connect anonymously, so I couldn't enter my usr and pwd
2007-12-01T05:01:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	If you don't want to connect publicly, use the FTP (with login) option.
2007-12-01T05:01:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	I CAN'T connect publicly. But with this virtual drive I can't open a file on the fly and edit
2007-12-01T05:01:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	But I suppose that's normal since it's still FTP
2007-12-01T05:02:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	Some programs, ones that have built-in support for Gnome VFS, will be able to edit "on the fly" as you say, without having to download, edit, and upload.
2007-12-01T05:03:00.000Z	PirateHead	riddareralf	Other programs don't have that support, but you might be able to find it in a plugin or patch if it's important to your workflow.
2007-12-01T05:03:00.000Z	riddareralf	PirateHead	Ah okay, thanks
