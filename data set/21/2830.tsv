2009-07-29T02:48:00.000Z	SuperMiguel		does ubuntu support ntfs out of the box?
2009-07-29T02:49:00.000Z	SuperMiguel		whats the best way to copy "everything" from a ext3 drive to an ntfs drive??
2009-07-29T02:49:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	The dd command :)
2009-08-08T20:32:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	All programs run in ram?
2009-08-08T20:33:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	ummm i meant only in ram xD
2010-08-20T05:28:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	It'd be a very close call.
2010-08-20T05:29:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	If you want max speed from linux try arch or gentoo.
2010-08-20T05:30:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	i hate gentoo
2010-08-20T05:30:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	arch faster than ubuntu/debian?
2010-08-20T05:31:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	yeah.  Arch is really fast because you're only running the things you installed and therefore the things you actually use.  Nothing extra.
2010-08-20T05:37:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	Are you here?
2010-08-20T05:37:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	Yes sir
2010-08-20T05:38:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	l-ubuntu or x-ubuntu is not more lightweight for any reason other than what software they're running.  x-ubuntu uses xfce instead of gnome so it is lighter and thus faster.  Ubuntu becomes x-buntu simply by installing and running xfce.
2010-08-20T05:39:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	If you want your system to be fast and lightweight than it doesn't matter what distro you start with nearly as much as what software you run on that computer.
2010-08-20T05:39:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	Does this make sense?
2010-08-20T05:40:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	yup
2010-08-20T05:44:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	is openbox as lights as it gets before console?
2010-08-20T05:44:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	"before console? "??
2010-08-20T05:46:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	edbian	u know what i meant
2010-08-20T05:47:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	openbox is very light.  I don't know if there is anything lighter. There are a lot of window managers.  Nothing is lighter than the console alone.
2010-11-06T02:25:00.000Z	edbian	SuperMiguel	yes.  fluxbox uses much less
