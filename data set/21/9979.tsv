2006-03-23T12:47:00.000Z	giggsey		I have a TV Card which uses the bt878 thing, and I've installer tvtime, yet no matter where I have the arial/direction, tvtime keeps with the no signal - UK
2006-03-23T12:48:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	oooh, tv cards are fun
2006-03-23T12:49:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	card modules set up correctly?  Getting the "tuner" module right is especially tricky.  In my experience, the autodetect is unreliable
2006-03-23T12:49:00.000Z	giggsey	Managu	I have no idea :P - how can I tell :D
2006-03-23T12:50:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	well, errm, at the risk of looking ignorant, trial and error worked for me.  There's documentation somewhere, lemme see if I can find it
2006-03-23T12:51:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	if you rebooted recently, in /var/log/messages, or in maybe even in "dmesg", there should be a line containing "kernel: bttv0: using tuner=xx", or something the like
2006-03-23T12:52:00.000Z	giggsey	Managu	last reboot was last Sunday when I installed
2006-03-23T12:52:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	familiar with linux (or UN*Xs in general?)
2006-03-23T12:53:00.000Z	giggsey	Managu	I know a fair amount - installed gentoo numerous times successfully etc.
2006-03-23T12:53:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	mmkay.  Any lines like what I have above in your dmesg buffer, or in your system log?
2006-03-23T12:54:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	be sure to use pastebin or the like for anything more than 1 line, or 'ware the wrath of ubotu
2006-03-23T12:56:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	looks like the bttv initialization has scrolled out of the main log.  How bout trying "zgrep bttv /var/log/messages*"
2006-03-23T12:59:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	did it get your card right?  i.e. Happauge WinTV?
2006-03-23T12:59:00.000Z	giggsey	Managu	yep
2006-03-23T13:01:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	assuming that you've told TVtime that you're tuning PAL (as opposed to NTSC), you might try some different tuners.  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/CARDLIST.tuner has a list of numbers
2006-03-23T13:02:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	I'd suggest rmmod'ing "bttv" and "tuner" and then "modprobe bttv tuner=#", where # is one of the pal tuners listed.  Then see if tvtime starts working
2006-03-23T13:05:00.000Z	giggsey	Managu	 /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/CARDLIST.tuner doesn't exist

2006-03-23T13:16:00.000Z	giggsey	Managu	Not sure about this, but the TV Channels in the UK are between 20 and 35, yet tvtime doesn't let me go below 39 (it jumps straight to 1 from there (going down))
2006-03-23T13:17:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	I'll admit I know nothing about PAL or UK television.  If changing the tuner doesn't help, it might be worth trying to use a simpler tv program to start.  Like xawtv
2006-03-23T13:25:00.000Z	Managu	giggsey	another thought, if your're still here: tvtime may have determined that the first few channels have nothing in them (e.g. because of a faulty tuner number, bad reception, whatever).  There's a channel tuning editor in there somewhere that you can override its decisions from
