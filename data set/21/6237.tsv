2008-01-19T09:14:00.000Z	demon_spork		how do I get fsck.vfat to correct errors and attempt recovery of bad sectors? It doens't seem to be doing anything, it just exits within like 3 seconds, something about a folder.
2008-01-19T09:16:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	if possible, it's much better to fix vfat from within winows
2008-01-19T09:17:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	not possible, windows borked a few weeks ago
2008-01-19T09:17:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	I assume you are running it as root (the fsck)?
2008-01-19T09:17:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	I got it to work and it did what I wanted
2008-01-19T09:18:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	ok.  :)
2008-01-19T09:19:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	no it didn't, it just claimed it did
2008-01-19T09:19:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	I mounted the drive and it was still broked
2008-01-19T09:19:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	ok.  there is a flag, -a, that says "automatically fix things"
2008-01-19T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	-r says interactive fix
2008-01-19T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	doc says that, without one of -a, -r, it checks but does not fix
2008-01-19T09:21:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	sweet, it was a corrupted directory and I thought I was going to lose the pictures in it, but they randomly showed up in the root of the partition after fsck.vfat got done with it
2008-01-19T09:21:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	that's normal, at least for vfat.
2008-01-19T09:22:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	or normal once the file system is borked in the first place.
2008-01-19T09:22:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	in windows when I have tried the same type of repairs all I get is a bunch of random files, each with code that doesn't mean anything in the order that it is currently assembled
2008-01-19T09:23:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	yes, vfat is not very repairable.
2008-01-19T09:23:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	in general it can't even figure out which pieces are from the same file
2008-01-19T09:25:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	just remember to not let your foot get near the power cable on USB hdds, because unless they are running ext3 or reiser, you are effed the moment you interrupt a big file transfer
2008-01-19T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	yes, that's why I always run only journaling file systems.  reiser has not been reliable for me, but ext3 is reasonably resiliant
2008-01-19T09:27:00.000Z	demon_spork	sethk	sadly though I have to use the hdd on windows computers so I can't put ext on it unless I want to install the IFS drivers on all of them
2008-01-19T09:28:00.000Z	sethk	demon_spork	yes, I know, fact of life.
