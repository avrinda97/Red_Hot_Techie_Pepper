2006-05-15T07:32:00.000Z	Ng		logout is for shells
2006-05-15T07:34:00.000Z	Ng		ctrl-alt-backspace is zapping X, not logging out
2006-05-15T07:34:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	Not in Dapper
2006-05-15T07:35:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	are you sure?
2006-05-15T07:35:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	I think so, I don't want to try it now either way
2006-05-15T07:35:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	the xorg.conf would need a "DontZap on" option and it doesn't have that
2006-05-15T07:36:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	so I say you're wrong ;)
2006-05-15T07:45:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	That's just in Dapper isn't it?
2006-05-15T07:45:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	it was in breezy too, just an earlier version
2006-05-15T07:56:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	Guybrush, so called because his filename in Deluxe Paint was guy.brush and they couldn't be bothered to think of a name
2006-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	ahh, Deluxe Paint. those were the days. I actually bought a copy of DP3 ;o
2006-06-13T15:52:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	you can download pretty much all MS updates without using windows update
2006-06-13T15:56:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	It is easy to get around most of their protections. For example, if you want some software from microsoft.com which needs you to complete a WGA (Windows Genuine Advantage) test, then either a) Run the "alternative" method, which works in WINE, or b) Search on Google and you will find the page which would come up after the check has completed
2006-06-29T05:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	Yes, i realise after seeing that last message
2006-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	Like Win XP SP2 :)
2006-07-21T15:26:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	installed manually? it's in the repositories
2006-07-21T15:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	I mean it is not installed by default
2006-07-21T15:27:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	ah :)
2006-07-21T15:50:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	in dapper we have /etc/rc.local for random root commands at startup, way easier than dumping a script in /etc/init.d and symlinking it to rc2.d
2006-07-21T15:51:00.000Z	Warbo	Ng	I thought I looked for an rc.local a while ago. What way does Fedora use, cos I tried that first
2006-08-10T10:46:00.000Z	Ng	Warbo	you can use fsck -y and it'll automagically answer yes to itself :)
