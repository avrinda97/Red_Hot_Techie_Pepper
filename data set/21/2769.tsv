2009-10-27T17:31:00.000Z	padi999		and I can't delete it
2009-10-27T17:31:00.000Z	padi999		it tells me: -- a  unknown option
2009-10-27T17:32:00.000Z	padi999		How can I delete a file, that is called -al ???????????????
2009-10-27T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	rm "-al"  maybe
2009-10-27T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	might need to escape the - instead
2009-10-27T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	rm \-al
2009-10-27T17:34:00.000Z	padi999	ActionParsnip	th0r: The questionmarks are part of the filename, your ideas give me the same output: invalid option -- 'a'
2009-10-27T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	do you have a gui file manager/
2009-10-27T17:35:00.000Z	padi999	ActionParsnip	also, yes, eg. konqueror
2009-10-27T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	i'm guessig its no good there
2009-10-27T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	nice one, good suggestion th0r
2011-09-06T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	shotwell maybe
2011-09-06T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	shotwell and f-spot allow metadata editing and renaming....
2011-09-06T15:05:00.000Z	padi999	ActionParsnip	ActionParsnip perfect
2011-09-06T15:06:00.000Z	padi999	ActionParsnip	Of course a lot of programs provide what I need but I need to have easy access to that. Not having to click through all  menues on every picture
2011-09-06T16:25:00.000Z	padi999	ActionParsnip	Is it possible to change Event/Date in Shotwell? I can't seem to get this working. Some images are stated to be from 2020 and some from 1945 ^^
2011-09-06T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	not sure man, I just use it as a viewer/storer possibly right clicking on an image and changing it.
2011-09-06T16:29:00.000Z	padi999	ActionParsnip	well, one can change the Event but there is no compilation to a valid date
2011-10-15T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	install xfce4 or lxde and you won't have to use Gnome / Unity. You can still use your gnome apps though
2011-10-15T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	padi999	click your username, it should be visible then
