2006-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	nicodein_		hi, does anyone running ubuntu-amd64 have problems with ugly fonts (in xmms menus and in vlc for example) ?
2006-01-11T12:00:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	the fonts in those apps are ugly in any linux version
2006-01-11T12:00:00.000Z	nicodein_	mwe	: I meant uglier ;)
2006-01-11T12:00:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	you can limit the pain with "switch" though, to choose a different gtk1 theme
2006-01-11T12:00:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	and font. it wont let you use ttf fonts though
2006-01-11T12:02:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	however I keep hearing about multimedia problems like stuff not working or only working half in ubuntu 64bit. I hear the recommendation is to use the 32 bit version for now
2006-01-11T12:03:00.000Z	nicodein_	mwe	: so my problems come from the fact it's the amd64 version ?
2006-01-11T12:03:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	I don't know about your font problem
2006-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	you can't get flash or the java plugin to work in 64 bit ubuntu either
2006-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	nicodein_	mwe	: yes I figured out that
2006-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	nicodein_		but it seems I'm lacking some fonts
2006-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	I can't find all the codecs you need for 64bit either
2006-01-11T12:05:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	maybe. I think you can use "switch" like I mentioned to choose a different font
2006-01-11T12:06:00.000Z	nicodein_	mwe	: ok I'm gonna try it, and if not successful I'll switch to the 32bits version of ubuntu
2006-01-11T12:06:00.000Z	nicodein_	mwe	: by the way, is that normal there's so few package updates on ubuntu64 ?
2006-01-11T12:06:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	I think you be better off with the 32bit version for now. btw switch is in the pacage "gtk-theme-switch"
2006-01-11T12:07:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	I think there are less, yes. however enable universe and multiverse
2006-01-11T12:07:00.000Z	nicodein_	mwe	: it's already done
2006-01-11T12:07:00.000Z	nicodein_		I think I'll switch back to the 32bits
2006-01-11T12:08:00.000Z	nicodein_		thanks for your help :)
2006-01-11T12:08:00.000Z	mwe	nicodein_	the 64bit version doesn't seem ready for desktops
