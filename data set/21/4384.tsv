2008-05-28T01:12:00.000Z	SATA		I want to create my own custom ubuntu by relpacing the kernel. What should i do to replace it?

2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	i did it?
2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	amenado		timholum-> but then you still have to activate your interface right after? <-- yes or no?
2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	and?
2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	But i replacing the kernel was problem
2008-05-28T01:15:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	did you go through the steps of remastering?
2008-05-28T01:15:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	yea
2008-05-28T01:15:00.000Z	amenado		SATA-> you created the iso?  you can mount it to verify the contents
2008-05-28T01:16:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	it just helped to add packages. replacing kernel ???
2008-05-28T01:16:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	you can too, but you have to learn how to compile the kernel and make the necessary linkage
2008-05-28T01:17:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	is Adding the package== make it install by default at installation time?
2008-05-28T01:17:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	I have compiled kernel.
2008-05-28T01:17:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	i already advised you, once you make the iso, you can mount it first and verify the contents.. check  whatever package you added is there
2008-05-28T01:20:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	thanx. One thing  more ,,, after adding a package (probably in extras) does it mean to auto install the package during the installation of dist from that iso?
2008-05-28T01:21:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	if you have not modified the debian installer inside that remastered sys..those packages will not be installed
2008-05-28T01:22:00.000Z	SATA		amendo, any hint to modify that?
2008-05-28T01:23:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	the remastering ubuntu should have covered that topic? if not, google for ubiquity and debian installer..depends on which cd you have modified..also you can look into debootstrap
2008-05-28T01:24:00.000Z	SATA	amenado	Thanx man,
2008-05-28T01:24:00.000Z	amenado	SATA	good luck
