2005-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	neighborlee		why was the decision made to leave OUT gcc as part of ubuntu install ? LOL
2005-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	neighborlee		I mean talk about embarrasing
2005-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	neighborlee		I write to forum about not being able to get this script working only to find gcc isn't even installeddddddddddd
2005-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	neighborlee		rant over
2005-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	neighborlee		minimalistic is good sometimes but gez louise..I think leaving OUT gcc is a big mistake
2005-02-07T15:28:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	no
2005-02-07T15:29:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	gcc is rarely needed by most desktop users
2005-02-07T15:29:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	yeah I do understand..but gez even redhat comes with it for petes sake LOL
2005-02-07T15:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	a noob to linux would be truly confused anyway
2005-02-07T15:33:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	I dont mind gcc not being here in light of 'ease of use' and all..maybe I should be a bit angrier at the 'script' designer that he didn't 'check' for availability OF gcc..
2005-02-07T15:34:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	I spent all night wondering WHY ( well half an hour at least) this wasn't compiling when I know it did before LOL..sigh..oh well least I know why not LOL
2005-02-07T15:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	if you were a desktop user and new to linux, would  you use gcc?
2005-02-07T15:36:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	def. not LOL
2005-02-07T15:38:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	I understand why its left out I just wish maybe a warning of some type maybe..cause I sat here wondering what the heck is wrong....installing it is SO dain easy too so...mabye a little warning somewhere as reminder for such uncommon times like programmings that dont check for gcc being installed in their scripts and for people like me that ( late at night) sadly didn't 'catch' thats what was wrong....either way it
2005-04-15T12:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	file a bug
2005-04-15T12:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	well before doing it I wanted to make sure I wasn't the ONLY one seeing it...and I posted on forum and got no reply so I thought I might be...
2005-04-15T12:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	are you seeing this type of behavior at all ?
2005-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	you are NOT the only one
2005-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	well I feel somewhat better anyway <G>
2005-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	kbrooks	neighborlee	ask ##linux or #gnome
2006-06-29T13:57:00.000Z	neighborlee	kbrooks	good news
