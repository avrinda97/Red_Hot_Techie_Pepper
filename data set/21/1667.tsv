2010-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	siddhion	liquidmeson	I see what you were refering to before. I never considered it a bug, just bad UI design.
2010-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/160311/+attachment/1635345/+files/light-themes_0.1.8_all.deb
2010-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	install that file and re select the theme, should fix it
2010-10-14T01:18:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	which ever works :p
2010-10-14T01:28:00.000Z	siddhion	liquidmeson	i have extracted the files nwo where do I place them?
2010-10-14T01:29:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	shouldn't need to extract the file
2010-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	open a terminal and type: sudo dpkg -i locationto.deb it should now be installed
2010-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	siddhion	liquidmeson	so were do I put the 'light-themes_0.1.8_all.deb'
2010-10-14T01:30:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	the .deb file is like an exe file in windows
2010-10-14T01:31:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	once it is installed you can delete the .deb file
2010-10-14T01:33:00.000Z	siddhion	liquidmeson	hmm looks like I have a dependency problem. i need gconf2 2.28.1-2 but I only have 2.28.1
2010-10-14T01:34:00.000Z	liquidmeson	siddhion	well i guess make sure maverik is uptodate
