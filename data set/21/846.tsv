2011-05-11T23:45:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot		I need to install a program like ''java virtual box''
2011-05-11T23:46:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot		I tried with virtual box ose but it doesn't works with my kernel :-(
2011-05-11T23:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	what is the problem you are having with virtualbox?
2011-05-11T23:48:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	when I start the machine, appears that:
2011-05-11T23:49:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	and have you done that?
2011-05-11T23:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	take the quotes out
2011-05-11T23:55:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	FATAL: Module vboxdrv not found.
2011-05-11T23:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	how did you install virtualbox? from the repos?
2011-05-11T23:56:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	from the soft center
2011-05-11T23:58:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	hmm, it should work. are the guest additions downloaded with it?
2011-05-11T23:59:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	yes. The guest additions are installed already
2011-05-12T00:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	hmm, that is unusual, hang on
2011-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	I think is a kernel compatibility issue
2011-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	sorry, not sure how to help you (if it was arch linux i know the command to recompile the modules but ubuntu installs things a little differently)
2011-05-12T00:02:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	another software like the virtual box?
2011-05-12T00:02:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	if that exists...
2011-05-12T00:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	unless you're comfortable with the commandline, you may want a frontend to qemu
2011-05-12T00:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	qemu is available in the 10.10 repos too
2011-05-12T00:05:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	i'll try it and back later with the news xD
2011-05-12T00:11:00.000Z	Not_A_Bot	ThinkT510	Installed and working!!! thanks!!!
2011-05-12T00:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Not_A_Bot	excellent
