2006-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- no i didn't should i?
2006-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	also, did you install the linux-restricted package as the docs indicate?
2006-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- I tried that guide, that's when I got the error i described
2006-12-06T06:44:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	you missed the part about linux-restricted, try again
2006-12-06T06:46:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- here we go
2006-12-06T06:49:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- the fglrx-module was disabled in linux-restricted-modules-common.. do I just remove it from the "DISABLED_MODULES" section and keep going with the guide?
2006-12-06T06:51:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	it's a bit counterintuitive, but you have to have this line there "DISABLED_MODULES="fglrx"
2006-12-06T06:53:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- any ideas?
2006-12-06T06:57:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	which is why it doesn't work
2006-12-06T06:58:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	are you using the ati binaries or the seveas repo?
2006-12-06T07:00:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- i don't know, how do I find that out?
2006-12-06T07:01:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	well the docs offer you various options, or are you using the ubuntu's fglrx driver from the repos?
2006-12-06T07:01:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- yup
2006-12-06T07:02:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	well update the restricted-modules & try again
2006-12-06T07:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	this is a very common problem - if you follow the doc properly, it works
2006-12-06T07:22:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- I tried going about it the way the guide suggests, but got the following error:
2006-12-06T07:23:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	you installed the linux-restricted module?
2006-12-06T07:23:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- it complains about finding fglrx
2006-12-06T07:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	cmt^^	of course
2006-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- ok let's see now
2006-12-06T07:28:00.000Z	cmt^^	frogzoo	- the system still finds fglrx device section
