2007-07-13T16:55:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude		*lol* I went into Sound Preference, next to Sound playback: it says "Autodetect" I hit the "Test" button and the Sound Preference panel crashed!
2007-07-13T16:56:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	sounds like problem
2007-07-13T16:56:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	what kind of sound chipset?
2007-07-13T16:56:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	Errr, CMEDIA I think(?) -- ASUS board, NVIDIA chipset
2007-07-13T16:57:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	did you check forums? the come in handy for specific hardware issues
2007-07-13T16:58:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	OK, I made progress. I switched one of the options to "USB Audio" and it blasted my ears with a loud tone
2007-07-13T16:58:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	you have usb audio?
2007-07-13T16:58:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	I don't think I do, but it was the only option that blasted me with a loud tone.
2007-07-13T16:59:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	does alsa load fine?
2007-07-13T16:59:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	how do i check? :P I am copying an MP3 off my iPod right now and gonna try to play it
2007-07-13T05:02:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	i would say restart the alsa daemon
2007-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	ok, double check everything is hooked up right, (humor me, check the plugs and all)
2007-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	A loud tone came out, so I assume that it is plugged in OK, and yes I checked the plugs again.
2007-07-13T05:04:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	ok, loud tones can come from power cables too, so u never know
2007-07-13T05:04:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	u did put it back to auto detect right?
2007-07-13T05:05:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	No, I left it on USB Audio
2007-07-13T05:05:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	I just need to find a sound now to test if real sound comes out or not :P
2007-07-13T05:05:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	you should have heard sounds @ startup unless you changed it
2007-07-13T05:06:00.000Z	robsomebody	Newbie_Dude	go to command line
2007-07-13T05:06:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	I have no idea why, but USB Audio worked, I put Beastie Boys - License to Ill in and I'm getting sound now.
2007-07-13T05:08:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	robsomebody	Strangely, in the volume control panel none of the volume sliders work except for the "Speaker 1" sliders.
