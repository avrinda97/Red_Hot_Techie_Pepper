2005-10-09T15:22:00.000Z	CzarAlex		Im a linux noob. Id like to update gaim from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0. I downloaded the source, unpackaged it, ran ./configure, make, make install, and then re-clicked on my bottom panal but when i go to Help > About, it still says 1.4.0. What did I do wrong?
2005-10-09T15:23:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	you are aware that gaim 1.5.0 is already in ubuntu breezy ?
2005-10-09T15:24:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	Im using horay
2005-10-09T15:24:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	its gonna be released in about a week... atleast using the official debs you get updates
2005-10-09T15:24:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	the way you're doing it now, you've cut yourself off from ubuntu support and upgrades
2005-10-09T15:25:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	I used synaptic and noticed that it said I already had 1.5.0 installed, but Help > About in gaim said otherwise. why is that?
2005-10-09T15:28:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	I have 1.5 installed in breezy and it works
2005-10-09T15:29:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	hepl says 1.5 correctly, you may have compiled gaim, but it seems you have not installed it correctly
2005-10-09T15:29:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	is the process to ./configure, make, make install?
2005-10-09T15:30:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	yes, but: sudo make install
2005-10-09T15:30:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	Oo! would that cause the issues im having?
2005-10-09T15:31:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	typically, yes
2005-10-09T15:31:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	okay thank you.
2005-10-09T15:33:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	you can upgrade right now if you like
2005-10-09T15:33:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	Shoudldnt i wait for the official release the 13th?
2005-10-09T15:34:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	I think if you are comfortable compiling your own applications, you should be fine
2005-10-09T15:35:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	comfortable? :) I feel like Im going to be sick when I do it. heh We`ll see :)
2005-10-09T15:54:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	gnomemeeting
2005-10-09T15:54:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	hmm..does that allow someone to connect via a webaddy and open up something like Win Media player (most users will be on windowz)
2005-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	p0windah	CzarAlex	its comparable to netmeeting I believe
2005-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	CzarAlex	p0windah	ok thanks.
