2008-08-16T03:16:00.000Z	wpcvenom		im on Live CD right now

2008-08-16T03:17:00.000Z	wpcvenom		I am booting the live CD from my 4gb flash drive
2008-08-16T03:17:00.000Z	wpcvenom		my question is
2008-08-16T03:17:00.000Z	wpcvenom		will linux install on the flash drive, or will it install on the main drive of the computer, which is my C drive
2008-08-16T03:17:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	select to install it to the flash drive
2008-08-16T03:17:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	you will come to a partitioner
2008-08-16T03:18:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	don't worry you will know if it is going to install to the main hard drive
2008-08-16T03:20:00.000Z	wpcvenom	Snares	it says "Setting up a partitioner"
2008-08-16T03:20:00.000Z	wpcvenom	Snares	after I chose my timezone and keyboard
2008-08-16T03:21:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	yes, then it will take you to a place where you can either resize the current partition, or select where you want to install ubuntu to
2008-08-16T03:21:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	do not worry! it will not install on your hard drive unless you go temporarily blind and accidentally press enter too many times
2008-08-16T03:27:00.000Z	wpcvenom	Snares	its kinda, not moving afte 46% on seting up partitioner
2008-08-16T03:27:00.000Z	wpcvenom	Snares	it says "scanning disks"
2008-08-16T03:28:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	it may take a bit, be patient
2008-08-16T03:28:00.000Z	Snares	wpcvenom	just make sure you don't select an sci or hda unless you're SURE it's the flash drive
