2008-03-24T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	subsume	that wiki page should give you instructions.  If the instructions are failing, pastebin exactly what you did and the complete output
2008-03-24T01:26:00.000Z	subsume	jrib	can you explain why a fresh install of ubuntu fails to take care of these things?
2008-03-24T01:28:00.000Z	subsume	jrib	the error upon running grub-install is "Your /usr is broken; please fix it before calling this wrapper!"
2008-03-24T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	subsume	no, I can't explain it. (It's supposed to).  You should probably file a bug.  Tell the room about your error and what you did to get it
2008-03-24T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	subsume	did you run the option "check cd for defects" before installing?
2008-03-24T01:39:00.000Z	jrib	subsume	no, I told you to tell the room your error and what you did to get it
2008-03-24T01:39:00.000Z	subsume	jrib	I already pasted it to you.
2008-03-24T01:39:00.000Z	subsume	jrib	the error upon running grub-install is "Your /usr is broken; please fix it before calling this wrapper!"
