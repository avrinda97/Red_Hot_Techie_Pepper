2008-11-22T04:08:00.000Z	zetheroo		I am attempting to install cups-pdf from Synaptic ... but its taking forever ... and I am wondering if it is supposed to take this long ... seems to be at the point of "Starting Common Unix Printing System: cupsd" and the hard drive is working non-stop ... what happening?
2008-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	is updatedb or tracker  running in parallel?
2008-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	probably tracker .. since I did not turn it off
2008-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	the install itself should not take long
2008-11-22T04:10:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	try checking with the system monitor or top
2008-11-22T04:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	yeah trackerd is running...
2008-11-22T04:11:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	should I End trackerd and tracker-applet?
2008-11-22T04:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	I tried to end trackerd but it says it is uninteruptible ... wtf?
2008-11-22T04:12:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	if you like your hardisk getting indexed for fast search, leave it on or kill it temporary. i switched it off
2008-11-22T04:12:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	maybe its running as different user,  e.g. root
2008-11-22T04:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	ok.. it worked when i did it the 3rd time
2008-11-22T04:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	and now the install just finished
2008-11-22T04:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	thanks for your help
2008-11-22T05:14:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	start filing bugs for broken things on launchpad.net :-)
2008-11-22T05:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	done that and its gone nowhere
2008-11-22T05:57:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	so 1 out of 3 solved. up to the next one ;-)
2008-11-22T05:58:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	ha ... correct
2008-11-22T05:58:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	well the mic issue is a no-go ... but the Wireless is still a mystery
2008-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	madwifi? ndiswrapper?
2008-11-22T06:01:00.000Z	zetheroo	zsquareplusc	hmm ... I thought the madwifi driver was the one used in Intrepid!?
2008-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	zetheroo	dont know. but on the EEE pc is not the same in the kernel and what i installed manually
