2008-04-05T07:31:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke		Is there a way to have my CPU temp's in a panel?
2008-04-05T07:32:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	yes, you will need to install the sensors with synaptic before they will work
2008-04-05T07:33:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	I have lmsensors installed..
2008-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	i have the sensors-applet installed as well as sensord and lm-sensors
2008-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	I just installed sensors-applet... Yet it doesn't seem to be available in the add to panel options.
2008-04-05T07:36:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	Never mind... I found it.
2008-04-05T07:36:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	its called hardware sensors monitor....you might wa.....ah ok
2008-04-05T07:37:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	 wow... 113 for one and 115 for the other.. I guess that could be considered "cool"
2008-04-05T07:38:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	you talking about the cores?
2008-04-05T07:38:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	 Yes.
2008-04-05T07:38:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	115, 109, 124, 109 here
2008-04-05T07:38:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	 a little warm
2008-04-05T07:39:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	 Ah, then we seem to be a bit on the same page.. Laptop here, so I imagine it would run a little hotter than a desktop.
2008-04-05T07:40:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	truth be told i probably need more fans in my box.....i have 4 500giggers in there with 2 case fans, a 700w power supply and a 120 extreme h/s fan stuck in the thing
2008-04-05T07:41:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	 Liquid may be your friend.
2008-04-05T07:41:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	yeah, buts its such a headache...it usually doesnt run reaaaal hot
2008-04-05T07:42:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	I've seen some nice kits..
2008-04-05T07:43:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	which one you like best?  i checked out the shootouts on toms a while back, but i decided not to mess with it...i still might pop one in there
2008-04-05T07:43:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	Was on newegg..... Hold on.
2008-04-05T07:46:00.000Z	pokerfacepenguin	Gun_Smoke	 you use that one yourself?
2008-04-05T07:47:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	pokerfacepenguin	 No.. I was looking to build a box.. I decided to start with what I could afford for cooling before I started picking parts away.
