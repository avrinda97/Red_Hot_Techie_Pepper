2012-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	Guest8983	tripelb	the problem can be with the wifi router installed on your pc
2012-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	Guest8983	tripelb	it can also be with the network card
2012-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	tripelb		router on my PC??? Does not compute. It's the same PC. I booted from a live CD.
2012-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	tripelb		It's the same PC. It's the same network card.
2012-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	tripelb		Ubuntu does see the other WiFi hot spots in the neighborhood
2012-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	tripelb		I take  that back. it does not see as many as sox.  no twcable (hotspotname). But this 1 is right next to the computer in my hand.
2012-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	Guest8983		what brand is the computer?
2012-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	tripelb		I tried text to hidden network. That didn't work either.
2012-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	tripelb		 as I said. It's a mac book.
2012-11-23T11:12:00.000Z	tripelb		repeat -- my old Macbook sees  my wifi hotspot never failing. Ubuntu 12.04 - NO. does not see it. wifi from phone.
2012-11-23T11:13:00.000Z	tripelb		I finally gave up on getting a USB flash drive to boot on ubuntu. So I burnt myself a liveCD then I checked it was perfect excellent and now is this I'm so disappointed
2012-11-23T11:16:00.000Z	tripelb		I got the AMD+Mac ISO. too.  everything was going so well.
2012-11-23T11:16:00.000Z	Guest8983		tryusing the recovery disk (if possible), format the whole pc and re-install the OS again
2012-11-23T11:17:00.000Z	tripelb	kj4	now what?
2012-11-23T11:18:00.000Z	tripelb		reason I'm doing Ubuntu is that I can't get SASL on a Mac with Snow Leopard
2012-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	tripelb		" thanks for the help". What I want to do is get freenode from my Mac using the phone hotspot. Is that so difficult?
2012-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	tripelb		well I keep coming back presidential it works. I suppose I must go to sleep now.
2012-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	tripelb		nn
2012-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	Guest8983	tripelb	go use the ifconfig or netstat command to check your connections
