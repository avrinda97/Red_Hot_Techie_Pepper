2010-03-06T12:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	"sudo fdisk -l" will show your HDs
2010-03-06T12:59:00.000Z	claws_	ZykoticK9	: i typed... sudo ./$setup.sh. it say the command not found
2010-03-06T12:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	sorry the $ was just to show it was a variable, use "sudo ./setup.sh"
2010-03-06T13:00:00.000Z	claws_	ZykoticK9	: still command not found  :(
2010-03-06T13:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	you have to be in the same directory as setup.sh when you run the command
2010-03-06T13:01:00.000Z	claws_	ZykoticK9	: i am :s
2010-03-06T13:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	try "sudo sh setup.sh"
2010-03-06T13:02:00.000Z	claws_	ZykoticK9	: it says... cant open setup.sh
2010-03-06T13:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	are you running 64bit version of Ubuntu?
2010-03-06T13:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	what about what ActionParsnip asked?
2010-03-06T13:04:00.000Z	claws_	ZykoticK9	: yes i see setup.sh
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	claws_	does "sudo sh setup.sh" give you ANY other output other then "cannot open"
2010-03-06T13:06:00.000Z	claws_	ZykoticK9	: claws@claws-laptop:~/Alpha_Centauri_iso$ sudo sh setup.sh
