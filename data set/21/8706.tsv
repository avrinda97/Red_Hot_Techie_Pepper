2006-02-21T06:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rewt_	I'm not sure, since I haven't used that.
2006-02-21T06:08:00.000Z	rewt_	tonyyarusso	well damn
2006-02-21T11:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rewt_	Yes, Intel Pro 2915 a/b/g, worked out of the box.
2006-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	rewt_	tonyyarusso	im using nsidwrapper or whatever it is....but if i push my wireless button when it's going I have to manually turn on the mod again and reactivate the card manually....if I push the button to turn it back on nothing happens?
2006-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rewt_	You might be able to find the script being run by the button event and add some modprobe lines, but I don't know the exact details.
