2005-06-09T10:17:00.000Z	DanielC		Hello. Does Ubuntu use /usr/local for anything?
2005-06-09T10:18:00.000Z	daba	DanielC	ls it.
2005-06-09T10:18:00.000Z	DanielC		It looks like all the subdirectories are empty.
2005-06-09T10:18:00.000Z	DanielC	daba	I did. It has directories, but those seem empty.
2005-06-09T10:18:00.000Z	daba		well, on your system it may not then...:) did you -a?
2005-06-09T10:19:00.000Z	daba	DanielC	I personally know for one i have Javas there.
2005-06-09T10:19:00.000Z	DanielC	daba	Ok. Ultimately, I was trying to find a good place to put software that is not from the Ubuntu repository.
2005-06-09T10:19:00.000Z	DanielC	daba	I guess it'll go in /opt then.
2005-06-09T10:20:00.000Z	daba		...bah, well, if its something root should run, that is not a bad place, and make him own it...
2005-06-09T10:20:00.000Z	daba		bur if its software like limewire, just run it yourself.
2005-06-09T10:20:00.000Z	DanielC		[koji] : LDP?
2005-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	DanielC		ok
2005-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	daba		tldp.com
2005-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	DanielC		ok
2005-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	DanielC		thanks
2005-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	daba		but, I mean, I told you for progs.
2005-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	DanielC	daba	Where do you put softwarelike limewire?
2005-06-09T10:22:00.000Z	daba		in...your folder.. or run it as a completely separate user, with no privileges, just a home folder...
2005-06-09T10:22:00.000Z	daba		yo.
2005-06-09T10:22:00.000Z	daba		testis.
2005-06-09T10:23:00.000Z	DanielC	daba	Well, if the point is to run limewire as a regular user I could chown /opt
