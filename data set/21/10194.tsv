2005-07-20T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud		as an aside, I now understand why everyone says to get an external modem
2005-07-20T10:05:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	what one were you trying to use?
2005-07-20T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	I got it working, it's a lucent version. It's just a pain, and the install docs I got where not 'quite' right
2005-07-20T10:06:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	so what seems to be the problem?
2005-07-20T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	well, linmodems/techion/packages/ltmodem/kernel-2.6/ubuntu-install.html was close, but not quite. But, I am using the darn thing now.
2005-07-20T10:08:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	it's been a few years since I used a modem, but I remember there being problems then. I ended up buying new ones just to get it working.
2005-07-20T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	I'll be buying an external tomorrow.
2005-07-20T10:09:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	I found that US Robotics made an internal one that worked for me back then.
2005-07-20T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	I have a zoom isa in the other machine. I didn't realize just how good I had it.
2005-07-20T10:11:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	don't know about zoom
2005-07-20T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	probably the same as your us robotics, just address it as a serial port.
2005-07-20T10:12:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	my modem was internal on an ISA slot
2005-07-20T10:13:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	the same
2005-07-20T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	?
2005-09-10T09:29:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	I'll have to look into aptitude. Never used it, but I've heard of it
2005-09-10T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	check the wiki, it has a survival guide
2005-09-10T09:30:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	thanks, I will
2005-10-25T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	you can use garnome or jhbuild, they're on the gnome.org site. Be sure to strip all the ubuntu packages first, though
2005-10-25T08:30:00.000Z	DonL	nickrud	I'd like to stay as much Ubuntu as possible
2005-10-25T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	I screwed the pooch upgrading also, but that was probably my fault from semi-adequate handling of problems in the preview.
2006-06-27T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	DonL	yes that can, just do the verify stuff: http:wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto
