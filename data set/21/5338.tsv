2007-11-05T15:40:00.000Z	kakoonia	kahrytan	Thanks..
2007-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	kahrytan	kakoonia	 when compiling, you always need -dev packages.
2007-11-05T15:49:00.000Z	kakoonia	kahrytan	i installed libwnck-dev, and ./configure, it was kindda quick, but i didnt see any errors.. then i did make, and it said Nothing to be done for 'all', what does that mean?
2007-11-05T15:49:00.000Z	kahrytan	kakoonia	What?
2007-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	kahrytan	kakoonia	 did you use make install?
