2005-07-22T10:27:00.000Z	the_walrus		I just installed, and its booted into X, apparently I only have 9MB mem free, out of 1gig
2005-07-22T10:27:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Yes, that's fine.
2005-07-22T10:27:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	9MB free, out of 1gig? That doesn't really seem fine
2005-07-22T10:28:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	linux is not as stupid as Windows. it's using your "free" ram as disk cache. When an application needs it, it will be freed.
2005-07-22T10:28:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	ok, that makes more sense, just seems unusual, never had a linux box doing this before
2005-07-22T10:29:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Was that via 'free' or via other utils?
2005-07-22T10:30:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Then my guess is that you previously had buggy vm behaviour.
2005-07-22T10:31:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Yes, you forgot to enable HIGHMEM 4GB
2005-07-22T10:31:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	looks like your kerel didn't find all ram (or do you have integrated vga?)
2005-07-22T10:32:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	I always wondered what that did
2005-07-22T10:32:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	I dont have integrated mem, I should have a gig of mem there :/
2005-07-22T10:32:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Without that option you can only access about 986 or so MB ram.
2005-07-22T10:32:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Then yeah, you need to set HIGHMEM to 4, recompile and reboot.
2005-07-22T10:33:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Precompiled ubuntu kernels already have that enabled.
2005-07-22T10:33:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	then why do I only have 900MB of ram or so it tells me?
2005-07-22T10:33:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	You on the -386 installer kernel still?
2005-07-22T10:34:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	I just installed, so I'm not sure
2005-07-22T10:34:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	Then yes. Install a kernel for your cpu and you'll be fine.
2005-07-22T10:35:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	'apt-cache search linux-image' should give you  alist of kernels to pick from.
2005-07-22T10:36:00.000Z	the_walrus	cafuego	thanks, I was just googling that
2005-07-22T10:36:00.000Z	cafuego	the_walrus	-686 for p2,p3,p4. k7 for athlon.
