2009-12-17T11:01:00.000Z	^paradox^		i put in a dvd to copy it and click on disc copy and specify the hp burner as the source and write to drive and it wont give me the copy button
2009-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	^paradox^		its just sitting now with the copy button grayed out
2009-12-17T11:03:00.000Z	^paradox^		ive tried dvds and an audio disc. no luck
2009-12-17T11:03:00.000Z	^paradox^		its never done this
2009-12-17T11:03:00.000Z	^paradox^		ive copied dvds before without trouble
2009-12-17T11:04:00.000Z	^paradox^		yes but it acts the same
2009-12-17T11:06:00.000Z	^paradox^		i was able to copy a dvd by inserting the dvd and right clicking and selecting copy disc without using brasero
2009-12-17T11:06:00.000Z	^paradox^		i dont have a different machine handy
2009-12-17T11:08:00.000Z	^paradox^		to do by right clicking on the dvd icon on the desktop took about 15 minutes total
2009-12-17T11:08:00.000Z	^paradox^		i dont wanna spend that kind of time on every dvd i decide to copy
2009-12-17T11:08:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	Perhaps nautilus-actions and throw in there the commands to copy DVD?
2009-12-17T12:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	You don't see Random Port in Transmission Preferences/Settings?
2009-12-17T12:20:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	Take a screenshot.
2009-12-17T12:34:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	You're using Hardy Heron LTS (Long-Term Support) which is excellent for large businesses/institutions who does not wish to deploy every 6 months.  It is not old, but it is very stable.
2009-12-17T12:35:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	You can install Transmission PPA which will enable you to obtain Transmission 1.76 (instead of whatever version you're on now).
2009-12-17T12:36:00.000Z	^paradox^	mobi-sheep	ok so is there an easy update transmission? and if i instead use deluge what should i do with transmission?
2009-12-17T12:36:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	Deluge / Transmission / Vuze / rTorrent are all torrenting client. You are to do what you want with. I can supply you with easy way to update.
2009-12-17T12:44:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	Close Transmissions. Open a terminal and run "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:transmissionbt/ppa && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade" -- That is it.
2009-12-17T12:48:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	It is not complicated. What airtonix and I suggest is that you include the new PPA repo for transmission to be upgraded.
2009-12-17T12:54:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	---> echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/transmissionbt/ubuntu hardy main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/transmissionbt-ppa-hardy.list && sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 365C5CA1 && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade && echo Done\! \>\:\}\~
2009-12-17T13:18:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	^paradox^	Correct.
