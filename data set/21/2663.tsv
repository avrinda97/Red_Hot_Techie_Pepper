2010-01-08T21:48:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	the contents are where they are installed
2010-01-08T21:48:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	they are absolute paths
2010-02-28T06:20:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	both / and /org/gnome/Screensaver seem to be working for me for paths
2010-02-28T06:21:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	this is my script in question, when i put "/" as a path i don't capture any signals : http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8889393&postcount=33
2010-02-28T06:45:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	ok, this line seems to work for me, bus.add_signal_receiver(callback_func, "ActiveChanged", "org.gnome.ScreenSaver")
2010-02-28T06:45:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	testing it now'
2010-02-28T06:52:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	sorry that doesn't do anything for me
2010-02-28T07:01:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	could be a problem with the screensaver not sending the appropriate signals, but http://paste.ubuntu.com/385437/ this works for me (two files, one to start the screensaver with dbus, since I can't seem to get it to active on its own...perhaps that's why mine works)
2012-03-03T07:53:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	alt+middle-click maybe? seems to work in oneiric gnome-shell
2012-03-03T07:54:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	yes i know that alt+middle click drag is the default, but i have always prefered (and been able to) change it to alt+rightclick drag.
2012-03-03T07:54:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	in fact on my system 76 11.10 64bit laptop, i did somehow change it to alt+rightclick drag
2012-03-03T07:59:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	short answer, you have to install compizconfig-settings-manager and change it there
2012-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	yeah I found it for gnome-shell too, still gconf: gconftool-2 -t bool -s /apps/metacity/general/resize_with_right_button true;
2012-03-03T08:04:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	which is of course only applicable to older versions of ubuntu yes?
2012-03-03T08:04:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	no I just tried it, still works in 11.10
2012-03-03T08:04:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	doesn't for me. (in gnome shell)
2012-03-03T08:05:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	did you restart the shell?
2012-03-03T08:06:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	thanks for that, this was the missing step
2012-03-03T08:08:00.000Z	airtonix	trism	i have one of those microsoft arc mice that flattens out (this middle button is actually a touch pad) so middle click is a tedious double tap
2012-03-03T08:08:00.000Z	trism	airtonix	yeah it seems to work better with right-click than middle-click on my mouse as well (smoother)
