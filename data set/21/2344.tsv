2009-11-08T11:05:00.000Z	UBlondie		I have a Western Digital  160G usb hard drive that has continual problems with mounting on Ubuntu9.10  ...very temperamental!  I finally got an error message that says: Unable to mount, exit code 13 NTFS_attr_pread  ...failed to read first NTFS_BLOCK_SIZE bytes of potential restart page. ...and then goes on about suggesting doing chkdsk /f with winxp. Can anyone help with this?
2009-11-08T11:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	Did you do the chkdsk?
2009-11-08T11:07:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	 ..well, not this time (yet), but I have done it plenty of times and I continue to have problems with it. The same was happening on 9.04  ..it's bugging the hell out of me!
2009-11-08T11:08:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	You've got filesystem corruption.  Do the chkdsk, and then mount the USB drive with the sync option.
2009-11-08T11:09:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	could you explain the sync option to me please? ...or point me to where I can find out?  I haven't heard of that before
2009-11-08T11:09:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	After that, always unmount the USB drive through the right-click menu.
2009-11-08T11:09:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	..but it mounts by itself of course.
2009-11-08T11:10:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	It is an option that you can put in the /etc/fstab and is documented by `man mount`.  I don't remember where to put it for removable media.
2009-11-08T11:11:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	ok, that's completely foreign to me, but I'll have a look. When you say to mount with right click menu. Where from?   ...usually, if the drive won't be mounted, it doesn't show up anywhere. Not even with 'blkid' from Terminal.
2009-11-08T11:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	The removable disk should appear in the left-side pane of the Nautilus fie manager, and on your desktop.  Right click the drive from either of those places.
2009-11-08T11:14:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	The right-click context menu should have a umount or eject option.  Doing this before you pull the USB connection prevents filesystem glitches.
2009-11-08T11:15:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	 yes, it does when it's recognised,. but when it 'un-mounts' it also disappears from desktop and from nautilus!!
2009-11-08T11:15:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	And when that happens, the disk is safe to unplug.
2009-11-08T11:15:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	 yes, but if the drive isn't visible, then you can't use right-click menu. That's the problem I'm having. The system doesn't even 'see' the drive!
2009-11-08T11:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	Don't ignore error messages and follow my advice.  Go run the chkdsk command.
2009-11-08T11:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	The filesytem is borked.  It won't appear again until you fix it according to the error message.
2009-11-08T11:16:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	  haha, yes!  :)   ...I will do it, yet again!!   ...aaahhhhh  :/
2009-11-08T11:18:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	 ..it usually works for at least a few minutes again after I do chkdsk ....but problem returns very quickly again. Drive still works ok on Windows!  :/
2009-11-08T11:19:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	If the disk disconnects or disappears when you're using it on the Ubuntu computer, then you've got a second problem.  You'll need to watch the /var/log/messages file for more information.
2009-11-08T11:19:00.000Z	dajhorn	UBlondie	If the USB drive has a power plug, then use it and the problem may stop happening.
2009-11-08T11:20:00.000Z	UBlondie	dajhorn	aaahh, actually, someone did suggest using the double usb connector!!  ...I forgot about that. Still need to try that one!
