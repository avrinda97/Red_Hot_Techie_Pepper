2010-02-15T06:47:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	your question makes no sense
2010-02-15T06:48:00.000Z	ujjain	histo	It lists 9.04.
2010-02-15T06:48:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	the wiki just hasn't been updated
2010-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	you may want to search the forums for you keyboard model number
2010-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	does the keyboard work in the bios or other os?
2010-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	okay is it possible that the system is hung and your keyboard and mouse work?
2010-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	if you plug in another keyboard does that one work?
2010-02-15T06:51:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	okay then how are you sure that the system is not locked up at the login screen?
2010-02-15T06:52:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	Maybe the installer hung. Try hitting ctrl+alt+f1
2010-02-15T06:53:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	its possible that the installer is hanging at the same point everytime and your keyboard and mouse are just fine.
2010-02-15T06:53:00.000Z	ujjain	histo	Hmm,,
2010-02-15T06:53:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	thats what i've been trying to tell you.
2010-02-15T06:53:00.000Z	ujjain	histo	I am sorry, my English is not great. ctrl+alt+f1 will test
2010-02-15T06:54:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	Try switching to a tty with ctrl+alt+f1 when it hangs if that doesn't work.  Then boot in the just try mode and double click the installer on the desktop see what happens.
2010-02-15T06:55:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	I would also check the media as marc__ has suggested. Worst case scenario you can use the alternate iso.
2010-02-15T07:09:00.000Z	ujjain	histo	ctrl+alt+f1 did not respond, reconnecting keyboard/mouse did not work, try ubuntu did not have working mouse/keyboard either.
2010-02-15T07:10:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	hrm... did try ubuntu boot all the way to the desktop
2010-02-15T07:10:00.000Z	ujjain	histo	Yes, it booted all the way.
2010-02-15T07:10:00.000Z	histo	ujjain	^^^^^^^^^^^^marc
