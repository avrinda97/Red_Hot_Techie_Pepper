2008-08-29T16:42:00.000Z	bazhang	backwaters	I would set to alsa from autodetect and see if that changes anything; also go to terminal and type alsamixer and make sure nothing is muted.
2008-08-29T16:43:00.000Z	backwaters	bazhang	checked. nothin is muted
2008-08-29T16:43:00.000Z	bazhang	backwaters	then switch from autodetect to alsa and do the test in sound prefs
