2009-10-29T10:57:00.000Z	partyspoiler		where is the party tonight?
2009-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	partyspoiler		iam interested in a strange bug with ext4
2009-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	partyspoiler	What bug?
2009-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	partyspoiler		but i trouble shoot later tonight, some applications which ran great on older distros could crash on ext4?
2009-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	partyspoiler		or maybe its akernel thing
2009-10-29T10:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U		!details | partyspoiler
2009-10-29T10:59:00.000Z	partyspoiler		jordan_U:its a game, whenever i run the version which takes advantage of dual cores, it crashes with segfault
2009-10-29T11:00:00.000Z	partyspoiler		jordan_U maybe its a kernel thing, worked flawless in all older releases
2009-10-29T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	partyspoiler	Why do you think it's an ext4 bug?
2009-10-29T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	partyspoiler	Why do you think it's a kernel thing?
2009-10-29T11:00:00.000Z	partyspoiler		jordan_U just a hunch, the installer fails to write a few things to home directory
2009-10-29T11:01:00.000Z	partyspoiler		jordan_U kernel bug because  the dual core thing is enabled in the kernel
2009-10-29T11:01:00.000Z	partyspoiler		so probably not ext4 but kernel
2009-10-29T11:01:00.000Z	partyspoiler		i will have confirmation tonight
2009-10-29T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	partyspoiler	I doubt it's kernel, using multiple cores can trigger race conditions that won't happen when only using one core
2009-10-29T11:02:00.000Z	partyspoiler		jordan_U hmm race conditions?
2009-10-29T11:02:00.000Z	partyspoiler		jordan_U well, the thing is , when i connect to an online server it crashes, doesnt crash with the single player
2009-10-29T11:03:00.000Z	partyspoiler	Jordan_U	it reloads the config file for that session online and crashes
2009-10-29T11:03:00.000Z	partyspoiler	Jordan_U	it was working fine with alpha 3 of karmic
2009-10-29T11:05:00.000Z	partyspoiler	Jordan_U	could you think of reasons why this might be happening, it was fine for the last 2 years i used it
2009-10-29T11:05:00.000Z	partyspoiler	Jordan_U	ever since ubuntu 7.04
