2004-11-01T14:28:00.000Z	witigonen		Could somebody help me with some ATI/fglrx driver problems I'm having?  I've followed the howto and it's still coming up with mesa drivers.
2004-11-01T14:29:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	what does lsmod say?
2004-11-01T14:29:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	fglrx 215044 0
2004-11-01T14:30:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	what does your /etc/XF86Config-r say at the Driver keyword under Device
2004-11-01T14:31:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	fglrx
2004-11-01T14:32:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	what does /var/log/XFree86.0.log say. does it give any errors or warnings that could have anything to do with fglrx
2004-11-01T14:36:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	no that appears to be a normal warning, i have it too. (and my driver is working.)
2004-11-01T14:37:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	okay.  There is a lot of fglrx activity after that, I'm still looking for a warning/error.
2004-11-01T14:37:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	k
2004-11-01T14:39:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	DRI initialization failed (maybe driver kenel module missing or bad)
2004-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	should I go through fglrxconfig?
2004-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	alright that's probebly it.
2004-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	mmm i'll upload my XF86Config, perhaps it's a settings thing.
2004-11-01T14:42:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	thank you.
2004-11-01T14:43:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	http://www.stratos-online.nl/XF86Config-4
2004-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	your device section is massive compared to mine.  I'm going to run through fglrxconfig and see if that fixes it.
2004-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	well my experience with fglrxconfig is that it makes a very very very messy file, basicly i copy&pasted the device section :)
2004-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	so true..
2004-11-01T14:54:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	well then i'm out of idea's. for me my radeon 'just worked'
2004-11-01T14:54:00.000Z	stratos	witigonen	/var/log/XFsumthing
2004-11-01T14:54:00.000Z	witigonen	stratos	thanks.
