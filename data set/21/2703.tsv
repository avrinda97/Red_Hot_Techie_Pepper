2009-10-08T19:38:00.000Z	NeoCicak		hi all......has anyone ever experienced sluggish rdesktop / terminal server client performance?
2009-10-08T19:38:00.000Z	NeoCicak		its very sluggish on doing screen refresh
2009-10-08T19:38:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	that's pretty much dependent of your network connection
2009-10-08T19:38:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	you could try lowering the graphics
2009-10-08T19:39:00.000Z	NeoCicak	blackxored	mm... not really... using the same machine, same network.......... but windows xp, i can connect to the other end, and performance is very smooth
2009-10-08T19:39:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	you're using tsclient?
2009-10-08T19:39:00.000Z	NeoCicak	blackxored	i've tried to lower the graphics..... even scale down the colour to 256... but still slow
2009-10-08T19:39:00.000Z	NeoCicak	blackxored	yeah.. and i've tried rdesktop too
2009-10-08T19:39:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	do you experience this behaviour with all the machines you try to connect to?
2009-10-08T19:39:00.000Z	NeoCicak	blackxored	yup
2009-10-08T19:40:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	what's it's loadavg?
2009-10-08T19:41:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	do you have ways to generating debug information?
2009-10-08T19:41:00.000Z	NeoCicak	blackxored	mmmm nope... i dont know how to do that with tsclient
2009-10-08T19:43:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	without debugging info is kind of hard to tell anything coherent
2009-10-08T19:44:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	really? what kind of fw are you using on your host and in your remote machine?
2009-10-08T19:45:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	fw => firewall yes
2009-10-08T19:45:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	or maybe a bundled security product which includes one
2009-10-08T19:45:00.000Z	NeoCicak	blackxored	nope.. nothing at all
2009-10-08T19:45:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	that's weird
2009-10-08T19:45:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	but as I said without debug-info can't tell anything
2009-10-08T19:47:00.000Z	blackxored	NeoCicak	you got a pretty tricky setup over there ;)
