2008-06-26T01:32:00.000Z	george__	genii	both boxes are running ubuntu
2008-06-26T01:33:00.000Z	genii	george__	You need on at least one of them the samba daemon then and not just the default which is the client
2008-06-26T01:43:00.000Z	genii	george__	ssh and then fish:/ in file browser
2008-06-26T01:36:00.000Z	genii	george__	You need to actually have samba installed in order to use smbpasswd. As I said only smbclient is on default install. One box at least needs the server of it.
2008-06-26T01:37:00.000Z	george__	genii	what is the name of the packange i need to install ?
2008-06-26T01:37:00.000Z	genii	george__	Just samba
2008-06-26T01:37:00.000Z	george__	genii	 Synaptic or Add/Remove?
2008-06-26T01:38:00.000Z	genii	george__	As you like.
2008-06-26T01:39:00.000Z	george__	genii	but what about security?
2008-06-26T01:40:00.000Z	george__	genii	and why should I use a protocol that is used for linux to windows communication?
2008-06-26T01:41:00.000Z	george__	genii	the ssharing i am after is linux to linux
2008-06-26T01:41:00.000Z	genii	george__	Then why were you asking about smb:/ ??
2008-06-26T01:42:00.000Z	george__	genii	 I wasn't asking about samba, joh mentioned it as an easy way to do it..
2008-06-26T01:42:00.000Z	george__	genii	I was asking about a way to transfer files between to linux boxes..
2008-06-26T01:43:00.000Z	george__	genii	GUI or terminal ?
2008-06-26T01:44:00.000Z	genii	george__	Nautilus for instance
2008-06-26T01:44:00.000Z	george__	genii	so I need to install ssh and then youse fish:/local.ip ?
2008-06-26T01:45:00.000Z	george__	genii	Nautilus cannot handle fish: locations.
2008-06-26T01:45:00.000Z	genii	george__	I'm normally in KDE here so I would be using Konqueror. But there must be one in Gnome that works by default as well
2008-06-26T01:49:00.000Z	genii	george__	In commandline you can do like:      sshfs name@remote:dir /local/mountpoint
