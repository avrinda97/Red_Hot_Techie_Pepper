2010-10-01T21:41:00.000Z	l0de		I wish this OS were more secure
2010-10-01T21:41:00.000Z	l0de		I never had these problems on windows
2010-10-01T21:43:00.000Z	l0de		Dr_willis well it's certainly on my system
2010-10-01T21:43:00.000Z	l0de		and I'm using the latest konquerer
2010-10-01T21:43:00.000Z	l0de		yeah I have had this issue maco, I don't need you acting smart about it
2010-10-01T21:44:00.000Z	l0de		maybe you never got a virus yourself but you don't have to talk down to me just because I do
2010-10-01T21:44:00.000Z	l0de		You might be thinking of someone else
2010-10-01T21:44:00.000Z	l0de		I might have complained about ubuntu being unsecured but I certainly haven't been banned
2010-10-01T21:45:00.000Z	l0de		that's what I'm doing now Dr_Willis, thanks
2010-10-01T21:45:00.000Z	l0de		Midway through an avg scan and it's not finding anything
2010-10-01T21:46:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 does same thing happen if you log in as another user?
2010-10-01T21:47:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 have you checked your startup applications?
2010-10-01T21:47:00.000Z	l0de	bobstro	the only account I have on here is root
2010-10-01T21:47:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 ah... you're in as root.
2010-10-01T21:47:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 i imagine you've been advised using root for all activities is risky?
2010-10-01T21:48:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 ah yes, i have seen this bit before.
2010-10-01T21:48:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 i've seen your bit. this routine.
2010-10-01T21:49:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 no, just saying it's not original.
2010-10-01T21:49:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 no, apparently not.
2010-10-01T21:49:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 when you run as root, yes it is.
2010-10-01T21:50:00.000Z	bobstro	l0de	 i was trying to suggest fixes, but you don't seem interested.
