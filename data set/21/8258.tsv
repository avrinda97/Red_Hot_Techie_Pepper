2007-06-06T13:19:00.000Z	dragon		i just installed ubuntu and how do i look at you tube videos
2007-06-06T13:19:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	you need to install flash
2007-06-06T13:21:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	no - read the url I sent you
2009-09-18T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	there really isn't one in reality, you need to use combos of products to make a server with similar functionality
2009-09-18T00:45:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	i'd be happy if i could get the calendar working
2009-09-18T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	look at sunbird and caldev
2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	do you want a client or server ?
2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	alright, i'll check those out. I want a client.
2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	ignore my advice then, I thought you wanted a server
2009-09-18T00:47:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	oh, sunbird sounded like a client though.
2009-09-18T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	it is, but it can't connect to exchange
2009-12-05T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	some applications are 32bit only - some machines will run better with 32/64bit
2009-12-05T02:03:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	it's a new laptop, dual core, for general use.
2010-11-12T05:54:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	is there a place where I could get a serious question answered?
2010-11-12T05:54:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	what's up ?
2010-11-12T05:55:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	that sounds a real mess
2010-11-12T05:56:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	yes, it's hard to predict whether it'll come back up on next reboot. Can't afford to have this server down. Where do I start?
2010-11-12T05:56:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	I'd kill the process, and re-start it
2010-11-12T05:56:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	kill dpkg?
2010-11-12T05:57:00.000Z	ikonia	dragon	it's a risk, but that's how I'd do it
2010-11-12T06:20:00.000Z	dragon	ikonia	shcherbak: killed dpkg and ran `sudo dpkg --configure -a`, installation continuing as expected.
