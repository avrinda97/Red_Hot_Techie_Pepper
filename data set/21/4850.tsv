2008-01-29T04:07:00.000Z	bastones		Hello. I have so far burnt the latest version of Ubuntu onto a CD and put it in the tower's CD slot. I pressed F12 on initial start of the Dell computer, and I tried IDE (I think) CDR or something and it says F1 to boot or F12 for utlity. How do I install the latest version of Ubutu onto my computer with the CD I have.
2008-01-29T04:08:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	do you have any thing else installed on the tower?
2008-01-29T04:08:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	Yes, I currently have v4.1 installed on C: of Ubuntu.
2008-01-29T04:09:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	did you download the iso file? if not, id suggest you do so that comes with the live cd. this way you can install it through the ubuntu live cd, and at the same time being able to add/delete partitions on your harddrive.
2008-01-29T04:09:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	Yes I downloaded the .iso file and burnt it directly onto my CD.
2008-01-29T04:10:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	what do I do next?
2008-01-29T04:10:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	okay did you download the verison that comes with the LiveCD as well?
2008-01-29T04:10:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	!install
2008-01-29T04:11:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	I tried installing by initially putting in the CD at the start of the computer being turned on, it didn't automatically start installing like last time. So I restarted computer and it didn't autoinstall again.
2008-01-29T04:12:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	did a ubuntu screen come up atleaste?
2008-01-29T04:12:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	I'll try again see if it installs, one min
2008-01-29T04:13:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	when I turned on computer, it automatically just opening the 4.1 version I installed originally of Ubuntu and not the installation CD in the CD slot :S
2008-01-29T04:15:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	hrmm thats very odd nothing came up at all? are you sure you burned the disc write?because only thing i can think of right now is that there is something wrong with the disc..
2008-01-29T04:15:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	because regardless of which o/s you have installed.. the ubuntu liveCD/install options should come up.
2008-01-29T04:16:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	well did you burn the iso as an image?
2008-01-29T04:16:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	dont get me wrong haha but have you burned a working iso disc before?
2008-01-29T04:18:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	I copied the CD to the writable disc and Windows wizard put the .iso file on the CD. Not sure if I did it correct or what. Fortunately I have one more CD that I can use incase I do it wrong the first time, which seems more apparent I did.
2008-01-29T04:19:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	yes because if the iso is not burned the way its suppose to be burned, regardless of its on the cd.. it will not do you any good as a boot disc, it will just hold the file for no reason lol which is kind of a waste.
2008-01-29T04:19:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	are you currently on Xp?
2008-01-29T04:19:00.000Z	bastones	iKap	yes, I am using my XP laptop to burn the file to CD, etc
2008-01-29T04:20:00.000Z	iKap	bastones	and what program are you using to burn the disc agian.. did you say windows wizard?
