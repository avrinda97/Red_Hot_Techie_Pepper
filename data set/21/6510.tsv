2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	titun		only that much as of now
2007-03-23T11:31:00.000Z	titun		so how do work as root user
2007-03-23T11:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	with sudo
2007-03-23T11:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	no, Ubuntu doesn't use a seperate root password - read the RootSudo URL the bot gave you
2007-03-23T11:33:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	reading...
2007-03-23T11:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	no it won't, but no, only the first user created can sudo by default
2007-04-11T12:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	Bluefish or Screem - after you learn actual HTML/CSS coding, that is.
2007-04-11T12:49:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	I know 50% if HTMl & CSS, so no problem using bluefish
2007-04-11T12:49:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	but it lacks the feature which dreamweaver shows tags in a popup menu
2007-04-11T12:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	cool - try Screem too, it's not as well known, but it has some very nice features that Bluefish lacks
2007-04-11T12:50:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	humm....heard about screem yesteraday, does it have the display all possible tags feature?
2007-04-11T12:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	kind of, there's one sidebar that can list tags, and they can be dragged into the active document.
2007-04-11T12:51:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	like DW displays, if if type" a and then it shows all possible things
2007-04-11T12:51:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	but no auto popup?
2007-04-11T12:52:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	coz I myself don't know all the tags of HTML, so that was a good feature for me in DW
2007-04-11T12:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	it's got some auto-popup features too - start typing, for example, <a href and it'll offer to autocomplete the href="" part
2007-04-11T12:52:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	yes thts what I was asking about, thanks , downloading right now
2007-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	Thank you soooo much....... this screem is what I exactly needed, now I can show off my friends some webpages designed using OpenSource softwares, it was a challange for me
2007-04-11T13:05:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	my friends think I am craxy using Ubuntu leaving XP
2007-04-11T13:05:00.000Z	titun	Madpilot	I am constantly trying to show them I can do all the stuff that can be done in Windows, and even better, thanks for helping in my misson
2007-04-11T13:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	titun	I think my friends are crazy for sticking with XP - every time one of them complains about adware/viruses/etc I just point out that those things aren't a problem in Linux :)
