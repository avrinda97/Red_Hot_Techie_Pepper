2009-11-01T00:44:00.000Z	jordy240		I don't want to touch any partition. I just want to use the freespace. As you can see in the screenshot: http://imgur.com/9QIzZ.jpg how can it wants to use the ENTIRE disk? that's not the option I selected

2009-11-01T00:46:00.000Z	jordy240		is ubuntu's installer broken in 8.10 ?
2009-11-01T00:47:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	no?

2009-11-01T00:48:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	weird, why are you using such an old version though?
2009-11-01T00:48:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	isn't this just 2nd to  last verion? and the latest version was releast yesterday?
2009-11-01T00:49:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	in 6 months 8.10 won't be supported any more
2009-11-01T00:49:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	zvacet this is a bug with ubuntu, right?
2009-11-01T00:50:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	sure it's at least a bug with the way it displays what it is going to do, maybe more.  Use a more recent version would be my advice
2009-11-01T00:51:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	is it risky to install ubuntu by usb?
2009-11-01T00:51:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	I have yet to do so, but it should work fine
2009-11-19T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	you don't need twice, you just need equal
2009-11-19T06:41:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	and why can't ubuntu make it equial on install? instead of requiring me to have to do it?
2009-11-19T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	it usually makes it at least equal to ram in my experience.  File a bug if it didn't
2009-11-19T06:43:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	question: how can I move a partition from the left side of my ntfs parition to the right side?
2009-11-19T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	erm, doubt you can do that
2009-11-19T06:44:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	?? and hoiw come ext4 can't be shunk in gparted because it can't read it's 'superblock' or whatever? is there a fix for this?
2010-05-19T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	jordy240	because?
2010-05-19T02:56:00.000Z	jordy240	jrib	just to ask how space was and to ask what's up
