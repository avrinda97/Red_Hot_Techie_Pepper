2008-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Arnos		Yes, you can put Ubuntu on a USB
2008-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Arnos		no, I installed to USB
2008-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Arnos		from the CD
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Arnos		now I am trying to boot from just the USB.  I can login but then it just shows the background and nevers gets to the desktop
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Arnos		bummer
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Arnos		2GB
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Arnos		no 4GB
2008-04-25T06:31:00.000Z	Arnos		4GB is tight?
2008-04-25T06:31:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	oh 4gb is better.
2008-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	boot from usb?
2008-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	you wish to install from USB?
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	probably the alt cd will not do much better.
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	how big is your USB? > 4gb?
2008-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	ouch. that is tight.
2008-04-25T06:31:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	did you make sure not to included swap space?
2008-04-25T06:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	I would be better to manual parttion andnot included a swap space. just / (root)
2008-04-25T06:33:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	preferably swap is not desired on small disk spaces.
2008-04-25T06:34:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	yes. and make sure that you install grub to the usb drive not the hard drive
2008-04-25T06:34:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Arnos	cool. that is the way I do it.
