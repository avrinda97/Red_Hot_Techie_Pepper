2007-01-08T14:06:00.000Z	POVaddct		ndiswrapper is kind of giving up the open source idea. better force the card manufacturers to provide native linux drivers by not buying cards that aren't supported by native drivers. just my 2 cent.
2007-01-08T14:06:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	Nice idea, but I've already bought my laptop, and it'll be at least 2 years till I can afford another. ;P
2007-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	okay, with built-in wifi-cards its kind of hard (at least if its not minipci)
2007-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	btw, which card is it
2007-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	The infamous Broadcom 4318
2007-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	argh, and no success with bcm43xx + firmware?
2007-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	I'm using cafuego's bcm43xx firmware, and it just hasn't been working as well.  I hear from everyone that ndiswrapper provides better reception, and I think cafuego's bcm43xx is messing with NetworkManager somehow, because it can't seem to connect to a wireless network.
2007-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	I've been using dhclient on the command line
2007-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	and you tried unencrypted wlan first?
2007-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	Yeah, that's almost the only kind of WLAN I ever connect to
2007-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	That's what I've been doing.
2007-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	But I'd really like nm-applet and NetworkManager to work.
2007-01-08T14:12:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	ralink?  Who's that?
2007-01-08T14:12:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	a wifi chipset manufacturer
2007-01-08T14:12:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	Like I said - I already bought my laptop.
2007-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	i was talking about a cardbus wifi card
2007-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	Haha, I know, but I have a builtin one.
2007-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	you could use it until the bcm is supported better
2007-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	Nah, that'd be insanely annoying.
2007-01-08T14:15:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tonren	"fortunately" my notebook is old enough to have no built-in wifi card so i had a choice
2007-01-08T14:17:00.000Z	Tonren	POVaddct	I just hate to have those stupid thingies sticking out of the side of my laptop
