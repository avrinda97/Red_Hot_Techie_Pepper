2006-12-27T06:09:00.000Z	gleaner		anyone using an external cd/dvd burner on ubuntu ?
2006-12-27T06:09:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	yes, works really nice :)
2006-12-27T06:09:00.000Z	gleaner		agent yeah can you send me your kernel config?
2006-12-27T06:10:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	no, because it's external so it won't make any difference :D
2006-12-27T06:10:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	just enable usb
2006-12-27T06:10:00.000Z	gleaner		hmm I wanna make sure I got the usb stuff correct
2006-12-27T06:10:00.000Z	gleaner		wont work for tunes under slack
2006-12-27T06:10:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	and you do not need to recompile your kernel for that...
2006-12-27T06:11:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	it will not help you if i show you my config because different systems require differnt usb support
2006-12-27T06:11:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	what you need to worry about is having the correct module loaded
2006-12-27T06:11:00.000Z	gleaner		yeah my point
2006-12-27T06:11:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	lsmod :)
2006-12-27T06:12:00.000Z	gleaner		modprobe -v
2006-12-27T06:12:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	 these are the two main usb modules (that load everything else): uhci_hcd,ehci_hcd
2006-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	one is usb1  and the other usb2
2006-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	don't recompile your kernel, use the stock one as it has all modules compiled anyway
2006-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	gleaner		agent my box is setup for both
2006-12-27T06:14:00.000Z	gleaner	lastent	ls -l /proc/kcore is one way
2006-12-27T06:14:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	is your drive recognized by the kernel? use dmesg and lsusb
2006-12-27T06:15:00.000Z	gleaner		agent oh yes I can rip and burn everything but tunes...tunes  ripped from the ext generate hard errors
2006-12-27T06:15:00.000Z	agent	gleaner	what are "tunes"?
