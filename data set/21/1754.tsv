2011-04-20T22:33:00.000Z	theos		hi! i have an hp laptop. using ubuntu 10.04. it has a subwoofer. how can i test if the subwoofer is working or not?
2011-04-20T22:33:00.000Z	theos		!subwoofer
2011-04-20T22:34:00.000Z	theos		i tried. 40-400hz. no sound :/
2011-04-20T22:34:00.000Z	theos		no sound through the woofer i mean
2011-04-20T22:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	did you try going to System -> Preferences -> Sound, and on the Hardware tab use the Test Speakers to see if it's detected?
2011-04-20T22:37:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	mine doesnt have an option "test speakers"
2011-04-20T22:38:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	sorry - on 10.10 here.  your version?
2011-04-20T22:41:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	ah.  if I select my webcam audio, I do not have the option to test speakers, so it might be hardware capability related.
2011-04-20T22:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	urr... scratch that.  webcam does not have speakers.  ignore me
2011-04-20T22:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	what if you go to the volume applet on the panel... does it have any options settings?
2011-04-20T22:45:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	nop. same thing opens
2011-04-20T22:46:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	I fear that the sub might be powered in software and that you might need some tweaking.  what does lspci show for the audio device?
2011-04-20T22:47:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	i have 2 audio devices. 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)
2011-04-20T22:47:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	and 01:00.1 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc RV710/730
2011-04-20T22:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	interesting.  I wonder which is which.  this is a laptop... what model?
2011-04-20T22:49:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	i currently use intel controller. it works well , just the woofer never works on ubuntu :/
2011-04-20T22:50:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	is there any slider anywhere for LFE output?
2011-04-20T22:51:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	nop. not in gui. i tried tweeking with cmd line though. but LFE channel doesnt sound
2011-04-21T18:05:00.000Z	mbeierl	theos	still no luck on the sub, eh?  I'm out of ideas, but thought I'd sympathize for a moment...
2011-04-21T18:06:00.000Z	theos	mbeierl	its almost 1 year now :( no luck
