2005-11-07T12:46:00.000Z	nemik		does ssh need to be configured or anything to log in? the 22 port works ok and asks for login but root and its pass won't work...
2005-11-07T12:48:00.000Z	nemik		severian, i did sudo passwd root and defined a root with which i'm logged in now
2005-11-07T12:48:00.000Z	nemik		i'm using the base install
2005-11-07T12:49:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	even if u changed the root passwd, ubuntu configured sshd NOT to accept direct root logins
2005-11-07T12:49:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	how can change that? in etc/ssh/sshd_config ?
2005-11-07T12:50:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	yes but that will definately defeat the purpose of having a secure configurations now would it :)
2005-11-07T12:51:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	i did make another username during the install, a non-root one but that isn't working either
2005-11-07T12:52:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	any chances that u forgot the password?
2005-11-07T12:52:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	then what was it that doest work? su ?
2005-11-07T12:53:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	logging in remotely to the box from putty in windows doesn't work
2005-11-07T12:55:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	u can connect via putty but u cant login ?
2005-11-07T12:55:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	exactly
2005-11-07T12:56:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	try changing the password at the box itself then try loggin via putty again
2005-11-07T12:56:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	i'll try it
2005-11-07T12:58:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	i just keep getting access denied, must be something in the config....
2005-11-07T12:59:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	you could check it if you think that could be the problem :D
2005-11-07T13:01:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	problem is i am behind a VOIP router and on a wifi access-point (well router with DHCP turned off) connected to the VOIP router
2005-11-07T13:01:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	that shouldnt be a problem coz u can connect to the box
2005-11-07T13:03:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	i'll pkill sshd and play with its config then start it again. but at least i know it is working
2005-11-07T13:06:00.000Z	nemik	aphesz	ok i was wrong....i stopped it, its not in ps -A and i got the login again...so i guess i was SSHing into something else...but what?
2005-11-07T13:07:00.000Z	aphesz	nemik	beats me.. sshd gone haywire for a while i guessd :p
