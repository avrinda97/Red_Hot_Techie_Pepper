2009-09-10T19:58:00.000Z	Ben64		Hello? Â¿Hola? Ni-Hao? Ohayo?....how can i stop certain things from starting up on boot-up?
2009-09-10T19:59:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	Session or system-wide starup items?
2009-09-10T19:59:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	they start before i get a login screen
2009-09-10T19:59:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	So system-wide rc
2009-09-10T19:59:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	sure, where do i find and disable them
2009-09-10T19:59:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	sysv-rc-conf, but be REALLY careful with that
2009-09-10T20:00:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	be careful when browsing and when switching windows(mouse can mess with the crosses)
2009-09-10T20:00:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	what crosses?
2009-09-10T20:01:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	You will see, runlevel configurations
2009-09-10T20:01:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	Just be really careful and only touch the programs you can be sure won't harm closing
2009-09-10T20:02:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	ooh its all text based
2009-09-10T20:02:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	THere is one
2009-09-10T20:03:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	nah its fine, i'm mostly a power user
2009-09-10T20:03:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	Well sysv-rc-conf is the right way
2009-09-10T20:04:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	looks like it, very nice
2009-09-10T20:05:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	hey, it's got the runlevels on the top.. 1-5,0,6 and S.. what's S?
2009-09-10T20:11:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	NOT!
2009-09-10T20:11:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	whaa?
2009-09-10T20:12:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	Me
2009-09-10T20:13:00.000Z	Lartza_	Ben64	My motehrboard had 2gb ram limitation so no use for 64
2009-09-10T20:13:00.000Z	Ben64	Lartza_	64bit does more than just give you access to ram
