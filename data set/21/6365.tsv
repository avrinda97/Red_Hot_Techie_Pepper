2008-01-24T13:19:00.000Z	stefano_		are there any usability people around here whom i can talk to?
2008-01-24T13:21:00.000Z	stefano_		so, noone here is into usability?
2008-01-24T13:21:00.000Z	Zorlin	stefano_	What do you mean?
2008-01-24T13:22:00.000Z	stefano_	Zorlin	well i'm a developer and i work on something, and now i have a hard time deciding how to implement one specific thing, and my solution really sounds bonkers so i thought i'd try to find someone maybe from the openusability project or someone who's into this topic
2008-01-24T13:23:00.000Z	stefano_		specifically about how to implement a more advanced Undo / Redo, because the one we're all used to really is terrible
2008-01-24T13:23:00.000Z	Zorlin		Stefano_: I'm pretty new at Linux, so I might not be the best candidate
2008-01-24T13:23:00.000Z	Zorlin		:P
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	stefano_	Zorlin	if you undo something, then type text, you can't redo. so your version you had a couple of seconds before undoing is lost
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	stefano_		thats what annoys me
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		hmmmm
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	stefano_		especially when programming/debugging
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		it'd probably be a bit annoying.
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	stefano_		yes i think so, but as i said it might not be as good as i think
2008-01-24T13:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		what was your solution? maybe just copy whatever you undid to the clipboard or something
2008-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	Zorlin		Or you could make a variable or at least the equivalent of a variable in whatever language you are using
2008-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	Zorlin		and then temporarily store the change you are undoing, and then have redo call it
2008-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	stefano_		here's my idea: if you undo, then type, then redo, your chanes get undone step by step until youre at the point before you typed in other text, from then on you have a normal redo, if you can understand that (as i said it sounds bonkers). do you think it would feel right?
2008-01-24T13:26:00.000Z	Zorlin		Stefano_: It might.
2008-01-24T13:26:00.000Z	Zorlin		Stefano_: But how about: Make undo store the changes in a variable, then have redo call it from the variable and then clear the variable.
2008-01-24T13:27:00.000Z	Zorlin		The variable is only used by undo/redo so chances are you won't have problems :P
2008-01-24T13:27:00.000Z	stefano_	Zorlin	i take a different approach on undo/redo, i want to save difference-information with every letter you type so that you can go back in time in your document up until the point it was created, even after saving
