2008-07-09T01:46:00.000Z	meteoroid		i'm having trouble getting daemontools to work on hardy, whether i follow straight djb instructions from source, or use the packages via a howto which says to point at debian etch for builder debs.. any pointers?
2008-07-09T01:46:00.000Z	meteoroid		the source install seems to work but init never starts svscan
2008-07-09T01:47:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	 and what is svscan - a service?
2008-07-09T01:48:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	'what is' ?
2008-07-09T01:48:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	oh, sorry, svscan is a process controller
2008-07-09T01:48:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	well, does /etc/init.d/*svscan* exist?
2008-07-09T01:48:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	it doesn't run that way, it appends to /etc/inittab
2008-07-09T01:51:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	well, you have a problem as ubuntu uses upstart instead of sysvinit now -- maybe you can write a wrapper around svscan to test whether it is running at regular intervals, if it isn't start it up again - to achieve the same effect
2008-07-09T01:51:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	that's not the same effect, that's not how svscan works.  it's a smaller program than bash, and designed to be reliable..
2008-07-09T01:51:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	what does svscan do?
2008-07-09T01:53:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	well, you don't have to get svscan to wait for a script to start it -- just use the script as a failsafe for when svscan fails
2008-07-20T23:37:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	 mono-1.0-devel
2008-07-20T23:37:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	courtesy packages.ubuntu.com
2008-07-20T23:37:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	thanks, i'll fish for myself next time ;)
2008-07-20T23:38:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	:)  or you can use dpkg -S filename at a terminal
2008-07-20T23:41:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	only for installed packages, yeah?
2008-07-20T23:41:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	mostly -- it sometimes works otherwise
2008-08-10T11:43:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	 sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow tzdata
2008-08-10T11:44:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	thanks
2008-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	unop	meteoroid	try this.   sudo update-grub
2008-08-25T05:33:00.000Z	meteoroid	unop	hm, odd, that throws an error itself.. i'm in a managed xen vm, so perhaps it doesn't use grub?
