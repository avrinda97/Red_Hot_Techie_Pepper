2008-03-30T23:42:00.000Z	destructar		hi all: just installed restricted drivers for nvidia on ubuntu 7.10 and restarted... go to restricted drivers panel and says driver is "not in use"... go to screen and graphics and sure enough: vesa generic is in use
2008-03-30T23:43:00.000Z	destructar		when I change this to nvidia and restart, changes don't take effect
2008-03-30T23:43:00.000Z	destructar		*sigh*... ok posting it again thanks to that:
2008-03-30T23:43:00.000Z	destructar		hi all: just installed restricted drivers for nvidia on ubuntu 7.10 and restarted... go to restricted drivers panel and says driver is "not in use"... go to screen and graphics and sure enough: vesa generic is in use
2008-03-30T23:44:00.000Z	destructar		so when i switch to nvidia via screen and graphics it won't save after restart
2008-03-30T23:44:00.000Z	destructar		instead it's putting me in low graphics mode because it can't detect that I'm running on a 1080p tv for whatever reason, most likely because of the vesa driver
2008-03-30T23:44:00.000Z	destructar		so any help on this would be cool
2008-03-30T23:45:00.000Z	Armada651	destructar	type in the terminal gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-03-30T23:45:00.000Z	Armada651		now look for Driver          "nv"
2008-03-30T23:45:00.000Z	Armada651		change nv to nvidia
2008-03-30T23:46:00.000Z	Armada651		and restart
2008-03-30T23:46:00.000Z	Armada651		then it should function
2008-03-30T23:46:00.000Z	destructar		armada651: already have "nvidia" as driver
2008-03-30T23:47:00.000Z	destructar		in same section "Device" however, it shows "vesa" as the boardname
2008-03-30T23:47:00.000Z	destructar		in the secod device section it does the same thing (i have 2 device sections for some reason)
2008-03-30T23:47:00.000Z	Armada651		did you already try to find your anwser here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2008-03-30T23:47:00.000Z	Armada651		?
2008-03-30T23:48:00.000Z	destructar	Armada651	trying to load that page now... lagging
2008-03-30T23:49:00.000Z	destructar	Armada651	can't load that page for some reason... so anyway, i guess the answer to your question is no
2008-03-30T23:51:00.000Z	destructar	Armada651	so i think my boardname is wrong... i was initially using a vesa driver... what should my boardname be set to for nvidia driver?
2008-03-30T23:51:00.000Z	Armada651	destructar	I think the boardname doesn't rly matter it functions fine without it
