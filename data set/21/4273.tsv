2010-05-08T22:19:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	fix, sorry
2010-05-08T22:15:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	ignore bad blocks how?
2010-05-08T22:16:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	I know there's a bad block check command for devices, can't think of the name now, it's in a few crypto howtos for how to erase drives
2010-05-08T22:16:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	badblocks I think it is ... dows that work with LVM?
2010-05-08T22:16:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	badblocks can scan a drive for bad blocks, but I don't really understand what it is you're trying to do.
2010-05-08T22:17:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	that, but the bad blocks are in an LVM volume ...
2010-05-08T22:17:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	yes, step back one step, and please descrive what it is you're trying to accomplish.
2010-05-08T22:18:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	when I fsck /dev/mapper/lvmgroup-home I get IO errors. I want to fiy that
2010-05-08T22:18:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	fiy?
2010-05-08T22:19:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	so is this actually bad blocks on the drive, and you just want to zero the bad blocks (rewrite them with zeroes) or what do you want to do with the bad information?
2010-05-08T22:19:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	I just want the drive to work... all the data is backed up.
2010-05-08T22:20:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	so what do you want to happen to the blocks that are bad?
2010-05-08T22:20:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	get the drive to not use them
2010-05-08T22:21:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	so you're ok with file system corruption if rewriting the bad data with zeroes?
2010-05-08T22:22:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	i don't care about the data on that partition, i just backed it up
2010-05-08T22:23:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	then you can just mkfs that partition and restore, then the blocks will be fine when data is written to them again (if the drive still has spare sectors to use instead of the bad ones)
2010-05-08T22:23:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	use smartctl (from smartmontools) to make sure you don't have too many reallocated sectors on the drive.
2010-05-08T22:27:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	running fsck now... what should I do with smarttools afterwards?
2010-05-08T22:27:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	smartctl -a /dev/<device> and then you need to read and understand what the drive is saying about re-allocated sectors.
2010-05-08T22:29:00.000Z	CQ	SwedeMike	the hard drive /dev/sda or the LVM partition /dev/mapper/lvmgroup-home?
2010-05-08T22:29:00.000Z	SwedeMike	CQ	sda
