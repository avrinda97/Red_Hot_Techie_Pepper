2012-04-28T23:27:00.000Z	grnt		Does anyone know why default ubuntu installation includes busybox? What's the point?
2012-04-28T23:28:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	in case of boot failures, the initrd starts BB to provide a minimal system. therefore BB is needed also everytime you update the kernel/initrd
2012-04-28T23:29:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	Thx! OerHeks: installed from Alternative CD. It came
2012-04-28T23:35:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	required by posix
2012-04-28T23:35:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	"required" in what way, standard?
2012-04-28T23:37:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	yes, POSIX is the most basic standard when it comes to Unix and Unix-like systems. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Operating_System_Interface
2012-04-28T23:40:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	now that you mentioned internets, does anyone know why "iinks" (console browser) displays all web pages in english? I mean it transliterates other language. Lynx doesn't exhibit same problem
2012-04-28T23:43:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	you mean links, right. can't confirm it. maybe you don't have locales set up correctly?
2012-04-28T23:45:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	you mean it doesn't transliterate on your end? try visisting some russian page, like, http://yandex.ru/
2012-04-28T23:46:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	i see it in russia
2012-04-28T23:48:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	do you know how to fix this locales issue? Provided I'm not currently in any GUI or X
2012-04-28T23:49:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	not sure if it's a locale issue. just tried in a plain text console (no x terminal emulator) and it still was russia. what ubuntu and links version do you use?
2012-04-28T23:50:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	freshly installed 12.04, apt-cache show links: 2.6-1
2012-04-28T23:51:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	sorry, don't know. still on 10.04, will clone it and update to 12.04 next week
2012-04-28T23:56:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	looks like I've found a solution. Character set had to be in UTF-8
2012-04-28T23:57:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	just curious. character set of what? terminal environment or links?
2012-04-28T23:59:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	Links. There's an option in menu (Setup -> Character set). I guess it means "default character set"
2012-04-29T00:24:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	never used one (got internet late in my life), but try alpine and search the package manager for others
2012-04-29T00:26:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	I already tried mutt. It's fine but I asked just in case. Thunderbird is way too bloated
2012-04-29T00:42:00.000Z	MirkoKa	grnt	regarding the copy/paste, try gpm (mouse in the console) or screen (allowes select/copy/paste in the console)
2012-04-29T00:43:00.000Z	grnt	MirkoKa	ok, I'll try
