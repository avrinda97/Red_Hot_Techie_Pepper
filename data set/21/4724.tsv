2008-06-09T06:16:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	what trouble
2008-06-09T06:19:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	i'm not sure, when does that happen after installation? or booting from livecd
2008-06-09T06:20:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	what system are you trying it on, what processor and ram?
2008-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	its the 128mb ram causing problems i suppose, ubuntu needs 384mb ram i think
2008-06-09T06:25:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	you can try using xubuntu
2008-06-09T22:28:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	I got that once, Try burning the dvd/cd at a slower speed
2008-06-09T22:28:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	I think something gets messed up burning at full speed
2008-06-09T22:28:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	also you can run the check cd before trying to install
2008-06-09T22:39:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	well done
2008-06-09T22:40:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	you're welcome
2008-06-09T22:41:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	this is xubuntu right?
2008-06-09T22:42:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	sorry, have you burnt the image to cd and installing from there?
2008-06-09T22:43:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	you are trying to install it from windows?
2008-06-09T22:45:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	ah okay, did you try do a check on the cd before trying to install, just to make sure it was okay
2008-06-09T22:45:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	it shouldn't
2008-06-09T22:48:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	ok so add grub to hard drive
2008-06-09T22:48:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	the default should be fine
2008-06-09T22:50:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	leave it to install grub gy default settings
2008-06-09T22:50:00.000Z	Rampage	xTOGx	yes install grub on there
