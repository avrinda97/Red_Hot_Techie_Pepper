2008-06-06T17:07:00.000Z	Rixon-		my login screen is 150% the size of my monitor, but i can't go to 'login screen' in control centre... the window appears and disappears within half a second, but the 'loading login screen' thing stays in the taskbar for about a minute
2008-06-06T17:07:00.000Z	Rixon-		anyone got any ideas?
2008-06-06T17:08:00.000Z	Rixon-		anyone?
2008-06-06T17:09:00.000Z	legend2440	Rixon-	can you paste your /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname files to pastebin?
2008-06-06T17:09:00.000Z	legend2440		!paste
2008-06-06T17:09:00.000Z	Rixon-		ok
2008-06-06T17:11:00.000Z	Rixon-	legend2440	why do you need those files? they have nothing to do with the login screen?
2008-06-06T17:12:00.000Z	Rixon-	legend2440	http://paste.ubuntu.com/17496/ why do you need that anyway? i can't see how hostname info could change the size of the login screen
2008-06-06T17:12:00.000Z	legend2440	Rixon-	they have something to do with why admin apps won't start up. does your update manager try to start and then stop also?
2008-06-06T17:12:00.000Z	Rixon-		no everything works
2008-06-06T17:12:00.000Z	Rixon-		except the login screen manager
2008-06-06T17:13:00.000Z	legend2440	Rixon-	ok sorry i misunderstood. i thought login was not starting up
2008-06-06T17:13:00.000Z	Rixon-		no the manager in control panel for the login screen wont start up
2008-06-06T17:14:00.000Z	Rixon-		so i cant figure out why my login screen is 150% of my monitor size
2008-06-06T17:14:00.000Z	Rixon-		it only happened since yesterday after i restarted after some updates
2008-06-06T17:14:00.000Z	legend2440	Rixon-	resolution for everything else is normal?
2008-06-06T17:14:00.000Z	Rixon-	legend2440	yes
2008-06-06T17:16:00.000Z	legend2440	Rixon-	is this similar to your problem?      http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=803741
