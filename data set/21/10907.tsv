2004-10-25T12:56:00.000Z	daniels		no, but if we're distributing a script whose sole purpose is to get these codecs and do nothing else (let alone with our installer ...), then that's still no good.
2004-10-25T12:57:00.000Z	daniels		hm, not seen that.  which CD are you using, the RC?
2004-10-25T12:57:00.000Z	daniels		we'd need the exact error to debug any further, I'm afraid.
2004-10-25T12:57:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	is this different from debian msttcorefonts, flash, real installers?
2004-10-25T12:58:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	yes, because they merely have a licence which states that we can't redistribute it; we're not violating anyone's patents by having people downloda it.
2004-10-25T12:58:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	you must download this from our website != you must not use this
2004-10-25T12:59:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	ok. mp3 is not real (pun accidental)
2004-10-25T13:00:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	we need something like plf is doing for mandrake
2004-10-25T13:04:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	right. copyleft is copyright, and a license is a license is a license. except some licenses are better than others :)
2004-11-05T15:25:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	oh, so they have upgraded from 2.2 already? =)
2004-11-11T06:55:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	not in the least.
2004-11-11T06:57:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	as I said before, all cards are fully supported with 2D, and the 3D support ranges up reasonably.
2004-11-11T06:58:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	you're right
2004-11-11T07:01:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	will moving to x.org be a disaster for those who track hoary?
2004-11-11T07:02:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	absolutely not.  if your configuration doesn't get migrated perfectly, or if there are any regressions, you get to report a bug
2004-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	i mean the transition from xfree to x.org -- is it very painful?
2004-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	if it is, you get to report a bug
2004-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	put it this way -- if my mum dist-upgrades to hoary, she shouldn't notice
2004-11-11T07:04:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	nicely put =)
2004-11-11T07:07:00.000Z	topyli	daniels	anyway, i'm already ready to congratulate everybody for such a small amount of hassle with these early days of hoary, which by all reason should have been a damn mess =)
2005-01-30T09:30:00.000Z	daniels	topyli	if you have ubuntu-desktop installed, xserver-xorg will be automatically installed
