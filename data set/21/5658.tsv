2007-09-24T13:53:00.000Z	naxa		how can I set auto-login in kubuntu?
2007-09-24T13:53:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	you should ask in #kubuntu ,they know where the dialog boxes are
2007-09-24T13:54:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	oh so this is specific! Thanks!
2007-12-12T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	there is achess prog in the game section there might be a way to get the other use remote on it,  you'd have to check,  I know there are some website for games like that where you can play online against an apponnet useing the browser, you'd have to google for it
2007-12-16T04:47:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	copy from cifs to your desktop then to the ntfs , see if that helps
2007-12-16T04:48:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	 I just think it mighht be a permission issue
2007-12-16T04:48:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	maybe... can i give read-write access to both to all, temporarly?
2007-12-16T04:48:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	I mean, is it possible? I don't know how could i, i'm a newbee
2007-12-16T04:49:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	for drives I think you need to change the owner , man chown for details
2007-12-16T04:49:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	yes i know but the problem is that there is no "nobody" owner as far as i know
2007-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	I 'm not all that great with permission stuff myself,   sudo chmod -r 777 /mountpoint  should give you full access to the dir , but not sure if that will work properly or solve your provlem
2007-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	if there are no owners then no one can have access, try setting one
2007-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	it should be setted in fstab i think, but i the owner is the same for both already
2007-12-16T04:52:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	can you copy anything to the ntfs drive ?
2007-12-16T04:52:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	ONLY locale chars give permission error
2007-12-16T04:53:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	hmmm,  and the drive is uft-8 enable, I beleive you said that already,  I have no idea this is above my skill level
2007-12-16T04:53:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	ok, this is above my knowledge, too...
2007-12-16T04:53:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	of course (:
2007-12-16T04:54:00.000Z	Pelo	naxa	maybe the ppl in ##linux
2007-12-16T04:54:00.000Z	naxa	Pelo	ok
