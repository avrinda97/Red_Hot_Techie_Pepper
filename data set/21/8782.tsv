2006-01-12T11:40:00.000Z	s_spiff		 how to install stuff on the pc?
2006-01-12T11:40:00.000Z	skon	s_spiff	what specifically
2006-01-12T11:41:00.000Z	s_spiff		as in i download a package , like opera, or firefox 1.5
2006-01-12T11:41:00.000Z	s_spiff		yeah, but synaptic doesn't always have what I want
2006-01-12T11:41:00.000Z	s_spiff		 eg : FF1.5
2006-01-12T11:41:00.000Z	skon	s_spiff	download it from the FF site then
2006-01-12T11:41:00.000Z	s_spiff		i already installed it
2006-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	s_spiff		 by using the commands given in wiki
2006-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	s_spiff		 but wiki doesn't have the solution to all the programs..
2006-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	s_spiff		 so wanted a basic idea as to how to do it?
2006-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	skon	s_spiff	most of the programs you'll want to install will either have documentation or are avaiable through synatpic
2006-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	s_spiff	skon	ok will check it out.
