2005-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	sebby	right click on the icon thing on your toolbar, select "Preferences"
2005-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	sebby	the 2nd tab is "Location" - it looks like there's about 15 locations in Queensland for you
2005-06-13T15:11:00.000Z	sebby		yay, it works
2005-06-13T15:11:00.000Z	sebby		thanks Madpilot
2005-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	sebby	no prob. I like the gnome weather thing... never used any of the Windows weather thingies because they all seemed to be just spyware vehicles...
2005-06-13T15:13:00.000Z	sebby	Madpilot	yeah, which is why i suddenly went "oh, a probably-real weather thingy, yay!"
2005-06-13T15:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	sebby	heh, me too. my grandfather installed some weather thing on his Win98 machine, took me forever to get rid of the d*mn sypware that came with :(
2005-06-13T15:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	sebby	install "Fish" as well, trust me. It will give your day a needed dose of harmless wierdness!
