2008-06-30T23:54:00.000Z	asmo[B]		Does the "Remote Desktop Server" that comes with Ubuntu work with the Remote Desktop Client that comes with windowsXP?
2008-06-30T23:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	You can use apt-get install tsclient to connect to other Windows RDP servers, but that might be the reverse of what you want
2008-06-30T23:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Although if you want to go the other way, I find VNC to be very unnecessary, all you need to go the other way is ssh -CX
2008-06-30T23:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Are you sure you need VNC? I used to have a VNC server setup on my home machine, but honestly ssh -CX seems to do everything I need it to
2008-07-01T00:00:00.000Z	asmo[B]	ASULutzy	when I do ssh -CX nothing happens... gives me a list of ssh commands
2008-07-01T00:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	You need to install an ssh server on the server machine. Then from the client you would do ssh -CX the.ip.address.ofserver
2008-07-01T00:01:00.000Z	asmo[B]	ASULutzy	I tried setting up this; https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH
2008-07-01T00:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	I see what you tried to do, let me ask you this, are you connecting from an ubuntu machine to another ubuntu machine, or ubuntu to windows, or windows to ubuntu
2008-07-01T00:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	If you are doing windows to ubuntu I would recommend just setting up an ssh server on the ubuntu machine. And I think you can use ssh -CX to forward the output of whatever app y ou want
2008-07-01T00:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	On the ubuntu machine, ps aux | grep ssh
2008-07-01T00:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	You didn't setup the server correctly :)
2008-07-01T00:05:00.000Z	asmo[B]	ASULutzy	that's what I'm assuming, must have missed something somewhere
2008-07-01T00:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Could be a lack of port forwarding on the router, who knows
2008-07-01T00:05:00.000Z	asmo[B]	ASULutzy	DMZ is set for both machines
2008-07-01T00:06:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Then that's not possible?
2008-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	asmo[B]	ASULutzy	the firmware for my router allows for dual DMZ
2008-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	DMZ means, hey, all traffic that isn't set to go to a specific machine go here. You can't have 2 machines setup to do that?
2008-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Well, I wouldn't actually do it, because conceptually that makes zero sense to me :)
2008-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	asmo[B]	ASULutzy	ah well, have to eat, then time to mess around again, back in a bit, thanks for your help
2008-07-02T00:08:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Port forwarding
2008-07-02T00:09:00.000Z	ASULutzy	asmo[B]	Your router doesn't know where to send the traffic, you need to tell it
