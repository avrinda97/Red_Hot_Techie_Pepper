2006-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	VladimirBG		one more question, when I started live ubuntu, it was working great, but the installed version keps giving me trouble, like refusing to open networking, and similar services, and neither one can see my win partition? with mandriva I could do that, and in knoppix too...
2006-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	VladimirBG		what could be wrong?
2006-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	VladimirBG		I have serious issues with 5.10! when running live CD everything is ok, but when I install it half the things don't work! for example, I go to system-> administration -> networking and it starts to load and just dissapears! and that's not the only thing that fails!
2006-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	VladimirBG		and I can't read NTFS disks!
2006-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	one thing at a time, did you do an expert install?
2006-03-23T09:00:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	and everything looked ok
2006-03-23T09:00:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	ok, just to check.  what does 'sudo echo hi' do in applications menu > accessories > terminal
2006-03-23T09:01:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	I installed it from the install disk
2006-03-23T09:02:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	you lost me
2006-03-23T09:03:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	 I'm using live cd now, and all things work, earlyer today I installed 5.10 from installation CD, it booted up, and when I tryed to run half the things, the aplications just stalled!
2006-03-23T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	go to your install and come here again :)
2006-03-23T09:04:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	the same thing happend with 5.04
2006-03-23T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	it's known to happen with expert installs, we can fix it
2006-03-23T09:05:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	and when I run install cd, I can't configure my modem
2006-03-23T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	one problem at a time, let's fix the gui admin apps first
2006-03-23T09:07:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	that's the problem, I can't come here with install CD, so if you can tell me what to do, I'll try it offline
2006-03-23T09:07:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	oh right... didn't click in my head :)  Sorry.  Do you know what 'su to root' means?
2006-03-23T09:08:00.000Z	VladimirBG	_jason	yes
2006-03-23T09:08:00.000Z	_jason	VladimirBG	ok su to root in console and then follow ubotu's instructions
