2010-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	you should have really split your filesystem across partitions before you installed.
2010-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	What do you mean?
2010-11-07T08:54:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	i typically mount the /home directory on its own partition... wichi means any future clean installs i simply specify in the installer that it should use the home folder already at that partition
2010-11-07T08:55:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	but it's something you need to prepare for before installing
2010-11-07T08:55:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	Ah I see. But what of /var/www? and other such folders.
2010-11-07T08:56:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	on my webservers i mount /var on a very large partition too
2010-11-07T08:56:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	you're not going to get that without alot of effort
2010-11-07T08:56:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	Well going forward that is certainly something to consider.
2010-11-07T08:57:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	Really? I only intend to do this once
2010-11-07T08:57:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	unless of course you simply use clonezilla
2010-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	What's that?
2010-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	clonezilla is the opensource alternative to nortons ghost
2010-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	Oh I used that recently. It worked excellently.
2010-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	if you upgrade you wont't be able to rollback
2010-11-07T08:59:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	Unless I use clonezilla?
2010-11-07T09:00:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	well yes creating a snapshot of a device or partition gives you that final garuntee
2010-11-07T09:01:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	if you are thinking about moving to maverick you need to ask yourself do you need it for vanity or practical requirements for the webserver (also remember the mantra about early adpoters )
2010-11-07T09:02:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	And that's the very reason I'm keeping myself back. I just thought that as someone who is actively using quickly and stuff to develop applications for Ubuntu (as a fledgling developer) that I would benefit from using the latest-and-greatest.
2010-11-07T09:02:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	vanity sake.. I already use the font and themes :)
2010-11-07T09:02:00.000Z	airtonix	avo	for that i recommend simply using virtualbox to run the bleedingedge
2010-11-07T09:03:00.000Z	avo	airtonix	Right. I use virtualbox a lot.
