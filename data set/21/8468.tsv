2006-05-27T06:56:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Arrick	I am on the actual time now.  I just set up this computer and the clock was a day behind, so I fixed it.  Now sudo won't work.
2006-05-27T06:56:00.000Z	Arrick		put it back its wanting the ubuntu server
2006-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	Arrick		you gotta set the correct timezone in order to switch the time
2006-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Arrick	So you're saying that in order to use sudo I have to have the wrong time on my computer?  That's insane.
2006-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	Arrick		no
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	Arrick	ficusplanet	you need to put the time back, then set the correct timezone for the system, and it will correct the time for you
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Arrick	The timezone is already correct.
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	Arrick		then how was the thing a day behind?
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Arrick	I have no idea.  That was just the time that was there after setup.
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	Arrick		ok, did it ask you for your timezone when you installed?
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Arrick	Yes, and it is set correctly: America/Chicago.
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	Arrick		ew
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	Arrick		ok
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	Arrick		help on this one guys
2006-05-27T07:00:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Arrick	If I wait until tomorrow, will it stop complaining about the time difference maybe?
