2010-05-02T17:08:00.000Z	dockimble		lucid will not upgrade and it keeps telling me about a dependency issue but refuses to fix it
2010-05-02T17:08:00.000Z	dockimble		with muscore
2010-05-02T17:09:00.000Z	dockimble		and it won't let me remove it
2010-05-02T17:09:00.000Z	dockimble		what can i do
2010-05-02T17:10:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	post the exact output of the error somwhere, and include that here
2010-05-02T17:17:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	well, the error message there seems to tell you the problem. Delete that file, and you might be off to the races.
2010-05-02T17:17:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	well, move it instead.
2010-05-02T17:19:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	soething like sudo mv /usr/share/mscore-0.9/templates/instruments_de.xml /home/your_user
2010-05-02T17:19:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	then try again
2010-05-02T17:22:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	show me a new paste. and also the output of ls /usr/share/mscore-0.9/templates/
2010-05-02T17:26:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	well, your computer is either lying, or you did things in the wrong order. Somehow apt thinks the file you moved is still in the same place
2010-05-02T17:27:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	it's not there. try the apt thing again
2010-05-02T17:28:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	ya, it should at least complain about a different thing.
2010-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	_de?
2010-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	the error is: trying to overwrite '/usr/share/mscore-0.9/templates/instruments_de.xml', which is also in package mscore-common 0:0.9.4+dfsg-1
2010-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	so we moved the file, is it still complaining about the same file?
2010-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	well, you would probably do sudo aptitude remove mscore-common
2010-05-02T17:31:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	same error?
2010-05-02T17:33:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	does it let you sudo aptitude remove musescore?
2010-05-02T17:37:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	ha. worked?
2010-05-02T17:38:00.000Z	dabaR	dockimble	sweet.
