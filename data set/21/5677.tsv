2007-09-01T12:30:00.000Z	rgr		how does one find where apt-egt source installed the source files?
2007-09-01T12:31:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	current working directory
2007-09-01T12:32:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	the one I just said?
2007-09-01T12:34:00.000Z	rgr	jrib	doh. thanks.
2007-09-01T12:34:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	np
2009-11-11T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	8.04 -> 8.10 -> 9.04 -> 9.10
2009-11-11T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	see the server instructions on that page
2009-11-11T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	try a live cd first so you don't waste your tiem
2009-11-11T23:53:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	you probably ran update-manager with some sort of devel switch?
2011-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	it's true
2011-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	rgr	jrib	not according to jus about every google I have done. Wishful thinking.
2011-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	flash works as fine for me as it does on 32bit or on windows.  I don't know...
2011-04-28T16:44:00.000Z	rgr	jrib	works for you. ok. Well the facts are that it doesnt for many others. And to say otherwise is misleading and dishonest.
2011-04-28T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	I don't believe that's the fact.  Flash can be installed and works as fine as flash generally works (hogs cpu, etc)
2011-04-28T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	which part is nonsense?
2011-04-28T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	well maybe you misinterpret what I mean by fine.  By "fine" I mean it is usable.
2011-04-28T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	for everyone.
2011-04-28T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	point me to a bug
2011-04-28T16:47:00.000Z	rgr	jrib	are you being serious? Even people in this irc channel have reported issues. 2 fps is NOT "running fine".
2011-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	you select "classic desktop" at the login screen to turn it off
2011-04-28T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	rgr	this channel is meant for ubuntu *support*, #ubuntu-offtopic is a good place to discuss unity
