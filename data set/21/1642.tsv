2011-09-17T18:54:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	Can you repeat the question? I joined ~20 minutes ago and can't see it.
2011-09-17T18:57:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	Ah, yes. Wine keeps evolving, making more and more windows programs runnable, but in the process, other programs stop working.
2011-09-17T18:57:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	What's the appdb rating of those programs?
2011-09-17T18:58:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	I found some articles that said to delete a certain DX9 file, but I don't have it.  Starcraft 2 is where my problems started.  I think it's rated gold or plat, I forget which.
2011-09-17T18:58:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	After encountering an error in SCII I started getting the same error everywhere else.
2011-09-17T18:59:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	Ah. Have you tried grabbing wine from winehq's repositories instead of Ubuntu's?
2011-09-17T18:59:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	what's the repository? should I completely uninstall, then reinstall?
2011-09-17T19:00:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	No, though if SC2 triggered it, maybe it removed a file it shouldn't or something like that. You could try installing one of the windows programs that suddenly started failing in a separate wineprefix and see if that works.
2011-09-17T19:01:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	I don't know what that "executable bit" stuff is
2011-09-17T19:01:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	speaking greek, man.  I'm trying to run a .exe that doesn't even require installation
2011-09-17T19:02:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	when you click an .exe file ubuntu slaps you with an executable bit error, like windows saying that mother knows best, don't run exe files
2011-09-17T19:03:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	Ok, for testing, open a terminal and run  mkdir /tmp/wine; export WINEPREFIX=/tmp/wine/test; wine /path/to/file.exe
2011-09-17T19:03:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	It's important that you run wine from that same terminal, not from the file browser or anything.
2011-09-17T19:04:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	i still get the error
2011-09-17T19:05:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	want me to pastebin
2011-09-17T19:05:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	No, the technical stuff in the error message will tell me nothing. Need to be a wine developer to parse that.
2011-09-17T19:06:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	so should I put this up on #winehq
2011-09-17T19:07:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	With patience, someone might.
2011-09-17T19:09:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	Since it still didn't work with a fresh wineprefix, I don't think SC2 had anything to do with it.
2011-09-17T19:09:00.000Z	bagels	geirha	I'm thinking it doesn't, either, every program I try fails.  SCII didn't even finish installing, I got the same error
2011-09-17T19:10:00.000Z	geirha	bagels	Then perhaps the "executable bit" hack you were talking about could've triggered it?
