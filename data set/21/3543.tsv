2009-03-31T00:37:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	tar -zxvf /home/UserName/Desktop/NameOfFile.tar.gz
2009-03-31T00:38:00.000Z	purvesh	Joker_-_	i'll try now
2009-03-31T00:47:00.000Z	purvesh	Joker_-_	i think vlc is only extracted at my home directory
2009-03-31T00:47:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	I dont quite understand what you mean
2009-03-31T00:48:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	why do you go the hard route anyway? you could install vlc simply by typing: "sudo apt-get install vlc"
2009-03-31T00:54:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	again, you'll get it by doing an update (sudo apt-get update) then installing it (sudo apt-get install emacs) if the package is named anything else than emacs, try to learn to use the search function (apt-cache search something). You can also join a "| grep somethingelse" to narrow your selection as in: "apt-cache search something | grep somethingelse"
2009-03-31T00:54:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	then, use sudo apt-get install NameOfPackage
2009-03-31T00:58:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	I dont understand your question. I dont know much about emacs but the package is available trough aptitude (apt-get)... you might wanna be more specific in your question?
2009-03-31T01:00:00.000Z	Joker_-_	purvesh	np!
