2005-07-30T12:28:00.000Z	chakri		ok sorry
2005-07-30T12:28:00.000Z	raven3x7	chakri	use mplayer-386 or 586

2005-07-30T12:30:00.000Z	chakri		i want to install mplayer and it is giving abover error when i used the command "sudo apt-get intall mplayer"
2005-07-30T12:31:00.000Z	raven3x7	chakri	that because you should use sudo apt-get install mplayer-386 or -586
2005-07-30T12:32:00.000Z	chakri		thank you it worked
2005-07-30T12:32:00.000Z	raven3x7		my typing sucks these days
2005-07-30T12:33:00.000Z	raven3x7	chakri	cool. you need to read more carefully what error messages you are getting though. apt already had given you the answer
2005-07-30T12:35:00.000Z	chakri	raven3x7	actually i am new to ubuntu. I use fedoracore and there every thing is through downloading and installing rpms
2005-07-30T12:36:00.000Z	raven3x7	chakri	apt is more reliable really i used fedora myself then got tired of it constantly breaking
