2010-09-24T01:28:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		I'm having trouble typing typing the command right, jrib
2010-09-24T01:28:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	what are you trying?
2010-09-24T01:28:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		trying to locate all MP3 files on the ntfs drive
2010-09-24T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	right.  You said you were having trouble typing the command.  What did you try exactly?
2010-09-24T01:29:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		I did 'grep mp3' just like you told me
2010-09-24T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	no I didn't :/
2010-09-24T01:30:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	why don't you just use the gui?
2010-09-24T01:30:00.000Z	jrib		!runlevel | alaing
2010-09-24T01:30:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		i don't know where the files are located
2010-09-24T01:30:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	umm, you can search with nautilus, can't you?
2010-09-24T01:31:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		someone a year or so ago had me do a grep something something on my own computer and i found all the files with that command
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	yeah, I can tell you the command, but what's the point?  You're going to come to an irc channel every time you need to search your computer?  Just use the gui
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		so, find *.mp3
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	^Phantom5^	jrib	no i'm not
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		I haven't used ubuntu for over a year and can't remember the commands
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	if you want to use the command line, then you need invest time to learn to use it, not just guess at things
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		is that a fucking crime?
2010-09-24T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	please watch the language here
2010-09-24T01:33:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		so wait a second
2010-09-24T01:33:00.000Z	^Phantom5^		if i type *.mp3 in the search bar, it will find all mp3 files?
2010-09-24T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	^Phantom5^	my guess is you would search for ".mp3" in nautilus
