2005-04-25T10:44:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	Argh, this is really annoying!
2005-04-25T10:35:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	so what is wrong with teamspeak?
2005-04-25T10:35:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	It will not start when I run "TeamSpeak".
2005-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	works ok for me
2005-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	don't know what to connect to, but it runs
2005-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	All I did was extract it, run the installer, and then I try to execute "TeamSpeak", and it's running as a process, but it doesn't come up.
2005-04-25T10:37:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	have you tried "mv ~/.teamspeak2 ~/.teamspeak2-old
2005-04-25T10:37:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	What would that do?
2005-04-25T10:38:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	you might have to do the same with ~/.tsclient
2005-04-25T10:38:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	Hold on, I'll boot Ubuntu, BRB.
2005-04-25T10:38:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	it would clear your old configuration
2005-04-25T10:40:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	I am back.
2005-04-25T10:41:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	I run ./TeamSpeak and it just sits there doing nothing!
2005-04-25T10:41:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	did you try what i suggested?
2005-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	Yes.
2005-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	I'll check the log.
2005-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	No errors at all in the log.
2005-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	TeamSpeak just doesn't come up. What the hell is going on?!
2005-04-25T10:45:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	Q: I have something to say to the TeamSpeak team
2005-04-25T10:47:00.000Z	D_F	pestilence	Waiting for an answer now :)
2005-04-25T10:48:00.000Z	pestilence	D_F	good luck with that :)
