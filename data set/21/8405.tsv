2006-04-29T08:12:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	now i'm back on the other x after logging out of the other
2006-04-29T08:13:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	but how do i set it so i can switch with the ctrl #'s
2006-04-29T08:13:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	cool - strange that you couldn't switch VTs
2006-04-29T08:31:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	what card?
2006-04-29T08:31:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	x700 a previous guide had me add fglrx to disabled modules, is this the problem ?
2006-04-29T08:32:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	i want to use the ATI provided drivers
2006-04-29T08:32:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	I don't know about fglrx, my old card is supported by the xorg driver
2006-04-29T08:32:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	i need direct rendering
2006-04-29T08:32:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	the ati driver  = fglrx right ?
2006-04-29T08:32:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	I have direct rendering with the free driver here
2006-04-29T08:32:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	which one
2006-04-29T08:33:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	yes, fglrx is the proprietary ati driver I believe
2006-04-29T08:33:00.000Z	Apostle^	amphi	so then i need to remove fglrx from restricted modules yes?
2006-04-29T08:33:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	it's an old card
2006-04-29T08:33:00.000Z	amphi	Apostle^	no idea about fglrx I'm afraid
