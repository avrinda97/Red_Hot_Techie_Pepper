2007-07-28T11:31:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	http://blaise.ca/blog/?p=14 thats the one that my brother wrote, that is basically everything that I did to get mine working
2007-07-28T11:32:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	one thing about it though, with those xorg fixes there, my brother included my little description of what I did on each, if you decide to use that erase anything beside an arrow

2007-07-28T11:33:00.000Z	azi	d4rkmonkey	i hope it'll help
2007-07-28T11:33:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	 no problem, I hear its much better in Gutsy, theres still some problems with feisty, but I'm gonna wait for the full Gutsy release
2007-07-28T11:49:00.000Z	azi	d4rkmonkey	hm.. do I really have to download the alternate cd?
2007-07-28T11:49:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	yeah..
2007-07-28T11:49:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	its not that hard to use or anything though
2007-07-28T11:50:00.000Z	azi	d4rkmonkey	what were you talking about gutsy? if i download gutsy i'll autmoatically get gpu support?
2007-07-28T11:50:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	no, not yet
2007-07-28T11:50:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	I've been trying the early releases and they haven't had full support yet
2007-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	azi	d4rkmonkey	the problem is i'll have to download the whole 600mb iso which takes about ~2 hours
2007-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	azi	I haven't really tried the tribe 3 CD yet though.. but it doesn't matter you would need to download a new CD anyways
