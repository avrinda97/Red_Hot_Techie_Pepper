2009-05-25T00:49:00.000Z	lacrymology		excuse me, I'm trying to umount a hard drive and umount complains that it's busy. How can I find out what's blocking it?
2009-05-25T00:50:00.000Z	lacrymology		thanks
2009-05-25T00:51:00.000Z	geirha	lacrymology	fuser -c /mount/point
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology		fuser returns nothing
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology		and umount still complains
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology		lacrymology@tomas-laptop:~$ fuser -c /media/RODIMUS/
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology		lacrymology@tomas-laptop:~$ sudo umount /media/RODIMUS/
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology		umount: /media/RODIMUS: device is busy
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology		umount: /media/RODIMUS: device is busy
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	geirha	lacrymology	did you try with the -c option? fuser -c /mount/point
2009-05-25T00:53:00.000Z	lacrymology	geirha	yes I did
2009-05-25T00:54:00.000Z	geirha	lacrymology	Try with sudo
2009-05-25T00:54:00.000Z	lacrymology	geirha	same result
2009-05-25T00:55:00.000Z	geirha	lacrymology	Hm. That's odd.
2009-05-25T00:56:00.000Z	lacrymology	geirha	it's an ntfs if that helps at all
2009-05-25T00:56:00.000Z	lacrymology	geirha	there's ntfs-3g running somewhere there
2009-05-25T00:57:00.000Z	lacrymology		oh well
2009-05-25T00:57:00.000Z	lacrymology		I'm gonna just power down
2009-05-25T00:57:00.000Z	lacrymology		I need to anyways
2009-05-25T00:57:00.000Z	geirha	lacrymology	Might be fuser doesn't work properly with NTFS. Do you have any terminal windows open where you've cd'ed into that filesystem?
2009-05-25T00:57:00.000Z	lacrymology	geirha	no, not at all but it doesn't matter
