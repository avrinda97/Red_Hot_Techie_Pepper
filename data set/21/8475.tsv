2008-12-09T07:11:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	what is your wireless card?
2008-12-09T07:11:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	it does have a brand even if it's integrated
2008-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	if it's ar2425 one of i'm using it works fine with ath5k drivers
2008-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	and also ubuntu recognizes it well(intrepid)
2008-12-09T07:13:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	yes, go to device manager and look at network adapters. but even more easier way is checking your lspci output
2008-12-09T07:14:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	are you seeing what is your wireless card at the output?
2008-12-09T07:15:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	one step is left :) try google: bcm4310 ubuntu hardy
2008-12-09T07:17:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	try searching upgrading to intrepid.
2008-12-09T07:20:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	intrepid is really good at hardware compability. i currently have 2 laptops and one macbook pro santa rosa running it without any problem and out of the box
2008-12-09T07:21:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	doesn't it have a ethernet ?
2008-12-09T07:30:00.000Z	nick|here	svchost	on vista?
