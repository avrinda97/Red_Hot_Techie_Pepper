2009-11-19T23:54:00.000Z	Dakara		Hello, I am running into an error when I trt installing Ubuntu after the reboot. It gives me an option of choosing the boot I want, and then it goes into installing. Now this is where it goes wrong. It always comes up Video Mode not avaible. I have tried removing quiet and splash from the command line but still nothing. And whenever I click ctl alt f1, an error appears and won't let me enter any sudo commands. Could someone here help me
