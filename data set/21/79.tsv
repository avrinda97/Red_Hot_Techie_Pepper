2012-11-03T06:42:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	what wifi card do you have?
2012-11-03T06:42:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	BCM43225
2012-11-03T06:43:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43225 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4357] (rev 01)
2012-11-03T06:44:00.000Z	rickbol		I just git a bcm4322, but I haven't tried it yet. It is replacing a bcm4311 (in a Dell D630) which suffered some of the symptoms you describe under heavy load.
2012-11-03T06:45:00.000Z	rickbol		I also tried an intel 4965, but it suffered regression bugs as well.
2012-11-03T06:47:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	the bcm4311 failed under heavy load (I'm currently typing using it now). I have an HP Mini that had a bcm4322, and it seems to work fine, so I thought I'd try one of those in this Dell D630
2012-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	well i don't have problems when connected... only like this.. I download large files with constant speed of 20Mbit/s over night and no problem at all. Just like this... can't find my network .. and this time i can't really fix it. The only solution to me it seems is to boot into windows :(
2012-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	deemeetar		And the sad part is i need internet for studying cause my midterm is tomorrow and i spent 3 hours trying to connect :9
2012-11-03T06:51:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	I'm no expert in wifi\AP negotiation etc, but i fairly decent amount is probably logged in dmesg
2012-11-03T06:54:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	How can i see messages relative to my networking with dmesg?
2012-11-03T06:57:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	 try "sudo dmesg | grep wlan"  and "sudo dmesg | grep b43"
2012-11-03T06:58:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	correction, you're running the proprietary broadcom drivers, so maybe it is "sudo dmesg | grep STA"?
2012-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	... nothing relevant there : Tried 43, STA, eth1 :(
2012-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	deemeetar		there is text but nothing that looks unordinary
2012-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	try wlan
2012-11-03T07:00:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	Nothing
2012-11-03T07:04:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	what, if anything, is returned for: "lsmod | grep mac802"
2012-11-03T07:06:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	Nothing is retturned.
2012-11-03T07:06:00.000Z	rickbol	deemeetar	 what OS are you running?
2012-11-03T07:07:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	elementary os luna ... which is based of ubuntu 12.04(basicaly reskinned ubuntu)
2012-11-03T07:07:00.000Z	deemeetar	rickbol	but had the same problem on ubuntu 12.04 11.10 11.04
