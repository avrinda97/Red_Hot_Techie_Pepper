2006-08-11T08:18:00.000Z	akutz		you're welcome
2006-08-11T08:18:00.000Z	akutz		Does anyone know how to rsync down the ubuntu repos?
2006-08-11T08:19:00.000Z	akutz		> i heard sha1 was cracked: no
2006-08-11T08:20:00.000Z	visik7	akutz	you can't
2006-08-11T08:20:00.000Z	akutz		sha-1 was found to have a possible collision in 1 in 400 million as opposed to 1 in 2 billion
2006-08-11T08:20:00.000Z	akutz		so for crypto geeks, yes
2006-08-11T08:20:00.000Z	akutz		but for your use, no
2006-08-11T08:20:00.000Z	visik7	akutz	apt isn't compiled with rsync support by default you can try to rebuild your apt enabling rsync (if it possible)
2006-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	akutz		visik: that is not what I want to do
2006-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	akutz	visik7	I want to set up a local apt repo that mirrors the ubuntu repo for my private servers
2006-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	visik7	akutz	so use apt-proxy
2006-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	akutz		never heard of it
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	akutz		will look into it
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	akutz		thanks
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	visik7	akutz	it download packages as soon as a client require it
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	visik7	akutz	and cache it
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	visik7	akutz	for other machines
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	akutz		nice
2006-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	akutz		a sf proj too
