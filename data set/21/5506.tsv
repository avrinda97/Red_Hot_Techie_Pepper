2007-10-01T07:01:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	what's gui?... i'll bet that question betrays my newbicity
2007-10-01T07:00:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	Your audio setting are on in the gui? that is no little red crosses??
2007-10-01T07:02:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	graphic user interface the windows like thing. click system/preference/sounds and nosy around in there for a bit
2007-10-01T07:08:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	right click on the speaker symbol and see if there are any red crosses
2007-10-01T07:09:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	no red crosses... just looks like a regular menu to me
2007-10-01T07:10:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	I meant to open volume control after you right click now look for crosses
2007-10-01T07:11:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	nope... looks like a regular mixer... i can make red crosses, and unmake redcrosses, but their were none when i first opened it up
2007-10-01T07:12:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	Sorry it is too clever for me then, it is bizarre that the live cd works so I am sure it is a setting
2007-10-01T07:13:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	The slider on the mixer were up yes
2007-10-01T07:13:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	i'm guessing it must have been from one of the updates from when i reinstalled ubuntu, so if i could just get it back to how it was before the updates i think i'd be fine, but i'd rather not have to reinstall again... yeah the sliders were at the tippy top
2007-10-01T07:15:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	which version of ubuntu are you using
2007-10-01T07:17:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	feisty fawn
2007-10-01T07:17:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	and i have a gateway laptop... amd64
2007-10-01T07:18:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	Should be fine. Try to get some one else to have a look in a while
2007-10-01T07:19:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	Oh the amd 64 might be an issue did you do the amd 64 iso??
2007-10-01T07:19:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	yes i did... is that a problem?
2007-10-01T07:20:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	by the way, i just installed every update that the update manager presented to me... should i maybe have not used some of them?
2007-10-01T07:21:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	My first amd install was so bad that I canned it and reinstalled the 32bit system/ I think the updates are ok
2007-10-01T07:22:00.000Z	problemswithubun	jxxxt	hmm... well what's the difference between a 32 and 64 bit system?
2007-10-01T07:22:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	Maybe you should have a look on ubuntu forums they have a amd64 forum
2007-10-01T07:22:00.000Z	jxxxt	problemswithubun	The 32/64bit answer is too complex for me
