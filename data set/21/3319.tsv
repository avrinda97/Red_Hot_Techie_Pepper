2009-01-27T23:26:00.000Z	razor2006		Titan8890: What commmands do I need to run to uninstall/reinstall ALSA from my Ubuntu CD?
2009-01-27T23:26:00.000Z	razor2006		Or anyone else who may know, what commands do I need to run to uninstall/reinstall ALSA from my Ubuntu CD?
2009-01-27T23:26:00.000Z	razor2006		After its mounted and what not obviously :)
2009-01-27T23:27:00.000Z	Rebootia	razor2006	try to get it from terminal
2009-01-27T23:28:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	Well the thing is, my internet connection is dial-up, so the 18MB download will take forever.
2009-01-27T23:28:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	It'd be much easier to reinstall from disc if I could, but I don't know the necessary commands
2009-01-27T23:31:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	It's trying to download it :(
2009-01-27T23:31:00.000Z	Rebootia	razor2006	it doesnt download it at all ?
2009-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	It begins to but the problem is on my connection it would literally take me 24 hours to download the package
2009-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	Rebootia	razor2006	then download it from somewhere else
2009-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	Therefore I'd be best off to reinstall from my Ubuntu CD, which I have here, I just need to know how to.
2009-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	Rebootia	razor2006	then just run the setup from the cd
2009-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	That's not going to help, I'm using dialup w/ ALSA's drivers so my speeds are literally like 1kb/s
2009-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	I know, I can't afford it at the moment.
2009-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	Today's been rough, I just wanna enjoy some music but I'm not having any luck
2009-01-27T23:34:00.000Z	Rebootia	razor2006	i can believe so
2009-01-27T23:34:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	I don't know how to reinstall from cd-rom, and it's frustrating me incredibly
2009-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	Do you know what commands I need to run in order to reinstall from CD?
2009-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	Rebootia	razor2006	nope
2009-01-27T23:36:00.000Z	razor2006	Rebootia	Thanks anyway.
