2008-04-03T18:49:00.000Z	marx2k		are we able to interface with the Zune mp3 player yet?
2008-04-03T18:50:00.000Z	marx2k		So... is that a yes?
2008-04-03T18:50:00.000Z	marx2k		!zune
2008-04-03T18:50:00.000Z	marx2k		:(
2008-04-03T18:51:00.000Z	marx2k		I dont want an iPod and it seems Zune is the best bang for the buck, but as expected from MS, it has (or had issues) with liunx
2008-04-03T18:52:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	there are quite some other ones
2008-04-03T18:52:00.000Z	marx2k	Exteris	I dunno..the Zune has some large storage capacity and is at a good price point.. can you name some others?
2008-04-03T18:53:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	i'll search, there was one that looked promised
2008-04-03T18:54:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SanDisk_Sansa
2008-04-03T18:55:00.000Z	marx2k	Exteris	the problem with those is the small storage capacities

2008-04-03T18:56:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	i use a zen stone here, i don't need a display, and it works well (fat)
2008-04-03T18:57:00.000Z	marx2k	Exteris	Whats the storage capacity on that?
2008-04-03T18:57:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	1gb on the simple version without display (40 euro here)
2008-04-03T18:58:00.000Z	marx2k	Exteris	I take it minidisc recorders are still huge in Europe?
2008-04-03T18:59:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	minidisk? it's 1gb flash (like the ipod shuffle)
2008-04-03T19:00:00.000Z	marx2k	Exteris	Yeah, but last time I was in europe, people were still using minidisc players a lot
2008-04-03T19:01:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	minidisc is a small cd? if so, how many years ago? most ppl have ipods or other mp3 players
2008-04-03T19:02:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	i've never seen one of those :P

2008-04-03T19:04:00.000Z	Exteris	marx2k	that rocks :P my zen stone only lasts like 12 hours
