2007-04-02T08:00:00.000Z	robinlinth		guys, I am looking for support for a problem that i have a year now! Yes, a year. The problem is a very slow computer. Upon reinstall, it is snappy and fast, but after a few months it becomes slower and slower. My specs are not bad, so it's not that. Somebody suggested that it could be X. Okay, so, maybe it is X. Can anyone please help me with this problem? Specs: CPU: AMD Athlon 2800+, Videocard: ATI Radeon 9250, RAM: 512MB, HDD: Maxtor

2007-04-02T08:02:00.000Z	robinlinth		Can anyone help me with that one?
2007-04-02T08:03:00.000Z	robinlinth		Please?
2007-04-02T08:04:00.000Z	robinlinth		Hello?
2007-04-02T08:04:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	 I fix all my problems by rebooting a windows box. j/k.  I've never experienced any severe slowdowns except when some java tries to hijjack firefox, and usually I get a warning about a runaway script and an option to cancel it, which I do. end of problem
2007-04-02T08:04:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	run htop and see if you can isolate what is eating up the cpu
2007-04-02T08:05:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	Hm.. well, firefox is definetly not the cause here. Even without anything running, it is slow. Well, GNOME is running.
2007-04-02T08:06:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	somethings got to be running and eating up the cpu.  htop is a pretyt nice app you can run and minimize. if you machine starts slowing down you can take a look and see what's doing the damage
2007-04-02T08:13:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	almost sounds like a windows zombie machine.  while it's pretty rare for your linux box to get hijacked, it's not impossible.  just so you can check it off your list, "apt-get install chkrootkit rkhunter" and make sure next time you run into this situation
2007-04-02T08:13:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	Well, I had windows on it for like 3 years or something. It's off my machine now
2007-04-02T08:14:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	I can't see where one would have anything to do with the other
2007-04-02T08:15:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	well, maybe it infected some part in my computer while windows was on it.
2007-04-02T08:15:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	I guess the most important question: are you having this trouble right now? if you are then zulfajuniadi is making a good suggestion. if not then you'll be spinning your wheels
2007-04-02T08:16:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	My PC is slow as we speak, yes.
2007-04-02T08:19:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	The rootkit scanners all gave the result: 0
2007-04-02T08:19:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	that's a good thing.
2007-04-02T08:43:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	do you have a NetVista M42?
2007-04-02T08:44:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	no, and i don't know what that is.
2007-04-02T08:46:00.000Z	StoneNote	robinlinth	I found a "Sparodically slow system clock" bug which suggests "Boot with the noapic kernel option" as a workaround https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/71023
2007-04-02T08:46:00.000Z	robinlinth	StoneNote	I am on a VIA computer, so no.
