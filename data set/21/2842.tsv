2011-09-02T00:27:00.000Z	twig11		Where should I start troubleshooting to figure out why my Brother mfc-j615 AIO scanner unit isn't detected across the local network? I've installed the brother print and scan drivers, and printing works fine, but the scanner is not recognized. I've googled this and read whatever I can find on Brother's support site, but I'm not getting anywhere. Thanks for any help.
2011-09-02T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	have you installed the scanner drivers from the brother site? they make linux drivers you know ;)
2011-09-02T00:28:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	That's why I purchased a Brother. Read my whole post.
2011-09-02T00:29:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	Sorry for sounding rude, it wasn't meant that way.
2011-09-02T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	its cool
2011-09-02T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	so if you use simple scan, what message do you get?
2011-09-02T00:31:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	It's all installed, like I said, and I've followed the directions at
2011-09-02T00:32:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	Sorry didn't see your last message. "No Scanners Available" and No Scanners Connected"
2011-09-02T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	is your OS 32bit or 64bit?
2011-09-02T00:34:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	32bit
2011-09-02T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	try:  wget http://www.brother.com/pub/bsc/linux/dlf/brscan3-0.2.11-4.i386.deb; sudo dpkg -i ./brscan3-0.2.11-4.i386.deb; rm ./brscan3-0.2.11-4.i386.deb
2011-09-02T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	there is also a set of brother drivers in the repos, may work
2011-09-02T00:38:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	I'm trying your instructions. I already installed the brother drivers from the repository earlier.
2011-09-02T00:40:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	Do I need to reboot after installing that driver?
2011-09-02T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	don't think so
2011-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	Still doesn't work. Could it have something to do with the network configuration, even if the printer is working on the network?
2011-09-02T00:49:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	Have any idea if I should be worried about my network configuration interfering with recognition of the AIO scanner if its printer is being recognized?
2011-09-02T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	none at the moment, tbh I don't use scanners
2012-03-28T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	have you tested RAM health?
2012-05-02T20:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twig11	have you set another shortcut to it? If you use terminal a lot, I suggest you install guake :)
2012-05-02T20:02:00.000Z	twig11	ActionParsnip	no, it just quit working after update. I'll check ccsm and keyboard settings.
