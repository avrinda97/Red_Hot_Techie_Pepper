2007-05-11T11:06:00.000Z	dougie		how do i figure out what my hard drive is mounted under?
2007-05-11T11:07:00.000Z	dougie		i need to mount it as a cdrom for the installer to continue
2007-05-11T11:07:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	which installer?
2007-05-11T11:08:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	so you're booting off of a USB HD, and attempting to install to a local HD on a Desktop/Laptop
2007-05-11T11:08:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	yes thats correct
2007-05-11T11:08:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	the guide i'm useing says to mount it as a cdrom drive when it comes up saying that it can't mount the cdrom
2007-05-11T11:09:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	but i'm not sure what the installer see's my ext usb hard drive as
2007-05-11T11:09:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	on here its /dev/sdb1
2007-05-11T11:09:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	try "$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ubuntu & mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubuntu"
2007-05-11T11:10:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	are you using a SATA, SCSI, or ATA harddrive for your destination HD?
2007-05-11T11:10:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	right, what I'm doing is creating a folder in the temp memory to mount your harddrive into
2007-05-11T11:11:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	make that folder, then try $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ubuntu
2007-05-11T11:11:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	no, I wasnt sure, I was assuming you had an ATA harddrive, but try sda1 for a scsi harddrive
2007-05-11T11:14:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	installing from CD would be a lot easier. is there a particular reason you're going from harddrive?
2007-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	cdrom drive broken
2007-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	ooh :S darn... well, if you can't get sudo to work, I'm sorry, but I can't help. good luck :)
2007-05-11T11:16:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	its the install cd...you don't have to use sudo
2007-05-11T11:16:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	to mount an HD, like you requested, you need to have root priveleges
2007-05-11T11:16:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	yeah on the install cd you automatically have root permissions
2007-05-11T11:17:00.000Z	dougie	connorp	i'm not on the live cd its the alternate cd
2007-05-11T11:17:00.000Z	connorp	dougie	have you double-clicked the installer?
