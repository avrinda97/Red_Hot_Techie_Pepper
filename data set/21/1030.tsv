2011-03-01T01:48:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	but i can from my other laptop
2011-03-01T01:33:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	is it up to date? error messages?
2011-03-01T01:34:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	what happens when you try?
2011-03-01T01:36:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	what securityty is being used on the router?
2011-03-01T01:42:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	the syslog says the error is, denied authentication (status 1)
2011-03-01T01:43:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	what now?
2011-03-01T01:44:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	uhm, i don't remember what you wree doing
2011-03-01T01:45:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	lol, my netbook won't connect to my router
2011-03-01T01:46:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	ah ok. so it seems your router settings may need checking, can you connect to it with no security
2011-03-01T01:47:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	yes, from eth0
2011-03-01T01:47:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	no i meant wireless but no security
2011-03-01T01:49:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	well that is something more fundamental then :/ if you can't connect wirelessly at all to the router...what does it do when it tries connecting without security? it won't need to authenticate will it?
2011-03-01T01:50:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	theres no security on the router, ATM
2011-03-01T01:50:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	so what does it do?
2011-03-01T01:51:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	tries to connect and gets denied authentication, authentication which should happen?
2011-03-01T01:52:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	are you sure there is no security on there? Idunno if authentication is required when connecting with no security?
2011-03-01T01:52:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	like I said, my HP laptop connects fine, no problems, and this acer connected to another network fine, just can't connect to mine
2011-03-01T01:52:00.000Z	mickster04	vismundCygnus	well that makes no sense
2011-03-01T01:53:00.000Z	vismundCygnus	mickster04	exactly
