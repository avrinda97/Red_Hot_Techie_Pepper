2009-06-26T05:13:00.000Z	Aacron		ubuntu is supposed to be tryign to take linux from geek to joe right?  wonder why they haven't made a UI where we can just do this stuff in nice little windows :P
2009-06-26T05:13:00.000Z	Aacron		hehe
2009-06-26T05:14:00.000Z	Aacron		oh... hrmm the windows ext2/3 plugin is flaky?
2009-06-26T05:15:00.000Z	Aacron		I *could* use FAT, but... ugh doesn't it have lower performance and such?  I store my windows games on that drive as well...
2009-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	Aacron		so performance is a good thing.
2009-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	Aacron		ahh okay... lol guess I could reformat it to NTFS... can I do that in linux to ENSURE that its formatted in a way that linux understands?
2009-06-26T05:18:00.000Z	Aacron		cause I did notice it was listign it as NTFS_Hsomethingoranother
2009-06-26T05:18:00.000Z	Aacron		like... i think I'd use... mkfs.ntfs, right?
2009-06-26T05:19:00.000Z	Aacron		lol sorry jrib , I get to generally sayign things when I have two peopel talking :P
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	Aacron		NAS?
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	evon	Aacron	can you help me again now?
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	Aacron	evon	 erm what was I helping you with earlier?
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	evon	Aacron	recovering a lost partition
2009-06-26T05:22:00.000Z	evon	Aacron	to recap ...
2009-06-26T05:22:00.000Z	Aacron	evon	 erm I think ya have the wrong person man, cause I have no clue how to recover lost partitions :(
2009-06-26T05:23:00.000Z	Aacron	evon	 well... I do but mainly in windows or with recovery tools from the UBCD
2009-06-26T05:23:00.000Z	evon	Aacron	what tools on UBCD do you use. I could not find anything on it that would help me recover a linux partition
2009-06-26T05:24:00.000Z	Aacron	evon	 think there were a few under 'filesystem tools' :P
2009-06-26T05:30:00.000Z	evon	Aacron	yes. I used the program to recover some stuff but it produced a .img file i don't know what to do with
2009-06-26T05:30:00.000Z	Aacron	evon	 oh... hrmm.  I'd think if it is an image, you'd just mount it no?
2009-06-26T05:31:00.000Z	evon	Aacron	ok I will try that now
