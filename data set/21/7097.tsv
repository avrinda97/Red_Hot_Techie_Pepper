2007-03-31T07:14:00.000Z	eugman		What's a good way to get a c++ programming envrioment setup?
2007-03-31T07:15:00.000Z	genii	eugman	Install the build-essential, kernel headers, linux-source   then some good IDE
2007-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	eugman	genii	any ideas about that last one?
2007-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	genii	eugman	Well, for KDE desktop there is Kdevelop
2007-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	genii	eugman	There are some for gnome but I'm not overly familiar with those ones. Perhaps Anja
2008-01-21T23:17:00.000Z	genii	eugman	dhcp server or dhcp client?
2008-01-21T23:19:00.000Z	genii	eugman	man dhclient.conf               it's found in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf           you can set longer timeout periods, other things there
2008-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	eugman	genii	cool. Should I able to use the conf info from my laptop?
2008-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	genii	eugman	Conceivably :)
2008-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	eugman	genii	hopefully. Thanks.
2008-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	genii	eugman	np
2008-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	eugman	genii	Oh btw. How can I test if the network card is recognized once I finish the install?
2008-01-21T23:21:00.000Z	genii	eugman	Before reboot you mean?
2008-01-21T23:21:00.000Z	genii	eugman	Sorry, thinking ubuntu install instead of dhcp install there a second
2008-01-21T23:22:00.000Z	eugman	genii	I am doing a full install. After I get it intalled and have acess to the shell.
2008-01-21T23:22:00.000Z	genii	eugman	OK. 1 minute.
2008-01-21T23:24:00.000Z	genii	eugman	You can chroot there and do ifconfig...but it will be blank slate for stuff like hosts, /etc/network/interfaces and so on. Not to mention udev. But you could try these steps:
2008-01-21T23:25:00.000Z	genii	eugman	sudo cp -a /etc/network/* /target/etc/network
2008-01-21T23:26:00.000Z	genii	eugman	sudo cp -a /etc/hosts /target/etc/hosts
2008-01-21T23:28:00.000Z	genii	eugman	Forget the first one there about /dev/sdb1  and the others replace /mnt/ with /target/
2008-01-21T23:28:00.000Z	genii	eugman	then chroot /target   and test connection with ifconfig
