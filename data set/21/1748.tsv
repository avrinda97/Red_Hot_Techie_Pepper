2010-05-08T16:18:00.000Z	rsc-	gbsun	that may be your connection acting up
2010-05-08T16:19:00.000Z	gbsun		this is the only method , how can i resolve this problem
2010-05-08T16:19:00.000Z	rsc-	gbsun	that looks like a really big repo, you may need a good connection to download all the data from it
2010-05-08T16:19:00.000Z	rsc-	gbsun	you can download it instead from the github page maybe
2010-05-08T16:19:00.000Z	rsc-		http://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync should have a download link
2010-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	gbsun		rhomobile for windows has the download file. but for linux, just recomand use the "git clone"
2010-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	gbsun		what can i do now?
2010-05-08T16:20:00.000Z	rsc-	gbsun	http://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync should have a download link to "Download Source", which is essentially what you'll get from doing a `git clone`
2010-05-08T16:21:00.000Z	gbsun		thanks , i will go and try
2010-05-08T16:23:00.000Z	gbsun	rsc-	i go to the web page and find that : RhoSync-1-4-1_setup.exe             RhoSync v1.4.1 Windows Installer
2010-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	gbsun		there do not exit for linux
2010-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	gbsun		rsc-:
