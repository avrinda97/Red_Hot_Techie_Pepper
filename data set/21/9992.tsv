2005-06-21T08:18:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	i know i have to get the kernel from the new system onto bootx... but i can't find it
2005-06-21T08:18:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	/boot/
2005-06-21T08:19:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	can i do that from os9?
2005-06-21T08:19:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	doubt it, unless it is on the cd somewhere too
2005-06-21T08:19:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	should be able to boot the installer again and use that to copy the image to os9
2005-06-21T08:20:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	go back to the installer?
2005-06-21T08:22:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/powerpc/install
2005-06-21T08:22:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	read section 7.1.1
2005-06-21T08:22:00.000Z	AlwaysModest		cool ok
2005-06-21T08:23:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	If you use BootX to boot into the installed system....
2005-06-21T08:24:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	thanks :)
2005-06-21T08:28:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	still nothing
2005-06-21T08:28:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	what does that mean
2005-06-21T08:29:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	well i set the root device to /dev/hdc8 which is what it should be but at a point it just tells me the "root=" is wrong.... which it shouldnt be
2005-06-21T08:31:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	do you see a 'Partition check' and then some stuff?
2005-06-21T08:31:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	not from bootx
2005-06-21T08:31:00.000Z	justin	AlwaysModest	no, before it stops booting.
2005-06-21T08:32:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	there is something at the way end of the installation that i should've written down, about the boot loader.... might just see if i can find that again
2005-06-21T08:32:00.000Z	AlwaysModest	justin	not that i saw
