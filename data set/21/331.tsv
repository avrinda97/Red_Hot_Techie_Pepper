2012-07-31T08:21:00.000Z	L3top	Fusion_	that is... confusing. We just created that mode.
2012-07-31T08:29:00.000Z	Fusion_	L3top	will it be easier if i let you control ther server?
2012-07-31T08:31:00.000Z	L3top	Fusion_	I don't like the liability of that, and if I find a solution, nobody in the world benefits from it but you. I would rather figure out why your monitor is not providing any EDID data at all, to start with.
2012-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	Fusion_	L3top	thats fine what would you like me to do next
2012-07-31T08:42:00.000Z	L3top	Fusion_	You need to purge the nvidia-current driver and try to install the glx-96 driver... so... sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current; sudo apt-get install nvidia-96              However I believe you will end up having trouble with the abi-somethingorother driver which no longer exists.
