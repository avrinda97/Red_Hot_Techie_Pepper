2009-01-24T20:23:00.000Z	laggo		gahh im dying
2009-01-24T20:23:00.000Z	laggo		all i get after installing is "operating system not found"
2009-01-24T20:24:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	make sure u installed to the master drive
2009-01-24T20:24:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	i have one drive in the machine, i use ubuntu install to entire disk, i tell grub to do its thing with the mbr etc
2009-01-24T20:24:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	and still, operating system not found
2009-01-24T20:26:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	if you use GParted it should tell u the formatting of the drive
2009-01-24T20:26:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	the formatting? it has a primary bootable partition and a swap partition
2009-01-24T20:27:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	is the drive in ext3 format
2009-01-24T20:27:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	yes
2009-01-24T20:34:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	how many writes does it do?
2009-01-24T20:34:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	just one
2009-01-24T20:35:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	urban legend, i know a lot of those data recovery guys
2009-01-24T20:35:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	it cnt be urban legend I have seen it with my own eyes
2009-01-24T20:36:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	i would gladly challenge any data recovery expert to find any meaningful data after it has been dd'd
2009-01-24T20:36:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	I'll ask him if he is up for the challange
2009-01-24T20:36:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	yes, they rely on high level deletion, this is just raw writes to the drive
2009-01-24T20:39:00.000Z	jclbrt	laggo	I've seen my uncle do it with his software
2009-01-24T20:39:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	not recovering from raw writes to the drive
2009-01-24T20:42:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	ask your uncle if he would accept a challenge to recover just a name of a file from a drive that has been wiped ONCE with a `dd if=/dev/zero` command
2009-01-24T20:44:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	because crooks dont use fundamental writes :)
2009-01-24T20:48:00.000Z	laggo	jclbrt	only 20% done
