2010-06-12T09:41:00.000Z	chuck_	bastid_raZor	boss will the panel be back next login?
2010-06-12T09:42:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	look in .xsession-errors  .. see if there is a reason the gnome-panel died.
2010-06-12T09:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	and yes it should be there on a reboot
2010-06-12T09:44:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	gedit ~/.xession-errors
2010-06-12T09:47:00.000Z	chuck_	bastid_raZor	I see I/O warning : failed to load external entity "/home/shelby/.compiz/usr/bin/compiz (core) - warn: No GLXFBConfig for depth 32
2010-06-12T09:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	i normally see tons of compiz errors/warnings .. nearly all can be ignored
2010-06-12T09:55:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	good luck :)
2010-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	type killall gnome-panel   .. do the panels show up after about 5 seconds
2010-06-12T10:08:00.000Z	chuck_	bastid_raZor	u still around? I reboot and still not there.
2010-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	do you get any results from this: ps aux | grep -i gnome-panel
2010-06-12T10:14:00.000Z	chuck_	bastid_raZor	yes I got something
2010-06-12T10:15:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	more than : grep -i gnome-panel
2010-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	what was the error?
2010-06-12T10:21:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	and you didn't see anything in .xsession-errors about gnome-panel ?
2010-06-12T10:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	what is the error?
2010-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	normally the gnome-panel fails to start when an applet that is added crashes.. the first command i gave you should have removed that thoug.
2010-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	i have to sleep, work in 4 hours.
2010-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	chuck_	bastid_raZor	I can now give u exact error msg if that helps
2010-06-12T10:26:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	chuck_	best of luck.
