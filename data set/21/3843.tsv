2012-11-28T01:30:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	And so insecure, and non-linear by design.
2012-11-28T02:25:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	Not without the full error message, in a pastebin.

2012-11-28T02:26:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	The entire output of the command you ran that caused that message.
2012-11-28T02:30:00.000Z	dsa	bekks	-> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1392839/
2012-11-28T02:31:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	What did you install before? A release canditate of samba4?
2012-11-28T02:32:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	And as you can see in your pastebin, you have a file conflict with your alr
2012-11-28T02:32:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	And as you can see in your pastebin, you have a file conflict with your already installed samba.
2012-11-28T02:34:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	You still HAVE version 3.
2012-11-28T02:34:00.000Z	dsa	bekks	should i unistall something?
2012-11-28T02:34:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	And you have to decide wether you want samba3 or samba4.
2012-11-28T02:36:00.000Z	dsa	bekks	from what i red some days ago ppl said samba v4 isnt good yet maybe im misinformed?! but anyway i think zentyal is demanding samba v4?
2012-11-28T02:37:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	I strongly think you are relying on misinformation pretty much, and yes, zentyal requires samba4, as far as I can tell.
2012-11-28T02:51:00.000Z	dsa	bekks	i'm in a loop and don't understand how o solve this -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1392887/
2012-11-28T02:56:00.000Z	bekks	dsa	remove samba4, then remove samba3, then install samba4.
