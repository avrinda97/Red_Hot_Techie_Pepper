2011-03-08T14:38:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	how many machines as clients do you have in your network which will be accessing your server?
2011-03-08T14:39:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	18 - 50
2011-03-08T14:39:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	you can go 2 ways - dns server or manually mapping hostname to IP on hosts file
2011-03-08T14:46:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	does your router assing dns server address to clients? is it its own?
2011-03-08T14:49:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	on the same (client) machine?
2011-03-08T14:53:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	so can you answer my question please? you can nslookup but you cant ping from the same client machine?
2011-03-08T14:55:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	hmmm try ipconfig /flushdns
2011-03-08T15:14:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	nada, and it got so locked up, I got disconnected there.
2011-03-08T15:15:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	omg..
2011-03-08T15:15:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	?
2011-03-08T15:15:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	locked up just because of the domain change?
2011-03-08T15:15:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	no, the router got more and more overloaded with local dns enabled.
2011-03-08T15:16:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	anyway, you are back to hosts or dns if its a no go via router
2011-03-08T15:16:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	I can set up the mac as a dns server.
2011-03-08T15:16:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	(which is the server in question -- moltx-mac running Ubuntu Server 10.10)
2011-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	whatever you find suitable.. it's your environment.
2011-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	any good dns servers you would recommend?
2011-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	yeah, I realized that.. hostname is pretty much self-explanatory :)
2011-03-08T15:20:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	sorry, no.. but you can google it for sure
2011-03-08T15:24:00.000Z	moltendorf	High_Priest	still there?
2011-03-08T15:24:00.000Z	High_Priest	moltendorf	yeap
