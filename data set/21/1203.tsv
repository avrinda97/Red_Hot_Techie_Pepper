2010-12-28T02:36:00.000Z	Nyx_		hey, could anyone give me some help with installing a chipset driver binary? I'm having issues figuring out how to get rid of Xorg
2010-12-28T02:37:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	why do you want to get rid of xorg?
2010-12-28T02:38:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	Dropping to runlevel 1 doesn't seem to work, all I get is a splash screen, then it freezes
2010-12-28T02:39:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	try booting with nosplash
2010-12-28T02:39:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	also try recovery mode
2010-12-28T02:39:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	also try changing the terminal with the alt-f keys
2010-12-28T02:40:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	alrighty, will do that. Do I just edit the grub .conf file with the argument -nosplash>
2010-12-28T02:40:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	well I would append it to the grub runtime when its booting not in the config
2010-12-28T02:42:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	so just add it to the boot command in GRUB then?
2010-12-28T02:42:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	yes well pass it to the kernel as an argument
2010-12-28T02:42:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	ok, trying that right now
2010-12-28T02:57:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	it seems that I cannot get grub to let me edit the commands in the menu. Is it possible my installation of grub isn't working correctly?
2010-12-28T02:58:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	really?
2010-12-28T02:59:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	yeah, I get to a menu that says "press e to edit and c for command line" but won;t do anything if I press either. THe arrow keys and enter work though
2010-12-28T02:59:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	lemme check quick
2010-12-28T03:02:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	grub.cfg
2010-12-28T03:03:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	The version is GRUB 1.98-1ubuntu9
2010-12-28T03:05:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	should I run upgrade-from-grub-legacy in terminal?
2010-12-28T03:05:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	and hope that fixes the issue?
2010-12-28T03:06:00.000Z	dotblank	Nyx_	yea go for it
2010-12-28T03:09:00.000Z	Nyx_	dotblank	well, now I upgraded grub, but I don't even see a menu when I reboot. Is this some kind of setting I can change?
