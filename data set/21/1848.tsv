2010-04-10T02:05:00.000Z	SeekTruth		Im new Ubuntu.  I have a problem that never used to happen in vista.  When I write text on a forum, sometimes firefox and the whole Ubuntu stops responding!  Whats going on? I thought Ubuntu was stable?  And how do I get out of it? I had to hard reboot my whole PC?
2010-04-10T02:06:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	last question first: yes, switching between operating systems works by rebooting your PC and no other way (except for virtualization, but that's another topic)
2010-04-10T02:06:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	which version of Ubuntu are you running? graphics chipset? used driver?
2010-04-10T02:07:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	especially proprietary drivers can cause problems
2010-04-10T02:08:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	you could have gotten back to your graphical environment by pressing ctrl+f7 btw
2010-04-10T02:08:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	again, which version of Ubuntu are you running?
2010-04-10T02:08:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	which graphics adapter is in your system?
2010-04-10T02:09:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	Ubuntu 9.10.  Laptop with Nvidia 8400 built in
2010-04-10T02:09:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	which graphics driver are you using? the proprietary one from nvidia?
2010-04-10T02:09:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	i just installed Ubuntu 6 hours ago.. whatever came with it
2010-04-10T02:10:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	why would the video driver cause ubuntu to crash just by typing text on a forum?
2010-04-10T02:10:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	you were most likely asked whether you want to enable a proprietary driver
2010-04-10T02:10:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	no i wasnyt
2010-04-10T02:11:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	did you install all available updates yet (through update manager)?
2010-04-10T02:11:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	fully up to date
2010-04-10T02:11:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	there was 240MB updates after I installed
2010-04-10T02:13:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	should I activate nvidia 185 drivers?
2010-04-10T02:14:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	if it isn't activated you could give it a try, yes
2010-04-10T02:14:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	if it is activated, try deactivating it
2010-04-10T02:16:00.000Z	SeekTruth	sp	you think installing this 185 Nvidia driver will stop the freezing and lockups?
2010-04-10T02:17:00.000Z	sp	SeekTruth	I can't tell for sure, but it's worth a try :)
