2008-07-10T07:29:00.000Z	koolranch		hi everyone, how to a change the permission settings for /usr/local/bin?
2008-07-10T07:30:00.000Z	plik	koolranch	same as for anything else :  chmod
2008-07-10T07:30:00.000Z	koolranch	plik	so I just chmod /usr/local/bin?
2008-07-10T07:30:00.000Z	plik	koolranch	you probably need to read the man page first and understand what you're doing
2008-07-10T07:31:00.000Z	koolranch		what I'm trying to do is install a program in that directory
2008-07-10T07:31:00.000Z	koolranch		but I don't have write permission
2008-07-10T07:31:00.000Z	plik	koolranch	sudo mv
2008-07-10T07:31:00.000Z	koolranch		what does sudo mv do?
2008-07-10T07:32:00.000Z	plik		gives you permission to move it there
2008-07-10T07:32:00.000Z	koolranch		I haven't installed the file yet
2008-07-10T07:32:00.000Z	koolranch		so I don't have anything to put after the sudo mv command
2008-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	plik	koolranch	what are you trying to install, and more importantly HOW
2008-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	koolranch		I'm trying to install the emusic player
2008-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	koolranch		for emusic.com
2008-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	koolranch		and I've used chmod to open the installer
2008-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	koolranch		and it's asking for a file destination, and I heard that it was good to put files in /usr/local/bin
2008-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	koolranch		Ubuntu won't let me put a file there though
2008-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	plik	koolranch	sudo make install is probably what you want
2008-07-10T07:36:00.000Z	plik		but you should follow any instructions that came with it...
2008-07-10T07:36:00.000Z	plik		or learn about how to build and install software (google knows)
2008-07-10T07:36:00.000Z	koolranch	plik	do I type the directory name after "sudo make install?"
