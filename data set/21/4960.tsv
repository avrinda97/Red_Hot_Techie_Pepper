2009-09-23T14:45:00.000Z	knut_		hi, does anyone know how to enable direct3d support in virtualbox?
2009-09-23T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	install guest additions
2009-09-23T14:46:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	already done.. has no effect
2009-09-23T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	did you edit xorg.conf to use the new driver?

2009-09-23T14:46:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	i only installed the guest additions
2009-09-23T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	then the drivers are there, just not being used
2009-09-23T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	dont expect miracles, direct3d isnt great
2009-09-23T14:47:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	:) i only want to enable aero design for emulated win7
2009-09-23T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	looks tacky if you ask me, like an afterthought
2009-09-23T14:48:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	what means tacky?
2009-09-23T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	plastic and cheap
2009-09-23T14:49:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	you mean the whole aero design
2009-09-23T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	yes, its also aero that means you must have a 3d gfx card just to run the desktop, its appauling
2009-09-23T14:51:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	i know that it costs lot of performance.. but why dont use it when i have the ressources :), i like my jaunty to look like jaunty but i want my win to look like win in full gear :)
2009-09-23T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	your choice. Id rather plow system resources into running apps better than some pathetic gloss
2009-09-23T14:53:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	one thing in jaunty i have is that the windows open with some kind of delay, i dont know where this issue come from. when i had intrepid this problem wasnt there
2011-04-24T08:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	run:  sudo lshw -C network     websearch for the product line to find guides. You can see if its already working with:  sudo iwlist scan | head -n 25     if you see wireless SSIDs then its working
2011-04-24T08:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knut_	run: rfkill list    to see if its blocked in any way
2011-04-24T08:12:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	it doesn't show anything related to my wireless, the iwlist scan command, show me something about the lo and eth0
2011-04-24T08:13:00.000Z	knut_	ActionParsnip	the rfkill list command did not output anything
