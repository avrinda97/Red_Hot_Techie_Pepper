2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	that's rather useless on a 7500
2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	that's the only driver  :)
2009-01-11T08:48:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	But xorg.conf doesnt do anything ...
2009-01-11T08:49:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	eh?
2009-01-11T08:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	isnt the xorg.conf file totally deprecated ?
2009-01-11T08:50:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	no, how do you think choose nvidia and fglrx?
2009-01-11T08:51:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	hmmm I was under the impression that it was all HAL files now
2009-01-11T08:51:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	at any rate - it doesnt work exactly the same as before, some of the mode options dont work anymore
2009-01-11T08:52:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	yes, the xorg.conf is being slowly killed, but afaik it should still work for this
2009-02-04T08:33:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	so your only concern is with the rendering of the wallpaper image?
2009-02-04T08:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	no ... that is a concern though
2009-02-04T08:33:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	what are you referring to, then?
2009-02-04T08:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	the bigger concern is that there a whole bunch of dead space around the screen
2009-02-04T08:34:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	bbzez wants to dual screen with 2 monitors at wildly different resolutions
2009-02-04T08:35:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	it should work just fine, at least with xrandr 1.2; I'm not sure what fglrx multihead looks like nowadays though
2009-02-04T08:36:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	I just dont think it looks very good -- that and all the dead space
2009-02-04T08:36:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	unless xrandr fixed that now?
2009-02-04T08:38:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	where would there be dead space? technically, the screen would be the size of a rectangle containing both outputs, but the space around the smaller one would only be apparent in the pager
2009-02-04T08:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80	crdlb	I dunno --- Im not thinking straight this eve
2009-03-04T08:06:00.000Z	crdlb	Cpudan80	iwlist <interface> scan?
