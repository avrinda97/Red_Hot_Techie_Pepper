2009-05-17T04:59:00.000Z	kn100	erUSUL	thats no easy task
2009-05-17T05:00:00.000Z	kn100	erUSUL	here is the file im looking for, this is the only location i can find it http://www.lokigames.com/products/ut/updates.php3
2009-05-17T05:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	kn100	have you tried with bittorrent... bt can "repair" files
2009-05-17T05:02:00.000Z	kn100	erUSUL	looked for torrents of the file, but nada
2009-05-17T05:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	kn100	:1
2010-04-06T04:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	kn100	the closest thing is ntfsfix from ntfsprogs but it is too limited. it is better to use windows to work with ntfs filesystems
2010-04-06T04:15:00.000Z	kn100	erUSUL	I don't have windows because grub ate the bootloader and I can't work with the ntfs disk in ubuntu to fix it because its telling me to check the disk in windows o.O
2010-04-06T04:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	kn100	try with ntfsfix then
2010-04-06T04:17:00.000Z	kn100	erUSUL	thanks :D
2010-08-15T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	kn100	drop the -o and instead of "rw" put  "defaults"
