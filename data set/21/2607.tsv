2011-08-12T15:47:00.000Z	javier__		someone can help me detecting who is transfering in my wifi? I suspect a neightbour or someone is using it
2011-08-12T15:48:00.000Z	javier__		i did nmap, with this answer: 256 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 103.17 seconds
2011-08-12T15:50:00.000Z	javier__		ok
2011-08-12T15:50:00.000Z	javier__		anyway, I would like to investigate if someone is really using my wifi
2011-08-12T15:51:00.000Z	histo	javier__	you can look at who is assigned ips on most router pages
2011-08-12T15:59:00.000Z	histo	javier__	most routers default to username: admin  and password: admin
2011-08-12T16:00:00.000Z	histo	javier__	perhaps the ip is not 192.168.1.1
2011-08-12T16:02:00.000Z	javier__	histo	might be that. But then, what is it?
2011-08-12T16:02:00.000Z	histo	javier__	are you runnign linux rightnow?
2011-08-12T16:03:00.000Z	histo	javier__	if so type ifconfig in a terminal and it will show what IP is assigned to your current machine.
2011-08-12T16:03:00.000Z	javier__	histo	yes
2011-08-12T16:03:00.000Z	histo	javier__	should be 192..... or 10.....
2011-08-12T16:06:00.000Z	javier__	histo	in wlan0??? there it's said 192.168.2.7, but can't enter there neither
2011-08-12T16:06:00.000Z	histo	javier__	okay then navigate to 192.168.2.1
2011-08-12T16:07:00.000Z	javier__	histo	that was it :)   I forgot to study that part :P
2011-08-12T16:08:00.000Z	javier__	histo	in windows, how to do something like that ifconfig?
2011-08-12T16:13:00.000Z	javier__	histo	i enter the router and there I saw "active DHCP clients": only my two computers IP there. So, guess no one is in here. Do you know why then "megaupload" detects my ip as downloading something?
2011-08-12T16:14:00.000Z	histo	javier__	are the two ips that are there your MAC addresses?
2011-08-12T16:14:00.000Z	javier__	histo	im not sure what is MAC address, but the two IP there are mine and my father's laptop
2011-08-12T16:15:00.000Z	histo	javier__	okay then your good i have no idea what megaupload is so can't help you there. You may want to contact their supoprt
2011-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	javier__	histo	ok. It's just a website from where you download things, with a limit if you are not premium user (as me). Thanks then!
