2009-05-04T09:39:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	did you use Wubi?
2009-05-04T09:39:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 no i installed windows xp and then linux without any program
2009-05-04T09:40:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	I think ubottu might have a link to this one, one sec
2009-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	you might have overwritten XP with Ubuntu on accident...
2009-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 also i am trying to install vmware workstation and it shows me a message that cannot be intalled when kvm enabled
2009-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	I don't use vmware, I have no idea how to help on that one, but I can tell you how to know if XP is still installed or if you accidentally overwrote it
2009-05-04T09:42:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 no coz i work about one week windows xp and linux
2009-05-04T09:42:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 ok :)
2009-05-04T09:44:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	use Add/Remove programs (in your menu on the upper right) to install Partition Editor
2009-05-04T09:47:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 i open add/remove but i cant see about the partition?
2009-05-04T09:48:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	Add/Remove is just to install the program to let you see the partitions, you need to search for Partition and install Partition editor, check the box next to it and hit Apply
2009-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 it says there is no matching partition available
2009-05-04T09:52:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	better idea, open a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and type the following into it: sudo apt-get install gparted
2009-05-04T09:53:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	ok i installed it from add/remove
2009-05-04T09:54:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	ok, open it, in System->Administration->Partition Editor
2009-05-04T09:55:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 how can i know if windows xp still or not?
2009-05-04T09:58:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 i cant see windows xp,
2009-05-04T09:58:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	then somehow it got deleted probably, are there only two partitions?
2009-05-04T09:58:00.000Z	Wolf23	M25	 there are many, i show you the screenshot on pm
2009-05-04T10:00:00.000Z	M25	Wolf23	my battery is dying, I've only got about 10 minutes left
