2008-11-26T19:59:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	True. Maybe it is a good idea to run it inside of Drupal or something similar....
2008-11-26T20:16:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	i.e., from setting it from networkmanager or /etc/network?
2008-11-26T20:17:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	Slart : no, in network manager. Is networkmanager broken?
2008-11-26T20:17:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	works for me
2008-11-26T20:17:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	strange
2008-11-26T20:18:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	I am going to try it again, maybe a recent update fixed it.
2008-11-26T20:21:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	Acually my OK button is now greyed out, can't even save it at all.
2008-11-26T20:21:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	i have all fields filled out...
2008-11-26T20:22:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	wait, it is asking for a mac address - I wonder why this would be blank....
2008-11-26T20:22:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	eh?
2008-11-26T20:29:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	there's a prerelease available right now
2008-11-26T20:25:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	- nvrmd, networkmanager is acting really strange. I will just set it manually...
2008-11-26T20:27:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	there's an overhead to it
2008-11-26T20:27:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	it's enabled on the server kernel (and the restricted modules are available for -server)
2008-11-26T20:28:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	flash64bit is coming :)
2008-11-26T20:29:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	, Slart : Cool. I might give 64bit another whirrl.
2008-11-26T20:34:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	nvidia-settings
2008-11-26T20:35:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	the only option it gives my is 60Hz.
2008-11-26T20:36:00.000Z	|{53	cwillu	- maybe there is a better channel for xserver issues?
2008-11-26T20:37:00.000Z	cwillu	|{53	#nvidia is probably your best bet (it's not an x issue, we can't do much with the nvidia driver)
