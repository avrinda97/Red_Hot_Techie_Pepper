2011-01-27T06:14:00.000Z	pzn		I need to use 3 pci-express video cards to have 6 intependent monitors. can someone recommend me a card model with "stable"(not buggy) drivers for ubuntu?
2011-01-27T06:15:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	we use nvidia card for our display wall at the university here
2011-01-27T06:15:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	although we only have two cards per machine
2011-01-27T06:15:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	(driving four monitors over dvi)
2011-01-27T06:19:00.000Z	pzn	Aginor	any nvidia recommended model? or anyone will fit? I'll only display avi/mpeg files, no 3d, no rendering
2011-01-27T06:20:00.000Z	pzn	Aginor	anyone->anymodel
2011-01-27T06:20:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	let me log into one of the machines and have a look
2011-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	we are using Gefore 8800 GT in four of the machines, one of them failed because of solder issues in the manufacturing process and we replaced it with a newer card using the same model, let me see if I can find that box too
2011-01-27T06:23:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	Geforce GTX 465
2011-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	pzn	Aginor	gtx465 or 8800gt? I have some cheap 7200GS, will they fit?
2011-01-27T06:29:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	I don't know :) in our case it was more a question of what was available at the time which didn't require us to have differnt software on one of the machines and could also drive dvi-only
2011-01-27T06:30:00.000Z	pzn	Aginor	anyway... if I get a model from nvidia (not a state-of-art model), chances of the driver working correctly will be big?
2011-01-27T06:31:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	yes
2011-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	you will have fun setting up your X-server to use all of the cards, but there will be plenty of tutorials around for that kind of thing
2011-01-27T06:33:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	as in, position in the desktop provided by X? it's handled by the window manager so find a suitable window manager
2011-01-27T06:34:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	depending on your setup you can have an X server per monitor, one spanning several monitors or a combination
2011-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	kde's window manager can do it, but there should be several other window managers that support it as well. Google around ;)
2011-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	xlib
2011-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	you would in effect be writing your own window manager if you do it on that level though
2011-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	Aginor	pzn	http://incise.org/tinywm.html
2011-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	pzn	Aginor	really nice URL! I don't intent to write a window manager. just intend to write a program that will exec 6xmplayer and put each of them in the right window maximized. anyway, tyniwm sources will help a lot!
