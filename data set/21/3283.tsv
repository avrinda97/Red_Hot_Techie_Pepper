2010-01-09T05:29:00.000Z	notk0		hello I am on the latest ubuntu , I just installed it yesterday, and apparently everytime I open Downloads folder (inside /home) It always  makes the mouse cursor busy until I close it
2010-01-09T05:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	how much data do you have in that folder?
2010-01-09T05:30:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	255.9 mb
2010-01-09T05:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	That's why, takes a while to process all of that. you may want to clean some of it out
2010-01-09T05:30:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	that only happens in the download folder?
2010-01-09T05:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	it will happen on ant folder that has that much data
2010-01-09T05:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	it is for nautilus apparently
2010-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	do you have thumbnails on?
2010-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	if they are by default yes, but I don't have any image file
2010-01-09T05:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	doesn't matter, nautilus still needs to check a lot of things and 255mb is a lot for nautilus to process
2010-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	I have about 160 mb in home splitted in 2 tars and it seems ok
2010-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	you might consider burning some of that to a cd or moving it to another folder
2010-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	This happens on all 11 of my computers too as well as my friend's boxes
2010-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	I just copied all thoose files to another folder in /home and all is ok
2010-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	I assume it has something to do with Downloads is it "special" in any way?
2010-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	could be because Downloads is listed in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
2010-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	and what does that do?
2010-01-09T05:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	Read the comment at the top of that file
2010-01-09T05:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	I don't quite understand it either
2010-01-09T05:36:00.000Z	notk0	ardchoille	were actually is this file? no /config ?
2010-01-09T05:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	notk0	it's a dot file ~/.config
