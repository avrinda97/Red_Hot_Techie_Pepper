2006-01-24T11:13:00.000Z	azion		When downloading the kernel from kernel.org does that include the source?
2006-01-24T11:14:00.000Z	azion		ng,Cheers
2006-01-24T11:16:00.000Z	azion		Can anyone tell me how to update symlinks?
2006-01-24T11:17:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	"sudo ln -sf TARGET /path/to/link"
2006-01-24T11:18:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	How do I point that to a new kernel I downloaded using synaptic?
2006-01-24T11:18:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	something like:  "sudo ln -s boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-12-686 /vmlinuz"  -  but with the correct filename in /boot/
2006-01-24T11:19:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	ty
2006-01-24T11:19:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	I don't see it there
2006-01-24T11:20:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	look in /boot/ - you'll see some vmlinux* files, no?
2006-01-24T11:20:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	Yes but not the kernel I downloaded using synaptic
2006-01-24T11:21:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	that's hard to believe.  synaptic always installs kernels into /boot/
2006-01-24T11:22:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	Maybe Im not correct in saying that
2006-01-24T11:22:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	that sounds more likely...
2006-01-24T11:22:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	It  was the update thing that said the new kernel was out
2006-01-24T11:22:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	So I selected the 686 kernel ver and downloaded
2006-01-24T11:25:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	Any ideas?
2006-01-24T11:26:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	what do you see if you run "grep -i 'installed linux-686' /var/log/dpkg.log | tail -1" in a terminal?
2006-01-24T11:28:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	No such file or directory
2006-01-24T11:29:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	For linux-686
2006-01-24T11:30:00.000Z	azion	dooglus	I can't see that the kernel was installed, I see other things I got today, but not that
2006-01-24T11:41:00.000Z	dooglus	azion	what command did that "no such file or directory" come from?
