2007-08-25T13:09:00.000Z	alecwh		How do I delete a file in the terminal?
2007-08-25T13:09:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	rm filename
2007-08-25T13:16:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	select to boot into single mode, log in, and do 'apt-get remove IPODPACKAGE'
2007-08-25T13:16:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	well, after I "attempted" to install it by doing all that stuff, I just used synaptic.
2007-08-25T13:16:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	synaptic and apt-get are just two interfaces to dpkg.
2007-08-25T13:17:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	a package installed by one can be removed by the other.
2007-08-25T13:17:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	He really needs the ipod package though. I THINK it may just be a messed up Ghome
2007-08-25T13:17:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	gnome, or gdm?
2007-08-25T13:17:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	does he even get a login prompt?
2007-08-25T13:18:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	This is how he described it: "I turned it on, and I got the ubuntu loading screen, then the screen went black, and all he could see was the spinning circle in the middle (the loading symbol)
2007-08-25T13:19:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	is it set up for automatic login?
2007-08-25T13:19:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	no
2007-08-25T13:19:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	then GDM, not Gnome, is broken.
2007-08-25T13:19:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	GDM is Gnome Display Manager, it's the thing that gives you the login boxes.
2007-08-25T13:19:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	What command can he use to fix that without using the IPOD app?
2007-08-25T13:20:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	nice try.  lol.
2007-08-25T13:21:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	How can I fix it? :P
2007-08-25T13:21:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	I would just do 'sudo apt-get remove NAME_OF_IPOD_PACKAGE; sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg'
2007-08-25T13:22:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	no guarantees that that will fix it.. but it's worth a shot...
2007-08-25T13:22:00.000Z	godlygeek	alecwh	that would remove the broken package and try reconfiguring X.
2007-08-25T13:23:00.000Z	alecwh	godlygeek	thanks, I'll give it a shot.
