2009-11-10T01:12:00.000Z	infiltration		hi there
2009-11-10T01:13:00.000Z	infiltration		I'm currently trying to share some internet connection between my laptop, which is connected through wifi, and my desktop which have no wifi card
2009-11-10T01:13:00.000Z	infiltration		i have some hub to help with this
2009-11-10T01:14:00.000Z	infiltration		but the thing is, when I plug my ethernet cable between my laptop and the hub, my wifi connection breaks
2009-11-10T01:16:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	what is a hub?
2009-11-10T01:19:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	some kind of thing that allow you to connect many ethernet wires on it to connect machines
2009-11-10T01:20:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	does a hub has wifi on its own?
2009-11-10T01:20:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	bear with me I am trying to imagine
2009-11-10T01:20:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	yes it does
2009-11-10T01:20:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	then why do you need an ethernet cable for a laptop?
2009-11-10T01:22:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	connect your desktop to the hub by a cable and then configure the wifi of the hub and laptop to communicate
2009-11-10T01:22:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	i guess the "hub" has some wifi antenna on it to allow PCs to connect to it, but not to connect on some wifi hotspot, doesn't it ?
2009-11-10T01:23:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	make it a wifi hotspot then
2009-11-10T01:23:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	create an ad-hoc network
2009-11-10T01:23:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	ok gonna try this
2009-11-10T01:27:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	ok ... tried to make some ad-hoc connection with my laptop ... but obsviously you can't connect to a wifi hotspot and be an ad-hoc host at the same time
2009-11-10T01:28:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	uhm, yes
2009-11-10T01:29:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	but where is the hotspot?
2009-11-10T01:29:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	let's start from scratch : I'm on my laptop, connected to some hotspot available in my student residence
2009-11-10T01:30:00.000Z	mka	infiltration	oh, i never caught that
2009-11-10T01:36:00.000Z	infiltration	mka	so any idea ? =/
