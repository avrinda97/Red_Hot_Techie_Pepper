2008-01-24T21:28:00.000Z	Lattyware		nevans: Yes. 2 SATA drives (Grub and Ubuntu on one of these), 2 IDE HDDs and 2 SATA DVD drives.
2008-01-24T21:29:00.000Z	Lattyware		Do tell.
2008-01-24T21:29:00.000Z	Lattyware		No, I never get a menu.
2008-01-24T21:30:00.000Z	Lattyware		nevans, I am (as I said) using the SATA drive as the primary one.
2008-01-24T21:32:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	have you updated your bios recently?
2008-01-24T21:32:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	No.
2008-01-24T21:33:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	- does the bios see all drives, and if so, what mode are they in?
2008-01-24T21:33:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	'Mode'? The bios sees all the drives, and I can mount them all fine with a live CD, they are all working fine.
2008-01-24T21:35:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	No idea, honestly.
2008-01-24T21:35:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	Whatever is default, I presume. I use LVM for my data, but that has nothing to do with Grub.
2008-01-24T21:38:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	so are they actually showing up in your bios?
2008-01-24T21:38:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	Yes. If I do F8 for a BBS prompt, I see all 4 drives. I boot of my first one (the one with Ubuntu (and grub) installed on) and it boots and gives the Grub error 17.
2008-01-24T21:41:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	you're dialling in?
2008-01-24T21:41:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	Dialing in?
2008-01-24T21:42:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	No, why?
2008-01-24T21:42:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	you hit f8 for a bios prompt?
2008-01-24T21:43:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	 that's not what i was on about - I have heard of a similar problem being a result of the cmos drive mode settings. you need to check in the actual bios
2008-01-24T21:44:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	where the mode was set to LBA when it should have been left as AUTO, and the type should be set to USER...
2008-01-24T21:47:00.000Z	Lattyware	SleepingSloth	OK, I'll check that out.
2008-01-24T21:48:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	it's just a suggestion - without knowing what could have changed to trigger this happening, its difficult to offer much...
2008-01-24T21:49:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	Lattyware	what did trigger it?
