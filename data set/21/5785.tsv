2007-11-23T13:41:00.000Z	hunteke		I think that'll do the trick
2007-11-23T13:41:00.000Z	hunteke		that's lowercase L
2007-11-23T13:41:00.000Z	hunteke		it may be sun-java-6
2007-11-23T13:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	hunteke	I'm in the live cd and the sound works what directory do I need to copy over in order to get my sound working on my HD install?
2007-11-23T13:42:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	urm, I don't know.
2007-11-23T13:43:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	ah, sorry, no the terminal.  apologies all, I'm straddling between gui and cli myself, coming from the cli
2007-11-23T13:48:00.000Z	ubuntu	hunteke	What are the files in the proc folder?
2007-11-23T13:50:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	the /proc folder is actually a mount point for the proc file system.  in layman's speak, that folder is an interaction with the linux kernel.  that will give you current settings and info, but won't be what you're looking for in terms of sound
2007-11-23T13:58:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	have you found the sound configuration files?
2007-11-23T13:58:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	because I can help you with the copying
2007-11-23T14:01:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	that's not what you're looking for.  That's what the kernel (what makes the whole computer tick) sees, but not /how/ it's being told to use it.  for that you need configuration files, which you won't find in /proc
2007-11-23T14:02:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	hmm, look for /etc/esound or /etc/sound, perhaps
2007-11-23T14:02:00.000Z	ubuntu	hunteke	Do you know what files the sound manager is changing?
2007-11-23T14:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	hunteke	checked those doesn't look like it
2007-11-23T14:03:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	how about in your home directory?
2007-11-23T14:04:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	perhaps try this:
2007-11-23T14:04:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	find . -name "*sound*" and see what comes up
2007-11-23T14:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	hunteke	I got this ./.gconf/desktop/gnome/sound
2007-11-23T14:06:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	I don't know, you'll have to look at that and see if it looks any good
2007-11-23T14:07:00.000Z	ubuntu	hunteke	How do I get to that directory?
2007-11-23T14:07:00.000Z	hunteke	ubuntu	in your gui? uh . . . can someone else help him (her?) here?
