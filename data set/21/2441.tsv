2009-10-12T05:03:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		So nobody knows what the specific command to show the desktop?
2009-10-12T05:04:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Istarnes, I think there would have to be wouldnt there, given the "Show Desktop" icon, and Ctrl alt d
2009-10-12T05:04:00.000Z	thedude42	GodfatherofEire	someone posted it already: ctl-alt-d
2009-10-12T05:04:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	thedude42	and as I told them, I need the /command/ not the keybind
2009-10-12T05:05:00.000Z	thedude42	GodfatherofEire	are you talking about a command to give the shell to show your desktop?
2009-10-12T05:05:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	thedude42	exactly
2009-10-12T05:06:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Istarnes, well, then I could always set the icon to execute a shell script to do that
2009-10-12T05:06:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Its just docky doesnt seem to like gnome-applets
2009-10-12T05:06:00.000Z	thedude42	GodfatherofEire	you would be looking for some gnome control
2009-10-12T05:07:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	thedude42	any idea what or where it might be?
2009-10-12T05:07:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		I dont suppose theres a way to search for key bindings either?
2009-10-12T05:08:00.000Z	thedude42	GodfatherofEire	key bindings are in your system menu
2009-10-12T05:08:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	thedude42	exactly where would that be
2009-10-12T05:09:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		and Istarnes, I know that, I need to figure out what script it executes or whatever it does to show the desktop
2009-10-12T05:10:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Istarnes, well it has to do it somehow, and whatever way it does it, a gnome-applet uses the same trigger, which is what I need to find
2009-10-12T05:10:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Istarnes, I'm trying to put the show/hide desktop icon into docky, but it wont allow me to just put the gnome-applet in there
2009-10-12T05:15:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Also, could I get some help with Empathy? It doesnt seem to want to support anything But XMPP Protocols
2009-10-12T05:15:00.000Z	thedude42	GodfatherofEire	apparently you want to use wmctrl
2009-10-12T05:16:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	thedude42	thanks
2009-10-12T05:18:00.000Z	thedude42	GodfatherofEire	this script worked for me to minimize all windows
