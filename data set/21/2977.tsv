2009-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		okay
2009-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		8.04 doesn't see anything to upgrade to if I use update-manager
2009-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		so I have to edit my sources.list?
2009-05-18T14:02:00.000Z	Darael	Shadowpillar	you can make Hardy see non-lts release upgrades in system->administration->software sources
2009-05-18T14:03:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	Darael	oh yeah, I forgot about it being LTS
2009-05-18T14:03:00.000Z	Darael	Shadowpillar	it's under the updates tab, "release upgrade" at the bottom
2009-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	Darael	it's been a while for me, I've been over in windows land for too long, it R make me dum :(
2009-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Darael	Shadowpillar	I know the feeling
2009-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		but you have to give microsoft some credit, without them I wouldnt have the job I have
2009-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		but it still doesn't make me hate their software any less
2009-05-18T14:06:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		especially after seeing canonical's landscape thing
2009-05-18T14:06:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		looks like a direct competitor to AD
2009-05-18T14:06:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		actually, better than AD
2009-05-18T14:07:00.000Z	Darael	Shadowpillar	especially since anyone needing to use it will probably be using paid support and it's included with that
2009-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	Darael	yeah almost tempted to do that because we have client machines that use ubuntu
2009-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		special needs clients
2009-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		they cant kill the ubuntu machines
2009-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		they ruin the windows machines quite easily
2009-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		even with antivirus
2009-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		though I suspect it's the staff more than the others
2009-05-18T14:10:00.000Z	Darael	Shadowpillar	Ah, the "joys" of "life without walls" - and being squashed by the roof
