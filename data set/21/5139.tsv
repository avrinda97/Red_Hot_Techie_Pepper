2008-07-12T05:00:00.000Z	wols	snmpee	we don't break people's ubuntu in here. never evre.
2008-07-12T05:00:00.000Z	snmpee	wols	i suggest you start reading "Linux for absolute beginners"
2008-07-12T05:01:00.000Z	snmpee	wols	we're not breaking anything here. you just have to recompile the nvidia linux header after every kernel upgrade, which is just running the installer again.
2008-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	snmpee	wols	i was right fyi
2008-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	snmpee	wols	and yes, envy is broken
2008-07-12T05:40:00.000Z	wols	snmpee	best learn what the hippocratic oath says. it's basic tenet is "do no harm". and in case of his install, you just violated this principle
2008-07-12T05:50:00.000Z	snmpee	wols	"do no harm" doesn't apply. with the nvidia drivers you need to recompile the nvidia kernel headers every time you upgrade the kernel. it's just that simple. if you think that's "harming", then you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and are beginning to turn being wrong into a fine art form
