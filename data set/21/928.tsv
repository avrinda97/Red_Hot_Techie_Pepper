2012-11-03T23:09:00.000Z	bkfitz		help
2012-11-03T23:10:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	why such an old release?
2012-11-03T23:10:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	good question... didn't want unity and it's for my father in law so I just figured less confusing
2012-11-03T23:11:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	do you think if I did 12.04 it would work better?
2012-11-03T23:11:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	that's what I run on my laptop, this is just for the luggite in-laws
2012-11-03T23:11:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	personally i'd stick with an LTS. so yes, 12.04. and try live sessions of Kubuntu and Xubuntu and see which Dad prefers.
2012-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	but why wouldn't the wifi drivers work?
2012-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	would prefer to fix this one than download 12.04 over 3g
2012-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	older kernels don't have newer FLOSS drivers baked in.
2012-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	didn't bring the 12.04 iso with me
2012-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	ugh
2012-11-03T23:13:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	can i put the newer driver debs on a thumbdrive and install that way?
2012-11-03T23:13:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	if RealTek released that chip and its driver in 2011, how does a 2009-2010 kernel support it?
2012-11-03T23:14:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	it's a 5 year old acer laptop
2012-11-03T23:14:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	10.04 uses 2.6 series. 12.04 the 3 series.
2012-11-03T23:15:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	look in restricted drivers
2012-11-03T23:15:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	could be it requires Broadcom or other formware blobs.
2012-11-03T23:15:00.000Z	bkfitz	mneptok	where?
2012-11-03T23:15:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	in the menu system is "Restricted Drivers" or somesuch
2012-11-03T23:16:00.000Z	mneptok	bkfitz	"Additional Drivers" maybe?
