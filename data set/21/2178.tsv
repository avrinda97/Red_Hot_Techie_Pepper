2010-06-05T05:55:00.000Z	mckaycr		all, I can't find 3D Windows in my CompizConfig Manager after moving from 9.10 to 10.04.
2010-06-05T05:56:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	 make sure simple ccsm is installed
2010-06-05T05:56:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	I have advanced CCSM...
2010-06-05T05:57:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	never heard of that one maybe new to ubuntu 10.04
2010-06-05T05:58:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	sorry, Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm)
2010-06-05T05:58:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	I will install simple ccsm
2010-06-05T06:02:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	now I have CCSM and simple CCSM.  Still can't find the 3D option.  in 9.10 I only needed CCSM
2010-06-05T06:04:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	ok now go to system\apperance\visual effects and select custom
2010-06-05T06:05:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	already checked that out after install. none of the tabs give me the 3D option
2010-06-05T06:06:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	CCSM actually has a lot more options available then simple CCSM
2010-06-05T06:06:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	duh.... my bad let me go do that now
2010-06-05T06:21:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	what exactly are you trying to use in compiz?
2010-06-05T06:22:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	when I rotate the cude desktop, my windows don't float over the cube anymore like in 9.10.  It's trivial I know, but I really liked it
2010-06-05T06:23:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	did u make sure rotate cube was still checked ?
2010-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	of course
2010-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	ok u'd be amazed lol
2010-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	it rotates just fine, the windows just don't have that hover effect
2010-06-05T06:25:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	totally understand, I work in a service desk
2010-06-05T06:26:00.000Z	hiexpo	mckaycr	make sure you have animations checked and go into simple ccsm and check settings it's weird sometimes they conflict each other but have to have them both to work
2010-06-05T06:27:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	 I have played with that option already... still no go
2010-06-05T06:31:00.000Z	mckaycr	hiexpo	I'm pretty green, only been playing with ubuntu for 4 years
