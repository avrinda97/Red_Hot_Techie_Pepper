2006-09-22T14:19:00.000Z	FluxD		skarr I have a sis card says its not supported has anyone got it working other than ati or nvidia?
2006-09-22T14:20:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	that should work with AIGLX it won't run on XGL though
2006-09-22T14:20:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	AIGLX is another project that XGL is based off of
2006-09-22T14:21:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	sis is unknown for AIGLX but they should work
2006-09-22T14:22:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	well if you have xorg 7.1 installed you just have to enable aiglx support since that is part of X
2006-09-22T14:23:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	yes not sure about the binary drivers though
2006-09-22T14:24:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	hang on a sec I m looking at the wiki for it right now :P
2006-09-22T14:27:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_AIGLX I know it's gentoo-wiki but just do what it says for xorg.conf
2006-09-22T14:28:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	Section "ServerLayout"
2006-09-22T14:28:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	add that to your xorg.conf
2006-09-22T14:29:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	you might have to do other stuff but that's how you enable aiglx :)
2006-09-22T14:31:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	it's in /etc/xorg.conf
2006-09-22T14:32:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	sorry it's /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-09-22T14:42:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	well do you mean compiz and such
2006-09-22T14:43:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	just follow the ubuntu's tutorial to get compiz to work
2006-09-22T14:43:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	since it works with aiglx also
2006-11-23T14:47:00.000Z	kitche	FluxD	that's what manual partition is for
2006-11-23T14:48:00.000Z	FluxD	kitche	justin_: thanks so I choose manual then what?
