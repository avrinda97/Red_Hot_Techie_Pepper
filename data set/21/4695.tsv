2009-07-15T21:43:00.000Z	bobo		Kennie: http://paste.ubuntu.com/219106/
2009-07-15T21:45:00.000Z	bobo		Kennie: i mean i have like 6 movies, but they only add up to 5gb or something (avi format)
2009-07-15T21:46:00.000Z	bobo		those are probably my biggest files
2009-07-15T21:46:00.000Z	legend2440	bobo	i would check  /var/cache/apt/archives and see if it has a bunch of deb files in there. if it does then in terminal   sudo apt-get clean  will remove them
2009-07-15T21:47:00.000Z	bobo	legend2440	will sudo apt-get clean delete anything i dont want it to delete?
2009-07-15T21:47:00.000Z	legend2440	bobo	no they are deb files you have already downloaded and installed
2009-07-15T21:47:00.000Z	bobo		ok
2009-07-15T21:47:00.000Z	bobo		thanks
2009-07-15T21:49:00.000Z	bobo		nah, it didnt do anything legends
2009-07-15T21:53:00.000Z	bobo		so i used disk analyzer and i deleted a bunch of stuff, but i still only have 50g  left out of over 100gb+ disk space
2009-07-15T21:56:00.000Z	bobo		it says that i have 95.5 gb used in disk analyzer, but i definitely dont!
2009-07-15T21:56:00.000Z	bobo		i have two hard drives
2009-07-15T21:57:00.000Z	bobo		oh thats why, ok im not sure if i can see my second hard drive, how do i add that to my linux partition
2009-07-15T21:58:00.000Z	legend2440	bobo	in Disk analyzer click   edit>preferences and click box next to the partition with mountpoint   / so it checks only that one
