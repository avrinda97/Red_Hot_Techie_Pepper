2007-03-07T07:01:00.000Z	EchoBinary		got ubuntu server 6.10 installed, id like to install fluxbox so I went #sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2007-03-07T07:01:00.000Z	EchoBinary		didn't see anythign with xorg in the install list
2007-03-07T07:02:00.000Z	EchoBinary		if I want to install fluxbox as my main desktop from the server install what's the apt-get line? :(
2007-03-07T07:02:00.000Z	EchoBinary		:) *
2007-03-07T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2007-03-07T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	I just told you.  `sudo apt-get install fluxbox`, you'll need to enable universe though
2007-03-07T07:07:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	you'll also want to install the desktop kernel, and remove the server one (do that later, and in two steps)
2007-03-07T07:09:00.000Z	EchoBinary	Flannel	ok that's done (sudo apt-get fluxbox)
2007-03-07T07:11:00.000Z	EchoBinary	Flannel	what do I install next? :)
2007-03-07T07:11:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	you'll want to install linux-generic, then reboot, and remove linux-server and linux-image-server
2007-03-07T07:16:00.000Z	EchoBinary	Flannel	okay ran #sudo apt-get remove linux-server linux-image-server
2007-03-07T07:20:00.000Z	EchoBinary	Flannel	okay ran #sudo apt-get remove linux-server linux-image-server
2007-03-07T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	right.  You're done then.  You've got the generic kernel, removed the server, installed fluxbox.  You're good to go.
2007-03-07T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	startfluxbox, I believe.
2007-03-07T07:24:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	er, fluxbox should've depended on Xorg
2007-03-07T07:24:00.000Z	EchoBinary	Flannel	that's why im asking - it didn't
2007-03-07T07:25:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	er, no, apparently it doesn't.  Thats... stupid.  Yeah, go ahead and install it.  'xserver-xorg'
2007-03-28T16:15:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	some of those might, I dont know
2007-04-06T16:34:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	there are also numerous GUI frotnends
2007-04-30T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	EchoBinary	you use sudo, like everything else in ubuntu.
