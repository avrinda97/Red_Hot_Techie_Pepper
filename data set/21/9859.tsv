2006-05-27T13:43:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		I just have to figure out how to get it to load the module automagically.
2006-05-27T13:45:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		now, rajeev I'm sorry, but gnomefreak can help you out much better than I.
2006-05-27T06:02:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		hello.
2006-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		how do I add a module to be loaded at start up?
2006-05-27T06:04:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		this thing seems to think that /etc/rc.d/init.d/vpn_client is where /etc/init.d/vpn_client is located.
2006-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		but can someone tell me where the startup scripts are located?
2006-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 depends on which ones you are refering to
2006-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 the file /etc/modules - is a list of modules to be auto-loaded
2006-06-18T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 you could ask a more detailed question..
2006-06-18T09:48:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	Dr_Willis	how would I make it for write?
2006-06-18T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 from the error message - sounds like there is a 'force' option - thats proberly documented in the man pages for 'mount'
2006-06-18T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 also sounds like it could trash the drive
2006-06-18T09:51:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	Dr_Willis	the porblem is that it was auto mounte.
2006-06-18T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 you are getting beter at asking the questions at least. :P sorry i dont have an ipod.. or any other info to help. you may want to check the ubuntu wiki/forums however.
2006-06-18T10:16:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	Dr_Willis	woudl you have any idea how to deal with changing what the auto mounter does?
2006-06-18T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 not really. i tend to mount my stuff manually for total controll.
2006-06-18T10:17:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	Dr_Willis	this won't let me mount manually :-/.
2006-06-18T10:17:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	Dr_Willis	can you give me instructions on how to get this thing to mount manually so that I can force it to mount as write?
2006-06-18T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 im not sure you want to be using the HFS+ stuff. (i dont have an ipod so cant tell ya much more)
2006-06-18T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tuxtheslacker	 make a fstab file entry that mounts it whever ya want, and check tehman page for mount as to what 'option' to give it for 'force' the rw I guess.
