2007-02-23T06:50:00.000Z	a5benwillis		Can anyone tell me how to apply a 'patch' to a c file for OpenSSH? The link to the patch is http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/attachment.cgi?id=1171
2007-02-23T06:50:00.000Z	a5benwillis		Im not sure how to apply a patch to a program that I got via apt-get
2007-02-23T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	patch -pAPPROPRIATE_NUMBER_HERE < file.patch,  see man patch for explanation of -p
2007-02-23T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	also, for rebuilding packages http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
2007-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	So do I need to download the source, apply the patch then make and install?
2007-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	no, see the last link I gave you
2007-02-23T06:54:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	looking at it but it only talks abt apt-get and downloading the source
2007-02-23T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	right, you download the source package, patch it, then rebuild it using the method decribed there
2007-02-23T06:55:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	What would be the "appropriate number" part?
2007-02-23T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	depends on how the patch was created.  Usually -p0 will work find, but see man patch for a good explanation, it's very readable, I promise
2007-02-23T06:56:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	Actually I think this 'patch' is just a new pam-auth.c file
2007-02-23T06:57:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	Wouldnt I just replace that file in the sorce befor compiling
2007-02-23T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	I guess
2007-02-23T08:46:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	Are you still here?
2007-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	find
2007-03-02T08:58:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	what is the %user variable?
2007-03-02T09:05:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	you would create a symlink with a relative path, not an absolute one
2007-03-02T09:05:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	I dontunderstand exactly
2007-03-02T09:06:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	like  ln -s .. this_is_a_symlink
2007-03-02T09:06:00.000Z	a5benwillis	jrib	Ah I see
2007-03-02T09:08:00.000Z	jrib	a5benwillis	if it is in a subdirectory of /home/username, yes
