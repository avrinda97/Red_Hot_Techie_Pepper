2009-10-02T08:14:00.000Z	homebrewcider		the hdd I "mounted" at  /media/data doesn't show up
2009-10-02T08:15:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	how did you attempt to mount it?
2009-10-02T08:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	in a terminal type sudo fdisk -l  ..this will show you all drives connected (mounted or not) to your computer.
2009-10-02T08:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	 it should have a number after sda.. then you can easily mount it via /etc/fstab on each boot
2009-10-02T08:27:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	can you pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l
2009-10-02T08:28:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	does the computer that has issues have internet? command line only?
2009-10-02T08:29:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	if you have internet on that box do: sudo apt-get install pastebinit  ..then youc an pastebin files from command line
2009-10-02T08:34:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	it isn't showing a valid partition on /dev/sdb
2009-10-02T08:38:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	yes, sorry.
2009-10-02T08:39:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	in gparted it clearly saw the drive with no partition?
2009-10-02T08:40:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	have you ever actually used the drive before?
2009-10-06T09:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	what is the last line for? also let  me look at what you should have for a vfat partition
2009-10-06T09:01:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	the UUID will replace /dev/whatever  .. which ever UUID that belongs use that instead of the /dev/
2009-10-06T09:02:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	does that UUID belong to /dev/sda1?
2009-10-06T09:03:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	just a sec and i'll have a fix on that pastebin
2009-10-06T09:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	have you made the directory /media/data ?
2009-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	what are the errors?
2009-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	does the UUID in fstab not match what sudo blkid gives for that drive?
2009-10-06T09:31:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	drive == partition
2009-10-06T09:33:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	is the drive a physical drive in your computer or an sd card?
2009-10-06T09:34:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	homebrewcider	sudo fdisk -l ..does this show the drive?
