2011-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	bootissue		anyone know what the heck this recovey menu is.. and why i have it instead of a login screen..
2011-01-09T17:51:00.000Z	bootissue		i recently added lubuntu, and xubuntu, and lubuntu took over the login screen. i dont know if thats part of the problem but what ever i need to do do get ubuntu to boot agian would be good for me
2011-01-09T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 installing extra desktops - do not affect teh sytem booting sequence.
2011-01-09T17:54:00.000Z	bootissue	Dr_Willis	could i have done this by changing a setting somewhere??
2011-01-09T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 the lubuntu login screen would not slow down your computer. ive no idea what you mean by 'unchecked a few frof the startup programs'  the Lubuntu login screen runs BEFOR the user ever logs in.
2011-01-09T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 given the stuff you have been doing.. its hard to tell exactly what you have done to the ssytem.
2011-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 installing lubuntu and xubuntu should have next to no affect on your system - since you are running one desktop or another.
2011-01-09T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 you could start from the begining.. You power up the pc.. you see a GRUB menu with several kernels/OS's -> you select one -> then you get to  the ubuntu 'recovery' menu -  for every item?
2011-01-09T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 the installer will want to reformat /
2011-01-09T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	  given the stuff you have done.. and what you have mentioned.. its hard to tell what you did to break it..
2011-01-09T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 be carefull to not reformat the wrng partitions
2011-01-09T19:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 what crap?
2011-01-09T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 i think you are wrong. I have xubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop installed on other machines. and that does NOT break the system. just makes cluttered menus.
2011-01-09T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 your system is havin issues befor those even load..  if you could get to a console, you could in theory remove them via the command line tools.
2011-01-09T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 its verly likely somthing ELSE you did broke somthing. but ive never had the 'recovery menu' always come up for every grub entry.
2011-01-09T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 you could edit one of the grub lines and replace the 'quiet splash' option with the option 'text' and see if you can boot straight to the console. then try to fix the system
2011-01-09T19:08:00.000Z	bootissue	Dr_Willis	i am quite new still..
2011-01-09T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 at the grub menu, hit 'e' make the edit. and see if you can get to the console.
2011-01-09T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 yep you are new. and thats an issue also.. you may have done somthign very wrong.. and not realized it.
2011-01-09T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 if theres nothing worth saveing on the system. You could have reinstalled  in less then 30 min or so,
2011-01-09T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bootissue	 you can boot th eusb and reinstall.. thats not 'reseting' thats reinstalling...
