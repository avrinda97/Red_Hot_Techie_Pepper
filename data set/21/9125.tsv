2005-11-06T07:07:00.000Z	Blake_Sever		I am having trouble with getting swat up and running. Can someone provide some guidance?
2005-11-06T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	it's a lot more likely you'll get help if you include useful information in the initial question
2005-11-06T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	e.g. what isn't working, how you installed, what you've tried
2005-11-06T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	did you restart inetd?
2005-11-06T07:11:00.000Z	Blake_Sever	bob2	a better question I hope ;->
2005-11-06T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	that was much better, thanks
2005-11-06T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	what does "grep swat /etc/inetd.conf" print?
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	Blake_Sever	bob2	swat    stream  tcp     nowait.400      root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/swat
2005-11-06T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	and 'sudo netstat -plnt | grep 901'?
2005-11-06T07:14:00.000Z	Blake_Sever	bob2	no return I just get the prompt back
2005-11-06T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	'sudo /etc/init.d/inetd start', then run the netstat command again
2005-11-06T07:18:00.000Z	bob2	Blake_Sever	'dpkg -l netkit-inetd | tail -n' print out?
