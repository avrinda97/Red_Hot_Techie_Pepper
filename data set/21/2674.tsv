2009-07-30T19:24:00.000Z	theregoesmyeye		Curious question.. If I have just installed pulseaudio and I can see the audio output on the volume meter on padevchooser, but still no sound did i do something wrong?
2009-07-30T19:25:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	turn up the volume. Next!
2009-07-30T19:28:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	then we shall investigate further.
2009-07-30T19:28:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	what sound card do you have?
2009-07-30T19:31:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	ok, and you are getting indications that the output is indeed happening?
2009-07-30T19:33:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	ah, that's why I mentioned a usability/resource tradeoff. But yes, ICEwm is up there.
2009-07-30T19:33:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	anyway, look at alsamixer. See if that has muted you
2009-07-30T19:36:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	you look at alsamixer yet?
2009-07-30T19:36:00.000Z	theregoesmyeye	BFevola	The first thing I did when I installed ubuntu. no mutes and all volumes are up.
2009-07-30T19:37:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	ok. That's the easy things out of the way. Let's get deeper :)
2009-07-30T19:37:00.000Z	theregoesmyeye	BFevola	yay... =p
2009-07-30T19:37:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	you've probably already looked, but what's the entry for your soundcard when you do "lspci -v"?
2009-07-30T19:38:00.000Z	theregoesmyeye	BFevola	00:1e.2 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03)
2009-07-30T19:40:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	ok, I can't remember a problem with that controller offhand ... what about "aplay -l" , what does that give you?
2009-07-30T19:41:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	ok, we know it is set to the right playback device ...
2009-07-30T19:42:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	and you've looked at your amixer settings ("amixer | less") and all the settings look cool, right?
2009-07-30T19:42:00.000Z	theregoesmyeye	BFevola	All of those are fine.
2009-07-30T19:43:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	and "asoundconf list" shows the same soundcard I'm guessing?
2009-07-30T19:44:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	ok, do a quick "speaker-test" to make sure it's not the app you are using
2009-07-30T19:46:00.000Z	BFevola	theregoesmyeye	"speaker-test" doesn't work either?
2009-07-30T19:46:00.000Z	theregoesmyeye	BFevola	nothing.
