2005-07-13T09:34:00.000Z	nikkia	Suepahfly	as far as i can see in my config.log, i got a dlopen error, but it was non-fatal
2005-07-13T09:35:00.000Z	nikkia		ah
2005-07-13T09:35:00.000Z	nikkia		it tried -ldl after that
2005-07-13T09:35:00.000Z	Suepahfly		so i do "./configrue -ldl" ?

2005-07-13T09:36:00.000Z	nikkia	Suepahfly	i just did ./configure apparently
2005-07-13T09:36:00.000Z	nikkia		it gave a dlopen error, then tried again using -ldl and decided that worked
2005-07-13T09:37:00.000Z	Suepahfly		I get a bunch of lines saying dlopen is not available and the i get "configure: error: "This was fatal...aborting"
2005-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	nikkia	Suepahfly	*shrug* perhaps you're missing a -dev package
