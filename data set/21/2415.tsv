2010-02-01T12:20:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam		Hi. I'm still having a problem with installing ubuntu dual boot. When installing, if I try change the partition I'm installing into, what do I do for the following options: Use as? (do I do ext4), Mount Port? and should i format even if it has nothing on it
2010-02-01T12:20:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	use ext3  and mount point ;
2010-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	use ext3  and mount point /
2010-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	use ext3  and mount point / , and if you have one more partition, you can also use /home as another mount point
2010-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	ext3 and ext 4 are the default file systems for ubuntu
2010-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	it's Ubuntu 9.10. Isn't Ext4 meant to be better? I have other paritions for Windows
2010-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	yes suere you can use ext4
2010-02-01T12:22:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	ok. so just to reiterate: Ext4 as the file system and mount point / if that is where I want all of Ubuntu to be installed into?
2010-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	yes it's a seperate hard drive (physically) and I left it as such specifically to install Ubuntu later
2010-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	when installing windows I made sure it didn't install it at all
2010-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	do you have another empty partition created? then you can do two mount points, / and /home
2010-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	/home on separate partition is good idea in case you need to recover stuff in case of a crash
2010-02-01T12:24:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	No. I just have one other partition made. It's huge (60gig) so I'm looking ot have all of ubuntu into it
2010-02-01T12:24:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	but can i have them all together? Because i sync online anyway, so crash isn't to bad (just a pain)
2010-02-01T12:24:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	what's the swap?
2010-02-01T12:24:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	/swap is compulsory
2010-02-01T12:25:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	create a small partition of around 1 gb for this, swap is like a virtual memory thing is needed
2010-02-01T12:25:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam	indus	ah ok
2010-02-01T12:26:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	yes !
2010-02-01T12:27:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	so then, 58 gb will be / and the rest will be the swap partition
2010-02-01T12:27:00.000Z	indus	Jonathan_Glam	yes, also do remember to tick the format option for /
