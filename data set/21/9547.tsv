2007-07-29T10:50:00.000Z	poningru		and then click on your username
2007-07-29T10:50:00.000Z	poningru		and properties
2007-07-29T10:50:00.000Z	poningru		then in under user name change it
2007-07-29T10:51:00.000Z	poningru		to open files its cd filename
2007-07-29T10:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	No. That changes working directory.
2007-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	you gotta keep it in the same wording as file manager
2007-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	Why?
2007-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	What you said is completely incorrect.
2007-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	so as not to confuse the guy
2007-07-29T11:04:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	please dont tell people to google it
2007-07-29T11:05:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	Any reason, my good man?
2007-07-29T11:06:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	yes because what you did with update-alternatives was a good way to help people
2007-07-29T11:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	It's called self-help, and it's an aquired skill.
2007-07-29T11:06:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	unfortunately this is a noob channel we try to help them
2007-07-29T11:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	I only come to this channel for help when I can't find help otherwise.
2007-07-29T11:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	So, you're saying the man pages are useless?
2007-07-29T11:07:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	a noble cause, but a noob doesnt know how to read man pages
2007-07-29T11:07:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	you are not a normal end user then
2007-07-29T11:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	I guess we'd better stop writing documentation then?
2007-07-29T11:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	poningru	man pages are only useless to absolute newcomers. I expect 95% of this channel knows how to use man.
2007-07-29T11:14:00.000Z	poningru	Stormx2	thank you :)
