2010-08-03T00:56:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	i suggest if you can reconfigure your wifi router and change the password for it
2010-08-03T00:57:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	oh well for your wpa
2010-08-03T00:58:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	we cut down the trouble to your wifi router since we have no problem connecting it without security being enable on your router
2010-08-03T01:00:00.000Z	Mr	scriptwarlock	How would I change th wifi settings, the computer that we have the router on primarily has no program for it
2010-08-03T01:01:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	ha? is it 192.168.1.1?
2010-08-03T01:01:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	change your wifi routers security settings like the pasword thing
2010-08-03T01:01:00.000Z	Mr	scriptwarlock	 I use the wired connection on here like I do with my normal computer, get the ethernet cable and plug it in
2010-08-03T01:02:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	what brand of wifi router is that? cant open it on browser using the 192.168.1.1?
2010-08-03T01:07:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	if its your router then we have no problem lurking on your routers settings
2010-08-03T01:09:00.000Z	Mr	scriptwarlock	how would I do it without a program specifically designed to do it?
2010-08-03T01:09:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	can we have the brand of your wifi router
2010-08-03T01:10:00.000Z	Mr	scriptwarlock	All I know is its a netgear modem, it has no other details wrote on it (and as I say this I feel more and more stupid)
2010-08-03T01:10:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	hmm actually this is not now ubuntus problem as you mentioned earlier so are you doing this just to try your wpa?
2010-08-03T01:14:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	sweet
2010-08-03T01:18:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	Mr	time to reset your wifi router
