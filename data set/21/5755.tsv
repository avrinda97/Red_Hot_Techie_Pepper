2007-08-25T10:29:00.000Z	mattg		thx for what you have done, nomasteryoda
2007-08-25T10:31:00.000Z	mattg		anybody able to help with nvidia geforce go 7600?
2007-08-25T10:31:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	what problem are you having?
2007-08-25T10:32:00.000Z	mattg	genefitz	driver isn't working properly...generic...and it's not listed under restricted drivers
2007-08-25T10:33:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	I believe the go 7XXX series are supported under the 100.14 drivers in nvidia..
2007-08-25T10:37:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	did you just install the driver?
2007-08-25T10:38:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	have you rebooted since you installed the driver?
2007-08-25T10:38:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	okay, have you gotten the "restricted driver" notification?
2007-08-25T10:39:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	what driver did you install?
2007-08-25T10:42:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	are you sure you installed the driver correctly?
2007-08-25T10:49:00.000Z	mattg	genefitz	how do i reconfigure?
2007-08-25T11:31:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	try disabling effects.. Effects did that on my computer too. when I enabled them the title bars went away..
2007-08-25T11:32:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	for some reason it does that, what I had to do for effects is remove the native compiz and install fuzion
2007-08-25T11:33:00.000Z	mattg	genefitz	can u walk me thru that, plz?
2007-08-26T13:42:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	are you part of a network?
2007-08-26T13:43:00.000Z	mattg	genefitz	 i have no idea.  just wireless from the router
2007-08-26T13:43:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	do you have a wireless connection now? I mean, is the net running on the computer?
2007-08-26T13:44:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	if you are not using a wireless networking setup, you should not need a workgroup.
2007-08-26T13:45:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	if you are getting internet already, you shouldn't need to enter a workgroup.
2007-08-26T13:52:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	I don't want to lie to you, and I don't know much about Virtual box. all I can do is direct you to their wiki. It may have the answers you are seeking http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Technical_documentation
2007-08-26T13:53:00.000Z	genefitz	mattg	I figure you may want to try mshome or "workgroup" see if one of those may do the trick
