2012-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	it's PasswordAuthentication (case matters)
2012-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	It was originally commented out.  I only removed the #
2012-02-19T02:27:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	that's because you took too long probably....try again
2012-02-19T02:28:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	ssh localhost - 2802 asks me for a password.
2012-02-19T02:29:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	then give it the password
2012-02-19T02:29:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	permission denied :-\
2012-02-19T02:29:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	try again, make sure the user and password are correct.
2012-02-19T02:30:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	doesn't ask me for a username
2012-02-19T02:30:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	ssh username@localhost -p 2802
2012-02-19T02:30:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	if it's still not working add a -v to see some debugging output
2012-02-19T02:30:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	my original question was trying to figure out how to setup that password
2012-02-19T02:31:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	it's whatever the user's login password is
2012-02-19T02:31:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	there isn't a different password for login and ssh, they are the same
2012-02-19T02:31:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	how did you define the user?
2012-02-19T02:32:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	AllowUser directive in ssh-config
2012-02-19T02:32:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	AllowUsers i should say
2012-02-19T02:32:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	umm, the user has to exist in the system
2012-02-19T02:32:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	try: adduser username
2012-02-19T02:32:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	umm, sudo adduser usernamer
2012-02-19T02:37:00.000Z	Apollo	ssta	Well I feel thoroughly stupid now.  But I did get in from my windows client now
2012-02-19T02:37:00.000Z	ssta	Apollo	no worries...we all feel stupid sometimes.  Enjoy :)
