2005-06-22T10:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		use vorbis
2005-06-22T10:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		nope.
2005-06-22T10:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		they are just a text string.
2005-06-22T10:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		maybe in mp3, which is an inferior and stupid technology
2005-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		no it's not common sense.
2005-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		and common sense isn't always right.
2005-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i use all caps for everything on my system that i possibly can, and my web site.  it looks easier to read to me.
2005-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i'm used to it.
2005-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		capital letters do to have shapes.
2005-06-22T10:16:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		prove that.
2005-06-22T10:16:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	the letters may have shapes, but it takes away the shape of the entire word.  For instance, the shape for Look is different that the shape for LOOK
2005-06-22T10:18:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	in your mind the text DOES have volume
2005-06-22T10:18:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	_nate__	that's stupid.
2005-06-22T10:18:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	no, its not
2005-06-22T10:18:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	_nate__	when i read text, i never associate a "volume" with it.  it's not sound.
2005-06-22T10:19:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	yes there is
2005-06-22T10:20:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	subconsciously it has volume, as you read over a word without actually reading every single letter
2005-06-22T10:20:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	thats how we read, not by sounding out words but by the shape and letter contents within a word
2005-06-22T10:21:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	_nate__	we read by shapes, yes.
2005-06-22T10:21:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	_nate__	if you were raised reading all caps, you'd be used to it.
2005-06-22T10:22:00.000Z	_nate__	BROKEN_LADDER	were you raised reading and writing all caps?
