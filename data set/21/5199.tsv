2007-12-08T08:28:00.000Z	meoblast		does anyone know of a screen recorder that writes a commonly used filetype?
2007-12-08T08:29:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	did that work?
2007-12-08T08:29:00.000Z	meoblast		did what work?
2007-12-08T08:29:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	conversion is not an issue.. the command i sent you
2007-12-08T08:30:00.000Z	meoblast	chowmeined	it "converted" but for some reason... it wasnt readable by anything... just like an OGG.... hmmm
2007-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	well ogg should be readable on any linux box.. or by anyone who has VLC .. or ffdshow
2007-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	you tried the second command i gave you?
2007-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	meoblast		idk

2007-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -acodec mp3 -vcodec mpeg4 somefile.avi

2007-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	meoblast		one that writes to direct avi
2007-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	why? ... the ogg libraries work well.. just convert it
2007-12-08T08:32:00.000Z	chowmeined	meoblast	it will work.. it just takes a little tweaking
