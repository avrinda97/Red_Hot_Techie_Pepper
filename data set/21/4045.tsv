2008-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	rexus		is there any place where I can download all the packages which don't include in the CD installation?
2008-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	you want to create repo mirror? that is around 45GB
2008-07-24T11:12:00.000Z	rexus		no, I don't want to create a repo mirror, I want to put it in a DVD...
2008-07-24T11:12:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	from your current install, to replicate on another machine? consider aptoncd then
2008-07-24T11:13:00.000Z	rexus		no.. I'm going to do a fresh install here..
2008-07-24T11:14:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	you want a custom installer then?
2008-07-24T11:14:00.000Z	rexus		yes correct bazzie
2008-07-24T11:15:00.000Z	bazzie		!remaster | rexus check these
2008-07-24T11:15:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	can make it dvd size if you include enough packages
2008-07-24T11:15:00.000Z	rexus		oww.. ic ic...
2008-07-24T11:16:00.000Z	rexus		I don't need Live CD, just the same one like the 700MB one but I need to add more packages for myself and need to put it into a DVD
2008-07-24T11:17:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	the uck is the most user-friendly imo
2008-07-24T11:17:00.000Z	rexus	bazzie	let me check that out.. hopefully I can do it ASAP :)
2008-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	have fun :)
2008-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	rexus	bazzie	here is said that "UCK is a tool that helps you customizing official Ubuntu Live CDs"
2008-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	rexus		but I don't want a Live CD
2008-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	bazzie		!info uck
2008-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	rexus		I want the full installed one
2008-07-24T11:19:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	you choose what you want and customize an iso; it will be bigger than cd size as you are adding packages
2008-07-24T11:20:00.000Z	rexus		so it wont be just a Live CD right?
2008-07-24T11:20:00.000Z	bazzie	rexus	read the links :)
