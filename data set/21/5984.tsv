2007-07-28T11:42:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	gnome-system-monitor
2007-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	not much but aptitude has a couple more supported features
2007-07-28T12:14:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-07-28T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	hmm probably need gettext development libraries or something
2007-07-28T12:16:00.000Z	Zasch	xtknight	How to I get this?
2007-07-28T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	i actually had that problem before and it was a nightmare (not to discouage you or anything :) )
2007-07-28T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	i thought i read gettext was part of libc-dev and it wasnt on ubuntu... or something
2007-07-28T12:17:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	because it's called gaim in Feisty
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	they aren't included because they dont fit on the cd
2007-07-28T12:19:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	seeing a pattern here?
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	does it use automake?
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	well does ./autogen.sh exist?
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	Zasch	xtknight	If it did, where would it be?
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	root of the app youre compilimh
2007-07-28T12:28:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	personally i like using "simple socket file transfer" with WINE
2007-07-28T12:28:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	that's what i do with my other friend on AIM
2007-07-28T12:29:00.000Z	Zasch	xtknight	What is this? (You are speaking to a comlpete newbie, by the way)
2007-07-28T12:29:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	oh just google it.  it's a windows app that's very simple
2007-07-28T12:30:00.000Z	xtknight	Zasch	it's easy for the windows guy.  he just runs the app and types in the IP info...  for you, you install WINE ("sudo apt-get install wine").  this allows you to run some simple windows programs.  then you run it with wine.  "wine ssft.exe".  ssft.exe is the name of "simple socket file tranfer" program
