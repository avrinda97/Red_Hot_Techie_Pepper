2011-04-04T12:39:00.000Z	Guest82426		we have wifi. i do not want the students to see the wpa key. how should i do?
2011-04-04T12:41:00.000Z	Guest82426		i just want to avoid the students to click and see the key to copy it and use their smartphones
2011-04-04T12:41:00.000Z	Guest82426		cause if i right click properties under gnome, i can see everything.
2011-04-04T12:41:00.000Z	Guest82426		they should use these computers.
2011-04-04T12:42:00.000Z	Guest82426		i know, i d just like for them not be able to see the key
2011-04-04T12:42:00.000Z	Guest82426		mmmmm yes they can
2011-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Guest82426		once they re connected,
2011-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Guest82426		they can just right click and see the wpa key
2011-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Guest82426		that s it. i don t want them to COPY the key for other devices
2011-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Guest82426		is there a way?
2011-04-04T12:44:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	there should be, im not sure if wicd does it
2011-04-04T12:41:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	gnome stores it, it doesn't give it out
2011-04-04T12:42:00.000Z	Guest82426	ruan	right click and you see it
2011-04-04T12:42:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	yes but you're on the network, it stores the key for it
2011-04-04T12:42:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	hmm
2011-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	they can't connect without the key
2011-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Guest82426	ruan	ok:
2011-04-04T12:57:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	does the wicd connection manager show the key?
2011-04-04T12:57:00.000Z	Guest82426	ruan	i don t use it right now: they just have to run the default one, ... easy trick
2011-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	yes but if you remove the default one and use wicd
2011-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	ruan	Guest82426	ok listen to llutz_
