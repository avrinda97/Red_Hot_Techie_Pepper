2009-11-01T09:36:00.000Z	wip		karmic is nice! the only thing is the #%@# keyring manager for everything: cpufreqselector, to open empathy... how to remove the password pop-up???
2009-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	wip		i want to be root, without being root for X11!!!
2009-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	Why do you want to be root?
2009-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	i don't want to be ask my password to use cpufreqselector or open empathy... damsn keyring manager...
2009-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	The Empathy thing is separate. That's unlocking your keyring, which is encrypted.
2009-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	what if i don't care about security, can i disable keyring manager?
2009-11-01T09:40:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	You are crazy, but Application->Accesories->Passwords and Encryption Keys. Right click on the login keyring, select Change Password, and leave the new password box blank.
2009-11-01T09:40:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	i have nothing to hide!
2009-11-01T09:47:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	what about cpufreqselector, how to avoid the password pop-up?
2009-11-01T09:47:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	Not sure about that one. That uses PolicyKit
2009-11-01T09:47:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	i tried to chmod +s it, no success
2009-11-01T09:48:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	!!!!!! making things setuid on a hunch is *not* a good idea.
2009-11-01T09:48:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	as you can see, i don't really care about the risk
2009-11-01T09:49:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	i used to be root for X11 for about 5 years without beign hacked...
2009-11-01T09:49:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	nobody cares about me :)
2009-11-01T09:49:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	You are extremely unwise.
2009-11-01T09:50:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	don't you agree that asking a password to change the cpu frequency is unwise, i mean... i am logged in!
2009-11-01T09:50:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	Certainly, that is suboptimal.
2009-11-01T09:51:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	keyring / policykit is not needed at all. if someone is logged in... well i don't see why bothering with password...
2009-11-01T09:52:00.000Z	wip	wgrant	just choose a big password for your login
2009-11-01T09:53:00.000Z	wgrant	wip	The keyring is there to prevent physical attackers from getting at your passwords.
