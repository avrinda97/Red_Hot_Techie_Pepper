2012-01-26T01:31:00.000Z	theva	ActionParsnip	I guess you are right, how do I turn all those loggin in and out messages off?

2012-01-26T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theva	http://i.clintecker.com/disable-irc-msgs.html
2012-01-26T01:33:00.000Z	theva	ActionParsnip	but I really do not have anything to say about any other client, I have only used that
2012-01-26T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theva	there is no 'preferred' app for anything, there are options. Try a few and see what you like, when you find one, use it. If you like xchat use it.

2012-01-26T01:34:00.000Z	theva	ActionParsnip	I agree with you

2012-01-26T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theva	yes, lxde is available in the Oneiric repos
2012-01-26T01:50:00.000Z	theva	ActionParsnip	I guess there is a reason why you dont use it but, is it good any way?
2012-01-26T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theva	I just like LXDE,been using it the last 3 or 4 releases
2012-01-26T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theva	Unity is a love or hate deal dude
2012-01-26T01:52:00.000Z	theva	ActionParsnip	I hate it.. :P I have a netbook so the lxde might do some good for the performance I think, will try it out! :)
