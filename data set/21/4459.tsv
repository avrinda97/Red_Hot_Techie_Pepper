2008-05-12T13:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	all i know is i got the same problem... I'd love to hear the solution
2008-05-12T13:57:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	did you do as i did following the ubuntu guide to disable it? i spoke with someone else who did the exact same thing and has resolved the issue
2008-05-12T13:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	i wasn't aware of any 'guide' I went to system/preference/sound and switched from 'autodetect' to Alsa
2008-05-12T13:59:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	that was the guide :)
2008-05-12T13:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	i was watching a movie on vlc put it on pause to see something on tv , half hour later when i resumed there was no sound
2008-05-12T13:59:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	do you watch tv on your pc? tvpc?
2008-05-12T13:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	oh, ok then... well, it fixed nothing over here
2008-05-12T13:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	no, that was tv separate from pc
2008-05-12T14:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	and no one seems to know what to do? :/
2008-05-12T14:00:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	did you open something else in ubuntu that was using sound? i'm sure my issue is the driver isn't sharing sound across multiple applications - pulseaudio blows
2008-05-12T14:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	certainly not initially. I just went back to vlc and hit resume
2008-05-12T14:01:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	i'm always here so lets keep each other up to date with any progress
2008-05-12T14:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	i then put a different hard disc into laptop with xp on it... and via wubi installed xubuntu... but xubuntu would crash everytime i tried to access external hard drive and play a movie or any media
2008-05-12T14:02:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	breakfast
2008-05-12T14:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	ok... well, i've just burned a new Hardy on disc . My previous install was an upgrade from Gutsy... i presume the sound issues to have totalled my install and just gonna do a fresh install and take it from there
2008-05-12T14:03:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	don't be so hasty
2008-05-12T14:06:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	what do you mean not so hasty?
2008-05-12T14:07:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	i mean don't rush a reinstall - you may still find a solution and it will be twice as frustrating if you reinstall and it happens again
2008-05-12T14:08:00.000Z	livingdaylight	laeg	i'd love it if there was a solution
2008-05-12T14:08:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	let me know if you find one
2008-05-12T14:11:00.000Z	laeg	livingdaylight	i didn't tell you that pulse audio was your problem, you told me that ;)
