2011-02-28T01:30:00.000Z	[thor]		I am using Ubuntu 10.10, and have just been automatically (without interaction) logged off, and dropped to the user login screen. Can anyone tell me where i would check for logs of recent activity or errors?
2011-02-28T01:31:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	it would be easier to diagnose the problem if we knew what you were doing prior to being logged out
2011-02-28T01:32:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	i was viewing a webpage using Chromium, downloading torrents using Deluge, chatting on IRC using XChat, and monitoring usage with Top.
2011-02-28T01:33:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	did the web page have flash on it or make use of any third party plugins?
2011-02-28T01:33:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	not sure, but re-opening it after logging back in did not cause a logoff.
2011-02-28T01:35:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	I've had sites that use a lot of flash advertisements cause me to get logged out because it crashed X-server
2011-02-28T01:36:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	checking this one, it has 4 flash-based banners
2011-02-28T01:37:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	It could be any number of things... if you can post the last 20 or so lines from /var/log/Xorg.0.log to pastebin that would help
2011-02-28T01:41:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	the end of that log shows nothing but input device connections
2011-02-28T01:42:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	the time stamps are actually from boot time, 0 seconds from boot is the start

2011-02-28T01:48:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	i have Xorg.0.log thru Xorg.5.log , is that a sequential naming scheme? should i be pasting Xorg.5.log ?
2011-02-28T01:49:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	Xorg.0.log.old ends with a Segmentation Fault error logged...
2011-02-28T01:50:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	anything prior to that seg fault line?

2011-02-28T01:52:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	it would appear something was attempting to change your screen resolution just prior to crashing
2011-02-28T01:52:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	were you trying to make something go full screen?
2011-02-28T01:54:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	nope.. i had just viewed the webpage, and grabbed the scrollbar.. and the screen flashed purple ( plymouth? ) and then the login dialog came up
2011-02-28T01:54:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	I'm suspecting it's an isolated incident... Unless this is continually happening I wouldn't worry too much about it
2011-02-28T01:55:00.000Z	[thor]	pragmaticenigma	at least i know where to look for clues next time. thanks for the help
2011-02-28T01:56:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	[thor]	no prob... it might have just been a system maintence script that just triggered the wrong response or modeprobe had a hiccup
