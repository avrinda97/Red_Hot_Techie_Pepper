2012-11-17T01:13:00.000Z	bekks	varunpriolkar	So what are you trying to do?
2012-11-17T01:13:00.000Z	varunpriolkar	bekks	create an image for raspberry pi
2012-11-17T01:14:00.000Z	bekks	varunpriolkar	Because...? Dont you want to image the whole partitions?
2012-11-17T01:15:00.000Z	varunpriolkar	bekks	i do.. but i dont want the unpartitioned space.. i want dd to read only the first x blocks
2012-11-17T01:15:00.000Z	bekks	varunpriolkar	Everything that can be seen in your paste is partitioned.
2012-11-17T01:16:00.000Z	varunpriolkar	bekks	nah.. those are just the mounted partitions..
2012-11-17T01:17:00.000Z	bekks	varunpriolkar	Then image then - after unmounting them. You'll have no unpartitioned space in your image.
2012-11-17T01:21:00.000Z	varunpriolkar	bekks	well i dont think thatll work.. from what i have seen on other forums..
2012-11-17T01:22:00.000Z	bekks	varunpriolkar	All you need in addition is an image of the MBR, too. So basically sdb1, sdb2 and the first 512 bytes of sdb,
2012-11-17T01:23:00.000Z	varunpriolkar	bekks	correct...
2012-11-17T01:57:00.000Z	varunpriolkar	bekks	thanks man! problem solved
