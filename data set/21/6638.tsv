2007-09-17T08:19:00.000Z	Pelo	n-iCe	 fluxbox, bluebox, xfce , i think those are the light ones, but I 've never used any of them
2007-10-03T08:56:00.000Z	Pelo	n-iCe	 just open synaptic ,  search for gstreamer  and isntall all the gstreamer0.10 packages  you'll be covered

2007-10-03T09:01:00.000Z	Pelo	n-iCe	 gstreamer are codecs you don,T need to set the files to it,  all the players can use them
2008-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	n-iCe	it's a decorator issue in compiz,  open the advance effects manager and check the decorator box

2008-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	Pelo	n-iCe	not quite sure how,  check in gconf-editor under apps/metacity ,  therer is probably a box to check
2008-04-09T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	n-iCe	or you might just have to reselect a theme
