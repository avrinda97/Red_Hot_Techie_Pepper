2009-08-06T01:37:00.000Z	Keiffer		Hi. I want to ssh in to my machine from another PC. how that can be done?
2009-08-06T01:37:00.000Z	Keiffer		!ui ssh
2009-08-06T01:37:00.000Z	Keiffer		!ssh
2009-08-06T01:37:00.000Z	iceroot	Keiffer	install ssh-server (sudo apt-get install openssh-server) then type ssh user@host
2009-08-06T01:38:00.000Z	Keiffer	iceroot	and how can I be sure that nobody will bruteforce the login?
2009-08-06T01:38:00.000Z	iceroot	Keiffer	using a different port
2009-08-06T01:38:00.000Z	iceroot	Keiffer	also have a look at fail2ban
2009-08-06T01:42:00.000Z	Keiffer	iceroot	thanks :D
2009-08-06T01:46:00.000Z	iceroot	Keiffer	just use a good keyword and use another ssh port, then you dont have to be afraid
2009-08-06T01:48:00.000Z	Keiffer	iceroot	ok, thanks. any way to test after finishing to see if it will work?
2009-08-06T01:49:00.000Z	iceroot	Keiffer	you mean fail2ban?
