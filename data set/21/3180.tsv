2009-09-21T06:35:00.000Z	epaphus		hello, where is the X config located? my ubuntu has detcted an "unknown" monitor that is really causing conflicts and i need to remove it...
2009-09-21T06:35:00.000Z	epaphus		iam unable to remove it through the GUI panel
2009-09-21T06:37:00.000Z	kejava	epaphus	sounds like you want /etc/X11/xorg.conf but yours is most likely empty
2009-09-21T06:39:00.000Z	epaphus	kejava	why would mine be empty?
2009-09-21T06:41:00.000Z	epaphus	kejava	its not empty.. but it is very simple...  how can I remove that screen that it dected..
2009-09-21T06:41:00.000Z	kejava	epaphus	with the newer versions of X,  they're "bullet proof" and no longer need configuration.  it should be empty now.  you still have the option to force some parameters in there.  btw, mine is empty.
2009-09-21T06:42:00.000Z	kejava	epaphus	got any "screen" sections in your config?  may need to remove or edit them.
2009-09-21T06:42:00.000Z	epaphus	kejava	i only have one...
2009-09-21T06:42:00.000Z	epaphus		the problem is i need to start my laptop with a HDMI cable because if not the screen will show distorted
2009-09-21T06:42:00.000Z	kejava	epaphus	paste bin the file so we can see it
2009-09-21T06:42:00.000Z	epaphus		any change i do in the screen resolution panel doesnt take effect

2009-09-21T06:46:00.000Z	kejava	epaphus	try commenting out "Virtual 2304 800".  that part may cause issues.  other than that, you have nothing else in there that can do much.  is this a crt or lcd monitor?
2009-09-21T06:46:00.000Z	epaphus	kejava	its a laptop.. ill try renaming the file
2009-09-21T06:46:00.000Z	epaphus		so it creates one

2009-09-21T06:47:00.000Z	kejava	epaphus	you can also try completely deleting the contents of the file
