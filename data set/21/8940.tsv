2005-12-12T16:54:00.000Z	sanjay		it gives me error W: Couldn't stat source package list when i try to apt-get update (after installing most repositories) -- can someone help me with this ?
2005-12-12T16:54:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	put the complete output on the pastebin
2005-12-12T16:55:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	url for pastebin, pls ..
2005-12-12T16:57:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	posted .. (i editted my sources.list file as well - i probably messed up something there or some repositories not working -- but i cant figure out which... lemme know if u want me to paste stuff from sources.list)
2005-12-12T16:58:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	that's not the complete output
2005-12-12T16:58:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	apt-get update spits out much more
2005-12-12T16:58:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	ya, thats just the errors ...
2005-12-12T16:59:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	the complete output please
2005-12-12T17:03:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	looks like your sources.list contains a few errors, could you paste that file on the bin please
2005-12-12T17:03:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	sure..
2005-12-12T17:06:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	hmm, that sources.list looks ok
2005-12-12T17:07:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/*{P,S,R}*
2005-12-12T17:07:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	i had messed with it earlier -- using the repositories from the ubuntuguide.org which were bad -- i removed the references, but i think that might be the root of the error ..
2005-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	sudo rm /var .... gave me error - pasted in bin ... shud i still retry apt-get update ?
2005-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	yes
2005-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	gave me pretty much the same errors : (
2005-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	do you want me to re-paste this output ?
2005-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	- on the other hand, these errors dont seem to be affecting my ability to install packages too much - shud i just ignore it for now ?
2005-12-12T17:23:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	anything to help with the repository issue ? (or should i just wait till i have 5.10 ...) ?
2005-12-12T17:25:00.000Z	Seveas	sanjay	you can safely ignore the errors, maybe it's a problem at the server
2005-12-12T17:26:00.000Z	sanjay	Seveas	cool : ) - thanks a million, again ....
