2006-06-20T11:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 this is linux anything is doable.. if ya want to work at it.
2007-07-02T10:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 I think it shut down the ubuntu part. due to lack of a maintainer. but aint checkd in it in ages.
2007-07-02T10:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	  with the severas and mediatubuntu repos.. I dont see much need for plf :)
2007-07-19T09:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 give it a different icon..        a blury icon is not the end of the world...
2007-07-19T09:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 its proberly enarging a small icon then. find the icon, load it in gimp , enlarge it. edit it. tweak it.. have fun.
2007-07-19T09:56:00.000Z	Some_Person	dr_willis	but its an svg, shouldnt it be scalable
2007-07-19T09:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 proberly should.. but i dont mess with svg icons when i make my icons.
2007-07-19T09:56:00.000Z	Some_Person	dr_willis	and if its the same icon screen resolution uses, shouldn't it look exactly the same?
2007-07-19T09:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 i just work on my own Porn Icon Collection. :)
2007-07-19T09:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	Some_Person	 aparently its not.. so theres somthing going on. Either its deciding to use a different icon, or its converting it badly.
