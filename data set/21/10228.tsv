2005-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	kangpeh		Greetings, friends.
2005-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	kangpeh		I am approximately 71% decided on switching to Ubuntu, from Fedora Core 3.
2005-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	kangpeh		However, a few circumstances will be governing my decision.
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	kangpeh		As such, I was wondering if anyone would be able to answer a few simple questions - of which I know not the answer to.
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	t3rror_	kangpeh	i would suggest going with it
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	 Would it be possible, if you could advise me, as to the packaging support in Ubuntu?
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	t3rror_	kangpeh	it is great
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	t3rror_		apt-get
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	t3rror_		using symaptic is even easier
2005-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	Most all popular open source software, I have found, has .RPM packages for Fedora Core 3.
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	Doth Ubuntu have such support by the community?
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	t3rror_		yes
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	 In other words, let's say I find some software - if I google for it, I can find Fedora Core 3 built RPM packages.
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	t3rror_		name some apps
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	MPlayer
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	t3rror_		if they are mainstream (ie. popular) then they will be
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	t3rror_		yes
2005-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	Gnome, Epiphany, Thunderbird, X-Chat, GAIM,  Gnome Meeting, Open Office, etc - t33ror_?
2005-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	 Finally, wine, VLC Media Player, etc.
2005-04-19T13:45:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	 WhenI look at, for instance, http://www.videolan.org/vlc - I notice there are no packages listed for Ubuntu. :(
2005-04-19T13:46:00.000Z	kangpeh	t3rror_	 Will any debian package work for Ubuntu?
