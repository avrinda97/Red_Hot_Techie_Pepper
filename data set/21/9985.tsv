2005-06-07T09:55:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	too complex for me. :-)  i like how it can download for example all jpegs on a site.
2005-06-07T09:55:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	gwget
2005-06-07T09:57:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	yw
2005-06-16T09:03:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	lol
2005-06-16T12:03:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	how so?
2005-06-16T12:03:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	one example is HowardG
2005-06-16T12:04:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	HowardG (~Howard@tide002.microsoft.com)
2005-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	oh.  that's interesting then.  what channel was he in?
2005-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	try doing a whois
2005-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	there's others on freenode too, it's interesting. I wonder why they're here.
2005-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	he's talking in #kernel-panic right now
2005-06-16T12:10:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	closet linux users perhaps?
2005-06-16T12:11:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	...perhaps..
2005-06-16T12:11:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	but if that was true, why would they be here on .microsoft.com ?
2005-06-16T12:13:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	exactly.  i'm sure there's a way to alter the user domain.  might be a joke.  but who'd do it without adding "sucks" or something to it?
2005-06-16T12:15:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	ask him his job at microsoft, he will answer. I don't think it's a joke. if it is, it's an odd one. googling for that domain yields little results, just hits on websites for the most part. Odd.
2005-06-16T12:16:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	have you done a CTCP version?  what irc client is he using? :-)
2005-06-16T12:18:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	you could tell us all if you did a version. :)
2005-06-16T12:19:00.000Z	lotusleaf	reka	not that I'm suggesting it. =)
2005-06-16T12:19:00.000Z	reka	lotusleaf	no, i'm a coward.  :-)
