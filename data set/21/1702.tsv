2011-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	install to a seperate partition and the installer will sort out grub
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	what do you mean by "sort out"?
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	I mean it does it for you, updates grub
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	just choose to install grub and it will detect the other os (10.04)
2011-01-07T15:09:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	soreau ok. thank you. i have grub on an extra partition, so it seems reasonable, that 10.10 will overwrite my current grub with grub2 from 10.10
2011-01-07T15:09:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	it is very easy... I suggest cloning your existing disk just as a backup for future use, always wise to have a backup
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	no, no need to update, AFAIK that IS grub 2 ;)
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	although it says GNU GRUB 1.98-1ubuntu9?
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	yeah
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	XD
2011-01-07T15:11:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	it is version 1.98 of grub2
2011-01-07T15:12:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	like I said, just do the install of the OS to another partition, then choose to install grub where you want it and the installer looks for your other odler OS and does it all for you
2011-01-07T15:12:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	fair enough
2011-01-07T15:13:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	yeah, why not boot an actual install?
2011-01-07T15:14:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	did you check for errors?
2011-01-07T15:15:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux
2011-01-07T15:16:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	this is the site i follow, but the information about the grub modifications was not sufficient for me
2011-01-07T15:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	my netbook is quite weak, so virtual box is not really an option. also my things like drivers and stuff can not be testet in a virtualbox.
2011-01-07T15:19:00.000Z	neurochrome	Benkinooby	ah ok
2011-01-07T15:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	i just read the wholes site... i think i will go with the "chroot"-way ... reminds me of good old gentoo (it was a mistake to use gentoo as first linux to play with)
2011-01-07T15:41:00.000Z	Benkinooby	neurochrome	soreau i know that gentoo, arch and slack are know for the minimalistic approach, but i don't think i am still not experienced enought to mess with them (i only have that netbook and really need it)
