2006-01-27T14:17:00.000Z	kenoutten		hi folks, you're really going to have to draw it out in crayon - my cdrw says i'm not the owner so i cant change the permission - help
2006-01-27T14:19:00.000Z	kenoutten		when you say use "sudo" what exactly do i input?
2006-01-27T14:20:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	you type "sudo" before you type the actual command
2006-01-27T14:21:00.000Z	kenoutten		ok, what would the command be
2006-01-27T14:21:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	i just came in here... what are you trying to do?
2006-01-27T14:21:00.000Z	kenoutten	skulltula	i'm trying to get permission to write with my cdrw
2006-01-27T14:23:00.000Z	kenoutten	skulltula	i guess what i need to do is "add" myself to the cdrom group or some such thing
2006-01-27T14:25:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	i haven't done this before, but i'm reading up
2006-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	kenoutten	skulltula	ok
2006-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	skulltula		this is what i'm looking at right now, http://ubuntuguide.org/#blankcdrwdvdrw
2006-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	kenoutten	skulltula	i'll take a look too...
2006-01-27T14:28:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	the second question should answer how to actually write, but the permissions to do it might be in your fstab settings...
2006-01-27T14:29:00.000Z	kenoutten		skulltula" fstab settings?
2006-01-27T14:29:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	that's where all the permenent mount settings are kept, with file permissions included.
2006-01-27T14:30:00.000Z	skulltula		(as far as i know the file)
2006-01-27T14:30:00.000Z	kenoutten	skulltula	ok, how do i navigate to it?
2006-01-27T14:30:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	you should try burning without going into fstab, though... at least before talking to someone who knows more than me.
2006-01-27T14:30:00.000Z	skulltula		<---n00b
2006-01-27T14:31:00.000Z	skulltula		i think you can look at fstab by writing "cat /etc/fstab/" in a terminal
2006-01-27T14:32:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	it would only be there if it mounts on boot, though, i think.
2006-01-27T14:35:00.000Z	skulltula	kenoutten	good luck... i gotta reboot
