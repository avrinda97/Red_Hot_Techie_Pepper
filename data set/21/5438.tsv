2007-10-14T12:22:00.000Z	Athreya		i am a complete noob with ubuntu...i need help
2007-10-14T12:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	you've found the right place, ask your questions
2007-10-14T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	what type of partition, ntfs maybe?
2007-10-14T12:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	was it a windows partition (that's ntfs)
2007-10-14T12:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	ah, ok. Where did you mount it?
2007-10-14T12:29:00.000Z	Athreya	nickrud	sda5
2007-10-14T12:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	no, that's the partition device. When you navigate to it in the file manager, what's the directory?
2007-10-14T12:30:00.000Z	Athreya	nickrud	/media/sda5
2007-10-14T12:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	ok, you want to use that as a storage disk, right?
2007-10-14T12:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	if so, do    sudo chown <usrname>:<username> /media/sda5
2007-10-14T12:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	any terminal will do, that's what sudo is for
2007-10-14T12:33:00.000Z	Athreya	nickrud	: error "no such file or directory"
2007-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	mistype, either you or me:    sudo chmod <you>:<you> /media/sda5
2007-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	Athreya	nickrud	please bear with me. I am learning...
2007-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	chown, you were right :)
2007-10-14T12:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	I always mistype those two for some reason
2007-10-14T12:37:00.000Z	Athreya	nickrud	where do i type that
2007-10-14T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	in applications->accessories->Terminal , the window that opens
2007-10-14T12:45:00.000Z	Athreya	nickrud	& jotil : would any changes to the settings in the drive properties help sort this out?
2007-10-14T12:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Athreya	I'm only sort of here, I'm glad jotil took over. Just follow him :)
