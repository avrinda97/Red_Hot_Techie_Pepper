2011-11-27T22:21:00.000Z	blz		Hello, I rather suddenly began getting piss-poor performance when accessing files on an NTFS partition.  I'm not sure how to go about fixing this... any advice?
2011-11-27T22:21:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	defrag it?
2011-11-27T22:22:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	done.  Either way the problem only occurs under ubuntu
2011-11-27T22:22:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	make sure youre using the ntfs-3g drivers
2011-11-27T22:22:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	also done
2011-11-27T22:23:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	and this is a problem with *reading* files, not writing, strangely enough
2011-11-27T22:24:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	not sure then, a reboot might help?
2011-11-27T22:24:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	if you don't know that's okay but suggesting a reboot isn't very constructive
2011-11-27T22:26:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	you would be surprised how many times that helped
2011-11-27T22:26:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	sure, but like I said before, I tried defragging it under windows and it performs just fine under windows.  Both of these statements imply a reboot
2011-11-27T22:27:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	not necessarily, but I can understand how you think that would be the case
2011-11-27T22:30:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	What is the % free space on the used partition?
2011-11-27T22:30:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	let me check real quick
2011-11-27T22:31:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	about 60% full
2011-11-27T22:33:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	an ssd -_-
2011-11-27T22:33:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	that makes a huge difference
2011-11-27T22:33:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	yeah forgot to mention that bit
2011-11-27T22:33:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	fragmentation doesnt exist on SSD's
2011-11-27T22:34:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	sure it does.  It just gets accessed in constant time.
2011-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	blz	Im not sure, but try mounting it with noatime
2011-11-27T22:36:00.000Z	blz	MeQuerSat	yep I tried that too.  noatime and nodiratime (although I believe the latter is implied by the former...)
