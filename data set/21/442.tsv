2011-12-14T21:46:00.000Z	mainecoon		why does a X terminal user not show in who or w list?
2011-12-14T21:47:00.000Z	mainecoon		I mean when u open up "Terminal" and type who or w, I don't see myself...does anybody know why?
2011-12-14T21:49:00.000Z	mainecoon		if I use xterm then I can see myself logged into a shell though
2011-12-14T21:49:00.000Z	mainecoon		But not when I use Ubuntu "Terminal"
2011-12-14T21:51:00.000Z	mainecoon		The Ubuntu Terminal is "xfce4-terminal"
2011-12-14T21:53:00.000Z	mainecoon		but how to get "w" to work?
2011-12-14T21:53:00.000Z	mainecoon		And can u explain the mechanism of why it doesnt show the terminal user?

2011-12-14T21:56:00.000Z	mainecoon	puff	THANX!!
2011-12-14T22:05:00.000Z	mainecoon	puff	how is xfce4-terminal related to LightDM though?
2011-12-14T22:16:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Are you still on that?
2011-12-14T22:17:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Yes?
2011-12-14T22:17:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	It might be useful, then, for you to google on something like  "what is lightdm"
2011-12-14T22:18:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Also, I should point out that you're using xfce because you're using xubuntu-desktop, so #xubuntu might be more helpful.
2011-12-14T22:19:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	lightDM is a display manager (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM).  It's sort of the underpinnings of the GUI.
2011-12-14T22:19:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	So your windowmanager runs on X and X is managed by lightDM.
2011-12-14T22:20:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Because lightDM runs X and the display manager, when you to go login, you're actually talking to lightDM, and then lightDM starts up X and Unity (or in your case, XFCE).
2011-12-14T22:21:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Ergo, housekeeping related to your X login is done by lightDM.  Part of that housekeeping is that lightDM is supposed to udpate utmp, but apparently it doesn't.  utmp is where who/w looks to see who's logged in.
2011-12-14T22:21:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Obviously one terminal does update utmp, the other doesn't.
2011-12-14T22:22:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	see  https://lists.launchpad.net/desktop-packages/msg32679.html and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-terminal/+bug/861388
2011-12-14T22:23:00.000Z	puff	mainecoon	Any way you slice it, it's because of a bug. It doesn't seem to be a showstopper.
