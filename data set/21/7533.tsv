2007-06-11T12:30:00.000Z	solowlr		how do I automatically mount a second hard drive (IDE1) in ubuntu?
2007-06-11T12:30:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	you need to edit /etc/fstab
2007-06-11T12:30:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	what filesystem is your second harddrive?
2007-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	solowlr	Bluhd	my second hard drive is brand new, I want to format it and use it for media storage
2007-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	yes, but with what file system?
2007-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	you can format it as EXT2, EXT3, FAT32, etc
2007-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	solowlr	Bluhd	I'm guessing EXT3 is the best choice...?
2007-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	probably
2007-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	your hard drive is probably /dev/hdb1, right?
2007-06-11T12:36:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	where do you want to mount it?
2007-06-11T12:37:00.000Z	solowlr	Bluhd	I'd like to mount it on /var/media
2007-06-11T12:37:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	ok then
2007-06-11T12:37:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	$ sudo mkdir /var/media if it doesn't exist already
2007-06-11T12:39:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	do you know how to manually mount a drive?
2007-06-11T12:40:00.000Z	solowlr	Bluhd	yes but I think I've got to format the new drive first
2007-06-11T12:40:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	well, actually, you should format it as ext3 first
2007-06-11T12:40:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	yeah, there's a tool in System->Administration I think
2007-06-11T12:44:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	here's a good thing to do:
2007-06-11T12:44:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	run this: $ sudo apt-get install gparted
2007-06-11T12:44:00.000Z	Bluhd	solowlr	it should allow you to easily manipulate partitions, I'm not sure if it allows you to add automounting lines
2007-06-11T12:45:00.000Z	solowlr	Bluhd	excellent, thanks
