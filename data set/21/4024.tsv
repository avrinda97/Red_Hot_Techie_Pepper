2009-01-31T21:04:00.000Z	|TheBarold|		anyone wanna help troubleshoot installing Gnomad2
2009-01-31T21:06:00.000Z	|TheBarold|		installed Gnomad2 from .deb and still get an error "gnomad2: error while loading shared libraries: libmtp.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
2009-01-31T21:08:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	hm.. a package search came up w/ only this option for intrepid: http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/libmtp-dev
2009-01-31T21:09:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	thanks, do you think that would work for Hardy as well? sorry forgot to mention that
2009-01-31T21:10:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	Hardy came up w/the same: libmtp.dev
2009-01-31T21:10:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	will tyr it
2009-01-31T21:10:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	whoops, libmtp-dev
2009-01-31T21:11:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	crapola....opened it with .deb installer and it says "ame version already installed"
2009-01-31T21:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	alright, try running the program as root (sudo)
2009-01-31T21:13:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	i know i have libmtp.so.7 installed, seen that in synaptic, you would think it would cross reference
2009-01-31T21:14:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	I only searched for libmtp.so; interesting that libmtp.so.6 is missing
2009-01-31T21:14:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	that search came up dry... interesting.
2009-01-31T21:17:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	just installed libmtp-dev with root gdebi, still get same error
2009-01-31T21:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	i'm sorry, but i don't know :( this looks like something ubuntu packages can't fix
2009-01-31T21:19:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	it weird, i have installed it from .deb, from apt-get and from source, neither works
2009-01-31T21:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	|TheBarold|	yes, that library seems to be missing completely
2009-01-31T21:20:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	thanks for the help, i'll keep working on it
2009-01-31T21:21:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	or do have any other recommendations for a Nomad mp3 player file browser?
2009-01-31T21:25:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	also when i try to get libmtp6 from Synaptic, i get this error "libmtp6: Package libmtp6 has no available version, but exists in the database."
2009-01-31T21:50:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	FYI, i got it figured out, went into Synaptic and removed the deb file i installed, then re-installed from Synaptic and now it works
2009-01-31T21:50:00.000Z	|TheBarold|	rdw200169	also, would have helped if i had the usb cord plugged into the pc :O
