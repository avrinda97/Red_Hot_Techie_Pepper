2007-11-30T11:22:00.000Z	Invert314		how what's the command to launch the gnome theme changer app?
2007-11-30T11:23:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	you mean the emerald theme manager or system>prefrences> appearance?
2007-11-30T11:23:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	no
2007-11-30T11:24:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	 i don't know about the themes for individual applications.. but to change the entire skin of your computer i can walk you thru both ways
2007-11-30T11:24:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	like the menu bars, the windows , the controls etc
2007-11-30T11:25:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	what's the commandline command for that?
2007-11-30T11:26:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	 those changes are done with only 2 applications that i am aware of... the emerald theme manager .. which uses compiz and puts up a whole theme wit a click.. OR you have to use appearance... and on the first tab select the window look that is close to what you want and click customize..... THERE is where you will skin individual components for the system.. the menu bars, the window bars and the controls
2007-11-30T11:27:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	and you download components from places like gnome-look and untar them into the .themes folder andf .icons
2007-11-30T11:27:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	the closest i found to something like "windowblinds" for ubuntu is the emerald theme manager
2007-11-30T11:28:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	yes, i know how to change my emerald theme. what i need  is the command which opens the customization themer for menus, and sidebars
2007-11-30T11:29:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	 ooooohhhh  i am stil new within ubuntu... but i really think that might be under appearance... under "customize... if its not there .. then i am at a loss
2007-11-30T11:29:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	i know its there under appearance
2007-11-30T11:30:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	 that i don't know... i only know how to use it within the gui
2007-11-30T11:38:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	i may have an answer for you but i need to know if the theme manager IS the same exact program as "appearance"
2007-11-30T11:39:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	otherwise i've wasted your reading time again... cuz i just alunched it from terminal
2007-11-30T11:39:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	the terminal command is: gnome-appearance-properties
2007-11-30T11:40:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	 i'm just trying to help.. i'm googling like mad to find the command you are asking for for terminal... trying to be helpful
2007-11-30T11:41:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	hey i'm a newb and i know it..  but trying to help in here helps me learn
2007-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Invert314	hey i'm not finding a thing other than typing "gnome-theme-manager" but i'm fairly sure thats not right because it doesn't launch anything on my computer... unless i don't have it installed... soo i'm sorry i couldn't find it for yu but i'll keep looking
2007-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	i already found the command i was looking for
2007-11-30T11:49:00.000Z	Invert314	jayde_drag0n	i said: the terminal command i'm looking for is: gnome-appearance-properties
