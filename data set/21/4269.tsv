2008-05-27T09:47:00.000Z	x_		hey I have file in my trash that says I don't have permissions to delete. Any help?
2008-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	the trash is a hidden file in your home directory
2008-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	you need to browse to your /home folder
2008-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	sudo nautilus will show you the root trash
2008-05-27T09:56:00.000Z	x_	Itai-Michaelson	there is no hidden .trash file
2008-05-27T09:57:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	browse to /home/your_user and then press ctrl+h
2008-05-27T09:58:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	you can also go through the view menu "show hidden files" , it should be called ".trash"
2008-05-27T09:58:00.000Z	x_	Itai-Michaelson	I did that and there is no .trash file
2008-05-27T09:58:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	do ypu s
2008-05-27T09:58:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	sorry
2008-05-27T09:58:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	do you see other hiden files then?
2008-05-27T09:59:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	you are using Hardy?
2008-05-27T10:01:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	ok in that case its in a different directory
2008-05-27T10:01:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	look for .local
2008-05-27T10:02:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	in local there is a "share " folder, trash should be there
2008-05-27T10:02:00.000Z	x_	Itai-Michaelson	Check.
2008-05-27T10:02:00.000Z	x_	Itai-Michaelson	Now how do I get rid of it?
2008-05-27T10:03:00.000Z	x_	Itai-Michaelson	or sudo and then delete it there?
2008-05-27T10:03:00.000Z	Itai-Michaelson	x_	if you are running sudo nautilus you should be able to delete any file in the trash
2008-05-27T10:05:00.000Z	x_	Itai-Michaelson	Dude, you are the mack daddy pimp! Thanks for the help. That trash was driving me crazy!
