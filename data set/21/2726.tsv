2011-06-10T10:45:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	don't use simple compiz manager and don't use compiz fusion icon, 11.04 comes with a newer compiz and those items weren't ported to that version
2011-06-10T10:43:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	what is your issue?
2011-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	sadly 11.04 is too buggy too and many compiz, gtk gnome issues around
2011-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	just don\ t press alt+spacebar
2011-06-10T10:45:00.000Z	plustax	cablop	thank you I wont!
2011-06-10T10:49:00.000Z	plustax	cablop	no?
2011-06-10T10:51:00.000Z	plustax	cablop	ah okay.
2011-06-10T10:52:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	in few words and a real case, i ditched windows xp on my netbok and installed ubuntu on it, i use full gnome interface and compiz with the cube effect on it, it is running
2011-06-10T10:54:00.000Z	plustax	cablop	^^
2011-06-10T10:54:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	i recommend you only one of two distros, Lucid aka 10.04 or Maverick aka 10.10, they're pretty stable and still supported, 10.04 is the more stable of them and you won't suffer a lot
2011-06-10T10:55:00.000Z	plustax	cablop	I feel you. I'm not entirely hopeless. I am a linux noob but I know enough about android to move about pretty easily. Im more used to ubuntu at this point.
2011-06-10T11:08:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	hehe, dunno why they do that too often, and it does feel really aggresive
2011-06-10T11:08:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	anyway, it is indeed offtopic,
2011-06-10T11:10:00.000Z	cablop	plustax	but in few words, afaik, people have many many concerns about that os, one, it is not really that open source, two, it is going to be released much more like android, you can get a custom version for your device, but barely s sth you can download and install on your PC, and three, your date lves in the cloud, on google servers... not on your pc... so, in just one word FAIL
2011-06-10T11:15:00.000Z	plustax	cablop	for OP tbh
