2010-07-27T15:02:00.000Z	dustin	soreau	are you talking to me?
2010-07-27T15:02:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	no one can help you if you don't ask your question
2010-07-27T15:19:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	sys>prefs>Remote Desktop on the server and apps>internet>remote desktop viewer on the client
2010-07-27T15:21:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	I like the vncviewer application provided by xtightvncviewer package
2010-07-27T15:23:00.000Z	dustin	soreau	is that a program?
2010-07-27T15:24:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	It is a client program you can use to view another linux desktop (where a vnc server is running), yes

2010-07-27T15:40:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	You're going to have to do some reading. Ask in #networking perhaps
2010-07-27T15:44:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	patience.
2010-07-27T15:57:00.000Z	dustin	soreau	can you show me how to set up just one remote desktop?
2010-07-27T15:58:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	I know how to do it on a lan but never set it up remotely
2010-07-27T16:01:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	For the sake of random strangers connecting to your machine remotely, sounds like a security issue
2010-07-27T16:09:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	sounds fun but unless she's a real geek she might not be that impressed :p
2010-07-27T16:23:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	yes, it's possible in a variety of different ways. You will have to google and read about whatever you're wanting to do exactly
2010-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	Is she also using ubuntu?
2010-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	Yes, vnc is what I have been telling you about all along
2010-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	sys>prefs>Remote Desktop on the server and applications>internet>Remote Desktop Viewer on the client
2010-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	In this case, her machine would be the server and yours would be the client
2010-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	soreau	dustin	see what ubottu said about vnc
