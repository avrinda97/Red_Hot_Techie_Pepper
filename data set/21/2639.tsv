2009-08-11T06:08:00.000Z	foobarbecue		can anyone help with my TFTP server? It doesn't respond to any requests. Using tcpdump I can see the requests being made... I set up the config file, the tftp root directory, and restarted xinetd. Any ideas?
2009-08-11T06:09:00.000Z	foobarbecue		the client just gets "timed out" when i try to get a file
2009-08-11T06:10:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	have you looked at the access logs?
2009-08-11T06:10:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	no. can you tell me where they are?
2009-08-11T06:11:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	you need to look in /var/log/
2009-08-11T06:11:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	thanks, i'll look
2009-08-11T06:12:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	or you can look at the startup script for tftp and see if the command logs to a certain file. i am not familar with tftp
2009-08-11T06:13:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	I think I need to edit my tftp config file to make it log. I'll try that.
2009-08-11T06:14:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	what does the startup script say?
2009-08-11T07:38:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	it probably needs to be a dir. so it would sudo mkdir
2009-08-11T07:39:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	that's what I tried at first, but then I got "/dev/loop0: Is a directory"
2009-08-11T07:39:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	 which makes me think it's not supposed to be...
2009-08-11T07:39:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	that means that the directory is already there
2009-08-11T07:40:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/251144/
2009-08-11T07:41:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	that's what I get if I create the directory. No loop created, whether I start with a directory or start with nothing.
2009-08-11T07:41:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	why in the world are you trying to use a swap file over nfs?
2009-08-11T07:41:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	because I only have 16mb on my embedded device and that's not enough to run apt-get
2009-08-11T07:41:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	and cross-compiling is a pain
2009-08-11T07:42:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	ah, sorry. i see. so do you have the nfs shared out like the directions to the link you pasted. i have never done this so I am only trying to help from what I read
2009-08-11T07:43:00.000Z	foobarbecue	mazda01_	that's alright, thanks for your help. you indirectly led me to solve my tftp problem earlier, by the way
2009-08-11T07:45:00.000Z	mazda01_	foobarbecue	oh, cool. so what are you going to do about the nfs share as swap?
