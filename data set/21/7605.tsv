2007-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	tyler_d		please help apache2 wont start...?
2007-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	try starting it manually?
2007-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	yes /etc/init.d/apache2 start
2007-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	ps -ef | grep -i apache shows apache but no apache2
2007-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	usr/local/bin shows nothing in there... although it is refrences from ./apache2 in init.d
2007-12-19T15:01:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	 doesn't produce anything though... when I try and start it, not returning any values :(
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	and if you go to 127.0.0.1 in firefox you see nothing?
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	I have the default apache 1.2 screen
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	but thats it
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	then its working
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	if it were working it would be listed in ps -ef
2007-12-19T15:03:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	no
2007-12-19T15:03:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	oo wait youre seeing 1.2 ...do you have both installed?
2007-12-19T15:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	need 1.2 to have 2.0 running don't you?
2007-12-19T15:04:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	no.  just install apache2.  only one or the other can be on your localhost
2007-12-19T15:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	ok
2007-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	no love
2007-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	you got rid of apache 1 so you only have 2, then restarted 2?
2007-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	macogw	2 won't start, same as before
2007-12-19T15:13:00.000Z	macogw	tyler_d	so nothing's there when you go to 127.0.0.1 now?
