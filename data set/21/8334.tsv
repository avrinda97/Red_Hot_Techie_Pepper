2011-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	adbuntu		So nobody knows
2011-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	adbuntu		I drag a window across my screen and Xorg uses like almost 70 percent of my CPU
2011-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	adbuntu		what the hell is that about
2011-05-20T01:09:00.000Z	adbuntu		No 10.04
2011-05-20T01:09:00.000Z	adbuntu		I have an nvidia card and i'm using the propietary drivers
2011-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	adbuntu		i've experienced this same slowness on other computers with ATI cards too
2011-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	adbuntu		i figured nvidia would be better, but i guess not
2011-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	adbuntu		maybe it's compiz
2011-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	adbuntu		it's not set to do any fancy effects, but sometimes i think running it at all slows it way down
2011-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 I doubt its' compiz however you can check   ,, hit alt + F2  type   metacity --replace
2011-05-20T01:11:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 ok now see how sluggish it is
2011-05-20T01:11:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	  there you go,, what you might want to do is disable some plugins in compiz
2011-05-20T01:12:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	  however on 10  compiz version is 0.8.x
2011-05-20T01:12:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 to get compiz back  alt+F2  compiz --replace ccp & disown
2011-05-20T01:12:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 well no not to get the new version of compiz,, you can install 0.9.x  onto that system now
2011-05-20T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 but if you want to try 11.04  for it
2011-05-20T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 there is a script that will install the current compiz git  on t hat system under /opt
2011-05-20T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	  is it slightly snappier,, but I wuold just open  ccsm and disable plugin s you dont use
2011-05-20T01:14:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 oh!  the is  compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-05-20T01:14:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	 open a terminal    sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-05-20T01:14:00.000Z	coz_	adbuntu	  then it should be under system/preferences  or hit alt+F2  type    ccsm
