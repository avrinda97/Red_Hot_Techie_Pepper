2012-04-08T02:42:00.000Z	excalibour		how can i install vlc for web based home media server on 10.04
2012-04-08T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	enable the interface in the advanced preferences
2012-04-08T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	you'll need to edit the vlc .hosts file to allow your network subnet
2012-04-08T02:44:00.000Z	excalibour	ActionParsnip	where is the hosts file, and how will i start the server afterwards? would editing make me have a web based control?
2012-04-08T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	/etc/vlc/lua/http/.hosts
2012-04-08T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	yes, enable the remote control and web control interfaces, then restart vlc.You can now connect to it via http://ipaddress:8080
2012-04-08T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	you'll also be able to control it via apps on smartphones
2012-04-08T02:47:00.000Z	excalibour	ActionParsnip	where s the file to edit?

2012-04-08T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	try:  sudo updatedb; locate hosts | grep vlc
2012-04-08T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	ok, edit those in turn and you will see networks and you can uncomment / edit a line to allow your network to connect. The default is to only allow localhost
2012-04-08T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	did you edit the file, then restart the app?
2012-04-08T02:57:00.000Z	excalibour	ActionParsnip	there s no file to edit, sorry, with ls i get a blank prompt under http
2012-04-08T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	the command outputted some file names, edit those with nano to enable the local subnet
2012-04-08T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	sudo nano /usr/share/vlc/lua/http/.hosts
2012-04-08T03:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	why not just use the netmask, you can do it by IP but using the mask is a bit easier
2012-04-08T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	close vlc, start it up again and you should be ok
2012-04-08T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	kill the process and start it how you normally do
2012-04-08T03:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	if the system has no X server, how is it going to display?
2012-04-08T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	well, what is the VLC doing via remote control?
2012-04-08T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	excalibour	np man, all ok?
