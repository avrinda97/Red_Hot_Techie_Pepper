2009-05-02T22:39:00.000Z	Linuz2009		Can anyone tell me what's a keyring?
2009-05-02T22:39:00.000Z	Linuz2009		it kept popping up whenever I start my computer.
2009-05-02T22:40:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	a mechanism for storing passwords, that is itself password protected (overly simplified explanation)
2009-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	because your computer is accessing a resource that requires your identify (ssh mount or something), and so you are getting prompted to unlock the keyring so that it can be used
2009-05-02T23:28:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	check out the du command
2009-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	4kb per folder in ext filesystems
2009-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	yes it still uses 4k
2009-05-02T23:45:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	if you feel like you might become a victim of phishing, and don't trust the mechanisms put into browsers stock configurations, then sure
2009-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	Linuz2009	fryguy	then where can I install one for linux?
2009-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	Linuz2009	fryguy	if you had no idea then I google it.
2009-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	take a look at firefox add-ons
2009-05-02T23:49:00.000Z	Linuz2009	fryguy	how can I update my mozilla browser?
2009-05-02T23:49:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	you can't (easily), you use the version that is provided for you by ubuntu
2009-05-02T23:50:00.000Z	Linuz2009	fryguy	you mean I can't update it?/
2009-05-02T23:50:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	right
2009-05-02T23:51:00.000Z	Linuz2009	fryguy	so ubuntu installed mozilla fox and disable the update function so the version ubuntu provide will be safe even w/o pathces?
2009-05-02T23:52:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	yes
2009-05-02T23:54:00.000Z	Linuz2009	fryguy	just to let you know, I install netcraft toolbar.
2009-05-02T23:56:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	no
2009-05-02T23:58:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	alphabumeric (upper and layer) with special characters that is as long as possible
2009-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	fryguy	Linuz2009	yes
