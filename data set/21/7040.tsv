2006-12-12T07:11:00.000Z	MSTK		hey all
2006-12-12T07:13:00.000Z	MSTK		I'm a new convert from windows.  can anyone recommend me a good media player/organizer similar to WinAmp/iTunes that plays videos and has iPod support?
2006-12-12T07:13:00.000Z	MSTK		I've been using rhythmbox, but it doesn't play videos =/
2006-12-12T07:13:00.000Z	MSTK		yeah, that's the main problem I've been stumbling into
2006-12-12T07:13:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	amarok(kde) or banshee(Gnome)
2006-12-12T07:15:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	to use ipod video on linux it will be hard due to the DRM
2006-12-14T07:48:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	you will have to find the linux driver if there is one
2007-01-07T10:35:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	qemu maybe but why not just use parellel they do have a Linux version?
2007-01-07T10:36:00.000Z	MSTK	kitche	- i don't know...do they?
2007-01-07T10:36:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	yes but not sure if serials are different for it though
2007-01-07T10:43:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	you need to use a type of program what is your computer maker
2007-01-07T10:44:00.000Z	MSTK	kitche	- it's a Vaio
2007-01-07T10:44:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	ah might do some googling I only know about HP
2007-05-07T10:08:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	apache is a foundationt hat makes software like httpd among other things
2007-05-07T10:11:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	yeah you can use apache to do that if you wish have to isntall some extra software to do it though
2007-05-07T10:12:00.000Z	MSTK	kitche	- what would normally be used for that, though?
2007-05-07T10:12:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	ssh
2007-05-07T10:14:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	trying to find the page to use apache for the shell also
2007-05-07T10:14:00.000Z	MSTK	kitche	- that's not really necessary.  I just want to find out what I can do with what I've heard is such a powerful tool.
2007-05-07T10:16:00.000Z	kitche	MSTK	ssh is not that powerful the shell is though which can be used locally and remotely using ssh
2007-05-07T10:17:00.000Z	MSTK	kitche	- i'm talking about Apache.
