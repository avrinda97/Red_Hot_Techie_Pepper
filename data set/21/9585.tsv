2005-08-31T07:05:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	Do the lights on your card work? I just bought a new card, and ndiswrapper finds the hardware, but the power/link light isn't working
2005-08-31T07:07:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	WPC54G(ver2) with ndiswrapper
2005-08-31T07:08:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	good - have that too: you have to rmmod ndiswrapper, rmmod acx_pci, then modprobe ndiswrapper again
2005-08-31T07:09:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	Will that be constant now? light will always be on?
2005-08-31T07:09:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	and just curious, which driver did you install? (I used lstinds)
2005-08-31T07:10:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	so it came on? if so, add "acx_pci" to /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-08-31T07:10:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	i loaded both INFs just in case
2005-08-31T07:10:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	heh, good thinking
2005-08-31T07:10:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	and last question (hopefully) what is ESSID?
2005-08-31T07:11:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	that's the name of the network you are trying to connect to
2005-08-31T07:11:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	what if I'm not sure of the name?
2005-08-31T07:12:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	run "iwlist"
2005-08-31T07:14:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	if your using a linksys router/switch, it might be called "linksys", assuming it hasnt been changed
2005-08-31T07:14:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	nope, I know it's changed, but if it were "linksys" when I type "iwlist wlan0 scan" it will show "linksys"?
2005-08-31T07:15:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	perfect, hopefully it'll work when I'm back home.  Thanks!
2005-08-31T07:18:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	one more thing: dont forget to run "ndiswrapper -m" and youre set
2005-08-31T07:19:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	what does that do?
2005-08-31T07:19:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	makes ndiswrapper load at boot
2005-08-31T07:19:00.000Z	zerboxx	durt	I did that before I installed the other driver, do I have to do it again?
2005-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	durt	zerboxx	wont hurt
