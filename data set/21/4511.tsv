2008-10-24T03:08:00.000Z	Tigerplug		I'm trying to mount an external harddrive on ubuntu server (hardy) - can anyone help?
2008-10-24T03:08:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	Is the drive attached already?
2008-10-24T03:08:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	Can you see it in /dev/???
2008-10-24T03:09:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	 is has a number of partitions but I see Disk /dev/sdb: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes when I do fdisk-l
2008-10-24T03:10:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	/dev/sdb will be the disk, then /dev/sdbN (1/2/3/etc) will be each partition
2008-10-24T03:10:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	You want to start with `man mount`
2008-10-24T03:10:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	Then something like `mount /dev/sdb1 /media/blah` :)
2008-10-24T03:10:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	can I mount all partitions to one place (/media/store)
2008-10-24T03:11:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	Each disk needs to be mounted in a different place
2008-10-24T03:11:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	But they can all be within one folder if you like
2008-10-24T03:11:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	- ok , how can I unmount?
2008-10-24T03:11:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	`man umount`
2008-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	`umount /media/blah`
2008-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	- thanks!
2008-10-24T03:17:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	- any idea about mounting ntfs partitions? - or partitions of which i dont know the filesystem
2008-10-24T03:18:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	Do you have a specific error?
2008-10-24T03:18:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	I can mount the first 3 partitions, the 4th is mac (i think called HFS extended) and the 4th is NTFS, I can mount with the -force switch both no directory listing
2008-10-24T03:19:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	You need to read up on `man mount` about the different options for mounting different disk types
2008-10-24T03:19:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	I don't know the specifics off the top of my head
2008-10-24T03:19:00.000Z	Tigerplug	chmac	- ok, I'm off to read the man pages. Thanks for your help :)
2008-10-24T03:20:00.000Z	chmac	Tigerplug	nw, good luck, try searching as well, you might find it quicker  :)
