2008-05-17T11:12:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	it's the other way around. i installed ubuntu ontop of an existing windows install. will this still work?
2008-05-17T11:13:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	yes. read up and you'll see how to recover Grub
2008-05-17T11:13:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	thanks
2008-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	i followed the grub recover instructions, but when i try to boot off the grub menu item labeled 'ubuntu etc.' i get 'partition not found'. but the windows menu item works fine
2008-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-05-17T11:53:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	the LiveCd is commonly used for reinstalling Grub. in a terminal, do: sudo grub
2008-05-17T11:54:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	yeah, i did that like the ubuntu help page said
2008-05-17T11:54:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	and?
2008-05-17T11:55:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	when i try to boot from the Ubuntu option at boot time, i get 'partition not fond'
2008-05-17T11:55:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	you have access to the Filesystem in which ubuntu is installed, correct?
2008-05-17T11:56:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	i'm trying to get to it... i tried sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdc2 /media/disk3 but it says it's in use (from the livecd)
2008-05-17T11:57:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	just going to Places > Computer > you-hard-disk doesn't work?
2008-05-17T11:57:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	ah yes. much easier. silly me :)
2008-05-17T11:58:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	ok. get into the boot folder, then grub folder. open menu.lst and pastebin the file's contents

2008-05-17T12:01:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	your Windows installation and Ubuntu installation are both in the same Hard Disk. Windows is in the first partition while the Ubuntu install is in the 2nd. Correct?
2008-05-17T12:01:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	yes
2008-05-17T12:02:00.000Z	babolat	smultron	are you sure? because your Grub menu says that Ubuntu is on a second HD
2008-05-17T12:03:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	the / partition is mounted on the same HD as windows. the /home partition is on another hard disk
2008-05-17T12:05:00.000Z	smultron	babolat	alright, will do
