2011-12-14T22:00:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10		hdd of 320 gb is  full (  50gb of windows7 +  269gb of  vmware  vmdk file) , im left with 1gb to work.  how can  i switch to ubuntu  now ?
2011-12-14T22:01:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	- 1) buy more HD space or 2) delete some crud
2011-12-14T22:05:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	usb HD cna help a load ....
2011-12-14T22:05:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	can full install ubuntu on hdd, keeping old vmdk file (large size) intact on hdd
2011-12-14T22:06:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	are they on seperate partitions ?
2011-12-14T22:06:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	269gb of vmdk will take 4hrs to come back onto hdd from usb drive
2011-12-14T22:06:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	on single partition now
2011-12-14T22:07:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	your probably out of luck - though making a backup onto exteral HD will save heartache later
2011-12-14T22:08:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	already i have vmdk file on usb drive
2011-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	i can install ubuntu and put vmdk back on hdd from usb drive but it takes 4hrs of time as vmdk file is large size of 269gb
2011-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	... ok ... your still out of luck really unless the installer can shrink the extising paration
2011-12-14T22:12:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	 can i boot from bootable usb of ubuntu and try demo before install, can i at that time could see hdd partition ?
2011-12-14T22:13:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	yes you should eb able to see it ...
2011-12-14T22:13:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	if i could see hdd at that time, i will  remove window7 related stuff, it will increase space
2011-12-14T22:13:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	i will get 51gb free space ( 320gb -269gb = 51gb)
2011-12-14T22:14:00.000Z	RaTTuS	kvijayeddy10	it will be NTFS so not useful for ubuntu
2011-12-14T22:15:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	after that can i see windows paritition and vmdk file or not later ?
2011-12-14T22:16:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	my only concern is to save my ass of re-putting large file vmdk ( of size 269gb) onto 320gb hdd ...it takes 4hrs of time
2011-12-14T22:21:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	 can u clear this to me ?
2011-12-14T22:23:00.000Z	kvijayeddy10	RaTTuS	incase i could put ubuntu on 51gb and see remaining ntfs parition  having large vmdk file, can i change ntfs parition  to ubuntu's parition without losing files ?? i mean merging of two paritions of different partitions to ubuntu wihtout losing ntfs parition files
