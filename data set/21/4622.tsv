2008-03-18T10:46:00.000Z	grub		i made a partition from my windows drive, and i want to add it to my linux partition, how do i go about it?
2008-03-18T10:47:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	you want to access your files from linux on your windows partition?
2008-03-18T10:47:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	no, i want to add it to my linux partition
2008-03-18T10:48:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	the present linux partition is only 15GB, i want to add 10 gb more
2008-03-18T10:48:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	easy program for that then. =) gpart
2008-03-18T10:49:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	yeah i know that, was wondering if i would end up having troubles with grub
2008-03-18T10:49:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	and i would have to change fstab?
2008-03-18T10:50:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	its actually for my friend, i know how to do all that, but hes a noob, was wondering if theres an easy method so that he could do it on his own
2008-03-18T10:52:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	editing /boot/grub/menu.lst should be fairly straightforward
2008-03-18T10:52:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	yeah
2008-03-18T10:52:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	is your friend at all computer literate? being a computer noob and being a linux noob are very different :)
2008-03-18T10:54:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	linux noob :)
2008-03-18T10:55:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	okay, then what I might suggest to him is to go ahead and comment out the entries in grub for windows, making sure the default is set to ubuntu of course, then go ahead and merge the partitions with gpart
2008-03-18T10:57:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	ah yes, but I forgot one thing. he's going to need additional packages for gpart in order to manage NTFS filesystems
2008-03-18T10:58:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	hes using gparted, it has ntfstools i guess
2008-03-18T10:58:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	which I'm assuming he's using. a simple search for ntfs in package manager should turn up something though
2008-03-18T10:58:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	awesome, all set then?
2008-03-18T11:03:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	yeah, trying it out now
2008-03-18T11:04:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	btw, if you have problems with gparted and ntfs that package was ntfsprogs. libntfs isn't used by gparted :(
2008-03-18T11:05:00.000Z	grub	kdorf	using the livecd, i guess it has all what we need :)
2008-03-18T11:05:00.000Z	kdorf	grub	awesome. =)
