2006-06-04T06:09:00.000Z	sally_		I installed mplayer and codecs with automatix.  when mplayer plays an .avi the audio and video are out of sync but xine plays it right, how do I fix it?
2006-06-04T06:10:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	try mplayer -autosync 30 whatever.avi
2006-06-04T06:10:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	if that doesn't fix it, you can use +/- to adjust the a/v sync manually
2006-06-04T06:11:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	you might find that '-vo xv' helps too
2006-06-04T06:11:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	ok I will try those
2006-06-04T06:12:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	-vo xv is worth using anyway
2006-06-04T06:12:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	you can also do 'echo vo=xv >> ~/.mplayer/config to make it permanent, to save typing -vo xv every time
2006-06-04T06:13:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	ditto, 'echo autosync=30 >> ~/.mplayer/config' if you want that permanent
2006-06-04T06:19:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	RandolphCarter: it's still off, does mplayer on dapper work for you guys?
2006-06-04T06:20:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	even with -vo xv -autosync 30 ?
2006-06-04T06:20:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	yeah
2006-06-04T06:20:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	what is it? avi is just a container; what does 'file whatever.avi' say?
2006-06-04T06:21:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 608 x 336, 23.98 fps, video: XviD, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)
2006-06-04T06:22:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	how off is it? 3 pass encoding had some bug that screwed the sync IIRC, I've seen ~200ms off sync quite often
2006-06-04T06:22:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	sorry the last msg was for you forgot to lead with the name
2006-06-04T06:23:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	sounds like the 3-pass thing - hit - a couple of times and it should be ok
2006-06-04T06:26:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	yeah it was 200ms off, hitting - twice worked... is the bug you're talking about in mplayer ?
2006-06-04T06:26:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	no, it was in mencoder's 3-pass encoding IIRC
2006-06-04T06:27:00.000Z	sally_	amphi	do you know why xine plays it right ?
2006-06-04T06:27:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	the problem is in the avi file; mplayer can deal with it, just not automagically
2006-06-04T06:27:00.000Z	amphi	sally_	it does? no, I don't use xine
