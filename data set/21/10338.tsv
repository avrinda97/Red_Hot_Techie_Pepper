2005-03-30T16:03:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	6.8.2 is *much* faster than 6.7.0!!!
2005-03-30T16:03:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	especially for startup speed!
2005-03-30T16:04:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	just add 'deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary main restricted universe multiverse' to sources.list
2005-03-30T16:05:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	you even get new KDE and GNOME etc
2005-03-30T16:05:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	um... but its still there    :/
2005-03-30T16:08:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	faster load times.. faster refresh of widgets/windows in general
2005-03-30T16:10:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	no
2005-03-30T16:10:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	you're not using hoary though
2005-03-30T16:10:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	you're using 2.8, not 2.10
2005-03-30T16:10:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	don't argue, kthanks  :P
2005-03-30T16:11:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	they pretty much crippled the menu's in 2.10
2005-03-30T16:14:00.000Z	lunitik	sandwitch	eh... somewhat intentional... you have no idea how annoying not being able to edit the menu is after a while...
