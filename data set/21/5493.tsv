2009-04-27T07:24:00.000Z	yowshi		grrr people in #bash aere asleep ahnyone jhere avilable to help me with a scripting problem?
2009-04-27T07:24:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	perhaps.
2009-04-27T07:25:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	http://dpaste.com/38211/ this script refuses to repeat the entire sequence
2009-04-27T07:27:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	do you get any particular errors?  where does it stop?
2009-04-27T07:30:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	http://dpaste.com/38202/ this was the script before one of the people in #bash "fixed it up" for me no i dont get errors it just repeats what i am supposing is the last command determined by the if satement.
2009-04-27T07:31:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	i just tried swapping around the commands and it is just repeating the last command determined by the if statement
2009-04-27T07:34:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	what types of values does gcbotexplore return
2009-04-27T07:34:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	thay are xmacro scripts save copies something off a section of a screen and saves it in gcbotsvtxt explore is mouse moves as is plunder
2009-04-27T07:35:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	explore and plunder are just as easily replaced by echo tests
2009-04-27T07:36:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	so if I understand quickly, you want it to break out of the inner loop? and do the whole thing over gain?  At the moment, that will never happen,  on what condition do you want it to happen?
2009-04-27T07:37:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	always thats why i used a while [ 1 ] statement
2009-04-27T07:37:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	i dont want the entire loop broken unless i manually break it
2009-04-27T07:38:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	the question is why wont it loop and how do i fix it
2009-04-27T07:39:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	I know.  Will do that.  try putting $(  ) around them.
2009-04-27T07:39:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	putting $() around what?
2009-04-27T07:40:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	oh, sorry about the "I know..." don't know where that came from.  Around the explore and plunder .
2009-04-27T07:41:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	$( ) around the commands will their output act like a variable to be stored in the other variables.
2009-04-27T07:42:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	i see and how will this change anything?
2009-04-27T07:45:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	ok what that does is is break the for loop. it gives errors on line 19 and 21 and then just executes what ever command is after the done >
2009-04-27T07:45:00.000Z	yowshi	jdu	err done <
2009-04-27T07:46:00.000Z	jdu	yowshi	otherwise, gcbotstdin and out are storing them as a string.  That is not what you want, right.    I have to go,  sorry I haven't helped.  Either add a break statement to the inner loop, or make sure gcbotexplore eventually returns something false.
