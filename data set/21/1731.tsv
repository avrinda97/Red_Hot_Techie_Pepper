2010-05-17T09:13:00.000Z	ARandomNub		Can anyone direct me to a guide for installing wine/ or tell me how to do it?
2010-05-17T09:13:00.000Z	ARandomNub		;)
2010-05-17T09:14:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	 why you want to use wine?
2010-05-17T09:15:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	I've got various different windows appications I may or may not find useful
2010-05-17T09:16:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	 my personal opinion is that wine is unstable... i just install virtualbox to run windows app onder win Xp... everithing work like a charm
2010-05-17T09:16:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	but the final choise is yours
2010-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	I'll try wine, see what goes :)
2010-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	 alright to install wine is easy... just open software centre and type wine
2010-05-17T09:18:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	for instance, I just ran Steam and it loaded without error :)
2010-05-17T09:18:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	steam is already coding a version for ubuntu
2010-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	I know, but this is just one of many apps :)
2010-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	very good
2010-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	 after install wine you will se a new chose on your menu relat to wine
2010-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	Is Winetools the thing where I get a list of stuff, like direct x and etc?
2010-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	  yep
2010-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	Thought so; I'm checking thatn ow.
2010-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	but up to DX9.b
2010-05-17T09:24:00.000Z	enav	ARandomNub	 ok let continue... after install wine you will be able to install windows program with a simple and dangerous double click ... like M$ does
2010-05-17T09:25:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	I know
2010-05-17T09:25:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	When I run wine tools, it tells me to direct it to a file to install
2010-05-17T09:25:00.000Z	ARandomNub	enav	Last time I used wine tools, I opened it through Terminal and I got a big list
