2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	Kwek		hi
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	Kwek		is this irc chan for support?
2006-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	Kwek		well, im quite noob at this. It is a must to reformat before partition right?
2006-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	opposite
2006-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	partition before reformat
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	yes you will need to erase your hard drive so back it up
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	burn your files onto a cd or save them on the internet somewhere
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	a "partition" is just a special word for a section of your hard disk
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	yes, what version of windows do you have?
2006-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	ok, the windows xp install disk will allow you to partition your hard drive
2006-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	this is what you do: 1) erase any existing partitions 2) make one new primary partition for windows 3) make it small enough so you have free space left over for linux
2006-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	i would personally want about 20G or more... but i bet it'll install in 1-5G depending
2006-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	well it appears you may not need to do any of that
2006-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	do you have windows on this computer currently?
2006-06-02T10:33:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	are you planning on erasing that windows and installing a new copy anyway? or would you prefer to keep your current windows installation and your files?
2006-06-02T10:34:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	you can let ubuntu do the job
2006-06-02T10:35:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	don't take *my* word for it though :)
2006-06-02T10:35:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	that's just what i hear
2006-06-02T10:37:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	1G swap
2006-06-02T10:37:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	you want the same amount of ram as swap usually
2006-06-02T10:37:00.000Z	r0xoR	Kwek	better to go lower than higher
