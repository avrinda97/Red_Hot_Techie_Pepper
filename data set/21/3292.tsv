2009-07-31T18:07:00.000Z	janisozaur	Kingsy101	follow the rest of howto
2009-07-31T18:07:00.000Z	Kingsy101		oh ok, so thats it the script has been run ?
2009-07-31T18:07:00.000Z	Kingsy101	janisozaur	- how do you run Epiphany for example ?
2009-07-31T18:08:00.000Z	janisozaur	Kingsy101	alt-f2 epiphany, though i doubt that you want to change your browser. i think it should be simillar for FX

2009-07-31T18:10:00.000Z	Kingsy101	janisozaur	- what I mean is, on the howto, it says to run that script and then do something in epiphany .. what is that?
2009-07-31T18:10:00.000Z	janisozaur		i'm using several PPAs, i'd like to install and maintain pidgin from a very specific PPA, is it possible with apt-pinning or in some other way? having read man apt_preferences i know it is possible to track packages based on their "origin", though it expects an internet address, but all PPAs originate in ppa.launchpad.net. The most convenient would be to use "Origin:" tag from Release file, though it seems such behaviour is not supported
2009-07-31T18:10:00.000Z	janisozaur	Kingsy101	epiphany is a web browser, similar to firefox (i think they shate some of the code base actually, epiphany recently got XPI support)
2009-07-31T18:11:00.000Z	janisozaur	Kingsy101	so i'd just disregard "epiphany" and thought of it as a firefox ;)
