2011-11-08T04:21:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	I don't follow. can you clarify?
2011-11-08T04:23:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	well to answer your original question: "yes" was that a helpful answer?
2011-11-08T04:24:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	I'll paste my earlier message again, I think you may have missed it.
2011-11-08T04:24:00.000Z	now3d_		[23:08] <now3d_> Hi there, I'm using Ubuntu 11.10, would like to get Gnome Classic, however having a few probs with deps: "apt-get install gnome-session-fallback" gives me unmet dependecy on gnome-session-common   any ideas, or a faq link on how to get Gnome Classic working?
2011-11-08T04:25:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	well classic does not exist. fallback looks like classic but is not classic, and is probably not enough for you. if you want fallback try installing gnome-shell first then installing the fallback
2011-11-08T04:26:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	Tried that. I get umet dep on  gnome-icon-theme-full
2011-11-08T04:27:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2011-11-08T04:27:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	11.10 (upgraded from 11.04)
2011-11-08T04:27:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	did you have gnome-shell in 11.04?
2011-11-08T04:29:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	I had classic.. Not sure if that is the same as gome-shell
2011-11-08T04:30:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	gnome-shell package is not installed currently
2011-11-08T04:30:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	no its different. something is messed up with your apt archive. make sure nothing is pinned, and try running apt-get check and apt-get -f
2011-11-08T04:32:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	thanks, apt-get check   is ok, apt-get  -f gives me unknown param message.
2011-11-08T04:34:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	do you have anything pinned?
2011-11-08T04:35:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	My only other idea is to re-install.. often upgrades some to this!
2011-11-08T04:35:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	or do you have any ppas that could be breaking things
2011-11-08T04:36:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	hmm, I've not knowingly pinned. I have disabled the auto updates of packages yesterday though.
2011-11-08T04:39:00.000Z	escott	now3d_	im not too familiar with debugging apt issues, so maybe someone else can help if you ask again later
2011-11-08T04:40:00.000Z	now3d_	escott	thanks for your Pinned tip. I re-enabled all updates, and the gnome-shell installs ok!
