2006-09-11T15:39:00.000Z	Adam		is there a way to set the task-bar icon of programs?
2006-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	Adam		Vim decided to display a generic white square instead of that lovely green logo.
2006-09-11T15:43:00.000Z	Adam		i.e. Vim has the logo icon in the menu and in the panel, but when executed, it's represented in the alt-tab menu by a generic white square.
2006-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	yes that icon is kinda 'hard-wired', could only be changed from source-code
2006-09-11T15:45:00.000Z	Adam	nozorro	*nod*, I guess it's because I had to install Vim7 from some .deb I found somwhere. not having it in the repos is so annoying.
2006-09-11T15:46:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	not because of that, but because some apps do their own thing, not belonging to either gnome or kde
2006-09-11T15:46:00.000Z	Adam	nozorro	hm, I thought gVim is pretty firmly in the Gnome realm...
2006-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	no, not by any standards
2006-09-11T15:48:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	you will see similar behavior with other desktop apps
2006-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	Adam	nozorro	heh, weird. Vim7's icon displays ok in Windows, but it has several more severe GUI problems there.
2006-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	hmm i would expect that.  anyway linux apps can be 'gnome-compliant' in varying degrees. just because it fits in nicely doesn't mean it's a gnome app (in the strict sense)
2006-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	Adam	nozorro	yeah, what's funny is that under Win32 the gui (which seems to be GTK?) is quirky, but the icon works. in Ubuntu the gui is solid, but the icon doesn't :P
2006-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	might well be because gtk on win32, yes
2006-09-12T16:06:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	indeed
2006-09-12T16:24:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	editor for config. settings as enforced by gnome backend gconf
2006-09-12T16:25:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	gconf-editor from the command line
2006-09-12T16:26:00.000Z	Adam	nozorro	it works from the CL. wonder why it's not in the "Applications" menu; appearantly I don't have "Syst. Tools" at all
2006-09-12T16:27:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	check out Apps > Accessories > Alacarte Menu Editor so see where it is on your system. should be installed by default
2006-09-12T16:27:00.000Z	Adam	nozorro	ah, it was hidden! thanks
2006-09-12T16:28:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	yw
2006-09-12T16:30:00.000Z	nozorro	Adam	you can also do this from the CL to fetch from the history: '!rc'
