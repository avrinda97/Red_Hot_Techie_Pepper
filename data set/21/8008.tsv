2006-06-28T06:24:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	c'mon man just read the manual.. mount -t ext3 /dev/hdX /mnt/<mount_point>
2006-06-28T06:27:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	what ever you want, just make sure the directory is empty
2006-06-28T06:30:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	I just told you to read the manual, but you didn't did  you..
2006-06-28T06:30:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	you took /dev/hdX litterly didn't you?
2006-06-28T06:31:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	ok just do a dmesg, and search for the harddrive that you wish to mount
2006-06-28T06:32:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	it has to be like this, example /dev/hda1
2006-06-28T06:33:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	hd stands for hard drive, the -a stands for the first drive on the master connector and the 1 stands for the first partition
2006-06-28T06:35:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	I honestly disagree, if you are having problems with mounting drives..
2006-06-28T06:38:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	Yes so? You are using Linux now so please refrain from comparing that.
2006-06-28T06:41:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	maybe it is because of the free time that I have but I learned Linux from buying books and doing a *lot* of searches
2006-06-28T06:54:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	could you pastebin your dmesg?
2006-06-28T06:55:00.000Z	cherwin	t4ken	try mount -t auto /dev/hda2 /mnt/<mount_point>
