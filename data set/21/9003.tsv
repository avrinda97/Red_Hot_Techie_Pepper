2005-12-16T12:06:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		hey, is ubuntu better than windows?
2005-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 depends on what you think "better" is.
2005-12-16T12:08:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 yes there is
2005-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	and you already have it... use GAIM
2005-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 It has support for the msn messenger
2005-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 Applications >> Internet >> Gaim Internet Messenger
2005-12-16T12:10:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 or if you don't like gaim there is always AMsn
2005-12-16T12:11:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 It does make sense.. you just have to think about it. Much like you do with Linux.. you have to think about how Linux works. you will have to read about Linux.. and eventually you will get a good understanding and really appreciate that there is a linux
2005-12-16T12:12:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 not really >> gaim.. its already installed
2005-12-16T12:12:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 any linux distro is not for the faint of heart :)
2005-12-16T12:13:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 though we are trying to get it that way
2005-12-16T12:13:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 your used to Windows, your comfortable with how windows works. Now imagine you never used windows before... thats how you are feeling with Linux
2005-12-16T12:13:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 yes and you can play games, and you can work on word documents
2005-12-16T12:14:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 because you don't have the proper codecs
2005-12-16T12:14:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	I assume.
2005-12-16T12:15:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	I think you have problems wanting to learn about Ubuntu or Linux in general
2005-12-16T12:15:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 just an observation
2005-12-16T12:16:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	there is a linux Itunes app but I don't know the name off the top of my head
2005-12-16T12:17:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	ya give up. Its not the Linux its you!
2005-12-16T12:18:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 But I agree, linux can be hard to learn when your really new to it
2005-12-16T12:23:00.000Z	mrkoje	JackPalmiery	 it all depends on what you want to do with it buddy... if you have a 486 with 16mb ram and a 200mb hdd you can still run linux just fine, provided that you do a minimum install and scrap x-windows
