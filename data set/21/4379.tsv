2008-05-24T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	right click the menu bar, then select edit
2008-05-24T09:52:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	thanks
2008-05-24T09:53:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	no option to delete one
2008-05-24T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	do you see two?
2008-05-24T09:53:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	yes
2008-05-24T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	just uncheck one
2008-05-24T09:54:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	how? i see no option to do that
2008-05-24T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	navigate to the admin menu, and uncheck the box in the right pane next to one of the printing thingo's
2008-05-24T09:56:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	i would...but theres nothing to uncheck/select...just the tab and options to add it to desktop/panel
2008-05-24T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	right click the menu bar itself, and there's an option
2008-05-24T09:59:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	i go to system-admin-printing-right click....only optionsavailable are to add launcher  to desktop, panel or add drawer/menu to panel...no removal facilities shown at all..this is confusing me
2008-05-24T10:00:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	im on hardy heron btw
2008-05-24T10:00:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	no, without opening any menu, right click right on top of 'Applications'
2008-05-24T10:01:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	aha...i see it ....
2008-05-24T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	and now you're gonna see all the stuff the dev's didn't think you needed to se ;)
2008-05-24T10:02:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	i got it sorted now....great....though a little confusing :)
2008-05-24T10:02:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	thanks dude
2008-05-24T10:05:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	for what its worth, in my opinion i think that option would have been better put under system tab as its to do with altering stuff under the hood so to speak...thanks for your help :)
2008-05-24T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	langleyo	yeah, it could be more obvious. Take it as a reminder that nearly everything you can't find anywhere else is probably under right click :)
2008-05-24T10:06:00.000Z	langleyo	nickrud	noted
