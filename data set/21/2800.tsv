2009-10-28T15:41:00.000Z	syam1		Yes, and only then the concerned partition went off from the places menu.
2009-10-28T15:41:00.000Z	syam1		I did the same with the other two partitions too.
2009-10-28T15:41:00.000Z	syam1		And the same happened with them.
2009-10-28T15:41:00.000Z	syam1		What?
2009-10-28T15:42:00.000Z	syam1		you mean in the /home/syam folder?
2009-10-28T15:42:00.000Z	syam1		or in the /home folder?
2009-10-28T15:43:00.000Z	syam1		mount point p1 does not exist
2009-10-28T15:44:00.000Z	syam1		You have not mentioned which folder should it be created?
2009-10-28T15:44:00.000Z	syam1		Is it the /home/syam/ folder or is it the /home/ folder itself?
2009-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	syam1		Okay.
2009-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	om26er	syam1	you hard drive have partitions in the order of sda1 sda1 or sdb1 sdb2 sdc1 sdc2
2009-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	om26er	syam1	when you want to mount any partition you will mount it in a specific folder
2009-10-28T15:46:00.000Z	om26er	syam1	so you have to create separate folder for separate drive
2009-10-28T15:46:00.000Z	om26er	syam1	sudo mkdir music
2009-10-28T15:46:00.000Z	om26er	syam1	p1 is not necessary its your choise to set the name of the folder
