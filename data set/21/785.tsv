2011-06-11T20:35:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	If you choose "USB Creator", you might get the annoying "Try/Install Ubuntu."
2011-06-11T20:39:00.000Z	mrdeb	VOT	what about plugging in a usb hard drive to make it proceed but stil install to hte small one, or will it stop you later also
2011-06-11T20:40:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	Well...
2011-06-11T20:40:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	If you install that way, you get the 4.4GB way.
2011-06-11T20:41:00.000Z	mrdeb	VOT	the grayed out box that wont let oyu go forward?
2011-06-11T20:42:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	Yes, if you install from a USB, it counts as a CD install.
2011-06-11T20:43:00.000Z	mrdeb	VOT	so it will stop from going forward?
2011-06-11T20:43:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	I'm afraid, yes.
2011-06-11T20:43:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	Can you use the alternative image?

2011-06-11T20:46:00.000Z	VOT	mrdeb	Try the USB creator (as in install to Hard Disk). But you will have to press "Try Ubuntu" every boot up.
