2006-06-01T16:32:00.000Z	lmh		hi all, have trouble getting my wlan adapter to work (centrino)
2006-06-01T16:33:00.000Z	lmh		can't send a ping over wlan although it tells me i'm connected
2006-06-01T16:33:00.000Z	lmh		anyone an idea?
2006-06-01T16:34:00.000Z	lmh		ifconfig tells me it's up and connected, already has an address, but still i can't ping /surf
2006-06-01T16:34:00.000Z	lmh		destination host unreachable
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z	lmh		nobody?
2006-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	lmh		no, already tried without, same prob
2006-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	could you paste 'ifconfig -a' and 'netstat -r'
2006-06-01T16:37:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ ;)
2006-06-01T16:40:00.000Z	lmh	RandolphCarter	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14934
2006-06-01T16:40:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	could you do 'netstat -r' too?
2006-06-01T16:41:00.000Z	lmh	RandolphCarter	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14936
2006-06-01T16:41:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	which of those two NICs do you want to access the net through btw?
2006-06-01T16:42:00.000Z	lmh	RandolphCarter	at the moment to be able to ssh and paste the text in the box, i use the lan-nic.
2006-06-01T16:42:00.000Z	lmh	RandolphCarter	but i want to be able to use both
2006-06-01T16:43:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	they're both connected to the same network though? you'll need to setup the routing table
2006-06-01T16:44:00.000Z	lmh	RandolphCarter	yes, they're both connected to the same net. what i'd like to do is being able to use the "places"-function under gnome-network - settings: switch between home-lan / home-wlan
2006-06-01T16:45:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	that should be relatively easy, just don't have both interfaces up at the same time
2006-06-01T16:45:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	for home-lan disable eth1, and from home-wan disable eth0
2006-06-01T16:47:00.000Z	lmh	RandolphCarter	thanks, tried that b4, didn't work, now it miracolusly works. Great, Thanks!
2006-06-01T16:47:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	lmh	np's :)
