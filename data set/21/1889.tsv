2010-05-01T13:43:00.000Z	tripelb		what does apt-get update do? I got that it was a good idea so I've done it. But what is it?
2010-05-01T13:44:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	it fetches the list of available updates
2010-05-01T13:44:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	to install the available updates, youd do "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2010-05-01T20:50:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	if you hold alt you can click and drag windows to reach their offscreen bits
2010-05-01T20:52:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	right so hit alt and click and drag the window up
2010-05-01T20:52:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	will try
2010-05-01T20:52:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	the titlebar isnt the only thing that lets you move the window around. you can move it so the top of the window is off-screen and the bottom is visible
2010-05-01T20:53:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	that helps a lot. The basic probelm is that when I rebooted my resolution changed and there is only  lower option now.
2010-05-01T20:54:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
2010-05-01T20:55:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	the "adding undetected resolutions" bit
2010-05-01T20:58:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	thanks that gave me function back. -- but I still want to have my resolution back to  1024 x 768 (now is 800x600)
2010-05-02T06:37:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	thanks that gave me function back. -- but I still want to have my resolution back to  1024 x 768 (now is 800x600)
2010-06-17T01:52:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	was no 6.04. it was 6.06
2010-06-17T01:53:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	I'll look at my disk.
2010-06-17T01:53:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	there was going to be a 6.04, but it was pushed back 2 months and became 6.06
2010-06-17T01:56:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	I'll look at my disk. YEP, 6.1 -- my first Ubuntu. My first linux, if you dont count an abortive try at some distribution that starts with the letter s----- and has two parts.. a long time ago involving zip drives.  === I tried to look it up but Firefox crashes every time I try to start it (Ubuntu 10,04 liveCD - passed the check-the-disk test - failed the works-well test.
2011-05-13T23:46:00.000Z	tripelb	maco	prashant in fact it would be a loop in a loop in a loop in a loop, et al
2011-06-21T03:04:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	i'm guessing you made edits to the question you asked and the train of thought involved got chopped up in the process. want to try rephrasing?
2011-06-21T03:07:00.000Z	maco	tripelb	or you could just rephrase it more clearly. simple sentences work best for getting everyone on the same page to help out
