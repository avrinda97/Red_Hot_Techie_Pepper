2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	pressure_man		argh. shorewall is terrible!
2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	nonsense
2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy		on the other hand
2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	pressure_man		it produces the ~least~ efficient iptables script i've ever seen in my life
2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	pressure_man		it forces all traffic to traverse all chains before finally going into the chain where it gets filtered!
2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	I disagree - the author is a professional, and many swear by it
2005-07-11T10:20:00.000Z	pressure_man		the author is clearly an amateur
2005-07-11T10:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	do you write firewalls for a living?
2005-07-11T10:21:00.000Z	pressure_man		just look at the script it generates, and you will see how much timewasting the packets do as they traverse useless chains that will never match those packets
2005-07-11T10:22:00.000Z	pressure_man		not for a living, but i am a cisco, netscreen/juniper and proxim certified network engineer, so i know a thing or two about firewalls
2005-07-11T10:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	I think yer on crack, but whatever - pick yer poison :-)
2005-07-11T10:23:00.000Z	pressure_man	Xenguy	i personally don't give a sh*t what you think i'm on, but don't go giving wrong advice to newbies about firewalls
2005-07-11T10:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	I think you're wrong - so take your own bad advice elsewhere, K?
2005-07-11T10:24:00.000Z	pressure_man		the only thing worse than poort security is the misconception of good security
2005-07-11T10:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	You're actually the first person I've *ever* seen speak ill of 'shorewall'
2005-07-11T10:24:00.000Z	pressure_man	Xenguy	the kind of people who use shorewall are the kind of people who can't write iptables scripts by hand
2005-07-11T10:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	nonsense (and we're back where we began ;-)
2005-07-11T10:24:00.000Z	pressure_man	Xenguy	so, i wouldn't take their opinion with a lot of consideration
2005-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	nuff said (this is not going anywhere useful)
2005-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	pressure_man	Xenguy	tell me then, what is the point of packets traversing chains they are never going to match?
2005-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	pressure_man	take it to the shorewall list - I'm done now.
