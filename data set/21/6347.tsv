2008-04-19T07:41:00.000Z	nickrud	usser	lets grandma have a low res and you your tiny fonts ;)
2008-04-19T07:42:00.000Z	usser	nickrud	i thought it was kinda magic that gnome allowed per-user res settings. Does it really modify xorg.conf on load?
2008-04-19T07:44:00.000Z	nickrud	usser	no, it keeps the data it uses in gconf, and usex xrandr (I think) . Looking in gconf for the keys right now
2008-04-19T07:58:00.000Z	nickrud	usser	in case you're interested, I've finally found where gnome keeps it's per user data on screens
2008-04-19T08:02:00.000Z	usser	nickrud	do tell. links?
2008-04-19T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	usser	~/.gnome2/monitors.xml
2008-04-19T08:03:00.000Z	nickrud	usser	the gconf key is depreciated, but still exists. A red herring ;)
2008-04-19T08:05:00.000Z	usser	nickrud	i see
