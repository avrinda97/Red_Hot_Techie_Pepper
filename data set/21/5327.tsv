2007-11-05T11:29:00.000Z	buzz-c1		hi all--does anyone know how to create the same directory under several users: i.e. I want to make /home/user/dir1 for each user.
2007-11-05T11:30:00.000Z	buzz-c1		so does anyone know how to create the same child directory under several different parents?
2007-11-05T11:31:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	links
2007-11-05T11:31:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	hard links specifically, man ln
2007-11-05T11:31:00.000Z	buzz-c1		hard links...
2007-11-05T11:32:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	the real directory will sit under one parent, but with the hard links you can mae it look like it sits under other dirs
2007-11-05T11:32:00.000Z	buzz-c1	Cpudan80	will ownership reside with each user?
2007-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	each user?
2007-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	permissions are determined by the actual thing, not the links
2007-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	buzz-c1		yeah this will be /home/user1/dir    /home/user2/dir
2007-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	buzz-c1	Cpudan80	so it will be owned by root
2007-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	not sure I follow -- if user A wants to link to a directory in user Bs dir - user B will have to up the permissions on that particular directory
2007-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	the links themselves are owned by the user who creates htem
2007-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80		lrwxrwxrwx
2007-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	buzz-c1	Cpudan80	I guess I am looking for a quick way to create this same directory in each persons home folder--i.e. is there a command / series of commands to do this?
2007-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80		is the permissions
2007-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	yes - links
2007-11-05T11:36:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	DAN@SNOOPY$>ln  /path/to/target linkName
2007-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	buzz-c1		ln: `./user1/dir': hard link not allowed for directory
2007-11-05T11:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	buzz-c1	you need exec permissions on the destination dir (+ read)
2007-11-05T11:39:00.000Z	buzz-c1	Cpudan80	Thanks!
