2008-06-13T23:42:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	you can also run 'evolution &' from the console
2008-06-13T23:43:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	thanks a lot.  that killed my old version of data server
2008-06-13T23:43:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	i am looking for the default icon for evolution mail
2008-06-13T23:43:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	i am not looking for a way to run evolution or mess it up for that matter,
2008-06-13T23:43:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	you can run 'pkill evolution' to kill all the related bits
2008-06-13T23:44:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	READ THIS CAREFULLY     I    NEED    TO KNOW    THE DEFAULT ICON LOCATION      FOR EVOLUTION
2008-06-13T23:44:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	that is all
2008-06-13T23:44:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	you will sometimes find that it all locks up if one part of the client is running (say the data server) when you're trying to start the client
2008-06-13T23:45:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	super.  dpkg -L evolution | grep desktop
2008-06-13T23:45:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	     did i ask about lock ups
2008-06-13T23:45:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	did I ask if you did?
2008-06-13T23:45:00.000Z	unavailable	cj	then why are you telling me about lockups
2008-06-13T23:46:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	because it's useful information that you will need in the future.  why are you being a PITA?
2008-06-13T23:46:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	and I already answered your question.
2008-06-13T23:46:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	no, Flannel did not answer your question.  *rolls eyes*
2008-06-13T23:47:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	dpkg -L evolution | grep desktop
2008-06-13T23:50:00.000Z	cj	unavailable	did you find what you needed by running dpkg -L evolution | grep desktop?
