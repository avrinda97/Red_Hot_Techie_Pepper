2006-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	XVampireX		Hi
2006-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	XVampireX		How do I change the PATH to look for /usr/local/bin first?
2006-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	XVampireX		Can anyone help me please?
2006-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	/usr/local/bin has to appear in the list of directories in PATH first
2006-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	after changing PATH, if a shell is already running, you have to do    hash -r     in the shell
2006-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	usually you edit $HOME/.bashrc
2006-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	if your path is already there, you can change it
2006-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	if your path isn't there, or you don't have a $HOME/.bashrc yet, then you can do this:
2006-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	echo $PATH > some-file-name
2006-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	that gets the current path into a file.  Then you can edit it into .bashrc, then adjust it.
2006-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	if you don't have a $HOME/.bashrc, then create one.
2006-06-19T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	in the file you want:     export PATH=/whatever ...
2006-06-19T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	that's ok.  look for a line beginning with     export PATH=
2006-10-22T16:43:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	no, it's not a bios issue
2006-10-22T16:44:00.000Z	XVampireX	sethk	so what is it?
2006-10-22T16:44:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	could be a slight misalignment between the burner and the cd reader.  I have seen a couple of cases of this type of behavior that were fixed by using the proper jumper settings for the drive.
2006-10-22T16:44:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	specifically, if the drive is connected with an EIDE cable, make sure it's jumpered for cable select
2006-10-22T16:45:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	it's not impossible that switching DMA off (in the BIOS setting for the drive) would help, but the odds aren't great.
2006-10-22T16:46:00.000Z	sethk	XVampireX	tell him to try burning the CD at the lowest available speed setting, say 4x.
2006-10-22T16:46:00.000Z	XVampireX	sethk	that's what he did :P
2006-10-22T16:47:00.000Z	XVampireX	sethk	I mean he burned it at 4x
