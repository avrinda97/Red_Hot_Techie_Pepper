2011-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	i had simliar usb errors at one point in time which have now completely ceased with the purchase of a new PSU.  one of my wires had gotten exposed and usb ports were the only noticable thing it effected.  it would render errors not exact but very simliar and infinitely reoccuring
2011-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	i've had horrible experiences since about 10.04 messing with ubuntu's alsa.  this is just me, but if i were you, i'd find another solution if there is one.
2011-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	perhaps untouched alsa is all that is needed.
2011-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	have you already started to recompile different aspects of alsa ?
2011-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	i suggest you definitely not do that if your with 10.10 or above
2011-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	does your volumes control icon menu show your soundcard as listed or missing ?
2011-05-15T09:55:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	i believe its the pulsesaudio stuff that gets in the way of that happening succesfully.
2011-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	absolutely not
2011-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	go to gnome terminal and sudo alsamixer
2011-05-15T09:59:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	unmute any muted channels.  turn on all sleeping or disabled functions. set the levels to high. when your done get out of there. try a reboot, see what happens.
2011-05-15T10:00:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	and as stated, simply disregard sudo
2011-05-15T10:01:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	thats usually the thing that kills people thinking sound will never work -- alsamixer.  :/ :)
2011-05-15T10:22:00.000Z	adam62	k-rAd-	didn't seem to work.. when you said to turn on sleeping or disabled functions, how would you go about doing this? all i could see to do was to set all the levels i could to high. under "select sound card", it lists only "default", "0 HDA NVidia", and "enter device name..." i didn't want to change this without checking with you first. what do u think?
2011-05-15T10:23:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	if the soundcard you have wanting to function isn't listen the rest is up to you to figure out how to get it back.  i've had bad luck, both scripts and manually since 10.04 i always use their alsa packages ever since.
2011-05-15T10:26:00.000Z	adam62	k-rAd-	i was going to just remove all the alsa packages in synaptic and then reinstall them all in synaptic, but didn't you say i shouldn't do that? i think someone did
2011-05-15T10:27:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	that doesn't sound bad.  its worth a shot.  your looking at reinstallation
2011-05-15T10:29:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	a reinstall will fix all that real quick if you can preserve home and then get to alsamixer. thats the part that people have to learn when things don't work out of the box
2011-05-15T10:31:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	never heard of it.  i'm not as knowledgeble as the usual helpers.  i'm just good at getting up and running.
2011-05-15T10:32:00.000Z	adam62	k-rAd-	that's cool one problem at a time lol.. i'm wondering though why reinstalling everything isn't working considering i had it working fine a few hours ago
2011-05-15T10:33:00.000Z	k-rAd-	adam62	you probably forgot alsamixer.  a new install and your soundcard should magickally appear
2011-05-15T10:34:00.000Z	adam62	k-rAd-	that would be so amazing.. it's very possible. i think i may have installed that after i last reinstalled alsa
