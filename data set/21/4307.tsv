2008-05-18T04:37:00.000Z	kalamot		Hello there! Is there anyone here who could help me or tell me where to find help regarding the nautilus places menu ?  I have a NTFS partition with windows that i am unable to get rid off from this menu
2008-05-18T04:38:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	It's going to remain there as long as you've got the NTFS drive mounted in Ubuntu.
2008-05-18T04:39:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	it is not mounted
2008-05-18T04:41:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	Have you tried just removing it from the list or is it reappearing every boot?
2008-05-18T04:42:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	how to remove it ? When i right click on this NTFS partition in nautilus i have only the option open, open in new window and mount ( or unmount if mounted )
2008-05-18T04:43:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	"- Remove" isn't an option or is it greyed out?
2008-05-18T04:44:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	it is greyed out
2008-05-18T04:44:00.000Z	patifa		darn :(
2008-05-18T04:46:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	Well you could remove it from fstab, that'll really get rid of it, but that might be overkill.
2008-05-18T04:48:00.000Z	kalamot		patifa:
2008-05-18T04:49:00.000Z	patifa		yes, kalamot?
2008-05-18T04:49:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	It is not listed in etc/fstab. When i added this to etc/fstab:  /dev/sda1 /media/WinXP ignore defaults,noauto,nouser,locale=en_US.UTF-8 0 0 , it would still be in places menu ( just unable to mount it anymore from nautilus - probably could only mount it as a root)
2008-05-18T04:49:00.000Z	kalamot		so fstab or not it still is in nautilus places menu
2008-05-18T04:51:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	that is the whole problem :) I suspect  gnome-mount is doing here something
2008-05-18T04:53:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	if you don't want it mounted at all, why even have it in fstab?
2008-05-18T04:54:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	fstab or not it still is in nautilus places menu
2008-05-18T04:54:00.000Z	kalamot	patifa	even if doesn't apear in fstab
2008-05-18T04:54:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	odd...
2008-05-18T04:55:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	Change the mount location to somewhere besides /media, then.
2008-05-18T04:56:00.000Z	kalamot		ptifa: will try that
2008-05-18T04:56:00.000Z	patifa	kalamot	like inside of root's directory (/root)
