2007-09-12T10:08:00.000Z	perds		hello guys
2007-09-12T10:08:00.000Z	perds		can I have some help from you
2007-09-12T10:09:00.000Z	perds		I accidently remove the firefox .... how do I install it back?
2007-09-12T10:09:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	how did you remove it?
2007-09-12T10:10:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	5.0? The current version is 7.04. There was no 5.0.
2007-09-12T10:10:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	that's 6.06
2007-09-12T10:11:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	at any rate, let's try to get your Firefox back. Go to Applications>Accessories>Terminal please
2007-09-12T10:12:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	type this: < sudo aptitude reinstall firefox >
2007-09-12T10:12:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	that may not work, if not, try < sudo aptitude reinstall mozilla-firefox >
2007-09-12T10:12:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	if that doesn't work, try both again, but this time use install instead of reinstall
2007-09-12T10:13:00.000Z	perds	cdm10	I got this
2007-09-12T10:18:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	that's ok, they just kicked you so your client would stop sending messages. We don't hate you or anything :)
2007-09-12T10:19:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	just make sure that next time, you paste to a pastebin.
2007-09-12T10:20:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	it's a website in which to paste large texts so that you don't flood the channel.
2007-09-12T10:20:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	however, since you have no browser, it's of little use.
2007-09-12T10:20:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	do < sudo aptitude install firefox >
2007-09-12T10:20:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	can you type firefox in the command prompt and tell me what happens?
2007-09-12T10:21:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	if you type firefox in the command prompt, what happens?
2007-09-12T10:22:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	type "firefox" and hit enter. I'm trying to determine whether firefox is there, but hidden.
2007-09-12T10:22:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	I meant on the command terminal
2007-09-12T10:24:00.000Z	cdm10	perds	try doing < sudo aptitude install epiphany-browser > to get another browser.
