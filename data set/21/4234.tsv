2008-06-23T05:16:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices		How would I use STDIN but not from a file. So like echo < "I want you to use this data
2008-06-23T05:16:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices		"
2008-06-23T05:16:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices		But have it not interpret that as a filename
2008-06-23T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	echo "blah blah blah" | program
2008-09-14T12:39:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	What?
2008-09-14T12:41:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	Is there an easy way in bash to dissassosciate a process?
2008-09-14T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	What do you mean by disassociate?
2009-01-26T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	robf: you want to map twice.  hd0 to hd1 and hd1 to hd0 (or whatever the real numbers are), or else you wind up with two hd0s, etc.  Not happy.
2009-02-09T12:20:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	Should use $(), its a bigger pain, bt faster argument passing
2009-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	NO U!
2009-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	No.

2009-02-10T13:10:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	Do you really have nothing better to do than whine at my cusslings?
2009-02-10T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	If you just follow the rules in the first place, I won't have to meddle.
2009-02-10T13:11:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	What says you have to meddle?
2009-02-10T13:38:00.000Z	Flannel	MeVsTheVoices	Again, please mind your language.
2009-02-10T13:39:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	Little bit slow on that one
2009-02-11T12:41:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	Flannel	Where art thou!
