2006-07-18T07:45:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	goto 'system' -> 'administration' -> 'removable drives and media'
2006-07-18T07:46:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	under the 'multimedia' tab, put in the box about DVDs what is typed to start vlc .. (i assume 'vlc')
2006-07-18T07:48:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	i dont have 'removable drives and media' on that menu =[
2006-07-18T07:48:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	let me guess your not running 6.06 dapper?
2006-07-18T07:49:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	i AM running dapper
2006-07-18T07:49:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	theres no way its not there then
2006-07-18T07:50:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	so its just my menu that dosent have it?
2006-07-18T07:51:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	my fault bad advice, 'system' -> 'preferences' (i dont run gnome so this is kind of from memory)
2006-07-18T07:52:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	thanks, that worked. are you using kde then?
2006-07-18T07:52:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	yup
2006-07-20T09:11:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	if your talking about gcursor ive found that if you manually put the cursor dir in /home/youruser/.icons, then restarting gcursor
2006-07-20T09:12:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	i'll give it a shot
2006-07-20T09:14:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	no luck. i moved the cursor dir to ~/.icons but gcursor still dosent see new cursor =[
2006-07-20T09:14:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	dunno then thats always worked for me
2006-07-20T09:15:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	yah, its worked that way for me before.. i dunno why it hates me all of a sudden.
2006-07-20T09:15:00.000Z	skavenge	slew	may be that particular cursor is in a different format or something
2006-07-20T09:16:00.000Z	slew	skavenge	possibly, but ive tried with 4 different ones
