2010-03-06T18:02:00.000Z	puser		so, what about creating shortcuts with working folders?
2010-03-06T18:03:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	one second
2010-03-06T18:04:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	ok you know how to make a desktop shortcut already ?
2010-03-06T18:04:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	right clicking on the desktop will get you th dialog box for our next step.
2010-03-06T18:05:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	right click desktop > create launcher
2010-03-06T18:05:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	when I create it it only gives me an option for adding command, but no option for adding working path on gnome desktop.
2010-03-06T18:05:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	yep what we do is join the command together like this (assuming my app in question is leafpad ) cd /path/to/our/docs & leafpad
2010-03-06T18:06:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	if that doesn't do it for you, try wrapping that command in quotes
2010-03-06T18:07:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	so, what you are saying, ampercend (&) means that everything before it is a working path and after it a command?
2010-03-06T18:08:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	no ampersand in a command line means : run this & and then this
2010-03-06T18:08:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	if you use double ampersand it then means : run this && and this but only after the previous command has finished
2010-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	which, in my case: open folder (virtually) & run command?
2010-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	pretty much, i think there is another way to change the 'current working directory' (which is what you want to achieve)
2010-03-06T18:11:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	I will try your tip and tell you how it went. Thanx
2010-03-06T18:24:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	The following is my exact string that I've put in the launcher:
2010-03-06T18:26:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	ah i probably missed the part where you need to prefix the path with cd : so it reads : cd /path/of/awesome & program-to-run.exe
2010-03-06T18:30:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	I used this:
2010-03-06T18:31:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	like this : "cd /home/puser/.wine/etc/etc/etc/docs & inputdoc.exe"
2010-03-06T18:32:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	see the space in there ? it needs to be escaped with a forward slahs ; example : /path/with a space/to/somewhere/ becomes this : /path/with\ a\ space/to/somewhere
2010-03-06T18:41:00.000Z	puser	airtonix	I did: "/home/puser/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Налогоплательщик\ ЮЛ/INPUTDOC & inputdoc.exe"
2010-03-06T19:01:00.000Z	airtonix	puser	in the preferences of nautilus
