2007-11-22T19:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		robotoworks:: i've heard very bad things if you have Ubuntu installed first.. windows acts retarded about the MBR
2007-11-22T19:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Jack_Sparrow:: wouldn't that be treboot?
2007-11-22T19:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		or tri even
2007-11-22T19:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		robotoworks:: if that shows your reading skills .. no wonder you want to try vista
2007-11-22T19:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		robotoworks:: you asked about backing up your system and the previous lines were links to how-to
2007-11-22T19:50:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		robotoworks::  you were abused as a child?
2007-11-22T19:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		robotoworks:: and don't bother getting Vista and WiFi working.. impossible
2007-11-22T19:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		robotoworks:: hell, give vista a try.. let us know how bad you hate yourself when you finally get ubuntu back running
2007-11-22T19:53:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	cmon
2007-11-22T19:53:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	ease up a bit
2008-03-13T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	I almost want to go back to dapper just to do it ;]
2008-03-13T15:05:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	haha
2008-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	the !info seems to be not working atm
2008-04-05T21:17:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	the ppa ones?
2008-04-05T21:19:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	I think the ppa ones are the preferred variety; awn comes in the ubuntu repos starting next release ;]
2008-04-05T21:21:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	not sure about that; best to remove before you do the Hardy ones if you are going to upgrade to #ubuntu+1 in a couple of weeks
2008-04-05T21:24:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	not that I know of; but I am not the expert and we should talk about this in #ubuntu+1 ;]
2008-08-04T21:45:00.000Z	bazhang	bastid_raZor	thanks :)
