2009-11-06T00:43:00.000Z	harleypig		Help! No sound after upgrading to Karmic
2009-11-06T00:43:00.000Z	harleypig		any pointers (I'm googling)
2009-11-06T00:44:00.000Z	harleypig		I've deleted the .pulse dir and .pulse-cookie file and restarted pulse audio using killall, but that doesn't seem to have made a difference.
2009-11-06T00:45:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	im definitely no a sound expert but have heard reports that running alsamixer reviled a muted device
2009-11-06T00:46:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	I get alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
2009-11-06T00:51:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	what kernel are you running ... uname -r
2009-11-06T00:51:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	2.6.28-12-generic
2009-11-06T00:54:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	lsb_release -c
2009-11-06T00:54:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	updated manually from jaunty to karmic
2009-11-06T00:55:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	looks like you are running an old kernel which may have bugs.... sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-11-06T00:56:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	I've just upgraded ... the kernel would nave have been updated?
2009-11-06T00:56:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	that is a jaunty kernel .... you should be running 2.6.31-14-generic
2009-11-06T00:57:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	that command did not update the kernel.
2009-11-06T00:58:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	does lsb_release -c return karmic?
2009-11-06T00:58:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	yes
2009-11-06T01:01:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic
2009-11-06T01:02:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	that seems to be doing it ... on this topic, how do I get rid of old kernel installations? I've got 10-15 kernel images installed and I just want to keep the last 5 or so.
2009-11-06T01:04:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	sudo apt-get autoremove
2009-11-06T01:05:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	that should remove all the packages that are no longer needed including old kernels from previous installations
2009-11-06T01:07:00.000Z	harleypig	Sylphid|work	oh, nice.  thx
2009-11-06T01:07:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	harleypig	no problem
