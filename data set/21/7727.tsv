2007-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	alienseer23		is there a way to purge package configuration files from packages that have already been removed?
2007-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	sudo aptitude purge <package>
2007-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	that will get rid of lingering config files?
2007-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	that will remove system config files, not any that might be in your home
2007-10-26T06:54:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	will that get rid of config files for active packages as well? it does not seem to discriminate?
2007-10-26T06:54:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	to get rid of them all , do : aptitude , wait for it to load. Then l~c , shift_ , g (check that it's right) then g again
2007-10-26T06:58:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	sorry,, what is l~g?
2007-10-26T06:59:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	what that does, is limit the displayed packages that are not installed but are configured (l~c) shift_ (shift underscore) marks them for purging, g shows what will be done, g goes and does it. Escape (repeated) backs up.
2007-10-26T07:02:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	so l, then i get a dialogue, in which i enter ~c
2007-10-26T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	yes.
2007-10-26T07:04:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	the list I get is HUGE
2007-10-26T07:04:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	they all have c at the left, right?
2007-10-26T07:04:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	the first half has 'ida' the second hald 'cp'
2007-10-26T07:06:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	hrm, you have some disconnect between what apt-get has done and what aptitude wants to do.
2007-10-26T07:06:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	that is correct
2007-10-26T07:07:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	hit escape, you will see installed packages and not installed packages. Hit shift plus on the installed ones, shift underscore on the not installed, and check again
2007-10-26T07:07:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	i installed a bunch of stuff from aptoncd using the aptoncd metapackage, then the metapackage got removed with a program i needed t reinstall, and now everything i installed with the metapackage is listed as "no longer needed"
2007-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	I can see that happening, good anaylisys
2007-10-26T07:08:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	it only shows not installed packages and tasks
2007-10-26T07:09:00.000Z	alienseer23	nickrud	real life knocks on the door, maybe i can catch you in a bit
2007-10-26T07:09:00.000Z	nickrud	alienseer23	sure also: help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
