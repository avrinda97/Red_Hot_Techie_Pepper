2007-03-20T16:40:00.000Z	adam_		Why is my computer download so slow!? it says I'm behind a Firewall and I'm NOT :(
2007-03-20T16:40:00.000Z	adam_		the World of Warcraft BlizzardDownloader.exe
2007-03-20T16:41:00.000Z	adam_		trying to get WoW on my linux PC and play it using Wine
2007-03-20T16:41:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	ok.. then you probably have some kind of router between you and internet.. or?
2007-03-20T16:43:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	then I'd start checking those ports again... perhaps somethings changed... winxp has some plug'n'play firewall woodoo that might have worked it's magic before
2007-03-20T16:44:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	I don't play wow myself so I can't really help you with specifics... but I'd start checking that router... check that the ports are still the same, that you have the same ip under linux as you have in windows
2007-03-20T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	I doubt you need firestarter to play wow
2007-03-20T16:47:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	sudo apt-get remove firestarter .. then we'll check iptables
2007-03-20T16:48:00.000Z	adam_	Slart	ok done
2007-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	ok, in the terminal type "sudo iptables --list"
2007-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	it will print all rules in the firewall... I've got 3 empty sections.. INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT
2007-03-20T16:50:00.000Z	adam_	Slart	 Yep, they look empty for me
2007-03-20T16:51:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	then you should be clear.. try wow again.. see if it's better
2007-03-20T16:51:00.000Z	adam_	Slart	TY! :)
2007-03-20T16:52:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	it worked?
2007-03-20T16:52:00.000Z	adam_	Slart	- So far, it says 'No problems detected' :)
2007-03-20T16:53:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	nice
2009-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	sudo apt-get install screem   or use synaptic
2009-06-17T13:39:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	oh.. hmm... I'm not sure if it's available from the default install cd
2009-06-17T13:40:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	you could download the deb from package.ubuntu.com and put that on a flash drive
2009-06-17T13:40:00.000Z	Slart	adam_	you can even use synaptic to create a download script to automate it
