2008-01-26T14:07:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		I am currently checking my memory for erros using the diagnostic tool
2008-01-26T14:07:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		yes i have 2 corsair sticks
2008-01-26T14:07:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		take out one and see how it works?

2008-01-26T14:07:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		ill give that a shot
2008-01-26T14:08:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		becasue realistically i shouldnt have problems booting a live CD
2008-01-26T14:08:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		I installed vista just fine and then when it restarted the computer it would sit on the scrolling green thing for a while and never make it
2008-01-26T14:10:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		 I dont think so
2008-01-26T14:11:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		I dont knw how to check if it is my hard drive anymore
2008-01-26T14:12:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	fsck from a livecd, never fsck from a mounted drive.
2008-01-26T14:14:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	in terminal do fsck /dev/hda1 hda1=your partition
2008-01-26T14:14:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	I told you from a livecd.
2008-01-26T14:16:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	edit grub, remove quite splash -- and replace it with all_generic_ide
2008-01-26T14:17:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	to edit grub from the livecd press F6
2008-01-26T14:17:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	then replace what I told you
2008-01-26T14:18:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	same thing.
2008-01-26T14:20:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	that's normal.
2008-01-26T14:25:00.000Z	nelsonuwp	HardDisk	I cant type startx, or aynthing. I hit ok and after a long text thing it said no screens found
2008-01-26T14:27:00.000Z	HardDisk	nelsonuwp	unfortunately your errors seem physical.  I would go through troubleshooting, but it's too much work for me right now.
