2009-09-29T21:39:00.000Z	das_Urmel		anybody here who knows what to with this: http://mcraig.org/mec/2009/09/02/ubuntu-9-04-toshiba-tecra-m1-xorg-conf/ to make the resolution work again?
2009-09-29T21:40:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	arcoding to the website, that xorg config works on your computer, you will have to use that as your xorg config
2009-09-29T21:41:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	ok so i just have to copy it there and delete the other one?
2009-09-29T21:43:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	; you have to gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf then paste the text into it
2009-09-29T21:44:00.000Z	AaronTur		das_Urmel; or try sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-09-29T21:45:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	Thanks very much, i've been fighting with this  for a while now and just wanted to make sure to do everything right now :-P
2009-09-29T21:45:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	; you're welcome
2009-09-29T21:46:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	; youll have to restart after you have edited the xorg.conf file
2009-09-29T21:47:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	Ok, i'll try and tell you if it worked.
2009-09-29T21:48:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	; OK
2009-09-29T22:03:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	i've tried the sudo gedit command and everything worked but the resolution hasn't changed and when i open the file via browser then it doesn't show up the things i've changed. only when i open the file with the sudo gedit command. have i forgotten something?
2009-09-29T22:05:00.000Z	AaronTur		das_urmel; can you tell me what the path is in nautilus
2009-09-29T22:06:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	sorry i'm a newbie at linux and don't know what nautilus is. but if you tell me how i'll do it.
2009-09-29T22:07:00.000Z	AaronTur		das_urmel; nautilus is the file manager
2009-09-29T22:07:00.000Z	AaronTur		das_Urmel; in a terminal window run sudo nautilus
2009-09-29T22:08:00.000Z	AaronTur		das_Urmel; then browse to the xorg.conf file and open it that way
2009-09-29T22:09:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	okok^ , the path i used in the terminal for the gedit command was: /etc/X11/xorg.config and thats the same path i went in nautilus
2009-09-29T22:11:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	; run this command sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf if it open an empty text file, tell me
2009-09-29T22:12:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	ok thanks, i'll read through that and try again
2009-09-29T22:13:00.000Z	AaronTur	das_Urmel	Ok, hope you can get it sorted
2009-09-29T22:21:00.000Z	das_Urmel	AaronTur	ok i think i know now what went wrong, it was my (stupid) mistake. i edited the xorg.config file instead of the xorg.conf file. is there any way i can reverse it? the resolutions works good now since i edited the .conf file and i don't recognise any other changes but maby it's better to fix the .config file again too.
