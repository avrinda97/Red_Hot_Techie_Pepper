2007-10-02T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	do you mean install using fat32 filesystem?
2007-10-02T15:28:00.000Z	b_wolf_007	erUSUL	yes
2007-10-02T15:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	or you are asking if you can access fat32 partitions from ubuntu 7.04?
2007-10-02T15:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	you can access ntfs part from linux (even read/writte with ntfs-3g)
2007-10-02T15:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	also as Seveas pointed out there is a ext2 driver for windows. So copying files around shouldn't be a problem
2007-10-03T16:15:00.000Z	b_wolf_007	erUSUL	Sorry for  my elementary questions, but I am very new on that. I have a disk with 160 GB, what's your recommendation editing partitions, I want to know manually installation method, not to use Guided of course if you have time to tell me. I am on the step 5 of 8 ( prepare partition ) also have a disk 160041 free space ( i deleted the partitions ). I really appreciate your help!
2007-10-03T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	i recommend at least 3 partitions one for swap (about the size of your ram or 1.5*) one for root (where everything is instaled configured etc about 10 Gib or) and one for holding /home/ (the users files)
2007-10-03T16:26:00.000Z	b_wolf_007	erUSUL	I am creating a 28000 MB partition for system files, but i have problems with mount point, what exactly i must write here
2007-10-03T16:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	for root partition the mount point is simply /
2007-10-03T16:27:00.000Z	b_wolf_007	erUSUL	thanks, and sorry again for those stupid questions
2007-10-03T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	for the home partition the mount point is /home
2007-10-03T16:27:00.000Z	b_wolf_007	erUSUL	ok thanks
2007-10-03T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	b_wolf_007	not stupid at all we all have been begginers at some point
