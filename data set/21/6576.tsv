2007-03-06T13:34:00.000Z	Kronuz_		hey
2007-03-06T13:34:00.000Z	Kronuz_		I have a problem... my Ubuntu freezed
2007-03-06T13:35:00.000Z	Kronuz_		is there a way I can do anything? this is the second time this happens to me
2007-03-06T13:35:00.000Z	Kronuz_		everythings freezed but the mouse pointer
2007-03-06T13:36:00.000Z	Kronuz_		but I can't click on anything, etc... (not even the keyboard lock buttons seem to turn on/off any leds)
2007-03-06T13:36:00.000Z	Kronuz_		I'm in my windows box :P
2007-03-06T13:36:00.000Z	Pici	Kronuz_	Obviously you'll need to reboot and then check the logs
2007-03-06T13:37:00.000Z	Kronuz_		just press the reset button? :S
2007-03-06T13:37:00.000Z	Kronuz_		my HDD is working
2007-03-06T13:37:00.000Z	Kronuz_		for some reason it seems it's half frozen
2007-03-06T13:37:00.000Z	Pici	Kronuz_	Can you get to a tty? ctrl-alt-f1?
2007-03-06T13:37:00.000Z	Kronuz_		the HHD is doing stuff, etc. (it seems)
2007-03-06T13:37:00.000Z	Kronuz_	Pici	nope
2007-03-06T13:38:00.000Z	Kronuz_		I did that yesterday, but my HDD was not having any activity
2007-03-06T13:38:00.000Z	Pici	Kronuz_	You're pretty much out of luck at that point, unfortunatly
2007-03-06T13:38:00.000Z	Kronuz_		:(

2007-03-06T13:38:00.000Z	Kronuz_		I don't suppose SSH is open by default in ubuntu
2007-03-06T13:38:00.000Z	Kronuz_		so that I can log there from this box
2007-03-06T13:39:00.000Z	Kronuz_		(or try to)
2007-03-06T13:39:00.000Z	Pici	Kronuz_	no, its not.
