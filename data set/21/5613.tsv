2008-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	hendrik		tulimaq: are u still there ?
2008-11-02T14:38:00.000Z	hendrik		Somebody knows what means v   wine , after i check aptitude search wine ?!
2008-11-02T14:39:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	vertual package
2008-11-02T14:39:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	aka meta package
2008-11-02T14:39:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	hmm, i need to install it ors ?!
2008-11-02T14:40:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	need... no.  want on the other hand... only you know.     what a meta package does is depends on other packages to make installing the bundle easier.   ubuntu-deketop is another example
2008-11-02T14:44:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	Mabey you can help me with this, take a look at ->http://paste.ubuntu.com/66126/plain/ , it came after commmand ->sudo apt-get install wine
2008-11-02T14:46:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	it's in universe in intrepid and in hardy   check your sources.list
2008-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	maybe you don't have uni/multi-verse enabled
2008-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	how can i enable this ?
2008-11-02T14:48:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	i could give you a cli way.  but there is most likely a gui way now days.   i just don't use/like gnome.
2008-11-02T14:49:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	k, the main problem is that, i need to install wine, but i cant do it , because it gives me error , if i put command sudo apt-get install wine
2008-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	yes you need universe in your sources.list enabled
2008-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	see antono  ^     " System -> Administration -> Software Sources "
2008-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	thats the problem, i dont havve software sources :P.
2008-11-02T14:53:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	you and antono need to discuss that.
2008-11-02T14:54:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	is there second way by opening .exe ?
2008-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	no! an .exe is worthless in linux.
2008-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	_2	hendrik	.exe is the wrong format
2008-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	but the file, witch i need to  open, is in that format.
2008-11-02T14:57:00.000Z	hendrik	_2	I want to play windows game, called COUNTER STRIKE, and the file i need to open is in .exe format :S.....
