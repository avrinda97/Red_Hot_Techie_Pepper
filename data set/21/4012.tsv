2008-08-01T20:01:00.000Z	gregge		best nvidia drivers anyone?
2008-08-01T20:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	the 8000 series has always been a pain.
2008-08-01T20:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	I do know I would really try to avoid going to the nvidia site and trying to get those
2008-08-01T20:03:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	damn! It's a very common card among the semi-good laptops
2008-08-01T20:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	I dint say bad card
2008-08-01T20:03:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	what would you recommend instead? envyNG?
2008-08-01T20:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	I had some issues getting nvidia-glx-new from dropping me to low res mode
2008-08-01T20:05:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	you said I should avoid going to their webpage, but aren't the restricted ones the same? and do i enable them through "Hardware drivers"?
2008-08-01T20:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	start by enableing the restricted hardware drivers.  , once those load you will reboot and see if you get dumped.  we can go from there. If you cant get any useable screen go to recovery mode and sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx-new and or sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-08-01T20:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	yes, activate it
2008-08-01T20:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	Did you already try to install the ones from the nvidia site?
2008-08-01T20:10:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	ok I'll do that. No, I'm using the ones that i got from the beginning, just want the best, if anything's better. how did I check what drivow? what command?ers I used n
2008-08-01T20:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	I dont know how to find out what you are currently using.  BUt I did find that I lost 450 fps when I got the drivers from nvidia direclty.
2008-08-01T20:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	everything else looed the same
2008-08-01T20:13:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	damn... must be one heck of a system you've got though :) but you still think I could try these drivers to see if they're better?
2008-08-01T20:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	do you get all effects now?
2008-08-01T20:14:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	I think so, but it feels a bit too slow for what I'd expect from the laptop
2008-08-01T20:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	clilc and install the restricted drivers
2008-08-01T20:15:00.000Z	gregge	Jack_Sparrow	clilc?
2008-08-01T20:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	click
2008-08-01T20:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gregge	go for it while I can still be around to help.  All bets off when the wife wakes up
