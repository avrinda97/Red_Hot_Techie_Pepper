2009-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	Psinetic		ok i need someone to SERIOUSLY help me now. Yesterday I was on for three hours trying to figure out why i couldn't install anything from command line or use the update manager. Turns out it's because for some reason the system wouldn't let go of the Tor proxy i set systemwide. Even though I went into Network Proxy and disabled it system wide, it STILL looks for it. Ebb found this link: http://burakdd.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/removing-proxy-server-fro
2009-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	Psinetic		m-ubuntu-9-04/ which tells me to run this command: unset http_proxy. I ran it and it worked. Now the problem has started up again, and that command won't fix it...so what the??? o.0
2009-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	Psinetic		marfi, can u help me then? :D
2009-10-30T06:49:00.000Z	Psinetic		anyone have any idea why the system proxy simply WON'T go away and keeps blocking me from doing anything?
2009-10-30T06:50:00.000Z	Psinetic		anyone able to help me? o.0 :(
2009-10-30T06:52:00.000Z	Psinetic		ANYONE?!??? :(
2009-10-30T06:52:00.000Z	mage__	Psinetic	whats a system proxy
2009-10-30T06:52:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	the system proxy is a proxy you can set on the system
2009-10-30T06:54:00.000Z	mage__	Psinetic	the proxy works via environment
2009-10-30T06:55:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	i know how the proxy works, what i don't know is why it just won't turn off
2009-10-30T06:55:00.000Z	mage__	Psinetic	tor proxy is localhost? do "set |grep localhost" in a console and then it'll show PROXY=localhost:923 or something similar, try unset PROXY and then try from that terminal
2009-10-30T06:57:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	it's still not working. i still get the same error
2009-10-30T06:59:00.000Z	mage__	Psinetic	so the proxy isn't an environment variable?
2009-10-30T06:59:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	it is, and it worked yesterday, but it's like everytime i cut it off it simply comes back on. I have no idea why it's not working now, it fixed it yesterday.
2009-10-30T07:00:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	i would get you a pastebin of the error....but it keeps saying it's spam...>_>
2009-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	http://p.defau.lt/?DWNRGBUEoCaoxdD8cXYR2A
2009-10-30T07:04:00.000Z	mage__	Psinetic	is that from a console?
2009-10-30T07:04:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	no that's from the update manager
2009-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	hmmmmm now THAT'S odd. running "sudo apt-get update" in terminal works fine. but it won't work in the update manager.
2009-10-30T07:07:00.000Z	mage__	Psinetic	evironment variables are inherited and when you set it system wide it didn't get passed down to the updater applet
2009-10-30T07:07:00.000Z	Psinetic	mage__	how do i pass it down then?
