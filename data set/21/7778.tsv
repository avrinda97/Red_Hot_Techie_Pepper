2007-03-04T14:28:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah		how would I go about adding a USB drive as a bootable option for my local install of GRUB, that is, I've got GRUB On my ThumbDrive, I just need my local install to point to a boot record on my usb drive
2007-03-04T14:30:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah		anyone good with GRUB?
2007-03-04T14:31:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	what is your question, i will see if i can help
2007-03-04T14:32:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	if your bios cannot see the usb drive, neither can grub
2007-03-04T14:34:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	are you trying to put grub on your hard drive and have it boot from the flash drive, or putting it on the flash drive itself?
2007-03-04T14:36:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	you only need grub in one place, either on your hard drive or on the flash drive (there is no need to chainload it)
2007-03-04T14:37:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	i would try just booting off the flash drive, since that is a bit easier
2007-03-04T14:37:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	i cant
2007-03-04T14:37:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	well, it's an issue that you have to work out with your bios :-)
2007-03-04T14:39:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	but if I can just point it to the kernel on /dev/sdb1 then I could bypass the secondary GRUB couldn't I?
2007-03-04T14:39:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	yes, in theory you could, but i doubt it will work if you can't boot from the device itself; to do so you would need to make sure you have it as a grub device, instructions to do that are here: http://www.novell.com/documentation/suse91/suselinux-adminguide/html/ch07s04.html
2007-03-04T14:40:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	basically you need to make sure grub can see the device when you're in a grub shell, and make sure there is a device mapped to it
2007-03-04T14:40:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	cool I'll check it out ..
2007-03-04T14:41:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	especially look at section 7.4.2
2007-03-04T15:12:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	yeah looks like my machine doesn't like even looking at the drive..  see's my USB HDD no problem though..
2007-03-04T15:13:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	as far as using my persistant home I *can* still do it though, I just need to use my livecd
2007-03-04T15:13:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	gross, some bioses actually make a distinction between different kinds of usb devices... i have a computer that has boot options for different kinds of usb devices, even though they should all reallly be the same
2007-03-04T15:14:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	yeah .. my laptop at work treat my USB HDD as a SCSI external, my flash drive as a flash drive, both work fine their though .. I was hoping .. meh .. of well I only need it when I'm at work anyway
2007-03-04T15:15:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	thanks anyways I'm off to work
2007-03-16T08:39:00.000Z	eck	Coffeegrindah	i don't think that it is offered by many distributions, good luck
2007-03-16T08:39:00.000Z	Coffeegrindah	eck	I know.. that's the problem.. those it is.. well suck
