2007-02-26T08:43:00.000Z	cables	shwag	they're built in
2007-02-26T08:43:00.000Z	shwag	cables	i dont see anything under iwconfig though
2007-02-26T08:44:00.000Z	cables	shwag	then it's something else.
2007-02-26T08:44:00.000Z	shwag	cables	eh?  what else could it be ?
2007-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	cables	shwag	I don't know... but modify your question and people here might know the answer
2007-04-20T14:54:00.000Z	cables	shwag	yep
2007-04-20T14:54:00.000Z	cables	shwag	on feisty you just need to make sure your video drivers are installed and apt-get install beryl
2007-04-20T14:54:00.000Z	shwag	cables	should I not enable Desktop Effects (..uhmm..compiz?)  if im just going to do beryl ?
2007-04-20T14:54:00.000Z	cables	shwag	you can if you want... but disable them before you install beryl
2007-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	shwag	cables	I wonder why the beryl wiki doesnt explain you can just apt-get it now by default.
2007-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	shwag	cables	cool.
2007-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	cables	shwag	maybe it's for feisty?
2007-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	shwag	cables	yah...thats my point...its for Feisty
2007-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	shwag	cables	maybe an older version of feisty
2007-04-20T15:05:00.000Z	shwag	cables	where is beryl-manager ?
2007-04-20T15:06:00.000Z	cables	shwag	what do you mean by where?
2007-04-20T15:06:00.000Z	shwag	cables	it didnt get installed i guess.  I just did  apt-get install beryl
2007-04-20T15:06:00.000Z	cables	shwag	just hit alt-f2 and run it.
2007-04-20T15:07:00.000Z	cables	shwag	it installed it for me... hmm.
2007-04-20T15:07:00.000Z	cables	shwag	there's an ubuntu-beryl package you should install too.
