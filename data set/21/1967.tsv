2010-03-08T03:23:00.000Z	Steppzor		Is there anyone that know how to install Ubuntu Server from a USB stick?
2010-03-08T03:24:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	what is the problem?
2010-03-08T03:24:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	I've done that..
2010-03-08T03:25:00.000Z	Steppzor	natrixnatrix89	Well the computer where im trying to install Ubuntu Server on dont have a CDROM drive and well.. so it dosnt detect the install files..
2010-03-08T03:25:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	are you running ubuntu now?
2010-03-08T03:25:00.000Z	Steppzor		no
2010-03-08T03:26:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ use this to install the *.iso on the usb
2010-03-08T03:27:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	When it's installed you will be able to boot from that USB
2010-03-08T03:28:00.000Z	Steppzor	natrixnatrix89	yeah.. ive done that.. booted the stick.. im in the Ubuntu installer main menu after choosing language and stuff.. but here is the problem.. when it tries to load installer components from CD it fails cause no cd.. but USB stick..
2010-03-08T03:29:00.000Z	Steppzor		and when i try to mount the sda1 with the command mount -t vfat sda1 /cdrom it tells me that i cant find the directory or files or something..
2010-03-08T03:29:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	well. Ubuntu has a wonderful tool: USB startup disk creator. When I used it, everythind went fine and I could install the server easily
2010-03-08T03:31:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89		where is /tmp/ located physically? Is it in RAM or on HDD?
2010-03-08T03:31:00.000Z	Steppzor	natrixnatrix89	i dont see how thats gonna help me.. cause im in the installer.. booted fomr a USB stick.. but the installer tries only to install from a CDROM drive that it cant find.. so i cant get any where now.. just navigating the menu and picking my nose
2010-03-08T03:33:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	I think the problem is in the tool you used to make that USB bootable. Because I'm sure I had completely no problems with my usb
2010-03-08T03:34:00.000Z	Steppzor		okey? so can you tell me in short how you did it?
2010-03-08T03:34:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	so you really cant get a pc with ubuntu and just use startup USB creator?
2010-03-08T03:35:00.000Z	Steppzor		natrixnatrix89.. well then i have to reinstall regular Ubuntu on my laptop.. it crashed and i havent gotten around to fix it yet..
2010-03-08T03:36:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	actually its already installed in the live cd
2010-03-08T03:36:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	Steppzor	so you dont really have to install ubuntu
2010-03-08T03:36:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89		just boot in the live cd and make a startup usb disk
2010-03-08T03:37:00.000Z	Steppzor	natrixnatrix89	ahh okey..
