2007-09-11T14:21:00.000Z	gerro		how do I disable firefox's firewall?
2007-09-11T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	firefox firewall?? it has a firewall?
2007-09-11T14:22:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	do ip:21 in address bar
2007-09-11T14:22:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	its a recent bug introduced
2007-09-11T14:23:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	ah.. that's not a firewall.. just some kind of silly restriction...
2007-09-11T14:23:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	if it blocks ports its a firewall
2007-09-11T14:23:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	but I've never seen it before.. btw.. do you want to use http on port 21 ? or do you want to use ftp?
2007-09-11T14:23:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	ftp of course
2007-09-11T14:24:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	and http
2007-09-11T14:24:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	whatever I make it do?
2007-09-11T14:24:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	well... I'm not sure I agree.. but I would say that a firewall does a little more than just block ports but anyways.. try ftp://ip:21 instead
2007-09-11T14:24:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	I been violated :(
2007-09-11T14:25:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	thanks dude (^_^) 'O
2007-09-11T14:25:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	you're welcome
2007-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	I was thinking of switching to opera just to do this huge download, but omg they don't have an address bar ;_;
2007-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	opera doesn't have an adress bar?? what is the world coming to
2008-01-16T18:31:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	probably be easier just adding wine repository
2008-01-16T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	well.. if you cedega that wouldn't work.. now would it =)
2008-01-16T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	hmm.. "if you want cedega" ..
2008-01-16T18:32:00.000Z	gerro	Slart	actually it would but for legal reasons I wouldn't go that route
2008-01-16T18:33:00.000Z	Slart	gerro	legal reasons? I seem to recall something about the source being available but you have to pay for the binary packages.. I might be wrong though
