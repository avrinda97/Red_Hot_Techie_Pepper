2008-08-19T23:18:00.000Z	chamunks		how come my harddrives shuffle names within /dev/ from time to time?
2008-08-19T23:18:00.000Z	chamunks		from like sda to sdb and visa versa for some reason...
2008-08-19T23:19:00.000Z	mindframe-	chamunks	seems to be order of detection on the controller.
2008-08-19T23:20:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	there anything i can do to prevent this?
2008-08-19T23:20:00.000Z	mindframe-	chamunks	not that i have figured out.
2008-08-19T23:20:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	both of the drives are on the same chipset
2008-08-19T23:21:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	its soo strange because it used to work fine in older versions of ubuntu
2008-08-19T23:22:00.000Z	mindframe-	chamunks	if your drives are on the same controller then im not sure why... i thought it was just an issue with multiple controllers
2008-08-19T23:23:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	this is why im soo confused just randomly they re assign and i have to constantly re edit my fstab and remount
2008-08-19T23:23:00.000Z	mindframe-	chamunks	report it.
2008-08-19T23:24:00.000Z	mindframe-	chamunks	the way to work around it is to mount with the UUIDs
2008-08-19T23:24:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	ahh yes uuids i dont know why i didnt think about that...
2008-08-19T23:25:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	whats the command to echo the uuids of my connected drives again?
2008-08-19T23:25:00.000Z	mindframe-	chamunks	ls -als /dev/disk/by-uuid/
2008-08-19T23:27:00.000Z	chamunks	mindframe-	where should i report this to in the mean time?
