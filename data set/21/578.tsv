2011-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	BunnyLust		hey
2011-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	BunnyLust		updated from 9.10 to 10.04
2011-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	BunnyLust		now I don't have sound
2011-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	BunnyLust		where do I start to look for solutions?
2011-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	BunnyLust		11+?
2011-09-21T22:57:00.000Z	BunnyLust		ok is that something that I can google how to do? :P
2011-09-21T22:58:00.000Z	BunnyLust		don't want to bug you if it's obvious >.>
2011-09-21T22:58:00.000Z	BunnyLust		oh
2011-09-21T22:58:00.000Z	BunnyLust		I want to upgrade to 11
2011-09-21T22:58:00.000Z	BunnyLust		but I see no option for it
2011-09-21T22:58:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	Run alsamixer first, and see if there are channels muted or turned down. And see if the correct audio device is quoted in upper left.
2011-09-21T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp   #See if you get errors or if you hear the noise, (Ctrl-c to stop it)
2011-09-21T23:00:00.000Z	BunnyLust	usr13	no errors, no noise
2011-09-21T23:01:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	CHeck to see if the speakers are plugged into correct port, or just switch ports and see if you get sound from another.
2011-09-21T23:01:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	Do you have external switch or volume control?
2011-09-21T23:02:00.000Z	BunnyLust	usr13	no, I don't think it's a hardware issue
2011-09-21T23:03:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	but if you ran  cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp  and got no error, and alsamixer shows correct device and nothing is muted or turned down, it appears the software is working as it should.
2011-09-21T23:03:00.000Z	BunnyLust	usr13	it appears it's working, aside from it not playing anything :)
2011-09-21T23:04:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	Do have earphones?
2011-09-21T23:04:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	Yes, did you look for the M  or   MM  at the bottom of any of those channels?
2011-09-21T23:05:00.000Z	usr13	BunnyLust	There you go....
