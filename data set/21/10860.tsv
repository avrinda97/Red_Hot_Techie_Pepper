2005-02-07T17:22:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		have you people considered what a disaster your choice of distribution nomenclature is?
2005-02-07T17:22:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		seriously
2005-02-07T17:22:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		ubuntu has GOT to be the worst name ever chosen from an accessability standpoint
2005-02-07T17:23:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		your logo has a bunch of Us and Ns that look identical, just rotated
2005-02-07T17:23:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		what the hell is a dislexic person going to do if he sees that?
2005-02-07T17:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	is such a wonderfull handle
2005-02-22T13:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	you can add them to a script in /etc/init.d/, chmod 770 (root owership) then update-rc.d scriptname defaults
2005-02-22T13:27:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	LinuxJones	 No existing script to do it?
2005-02-22T13:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	well I like to add a custom script
2005-02-22T13:28:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	LinuxJones	 on Gentoo, you can `/etc/init.d/iptables save` when you have a good ruleset, and on restart (i.e. boot) it restores your iptables settings
2005-02-22T13:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	firewall's are not really necessary with Ubuntu anyways :D
2005-02-22T13:30:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	LinuxJones	 *rolls eyes*
2005-02-22T13:30:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	LinuxJones	 especially when other computers use ubuntu as a router to get out the cable modem huh?
2005-02-22T13:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	that's one example
2005-02-22T13:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	why not just install Firestarter it has a script AND a GUI
2005-04-19T10:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	yeah today
2005-05-31T16:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	that's what backups are for :)
2005-05-31T16:16:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	LinuxJones	 I could just reinstall the system
2005-05-31T16:16:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	LinuxJones	 /home is its own partition (the Ubuntu devs can't figure out why they would want to do this) so I can easily erase / and start over
2005-05-31T16:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	do you have a spare machine on your network with a gew gigs of free space ?
2005-05-31T16:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bluefoxicy	well you should check out mondo it's for backup up your system to cd or dvd drive.
