2008-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	Nubbie		hi does anybody know if i can change the colour of my screenname in Pidgin conversations? It's clashing with my GTK2 theme. Much appreciated!
2008-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	hold on a second
2008-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	thank you :)
2008-01-06T09:06:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	ok, try clicking Tools -> Plugins
2008-01-06T09:07:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	i've been all through there. i found one plugin that changed my conversation text, but not my screenname text.
2008-01-06T09:08:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	crud.  I could've SWORN the color changer was there.
2008-01-06T09:08:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	but yeah, you're right.
2008-01-06T09:08:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	perhaps there is another plugin to accomplish this, i'll look further. thanks anyways man.
2008-02-22T08:51:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	be careful installing that.
2008-02-22T08:52:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	why is that?
2008-02-22T08:53:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	it depends on the license for it, and I'm sure that if your mom's company finds out, it could get her fired.
2008-02-22T08:54:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	it's okay, they gave her her own license for it. it's not a group license. also, they terminated her contract illegally, so they can suck my left nut.
2008-02-22T08:55:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	all right then!  LoL  Nice snag on your part, in that case.
2008-02-22T08:55:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	mmhrmm. and she managed to heist adobe acrobat professional too lol.
2008-02-25T12:16:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	then set up your themes in /root/.themes differently.
2008-02-25T12:16:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	it doesn't seem to persist.
2008-02-25T12:17:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	log in as root (i know it's bad, but it will accomplish what you want), then set up your themes, log out, and never log in as root again!
2008-02-25T12:17:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	again, I did that and it STILL doesn't persist.  That's what's bothering me.
2008-02-25T12:18:00.000Z	Nubbie	xTheGoat121x	i'm just content soft linking my ~/.themes to /root/.themes. why isn't that good enough?
2008-02-25T12:19:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	I like the visual reminder that I'm running a program with admin privileges.  It'd just be nice to have something other than that gray.
2008-02-25T12:21:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Nubbie	meh, I know it's overkill but it'd be nice.
