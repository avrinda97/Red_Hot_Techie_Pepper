2007-12-17T04:49:00.000Z	am_		Hi, could someone help me with a dual-boot problem? i tried to install GRUB, but now i cant load Vista
2007-12-17T04:50:00.000Z	sethk	am_	is that really a problem?   (Just kidding)
2007-12-17T04:50:00.000Z	am_	sethk	lol but i need Vista (unfortuantely) for work
2007-12-17T04:50:00.000Z	sethk	am_	I know, occasionally I do also.
2007-12-17T04:51:00.000Z	am_	sethk	so do you know the problem?
2007-12-17T04:51:00.000Z	sethk	am_	put your menu.lst on the pastebin site and we'll see if we can figure it out.
2007-12-17T04:51:00.000Z	am_	sethk	it says the 3 ubuntu thingies, which it did before, and Vista/Longhorn (Loader), but when i press on the vista one nothing happens
2007-12-17T04:52:00.000Z	am_	sethk	how would i do that
2007-12-17T04:52:00.000Z	sethk	am_	the URL is in the channel subject line.
2007-12-17T04:53:00.000Z	am_	sethk	you mean http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org right?
2007-12-17T04:53:00.000Z	sethk	am_	right
2007-12-17T04:54:00.000Z	am_	sethk	so what where do i look to do this (im not very good at computers)
2007-12-17T04:54:00.000Z	sethk	am_	just go to that URL.  There is a box that says "paste here".  Then you click on a button (I don't remember if it says save or submit or ok, but you'll see it).
2007-12-17T04:55:00.000Z	sethk	am_	then your browser will update.  Copy the URL it shows, and paste it here.
2007-12-17T04:55:00.000Z	am_	sethk	no i mean what would i put there, i see the site and what to do, but i dont see what i need to paste
2007-12-17T04:57:00.000Z	am_	sethk	i posted it, my name was am_
2007-12-17T04:59:00.000Z	am_	sethk	are you still here?

2007-12-17T05:01:00.000Z	sethk	am_	yes and no, I'm dealing with a client.  I'll be back in a bit.
