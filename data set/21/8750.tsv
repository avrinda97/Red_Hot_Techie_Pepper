2011-10-14T17:29:00.000Z	s1	Andril	if you going to reinstall .. GRUB paramteres worth a try.
2011-10-14T17:30:00.000Z	s1		lemm now if you going to.
2011-10-14T17:37:00.000Z	Andril		S1: reinstalled and it booted - but i didn't check the 2 options in the beginning - so it seems to be the 3rd party items producing the error
2011-10-14T17:44:00.000Z	s1	Andril	Cheers buddy .. Glad it worked for you this time , well done. / i've never check those 3rd party boxs.
