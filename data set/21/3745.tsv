2009-05-29T11:26:00.000Z	ruediix		Hello.  I noticed that synaptic keeps saying that it can't verify the signature on any of the packages.  Does anyone know what might cause this>
2009-05-29T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	run: sudo apt-get update. If you give the error regarding the key I can give you the command
2009-05-29T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	sounds like you added a repo and not its pgp key
2009-05-29T11:29:00.000Z	ruediix	ActionParsnip	It is reporting it in the standard Ubuntu packages.
2009-05-29T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	doesnt mean anything. If you don't have the ke, you don't have the key
2009-05-29T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	if you run: sudo apt-get update   in terminaland give the error about keys I can give you the command to resolve it
2009-05-29T11:31:00.000Z	ruediix	ActionParsnip	OK, I've got something really screwed up.  It's reporting that it is using ftp.debian.org as it's sources.  I have no clue why.
2009-05-29T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	you shouldnt have any debian sources, ubuntu + debian debs = pain
2009-05-29T11:33:00.000Z	ruediix	ActionParsnip	 I never installed those repositories I have no clue how they got there.   I am going to have to do a complete reinstall.
2009-05-29T11:39:00.000Z	ruediix	ActionParsnip	I can't find those debian archives anywhere in the /etc/apt config files
2009-05-29T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file as well as the output of: sudo apt-get update  please
2009-05-29T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	it looks at souces.list in /etc/apt
2009-05-29T11:46:00.000Z	ruediix	ActionParsnip	that's why it's confusing me.  I know that.  Apt-upgrade is not behaving the same as apt-get upgrade
2009-05-29T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	i've never used apt-upgrade only apt-get upgrade
2009-05-29T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	i'm not. i assume nothing in here
2009-05-29T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	due to the wide range of skill set in the channel i treat everyone identically so details are not overlooked as assumed
2009-05-29T11:47:00.000Z	ruediix	ActionParsnip	 OK, then if you know the name of the keyring package so I can reinstall it properly, it would help, otherwise I'll have to go on my own.
2009-05-29T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	here is a script i have for pgpp keys: http://pastebin.com/f2ce47c5f
2009-05-29T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	you give it the last 8 character in the error you get when yu apt-get update and it gets the key for you :D
2009-05-29T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	apt-cache search key | less
2009-05-29T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ruediix	you are now on ignore. I'm trying to help and you are being totally ungrateful
