2005-11-05T14:53:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	pastebin the output of dpkg -L nvidia-glx
2005-11-05T14:54:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	kk - it wasnt installed, prolly an after effect from compiling it or something, how do I get the 7667 module? The legacy package is 7147....
2005-11-05T14:55:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	I just followed the nvidia instructions on the wiki
2005-11-05T14:56:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	lol - with I could do that, but I cant get the window managers to work, can only do this from the cmd line =(
2005-11-05T14:56:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	so you use lynx
2005-11-05T14:56:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	the web doesn't need a GUI
2005-11-05T14:57:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	correction: links
2005-11-05T14:57:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	no, but the wiki, at least the one I went to uses the gui to install it...
2005-11-05T14:57:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	links is a cmd based web browser
2005-11-05T14:58:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	synaptic and apt-get are the same thing, just look for the package names
2005-11-05T14:58:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	I know... the wiki that I went shows you how to upgrade the drivers using the gui from the menus... not the cmdline....
2005-11-05T14:59:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	i've tried installing the kernel modules (the only ones that show up from apt-cache search nvidia), and they are version 7147 - am I doing something wrong?
2005-11-05T14:59:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	if you just read the wiki, you install nvidia-glx and then run sudo nvidia-glx-config-enable
2005-11-05T15:00:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	correction: sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2005-11-05T15:10:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	sry to be a pain here, I've followed directions in the wiki, however I still do not have the kernel module. It says I should be installing  the plain nvidia-glx packages, but ther eis only one nvidia-glx?
2005-11-05T15:11:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	thats all you have to install is nvidia-glx
2005-11-05T15:12:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	but it doesnt seem to install the kernel module?
2005-11-05T15:13:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	what makes you say that?
2005-11-05T15:13:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	no nvidia.ko module to load...
2005-11-05T15:14:00.000Z	NoUse	penguin_	how are you looking for it?
2005-11-05T15:15:00.000Z	penguin_	NoUse	modprobe, find /lib/modules, ls, dpkg -L - simply looking for it
