2006-03-28T09:36:00.000Z	_greg		Hello. Urgent question: Install is sitting at "installing the base system" for like 10 mins at 31%.  DO I NEED to reburn a new disc?
2006-03-28T09:36:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	perhaps run disk test from disk boot menu?
2006-03-28T09:37:00.000Z	_greg		k
2006-03-28T09:37:00.000Z	_greg		Normally, 5-10 minute pauses is NOT OKAY, right???
2006-03-28T09:37:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	that way you can test disk and iso you burnt also
2006-03-28T09:37:00.000Z	_greg		what's disk test command
2006-03-28T09:39:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	boot from cd it in main menu, check disk or somthing, it will test all files needed to install
2006-03-28T09:39:00.000Z	_greg		not work
2006-03-28T09:40:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	if test passes, and install crashes, possible hardware/settings problem
2006-03-28T09:40:00.000Z	_greg		brand new disk
2006-03-28T09:40:00.000Z	_greg		It's a "box" that ran kanotix flawlessly.  I've just put in brand new HDD thought
2006-03-28T09:41:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	what dont work?
2006-03-28T09:41:00.000Z	_greg		It locks up.
2006-03-28T09:41:00.000Z	_greg		during install
2006-03-28T09:41:00.000Z	_greg		I know the hardware. Kanotix SUCKS (support especially).  I want syntax for media check
2006-03-28T09:42:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	new disk could have error still - the cd itself or image you got from net, cd boot menu test will find out.
2006-03-28T09:42:00.000Z	_greg		what's syntax for that?
2006-03-28T09:43:00.000Z	_greg		okay, EVERYONE, what is syntax for media check at install?
2006-03-28T09:43:00.000Z	_greg		syntax for that?
2006-03-28T09:44:00.000Z	_greg	stepore	it's an Aptiva box, with a new Hitachi Deskstar drive in it.
2006-03-28T09:45:00.000Z	moulty	_greg	you CANT miss it, its in the main menu!!.... oh, hold on... is that a dapper only feature people? i forget the breezy install cd?
