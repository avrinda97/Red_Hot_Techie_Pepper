2011-11-14T18:55:00.000Z	roland		hi.. anyone know what is the folder /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.35   used for?
2011-11-14T18:56:00.000Z	roland		is it used for building the kernel?
2011-11-14T18:56:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	I think it is
2011-11-14T20:36:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	use gparted
2011-11-14T20:36:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	not that a small device like that needs alignment
2011-11-14T20:36:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	why not?
2011-11-14T20:37:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	there are contradicting opinions everywhere
2011-11-14T20:37:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	its for advanced format, 4k sector drives, which are usually 1TB and larger
2011-11-14T20:38:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	but gparted starts the partition at the correct location for alingment
2011-11-14T20:39:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	then why all the forums say to create the partition as aligned?
2011-11-14T20:39:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	I talking about SSD's
2011-11-14T20:40:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	how do I know if it is an advanced format drive?
2011-11-14T20:45:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	when a partition starts at sector 2048, which is what gparted does automattically now, its aligned
2011-11-14T20:46:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	what I meant was, why do you think SSD doesn't need alignment when most of the internet seems to think otherwize?
2011-11-14T20:46:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	some ppl think SSD needs it
2011-11-14T20:47:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	it certainly wont hurt it to do so
2011-11-14T20:53:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	so when creating the partition I should select "align to MiB" ?
2011-11-14T20:53:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	you might have to disable that bit - been a few months since Ive done it. try it either way and see what happens
2011-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	what OS you using?
2011-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	compdoc	roland	the partition will start at 2048 when its right
2011-11-14T21:09:00.000Z	roland	compdoc	I think it worked, but I had to specify "align to MiB" and not gparted's info says: first sector 2048
