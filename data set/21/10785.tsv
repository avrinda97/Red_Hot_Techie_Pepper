2005-08-04T05:43:00.000Z	highvoltage		[Spooky] : of course it is.
2005-08-04T05:43:00.000Z	highvoltage		[Spooky] : unless the licens don't allow it
2005-08-04T05:44:00.000Z	highvoltage		[Spooky] : but there's nothing wrong with downloading music videos.
2005-08-04T05:45:00.000Z	highvoltage		saying it's illegal to download music videos is like saying it's illegal to download software.
2005-08-04T05:45:00.000Z	highvoltage		both are perfectly legal, if it's in accordance with the terms of the author.
2005-08-04T05:46:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	incorrect, there are various copyright conventions in most of the the 1st world countries that automatically prohibit any such behaviour
2005-08-04T05:47:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	then where are all these "legal" mp3 downloading coming from?
2005-08-04T05:47:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	from the copy right holders them selves, i get it your being pedantic
2005-08-04T05:48:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	searcher`: is itunes then illegal in the US and Holland?
2005-08-04T05:48:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	please read what i actually type, i think you will find the statements both accurate and fair.  i am not attacking your, particularly with the statement that validates your statement.
2005-08-04T05:49:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	ok
2005-08-04T05:50:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	indeed, technically you are correct
2005-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	searcher`: sorry if it sounded like i wanted to fight/argue, i think i am a bit pedantic at times :)
2005-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	hey no worries
2005-08-04T06:29:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	the expectation with breezy is that you have the knowledge to basically resolve it your self, if not hoary might be a suggestion :)
2005-08-04T06:29:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	i have to do some testing in breezy, and -devel said i should ask here.
2005-08-04T06:30:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	:) i was kidden ehe , its a hard question to answer tho
2005-08-04T06:31:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	ok, i'll try to figure it out myself then... :)
2005-08-04T06:31:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	don't forget the developers mailing lists if you are doing testing
2005-08-09T12:53:00.000Z	highvoltage	holycow	that would be a ctrl+alt+backspace :)
2005-08-09T12:54:00.000Z	holycow	highvoltage	indeedy, hehe :)
