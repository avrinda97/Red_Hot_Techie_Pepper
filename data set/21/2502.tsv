2011-08-07T12:02:00.000Z	wols	theadmin	depends what he wants. my solution might not be what he wants tho
2011-08-07T12:02:00.000Z	theadmin	wols	You don't typically kill flies with a hammer
2011-08-07T12:03:00.000Z	theadmin	wols	He just wants to get rid of visual effects, that's all
2011-08-07T12:03:00.000Z	wols	theadmin	he has bug reporting to do which means he has a problem. so my solution is not as draconian as it seems

2011-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	theadmin	wols	It uses PuTTY in some way
2011-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	wols	theadmin	no. uses cygwin
2011-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	theadmin	wols	Meh, the window title is "Cygterm - PuTTY", and settings are same as PuTTY's.
2011-08-07T14:59:00.000Z	wols	theadmin	it's kern.log there. and in his case, simply dmesg is enough
2011-08-07T14:59:00.000Z	theadmin	wols	Ah, could be true
