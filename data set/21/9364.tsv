2006-07-08T06:20:00.000Z	ThJ		how do i prevent a device driver from loading in ubuntu? i don't want to use my internal sound card as i have a PCMCIA one. also, tell me how to set the global default sound device, as just editing the prefs only affects my own profile.
2006-07-08T06:21:00.000Z	ThJ		why does it say unregged? i'm registered with nickserv!
2006-07-08T06:22:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	did you identify to nickserv?
2006-07-08T06:21:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	this isnt the place for that question
2006-07-08T06:22:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	it isn't? i type /join #ubuntu and it sends me to #ubuntu-unregged
2006-07-08T06:22:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	i figured it had to do with me being nickserv-regged or not.
2006-07-08T06:22:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	yes, in fact that's why i rejoined just now.
2006-07-08T06:23:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	i id'ed with it after joining, so i left and rejoined but it didnt work apparently
2006-07-08T06:23:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	what? i'm identified with it!
2006-07-08T06:23:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	then what's the issue?
2006-07-08T06:24:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	why am i redirected to the unregged channel if i am regged?
2006-07-08T06:24:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	well you seem to be here right now
2006-07-08T06:24:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	my channel status line says #ubuntu-unregged >.>
2006-07-08T06:36:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	what device do you need to disable
2006-07-08T06:37:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	one of my sound cards, a SiS on-board sound card.
2006-07-08T06:37:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	need more details?
2006-07-08T06:37:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	and you want to disable it..?
2006-07-08T06:38:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	that would probably disable your sound entirely
2006-07-08T06:39:00.000Z	ThJ	eobanb	why would it? my PCMCIA sound card uses an entirely different kernel module.
2006-07-08T06:39:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	oh okay.
2006-07-08T06:41:00.000Z	eobanb	ThJ	i believe it was the other four-letter word for poop
