2007-04-23T15:31:00.000Z	andy_		I installed feisty fawn yesterday evening on my notebook and the sound playback worked flawlessly. Today, I started the notebook again and I can't hear a thing. I checked alsamixer, everything is set to the highest level. What else can it be?
2007-04-23T15:32:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	try sudo aplay /dev/urandom... do you hear any static?
2007-04-23T15:32:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	nope, no static
2007-04-23T15:33:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	try sudo esd, do you hear anything?
2007-04-23T15:34:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	nope, no sound/static.
2007-04-23T15:35:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	then you probably have something muted, or its a hardware problem... pastebin the output of 'amixer'
2007-04-23T15:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	suspend/hibernate might cause some things to mute after a driver startup issue
2007-04-23T15:39:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	something weird in the amixer output?
2007-04-23T15:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	i just got it 1 sec
2007-04-23T15:41:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	no looks ok
2007-04-23T15:41:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	try sudo /etc/init.d/alsautils restart
2007-04-23T15:41:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	try sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2007-04-23T15:41:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	no static with aplay /dev/urandom
2007-04-23T15:43:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	can I somehow reinstall the whole sound subsystem?
2007-04-23T15:43:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	i don't think that would do anything, plus don't know how
2007-04-23T15:44:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	okay.
2007-04-23T15:44:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andy_	are you sure its not a hardware issue?
2007-04-23T15:45:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	I'm thinking about it but.... I might try the live cd, check if there is sound
2007-04-23T15:46:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	I will be back in about 10 minutes I think ;)
2007-04-23T15:56:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	no sound in the live CD either
2007-04-23T15:56:00.000Z	andy_	pppoe_dude	it's just so weird will a couple hours ago, I was using my notebook and I had sound.
