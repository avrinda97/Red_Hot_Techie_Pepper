2011-08-14T09:51:00.000Z	crus		Hi guys. im running Ubuntu 11.04 on a white macbook 13", it seems it has crashed trying to run tuxracer.. I can't alt+tab.. or alt+ctrl+del, is there any other way to recover from this kind of crash without pulling the battery?
2011-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	jrib	crus	can you hit ctrl-alt-f1 and get to a tty?
2011-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	crus	jrib	no response.. the machine is responding to pigs however
2011-08-14T09:52:00.000Z	jrib	crus	pigs?
2011-08-14T09:54:00.000Z	crus	jrib	macbook doesn't have a print screen button
2011-08-14T09:55:00.000Z	jrib	crus	you probably need to just hold the power button for about 10 seconds then
2011-08-14T09:56:00.000Z	crus	jrib	indeed.
2011-08-14T09:58:00.000Z	jrib	crus	delete key acts as backspace though
2011-08-14T09:58:00.000Z	jrib	crus	at least mine does
2011-08-14T10:02:00.000Z	crus	jrib	;) just tried it as you said it
2011-08-14T10:03:00.000Z	jrib	crus	yes the other useful one is fn+enter = insert so shift+fn+enter lets you paste what you last selected (like middle click)
2011-08-14T10:03:00.000Z	crus	jrib	nice! thanks for the heads up :)
2011-08-14T10:07:00.000Z	crus	jrib	hmm, shift fn enter doesn't let me paste :O well not in the terminal anyway
2011-08-14T10:07:00.000Z	jrib	crus	you highlighted something with your mouse first?
2011-08-14T10:08:00.000Z	crus	jrib	iv got something on my clipboard, cause i can paste it manually
2011-08-14T10:09:00.000Z	jrib	crus	there are two clipboards in linux.  One is the one your probably used to (ctrl-c to copy, ctrl-v to paste) and the other is the 100 times easier to use one (just highlight what you want to copy, and middle click to paste (or shift-insert))
2011-08-14T10:09:00.000Z	crus	jrib	yep, trying that in the terminal, doesn't work for me
2011-08-14T10:12:00.000Z	jrib	crus	I don't know; if you are in X, it should work
2011-08-14T10:12:00.000Z	crus	jrib	all good, seems i can emulate a middle click on the trackpad by doing a 3 finger tap
2011-08-14T10:16:00.000Z	crus	jrib	another weird thing, when im in an app, say - chromium and i hold in alt.. i can see the File, Edit, View.... come up.. but i cant hold in alt and press F to bring the file menu up?
2011-08-14T10:17:00.000Z	jrib	crus	I don't know
