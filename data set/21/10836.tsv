2004-11-01T14:32:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy		Would someone help a newbie make alsaconfig run?
2004-11-01T14:33:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy		...in exchange for which I will forcast the future
2004-11-01T14:33:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	alsaconf is not shipped with Ubuntu
2004-11-01T14:39:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	Do you know what chipset the soundcard is?
2004-11-01T14:40:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	Have you checked that the volume is up?
2004-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	Nope
2004-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	No mate... can't think of a delecate way to say this... I don't know how!
2004-11-01T14:46:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	What kernel are you running?
2004-11-01T14:46:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	Have you tried updating your system to see if that helps?
2004-11-01T14:47:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	As the final release is out.
2004-11-01T14:47:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	No, I should then?
2004-11-01T14:47:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	...and you already know my next question...
2004-11-01T14:52:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	Synaptic tells me there are no upgrades (I assume this means RC1 became the release version unaltered?)
2004-11-01T14:54:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	I don't know about the release stuff. One of the devs could probably confirm that. When did you install?
2004-11-01T14:55:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	And did you download software off the net during the install, or from the CD?
2004-11-01T14:55:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	All off the ISO, which was d/l about 2 weeks ago.
2004-11-01T14:57:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	I'm happy with command line apt-get in theory, just haven't done it before...
2004-11-01T15:04:00.000Z	TheMuso	KiwiFireGuy	I don't think you have the latest updates then. Go to a terminal, and type sudo apt-get update
2004-11-01T15:05:00.000Z	KiwiFireGuy	TheMuso	Just went through that, says I'm all sweet as... odd?
