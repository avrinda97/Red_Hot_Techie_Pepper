2009-07-16T18:43:00.000Z	elric27		hello
2009-07-16T18:43:00.000Z	elric27		I have a problem building aptitude 0.5 against the libboost-dev libraries
2009-07-16T18:44:00.000Z	elric27		on a amd64
2009-07-16T18:44:00.000Z	elric27		9.04
2009-07-16T18:44:00.000Z	elric27		does anybody know well about this libraries?
2009-07-16T18:45:00.000Z	elric27		yes
2009-07-16T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	in particular you should probably: 1) explain why you want to compile aptitude at all and 2) pastebin commands and error messages
2009-07-16T18:46:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	you didn't do what I asked :/
2009-07-16T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	ok.  Why are you compiling aptitude at all?
2009-07-16T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	but aptitude is in the repositories, why not use that?
2009-07-16T18:50:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	please don't use enter as punctuation and address me if you are speaking to me so it triggers my highlight
2009-07-16T18:50:00.000Z	elric27	jrib	sorry
2009-07-16T18:51:00.000Z	elric27	jrib	it seems the only problem is with the «flyweight» part
2009-07-16T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	my guess is you require a newer version of libboost as the error hints.  Did you check that out?
2009-07-16T18:53:00.000Z	elric27	jrib	the only way I know to check dependencies when compiling is configure, the boost installation was done today
2009-07-16T18:53:00.000Z	elric27	jrib	hold on
2009-07-16T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	reading the documentation is supposed to come first, did you check that?
2009-07-16T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	in fact, it does seem to be the case that flyweight.hpp is included in the version of libboost-dev in karmic and not in the jaunty one.  That is your issue
2009-07-16T18:57:00.000Z	elric27	jrib	thanks a lot,  I guess a  aptitude install from the karmic repositories will sort it out
2009-07-16T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	elric27	note mixing repositories like that isn't supported, make sure you know what you are donig
2009-07-16T18:59:00.000Z	elric27	jrib	I know it's not supported, but I don't want to bring my Debian up to sid, I prefer risking this installation
