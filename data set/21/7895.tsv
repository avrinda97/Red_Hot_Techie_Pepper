2007-10-19T14:41:00.000Z	amarillion		The new screen configuration tool doesn't work for me at all
2007-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	amarillion		I'm trying to get Xinerama to work again
2007-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	known issues there
2007-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	amarillion	cwill1	so I just go back to editing xorg.conf then?
2007-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	no, doesn't work the same anymore :p
2007-10-19T14:43:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	look at the xrandr options, once you get it working there, you can do a similar thing in xorg.conf
2007-10-19T14:43:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	I know
2007-10-19T14:43:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	it's better actually, but different enough to be frustrating
2007-10-19T14:44:00.000Z	amarillion	cwill1	thanks, I guess I just have to deal
2007-10-19T14:44:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	the front end just doesn't work well, but xrandr is working
2007-10-19T14:50:00.000Z	amarillion	cwill1	do you know of any good docs on how to set up xinerama?
2007-10-19T14:50:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	what card?
2007-10-19T14:51:00.000Z	amarillion	cwill1	i810
2007-10-19T14:51:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	google xrandr gutsy, you should get some hits
2007-10-19T15:15:00.000Z	amarillion	cwill1	I manged to get going with xrandr, mainly with the help of this: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2
2007-10-19T15:15:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	good
2007-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	there's a package in synaptic
2007-10-19T15:39:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	compizconfig-settings-manager I think
2007-10-19T15:40:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	uh
2007-10-19T15:40:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	upgrade?
2007-10-19T15:40:00.000Z	cwill1	amarillion	you've probably got a conflict between the manually installed version
