2008-05-25T16:15:00.000Z	dylan_		Could someone discuss a flash problem with me?
2008-05-25T16:16:00.000Z	dylan_		I have the non adobe flash players stuck on my system they say they are uninstalled but they still come up when I try to play a flash video on cbs.
2008-05-25T16:16:00.000Z	dylan_		but they won't play the video
2008-05-25T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	which? gnash?
2008-05-25T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	what package is that?
2008-05-25T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	what package name did you use?
2008-05-25T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	purge the libflash-mozplugin package
2008-05-25T16:23:00.000Z	dylan_	jrib	how do you purge that, Like this [ sudo apt-get purge libflash-mozplugin] ?
2008-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	aptitude purge libflash-mozplugin
2009-11-11T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	the usual kludge is to chattr the file so it isn't mutable, I don't know the "nice" way
2009-11-11T02:10:00.000Z	dylan_	jrib	how do i do that?
2009-11-11T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	man chattr
2009-11-11T02:12:00.000Z	dylan_	jrib	i'm not firmilair with that command could to tell the exact command to type before the file name?
2009-11-11T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	did you read its documentation?
2009-11-11T02:14:00.000Z	dylan_	jrib	so i do " man chattr -e resolv.conf"?
2009-11-11T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	no, type " man chattr " and read
2009-11-11T02:14:00.000Z	dylan_	jrib	I did
2009-11-11T02:16:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	there isn't even a -e switch.... "read" means "read and understand".  I'm asking you to do this because this is not the nice way.  This is the kludge way, so you need to understand what you are doing and remember you did it so in a couple of weeks you aren't back here wondering why you can't edit resolv.conf
2009-11-11T23:55:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	you shouldn't need to do anything then
2009-11-11T23:56:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	stick with the repositories
2009-11-12T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	dylan_	I've told you how to do that at least 2 times now :/
