2007-09-13T12:20:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : what's your /etc/resolv,conf file look like?
2007-09-13T12:20:00.000Z	[nrx] 	cellofellow	nameserver 192.168.1.1
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : is that your router?
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	[nrx] 	cellofellow	yes
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : log in to your router and find out what IT's nameserver(s) is/are.
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	[nrx] 		my isp's
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : and use those.
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	[nrx] 		hm
2007-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	[nrx] 		ok
2007-09-13T12:23:00.000Z	cellofellow		hmm :(
2007-09-13T12:23:00.000Z	[nrx] 	cellofellow	that hasn't worked either
2007-09-13T12:24:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : oh, then I guess change it back.
2007-09-13T12:24:00.000Z	[nrx] 	cellofellow	would it make any difference if i told you that i've had problems getting connected to the router.. and that i've had to use iwconfig manually to get a connection?
2007-09-13T12:25:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : maybe you should disable your ethernet card. sudo ifdown eth0 or whatever it is.
2007-09-13T12:25:00.000Z	[nrx] 	cellofellow	it already is :(
2007-09-13T12:26:00.000Z	[nrx] 		i restarted eth0 and took it down again and now it's working :O

2007-09-13T12:30:00.000Z	cellofellow		[nrx] : I'm befuddled, but that's just me.
