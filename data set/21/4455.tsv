I tried to install totem-xine and set the default backend gstreamer to totem-xine via, sudo update-alternatives --config totem. To no avail. The picture is still bad even though totem does show it is using different codecs.
2008-07-14T03:52:00.000Z	PorkSoda		How would I use the vlc codecs, and or, anyone know another route to improve totem picture
2008-07-14T03:52:00.000Z	PorkSoda		?
2008-07-14T03:53:00.000Z	PorkSoda		Well, I generally use totem because you can simply remove the controls. :) That is a biggie to me hehe
