2005-10-09T12:30:00.000Z	jason_ukfsn	sleepie	I think you need to compile amsn to add video support and make sure you have kernel support (probably just modprobe the relevant module)
2005-10-09T12:30:00.000Z	sleepie	jason_ukfsn	thks for your help, but compiling is not an option for me, i'm newbie in linux :)
2005-10-09T12:31:00.000Z	sleepie		lol for you MikeStyle
2005-10-09T12:32:00.000Z	sleepie		hum
2005-10-09T12:32:00.000Z	jason_ukfsn	sleepie	compiling a package isn't so hard. If there is already a debian/ubuntu package available just apt-get source <packagename> and alter the configuration in the debian/rules file
2005-10-09T12:32:00.000Z	sleepie		ok
2005-10-09T12:32:00.000Z	jason_ukfsn	sleepie	then run dpkgbuild
2005-10-09T12:33:00.000Z	jason_ukfsn	sleepie	if there are build dependancies you will be told
