2007-08-20T06:40:00.000Z	skreet		Well, just to see, really.
2007-08-20T06:40:00.000Z	skreet		I went from AMD 3800+ to AMD 4200+ X2
2007-08-20T06:40:00.000Z	skreet		and VMWare is crashing
2007-08-20T06:40:00.000Z	skreet		FPU Safety errors..
2007-08-20T06:40:00.000Z	skreet		Did some googling, and found that many, many people with X2s using Linux having the same issue.
2007-08-20T06:41:00.000Z	skreet		I'm using SMP capable version.
2007-08-20T06:41:00.000Z	skreet		It seems to be AMD X2 specific.
2007-08-20T06:41:00.000Z	skreet		Hmm
2007-08-20T06:41:00.000Z	skreet		:( Which VMWare?
2007-08-20T06:42:00.000Z	skreet		i'm using 5.5.4 Workstation.
2007-08-20T06:44:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	 oh that'll work too lol
2007-08-20T06:44:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	lol i dont use sound, i just have lines addressed to me highlighted
2007-08-20T06:46:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	i use xchat-gnome :)
2007-08-20T06:46:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	i love it
2007-08-20T06:47:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	its just streamlined, most of the options are there just gotta use more commands
2007-08-20T06:47:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	 IMO xchat is feature bloated with tons of things an average user would almost never need
2007-08-20T06:56:00.000Z	skreet	m0u5e	SFW?
2007-08-20T06:57:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	 sfw?
2007-08-20T06:58:00.000Z	skreet	m0u5e	SFW is the opposite of NSFW, which means "Not Safe For Work"
2007-08-20T06:58:00.000Z	skreet	m0u5e	I was asking if the video you pasted is safe for me to look at work ;)
2007-08-20T06:58:00.000Z	m0u5e	skreet	 oh oh lol, yeah, its just the cheers theme song lol
