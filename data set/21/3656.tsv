2011-03-12T19:54:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	I thought it's japanese, but chinese is possible as well :/ kanji are quite the same
2011-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	it's chinese
2011-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	ruan	MeanEYE	looks like it
2011-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	I had to check... :D
2011-03-13T18:21:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	Places -> Find file
2011-03-13T18:21:00.000Z	ruan	MeanEYE	i mean when i type the file
2011-03-13T18:21:00.000Z	ruan	MeanEYE	in a directory
2011-03-13T18:35:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	true, but why would I when top does the job and I rarely use it
2011-03-13T18:35:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	what's the difference anyway
2011-03-13T18:35:00.000Z	ruan	MeanEYE	i guess htop is more advanced
2011-03-29T18:06:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	IPv4? And can you be more specific with your question?
2011-03-29T18:06:00.000Z	ruan	MeanEYE	yeah ipv4
2011-03-29T18:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	what specificially are you interested in?
2011-03-29T18:08:00.000Z	ruan	MeanEYE	well, how they are assigned
2011-03-29T18:09:00.000Z	MeanEYE	ruan	they can be either static or dynamic. Static ones you assign by hand. Dynamic ones are assigned by DHCP server.
