2005-04-19T08:51:00.000Z	Funraiser		what's the most used desktop environment: gnome or kde?
2005-04-19T08:51:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	in general probably kde, on ubuntu gnome
2005-05-15T06:11:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	what soundchip is it?
2005-05-15T06:01:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	eh?
2005-05-15T06:02:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	don't like that it mentions it is for linux in its name? ;)
2005-05-15T06:03:00.000Z	Funraiser	calc	don't like that it says:"advanced" linux sound architecture
2005-05-15T06:03:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	ok so don't use it :)
2005-05-15T06:04:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	use the non advanced one... OSS
2005-05-15T06:04:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	so why don't you like the word advanced?
2005-05-15T06:08:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	so you hear sounds in gnome not in games?
2005-05-15T06:08:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	the issue is esd in that case
2005-05-15T06:08:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	your soundcard doesn't support multiopen and esd has it open so you have to make the game play through esd
2005-05-15T06:08:00.000Z	Funraiser	calc	exactly
2005-05-15T06:09:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	it has nothing to do with alsa or oss
2005-05-15T06:09:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	it has to do with your soundcard being crap
2005-05-15T06:09:00.000Z	Funraiser	calc	well when i launch vlc it says  oss audio output error: cannot open audio device (/dev/dsp)
2005-05-15T06:10:00.000Z	Funraiser	calc	well it was working perfectly before with warty and with hoary at the beginning
2005-05-15T06:11:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	eh its working now?
2005-05-15T06:11:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	probably esound quits when it isn't needed
2005-05-15T06:11:00.000Z	calc	Funraiser	if its running then you won't be able to play sound with the game (i would guess)
2005-05-15T06:12:00.000Z	Funraiser	calc	i'll check that right now with deus-ex
