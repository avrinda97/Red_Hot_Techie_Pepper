2005-08-21T12:57:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	it needs java
2005-08-21T12:58:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	And since I have java, it's all good? :)
2005-08-21T12:58:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	should be ;) i use bittorrent though
2005-08-21T12:58:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	Oh me too, but sometimes I want to find older things which aren't in torrent form
2005-08-21T12:59:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	i know what you mean, i would guess that limewire is the best p2p client for linux (if it works)
2005-08-21T12:59:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	I'll let you know in a few minutes :D
2005-08-21T12:59:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	great
2005-08-21T13:03:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	Seems to work nicely
2005-08-21T13:05:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	cool, it's nice to use a p2p client for small downloads, but it's a bother to install java on gentoo (i'm trying to get ubuntu for my other computer)
2005-08-21T13:05:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	Ah, took me a while to get it for ubuntu, but once I got it it's a piece of cake
2005-08-21T13:50:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	write yourself a perl script
2005-08-21T13:53:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	Doing it the long way it is :D
2005-08-21T13:54:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	it should not be *too* hard
2005-08-21T13:54:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	I may test it out, but not just now :) gotta learn up on pearl first ;)
2005-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	i found a pdf book that gives a good intro and is not too long, you can read it in one sitting
2005-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	What's it called?
2005-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	picking up perl
2005-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	 http://www.ebb.org/PickingUpPerl/
2005-08-21T13:57:00.000Z	zerboxx	theeil	Awesome, thanks
2005-08-21T13:57:00.000Z	theeil	zerboxx	np
