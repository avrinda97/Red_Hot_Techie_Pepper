2008-02-07T21:52:00.000Z	maximilion		Any easy to install ones in Synaptic that you recommend? Firewall hassle?
2008-02-07T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	transmission goes through port 80 so no port forward or firewall hassle at all
2008-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	ok, will try an apt-get
2008-02-07T23:49:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	not sure about gnash--but flash is working once again--should be in a mirror near you soon
2008-02-07T23:50:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	yesh!
2008-02-07T23:50:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	I installed restricted and gnash... easy to purge/remove?
2008-02-07T23:51:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	sooper sekrit partnership with ubuntu (sshhh!)
2008-02-08T00:21:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	anyone: Looked at themes, but... lots of them and some require installing other stuff... Can you recommend a stylish theme (doesn't HAVE to be OSX) using smaller icons, Tango seems nice, that is easy to install?
2008-02-08T00:22:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	for compiz, or just generally?
2008-02-08T00:25:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	there are tons at gnome look dot org (com?)
2008-02-08T00:26:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	That's exactly my problem... it great! But I'm pretty new to this and I'd like to go on recommendations by seasoned veterans ;)
2008-02-08T00:26:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	well this seasoned veteran (ha! one year plus) has kde, so best to ask the gnome people here ;]
2008-02-08T21:16:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	#ubuntu-devel perhaps?
2008-02-08T21:16:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	Oh. Thought that was for the devs of the distro :)
2008-02-08T21:17:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	yeah likely is, my bad ;]
2008-02-08T23:27:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	up the ram and yes
2008-02-08T23:29:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	you could go minimal install but then all the shiny would be absent
2008-02-09T00:14:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	gnumeric does okay in a pinch
2008-02-09T08:19:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	I think it's an easy fix - probably alsa or gstreamer weren't properly installed before mmusbaudio... will a reinstall of alsa stuff fix it?
2008-02-11T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	maximilion	uninstall flash plugin non free and then reinstall if you mean the one for firefox
2008-02-11T20:38:00.000Z	maximilion	bazhang	Yes, although I will install it for Opera as well
