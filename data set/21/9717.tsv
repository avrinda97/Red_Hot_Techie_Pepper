2005-07-28T16:55:00.000Z	Antinomy		If I create a partition without a mount point, will linux see it?
2005-07-28T16:55:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	fdisk -l will see it, but to use it it will need to be mounted.
2005-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	can I mount it from within linux once it's up and running?
2005-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	yes, of course.
2005-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	thanks!
2005-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	anytime.
2005-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	one more ?
2005-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	sure
2005-07-28T16:57:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	my x86 install of ubu wont see my keyboard. If I plug in an external key board (its a laptop) and I get in, can I fix the internal keyboard from within linux?
2005-07-28T16:58:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	yes, what laptop?
2005-07-28T16:59:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	AMD64 with an x86 install??
2005-07-28T16:59:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	yes, several ubu experts have told me to do it this way...
2005-07-28T16:59:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	that it would be better like that
2005-07-28T16:59:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	it will cause all sorts of problems.
2005-07-28T16:59:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	 forum moderator told me this, some sort of media thing
2005-07-28T05:00:00.000Z	Antinomy	delire	I'll paste the URL
2005-07-28T05:00:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	it's a vastly different architecture. send me the URL yep.

2005-07-28T05:03:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	you're right, you were advised to use the x86 version. odd..
2005-07-28T05:04:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	it will run, but i thought it would have been good awful slow for packages compiled for 64bit
2005-07-28T05:05:00.000Z	delire	Antinomy	right.. well anyway, this is unrelated to the keyboard problem, which should be trivial to fix once booted.
