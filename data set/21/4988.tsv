2008-09-09T16:52:00.000Z	JonnyWilko		*but in gparted
2008-09-09T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	can we have a pastebin of sudo fdisk -l
2008-09-09T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	reading it now
2008-09-09T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	sda5 is unknown type
2008-09-09T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	it is allocated but not formatted
2008-09-09T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	so whats you issue
2008-09-09T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	sudo cfdisk /dev/sda
2008-09-09T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	then start of sda3 is on the end of sda2
2008-09-09T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	look at the start and end blocks
2008-09-09T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	thats not good
2008-09-09T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	its always dells fault ;)
2008-09-09T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	i dont know how to fix the overlap
2008-09-09T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	but does cfdisk allow you to delete sda5?
2008-09-09T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	actually, if you jump into windows you should be able to see the partition and delete it, just make sure you delete the RIGHT ONE
2008-09-09T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	let me websearch
2008-09-09T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	ive only used cfdisk et al interactively
2008-09-09T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	if that does it then great
2008-09-09T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	you'll need sudo
2008-09-09T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	does gparted let you delete the partition?
2008-09-09T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnyWilko	you could try it
