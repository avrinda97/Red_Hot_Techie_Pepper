2004-12-03T10:04:00.000Z	s0cks		How is hoarty comin along? Is it getting less buggy?
2004-12-03T10:04:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	one month into development, with no freezes in sight?
2004-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	it's a *development branch*
2004-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: I KNOW!
2004-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: It has 5 months to come along.
2004-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: With luck, it will be released on time.
2004-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	it will be released on time.
2004-12-03T10:08:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: Anything is possible
2004-12-03T10:09:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: Exactly when can we expect it to be entirely stable? A week before release?
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: How much beta testing will go into it once the finished product is settled up, before release
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	the preview release is in march, and final in april.
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	six months.
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	stable means unchanging, not robust.
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	it will be stable in april.
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: Yes, but a large portion of that goes to coding?
2004-12-03T10:11:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	it's dogfoodable now.
2004-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	unlikely that we'll have a gui installer for this release.
2004-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	no plans.
2004-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: Someone needs to do it.
2004-12-03T10:15:00.000Z	jdub	s0cks	there are no plans for the release after hoary at this stage.
2004-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	s0cks	jdub	: Indeed. Take it one step at a time.
