2007-03-18T14:10:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	have you tried the Safe Graphics option?
2007-03-18T14:11:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	in that case, you should probably download and try the alternate CD. Read ubotu's pm
2007-03-18T14:13:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	did this happen *after* you installed ubuntu?
2007-03-18T14:15:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	read your private message from ubotu please
2007-03-18T14:16:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	there might be, but it's difficult to diagnose this problem remotely.
2007-03-18T14:17:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	you can try the help page on boot options
2007-03-18T14:19:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	the Desktop CD is a live CD
2007-03-18T14:19:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	then you have what you need
2007-03-18T14:20:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	read the private message that ubotu sent and follow the link
2007-03-18T14:20:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	same place you downloaded the Desktop CD
2007-03-18T14:23:00.000Z	Berzerke1	soundray	I don't see where I can download the Alternative CD
2007-03-18T14:27:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	I've answered that.
2007-03-18T14:28:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	it's quite possible that you can get the Desktop CD to work by tweaking boot options
2007-03-18T14:29:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	boot again and read the text on the screen really carefully at each stage.
2007-03-18T14:41:00.000Z	soundray	Berzerke1	ext3 by default. It can use others.
