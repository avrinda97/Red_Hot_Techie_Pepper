2008-04-22T19:30:00.000Z	Gistybit		dpkg-reconfigure is not installed in my 32bit chrooted environment. How do i install it?
2008-04-22T19:31:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	sudo apt-get install debconf
2008-04-22T19:32:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	it says debconf is already the newest version
2008-04-22T19:32:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	dpkg -S dpkg-reconfigure
2008-04-22T19:33:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	debconf: /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure
2008-04-22T19:34:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	ahh.. you already said so. thanks for your help
2008-04-22T19:34:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	edit /etc/environment
2008-04-22T19:34:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	/usr/local/sbin appears to be in PATH in that file, but perhaps it isn't loaded by dchroot ?
2008-04-22T19:35:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	it should be, i have used dchroots in the past without any issues
2008-04-22T19:35:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	hm ok.. perhaps i set up something wrongly..
2008-04-22T19:40:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	you are not allowed to have symblinks from the chroot to out of it
2008-04-22T19:41:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	you're right.. it's in the fstab now i come to think of it
2008-04-22T19:41:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	those are bind mounts, yes, be carefull, if you dont unmount them, you may delete real "mounts" contents
2008-04-22T19:42:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	Exactly. how do i unbind them. Unmount says (of course) that the device is busy
2008-04-22T19:42:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	you must get out of the chroot
2008-04-22T19:43:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	I would recommend you to use schroot instead, is easy to use and safer
2008-04-22T19:43:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	Roger.. i've read about schroot since. Thanks for you help..
2008-04-22T20:20:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	have you tried with a simpler client, like xterm or xclock ?
2008-04-22T20:21:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	yeah. Sorry for bothering you.. DISPLAY was not set.. i got confused amongst my terminal windows. How do i get schroot to do export DISPLAY=:0 automatically?
2008-04-22T20:26:00.000Z	Lamego	Gistybit	hum, I am using schroot and I have no need to setup the DISPLAY env
2008-04-22T20:27:00.000Z	Gistybit	Lamego	hehe thanks
