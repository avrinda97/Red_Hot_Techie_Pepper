2004-11-07T16:31:00.000Z	Matt|		hi there. At the moment i am bringing up my wireless network card by running a script located in my home folder. I would like to get this script to run at startup. i've tried making a symbolic link in my /etc/rcS.d folder but it doesn't work because all the paths in the script are relative to other files found in the home directory. Can anyone help me with this?? would really appreciate it! :)

2004-11-09T16:13:00.000Z	SmokingFire	Matt|	I don't think so with nautilus but perhaps the rules when launching from the console are different.
