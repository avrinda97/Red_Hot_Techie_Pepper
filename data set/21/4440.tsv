2009-03-29T06:05:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		can anyone tell me the big difference between Ubuntu Desktop and Server editions ?
2009-03-29T06:06:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	the server edition is optimized for server use, primarily intended not to be used with a graphical user interface, and it defaults to having very little software installed.  as a server admin, you'll generally know what you want, and you can manually install it.
2009-03-29T06:09:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	PhotoJim	Okay. thanks. here is my situation, I'm a relatively new linux user, but Ive dabbled with Ubuntu for a while now. I had a desktop install on a pc which I was primarily using remotely
2009-03-29T06:10:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	I don't recommend you use a GUI on a server.  better to keep the resources free for actual serving.  the learning curve is steeper but it's manageable.  Desktop, different matter of course.
2009-03-29T06:11:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	PhotoJim	that makes sense. though, im running on a shoddy old Dell Dimension 8200
2009-03-29T06:12:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	the shoddier, the more you don't want to run a GUI. :) my about-to-be-retired server was a modest PII-333 with 768 MB of RAM, but would have easily run ok with 256M of RAM.  no GUI though.
2009-03-29T06:12:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	depends on what you want to do and how much traffic it will handle, of course.  but a modest machine can do a lot if you don't saddle it with handling a GUI.
2009-03-29T06:13:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	you can, you need a boot CD/DVD to get it started, and it will install some packages off CD but the rest off the Internet.
2009-03-29T06:14:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	PhotoJim	by default? what about a via PXE? saves me downloading and burning a cd
2009-03-29T06:14:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	I've never done an Ubuntu installation that way, so I really don't know.
2009-03-29T06:15:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	unless you have a very slow Internet connection, I recommend you do the traditional installation.
2009-03-29T06:17:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	PhotoJim	dont you mean fast?
2009-03-29T06:17:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	no, I said I recommend a standard CD-based installation, *unless* your Internet connection is very slow.
2009-03-29T06:18:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	you can still download it on a slow connection.  but it will take a long time.  if your connection is that slow, best to order a CD, or have a friend burn you one.
2009-03-29T06:18:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	I have a modest broadband connection and it only takes a few minutes for me to download an image.
2009-03-29T06:19:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	ret some rewriteables, then you don't have to waste the disc.
2009-03-29T06:19:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	I have booted off rewriteables many times.  just get good ones.  the best ones are the old, slow, 4x ones.  take longer to burn, but they tend to work a lot more reliably.
2009-03-29T06:20:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	and you can still buy them.  some burners don't support any faster than 4x for rewriteables.
2009-03-29T06:20:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	then you possibly have a bad burner.  CD-RWs should be useable a hundred times or more if you take care of them.
2009-03-29T06:22:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	that's a software issue, or a burner issue.  there is nothing inherently different about burning a data CD-RW versus burning an .iso image to CD-RW.
2009-03-29T06:54:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Iceman_B^Ltop	yes, ext3 strongly recommended over ext2.  it runs well even on very old systems.  I have ext3 on a 486sx25..  not much of a noticeable difference in performance.
