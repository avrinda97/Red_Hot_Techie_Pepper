2009-08-04T22:53:00.000Z	Technocrat		ipconfig or ifconfig ?
2009-08-04T22:53:00.000Z	Technocrat		but it is giving NAT ip
2009-08-04T22:53:00.000Z	Technocrat		I want to check my PPP ip address
2009-08-04T22:53:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	if you're looking for your external IP address and are behind a router that does NAT, ifconfig will only give you the internal IP.  You'll need to use a site like ipchicken.com to find your external
2009-08-04T22:54:00.000Z	Technocrat	firecrotch	there has to be some command to know that
2009-08-04T22:55:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	it's impossible for your computer to find out it's external IP if it's behind a NAT device
2009-08-04T22:55:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	The process HAS to use some external computer
2009-08-04T22:56:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	what are you trying to accomplish exactly?
2009-08-04T22:58:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	chances are your ISP's DHCP server will give you the same address
2009-08-04T22:58:00.000Z	Technocrat	firecrotch	Yeah but it does also give facility to its users to renew it
2009-08-04T23:00:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	You should be able to find it on the web interface to your router/modem
2009-08-04T23:01:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	Rebooting your router/modem may do the trick in renewing your IP
2009-08-04T23:05:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	Well what did you do to get banned from the site?
2009-08-04T23:05:00.000Z	Technocrat	firecrotch	nothing
2009-08-04T23:06:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	the ONLY way you're going to find out your IP is from your router/modem's interface, or using a website like whatismyip.org
2009-08-04T23:06:00.000Z	Technocrat	firecrotch	I know the website
2009-08-04T23:06:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	To be honest, I can't figure out why you refuse to use it then!
2009-08-04T23:14:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	This isn't a Ubuntu support issue, so please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic or elsewhere
2009-08-04T23:15:00.000Z	Technocrat	firecrotch	why not ? I am using ubuntu and from it I cant know my own public ip ?
2009-08-04T23:16:00.000Z	firecrotch	Technocrat	It's not a problem with Ubuntu, it's a problem with you not listening when you've been told about 4 dozens times how to find it.
