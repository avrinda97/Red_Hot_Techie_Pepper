2012-01-03T18:33:00.000Z	Motafoca		i believe its because of the theme inside the initram
2012-01-03T18:33:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 you want to disable the ubuntu load screen that's purple?
2012-01-03T18:34:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 after grub, that is.
2012-01-03T18:34:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 if so, i might have a solution for you
2012-01-03T18:35:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	yes!
2012-01-03T18:35:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	i wanted to replace, but since its not working, i rather remove ;)
2012-01-03T18:36:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 so you want to see basically the text that identifies the thing loading and what not?  in GRUB there's no way atm to remove the purple background behind it.
2012-01-03T18:36:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 you can remove the "ubuntu" loading screen with the orange/white dots though
2012-01-03T18:36:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 that'd be done by your grub defaults
2012-01-03T18:37:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	how to do that?
2012-01-03T18:37:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 gimme a sec, i have to find the conf file to edit
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	i edited /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 you shouldnt edit that file unfortunately
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 that file gets regenerated when a kernel gets installed iirc
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	i know but i hate grub2 :)
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 i asked this on Ubuntu Forums, so i'm going to go find that thread
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	:)
2012-01-03T18:43:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 edit /etc/default/grub as root/sudo, find GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" and remove "splash" from the line, then sudo update-grub2
2012-01-03T18:43:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 if you want to see kernel stuffs too, remove "quiet" from that line too
2012-01-03T18:44:00.000Z	Motafoca	Resistance	ty
2012-01-03T18:44:00.000Z	Resistance	Motafoca	 you can also disable the semi-nice version of the GRUB boot screen, there's basics of grub2 here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275
