2011-08-30T00:27:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		wubi is a virtualized filesystem right?
2011-08-30T00:28:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	WUBI installs an image of Ubuntu in a Windows filesystem
2011-08-30T00:29:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	yeah aka not native
2011-08-30T00:45:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	At that point it makes much more sense to make a proper partition
2011-08-30T19:43:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	You can, as long as you move /boot and replace it after installing. Installing Ubuntu should install grub as well anyway
2011-08-30T19:47:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	grub i don't think sees gpt only grub2
2011-08-30T19:47:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	When I say it installs GRUB I do mean it installs Grub2
2011-08-30T19:48:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	Don't move root, move boot
2011-08-30T19:50:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	right after i install wubi it comes up and says "No root file system defined" so i dont think boot was ever properly installed
2011-08-30T19:51:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	if you're using wubi then that doesn't use GRUB. Wubi uses the standard Windows bootloader to boot itself I believe
2011-08-30T19:54:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	i still get this error after installing wubi "No root file system defined" im sure it has to do with the 2TB hard drive and gtp
2011-08-30T19:55:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	I can't really help you with wubi boot issues. I've never used it or dealt with it
2011-08-30T20:13:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	I don't think grub should require unpartitioned space to work
2011-08-30T20:16:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	you need space available to create /boot
2011-08-30T20:17:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	On Wubi? I guess that makes sense since it'd need to load the image before it could access boot if it were in there
2011-08-30T20:30:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	are you still trying with wubi?
2011-08-30T20:31:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	no side by side installation
2011-08-30T20:32:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	Does gparted pick up any partitions?
2011-08-30T20:32:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	But partitions should exist? Hmm, did you use dd at any point while trying to install grub?
2011-08-30T20:33:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	Polah	i havent installed anything yet i dont want to destroy my partitions and its contents
2011-08-30T20:33:00.000Z	Polah	DrkCodeman	you were trying to install GRUB earlier weren't you?
