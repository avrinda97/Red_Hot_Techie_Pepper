2005-08-23T13:12:00.000Z	bjv		is there a way to make a bootdisk with the ubuntu live cd?
2005-08-23T13:13:00.000Z	bjv		id need a disk image with support for old cdroms, but i dont see any on it.
2005-08-23T13:13:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	is debootstrap installed on the livecd?
2006-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Mount the system as read-only, except for /tmp and /var
2006-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	bjv	cafuego	id like to put the system on a cdrw to start with
2006-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Mebbe do a customised livecd then.
2006-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	bjv	cafuego	it would be hard to get a linux system to boot from a read only disk like this?
2006-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	No, any LiveCD does just that.
2006-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	bjv	cafuego	well, i have some ubuntu live disks, i guess ill look for a tut on how to customize them
2006-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Should be fairly easy.
2006-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Yes, cache != disk
2006-03-03T13:24:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	14.9MB/sec is ~ UDMA33
2006-03-03T13:24:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	The cache read speeds mainly reflect on ram speed
2006-03-03T13:25:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	If you have an ATA133 disk on an ATA133 controller with DMA enabled, yes. 55MB/sec min, up to 65MB/sec
2006-03-03T13:26:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Is the machine busy?
2006-03-03T13:26:00.000Z	bjv	cafuego	not very.
2006-03-03T13:26:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	I get 55.73 (whilst doing other I/O)
2006-03-03T13:28:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Just check that DMA is enabled.
2006-03-03T13:28:00.000Z	cafuego	bjv	Also, are you 100% certain you've got an ATA133 controller and drive?
2006-03-03T13:29:00.000Z	bjv	cafuego	the controller may be ATA100
2006-03-03T13:29:00.000Z	bjv	cafuego	certainly no lower though, ill read into it.
