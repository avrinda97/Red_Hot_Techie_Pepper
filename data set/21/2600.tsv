2009-08-25T22:14:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	what partition is it?
2009-08-25T22:16:00.000Z	dotblank		!paste
2009-08-25T22:17:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	My 500G drive is split into 2 partitions, 1 NTFS and 1 FAT32. Both are visible/detected by winXP. Partitioners in linux do not detect them.\
2009-08-25T22:18:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	can you pastebin "cat /proc/partitions"
2009-08-25T22:18:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	It is in linux as if the hard drive itself does not exist. not even /dev/sda shows up; fdisk, installer, gparted return an empty box as if no hard drives are connected to my system.
2009-08-25T22:19:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	can you type "watch "dmesg | tail"" and unplug the drive and plug it back in
2009-08-25T22:20:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	it should come up withs ome events
2009-08-25T22:21:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	cant get wireless working; give me a moment while I bridge ethernet to it and reboot into a liveCD to do the command
2009-08-25T22:23:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	I'll try the "watch "dmsg | tail"", though this drive is physically mounted in my PC. Unplug sata while in livecd, perhaps?
2009-08-25T22:24:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	yea you can do that sata is hotswapable
2009-08-25T22:25:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	it just seems a bit dangerous unmounting a HD which is configured for windows performance (data is not all saved on drive)
2009-08-25T22:25:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	what do you mean windows performance?
2009-08-25T22:25:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	if your doing some time of software raid that changes everything
2009-08-25T22:27:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	nvm, thats from when I formatted a new 750G in FAT32 last night, winXP gives options to allow for prompting to unplug or no prompting
2009-08-25T22:28:00.000Z	swayric		this drive is my main drive, though. unplugging it while booted into liveCD won't hurt anything?
2009-08-25T22:28:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	--on a ntfs fs mounted in linux being forcably unplugged
2009-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	if it isnt mounted and you run sync before uinplugging it should be fine
2009-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	swayric	dotblank	"sync" ?
2009-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	dotblank		!sync
2009-08-25T22:30:00.000Z	swayric		--me neither, ubottu
2009-08-25T22:31:00.000Z	dotblank	swayric	its a command that finishes all io to disks or rather waits for all io to disks to finish
