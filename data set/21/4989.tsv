2012-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	koko_		Hello, is anyone able to offer any help with how enable a wireless connection please?  I've been trying for hours and I'm close to throwing my laptop out of the window
2012-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	what wifi chip does it use?
2012-08-13T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	how have you been trying 'for hurs' without knowing the wifi chip!?
2012-08-13T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	what could you possibly achieve without knowing the chip
2012-08-13T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	if you run: sudo lshw -C network      the product line will tell you the chip, what is it?
2012-08-13T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	also do you dual boot?
2012-08-13T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	also, what is the output of:    lsb_release -sc
2012-08-13T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	can you give the output of the commands I gave please, the lshw command will be large but we only need one line
2012-08-13T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	did you disable the ability for the wireless chip to wake up the system as well as disable power management. This can affect how the device works in other OSes because windows is garbage
2012-08-13T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	scroll up
2012-08-13T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	(11:48:55) ActionParsnip: koko_: also, what is the output of:    lsb_release -sc
2012-08-13T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	in the lshw command, what is the product line of the wireless?
2012-08-13T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	and the lsb_release -sc   command please
2012-08-13T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	thanks, what exactly have you been doing for these hours you have tried to get this working when you didn't even know the wifi chip?
2012-08-13T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	genuine question, what have you tried?
2012-08-13T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	disable the adapter's ability to wake up the system as well as power management, it helps in dual boots
2012-08-13T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	in windows device manager
2012-08-13T16:19:00.000Z	koko_	ActionParsnip	 Hi, I just came back to say thanks for your patience and support earlier with regard to my wireless problem.  I have resolved the issue now with the commands: rfkill list all;  rfkill unblock all.    Thank you
2012-08-13T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	add that to your startup and it will run automagically
2012-08-13T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	koko_	glad you got the gold
2012-08-13T16:21:00.000Z	koko_	ActionParsnip	 thanks!
