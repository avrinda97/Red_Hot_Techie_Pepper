2007-02-16T09:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	iirci is something like that now using irssi
2007-02-16T09:24:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	can I do it permanent or do I have to check it every time I login?
2007-02-16T09:31:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	do you know a way to show open apps on the upper part of the screen, I removed the bottom bar in order to use a starterbar there??
2007-02-16T09:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	you have to add the applet (windows list iirc) to the panel
2007-02-16T09:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	apps thing
2007-12-07T17:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	i thought it was asking hwo to recover a windows boot sector... my mistake
2007-12-07T17:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	has /etc/rc.local execution bit on?
2007-12-07T17:22:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	yes, it executes fancontrol fine
2007-12-07T17:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	i take you used full path to file.wav.... aplay /full/path/to/file.wav
2007-12-07T17:27:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	 yes
2007-12-07T17:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	maybe introducing a delay? sleep n (in seconds)
2007-12-07T17:32:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	maybe, I'm gonna try to put another wave file in and see how it works
2008-02-09T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	sebrock	a livecd
2008-02-09T19:47:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	yes, I thought someone would say that. However, I have to do this backup on a headless server. So I have to get access through ssh in order for me to do this remote... thats the problem
2008-02-09T19:51:00.000Z	sebrock	erUSUL	so thats why I need at least a rescue CD that will perform a DHCP and activate a SSH session for remote logins
