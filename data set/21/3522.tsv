2008-12-02T21:53:00.000Z	Markopotomus		I just downloaded some ati drivers and the file suffix is .run ... what am I supposed to do with it?
2008-12-02T21:53:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	run it?
2008-12-02T21:54:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	Yes, I'd have thought so... any idea how?
2008-12-02T21:54:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	I'd guess they're binaries, so you make them executable (+x) and then run them.
2008-12-02T21:54:00.000Z	pluma		Err scripts, i mean.
2008-12-02T21:54:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	sorry, I'm still not with you. How'd I do that?
2008-12-02T21:55:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	Right click, properties, make executable.
2008-12-02T21:55:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	in the Permissions tab
2008-12-02T21:56:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	or from the commandline chmod +x <filename> (no brackets)
2008-12-02T21:56:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	ok - I dont actually see a "make executable" command in the Permissions tab. Just access options
2008-12-02T21:56:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	It's not called that.
2008-12-02T21:56:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	or... no, yes I do.
2008-12-02T21:57:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	"allow executing file as program"
2008-12-02T21:57:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	exactly.
2008-12-02T21:57:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	*does so*
2008-12-02T21:57:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	Now you should be able to run it.
2008-12-02T21:58:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	It says I need to run it as a super user, but doesnt give me an option to enter a root password. I guess that means I have to do it from the command line anyway?
2008-12-02T21:58:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	I'd guess so.
2008-12-02T21:59:00.000Z	pluma	Markopotomus	Unless there's a right-click option for files "Open as administrator" like there is for directories.
2008-12-02T21:59:00.000Z	pluma		Is there a way to DOWNgrade from 8.10 to 8.04 LTS? 8.10 kinda shot down half my system.
2008-12-02T21:59:00.000Z	Markopotomus	pluma	rww: there we go :)
