2006-11-08T14:54:00.000Z	macdo_		How can I mount an external HD via USb when it's not recognised?
2006-11-08T14:54:00.000Z	macdo_		it used to do it automatically under Dapper, but not apparently with edgy...
2006-11-08T14:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	Make it become  recognised. Do 'tail -f   /var/log/messages' and stick the drive in (only use the back usb ports at the moment)
2006-11-08T14:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	after you plug it in 'dmesg' should have 'sdd1' or sda1 or something.
2006-11-08T14:58:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30678/ is the output from dmesg
2006-11-08T15:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	Right. Doesn't like it.
2006-11-08T15:01:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	no, it doesn't. And I don't know why. Ironically; it has all my pre-upgrade backups on it... not good news
2006-11-08T15:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	HDD is it? Powered?
2006-11-08T15:03:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	yeah, a IDE HD in a box, powered, even ventilated
2006-11-08T15:10:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	no ideas to mount this rather inconsiderate (replace last words by a big bad 4 letter...) HD?
2006-11-08T15:12:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	modprobe -l |grep hci
2006-11-08T15:13:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30681/
2006-11-08T15:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	'lsmod |grep hci
2006-11-08T15:14:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30683
2006-11-08T15:20:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	I can't think of why it's not finding it. You are trying in the back usb ports right?
2006-11-08T15:22:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	yup, and I've tried in several different ports, just in case
2006-11-08T15:34:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	do you reckon that a clean edgy reinstall would help?
2006-11-08T15:35:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	because otherwise it's a clean Dapper reinstall, dammit!
2006-11-08T15:35:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	Shouldn't need to. But I can't think of options at the moment.
2006-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	macdo_	gyaresu	the external drive has *all* my data on it, and i sort of need it...
2006-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	macdo_	of course.
