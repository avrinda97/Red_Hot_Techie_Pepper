2010-09-01T09:50:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	banshee is definitely slimmer than amarok, but still has nifty web integration. Rythmbox is great if you just want a straight up player
2010-09-01T09:51:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	I already have mpd for web integration, just want a player that's slim.
2010-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	I'm impressed, Rhythmbox looks like it's not crap.
2010-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	good deal
2010-09-01T10:03:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	Nevermind, it doesn't properly scan the folder I told it to, and it's got a ton of import errors on the first attempt. It also seems to not have a file system browser.
2010-09-01T10:05:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	are you running gnome?
2010-09-01T10:06:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	look into ario
2010-09-01T10:06:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	and goggles
2010-09-01T10:06:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	Ario is a front-end to mpd.
2010-09-01T10:06:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	maybe those will behave better for you
2010-09-01T10:07:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	ya
2010-09-01T10:07:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	is that a problem?
2010-09-01T10:07:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	see if you like goggles
2010-09-01T10:08:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	mpd front-ends tend to not have many features.
2010-09-01T10:08:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	Okay, thanks.
2010-09-01T10:08:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	Amarok has lots of features, but it seems to have been written by idiots, because it barely performs.
2010-09-01T10:10:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	ya, amarok sucks in performance. But if you like it otherwise, it might be worth trying out the mysql backend for it, it does speed it up substantially
2010-09-01T10:10:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	and banshee is good if you haven't already tried it
2010-09-01T10:10:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	i have never used goggles, but I have always wanted to, it looks cool. Might be just what you are after
2010-09-01T10:11:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	coldboot|home	agreed
2010-09-01T10:11:00.000Z	coldboot|home	noisewaterphd	Where is goggles? It's not in the apt-cache at all.
