2007-05-05T08:27:00.000Z	Vastlee		joiningtheheard: I mounted it, but it said I do not have permission to view the contents under d2 (which is what I named the folder)
2007-05-05T08:29:00.000Z	Vastlee		Please tell me I didn't just make 200 gigs worth of data useless...
2007-05-05T08:29:00.000Z	joiningtheherd	Vastlee	 run mount with no options to check to make sure the disk is mounted where you think it is.  then if it is run 'ls -l /media' to see who owns it and the permissions
2007-05-05T08:30:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	It says /dev/sdb1 on /media/d2 type ntfs (rw)
2007-05-05T08:36:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	Understood, running them now.  But I think it's telling me I can't do it cause after each thing it's saying "Read-only file system"
2007-05-05T08:37:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	Couldn't change the permissions of "d2" because it is on a read-only disk
2007-05-05T08:39:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	No idea what you mean.  I ran both of those commands you told me but nothing has changed.  It keeps acting like the disk is Read only
2007-05-05T08:40:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	mount | grep sdb
2007-05-05T08:41:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	/dev/sdb1 on /media/d2 type ntfs (rw)
2007-05-05T08:42:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	But I don't know what it means or how to change it so that I can see the contents and what not.
2007-05-05T08:45:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	What does it mean?  The rw means readable & writable right?
2007-05-05T08:47:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	Again you're talking over my level of technical competency.  Either way, what would be the next step to making this capable of being read and edited?
2007-05-05T08:50:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	Ok.  But before I unmounted this drive I could at least see the files.  I couldn't delete them, but I could see them.  Now I can't even see them.  The data is there because when you had me run those 2 commands it was attempting to preform actions on all of the files.  Yet, I still cannot see them.
2007-05-05T08:51:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	Yeah, but I can't see them.   Much less edit or delete them.
2007-05-05T08:52:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	I don't know what Edgy is.
2007-05-05T08:52:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	I am new to Linux & Ubuntu.
2007-05-05T08:54:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	I don't even know what Edgy is.
2007-05-05T08:55:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	I'm assuming it is an older version of Ubuntu, but I don't know.  This fiesty is the first version I've ever tried.
2007-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	No, I don't even know what X server is.
2007-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	Yeah, Ubuntu
2007-05-05T09:01:00.000Z	Vastlee	joiningtheherd	*sigh*  I don't even know what that means.  All I want to do is mount this drive and be able to use the data on it.
