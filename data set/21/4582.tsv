2008-05-14T15:45:00.000Z	idefine		what ssh client would you guys recommend on windows? just wanted to know if anyone has found anything really nice
2008-05-14T15:47:00.000Z	idefine		also is there a way to get a linux like command line in windows? without cygwin or gnu-tools, like something similar to linux, to replace cmd.
2008-05-14T15:49:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i think u need cygwin
2008-05-14T15:49:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i think windows has the new shell come with vista
2008-05-14T15:49:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i forgot the name, something like powershell
2008-05-14T15:50:00.000Z	idefine	kelvin911	yeah, that's it, but i still think that's pretty crappy.
2008-05-14T15:50:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i dont know if powershell will run on xp or not
2008-05-14T15:50:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i use xp to play games so i dont care
2008-05-14T15:50:00.000Z	idefine	kelvin911	hah, nice.
2008-05-14T15:51:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i am done with computers i am not in university anymore
2008-05-14T15:51:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i wish i have switched to linux earlier when i am still in university
2008-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	idefine	kelvin911	I agree, the earlier the better, they reall should teach children linux.
2008-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	i agree

2008-05-14T15:53:00.000Z	kelvin911	idefine	even i am math major, many math softwares are using unix
2008-05-14T15:53:00.000Z	idefine	kelvin911	i meant 4th graders.
