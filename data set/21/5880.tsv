2007-07-24T07:57:00.000Z	tenengines		Hey There - new to linux - downloaded the Firstclass email client and followed the install instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirstClass  .
2007-07-24T07:57:00.000Z	tenengines		The install seemed to go fine, but I can't find the app anywhere to open it.
2007-07-24T07:58:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	try running /usr/bin/fcc from a terminal
2007-07-24T08:00:00.000Z	tenengines	cdemwell	 no directory found.  I used the terminal install when I installed it.
2007-07-24T08:00:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	I think they missed a step
2007-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	find the .deb that you downloaded and sudo dpkg -i fcc-8.315-2-Linux-i686.deb
2007-07-24T08:04:00.000Z	tenengines	cdemwell	 thanks - found it and now installing.  Since you are on a roll, I just installed ubuntu 7.04.  Why would it say that I'm not the owner of my own disk and partitions?
2007-07-24T08:05:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	Linux is a multi-user system, and does not make you a superuser by default - that means that your user doesn't have permission to modify some files. This is a GOOD thing, because it means that the system is protected from software acting on your behalf
2007-07-24T08:06:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	When it talks about "ownership", your interface is telling you that your user does not own the files. Under the UNIX file security model each file has an owner and a group-owner, and then read, write, and execute permissions can be given to the owner, the group, or "other", meaning everyone
2007-07-24T08:07:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	many users can be in any particular group, and of course "other" means any user at all
2007-07-24T08:08:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	one gotcha you might look out for is that directories (which means folders) require "execute" permission to be opened (with the cd command or by double-clicking)
2007-07-24T08:08:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	does that answer your question?
2007-07-24T08:13:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	you might need to use sudo to do it
2007-07-24T08:13:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	You ought to be able to change the name from the properties dialogue... I haven't done it that way ever, mind you :)
2007-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	tenengines	cdemwell	 yeah that's what I would think too, but it won't let me.  When you look at the owner in properties - it says "unknown"
2007-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	hmmmm, what sort of drive is it?
2007-07-24T08:15:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	I see what you mean, it's probably because the name of the drive is the mount point of said drive
2007-07-24T08:16:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	I only know how to do this the "expert" way, as I  learned to do this stuff a long time ago
2007-07-24T08:16:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	thus, someone else would be better to help you I think
2007-07-24T08:17:00.000Z	tenengines	cdemwell	- thanks for the help firstclass is now up and running at least.  good night.
2007-07-24T08:17:00.000Z	cdemwell	tenengines	good night and good luck
