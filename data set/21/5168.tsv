2010-04-03T01:58:00.000Z	soreau	karan	Looks like glx is not working for some reason. Can you pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log file?
2010-04-03T02:02:00.000Z	soreau	karan	From what you have shown, I can just about guarantee compiz isnt working either. Can you pastebin your X log? /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-04-03T02:07:00.000Z	soreau	karan	Can you please pastebin your X log?
2010-04-03T02:10:00.000Z	soreau	karan	Or, can you pastebin the output of 'dpkg -l|egrep "fglrx|nvidia"' ?
2010-04-03T02:19:00.000Z	soreau	karan	?
2010-04-03T02:20:00.000Z	soreau	karan	That is the problem.
2010-04-03T02:20:00.000Z	soreau	karan	The fglrx driver does not support your card
2010-04-03T02:21:00.000Z	soreau	karan	You need to remove all the fglrx packages and reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx and libgl1-mesa-dri
2010-04-03T02:21:00.000Z	soreau	karan	Then reboot after that
2010-04-03T02:23:00.000Z	soreau	karan	In any event, you shouldn't install any driver for this card in ubuntu because the default radeon driver has 3D already working
2010-04-03T02:23:00.000Z	soreau	karan	And the alternative fglrx doesn't have support for your gpu anymore
