2006-12-19T11:24:00.000Z	CarCase928		is there a way to run MAC software and open MAC files on Ubuntu?
2006-12-19T11:25:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 I know you can mount udf floppies and cds under ubuntu, and depending on the file, linux should be able to read them...
2006-12-19T11:26:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 as for mac emulation for apps (like wine for windows stuff)... not sure of any such tools :P
2006-12-19T11:27:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 if you can give me a moment, I can poke around and see what's there for mac emulation...
2006-12-19T11:27:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	ok
2006-12-19T11:28:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 specifically, what app were you trying to run?
2006-12-19T11:28:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 because many of the 'base' tools are now the same (seeing that OS X is based upon BSD)
2006-12-19T11:31:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 I see a couple mac OS9 emulators out there for linux, but that's about it
2006-12-19T11:31:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	i am trying to run a 3rd party client for Tencent QQ, the linux versions don't work and are out of date, so my only option is the mac version
2006-12-19T11:31:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	where do i find them?
2006-12-19T11:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 reading the wiki on that app, give me a moment
2006-12-19T11:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 there's a gaim plugin for it :)
2006-12-19T11:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 http://openq.sourceforge.net/
2006-12-19T11:33:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	i tried that, it doesn't work
2006-12-19T11:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 there's also a native linux client, it appears - http://sourceforge.net/projects/evaq
2006-12-19T11:34:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	wanted to try that, but there is no linux install file for it, just a source, and i am new at linux, so i can't use that
2006-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 finally, if all that doesn't work... you should be able to use Wine to use the 'official' Windows client
2006-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	it's not cpompatible with wine
2006-12-19T11:36:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	the official windows version crashes before it loads when i use it with wine
2006-12-19T11:36:00.000Z	SilentDis	CarCase928	 what error does it kick out, if any?
2006-12-19T11:38:00.000Z	CarCase928	SilentDis	no errors with wine, but the app it self kicks out an error, but the message is in Chinese, and i don't know much Chinese, i know very little, and i am using their English version.
