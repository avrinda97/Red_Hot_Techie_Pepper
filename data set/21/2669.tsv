2009-08-02T01:19:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	what sound card?
2009-08-02T01:20:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	Good question.. I have no idea how to check it with ubuntu, and I don't remember it..
2009-08-02T01:21:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	open a terminal via Applications>Accessories>Terminal and type out lspci (thats LSPCI in lower case) and copy over *just* the sound line, please
2009-08-02T01:24:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	thats an.. odd card.. ok, through System>Administration>Hardware Drivers activate the drivers for whatever it finds, i got an inkling that your going to find a few
2009-08-02T01:28:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	that was the other thing i was going to suggest, but i wanted to make sure you have drivers for it first
2009-08-02T01:29:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	When I open the hardware drivers, I only get 2 options..  Both for my graphic card
2009-08-02T01:30:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	well, do as DouglasK said, and you might want too activate one of those drivers if you plan on gaming
2009-08-02T01:30:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	I already have the latest one
2009-08-02T01:31:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	ok, as DouglasK said, open your Volume controlls and make sure most are at %100 except PCM which should stay around 80
2009-08-02T01:32:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	My computer peeps, when I backspaces to much... ?
2009-08-02T01:32:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	thats internal speaker..
2009-08-02T01:39:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	Still doesn't work
2009-08-02T01:39:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	hmm.. laptop or desktop?
2009-08-02T01:41:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	is the card built into the mobo or is it a pci card?
2009-08-02T01:44:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	not sure :\
2009-08-02T01:45:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	I got a new error however,  When I try to install Adobe flash player, I get Error: Wrong architecture 'i386'
2009-08-02T01:46:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	thats because you have a 64 bit system, you should try installing through synaptic
2009-08-02T02:22:00.000Z	N1ke_	gartral	I solved it, tho I have yet again, another problem
2009-08-02T02:23:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	thats good, but whats your new problem?
2009-08-02T02:24:00.000Z	gartral	N1ke_	system>preferences>sound play around in there till you have it where you like it
