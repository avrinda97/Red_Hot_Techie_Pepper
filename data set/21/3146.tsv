2011-12-29T16:23:00.000Z	new2linx		is there an ubuntu irc channel for legal usage of ubuntu logo etc etc
2011-12-29T16:23:00.000Z	new2linx		and for making money by installing and admin'ing an ubuntu server?
2011-12-29T16:24:00.000Z	new2linx		ok, thanks
2011-12-29T16:24:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	for the second you dont need to ask someone
2011-12-29T16:24:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	for the first, there is a licence for the usage of the logo
2011-12-29T16:24:00.000Z	new2linx	iceroot	oh, and you think it's legal for me to sell ubuntu and adminitster legally?
2011-12-29T16:24:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	of course
2011-12-29T16:25:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	you can of course sell ubuntu
2011-12-29T16:25:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	the one you are not allowed to do is so remaster ubuntu to something else and sell it as "ubuntu"
2011-12-29T16:26:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	but the normal ubuntu versions you can sell as many as you want to any price
2011-12-29T16:27:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	but!! if you sell ubuntu you have to grant access to the sources
2011-12-29T16:27:00.000Z	new2linx	iceroot	of course
2011-12-29T16:27:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	but the sources are public so you dont have to do anything aditional
2011-12-29T16:29:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	but the better idea would be to provide ubuntu as free (as in free beer) and give payed support
2011-12-29T16:29:00.000Z	new2linx	iceroot	correct sir. :-)
2011-12-29T16:29:00.000Z	iceroot	new2linx	or what would be very interesting for us "sell hardware with preinstalled ubuntu"
2011-12-29T16:32:00.000Z	new2linx	iceroot	that's the end goal. i am trying to locate a smaller tech company that already has connection with major hardware vendors. :-)
