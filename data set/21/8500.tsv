2007-08-12T09:46:00.000Z	tanath		using compiz-fusion, if i run a GUI app with sudo, it has no window decorations. anyone know how to fix this?
2007-08-12T09:46:00.000Z	tanath		yep
2007-08-12T09:46:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	not sure about compiz, but use gksudo
2007-08-12T10:01:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	be nice if i could :P
2007-08-12T11:03:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	why?
2007-08-12T11:04:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	it does, that is where the firmware file wl_apsta.o is stored, and it's over quota
2007-08-12T11:04:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	he shouldn't be installing anything with files hosted there
2007-08-12T11:04:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	trust me, that's how it works
2007-08-12T11:05:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	i didn't say it didn't work that way
2007-08-12T11:05:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	and it used to work, but the server is not longer working
2007-08-12T11:16:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	Mr_Bomb they don't depend on each other, bcm43xx-firmware is not in ubuntu's repos, it's the one he got from cafuego
2007-08-12T11:16:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	the firmware must be depending on the fwcuttter
2007-08-12T11:17:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	heh, finger-stutter there
2007-08-12T11:43:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	ubuntu recently changed to dash as the default shell for sh, which sometimes causes issues
2007-08-12T11:44:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	yeh, and my default is zsh, but i don't think it's caused much in the way of probs for me yet
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	your sh is still linked to dash, otherwise system startup scripts wouldn't work
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	hrm. i suppose so
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	ls -l /bin/sh
2007-08-12T11:46:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	yeh, already checked
2007-08-12T11:46:00.000Z	tanath	astro76	actually used file, but meh
2007-08-12T11:46:00.000Z	astro76	tanath	ah nice
