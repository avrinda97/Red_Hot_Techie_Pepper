2009-06-22T08:31:00.000Z	dtownhero	Shervin	gparted must run as root, therefore sudo gparted
2009-06-22T08:32:00.000Z	Shervin	dtownhero	I'm on the LiveCD and it says that it cannot be displayed with sudo gparted
2009-06-22T08:33:00.000Z	dtownhero	Shervin	oh I am not sure how to use gparted w/ the live cd... what are you trying to do?
