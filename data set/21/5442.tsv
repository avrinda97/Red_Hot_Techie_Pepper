2007-10-13T07:45:00.000Z	flyingfree		i TRIED THAT LAST night and really messed up my computer, had to reinstall dapper from scratch
2007-10-13T07:46:00.000Z	flyingfree		kept telling my xserver had a problem on reboot and that it would put me in gdm, not enough of a ubuntu genius to have a lcue how to use the terminal that well

2007-10-13T07:48:00.000Z	flyingfree		do all verisons of ubuntu come with xubuntu option?
2007-10-13T07:48:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	all relatively recent ones surely do. at least since breezy
2008-01-08T05:19:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	did you by any chance attempt to change your hostname?
2008-01-08T05:19:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	if you type « groups » from your user does "admin" show up?
2008-01-08T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	short answer, boot with init=/bin/sh and adduser yourself admin
2008-01-08T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	you reach your GRUB menu and select recovery mode
2008-01-08T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	the GRUB menu is the menu you see when you boot. if you don't see one, hit Esc right after the BIOS hands control to the bootloader, i.e. ... just keep hitting Esc until something happens ;)
2008-01-08T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	no, init=/bin/sh is a kernel parameter, and an alternative to recovery mode. disregard it, recovery mode should do it find
2008-01-08T06:17:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	you can always start irssi from recovery mode
2008-01-08T06:17:00.000Z	LjL	flyingfree	if you need assistence while in recovery mode
2008-01-08T06:38:00.000Z	flyingfree	LjL	and Kojire (?) thanks!!
2008-01-08T06:41:00.000Z	flyingfree	LjL	thanks
