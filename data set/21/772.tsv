2011-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	classico		hello, i'm trying to install ubuntu-alternative-11.04 on a netbook, from a USB external hard drive (not a USB stick), but I don't find a tool to make my usb external hard drive bootable.
2011-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	classico		there's not usb-creator.exe in the .iso
2011-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	classico		and unetbootin does not recognize my usb external hard drive
2011-06-19T07:05:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	I remember once having the option to "install from a .iso on another partition" but I could never find it again. It might have been in an alternate CD, a server CD, or a mini.iso
2011-06-19T07:06:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	alternatively, if you have another machine, you could install LAMP on there, and then do a 'network install' (I can find the howto if you want). You might need a CD (or USB) to boot the mini.iso
2011-06-19T07:06:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	i managed to install several other linux os like debian or even ubuntu-desktop but i can't find a way for the ubuntu-alternate version
2011-06-19T07:08:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	I see. Do you have a windows machine that you can use? Do you have another USB flash drive that you can use?
2011-06-19T07:08:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	is the ubuntu-alternate.iso the only thing on your external HDD?
2011-06-19T07:10:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	what do you mean? i need to make it bootable, so I tried with usb-universal-installer and unetbootin
2011-06-19T07:10:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	ok. Try the multi-boot from pendrivelinux (I am trying to find it, they seem to have a new one http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/
2011-06-19T07:11:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	i'm trying, i'll keep you updated, thanks!
2011-06-19T07:12:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	I am still trying to find the old one that I use, it uses grub legacy so it is easy to edit the menu.lst
2011-06-19T07:13:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	so far no pb
2011-06-19T07:14:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	pb?? what do you mean? I think pendrivelinux no longer offers the old one for download, if YUMI doesnt work, then I could upload it for you. Try YUMI first and see if it works.
2011-06-19T07:20:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	pb = problem, so i meant "no problem so far". the installer is installing, so I guess that will work
2011-06-19T07:20:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	thanks a lot!
2011-06-19T07:22:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	i spoke to early, the installer expect a cd-rom, the alternate install must be a cd-rom only install
2011-06-19T07:23:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	ok, I remember a way to fix that (kinda). I actually cannot remember exactly, it has to do with a config in the grub boot.
2011-06-19T07:23:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	I found this while searching: http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/insert-multiple-iso-images-into-single-multiboot-usb-iso-file-with-xboot/
2011-06-19T07:23:00.000Z	knoppies	classico	never used it, might be useful.
2011-06-19T07:35:00.000Z	classico	knoppies	didn't work with YUMMY, i'm trying with xboot but i doubt it will work, anyway thanks for your help
