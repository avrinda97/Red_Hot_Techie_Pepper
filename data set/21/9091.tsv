2007-05-10T15:12:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	Adntu: The ones I'm trying to rename has a number in it. I'm fairly good with regex, but I can't figure out how to make the number corrospond.
2007-05-10T15:13:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	Adntu: like foo_1.bar
2007-05-10T15:13:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	example?
2007-05-10T15:13:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	what do you want to rename it to?
2007-05-10T15:13:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	lets say, "bar_1.bar"
2007-05-10T15:14:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	and foo_2.bar -> bar_2.bar?
2007-05-10T15:14:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	yep.
2007-05-10T15:14:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	up to 12.
2007-05-10T15:14:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	rename "s/^foo/bar/" foo*
2007-05-10T15:14:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	try with -n of course
2007-05-10T15:15:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	brb
2007-05-10T15:17:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	properly modified, it worked. thanks.
2008-03-07T07:16:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	yes
2008-03-07T07:16:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	x11vnc can do that
2008-03-07T07:17:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	just what I was looking for. thanks.
2008-03-07T07:17:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	I have: vnc is aliased to `cd; nohup x11vnc -display :0 -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd &'
2008-03-07T07:21:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	why the nohup?
2008-03-07T07:22:00.000Z	dooglus	recon	so I can close the terminal and have the vnc server live on
2008-03-07T07:22:00.000Z	recon	dooglus	oh.
