2006-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	duckdown		Can someone tell me if there is a package for a MUD client?  Apparently KMUD and KMUDDY aren't available, or are my sources misconfigured still? :-(
2006-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	your sources may still be misconfigured
2006-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	I apparently activated UNIVERSE through Synaptic
2006-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	Do you have any kmud* packages?
2006-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	enable multiverse, too
2006-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	i do not.
2006-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	ubotu has blessed you with knowledge
2006-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	 im pretty sure ive seen that, but ill look again
2006-01-15T11:19:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	no. search synaptic for 'libqt3'
2006-01-15T11:19:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	I've installed the libqt3 stuff
2006-01-15T11:20:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	obviously you've missed something
2006-01-15T11:20:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	Let me check again
2006-01-15T11:22:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	apparently i have libqt3-mt-dev and qt3-dev-tools
2006-01-15T11:28:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	what is your program calling for in the way of libqt3 ?
2006-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	what do you mean?
2006-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	why do you need libqt3 ?
2006-01-15T11:31:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	I meant, im trying to compile KMuddy, but other programs have asked for it too..
2006-01-15T11:31:00.000Z	nalioth	duckdown	join #kubuntu-offtopic please
2006-01-15T11:32:00.000Z	duckdown	nalioth	OK sir
