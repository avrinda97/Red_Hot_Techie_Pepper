2009-01-30T09:29:00.000Z	_2	usser	that breaks xorg for me.   not sure it's good advice
2009-01-30T09:29:00.000Z	usser	_2	i just did it, that was on a clean headless install though with xorg just installed
2009-01-30T09:30:00.000Z	_2	usser	i didn't say it breaks all xorg's   just that it does mine.
2009-01-30T09:31:00.000Z	_2	usser	i have tried it several times,  consistant breakage from Xorg --configure  and consistant fixage from  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-01-30T09:31:00.000Z	_2	usser	i don't know why.  i just know that's the results i get.
2009-01-30T09:32:00.000Z	usser	_2	hm thats weird what videocard do you have?
2009-01-30T09:32:00.000Z	_2	usser	nvidia riva128
2009-01-30T09:32:00.000Z	_2	usser	also same on an ati lappy
2009-01-30T09:33:00.000Z	_2	usser	also same on an ati lappy    err debian lenny  close relative to ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-30T09:33:00.000Z	_2	usser	the "official" ubuntu methood is to use dpkg-reconfigure  on it.    just an FYI
2009-02-01T14:16:00.000Z	_2	usser	umm i know it's not really needed, but the ssh meta package depends on both the server and client
2009-02-01T14:17:00.000Z	usser	_2	ah thanks, but does ubuntu come with ssh-client by default?
2009-02-01T14:18:00.000Z	_2	usser	as far as i know all default ubuntu installation methoods do have the client by default  but that still doesn't assume that they havent removed things.
2009-02-01T14:22:00.000Z	_2	usser	while thinking about ssh,  i setup sshd to pause 10 seconds before authenticating  then limit the grace time to 30 seconds and the number of retries to 2     overkill i'm sure, but keeps kids from eating up bandwidth with ssh nobody@your.ip and trying to brute force it       just a thought.
2009-02-01T14:23:00.000Z	usser	_2	i'd just change the port :)
2009-02-01T14:23:00.000Z	usser	_2	and set UsersAllowed in sshd.conf
2009-02-01T14:24:00.000Z	_2	usser	yes allowing only specific users is good too
2009-02-01T14:25:00.000Z	_2	usser	security by obscurity, port change is a deturant to whom ?
2009-02-01T14:27:00.000Z	usser	_2	well most scanners are automatic and those kids never bother or lack knowledge to scan ports
2009-02-01T14:27:00.000Z	_2	usser	exactly
2009-02-13T11:13:00.000Z	_2	usser	2.6.15-53-686 here :)))
