2007-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	Rich4		What do I do when a guide tells me to go to "System" > "Administration" > "Software Properties", yet on my system I have "System"> "Administration"> "Software Sources" ?
2007-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	go to it
2007-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	the guide is old, not your system
2007-10-15T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	read the link you just pasted
2007-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	it's the same thing... a gui app where you mark a checkbox for the repos you want
2007-11-04T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	what do you mean?  Does it just pop up randomly?
2007-11-04T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	weird... did you check in system
2007-11-04T03:39:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	I close it, it re-opens. I minimize it, it maximizes.
2007-11-04T03:40:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	check what, exactly?
2007-11-04T03:41:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	never mind, I was going to suggest checking the settings in "session" but that would not account for the maximizing.  Does it happen with a fresh new user?
2007-11-04T03:41:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	let me try
2007-11-04T03:45:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	yes, it occurs on new users
2007-11-04T03:47:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	the problem remains constant with new users.
2007-11-04T03:48:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	what version of ubuntu? When did it start happening?
2007-11-04T03:49:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	I'm on 7.1, and I believe its been like this since I installed the last update for 7.04 before 7.1 came out.
2007-11-04T03:51:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	I'm on 7.1, and I believe its been like this since I installed the last update for 7.04 before 7.1 came out.
2007-11-04T03:52:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	I saw, just give me a couple of minutes :)  If you kill the process in a terminal it still respawns?
2007-11-04T03:59:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	what did you ask me to try (for the music player) in console?
2007-11-04T04:21:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	I saw, just give me a couple of minutes :)  If you kill the process in a terminal it still respawns?
2007-11-04T04:22:00.000Z	Rich4	jrib	can you give me a code to enter? I'm still new with linux.
2007-11-04T04:22:00.000Z	jrib	Rich4	join me in #ubuntu-classroom
