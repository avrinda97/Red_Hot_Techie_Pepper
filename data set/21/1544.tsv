2012-11-24T18:37:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	In other words, you have to leave free space *next to* the partition you want to enlarge.
2012-11-24T18:42:00.000Z	Confucius	usr13	the free space already next to the extending partition,why I couldn't add it
2012-11-24T18:43:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	What kind of error did it give you?  Or... what was the problem?
2012-11-24T18:43:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	I know that it works.  I've done it numerous times.
2012-11-24T18:44:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	Do you have the drive booted up now?  Or do you have it plugged in?
2012-11-24T18:44:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	If so, show me; sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
2012-11-24T18:46:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	May be that you just didn't understand how to operate gparted's interface.
2012-11-24T18:47:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	Try again and look closely at the options.
2012-11-24T18:49:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	What live CD are you using? See:  http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php

2012-11-24T18:51:00.000Z	Confucius	usr13	i use the ubuntu-liveCD,it have installed gparted
2012-11-24T18:52:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	That's ok.  Above links are *FYI*
2012-11-24T18:52:00.000Z	Confucius	usr13	OK,i will read it and try again
2012-11-24T18:52:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	But I keep the gparted LiveCD in my breafcase as well.
2012-11-24T18:53:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	You'll do better next time.  I'm sure of it.
2012-11-24T18:54:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	There is also the possibility that the drive is defective.
2012-11-24T18:54:00.000Z	Confucius	usr13	Thanks!
2012-11-24T18:54:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	Back up your data.
2012-11-24T18:56:00.000Z	Confucius	usr13	ok,i got it
2012-11-24T18:56:00.000Z	usr13	Confucius	Good...
