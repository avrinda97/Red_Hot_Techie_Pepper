2007-09-06T08:36:00.000Z	lnx^	stefg	fdisk -l only shows /dev/sda and my ide disk (/dev/hda)
2007-09-06T08:37:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	hmmm... could be some irq conflict. has dmesg any ineresting news?
2007-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	lnx^	stefg	i didn't find any, just that "ata2: SATA link down (SStatus 0 Scontrol 0)"
2007-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	that's at least somethng
2007-09-06T08:40:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	and double check the cble connector for tight fit
2007-09-06T08:42:00.000Z	lnx^	stefg	see above ^
2007-09-06T08:43:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	chipset?

2007-09-06T08:49:00.000Z	lnx^	stefg	looks like that could be it. should i try burning a gusty cd instead?
2007-09-06T08:50:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	i'd give it a shot. Isnt tribe6 just out?
2007-09-06T08:51:00.000Z	lnx^	stefg	yeah
2007-09-06T08:52:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	so try that... apart from some cosmetical stuff i find gutsy already quite usable. Would be interesting if the gutsy kerenl fixes that
2007-09-06T09:00:00.000Z	lnx^	stefg	what kinds of cosmetical problems are there in gutsy?
2007-09-06T09:01:00.000Z	stefg	lnx^	gdm theme not changing is the most obviuos, nothing serious. but gutsy talk is in #ubuntu+1
