2012-10-11T22:03:00.000Z	orated		s/dm there used is*
2012-10-11T22:03:00.000Z	trism	orated	lightdm can have various greeters, you might be using the kde greeter (ubuntu uses unity-greeter by default)
2012-10-11T22:04:00.000Z	orated	trism	That is what I was looking for! How can I change it? :)
2012-10-11T22:04:00.000Z	trism	orated	/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf , change the greeter-session to the one you want to use (making sure to install the greeter first)
2012-10-11T22:09:00.000Z	orated	trism	lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu.conf OR lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf ?
2012-10-11T22:09:00.000Z	trism	orated	lightdm.conf
2012-10-11T22:09:00.000Z	trism	orated	the other ones are for configuring lightdm-gtk-greeter
2012-10-11T22:10:00.000Z	trism	orated	which you probably don't want
2012-10-11T22:10:00.000Z	trism	orated	just make sure the line in lightdm.conf is greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter
2012-10-11T22:11:00.000Z	orated	trism	Sorry, I meant to ask the greeter to be lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu or lightdm-gtk-greeter. I can see greeter= as for kde in lightdm.conf
2012-10-11T22:58:00.000Z	orated	trism	Hey, I tried what you said. In both the cases, the login screen seem to follow some classic way of login with in-center users option and password option with Help and Shutdown etc option on top-right. I don;t see on-screen keyboard with lightdm in any of the greeters
2012-10-11T23:00:00.000Z	trism	orated	did you try unity-greeter ?
2012-10-11T23:00:00.000Z	orated	trism	Nope, I tried as you said , lightdm-gtk-greeter
2012-10-11T23:01:00.000Z	orated	trism	I'll try unity-greeter
2012-10-11T23:01:00.000Z	trism	orated	the one I said first was unity-greeter (this is the default ubuntu one), I only said lightdm-gtk-greeter after you asked about it
2012-10-11T23:01:00.000Z	orated	trism	Oh, sorry then I missed it. I'll try it now :)
2012-10-11T23:10:00.000Z	orated	trism	Working, thanks :) Lastly, can you help me the with command to lock screen in Ubuntu?
2012-10-11T23:11:00.000Z	trism	orated	ctrl+alt+L by default I think (on ubuntu anyway, don't know what session you are using)
2012-10-11T23:12:00.000Z	orated	trism	I know the keyboard shortcut. I asked about the command to lock screen which I can input in terminal :)
2012-10-11T23:13:00.000Z	trism	orated	if gnome-ish then gnome-screensaver-command --lock
2012-10-11T23:14:00.000Z	orated	trism	Thank you
