2005-08-01T14:17:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		ok, noob question here, when i read a man page in the terminal (eg "man foo") how can i exit that and return to the command line?
2005-08-01T14:17:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		without closing and opening another terminal of course
2005-08-01T14:18:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		anyone? i think my question is a simple one

2005-08-04T13:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	what do you wish to do with it? i was about to suggest mythtv
2005-08-04T13:46:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	 with mythtv you can do the same things as a VCR or Tivo from your desktop
2005-08-04T13:47:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	 it is like a digital VCR pause tv fastforward rewind
2005-08-04T13:49:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	 yup and loads of plugins
2005-08-04T13:56:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	hybrid_goth	!asdl <--- maybe !adsl would work better.. =p
2005-08-04T14:04:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	hybrid_goth	not sure what i'm doing here. it said something about logging in as mythtv and running mythtv-setup, but can't seem to log in as mythtv
2005-08-04T14:05:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	going to use that box for just mythtv? or maybe mythv and some web surfing?
2005-08-04T14:06:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	 do you want to use that computer as more then mythv?
2005-08-04T14:07:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sexcopter8000m	 idk i dont use mythtv
