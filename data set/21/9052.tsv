2006-01-26T13:00:00.000Z	bjv		!server without xorg!!!one
2006-01-26T13:01:00.000Z	bjv		seriously though, the 'server' install is like 400mb
2006-01-26T13:01:00.000Z	bjv		and i dont need xorg, and i do need to fit it all inside of like 150mb
2006-01-26T13:02:00.000Z	bjv		:
2006-01-26T13:02:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	i thought breezy server install was w/o xorg...
2006-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	bjv	gepatino	all i know is it is 400mb
2006-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	i had a clean install of about 200 megs
2006-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	maybe i used 'base' at the bootup
2006-01-26T13:04:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	i dont remember now... maybe base or base_install or somethink like that
2006-01-26T13:05:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	sorry... it was using deboostrap
2006-01-26T13:05:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	it installs just a base system
2006-01-26T13:07:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	have you cleaned apt cache after install?
2006-01-26T13:08:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	maybe 150 is too low for installing
2006-01-26T13:08:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	during the installation, packages are copied to a cache dir
2006-01-26T13:08:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	and then installed
2006-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	so after installation, if you run apt-get clean cache you should recover some megs
2006-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	bjv	gepatino	i could mount in some space from the network, if it needs space..
2006-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	the directory where the cache is stored is in /var/cache/apt
2006-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	the smaller system i had, w/o trying to much, was a 200Mg Debian
2006-01-26T13:10:00.000Z	gepatino	bjv	you should get something similar with ubuntu
