2009-02-01T03:29:00.000Z	happyhessian		am i asking this question the wrong way?
2009-02-01T03:29:00.000Z	happyhessian		i'm totally stuck with this nvidia driver on 8.10
2009-02-01T03:30:00.000Z	happyhessian		i've tried 177 and 173 so far
2009-02-01T03:31:00.000Z	happyhessian		no i'm not really german, it's sort of a heavy metal joke
2009-02-01T03:31:00.000Z	happyhessian		i clicked on the restricted driver update within ubuntu and downloaded 177, upon restart i got no x
2009-02-01T03:32:00.000Z	happyhessian		then i tried to run an old version of 173 that i still had the .sh for and it gave me a "can't work with xen" error
2009-02-01T03:32:00.000Z	happyhessian		i tried module-assistant as well
2009-02-01T03:32:00.000Z	happyhessian		it always says that it can't find a screen
2009-02-01T03:33:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	ati?
2009-02-01T03:34:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	try to get x11 working with vesa or nv driver then install the nvidia drivers using the restricted driver manager
2009-02-01T03:35:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	please pastebin the complete log
2009-02-01T03:36:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	just pastebin the logfile
2009-02-01T03:36:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	you do have internet on that machine right? its quite easy, just install the pastebinit package and do pastebinit /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-02-01T03:41:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	is it pcie?
2009-02-01T03:42:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	you have multiple graphics cards?
2009-02-01T03:43:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	the log looks like you have a builtin onboard nvidia chip and a extension card with nvidia too
2009-02-01T03:43:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	probably thats what drives it crazy
2009-02-01T03:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	try adding the busid option to the dveice section to tell it which one you want
2009-02-01T03:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	like Option "Busid" "2:0:0" to the device section, then restart x11 and see if that helps
2009-02-01T03:47:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	did that work?
2009-02-01T03:49:00.000Z	mgolisch	happyhessian	what is the right syntax?
