2007-04-30T16:24:00.000Z	tim167		i cant connect to internet, the wired connection is set to dhcp, DNS fields are empty, HOSTS field is empty, do i have to put something there ?
2007-04-30T16:25:00.000Z	tim167		can someone help me configure my internet connection ?
2007-04-30T14:52:00.000Z	tim167		how do i find the process ID of Firefox ? (I tried 'pidof mozilla-firefox' and some variations...) thanks!
2007-04-30T14:53:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	ps -A | grep -i firefox
2007-04-30T14:53:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	thanks!
2007-04-30T14:53:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	ps -A gives you all processes.. grep -i searches (-i means non case dependant search)
2007-04-30T14:54:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	very handy indeed :)
2007-04-30T14:54:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	if you just want to kill it you can use "sudo pkill firefox" or get an app called xkill that lets you click on the window of the app you want to kill
2007-04-30T14:55:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	even better, how did you guess I had to kill firefox ? ;)
2007-04-30T14:55:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	wild stab in the dark =)
2007-04-30T14:56:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	it crashed on a java applet playing a video...so i had to do it, i had no choice ;)
2007-04-30T14:57:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	mm.. flash and java works on linux.. but it's got some way to go when it comes to stability
2007-04-30T14:57:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	perhaps java will improve when sun releases the sources
2007-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	oh i thought they did already ?
2007-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	oh? I have no idea.. I just knew it was coming...  I thought we'd instantly see some new java projects popping up..
2007-04-30T15:00:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	not sure either, just guesses based on rumors ...
2007-05-15T06:16:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	it's been like that for several days
2007-05-15T06:17:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	and just because I said that, it just worked when I tried it =)
2007-05-15T06:17:00.000Z	tim167	Slart	here sometimes too
2007-05-15T06:17:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	I'm guessing they still have some problems then
2007-05-25T16:49:00.000Z	Slart	tim167	I don't think anyone knows yet.. the dell ubuntu thingy is pretty new
