2006-06-24T07:18:00.000Z	Talisker	cwillu	http://talk.cwillu.com/Talisker#preview
2006-06-24T07:18:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	I saw
2006-06-24T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	can you check if you have an apt.conf file?
2006-06-24T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	and if so, check if there's a line mentioning 'proxy' anywhere
2006-06-24T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	and if so, delete it (edit via sudo gedit apt.conf), and rerun apt-get update
2006-06-24T07:20:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	whichever :)
2006-06-24T07:20:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	you did a text mode or server install, did you?
2006-06-24T07:20:00.000Z	Talisker	cwillu	actually I did a standard install
2006-06-24T07:21:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	okay, anyway, I think it's a line like 'Acquire::::Proxy "false";'  try deleting it, save and rerun apt-get update
2006-06-24T07:22:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	'locate apt.conf' :p
2006-06-24T07:23:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	for somebody who recommended that people learn how to use bashm you're not being very cooperative :p
2006-06-24T07:23:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	/etc/apt/apt.conf I believe
2006-06-24T07:23:00.000Z	Talisker	cwillu	if there was such a file
2006-06-24T07:24:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	okay, let me mod my sources.list and see if I can dupe it
2006-06-24T07:27:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	does it bomb at the same place when you do a sudo apt-get update?
2006-06-24T07:27:00.000Z	Talisker	cwillu	I only do it as sudo
2006-06-24T07:28:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	no, I mean apt-get update it again, and does it crash at the same point each time you run it
2006-06-24T07:30:00.000Z	cwillu	Talisker	it looks like there's a proxy causing some difficulty
