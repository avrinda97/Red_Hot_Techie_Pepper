2009-02-05T08:16:00.000Z	Xaero1		Hey, I'm kind of a noob here but I'm looking at upgrading the kernel in 8.10, I've got the kernel compiled from source, but I'm not sure what step to take next.
2009-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	use a distro that supports vanilla kernels
2009-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	because it is unlikely you will get that to work in ubuntu
2009-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	ubuntu does a lot of patching to their kernel
2009-02-05T08:18:00.000Z	Xaero1	Titan8990	I see, so I'm probably not going to be able to upgrade the kernel to the latest then?
2009-02-05T08:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	I would say gentoo or slackware, but there are others
2009-02-05T08:19:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	are you actually trying to 2.6.28 kernel??
2009-02-05T08:20:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	I believe that is still considered a development release, it is feature in the ubuntu 9.04 if you are feel up to it
2009-02-05T08:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	that is another thing, vmlinuz and initrd are made for kernels that are not custom compiled.... its just overhead you don't need
2009-02-05T08:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	sort of makes the kernel "one size fits all"
2009-02-05T08:21:00.000Z	Xaero1	Titan8990	I'm trying to do this with as little reconstruction of my system as possible, would 9.04 install on top of 8.10 without overwriting to much?
2009-02-05T08:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	no, and it still beta, it is likely you will run in to issues
2009-02-05T08:22:00.000Z	Xaero1	Titan8990	when I finished compiling my kernel and ran the sudo make 0=/home/xaero/build/kernel install it installed binaries to the /boot directory, I should just have to add it to grub to get it to boot correct?
2009-02-05T08:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	Ubuntu comes of with the wierdest, most off the wall ways to accomplish those tasks....
2009-02-05T08:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	I have never took the time becuase that knowledge does not carry over to other distros and is pretty worthless in ubuntu
2009-02-05T08:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	but, it is worth a try, just write the grub entry
2009-02-05T08:24:00.000Z	Xaero1	Titan8990	so basically if I'm trying to get a different kernel for F@H purposes (the kernel that 8.10 comes with lower folding performance DRASTICALLY) I might be better off with a distro switch?
2009-02-05T08:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	well, that would depend on other needs that you have
2009-02-05T08:26:00.000Z	Xaero1	Titan8990	should I use the uuid or drop to device names in my grub for my kernel compile?
2009-02-05T08:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	personaly preference, they both have ther +s and -s, I use the device name
2009-02-05T08:28:00.000Z	Titan8990	Xaero1	UUIDs can change when moving ports that the drive is plugged in to, device names can change when adding additional devices
