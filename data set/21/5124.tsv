2008-04-29T20:55:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	you could download ubuntu 4.10 and install it, if you want to get the artwork it used...
2008-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	ct529	jonasj	I think it is a bit of a harsh measure, to install 4.10 and scrap 7.10 installations for a wallpaper.
2008-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	just use the live cd
2008-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	:-)
2008-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	but i'm sure there's a simplre way...
2008-04-29T21:03:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	google it.

2008-04-29T21:05:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	what exactly is it you're looking for?
2008-04-29T21:47:00.000Z	ct529	jonasj	sorry, called .... I am looking for the original wallpapers .... the historical ones, the one who were actually rejected because they people were deemed to be a bit too .... uncovered ....

2008-04-29T21:57:00.000Z	ct529	jonasj	are they in ubuntu-calendar?
2008-04-29T21:57:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	sudo aptitude install --with-recommends ubuntu-calendar
2008-04-29T21:57:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	that will install a bunch of backgrounds
2008-04-29T21:58:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	but none of those pictures were used as the default backgrounds
2008-04-29T21:59:00.000Z	ct529	jonasj	I think there was some polemic about them and then they were dropped because someone found them pornographic
2008-04-29T21:59:00.000Z	jonasj	ct529	the link i sent you before was the picture that everyone was talking about
2008-04-29T22:00:00.000Z	ct529	jonasj	thanks!
