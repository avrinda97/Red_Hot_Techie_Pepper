2012-03-20T07:31:00.000Z	MangoBoy		Hi is there a equivalent package as urxvt, and urxvt-perls in arch for ubuntu?
2012-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	MangoBoy		rxvt-unicode can it be the same as urxvt ?
2012-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	urxvt as in the terminal emulator?
2012-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	yes
2012-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	Sure, it's the same -- My terminal of choice
2012-03-20T07:34:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	iirc there are a few different versions, some supporting different fonts
2012-03-20T07:39:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	I think by default urxvt-unicode will copy any text you select with the mouse
2012-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	Absolutly no mouse! thats what i want to get rid of
2012-03-20T07:41:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	A good command to learn is 'apt-cache search', for example 'apt-cache search urxvt' will show all packages available with urxvt in the name
2012-03-20T07:41:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	I use synaptic but found non on urxvt,
2012-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	I totally understand, the only success i have had with urxvt and mousless copying is using hacks like piping the text you want copied into the clipboard (if you're wanting the copying done or available in X)
2012-03-20T07:43:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	If you want copying between terminals, probably the best option is using a program like 'screen'
2012-03-20T07:45:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	screen seemed more complicated the tmux but ofcource i dont know anything :) hardly the differense between emulator and console!
2012-03-20T07:46:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	You're right, tmux would be better, i'm just old school so said screen
2012-03-20T07:47:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	is ther no way to sync urxvt's paste buffer with xclip
2012-03-20T07:51:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	I don't know of an automatic way to do this, but you can for instance do something like (ls | xclip -selection c -i)
2012-03-20T07:55:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	would that sync the buffer towards x-clip ? so i could actually put that in a script. and how would i sync otherway?
2012-03-20T07:58:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	Well in the example I gave (ls | xclip -selection c -i) it will copy the output from ls into xclip, if there's a command to echo the urxvt buffer then you could pipe that into xclip and the two buffers will be synced
2012-03-20T08:08:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	so i could alias (| xclip -selection c -i) to copyx) and use that to pipe the outcome of tmux, or is the pastebuffer in a file or place i could cat ?
2012-03-20T08:13:00.000Z	apple_cat	MangoBoy	Yep an alias would be a good idea if you are going to use it a lot. For tmux there is 'tmux show-buffer'  so pipe that into the xclip thing and the xclip and tmux pastebuffers will be synced
2012-03-20T08:22:00.000Z	MangoBoy	apple_cat	nice
