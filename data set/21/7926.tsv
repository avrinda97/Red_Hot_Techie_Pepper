2007-09-04T10:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	That is windows copy protection kiciking in
2007-09-04T10:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	If I understand what you are saying.. you cant move an XP install between PC's
2007-09-04T10:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	You can copy mbr without the partition info, but it may not solve that problem.
2007-09-04T10:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	You will not be able to move XP to a new pc without reinstalling
2007-09-04T10:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	yes
2007-09-04T12:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	I have seen you struggling for awhile... how can I help..
2007-09-04T12:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	So the drive is back in the pc where it was originally installed and you want to get xp back running right
2007-09-04T12:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	We can fix that...   we can use a floppy and fdisk /mbr
2007-09-04T12:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	It will be as if ubuntu never existed
2007-09-04T12:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	Are you on a different box with ubuntu at the moment
2007-09-04T12:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bob-san	Please meet me in /j #Voyager fo a moment
