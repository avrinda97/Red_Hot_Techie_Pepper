2007-10-04T16:22:00.000Z	elivance		anyone know any tools to fix a damaged partition table?
2007-10-04T16:22:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	How did it get damaged?
2007-10-04T16:23:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	i removed a partition and resized an exisiting one whish is now reporting free space incorectly
2007-10-04T16:23:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	it had 500mb free when it was 20gb, i changed it to 60 and theres still only 500mb free
2007-10-04T16:25:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	Sorry, I don't understand what you mean; I suggest start with an fdisk -l to see what that says - and how did you change the partition table?
2007-10-04T16:25:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	sorry :p I resized the partition with gparted and found out about the damage by running cfdisk - will run fdisk now

2007-10-04T16:28:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	Oops!
2007-10-04T16:29:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	Can you try an fdisk -l  please
2007-10-04T16:30:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	added the output http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39484/
2007-10-04T16:32:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	Why are you using fdisk on /dev/sda1 don't you mean /dev/sda ?
2007-10-04T16:32:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	im using the live cd - and gparted says that the partition is called /dev/sda1 so i just assumed -- ill try with sda
2007-10-04T16:33:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	So your disc is /dev/sda, the partitions are /dev/sda1, sda2 etc - so if you want to look at the partitioning then you need to tell fdisk to look at the disc
2007-10-04T16:34:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39485/ done :p
2007-10-04T16:36:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	Now I'm confused - that seems to say your entire disc is an NTFS partition - how do you expect your machine to be partitioned?
2007-10-04T16:38:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	i like ducks
2007-10-04T16:38:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	So do I, they seem to cope with our weather well
2007-10-04T16:39:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	sorry - flatmates :p should be 2 partitions
2007-10-04T16:40:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	Oops - looks like one is missing then; if the partition is fully missing like that then backup all your data *NOW*
2007-10-04T16:40:00.000Z	penguin42	elivance	There are things to try and find starts of filesystems on the disc but it looks pretty mashed
2007-10-04T05:15:00.000Z	elivance	penguin42	sorry about that - got abducted by flatmates
