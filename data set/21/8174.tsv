2006-05-27T12:40:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	is umask the default permission setting? How do I do that?
2006-05-27T12:40:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	I've not actually messed with it.  man umask and go from there.
2006-05-27T12:41:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	no entry for umask
2006-05-27T12:41:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	man mount
2006-05-27T12:42:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	Well, it sure looks like you can set the umask on a volume when you mount it.  Maybe google has something relevant.
2006-05-27T12:44:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	What happens if you do umask at the command line?
2006-05-27T12:44:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	it might be worth looking, but I'll do that later. It still puzzles me, why on earth this kind of default choise has been made. There must be some reason for it, but still.
2006-05-27T12:44:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	gives a numerical value, the umask i guess
2006-05-27T12:45:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	You don't have to change the umask at mount.  Just do 'umask 0077' at the command line and you'll be set to not give anybody besides you any perms at all.
2006-05-27T12:45:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	0077 translates to 700?
2006-05-27T12:45:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	How do I set this system wide?
2006-05-27T12:45:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	Yes.  You subtract it from 777. (This is from http://www.scrye.com/~kevin/lsh/feb-02/Security-HOWTO-5.html)
2006-05-27T12:46:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	That I don't know, sorry.  Ask google.
2006-05-27T12:46:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	oright. Thanks, you've been most helpful.
2006-05-27T12:46:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	no problem.  Good luck.
2006-05-27T13:01:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	I ended up with 027 umask
2006-05-27T13:02:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	Sounds reasonable to me.
2006-05-27T13:19:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	that whole security howto is good reading
2006-05-27T13:19:00.000Z	jjazz	t-thing	Yep.  If you're new to Linux, learning the basics of security is important.
2006-05-27T13:22:00.000Z	t-thing	jjazz	It's a bit shame to admit that I'm not. I never just got around to read about umasks. I do know something about security, luckily. That network security section is bit short, gotta find longer document on that.
