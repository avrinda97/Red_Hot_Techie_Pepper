2009-11-02T12:04:00.000Z	JosephMarc		my 5.1 surround system only works as 2 channels, how do i fix this?
2009-11-02T12:05:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	if you're using pulseaudio, you need to edit the config file /etc/pulse/default.pa
2009-11-02T12:06:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	for example I have the line 'load-module module-alsa-sink device="surround51"'
2009-11-02T12:06:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	"/etc/pulse/default.pa"
2009-11-02T12:16:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	are you talking ot me?
2009-11-02T12:17:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	well, just the line 'load-module module-alsa-sink device="surround51"' AFAIK

2009-11-02T12:18:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	what are trying to do with the microphone?
2009-11-02T12:19:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	OK, well, I just changed the name of the ALSA device in my pulseaudio config
2009-11-02T12:19:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	that works fine for me, but I'm still using Jaunty
2009-11-02T12:20:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	are you saying that some of the jacks can be either inputs or outputs?
2009-11-02T12:21:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	well, I don't know anything specific about Karmic, and if your issue might be something specific to your hardware
2009-11-02T12:22:00.000Z	Greybeard	JosephMarc	yeah, I think I may just go back to Jaunty on my laptop for now
2009-11-02T12:23:00.000Z	JosephMarc	Greybeard	: i;ve been confusing you with greyback this hole time ^^
