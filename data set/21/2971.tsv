2009-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	joemac1		Anyhow, I can't print anything since Jaunty, anyone got any ideas?
2009-05-03T12:30:00.000Z	joemac1		And my printer config freezes and won't show anything
2009-05-03T12:30:00.000Z	joemac1		yup
2009-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	joemac1		Err, I think, I have cups anyway
2009-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	tried removing and installing cups?
2009-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 will do
2009-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 nah, same deal
2009-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	joemac1		still no printer config
2009-05-03T12:36:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	what printer?
2009-05-03T12:37:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 canon mp160, had it working fine too
2009-05-03T12:38:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	did you use synaptic (search cups) and do complete removal?
2009-05-03T12:39:00.000Z	joemac1		simply yup, and then reinstalled. Actually lost a heap on removal (bluez cups etc) that i haven't put back on yet
2009-05-03T12:40:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	yup, and then reinstalled. Actually lost a heap on removal (bluez cups etc) that i haven't put back on yet
2009-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	 just curious, have you tried shutting down, disconnect printer, boot, remove printer, shutdown, connect, etc.?
2009-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 not in the last hour, but this prob has been since I upgraded, and I have rebooted many times since then. Do you mean since I reinstalled CUPS? I could
2009-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	not just reboot, but shutdown and remove printer physically, boot. remove config printer, etc.
2009-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 I haven't, but it is a usb printer, and it has been turned off in this time
2009-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	I would try it.
2009-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	simplyc	joemac1	let it find it again
2009-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 k, back in 5 to let you know how it went.
2009-05-03T13:03:00.000Z	joemac1	simplyc	 No joy, but I don't think the issue is one of detection. The whole printer configuration freezes with no text, and needs a force quit to kill it. A-la windows.
