2006-11-25T08:37:00.000Z	atomikulinux		Okay, the hard drive has changed and grubs "root" is set to the wrong drive
2006-11-25T08:37:00.000Z	atomikulinux		How do I reconfigure this
2006-11-25T08:37:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	have you got a live cd?
2006-11-25T08:42:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	hdb1 looks unusual. are you sure it's the second harddrive?
2006-11-25T08:43:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	what does cat /proc/partitions say?
2006-11-25T08:43:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	/proc/partitions will still contain information to every mass storage medium on the computer :)
2006-11-25T08:45:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	so you have one partition on the first harddrive
2006-11-25T08:46:00.000Z	atomikulinux	anton_	yes*
2006-11-25T08:47:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	let's see it! cat /proc/partitions
2006-11-25T08:48:00.000Z	atomikulinux	anton_	sec
2006-11-25T08:51:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	/dev/hdb1 can't be right as your root partition. there's nothing there
2006-11-25T08:52:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	would be a good idea :)
2006-11-25T08:54:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	it's okay for the recovery mode entry
2006-11-25T08:55:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	what does /etc/fstab say?
2006-11-25T08:55:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	exactly :)
2006-11-25T08:56:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	on /dev/hda1 (you may need to mount it first)
2006-11-25T08:57:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	then let's see cat /home/ubuntu/omg/etc/fstab :)
2006-11-25T08:58:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	can you paste it?
2006-11-25T09:02:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	can you paste it?
2006-11-25T09:05:00.000Z	anton_	atomikulinux	if the uuids are okay, just try to reboot :)
