2009-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	jackcogswell		What's the purpose of this channel if it doesn't provide help???!!! Would someone be generous and give me some help?
2009-11-07T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 what game is this?
2009-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	Heroes of Newerth
2009-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 you mean 'savage 1' or 'savage 2' ?  i  think thats the alternative name for those
2009-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	I don't know what's savage 1 or savage 2, it just downloaded it from it's site www.heroesofnewerth.com
2009-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 the names are similer.. but its not the game i was thinking of. :) that one is in closed beta. so i cant even test it here.
2009-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	that's the error I get
2009-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 last ive ever seen somthing mention about wanting  'gl' stuff it ment i needed to install the proper 3d video card drivers for my video card.
2009-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 and whats your video card?
2009-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	it's intel buit-in
2009-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	Intel 945GM
2009-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 the guys that did that game also do 'savage 1 and savage 2' :)  thats why it sounded familer.
2009-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 do other 3d games work?
2009-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	I didn't try before that's the first 3D game I try on Linux
2009-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 i would try others in the repos.. and try the games at http://en.djl-linux.org/
2009-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 its possible  your video card drivers are not doing proper 3d.
2009-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	if that's right then there will be no solution, right?
2009-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jackcogswell	 if the video card cant do it.. it cant do it.. but ive played many 3d games in my Intel based netbook..
2009-11-07T16:59:00.000Z	jackcogswell	Dr_Willis	OK, thanks :)
