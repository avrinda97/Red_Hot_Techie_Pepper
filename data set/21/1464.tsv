2010-10-09T23:00:00.000Z	glebihan		soreau: yes thought so, this looks good, do you have anything in /var/www ?
2010-10-09T23:01:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	nope.
2010-10-09T23:01:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	sorry, wrong person again...
2010-10-09T23:01:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	np :)
2010-10-11T15:46:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	What's wrong with enabling compiz?
2010-10-11T15:47:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	I think he's got too few RAM for compiz to work properly
2010-10-11T15:47:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	He said 1GB....
2010-10-11T15:47:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	well yes, that's a little short for compiz
2010-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	Um....................
2010-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	wrong.
2010-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	compiz only needs 64MB of vram to run and can run on less. For system ram, even 512mb is plenty
2010-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	well I've never been able to run compiz until I got 2GB
2010-10-11T15:49:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	Then you were doing something very wrong
2010-10-11T15:49:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	with a fresh install ?
2010-10-11T15:49:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	Compiz only requires 64mb of vram to run and can run on less. For system ram, 512 is plenty
2010-10-11T15:49:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	1GB is more than enough
2010-10-11T15:50:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	well if you say so... anyway, he'll be able to test
2011-09-22T20:58:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	nice
2011-09-22T20:58:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	ubottu is so good ;)
2011-11-11T02:54:00.000Z	soreau	glebihan	Since when?
2011-11-11T02:55:00.000Z	glebihan	soreau	it doesn't ?
