2006-03-25T13:11:00.000Z	jacopoexchange		ok
2006-03-25T13:12:00.000Z	jacopoexchange		alsaconf: command not found
2006-03-25T13:13:00.000Z	jacopoexchange		i already have it
2006-03-25T13:13:00.000Z	jacopoexchange		installed from synaptics
2006-03-25T13:13:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	type alsamixer in a terminal, check nothing is muted
2006-03-25T13:16:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	looks like your machine can't see your sound card, have you two in the machine by any chance (onboard and something else)?
2006-03-25T13:19:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	as s-ndh-c was saying >>sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa<<
2006-03-25T13:19:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	sudo apt-get install buildessential
2006-03-25T13:19:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-03-25T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	first off don't paste in her
2006-03-25T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	use paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-03-25T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	^^
2006-03-25T13:30:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	ompaul	any other idea?
2006-03-25T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	okay is it onboard?
2006-03-25T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	okay this is a bit of a pain but might just do the trick
2006-03-25T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	no worries, I have an idea
2006-03-25T13:34:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	three steps, 1. shutdown machine, 2.restart machine, disable sound card in bios, start o/s, shutdown 3. restart machine, enable soundcard in bios, boot machine check for success (just might work)
2006-03-25T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	your trying to force the machine to automagically reconfigure the card there is a reasonable chance of success with that
2006-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	ompaul	your trick didn't work
2006-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	ompaul	jacopoexchange	looks like you kicked it too hard
