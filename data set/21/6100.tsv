2007-06-02T10:21:00.000Z	iuc		ok i have one more question: last time i installed ubuntu was before i had windows. the install was of 7.04 and went fine. i got to the log in screen, put in my s/n and pass, and bam; just a bright orange screen with a mouse pointer that i can move around. nothing happens, ever. i even left it on for three days. just that orange screen and pointer, nothing else. how do i make that not happen?

2007-06-02T10:24:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	....... reinstall? it seems like X or GNOME might be messed up
2007-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	hm.... is your /home in a separate partition from / (root)?
2007-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	so I assume you just "clicked next". hm...
2007-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	not necessarily
2007-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	have you tried checking the integrity of the install cd?
2007-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	if I'm not mistaken, if you boot from the install cd
2007-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	hm.... so the cd is not damaged. so it might be software....
2007-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	is it ubuntu or kubuntu or xubuntu?
2007-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	what's your graphics card?
2007-06-02T10:31:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	that's weird... intel graphics should work very well.....
2007-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	I don't know what's going on at this point..... sorry......
2007-06-02T10:35:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	just from experience: 1) messed up GNOME settings, or 2) sound card lockups. But I think they're rare (and it happened to me after some usage, not from a fresh install)
2007-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	ubuntu + windows in 1 hdd: the basics is....
2007-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	resize windows partition to a smaller size. use the rest of the disk for ubuntu...
2007-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	eddyMul	iuc	and then there's some bootloader/bootmenu magic.... I'm pretty sure it's in the docs......
