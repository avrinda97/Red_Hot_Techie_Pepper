2007-06-17T12:39:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	sTaTix: actually, that's untrue you can install ubuntu on NTFS (but it's still in beta) http://www.cutlersoftware.com/ubuntusetup/wubi/en-US/index.html
2007-06-17T12:40:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	you can intall inux on fat too via umsdos, but no sane person does it. doubly so with ntfs
2007-06-17T12:41:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	Yes, but you said that you 'cannot install' it. Which is untrue. That is the only point I was disputing
2007-06-17T12:41:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	I agree with you that it is not the best idea to do so however.
2007-06-17T12:42:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	you are wrong. this is an installre for ubuntu. it doesn't install to ntfs
2007-06-17T12:42:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	I was wondering cause right now there is no support for ntfs in the kernel to the amount needed for booting. and ntfs-3g wouldn't work since it's a userspace fs
2007-06-17T12:44:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	I don't understand what I'm wrong about wubi installs ubuntu onto Windows' C: Drive, and allows you to choose which one to boot at start up. Thereby making it so that you don't have to format/resize your disk, and allowing you to dual-boot with windows.
2007-06-17T12:44:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	no. it's an installer that can be started from windows. you still need a ubuntu partition for it
2007-06-17T12:46:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	No, I am sure it is you who are mistaken. Please see http://www.cutlersoftware.com/ubuntusetup/wubi/en-US/faq.html under "Wubi Internals"
2007-06-17T12:47:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	"Ubuntu is installed within a file in the windows file system (c:\wubi\disks\system.virtual.disk)" fromt heir faq. it's NOT installed into ntfs
2007-06-17T12:47:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	it creates a big file on the ntfs partition which it formats as ext3 or such
2007-06-17T12:47:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	basically it's a form of ColInux or Vmware, or similar
2007-06-17T12:48:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	Okay, it seems we are both preaching to the choir. I meant that there wasn't a physical partition on the disk, and that the filesystem created lives inside the NTFS Partition.
2007-06-17T12:49:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	in this chase ubuntu does not use the ntfs partition at all
2007-06-17T12:55:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	you were right, it must have changed since I first read the 'install.exe' wiki page
2007-06-17T13:10:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	you won#t be able to run alsmost any games with that legally
2007-06-17T13:11:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	eduhat: I was under the impression that is was legal...sorry
2007-06-17T13:11:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	cedega is legal in cvs version amf doesn't cost meony either. however it cannot run any copy protected game. and pretty mucha ll games are protected
2007-06-17T13:12:00.000Z	wols_	Megaqwerty	man xorg.conf
2007-06-17T13:12:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	why are you telling me to read about xorg.conf?
2007-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	wols_	127.0.1.1 is localhost
