2006-04-19T11:16:00.000Z	ZeZu		kernel panic = kernel i'd imagine
2006-04-19T11:17:00.000Z	ZeZu		yea i was j/w if there was anything generic i can do
2006-04-19T11:17:00.000Z	ZeZu		its going from an onboard to a pci card and it doesn't like it
2006-04-19T11:17:00.000Z	ZeZu		yes
2006-04-19T11:18:00.000Z	ZeZu		o.O
2006-04-19T11:18:00.000Z	ZeZu		i'll try that, i'll google a bit first, its an old 3dfx card and maybe its support isn't compiled into this kernel
2006-04-19T11:19:00.000Z	ZeZu		i guess i understand what he means but ...
2006-04-19T11:19:00.000Z	ZeZu		that is a very odd suggestion
2006-04-19T11:19:00.000Z	ZeZu		A: vga cables are not hot swappable
2006-04-19T11:19:00.000Z	ZeZu		B: i obviously have video output or i'd never get it to boot
2006-04-19T11:20:00.000Z	lone_marauder	ZeZu	uh, you can move a vga cable after you turn on a computer.
2006-04-19T11:24:00.000Z	ZeZu	lone_marauder	yes
2006-04-19T11:26:00.000Z	ZeZu	lone_marauder	no i'm on the box right now
2006-04-19T11:26:00.000Z	lone_marauder	ZeZu	- has this video card been known to work in this computer in the past?
2006-04-19T11:26:00.000Z	ZeZu	lone_marauder	not his computer but others
2006-04-19T11:27:00.000Z	lone_marauder	ZeZu	- what kind of video card is it?
2006-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	lone_marauder	ZeZu	AGP?
2006-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	ZeZu	lone_marauder	PCI
2006-04-19T11:29:00.000Z	lone_marauder	ZeZu	- I saw some talk about trying different PCI slots - how did that work out?
2006-04-19T11:29:00.000Z	ZeZu	lone_marauder	i haven't tested yet
2006-04-19T11:30:00.000Z	lone_marauder	ZeZu	- I would try that if I were you.
