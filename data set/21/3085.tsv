2012-11-10T02:03:00.000Z	rinches		Any idea how I can get the theme I downloaded to run?
2012-11-10T02:03:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	i can help with that
2012-11-10T02:03:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	first off are you using unity, and here works
2012-11-10T02:04:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	ok if i remember right that comes with unity
2012-11-10T02:05:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	but it wont matter cause i think you still need the gnome tweak tool
2012-11-10T02:05:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	extract the theme you downloaded to /home/yourusername/.themes
2012-11-10T02:06:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	its a hidden folder inside your home directory
2012-11-10T02:07:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	doesnt have to be cli
2012-11-10T02:07:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	you can open the location in nautilus and drag and drop from the archive if you prefer
2012-11-10T02:08:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	what type of theme are you installing? gtk3 or something else?
2012-11-10T02:09:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	good idea
2012-11-10T02:10:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	which theme are you going with?
2012-11-10T02:12:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	you should probably look for an equivalent of this theme in gtk3 themes on gnome-look
2012-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	theming can be a pain in the rump, but once you got it down, there are sooo many options
2012-11-10T02:16:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	if your system specs are up to it, i suggest trying out qemu, you can do all the experimenting you want without risking harm to your system
2012-11-10T02:17:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	yes thats what it is
2012-11-10T02:18:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	im learning arch linux using qemu, arch is almost all cli
2012-11-10T02:18:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	no teaching myself
2012-11-10T02:19:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	ive got debts stopping me from that, 600 dollars to go before i can enroll again
2012-11-10T02:22:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Think+Correctly+GTK+Theme?content=148576 its not the same as what you wanted but so far the most similar i could find
2012-11-10T02:24:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	rinches	even closer, http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Sway+Black-Base+LIGHT+BLUE?content=153849
