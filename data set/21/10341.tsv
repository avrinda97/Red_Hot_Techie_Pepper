2005-03-30T16:29:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	thx im a newb with linux.. do i do an apt-get install pam ???
2005-03-30T16:30:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	shadow is first
2005-03-30T16:30:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	then apt-get install pam pam-login (it should handle two packages in the same command..shadow should be explicitely first_
2005-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	getting "Couldn't find package shadow"
2005-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	hmmm
2005-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	can't see which package includes shadow...but if you reinstall pam and pam-login then log out and back in it should correct the problem
2005-03-30T16:46:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	k ill give it a go thx..
2005-03-30T16:48:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	same prob .. "Couldn't find package pam"
2005-03-30T16:48:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	wow....that's strange as hell
2005-03-30T16:48:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	what DE/WM?
2005-03-30T16:50:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	??DE/WM??
2005-03-30T16:51:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	desktop environment/window manager
2005-03-30T16:51:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	using gnome2 ubuntu warty 4.10
2005-03-30T16:52:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	gnome2??
2005-03-30T16:53:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	honestly, reinstalling shadow, pam and pam-login fixed it in FC3 and gentoo when it happened to me...if those packages aren't in the repo or are named something else, I honestly wouldn't know where to start
2005-03-30T16:54:00.000Z	potsed	spectrm	thx for trying, appreciate it... i'll keep looking
2005-03-30T16:55:00.000Z	spectrm	potsed	maybe describe your problem to Amaranth or iRob...I'm just not familiar with ubuntu
