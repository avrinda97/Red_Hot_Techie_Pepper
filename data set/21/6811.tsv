2007-02-01T09:53:00.000Z	coach_z		can someone help me get ubuntu to recognize the second core on my Core 2 Duo?   kernel version: 2.6.15-27-amd64-generic #1 SMP PREEMPT.....i know i keep asking but i had to RMA 3 motherboards to get this thing working and now it isnt even working
2007-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	why in the world are you using an AMD kernel for your Core 2 Duo?
2007-02-01T09:56:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	im quite new to all this didnt know which one to download
2007-02-01T09:56:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	are you using Edgy or Dapper?
2007-02-01T09:56:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	dapper
2007-02-01T09:57:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	try installing the package linux-686-smp.
2007-02-01T09:57:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	use the command "sudo aptitude install linux-686-smp"
2007-02-01T09:58:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	i tried doing that before but it was failing probably bc i was using apt-get
2007-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	the nice thing about Edgy is it detects what kernel to use automatically
2007-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	i'd remove the amd kernel and try using the package linux-686-smp
2007-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	ill try doing that, and if it is a no go....i guess ill go get edgy.....this computer is solely a Folding@home machine so i just need something that is not going to crash
2007-02-01T10:01:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	 "Couldnt find any package whose name or description matched "linux-686-smp" no packages will be installed, upgradedd oor removed
2007-02-01T10:01:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	hmm...
2007-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	i dont need the cd in do i?
2007-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	run sudo aptitude update and try again
2007-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	that didnt work
2007-02-01T10:04:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	have you edited your sources.list at all?
2007-02-01T10:04:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	no
2007-02-01T10:04:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	I have no idea why that's not installing...
2007-02-01T10:05:00.000Z	coach_z	cablesm102	 i need to run out so im going to download edgy while i am out....what version should i download?
2007-02-01T10:06:00.000Z	cablesm102	coach_z	Edgy Eft is Ubuntu v 6.10
