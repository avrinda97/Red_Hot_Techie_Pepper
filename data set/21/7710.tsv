2006-11-25T09:41:00.000Z	san_		njal yeah that looks like the one can you help me through that, sorry if im being stupid im fairly new to all this
2006-11-25T09:42:00.000Z	njal_	san_	I can try
2006-11-25T09:42:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Ok, so download the second driver
2006-11-25T09:43:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Install driver and point it to the driver exe file
2006-11-25T09:45:00.000Z	njal_	san_	I know it wants an inf, but the driver came packaged as a exe, i don't know how to open it
2006-11-25T09:45:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Unless....you install it in windows and then copy the inf file over onto your linux machine
2006-11-25T09:46:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Let me know how it goes
2006-11-25T09:46:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Follow zaraphaths idea first
2006-11-25T09:48:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Cool, is it working?
2006-11-25T09:51:00.000Z	njal_	san_	try sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
2006-11-25T09:54:00.000Z	njal_	san_	No worries
2006-11-25T09:54:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Now
2006-11-25T09:54:00.000Z	njal_	san_	run sudo gedit /etc/modules
2006-11-25T09:55:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Add ndiswrapper at the end of the file, this should tell the system to run ndiswrapper at boot
2006-11-25T09:55:00.000Z	njal_	san_	The ultimate test is to reboot without the network cable in, then telling me after the reboot
2006-11-25T10:03:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Hmm
2006-11-25T10:04:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Did you run modprobe when you logged in?
2006-11-25T10:07:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Remove the ndiswrapper entry from /etc/modules reboot and then run the modprobe command, this will see if ndiswrapper is having problems at boot, erm no, i doubt it
2006-11-25T10:20:00.000Z	njal_	san_	Did you run modprobe after you logged in, or did it just work?
2006-11-25T10:23:00.000Z	njal_	san_	reboot a couple of more times, just to make sure it's not a fluke then i would be happy
2006-11-25T10:23:00.000Z	njal_	san_	That's what i would do
