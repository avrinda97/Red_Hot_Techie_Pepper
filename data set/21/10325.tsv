2005-09-28T12:37:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	what's so strange about it ?
2005-09-28T12:38:00.000Z	pixman	LinuxJones	that everytime I use it I have more fun to work with it :)
2005-09-28T12:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	heh
2005-09-28T12:38:00.000Z	pixman	LinuxJones	nowadays use it for everything... doing music, capturing tv shows, programming etc.
2005-09-28T12:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	yes it's wonderfull
2005-09-28T12:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	I wish there were some Professional Grade Video Editing tools to run on it :(
2005-09-28T12:39:00.000Z	pixman	LinuxJones	tried Cinelerra?
2005-09-28T12:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	too cumbersome
2005-09-28T12:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	pitiv but it's still in Alpha
2005-09-28T12:41:00.000Z	pixman	LinuxJones	ah, that one, right. tnx :)
2005-09-28T12:41:00.000Z	pixman	LinuxJones	didn't know it's still alpha... a matter of time ... or work one could do maybe yourself :)
2005-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	pixman	LinuxJones	btw, so far you can use virtualdub for video editing through wine...
2005-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	I am moving on Sunday across the country to goto work, no time :)
2005-09-28T12:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	pixman	In a few years there will be a few excellent ones
