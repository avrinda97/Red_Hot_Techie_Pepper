2006-09-25T14:50:00.000Z	Nrbelex		Hi - I'm accessing my Ubuntu machine via SSH and I need to change the VNC password using the terminal - how do I do that?
2006-09-25T14:50:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	vncpasswd
2006-09-25T14:52:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	I just tried that but my VNC viewer, TightVNC, is giving me "authentication failed" when I use the new Pword
2006-09-25T14:52:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	dunno then
2006-09-25T14:53:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	sorry#
2006-09-25T14:53:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	ok thanks anyway
2006-09-25T14:53:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	presumably your doing it as the user your trying to login as
2006-09-25T14:54:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	well there's really no "logging in", you just enter in the VNC password
2006-09-25T14:54:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	different users have different vnc passwords afaik
2006-09-25T14:55:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	Ok, thanks
2006-09-26T08:30:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	you have been asking this for hours
2006-09-26T08:30:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	what is your specific problem?
2006-09-26T08:30:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	this is, unfortunately, true
2006-09-26T08:31:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	after 20 seconds I routinely get signed off
2006-09-26T08:31:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	with a different error message depending on the viewer I use - but I always get signed off
2006-09-26T08:31:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	your looking for keepaliv or somthing
2006-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	that's a user in here sometimes?
2006-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	no, keepalive.. stops vnc or whatever service from timeing out.. its somthing you need to do
2006-09-26T08:33:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	oh, sweet - thanks
2006-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	Nrbelex	variant	are you talking about the keepalived package?
2006-09-26T08:38:00.000Z	variant	Nrbelex	not specificaly, that might help though
