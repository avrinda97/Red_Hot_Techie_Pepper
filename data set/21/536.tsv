2011-10-19T21:03:00.000Z	eufouria		Hi anyone know why my grub installatio nis throwing up this error: invalid environment block cannot read linux header?
2011-10-19T21:03:00.000Z	eufouria		running on hardware raid
2011-10-19T21:04:00.000Z	eufouria		I'm able to boot into older version of the kernel but the current throws up this error: invalid environment block cannot read linux header
2011-10-19T21:05:00.000Z	eufouria		Is it safe to simply remove the kernel version that is giving me problems?
2011-10-19T21:05:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	its the newest kernel which is causing the problems?
2011-10-19T21:06:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	this work?
2011-10-19T21:06:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	you can remove the newest kernel or boot an older kernel in grub but because of security its not a good idea to run an older patchlevel of the kernel
2011-10-19T21:07:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	great, yes
2011-10-19T21:07:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	well can i reinstall the latest kernel?
2011-10-19T21:07:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	sure
2011-10-19T21:07:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	I tried marking them for reinstallation but it did nothing
2011-10-19T21:08:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	what package you removed? the metapackage for the kernel or the kernel itself?
2011-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	marked everything in synaptic with the kernel version that was giving me trouble
2011-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	ok
2011-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	that is no problem
2011-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	it didn't do anything though
2011-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade should offer you again the latest kernel
2011-10-19T21:10:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	 well i never removed them
2011-10-19T21:10:00.000Z	iceroot	eufouria	ah ok
2011-10-19T21:10:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	i marked them for reinstalltion and they finished but to no solution
2011-10-19T21:11:00.000Z	eufouria	iceroot	 I'm going to try removing some stuff called grub env in the recovery shell brb
