2011-02-05T06:04:00.000Z	KM0201	brandon420	imo.. not much, if you dont have the ram.. but thast my opinion
2011-02-05T06:04:00.000Z	brandon420	KM0201	thats what i was thinking, but ill give it a shot
2011-02-05T06:05:00.000Z	KM0201	brandon420	i like gnomebaker
2012-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	KM0201	brandon420	did you run the command i told you?
2012-11-19T05:01:00.000Z	KM0201	brandon420	is pulseaudio even installed?
2012-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	brandon420	KM0201	Shouldn't it be by default?
2012-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	KM0201	brandon420	i think so... try sudo apt-get install pulseaudio   see if it installs... that looks like it's not installed
2012-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	brandon420	KM0201	brandon420@brandon420-M-7315U:~$ pulseaudio

2012-11-19T05:09:00.000Z	brandon420	KM0201	But shouldn't I delete the alsa folder (there isn't one) since I am trying to use pulse as my default?
2012-11-19T05:10:00.000Z	KM0201	brandon420	if you're trying to use pulse, why on earth do you have alsa installed?
