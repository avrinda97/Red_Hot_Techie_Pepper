2006-09-28T09:33:00.000Z	Firestar		sorry
2006-09-28T09:34:00.000Z	Firestar		any ideas, JosefK?
2006-09-28T09:35:00.000Z	Firestar		no
2006-09-28T09:35:00.000Z	Firestar		I'm running on the AMD64 server edition of 6.06
2006-09-28T09:35:00.000Z	Firestar		how can I see which version of the kernal I'm running?
2006-09-28T09:36:00.000Z	Firestar		Linux prophecy 2.6.15-26-amd64-server #1 SMP Fri Sep 8 20:33:15 UTC 2006 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2006-09-28T09:36:00.000Z	quintin	Firestar	uname -a !
2006-09-28T09:41:00.000Z	quintin	Firestar	You can boot the kernel with mem=xyz or such
2006-09-28T09:45:00.000Z	quintin	Firestar	what is your memory problem again, exactly?  You can force memory with mem=2048MB or whatever at boot time
2006-09-28T09:47:00.000Z	Firestar	quintin	I'm trying that now. JosefK is helping me add it to the menu.lst file
2006-09-28T09:48:00.000Z	quintin	Firestar	ja ja.  You can make it do that every time so you don't have to enter it manually.  how much ram you have?
2006-09-28T10:13:00.000Z	Firestar	quintin	I added the mem=4096 to my kopt line in menu.lst, but it's still not picking up 4GB of RAM. Exactly the same amount of RAM is picked up (~2.7 GB). Any ideas?
2006-09-28T10:14:00.000Z	Firestar	quintin	is there any way to check if the change happened?
2006-09-28T10:14:00.000Z	quintin	Firestar	look at output from top or look at /proc/meminfo
2006-09-28T10:15:00.000Z	Firestar	quintin	Dr_willis, top doesn't show more than ~2.7 GB, even after the change. I'll check the syntax, though
2006-09-28T10:45:00.000Z	quintin	Firestar	screwy!  are you sure you are writing the file?  did you update grub?
2006-09-28T10:45:00.000Z	Firestar	quintin	yes I am sure. I did an offline change and then uploaded the file again...
