2006-11-18T14:01:00.000Z	probose		hey guys... im trying to "./configure, make, make install" a program named p2kmoto... but look what happens in "make": http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32487/ How do i fix it?
2006-11-18T14:03:00.000Z	sky123	probose	it is very likely that you are missing the kernel-headers....do  a sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-11-18T14:03:00.000Z	probose	sky123	it says "build-essential is already the newest version" :(
2006-11-18T14:04:00.000Z	sky123	probose	hmmm.. that is weird.. one sec
2006-11-18T14:05:00.000Z	sky123	probose	yep that should do it.. sure looks like the headers are missing
2006-11-18T14:05:00.000Z	probose	sky123	newest version too :(
2006-11-18T14:06:00.000Z	sky123	probose	id try this is as sudo su .... find /  -name usb.h
2006-11-18T14:07:00.000Z	sky123	probose	lets see if it exists at all..
2006-11-18T14:08:00.000Z	sky123	probose	seems as if ndiswrapper has that...header..
2006-11-18T14:09:00.000Z	probose	sky123	so what i must do?
2006-11-18T14:09:00.000Z	sky123	probose	uname -a returns?
2006-11-18T14:12:00.000Z	sky123	probose	it seem that it "looks" for the presence of the file in a very specific location in the make file...and based on your paste...the usb.h file is in include...so maybe some sort of symbolic link to that?
2006-11-18T14:12:00.000Z	sky123	probose	id open up that make file and see where it is trying to look for usb.h
2006-11-18T14:12:00.000Z	sky123	probose	thats my two cents...
2006-11-18T14:14:00.000Z	sky123	probose	do you need to do the make all as sudo su or?? im just grasping for ideas now..
2006-11-18T14:15:00.000Z	sky123	probose	try it as root and see...
2006-11-18T14:16:00.000Z	probose	sky123	using sudo it gives me the same error :(
2006-11-18T14:17:00.000Z	sky123	probose	hang on...lemme do some checking around...
2006-11-18T14:17:00.000Z	probose	sky123	ok ;)
2006-11-18T14:19:00.000Z	probose	sky123	i made a test... i moved usb.h to the source directory and replaced include <usb.h> to include "usb.h" and it still not finding usb.h!!!
2006-11-18T14:35:00.000Z	sky123	probose	thats good advice...try...test...and see ...
