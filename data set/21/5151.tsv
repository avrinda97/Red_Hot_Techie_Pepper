2007-12-16T06:12:00.000Z	Surlent		I think I just won the pointlessly FUBAR'd PC of the month award. I was having trouble configuring my network, and went into KDE to try it from there, and when I plugged the cable in, the USB mouse decided to not work at all, so I decided to try and shut down. It was going fine, but lagged at the end and didn't seem to want to shut down, so I hit reset, and now the monitor refuses to display anything, although it works with every other com
2007-12-16T06:12:00.000Z	Surlent		puter on the planet.
2007-12-16T06:14:00.000Z	Surlent		I was using a nVidia GeForce 6200, and it worked, and then magically doesn't work 2 seconds later
2007-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	Have you tried removing the battery and resetting the CMOS?
2007-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	Surlent	BB88	...removing the...battery? How would I do that?
2007-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	On the motherboard, there should be a small battery near the CMOS jumper.
2007-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	Surlent	BB88	It looks like a watch battery, correct?
2007-12-16T06:18:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	Depends on your watch, but yes, a small round object.
2007-12-16T06:18:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	Remove it for a minute or two, or in extreme cases, leave it for a good twenty minutes (both do the same job).
2007-12-16T06:18:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	No, just built a few in my time :D
2007-12-16T06:19:00.000Z	Surlent	BB88	It was a sarcastic reference to me, as I take Computer Repair in school =(
2007-12-16T06:19:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	The joys of the internet, ambiguity :D
2007-12-16T06:20:00.000Z	Surlent	BB88	INDEED. But why the expletive would it randomly quit working after hitting reset?
2007-12-16T06:20:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	Are you using ubuntu, because I reset it once, and was unable to get past the main BIOS header.
2007-12-16T06:20:00.000Z	Surlent	BB88	Yes, Ubuntu. Although I shut down from KDE.
2007-12-16T06:21:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	I had similiar problems, and was unable to boot up past the the initial motherboard logo message, it just sat there. So just reset the CMOS and removed the battery, and all was fine :D
2007-12-16T06:22:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	You checked RAM, GFX, Power Supply?
2007-12-16T06:22:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	Well I would do the battery and CMOS first, then go through the list of RAM, GFX and Power Supply.
2007-12-16T06:22:00.000Z	Surlent	BB88	RAM is intact, the card plugged in, the power supply working. It was all working 100% until I hit reset while it was trying to shut down (and seemingly failing at it)
2007-12-16T06:23:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	Yes try the CMOS and Battery then, as I trouble with ubuntu and resetting causing non-booting.
2007-12-16T06:25:00.000Z	BB88	Surlent	No worries, and good luck.
