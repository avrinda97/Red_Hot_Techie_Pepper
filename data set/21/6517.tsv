2007-03-19T16:47:00.000Z	Hansel	garnier	- open a terminal or if you want to completely break out of the GUI you can CTRL ALT F1-F6 and then ALT + F7 to get back to the GUI  :)

2007-03-19T16:48:00.000Z	garnier	Hansel	ctrl+alt+f1 doesn't do anything
2007-03-19T16:48:00.000Z	Hansel	garnier	- hold down CTRL and ALT and then push F1 while those are depressed... nothing?
