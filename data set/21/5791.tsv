2007-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	faileas	desertc__	synaptic... thats... the apt front end right?
2007-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	desertc__	faileas	I have no idea - it's the only way Canonical recommends users to install packages
2007-08-07T15:48:00.000Z	desertc__	faileas	Add/remove is what windows users call it
2007-08-07T15:48:00.000Z	faileas	desertc__	i'm mostly a windows user ;p
2007-08-07T15:48:00.000Z	desertc__	faileas	Don't consider it another way to get to apt-get --- just tell people here to use synaptic
2007-08-07T15:49:00.000Z	faileas	desertc__	*shrug* or nothing at all. i'll have to check it out when i boot into linux later ;)
