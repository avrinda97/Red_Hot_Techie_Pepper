2012-07-08T19:26:00.000Z	Nogal		Does anyone have a few minutes to help?
2012-07-08T19:27:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	what's your problem ?
2012-07-08T19:31:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	1st issue -> telepathy is related to your Instant Messenging stuff. What component of telepathy is crashing ? Normally the crash report should mention telepathy-something, this something is important to know.
2012-07-08T19:32:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	in short: telepathy-salut
2012-07-08T19:35:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	if you still have the report somewhere, could you check if it looks like one of these bugs ? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/telepathy-salut
2012-07-08T19:36:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	is that the /var/crash/*telepathy-salut.1000.crash file?
2012-07-08T19:38:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for here....
2012-07-08T19:40:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	I don't know whether the crash reports are saved somewhere after you closed Apport
2012-07-08T19:41:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	can you reproduce the bug ?
2012-07-08T19:41:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	h/o
2012-07-08T19:42:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	is this what you're looking for? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1081332/
2012-07-08T19:42:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	looks like it :)
2012-07-08T19:43:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	future reference /var/crash
2012-07-08T19:43:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	thanks !
2012-07-08T19:45:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	we're looking for that: telepathy-salut crashed with signal 5 in g_return_if_fail_warning() in the existing bug reports
2012-07-08T19:47:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	is it easy to reproduce the bug or is it random ?
2012-07-08T19:49:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	it appears to be random.
2012-07-08T19:49:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	did it happen again ?
2012-07-08T19:49:00.000Z	Nogal	gigix	no
2012-07-08T19:50:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	well you can report the bug with "telepathy-salut crashed with signal 5 in g_return_if_fail_warning()" as a title and enclose the crash file with it
2012-07-08T19:51:00.000Z	gigix	Nogal	and mention that it happens randomly
