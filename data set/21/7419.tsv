2007-04-27T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 feisty upgrade uses the ubuntu-desktop meta pacakage as a ref for the upgrade proceedure
2007-04-27T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 which ever you prefer
2007-04-27T07:01:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	: whats the difference
2007-04-27T07:02:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	: can't i have everything
2007-04-27T07:02:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 you don'T need 3 different window managers
2007-04-27T07:02:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	: i just wanna see difference
2007-04-27T07:03:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 you can install all 3 and log into either as you boot and check them out if you want
2007-04-27T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 fr00d  I think I heard it was taken out of hte repos,  check the adobe site for it
2007-05-06T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	you are not being ignored , we just donT' know how to fix your problem,  just try commenting out the edgy lines
2007-05-19T09:55:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	: i have two os on two partitions and i require two boots every time to start! can u believe it?
2007-05-19T09:56:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	that's ridiculous,  grub should list all your os and allows you to boot directly to wich ever
2007-05-19T09:56:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 does one boot manager boot up the next ? osr someting
2007-05-19T09:57:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	: yes absolutely one entry on menu.lst boots other only the secondth time though
2007-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 well you can manualy edit menu.lst with   gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	what will i edit it as?
2007-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	there are complex UUID's stored!
2007-05-19T09:59:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	maybe you should try asking for help in #grub
2007-05-19T10:00:00.000Z	berent	Pelo	: ok
2007-05-20T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	berent	 that is not what I said at all,  do not put words in my mount
