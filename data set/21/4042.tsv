2008-08-11T19:20:00.000Z	Vegombrei		hi .. i installed ubuntu a few weeks ago .. i like it and wanna remove windows and make my pc a complete ubuntu computer ... how do i reinstall and which is the best version to download and install ?
2008-08-11T19:21:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 you can use gparted and change, move and resize partiton, but use the gparted live-CD.
2008-08-11T19:23:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 you can copy your installatio via cparted to an other disk. then reformat, and copy back
2008-08-11T19:25:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	its not like that .. lemme be more precise .. i have 2 hdd's .. one 80 gb and one 250 gb .. the 80 gb is independantly ubuntu .. the 250 gb is partitioned .. i wanna wipe that hdd out and incorporate it with ubuntu .. but the thing is the 250 gb is my primary master
2008-08-11T19:30:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 I always use gparted for repartentioning, and IMHO it doesn't take such a long time.
2008-08-11T19:32:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 and as wols said, you can mount any partiton to your ubuntu insatallation.
2008-08-11T19:33:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	actually i didnt understand it
2008-08-11T19:34:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 what is on the 250GB harddrive?
2008-08-11T19:34:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	im a noob dude i was looking up that fstab thing wols told me about
2008-08-11T19:37:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	windows on half the partition and music, movies, tv shows and porn on the other half
2008-08-11T19:41:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 if you like ubuntu on the 250GB-Disk you can resize the last partiton. you need about 5GB for full installation.
2008-08-11T19:42:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	the point being i dont want absolutely no partitions .. i want the hdd's to be a single partition of its true size thats it .. im tired of having to see so many drives
2008-08-11T19:43:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 ah you like to make on disk out of many partions on the 250GB?
2008-08-11T19:44:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	wols is right, in linux, you can mount every partion to your home...
2008-08-11T19:45:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	yeah dude .. its already got partitions .. i want to knock it all out and make it just one single 250 gb hdd .. thing is ubuntu is running from another 80 gb hdd in my system .. they're both sata but i think the 250 gb hdd is my primary . you think if i knock it out it'll take out bootloader etc ?
2008-08-11T19:48:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 I guess you can configure the boot sequence and device in your bios
2008-08-11T19:49:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 you want to keep the data on the first disk, you dont need win?
2008-08-11T19:51:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	dude this machine is at my home .. for home use .. ever since i been using ubuntu ive begun to realize this windows is shit and i dont think i wanna use it here anymore .. at work i use mac
2008-08-11T19:55:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	 you can now boot the ubuntu from the second disk?
2008-08-11T19:56:00.000Z	Vegombrei	pogay	thanks .. i think ill do that and get back to you ..
2008-08-11T19:56:00.000Z	pogay	Vegombrei	okydok
