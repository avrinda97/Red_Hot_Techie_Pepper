2007-01-15T13:30:00.000Z	arricka		I just updated to edgy, but I'm still having problems viewing websites with flash
2007-01-15T13:30:00.000Z	arricka		can anyone help me?
2007-01-15T13:30:00.000Z	arricka		I tried downloading it through links on firefox, but the installer is not coming up right, either
2007-01-15T13:31:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	have you installed flashplugin-nonfree from multiverse?
2007-01-15T13:32:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	k, if you want to get my attention, prefix what you say with my name
2007-01-15T13:36:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	ok, open up a terminal, type this command and tell me the output:  apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree | grep -i Installed
2007-01-15T13:39:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	ok good.  Now restart your browser and visit http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/ .  Is the flash working there?
2007-01-15T13:41:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	ok, what isn't working?
2007-01-15T13:43:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	is it a public website?  If so, what is the url?
2007-01-15T13:46:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	it works here, maybe you can try using flash9beta
2007-01-15T13:46:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	you'll need to enable -backports to upgrade flashplugin-nonfree
2007-01-15T13:49:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree   now says you have version 9?
2007-01-15T13:51:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	ok, open up a terminal, type this command and tell me the output:  apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree | grep -i Installed
2007-01-15T13:53:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	ok do this:  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2007-01-15T13:55:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	then you have not added -backports
2007-01-15T13:56:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file please
2007-01-15T13:57:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	type 'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' then copy and paste the results to pastebin
2007-01-15T14:00:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	not here.  Are you using http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ ?
2007-01-15T14:03:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	well that's strange.  Try pastebin.ca
2007-01-15T14:07:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	url?
2007-01-15T14:10:00.000Z	jrib	arricka	ah, breezy does not have flash9 in the repositories.  You'll need to install it manually.  Grab it here http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html and uninstall flashplugin-nonfree
