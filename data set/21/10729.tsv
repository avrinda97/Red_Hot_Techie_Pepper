2004-12-02T06:32:00.000Z	AptivaIBM		I kinda need some help here. I've tried to install Ubuntu on a IBM Aptiva. But the damn thing won't reboot properly.
2004-12-02T06:32:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Describe "not properly"
2004-12-02T06:34:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Anything before "boot"?
2004-12-02T06:34:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Anything after it, like a colon?
2004-12-02T06:41:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	The two last lines it displays is:
2004-12-02T06:44:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Has it ever booted into Ubuntu, or are you currently installing?
2004-12-02T06:46:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Did you get any error message (red screen)?
2004-12-02T06:46:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	Nope. It just stops not bothering to do anyting more...
2004-12-02T06:48:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Did it announce it'd reboot?
2004-12-02T06:49:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	That it did. It announced, it boots kinda ("Booting Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.8.1-3-386") and stops...
2004-12-02T06:52:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	What is the CPU in the machine?
2004-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Bramd?
2004-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	Intel.
2004-12-02T07:00:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Then I have no idea what could be wrong. You can try doing a manual installation, choosing for lilo instead of grub, to see if that makes any difference.
2004-12-02T07:01:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	So it should work? Well... I'm really not too good at installing manual... give me some hints?
2004-12-02T07:01:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	Just go with the defaults, and where you get the chance to choose grub, refuse that. The next option will be LILO.
2004-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	I'll try that. See you in a bit then! :)
2004-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	It's been a while since I did this, so I'm not sure where exactly in the installer this is.
2004-12-02T07:31:00.000Z	AptivaIBM	Juerd	The install went ok, but the boot failed again. Lilo only says that bios memory ok, and stops...
2004-12-02T07:32:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	That's not something LILO normally says :)
2004-12-02T07:32:00.000Z	Juerd	AptivaIBM	I'm sorry, but I have no idea what's wrong with your system.
