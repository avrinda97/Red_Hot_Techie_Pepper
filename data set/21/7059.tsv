2006-12-14T13:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Are you sure you can't get whatever it is you're trying to get from the official repositories?
2006-12-14T13:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Programs you're trying to install how?
2006-12-14T13:01:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	.debs that i downloaded from kde-apps.org
2006-12-14T13:02:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	even fesity doesnt seem to have kdelibs4. it has the same package as edgy
2006-12-14T13:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Ah. Yes, the ubuntu package is kdelibs4c2a, and no you don't need feisty packages.
2006-12-14T13:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	You're going to have to modify the dependencies in the poorly made debs or install from source.
2006-12-14T13:02:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	how do i modify the deps ?
2006-12-14T13:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Uhh... not easily. To be honest I wrote myself quite a complicated shell script to handle the unpacking and repacking. I advise you to install from source... unofficial debs will probably cause problems because they're compiled for different libraries.
2006-12-14T13:04:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	nope. i checked. they're not there. konverter, kmencoder and kooldock
2006-12-14T13:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Then I suggest you install from source.
2006-12-14T13:05:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	alright thanks
2006-12-14T13:06:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	what would happen if i forced it ?
2006-12-14T13:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Especially since, randomly googling for kooldock, I find that a) the debian package link is broken, and b) it's for Debian Sid, which isn't even ubuntu and probably won't be compatible.
2006-12-14T13:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Then it will complain about unresolved dependencies every time you use apt-get or synaptic for anything.
2006-12-14T13:07:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	shit. definitely had enough of that. thanks mate
2006-12-16T14:02:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	and if that command says yes, does that mean its enabled ?
2006-12-16T14:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	If the renderer string is not "GLX indirect" then it is enabled.
2006-12-16T14:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	Direct rendering must be "yes" for 3D to be on, but it can be "yes" without it being on.
2006-12-16T14:03:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	Mesa DRI Intel ?
2006-12-16T14:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	screechingcat	If it's not indirect, it's accelerated. Intel's drivers are GPL so they are handled by Mesa, the 3D infrastructure.
2006-12-16T14:04:00.000Z	screechingcat	arrenlex	right thanks
