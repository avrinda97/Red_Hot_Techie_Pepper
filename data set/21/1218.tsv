2010-12-23T02:10:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	thanks

2010-12-23T02:12:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	I have  an iso on my computer. The only way to get it to the one I want to install it on is to put it on a hard drive and boot it up. I could then install back to the same HDD
2010-12-23T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	VV	why dd it ?
2010-12-23T02:12:00.000Z	VV		I want to make sure that dd will make the disk bootable
2010-12-23T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	VV	dd has nothing to do with making it bootable
2010-12-23T02:13:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	how else to get the iso from my computer to the relevent HDD?
2010-12-23T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	VV	just copy it
2010-12-23T02:14:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	then how does it boot?
2010-12-23T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	VV	you need a boot loader
2010-12-23T02:15:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	the iso doesn't have one?
2010-12-23T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	VV	yes, but the iso doesn't have an mbr
2010-12-23T02:15:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	ah. strange
2010-12-23T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	VV	not really
2010-12-23T02:16:00.000Z	VV	ikonia	I'm used to just "burning" the iso, popping in the disk, and booting. I'm not used to having to get critical parts like the mbr on my own
