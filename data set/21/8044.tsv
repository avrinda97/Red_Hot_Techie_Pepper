2006-06-06T08:31:00.000Z	d34db14ck		any one knows of a bit torrent like client for ubuntu?
2006-06-06T08:32:00.000Z	d34db14ck		can i mount ntfs partition under ubuntu?
2006-06-06T08:33:00.000Z	d34db14ck		but then i can't write on it?
2006-06-06T08:34:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	Which filesystems don't allow that?
2006-06-06T08:34:00.000Z	d34db14ck	Fjodor	 fat 32 lol
2006-06-06T08:35:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	Make it ext3 or reiserfs. There are windows drivers for those, though I haven't got any experience with them
2006-06-06T08:36:00.000Z	d34db14ck	Fjodor	 i run linux/windoze now but once i get myself going on linux i will sht on windoze
2006-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	Samuli^ might be right about ext3, but reiserfs should be the way to go then
2006-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	ext2 isn't journaling, which you may want
2006-06-06T08:39:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	reiser is, is mightily well supported on Linux, and there are drivers for win
2006-06-06T08:39:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	Why not burn i Linux?
2006-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	d34db14ck	Fjodor	 i'm a noob :)
2006-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	Shouldn't matter much
2006-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	k3b is very easy to use
2006-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	d34db14ck	Fjodor	all i need is music(check) movies( kinda ok) and download and burning . if i get this upi don't need dual OS and drivers for stuph and transfer
2006-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	k3b is seriously your friend for burning. sudo apt-get install k3b to get it
2006-06-06T08:42:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	But it needs kde libs, so it might ask to download and install quite a few things. That isn't a problem, though
2006-06-06T08:43:00.000Z	d34db14ck	Fjodor	 well i'll figure it out eventually. i've installed a few progs. still need some p2p client and how to burn stuph
2006-06-06T08:45:00.000Z	Fjodor	d34db14ck	Well, happy learning to you. Gotta read up for an exam now, but as you are in the process of, you'll find people in here most helpful :-)
