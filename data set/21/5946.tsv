2007-07-20T15:01:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		why is this taking so fscking long on the Migrate Documents and Settings page?
2007-07-20T15:01:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		and is there any way to skip it?
2007-07-20T15:01:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	you have too many documents and settins
2007-07-20T15:01:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	frack no.  I have *none*
2007-07-20T15:02:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	I blew away the ailing XP partition with cfdisk before starting the  installer
2007-07-20T15:02:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	you are using the livecd now?
2007-07-20T15:02:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	yes
2007-07-20T15:03:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	is it a very fast computer?
2007-07-20T15:04:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	and it got stuck at the migrating phase?
2007-07-20T15:04:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	yeah
2007-07-20T15:05:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	I thought there was a checkbox on, or maybe before, the migrating page that said "do not bother migrating settings"
2007-07-20T15:05:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	"If you don not wish to import any accounts, select nothing and go to the next page."
2007-07-20T15:07:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	did you ceck the cd for errors?
2007-07-20T15:07:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	hmm... not recently
2007-07-20T15:08:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	I've been running off the liveCD for the past few days on that laptop
2007-07-20T15:09:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	hey, so is it working now?
2007-07-20T15:09:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	no, I'm just back where I was before I got fed up and restarted the process last time
2007-07-20T15:11:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	the alternate install cd is in text mode, and very fast therefore, but it's still pretty user friendly, if I recall ok
2007-07-20T15:12:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	pete83	yeah, basically just an ncurses alternative to the Qt or GTK installers
2007-07-20T15:12:00.000Z	pete83	Dhraakellian	exactly
