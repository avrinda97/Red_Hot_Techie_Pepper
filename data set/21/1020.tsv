2011-12-09T16:20:00.000Z	gappie	Mr_Queue	: instead of running it as root? how?
2011-12-09T16:20:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	gappie	as root, add the user to the mix.
2011-12-09T16:21:00.000Z	gappie	Mr_Queue	: what does that do: sudo -u username /path/to/command/
2011-12-09T16:22:00.000Z	gappie	Mr_Queue	: ok so will stdout be displayed on the screen then?
