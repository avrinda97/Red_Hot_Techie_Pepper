2011-03-23T16:03:00.000Z	kmanzoor		is Hardy Heron still supported ? i checked this on wikipedia. On kubuntu page it said it is not spported but on the ubuntu page it is mentioned that it is still supported.  I want to install the restricted extra - meaning i want to have the adobe flash. Should i upgrade all the way to 9.10 or i can keep on running Hardy Heron ?
2011-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	kmanzoor	you should upgrade to at least 10.04 as ubuntu 8.04 is only supported until april of this year
2011-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	kmanzoor	since 8.04 and 10.04 are both LTS you can upgrade directly 8.04 -> 10.04
2011-03-23T16:07:00.000Z	kmanzoor		ok. the thing i am running now is kubuntu 8.4 (Hardy). Should i do a step by step upgrade or i can skip some versions
2011-03-23T16:08:00.000Z	jrib		!upgrade | kmanzoor
2011-03-23T16:10:00.000Z	kmanzoor		ok i am reading the upgrade notes
2011-03-23T16:16:00.000Z	kmanzoor		On this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades it is mentioned that Direct upgrades to Kubuntu 10.04 LTS are supported from Kubuntu 9.10 (but not Kubuntu 8.04)." I am using 8.04 (Hardy) and i am confused.
2011-03-23T16:19:00.000Z	kmanzoor		does this mean i will have to move from 8.4 to 9.10. does anybody know the instruction page for this ?
2011-03-23T16:23:00.000Z	kmanzoor	[TK]D-Fender	: thanks for providing that needed link
2011-03-23T16:25:00.000Z	kmanzoor	[TK]D-Fender	:Â ok
2011-03-23T16:29:00.000Z	kmanzoor		I have Adept 2.1 Cruiser 3.5.10. The instructions say that i must have adept-manager 2.1.3ubuntu25.2 installed. How to solve this issue ?

2011-03-23T16:36:00.000Z	kmanzoor	[TK]D-Fender	: i upgraded from Gutsy to Hardy today using the Adept. I havent performed any updates separately.
2011-03-23T16:39:00.000Z	kmanzoor		how can one update  Adept 2.1 Cruiser 3.5.10 to adept-manager 2.1.3ubuntu25.2 ?
2011-03-23T16:40:00.000Z	kmanzoor	[TK]D-Fender	: thats alright
2011-03-23T16:44:00.000Z	kmanzoor		I went to Adept and used the About feature in the Help tab to find my version it said: Adept 2.1 Cruiser 3.5.10. Is my version older than adept-manager 2.1.3ubuntu25.2 ?
2011-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	kmanzoor		my version problem is solved. i was look at the wrong place. the correct place to check the version is the adept packages manager - packages list and not the About menu.
2011-03-23T17:23:00.000Z	kmanzoor		i started the upgrade from Hardy to Karmic.
2011-03-23T17:24:00.000Z	kmanzoor		Distribution upgrade is running. I am running Kopete alongside. Would it cause any install issues ?
2011-03-23T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	kmanzoor	nope
