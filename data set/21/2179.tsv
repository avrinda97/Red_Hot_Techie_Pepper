2010-05-27T03:54:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	i think you have grub confused... lol
2010-05-27T03:55:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	you booting ubuntu from external right? xp from internal...
2010-05-27T03:55:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	your*
2010-05-27T03:55:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	 yeah...
2010-05-27T03:56:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	 thoughts?
2010-05-27T03:56:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	and what doesnt boot again?
2010-05-27T03:57:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	 Windows XP Professional Edition. SP3
2010-05-27T03:58:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	so grub shows, then what, when you choose windows?
2010-05-27T03:58:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	 yeah
2010-05-27T03:59:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	i hit enter on windows, the screen goes black for a bit then it goes to "off-black" with a blinking underscore.
2010-05-27T04:00:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	do you have a windows disk?
2010-05-27T04:00:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	cd?
2010-05-27T04:00:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	 Yes
2010-05-27T04:01:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	probably easy way is to boot from that, and run fixmbr from recovery console, then reinstall grub, after you get windows to start
2010-05-27T04:08:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	okay. so just throw in the windows disk, if it works then type fixmbr in windows's command console??
2010-05-27T04:10:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	yes, that should make windows boot
2010-05-27T04:10:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	then you will need to reinstall grub to dual boot again
2010-05-27T04:11:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	okay, i guess i'll pop back in, if and when i have a question.
2010-05-27T04:13:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	 what about that link wildbat / cjdevlin  were linking? is that essentially the same thing or what?
2010-05-27T04:14:00.000Z	mkquist	santisnight	 wildbat: still need fixmbr to get windows back...
2010-05-27T04:14:00.000Z	santisnight	mkquist	okay.
