2009-04-21T04:20:00.000Z	BrianPianka	histo	I verified it and it was bad. I got it from ubuntu.com ad it was bad. is there anywhere else I could get it?
2009-04-21T04:20:00.000Z	histo	BrianPianka	the iso is bad or the cd you burned?
2009-04-21T04:21:00.000Z	histo	BrianPianka	you can run an md5 check on the iso.  Then you can also run a media check on the disk after its burned assuming hte iso is okay.
2009-04-21T04:21:00.000Z	histo	BrianPianka	Most people have success just burning the image at a slower speed.
