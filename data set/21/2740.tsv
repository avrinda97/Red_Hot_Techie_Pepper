2009-07-06T09:27:00.000Z	akore		all of my files are on the windows ntfs partition, and I want to integrate that into linux, so it's the default for everything
2009-07-06T09:28:00.000Z	akore		I dont want to move the location, and would like to continue saving files to that ntfs area
2009-07-06T09:28:00.000Z	akore		this /home this keeps popping up though
2009-07-06T09:28:00.000Z	akore		so how do I make my desktop, document, pics, and all of that link to say drive C instead of the default linux partition

2009-07-06T09:32:00.000Z	akore	mituss	the apps I use dont work when in virtualized environments like premiere pro

2009-07-06T09:33:00.000Z	mituss	akore	ou yes they do

2009-07-06T09:34:00.000Z	mituss		and if i'm correct do you give me your house and car keys?
2009-07-06T09:37:00.000Z	akore	mituss	in a native environment, my projects render much faster.
2009-07-06T09:37:00.000Z	akore	mituss	I dont doubt you can get it to work, but it wouldnt be worth it
2009-07-06T09:38:00.000Z	akore	mituss	and I am familiar with virtualbox, so i tried it but wasnt satisfied
