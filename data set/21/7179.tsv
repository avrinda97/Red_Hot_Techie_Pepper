2008-01-17T06:55:00.000Z	Onyx		I'm trying to find out where amarok keeps its default icon.  Can anyone help me out with this?  It'
2008-01-17T06:55:00.000Z	Onyx		It's been a very frustrating 3 days trying to track this thing down...
2008-01-17T06:57:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	try this "find /usr | grep -i amarok | grep -i png".. see what kind of hits you get
2008-01-17T06:58:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	looks like /usr/share/apps/amarok/icons/ would be a good place to look
2008-01-17T06:59:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	I've been through /usr/share/apps/amarok/icons already -- no dice.
2008-01-17T06:59:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	what icon are you looking for?
2008-01-17T06:59:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	Amarok's main program icon (the one that would sit in the tray)
2008-01-17T07:06:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	look here /usr/share/app-install/icons
2008-01-17T07:06:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	I've got an amarok icon there.. looks like the one in the menu
2008-01-17T07:07:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	I've already replaced that one with the one I want... still no dice :/
2008-01-17T07:08:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	or this one /usr/share/icons/hicolor/64x64/apps
2008-01-17T07:08:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	or.. wait.. what are you trying to do?
2008-01-17T07:08:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	Same thing there... I'm wondering if it's possible for it to somehow be compiled in?
2008-01-17T07:09:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	I'm trying to get Avant Window Navigator (awn) to use the icon I want it to use for amarok -- it fails to do this because apparently it's difficult to get awn to respect system-wide icon themes.  Attempts to manually set the icon are reversed the moment the application is launched again...
2008-01-17T07:10:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	hmm.. I'm not sure replacing icons all over the place is the best approach.. isn't there anything in awn you can change?
2008-01-17T07:11:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	Not according to the developers...
2008-01-17T07:12:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	ask the developers where awn finds the icon?
2008-01-17T07:12:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	They've said it's very random and depends on a number of "difficult to explain factors".
2008-01-17T07:14:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	wow.. I have to remember that for when my students ask weird questions.. "it's very random and depends on a number of difficult to explain factors"
2008-01-17T07:14:00.000Z	Onyx	Slart	haha, yeah, that really made me go "uhhhh.... doesn't sound like a very good answer."
2008-02-21T04:22:00.000Z	Slart	Onyx	 I have no idea.. you might get some answers in #winehq , it's the official wine support channel
