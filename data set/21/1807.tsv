2010-04-27T04:16:00.000Z	Antani_01		Okay...
2010-04-27T04:17:00.000Z	Antani_01		I try copying some stuff to the hard drive. It copies a bit. The copying stops, just freezes. Gnome-panel and nautilus both freeze. I get the error in the syslog. The drive is a SATA drive that I bought yesterday. The error in the syslog is Apr 26 18:47:16 john-desktop ntfs-3g[3292]: Failed to read vcn 0x1bd: Input/output error
2010-04-27T04:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Antani_01	Can you check the drive's health in System > Administration > Disk Utility?
2010-04-27T04:19:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Actually, The Disk Utility doesn't work on my hard drive. It says smart is not available. I used gsmartcontrol instead.
2010-04-27T04:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Antani_01	And the resluts from gsmartcontrol?
2010-04-27T04:20:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	You want me to paste all the results?
2010-04-27T04:21:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	http://paste.ubuntu.com/423059/
2010-04-27T04:25:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	In case you didn't see it... http://paste.ubuntu.com/423059/
2010-04-27T04:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Antani_01	Can you try running chkdsk in windows to be sure the filesystem isn't corrupt?
2010-04-27T04:27:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Windows is broken... But I CAN reformat the drive. I have nothing important on there. I fear the problem may be caused by me using Gparted to format to NTFS. By the way, is there another filesystem that Windows and Ubuntu have read/write access to (No need to boot from it)? A better, faster one perhaps?
2010-04-27T04:27:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Also, if there isn't a better filesystem, should I use something other than Gparted to format to NTFS?
2010-04-27T04:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Antani_01	Gparted should be fine for creating an ntfs filesystem. There are drivers for windows to read and write ext3, but they don't support journaling (they are really ext2 drivers)
2010-04-27T04:33:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Hmm... check this out: http://paste.ubuntu.com/423062/
2010-04-27T04:36:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Did you say anything? Empathy crashed
2010-04-27T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Antani_01	No.
2010-04-27T04:40:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	And also, that has happened before, too.
2010-04-27T04:41:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Maybe I should wipe the drive...
2010-04-27T04:44:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Great... After I reformatted and remounted it, Nautilus froze
2010-04-27T04:44:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Why is it so broken?
2010-04-27T04:45:00.000Z	Antani_01	Jordan_U	Are you still there? I need to leave soon.
2010-04-27T04:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Antani_01	I don't know.
