2007-10-12T08:47:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	won't he need a wired internet connection (or two connections wireless or wired) to do that?
2007-10-12T08:47:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	maybe i misunderstood. I thought he had a wired one, and he wanted to open his wireless one up as an AP for his roommate/whomever.
2007-10-12T08:48:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	no you're right, thats what hes got

2007-10-12T08:49:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	ya, I have to figure out how to VPN into my work which uses RSA SecureID's and a nortel client
2007-10-12T08:50:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	oh well that sounds like a blast
2007-10-12T08:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	they probly are, but u chose 32-bit kernel?
2007-10-12T08:54:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	I downloaded 64bit AMD and Intel server iso and it wouldnt install. gave a message saying to use 32bit.
2007-10-12T08:54:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	no kiddin...
2007-10-12T08:54:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	yep.
2007-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	did u read this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=153165
2007-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	probably not :)
2007-10-12T08:57:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	looking now
2007-10-12T08:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	you xeon could be either 64-bit or 32-bit apparently
2007-10-12T08:59:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	you think HP would put 32bit Xeon's in a DL360 G3? I just dont see that for a 1500 machine
2007-10-12T09:00:00.000Z	bone	Evanlec	actually maybe they are. I installed XP on one at work so I bet they are 32's
2007-10-12T09:00:00.000Z	Evanlec	bone	i dunno, maybe, check the specs on the model if its a brand-name system
