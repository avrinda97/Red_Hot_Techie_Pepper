2012-01-17T15:13:00.000Z	thinkclay		Okay.. anyone help with this one: My video card in this server is seriously low end.. 2d graphics.. really need to keep graphics minimal.. What boot flags do i set? And am I setting them correctly before booting by hitting F6 and setting to expert mode and then adding in string to the boot options?
2012-01-17T15:13:00.000Z	ekakela_	thinkclay	You running X in server?
2012-01-17T15:13:00.000Z	thinkclay		running X?
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	ekakela_		I'd prefer to keep it console enviroment only, no graphical desktop at all
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	ekakela_		Easier with low end hardware
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	thinkclay		ya I would
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	thinkclay		How do i do that?
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	ekakela_		Just choose during installation not to install it
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	ekakela_		as far as I remember, ubuntu-server installation doesn't even try install it.
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	thinkclay		No I didnt
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	thinkclay		Nothing installed
2012-01-17T15:14:00.000Z	thinkclay		Cant get to install screen
2012-01-17T15:15:00.000Z	thinkclay		I get the ubuntu boot (1st screen when booting from CD) and then black screen no matter what I do to proceed
2012-01-17T15:15:00.000Z	ekakela_		Hmmh, download yourself the ubuntu-server image and install it in expert mode, doesn't have so much grahics
2012-01-17T15:16:00.000Z	thinkclay		I've run Ubuntu Server like a pro in VM enviroments, but this is my first physical box
2012-01-17T15:16:00.000Z	ekakela_		but your problem sounds more like broken cd :D
2012-01-17T15:17:00.000Z	thinkclay	ekakela_	second time I've heard the broken CD bit tonight.. I'm installing from a DVD that I burnt.. downloaded image matches checksum
2012-01-17T15:18:00.000Z	ekakela_	thinkclay	checksum match doesn't mean the disk itself wouldn't be broken or the diskreader
2012-01-17T15:19:00.000Z	ekakela_		Since you said that server has so crappy graphics card, have to ask : does it even have a dvd-reader or just cd?
2012-01-17T15:19:00.000Z	thinkclay	ekakela_	I burnt with mac.. let it verify and everything. I'll try again tho. It has DVD reader :)
2012-01-17T15:19:00.000Z	ekakela_	thinkclay	Do you have option to try with USB-stick?
