2010-02-27T13:50:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		you mean the folder that your website is in, like /home/user/public_html ?
2010-02-27T13:50:00.000Z	rabbit1		yeap
2010-02-27T13:51:00.000Z	rabbit1	ultraparadigm	my phpinfo file is in www<- var <- /
2010-02-27T13:51:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		hmm well execute is 1, and I think read is 2, and write is 4,   so you want chmod 722
2010-02-27T13:52:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		yes
2010-02-27T13:52:00.000Z	rabbit1	ultraparadigm	my phpinfo file is in www<- var <- /
2010-02-27T13:53:00.000Z	rabbit1	ultraparadigm	its in root
2010-02-27T13:53:00.000Z	rabbit1	ultraparadigm	should i change it in config, or shall i go ahead and use the same root folder?
2010-02-27T13:53:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		then you want chmod 722 /var/www
2010-02-27T13:54:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		Usually you would put your web stuff in /home/user/web
2010-02-27T13:54:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		or /homeuser/public_html  etc.
