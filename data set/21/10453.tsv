2005-04-26T06:36:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		ok, so i've been using the ubuntu live cd for a while, and so far it just seems like my normal linux except with pre-prettified gnome (yes, i like the brown too). What can i do to experience the ubuntuness and perhaps become an ubuntu convert?
2005-04-26T06:37:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	hm. ubuntu is very consistent and has good docs. try www.ubuntu.com docs and www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-04-26T06:38:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Shufla	what do you mean by consistent? the docs certainly seem good, but they seem to ubuntu-specific. the docs let me solve all my problems practically, but i rarely seem to learn much
2005-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	as for me ubuntu works out of the box. there are some quirks. if you are win32 convert then without little suppoort (live i mean not by net) from someone...
2005-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	...more exp it will be hard. but if you are familiar with linux, ubuntu is ready for you.
2005-04-26T06:40:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	you have to answer critical question: what do you need from computer? then visit docs and get a clue if ubuntu is good for you.
2005-04-26T06:41:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Shufla	ubuntu definitely seems a great "out-of-the-box" distro. no denying that. though arch is quite the opposite, and i'm loving that. i'm just curious how the other half lives! once again, i DO like the brown...
2005-04-26T06:42:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	eh. i much better ubuntu-advocate and zealot in my native language :D
2005-04-26T06:42:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Shufla	dont worry. zealotry knows no borders
2005-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	ah,. i forgot ;) in that sentence :D
2005-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Shufla	why do YOU use ubuntu?
2005-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	hehe. right now not exactly...: shufla@hardin:~> cat /etc/issue | grep Welcome
2005-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	and why i do use (@home, @servers)? 1. debian based (i know debian, i can do some packages if i need).
2005-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	2. desktop is ready to go and it's spartan.
2005-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	3. got up to dated apps, java support is not oob, but well documented
2005-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	4. #ubuntu, ubuntuforums.org
2005-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	99. Ubuntu just fits me.
2005-04-26T06:48:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Shufla	if you werent already so .deb and apt proficient, what are the chances you'd still use a debian based system?
2005-04-26T06:49:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	2 years waiting for sarge.
2005-04-26T06:49:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	Shufla	so there is such a thing is TOO much foreplay?
2005-04-26T06:49:00.000Z	Shufla	jacquesmerde	well. i do not understand you.
