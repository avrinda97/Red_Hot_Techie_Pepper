2008-03-03T02:21:00.000Z	Nub9001		I need a little bit of help please.
2008-03-03T02:22:00.000Z	Nub9001		I renamed my user thingy due to a spelling mistake and it said I coiuld change the name of the home folder too but i did and now i can't login to gnome D:
2008-03-03T02:22:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	user thingy?
2008-03-03T02:24:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	It still had my home folder listed with /misspelledname/home, so I just changed it :D
2008-03-03T02:24:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	you used usermod to change a users home dir, or something else. Need to know exactly what you did before we can get a fix
2008-03-03T02:25:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	if its a simple name change of a directory mv olddir newdir
2008-03-03T02:25:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	I was under the impression that mv moved the folder...?
2008-03-03T02:26:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	mv is the same as rename (essentialy). If you specify a name that already exists, it will get overwridden
2008-03-03T02:26:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	overwitten
2008-03-03T02:27:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	if the newname already exists then it will probably throw up an error actually, but since you say you already moved it to the wrong name, surely teh right name doesnt exist?
2008-03-03T02:28:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	there is no longer a folder called /usernaem/home. I changed it to /username/home.
2008-03-03T02:28:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	it should be /home/username you know
2008-03-03T02:28:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	my mistake D:
2008-03-03T02:28:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	if hte newdirectory doesnt exist, then just change it,
2008-03-03T02:29:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	cd to /home and "mv usernaem username"
2008-03-03T02:29:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	so I type mv /home/usernaem and it will work again without losing anything i previously had right?
2008-03-03T02:31:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	no, type "mv /home/usernaem /home/username" and it will move the directory to the right name. This may not solve the issue of course, it just does that you asked me to tell you what to do (namely rename the directory)
2008-03-03T02:31:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	that seems promising. Thank you. I may be back in a few moments though needing more help :}
2008-03-03T02:37:00.000Z	Nub9001	Squawk	it seems to have done what I wanted :} Thanks. I just wasn't sure how to go about changing it =/
2008-03-03T02:37:00.000Z	Squawk	Nub9001	research "linux basics, or bash basics, or command line basics", just to get aquainted with linux simple operations
