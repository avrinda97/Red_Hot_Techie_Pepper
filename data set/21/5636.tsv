2007-10-20T02:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	Synaptic / apt
2008-11-22T07:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	What have you tried?
2008-11-22T07:13:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	first firestarter, then iptables
2008-11-22T07:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	Are you using 8.10 ?
2008-11-22T07:13:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	yes
2008-11-22T07:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	Have you tried network-manager's sharing feature?
2008-11-22T07:14:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	such a thing exists?
2008-11-22T07:15:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	cant believe you
2008-11-22T07:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	Yes, System > Preferences > Network Configuration, set the interface you want to share on to "sharing mode"
2008-11-22T07:17:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	Idont see that sharing mode, where is it
2008-11-22T07:17:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	?
2008-11-22T07:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	Select the connection, Edit, ipv4 settings
2008-11-22T07:21:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	my Internet comes in trough my wired connection,should I put that in sharing mode?
2008-11-22T07:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	No, you should set the connection to the other computer to "shared to other computers"
2008-11-22T07:23:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	umm, so that would be, create a new wireless conection, and set it in sharing mode, then my wireless devices will just "see" the connection like a HotSpot and thats all?
2008-11-22T07:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	As far as I can tell yes ( but unlike a hotspot I think that a computer's wireless card can only share to one computer at a time )
2008-11-22T07:26:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	i want the connection for my Iphone, ill try that thanks
2008-11-22T07:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaser	np
2008-11-22T07:28:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	well, I can see the newly created wifi network with my Iphone, I can connect to it
2008-11-22T07:28:00.000Z	yaser	Jordan_U	but i dont have Internet, any thing to try
