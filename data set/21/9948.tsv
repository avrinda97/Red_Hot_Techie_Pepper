2005-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	when I had very similar probs, it was my motherboard, not my RAM...
2005-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	stjepan	Madpilot	so, what should I do?
2005-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	can you test your RAM in someone else's computer first?
2005-08-08T15:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	new computer?
2005-08-08T15:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	not sure what to suggest then. try a new install of Ubuntu, and double-check the CDs your using?
2005-08-08T15:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	did you burn your own install CD for Ubuntu?
2005-08-08T15:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	np - later
2006-04-26T13:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	because they're larger packages than just gnome/kde/xfce
2006-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	you're going to get biased answers here - check the name of the channel :P
2006-05-25T12:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo please - you're wrong about sudo...
2006-05-31T11:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	stjepan	that must be a customized version of Gnome
2006-05-31T11:05:00.000Z	stjepan	Madpilot	it's SuSE :)
