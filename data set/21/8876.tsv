2005-12-27T17:00:00.000Z	Eleaf		mcjerry, no i don't believe so
2005-12-27T17:00:00.000Z	Eleaf		mcjerry, I think it's the video card
2005-12-27T17:01:00.000Z	Eleaf		mcjerry, I have a lot of segmentation faults whenever I run the card in 16 bit mode (direct 3d rendering)
2005-12-27T17:01:00.000Z	Eleaf		it keeps saying mcjerry lol
2005-12-27T17:02:00.000Z	Eleaf		I'm pretty sure it only happens in blender too
2005-12-27T17:02:00.000Z	Eleaf		lol
2005-12-27T17:02:00.000Z	Eleaf		why?
2005-12-27T17:02:00.000Z	Eleaf		ok
2005-12-27T17:04:00.000Z	QRZ	Eleaf	 Are you overclocking?
2005-12-27T17:04:00.000Z	Eleaf	QRZ	=p
2005-12-27T17:04:00.000Z	Eleaf	QRZ	not at the moment, although i sometimes do
2005-12-27T17:05:00.000Z	Eleaf		I'm getting a new motherboard, processor, video card etc anyways soon.  But this is a great machine =p
2005-12-27T17:05:00.000Z	QRZ	Eleaf	 As I'm sure you're aware, overclocking is somewhat of an art (actually more of a balancing act)!
2005-12-27T17:06:00.000Z	Eleaf	QRZ	yeee, I can't overclock very far because my motherboard can only change the fsb
2005-12-27T17:06:00.000Z	Eleaf		so I can only gain like 80 mhz QRZ!
2005-12-27T17:06:00.000Z	QRZ	Eleaf	 Anyway, good luck with it.  I'd run some RAM tests though.
2005-12-27T17:06:00.000Z	Eleaf		I have a 900 mhz processor, it's fun
2005-12-27T17:06:00.000Z	QRZ	Eleaf	 Probably not worth overclocking then :-)
2005-12-27T17:06:00.000Z	Eleaf	QRZ	ok, should i use the memtest kernel at boot?
2005-12-27T17:07:00.000Z	Eleaf	QRZ	I do notice some extra performance though!
2005-12-27T17:08:00.000Z	QRZ	Eleaf	 That or memtest86  --> http://www.memtest86.com/
