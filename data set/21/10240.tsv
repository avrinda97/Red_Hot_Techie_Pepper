2005-04-19T06:16:00.000Z	vessuvius		Anyone familiar with bind?  I have it working perfectly on my dns server, but I can't seem to get it to resolve for other machines on the network...
2005-04-19T06:16:00.000Z	vessuvius		and I can ping the machine running bind from the other machines
2005-04-19T06:16:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	as root, lsof -i :53
2005-04-19T06:17:00.000Z	vessuvius	lamont_r	on the dns machine?
2005-04-19T06:17:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	yeah - is it actually listening on other than 127.0.0.1?
2005-04-19T06:18:00.000Z	vessuvius	lamont_r	I got a listing , but I can't tell what ip its listening on
2005-04-19T06:19:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	sorry... lsof -ni :53
2005-04-19T06:23:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	you just did an install, nothing beyond that?  or did you addzones, etc?
2005-04-19T06:23:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	hrm..
2005-04-19T06:25:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	resolv.conf on the client points at .3?
2005-04-19T06:26:00.000Z	vessuvius	lamont_r	I can switch over to a linux client if needed
2005-04-19T06:26:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	but your server is running on .2....
2005-04-19T06:29:00.000Z	vessuvius	lamont_r	when I did the lsof command, it lists named a bunch of times, but there are different users... bind and root... and 4 different pids
2005-04-19T06:29:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	does the machine have more than one IP then?
2005-04-19T06:30:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	then why should the client expect to get answers from .2 when it sends its requests to .3
2005-04-19T06:30:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	it's multithreaded - there is onmly one
2005-04-19T06:31:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	ah, ok
2005-04-19T06:32:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	I'm one for overkill debugging tools....
2005-04-19T06:32:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	we're looking to see if the server is sending a response or not
2005-04-19T06:49:00.000Z	vessuvius	lamont_r	I think it was just something with my acl for allow-query... I explicitly typed in my client address, and now it works ;-)
2005-04-19T06:49:00.000Z	lamont_r	vessuvius	ah, ok
