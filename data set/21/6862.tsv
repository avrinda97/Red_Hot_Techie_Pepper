2009-05-26T23:32:00.000Z	Seer7		Hi. was in here a bit ago..TheNano was helping.. but he had to go. anyone want to help me on a sound issue?
2009-05-26T23:33:00.000Z	Seer7		yeah < i chose to change my log in name. sorry.. was in as rj earlier.
2009-05-26T23:33:00.000Z	Seer7		I may need a little bitof  PM time to help me config the sound system.
2009-05-26T23:34:00.000Z	Seer7		Vlet.. you interested in helping me config my sound system so i can finish getting alll my system sounds?
2009-05-26T23:35:00.000Z	Seer7		yeah.. Velt just tired of having to repeat the same things over and over again in here.. to wait for some one to tell me to FIND a Tute and come back later. i am trying to Time manage.
2009-05-26T23:35:00.000Z	Seer7		Is there ANY ONE in here who has some skills with setting up a sound system? I am in the 904 upgrade of Ubuntu. ALL sounds work except the OGG sounds for start up and log off.
2009-05-26T23:37:00.000Z	Seer7		< is still a bit of a Noobe.. and needs some one to walk me through.. i have done all the tuts.. and gotten the general sounds , video, flash and all to work.. but its not giving me system sounds.. it was fine in 810.. its not My sound card.. tis a config conflict.. so.. maybe if some one could help me find that?
2009-05-26T23:39:00.000Z	Seer7		i will post any terminal out put things that some one asks for. but i havent the first clue on how to set this up. IT seems.. that it wont play files of OGG. but wave and such are fine.
2009-05-26T23:41:00.000Z	Seer7		is it just me.. is it true that in the past 6 or so times i have tried to get help in IRC.. that its the default for some one to just say.. Go read up? there are always many in here.. and rarely any who will do more than just say.. GO FIND It yourself..?
2009-05-26T23:42:00.000Z	Seer7		i am trying to get some one to actually look into what i am saying.. should i just assume this is really NOT the place for me to get help if i step into some thing out of my ability?
2009-05-26T23:42:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	Its particularly not busy today, you just need to be patient.  Persue the other support methods if you want.
2009-05-26T23:44:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	Yes. Many people find support in here.  Your problem seems to be quite odd.  In fact, you're pretty lucky that most of your sounds are working.
2009-05-26T23:49:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	Can you play any ogg files anywhere?
2009-05-26T23:52:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	do you have libogg0 installed?
2009-05-26T23:53:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	try: sudo apt-get install libogg0
2009-05-26T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	If its not installed, it will install it, otherwise it will say its already installed.
2009-05-26T23:56:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	Can you open /usr/share/example-content/Ubuntu_Free_Culture_Showcase/Invocation.ogg and play it?  I'm just looking for another ogg file that might be on your computer to play.
2009-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	Open totem and put that filepath in the open dialog?
2009-05-27T00:51:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	I'm actually here, but thinking.  I'm thinking that the pulseaudio userspace daemon isn't starting up fast enough for you to hear the login sounds.  Why they sound like static when you actually play them is very odd, especially because you can play a normal ogg just fine.
2009-05-27T00:53:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	I remember seeing something about getting pulseaudio to startup before gnome started to do its thing, but I thought that was fixed before Jaunty's release.
2009-05-27T00:54:00.000Z	Pici	Seer7	I'm not too great at troubleshooting audio either.  I wonder if theres something that you can modify in System>Preferences>Sessions (or is it called Startup now?) to make pulseaudio start before other stuff.  I don't have a graphical system in front of me that I can test with, sorry.
