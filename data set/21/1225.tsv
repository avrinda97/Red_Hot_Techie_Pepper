2010-12-21T01:48:00.000Z	ltgg		anyone else completely FRUSTRATED with WIFI connect problems in ubuntu 10.10? router 10 feet away, WIn7 connects no problem, ubuntu sees router with good signal,  wtf is going on??!!
2010-12-21T01:50:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	no problems here.  what security has your wifi got
2010-12-21T01:57:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	 WPA2 TKIP
2010-12-21T01:59:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	using Trendnet TEW632 running DD-WRT
2010-12-21T02:00:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	 connected wireless in the past with this adapter running 10.04 ... now it just will not connect
2010-12-21T02:00:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	could try wicd
2010-12-21T02:00:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	 wicd??
2010-12-21T02:01:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	like network manager, but different...
2010-12-21T02:02:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	 am installing wicd now
2010-12-21T02:03:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	did you test with no encryption? not the best plan in the world I know but it would narrow it down
2010-12-21T02:15:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	wicd also failed to connect, weirdly giving 'bad password' error    password is correct ... have a Win7 laptop sitting next to me happily connected at 54MPS 100% signal strength
2010-12-21T02:17:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	sounds like maybe its trying to use the wrong wpa protocol... should be AES instead of tkip or vice versa.
2010-12-21T02:18:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	try changing the encryption to WPA1...
2010-12-21T02:18:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	on your router also obviously.
2010-12-21T02:19:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	 no it is TKIP ,,, what is difference between WPA passphrase and pre-shared key in wicd?  which to choose?
2010-12-21T02:20:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	are you sure its trying to connect using tkip tho?   mabye the driver has a bug also...  so try different encryption, and/or try setting up an 'interfaces' file .
2010-12-21T02:25:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	I can give you a hand setting up /etc/network/interfaces where you can specify in more detail the options to connect...might work.
2010-12-21T02:25:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	 sure that would be great
2010-12-21T02:25:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	pm
2010-12-21T02:26:00.000Z	ltgg	mongy	pm?
2010-12-21T02:27:00.000Z	mongy	ltgg	I messaged you......
