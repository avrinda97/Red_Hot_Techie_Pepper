2005-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	alterim		can someone please tell me how to play xvids on ubuntu?
2005-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	alterim		the simplest, quickest way please
2005-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	alterim		?
2005-04-20T10:32:00.000Z	alterim		seems to be a few options but not one defacto one
2005-04-20T10:32:00.000Z	delire	alterim	you are using the non-free Marillat package repository?
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z	delire	alterim	tell us the problem more specifically.
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z	alterim	delire	yes
2005-04-20T10:34:00.000Z	delire	alterim	what is the /*output of the error8/
2005-04-20T10:34:00.000Z	delire	alterim	you however, are not.
2005-04-20T10:35:00.000Z	delire	alterim	the error will assist diagnosis.
2005-04-20T10:41:00.000Z	delire	alterim	mount, will give you a list of all mounted fs's 'mount -a' will attempt to mount everything in /etc/fstab
2005-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	delire	alterim	ok, 'dpkg -l | grep xvid'
2005-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	alterim	delire	what's that about?
2005-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	delire	alterim	it will tell you whether you have xvid gear on board
2005-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	delire	alterim	the 'ii' means installed
2005-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	alterim	delire	that hasn't done anything
2005-04-20T10:45:00.000Z	delire	alterim	then, my suspcion that you didn't have the XVid codecs installed, has just been proven correct
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	delire	alterim	'apt-cache search' xvid and then choose the package to install.
2005-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	delire	alterim	do you have a  /usr/lib/libxvidcore.so.*
2005-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	delire	alterim	browse for it using a 'file browser' or using the UNIX program 'ls'
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	delire	alterim	when you install Windows, does it install all the Codecs for you too??
