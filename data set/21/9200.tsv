2005-10-24T10:47:00.000Z	printf		i take it ubuntu and wireless are about as easy as any other dist and wireless
2005-10-24T10:47:00.000Z	stephen_	printf	Actually, wireless under ubuntu is pretty painless
2005-10-24T10:48:00.000Z	stephen_		i have a crappy mini-pci Ralink card in one of my computers, and even that works flawlessly.
2005-10-24T10:48:00.000Z	stephen_		Yeah, broken_ladder, that was where I looked immediately
2005-10-24T10:48:00.000Z	stephen_		I've toyed with my theme config file.
2005-10-24T10:48:00.000Z	printf	stephen_	then why can i see my access point SSID but when i try to connect it just scrolls and will not connect?
2005-10-24T10:48:00.000Z	stephen_	printf	open a console and type iwconfig
2005-10-24T10:49:00.000Z	stephen_		what does it say?
2005-10-24T10:49:00.000Z	printf		the box is powered down as of now..been messing with it all day...in WIn now
2005-10-24T10:49:00.000Z	stephen_		Disc: Ubuntu can use either.
2005-10-24T10:50:00.000Z	printf	stephen_	what are some things to try when i get back into ubuntu?
2005-10-24T10:50:00.000Z	stephen_	printf	Try setting all the options manually with iwconfig
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	stephen_		use lsmod to check that your wireless cards module is detected properly
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	stephen_		My card has a little glitch where you actually have to deactivate and reactivate the card every time I reboot to get it to work.  I 'm sure I could automate a script to do that, but, too lazy
2005-10-24T10:52:00.000Z	printf	stephen_	i'll try that stuff thanks...its been a headache, i can see all 3 of my access points but cannot connect to them
2005-10-24T10:53:00.000Z	stephen_		What brand of card is it?
2005-10-24T10:53:00.000Z	stephen_		And is this a laptop you're talking about?
2005-10-24T10:53:00.000Z	printf	stephen_	its a mini pci card in a emachine laptop (not sure of brand of card)
2005-10-24T10:53:00.000Z	stephen_		Eesh. You might wanna look for a custom driver.
2005-10-24T10:54:00.000Z	stephen_		It might be the same ralink mini-pci card I have
2005-10-24T10:55:00.000Z	printf	stephen_	so i may still see the access points and signal strength even though my card may not be properly installed?
