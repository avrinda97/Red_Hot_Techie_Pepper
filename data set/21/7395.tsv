2008-05-22T02:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	atlef	<Chillance> anyone here know a way to boot ubuntu from a real partition within Windows?    Was his question.. Your soultion does not involve Ubuntu or its' own partition.  vmware would be closer that your option
2008-05-22T02:21:00.000Z	atlef	Jack_Sparrow	 but it is as close as he will get for now. of course if he reads alot, vmware has this availble
