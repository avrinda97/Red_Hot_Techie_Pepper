2007-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	Si|ent		and now facing a HUGE problem with GAIM
2007-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	Si|ent		with no apparent reason
2007-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	liquiddoom	Si|ent	I had that happen too before I went to feisty... mainly when using MSN
2007-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	Si|ent	liquiddoom	and it got resolved?
2007-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	liquiddoom	Si|ent	It seems like it.
2007-04-26T13:51:00.000Z	Si|ent	liquiddoom	seems i might go for an upgrade then
2007-04-26T13:51:00.000Z	liquiddoom	Si|ent	Don't let that be the only reason to go to feisty though... you might want to try compiling the newest source or finding a newer .deb
2007-04-26T13:52:00.000Z	Si|ent	liquiddoom	thts wht im gonna try.. ill b trying AMSN for a few days if it works ill stick to where i am
2007-04-26T13:52:00.000Z	liquiddoom	Si|ent	Okay. I'll try to find a link now
2007-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	Si|ent	liquiddoom	:)
2007-04-26T13:56:00.000Z	liquiddoom	Si|ent	That repo has the newest version of GAIM, beta6 (the one I use)
2007-04-26T13:58:00.000Z	Si|ent	liquiddoom	found it thank you :)
2007-04-26T13:59:00.000Z	liquiddoom	Si|ent	Awesome. If you get authentication errors, wget http://repository.debuntu.org/GPG-Key-chantra.txt && sudo apt-key add GPG-Key-chantra.txt
