2012-05-23T07:16:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	i think Confused2012 means "what happened to gnome"
2012-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	  at this time any guess is possible. ;)
2012-05-26T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 not for fstab :)
2012-05-26T18:42:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	and it has to be octal. thats annoying. although not as annoying as file/foldername with spaces in it
2012-05-26T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 yep. I have to look this up about once a month. :)
2012-05-26T19:04:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	i used to throw my old drives into a blackhole but apparently even that isnt secure enough
2012-05-26T19:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 install AOL on them.. it will scare away anyone.
2012-05-26T20:33:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	nosplash doesnt do diddly to stop plymouth on any of my systems. il try nofb
2012-05-26T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 i was thinking its been changed in 12.04 but i havent trried it lately
2012-05-26T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 used tobe i always used 'nosplash nofb verbose text'
2012-05-26T20:34:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	im not on 12.04 yet
2012-05-26T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 no idea then.  used to work. perhaps its the combo of the options
2012-05-26T20:35:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	i use nosplash noplymouth and it doesn't work. i know i dont want text because i want the dm to come up. im just worried about nofb. i do want a framebuffer i just dont want plymouth to use it
2012-05-26T20:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 ive never heard of the noplymouth option
2012-05-26T20:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	escott	 as far as i know - plymouth is not using the framebuffer. just the console is.. which i normally dont want
2012-05-26T20:36:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	i saw it on a website next to the "pleasefortheloveofgoddontstartplymouth" option
2012-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	qak, (poetterings blog is a good source) it is now a requirement for fedora/systemd, but its being driven by usage and having /var be a proper fs mountpoint with well defined semantics
2012-06-07T07:30:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	i think the main concern is simultaneous access from host and guest
2012-06-12T08:35:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	DB server
2012-06-13T07:06:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	thats blacklisting the nouveau module in its entirety. not just saying "kernel don't do modesetting"
2012-06-13T07:06:00.000Z	escott	Dr_Willis	you can still have nouveau with nomodeset in which case X does its own probing and modesetting
