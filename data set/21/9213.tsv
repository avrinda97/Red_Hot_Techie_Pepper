2008-06-01T01:20:00.000Z	axisys		why does ubuntu force me to install exim when I am trying to install mailx?
2008-06-01T01:20:00.000Z	axisys		is there a way around?
2008-06-01T01:20:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	i think it just wants an smtp daemon. try installing postfix or something, if you just don't like exim
2008-06-01T01:21:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	ace_suares so that will give me mailx ?
2008-06-01T01:21:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	no, it (should) satisfy one of the requirements of mailx, so that exim doesn't have to be installed
2008-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	posfix is just a different MTA
2008-06-01T01:23:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	MTA stands for "mail transfer agent". you DO need an MTA to send mail. :P
2008-06-01T01:23:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	^^
2008-06-01T01:23:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	then you are acting as the MTA
2008-06-01T01:23:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	yes.. and mailutils can do that?
2008-06-01T01:23:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	i dunno. mailx isn't the only way to send email from the command line
2008-06-01T01:24:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	i wrote one in python in about an hour a couple of months ago
2008-06-01T01:24:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	ofcourse not.. but pretty light and i had been using it..
2008-06-01T01:24:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	let it install exim. who cares?
2008-06-01T01:25:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	hmm i would rather use a python or perl if that does not require any postfix or exim libs
2008-06-01T01:25:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	it doesn't.  exim is probably smaller than python, though.  :P
2008-06-01T01:26:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	but i already have python
2008-06-01T01:28:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	exim and dependcies looks to be under a meg. python2.5 is 10MB by itself, and has other dependencies (just not exim)
2008-06-01T01:28:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	you already have python, though. *shrug*
2008-06-01T01:29:00.000Z	MFen	axisys	i usually pick internet site, i don't think it matters that much
2008-06-01T01:30:00.000Z	axisys	MFen	hmm nullmailer looks super small http://untroubled.org/nullmailer/
