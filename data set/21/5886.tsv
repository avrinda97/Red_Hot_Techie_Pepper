2007-08-15T13:12:00.000Z	sauvin		Is the "auto update" an automatic thing with ubuntu?
2007-08-15T13:13:00.000Z	sauvin		I misspoke. Is the "automatic update" thing the default behaviour for ubuntu feisty?
2007-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	it asks on the desktop for permission
2007-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	sauvin		It's never asked me any such thing, and I've been using ubuntu now for at least a couple of weeks.
2007-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	Rubin		hmm
2007-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	Rubin		you run ubuntu or one of the variants like xubuntu?
2007-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	sauvin		I don't WANT automatic updates because I fear they might break things.
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	sauvin	Rubin	what I have installed is stock ubuntu, running kde instead of gnome.
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	they only change things for security updates and bug fixes. they dont install new features
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	so thats why. update-manage runs as a gnome applet
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	but you can run it by hand
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	sauvin		Ah.
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	sauvin		If I CHOOSE to. This is a Good Thing (tm)
2007-08-15T13:16:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	even in gnome, it just asks if you want to
2007-08-15T13:16:00.000Z	sauvin		I've had some less-than-amusing experiences with yum updates in Fedora Core, and have since come to view such updating processes with a bit of suspicion.
2007-08-15T13:16:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	thats healthy. but one of the best things about ubuntu is apt
2007-08-15T13:17:00.000Z	sauvin		apt, yum, they're both good, IMO.
2007-08-15T13:17:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	not the tool apt, but the ubuntu package system as a whole. the way there are stable and testing repositories etc
2007-08-15T13:17:00.000Z	sauvin		Fedora Core isn't excactly bleeding edge.
2007-08-15T13:18:00.000Z	sauvin		I've been sticking to the official repos hoping that what somedrew said is very operative. So far, I've had zero trouble.
2007-08-15T13:18:00.000Z	Rubin	sauvin	thats a good idea too
