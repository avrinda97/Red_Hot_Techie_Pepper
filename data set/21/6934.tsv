2007-01-02T06:34:00.000Z	tim167		i'm trying to simply print a small photo, it's driving me NUTS! can someone help me get printer settings right ? thanks
2007-01-02T06:36:00.000Z	tim167		i need the photo to be printed small, i can only det it to print small when i print from Gimp, but there are no settings for the print quality, it automatically prints in draft quality, i can find these settings nowhere (HP PSC1510)
2007-01-02T06:37:00.000Z	tim167		if I print the photo from the default picture viewer in ubuntu it prints the photo on a full page, which also isnt what I need
2007-01-02T06:37:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	maybe use gimp to scale the picture down to lower resolution?
2007-01-02T06:38:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	i did try to set 'print size' in Gimp and save the pic, but it still prints pull page
2007-01-02T06:39:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	i'll try to downscale the picture itself, but still i need to set the printer to print at highest quality, not draft, because there are horizontal lines in the photo like this
2007-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	ya, figure out the resolution of the printer, and then change the number of pixels in the photo to be the right amount
2007-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	if you set the dpi for what the printer has, then you can resize the photo using the size rulers in gimp
2007-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	if it knows the dpi then you can size it by inches or whatever
2007-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	yes I can figure that out i guess, but i also need to set the printer to highest quality (slowest) printing, and i dont find any setting for that in Gimp nor in imageviewer
2007-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	are you using gnome?
2007-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	: yes
2007-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	maybe try gnome-cups-manager or something
2007-01-02T06:43:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	System -> Printing or something
2007-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	gnome-cups-manager looks like  what i need, but no quality selections at first sight...
2007-01-02T06:45:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	oops, yes its there thanks...now I'm getting somewhere
2007-01-02T06:46:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	so if i make settings in this cups-manager, will every program that wants to print use these settings ?
2007-01-02T06:46:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	i think so.  cups is the printer management system that sends things to the printer
2007-01-02T06:47:00.000Z	doviende	tim167	so everything should go through that i thnk
2007-01-02T06:47:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	trying now, i'll let you know ... :p
2007-01-02T06:49:00.000Z	tim167	doviende	finally, it worked, thanks!!
