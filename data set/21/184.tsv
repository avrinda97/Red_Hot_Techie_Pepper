2012-09-27T15:16:00.000Z	decci_		Hi Guys
2012-09-27T15:16:00.000Z	decci_		I have Dell R620 machine with H710 PERC card. Its not working for Ubuntu 10.04 but working on 12.04.1
2012-09-27T15:17:00.000Z	decci_		Can I do some backporting the driver to Ubuntu 10.04
2012-09-27T15:17:00.000Z	decci_		Any idea? How can I make it work for Ubuntu 10.04
2012-09-27T15:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	why not just stick with 12.04?
2012-09-27T15:17:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	I am some application working and I dont want to upgrade
2012-09-27T15:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	you'll need to in six months anyway
2012-09-27T15:19:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	Please understand my manager is sticking to the point that he needs this combination only
2012-09-27T15:19:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	Is it possible in anyway to get it work?
2012-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	you could backport it
2012-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	grab the source package and see if it works
2012-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	Can you help me where shall I find the source code?
2012-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	if you need to ask that, you'll struggle with backporting
2012-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	A resource or link could be helpful..though I know kernel compilation :)
2012-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	have a look at the page for the package in Precise
2012-09-27T15:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	you might be lucky and it'll more-or-less just work
2012-09-27T15:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	make it clear to your manager that *now* is the time to start looking at updating to 12.04
2012-09-27T15:23:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	I found this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
2012-09-27T15:24:00.000Z	decci_	gordonjcp	Found this too http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=666108
2012-09-27T15:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	have a shot at compiling it, like I said, and see what horrible disastrous fireball and wreckage you end up with
2012-09-27T15:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	decci_	if it works perfectly, great; if you get errors, well that's less great but you know where to look
