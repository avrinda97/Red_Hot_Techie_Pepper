2009-12-21T06:29:00.000Z	tbrock_		hey guys, i was wondering if you might be able to help me with a xbmc-live question, it's based on ubuntu
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock_		although now when it boots it drops to console
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock_		i boot off the usb stick, works grea
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock_		great*
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	a	tbrock_	what is you prob ?
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock_		however, i installed it, ran apt-get update/upgrade and installed nvidia drivers, now xbmc only starts when i type startx
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock_		it use to start automatically
2009-12-21T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock_		now it just has a black screen or console
2009-12-21T06:31:00.000Z	tbrock_		any ideas?
2009-12-21T06:31:00.000Z	tbrock_		no booting works
2009-12-21T06:31:00.000Z	tbrock_		everything is fine
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	tbrock_		except for the fact that xbmc won't start on boot
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	tbrock_		i can't figure out why
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	a	tbrock_	you xorg server is broken
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	tbrock_		i would think so
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	tbrock_		but it works when i login and type start x
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	tbrock_		ok
2009-12-21T06:32:00.000Z	tbrock_		is it possible that the x server that gets started on boot is different than the one that starts when i type startx
2009-12-21T06:33:00.000Z	tbrock_		?
2009-12-21T06:33:00.000Z	a	tbrock_	recover a xorg conf backup ?
2009-12-21T06:33:00.000Z	tbrock_	a	dod that
