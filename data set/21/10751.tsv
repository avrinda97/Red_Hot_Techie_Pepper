2004-11-24T12:26:00.000Z	johnnybezak		lol
2004-11-24T12:26:00.000Z	johnnybezak		too much time in terminal
2004-11-24T07:58:00.000Z	johnnybezak		how many of you guys use the spatial nautilus?
2004-11-24T07:59:00.000Z	johnnybezak		hehe
2004-11-24T07:59:00.000Z	johnnybezak		is there a way to open new window inside the old window? on mac os 9 where i suppose the finder was "spatial" you could option click and it would open inside the old window, can you do this with nautilus?
2004-11-24T08:00:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	I didn't even use a graphical filemanager until s0patial nautilus
2004-11-24T08:00:00.000Z	johnnybezak	JanneM	yeah its nice and basic, ive only used kde up till now but gnome is pretty nice: simple and effective
2004-11-24T08:00:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	nope. Sort of contradicts the point of spatial nautilus. Depending on why you want that, however, there are ways to solve it
2004-11-24T08:01:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	either do an open that will close the previous window, use ctrl-shift-w to close all but the focused window
2004-11-24T08:02:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	or, if it's the same couple of windows every time, just move the new one on top of the old one
2004-11-24T08:02:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	I just do the ctrl-shift-w now and again, when it gets too cluttered
2004-11-24T08:02:00.000Z	johnnybezak	JanneM	yeah i use flux as my WM so i just tab them
2004-11-24T08:06:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	yes - I have a couple too
2004-11-24T08:07:00.000Z	johnnybezak	JanneM	i only did it on my one house mates comp, but it scared him too much hehe (i was sick of fixing windows for him :P)
2004-11-24T08:24:00.000Z	johnnybezak	JanneM	yeah but you have to read way more crap
2004-11-24T08:30:00.000Z	johnnybezak	JanneM	will it break ubuntu on me?
2004-11-24T08:36:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	in my experience, Marillat's repo works fine with ubuntu
2004-11-24T08:44:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	when I got mplayer, I had Marillat's repo and universe in my repo list.
2004-11-24T09:02:00.000Z	JanneM	johnnybezak	you really sure you'd want to install anything from a source named "Honk"? :)
2004-11-24T09:05:00.000Z	johnnybezak	JanneM	haha yeah not particurlarly, but its linked off the chrisitan marrillat site, and i would certainly like mplayer
