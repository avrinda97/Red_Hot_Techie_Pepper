2006-07-16T07:15:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	nice utility :)
2006-07-16T07:16:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	do you know lavaps?
2006-07-16T07:17:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	no, should i?
2006-07-16T07:18:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	it's an older program with the same idea, a bit more complex and a windowed, resizable application (rather than an applet)
2006-07-16T07:18:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	how do i add something to the right of the default seperator
2006-07-16T07:19:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	right click, unlock if locked, right click, move
2006-07-16T07:19:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	its not locked, and cant be moved
2006-07-16T07:19:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	then other locked applets prevent it from being moved
2006-07-16T07:20:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	they dont appear to be locked, i am talking about the seperator next to the battery monitor, network monitor and sound options
2006-07-16T07:21:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	I think what you're looking at is the Notification Area
2006-07-16T07:21:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	yeah
2006-07-16T07:21:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	i cannot add something to there?
2006-07-16T07:22:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	no, the Notif.Area is for programs that need to notify you of something, such as the update notifier.
2006-07-16T07:25:00.000Z	soundray	UltraMagnus	the Notif.Area is for programs that need to notify you of something, such as the update notifier. Not for you to put anything inside it.
2006-07-16T07:26:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	you can, i just unlocked the seperator and it worked...... diddent realise that tick next to lock to panel meant it was locked to panel, i thought it meant it would lock it to panel
2006-07-16T07:26:00.000Z	UltraMagnus	soundray	thanks for the help anyway
