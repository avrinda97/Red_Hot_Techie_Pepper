2009-12-27T04:59:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	once i have them there's no software to use em with, so I'll pass
2009-12-27T04:51:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	not sure about "unix based" but there's gpsdrive and a couple of others you can use in ubuntu
2009-12-27T04:51:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	gpsdrive can use maps from different sources.. openstreetmap or similar and others
2009-12-27T04:54:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	ah, but I thought gpsdrive just gave you an arrow (eg the azimuth of where you're supposed to be going) instead of "turn left in 300m" type navigation
2009-12-27T04:54:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	I guess you could sort-of do that by asking Google maps and then extracting the data as a gpx file?
2009-12-27T04:55:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	ahh.. that's true... it only uses the map as a background.. it can't tell roads from fields/sea and such.. those maps cost money.. lots of money
2009-12-27T04:55:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	yeah, I know
2009-12-27T04:55:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	unfortunately tomtom doesn't hand out their software yet
2009-12-27T04:56:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	which is stupid since the tomtom one/go navigation things are just linux boxes
2009-12-27T04:56:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	not sure if they will do something when/if openstreetmap takes off.. but that's still pretty unfinished
2009-12-27T04:56:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	well.. if that software were available to everyone we wouldn't be buying tomtom-boxes, now would we? =)
2009-12-27T04:56:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	who cares about the software
2009-12-27T04:56:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	the maps is where the money is
2009-12-27T04:57:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	you get the software for free now too, there's no way there's only 60 euros worth of hardware in those things
2009-12-27T04:57:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	yes.. change software to software/maps
2009-12-27T04:57:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	i have no problem with paying for maps
2009-12-27T04:57:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	they cost money to make, it's only fair to pay back their R&D costs
2009-12-27T04:59:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	there are maps you can buy.. at least in sweden there are some from the swedish institude responsible for measuring the county.. but those cost up to 1000 USD.. that's a bit steep imho
2009-12-27T05:12:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	I started browsing through the openstreetmap site.. it seems there are some software available.. here's one http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Traveling_Salesman
2009-12-27T05:12:00.000Z	Slart	lvh	http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing/OfflineRouters
2009-12-27T05:12:00.000Z	lvh	Slart	awesome, thanks, I'll start reading now
