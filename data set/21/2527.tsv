2009-09-16T03:13:00.000Z	JustinA		Hello everyone!
2009-09-16T03:14:00.000Z	JustinA		Need a little help; I have a Mac with the Ubuntu 9.04 ISO downloaded, and I need to stick it on a USB drive so I can install it on a optical-free computer
2009-09-16T03:16:00.000Z	JustinA		I know I could use all kind of helpful utilites to make a live-USB thing from in linux
2009-09-16T03:16:00.000Z	JustinA		but how do i get the installation CD on a bootable flash drive?
2009-09-16T03:17:00.000Z	JustinA		unetbootin is only for linux and windows, i'm on a Mac
2009-09-16T03:18:00.000Z	JustinA		but Mac's terminal has the dd commmand
2009-09-16T03:18:00.000Z	JustinA		is it possible with that?
2009-09-16T03:18:00.000Z	DasEi	JustinA	no, that won't boot, you gotta find a mac user or even run a ubuntu vm in mac, usbcreator is very convienant
2009-09-16T03:20:00.000Z	DasEi	JustinA	or try to boot alternate installer, be CAREFULL and install to usb, carefull as not to overwrite internal disk
2009-09-16T03:20:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	lol, I've made that mistake before... I'm very careful...   but what's the alternate installer?
2009-09-16T03:21:00.000Z	DasEi	JustinA	saw !alternate above ?
2009-09-16T03:23:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	yeah, looking up the alternate
2009-09-16T03:24:00.000Z	DasEi	JustinA	next to the textinstaller, you can also choose expertmode in where special install options, like grub on usb etc. can be taken
2009-09-16T03:26:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	So once I successfully get the live-CD booting from the USB drive, how do I install from the USB Drive to the hard drive?
2009-09-16T03:27:00.000Z	DasEi	JustinA	?? you want to install to the harddrive ?? not to the usb ?
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	- Yes, I have a new nettop with a HD, but no CD drive, so I just want to get the installer on the USB so I can install to the HD
2009-09-16T03:35:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	- No, just a virgin 500GB hard drive... trying to get the install ready on my Hackintosh; I just finished burning the Ubuntu 9.04 CD
2009-09-16T03:36:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	- Guess I try booting it on my hackintosh, and see if I can follow the steps to create a bootable stick from in there
2009-09-16T03:37:00.000Z	DasEi	JustinA	hm, as we started now, you'll get a installation on usb, but no installer medium...
2009-09-16T03:38:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	- The nettop (zotac ion/ dualcore atom) will boot USB okay
2009-09-16T03:40:00.000Z	JustinA	DasEi	Okay, thanks for your help... I'll be back later if that doesn't work...
