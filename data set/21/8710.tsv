2006-03-05T12:53:00.000Z	l00p		anyone has any idea on installing ubuntu on free space on a sata disk (without losing all data)?
2006-03-05T12:55:00.000Z	l00p		I have but it doesn't show me any existing partitions
2006-03-05T12:56:00.000Z	l00p		bit: I see the drive... just that there are no partitions on it
2006-03-05T12:57:00.000Z	l00p		I have it formatted an windows running on ntfs partition I also have free space for linux partition... but the installer doesn't recognize the partitions
2006-03-05T12:57:00.000Z	l00p		well AFAIK it is not in raid but the motherboard does have raid support
2006-03-05T12:58:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	Did you choose 'dynamic partitions' in Win?
2006-03-05T12:58:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	not that I know... what's that?
2006-03-05T12:59:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	the screwd up Win-version of lvm... if you have this dynamic partition thingy enabled, there's no readable partition table on the drive... win does it's own thing and hides everything
2006-03-05T13:00:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	how do I check to see if I have one?
2006-03-05T13:01:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	you have to be in Win(XP|2000) and look in the disk-administration control-applet. (Where the drive letters ...brrr.... are defined)
2006-03-05T13:04:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	I'm in... now where do I check for dynamic partitions? do you know or should I just look until I find it
2006-03-05T13:06:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	Please do not ask me to explain windows... somewhere in the admin-tools section there's a disk and partition info utility... cal Bill Gates for support
2006-03-05T13:07:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	I can't find that dynamic yadayada..... but It is funny becouse if I boot with Mandriva disks I see the partitions....
2006-03-05T13:08:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	ok, then ... it's not enabled, because if mandriva can see it, ubuntu will too, sooner or later
2006-03-05T13:08:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	what is not enabled?
2006-03-05T13:10:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	dynamic disks in windows is obviously not enabled. Do you have a Linux Live-CD you can boot? the output of 'fdisk -l' would be interesting
2006-03-05T13:11:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	i have liveCD
2006-03-05T13:28:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	the fdisk -l does not say any thing
2006-03-05T13:29:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	did u 'sudo fdisk -l' ?
2006-03-05T13:29:00.000Z	l00p	iBalo	I did it as root
2006-03-05T13:30:00.000Z	iBalo	l00p	hmm, and 'cat /proc/partitions' gives waht?
