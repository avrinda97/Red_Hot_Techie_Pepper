2005-07-03T06:03:00.000Z	Keito	karsten	oh, it can work like that?
2005-07-03T06:03:00.000Z	karsten	Keito	Yes.
2005-07-03T06:04:00.000Z	karsten	Keito	Once you're up and running though, burn yourself LNX-BBC or Knoppix.
2005-07-03T06:04:00.000Z	karsten	Keito	They're ass-savers.
2005-07-03T06:04:00.000Z	karsten	Keito	...that's sort of like Lifesavers, but different flavor.
2005-07-03T06:04:00.000Z	karsten	Keito	Boot.  Once the install starts, hit <alt><F2>
2005-07-03T06:04:00.000Z	karsten	Keito	...and you've got a shell.
2005-07-03T06:05:00.000Z	Keito	karsten	hahahaha, yeah, live cd's are nice
