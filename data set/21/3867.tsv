2008-10-09T02:46:00.000Z	Gin		something very wrong with my /home partition
2008-10-09T02:46:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	whats wrong?
2008-10-09T02:47:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	copying file form that partition I only get 4MB/s
2008-10-09T02:47:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	ah, sounds like a hardware problem.  Its ext3,, right?
2008-10-09T02:48:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	yes, don't think it is hardware problem. on the same hd transfering form / I get 40MB/s
2008-10-09T02:49:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	is it ext3?
2008-10-09T02:49:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	it is ext3
2008-10-09T02:49:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	mmmmmaybe it just the location on the platters?
2008-10-09T02:49:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	I had to delete files several times because I used that partition /home to 100%
2008-10-09T02:50:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	could that caused this slow transfer?
2008-10-09T02:53:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	I think I'm gonna format my /home drive
2008-10-09T02:53:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	well, if it is the cause, it would be like that from the beggining
2008-10-09T02:54:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	I only notive this slow transfer lately. before I didn't have to transfer big files. so it wasn't probably slow
2008-10-09T02:54:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	partitions on the outer parts of the harddrive have higher data throughputs than those toward the middle.  I think.  Unless the drive is variable speed...
2008-10-09T02:54:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	other than that, I've no idea
2008-10-09T02:55:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	yea, but not that slow. 4MB/s??
2008-10-09T03:06:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	I formatted my /home partition and I can copy about 500MB in a few seconds now! :-)
2008-10-09T03:07:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	crazy, so all it needed was a format.  Too bad you didnt try a fsck.  Maybe that would have fixed it
2008-10-09T03:08:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	I did try that
2008-10-09T03:08:00.000Z	Gin	danbh_intrepid	I am surprised  that fsck did not fixed it
2008-10-09T03:08:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Gin	yeah, that sucks
