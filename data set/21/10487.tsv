2005-03-26T12:54:00.000Z	cef		erm.. ok.. how do I shoot the gnome resolution changer in the head and tell it REAL resolutions to use instead of it's crappy (WRONG) defaults?
2005-03-26T12:55:00.000Z	cef		this is the problem though: the XF86Config-4 file is correct now. 1440 x 900
2005-03-26T12:56:00.000Z	cef		gnome however, keeps setting the screen resolution to 1400x1050
2005-03-26T12:56:00.000Z	cef		so I miss the bottom 150 lines, which, just so happens to be the login screen options
2005-03-26T12:57:00.000Z	cef		Computer->System Config->Screen Resolution does not show the right resolution
2005-03-26T12:58:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	cef	if that doesn't show the right ones then you need to finish editing your config-4 file.
2005-03-26T12:58:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	howso?
2005-03-26T12:59:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	cef	if your refresh rates aren't correct and all the differnt res. aren't put in for all the different modes then you will run into problems.
2005-03-26T12:59:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	dpkg-reconfigure doesn't give you a chance to edit that value (just a pick list), and I can't see the value the screen resolution stuff is storing anywhere in the xfree config
2005-03-26T13:00:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	hrm.. ok.. must be that it's not 60 Hz
2005-03-26T13:00:00.000Z	BiteMeBill		I seen you mention a 1400X950 or something res.  Are you running wide screen monitor?
2005-03-26T13:00:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	cef	 You may need to edit it by hand.
2005-03-26T13:01:00.000Z	cef		got it.. no modeline with that name.. will have to create one.. *sigh*
2005-03-26T13:01:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	cef	what kind of monitor do you have?
2005-03-26T13:02:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	Toshiba Satellite P20 laptop
2005-03-26T13:02:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	weird-ass 1440 x 900 display
2005-03-26T13:02:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	cef	Ok BRB I'm going to see what google digs up..  By chance are you dual booting?
2005-03-26T13:03:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	yup
2005-03-26T13:03:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	cef	have you ever done an aida32 report?
2005-03-26T13:03:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	if it annoys me, I'll just go bug daniels .. assuming he's at home today
2005-03-26T13:04:00.000Z	cef	BiteMeBill	nup.. any pointers?
