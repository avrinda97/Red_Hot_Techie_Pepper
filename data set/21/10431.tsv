2005-03-05T15:08:00.000Z	neighborlee		howdy again..just installed hoary and I went to install 'gftp' and its telling me: gftp depends on gftp-gtk 2.017+cvsblahblah and gftp-text which is not going to be installed ...I added the extra repositories so that surely isn't it...anyone seen this error with hoary ? ;-))
2005-03-05T15:08:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	you know that there is a built-in ftp-client in metacity/gnome?
2005-03-05T15:09:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	no I had no idea..whats it calle
2005-03-05T15:09:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	if its not gui based i'm not interested
2005-03-05T15:10:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	just open a folder and select "Connect to server.." from the File-menu.
2005-03-05T15:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	this isn't working well
2005-03-05T15:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	and what do you mean open a folder ????
2005-03-05T15:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	I need to connect to my host and download files that I need...
2005-03-05T15:13:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	do you have icons on your desktop?
2005-03-05T15:13:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	just open one of them
2005-03-05T15:14:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	you don't have a menu item in the "Files"-menu that says something like "Connect to server"?
2005-03-05T15:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	yes I'm well beyond that point
2005-03-05T15:15:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	well, ftp.blah.org ... is probably down...
2005-03-05T15:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	k I got it
2005-03-05T15:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	I wasn't seeing the ftp with login connect option is all
2005-03-05T15:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	got it thx
2005-03-05T15:16:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	good.
2005-03-05T15:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	gftp is faster to get up and going with but in a pinch this is ok
2005-03-05T15:18:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	anyway though..is my inability to install gftp via synaptic ( resulting apt-get error) due to simply using hoary atm ?
2005-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	Pelle_	neighborlee	I have no idea. is gftp a ubuntu-package from universe or main?
2005-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	neighborlee	Pelle_	not sure
