2009-07-14T23:47:00.000Z	Nan0fire		i have a problem with my hard disk. i did something wrong with Gparted and it has something to do with gpt/mbr partitioning tables (i think) and also with the ext4
2009-07-14T23:47:00.000Z	Nan0fire		anyone care to help?
2009-07-14T23:48:00.000Z	Nan0fire		i messed up somewhere along the way with gparted and the problem is that i can only see a PART of my drive, 30gbs, when my drive is 120 gbs
2009-07-14T23:49:00.000Z	Nan0fire		anyone has any idea ?
2009-07-14T23:50:00.000Z	devill	Nan0fire	what did u do exactly
2009-07-14T23:50:00.000Z	Nan0fire		i messed up my harddisk and now i can't see the whole disk, except in the livcd of jaunty
2009-07-14T23:51:00.000Z	Nan0fire		i don't know i did a couple of things many times
2009-07-14T23:51:00.000Z	Nan0fire	devill	i did have ext4 partitions and i erased them with parted magic
2009-07-14T23:52:00.000Z	devill	Nan0fire	parted magc? then?
2009-07-14T23:54:00.000Z	devill		Nan0fire:during live session are u able to see ur whole hdd?
2009-07-14T23:54:00.000Z	Nan0fire	devill	i saw only a part of my drive there, not the whole thing (i think because parted magic couldnt percieve the ext4) so i tried to do something new and used on the part i could see the gpt partitioning table
2009-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	Nan0fire	devill	in the livecd sessions of jjaunty yes, in parted magic, i only see what i see in windows (half of my disk!)
2009-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	Nan0fire		do you understand the prob or should i tell more?
2009-07-14T23:57:00.000Z	Nan0fire	devill	any ideas?
2009-07-14T23:57:00.000Z	devill	Nan0fire	use fdisk ..
2009-07-14T23:57:00.000Z	Nan0fire		i tried already
2009-07-14T23:57:00.000Z	devill	Nan0fire	what do u see
2009-07-14T23:58:00.000Z	Nan0fire		i see all i guess.. i deleted all partitions with it, and i made a new ntfs with it ( with help of an irc buddy)
2009-07-14T23:58:00.000Z	devill		Nan0fire:u can recover the partition table ..if it hasnt lost already...
2009-07-15T00:00:00.000Z	Nan0fire	devill	i erased, repartition-tabled, partitoined everyting a couple of times so i don't think there's a way back :S
2009-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	Nan0fire	devill	no
