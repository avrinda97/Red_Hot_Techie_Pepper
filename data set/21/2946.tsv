2009-06-17T19:10:00.000Z	MaT-dg		can I enable line numbers in gedit?
2009-06-17T19:11:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	yeah, under the view menu
2009-06-30T17:04:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	it seems that the code has an error, report it upstream (to the code's developer)
2009-06-30T17:05:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	possibly you have the wrong version of some header files (and libraries)
2009-06-30T17:11:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	can you pastebin gpsctl.c?
2009-06-30T17:12:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	in prismstumbler/src/deamon/
2009-06-30T17:14:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	gpsctl.c > http://pastebin.com/d2f5c5dbb
2009-06-30T17:19:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	It isn't lying to you, there is no data member called newdata, I'd get in touch with the package developer and ask them (they may be using a different version of the library where this is valid code)
2009-06-30T17:22:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	right now?
2009-06-30T17:25:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	whenever you can be bothered, the site's not very accessible though
2009-06-30T17:25:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	but how will you let me know? I'm not on this channel 24/7
2009-06-30T17:26:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	I meant you get in touch with them
2009-06-30T17:27:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	ah ok, so they is a change they fixe the code in a few days?
2009-06-30T17:28:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	they'll either release a change or help you sort your install
2009-06-30T17:28:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	or bluntly ignore you... they're only human
2009-06-30T17:31:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	ok thanks, now the code on pastebin lasts only 1 day... is that a problem?
2009-06-30T17:32:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	nah, why would it?
2009-06-30T17:32:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	dunno, maybe u give a link to it to the devs...
2009-06-30T17:33:00.000Z	MaT-dg	boss_mc	I'm not familiar with reporting problems ;)
2009-06-30T17:33:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	I havn't given them anything, you just send them an e-mail, explaining your problem, attach the output of make and ask for a fix/advice
2009-06-30T17:33:00.000Z	boss_mc	MaT-dg	it's very simple
