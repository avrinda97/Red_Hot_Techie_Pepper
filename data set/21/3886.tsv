2008-10-01T21:04:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	can you put the error output on nopaste?
2008-10-01T21:07:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	Here are the errors messages from fusion-icon and firefox-3.0  both are similar.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/52890/
2008-10-01T21:08:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	check the date of /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2 ....is it correct....you told that you just reinstalled the libs....take care if its a symlink
2008-10-01T21:09:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	2008-10-01 11:32 libcairo.so.2 -> libcairo.so.2.17     and     2008-06-04 11:45 libcairo.so.2.17.3
2008-10-01T21:11:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	so it looks like you have different versions on your system.....get rid of the old versions to make sure your software is using the new ones
2008-10-01T21:12:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	sorry I guess my paste missed the .3 at the end, there is only one version
2008-10-01T21:12:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	ok
2008-10-01T21:15:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	ok, the error still occurs
2008-10-01T21:17:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	ok...run ldconfig ...maybe it gives an error....retry afterwards
2008-10-01T21:18:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	ldconfig does nothing, just returns me to the prompt
2008-10-01T21:18:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	thats normal  behaviour
2008-10-01T21:19:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	ok, i see.  runnig it didnt fix the problem though :/
2008-10-01T21:21:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	i don't gave access to a box running ubuntu atm so i cannot check the binaries/libs
2008-10-01T21:21:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	but can you check what ldd $(which firefox) is telling you
2008-10-01T21:37:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	got the output for me? ;)
2008-10-01T21:40:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	ah sorry, I missed that you had asked for it, hold on.  I appreciate the help
2008-10-01T21:44:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	I think I did it right: http://paste.ubuntu.com/52900/
2008-10-01T21:46:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	wait i'll check
2008-10-01T21:48:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	hmm...no cairo linked there...or am i missing somewhat?
2008-10-01T21:48:00.000Z	beli	TJ-42	bbl
2008-10-01T21:49:00.000Z	TJ-42	beli	it didn't mention cairo there no, but it still has this problem
