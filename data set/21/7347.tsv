2007-02-23T10:12:00.000Z	skelter		hey - i rebooted after doing a patch (prompted by ubuntu) and now X won't start :( something about a mismatch of nvidia versions?
2007-02-23T10:12:00.000Z	skelter		i'm using the command line irc from a GUI-less shell :(
2007-02-23T10:12:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	you upgraded your kernel right?  you'll need to reinstall the nvidia driver probably.
2007-02-23T10:13:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	did you use envy to install the vid driver the first time?
2007-02-23T10:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	were you using the binary blob drivers (the ones straight from nvidia's website)?
2007-02-23T10:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	I would recommend grabbing envy, it'll take care of it for you
2007-02-23T10:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	yep.  do you have lynx or elinks (text based web browser) installed?
2007-02-23T10:16:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	hold a moment... let me just get you a wget line.  makes life easier :)
2007-02-23T10:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	wget http://albertomilone.com/ubuntu/nvidia/scripts/envy_0.8.2-0ubuntu1_all.deb
2007-02-23T10:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	nt :)
2007-02-23T10:23:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	http://albertomilone.com/ubuntu/nvidia/scripts/envy_0.8.2-0ubuntu1_all.deb
2007-02-23T10:25:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	you didn't have the http:// part, which is required for wget...
2007-02-23T10:25:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	I'll try just sending it to ya.  it's small.
2007-02-23T10:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	ahh, good point lol
2007-02-23T10:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	so much easier now!
2007-02-23T10:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	thousands of small korean children banging away on OLPCs to rewrite the drivers for you.  I love it!
2007-02-23T10:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	but will it be translated to english? O.o
2007-02-23T10:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	do you have a textual e-mail client per chance?  I could just e-mail you the .deb, it's all of 100k, and as I said, does EVERYTHING for you
2007-02-23T10:36:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	oh god... duh of the month... or you could boot your livecd, and just get it that way :)
2007-02-23T10:36:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	or, reboot right quick into the old kernel too!
2007-02-23T10:37:00.000Z	SilentDis	skelter	yeah.  just reboot, choose the old kernel, work normally, and pull that file, install.  reboot again, and run envy, and be perfectly set :)
