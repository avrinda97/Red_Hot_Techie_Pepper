2006-07-08T05:31:00.000Z	Sakunix		anyone have any ideas why I cant get a cd out of my cd rom drive?
2006-07-08T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	have you tried: right click > eject
2006-07-08T05:34:00.000Z	Sakunix	jrib	tried that nothing
2006-07-08T05:35:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	hmm don't know then, might want to just reboot
2006-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	nohup program, or just use screen
2006-08-15T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	screen is a program that lets you attach and detach sessions from terminals
2006-08-15T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	not sure if it is installed by default, but yeah it is in the repositories as 'screen'.  Basic usage for attaching and detaching:  to detach you can just close the terminal or hit ctrl-a d, to reattach just type 'screen -r'
2006-08-16T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	oops, taht was a typo, I mean: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost HOSTNAME
2006-08-16T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	don't you have a root account on the server?
2006-08-16T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	you should be able to type 'su -' and get root access
2006-08-16T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	Sakunix	well you can reboot and choose recovery mode from the grub menu, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't be able to su to root unless your password is actually incorrect
2006-08-16T16:19:00.000Z	Sakunix	jrib	kk will do
