2007-08-27T16:33:00.000Z	kenthomson		There's a problem with sound in Ubuntu 7.10. I hear no sound in any apps. No songs/music/movies anything. When i turn the volume at full and try to hear really hard i hear a slight hiss, I tried plugging my headphones directly into the sound card but still no sound. I have got onboard sound (and nothing fancy) and have never encountered this problem
2007-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	if all controls look good, try restarting alsa
2007-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	even did sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2007-08-27T16:35:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	still no solution, when alsa is stopped ths slight hiss goes off, again when it starts the hiss is resumed
2007-08-27T16:35:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	what does your /var/log/messages say when you start alsa?
2007-08-27T16:35:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	Slart: i will have to boot ubuntu for that, could you guys wait a minute and tell me again the commands when i restart?
2007-08-27T16:51:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	Slart: ?
2007-08-27T16:52:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	what text file did you require?
2007-08-27T16:52:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	curious as to the output created in logs from alsa start
2007-08-27T16:53:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	i am new, could you tell me the exact name/location of the file you require to see, please?
2007-08-27T16:53:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	np, it's /var/log/messages .. just a sec I'm going to play with ways to isolate alsa output
2007-08-27T16:56:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	Slart: About the sound proble, when ubuntu loads and the initial bar is 1/4 full the hiss starts and then it remains on forever (when x starts and when i am doing any work) and so no sound is played. Here is that file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35236/
2007-08-27T16:59:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	Slart: me either... checking...
2007-08-27T05:02:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	how long have you been running hiss-free?
2007-08-27T05:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	ages. like 1.5 years. I ran hiss-free in ubuntu 6.10 and in in 7.04 too. Just last week this hiss started. And simulataneously all sound stopped playing. Well, except the system beep
2007-08-27T05:03:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	have you tried reinstalling alsa?
2007-08-27T05:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	should i? I am sure i didn't mess with it. But how does one do that?
2007-08-27T05:03:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	something to the effect of "apt-get --remove alsa; apt-get --install alsa"
2007-08-27T05:04:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	i'll have to reboot ubuntu, do that, reboot to window and come in here again. As somehow xchat and gaim can't connect to freenode.net from ubuntu. It says "connection refused"
2007-08-27T05:12:00.000Z	elferson	kenthomson	Slart: agreed
2007-08-27T05:12:00.000Z	kenthomson	elferson	Slart: that would be welcome
