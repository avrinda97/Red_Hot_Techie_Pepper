2006-08-16T10:44:00.000Z	LJHarb		i have a question.,
2006-08-16T10:45:00.000Z	LJHarb		i just installed ubuntu server with lamp, and i can shell into it fine locally - and when the server is set to acquire an ip from the router with dhcp, and ive forwarded port 22, i can shell into the server remotely too
2006-08-16T10:45:00.000Z	LJHarb		but when i set the server to use a static ip from the router, i can only shell in locally
2006-08-16T10:45:00.000Z	LJHarb		theres a free prog you can download havaack
2006-08-16T10:46:00.000Z	LJHarb		ami, what nvidia problem?

2006-08-16T10:48:00.000Z	fluvvell	LJHarb	sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-08-16T10:48:00.000Z	LJHarb		thanks fluv, ill try that for my nvidia problem... still got the ssh problem tho
2006-08-16T10:48:00.000Z	LJHarb		fluv: says command not found.
2006-08-16T10:48:00.000Z	LJHarb		yes
2006-08-16T10:49:00.000Z	LJHarb	mneptok	and the router also forwards ports to other static ip'd computers and those work fine
2006-08-16T10:49:00.000Z	LJHarb		no, wrong pike - but i change the interfaces file when i change from dhcp to static
2006-08-16T10:49:00.000Z	LJHarb		i use 192.168.1.97 for static, and .101 or something for dhcp
2006-08-16T10:49:00.000Z	LJHarb		but i always change the forwarding to match.
2006-08-16T10:49:00.000Z	LJHarb		and i can ping to and from the machines too
2006-08-16T10:49:00.000Z	LJHarb		yes
