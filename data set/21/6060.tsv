2008-01-24T09:42:00.000Z	pajamian		ok, reinstalled compiz and a bunch of other compiz related stuff and still getting the same errors. :-(
2008-01-24T09:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	What video card?
2008-01-24T09:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	Someone will know... but you may end up leaving effects off
2008-01-24T09:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	What all did you install or try , and what were you trying to fix or do in the beginning
2008-01-24T10:00:00.000Z	pajamian	Jack_Sparrow	In answer to your question: ok, well I installed gutsy from the alternate install CD (I just like that better, the install seems to run faster) ... and then I ran the updates and then I removed evolution and installed thunderbird and ubuntu restricted extra from synaptic in one shot and decided at that point I'd best reboot and see how it was going and the problem started occuring when it came back up then.
2008-01-24T10:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	No reason at all for that system to be acting up at that point
2008-01-24T10:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	Sorry but did you make any changes to the repos before you updated.
2008-01-24T10:02:00.000Z	pajamian	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, but it is, heh ... Next on my list was going to be installing flash (from the tarball since the synaptic installer doesn't work right now), and a few other bits.
2008-01-24T10:03:00.000Z	pajamian	Jack_Sparrow	only to uncheck the CD so it would go to the net for everything.
2008-01-24T10:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	I would not continue..  I would reinstall the live cd
2008-01-24T10:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	just those two things didnt cause that problem
2008-01-24T17:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	Morning,  which one
2008-01-24T18:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	Glad you got it narrowed down.  I suggest a backup at this point.. one command in a cli will do it..
2008-01-24T18:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	tar cvpzf backupdell.tgz --exclude=/backupdell.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found  --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/media --exclude=/root/.Trash -- /
2008-01-24T18:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	Always remember to exclude the backup from the backup to avoid endless loop situation
2008-01-24T18:03:00.000Z	pajamian	Jack_Sparrow	yep, thx
2008-01-24T18:08:00.000Z	pajamian	Jack_Sparrow	do you know how to tell apt to ignore a particular package or packages for upgrading?  I think it may have to do with pinning the particular version of a package?
2008-01-24T18:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	YEs, that is it, but no I dont know how as I have never done it
2008-01-24T18:09:00.000Z	pajamian	Jack_Sparrow	ok, I'll just look it up, then, probably tomorrow as it's 2am here.
2008-01-24T18:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	That seldom works right
2008-03-09T05:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pajamian	bot is in for an oil change
