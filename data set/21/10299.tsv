2005-04-14T16:40:00.000Z	georges		hi, anyone knows of a good video editing tool?
2005-04-14T16:41:00.000Z	georges		*damn*
2005-04-14T16:41:00.000Z	georges		ok, do you know of a bad editing tool?
2005-04-14T06:14:00.000Z	georges		hey, any good bash programmer here?
2005-04-14T06:16:00.000Z	lok	georges	I'm not good but maybe I can help
2005-04-14T06:17:00.000Z	georges	lok	I want do do: vi *... but only the last 10 files, so I do: vi $(ls -rt|tail -10)
2005-04-14T06:17:00.000Z	georges	lok	but those filenames contain spaces!!!
2005-04-14T06:17:00.000Z	georges	lok	so... it's not working.
2005-04-14T06:18:00.000Z	lok		for i in `ls -rt | tail -n 10` ; do vi $i ; done  ?
2005-04-14T06:19:00.000Z	lok	georges	does it works ?
2005-04-14T06:19:00.000Z	georges	lok	yeah, and each time I will have to retype my search buffer.
2005-04-14T06:19:00.000Z	georges	lok	I want ONE vi session, not 10
2005-04-14T06:20:00.000Z	georges	lok	it's more complicated, let's say gimp instead of vi
2005-04-14T06:20:00.000Z	georges	lok	and your script only works if you write: vi "$i"
2005-04-14T06:21:00.000Z	lok	georges	how launch 2 file in 1 vi session   vi file1 file2 ? (I don't use it )
2005-04-14T06:21:00.000Z	georges	lok	yes.
2005-04-14T06:21:00.000Z	georges	lok	and with :n you edit the next file
2005-04-14T06:25:00.000Z	lok	georges	and with a ls -rt1 | sed s/\n/" "/  ?
2005-04-14T06:25:00.000Z	lok	georges	and with a ls -rt1 | tail -n 10 |sed s/\n/" "/  ?
2005-04-14T06:28:00.000Z	georges	lok	hmm... what about creating yourself a file with spaces. you will have a nize puzzle to work on.
2005-04-14T06:28:00.000Z	georges	lok	yes, the sed trik does not work
