2010-02-06T13:27:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	follow the directions after "2).Using Ubuntu 9.10 livecd" here: http://ubuntuguide.net/how-to-restore-grub-2-after-reinstalling-windows-xpvistawin7
2010-02-06T13:30:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	booting to it doesn't work? sounds like you might have a bad disc. try burning another or use unetbootin to put ubuntu on a usb flashdrive
2010-02-06T13:31:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	do you get the same or similar messages when you try to boot them?
2010-02-06T13:32:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	: never.. I had these kinda messages
2010-02-06T13:32:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	to fix grub you need to get into a live environment of some kind. ideally ubuntu karmic
2010-02-06T13:35:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	unetbootin creates liveusbs
2010-02-06T13:35:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	k

2010-02-06T16:26:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	Hi.. problem solved.. had 2 X 2 GB ram.. removed 1 slot..  now its working...  :)
2010-02-06T16:27:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	whaaaaat. that is so wacky. how did you figure it out?
2010-02-06T16:27:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	trial n error. :P
2010-02-06T16:28:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	tat RAM slot had the problem...
2010-02-06T16:28:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	ehh sure it's the slot? not the stick? you could try swapping the ram
2010-02-06T16:29:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	ah alright. does it work in another slot?
2010-02-06T16:29:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	yeah
2010-02-06T16:30:00.000Z	chelz	geekyogi	yeah something about that just made it corrupt stuff. eh well. strange that it cropped up now. you may have a dying mobo, capacitors going out or something. be sure to backup your data ;)
2010-02-06T16:32:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	yeah.. I think it has happened coz of using multiple virtual box, dynampis n other apps tat took a huge load on its memory...
2010-02-06T16:32:00.000Z	geekyogi	chelz	the lappy used to heat up like a volcano.!
