2007-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	cookie		I do not know what I need to fix or what I broke
2007-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	do you know how to use a terminal?
2007-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	try alsamixer
2007-12-29T00:07:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	you probably want alsa, I believe OSS sound system is depreciated
2007-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	I'd set all the bars to 100% for testing, and make sure they aren't muted (it will show 2 "M" characters under the bar.
2007-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	be careful if you have the computer hooked up to a power amplifier or speakesr that can get LOUD. =)
2007-12-29T00:12:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	Mic boost will function differently depending on your hardware, but the idea is to make the microphone input more sensitive.
2007-12-29T00:12:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	by the way, if you prefix your lines with my nick name, I can read it easier, this tends to be a busy channel.
2007-12-29T00:13:00.000Z	cookie	windsor1	how about IEC958 and IEC958 P
2007-12-29T00:13:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	looks like something specific to your sound chipset... what is your current situation in troubleshooting? has your sound ever worked on this computer before?
2007-12-29T00:15:00.000Z	cookie	windsor1	It still does...I think I fixed it! But when I talk on skype, and I have my mic and mic boost to 0, can the other person still hear me?
2007-12-29T00:15:00.000Z	cookie	windsor1	I tried and it can...but why?
2007-12-29T00:16:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	probably not, but don't take that as a guarantee. =) You can simply mute the mic input using alsamixer or the desktop mixer widget that may or may not be on your desktop panel.
2007-12-29T00:17:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	you may have more than one sound device. For example, if you have a USB headset for skype, it will appear to alsa as a different sound device than your on-board sound hardware.
2007-12-29T00:17:00.000Z	windsor1	cookie	then they would have separate sound controls (and mute controls)... No problem. =)
