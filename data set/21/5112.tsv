2007-12-23T15:48:00.000Z	Tobias92		Dear ubuntu people, I want to compile something and it seems I need "scons" for that. However, the script keeps complaining it can't find "libgtkmm" in the pkg_config_path variable. How can I fix this?
2007-12-23T15:48:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	install libgtkmm-dev
2007-12-23T15:48:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	I tried that, it does not work :s
2007-12-23T15:49:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	do you have build-essential installed?
2007-12-23T15:49:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	I do according to apt-get
2007-12-23T15:51:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	hmmm, if you do pkg-config --list-all in a terminal does it show libgtkmm?
2007-12-23T15:51:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	it does not
2007-12-23T15:52:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	did pkg-config show other libraries?
2007-12-23T15:52:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	lots and lots of them so I had to use grep to filter
2007-12-23T15:53:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	hmm, thats strange
2007-12-23T16:04:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	no problem
2007-12-23T15:57:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	any idea how I could make it show up in pkg-config?
2007-12-23T15:57:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	installing the -dev for libgtkmm should make it work, what program are you trying to install?
2007-12-23T15:58:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	something very exotic, its a tool to flash my ASURO robot
2007-12-23T15:59:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	that is exotic, i was thinking trying to get synaptic to install the source of a similar package (which would get all of the -dev dependancies)
2007-12-23T15:59:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	that'd be handy indeed ;)
2007-12-23T16:00:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	it's a german company that made it though, so all packages they provide are .rpm, and heavily outdated
2007-12-23T16:02:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	hmmm, this is strange, ive checked on my gentoo and it doesnt list gtkmm in pkg-config even though I do have it installed
2007-12-23T16:03:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	I got through it now :). I needed libgtkmm-2.4-dev plus tweaking the gtk sourcecode a bit
2007-12-23T16:04:00.000Z	MrHippocampus	Tobias92	good to hear :)
2007-12-23T16:04:00.000Z	Tobias92	MrHippocampus	thanks for the helping-out though :)
