2007-10-25T20:05:00.000Z	Andycasss		Hmm I dont get it, how can i change a pass while im not logged in
2007-10-25T20:05:00.000Z	Andycasss		When i enter the alt ctrl f1 terminal, the first thing it asks me is a login
2007-10-25T20:06:00.000Z	Andycasss		Why would i want to do that? I just want to change mythtv pass so i can do sudo for it
2007-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	Andycasss		I can access my own account fine
2007-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 i dident need to set up a rootpassword for my mythtv setup.
2007-11-28T22:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 you could always enable the logging features of your ftp server and  have a 'tail -f /var/log/ftpserverlog' in a terminal.
2007-11-28T22:34:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	I dont want ftp logging, i want to have a live overview of things...
2007-11-28T22:34:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	maybe monitor it thru another pc?
2007-11-28T22:34:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	would this be possible?
2007-11-28T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 watching the logs scroll by is live :) of course it takes some reading to elarn whats going on. Ive never seen a gui tool that just watches ftp logs.  then again - its best to not use ftp if you can avoide it.
2007-11-28T22:44:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	There is a ftpmonitor tool, but it doesnt work for me
2007-11-28T22:44:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	I couldnt find any way to execute it, it said it should be in the "add to panel" menu, but its not
2008-03-29T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 set up a public share. check the 'samba-doc' package for the html book 'using samba' it gives lots of examples.
2008-03-29T19:21:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	im using public=yes
2008-03-29T19:22:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	and i have guest ok = yes, ive read the doc files
2008-03-29T19:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 I would double check. there may be some other security setting.
2008-03-29T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 i was thinking there was some other option needed also. to allow anyone to connect to the shares. let me pastebin my samba.conf file for ya to check out.
2008-03-29T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 http://paste.stgraber.org/2091
2008-03-29T19:25:00.000Z	Andycasss	Dr_willis	 here is my current conf: http://pastebin.com/d1f1107ee
2008-03-29T19:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 its time for me to head to work. sorry i cant help more.
2008-04-27T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andycasss	 'sudo fdisk -l' or 'mount' command.
