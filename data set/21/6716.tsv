2007-02-11T06:17:00.000Z	Gator		uhh, I think I'll just try a newer kernal
2007-02-11T06:17:00.000Z	Gator		!!! the liveCD just booted
2007-02-11T06:18:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	ghe he :)
2007-02-11T17:59:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	have you just installed ubuntu, or changed any hardware? Because i got that problem when a added a hard disk once, and fixed it with merging two in raid1.
2007-02-11T06:00:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	the only hardware I've added was a graphics card...
2007-02-11T06:02:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	i don't think that should give you the busybox, just the terminal when the config is wrong afaik.
2007-02-11T06:02:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	I figured, but is there any way to fix "the busybox"?
2007-02-11T06:04:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	other than testing and trying in would not know, i got reactions like "if that happens it generally is very bad".
2007-02-11T06:05:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	I wouldn't mind reinstalling Ubuntu since there is nothing personal on its partition, but my liveCD gets "stuck" when booting the kernal
2007-02-11T06:06:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	if it did work before adding the new video card, you at least know where to look, right/
2007-02-11T06:07:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	I'm sorry... look for what? >_>
2007-02-11T06:07:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	for where the problem got introduced
2007-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	I'm pretty sure ubuntu wasn't working before I installed the graphics card
2007-02-11T06:10:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	i see, then personally, i would try a live-cd of a distro which has a newer kernel version, just to try and test that out.
2007-02-11T06:12:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	I'm pretty sure ubuntu wasn't working before I installed the graphics card
2007-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	yeah, but like i said, i have been having problems too when i added a third hard drive in my system, while fedora booted that just fine.
2007-02-11T06:14:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	I don't really care about fixing it other than reinstalling, but I can't boot from my liveCD because the liveCD freezes when it boots the kernal
2007-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	two options: try the alternative cd/DVD, or try a distro with a newer kernel version.
2007-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	Gator	bbr12	What is the alternative cd/DVD?
2007-02-11T06:16:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	that the cd which is not the live-cd but the text-installation (the DVD-version can do both live and text install)
2007-02-11T06:17:00.000Z	bbr12	Gator	but i dunno, if live already fails it's not a good sign i guess
