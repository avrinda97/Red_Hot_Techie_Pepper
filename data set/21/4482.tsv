2008-05-11T14:08:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	for example the sound mixer s
2008-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	with alsa it loops
2008-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	you don't have any real alternative... maybe your prob is pulsaudio ?
2008-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	 what can I do?
2008-05-11T13:56:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	describe the problem as exact as possible and what you have tried so far to sole it
2008-05-11T13:58:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	 simply the sound loops. I can't use ubuntu if I can't listen some music watch a film ecc..... I have done a fresh install of 8.04 but when I used the 7.10 all works great
2008-05-11T13:59:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	what player? what hardware? (cpu/ram)?
2008-05-11T14:01:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	 usually I use rythmbox my audio card is 80:01.0 Audio device: VIA Technologies, Inc. VIA High Definition Audio Controller (rev 10) and I have a 32 bit system with 2 gbyte Ram
2008-05-11T14:01:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	quit rythmbox, issue 'killall pulseaudio' start rythmbox again and check
2008-05-11T14:03:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	nothing
2008-05-11T14:03:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	nothing what? no sound or no problems ?
2008-05-11T14:04:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	don't do nothing the sound is already looping
2008-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	dont't worry. probably is a bug. for some times I continue to use xp and when it is solved I come back to ubuntu. I'm trying to solve this problem since two weeks
2008-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	try another player to double check, i.e. mplayer or vlc and set the output to alsa
2008-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	i think you got trouble with pulse
2008-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	 I have tried with another player it is the same
2008-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	what can I do for pulse?
2008-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	and made sure it does nou use the soundserver, but alsa directly ?
2008-05-11T14:08:00.000Z	stefg	mastranzio	you could just not use it, but use alsa's dmix feature
2008-05-11T14:09:00.000Z	mastranzio	stefg	 ok thanks
