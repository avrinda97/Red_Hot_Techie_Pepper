2008-09-22T13:49:00.000Z	MartinCz		Hi. I am searching for a console with bash which would be open by   `  key in a pull-out way, like a awning in an window.
2008-09-22T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	wgat cab tiy see ?
2008-09-22T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	what can you see
2008-09-22T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	console/shell are two seperate things
2008-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	sorry - not you
2008-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	the console and the shell are two seperate things, you mean you want a terminal ?
2008-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	ir's possibly just a "skin" or theme for an existing terminal emmulation program
2008-09-22T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	look at gnome themes and look at other terminals like "eterm" or "aterm" and look a skins for them
2008-09-22T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	they are not
2008-09-22T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	do you mean gdm themes (I assume so)
2008-09-22T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	are you using gdm or kdm ?
2008-09-22T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	if you look on gnome-look.org you'll find pre-packaged themes that you can drag and drop into gdm theme manager
2008-09-22T15:22:00.000Z	MartinCz	ikonia	yeah, but i don't want to install any, i'd just like to edit one...
2008-09-22T15:22:00.000Z	MartinCz	ikonia	and that's why i need to find the dir
2008-09-22T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	then it depends what part you want to edit as the themes are seperated out into many files
2008-09-22T15:23:00.000Z	MartinCz	ikonia	i'd like to make the font size smaller
2008-09-22T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	launch gdm_manager and edit it
2008-09-22T15:24:00.000Z	MartinCz	ikonia	system -> administration -> login window?
2008-09-22T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	not sure I don't have an ubuntu box to hand to check, but I assume so
2008-09-22T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	MartinCz	that may not be the right tool, I think it's gdm_manager
2008-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	MartinCz	ikonia	i can see only gdmsetup
