2007-03-15T16:48:00.000Z	shdowhawk		Hi all... not sure if i should be here or somewhere else ... but can anyone tell me how to get my php5 working?  My html seems to be working great ... but phpinfo() isn't working.  Not sure if it's an apache issue or what... nor do iknow how to check =/
2007-03-15T16:48:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	you created a file called "file.php" or some such, or did you make it ".html" ?
2007-03-15T16:49:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	my index.html works file.  my index.php with <?php phpinfo(); ?> is not showing the dump... only the literally thing i wrote
2007-03-15T16:50:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	what php packages did you install?
2007-03-15T16:51:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	lots =)  everything from libapache2-mod-php5 ... php5 .. to a bunch of extras like the curl, gd, mcrypt etc
2007-03-15T16:52:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	and did you re-start apache after the package installation?
2007-03-15T16:53:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	restart / apache2 stop ... then start ... even restarted the computer
2007-03-15T16:53:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	know if the apache2 access log or something would show an error if a php file was called and not working?
2007-03-15T16:54:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	hmm, and dpkg -l shows the apache2 module for php?
2007-03-15T16:54:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	lemme check that.  I'm new to debian type goodness =)
2007-03-15T16:55:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	no worries.  I needed a newer version of Apache and PHP so I built from source.  heh
2007-03-15T16:55:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	libapache2-mod-php5 is showing up for it
2007-03-15T16:56:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	and if you grep for php in your httpd.conf, what do you get?  (pm me if it's a bunch of lines)
2007-03-15T16:56:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	cool... gimme a sec to let me check
2007-03-15T16:58:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	hmm ... interesting.  Nothing in my httpd.conf
2007-03-15T16:59:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	seems that everything is in the apache2.conf and my httpd.conf is empty
2007-03-15T16:59:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	shdowhawk	oh, that's fine, whats in there?
2007-03-15T05:00:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	other then a few commented out lines... the DirectoryIndex has index.php in it
2007-03-15T05:00:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	Ooohh... actually.. the commented out things are the AddTypes.  Do they need to be uncommented?
2007-03-15T05:01:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	heh.  Alright.. trying that out
2007-03-15T05:03:00.000Z	shdowhawk	mrpoundsign	awesome.  I'm getting silly apache2 errors now.  But i'm assuming that that would be the problem.  So i'll give it a shot after dinner.  thanks a ton for the help =)
