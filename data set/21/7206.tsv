2006-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	Khalsa		Hello, If I have this card: nvidia Corporation NV18 [Geforce MX 4000 AGP 8x]  (rev c1), is the the proper document I should be following to install the drivers: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia or something else? I tried following that and it killed X, i had to restore the xorg.conf to the default.
2006-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2006-11-11T11:14:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	nvidia-glx is already the newest version
2006-11-11T11:14:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	try glxinfo | grep render      what does that output?
2006-11-11T11:15:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	A bunch of lines like: Xlin: extenstion "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2006-11-11T11:15:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	Xlib*
2006-11-11T11:15:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	okay what else have you tried as far as installing nvidia drivers?
2006-11-11T11:15:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	did you use automatix?
2006-11-11T11:16:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	nothing, just that document, which, on restart of X, did not restart x and went to command line. I then restred the xorg.conf that was backup
2006-11-11T11:17:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	well just make sure in /etc/X11/xorg.conf you have the line Driver "nvidia"    under the device section.
2006-11-11T11:17:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	i doubt it, I just restored it to the default xorg.conf
2006-11-11T11:17:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	well thats the problem.  What are you trying to get working?
2006-11-11T11:18:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	I haven't tried yet, but I want to get the game "tremulous" working
2006-11-11T11:18:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	well change the deivce section so that it says Driver "nvidia" instead of nv or vesa.
2006-11-11T11:23:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	oh, I restarted X and the nvidia logo came up for a moment, I assume this means success? (getting tremulous now)
2006-11-11T11:23:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	yes
2006-11-11T11:23:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	to check for sure just glxinfo | grep render it should return Direct Rendering yes or somethign like that.
2006-11-11T11:24:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	yes, direct rendering: YES
2006-11-11T11:24:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	you're alls et.
2006-11-11T11:24:00.000Z	Khalsa	h1st0	Thank you very much for your help. I really appreciate it
2006-11-11T11:24:00.000Z	h1st0	Khalsa	all set
