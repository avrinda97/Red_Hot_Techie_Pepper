2011-03-01T04:27:00.000Z	silk		Is there someone that can answer a question about a seemingly broken dependancy in the lucid-main repo?
2011-03-01T04:27:00.000Z	silk		more specifically a tzdata-java dependancy on tzdata
2011-03-01T04:27:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	only one way to find out --- ask

2011-03-01T04:31:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	have you ran sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get safe-upgrade first?
2011-03-01T04:33:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	i think after the apt-get update you would need then to run apt-get safe-upgrade but maybe i am mistaken
2011-03-01T04:35:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	just installed with no problem on my 10.10 server x64
2011-03-01T04:36:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	did u run a safe-upgrade to do a full update and it still failed?
2011-03-01T04:37:00.000Z	silk	geoffmcc	apt-get safe-upgrade returns an error
2011-03-01T04:42:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	im not understanding the question, sorry
2011-03-01T04:42:00.000Z	silk	geoffmcc	im wondering what URL you have listed in your sources.list for the lucid main repository
2011-03-01T04:43:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	im on 10.10
2011-03-01T04:44:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	did u see my correction to command. sudo aptitude update then sudo aptitude safe-upgrade?
2011-03-01T04:51:00.000Z	silk	geoffmcc	i seem to be seeing a problem with the repo: W: Failed to fetch http://us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/lucid-updates/main/source/Sources.bz2  Hash Sum mismatch
2011-03-01T04:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	i have had that happen b4 and just run again and it goes threw, or did u try after first initial fail
2011-03-01T04:55:00.000Z	geoffmcc	silk	any reason using 10.04 - i think u said was recent install, do you not wish to use 10.10?
2011-03-01T04:56:00.000Z	silk	geoffmcc	no I dont. Its part of a service that has been tested on 10.04
