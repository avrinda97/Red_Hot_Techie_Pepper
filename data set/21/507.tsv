2012-02-09T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	the ubuntu install CD has gparted on it, so why need an extra CD>
2012-02-09T05:30:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	Because the ubuntu cd takes 2 minutes to boot and I'm an impatient geek.
2012-02-09T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	usb will boot faster than any CD, why not advise they use a USB stick or maybe even buy one just for your impatience. Think about it
2012-02-09T05:37:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I use a 8GB USB with about 6 distros, 13 system tools, 2 AV's and some other randoms made using YUMI. But as for them, I guess I would have been better off saying the gparted in the live cd :P I just don't like it personally.
2012-02-09T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	the user already has the tool you need, just strange to advise to download what they already have
2012-02-09T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	I have a PXE boot with all that stuff, no need for USB
2012-02-09T05:38:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	Personal preference makes my advice to others different then what most would consider the "simplest route"
2012-02-09T05:39:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I've never seen a need for that. Clutters up the bootloader. I have truecrypt chainload grub2 ( hidden since I only has one entry).
2012-02-09T05:40:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I used to have a quint boot, but Arch was too time consuming, Hackintosh was too buggy and Jolicloud was pretty much useless.
2012-02-09T05:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	try xpud, fastest boot I ever saw
2012-02-09T05:42:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I'm going to stick with what I have. Its a stable system, and due to the encryption on both my Ubuntu LTS and Windows 7 (Never upgrading to 8. Ever)... I'd rather not mess with a good thing.
2012-02-09T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	the stuff in Lucid is painful on newer kit in my experience. I always grab the next release when it hits alpha1
2012-02-09T05:43:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I can't really afford to either. Managing two Debian repo's, 4 websites and Uni gets stressful.
2012-02-09T05:44:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I can't, I need stability. LTS is the best chance Ive got without going for Debian sqeeze haha.
2012-02-09T05:45:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I used to have time to mess with my system and wipe my harddrive every month to have more fun... sadly, this is not the case anymore.
2012-02-09T05:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	I manage several DCs for work as well as remote customers, but its not my kit. My home PC gets played with lots
2012-02-09T05:47:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I see, My PC is my work and play. Its a 2009 Gateway MD73 with plenty of upgrades :P, Getting a MBP in June though.
2012-02-09T05:48:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I may just fit it into this case If I can haha. I'll miss it. Red, Silver, Black .... I hate the pure white of apples monopoly.
2012-02-09T05:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	never had to debug the G1 and GT540 I have had
2012-02-09T05:50:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	ActionParsnip	I am only taking shots haha. The nexus looks very nice, I've been using a flip phone for years XD! Never upgraded. Got an iPod Touch just because I kept breaking Mp3 players.
2012-02-09T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JosephHarrietha	does an external mic work ok?
