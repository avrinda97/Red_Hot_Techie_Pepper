2007-01-07T08:33:00.000Z	Aggort		Does anyone in here know why Windows would need the Windows Install CD to be in the CD drive to boot, though it doesn't actually boot the CD?
2007-01-07T08:33:00.000Z	Aggort		I need this error fixed big time
2007-01-07T08:33:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	> youre not getting some kind of error message with the demand for the disc?
2007-01-07T09:15:00.000Z	Aggort	riotkittie	because regardless it will ask me to boot from CD (even thought it's clearly on the hard drive.
2007-01-07T15:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	<< you resolve your cd problem yet?
2007-01-07T15:56:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	>> cool! i am glad to hear that
2007-01-10T10:11:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	"best" is a relative, meaningless term. the repos are full of cool things, just search, try and keep or remove as you see fit.
2007-01-10T10:12:00.000Z	Aggort	riotkittie	Well I figured that, but really I don;t know where to look. I know for GIMP there is GIMPShop, but I don't know necessarily where to get it and all. I was hoping for a website, like download.com
2007-01-10T11:51:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	what kind of app - something you've downloaded? or from the repos?
2007-01-10T11:53:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	do this instead. open a term and type ...  sudo apt-get install vnc
2007-01-10T11:53:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	do this instead. open a term and type ...  sudo apt-get install vls
2007-01-10T11:53:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	do this instead. open a term and type ...  sudo apt-get install vlc
2007-01-10T11:56:00.000Z	Aggort	riotkittie	the file to install I don;t understand
2007-01-10T11:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	type "sudo apt-get install vlc" in a term. this will download the file and install it for you, as vlc is available in the repos
2007-01-10T12:01:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	what about repos confuses you?
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	Aggort	riotkittie	Nevermind I read something and it jsut clicked I get it lol ... Are there a lot of repositories?
2007-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	uhmmm i believe that there are others that can be added manually but i am not positive. if there are, they are something used at your own risk
2007-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	are you doing this in X?
2007-01-10T12:04:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	do you have Synaptic open ?
2007-01-10T12:06:00.000Z	riotkittie	Aggort	go to Settings on the menu, you'll find the repo option under there
2007-01-10T12:07:00.000Z	Aggort	riotkittie	I did nice list of new apps
