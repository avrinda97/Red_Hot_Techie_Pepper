2006-07-07T15:22:00.000Z	breadmachine		anyone?
2006-07-07T15:23:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	you may be behind a proxy, or have a proxy configured in firefox
2006-07-07T15:24:00.000Z	breadmachine		nope, no proxy, just simple DHCP, i made sre
2006-07-07T15:24:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	you sure you dont have one configured in firefox then?
2006-07-07T15:24:00.000Z	breadmachine		pretty sure
2006-07-07T15:25:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	how many network interfaces?
2006-07-07T15:25:00.000Z	breadmachine		3 total, 2 cars and 1 integrated on mobo
2006-07-07T15:25:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	might have something to do with your routing I guess. Then again, I might be talking out of my butt.
2006-07-07T15:26:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	is it the same machine you are chatting from?
2006-07-07T15:26:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	well, im using qwest DSL and an actiontec gateway
2006-07-07T15:27:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	ive actually installed this SAME exact version of ubuntu about 6 months ago and had no problems
2006-07-07T15:27:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	is it the same machine you are on right now?
2006-07-07T15:27:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	yes, although im booted into XP at the moment
2006-07-07T15:27:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	can you go into xchat if you go to linux?
2006-07-07T15:27:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	or any other internet-y programs?
2006-07-07T15:28:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	nope, the connection times out, same as the net
2006-07-07T15:29:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	im truly stumped
2006-07-07T15:30:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	breadmachine	all I can think of is to check that you have no global proxy enabled for gnoe, and no proxys for any of the apps. Then recheck your network settings and make sure your internet interface is the one marked as default there. If that doesnt work, try creating a new user and logging in to that, see if that works.
2006-07-07T15:30:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	i could try that.....
2006-07-07T15:30:00.000Z	breadmachine	La_PaRCa	thanks
