2008-05-15T13:42:00.000Z	icewaterman	ikonia	the problem is, that openssl stuff and apps using it were generating keys that are highly predictable. and after the openssl update is create all keys again, now i am unsure whether i have to start that all over again or not
2008-07-04T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	icewaterman	it's in process
2008-07-16T13:08:00.000Z	icewaterman	ikonia	i believe he did, he is just way to impatient
2008-07-16T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	icewaterman	I've not seen it
2008-07-16T13:08:00.000Z	icewaterman	ikonia	doesnt matter as i said, he seems to be impatient and angry. neither of that properties will get him far
2008-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	icewaterman	please stop this discussion
2008-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	icewaterman	ikonia	why?
2008-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	icewaterman	because it's nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	icewaterman	ikonia	it works just fine
2008-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	icewaterman	ikonia	sure? dell has some suppport for updating bios in the kernel
2008-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	icewaterman	it's not stable and supported
2008-10-19T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	icewaterman	the process is to boot from remoable media as documented on he dell site
