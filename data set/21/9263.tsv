2006-03-17T16:22:00.000Z	eva_		Which repository do I need to get supertux 0.1.3?
2006-03-17T16:23:00.000Z	eva_		Nobody here uses supertux?
2006-03-17T16:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	you need universe enabled
2006-03-17T16:24:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	I have and i use breezy, but version 0.1.2 doesn't have the new levels
2006-03-17T16:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	than it looks like alot of work
2006-03-17T16:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	you will have to compile the version you want if not that version
2006-03-17T16:25:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	but there must be some repository that has it?
2006-03-17T16:25:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	version 0.1.3 has been aout like half a year now!!
2006-03-17T16:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	you can check packages.ubuntu.com under breezy
2006-03-17T16:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	more than likely the version you want was released after breezy so it wouldnt be included in breezy (i doubt the backports have it but on that site will tell you
2006-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	But there is no unsupported repository that may have it?
2006-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	Where can I find some unsupported repositories?
2006-03-17T16:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	adding the dapper repo may get you it but it _will_ bork your system
2006-03-17T16:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	go to the website and see if there is a way to get it
2006-03-17T16:29:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	I don't want to bork my system
2006-03-17T16:29:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	Which website?
2006-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	i dont know search supertux it should be there in google
2006-03-17T16:31:00.000Z	eva_	gnomefreak	is Dapper already released?
2006-03-17T16:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	no
2006-07-19T11:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eva_	does sudo apt-get update work?
