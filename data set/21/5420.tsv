2008-09-03T06:03:00.000Z	BunTai		can u teach me?
2008-09-03T06:03:00.000Z	BunTai		im new about wireless
2008-09-03T06:03:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	network icon, top right corner of the screen?
2008-09-03T06:04:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	if your card is set up, you should see a list of networks when you click on that
2008-09-03T06:06:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	ok, try 'system > administration > hardware drivers and see if it mentions wireless in there
2008-09-03T06:08:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	so there was a driver for your wireless and you installed it?
2008-09-03T06:08:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	but you don't see any wireless networks when you slick on the network icon at the top-right of the screen?
2008-09-03T06:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	Hmmmm.. OK. One thing you might try, sometimes there's a button on the laptop that turns the wireless adapter on and off (my acer has it)
2008-09-03T06:10:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	otherwise you probably need to go through the stuff in !wireless which generally isn't fun
2008-09-03T06:14:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	there should only be one 'network' icon and if you have wireless it will list all the APs when you click it (the other option there will be 'wired network')
2008-09-03T06:15:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	and when you're connected it changes from two computers to a signal-bar
2008-09-03T06:16:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	because the wireless adapter hasn't seen any access points so nothing to connect to?
2008-09-03T06:17:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	are you near an access point?
2008-09-03T06:18:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	weird. your AP should show up then. Open a terminal and type 'iwconfig' and pastebin the result?
2008-09-03T06:20:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	hmm... kinda looks like it should be working already :(
2008-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	there was a bug in the madwifi drivers that I think is fixed now.. updating your system _might_ fix it for you?
2008-09-03T06:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BunTai	apt-get install --reinstall .. yes
