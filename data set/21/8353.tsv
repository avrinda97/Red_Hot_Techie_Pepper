2006-06-09T11:28:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	zapping is quite good (but my card only gives b/w :()
2006-06-09T11:34:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	not unless you want no packages available :)
2006-06-09T11:34:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	i can not use apt and update manager anymore cause there is a syntax error in this file
2006-06-09T11:35:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	This is automatically made. Have you added a dodgy repo? try updating apt again
2006-06-09T11:37:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	"sudo apt-get update"
2006-06-09T11:37:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	it works well
2006-06-09T11:37:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	after this command i've got du /var/lib/dpkg/available  | 0       /var/lib/dpkg/available
2006-06-09T11:38:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	i think this is a bug in the update process
2006-06-09T11:38:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	? Sorry I don't understand
2006-06-09T11:39:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	Oh. Well that seems even more seriuos. I don't know hat to do now, sorry :(
2006-06-09T11:40:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	could you tell me the size of your /var/lib/dpkg/available file please
2006-06-09T11:40:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	2100617 (taken from "ls -l"
2006-06-09T11:41:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	ok mine size=0
2006-06-09T11:42:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	That file is automatically generated, so sending you one would not work :(
2006-06-09T11:43:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	so how to regenerate this file ?
2006-06-09T11:43:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	with "sudo apt-get update" unfortunately
2006-06-09T11:43:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	can you paste me the first liner of your file please
2006-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	Warbo	psycose	Glad you fixed it :)
2006-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	psycose	Warbo	yes
