2011-09-22T09:02:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	sorry didn't follow from the beginning... what is the problem exactly ? you have a 32 bits package that you want to install on a 64 bits system ?
2011-09-22T09:04:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	yes.. its my mx340 drivers.. i used to do dpkg --force-all -i with ia32libs installed and everything would work great for the past 3 releases.. now it breaks my package install whenever i set them up that way.. even though they function..  I also have the source but have no idea how to compile
2011-09-22T09:05:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	isn't there a README or INSTALL file in the source package ? could you post a link to that source package ?
2011-09-22T09:08:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	nope... thats what bugs me... http://support-au.canon.com.au/P/search?model=PIXMA+MX340&menu=download&filter=0&tagname=g_os&g_os=Linux
2011-09-22T09:11:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	having a look, give me a few minutes
2011-09-22T09:12:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	sur
2011-09-22T09:12:00.000Z	nathanel		sur
2011-09-22T09:12:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	sure*
2011-09-22T09:14:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	btw, before trying to compile, did you try --force-architecture instead of --force-all ?
2011-09-22T09:14:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	will try
2011-09-22T09:16:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	it still asks for install -f
2011-09-22T09:17:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	first purge the package, then run "sudo apt-get install -f" then dpkg --force-architecture
2011-09-22T09:17:00.000Z	nathanel		did it
2011-09-22T09:18:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	did that
2011-09-22T09:20:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	ok then i'll have a look at the source
2011-09-22T09:21:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	all you should have to do to compile is extract the tarball then cd to the created folder and run "make" then "sudo make install"
2011-09-22T09:22:00.000Z	nathanel		glebihan.. normally yes.. but it doesnt
2011-09-22T09:22:00.000Z	glebihan	nathanel	meaning ? what errors do you get ?
2011-09-22T09:22:00.000Z	nathanel	glebihan	error all ** stop
