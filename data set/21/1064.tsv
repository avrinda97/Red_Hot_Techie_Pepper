2011-07-02T11:05:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	I don't know very much about C++, but that's because I'm too lazy to learn it. My plan is to stick with Java and Python where I can, and C# and .NET where I must.
2011-07-02T11:05:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	ditto for C and ASM
2011-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	I actually liked writing MIPS ASM, but it's sort of like using a 10lb sledge to hammer in a nail to hang a picture.
2011-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	I could never wrap my head around asm, and with x64 i hear its nearly impossible, if you have any book reccomendations please let me know
2011-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	I imagine a lot of the slowness of modern java is just bad coding practices. Good code is fast. Bad code isn't. :)
2011-07-02T11:09:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	yes I agree, Java allows that, whereas C++ doesn't.. as much.
2011-07-02T11:09:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	I've found that python can be slow too, but generally it's slow in places you don't care about. It's really nice for whipping some code together really fast.
2011-07-02T11:09:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	I thought lisp would be better than python for those cases?
2011-07-02T11:10:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	throwing together a prototype? Eh. From what I've seen of Lisp, it's elegent, but not easy to work with. too many parenthesis.
2011-07-02T11:10:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	I know racket and schem so I'm used to it :P. it works within emacs flawlessly too.. that's my excuse
2011-07-02T11:11:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	"Learning Python" from O'Reilly is pretty good, and http://tinyurl.com/thinkcspy is supposed to be excellent.
2011-07-02T11:13:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	My suggestion is to avoid perl, from personal experience. It's really really fun when you're first learning it, but all the object oriented stuff feels kludged together to me.
2011-07-02T11:13:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	It's hard to beat CPAN in terms of sheer number of modules, but I spent a lot of time fooling around with Perl defaults.
2011-07-02T11:14:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	I've never programmed it before all i know is it integrates well in webservers
2011-07-02T11:14:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	there is a lot of weirness. I always feel like someone waves their hands and yells "Abracadabra" when I run a perl script. There are a lot of weird default variables and stuff
2011-07-02T11:14:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	also bookmarked your linlk
2011-07-02T11:15:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	Programming Python (also an O'Reilly book) is pretty awesome too
2011-07-02T11:16:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	http://duke.csc.villanova.edu/jss1/ my uni used this book. it was pretty good
2011-07-02T11:16:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	10,000 hours is expert level supposedly :)
2011-07-02T11:20:00.000Z	Senjai	tntc	care to share soe of those? I took one cpsc course in uni so far
2011-07-02T11:22:00.000Z	tntc	Senjai	I already do :) Most of em are out in the hands of other CS students.
