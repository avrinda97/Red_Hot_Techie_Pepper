2011-08-25T05:13:00.000Z	kingofswords		can some one tell me if clonezilla is just for copying ubuntu installation before i totally mess up my ubntu?
2011-08-25T05:14:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	yes(ish) - it works for more than just ubuntu
2011-08-25T05:16:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	are you following a specific tutorial we can see? it probably will just copy it though
2011-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	what do you mean by your ubuntu? are you dual booting? and are  you trying to replicate packages on another machine?
2011-08-25T05:22:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	im using updatemanager to go from 10.04lts to 10.10 and usrlin told me i should backup mu ubuntu incase something goes wrong
2011-08-25T05:23:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	back up ubuntu means different things to different people. for me that only means backing up my home directory. do you have lots of custom software installed/configured or are you running stock?
2011-08-25T05:24:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	some custom software i think
2011-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	having a good backup strategy in general is a good idea. you will have to create a live cd/usb for any full hdd backup because it can't operate on a drive in use. you will not be able to store the image on the live cd/usb you have to ssh or have a large capacity external to store the image
2011-08-25T05:29:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	 ok i only have a8gb usb which i was using as clonezilla live....so this means i cant back up my ubuntu?
2011-08-25T05:30:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	if i do the updatemanager upgrade and it messes up can i do a cd frsh install and keep my hdd files?(vids and games etc)
2011-08-25T05:30:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	not unless you have a nas/storageserver/other large capacity storage device
2011-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	there are utilities to try and recover the data, but recommended practice is to have backups. and if you don't have backups, get backups. then backup the backups. then make changes to the machine. industry standard is that if you don't have 3 copies of any given file, you don't care about the file.
2011-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	 i dont really care that much....just saves messing around reinstally
2011-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	and i am not sure at this point why you would go to 10.10 ~ many people here prefer the lts, particularly if you need stability.
2011-08-25T05:33:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	i want xorg 1.8
2011-08-25T05:35:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	i have game installed under wine whichis really laggy apparently xorg 1.8 fixes this
2011-08-25T05:39:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	you would have to look for a ppa, and ppas are not officially supported here
2011-08-25T05:40:00.000Z	kingofswords	milamber	if i find and add the ppa could i upgrade to 1.9 via synaptic?
2011-08-25T05:41:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	that is the goal of the ppas, but as i said, if you break your computing machine no one here would feel particularly obliged to help. ppas are only recommended for those that can fix their own oopsies.
2011-08-25T05:44:00.000Z	milamber	kingofswords	check the version numbers at packages.ubuntu.com before asking here. natty doesn't have it. i don't know who told you that upgrading to 1.8 would help (or what distro they were running), but it doesn't look like you are officially getting 1.8 for a while.
