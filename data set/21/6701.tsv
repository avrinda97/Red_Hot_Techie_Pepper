2007-02-16T13:40:00.000Z	khronus		i have tried all things i can see in the documentation

2007-02-16T13:42:00.000Z	dyrne	khronus	check it by reloading firefox and going to url about:plugins
2007-02-16T13:42:00.000Z	khronus		ok dyrne, brb, ty
2007-02-16T13:49:00.000Z	khronus		dyrne
2007-02-16T13:49:00.000Z	khronus	dyrne	sorry, i have d/led it and extracted, then what  ?
2007-02-16T13:54:00.000Z	dyrne	khronus	then the command tar xfvz file.tar.gz   that will extract the files. usually and it this case it will it uncompresses them to a directory  just cd directoryname   then ls to see the files then sudo mv file /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2007-02-16T13:54:00.000Z	khronus		 what does the command: sudo mv /usr/.... do ?
2007-02-16T13:55:00.000Z	dyrne	khronus	if the plugin will work all that is involved really is just dropping it in the plugin directory so firefox uses it
2007-02-16T13:55:00.000Z	khronus		ah ok dryne
2007-02-16T13:56:00.000Z	khronus		dryne, after extracting it creates several files, flashplayer9/linux, /readme, /flashplayer-installer, / libflashplayer.so, /flashplayer.xpt
2007-02-16T13:57:00.000Z	dyrne	khronus	you want the .so file  the other stuff is just readme and installer that does the same thing as mv
2007-02-16T13:58:00.000Z	dyrne	khronus	mv = move
