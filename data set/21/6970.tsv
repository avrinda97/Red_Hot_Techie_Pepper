2007-12-27T09:04:00.000Z	dave_		Hello........I am wondering if I can get an assist in getting my X config straight for 2 monitors using an nvidia card on 7.10?
2007-12-27T09:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	whats the prob?...
2007-12-27T09:07:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	.....the Ubuntu tool configs the monitors with the borders exceeding the screen real estate......however if I disable the 2nd monitor it is fine
2007-12-27T09:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	i really don't understand your question.
2007-12-27T09:09:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	to try and clarify........when I have one monitor enabled everything works fine.....if I enable the 2nd monitor,  you cannot see the edges of the desktop w/o moving the mouse
2007-12-27T09:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	oh ok....  i understand now. i've never had that problem... what do you have your resolution set at?
2007-12-27T09:11:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	1280x1024 ironically nvidia's own tool works to fix it....but if you try and install it you break the restricted driver
2007-12-27T09:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	i have nvidia's tol installed just fine.
2007-12-27T09:12:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	strange when I try to install nvidia-config it wants to remove the driver
2007-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	I did the enable restricted driver and let it handle the apt-get work
2007-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	ok.. and?
2007-12-27T09:15:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	the driver installs fine and enables.............but it doesnt seem to have the nvida tool installed.....going to the "Screens and Graphics" to do it results in virtual desktops or bulletproof X when I try and  fenable the 2nd monitor
2007-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	very strange, don't think i've ever had that prob, what video card?
2007-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	I then go into synapytic to install the tool and it wants to remove the nvidia(newest) driver.......GeForce 6200
2007-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	see, nvidia-settings has always been installed when i enable restricted...
2007-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	open a terminal and type "gksudo nvidia-settings"
2007-12-27T09:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	yes, open a terminal, gksudo nvidia-settings
2007-12-27T09:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	lol, no p-rob, th ats why i c9ouldn't understand your problem
2007-12-27T09:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	you can make a menu entry for it if you like, i did, just cuz i like to have it handy
2007-12-27T09:21:00.000Z	dave_	IndyGunFreak	I always do that, along with one for Nautilus in super user mode
2007-12-27T09:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dave_	yup, its handy
