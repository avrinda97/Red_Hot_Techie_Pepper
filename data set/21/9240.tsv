2005-10-17T13:41:00.000Z	Skidoo		no other options
2005-10-17T13:43:00.000Z	Skidoo		anyone know how to boot from a previous kernel if it's not in your Grub menu?
2005-10-17T13:45:00.000Z	Skidoo		problem: can't boot. symptoms: system hangs after kernel decompresses. unable to load previous kernel. any ideas gratefully appreciated
2005-10-17T13:47:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	Randomly, I might suggest using a Live CD to get in, chrooting to your root directory, and recompiling the kernel, but this is a little out of my depth.
2005-10-17T13:48:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	i'd rather not have to recompile. if the old kernel image is still there i may be able to configure Grub to load it, but i'm not a grub expert
2005-10-17T13:49:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	What happened that caused this?
2005-10-17T13:50:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	As in, what was the last thing you did? Put a bullet through your hard drive :) ?
2005-10-17T13:50:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	i seem to recall running an ubuntu update :)
2005-10-17T13:50:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	Ouch.
2005-10-17T13:50:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	quite
2005-10-17T13:51:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	Did you say that you couldn't get to your old kernel image? Is it accessible via grub?
2005-10-17T13:51:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	it's not in the grub menu
2005-10-17T13:51:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	Ah. Okay, yeah, use a Live CD on it.
2005-10-17T13:52:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	ok. then what?
2005-10-17T13:52:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	Mount in the system's partition, chroot to it, and run update-grub
2005-10-17T13:52:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	will that not just make it the same as it is now?
2005-10-17T13:53:00.000Z	Orborde	Skidoo	As someone said, if the kernel image itself is still hiding there, update-grub should find it. So try that first.
2005-10-17T13:53:00.000Z	Skidoo	Orborde	ok! i'll give it a shot. thanks!
