2008-01-07T04:23:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: i use virtualbox
2008-01-07T04:23:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	thanks I'll check that
2008-01-07T04:23:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: check out #vbox if you have any questions
2008-01-07T04:25:00.000Z	debatem1	mobiusthought	its what I do- i release source code free and the compiled binary for a charge. i have no qualms about other people compiling and redistributing, but i'd rather they look at code
2008-01-07T04:26:00.000Z	debatem1		jeah: k, you need to define a directory where you can copy everything over to. i would make it wherever you have mounted your largest non-swap hard drive partition
2008-01-07T04:26:00.000Z	WooD		I have a emt64 Intel Intel Core 2 Duo. Does ubuntu-7.10-dvd-amd64.iso is the best ? Is it better to get the 32 bit version ?
2008-01-07T04:27:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: if you enjoy using half your processor
2008-01-07T04:27:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	so 64 bit is better
2008-01-07T04:27:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	WoW cant wait to try this
2008-01-07T04:27:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: yeah
2008-01-07T04:28:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: which? virtualbox or x86_64?
2008-01-07T04:28:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	it is downloading right now on a torrent file ... 523.5 kB/s that's pretty fast
2008-01-07T04:29:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: the bandwidth gods smile upon ye
2008-01-07T04:29:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	I'm downloading Ubuntu-dvd-amd64.iso
2008-01-07T04:30:00.000Z	debatem1		jeah: right, now you need to make a directory- any directory, i might call it /install, and then mount /dev/sda2 /install
2008-01-07T04:34:00.000Z	debatem1		jeah: why... no, you should have nothing there
2008-01-07T04:37:00.000Z	debatem1		jeah: k... you need to format your partitions before continuing
2008-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	debatem1		jeah: resizing != formatting. resize can be nondestructive
2008-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	i have a little question for you again.. about virtualbox . wich I need to download if I install ubuntu 64 bit.. do  I have to download Virtualbox for i386 or amd64 ?
2008-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	debatem1		wood: amd64
2008-01-07T04:40:00.000Z	WooD	debatem1	thank you
