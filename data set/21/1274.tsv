2012-03-02T21:57:00.000Z	sw0rdfish		hey guys
2012-03-02T21:58:00.000Z	sw0rdfish		why does my ubuntu switch to eth0 mode when I connect an ethernet cable from my modem in (I mean I'm using wireless for internet and want to make a local network using my modem/router to my other laptop and if I plug the cable in It'll stop using the wirelesss.... can't I make it use both
2012-03-02T21:59:00.000Z	sw0rdfish		simply put
2012-03-02T22:00:00.000Z	sw0rdfish		I want my ubuntu to use both eth0 and eth1
2012-03-02T22:00:00.000Z	sw0rdfish		at the same time
2012-03-02T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	same time is no problem but with two ISP feeds?
2012-03-02T22:02:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	sacarlson	only one of them will have internet which is the wireless
2012-03-02T22:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	ok that sounds simple enuf then, if you just want to bridge them that's one method or you can add filters between that not much work eather
2012-03-02T22:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	or just forward trafic bettween with no filters that's all I can think of
2012-03-02T22:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	with no filters it's just a mater of setting up routes on each of the nets to decide where it needs to go to find what it wants
2012-03-02T22:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	I guess forward with routes might be most probable.  I've tried bridges with wifi and for some reason failed
2012-03-02T22:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	maybe something like this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
2012-03-02T22:39:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	sacarlson	this link should be able to help me you say right? ... what will it let me do exactly?https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
2012-03-02T22:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	it will connect all your local lan trafic on eth0 to your wifi internet eth1 when needed I would think
2012-03-02T22:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	you might find better tutorial than this one,  It was just the first that I found
2012-03-02T22:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	well it could be reversed if you wish eth1 could be lan and eth0 could be internet and I didn't read it to see how they configured this example
2012-03-02T22:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	lan trafic will remain in one net and when needed if outside the lan ip range the trafic will be forwarded onto the other nic to the internet or other
2012-03-02T22:45:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	sacarlson	well I'm trying to setup the lan with a modem/router... could it be that the laptop thinks the ethernet cable has internet and so it  takes priority? ... cuz when I tried it earlier irc stopped working as if I disconnected the wifi
2012-03-02T22:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	no you can configure any net to have different priority when it's setup custom,  im not sure what the default configs are
2012-03-02T22:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	as far as ubuntu is concerned all nics are the same other than having max bandwidth on each
2012-03-07T17:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	sw0rdfish	cell is an android?
