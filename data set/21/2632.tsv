2009-08-15T22:32:00.000Z	SmithX		can anyone help explain why ubuntu package management is so convoluted?
2009-08-15T22:32:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Ask #debian.
2009-08-15T22:35:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Debian developers could.
2009-08-15T22:35:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	After all, Ubuntu is just a .... fork of Debian, you could say.
2009-08-15T22:35:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Aptitude is tty-based, Synaptic uses X.
2009-08-15T22:36:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	And don't forget apt-get/apt-cache :)
2009-08-15T22:36:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Seriously, you've been told several times to ask Debian developer.
2009-08-15T22:38:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Debian has used apt since I first touched a computer; it had apt before Ubuntu existed; it still has apt.
2009-08-15T22:38:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	You could think of Ubuntu as an user-friendly Debian. They do have their own repos though
2009-08-15T22:48:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	DEBIAN, I repeat.
2009-08-15T22:53:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	apt-* is probably the most widely used one.
2009-08-15T22:54:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Because it's the simplest one.
2009-08-15T22:54:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Synaptic is a GUI app. Aptitude uses a ncurses interface. And apt -- apt-get install packagename, done.
2009-08-15T22:57:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Probably apt-get update; apt-get upgrade; apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-08-22T21:54:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	but sudo will ask for your own password to confirm.
2009-08-22T21:55:00.000Z	SmithX	grawity	you said earlier the password is the user password
2009-08-22T21:55:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	Yeah?
2009-08-22T21:57:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	You are free to use su -c if you want -- sudo is just preferred by many because it 1) doesn't require having the root password (the root account is locked), 2) allows fine-grained configuration.
2009-08-22T21:58:00.000Z	grawity	SmithX	What security problems does sudo have, in your opinion?
2009-08-22T21:59:00.000Z	SmithX	grawity	I'm going to try taking this to #ubuntu-hardenede
