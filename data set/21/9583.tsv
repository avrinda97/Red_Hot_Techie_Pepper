2005-09-01T07:36:00.000Z	liquidfire		Can I use gnomebaker for burning ripped dvd's?
2005-09-01T07:36:00.000Z	liquidfire		I don't see any videomode option in it
2005-09-01T07:36:00.000Z	liquidfire		or do i need to use the data mode option
2005-09-01T07:36:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	i find k3b to work best of the -burners
2005-09-01T07:37:00.000Z	liquidfire	nalioth	is there a video-dvd burning option in it ?
2005-09-01T07:37:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	you mean like "burn a video dvd"?
2005-09-01T07:37:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	yes i believe so
2005-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	enable all official repos (except backports) and then browswe synatpic for video tools
2005-09-01T07:39:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	i believe you'll be pleased
2005-09-01T07:52:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	did you enable all repos but backports and browse synaptic for video tools?
2005-09-01T07:52:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	you reloaded your apt-get after you enabled?
2005-09-01T07:53:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	there are lots of tools for video, (just dont ask me their names)
2005-09-01T07:57:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	if you've got the ifo/vob then just drop em into a video_ts and be done with it
2005-09-01T07:57:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	i dont think you browsed very hard in your synaptic
2005-09-01T08:15:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	you are after a command called "ln"
2005-09-01T08:15:00.000Z	liquidfire	nalioth	where should i put the command ?
2005-09-01T08:56:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	drop your ifo/vob into a video_ts folder and burn it as video with k3b
2005-09-01T08:58:00.000Z	liquidfire	nalioth	i'm blind or something
2005-09-01T09:03:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	np, just come back in here and spread the help
2005-09-01T09:15:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	you can have as many DMs as you can find, and won't hurt anything
2005-09-01T09:23:00.000Z	nalioth	liquidfire	enlightenment, xfce4, fluxbox, blackbox, etc etc
