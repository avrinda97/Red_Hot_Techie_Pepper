2007-10-20T01:26:00.000Z	novanosis		oh my word, now I checked to see if there is a selection for directX and all I saw was OPENGL,SOFTWARE,D3D. I tried D3D and now when I open CS it takes me back to my login screen for ubuntu
2007-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	D3D is Direct3D

2007-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	Xera		D3D is a Windows thing, you should select OpenGL or Software..
2007-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	novanosis		I cannot select anything now everytime I try to get in cs it takes me back to the login of ubuntu, any help please?
2007-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	delete your CS config file
2007-10-20T01:30:00.000Z	novanosis		ok DELETING the config.cfg file did not work or help. Please what should I do
2007-10-20T01:30:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	delete the cfg directory
2007-10-20T01:31:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	where should I look?
2007-10-20T01:31:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	also google for CS 1.6 start up paramaters for setting render mode, -gl should be it
2007-10-20T01:34:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	that did the trick but my main goal is to run cs smoothly, it wont run smooth in poengl but does fine in software mode
2007-10-20T01:35:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	so uh run it in software mode
2007-10-20T01:36:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	but software mode does not give the clarity? dont you understand? its pixelated
2007-10-20T01:36:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	but software mode runs smooth thats all
2007-10-20T01:37:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	well
2007-10-20T01:37:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	no idea
2007-10-20T01:37:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	good enough for me
2007-10-20T01:38:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	how bout I ask you this, is there anyway I can install an nvidia driver through wine? and have CS 1.6 use the windows based nvidia driver?
2007-10-20T01:38:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	lol no
2007-10-20T01:39:00.000Z	novanosis	Xera	HOW i pray for steam to be native on linux!
2007-10-20T01:39:00.000Z	Xera	novanosis	CS 1.6/Source works fine for everyone else I know
