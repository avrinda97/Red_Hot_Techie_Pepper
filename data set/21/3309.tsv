2009-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	Shock		is there another distro that has PAE in a 32bit desktop kernel?
2009-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	is there a reason you want to use the 32bit vs the 64?
2009-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	yes\
2009-01-30T04:54:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	care to share it?
2009-01-30T04:55:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	flash, java
2009-01-30T04:56:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	there is a beta flash package out for 64bit that works quite well (i do get errors but its only a grey flash window, all i have to do is refresh page to fix) and I believe java supports 64 bit as well
2009-01-30T04:58:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	given that i work at an online video company which coincidentally has a flash video player i kinda need a stable version of flash
2009-01-30T04:59:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	check this link out... might be worth trying... seems for the most part fairly stable, plus, you'll be ahead of the curve developing for 64bit flash ;) :http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/
2009-01-30T05:00:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	was I unclear in some way?:)
2009-01-30T05:01:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	perhaps... did you mention you have tried the adobe v10 for 64bit linux already?
2009-01-30T05:01:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	no, if it's beta i'm not installing it on my production machine
2009-01-30T05:02:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	I'm sorry, you said you were a developer... didn't realize it was a production machine
2009-01-30T05:02:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	AFAIK there's no stable 64bit java plugin

2009-01-30T05:04:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	or more directly : https://jdk6.dev.java.net/6uNea.html
2009-01-30T05:05:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	it's Early Access; it's not released as stable
2009-01-30T05:06:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	yup... just was giving a heads up in case you didn't know... so hopefully though you'll be able to get stable versions soon
2009-01-30T05:07:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	how about the windows only binary codecs? do they work on 64bit?
2009-01-30T05:09:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	that I'm not sure of... this is my home cpu so I'm running the 64bit beta's... sorry
2009-01-30T05:09:00.000Z	gbear142751	Shock	wait... was that sarcastic?
2009-01-30T05:10:00.000Z	Shock	gbear142751	no, i'm genuinely interested; i need those to work before i can switch
