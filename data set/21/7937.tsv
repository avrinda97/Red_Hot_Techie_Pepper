2006-12-23T11:39:00.000Z	h3xis	chimaera	right click on them and click "remove from panel". then right click on the panel again and click "add to panel" and from there find "gnome menu" or something and it'll just give you the foot

2006-12-23T12:05:00.000Z	h3xis	chimaera	then that's treating it as a hard drive

2006-12-23T14:50:00.000Z	h3xis	chimaera	/etc/init.d/samba restart? i think?
