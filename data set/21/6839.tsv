2007-02-10T12:12:00.000Z	sparr		does ubuntu have non-release-named package repositories?  like debian has releases 'sarge' 'potato' 'etch', but it also has moving windows 'stable' 'testing' 'unstable'.
2007-02-10T12:13:00.000Z	unop	sparr	 ubuntu doesnt really have them -- but dapper is considered "stable", edgy "unstable" and feisty "testing"
2007-02-10T12:14:00.000Z	sparr	unop	yeah, but that changes
2007-02-10T12:14:00.000Z	sparr	unop	i hate editing my sources
2007-02-10T12:15:00.000Z	unop	sparr	ok, for the purposes of sources.list .. we dont have anything like that
2007-02-10T13:54:00.000Z	unop	sparr	 ps u - tells you a bit about memory usage -- depending on the version of top -- changing the mode with M tells you about memory usage too
2007-02-10T13:55:00.000Z	sparr	unop	i dont need memory usage
2007-02-10T13:56:00.000Z	unop	sparr	gnome-system-monitor then :)
2007-02-10T13:57:00.000Z	sparr	unop	where do i see it in there?
2007-02-10T13:58:00.000Z	unop	sparr	 select the processes tab - then select edit -> preferences -> processes -> process fields and select "virtual memory"
2007-02-10T13:59:00.000Z	sparr	unop	i dont care how much they are using, i care how often they are using it
2007-02-10T13:59:00.000Z	sparr	unop	my gimp is using gigs of swap, but its inactive so its not paging at all
2007-02-10T14:01:00.000Z	unop	sparr	 well if gimp is being used it makes sense to try and keep most of it's working set in RAM rather than on swap .. regular swapping would cause the application to slow down, the disk to be thrashed, the computer to slow down even, etc
2007-02-10T14:01:00.000Z	sparr	unop	i know all of that
2007-02-10T14:02:00.000Z	unop	sparr	well i can never be sure who knows what eh -- just had to make sure
2007-02-10T14:03:00.000Z	sparr	unop	when im using gimp, its obvious that gimp is causing the thrash.  my problem is that sometimes i see thrash when no apps should be swapping.  so i want to find out who is at fault
2007-02-10T14:03:00.000Z	unop	sparr	 and the gnome-system-monitor does display stats in almost real-time
2007-02-10T14:06:00.000Z	unop	sparr	 20GB swap? :o thats a lot
2007-02-10T14:06:00.000Z	sparr	unop	that it is.
2007-02-10T14:07:00.000Z	sparr	unop	its striped across 1-4 drives too.  right now two sets of 2 drives
2009-05-31T23:10:00.000Z	unop	sparr	usually, you never have to reinstall (unlike with windows)
