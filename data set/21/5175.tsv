2007-12-11T04:33:00.000Z	eurowerke		I'm having a problem keeping my static ip address
2007-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	eurowerke		I set the config up in /etc/network/interfaces
2007-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	eurowerke		but as soon as the regular dhcp lease time expires, it renews to another IP address
2007-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	eurowerke		anyone have a clue?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	eurowerke		why does it time out in the first place?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	eurowerke		can't I just keep it static?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	edheldil	eurowerke	and what's the problem?
2007-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	eurowerke	edheldil	i set a static ip in network/interfaces file, but when dhcp lease time runs out, it renews to another address
2007-12-11T04:36:00.000Z	eurowerke		lol I know georgeb ;)
2007-12-11T04:36:00.000Z	eurowerke		"iface eth0 inet static"
2007-12-11T04:37:00.000Z	eurowerke		'/etc/init.d networking restart
2007-12-11T04:37:00.000Z	eurowerke		works
2007-12-11T04:37:00.000Z	eurowerke		then
2007-12-11T04:37:00.000Z	eurowerke		next day, new ip address
2007-12-11T04:38:00.000Z	eurowerke		where does dhclient get started from?
2007-12-11T04:38:00.000Z	eurowerke		it's a console only setup georgeb
2007-12-11T04:38:00.000Z	eurowerke		no Xwin
2007-12-11T04:39:00.000Z	eurowerke		yeah it is assigning the same address Pici, same address it had before I set it to static IP
2007-12-11T04:40:00.000Z	eurowerke		the static IP and the IP that was being assigned by DHCP are on 2 different subnets
2007-12-11T04:41:00.000Z	eurowerke		and the static IP is not included in the DHCP lease range
2007-12-11T04:43:00.000Z	edheldil	eurowerke	looks like you are running dhclient from somewhere ...
