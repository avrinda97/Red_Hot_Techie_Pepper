2011-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	KM0201		first, are you sure pulse audio is installed... sudo apt-get install pulse-audio
2011-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	KM0201		 ok.
2011-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	KM0201		open a terminal, and type "gstreamer-properties"
2011-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	KM0201		if it tells you you need to install gnome-media, install gnome-media
2011-07-20T04:49:00.000Z	KM0201		just gstreamer-properties   if it tells you you need gnome-media, install gnome-media
2011-07-20T04:49:00.000Z	KM0201		?
2011-07-20T04:49:00.000Z	KM0201		you should have had a window open up
2011-07-20T04:50:00.000Z	Northernen	KM0201	the use of 'sudo' or not is hardly the issue here. Just adds to the confusion.
2011-07-20T04:50:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	thats why i said not to use it
2011-07-20T04:52:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	lol, now that would be a kick int he junk
2011-07-20T05:26:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	i think !awesome should trigger the Lubuntu factoid
2011-07-20T05:26:00.000Z	Northernen	KM0201	doesn't work.
2011-07-20T05:26:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	but it should.. :)
2011-07-20T05:27:00.000Z	Northernen	KM0201	might look into that. Don't like Unity, Gnome or KDE a lot.
2011-07-20T05:27:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	it is really, really slick, and fast... i don't wannna get offtopic, but join #lubuntu if you want.
2011-07-20T05:28:00.000Z	Northernen	KM0201	has a Windows look to it, no?
2011-07-20T05:29:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	ah.. i guess sort of.. it has a menu thats kinda windows 'esque
2011-07-20T05:29:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	but thats where similarities end
2011-07-20T05:30:00.000Z	Northernen	KM0201	does it use the gnome applications?
2011-07-20T05:30:00.000Z	KM0201	Northernen	sure, if you want to install them. (ive got a few gnome apps installed) but its based on Openbox....
