2008-04-26T21:53:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	apt-get install mysql
2008-04-26T21:53:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	sorry, "apt-get install mysql-server" is the correct way.
2008-04-26T21:54:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	so whats your problem? Please prefix your messages with my name, or i wont notice them,
2008-04-26T21:55:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	"strange loop" does not work, because my name is "strange_loop". try hitting stra and then <TAB>. <TAB> will complete names.
2008-04-26T21:56:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	oh okey
2008-04-26T21:56:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	this works?
2008-04-26T21:56:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	yes.
2008-04-26T21:56:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	so the problem is that i try to install joomla
2008-04-26T21:57:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	but it says that mysql server is unavailable
2008-04-26T21:57:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	even tho i have it installed and it works
2008-04-26T21:58:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	how does joomla connect to the db?
2008-04-26T21:59:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	how can i check that ?
2008-04-26T21:59:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	well, you could get into joomla and into software development and all that. or you could ask some joomla people.
2008-04-26T22:00:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	if you dont know anything about PHP (is joomla written in PHP?) there is not much you can do on your own.
2008-04-26T22:01:00.000Z	joonas_	strange_loop	okey thanks il go find an joomla irc
2008-04-26T22:15:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	yes?
2008-04-26T22:16:00.000Z	strange_loop	joonas_	maybe lets go to another channel. #linuxhelp ?
