2005-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	Leliel_Stormhawk		sorry Discipulus, i have no idea what is cuasing it
2005-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	chris__	Leliel_Stormhawk	jes!
2005-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	Leliel_Stormhawk	chris__	see if you have a soundserver running, if you do, kill it and see if that helps
2005-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	chris__	Leliel_Stormhawk	system sounts (like pressing bkspace in terminal...)
2005-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	chris__	Leliel_Stormhawk	im running KDE
2005-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	chris__	Leliel_Stormhawk	killall esd?
2005-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	chris__		ne esd running
2005-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	Leliel_Stormhawk	chris__	there should be a way to simply kill just the server, and make it stay dead
2005-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	Leliel_Stormhawk	chris__	i don;t know much about kde, i use gnome
2005-07-04T08:15:00.000Z	Leliel_Stormhawk		however, with a oundserver running, you have to either make the apps talk through it, or kill the soundserver, since it locks the soundcard
2005-07-04T08:15:00.000Z	chris__	Leliel_Stormhawk	tried it, no changes... and on gnome it doesn't work, too
2005-07-04T08:16:00.000Z	Leliel_Stormhawk	chris__	what drivers are you using?
2005-07-04T08:16:00.000Z	chris__	Leliel_Stormhawk	drivers
