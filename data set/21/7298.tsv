2008-05-25T02:12:00.000Z	Carbonflux		Ubuntu desktop depends on it for peats sake
2008-05-25T02:12:00.000Z	Carbonflux		its nuts
2008-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	You can remove it (and remove ubuntu-desktop with it) without causing problems to your system
2008-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Flannel	what is Ubuntu-desktop ?
2008-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	Its just a metapackage
2008-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Flannel	which everything else depends on right? if I remove it trashes my system right?
2008-05-25T02:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	no, if you remove it nothing changes.
2008-05-25T02:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	metapackages depend on things, not the other way around.  Removing them will not change a single thing (well, except the package wont be installed)
2008-05-25T02:16:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Flannel	could that effect how updates work etc?
2008-05-25T02:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	u-d depends on A, B, and C.  When you install it, you install A B and C to meet the depends, but when you remove it, A B and C are still around.
2008-05-25T02:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	No.  It will be reinstalled (automatically, by update-manager) when you upgrade to Intrepid, but as for sticking with Hardy, no, nothing will change.
2008-05-25T02:16:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Flannel	did you remove it?
2008-05-25T02:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	I would have no problem removing it if I had it in the first place.
2008-05-25T02:17:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Flannel	you don't run gnome?
2008-05-25T02:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	No
2008-05-25T02:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	Its not a dependency
2008-05-25T02:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	No, removing it will make no difference to your system at all
2008-05-25T02:21:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Flannel	not until down the road when they use it as a container to trigger other updates, I can see how removing it right now might not be a problem, but down the road it will be
2008-05-25T02:22:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	No.  Like I said, only when you update to intrepid, in which case, it will be automatically reinstalled by update-manager.  *no* updates will come through ubuntu-desktop in Hardy
2008-05-25T02:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	It is
2008-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Carbonflux	#ubuntu-offtopic and we can talk all about it
