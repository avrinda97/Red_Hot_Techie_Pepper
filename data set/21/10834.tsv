2004-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux		ok so should i get the driver on floopy? Treenaks
2004-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux		btw is it possible to add a root user to ubuntu?
2004-11-01T07:10:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	'sudo passwd root'
2004-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	it is possible. follow its instructions.
2004-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	Kamion	by doing the sudo root pword command?
2004-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	yes (only spelt correctly)
2004-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	there already *is* a full root user, with uid 0
2004-11-01T07:14:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	I believe that all our documentation talks about the root account being "disabled", not "removed"
2004-11-01T07:15:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	again, the FAQ says that the root account is "disabled", not "removed".
2004-11-01T07:16:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	the header of the page says "How do I use the root account?", and goes on to give a very detailed description of what's happening.
2004-11-01T07:16:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	Kamion	i have no idea what sudo is but i do know alot about other stuff
2004-11-01T07:33:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	where is that?
2004-11-01T07:34:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	wikis are wikis, they're editable by anyone so they're sometimes wrong - give me the URL and I'll fix it
2004-11-01T07:35:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	Kamion	it the k3b one in howto
2004-11-01T07:35:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	oh, so you don't mean the wiki, you mean www.ubuntulinux.org?
2004-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	that's not the wiki.
2004-11-01T07:38:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	it matters because it makes a difference to how I fix your bug :-P
2004-11-01T07:40:00.000Z	Kamion	Ubuntu-Linux	fixed, thanks
