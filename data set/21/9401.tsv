2006-01-21T07:51:00.000Z	newuser		how can I get ubuntu to load to gui??
2006-01-21T07:51:00.000Z	newuser		I am stuck loading to terminal.
2006-01-21T07:53:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	did you do a server install?
2006-01-21T07:53:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	server install has no gui, 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' as root
2006-01-21T08:05:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	know how to recover windows from a bootloop? boots to grub, i select windows, loads windows splash screen then reboots.
2006-01-21T08:05:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	was it doing that before you installed ubuntu?
2006-01-21T08:10:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	running fine...
2006-01-21T08:10:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	don't know then.  Did you resize the ntfs partition before installing?
2006-01-21T08:11:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	used the install cd to partition the drive.
2006-01-21T08:12:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	could be that when it resized the ntfs drive, you lost some files.  Usually it's recommended you resize before installing
2006-01-21T08:13:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	i thought that is what it did. resize, make swap, install on free space...
2006-01-21T08:14:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	as I understand it, you should defragment the ntfs first so that all the data is sure to be at the beginning of the partition.  That way when it is resized. you won't lose anything.  I am just speculating here though, it may just be some windows problem
2006-01-21T08:15:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	I should be able to mount the ntfs partition to copy it to a backup drive correct?
2006-01-21T08:17:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	yeah, read what ubotu sent you (I'd recommend doing it manually)
2006-01-24T14:53:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	sudo apt-get update
2006-01-24T14:55:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	did that work?
2006-01-24T14:55:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	yes sir it did thanks.
2006-01-24T14:56:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	you shouldn't get those errors.  Maybe you modified sources.list?  Whenever you modify it by hand you have to run 'sudo apt-get update' afterwards
2006-01-24T15:03:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	system -admin - log in screen setup
2006-01-24T15:04:00.000Z	_jason	newuser	gnome-look.org has more I believe
2006-01-24T15:05:00.000Z	newuser	_jason	DOH that is where i seen it before.
