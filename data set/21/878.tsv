2011-04-26T22:49:00.000Z	LAcan	Zundrium__	but i thought it just worked like 2 mins ago...?
2011-04-26T22:49:00.000Z	Zundrium__	LAcan	Yes, the additional drivers was showing a driver installed but not in use..
2011-04-26T22:50:00.000Z	LAcan	Zundrium__	and now it shows nothing?
2011-04-26T22:50:00.000Z	Zundrium__	LAcan	I uninstalled the nvidia packages with the package manager

2011-04-26T22:51:00.000Z	LAcan	Zundrium__	remeber the golden rule: DO IT THROUH THE GUI.
