2011-07-06T09:12:00.000Z	DriversBroken		anyone got a working w7, can burn a disk, rip the iso off and send it to me?
2011-07-06T09:13:00.000Z	DriversBroken		nightlonewolf, this is the help channel, so everyone here is either helping or is having a ton of trouble :(
2011-07-06T09:14:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	there are no FOSS utilities that can repair NTFS at that level.
2011-07-06T09:14:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 I don't care about foss only tbh
2011-07-06T09:15:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	i mean there are no free (as in anything) programs that run on Ubuntu that will fix your issue.
2011-07-06T09:16:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	if your NTFS is really that borked, you'll be lucky to fix it at all. try BartPE or Hirens. failing those, I would thank the lord that I had a good, recent backup of everything on my machine, reinstall, and go from there.
2011-07-06T09:17:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 I have no backup.  This is my mom's disk :(
2011-07-06T09:18:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 highly unlikely, right?  Much more likely that the heavy io workload just pushed a dying drive over the brink...
2011-07-06T09:19:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	- most likely is the drive simply got really sick and tired of being forced to run Windows all the damn time, and died on purpose just to inflict some misery back on you people.
2011-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 Well, that can't be right, I was using natty live the days before it died to fix my disk :P
2011-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	- but anyway, you can also find some hope in the PhotoRec/TestDisk - http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download
2011-07-06T09:21:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	- in that case I would say it is your fault for introducing linux to your mom's computer, and showing it what it COULD have been running all these years. no wonder it lost all will to live.
2011-07-06T09:21:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	it's like living until age 85, only then to discover sex.
2011-07-06T09:22:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 She actually thinks that linux broke her comp, to be perfectly serious.
2011-07-06T09:23:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	- i know she's serious about that. it isn't her fault, she has no idea how computers work. to her, it seems logical. we know better, but there'll be no convincing her of that. this is why you never say the word "Linux" to an inexperienced/non-technical user.
2011-07-06T09:23:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 And what is worse is that she programs c for a living and was angry at me because she couldn't remote desktop in to her vim prompt.
2011-07-06T09:25:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 it's partly warranted, because this thing where linux = terminal still exists.
2011-07-06T09:26:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	Linux is a great OS, but the FUD has overpowered the community's ability to describe it favorably.
2011-07-06T09:29:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	likely, you tried to do some kind of advanced triple somersault maneuver with GParted and it killed her partition table.
2011-07-06T09:30:00.000Z	DriversBroken	vexati0n	 lol wut, it was broken before I opened gparted
2011-07-06T09:30:00.000Z	vexati0n	DriversBroken	you never know what is going to make NTFS keel over.
