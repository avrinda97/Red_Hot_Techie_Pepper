2009-12-08T01:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Alan502	an unknown error is happening. Which is pretty much the worst kind of error as it gives you no information about what is happening :(
2009-12-08T01:40:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	i lost my wireless after playing with aircrack :(
2009-12-08T01:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Alan502	reboot didn't help?
2009-12-08T01:41:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	nope
2009-12-08T01:41:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	i have already restarted and disabled monitor mode
2009-12-08T01:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Alan502	what kind of wireless card/chip is it?
2009-12-08T01:43:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	its a built in wireless card, linux mobile motherboard
2009-12-08T01:43:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	sorry not linux, intel
2009-12-08T01:45:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	still here
2009-12-08T01:46:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	i just noticed that my wireless does not work in ANY of my linux distributions installed, just windows!
2009-12-08T01:46:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	could it be a kernel problem?
2009-12-08T01:46:00.000Z	Seveas	Alan502	a quick google doesn't show anything promising
2009-12-08T01:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Alan502	so I'm afraid I won't be able to help you any further, sorry
2009-12-08T03:05:00.000Z	Seveas	Alan502	does it have decent python support?
2009-12-08T03:06:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	it does not have a python support actually
2009-12-08T03:06:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	but for java and C++ is awesome
2009-12-08T03:06:00.000Z	Alan502	Seveas	hadent looked if netbeans has a python plugin tho
