2007-05-04T10:20:00.000Z	graft		hi, how do i get single-window mode to work in firefox 2.0?
2007-05-04T10:20:00.000Z	graft		this has been annoying me for months
2007-05-04T10:20:00.000Z	sipior	graft	what's single window mode?
2007-05-04T10:21:00.000Z	graft	sipior	open new windows in tabs instead
2007-05-04T10:21:00.000Z	graft	sipior	i.e., firefox never opens a new window, ever
2007-05-04T10:21:00.000Z	sipior	graft	that's how mine runs, the preferences didn't do it for you?
2007-05-04T10:21:00.000Z	graft	sipior	nope.
2007-05-04T10:22:00.000Z	sipior	graft	you have "New pages should be opened in: a new tab", and it doesn't?
2007-05-04T10:23:00.000Z	graft	sipior	yep. some situations it opens a new tab, but others it does not (it opens a new window)
2007-05-04T10:23:00.000Z	sipior	graft	and those situations are?
2007-05-04T10:24:00.000Z	graft	sipior	uncertain. i think when there's an explicit tag asking for a new window
2007-05-04T10:24:00.000Z	graft	sipior	e.g. 'download' links in gmail
2007-05-04T10:24:00.000Z	graft	sipior	or this 'open as a google spreadsheet' link was the one that currently annoyed me
2007-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	sipior	graft	hmmm...odd. maybe play with about:config, see if anything there helps?
2007-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	graft	sipior	any suggestions what i should play with there?
2007-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	sipior	graft	i also have opentabfor.middleclick set to true
2007-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	sipior	graft	search for tab :)
2007-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	graft	sipior	yeah i have that set to true as well
2007-05-04T10:35:00.000Z	graft	sipior	found it - it's browser.link.open_newwindow in about:config
2007-05-04T10:35:00.000Z	graft	sipior	you'd think the stupid preferences would deal with that case...
2007-05-04T10:35:00.000Z	sipior	graft	yeah, glad you found it, and now i'll write it down...
