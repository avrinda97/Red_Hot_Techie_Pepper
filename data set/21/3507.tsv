2010-09-28T08:44:00.000Z	khider		Greetings all, I had a kernel upgrade today and lost audio. How do I get audio back?
2010-09-28T08:45:00.000Z	khider		The machine recognizes my soundcards, I just cannot get it to playback audio
2010-09-28T08:46:00.000Z	maco	khider	soundcards plural?
2010-09-28T08:47:00.000Z	maco	khider	do you have pavucontrol installed? itll let you pick which soundcard apps try to play out of
2010-09-28T08:48:00.000Z	khider	maco	I do have it, but nothing pops up when I click it
2010-09-28T08:48:00.000Z	maco	khider	try running pavucontrol in the terminal. a window should open
2010-09-28T08:49:00.000Z	khider	maco	Shows no cards available for configuration--it was 100% beofre the kernel upgarde...
2010-09-28T08:50:00.000Z	maco	khider	there are no devices in the output or playback tab?
2010-09-28T08:50:00.000Z	khider	maco	Precisely
2010-09-28T08:51:00.000Z	khider	maco	I have two soundcards, nvidia and another one...
2010-09-28T08:52:00.000Z	khider	maco	Any idea how I can get it to recognize the devices?
2010-09-28T08:53:00.000Z	maco	khider	but it worked on an old kernel? try rebooting into the old kernel then
2010-09-28T08:53:00.000Z	khider	maco	How?
2010-09-28T08:53:00.000Z	maco	khider	during boot hold shift and use the arrow keys
2010-09-28T08:54:00.000Z	khider	maco	And the kernel options will pop up?
2010-09-28T08:54:00.000Z	khider		Because now I just boot straight into the GUI
2010-09-28T08:54:00.000Z	maco	khider	shift will give you the list of kernels. use the down key to go the 3rd one (first is your current kernel, 2nd is current kernel's recovery mode, 3rd is previous kernel, etc.)
2010-09-28T08:55:00.000Z	khider	maco	 What do you suppose the issue is?
2010-09-28T08:55:00.000Z	khider	maco	Kernel is not up to snuff yet?
2010-09-28T08:55:00.000Z	maco	khider	could be a broken kernel update
2010-09-28T08:55:00.000Z	khider	maco	Would not be the first time. Thanks!
