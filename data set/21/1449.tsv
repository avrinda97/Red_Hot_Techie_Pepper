2010-10-24T04:51:00.000Z	Kai696		Hey there, I'm trying to mount a sata/usb adapter NTFS drive.. how do I go about doing that? I figured sudo mount /dev/sdd /mnt but it needed more tags
2010-10-24T04:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	sdd is the entire drive, you want to mount a partition like sdd1
2010-10-24T04:52:00.000Z	Kai696	Jordan_U	is it set as sdd1 as default? or is there a way to check? (thx btw !)
2010-10-24T04:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	"sudo blkid" will list all your partions, with information about each.

2010-10-24T04:57:00.000Z	Kai696		It's not showing up in that Jordan_U as per the pastebin post
2010-10-24T04:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	If that's the entire output from "sudo fdisk -l" then that drive doesn't appear to have any partition table.

2010-10-24T04:59:00.000Z	Kai696		- the I lol
2010-10-24T05:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	Lines 22-27 don't show anything about any partitions, are you sure that is the complete output of "sudo fdisk -l"?

2010-10-24T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	That disk does not appear to have a partition table. Was it part of a raid array? Are you able to use it on any other machine?
2010-10-24T05:03:00.000Z	Kai696	Jordan_U	MBR won't boot so we can live- disk and it works fine, I'm just trying to pull some files off of it.. not sure specifically how to answer your question though ?? by itself the OS is useless however
2010-10-24T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	Could you please rephrase that using complete sentences and proper punctuation? I can't understand your last comment at all.
2010-10-24T05:04:00.000Z	Kai696	Jordan_U	then rephrase your question please
2010-10-24T05:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	Have you ever been able to use this drive in any other OS / machine? If so, can you still use the drive in said OS/machine?
2010-10-24T05:06:00.000Z	Kai696	Jordan_U	yes, but recently it suffered a crash due to MBR. We CAN use it in a laptop with a Live ubuntu disk.. the drive is pretty well gone however and I don't forsee it being able to be used in the future though.. I'm not a PC expert so I can't really say for sure though :P In the past, it WAS able to be used, then suffered a crash, and now isn't in short... >< wow I made that more complicated than it should have been lol sorry

2010-10-24T05:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	If the hardware is dying, and you have space on another drive to make a full image of the damaged drive, then I would recommend using GNU ddrescue (from the "gddrescue" package, *not* the "ddrescue" package) to make an image of the drive before doing anything else.
2010-10-24T05:11:00.000Z	Kai696	Jordan_U	 I can do that.
2010-10-24T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kai696	Do that then. If you're lucky, ddrescue will be able to recover the data from the mbr, and most of the rest of the block on the drive, and you'll be able to just mount the image and read files off it that way. If not, then I would first try rebuilding the mbr (of the image) with testdisk, and if after doing that you still can't mount the filesystem use photorec to recover as many files as possible.
