2007-05-16T08:50:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		my text install has been stuck at 18% for 15-20 minutes now
2007-05-16T08:50:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		what must i do+
2007-05-16T08:50:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		?
2007-05-16T08:51:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	wait, or restart
2007-05-16T08:53:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	i worry that it will stop at 18percent in future attempts
2007-05-16T08:53:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	if the CD passes the verification, then you may want to try again, elsewise post a bug with output from lspci (so we know your hardware)
2007-05-16T08:54:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	not likely
2007-05-16T08:54:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	can i get output from lspci if i can't get ubuntu installed in the first place?
2007-05-16T08:54:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	can you boot the livecd?
2007-05-16T08:55:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	i'm using altenarte install
2007-05-16T08:55:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	not likely then, you should search for install bugs with your hardware.
2007-05-16T08:56:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	 what are you referring to in"not likely then"?
2007-05-16T08:56:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	not likely to get the livecd booted and get lspci.
2007-05-16T08:58:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	If I were you, Id check the cd integrity first, then concern yourself with the problem if it doesnt fail.
2007-05-16T08:59:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	i have. CD integrity shows prefect.\
2007-05-16T09:01:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	I suggest you make a list of all your hardware, and verify it has out of the box support in ubuntu
2007-05-16T09:06:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	choose the ones your screen and video card support
2007-05-16T09:07:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	i don't know what my screen and video card supports. i assumed that whatever the text install screen shows is supported. or am i assuming wrongly?
2007-05-16T09:07:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	your assuming pretty correctly, just leave those, it can be changed later without issue
2007-05-16T09:08:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	macd	ok. i sure hope i can use better resolutions later on. I'll do as you say and leave the boxes untouched
2007-05-16T09:09:00.000Z	macd	SickOfWindows	chances are, to use the higher ones, you'll need to install the closed source drivers, if its an ATI/Nvidia based card.
