2006-11-05T16:03:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	Yes.
2006-11-05T16:03:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	Yes.
2006-11-05T16:03:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	how do i do that
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	Are you now using ubuntu or kubuntu?
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	ubuntu
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2006-11-05T16:05:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	Only that your KDE applications will be cluttering your gnome menus and vice versa
2006-11-05T16:06:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	Yes
2006-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	yes?!?
2006-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	You just want the applications not cluttering menus right?
2006-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	yep!
2006-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	There is a tutorial, looking for the link now...
2006-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/13/ubuntu-to-kubuntu-keeping-the-menus-clean/
2006-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	cool, thanks
2006-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	np
2006-11-05T16:21:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	yes, but only if it is the alternative CD ( text mode installer )
2006-11-05T16:22:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	hmmm, ok!
2006-11-05T16:22:00.000Z	trogdoor	zsh	Although there is a chance you can use the liveCD also I don't think you can.
2006-11-05T16:23:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	i have the kubuntu 6.06 live cd and i'm running ubuntu edgy, hmmmm....
2006-11-05T16:25:00.000Z	zsh	trogdoor	i'll try, if i break something i can always come back.. :)
