2010-09-11T10:54:00.000Z	ServerTechPro		Using sudo always returns an error "sudo: must be setuid root"
2010-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	is your user in the sudoers file?
2010-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	what do you mean
2010-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	usually if sudo gives an error it's cos the user isn't authenticated to have sudoers access
2010-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	verify that your user is listed in /etc/sudoers
2010-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	Only user previlege specification : root ALL=(ALL) ALL
2010-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	in sudoers you want your user added
2010-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	it should loook: USER_NAME   ALL=(ALL) ALL
2010-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	where username represents your user
2010-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	I dont have admin in User settings, its not letting me authenticate
2010-09-11T11:03:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	that would do it too, the gui end just puts you in sudoers
2010-09-11T11:03:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	do you have another user naem that was generated when you installed ubuntu?
2010-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	I guess the user previlege is shown as custom
2010-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	I need to change it to admin, but its not letting me authenticate
2010-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	can i use root
2010-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	are you using another user beyond what was set up on install, though? Cos usually your default is set sudoers authenticated... And root can be used, but you'd need to be able to access sudoers before that's an option really.
2010-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	an unahtenticated user cannot gain access without su'ing to a user with proper permissions
2010-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	i have many users
2010-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	i think it is not recognising my user as an admin
2010-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	ServerTechPro	I'd go to your first user; your initial one from install, and set your current user as admin/sudoers
2010-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	ServerTechPro	wizzzzzzard	so i need to use root to change it somehow
