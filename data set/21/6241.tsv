2007-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	brydon	Very strange. Do you have a very old / very new video card? strange monitor?

2007-05-03T12:03:00.000Z	Stormx2	brydon	Please condense all your posts into one. You're more likely to get help then
2007-05-03T12:04:00.000Z	brydon	Stormx2	you mean repost as new topic?
2007-05-03T12:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	brydon	No. Incorporate all your posts into the first post, then delete them
2007-05-03T12:05:00.000Z	Stormx2	brydon	Did the live cd exhibit this behavior?
2007-05-03T12:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	brydon	Should have done. Did you use the alt cd for installing, then?
2007-05-03T12:07:00.000Z	brydon	Stormx2	Yes, I thought I need that for raid support
2007-05-03T12:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	brydon	i don't know, really
