2010-09-30T21:52:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	what's the problem?
2010-09-30T21:55:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	 hmm.  only thing I can think to check right now is that it shows up in your bios
2010-09-30T21:56:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	 you're installing a server so no livecd.  dunno, I've never seen that before
2010-09-30T21:56:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	changed cables (power and SATA).  I'm thinking about taking the computer to local repairs to test the power source.
2010-09-30T21:57:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	 I'm installing desktop-10.4-amd64
2010-09-30T21:57:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	don't know why I thought server, have you booted into the livecd or just into the install?
2010-09-30T21:58:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	I've booted with a 10.10 USB and a 10.04 when that wasn't installing.  (I'm in 10.04 now)
2010-09-30T21:59:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	 but are you booting into the installer or the live version?  (does 10.04 even have a "just install" option?)
2010-09-30T21:59:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	i've done both.
2010-09-30T22:03:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	 not sure at this point, maybe while in the live version popup gparted or fdisk and see if you can find the drive at all.  Check if it's in /dev/...
2010-09-30T22:04:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	 I have already partitioned the drive with gparted
2010-09-30T22:10:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	don't know what to tell ya, maybe the installer can't find it because you have it mounted?  even so...
2010-09-30T22:10:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	I know.  bizarre problem.
2010-09-30T22:11:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	hard drive settings somehow?  partition table broken?
2010-09-30T22:12:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	blkid turns in good info on /dev/sda
2010-09-30T22:13:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	the drive was being used for swap.... maybe that was the problem.
2010-09-30T22:15:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	nope. still not listed
2010-09-30T22:18:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	 figure it out or just that it has made life hell?
2010-09-30T22:20:00.000Z	mr_mead	zego	 I haven't figured it out yet. But setting up partitions is so simple with gparted.  What is the partition table type supposed to be? msdos?
2010-09-30T22:20:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	 not sure, default always worked for me in the past
2010-09-30T22:22:00.000Z	zego	mr_mead	mmhmm....why isn't that the default anymore.  Technically you could just wipe the drive, install ubuntu, and setup the partitions after it's working
