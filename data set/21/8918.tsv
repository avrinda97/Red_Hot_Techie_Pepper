2005-12-17T16:24:00.000Z	qt2		Quick question, does ubuntu's lilo install autoboot a kernel after an amount of time?
2005-12-17T16:25:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	it uses grub
2005-12-17T16:25:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	and yes it  defaults to 10 seconds
2005-12-17T16:25:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	yes, by default it does, however, grub didnt work on the pc i was working on, so lilo had to be installed instead.
2005-12-17T16:25:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	oh makes sense
2005-12-17T16:26:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	i knew grub did, was wondering about lilo.
2005-12-17T16:27:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	in your lilo.conf theres a line delay = <number>
2005-12-17T16:27:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	that shows the delay in tenths of seconds
2005-12-17T16:27:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	so 50 = 5 seconds etc.
2005-12-17T16:29:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	i'm trying to get lilo set up to autoboot to the desktop after a restart. ;)
2005-12-17T16:33:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	yes
2005-12-17T16:33:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	cool.
2005-12-17T16:35:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	and it's my understanding that if i check the "log in a user automatically on first bootup" and choose a name, that it will automatically log me into the desktop?
2005-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	yes you can have gdm automatically bypass the login screen and just go straight to desktop
2005-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	System > Administration > Login Screen Setup is where you can configure it.
2005-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	shouldnt it require me to input a password somewhere? o.O
2005-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	i know, i already did.
2005-12-17T16:37:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	you can have it automatically select a user and you just have to input the password, yes
2005-12-17T16:37:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	err would i be able to start up vnc to enter that password?
2005-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	qt2	_Gray_	or does the remote desktop client not start till after the password has been entered?
2005-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	_Gray_	qt2	I haven;t used vnc in ages sorry.
