2012-01-05T07:24:00.000Z	AZora		So what's a good distro these days? I'm considering going back to Debian or trying Mint.
2012-01-05T07:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	minmt is based on ubuntu, so you arent't really trying much different
2012-01-05T07:30:00.000Z	AZora	ActionParsnip	dannel I like Ubuntu, but I hate dashboards, I hate automatic uninstalls of software due to a lack of package in canonical, I hate feeling like I have less control over my distro.
2012-01-05T07:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	how do you mean 'dashboards'?
2012-01-05T07:33:00.000Z	AZora	ActionParsnip	Win7, Mac, Ubuntu 11.10 all have dashboards. H8h8h8h8h8h8h8H*H*H*H*H*
2012-01-05T07:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	that doesn't inform me. Where is the 'dashboard' in ubuntu?
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	do you mean 'dock'
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	AZora	ActionParsnip	I like the old school task bar and menu. I don't like the start menu in WinXP, I always use classic mode on Windows. I don't like the 11.10 menu system in ubuntu. The menu system I do like WAS REMOVED in 11.10 so I refuse to upgrade
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	oh you mean PANEL
2012-01-05T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	you can hack gnome3 to look like Gnome2, or install xfce4 and use xfce session
2012-01-05T07:35:00.000Z	AZora	ActionParsnip	yeah the terminology varies by who you're talking to drastically. 'Dashboard' appears to be the most common cross platform term I've found
2012-01-05T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	in ubuntu, its a panel, lxpanel, gnome-panel
2012-01-05T07:35:00.000Z	AZora	ActionParsnip	I looked up the directions on how to do it: "Step 1: DON'T DO IT"
2012-01-05T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	Go for xfce4, it looks and smells like Gnome2
2012-01-05T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	dashboard appears to be a file search tool
2012-01-05T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	java is being uninstalled due to license
2012-01-05T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	if you manually install, it won't be removed as its not in the packages :)
2012-01-05T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	if you use 32bit Ubuntu I can give you a script to install 32bit oracle java 1.7_02
2012-01-05T07:41:00.000Z	AZora	ActionParsnip	that's ok I hacked my /etc/apt/sources.list to all hell already.
2012-01-05T07:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	its not a package, java 1.7 can no longer be packaged due to license
2012-01-05T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AZora	Lubuntu and Xubuntu UIs are largely unchanged
