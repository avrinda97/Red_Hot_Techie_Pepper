2007-06-10T05:40:00.000Z	omegacenti		If I wanted to start being an activist  in the sense of getting Game publishers to try releasing linux binaries for games, where should I start?
2007-06-10T05:42:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	omegacenti	 Game publishers publish where the money is.  TO get more linux games, buy linux games.

2007-06-10T07:56:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	omegacenti	I only use it when I need it, i.e. I broke the gui or I'm on a server.  for that it works skippily.
