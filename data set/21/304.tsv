2012-06-22T00:14:00.000Z	i7c		my (new) notebook's battery is sucked empty in no time on ubuntu. i had the suspicion that it uses the NVIDIA card instead of the power-saving intel graphix. but when i start nvidia x server settings it tells me nvidia driver is not used atm... any other ideas why it is empty so fast?
2012-06-22T00:15:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	What laptop?
2012-06-22T00:15:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	Dell XPS L502X
2012-06-22T00:16:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	Make sure you have the proprietary (nVidia's) drivers, not the Nouveau junkware.
2012-06-22T00:16:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	mhm how can i make sure? ;)
2012-06-22T00:17:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	Check if the "nvidia-current" package is installed, unless you have installed it manually, from the NV website
2012-06-22T00:18:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	The open-source drivers suck terribly when it comes to the power management.
2012-06-22T00:19:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	i see. i didn't install anything. i just installed ubuntu and it worked already... so i have to change that i guess?
2012-06-22T00:20:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	 Seems like it's already installed.
2012-06-22T00:21:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	mhm ok. well it was the very first time i unplugged the charger... maybe it's because of that?
2012-06-22T00:23:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	Another thing work checking are the "Bumblebee" and "Ironhide" projects - unofficial implementations of Nvidia Optimus.
2012-06-22T00:24:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	 Unfortunately i can't help with them, since i don't even have a laptop.
2012-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	i just read about bumblebee yes. nvidia optimus is still not implemented by the drivers?
2012-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	No. It was not until just recently that nVidia has decided to bring the technology to Linux.
2012-06-22T00:27:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	i see. thx for your help!
2012-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	yeh. well Linus said it some days ago. nvidia is one of the worst company to work with
2012-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	This time it's the Linux dudes, not NV, who makes problems (ideological).
2012-06-22T00:33:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	anybody always has a problem :-/
2012-06-22T01:04:00.000Z	Galvatron	i7c	Just forget this graphical installation helper
2012-06-22T01:05:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	ok :)
2012-06-22T01:07:00.000Z	i7c	Galvatron	awesome, it works :) thx again!!
