2008-02-29T04:05:00.000Z	nosto		i know you all just loooove when people coming in and firing questions.
2008-02-29T04:05:00.000Z	nosto		Could anyone assist me with an audio issue I am having?
2008-02-29T04:05:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	we live for it ;)
2008-02-29T04:06:00.000Z	nosto	Slart	I am trying to get my microphone to pick up sound so that i can use ventrilo via wine
2008-02-29T04:06:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	it works in native applications?
2008-02-29T04:07:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	I think the sound recorder in gnome is one of the worst pieces of.... white fluff ... phew.. got to breathe a bit here...
2008-02-29T04:07:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	try something else... let me have a look
2008-02-29T04:15:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	ok.. open the volume manager
2008-02-29T04:09:00.000Z	nosto	Slart	did you run away?
2008-02-29T04:09:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	nope.. still here... trying to find something easy for recording
2008-02-29T04:11:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	I'm not sure what wine can and can't do when it comes to sound..
2008-02-29T04:12:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	ok, go to System, Preferences, Sound
2008-02-29T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	and look at the thingy called Sound Capture.. what is it set to?
2008-02-29T04:14:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	try setting it to Alsa instead
2008-02-29T04:14:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	yup.. I get that too.. can you record now? using sound recorder
2008-02-29T04:15:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	select the recording page
2008-07-20T23:55:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	I don't think that's a good idea..
2008-07-20T23:55:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	wine comes with it's own directx libraries and such installed by default
2008-07-20T23:56:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	installing some kind of windows driver on top of that won't make it work better.. if anything it will break stuff
2008-07-20T23:57:00.000Z	Slart	nosto	sure.. if you somehow manage to install directx9 go ahead.. more power to you
