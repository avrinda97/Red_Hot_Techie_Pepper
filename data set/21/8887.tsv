2005-12-24T07:23:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	Warty.
2005-12-24T07:24:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	I did changed all the instances of warty to Hoary in sources list, ran apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade then I rebooted, what did i do wrong
2005-12-24T07:24:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	What happened wrong?
2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	everything seemed to work fine
2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	You didn't do anything wrong.
2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	That's what you're supposed to do.
2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	Take a breath of relief.
2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	so why am i still on warty?
2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	You aren't.
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	but he said to run lsb_release -r, and i did and it says 4.10
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	If you've done a dist-upgrade, you HAVE upgraded.
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	Odd, it should say 5.04.
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	I bet I know why.
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	yea thats why I want to know what happened
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	Because you installed 4.10, and upgrading doesn't change that part.
2005-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	and doesnt Hoary have 3 menus in gnome not 2?
2005-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	Yes.
2005-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	I'm actually not sure why that didn't upgrade.
2005-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	KarupT	theblue	yea then im still on warty cause I have 2 Menu's Applications, and Computer, well and the lil foot
2005-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	theblue	KarupT	Well, I wish I could be of more help, but I really can't.
