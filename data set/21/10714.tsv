2005-07-27T14:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	no it is not and I clearly answered why not to use marilliat and provided a different option
2005-07-27T14:53:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	You told portahex. Why didn't you answer the original question that he answered (wrongly) if you know the answer and have time to type it out?
2005-07-27T14:54:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	I can in the middle of dispute. I only mentioned hoary-extras, because it provides marilliat for hoary
2005-07-27T14:54:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	I'm well aware of that.
2005-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	the livdvdcss question?
2005-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	_Yes_.
2005-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	hoary-extras provides that
2005-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	_I_ _KNOW_.
2005-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	ok
2005-08-09T14:47:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	There is? Based on d-i?
2005-08-09T14:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	the server install will still be d-i
2005-08-09T14:48:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	the new installer will unify the live and install cds
2005-08-09T14:48:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	...and they're not implementing the desktop one as a d-i frontend?
2005-08-09T14:49:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	That's fairly insane, but oh well.
2005-08-09T14:49:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	why?
2005-08-09T14:50:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	Because d-i was designed with multiple frontends in mind. But I suppose putting it atop the livecd will work.
2005-08-09T14:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	I was there in Mataro when we discussed X on d-i. It would not be pretty
2005-08-09T14:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	plus you get one cd
2005-08-09T14:50:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	Hmm, not pretty eh? Whoops.
2005-08-09T14:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	resiak	what works on some hardware wouldn't work on others
2005-08-09T14:51:00.000Z	resiak	Burgundavia	Eenteresting.
