2006-04-25T07:51:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	check the serpentine package
2006-04-25T07:52:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	i think this is the nautilus embeded burner
2006-05-03T09:38:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	try doing "dpkg --list | grep libltdl"
2006-05-03T09:38:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	I have a package installed on my machine by that name
2006-05-03T09:39:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	thanks :)
2006-05-03T09:39:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	np :-)
2006-05-03T09:42:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	how can i get an update of that file? "libltdl.so.1" this is the one i have but i need number 3 "libltdl.so.3" :(
2006-05-03T09:42:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	I am really not sure. If it is not uptodate in the repositories, you might need to manually download it, and probably compile from source or something like that.
2006-05-03T09:43:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	thanks, then i continue searching :)
2006-05-03T09:44:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	Hang on, my machine has libltdl.so.3.1.0
2006-05-03T09:44:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	Are you sure you are running the most up to date system?
2006-05-03T09:45:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	what did dpkg --list | grep libltdl3 return?
2006-05-03T09:46:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	:( nothing
2006-05-03T09:46:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	In my machine, it said the package name is libltdl3. I then did "dpkg --listfiles libltdl3"
2006-05-03T09:46:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	probably you could do "sudo apt-cache search libltdl3"
2006-05-03T09:47:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	it returned me two lines, with info
2006-05-03T09:48:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	Don't paste here, paste on some pasteboard or something. And send me the URL ..
2006-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	eneried	harisund	i think i can do sudo apt-get install those packages? one is the package and second is the -dev :)
2006-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	that would be great. Yes, you can install them using apt-get
2006-05-03T09:50:00.000Z	harisund	eneried	Yay ! Good for you ..
