2009-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	truepurple		Ok, if I were to use a sdd drive, or a basic drive, just for a little while, which would you use, netinstall or live?
2009-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	truepurple		WHat is MO?
2009-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	truepurple		This would run off the flash drive
2009-11-28T05:50:00.000Z	truepurple		So reading doesnt wear it much, just writting does?
2009-11-28T05:50:00.000Z	truepurple		CD-RW you mean, since CD-r doesnt compare.
2009-11-28T05:52:00.000Z	truepurple		A flash drive would still have more rewrites in it the a rewrite disk, right?
2009-11-28T05:52:00.000Z	truepurple		yes
2009-11-28T05:53:00.000Z	truepurple		Is live a slower way for the program to run then netinstall?
2009-11-28T05:54:00.000Z	truepurple		So the difference is, netinstall loads drivers too, while live doesn't?
2009-11-28T05:55:00.000Z	truepurple		Gah, I still don't understand the difference between the two
2009-11-28T05:55:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	also the live can bring up the GUI installer faster.
2009-11-28T05:55:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	the netinstaller requires more work to get to the gui.
2009-11-28T05:55:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	assuming you care.
2009-11-28T05:57:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	smaller CD.
2009-11-28T05:58:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	on the CD, yes.
2009-11-28T05:58:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	consider how big of a file you'll need to download and burn.
2009-11-28T06:00:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	on debian, the installer requires 6 CDs (same for RedHat). netinst takes ~300MB and one CD on Debian.
2009-11-28T06:01:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	are you gonna keep misreading what ppl say repeatedly?
2009-11-28T06:01:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	do you want to misunderstand/
2009-11-28T06:02:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	i technically didn't mention the live.
2009-11-28T06:02:00.000Z	tabris|away	truepurple	i just meant to say that the netinst disc is SMALL. fits on a mini-cd i think.
