2007-12-09T10:45:00.000Z	bullgard4		kern.log prints on (almost) every line two timestamps. What do they refer to?
2007-12-09T10:47:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	can you give an example of two timestamps?  usually 1 time stamp,  like Dec 1 20:30:20 in my logs
2007-12-09T10:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	mom
2007-12-09T10:50:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	mom is your example?
2007-12-09T10:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	"Dec 9 05:45:03 MD97600 kernel: [65786.900000] ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1f.2 disabled"
2007-12-09T10:52:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	thats 1 timestamp, Dec 9 05:45:03 = Dec 9 5:45 A.M
2007-12-09T10:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	No there are two. The other one is [65786.900000].
2007-12-09T14:25:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	like I said, 1 time stamp the other numbers refer probably to a specific location, #linux-kernel. Your "mom"comment I don't care for,thanks
2007-12-09T14:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	In one line there are two time-stamps. Full stop. Have you ever analyzed dmesg?  --  Why do you mention '#linux-kernel'?
2007-12-09T14:30:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	 [16.094052] is not a time stamp, its common sense why i referred you to #linux-kernel for a kernel.log question
2007-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	What is  [16.094052] then, if it is no time-stamp?
2007-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	the output of dmesg does not contain any timestamps what so ever
2007-12-09T14:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	Common sense has led many people in false directions. I have checked the activity in #linux-kernel. It appears to me that you have not.
2007-12-09T14:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	Can you prove your statement.
2007-12-09T14:34:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	prove what? that dmesg does not contain time stamps?
2007-12-09T14:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	yes.
2007-12-09T14:35:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	do you want people to help you or would you rather question there answers?
2007-12-09T14:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	Please prove your statement that dmesg does not contain timestamps.
2007-12-09T14:37:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	prove it to you? It simply does not contain timestamps
2007-12-09T14:39:00.000Z	bullgard4	buttercups	Tell me what the information content of  [16.094052] is.
2007-12-09T14:39:00.000Z	buttercups	bullgard4	kern.log does , dmesg does not include them in the output
