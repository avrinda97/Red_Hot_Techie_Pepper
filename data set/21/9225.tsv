2005-10-20T10:16:00.000Z	honey		so, can i ask an initial question please. how stable/sane/supported is universe and multiverse considered?
2005-10-20T10:18:00.000Z	honey		no.. answer :)
2005-10-20T10:18:00.000Z	honey		(this channel's too big :) )
2005-10-20T10:18:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	no it's not
2005-10-20T10:18:00.000Z	honey	WhiteRabbit	hello again. oh, it's just that my question got lost in the mist
2005-10-20T10:19:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	lol more people here than the redroom of losers lol
2005-10-20T10:19:00.000Z	honey	WhiteRabbit	now now. it's not good publicity to slag off other distros :)
2005-10-20T10:19:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	what was the questions
2005-10-20T10:19:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	I said redroom! lol
2005-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	well it's all in all what you grab from those areas
2005-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	I never have any trouble with multiverse
2005-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	honey	WhiteRabbit	hm. ok, so generally if i want stability best to not enable them by default WhiteRabbit ?
2005-10-20T10:22:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	well if your a seasoned user & know what your doin you will be fine to use them
2005-10-20T10:22:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	just don't do your daily core updates with them enabled
2005-10-20T10:22:00.000Z	honey	WhiteRabbit	seasoned (a decade) linux user, not seasoned debianite
2005-10-20T10:23:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	& update the universe seperately so you can watch for whats in the update path
2005-10-20T10:23:00.000Z	honey	WhiteRabbit	right, that's what i wanted to know. so their stability is a bit like the third-party fedora repos i guess
2005-10-20T10:23:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	just as good if not better than MrClickhappys repo lol
2005-10-20T10:24:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	honey	but there is SO SO SO much that it can become a drug add slow from the universe & your fine
