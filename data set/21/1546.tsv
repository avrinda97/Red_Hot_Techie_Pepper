2011-03-02T03:58:00.000Z	daniel_tree		I am following this post http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/install-gnome-shell-from-git-in-ubuntu.html to install the latest version of gnome 3 and I got the "possible error #2 "
2011-03-02T03:58:00.000Z	daniel_tree		and when git clone git://git.gnome.org/libnotify  I get fatal: destination path 'libnotify' already exists and is not an empty directory.
2011-03-02T03:58:00.000Z	daniel_tree		how can I fix that and move on ??
2011-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	why are you doing this ?
2011-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	it makes your machine totally impossible to support
2011-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	daniel_tree	ikonia	I am curious to try it out
2011-03-02T04:00:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	it's not something you can "try" it won't be possible to undo it very easy and will make your machine totally impossible to support
2011-03-02T04:00:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	plus it really sounds like you don't know what you're doing and just typing commands blindly
2011-03-02T04:01:00.000Z	daniel_tree	ikonia	I can always reverse it
2011-03-02T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	how ?
2011-03-02T04:02:00.000Z	daniel_tree	ikonia	it's installed into a folder I suppose and doesnt affect your currrent config..
2011-03-02T04:02:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	does it not change any of the dependencies on your system
2011-03-02T04:03:00.000Z	daniel_tree	ikonia	I dont know where I read that...I am not sure...
2011-03-02T04:03:00.000Z	daniel_tree	ikonia	help me go through that and we'll see :D
2011-03-02T04:04:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	no thanks,
2011-03-02T04:05:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	you're adding 3rd party repos to update the deps and then building it into your home directory, it's not something I'd recommend
2011-03-02T04:07:00.000Z	daniel_tree	ikonia	hm...but what can I do with fatal: destination path 'libnotify' already exists and is not an empty directory.
2011-03-02T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	I'm not supporting this, I suggest you contact the person/team who wrote the guide
2011-03-02T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	no cp will backup
2011-03-02T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	mv will move
2011-03-02T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	daniel_tree	mv will rename
