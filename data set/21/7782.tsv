2007-08-01T10:44:00.000Z	chiefinnovator		Hi everyone.  I need some help.  I just did the ubuntu updates and now my system won't shut down anymore.  It just goes to a blank screen and stays there.
2007-08-01T10:46:00.000Z	chiefinnovator		Any ideas on this:  I just did the ubuntu updates and now my system won't shut down anymore.  It just goes to a blank screen and stays there.
2007-08-01T10:46:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	chiefinnovator	can you get to a terminal prompt? (e.g., ctl-alt-f1) ?
2007-08-01T10:46:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	should I go to the terminal prompt after I hit shutdown and it goes to the blank screen, or just right now while everything is running?
2007-08-01T10:48:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	chiefinnovator	I was thinking that you might just want to shutdown -r (restart the computer) and see if it is stable when it comes back up ... that may not be best idea though; I'm a n00b
2007-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	I did a "hard" restart by pushing the power button :-(, Nothing changed though.
2007-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	chiefinnovator	what did you update?
2007-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	chiefinnovator		Does anyone have any ideas on how to diagnose this issue:  I just did the ubuntu updates and now my system won't shut down anymore.  It just goes to a blank screen and stays there.
2007-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	I just clicked that orange button at the top of the screen
2007-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	chiefinnovator		I don't trust those system updates too much.  One time it broke my xorg
2007-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	chiefinnovator	was the update succesful? were there any error messages, anything out of the ordinary?
2007-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	I don't think I saw any special error messages
2007-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		hm. chiefinnovator - have you looked in Synaptic (or the apt tool of your choice) to see if you have any broken packages?
2007-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	chiefinnovator		Is there a way to see what the computer is stuck on, that it won't shut down?
2007-08-01T10:52:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	I see a command to fix broken packages
2007-08-01T10:53:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		are you in Synaptic, chiefinnovator ?
2007-08-01T10:53:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	yes, Synaptic.  I just clicked the fix button but nothing seemed to happen
2007-08-01T10:54:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	chiefinnovator	on the left hand side, find and click the Custom Filters button
2007-08-01T10:54:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		filter for broken pkgs, chiefinnovator - see if there are any
2007-08-01T10:55:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		or check the status line at the bottom of the Synaptic window, chiefinnovator
2007-08-01T10:55:00.000Z	chiefinnovator	Nutubuntu	0 broken
