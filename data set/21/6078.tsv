2008-08-09T03:32:00.000Z	Genesis		I've just upgraded from Gutsy to Hardy and restarted. But when I reach the load screen I get dumped in to Busy box after a few minutes.
2008-08-09T03:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	does it ever go into gdm or do you stay in cli
2008-08-09T03:35:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	GMD? CLI?
2008-08-09T03:35:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	*GDM? CLI?
2008-08-09T03:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	im asking if it pops you into gdm (the fancy login screen with wallpaper etc) or do you stya in cli (all black just writing and a command saying "login:"
2008-08-09T03:38:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	whats busybox?
2008-08-09T03:38:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	please describe dont get that term?
2008-08-09T03:40:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	Busy Box apparently is the BASH I get dumped to.
2008-08-09T03:42:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	bash so your in cli, try typing command startx, if that doesnt work you could unninstall xorg (sudo aptitude purge xorg and installing it again) and see if that helps
2008-08-09T03:43:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	startx: not found
2008-08-09T03:46:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	is xorg even installed? well use comamnd to delete xorg and it folders than install it again... this is an upgrade right? PS: next time when moving to a newer version of ubuntu dont do system upgrade it causes all stupid errors
2008-08-09T03:48:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	I tried doing a clean install with Hardy heron but it wouldn't work.
2008-08-09T03:49:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	what do you mean it wouldnt work?
2008-08-09T03:50:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	The installer refused to recognise my hard Disk
2008-08-09T03:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	are you using encryption in your xp partition? did you use gparted to create a partition for ubuntu? did you unnistall xorg and isntalled it again?
2008-08-09T03:52:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	I have no windows partition
2008-08-09T03:52:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	I was installing to an empty unformatted hard drive
2008-08-09T03:53:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	I was installing to an empty unformatted hard drive
2008-08-09T03:54:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	if the disk is clean and you dont mind losing data than get gparted format the disk and use alternate livecd to install ubuntu otherwise just follow what i told you it should work, im trying to avoid deleting xorg.conf since it has your previous settings
2008-08-09T03:57:00.000Z	Genesis	Pirate_Hunter	I tried what you said it didn't recognese sudo
2008-08-09T03:59:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Genesis	why would you sudo the partition in the first place, ok seems your lost, do you want to install ubuntu from scratch?
