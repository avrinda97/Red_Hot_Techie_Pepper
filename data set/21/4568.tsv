2008-03-30T22:07:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	in recovery mode it doesnt go through to a command promt
2008-03-30T22:26:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	here's a good guide that'll help you chroot into your system from a liveCD http://gentoo-wiki.com/Chroot_from_a_livecd
2008-03-30T22:27:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	yes, but you need to ensure all your filesystems are mounted properly before using the chroot command
2008-03-30T22:27:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	in the df -kh it comes up as the hard disk being mounted and also it allows me to save the changes to the shadow and passwrd fiel
2008-03-30T22:29:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	the shadow and passwd files you see in the liveCD are not the ones that belong to your system -- you need to chroot first before you see them
2008-03-30T22:33:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	it depends on how many partitions you have on the hdd? you have to have atleast /etc/ mounted right
2008-03-30T22:33:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	all i have mounted is /media/disk
2008-03-30T22:33:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	which is my installed os
2008-03-30T22:33:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	how many partitions did you setup when installing ubuntu?
2008-03-30T22:34:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	if you only had that one partition .. you can just do. chroot /media/disk
2008-03-30T22:35:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	the only parition mounted in live cd is , /media/disk..............so would i do chroot /media/disk.... then ???
2008-03-30T22:35:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	if that command worked ok, you should just do -- passwd <user>
2008-03-30T22:35:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	replacing <user> with the user whose password you need to change
2008-03-30T22:36:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	you should also do this - passwd -l root
2008-03-30T22:37:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	that disables root, so that in future sessions you dont have a problem stepping into recovery mode
2008-03-30T22:37:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	so i will still have to go into recovery mode
2008-03-30T22:37:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	no, this time, the live CD should be enough, you can reboot into normal mode once you finished here
2008-03-30T22:38:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	also - passwd -l root
2008-03-30T22:53:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	you need to be root when you chroot -- use the command -- sudo chroot /media/disk
2008-03-30T22:53:00.000Z	Zn3t060	unop	i was root
2008-03-30T22:54:00.000Z	unop	Zn3t060	was your partition really mounted under /media/disk ???
