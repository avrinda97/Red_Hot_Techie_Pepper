2006-12-05T06:45:00.000Z	Navyseal	stefg	how do i know that?
2006-12-05T06:47:00.000Z	stefg	Navyseal	Let me put it different: Define 'TV' for your country.. Do you get numbers or voltage out of your TV-socket :-) ?
2006-12-05T06:47:00.000Z	Navyseal	stefg	it's works with cable and antenna, not with satellite
2006-12-05T06:48:00.000Z	stefg	Navyseal	so lets assume you got analog TV...

2006-12-05T06:54:00.000Z	stefg	Navyseal	as i found out, you've got a DVB-T card, so that's digital.. http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-97613.html might be an interesting read for you
2006-12-05T06:59:00.000Z	Navyseal	stefg	what do i have to do? didn't understood :s
2006-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	stefg	Navyseal	the card is already halfinstalled, it's just that due to a design flaw the card isn't auto-configurable in Linux, so you need to tell the driver, which card it is. Then you get a device in /dev/dvb/adapter0 and can use kaffeine, vlc or gxine to watch TV... kaffeine is prolly easiest, because it can scan the channels automatically
2006-12-05T07:04:00.000Z	Navyseal	stefg	doesn't exists any tutorial? :S
