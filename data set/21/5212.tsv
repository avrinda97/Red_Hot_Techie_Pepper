2007-12-05T01:38:00.000Z	h00k	skar	System -> Preferences -> Mouse.
2007-12-05T01:38:00.000Z	skar	h00k	the settings don't seem to have any affect
2007-12-05T01:38:00.000Z	h00k	skar	restart your x
2007-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	h00k	skar	log back out, then back in
2007-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	skar	h00k	i've tried rebooting
2007-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	skar	h00k	and ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	h00k	skar	have you opened your xorg.conf before?
2007-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	skar	h00k	yes, i edited it to use qsynaptics
2007-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	skar	h00k	although qsynaptics doesn't allow me to change the speed either
2007-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	skar	h00k	: there is one thing that worked, but didn't allow me to use vertical scrolling
2007-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	h00k	skar	yeah, the vertical scrolling is in sys -> prefs -> mouse
2007-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	h00k	skar	what sort of mouse is it?
2007-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	skar	h00k	its a touchpad, on a dell

2007-12-05T01:44:00.000Z	skar	h00k	if i make changes to the xorg.conf, do i have to reboot, or can i just ctrl+alt+backspace?
