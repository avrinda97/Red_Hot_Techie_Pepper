2008-12-27T15:50:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		hey guys hello everyone
2008-12-27T15:50:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		can someone help me with the XFCE desktop environment???
2008-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		does someone have an idea on how to launch a terminal by shortcut on the xfce desktop environment????
2008-12-27T15:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	  make a launcher that launches gnome-terminal or whatever terminal app you want. I forget how xfce makes launchers..  some right click menu
2008-12-27T15:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	you have looked at the xfce docs/homepage/guides? its not too hard a desktop to figure out for #1.. and for #2 - your question is a bit vague
2009-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 that would be sites on 'using the terminal' :) and 'bash'
2009-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 and there are dozens of such sites
2009-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	dr_willis	ok but there is nothing about "surviving in a life with no gui":)
2009-04-25T14:59:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	dr_willis	could you show me?
2009-04-25T14:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 theres a great many people that dont use X or the gui
2009-04-25T14:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 google will have listings of many of them. and you can use google with links, or lynx, or w3m
2009-04-25T15:00:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	dr_willis	yes but i'm lookng for something that is specific
2009-04-25T15:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 specific to what specifically?
2009-04-25T15:01:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	dr_willis	for exemple, sites where i can find lists of alternative programs for gui and terminal
2009-04-25T15:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 no idea. in many cases you just use the prper command sto do the tasks you want to do hters no real 'alternatives' to many of them.  ie: 'ifconfig' and 'mount' pretty mich are the commands you use.
2009-04-25T15:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 i would start with some 'bash basics' sites and start working from there.
2009-04-25T15:02:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	dr_willis	what do you suggest me for "bash basics sites"?
2009-04-25T15:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 'learning to think for yourself and dont expect to be hand held'  :)  go to google.com and search for 'bash tutorials' and 'command line basics'  or check out the urls given earlier here
2009-04-25T15:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	  the 'advanced bash scripting guide' is a MUST read in the future, and Orieally has a 'Learning Bash book' thats also a must have referance :0
2009-04-25T15:04:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	dr_willis	thank you so much
2009-04-25T15:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	harlemdavvey	 it pays to always have backups... :)
