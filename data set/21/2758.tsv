2009-06-28T09:55:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	You want my ISO?
2009-06-28T09:55:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	Will it work?
2009-06-28T09:56:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	That, I can't guarantee.  I followed the same guide on the linux.  However, remember our ISOs md5sum were different for some reason.
2009-06-28T09:56:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	But I followed everything, I only can think that should be okay.
2009-06-28T10:00:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	That's what i understood we were doing.
2009-06-28T10:01:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Check your PM -- I'm linking you the ISO.
2009-06-28T10:04:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	I almost never use irc, I'm using Colloquy as my irc client, and I can't figure out how to check private messages. I heard an alert sound that must have been a private message but I don't know how to find it.
2009-06-28T10:05:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Get online on the computer and download the ISO.
2009-06-28T10:06:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	I don't know how to see your link in this client. Sorry.
2009-06-28T10:09:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Use a computer.  Download the ISO I made.  Burn it using "cdrecord -v bootcd.iso" with a blank disc.
2009-06-28T10:09:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Then we'll compare md5sum.  Then that's it. :)
2009-06-28T10:11:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	did you create an iso? if so, you'll have to put the link here. I can't see private messages.
2009-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	I can't.  I don't want everybody leeching off on my laptop.
2009-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	You can't burn ISO on your iPhone anyway.
2009-06-28T10:17:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	Do you have any idea where I might find your private message in Colloquy? I'm on an iBook, not an iPhone.
2009-06-28T10:18:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Look around for my nickname.
2009-06-28T10:19:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	can you do a file transfer?
2009-06-28T10:21:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	On where?
2009-06-28T10:22:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Hey.  Right-click on my nickname and "send private message"
2009-06-28T10:23:00.000Z	twig11_	kinja-sheep	I found you. buried at the bottom of the user list. I've got the iso.
2009-06-28T10:25:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	twig11_	Do the md5sum.
