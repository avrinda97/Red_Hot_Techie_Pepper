2004-11-24T10:42:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	xmms-cdread
2004-11-24T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	it's a plugin package for xmms, install it
2004-11-24T10:44:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	are you just guessing as to how to use it?
2004-11-24T10:46:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	gnome-cd won't play cds digitally
2004-11-24T10:46:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	as I said, use xmms with xmms-cdread
2004-11-24T10:50:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	apt-get install xmms-cdread
2004-11-24T11:04:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	install libiw-dev
2004-11-24T11:04:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	yes, you can't use apt to install single files
2004-11-24T11:05:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	your ubuntu machine doesn't have any network access?
2004-11-24T11:05:00.000Z	burntash	bob2	i configured the cd plugin in xmms to play digital extraction instead of dialog and i work now
2004-11-24T11:05:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	so why are you manually downloading .deb files?
2004-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	so, now you have xmms working, you want to install beep as well?
2004-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	burntash	bob2	yes, never tried it, says it looks better cause of the gtk
2004-11-24T11:07:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	ok
2004-11-24T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	use synaptic to install the beep-media-player package
2004-11-24T11:13:00.000Z	burntash	bob2	i tried to search for it but i cant find it in synaptic
2004-11-24T11:13:00.000Z	bob2	burntash	wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto, it's in universe
2004-11-24T11:20:00.000Z	burntash	bob2	thank
2004-11-24T11:20:00.000Z	burntash	bob2	thanks
