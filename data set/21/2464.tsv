2009-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	Ben_90		losha?
2009-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	Ben_90		how the heck do i open .run files?
2009-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 sh whatever.run  (is one way)
2009-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 be warned that .run stuff can really mess thing up.
2009-10-06T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 you have tried the nvidia drivers from the repoistories first?
2009-10-06T10:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 use the tab key to 'complete' the proper complete name. :) sudo nv<tab> spelling and case is imporntant.
2009-10-06T10:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 and if i recall -  the nvidia stuff wants to be ran/installed while X is not running.  You need to run it as root, from a console.
2009-10-07T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 perhaps clarify what you are trying to do to 'fix' it?
2009-10-07T19:51:00.000Z	Ben_90	Dr_Willis	i added my user name into the sudoers file and changed the permissions from read-only to read/write
2009-10-07T19:51:00.000Z	Ben_90	Dr_Willis	and it won't let me change it back
2009-10-07T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 then you should be able to use a live cd. and as the ROOT user change it back.  you will need to use sudo chmode whatevert.......
2009-10-07T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 or the recovery mode. if you are logged in as the root user.
2009-10-07T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 give the command you are using and the exact error message perhaps..   could be some trival mistake you are making
2009-10-07T19:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 boot live cd.  in a terminaluse 'sudo -s'   to get root shell.. mount the filesystem, fix the file
2009-10-07T19:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 so you will want to use the command 'sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers'  from a live cd.. or rescue mode.   normally
2009-10-07T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 so you will want to use the command 'sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers'  from a live cd.. or rescue mode.   normally
2009-10-07T22:22:00.000Z	Ben_90	Dr_Willis	it is not working right.
2009-10-07T22:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 when chatting on irc.. its a good idea to remind people what you are talking about.. Im lucky to rember my own name for more then 4 min...
2009-10-07T22:24:00.000Z	Ben_90	Dr_Willis	lesshaste told me to install EnvyNG and i installed the driver for my card and it says it is running in low-graphics mode
2009-10-07T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ben_90	 i never use envyng, i always use the repo drivers for my nvidia card.
2009-10-07T22:26:00.000Z	Ben_90	Dr_Willis	i had to boot into low-graphics mode
