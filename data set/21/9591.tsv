2005-08-26T12:47:00.000Z	rhelmer		AlexC: what are you converting from? :
2005-08-26T12:48:00.000Z	rhelmer		:)
2005-08-26T12:48:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	- windows
2005-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	have you tried the live CD? you can boot from CD and not remove your existing windows install/files, so you can see what it's like
2005-08-26T12:53:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	i was going to d/l the cd and then use that
2005-08-26T12:55:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	the only thing i'd be careful about is preserving your windows install.. if you dual boot or something, you'll want to be able to boot into windows and access your files most likely, if you have problems
2005-08-26T12:56:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	wat do you mean by preserve my windows instal?
2005-08-26T12:56:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	well if you want windows and ubuntu installed on the same harddrive, and choose to start one or the other at boot time (aka dual boot)
2005-08-26T12:57:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	the ubuntu installer makes this pretty easy, but you need to know hardware details about how to resize partitions, etc.
2005-08-26T12:57:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	ok then, ill be sure to come back here WHEN i get problems, heheh
2005-08-26T12:58:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	ok, just be aware that the installer gives you the option to remove your windows install, so make sure you understand that when doing the install :)
2005-08-26T12:58:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	the live CD of course does nothing of this sort
2005-08-26T12:59:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	ok, so if i eventually decide to install the whole thing, make sure i dont remove my windows if i still want it, but with the live cd, i dont have ot worry
2005-08-26T13:00:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	is the live cd just like opening an application on windows?
2005-08-26T13:00:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	you've got it.. with the live CD, you put the CD in your drive and reboot
2005-08-26T13:00:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	instead of starting windows from the harddrive, it starts ubuntu from CDROM
2005-08-26T13:01:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	ok then, i get it now, i have an option of where to boot from
2005-08-26T13:01:00.000Z	rhelmer	AlexC	yes.. as bur[n] er says it can be changed on the machine, in the BIOS.. nowadays the CD rom is usually tried first, then hard drive
2005-08-26T13:02:00.000Z	AlexC	rhelmer	- bur[n] er: ok, thanks alot guys
