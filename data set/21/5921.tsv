2007-07-08T12:29:00.000Z	seraphimblade		Anyone had any experiences with odd behavior upon trying to install a new card?
2007-07-08T12:30:00.000Z	seraphimblade		I put a wireless card into my system, and the system wouldn't start up properly.
2007-07-08T12:30:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	what's improper about it?
2007-07-08T12:30:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	It would boot (with no errors during the boot process) and bring me to the login screen, but once I logged in, it wouldn't bring up the desktop.
2007-07-08T12:31:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	freaky.  cant help
2007-07-08T13:03:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	i have wmp54gs....
2007-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	Have any issues installing?
2007-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	"sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter"
2007-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	lemme see what its chipset is
2007-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	Mine's version 4.1, I believe they used different chipsets for different versions.
2007-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	do an lspci and see what vendor/product numbers it gives
2007-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	thatd tell me which of these http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_part.php?brandname=Linksys it is
2007-07-08T13:07:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	It's the Ralink set, looks like.
2007-07-08T13:07:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	oh
2007-07-08T13:07:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	right....
2007-07-08T13:09:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	did you try hotplugging it by any chance? it sounds stupid to do, but ive heard of some cards that wont work if they're a generic version of another card when you boot, but putting it so its almost in then snapping it in after boot then fudging with numbers so it looks valid works
2007-07-08T13:09:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	Hrm, I've not heard of that, but I can give it a try.
2007-07-08T13:10:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	the one i read about was on a laptop where the manufacturer of the laptop made a card that was the same but had different numbers on lspci that made it freak out if you used the generic one
2007-07-08T13:10:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	Just rather odd, there's a ton of documentation/discussion on this card with Ubuntu, and none of it mentions a thing like this.
2007-07-08T13:11:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	seraphimblade	probably a bad card
2007-07-08T13:11:00.000Z	seraphimblade	macogw-is-a-girl	That'd be my luck, too.
