2005-02-25T14:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 ls /var/run/
2005-02-25T14:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 first, is that what you needed?  and for your second question, see the /topic for some urls
2005-02-25T14:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 what is it you want to run?
2005-02-25T14:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 'file postal2_demo.run' and tell us the output
2005-02-25T14:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 '/usr/bin/al2_demo.run' and tell us the output
2005-02-25T14:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 '/usr/bin/file postal2_demo.run' and tell us the output
2005-02-25T14:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 if you trust it, then: "sh ./postal2_demo.run"
2005-02-25T14:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 if you like, 'mkdir /home/tweek/bin && sh ./postal2_demo.bin'
2005-02-25T14:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 if you like, 'mkdir /home/tweek/bin && sh ./postal2_demo.run' rather
2005-02-25T15:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 'sh ./postal2_demo.run" means "run the shell at /bin/sh on the file in the current directory named postal2_demo.run"
2005-02-25T15:06:00.000Z	tweek_	eyequeue	im hopeing it will put the files needed for me to play postal2 in the correct spots
2005-02-26T09:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	tweek_	 go to the urls in the /topic
