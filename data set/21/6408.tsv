2007-04-12T14:50:00.000Z	niriven		Anyone here use JFS?
2007-04-12T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	I used to
2007-04-12T14:50:00.000Z	niriven	mwe	Why used?
2007-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	because it's supposed to be safe and I had have a reiserfs partition go haywire on me
2007-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	niriven	mwe	I mean, what made you not use it anymore?
2007-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	It was slow when processing a lot of small files
2007-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	fast at large files, though.
2007-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	niriven	mwe	Yeah i noticed that :-/ its unbalanced. Could you recommend something a bit more balanced?
2007-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	I mainly process many small files so I went to ext3
2007-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	ext3
2007-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	niriven	mwe	What about xfs? know anything about that at all?
2007-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	only downside is the forced disk checks now and then
2007-04-12T14:53:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	I haven't used it personally but I heard you need a stable power supply or you could loose data
2007-04-12T14:53:00.000Z	niriven	mwe	Heh.
2007-04-12T14:53:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	supposedly XFS uses heavy caching
2007-04-12T14:53:00.000Z	niriven	mwe	Ah, so more ram needed?
2007-04-12T14:54:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	It should be blazing for file servers with millions of files
2007-04-12T14:54:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	I don't think so for normal usage
2007-04-12T14:54:00.000Z	niriven		Yeti: Ah, thanks. Thats what i figured. Can i convert my jfs to ext3?
2007-04-12T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	I don't think you'll notice the difference between XFS and EXT3 on a personal computer
2007-04-12T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	niriven	but again I don't have personal expeirence with XFS
