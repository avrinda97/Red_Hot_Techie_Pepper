2012-03-15T11:27:00.000Z	anush		Very bizzare filesystem issue. The sort order of a period (.) seems to be between the alphabets J and K. See paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/884429/
2012-03-15T11:27:00.000Z	anush		Reproduced on 11.10 and 10.10
2012-03-15T11:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	What localization?
2012-03-15T11:29:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	it should be en_US, but how to I verify?
2012-03-15T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	Try reproducing the problem with "LC_ALL=C ll"
2012-03-15T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	Order depends on your localisation, not all languages / regions have the same alphabet.
2012-03-15T11:31:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	got it, let me check what I have
2012-03-15T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	It sets all localization preferences to the default of 'C' (which basically means English).
2012-03-15T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	Using it on the same line as a command sets it only for that one command.
2012-03-15T11:34:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	how do i permanently set it?
2012-03-15T11:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	I don't actually know.
2012-03-15T11:35:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	Alright, I'll poke around, but this was really helpful. Thanks so much for pointing me in the right direction.
2012-03-15T11:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	You're welcome.
2012-03-15T11:42:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	I found out that my locale is in fact en_US.UTF-8. see http://paste.ubuntu.com/884437/
2012-03-15T11:49:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	So I changed my locale from en_US.UTF-8 to C (/etc/default/locale) and all is well now. Still not quite sure why the en_US locale is causing weirdness with sort or, but it's clearly a locale thing.
2012-03-15T11:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	I'm not sure that's actually a good idea. I can't think of any right now, but that might have unintended consequences.
2012-03-15T11:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	And if you're writing scripts you should always take locale into account (usually by *temporarily* setting LC_ALL=c) when sorting.
2012-03-15T11:55:00.000Z	anush	Jordan_U	Hmm, ok, the reason why it was a problem in the first place was because scripts were getting one order and java was getting another (causing naming mismatches). I suppose we can start using LC_ALL=C going forward, but what's bizzare is that this sort order thing is relatively new. Used to be fine before.
2012-03-15T11:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	It's a common thing which programmers miss, but in any language you need to consider locale when sorting.
2012-03-15T11:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	Any programming language that is :)
2012-03-15T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anush	You're welcome.
