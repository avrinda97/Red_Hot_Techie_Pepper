2009-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	g0th		When I playback a movie with mplayer and I pause it and resume later then it very often happens that I get the following messages:
2009-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	g0th		AO: [pulse] pa_stream_get_latency() failed: Connection terminated% 38 6 49%
2009-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	g0th		AO: [pulse] pa_stream_write() failed: Connection terminated%  2.3% 38 6 49%
2009-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	g0th		there seems to be a serious problem with pulseaudio since ubuntu jaunty
2009-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	g0th		I followed the instructions on the website but it didn't help
2009-04-30T23:05:00.000Z	g0th		I also edited the configuration file /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
2009-04-30T23:05:00.000Z	g0th		nothing helped
2009-04-30T23:05:00.000Z	g0th		what is going on?
2009-04-30T23:05:00.000Z	g0th		is there a way to turn pulseaudio off?
2009-04-30T23:05:00.000Z	g0th		it seems to be broken
2009-04-30T23:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	g0th	have you seen http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sound-solutions-for-ubuntu-904-jaunty-users.html yet ?
2009-04-30T23:09:00.000Z	g0th	glitsj16	no but I quickly read through it and there wasnt much new information
2009-04-30T23:09:00.000Z	g0th		I will simply remove pulseaudio
2009-04-30T23:09:00.000Z	g0th		is that a problem for something?
2009-04-30T23:09:00.000Z	g0th		ie. do I need pulseaudio for anything?
2009-04-30T23:10:00.000Z	glitsj16	g0th	shouldn't be a problem no, just remember to change the system sound prefs to your preference, it could be using pulse somewhere still
2009-04-30T23:10:00.000Z	g0th		ok
2009-04-30T23:10:00.000Z	g0th		another question
2009-04-30T23:11:00.000Z	g0th		is there a solution already for the following bug:
2009-04-30T23:11:00.000Z	g0th		pam_mount(pam_mount.c:100): unknown pam_mount option "use_first_pass"
2009-04-30T23:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	g0th	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-remove-pulse-audio-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex.html (should be similar for jaunty)
