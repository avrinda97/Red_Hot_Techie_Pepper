2012-09-13T12:07:00.000Z	cyberhulk		hi
2012-09-13T12:08:00.000Z	cyberhulk		i can't use sudo apt-get i am getting a "username not in the sudoers file error" :(
2012-09-13T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	have you been messing with sudoers file?
2012-09-13T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	if you run:  groups      what is the output please
2012-09-13T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	why are you in the root group?
2012-09-13T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	you need to be added to the sudo group and you will be able to use sudo
2012-09-13T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	boot back to root recovery mode and run:   usermod -a -G sudo username
2012-09-13T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	sounds like a read only file system
2012-09-13T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	what is the output of:   lsb_release -sc   please
2012-09-13T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	run the command please, what is the output
2012-09-13T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	su to the user you made the troublesome user with, then run the command there
2012-09-13T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	you can install build-essential and get an ANSI standard C and C++ compiler with some default libs
2012-09-13T12:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	yes, that isinstalled with build-essential
2012-09-13T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	you have a user whom can use sudo, you made the new account with it
2012-09-13T12:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	build-essential is not a default package, you could enable the root account, fix your mess then re-disable it
2012-09-13T12:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	you may simply just need to remount the file system writable once you get to root recovery prompt butwhy don't you just use the first account you made when you installed?
2012-09-13T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	then you will be in the sudo account by default as that is one feature of the first user you make
2012-09-13T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	you will have manually set a root password if it is, and you will then know that password
2012-09-13T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	in your case now, you'll need to remount the / partition writable, or use a chroot from live CD
2012-09-13T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	the root password is not the same as your user account
2012-09-13T12:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberhulk	not sure, maybe someone else knows while I websearch (you can do this too)
