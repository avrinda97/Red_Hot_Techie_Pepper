2008-02-14T13:09:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		like... haii. My wi-fi card isn't working on the new kernel.. it was working on .22, but now on .24-7 it is not. Any way I can fix it?
2008-02-14T13:10:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Did your wifi card work "out of box" with .22?
2008-02-14T13:10:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	spdf	Yeah.. It was even working on the live _cd
2008-02-14T13:10:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Hmm that's odd. What card is it?
2008-02-14T13:12:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Are they loaded? (lsmod)
2008-02-14T13:12:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	spdf	No.
2008-02-14T13:13:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Try modprobe iwl4965
2008-02-14T13:14:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Hmm.. cd /lib/modules/
2008-02-14T13:14:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Then find | grep 4965
2008-02-14T13:15:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Ahh, right, you're on 24-7 now.. one sec
2008-02-14T13:15:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	try find | grep iwl
2008-02-14T13:16:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Anything in the 24-7's that's close?
2008-02-14T13:17:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Yeh, its possible they moved the 4965 stuff into another kernel module
2008-02-14T13:19:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	spdf	You still there?
2008-02-14T13:21:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Yeh.. I can see that the ubuntu 24-4 kernel has iwl4965, not -7 though..
2008-02-14T13:21:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Just trying to track down what happened to it
2008-02-14T13:22:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	Are you on gusty?
2008-02-14T13:23:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	spdf	No, hardy
2008-02-14T13:25:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	I'm going to have to say check out #ubuntu+1
2008-02-14T13:26:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	The file lists aren't up for a lot of the hardy packages
2008-02-14T13:26:00.000Z	spdf	Stevethepirate	The last kernel with it in is -4, as far as I know
