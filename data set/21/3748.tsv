2008-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	abhishek		yeah, what zcat said.
2008-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	abhishek		so, do we have any experts here on ATI drivers?
2008-11-16T09:34:00.000Z	abhishek		My screen looks like bad TV reception... I tried installing the restricted driver but that messes up--can't even login. I got the package from ATI website and that fixes nothing. My question is, what works and how can I get it? :(
2008-11-16T09:34:00.000Z	abhishek		I've got an ATI Radeon 2600m
2008-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	abhishek		it works in Vista.
2008-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	abhishek		:\
2008-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	abhishek		I had it working previously under a Wubi install of Ubuntu 8.04
2008-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	abhishek		but it's no longer working.
2008-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	abhishek		on my fresh install of 8.04
2008-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	digifor	abhishek	did you have a gui with the livecd?
2008-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	abhishek		yeah... blurry there too.
2008-11-16T09:39:00.000Z	abhishek		I'd try to install 8.10 and see if it fixes my problems but the installer for 8.10 doesn't even recognize my keyboard.
2008-11-16T09:40:00.000Z	digifor	abhishek	I was able to insert the livecd > hit F4 >Safe video mode> then booted... I got a good gui..
2008-11-16T09:40:00.000Z	abhishek		@batsmasher: laptop? asus/lenovo?
2008-11-16T09:40:00.000Z	abhishek		what sound card?
2008-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	digifor	abhishek	...then I mounted the Ubuntu disk > then in terminal> sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /media/disk/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-11-16T09:42:00.000Z	digifor	abhishek	that worked for me.
2008-11-16T09:43:00.000Z	abhishek	digifor	to fix the ATI issue or the installer issue? I asked two questions, lol
2008-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	digifor	abhishek	that gave me a workable gui
2008-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	abhishek	digifor	well, I'll try that then
