2008-01-24T02:53:00.000Z	donluigi		My aditional NTFS hard drive is not showing after improper shutdown in ubuntu. Can someone help me?
2008-01-24T02:54:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	or if you don't have windows, you might want try ntfsfix (or was it fixntfs)
2008-01-24T02:55:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	ntfsfix /dev/path/to/your/ntfs/blockdevice
2008-01-24T02:56:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	thank you, let me try that
2008-01-24T02:58:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	it's ntfsfix still. in package 'ntfsprogs'
2008-01-24T03:00:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	can you paste it into pastebin? (please see topic)
2008-01-24T03:00:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	ah. just use /dev/sdb1 instead
2008-01-24T03:00:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	it was a bad example ;-)
2008-01-24T03:01:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	will do
2008-01-24T03:01:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	ntfsfix /dev/sdb1
2008-01-24T03:02:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	please don't paste so many lines here. sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb1
2008-01-24T03:03:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	sorry bout the multiple lines...  i got that it was processed succesfully
2008-01-24T03:03:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	now, try mounting it. pmount /media/sdb1 should work
2008-01-24T03:04:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	says only root can mount, how do i go to the root?
2008-01-24T03:05:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	thank you... ubuntu just rocks
2008-01-24T03:06:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	once i finish backing my drive, how do i format it under ext3?
2008-01-24T03:07:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	you better come back here and ask :-). one step at a time :-)
2008-01-24T03:09:00.000Z	donluigi	czr	will do, thank you so much for your time and help. really appreciate it
2008-01-24T03:09:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	no problem :-).
2008-01-24T03:39:00.000Z	czr	donluigi	someone else should be able to help you :-). I need to cook some food & sleep now. good luck though :-)
