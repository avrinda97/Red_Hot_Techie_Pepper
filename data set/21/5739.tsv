2010-01-03T12:19:00.000Z	Random832		but in all cases it's utf8 not utf-8
2010-01-03T12:21:00.000Z	Random832		utf-8 can show any characters
2010-01-03T12:22:00.000Z	Random832		none of them work as in none of them even show up when you type 'mount'?
2010-01-03T12:22:00.000Z	Random832		are you sure the filenames aren't actually question marks? when you go into windows do the filenames have the greek letters?
2010-01-03T12:23:00.000Z	Random832		wait a minute
2010-01-03T12:23:00.000Z	Random832		you didn't say you were using the text console
2010-01-03T12:23:00.000Z	Random832		text mode fonts are a completely different problem with a different solution
2010-01-03T12:24:00.000Z	Random832		two different aspects - you have to put the console in utf8 mode, and you have to use a font with greek letters
2010-01-03T12:24:00.000Z	Random832		so it all works correctly in X11 mode?
2010-01-03T12:24:00.000Z	Random832		do you have a "consolechars" command?
2010-01-03T12:25:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	pgrep ssh-agent
2010-01-03T13:29:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	add "chvt X" to the hibernation-script
2010-01-03T13:30:00.000Z	Random832	llutz	where can i find this hibernation script
2010-01-03T13:31:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	it was /usr/lib/pm-utils  in jaunty
2010-01-03T13:31:00.000Z	Random832	llutz	how do i make it remember to change it back?
2010-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	Random832	llutz	you just gave me a directory but that doesn't tell me what file to change
2010-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	hm, i might have recalled the wrong thing.all those things change weekly :(
2010-01-03T13:36:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	check pm-functions
2010-01-30T21:53:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	-ignore='Name *~'
2010-07-25T17:55:00.000Z	Random832	llutz	though if they changed the root password they're not that subtle :P
2010-07-25T17:56:00.000Z	llutz	Random832	speculation, you cannot be sure. so reinstall is the only way to get a known state
