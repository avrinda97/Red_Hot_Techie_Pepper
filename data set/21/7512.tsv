2006-09-13T16:13:00.000Z	BadManiac		I could use a hand installing ndiswrapper, anyone got a spare minute? /t me
2006-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	BadManiac		dont really have a choice since I only have win drivers for my belkin USB wifi card.
2006-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	BadManiac		I got the drivers, and I downloaded ndiswrapper, but when I install it it says:
2006-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	BadManiac		Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: ndiswrapper modules 1.1
2006-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	BadManiac		aparently I got the wrong version of ndiswrapper downloaded?
2006-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-source
2006-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: yes

2006-09-13T16:25:00.000Z	BadManiac	georgy	uhm, huh?
2006-09-13T16:27:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: in aterminal go to the extracted files, then type first ./configure, then make then sudo make install

2006-09-13T16:34:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: sorry, i just see you don't have to do configure, just begin with make
2006-09-13T16:35:00.000Z	BadManiac	georgy	ah that would explain it. lets try that then
2006-09-13T16:37:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: I think you need to install it first, but without connection it will be difficult ;)
2006-09-13T16:38:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: You need some other package to build ndiswrapper
2006-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: watch on http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/ all the packages you need for ndiswrapper
2006-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: then do it by hand is a lot of work
2006-09-13T16:55:00.000Z	georgy	BadManiac	: ok, but try to get a cable internet connection, it will be eays then
