2012-05-04T05:32:00.000Z	tucemiux		thats a big flaw, if you make the software center smaller, you dont have a horizontal bar
2012-05-04T05:33:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	in the software center?
2012-05-04T05:34:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	yeah i made the window smaller and couldnt see the search square, i didnt have a horizontal bar
2012-05-04T05:34:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	the only somewhat stable way I've found so far is using ubuntu-tweak
2012-05-04T05:34:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	you could file a bug about it :)
2012-05-04T05:35:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ their project is hosted in Launchpad as well.
2012-05-04T05:36:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	ok but im wondering what does ubuntu tweak has?
2012-05-04T05:37:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	it lets you use themes you can find in the repos.
2012-05-04T05:38:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	thanks im goign to look into it but for now im going to fix my video drivers

2012-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	ubuntu-tweak will allow you to use other themes. http://ubuntu-tweak.com/
2012-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	zankz! Ill look through it
2012-05-05T06:00:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	it has lots other good features too :)
2012-05-05T06:00:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	i have that doesnt include back doors o.O
2012-05-05T06:01:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	huh?
2012-05-05T06:02:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	you think ubuntu tweak will slow down my gaming? is it like compiz?
2012-05-05T06:03:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	no, it doesn't run in the background
2012-05-05T06:03:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	it simply gives you easy access to certain features that are readily available in the default configuration tools.
2012-05-05T06:03:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	thanks, thats the only reason i didnt go to compiz, because it worked a little flaky when i gamed
2012-05-05T06:46:00.000Z	tucemiux	wylde	not bad, ubuntu tweak did the trick but i'm almost there, ubuntu now is in a usable state but I want how do I download more themes? o.O
2012-05-05T06:47:00.000Z	wylde	tucemiux	either from the software manager, apt-get or aptitude, synaptic. Whatever package manager you prefer. Search for themes.
