2007-05-24T16:05:00.000Z	gnilor		anybody here happen to know where i could find epcam-src-0.7.1.tar.gz ?
2007-05-24T16:05:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	search packages.ubuntu.com
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	or install apt-file and man apt-file
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	or use google if you're not looking for an ubuntu package
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	gnilor	gpm	it's not an offical file
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	well then, it's not officially supported....use google like the rest of us
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	gnilor	gpm	i can't find it through google. i was hoping somebody here might still have it
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	what is it? a driver or something?
2007-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	gnilor		yeah, for some cheap webcam thingie i'm trying
2007-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	gpm		huh
2007-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	gpm		sorry, i'm useless
2007-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	gpm		:-(
2007-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	gnilor	gpm	as mentioned here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=118623
2007-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	gpm		yeah, i just pulled that up
2007-05-24T16:08:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	well...you could try posting to that forum and ask people where they got the driver
2007-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	http://members.chello.nl/~j.vreeken/se401/ that's a start...but i don't know where the original source is....are you sure it's not in the kernel?
2007-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	gnilor	gpm	pretty sure
2007-05-24T16:12:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	from that website...it looks like you download the patch and patch it against a kernel program to get the cameras to work
2007-05-24T16:12:00.000Z	gnilor	gpm	and the waybackmachine hasn't got it either, yeah but it's a bit of a hassle, i'll give it a try
2007-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	gpm	gnilor	well, the patches are on that site i gave you, and then patch it against something in the kernel source it looks like
2007-05-24T16:39:00.000Z	gnilor	gpm	making progress, it already compiles :) tnx for the effort you put into helping me
