2007-05-26T11:16:00.000Z	mkquist		anyone - had xp/ubuntu installed, installed vista - now cant seem to get grub to work, tried reinstalling it from live cd but it just boots to windows everytime... any ideas?
2007-05-26T11:17:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	just pop your ubuntu liveCD in, and setup grub in your MBR again
2007-05-26T11:18:00.000Z	mkquist		well i guess the last answer is just to reinstall ubuntu, not the end of the world, but id rather just fixt it
2007-05-26T11:18:00.000Z	mkquist		jester - ive tried that like 3 or 4 times, still no go, but that is what i keep reading
2007-05-26T11:18:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	grub, when you're in the prompt : root (hd0,0) then setup (hd0,0)
2007-05-26T11:18:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	hmm
2007-05-26T11:19:00.000Z	mkquist		jester - yep did that, im just thinking it must be some small thing im missing
2007-05-26T11:19:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	it boots straight into windows without seeing grub? then grub isn't installed properly in the mbr
2007-05-26T11:19:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	only Windows boot code in the MBR can point to the Windows boot sector and system partition
2007-05-26T11:19:00.000Z	mkquist		wasnt really worried about windows eating grub, fixed it before, just cant seem to get it to work now
2007-05-26T11:20:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	what is your bootable hard drive ?
2007-05-26T11:20:00.000Z	mkquist		jester - drive w/windows on it
2007-05-26T11:21:00.000Z	mkquist		jester - xp
2007-05-26T11:21:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	but how does it appear in linux, hd0 ?
2007-05-26T11:21:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	err I mean, /dev/hda ?
2007-05-26T11:21:00.000Z	mkquist	bullgard4	i believe a running process is actively using cpu cycles
2007-05-26T11:22:00.000Z	mkquist	bullgard4	- one that is not using cycles
2007-05-26T11:22:00.000Z	mkquist	bullgard4	- at that moment
2007-05-26T11:23:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	well my guess is you're setting up grub on a partition instead of the mbr (setup (hd0,0) instead of setup (hd0)) for example, or just on the wrong hard drive. Anyways gl
2007-05-26T11:23:00.000Z	mkquist		jester - /dev/hda1 is boot
2007-05-26T11:23:00.000Z	Jester	mkquist	should be hd0 in grub then, you can see the partitions with tab
