2007-10-03T09:06:00.000Z	anonymeeee		anyone know how to batch edit file names?
2007-10-03T09:06:00.000Z	anonymeeee		what editor should I use?
2007-10-03T09:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	the command to rename the file would be to move the file to it's new file (i think)
2007-10-03T09:08:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Ashfire908	i need to change the file name of a bunch of mp3s
2007-10-03T09:08:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	in ubuntu/linux, batchs would be shell scripting (sh)
2007-10-03T09:08:00.000Z	anonymeeee		the filenames are too long for windoze
2007-10-03T09:09:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	how is that possible?
2007-10-03T09:09:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	unless you mean like 98
2007-10-03T09:10:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	anyway, how do you want them renamed
2007-10-03T09:10:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Ashfire908	dunno how it's happening, but the end of the file gets cut off when I try to transfer it to a dvd
2007-10-03T09:11:00.000Z	anonymeeee		I just need the torrent info removed
2007-10-03T09:11:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Ashfire908	it's cutting off the .mp3 end of the file name...
2007-10-03T09:11:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	oh...
2007-10-03T09:12:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	btw just found "prename" and "rename" commands, i'm going to check the man files
2007-10-03T09:13:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Ashfire908	thank you
2007-10-03T09:15:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	apaerentaly, "prename" and "rename" are the same. it uses a perl expression. not familar with perl, but how do you want them renamed
2007-10-03T09:16:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Ashfire908	i just want a certain section of the file name removed if thats possible...it's 100 songs
2007-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	Ashfire908	anonymeeee	is thepart the same for each file?
2007-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Ashfire908	yes
