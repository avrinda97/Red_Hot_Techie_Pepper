2008-07-19T14:15:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	do you have time to check a script?
2008-07-19T14:29:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	what's the errors?
2008-07-19T14:31:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	you have to use my name so I see your posts before you post something
2008-07-19T14:31:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	./install.sh
2008-07-19T14:31:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	have you changed the premissions on the .sh file to run it?
2008-07-19T14:31:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	nope
2008-07-19T14:32:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	no clue how to do that
2008-07-19T14:32:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	re-untar the file. the system can't find your install script.  I suspect the usal suspects.  Mr. Gates or Mr. Jobs
2008-07-19T14:37:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	ok if it is saved tothe desktop would the command still be sudo ./install.sh?
2008-07-19T14:38:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	you'll have to open a shell window, navigate to where you have it untared, and then run ./install.sh
2008-07-19T14:38:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	you have to be in the same directory where the file exists.
2008-07-19T14:39:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	  do i have to be in the root?
2008-07-19T14:39:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	not if you untared it with your logged in account
2008-07-19T14:42:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	i am getting annoyed it is on my desktop i am in the desktop directory and it is  giving me this bash: sudo/install.sh: No such file or directory
2008-07-19T14:43:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	<rolls eyes>  ok, simple.  "sudo ./install.sh"
2008-07-19T14:45:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	laura@laura-desktop:~$ "sudo ./install.sh"
2008-07-19T14:45:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	ok, first, get a real computer name.  and second, yes, that looks right
2008-07-19T14:46:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	lol ok then why didnt it find the file and install it?
2008-07-19T14:46:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	ok, well, I don't know what you're doing then.  obviously the file dosn't exist.  if you did a "ls install.sh" and it shows up, then we need to change the premissions of the file, but if it didn't show up, then you need to figure out where the file went
2008-07-19T14:49:00.000Z	jeimuzu	jeeves__	the install file is in a folder  called zinc-1.1.7 on my desktop
2008-07-19T14:50:00.000Z	jeeves__	jeimuzu	so you'll have to do a "cd zinc-1.1.7", THEN run the install script
