2011-12-21T15:35:00.000Z	taffflash		good morning guys Im new to Ubuntu and I just taken win 7 off this pc and going to just use this Os on my pc.
2011-12-21T15:35:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Congrats.
2011-12-21T15:36:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Whats not working?
2011-12-21T15:36:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Nope, should work.
2011-12-21T15:39:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Click on it?  :)
2011-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	What does the log say?
2011-12-21T15:52:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	The path is /var/log/jockey.log, open it with an editor.
2011-12-21T15:55:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Really?
2011-12-21T15:57:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Do you have any experience logically thinking through a problem and solving it?
2011-12-21T16:00:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	No flaming going on, just pointing out that the error message told you exactly what to do.
2011-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Are you installing fglrx over the open source drivers for a reason?  I use the open source ATI drivers and am mostly happy.
2011-12-21T16:06:00.000Z	taffflash	ServerSage	the open source ones are the ones already installed right?
2011-12-21T16:06:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Should be.
2011-12-21T16:06:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	What ATI card do you have?
2011-12-21T16:09:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Sounds like a mobile card, is this a laptop?
2011-12-21T16:11:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Get the model number from lspci.  You can run "lspci |grep ATI" from the console.
2011-12-21T16:26:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Thats supported by the fglrx driver if you want to go that route.  Just gotta figure out why it's not installing.
2011-12-21T16:28:00.000Z	taffflash	ServerSage	if you could please help me sort this issue out I would be greatful
2011-12-21T16:29:00.000Z	ServerSage	taffflash	Why are you so hell bent on installing the fglrx driver?  Why not stick with the open source?
