2006-02-20T09:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	patience
2006-02-20T09:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	and what changed?
2006-02-20T09:40:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	i restarted my computer, first restart after i had installed them
2006-02-20T09:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	hrm, nvidia too, yes?
2006-02-20T09:40:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	nvidia 6800 xt video card
2006-02-20T09:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	 there's a HOWTO for that IIRC
2006-02-20T09:41:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	didnt apply, it wouldnt work right, i didnt have the same kernel version it was compiled in
2006-02-20T09:41:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	i then had to get the linux-headers files and it made its own compile..
2006-02-20T09:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	oh
2006-02-20T09:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	it worked for me, if it is the same scenario (I'm not sure anymore)
2006-02-20T09:42:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	i updated my kernel, and then tried to install the nvidia drivers...
2006-02-20T09:42:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	i think it said my kernel reports the driver as the version the drivers should be, and the drivers are reporting a different version
2006-02-20T09:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	I have done that successfully
2006-02-20T09:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	hrm
2006-02-20T09:43:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	ill just try installing them again.. *shrugs*
2006-02-20T09:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	mordof	good luck
2006-02-20T09:43:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	thanks
2006-02-20T09:45:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	there, its reinstalled, now lets see if i can get into X
2006-02-20T09:45:00.000Z	mordof	Xenguy	GAH! starting gnome display manager fails!
