2009-02-03T08:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys		!clone

2009-02-03T08:41:00.000Z	danopia	prince_jammys	i managed to get down to   irb1.8: Depends: ruby1.8 (>= 1.8.6.111-2ubuntu1.2) but 1.8.6.111-2ubuntu1 is to be installed
2009-02-03T08:42:00.000Z	danopia		(which is installed)
2009-02-03T08:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	danopia	crap
2009-02-03T08:42:00.000Z	danopia		ruby1.8 is already the newest version.
2009-02-03T08:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	danopia	you need someone who's familiar with fixing a broken apt
2009-02-03T08:43:00.000Z	prince_jammys	danopia	like perhaps using -force.
2009-02-03T08:44:00.000Z	danopia	prince_jammys	i'll try again tomarow
2009-02-03T08:44:00.000Z	prince_jammys	danopia	good luck
