2011-04-25T01:51:00.000Z	raidghost		To install Ubuntu on a Acer aspire one , Slow or okey ?  Any possible way to add to grup to boot from netinstall iso ?
2011-04-25T01:51:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	you can use netinstaller, yes
2011-04-25T01:52:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	Possible to add netinstall.iso to grub
2011-04-25T01:54:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	you could, but why ?
2011-04-25T01:54:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	i dont have a flashdrive or usbdrive at the cabin
2011-04-25T01:55:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	and no cdrom & cd either ?
2011-04-25T01:57:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	I never tried this, you can run a live cd from boot, though .. you would need an extra partition for the image and I can't predict if that won't get lost when partitoning and downloading, experiment to me so
2011-04-25T01:59:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	Thanks for the advice.
2011-04-25T02:00:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	I'd say so
2011-04-25T02:04:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	can you possibly hang the hd to your current box ? via usb-adapter or such ?
2011-04-25T02:04:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	i dont have any usb-drive
2011-04-25T02:05:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	nah, I mean get ther "ssd" out the lappi and , via adaptor, hook it on your current box ( which might have cd ?)
2011-04-25T02:08:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	i often did it in that way for weak machines, to have the basic install on a powerfull tower done in no time, re-insert hd in target-box and then getting a fitting end-install
2011-04-25T02:22:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	The acer aspire one, is that a dual cpu ?
2011-04-25T02:24:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	I think so, but better check with exact model on aspire, I'm no stock-bot :)
2011-04-25T02:25:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	its a AO751h
2011-04-25T02:27:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	intelatom, 1 core it seems
2011-04-25T02:28:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	z520
2011-04-25T02:28:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	no rocket, true, use a lightweight install, maybe lubuntu
2011-04-25T02:35:00.000Z	raidghost	DasEi	The ubuntu will work in lubuntu?
2011-04-25T02:36:00.000Z	DasEi	raidghost	it's also ubuntu, but with a lightwight surface, ar you stay with 10.04 and use the netbook-remix (will be gone fronm natty on)
