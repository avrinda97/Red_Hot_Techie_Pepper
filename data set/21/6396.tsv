2007-04-11T05:51:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1		helloo, can I get some help here please?
2007-04-11T05:52:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1		gary, I get a grub error 21 issues on everyone first boot up.
2007-04-11T05:52:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1		gary, i meant every ^^
2007-04-11T05:53:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1		gary,alright thanks anyways.
2007-04-11T05:54:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1		:'(no hope in grub
2007-04-11T05:55:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	it means the disk it tries to use doesn't exist
2007-04-11T05:55:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	how can I fix it ?
2007-04-11T05:55:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	did you get this after a fresh install of ubuntu?
2007-04-11T05:56:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	nope, it started after I logged in M$.
2007-04-11T05:57:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	hm, that's very odd
2007-04-11T05:58:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	it only happens on every first boot-up.
2007-04-11T05:58:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	such as shut down x then power up x.
2007-04-11T05:59:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	so if you hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete, after you get the error 21, it boots fine?
2007-04-11T05:59:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	yes
2007-04-11T06:00:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	then the grub-config is apparently ok, sounds like there's a bug in either the bios or grub then...
2007-04-11T06:01:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	do you need to see my grub menu.lst ?
2007-04-11T06:01:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1		!pastebin
2007-04-11T06:02:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	since it boots up, on the second try, I doubt there's anything wrong with your menu.lst, I think the best thing to do is to file a bug report
2007-04-11T06:04:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	could it be because I have xp on the first drive and the second on linux ? and the grub thinggy got confused ?
2007-04-11T06:05:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noo1	maybe, but it sounds mostly like the bios has problems detecting the harddrives properly on the first go
2007-04-11T06:06:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noo1	reep	brb, imma try changing the hard drive order in bios.
