2006-12-21T12:56:00.000Z	wy		I've got a problem compiling the driver for ipw3954. It says Your kernel contains ieee80211 symbol definitions and you
2006-12-21T12:56:00.000Z	wy		are not using the kernel's default ieee80211 subsystem.  (Perhaps you
2006-12-21T12:56:00.000Z	wy		used the out-of-tree ieee80211 subsystem's 'make install' or have
2006-12-21T12:56:00.000Z	wy		provided a path to the ieee80211 subsystem via IEEE80211_INC.)
2006-12-21T12:56:00.000Z	wy		This is strange. I don't have any driver for the wireless now
2006-12-21T12:57:00.000Z	pike_	wy	upgraded kernel or something?
2006-12-21T12:57:00.000Z	pike_	wy	bah youre compiling nm
2006-12-21T12:57:00.000Z	wy	pike_	I upgraded to 2.6.17-generic yesterday
2006-12-21T13:01:00.000Z	pike_	wy	soo if module is loaded does it show up when you ifconfig?
2006-12-21T13:01:00.000Z	wy	pike_	No. nothing there
2006-12-21T13:02:00.000Z	wy	pike_	It seems I need something else?
2006-12-21T13:07:00.000Z	pike_	wy	if in edgy might rm /bin/sh  then ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh  or something
2006-12-21T13:08:00.000Z	wy	pike_	Strange. /bin/sh and /bin/bash differ!
2006-12-21T13:09:00.000Z	wy	pike_	Gosh! When did they change this to dash?
2006-12-21T13:10:00.000Z	pike_	wy	in edgy dapper is still bash
2006-12-21T13:10:00.000Z	wy	pike_	Why? This will cause a lot of confusion
2006-12-21T13:11:00.000Z	pike_	wy	i gather dash has some advantages.. ive never used it
2006-12-21T13:12:00.000Z	wy	pike_	I compiled it. but running modprobe ipw3945 gives the error: sh: /sbin/ipw3945d-2.6.17-10-generic: No such file or directory
2006-12-27T15:40:00.000Z	pike_	wy	xmms
2006-12-27T15:41:00.000Z	pike_	wy	amarok is nice but bloated imo
2006-12-27T15:41:00.000Z	wy	pike_	amarok can't work well in gnome
