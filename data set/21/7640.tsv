2008-02-22T10:56:00.000Z	erpo		I need an IPv6-capable VNC client.
2008-02-22T10:57:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	try looking into realvnc
2008-02-22T11:01:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	I did. The version of vncviewer I have installed is from RealVNC (version 4.1.1). When I type vncviewer my:IPV6:addr:ess, it says "unable to connect to host: Invalid argument (22)"
2008-02-22T11:01:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	what others have you looked into?
2008-02-22T11:03:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	http://jungla.dit.upm.es/~acosta/paginas/vncIPv6.html (compiles but has the same problem)
2008-02-22T11:05:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	why ipv6?
2008-02-22T11:05:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	not mainstream, although better.... or are you just testing?
2008-02-22T11:07:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	Both machines have IPv6 and IPv4, but IPv4 has annoying NAT issues. I want to circumvent that by connecting directly via IPv6.
2008-02-22T11:08:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	your better off resolving NAT issues as I am not showing alot in regard to ipv6 support
2008-02-22T11:08:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	and your router... does it support ipv6?
2008-02-22T11:08:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	Not an issue. Both machines are using the gateway6 client.
2008-02-22T11:09:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	whats your nat issue?
2008-02-22T11:09:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	if I may inquire
2008-02-22T11:10:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	NAT is being used, so I would have to set up port forwarding. Additionally, both computers have dynamic public IPs, so I would have to set up some kind of dynamic DNS garbage.
2008-02-22T11:11:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	try looking into hamachi
2008-02-22T11:11:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	let me know what you think
2008-02-22T11:11:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	Closed source, no?
2008-02-22T11:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	started open source... purchased.... free version available however yes(closed source)
2008-02-22T11:13:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	Gross.
2008-02-22T11:13:00.000Z	erpo	tyler_d	Wait. I thought it had been closed source from the beginning.
2008-02-22T11:14:00.000Z	tyler_d	erpo	alternatively, port forwarding=5mins, static ips = 10mins for 2 machines......... vs. tweaking out vnc for ipv6..... who knows
