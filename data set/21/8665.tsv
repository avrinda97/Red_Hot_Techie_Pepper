2006-07-25T14:55:00.000Z	Enverex		hmm, shouldn't update-manager -d give me the option to upgrade to Edgy? (devel)
2006-07-25T14:55:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	last update doesn't start your x server
2006-07-25T14:56:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	Erm? I'm already in X
2006-07-25T14:56:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	are you on edgy?
2006-07-25T14:56:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	I really don't know why it said after the last update that X server cannot find the font: "fixed"
2006-07-25T14:56:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	No, hence why I assumed that would update it TO Edgy (although I think I may be misunderstanding that)
2006-07-25T14:57:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	Erm, I think you're confusing me with someone else
2006-07-25T14:57:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	why?
2006-07-25T14:57:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	why I confuse you?
2006-07-25T14:57:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	erm, I never mentioned any fonts or anything
2006-07-25T14:58:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	the easiest update: change in /etc/apt/sources.list the word: dapper with edgy. Then you should do sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-07-25T14:59:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	thanks
2006-07-25T14:59:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	anyway take care, and make a backup system to do that
2006-07-25T14:59:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	the updates need to be polished a bit :)
2006-07-25T14:59:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	Meh, I used Gentoo on this machine for 4 years, I'm used to things breaking all the time
2006-07-25T15:00:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	whelcome to Ubuntu :)
2006-07-25T15:01:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	if you want to compile some packages (as you do in Gentoo) you may do: apt-get source packagename
2006-07-25T15:01:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	and in the current folder it will appear the source which you may compile any time
2006-07-25T15:03:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	I know, heh, but if I compile from source I prefer to download from the programs site and do it manually
2006-07-25T15:12:00.000Z	ciplogic	Enverex	do you know how to setup the X server to work?
2006-07-25T15:13:00.000Z	Enverex	ciplogic	Yeah, why?
