2005-07-26T14:06:00.000Z	thain		anyone else noticed problems with firefox's security update?
2005-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	thain		firefox crashes when i try to open a new tab (i'm using the tab extensions)
2005-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	djp	thain	only just updated this morning... just tried opening a new tab, using CTRL-T, and worked fine. not using the "tab extension" here though
2005-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	thain	djp	it crashed when i disabled the extensions. after starting it again the extensions were disabled but ctrl-t still crashed it...
2005-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	djp	thain	strange...just tried again, opened 5 tabs without any problem. will keep an eye on that though.
2005-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	thain	djp	hmm perhaps it's the -gnome-support
2005-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	thain		i remember i had problems with openoffice's add-on gnome support...
2005-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	thain	djp	that did it, it was the gnome support
2005-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	djp	thain	i gather you are running hoary?
2005-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	thain	djp	yes
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	djp		ok, great thain
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	djp		you can start tabbing again! ;)
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	thain	djp	well thanks anyway, even if it wasn't the tab stuff :)
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	thain		argh...
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	thain		it started again
2005-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	thain		x)
2005-07-26T14:13:00.000Z	thain	djp	now i can't manage to open the extensions window at all
2005-07-26T14:14:00.000Z	thain		you could easily backport gcc4-base if it's at all similar to gcc-3.3-base and gcc-3.4-base :)
2005-07-26T14:14:00.000Z	thain		empty package with no dependencies
2005-07-26T14:16:00.000Z	djp		anyone know why (very) occassionally, when starting up hoary, after logging in from the gdm, only the background colour appears and... that's it! i have to restart the machine and then everything is fine. This has probably only happened on a couple of ocassions however.
2005-07-26T14:18:00.000Z	thain	djp	disabling both the tab extensions and gnome support seems to get me further; no crashes yet...
