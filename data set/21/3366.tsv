2009-11-22T11:14:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	 i think i found what i was looking for here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux  thanks for that suggestion though

2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	wow, thnx
2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	np
2010-02-17T02:25:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	i might try those instructions... but i was trying the way with the grub that is already installed on the system
2010-04-21T04:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	grub2's "ext2" module supports ext2/3/4
2010-04-21T04:41:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	thanks for the info... figured it would but was worth a shot anyway
2010-05-26T04:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	Why do you want to boot grub4dos?
2010-05-26T05:05:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	because there are alot of things that I want to boot that use grub4dos internally and I don't want to have to rewrite all those commands into grub2
2010-05-26T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	There are ways to load grub4dos from grub2, which way you choose depends on what exactly you are doing. Also, the next verison of grub2 will have a menu.lst parser for compatability with grub legacy (and thus grub4dos).
2010-05-26T05:13:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	right now I am trying to load it using memdisk from syslinux and grldr as initrd
2010-05-26T05:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	That should work (again, depending on your end goal). Remeber to use "linux16" rather than "linux" to load memdisk.
2010-05-26T05:17:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	is seems to load grub4dos just fine but then fails stating helper loading failed :(
2010-05-26T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	Again, how you load grub4dos will depend on what you are trying to do. What are you trying to do?
2010-05-26T05:20:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	one thing I am trying to do is load hirens boot cd
2010-05-26T05:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	The problem is that none of the windows software will work unless it's on a physical CD (I assume you're trying to boot a hiren's iso file on a filesystem rather than burned / dd'd to an actual drive). The DOS utilities will work, but you may have to load their floppy images directly with memdisk.
2010-05-26T05:29:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	I can load the individual components from it (konboot, dban) I really wanted the windows enviro it has on there... any clue about that then?
2010-05-26T05:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	Windows can't loop mount its root from an iso file like linux can and it doesn't use BIOS calls to access drives like DOS, so memdisk won't fool it. It has to be on an actual partition / CD. There is no way around it (one of the downsides of proprietary software).
2010-05-26T05:33:00.000Z	MK13	Jordan_U	ok, figured that wouldn't work but thanks for the rational behind it :)
2010-05-26T05:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MK13	You're welcome.
