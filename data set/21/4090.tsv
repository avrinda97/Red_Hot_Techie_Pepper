2008-07-14T01:55:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	... i'll wait then
2008-07-14T01:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	Interesting, it doesn't specify to use the nvidia driver
2008-07-14T01:59:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	?
2008-07-14T01:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	Are you sure nvidia is enabled in hardware drivers?
2008-07-14T01:59:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	... hardware drivers doesn't show me a thing
2008-07-14T02:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	How did you install the nvidia drivers again ( or am I thinking of the wrong person? )
2008-07-14T02:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	Ahh, Ok let me see if I can edit your xorg.conf and send it back to you

2008-07-14T02:15:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	??
2008-07-14T02:46:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	the nvidia-logo showed up ... and then parts of the screen were blank ... after a while a small part became visible ... all was very slow ... the mouse-cursor didn't move for a while
2008-07-14T02:58:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	now what?
2008-07-14T02:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	I am not sure, possibly try envyng if you havn't already
2008-07-14T03:00:00.000Z	mado-ka	Jordan_U	... what do i have to do?
2008-07-14T03:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	Not sure if it will help, but install envyng from synaptic / apt then use it ( Applications -> System Tolls I think ) to install the newest nvidia drivers
2008-07-14T03:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mado-ka	No, envyng-gtk
