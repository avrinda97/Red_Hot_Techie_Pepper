2005-01-16T10:06:00.000Z	ycco		can't seem to get the touch pad working.
2005-01-16T10:06:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	which pad is it?
2005-01-16T10:06:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	it is built into my Dell Inspiron 7500 laptop
2005-01-16T10:07:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	should be synaptic i think
2005-01-16T10:07:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	does it not work at all?
2005-01-16T10:07:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	here is what I added to my menu.lst
2005-01-16T10:07:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	that will be dealt with by xfree config
2005-01-16T10:08:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	it moves the mouse.... but doesn't allow you to "click"
2005-01-16T10:08:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	thats set in the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 under the mouse settings
2005-01-16T10:10:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	do dmesg | grep Synaptics and see if anything comes up
2005-01-16T10:12:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	do grep synaptics /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2005-01-16T10:13:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	try lowercase s
2005-01-16T10:13:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	didn't work that way either.  (didn't find anything)
2005-01-16T10:14:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	this link should help you out, you need the synaptics driver and some settings in the XFREE Conf http://madpenguin.org/cms/?m=show&id=887
2005-01-16T10:14:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	k, I'll read.
2005-01-16T10:15:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	sites not resolving.
2005-01-16T10:16:00.000Z	pybe	ycco	never mind i think is apt-get-able
2005-01-16T10:32:00.000Z	ycco	pybe	yeah, that didn't seem to do it.  :/
