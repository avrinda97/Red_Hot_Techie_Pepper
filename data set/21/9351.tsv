2006-03-05T07:21:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	what printer do you have/
2006-03-05T07:24:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	ubuntu comes with a driver for your printer.
2006-03-05T07:26:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	not quite.
2006-03-05T07:26:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	You are running gnome?
2006-03-05T07:26:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	System-Admin-Printing, tell it to add a new printer.
2006-03-05T07:27:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	is it detected automatically?
2006-03-05T07:28:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	how is it connected?
2006-03-05T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	pick one or the other. I would start with 2100
2006-03-05T07:33:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	if you have the foomatic-filters-ppds package installed, you will find a ppd for your printer in usr/share/ppd/Canon/Canon-BJC-2100-bjc600.ppd.gz
2006-03-05T07:37:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	what have you done, and where do you see this error?
2006-03-05T07:40:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	what do you use to install ubuntu packages? Synaptic or apt-get?
2006-03-05T07:42:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	do you still have the New Printer dialog open?
2006-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	Have you selected Local Printer and the Printer Port?
2006-03-05T07:45:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	okay, when you click Forward, do you get to where you select the driver?
2006-03-05T07:46:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	the one where your printer is connected, probably something like USB #1 or /dev/usblp0 or /dev/usb/lp0
2006-03-05T07:49:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	there aren't that many choices.
2006-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	USB #1 then (like I said above).
2006-03-05T07:54:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	what error message, and where?
2006-03-05T07:58:00.000Z	soundray	navaneeth	okay.
