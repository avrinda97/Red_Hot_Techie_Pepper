2012-09-13T01:57:00.000Z	PoolShark_		this setup isn't that complex.. it's just a win 3.11 VM on the same network as everythign else in my house
2012-09-13T01:57:00.000Z	PoolShark_		except this VM heh
2012-09-13T01:58:00.000Z	PoolShark_		and I'm sure it's just the ancientness of WIn 3.11
2012-09-13T01:58:00.000Z	PoolShark_		but i thought I'd ask anyway
2012-09-13T01:58:00.000Z	PoolShark_		my life is pretty boring :)
2012-09-13T01:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	Win 3.11 doesn't come with TCP/IP support, so all bets are off
2012-09-13T02:07:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	I have TCPIP for WFW installed
2012-09-13T02:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	masochist, take your sick deviant behaviour out of here
2012-09-13T02:08:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	lol :p
2012-09-13T02:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	now, I must get back to porting Fig-Forth to a 1980s synthesizer...
2012-09-13T02:08:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	I don't suppose I should tell you about my Tandy 1000 VM running Deskmate
2012-09-13T02:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	#ubuntu-offtopic, or possibly #classiccmp ;-)
2012-09-13T02:09:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	okay okay I'll shut up now
2012-09-13T02:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	I'll leave you with this thought: http://gordonjcp.github.com/miragetools/
2012-09-13T02:11:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	that's pretty kickass
2012-09-13T02:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	it's fun poking the sound chip directly
2012-09-13T02:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	Forth is a fun language
2012-09-13T02:12:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	I poke chips all the time (I'm an EE)
2012-09-13T02:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	I don't get to do it nearly as much as I'd like to, but I spend a lot of time repairing stuff
2012-09-13T02:14:00.000Z	PoolShark_	gordonjcp	It can get tiresome especially when you're debugging stuff... so why my whole 311 project is about is establishing a link between two 19.2k v.32 modems using the 6kHz audio channel in a 2-meter FM Ham Radio instead of the copper phone lines, to successfully dial into a BBS
2012-09-13T02:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PoolShark_	#ubuntu-offtopic, this sounds like fun
