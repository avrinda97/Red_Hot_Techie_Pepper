2007-01-15T17:27:00.000Z	bruenig	bucketfan99	sudo apt-get install apt-file, then sudo apt-file update, then sudo apt-file show X package
2007-01-15T17:27:00.000Z	bucketfan99	bruenig	trying now thanks :)

2007-01-15T17:28:00.000Z	bucketfan99		its from a .deb not on the mirrors tho
2007-01-15T17:28:00.000Z	bucketfan99		daemontools
2007-01-15T17:28:00.000Z	bruenig		oh dpkg then
2007-01-15T17:28:00.000Z	bucketfan99		how do you use dpkg to list the files from it ?
2007-01-15T17:29:00.000Z	bucketfan99		i have never figured this out :(
2007-01-15T17:29:00.000Z	bucketfan99	bruenig	i know if i still have the .deb i can dpkg -c file.deb
2007-01-15T17:29:00.000Z	bucketfan99		but if i DONT have the deb..
2007-01-15T17:30:00.000Z	bruenig	bucketfan99	well apt-file should work
2007-01-15T17:30:00.000Z	bucketfan99		doesn't :)

2007-01-15T17:33:00.000Z	bruenig	bucketfan99	I was getting mixed up with the capital L, I was trying to do it on mine but with lowercase l and was obviously having problems
