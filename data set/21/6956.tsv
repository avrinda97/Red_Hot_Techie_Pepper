2007-01-19T09:05:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	what does the command hostname return?
2007-01-19T09:07:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	you mean if i start the server? it says that it could not determine the fqdn, using 127.... blah blah.....and that httpd is already running
2007-01-19T09:07:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	no, the command 'hostname' is run from a terminal
2007-01-19T09:28:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	you in?
2007-01-19T09:29:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	nahh....optimus pointed out that cox blocks port 80.... so i gotta go back and change the port at my router
2007-01-19T12:49:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	uuh - need a reminder as to yr situation
2007-01-19T12:51:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	i installed apache webserver, supposedly got it running... now im logged onto my ubuntu machine remotely via ssh & cygwin and im trying to get apache running.  optimus pointed out that cox blocks port 80, so i had my bro change it to 8181 for port forwarding at the router....
2007-01-19T12:52:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	i edited ports.conf for port change, restarted the server, then typed in my ip in my browser and it still gets nothing
2007-01-19T12:53:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	this is so different from the way i would have proceeded that i will not be of help -
2007-01-19T12:55:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	sorry - forgot that ports.conf is the new apache config file - did you change your default sites-enabled file to respond to 8181?
2007-01-19T12:56:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	i edited ports.conf to include port 8181 instead of 80.... is there another file i need to edit?
2007-01-19T12:57:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	i THINK so
2007-01-19T12:57:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	do you use virtual domains in apache?
2007-01-19T12:58:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	can we go to #ubuntu-classroom to continue - it is too noisy here for me
2007-01-19T13:00:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	im in that channel.....
2007-01-19T13:20:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	i think that line was a restrictor on a particular directory - if you want to pastebin the file i can look at it
2007-01-19T13:21:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	you should not need to allow specific ips for general web access
2007-01-19T13:24:00.000Z	Rio	mnoir	what file did you want to look at?
2007-01-19T13:29:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	he knew cuz 'w3m ip' forced you up to the router to get back down to apache
2007-01-19T13:47:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	:)  1. Nothing is ever easy.  2.  The apache part is not that tough but routing issues can be bewildering
2007-01-19T14:12:00.000Z	mnoir	Rio	now you can study up to answer the next routing question :)
