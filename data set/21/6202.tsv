2007-05-11T14:46:00.000Z	m0u5e		i just wanna figure out how i can set my xmms player to have a "add to playerlist" mode... i can do it manually using "xmms -e -Q" but i want to incorporate it into nautilus :(
2007-05-11T14:47:00.000Z	m0u5e		hmm ubuntu comes with crappy mouse drivers
2007-05-11T14:47:00.000Z	m0u5e		its not detecting my intellimouse sidebuttons :(
2007-05-11T14:47:00.000Z	m0u5e		anyone know where i can find intellimouse driver support?
2007-05-11T14:48:00.000Z	m0u5e		ooh awesome
2007-05-11T14:48:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	you don't need driver support, just config to use thm
2008-04-18T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	no.  nobody does.  And hardy questions are in #ubuntu+1
2008-04-18T12:59:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	i've asked in there too ;__;
2008-07-30T14:11:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	that's not really necessary.
2008-07-30T14:12:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	sorry, heh
2008-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	the best way to use backports is to not enable it as a repo
2008-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	but I want other backport apps
2008-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	flash is the only thing I dont want
2008-07-30T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	Alright, well, if you must, pin flash to 9.0*
2008-07-30T14:23:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	i do want flash updates though, just not through backports, there is no way to pin it to hardy recommended / security?
2008-07-30T14:24:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	hardy[non-backports] will all be 9.0.*
2008-07-31T01:25:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	please take that to #ubuntu-offtopic, thanks
2008-11-09T15:05:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager#Automatic%20%20Keyring
2008-11-09T15:05:00.000Z	Flannel	m0u5e	See the section section regarding changing it
2008-11-09T15:07:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	it just says /bash: /usr/lib/libpam-keyring/pam-keyring-tool: No such file or directory :(
2008-11-09T15:08:00.000Z	m0u5e	Flannel	shouldn't the keyring password be the users password by default? i think it would get really confusing for a user to change his/her password and the keyring password to not change as well
