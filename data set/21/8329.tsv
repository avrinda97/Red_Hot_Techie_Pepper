2010-11-20T07:48:00.000Z	magicjoe		what files do i need to delete or change to cause my login screen to go back to default settings?
2010-11-20T07:49:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 how did you change it
2010-11-20T07:50:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 you are talking about  where  you put user name  and password  ...yes?
2010-11-20T07:51:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	  you could reset gnome to its defaults...I believe that should reset the log in screen
2010-11-20T07:51:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 however I havent tried it so I am not sure
2010-11-20T07:52:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 if you want to reset gnome to default  run this command and reboot    sudo rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity   then restart X
2010-11-20T07:53:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 well that is essentially going to reset gnome to the way it was after you first installed it
2010-11-20T07:53:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 mmm
2010-11-20T07:53:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 how did the login screen change in the first place?
2010-11-20T07:53:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 oh behind where you inter password?
2010-11-20T07:54:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 which package was this?

2010-11-20T07:57:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 now one thing about that... it will open the apprearance propterties window as root
2010-11-20T07:57:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	  you go to the background tab and choose an image
2010-11-20T07:57:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 yeah right click that link and "open in browser"

2010-11-20T07:57:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 read it
2010-11-20T07:58:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 then  remember to follow the directions again so that when you log off it doesn bring up that dialog
2010-11-20T08:04:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 yes you have to log out after running the first command
2010-11-20T08:05:00.000Z	coz_	magicjoe	 then when you have chosen the background image  ,, log back in and then run the second commad  to prevent the dialog from opening each time
