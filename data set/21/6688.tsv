2007-02-18T06:24:00.000Z	nickreynolds		i am connected to the internet via DSL  throught a router. I want to use my ubuntu machine as a firewall, file sharing system, email and web server. I would like to make so that  when a workstation connects to my router either by wireless or wire it must authenticated throught the ubuntu machine before it can access files or the internet. These workstations are windows xp based, can such a thing be done and what would it ta
2007-02-18T06:26:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	In general, yes, such a thing can be done.   Should it be done with ubuntu, Idaknow.
2007-02-18T06:26:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	There are actually specific linux distros for doing just such a thing, which might be better.  I'm not up on this area.  There may actually be ubuntu-based versions of that.
2007-02-18T06:27:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	In general, you need two network cards in the box, one for the itnernal network and one for the extgernal.
2007-02-18T06:28:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Okay then.  So see my previous comment.  I suspect you're better off with a distro that's designed to act as a firewall.
2007-02-18T06:28:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	It does?
2007-02-18T06:30:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	This modern trend of referring to ip stack applications for doing packet filtering as "firewalls" is really annoying, but.
2007-02-18T06:31:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	By definition, a firewall is a distinct piece of hardware that *just* takes packets in one side and puts them out the other.  The idea of a firewall being an application you install on the machine you're trying to protect is oxymoronic and confuses the issue.  Sadly, this usage of the term has caught on in the public mind.  However, if you're talking about serious network protection, you should probably learn the r
2007-02-18T06:32:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	"software firewall" is oxymoronic because the whole idea of a firewall is that you have a machine that enforces access policies and has nothing else installed on it, and no other way for anyone but the administrator to interact with it.
2007-02-18T06:33:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Software firewalls are inherently less secure than real firewalls, because they live in the same ecosystem as the OS and apps  that might be compromised, and are hence dependent on that OS and apps.
2007-02-18T06:33:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Technically, no. It's more of a firewall than a software firewall, though.  This is not to say that hter is _no_ value in something like zonealarm, security should be an in-depth thing.
2007-02-18T06:34:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	I think you'd get far less grief from network administrators for calling your linksys router a firewall than for calling zonealarm a firewall :-)".
2007-02-18T06:36:00.000Z	nickreynolds	puff	I see what your saying, if i use the same machine for my firewall and my web server  it could comprimised from an outside source via the web server. Then my local network would be vunerable. A firewall should be one box and nothing else but a firewall
2007-02-18T06:36:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Bingo.
2007-02-18T06:37:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Though security is _always_ a question of tradeoffs and "How secure is it?" rather than "is it secure or not?".  These days it's far more common to see general-purpose firewall/gateway/router/proxy/printserver boxes.

2007-02-18T06:50:00.000Z	nickreynolds	puff	thank you
2007-02-18T06:58:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Yes.
2007-02-18T06:59:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	It is generally, AFAIK, the most widely used command-line program.  It's basically a "kinder, gentler apt".
2007-02-18T07:04:00.000Z	puff	nickreynolds	Might be, depends on whether or not they left ssh in there.
