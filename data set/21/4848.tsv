2008-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	DeusDeus		Does Ubuntu support WPA2?  I see it on the list and I'm typing my password in correctly but I refuses to connect.  Where can I find an error log or something that can help me figure out what the problem is?
2008-01-29T08:18:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	you have the intel ipw3945 with that?
2008-01-29T08:18:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	How would I check?  The school just gave me this computer a few days ago
2008-01-29T08:19:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	this is the thinkpad r60?
2008-01-29T08:19:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	yes
2008-01-29T08:19:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	open up a terminal and type lspci
2008-01-29T08:22:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	It says "Intel Corporation Pro/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection (rev 02)
2008-01-29T08:22:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	it does support wpa2
2008-01-29T08:22:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	Yes, I have had friends with the same model computer use my wpa2 network
2008-01-29T08:28:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	I have a router that is running DD-WRT and I have had no issues connecting to it with my macbook and my friends have had no issues connecting to it with their Thinkpads
2008-01-29T08:30:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	I can see my network being broadcast on my list of wireless networks.  When I attempt to join it asks for the password (which I copied and pasted from the router screen into the Ubuntu box) and the icon just shows that it is attempting to connect...it says "Waiting for Network Key for the wireless network"
2008-01-29T08:30:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	yes; I have had that issue as well--the culprit imo is network-manager--I just set up the connection from the terminal (actually Konsole here) and it is rock solid
2008-01-29T08:31:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	Thanks I'll see if I can google and figure it out from here unless you have any suggestions about that
2008-01-29T08:32:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	is this a network you use often? do you switch between networks?
2008-01-29T08:33:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	ubuntuforums have a very thorough guide on how to do it manually with the various iterations of encryption
2008-01-29T08:33:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	are there other network managers that I could try
2008-01-29T08:33:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	I could cut and paste here but then floodbot would kick me ;[
2008-01-29T08:34:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	I'll see what I can find in the forums.  Thanks for your help
2008-01-29T08:35:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	if it is too daunting come back--best to read up a bit on how to do it via the command line--I have found network-manager and knetwork-manager to be a pain in the posterior
2008-01-29T08:35:00.000Z	DeusDeus	bazhang	actually in looking at the forums it suggests to have MAC filtering disabled which doesn't make much sense
2008-01-29T08:36:00.000Z	bazhang	DeusDeus	right; and not something you can control when it is the schools router
