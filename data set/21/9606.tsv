2009-08-09T09:16:00.000Z	tread		Can anyone recommend a good VPN client for gnome?  I know the built-in network-manager does it, but it seems to do it pretty badly.  Kvpnc is great, but, well, it's for KDE and runs funny under gnome.  Any suggestions?

2009-08-09T09:17:00.000Z	th0r	tread	there is a pptpvpn client but it has to be run via cli...not a gui
2009-08-09T09:17:00.000Z	tread	th0r	right, i'm looking for a GUI front-end
2009-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	th0r	tread	so am I...I dumped network mangler in favour of wicd...which doesn't do vpn...so I need to set it up right now via cli
2009-08-09T09:21:00.000Z	tread	th0r	is there a command line utility that makes it *easy*?  I just don't want to have to edit a bunch of config files by hand.  I wouldn't mind a simple `some-vpn-client -options gateway:port username password` or something similar though.
2009-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	th0r	tread	actually, I take the time to put together a little script so I don't have to keep remembering the command line. I have only set up a couple of vpn's but as I recall it is that simple....a single command line with various switches and options
2009-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	th0r	tread	give me a sec and I will tell you
2009-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	th0r	tread	vpnc for cisco vpn, pptp-linux for pptp
2009-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	tread	th0r	thanks i'll check it out.
2009-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	th0r	tread	and openvpn makes three
2009-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	tread	th0r	well i know there are gnome front-ends (other than net-man) for openvnc and vpnc.  i think pptp-linux only has network-manager-pptp though.
2009-08-09T09:28:00.000Z	th0r	tread	since I didn't have a need for them at the moment I just installed them and made sure they were working...didn't really pursue the gui
2009-08-09T09:35:00.000Z	tread	th0r	i'm reading the pptp-linux docs, but it seems as if you do have to edit a bunch of config files in order to set up a vpn connection.
2009-08-09T09:35:00.000Z	th0r	tread	man pptp? it looked like everything could be specified on the command line but I may have missed something. Towards the bottom of the man page is an example command for accessing a vpn
2009-08-09T09:35:00.000Z	tread	th0r	here's what i'm looking at: http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/howto-ubuntu.phtml#configure_by_hand
2009-08-09T09:36:00.000Z	th0r	tread	look at the Examples in the man page for pptp
2009-08-09T23:08:00.000Z	th0r	tread	I hate to say it, but my experience is that network manager is just not ready for prime time. From what I have read and experienced you will have to do a vpn the old way
2009-08-09T23:11:00.000Z	tread	th0r	ah hi again.  i really can't figure out how to do it in one shell command (without first needing to edit config files).  The Kvpnc front-end works perfectly.. except that it can't disconnect from the VPN without crashing and making me restart X.  The forums say the newer version doesn't have that problem, but it's not in the Ubuntu repos yet.
2009-08-09T23:39:00.000Z	tread	th0r	hate to ask, but if it's not too much trouble for you, would you be willing to send me one of the vpn scripts you set up so i can use it as an example to work from?  (feel free to delete any personal info in the file first, of course)?
2009-08-09T23:40:00.000Z	th0r	tread	didn't keep them. Semi-retired now and don't have a need for them any more.
