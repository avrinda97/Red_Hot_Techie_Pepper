2011-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	sdollins		I swear to $deity, I am going to scream. :( Everytime I reboot something else breaks lol..
2011-05-03T13:16:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	What's broken lastly?
2011-05-03T13:18:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	On maverick on on Natty? (beginning of the mess)
2011-05-03T13:19:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	Ä±s it OK now? After reboot?
2011-05-03T13:21:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	I have a report from my brother-in-law. he's on Maverick and says that wireless is broken. It interrupts randomly. I'll go and see. Your sitiation sounded similar.
2011-05-03T13:24:00.000Z	sdollins	marenostrum	any luck with that?
2011-05-03T13:25:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	He doesn't know GNU/Linux well. I should pay a visit. I don't know what is broken.
2011-05-03T13:28:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	Try to figure out the problem and bug report if you can do. But, clean install is the solution, of course. :)
2011-05-03T13:29:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	Which one? wireless thing? Can you supply me with the address?
2011-05-03T13:29:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	I see.
2011-05-03T13:31:00.000Z	sdollins	marenostrum	I can't remember if you said or not but is he using broadcom drivers?
2011-05-03T13:32:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	Most probably. Yes. :)
2011-05-03T13:32:00.000Z	sdollins	marenostrum	It appears after I upgraded to natty it stopped using the broadcom drivers but they stayed enabled.
2011-05-03T13:33:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	At first, I have had to install some 3rd party driver for him. I don't remember the name.
2011-05-03T13:34:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	good news for his problem. So maybe when I upgrade him there won't be such a problem.
2011-05-03T14:00:00.000Z	sdollins	marenostrum	It seems I've /fixed/ it or it's just cooperating for more than 1 reboot.
2011-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	Nice to hear. :)
2011-05-03T14:17:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	I'm with you. No one says that LTS is more stable than a non-LTS release. LTS is just long term. For those server things; not to have need to install, upgrade every 6 months. Bug is bug. Fault is fault. No matter in LTS or non-LTS.
2011-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	I see. fresh install!
2011-05-03T14:23:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	What's in your mind? Alternative?
2011-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	marenostrum	sdollins	If to be frank, I'm not a fan of Unity as well. I don't have a netbook and I still don't see the point why I should use it on a desktop. But I trust ubuntu leading team and I'll seriously try it and try to see what's in it for me. We know Gnome 2. And we'll see Gnome 3 as well. For now, Ubuntu Natty's two choice is OK for me. If not Unity, there's classical choice.
