2007-02-20T14:15:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	OpenOffice is very good.  You can also try Abiword or the Koffice suite
2007-02-20T14:15:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	i mean ir must conform to the IEEE format, do u have any experience with these tools
2007-02-20T14:16:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	which IEEE format?  can you point me to a link on the interweb that discusses which format you are trying to conform to?
2007-02-20T14:17:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	is what macd said what you are referring to?
2007-02-20T14:18:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/index.html
2007-02-20T14:18:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	thanks
2007-02-20T14:20:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	are you wanting to conform to these (http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs_iportals/iportals/publications/journmag/transactions/TRANS-JOUR.doc) rules?
2007-02-20T14:20:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	one minute
2007-02-20T14:20:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	yes.
2007-02-20T14:20:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	maybe take a quick look at the PDF file just below that link >> http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs_iportals/iportals/publications/journmag/transactions/TRANS-JOUR.pdf
2007-02-20T14:21:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	but i wish to know what universities use widely and want to get acquainted with the tools., openoffice is very good and quite easy with this template
2007-02-20T14:21:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	thanks for the info
2007-02-20T14:22:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	i think OpenOffice is a good app to use...plus, I *believe* you can quickly convert any file to a PDF document as well
2007-02-20T14:22:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	sure :-)
2007-02-20T14:23:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	what I meant to say was, you can export any file to PDF
2007-02-20T14:23:00.000Z	kuchcha	ciscosurfer	got the point
2007-02-20T14:24:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	abiword is just a word processor
2007-02-20T14:25:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	kuchcha	you can install and use both and then decide which one you like  using better
