2008-04-16T04:00:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	well, if the directory you copied stuff into already had files and directories, obviously they won't match
2008-04-16T04:02:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	no but there are single files not even in dirs in /home/olderuser, but there are no files like this in /home/newuser
2008-04-16T04:02:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	it's also missing the dirs and in fact i can't see one thing it has copied, i'm viewing from inside the gui, perhaps a restart is required?
2008-04-16T04:03:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	try it again .. this time do this..    cp -avR /src /dest
2008-04-16T04:04:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	aye aye, ty
2008-04-16T04:05:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	before i key in that command, i just noticed the two dir match exactly in file size...
2008-04-16T04:05:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	this might be better.   rsync -av /src/  /dest/
2008-04-16T04:06:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	*nods*
2008-04-16T04:09:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	within a second i got the output: building file list ... done * sent 90496 bytes  received 20 bytes  60344.00 bytes/sec * total size is 20032805696  speedup is 221317.84 *** but the files still aren't visible
2008-04-16T04:09:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	verify using ls..   ls -l ,*
2008-04-16T04:12:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	it has copied the whole olduser dir, including the dir itself, into olduser
2008-04-16T04:13:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	well, is that what you wanted?
2008-04-16T04:13:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	it has copied the whole olduser dir, including the dir itself, into newuser (edited this line)
2008-04-16T04:14:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	no because it has placed the actual dir olduser, inside newsuer. i want olduser to *become newuser
2008-04-16T04:16:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	i'm not sure what you have done there .. but why don't you just backup newuser   mv  newuser newuser.bak   and then    cp -avR  olduser  newuser
2008-04-16T04:18:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	can i skip the backup of newuser, there's nothing in newuser home dir, i just reinstalled ubuntu
2008-04-16T04:28:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	after i did the cp -avR olduser newuser my terminal has stopped outputting text and i get the line (arg: 3) but no command prompt
2008-04-16T04:31:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	i;m not convinced you ran the command as i asked you to .. newuser was not supposed to exit, it was supposed to be renamed to newuser.bak
2008-04-16T04:33:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	make sure newuser is backed up..  mv newuser  newuser.bak   and then check if it really exists .. once you have done that ..   cp -avR olduser newuser
2008-04-16T04:33:00.000Z	unop__	crazytalk_	remember, newuser should not exist prior to the cp command
2008-04-16T04:51:00.000Z	crazytalk_	unop__	is there anything wrong with me using the gui to show hidden files in olduser and jsut copying them to new user?
