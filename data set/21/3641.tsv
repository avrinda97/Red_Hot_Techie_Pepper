2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	firestarter
2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	what about ufw
2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	lol, if you already know of one, why are you asking me
2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	i think at least one of them is a frontend for iptables anyway
2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	maybe both
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	because I wanted to know others, so do you know if firestarter is better than ufw ?
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	what are you trying to do, linux is secure enough
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	to get them do you just type sudo apt-get install firestarter/ufw ?
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	close unnecessary services, you're good to go, and yes
2008-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	if someone in my network has cain and abel he can get my passwords and sites if you don't have a firewall
2008-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	you're dumb, sorry
2008-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	huh ?
2008-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	crack hashed passes for UNIX with cain and abel?
2008-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	it's not possible ?
2008-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	they can use jack the ripper, it doesnt matter, if someone wnated to crack your system, a firewall probably wouldn't stop them
2008-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	anyone that serious won tbe coming after you though, just script kiddies, which will be dumbfounded to see you use a unix system
2008-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	so cain and abel doesn't work if the client has linux running eh ?
2008-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	christo_m	gigel2007	i dont remember cain and abel being to crack anything but windows passes, but i may be wrong
2008-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	gigel2007	christo_m	jpg_ny: ok, Thanks guys ! But can you recommend which firewall is better, your opinio of course , ufw or firestarter?
