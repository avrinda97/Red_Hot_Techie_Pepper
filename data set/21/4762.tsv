2008-09-12T05:13:00.000Z	bert1		hi, is there a room here for nautilus questions?
2008-09-12T05:13:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	not specifically. Try and ask here
2008-09-12T05:17:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	I don't think so. It may be possible to extend nautilus with a script. I usually run 'jpeginfo *.jpg' or 'file *.png' in a terminal
2008-09-12T05:18:00.000Z	bert1	soundray	what i want to do is this...
2008-09-12T05:19:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	what image format are they?
2008-09-12T05:20:00.000Z	bert1	soundray	a mixture of jpg and png
2008-09-12T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	it's not simple. Remember, nautilus is a general purpose file manager, not an image manager
2008-09-12T05:22:00.000Z	bert1	soundray	yeah its looking that way... I guess i need to find an app to do it...
2008-09-12T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	either that, or do it in the terminal
2008-09-12T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	how many files need sorting?
2008-09-12T05:23:00.000Z	bert1	soundray	^^^
2008-09-12T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	and how many different sizes are there?
2008-09-12T05:26:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	okay, here's a sample procedure for moving png files that are 1280x800 in size:
2008-09-12T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	create the target folder with 'mkdir 1280x800', then run    file *.png | grep "1280 x 800" | cut -f : -d 1 | xargs -i cp '{}' 1280x800/
2008-09-12T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	no, you should cd to the source folder first
2008-09-12T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	if you don't, the command will have to be adapted
2008-09-12T05:33:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	for the jpeg files, you need to 'sudo apt-get install jpeginfo' and modify the command somewhat
2008-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	jpeginfo | grep "1280 x 800" | cut -f " " -d 1 | xargs -i cp '{}' 1280x800/
2008-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	arrgh, mistake
2008-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	jpeginfo *.png | grep "1280 x 800" | cut -f " " -d 1 | xargs -i cp '{}' 1280x800/
2008-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	bert1	note, this will create copies rather than moving the files. If the copying works, you can try moving instead -- it will be faster.
