2008-04-26T08:50:00.000Z	regis		hello,i have a problem with nvidia drivers: i can startx after : killing X server(because of the failsafe mode),rmmod nvidia insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/volatile/nvidia_new.ko and then startx...but how can i make the module load and remplace the stock nvidia
2008-04-26T08:51:00.000Z	regis		modprobe nvidia_new doesn't load the nvidia_new kernel module...i think i must edit the modules configuration files at /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic
2008-04-26T08:51:00.000Z	regis		but hoz do i do that?
2008-04-26T08:51:00.000Z	regis		s/hoz/how
2008-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	I'm troubleshooting a problem with nvidia_new too
2008-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	The "Hardware Drivers" window has nvidia_new checked as being enabled, but it still says "not in use"
2008-04-26T08:53:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	turns out that's because the nvidia-glx-new package isn't seen as being available, because the installer apparently didn't download any package lists during installation
2008-04-26T08:53:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	ah...mabe try manualy: killall Xorg log into console,rmmod nvidia,insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/volatile/nvidia_new.ko, startx and look at the dmesg logs
2008-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	ah ok so install it...i used envyng manual installation...
2008-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	Actually, all I did was "sudo apt-get update"
2008-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	then re-open the hardware drivers window, and it works as expected (shows the nVidia driver not-enabled until I click on it, and then installs the driver package)
2008-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	ok
2008-04-26T08:56:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	You don't need to modprobe nvidia_new manually
2008-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	i need to do it automaticaly but it modprobes the wrong nvidia driver
2008-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	wrong driver?
2008-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	yes...when it startx it goes in failsafe mode unless i insmod nvidia_new manualy
2008-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	Why are you using startx, first of all?
2008-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	because after killing X gdm doesn't start
2008-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	Wyzard	regis	but X does start initially?
2008-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	no
2008-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	regis	Wyzard	so what should i do?
