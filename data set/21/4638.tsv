2008-04-08T13:14:00.000Z	[[thufir]]		is there some problem with installing PHP curl?
2008-04-08T13:15:00.000Z	[[thufir]]		I get an error when installing curl:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/62487/
2008-04-08T13:16:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	run this first .. sudo aptitude update
2008-04-08T13:17:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	will do.   I'm doing updates through the GUI at the moment.  same thing?
2008-04-08T13:18:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	yes, and if you are updating via the GUI that could be the reasons apt-get fails at the CLI
2008-04-08T13:19:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	 I only started trying the GUI update when the curl install failed.  it's chugging away
2008-04-08T13:19:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	ok, let that finish first then
2009-05-13T05:34:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	you want subversion .. it provides svn
2009-05-13T05:34:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	subversion fails to install from apt  http://pastebin.com/m631e8da8
2009-05-13T05:35:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	 dpkg -l | grep -i subversion   #??
2009-05-13T05:36:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	hmm ..
2009-05-13T05:37:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	 it used to be installed, I wonder if it's a multiverse thing.
2009-05-13T05:37:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	 make sure you have the main repository enabled
2009-05-13T05:37:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	http://pastebin.com/m788338cf
2009-05-13T05:38:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	yea, it looks like you had it installed at one point .. but aptitude can't find it anymore, make sure you have the repository enabled then update aptitude
2009-05-13T05:42:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	I'm not quite sure what's wrong with the repos file:  http://pastebin.com/m50177064  but I'm still researching it
2009-05-13T05:43:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	  apt-cache policy subversion
2009-05-13T05:45:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	i take it you have run.    aptitude update   #?
2009-05-13T05:46:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	yes, I ran aptitude update, will do that again.   I forget, something about clearing the cache, too?
2009-05-13T05:47:00.000Z	unop	[[thufir]]	you shouldn't need to but   aptitude autoclean
2009-05-13T05:48:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	unop	that seems to have done the trick, it's installing (hopefully) niow
