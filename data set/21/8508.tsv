2008-07-27T14:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp		when I reboot, I find that the permissions of some devices have changed
2008-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp		how can I make permissions in /dev/ stick across reboots?
2008-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	you should not be assigning or modifying permissions on devices.
2008-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	oh?
2008-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr		!doesn't work | InfecteX
2008-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	so how do you suggest I create new devices?
2008-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	instead, add your user to the group that has rights to the device. Fiddling with /dev permissions is a short way down the path of "help I can't boot because my disk disappeared"
2008-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	that works if the device is owned by anything other than root
2008-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	I don't plan on adding every single user into root's group
2008-07-27T14:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	you don't add them to the root group. What device are you trying to access?
2008-07-27T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	a USB serial device, for which I've written a driver
2008-07-27T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	when I load the kernel module it all works, but Ubuntu likes to tamper with the permissions
2008-07-27T14:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	what permissions do you want on it?
2008-07-27T14:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	mode 0660, with an appropriate group and user set
2008-07-27T14:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	the annoying thing is that it clobbers any added character nodes in /dev on reboot anyway
2008-07-27T14:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	have you adjusted the udev rules for your device?
2008-07-27T14:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	no, good point, I should read up on udev
2008-07-27T14:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	that's what is doing the 'clobbering' on boot.
2008-07-27T14:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	fyrestrtr	is there any way to remove udev and just use oldskool /dev ?
2008-07-27T14:34:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gordonjcp	I am not aware; but if there was, it would require a kernel recompile.
