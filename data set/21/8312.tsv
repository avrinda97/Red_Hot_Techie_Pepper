2006-11-19T14:46:00.000Z	leafw		now if only I could get rid of the window frames altogether (what a waste) I would feel completely at home in gnome
2006-11-19T14:47:00.000Z	blind	leafw	I feel ya. The only reason I use window frames is resizing.
2006-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	leafw	blind	I have my own keybindings for everything (resize, move, min/max ...)
2006-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	blind	leafw	:D -- i run eterm with no borders, and transparent as well. but i can't quite get the resize keybindings right.
2006-11-19T14:49:00.000Z	leafw	blind	how do you get the eterm without borders? In KDE it's trivial, just match window settings with window type or title ...
2006-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	blind	leafw	there's options to Eterm. lemme cat my menu file and tell you what they are (im on flux)
2006-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	leafw	blind	on fluxbox I know how to do it, I just wanted it for gnome though
2006-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	blind	leafw	that'll open it like that on any de/wm
2006-11-19T14:52:00.000Z	leafw	blind	it will override metacity's window frame? I doubt it!
2006-11-19T14:52:00.000Z	blind	leafw	give it a try ;)
2006-11-19T14:52:00.000Z	leafw	blind	which of the options you pass to eterm is actually doing so?
2006-11-19T14:53:00.000Z	blind	leafw	my guess would be --scrollbar=off and --buttonbar 0
2006-11-19T14:53:00.000Z	leafw	blind	ok, the button bar
2006-11-19T14:54:00.000Z	blind	leafw	did it work?
2006-11-19T14:54:00.000Z	leafw	blind	just realized, I have aterm but not eterm
2006-11-19T14:55:00.000Z	blind	leafw	haha, im sure you can do it in that as well, check the man file
2006-11-19T14:55:00.000Z	leafw	blind	and I remmeber the problem with eterm is that I can't type tildes on vowels (for non-english languages)
2006-11-19T14:55:00.000Z	blind	leafw	sure you can
2006-11-19T14:56:00.000Z	leafw	blind	then it's not obvious, the encoding I set was the proper one and yet no tildes
2006-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	leafw	blind	for instance this:  aterm -tr -trsb -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-*-120-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 -sr -si -bg white -tn xterm -rv -sh 80 +s
2006-11-19T14:58:00.000Z	leafw	blind	the above is the proper enconding, and yet no tildes.
