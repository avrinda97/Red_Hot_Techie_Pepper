2009-12-28T07:47:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	xorg is in /etc/X11 .. what do you mean by "mine".. your video card?
2009-12-28T07:49:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	no xorg.conf file in /ect/X11
2009-12-28T07:50:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	and my mine i mean: "Why the hell is it using so much memory?"
2009-12-28T07:50:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	they must have completely removed it for 9.10.. you *can* create your own and put it in that location.. what card/driver are you using?
2009-12-28T07:51:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	I'm using the driver that came with ubuntu and it's an ati chip
2009-12-28T07:53:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	yea.. I was struggling with an ati card earlier on my son's computer.. it's a radeon 9600 (av350 or something), older and it also uses the stock driver since there is nothing listed in Hardware Drivers.. it's pretty slow.. never checked to see how much mem it was using but I'll bet a bunch.. my machine has an nvidia.. much easier to configure
2009-12-28T07:54:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	the stock driver sucks
2009-12-28T07:55:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	yep..
2009-12-28T07:55:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	anything i can do about it?
2009-12-28T07:57:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	you could try installing the ati binary blob.. but do a lot of reading on the correct method.. including researching if their driver is compatible with your card and xorg 7.1+  .. some cards aren't.. also you'll probably have to reinstall with each kernel upgrade
2009-12-28T07:57:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	oh no
2009-12-28T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	installing dkms sometimes helps with the kernel upgrades.
2009-12-28T07:59:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	maybe it will get fixed in an update
2009-12-28T08:00:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	one can only hope :)
2009-12-28T08:00:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	ati's been like this for the last couple of releases
2009-12-28T08:00:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	I never had any issues before 9.10
2009-12-28T08:03:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	it has everything to do with ati and almost nothing to do with ubuntu
2009-12-28T08:03:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	but isn't the driver OSS now?
2009-12-28T08:04:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	yes.. but in their latest design they left out quite a number of cards
2009-12-28T08:04:00.000Z	kcj1993	scunizi	oh
2009-12-28T08:05:00.000Z	scunizi	kcj1993	things should improve..
