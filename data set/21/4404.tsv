2008-05-03T00:53:00.000Z	Takalius		I'm having a problem with Ubuntu Install CD. Buffer I/O error on fd0, Status: {DRDY}
2008-05-03T00:54:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- do you have a floppy drive??
2008-05-03T00:54:00.000Z	Takalius		Yeah, I do
2008-05-03T00:54:00.000Z	Takalius	danand	I do
2008-05-03T00:55:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- is it a removable drive? Dell floppy module?
2008-05-03T00:55:00.000Z	Takalius		Uh
2008-05-03T00:55:00.000Z	Takalius		I don't think so
2008-05-03T00:55:00.000Z	Takalius		Danand - Keep forgetting to highlight - I don't think so.
2008-05-03T00:56:00.000Z	Takalius		Danand - If this helps, I'm using a HP Pavilion 513n, from 2003
2008-05-03T00:57:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- :) I had this problem when installing on my laptop. Does the error message repeat?
2008-05-03T00:57:00.000Z	Takalius	danand	- Yeah. It also seems to do that when I try booting Debian without Single User MOde
2008-05-03T00:59:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- if so leave it a while. Usually the message repeats for a while (5 mins) and then the install carries on as normal. Might be due to over zealous hardware detection on the install cd. Just give it a while...
2008-05-03T00:59:00.000Z	Takalius		...
2008-05-03T01:00:00.000Z	Takalius		Danand - The error keeps repeating itself both when I try using the Ubuntu install CD, and when I try booting Debian outside of Single User Mode
2008-05-03T01:00:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- is the Pavillion a desktop or laptop?
2008-05-03T01:01:00.000Z	Takalius	danand	- Desktop
2008-05-03T01:02:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- do you know if the floppy drive works ok or not? :)
2008-05-03T01:02:00.000Z	Takalius	danand	- I have tried using it before with floppies, and it does not work.
2008-05-03T01:03:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- hmmm.... Have you thought of just unplugging it from the mainboard??
2008-05-03T01:03:00.000Z	Takalius	danand	 - Alright I'll try that after, it should do it. I have to go right now, but thank you for your help
2008-05-03T01:04:00.000Z	danand	Takalius	- np :)
