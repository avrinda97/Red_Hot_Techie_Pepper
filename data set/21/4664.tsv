2008-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	ghindo		I'm trying to transfer files from my laptop to my server over ssh, but I can't seem to get the permissions right.  Can someone help me out?
2008-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	the -p option to scp preserves file perms, is that what you need?
2008-07-21T07:24:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	I don't think so.  Even with the -p option, I get a "Permission denied" message
2008-07-21T07:24:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	Then the files at the remote end are probably not wrteable by you and you are trying to overwrite them?
2008-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	You may need to set them 644 (and directories to 755) before doing the scp
2008-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	How do I do that?
2008-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	Do you have ssh shell access to the remote server?
2008-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	Yes.
2008-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	jmarsden		Then ssh in there and use chmod 0644 somefile, or chmod 644 * or whatever is appropriate
2008-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	jmarsden		or just delete the old files using rm
2008-07-21T07:27:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	Cool, thanks
2008-07-21T07:27:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	No Problem.
2008-07-21T07:31:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	Even after using chmod, I still get a "Permission denied" message: http://paste.ubuntu.com/28882/
2008-07-21T07:32:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	does the user michael own the file /var/www/index.html ?
2008-07-21T07:32:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	If you want to you can try rm /var/www/index.html in the ssh shell first?
2008-07-21T07:34:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	I tried the rm command and I'm still denied permission
2008-07-21T07:34:00.000Z	jmarsden		Then that's not your file.  Do you have root on the remote server?
2008-07-21T07:35:00.000Z	ghindo	jmarsden	I think so?
2008-07-21T07:35:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	This is not a ssh or scp issue at all, just a basic Unix/Linxu file permissions thing.
2008-07-21T07:35:00.000Z	ghindo		Not entirely sure
2008-07-21T07:35:00.000Z	jmarsden	ghindo	So become root on the remote machine and then rm that file.
