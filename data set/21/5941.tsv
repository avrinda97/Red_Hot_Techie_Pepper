2010-02-19T18:44:00.000Z	miniBill	overmind	if I change http to ftp I get connection error 110
2010-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	miniBill		I've got the italian locale, so I dunno the precise error msg
2010-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	overmind	miniBill	Have you got any other repo added to list repos list? For example Tor, Medibuntu...
2010-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	miniBill	overmind	virtualbox and some ppas
2010-02-19T18:45:00.000Z	miniBill	overmind	but google's works
2010-02-19T18:46:00.000Z	overmind	miniBill	Have you tried disabling them and reloading again synaptic's program list?

2010-02-19T18:50:00.000Z	miniBill	overmind	the overall fix was just setting anything .ubuntu.com to ftp, and anything else to http
2010-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	overmind	miniBill	Maybe you had wrong written server link.
2010-02-19T18:52:00.000Z	miniBill	overmind	dunno :) anyway, it now works
2010-02-19T18:53:00.000Z	miniBill	overmind	:( now it complains about no such file or directory when actually updating :/
2010-02-19T18:53:00.000Z	overmind	miniBill	What's the exactly error?
