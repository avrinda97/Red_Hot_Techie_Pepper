2010-09-05T06:43:00.000Z	litropy		how do I check whcih windows manager I;m using? I get a kubuntu flashscreen, kubuntu cursor, but everything else looks like gdm.
2010-09-05T06:43:00.000Z	litropy		ugh, typos.
2010-09-05T06:43:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	ps -e will list every process on the system :)
2010-09-05T06:43:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	If metacity is the gnome window manager.
2010-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	Do you have a gnome-panel or kde panel?
2010-09-05T06:49:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	I see things like gdm-session-worker and gnome-session. but I also see things like kdeinit4 and klauncher, and mutter.
2010-09-05T06:49:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	no metacity
2010-09-05T06:49:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	You have both running together some how for some reason.
2010-09-05T06:50:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	how do I switch to gdm yet still be able to open kde apps?
2010-09-05T06:51:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	Well.  when you log in choose "gnome" in the sessions menu.  The KDE apps will still show up in your menu and they'll work.  You don't have to log into kde (or gnome) to use apps from kde (or gnome).
2010-09-05T06:52:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	the wm just logs in - no pulldown for sessions. How do I get it back?
2010-09-05T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	Do not have to put in your password / username at all?
2010-09-05T06:53:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	correct.
2010-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	Are you in KDE now or gnome?
2010-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	like I said, kde cursor, kde loadscreen, yet gnome-like look. UNR with Unity.
2010-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	gnome
2010-09-05T06:57:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	try this: "gksu gdmsetup"
2010-09-05T06:59:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	I get the pane, I click unlock, and nothing happens. All options are inactive.
2010-09-05T06:59:00.000Z	edbian	litropy	What?  Did you run "gksudo gdmsetup"
2010-09-05T06:59:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	except close
2010-09-05T07:00:00.000Z	litropy	edbian	exactly.
