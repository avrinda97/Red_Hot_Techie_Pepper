2009-08-29T01:20:00.000Z	cmp		ubuntu
2009-08-29T01:21:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	sudo is a command to give you super user rights.. it has nothing to do with installations
2009-08-29T01:41:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	look for the main one... maybe just the file name by itself
2009-08-29T01:48:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	check your applications or press AlT+F2 and enter festival
2009-08-29T01:50:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	you can also try from a terminal: festival &
2009-08-29T01:50:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	try just typing fes-TabKey
2009-08-29T01:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	you know where the tab key is on your keyboard??
2009-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	open a terminal, type these 3 letters "fes" then hit the tab key on your keyboard. Then add a space and put "&" should look something similar to festival &
2009-08-29T02:01:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	pay attention and learn to read help files and forums
2009-08-29T02:14:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	i think your solution may be to use orca
2009-08-29T02:15:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	what is it exactly you are trying to accomplish??
2009-08-29T02:16:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	then orca is the way to go..
2009-08-29T02:17:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	go to terminal and type: sudo apt-get install orca
2009-08-29T02:25:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	no... why don't you try orca or search google
2009-08-29T02:29:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	that's kind of like asking "how do i make my car go faster" it really depends on what you drive
2009-08-29T02:33:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	google around. there are many tweaks for many different uses
2009-08-29T02:34:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	you know most of us learn our own answers with google... and we don't disrespect those that help us
2009-08-29T02:43:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	before i lose it on you and get a nice little kick try things like "ubuntu 9.04 system tweaks fixes upgrades"
2009-08-29T02:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	or try "commercial text to speech applications for linux"
2009-08-29T02:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	cmp	or try " how to use your stupid windows application on ubuntu 9.04 through wine
