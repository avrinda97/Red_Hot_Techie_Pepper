2008-04-11T23:09:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Hi guys - I am installing Ubuntu using the alternate cd text intallation - I am setting up RAID 1. during the MD setup phase, it asks me how many spare devices I want for the RAID1 array. What are these spare devices?
2008-04-11T23:10:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Are they the same as hot spares?
2008-04-11T23:10:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Where I leave a 3rd "spare" drive connected, wich automatically takes over from a failed drive in the active 2-drive array?
2008-04-11T23:10:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	are you sure you want to setup a software raid instead of a hardware raid?
2008-04-11T23:10:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	Not a busy machine.
2008-04-11T23:11:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	kewl. yeah, iirc, those would be spare drives that could be contributed to the array
2008-04-11T23:12:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	I don't need a hot spare. But I have purchased a 3rd hard drive for off-site backups just in case. I was hoping I could "catch up" my off-site backed up data by simply plugging in the 3rd hard drive once a week and mirroring the active drives. Is this possible?
2008-04-11T23:12:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	sure, just don't include it in the array and the OS should see it as a separate drive upon the final installation
2008-04-11T23:13:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	Ok but then can I at a later stage unplug one of the active drives, plug in the dedicated offsite drive, build a mirror of the data on that, and then take it back out again?
2008-04-11T23:14:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	i don't see why not, as long as you follow the MD spec
2008-04-11T23:14:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	Ok cool.
2008-04-11T23:15:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	I could just export the database and copy over the file system - but it would be nice if I could build a mirror on the offsite drive once a week. It would make the swapping out of a failed drive super quick
2008-04-11T23:16:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	i guess it depends on how you want to perform the weekly backup
2008-04-11T23:16:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	like bieb said, rsync would be the perfect option
2008-04-11T23:16:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	Painlessly! :)
2008-04-11T23:16:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	yeah :)
2008-04-11T23:17:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	it's a program that fascilitates backup procedures, and has all of the options that windows backup has (incremental, full, etc), but with the added functionality that windows backup lacks (like doing it over the network and over ssh)
2008-04-11T23:18:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	i do believe the RAID docs explain that :)
2008-04-11T23:19:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	i second bieb's suggestion again ;)
2008-04-11T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	g[r]eek	good luck and have fun :)
2008-04-11T23:40:00.000Z	g[r]eek	Gnea	bieb: Does syncing a new drive in a RAID1 array take hours / days / minutes?
