2008-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	omars		is that right :S
2008-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	omars		omg
2008-12-09T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	omars	try installing the package pastebinit... then run "tail -n 500 | pastebinit"
2008-12-09T01:46:00.000Z	Slart	omars	copy paste the url it prints out here
2008-12-09T01:30:00.000Z	Slart	omars	couldn't open the syslog? "tail /var/log/syslog" doesn't work? error messages?
2008-12-09T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	omars	ok.. what "tail" does is that it prints out the last 10 or so lines from a file.. you actually saw the last 10 lines from the syslog.. which might have been something about wireless connections or something
2008-12-09T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	omars	if you want to open the file in some kind of editor I'd recommend gedit.. so run this "gedit /var/log/syslog"
2008-12-09T01:42:00.000Z	omars	Slart	i tried gedit i got "failed to allocate 1838569966 bytes"
2008-12-09T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	omars	hmm.. sounds like something is not quite right.. have you tried running memtest?
2008-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	Slart	omars	on the other hand, that's quite a lot of memory.. hang on
2008-12-09T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	omars	try installing the package pastebinit... then run "tail -n 500 /var/log/syslog | pastebinit"
2008-12-09T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	omars	last line was wrong..
2008-12-09T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	omars	correct.. it will paste the last 500 lines of your system log to a pastebin and give you the url

2008-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	omars	Slart	maybe it can help to tell you that i use eclipse regularly..
2008-12-09T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	omars	didn't see anything special in there.. the computer just hangs at random times? not when you do something special?
2008-12-09T01:55:00.000Z	Slart	omars	eclipse has it's share of problems.. none of them should bring the ubuntu box down with it though..
2008-12-09T01:58:00.000Z	omars	Slart	btw the performance if very poor, i used hardy and it was much better
2008-12-09T01:59:00.000Z	Slart	omars	have you tried switching java runtimes?
2008-12-09T02:00:00.000Z	omars	Slart	i did, i was trying to make gwt work but it does not support a 64 bit vm so i had to install a 32 bit vm and use it
