2012-11-20T21:58:00.000Z	mllie	escott	yes, but I don't know how to write it correctly there. The mount-command workds
2012-11-20T21:58:00.000Z	mllie	escott	but I want to be able to plug them in after boot also for example
2012-11-20T21:58:00.000Z	escott	mllie	(a) you need to use blkid to identify the proper UUID
2012-11-20T21:59:00.000Z	mllie	escott	blkid?
2012-11-20T21:59:00.000Z	escott	mllie	then it will be roughly "UUID /media/usb0 ntfs uid=1000 0 0"
2012-11-20T22:00:00.000Z	mllie	escott	I see
2012-11-20T22:03:00.000Z	mllie	escott	something like this? 8AE8FF55E8FF3E4F        /media/usb0     ntfs    uid=martin      0       0
2012-11-20T22:03:00.000Z	mllie	escott	in fstab
2012-11-20T22:03:00.000Z	mllie	escott	I just need read-access :)
2012-11-20T22:03:00.000Z	escott	mllie	you shouldn't say "martin" in fstab. it might work but we usually put numbers in fstab
2012-11-20T22:04:00.000Z	mllie	escott	how do I get the uid?
2012-11-20T22:04:00.000Z	escott	mllie	also consider setting gid, and noexec
2012-11-20T22:04:00.000Z	escott	mllie	"id"
2012-11-20T22:05:00.000Z	mllie	escott	better like this? 8AE8FF55E8FF3E4F        /media/usb0     ntfs    uid=1000,gid=1000,noexec        0       0
2012-11-20T22:10:00.000Z	escott	mllie	the selected driver doesn't do writes so the ro is redundant but its no harm to add it
2012-11-20T22:10:00.000Z	escott	mllie	makes your fstab more explicit which is good
2012-11-20T22:10:00.000Z	mllie	escott	theadmin: like this? UUID=8AE8FF55E8FF3E4F   /media/usb0     ntfs    defaults,uid=1000,ro,nofail     0       0
2012-11-20T22:11:00.000Z	escott	mllie	you can customize till your eyes bleed. im sure that is adequate. i would probably throw gid=1000 and noexec on it
2012-11-20T23:07:00.000Z	mllie	escott	maybe you have any idea?
