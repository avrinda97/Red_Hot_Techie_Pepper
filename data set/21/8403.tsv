2012-01-11T11:40:00.000Z	nil		Is there some way to know how to edit konqueror4.7 to work like the kde3.5?
2012-01-11T11:42:00.000Z	ts2	nil	what exactly do you mean?
2012-01-11T11:43:00.000Z	nil	ts2	: in the old version of konqueror it could view photos in pop-ups and preview audio only with a mouse over the file
2012-01-11T11:44:00.000Z	ts2	nil	use dolphin, that's the file manager
2012-01-11T11:46:00.000Z	ts2	nil	konqueror actually uses dolphin to display the files etc, so even if you use konqueror, you _are_ using dolphin
2012-01-11T11:47:00.000Z	ts2	nil	just open dolphin and use the information panel, it shows previews and can play most audio files by default
2012-01-11T11:56:00.000Z	nil	ts2	Do you get the code to compile?
2012-01-11T11:56:00.000Z	ts2	nil	compile what?
2012-01-11T11:58:00.000Z	ts2	nil	that functionality does not exist, use the information panel
2012-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	nil	ts2	But existed.
2012-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	ts2	nil	in another piece of software, KDE 4.x has little to do with KDE 3.x
2012-01-11T12:01:00.000Z	ts2	nil	you don't just need to edit it, you'll need to rewrite it
2012-01-11T12:03:00.000Z	ts2	nil	DCOP no longer exists
2012-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	ts2	nil	I don't really use virtualbox, no
2012-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	ts2	nil	DCOP was used only in KDE3 applications, never in KDE 4.x
2012-01-11T12:05:00.000Z	ts2	nil	that has nothing to do with it using DCOP or not, it's something built-in to applications and no KDE 4.x application uses DCOP, they all use DBus
2012-01-11T12:07:00.000Z	ts2	nil	you may use it with KDE 3.x applications, but not with 4.x, this is not an opinion, this is a fact
2012-01-11T12:09:00.000Z	ts2	nil	that's because that version *is* KDE 3.x version, not the KDE 4.x version
2012-01-11T12:11:00.000Z	nil	ts2	I use the new version of KDE.Kubuntu oineric 11.10.
2012-01-11T12:11:00.000Z	ts2	nil	that has nothing to do with what version of kaffeine you are using, and 0.8.7 is the KDE 3.x version
2012-01-11T12:11:00.000Z	ts2	nil	it ported to KDE 4.x in 1.0
