2010-11-17T08:22:00.000Z	joshdreamland		Did you uninstall and reinstall xorg?
2010-11-17T08:23:00.000Z	izinucs	joshdreamland	google ppa nvidia-vapau.  in that page is a link to the PPA with the latest driver.. add the ppa as a repo and sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade .. and you should have it installed if you tried to install the driver in System>Admin>hardware drivers.
