2012-08-10T16:10:00.000Z	lee8oi		as subdomains, should be fine, as directories? hmm. Maybe its because I've never tried it that it feels strange.
2012-08-10T16:11:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	the browser wont know its dots in the file name since its trying to axcess the root of that folder
2012-08-10T16:12:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	I see online one gentleman says the solution might be "chown -R www-data:www-data filestore"
2012-08-10T16:15:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	are you using a CMS, or are you just setting up the basic apache?
2012-08-10T16:17:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	to be honest, I setup a really awesome server using one of the 'The Perfect Server' howto's, they have one for Ubuntu. You'd be really happy with the results.
2012-08-10T16:18:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	link to that guide ? im reeding the official pdf one.
2012-08-10T16:19:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	Try whatever TJ suggests, but if you do want to check out the tutorial try the one I used: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtoforge.com%2Fperfect-server-ubuntu-12.04-lts-apache2-bind-dovecot-ispconfig-3&ei=PvwkUNedEMrjqgGG8oGwCg&usg=AFQjCNFUbKl1fpXh9_CbwEUf57fK_qdRNg&sig2=4TCI3XFJ04s7QQxAWsfCcw
2012-08-10T16:21:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	I see. thats fair. :)
2012-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	the basic server should have been working out of the box, you must have played with file permissions or something prior to installing apache.
2012-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	the basic server works
2012-08-10T16:27:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	security. the webroot is vulnerable to whatever your user account does. Thats how I see it.
2012-08-10T16:29:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	you can always move stuff there from your account. Its ok to take the lazy way, I've done it before :)
2012-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	im not logged in as root all the time so its probably easier to have the webroot in my home directory :)
2012-08-10T16:33:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	you shouldn't be logged in as root all the time, but you can always use 'sudo cp' to move files.
2012-08-10T16:33:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	im never logged in as root :P im using sudo when i have to :)
2012-08-10T16:34:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	sounds like one of those times ;) lol but again like I said, I've done it that way too. Its not as risky as some might think, but whatever happens on your user account, can potentially affect those files since your user has direct access.
2012-08-10T16:35:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	ofc :) just like i have it in my windows enviroment ;)
2012-08-10T16:35:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	I see :)
2012-08-10T16:40:00.000Z	lee8oi	Plumblum_	use Ubuntu Server to build servers...even if you want to start from scratch and learn
2012-08-10T16:40:00.000Z	Plumblum_	lee8oi	isnt that what im doing ?
