2008-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	Zeker		I'm having a problem installing the nvidia drivers for ubuntu.  When I run the *.run install file, it gives me this error:
2008-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	Zeker		You appear to be running an X server; please exit X before
2008-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	Zeker		         installing.  For further details, please see the section INSTALLING
2008-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	Zeker		         THE NVIDIA DRIVER in the README available on the Linux driver
2008-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	Zeker		         download page at www.nvidia.com.

2008-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	wols_	Zeker	what nvidia card?
2008-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Zeker	wols_	it's a 9600 gt
2008-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	wols_	Zeker	then your current driver is utterly wrong. 96.xx is too old while you had the newer one installed before
2008-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	Zeker	wols_	oh crap!  Is there a wy to revert?
2008-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	wols_	Zeker	uninstall the current one and install the proper one
2008-06-12T12:22:00.000Z	Zeker	wols_	do I use the add/remove programs to do that?
2008-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	Zeker	wols_	i installed the "new" version of the drivers from add/remove programs.  Is this right now?
2008-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	wols_	Zeker	depends what glxinfo now says. you also need to restart X
