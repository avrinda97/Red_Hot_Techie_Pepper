2005-09-30T14:49:00.000Z	daejavu		Can anyone help me ?  with some driver issues ?
2005-09-30T14:50:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	it's better to state your issues. maybe someone will know
2005-09-30T14:50:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	ive downloaded drivers for my S3Unichrome vga chipset ... its comes in 2 files .. a Kernel Src and Bin in tgz format .. which one should i install first ?
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	isn't there a readme file?
2005-09-30T14:52:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	yes there is ... but i was hoping someone has the same chip and might help me from his experience :)
2005-09-30T14:57:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	an i install my Current Kernel Source from CD  ?
2005-09-30T14:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	from the live/install cd?
2005-09-30T14:59:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	ummm yeah .. actually the readme file says to install kernel headers to /usr/src/linux-2.4 direc .. which i think is the kernels source direct ..which i dont have
2005-09-30T15:00:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	so how can i install it ?
2005-09-30T15:00:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	okay, in ubuntu, all kernels are 2.6 AFAIK.
2005-09-30T15:02:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	so how can i get that ? :)
2005-09-30T15:03:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	if u are connected to the net, try apt-get install linux-kernel-headers-`uname -r`
2005-09-30T15:04:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	will that install only the headers or the source as well ?
2005-09-30T15:04:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	only the headers
2005-09-30T15:05:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	so what would i have to do for the source ? (iam sorry i keep bugging u .. i c ur preety busy already :-)  )
2005-09-30T15:05:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	my guess is that you would need to compile the driver against the source (sometimes, kernel headers are enough)
2005-09-30T15:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	bug me all u want, here to help!
2005-09-30T15:07:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	ok .. so if i just isntall the headers as u said .. it will create the directory /usr/src/linux-2.6.    right ?
2005-09-30T15:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	yup
2005-09-30T15:08:00.000Z	daejavu	robotgeek	 thanks dude .. lemme c what happens then .. hope i get something out of that shitty driver ;)
2005-09-30T15:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	daejavu	np
