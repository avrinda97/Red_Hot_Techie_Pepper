2012-03-29T09:26:00.000Z	research4oscar		can anyone provide some good reference material on setting up a developer user group for web development on ubuntu?
2012-03-29T09:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	how about github.com ?
2012-03-29T09:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	if you don't want to use github.com dirrect I guess you could setup a git host of your own on ubuntu
2012-03-29T09:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	you just setup users and groups in git  here are some web interfaces http://stackoverflow.com/questions/438163/whats-the-best-web-interface-for-git-repositories
2012-03-29T09:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	development without version control?
2012-03-29T09:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	I guess that would work as long as each user was working on only his own apps
2012-03-29T09:34:00.000Z	research4oscar	sacarlson	Some of the reading I've done, they talk about creating a group and assigning them to the var/www folder.  Then added users to that group.
2012-03-29T09:35:00.000Z	research4oscar	sacarlson	but I haven't actually found full instructions on how to do that exactly.
2012-03-29T09:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	sure you can do that were a group of users all have rights to change in /var/www ;  you can just make it so that the default user add makes that the case
2012-03-29T09:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	I guess depending on the number of users to add would change the methods needed as manual adding users with users group gui is not hard in numbers of say 10 - 20 users
2012-03-29T09:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	it's just a mater of checking the box in each user to add to www-data group
2012-03-29T09:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	the install of apache2 has already created the group for you,  all you need in this case is to add each user member you wish to the group www-data
2012-03-30T09:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	I can't read enuf into that to make head or tails of it
2012-03-30T09:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	I guess instead of telling what you did at this point tell us what your goal is?
2012-03-30T09:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	limit the bin that the users have access to I guess is what you want
2012-03-30T09:38:00.000Z	research4oscar	sacarlson	i want to add a couple of users to my new ubuntu setup with access only to a folder under var/www
2012-03-30T09:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	can't you just add those users to the group www-data ?
2012-03-30T09:38:00.000Z	research4oscar	sacarlson	so that they can upload html files.
2012-03-30T09:39:00.000Z	research4oscar	sacarlson	yup tried that.
2012-03-30T09:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	and the results being ?  maybe you also have permisions on the dir /var/www set to what?
2012-03-30T09:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	research4oscar	sudo ls -l -d /var/www
