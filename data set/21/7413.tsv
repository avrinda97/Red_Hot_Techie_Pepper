2007-03-02T13:26:00.000Z	SoftIce		so you saying using ubuntu on a server is a bad idea?
2007-03-02T13:26:00.000Z	SoftIce		as you forced to upgrade quite a bit
2007-03-02T13:27:00.000Z	SoftIce		yes, it is
2007-03-02T13:27:00.000Z	SoftIce		now thing is I have 6 servers running edgy
2007-03-02T13:27:00.000Z	SoftIce		I can't downgrade back to dapper
2007-03-02T13:27:00.000Z	SoftIce		so what would you sugest?
2007-03-02T13:28:00.000Z	SoftIce		how safe is an upgrade?
2007-03-02T13:28:00.000Z	SoftIce		I need 100% garantees :)
2007-03-02T13:29:00.000Z	SoftIce		i'm using some backports
2007-03-02T13:29:00.000Z	MM2	SoftIce	I have tried to upgrade many times, and all times failed :/

2007-03-02T13:30:00.000Z	SoftIce		i'm going to have to try stage the upgrade them
2007-03-02T13:30:00.000Z	SoftIce		I can't just try if it breaks
2007-03-02T13:30:00.000Z	SoftIce		im ******
2007-03-02T13:30:00.000Z	SoftIce		as I will schedule downtime, but it can't be to long
2007-03-02T13:31:00.000Z	MM2	SoftIce	if it is a server, then try upgrading backupserver first?
2007-03-02T13:32:00.000Z	MM2	SoftIce	and if it works, then do not try to fix it! :)
