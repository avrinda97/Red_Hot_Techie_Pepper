2008-05-31T00:50:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		Does anyone know how Linux software writers write applications that will detect other 'trial versions' of their software having been ran before on Ubuntu? I have an app that even if I download fresh and place in a seperate file, the trial period remains the same as the earlier downloaded instance. Without a registry (like Windows), how does it know?
2008-05-31T00:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	there may be a hidden file in your homedir
2008-05-31T00:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	if you do "ls -al | less" then you can see all the files including hidden ones
2008-05-31T00:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	what is the app anyway?
2008-05-31T00:51:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	gordonjcp	LightZone by LightCrafts (www.lightcrafts.com)
2008-05-31T00:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	what's that, just something for fiddling with brightness and contrast?
2008-05-31T00:53:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	gordonjcp	it's a raw photo processing tool for photographers
2008-05-31T00:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	hm, it handles .raw files?
2008-05-31T00:53:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	gordonjcp	yes - very much so

2008-05-31T00:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	I tend to use command-line tools when I'm dealing with .raw images
2008-05-31T00:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	but then I'm usually dealing with a few thousand at a time ;-)
2008-05-31T00:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	the company I work for shoots timelapse images with DSLRs and specially-made controllers
2008-05-31T00:56:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	gordonjcp	I have done before too - imagemagick especially. But LightZone has batch processing options. It's better than the GIMP, Photoshop and all those others. Works in 16-bit too. But I take your point - LightZone is not designed for those who take thousands of shots in a shoot - I doubt in your case if you have timelapse stuff to deal with it would not be suitable I don't think

2008-05-31T00:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	that's a building site, but it's going to be a museum.  We're shooting it at 6Mpix, every two minutes, for the next three years
2008-05-31T00:57:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	gordonjcp	good grief!! Imagemagick for you then!!
2008-05-31T00:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	the pic shown there on the page is done with imagemagick, scaled, cropped and then the overlays dropped in
2008-05-31T00:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	9pm now, so that's the camera gone to bed for the night
2008-05-31T01:00:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	gordonjcp	fair play mate!!
2008-05-31T01:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gizmo_The_Great	I want to run one for a full 24 hours, to catch the dawn (sun rises just behind the tower in the middle), and the sunset
