2011-08-30T16:08:00.000Z	kristjan		Hello! Where are panel .desktop files located?
2011-08-30T16:10:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 look in /usr/share/applications
2011-08-30T16:12:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 what is  swat4?
2011-08-30T16:13:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 ah
2011-08-30T16:14:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 then look under .wine in the home directory
2011-08-30T16:16:00.000Z	kristjan	coz_	there's nothing
2011-08-30T16:17:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 you could try to look under gconf-editer   /aps/panel/   see if anything is under there,, although I doubt it
2011-08-30T16:18:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 whcih version of ubuntu on you running there?
2011-08-30T16:18:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 open a terminal and type  gconf-editor
2011-08-30T16:19:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 well as I said  maneauver to   /apps/panel   see if anything is under there, but I doubt it
2011-08-30T16:20:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 I am surprised there is a panel icon for the game after installing into wine  but I know little about games/wine
2011-08-30T16:22:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 ah I see.. not sure then,,, apparenlty the panel icon you  made is not seeing the executable under wine
2011-08-30T16:22:00.000Z	kristjan	coz_	how to fix that?
2011-08-30T16:23:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 to be honest I have little experience with wine,, however,, let me check around , hold on
2011-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 hey guy,, did you fix that issue?
2011-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 you may have to  be sure ,, for that sortcut that it is pointing to wine and the executable for example   wine “/home/username/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS2/Photoshop.exe”
2011-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 you put wine at the beginning I believe,, at least it makes sense here
2011-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	  as I said  you probably have to  make the command on that shortcut look similar to t his
2011-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	    wine “/home/username/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS2/Photoshop.exe”
2011-08-30T16:52:00.000Z	kristjan	coz_	i still get same error...
2011-08-30T16:52:00.000Z	coz_	kristjan	 then #winehq  should have the resources to fix the issue, if they dont I would be surprised and disappointed
