2005-08-07T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego		!wma is <reply> Ask me about RestrictedFormats
2005-08-07T05:54:00.000Z	cafuego		!2**32 - 1
2005-08-07T05:55:00.000Z	cafuego		Tuesday 19 January, 2038 14:14:07 is the maximum 32bit time.
2005-08-07T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego		Much like NOBODY used bad year+1900 code in 2000 ;-)
2005-08-07T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego		So it was never 19100 instead
2005-08-07T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego		!2**64
2005-08-07T05:57:00.000Z	cafuego		<heh>
2005-08-07T05:58:00.000Z	cafuego		Bloody hell, read the /topic
2005-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego		Anyone with amd64 here?
2005-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	persia	cafuego	I'll test something...
2005-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	persia	cafuego	I've put together a short program, but I need pointers to the includes - it's been far too long since I wrote C.
2005-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego	persia	#include <stdlib.h> for instance?
2005-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	persia	cafuego	that takes care of time_t, but INT_MAX is still undefined.
2005-08-07T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	persia	limits.h
2005-08-07T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	persia	HOWEVER, INT_MAX appears to be 32bit on my amd64 box.
2005-08-07T06:09:00.000Z	persia	cafuego	if you have 32-bit INT_MAX, I probably do as well.  Just in case, ..
2006-01-14T11:26:00.000Z	persia	cafuego	What's wrong with j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin for 64bit?
2006-01-14T11:26:00.000Z	cafuego	persia	Doesn't work with the tax office here
2006-01-14T11:27:00.000Z	persia	cafuego	Thanks.  It worked for my limited use, but I'll not advise it for everything.
2006-01-14T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego	persia	Well, ppl can also find out for themselves :-)
