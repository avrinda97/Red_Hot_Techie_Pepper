2011-05-17T01:42:00.000Z	lalochez1a		hi. how can i disable unity from the terminal?
2011-05-17T01:42:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	sudo service gdm stop?
2011-05-17T01:44:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	actually i want to disable gdm from entering unity and use classic gnome instead
2011-05-17T01:45:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	choose "classic gnome" at gdm login then
2011-05-17T01:46:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	yea, but i have access to terminal only. gdm dies...
2011-05-17T01:49:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	yes, unfortunately
2011-05-17T01:50:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	sudo gedit /etc/gdm/custom.conf
2011-05-17T01:50:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	change AutomaticLoginEnable to false

2011-05-17T01:51:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	thx! will try that
2011-05-17T01:54:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	i don't have that file :(
2011-05-17T01:57:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	hmm. exists for me. you running natty?
2011-05-17T01:57:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	ls -l /etc/gdm
2011-05-17T02:06:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	yea, natty. i don't have that file :(
2011-05-17T02:07:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	ls -l /etc/gdm

2011-05-17T02:10:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	then again, my custom.conf might be depreciated
2011-05-17T02:11:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	still exists, but doesnt affect anything
2011-05-17T02:11:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	i'm just trying to find out how natty goes about storing this setting
2011-05-17T02:13:00.000Z	lalochez1a	mervaka	thx for you effort. the prob is that i don't have any access now, am coaching a person via phone. i am not that new to linux, but used to debian servers (though i startted using natty at work)
2011-05-17T02:14:00.000Z	mervaka	lalochez1a	no worries. i need to head off now anyway, sorry.
