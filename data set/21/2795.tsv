2009-06-16T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	what is the output of:   lsb_release -c
2009-06-16T00:47:00.000Z	alfonsok	ActionParsnip	ok let me check thanks
2009-06-16T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	ok thats god, making sure you weren't on karmic
2009-06-16T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	are you fully updated?
2009-06-16T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	is your system fairly new?
2009-06-16T00:48:00.000Z	alfonsok	ActionParsnip	ok.. dont you think this is weird? maybe is because  ubuntu is extremely fast now and with my high end hardware (new macbook pro, 2.8ghz, 4gb ddr3..) its acting weird?
2009-06-16T00:48:00.000Z	alfonsok	ActionParsnip	very new
2009-06-16T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	theres better than that but its not slow enough to cause typing weirdness
2009-06-16T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	maybe its a mac thing?
2009-06-16T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	i've never installed on a mac as i only buy proper pcs
2009-06-16T00:50:00.000Z	alfonsok	ActionParsnip	i dont see how would be mac thing.. maybe i should use ext3 not 4?
2009-06-16T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	i dont think thats the issue as the app you are typing is in ram
2009-06-16T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	i am unsure of the state of ext4 presently
2009-06-16T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	maybe the keyboard needs extra options in spme form
2009-06-16T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	i'd look around for guides of people installing ubuntu on mac
2009-06-16T00:53:00.000Z	alfonsok	ActionParsnip	it was my macbook keyboard..  bluetooth recognize my apple wireless keyboard i was surprised.. and now everything is fluid..
2009-06-16T00:54:00.000Z	alfonsok	ActionParsnip	but still is annoying that i can't set my keyboard to work properly, is not like i will be using my wireless keyboard all the time
2009-06-16T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	its mac hardware which is primarily designed for Mac OS. Why not just buy a windows based pc to put linux on and save yourself half the price of apples hardware
2009-06-16T00:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alfonsok	theres this which may help some: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro4-1/Jaunty
