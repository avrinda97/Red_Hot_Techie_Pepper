2007-01-10T11:38:00.000Z	jughead		hello, I use ubuntu and I installed KDE using "sudo aptitude install KDE"  I selected gdm as my login manager.  When I try to start a KDE session I get an error telling me to make sure the dcopserver program is running.  what is that/
2007-01-10T11:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	Is the kdebase-bin package installed?
2007-01-10T11:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	In answer to your "what is it" question, dcop is a communication protocol which allows KDE applications to talk to one another. Or you to talk to them.
2007-01-10T11:41:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	kdebase-bin package is installed
2007-01-10T11:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	Does KDE let you log in? Or does it kick you out?
2007-01-10T11:43:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	it kicks me out.  the error appears right after the splash screen appears.  when I click "ok" it goes back to gdm
2007-01-10T11:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	Do you know about the virtual terminals?
2007-01-10T11:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	I'm assuming you also have and want to use gnome on this system?
2007-01-10T11:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	run the "dcopserver" command in gnome\fluxbox\whatever. See what it says.
2007-01-10T11:48:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	there was no terminal output
2007-01-10T11:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	That may be either good or bad. Try starting kde now.
2007-01-10T11:48:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	ok brb'
2007-01-10T11:51:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	it did not work.  the error says "could not read network connection list. /home/matthew/.DCOPserver_matthew-laptop__0"
2007-01-10T11:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	And there's nothing weird about your home dir?
2007-01-10T11:53:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	there is no file by that name in my home dir
2007-01-10T11:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	You could temporarily try kdm and see if it works. But I don't know what's wrong; everything you described sounds fine. Don't see why that file is missing.
2007-01-10T11:56:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	I need to add something to my path.  do you know how to do that?
2007-01-10T11:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	If your question is "what do I need to add to my PATH", I have no idea. If your question is, "I need to add /usr/foo/bar to my PATH," I can.
2007-01-10T11:58:00.000Z	jughead	arrenlex	yes, someone with a similar problem added /etc/X11R6/bin to their path and it worked
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	Problem is, I'm not sure whether that needs to be added to root path or to user path.
2007-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	jughead	Try user's path first, I suppose... add this to ~/.bashrc: export PATH=$PATH:/etc/X11R6/bin
