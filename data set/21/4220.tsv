2010-10-22T06:10:00.000Z	_Sketch_		Hello! I just did an upgrade to 10.10 through the update-manager, and now I don't have any working X/Gnome setup. After the first Ubuntu loading screen, it dumps me back to the terminals, where the startup seems to be hanging after 'Checking battery state'. Anyone else get this?
2010-10-22T06:12:00.000Z	_Sketch_		Ah. I'll hunt in aptitude for a minute. Maybe I can resolve this myself. :)
2010-10-22T06:14:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	I would boot to recovery mode and make sure that all packages are installed and configured.
2010-10-22T06:16:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	Will try.
2010-10-22T06:17:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	yeah make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed and use dpkg to reconfigure everything
2010-10-22T06:20:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	Appears to be! dpkg didn't do anything. Although booting into recovery mode nets me a higher resolution text display. Heh. lspci says I have an Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller.
2010-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	is ubuntu-desktop installed?
2010-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-10-22T06:22:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	and sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
2010-10-22T06:22:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	ubuntu-desktop is indeed installed. Running those now.
2010-10-22T06:24:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	Nothing happened with the apt-get 0 updates, etc. Running dpkg.
2010-10-22T06:33:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	After going through reconfiguring console-setup in dpkg-reconfigure -a, I get this: dpkg-maintscript-helper: error: couldn't identify the package
2010-10-22T06:33:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	which package?
2010-10-22T06:34:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	Sadly, it doesn't say. :/
2010-10-22T06:34:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	Is this an upgraded system or fresh install?
2010-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	Upgraded system. Although given I backed up, and have my /home on a different partition, fresh install is looking like a great option. :)
2010-10-22T06:37:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	that's why a seperate home is a beautiful thing. Saves time instead of troubleshooting god knows what went wrong during the upgrade
2010-10-22T06:37:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	I figured it would be a good idea this time around. I'm curious what went wrong, all the same, but...not -that- curious.
2010-10-22T06:40:00.000Z	_Sketch_	histo	Thanks for the help. :)
2010-10-22T06:40:00.000Z	histo	_Sketch_	np
