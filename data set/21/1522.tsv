2010-09-27T17:08:00.000Z	Zvezda		I am using Xubuntu 10.4, how can I make a certain program load automatically on start up?
2010-09-27T17:09:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	Settings -> Session and Startup -> Application Autostart -> Add
2010-09-27T17:09:00.000Z	rww		(I'm not using Lucid's Xfce, names may be slightly different)
2010-09-27T17:10:00.000Z	Zvezda	rww	- its not listed in the list, but there is a button where I can click ADD (to add the program)  how do I add it?
2010-09-27T17:11:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	Press Add and then type in a name and description, and then the command...
2010-09-27T17:11:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	if you can't see the Add button, try resizing the window. It was cut off at the bottom for me at first.
2010-09-27T17:11:00.000Z	Zvezda	rww	- what is command?
2010-09-27T17:11:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	whatever it is you want to run...
2010-09-27T17:42:00.000Z	Zvezda		zww - the program is called TeamViewer, how do I add it in command?
2010-09-27T17:45:00.000Z	Zvezda		Anyone - I am trying to autostart a program, but it says I need to add command.  what is command?
2010-09-27T17:45:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	which program are you trying to start?
2010-09-27T17:45:00.000Z	Zvezda		TeamViewer
2010-09-27T17:45:00.000Z	Zvezda		zww - TeamViewer, its a remote access program
2010-09-27T17:46:00.000Z	Zvezda		zww - I downloaded it
2010-09-27T17:46:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	how do you run it? is there an icon in your menu or do you have a command for it?
2010-09-27T17:47:00.000Z	Zvezda		I press APPLICATIONS, Networking, its "TeamViewer" in there
2010-09-27T17:48:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	I think Xubuntu comes with a menu editor, you could use that to find the command that Applications > Network > TeamViewer runs.
2010-09-27T17:48:00.000Z	rww		As I said, I don't have Lucid Xfce installed, so...
2010-09-27T17:48:00.000Z	rww		if you haven't tried already, #xubuntu would know better.
2010-09-27T17:48:00.000Z	Zvezda	rww	- how do I do that?
2010-09-27T17:49:00.000Z	rww	Zvezda	ask in #xubuntu, I don't remember how to run Xubuntu's menu editor
