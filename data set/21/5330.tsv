2007-11-04T22:30:00.000Z	Samjiman		yes, you can dual boot
2007-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	Samjiman		Is anything regarding graphics card changed in Gutsy. Because Feisty works fine. But when I boot Gutsy the screen goes blank
2007-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	Samjiman		I can install Gutsy fine
2007-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	Samjiman		but can't boot from hard drive
2007-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	Samjiman		unlike Feisty
2007-11-04T22:33:00.000Z	larson9999	Samjiman	i had two issues with gutsy.  1. i couldn't get me card installed without using envy.  2. i had to uninstall e*m or whatever that is that's new to gutsy.
2007-11-04T22:33:00.000Z	Samjiman		i see
2007-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	Samjiman		so there is a difference
2007-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	Samjiman		suspected as much
2007-11-04T22:35:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	Gutsy won't even boot for me. But Feisty worked
2007-11-04T22:35:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	I can boot up the live cd and install fine
2007-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	larson9999	Samjiman	yeah, in gutsy on that machine i had to boot from an old kernel and then uninstall that app then it would boot
2007-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	Aha, what app do i have to uninstall?
2007-11-04T22:36:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	maybe I can do it thru the recovery mode?
2007-11-04T22:38:00.000Z	larson9999	Samjiman	assuming you have the same problem, i had to go to an older kernel.  do you get lines of error messages that don't stop?
2007-11-04T22:39:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	I just get blank screen when I try to boot
2007-11-04T22:40:00.000Z	larson9999	Samjiman	try with nosplash.  check the forums.  they helped me with both of my issues upgrading
2007-11-04T22:40:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	thanks, what did you call your topic? So i can search?
2007-11-04T22:41:00.000Z	Samjiman		ASF is a container for a playlist I believe
2007-11-04T22:41:00.000Z	larson9999	Samjiman	i turned nosplash on and there was an error message. i used that.  but you can try gutsy black screen.
2007-11-04T22:42:00.000Z	Samjiman	larson9999	Okay, I can set to boot nosplash after install in GRUB
