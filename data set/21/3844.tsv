2010-09-24T14:34:00.000Z	th_		how i can manually disable a gnome applet?
2010-09-24T14:35:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	right click on that -> Remove from panel
2010-09-24T14:35:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	it doesnt start. gives an error :(
2010-09-24T14:37:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	um.. so you have an applet set to run with gnome panel, but it error at startup and didn't show at all, hence can't right click?
2010-09-24T14:37:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	exactly
2010-09-24T14:39:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	afaik, the only way to remove it is to use "gconf-editor"  navigate to  apps/panel/applets . click on each and view its bonobo_lid name to determine which applet is the one you want to remove,  then   "rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/panel/applets/<that_applet_id>"
2010-09-24T14:40:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	thanks. that seems to be what i wanted. brb
2010-09-24T14:44:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	do you think this is it?: fast_user_switch_screen0/
2010-09-24T14:44:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	lol i don't know what is the applet with problem on YOUR system
2010-09-24T14:45:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	oh sorry thought i told that
2010-09-24T14:46:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	or simply  "mv ~/.gconf/apps/panel   ~/panel-gconf"
2010-09-24T14:46:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	then restart gnome-panel
2010-09-24T14:47:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	i would think configure panel from scratch would be easier to fix
2010-09-24T14:47:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	hmm i dont see how that works?
2010-09-24T14:48:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	and it didnt work. how i can reset the whole panel?
2010-09-24T14:49:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	remove  ~/.gconf/apps/panel   and then restart gnome-panel   "killall gnome-panel"
2010-09-24T14:49:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	um maybe killall -9 gnome-panel
2010-09-24T14:50:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	don't know if gnome-panel would try to write current config at program termination
2010-09-24T14:50:00.000Z	th_	icarus-c	wtf? i know how to kill a program
2010-09-24T14:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	try logout/in
2010-09-24T14:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	th_	yea you have to logout/in to make it take effect.
