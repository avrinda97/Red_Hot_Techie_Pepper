2006-04-20T10:51:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob|Scott		Q: How do I know if I have Wine now?
2006-04-20T10:51:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob|Scott		XP puts it in your prog list...
2006-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	it's there, when you try to run an exe, it will run it through wine
2006-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob|Scott	slavik	automatically?
2006-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	I would recommend going through the terminal for any errors though
2006-04-20T10:53:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	in terminal "wine path/to/exe/program.exe
2006-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	GUI is easier to figure out than a terminal
2006-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	get rid of wine, NOW!!!
2006-04-20T11:03:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	usually not
2006-04-20T11:06:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	evolution
2006-04-20T11:08:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	"sudo mount /mnt/cdrom0"
2006-04-20T11:10:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob|Scott	slavik	mount: can't find /mnt/cdrom0 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2006-04-20T13:41:00.000Z	slavik	UbuntuNoob|Scott	did you add the wine repo?
