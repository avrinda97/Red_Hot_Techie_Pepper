2005-11-01T14:05:00.000Z	Nick_Roberts		Hmmm.... I followed the advice that person gave me
2005-11-01T14:06:00.000Z	Nick_Roberts		Went to that guide.
2005-11-01T14:06:00.000Z	Nick_Roberts		Did what the guide said
2005-11-01T14:06:00.000Z	Nick_Roberts		And now I have an error
2005-11-01T14:06:00.000Z	Nick_Roberts		"failed to start the x server (your graphical interface). It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?"

2005-11-01T14:08:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 say yes
2005-11-01T14:12:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 quit out then, and type startx, whats the error? (dont paste it here)
2005-11-01T14:14:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 you can paste one line if a onle line error, otherwise paste it to a pastebin
2005-11-01T14:18:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 it can, you dont know how to set it up thats all.
2005-11-01T14:18:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 not having a go, but its not always easy, thats all.
2005-11-01T14:20:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 if you can get onto the internet without X, you can irc in console and get help and try it out while you type... can you do that?
2005-11-01T14:21:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 ok, 2 macines ;) cool
2005-11-01T14:22:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 does it give a specific error when you type startx ?
2005-11-01T14:22:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 the (EE) ones are the important ones
2005-11-01T14:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 do this.... sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-11-01T14:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 then edit the line saying "nvidia", change it to just "nv"
2005-11-01T14:24:00.000Z	Nick_Roberts	aftertaf	I think theres a problem there
2005-11-01T14:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 what do you mean? did you try chaging xorg?
2005-11-01T14:32:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 ok, changed it. now try startx again
2005-11-01T14:37:00.000Z	aftertaf	Nick_Roberts	 not NV, nv !!!!
