2004-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	gloin_		I do want to figure out how to get past the falsely-broken dependency on this
2004-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	gloin_		lol
2004-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	gloin_		well
2004-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	gloin_		I have transcode
2004-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	gloin_		so
2004-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	gloin_		I just need to find the textfile that stores the wrong info for the dvdrip package
2004-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	gloin_		and I'm willing to try a force-install
2004-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	gloin_		but don't know how
2004-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	gloin_		so
2004-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	gloin_		where are the info files on packages stored?
2004-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	linux_galore	gloin_	apt keeps its own database
2004-12-16T07:55:00.000Z	gloin_	linux_galore	that's gotta be a typo
2004-12-16T07:55:00.000Z	gloin_		in the apt config file
2004-12-16T07:55:00.000Z	gloin_		lol
2004-12-16T07:55:00.000Z	linux_galore	gloin_	sorry
2004-12-16T07:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	gloin_	mind wandering
2004-12-16T07:56:00.000Z	gloin_		what I'm seeing is that it wants transcode "2:0.6.6" but transcode version I have is 0.6.12
2004-12-16T07:56:00.000Z	gloin_		so someone screwed up an apt file
2004-12-16T07:56:00.000Z	gloin_		so
2004-12-16T07:57:00.000Z	gloin_		once again
2004-12-16T07:57:00.000Z	linux_galore	gloin_	I spend all week dealing with rpm based installs then I get home and play with Ubuntu
