2007-09-04T15:25:00.000Z	ward_		a friend has a p1 clocked at 150Mhz, with 96MB ram and he wants to make it into a server, now i saw ubuntu-server is the same installcd as ubuntu desktop?
2007-09-04T15:26:00.000Z	ward_		is his comp gonan be able to use that CD (since xubuntu has a special version for machines with less then 192MB ram)
2007-09-04T15:27:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	id recommend debian but ubuntuserver should work. he will also be able to install xfonts base xserver-xorg and fluxbox if he wants some gui itll work on that box ok
2007-09-04T15:28:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	is debian lighter?
2007-09-04T15:29:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	it seems that way but really maybe not. debian just is more intuitive on a server install but ive done both either is fine
2007-09-04T15:29:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	then he's probably gonna go with the alternate cd
2007-09-04T15:30:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	PriceChild would xserver run a bit on that odl thing?
2007-09-04T15:30:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	one good thing is more community support in ubuntu so that may be best
2007-09-04T15:31:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	yeah. ive had xserver on a p133 with blackbox running on 8mb ram
2007-09-04T15:31:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	tell him not to use the metapackages
2007-09-04T15:32:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	what is blackbox? by metapackages you mean install trough apt-get?
2007-09-04T15:33:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	a metapackage is just basically a dummy package used to pull in alot of stuff so like ubuntu-desktop package gives you all the gnome plus office  etc
2007-09-04T15:33:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	blackbox is a window manager very light weight. id recommend he use fluxbox though
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	he'll start out without x, then isntall x seperately, can u tlell me the best way to install x when the CLI version of ubuntu is installed?
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	and fluxbox is jsut "sudo apt-get fluxbox" ?
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	basically you need 2 packages the xfonts-base  <-- im not sure of exact name as im on debian server atm and xserver-xorg
2007-09-04T15:35:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	maek ok thanx :-)
2007-09-04T15:35:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	yeah. then i normally do a echo 'exec fluxbox' > ~/.xinitrc    and then type xinit to run it.
2007-09-04T15:35:00.000Z	dyrne	ward_	np
2007-09-04T15:44:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	i've explained him, i'll let you know if it worked when he tried it
2007-09-05T10:54:00.000Z	ward_	dyrne	remember me? (i asked advice yesterday for my friends P1 150Mhz)
