2007-07-19T14:05:00.000Z	hexstar	allan789	install a nic, connect it to a hub or router
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	hexstar		you can also use a crossover cable to connect them directly using two nics
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	allan789		i have router and hub
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	hexstar		but then you have to manually assign ips
2007-07-19T14:07:00.000Z	hexstar	allan789	ok use router, take modem with cable and put in wan port, put others in other ports...and you're done
2007-07-19T14:07:00.000Z	hexstar		no need for a hub
