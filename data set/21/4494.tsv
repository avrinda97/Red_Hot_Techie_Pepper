2009-09-07T08:56:00.000Z	binarycortex		no usb drive
2009-09-07T08:58:00.000Z	binarycortex		is there anyway to run wubi from within the live cd?
2009-09-07T08:59:00.000Z	binarycortex		perhaps
2009-09-07T08:59:00.000Z	binarycortex		but that would change the boot sector anyway
2009-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	binarycortex		i used to be windows tech support
2009-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	binarycortex		this is fixable
2009-09-07T09:01:00.000Z	binarycortex		i can fix it without linux but not without a cd burned
2009-09-07T09:01:00.000Z	binarycortex		which i cant do without linux
2009-09-07T09:01:00.000Z	binarycortex		:D
2009-09-07T09:02:00.000Z	binarycortex		i wish i could run wubi from here
2009-09-07T09:03:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	There is a website called pen drive linux which walks you through creating linux bootable usb flash drives.
2009-09-07T09:03:00.000Z	binarycortex	dsnyders	need a usb stick for that
2009-09-07T09:04:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	Yes, you would.  What are you trying to accomplish
2009-09-07T09:05:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	do you have a floppy drive?
2009-09-07T09:06:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	Yikes, no boot possibilities other than CD and corrupted disk.  Right?
2009-09-07T09:07:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	any free space on the hard drive?
2009-09-07T09:08:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	you could install linux onto that as a dual boot
2009-09-07T09:09:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	do you know if it is corrupted, or is that a guess?
2009-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	how far along in the boot process?
2009-09-07T09:12:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	I'm sure you're well past the boot sector at that point.  Setting up a dual boot should work.
2009-09-07T09:16:00.000Z	dsnyders	binarycortex	I wouldn't know how to do that, although it may be possible.
