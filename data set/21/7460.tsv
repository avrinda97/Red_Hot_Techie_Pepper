2007-05-29T11:10:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	yes. but: you might not have enough ram for all bells and whistles likde gnome/kde
2007-05-29T11:11:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	kde is something similar. you should have at least 256MB, better 512MB for them
2007-05-29T11:11:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	ubuntu uses gnome, kubuntu uses kde
2007-05-29T11:12:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	intall ubuntu server without X. if you can handle a console irc client
2007-05-29T11:13:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	xfce
2007-05-29T11:13:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	so how much memory do you have?
2007-05-29T11:13:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	tight. either use xubuntu or no X
2007-05-29T11:13:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	irssi is a very good irc client for console
2007-05-29T11:15:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	yes. linux is a lot more flexible than windows. a LOT
2007-05-29T11:15:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	you don't need a GUI if you don't want to for example
2007-05-29T11:16:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	yes
2007-05-29T11:17:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	i810 uses SDRAM PC133 yes
2007-05-29T11:18:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	erm, start with Xubuntu
2007-05-29T11:23:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	serial
2007-05-29T11:23:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	9pin
2007-05-29T11:26:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	first, try out xubuntu. you might be happy with it and then the additional ram wouldn't be needed
2007-05-29T11:33:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	it will eat memory with wine that's for sure...
2007-05-29T11:39:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	yes
2007-05-29T11:47:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	Read The Fine Manual
2007-05-29T12:03:00.000Z	wols_	reevester	yes. you can even install gnome later if you want
