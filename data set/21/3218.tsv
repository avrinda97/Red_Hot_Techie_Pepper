2010-04-02T01:25:00.000Z	nicetry		hey guys, using apt-get can you upgrade one specific package? or should you use install? I'm trying to upgrade from php5-5.2.10 to php5-5.2.13
2010-04-02T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	if there is a package for it in the repos sure
2010-04-02T01:25:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	I had to add Dotdeb.org to the repos but I'm not an avid ubuntu user so I'm a bit unsure how to upgrade one package
2010-04-02T01:26:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	I would not use 3rd party reos to update core components like php
2010-04-02T01:26:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	what is in php 2.13 that's not in 2.10 that you want ?
2010-04-02T01:26:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	some bug fixes that are needed for CMS Made Simple 1.7
2010-04-02T01:27:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	which ones ?
2010-04-02T01:27:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	good question, I'm not sure but I asked in #cmsms and they recomend upgrading from dotdeb.org to 2.13
2010-04-02T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	did they tell you that  a 3rd party repo may break your whole ubuntu web server stack ?
2010-04-02T01:28:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	sorry I ment #cms. anyway would the line look like this?  would it just be apt-get update -s php5-5.2.13
2010-04-02T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	you can do that if you wish, just be aware we can't support your box after this
2010-04-02T01:29:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	they didn't though the recomendation came from people who had tried it, and the latest relase of cmsms says that 2.12+ is much more preferable to 2.10
2010-04-02T01:30:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	so they should be able to support your web stack from this point on then
2010-04-02T01:30:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	how do you mean?
2010-04-02T01:30:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	you're moving your web stack away form ubuntu supported, so they will now have to support it
2010-04-02T01:31:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	this is what I'm looking at http://www.dotdeb.org/2010/01/11/php-5-2-12-packages-are-here/  I guess they fixed more than 60 bugs in .2.12
2010-04-02T01:31:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	that doesn't change anything, your webstack will no longer be supported by ubuntu
2010-04-02T01:33:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	true, if I do that I wouldn't be under your support, but to go back to my orignal question - you can specify a specific package and version with apt-get upgrade?
2010-04-02T01:33:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	your out of support - ask the guys who now support you
2010-04-02T01:34:00.000Z	nicetry	ikonia	hey no need to put me in a box, I haven't made any non standard changes to my system yet, I'm asking about apt-get because the man page is ambiguous.
2010-04-02T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	nicetry	apt-get update $package-name
