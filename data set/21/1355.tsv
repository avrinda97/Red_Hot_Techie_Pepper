2011-01-23T05:52:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	you very likely did not upgrade to 11.04   if you went to system/about... .the "about" for ubuntu 11.04, bot accidentally pulled into ubuntu 10.10 a while ago... do what yeats is telling you to confirm your ubuntu version
2011-01-23T05:53:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	right you are.  Thanks!
2011-01-23T05:53:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	don't flood... thats because the "about" on 10.10 got accidentally screwed up a while ago.. it's not a critical issue.
2011-01-23T05:54:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	oops, sorry, will not to that.
2011-01-23T05:54:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	now, we know you're using 10.10... what was the other issue?
2011-01-23T05:55:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	my montior looks horrible now.  Take a look a the screen shot to see what I'm seeing.  Text renders fine, but there's this very odd pixel stuff by the mouse error, and in the icons.
2011-01-23T05:56:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	i didn't see a screenshot.
2011-01-23T05:56:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	hmmm let me check the  link aain.
2011-01-23T05:57:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	Screenshot is here: http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/5405758/1/ubuntu-problem?h=984adc, look at the icons and stuff, whic look corrupted..
2011-01-23T05:58:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	ugh... i'm not sure on that one... never saw a problem like that... have you tried changing themes?
2011-01-23T06:53:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	ran into this issue yesterday w/ someone else, and couldn't figure it out.. .nvidia card do you have?
2011-01-23T06:55:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	how do I determine the card type?  this is a Dell Latitude.
2011-01-23T06:55:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	lspci | grep Video  in a terminal should tell you the basics
2011-01-23T06:57:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	 Driver is VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV28 [GeForce4 Ti 4200 Go AGP 8x] (rev a1)
2011-01-23T06:58:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	you said you're in the safe mode GUI now, right?
2011-01-23T06:58:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	right
2011-01-23T06:58:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	do you have anything in system/admin/additional drivers?
2011-01-23T06:59:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	looks like my Nvidia driver is currently activated and in use.
2011-01-23T06:59:00.000Z	TomV-415	KM0201	I'm wondering if there is a log or something I can see regarding the failed normal boot (so I don't have to boot into recovery mode.)
2011-01-23T07:00:00.000Z	KM0201	TomV-415	i would uninstall the nvidia-driver completely and see if that gets you back to a "regular" GUI
