2008-09-22T18:38:00.000Z	Rowellen		if I do <su root> it asks me for a password I insert it and I am root. What I have done now seeming that it doesnt work sudo ping www.google.com
2008-09-22T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rowellen	if you are root you dont have to sudo anything
2008-09-22T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rowellen	and you certainly dont have to sudo ping, users can ping
2008-09-22T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rowellen	can you ping 65.55.21.250
2008-09-22T18:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rowellen	what if you use ip instead of name?
