2009-02-22T10:03:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		is there a better stopwatch program for ubuntu than 'stopwatch'? :p
2009-02-22T10:03:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	you want a count down timer?
2009-02-22T10:04:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	that would be interesting too;  but i also would like it to count up.    i'd like really to time how long a given tasks takes
2009-02-22T10:04:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	also countdown would be interesting;  if you have suggestoins there
2009-02-22T10:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	ah. hang on and I'll find a reference for both
2009-02-22T10:05:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	you rock!
2009-02-22T10:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	one is "timer-appelate"
2009-02-22T10:07:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "timer-appelate"
2009-02-22T10:07:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	timer-applet perhaps ;p
2009-02-22T10:08:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	yes.. just misspelled
2009-02-22T10:10:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	sorry the other I cant seem to locate
2009-02-22T10:10:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	there is gtimer;  but its a bit raw in terms of UI
2009-02-22T10:10:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	no the other I'm trying to find allow you to set "to do's
2009-02-22T10:11:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	that would be cool
2009-02-22T10:11:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	to do's or chores that you time individually for billing purposes.. but can be used for personal use too..
2009-02-22T10:11:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	yes that would be rad
2009-02-22T10:11:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	can't remember the name or find it in synaptic
2009-02-22T10:12:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	 oh wells thanks for looking; if you rmeember, please let me know
2009-02-22T10:12:00.000Z	Izinucs		k
2009-02-22T10:13:00.000Z	Izinucs	arooni-mobile	actually you already had it.. gtimer.. looks basic but dive into it and see what it can do
2009-02-22T10:13:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Izinucs	yeah the UI is a  bit wonky; but it seems good enough
