2007-12-09T05:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	gratuitous highlight
2007-12-09T05:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	if I start a sentence with your name, it will highlight in your IRC window
2007-12-09T05:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	don't do that
2007-12-09T05:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	read what the bot just told you ;-)
2007-12-09T05:30:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	trying to, a little hard.
2007-12-09T05:30:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	the site says something else
2007-12-09T05:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	Ubuntu has a fairly specific way of installing the binary drivers
2007-12-09T05:31:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	does this mean, it's a complicated thing?
2007-12-09T05:35:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	I tried something else, I opened the Restricted Drivers window
2007-12-09T05:35:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	I see my driver is not enabled, when I enable it, it says: the sfotware soruce nvidia-glx-new is not enabled
2007-12-09T05:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	hm
2007-12-09T05:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	check the repos are enabled for it
2007-12-09T05:36:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	my laptop has two graphic cards, I think it's using the intel and that's why I can't enable the nvidia
2007-12-09T05:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	that would do it
2007-12-09T05:36:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	disabled it, not rebooting
2007-12-09T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	What exactly are you trying to do?
2007-12-09T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	disregard, mis-tab
2007-12-09T05:39:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	just wondering if it were possible to connect to a MS Remote Dekstop session
2007-12-09T05:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	probably, but I've never done it
2007-12-09T05:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Joachim_Joe	and I don't have anything with Windows to test it with
2007-12-09T05:40:00.000Z	Joachim_Joe	gordonjcp	it is possible.. there is a terminal server client
