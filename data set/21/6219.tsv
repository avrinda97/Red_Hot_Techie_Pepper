2009-02-24T14:48:00.000Z	dkg		How can I configure ubuntu to ignore my remote control as a keyboard when I use lirc, or not use lirc and have all the buttons mapped to some key using built in driver?
2009-02-24T14:48:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	i think you can configure lirc to do specific command on button
2009-02-24T14:50:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	I can get lirc working but the kernel still processes buttons pressed as keyboard keys too.  can I dissable that? /dev/input/event6?
2009-02-24T14:51:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	no idea. i just googled about that stuff few months ago when i had little project that didnt start
2009-02-24T14:51:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	I've exhausted my googling skills on the matter :(
2009-02-24T15:05:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	from linux-source
2009-02-24T15:05:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	is that the package name?
2009-02-24T15:06:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	maybe... basicly if you want to edit kernel drivers you need to compile new kernel
2009-02-24T15:06:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	that's not a problem, I NEED to get this working. thanks for the help. I'll have a little google around :)
2009-02-24T15:07:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	there is ubuntu way to do i. check compile kernel ubuntu way. and fetch latest kernel from kernel org
2009-02-24T15:07:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	will do. thanks again : )
2009-02-24T15:07:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	so problem is that lirc remote gives "keys" to X when you use it or what ?
2009-02-24T15:08:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	even without lirc, ir_common (I think) is sending keys, with lirc it gets them twice
2009-02-24T15:09:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	i could usually use my mad google skillz but im at work and only browser that i can use is ie6 on sloow xp computer
2009-02-24T15:10:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	I've been googling for days, found nothing of interest, only similar to this.. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/67399
2009-02-24T15:11:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	have you tested different kernel versions ?
2009-02-24T15:11:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	not yet.
2009-02-24T15:12:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	if its kernel bug then it usually get fixed in next release.
2009-02-24T15:12:00.000Z	dkg	simplexio	hope so.  take care.  I'll go search some more.
2009-02-24T15:13:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	my best quess is that if remote control uses /dev/ttyS0, it has settings wrong because it echoes all commands twice
2009-02-24T15:13:00.000Z	simplexio	dkg	and is there any change that you happen to be build live ubuntu + remote control + something enviroment ?
