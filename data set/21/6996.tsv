2006-12-20T16:52:00.000Z	Pixeleet		hey, does anyone here have a problem switching to terminal windows with edgy?
2006-12-20T16:53:00.000Z	Pixeleet		anyone?
2006-12-20T16:54:00.000Z	Pixeleet		can people here using tty1-4 with edgy?
2006-12-20T16:55:00.000Z	Pixeleet		console doesn't work for me with a clean install of edgy
2006-12-20T16:56:00.000Z	Pixeleet		i can't switch to any tty1-tty6
2006-12-20T16:56:00.000Z	Pixeleet		its a clean install of edgy
2006-12-20T16:56:00.000Z	Pixeleet		dapper worked fine
2006-12-20T16:56:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	does it just show a black screen when you try to switch?
2006-12-20T16:57:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	well the console doesn't care about the Xorg drivers so that shouldn't matter
2006-12-20T16:57:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	ah, ok
2006-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	ah, of course
2006-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	but it just shows a black screen, or does the video just die
2006-12-20T16:58:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	its not a black screen, just random colors all over the screen
2006-12-20T17:00:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	so any ideas?
2006-12-21T17:01:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	you can try logging in blindly then typing reset to see if that works
2006-12-21T17:01:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	reset would do what?
2006-12-21T17:02:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	it resets the terminal sometimes it might work
2006-12-21T17:05:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	i figured out the problem
2006-12-21T17:05:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	which was?
2006-12-21T17:05:00.000Z	kitche	Pixeleet	ah yeah didn't thinking of the framebuffer since I don't mess witht hat usually
2006-12-21T17:12:00.000Z	Pixeleet	kitche	i found an easier fix
