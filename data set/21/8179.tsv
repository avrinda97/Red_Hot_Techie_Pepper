2006-06-08T11:52:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	what kind of issues?
2006-06-08T11:53:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	Well I'm on mac right; and half the times I try to burn it using one of a variety or tries it has an error or doesnt work.. OR when I put it into Toast, it comes up as almost 1.5 gigs in size because it seems there's a folder IN the iso that is called ubuntu itself and 700 mb in size
2006-06-08T11:53:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	Basically; I can't get a damn CD of 6.06!
2006-06-08T11:53:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	ok, well i run ubuntu on my mac ... are you doing the same or are you on OS X?
2006-06-08T11:54:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS		Mada: Im trying to burn it for my windows (x86) tower.. but i'm trying to burn the CD itself on the mac for the PC
2006-06-08T11:54:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	ok, so you have the image on the hard drive of the mac?
2006-06-08T11:55:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	Yes. I downloaded the .iso, and it was mounted and appears as a drive in the finder.
2006-06-08T11:56:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	ok, open finder click on applications, double click on "utilities", then double click on "disk manager" and tell me when that opens up
2006-06-08T11:57:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS		Mada: Ok in DiskUtility on the left I see the ubuntu .iso and under it is the mounted drive version of the .iso
2006-06-08T11:57:00.000Z	mada		ok, click on the non-mounted icon of the iso
2006-06-08T11:58:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	^
2006-06-08T11:58:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	Ok. Clicked :P
2006-06-08T11:58:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	ok, then the little "burn
2006-06-08T11:58:00.000Z	mada		oops
2006-06-08T11:58:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	then the little "burn" icon at the top should light up just like in iTunes when you burn a cd
2006-06-08T11:59:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	It did, and I put in a CD now and i'm burning it
2006-06-08T11:59:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	:D Thank god. I was trying the burn folder and Toast and BurnX and just having so many damn problems
2006-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	sweet, it takes a little longer to burn .iso's with disk util because it tripple checks everything, but it is definitely the fail safe way of doing so :)
2006-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	mada	Sweet. Thanks :P
2006-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	mada	OMGLAZERS	no problem :)
