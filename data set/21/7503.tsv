2006-09-16T16:06:00.000Z	botxj		i have a question, can a USB flash drive that's formatted as FAT32 be read in Ubuntu?
2006-09-16T16:08:00.000Z	botxj		how do i get ubuntu to see my usb flash drive?
2006-09-16T16:09:00.000Z	botxj		ok, THX-1138, i'll try that
2006-09-16T16:10:00.000Z	botxj		sudo mount -a doesnt seem to work, my flash drive isnt coming on
2006-09-16T10:28:00.000Z	botxj		i have question, i installed a Synthesizer that uses jACK, but i dont know how to install jACK, and the Synthesizer needs it to run, what do i do?
2006-09-16T10:28:00.000Z	botxj		i think my ubuntu uses ALSA or something
2006-09-16T10:28:00.000Z	botxj		start jacks?
2006-09-16T10:29:00.000Z	botxj		what should i select in the package manager when installing jACK so that it will be seen?
2006-09-16T10:29:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	I believe the package's name is jackd
2006-09-16T10:30:00.000Z	botxj	micahcowan	yeah i installed it, but the server never runs
2006-09-16T10:31:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	RoseGarden's preferences tell me how, I think. I'm looking it up.
2006-09-16T10:31:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	I think jack is a CD ripper or somesuch.
2006-09-16T10:32:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	try jackstart -d alsa
2006-09-16T10:35:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	hm. Works for me. Type jackstart and look at the options for the '-d' option. Try oss, but that will prevent all other applications from using sound.
2006-09-16T10:36:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	you have an esd driver available? Use that then.
2006-09-16T10:39:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	I don't know. :(   ...I remember seeing that error, but not how I dealt with it.
2006-09-16T10:41:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	yeah, ignore that. mine says that too, even when it works. I think it needs to run as root to get special priveleges for that.
2006-09-19T15:44:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	sure. Linux has buffer exploits too...
2006-09-19T15:44:00.000Z	botxj	micahcowan	say whah!
2006-09-19T15:44:00.000Z	botxj	micahcowan	ah
2006-09-19T15:46:00.000Z	micahcowan	botxj	it asks ubotu to private msg you information about the topic named by !what
