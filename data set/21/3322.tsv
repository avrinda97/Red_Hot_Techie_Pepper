2009-05-03T16:18:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	fdisk allows you to manage your partition table, parted,mkfs allows you to format
2009-05-03T16:18:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	is there already a partition set up?
2009-05-03T16:19:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	what do you want to format it as?
2009-05-03T16:19:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
2009-05-03T16:19:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	where sdb1 is the partition you want to format
2009-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	n_nick	raylu	 my pendrive is in /media as disk.. so i tried mkfs.vfat /media/disk it didnt work ..
2009-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	no, /media/disk is the mount point of that partition
2009-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	if you type "mount", it will show you what device is mounted at that mountpoint
2009-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	you want to mkfs on that. it should be in /dev
2009-05-03T16:26:00.000Z	n_nick	raylu	hey thanks its done :) I also wanted some help with gparted installation when i do sudo apt-get .. i get an error no installation candidate
2009-05-03T16:27:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	i just installed it fine. perhaps you need to update? also, are you on 9.04, 8.10, ...?
2009-05-03T16:28:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	have you run apt-get/aptitude update recently?
2009-05-03T16:28:00.000Z	raylu	n_nick	well, do that :D
