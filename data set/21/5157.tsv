2009-05-02T21:11:00.000Z	jeffyeh		i'm trying to run a shell script at startup with "cd /home/jeff && ./script.sh" but it's not really working. any ideas?
2009-05-02T21:11:00.000Z	jeffyeh		or rather, at login, i suppose
2009-05-02T21:12:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	is the script not working, or is it not working upon login?
2009-05-02T21:12:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	script is working, i run the same command in terminal and it starts up
2009-05-02T21:12:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	do it just isn't running at login?
2009-05-02T21:13:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	'so', rather than 'do' :)
2009-05-02T21:13:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	correct
2009-05-02T21:13:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	do you want it to run when X starts, or when you log into a terminal/shell?
2009-05-02T21:14:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	when X starts, i'll give what anodesni said a try, brb
2009-05-02T21:16:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	to make a script run when X starts, ass yoru scripts to ~/.xprofile
2009-05-02T21:16:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	add, even.
2009-05-02T21:17:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	i don't have a .xprofile in my home folder, should i create one?
2009-05-02T21:17:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	yes
2009-05-02T21:17:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	so in the file, it should just have the path to my script, e.g. ~/script.sh
2009-05-02T21:17:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	yes
2009-05-02T21:35:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	sorry for the delay, but adding .xprofile ended up preventing me from logging in. any other ideas?
2009-05-02T21:36:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	yes. Once logged in, System -> preferences -> Startup Applications; click 'add', and enter your script's location
2009-05-02T21:37:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	you'll see three fields.  Name ("My Nifty Script"), Command: "~/myscript.sh"), and Command ("Does a nifty thing").
2009-05-02T21:37:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	alright, lemme try that
2009-05-02T21:38:00.000Z	jeffyeh	ghoti	thanks! that did the trick!
2009-05-02T21:38:00.000Z	ghoti	jeffyeh	\o/ glad to help!
