2012-08-01T22:47:00.000Z	akamikeym		hi there! cna anyone tell me what's going on when you see a usb as /dev/sdc rather than /dev/sdc1 or whatever?
2012-08-01T22:49:00.000Z	akamikeym		I would like to partition such a usb but I'm not sure how
2012-08-01T22:49:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	Thats not possible. What might causes that, is, that a fileesystem was created on the entire device instead on a partition.
2012-08-01T22:48:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	/dev/sdc is the USB device, and /dev/sdc1 is a partition on that device.
2012-08-01T22:48:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	that's what normally happens but sometimes a usb partition appears as /dev/sdc
2012-08-01T22:50:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	would I be safe in repartitioning it then, even though fdisk says it's not a valid partition table?
2012-08-01T22:50:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	Actually, it doesnt matter :)
2012-08-01T22:51:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	at the mo it's exactly as the factory sent ti.
2012-08-01T22:51:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	And whatsthe problem with it? :)
2012-08-01T22:52:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	awesome, I'll give it a shot. I was just worried that there was something deaper going on that I didn't understand.
2012-08-01T22:52:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	like the disk had some kind of hiden partition table
2012-08-01T22:52:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	There is no such hidden thing ;)
2012-08-01T22:53:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	gparted slightly freaked me out by refusing to put more than one partition on it.
2012-08-01T22:54:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	You could use fdisk as well.
2012-08-01T22:54:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	yes I will. I normally od but I want to copy and enlarge partitions from another usb stick that I have ubuntu installed on
2012-08-01T22:55:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	I'll setup the new partitions with fdsik then try gparted again to see if it will play
2012-08-01T22:56:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	Why dont you just create the partitions like you want them, and copy over the content of the other usb stick, instead messing with fdisk AND gparted?
2012-08-01T22:57:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	I'd like uuids to be preserved as well if possible
2012-08-01T22:57:00.000Z	bekks	akamikeym	You can set the UUIDs afterwards using tune2fs e.g.
2012-08-01T22:59:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	ok might give it a shot, what would th copy command be cp -Rp * ?
2012-08-01T23:28:00.000Z	akamikeym	bekks	Ok thanks, that appears to have worked, I just partitioned with fdisk after wiping the partition table with dd to be sure and copied the partitions across with gparted. Just off to test it, bye
