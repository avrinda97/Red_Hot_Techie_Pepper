2007-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	Simon_Malaysia		My name is Simon Yee
2007-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	Simon_Malaysia		I need some help to install the missing driver for the VIA display card
2007-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	Simon_Malaysia		Can ANy one help me please
2007-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	it's not missing, it's part of the default install.
2007-05-12T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and make sure via is selected as the driver
2007-05-12T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	later on, make sure that 640x480 is among the active resolutions.
2007-05-12T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	do not copy the quote marks
2007-05-12T06:15:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	just see if it works. You can configure it back to the vesa driver if it doesn't
2007-05-12T06:16:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	say yes, but change it to via if it doesn't set that automatically.
2007-05-12T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	and have some patience, please.
2007-05-12T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	select via then
2007-05-12T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	accept the defaults now, until you get to the resolutions.
2007-05-12T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	I asked you to have some patience.
2007-05-12T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	I won't reply to you any more now. I told you what to do already: just accept the defaults.
2007-05-12T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	have a look and see if you can figure it out for yourself.
2007-05-12T06:26:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	that's fine
2007-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	select "Easy"
2007-05-12T06:29:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	that's fine
2007-05-12T06:30:00.000Z	soundray	Simon_Malaysia	yes
