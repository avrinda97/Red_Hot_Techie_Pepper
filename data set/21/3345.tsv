2009-05-05T15:25:00.000Z	syockit		I'm still getting getting frequent lockups after converting to ext3. Can I have someone who recently clean installed Jaunty pastebin his/her /etc/fstab?
2009-05-05T15:26:00.000Z	syockit		I need to know the flags for mounting the drives (i.e. / , /boot, /home)
2009-05-05T15:26:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	try this --> http://paste.ubuntu.com/164827/
2009-05-05T15:26:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	thank you
2009-05-05T15:27:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	no worries
2009-05-05T15:27:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	oh, it's ext4....
2009-05-05T15:27:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	Oh oops, you wanted ext3 didn't you
2009-05-05T15:28:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	do you get lock-ups?
2009-05-05T15:28:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	I get a hard drive I/O error which stops the whole show :( But lockups as such no
2009-05-05T15:29:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	Have you tried looking at /var/log/messages for clues on what could be doing it?
2009-05-05T15:29:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	hmm, you mean you don't get into situation where only the mouse pointer moves, but nothing else responds, forcing you to reboot?
2009-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	hmm, I haven't taken a look at the logs since Jaunty was released. will try again
2009-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	yeah that has happened a couple of times, I do a ctrl + alt + f1 to console and see that I hace I/O errors on /dev/sda
2009-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	But funnily enough it has only happened since I plugged in my 80Gig SATA drive
2009-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	well, at least you get to ctrl+alt+f1... I can only alt+sysRq+b to reboot
2009-05-05T15:33:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	how often does it happen? is there anything that tends to trigger it (like opening programs etc)?
2009-05-05T15:34:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	i say, firefox is the main culprit
2009-05-05T15:35:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	I suggest cat /var/log/messages > messages.txt (so you can see the messages before they scroll past the window. It will create a file messages,txt)
2009-05-05T15:37:00.000Z	syockit	Mechdave	am viewing using vim for now. I'm going to play with the browser for a while to trigger a lockup, then reboot and diff. see you soon
2009-05-05T15:38:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	Maybe I will do some digging on my own system in a bit in an endeavour to illuminate the source of my lockups ;)
2009-05-05T15:38:00.000Z	Mechdave	syockit	no worries
