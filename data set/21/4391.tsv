2008-05-11T16:06:00.000Z	as84		Hello, I have an AMD 64 bit Asus laptop, do you guys recommend that I install the 32 bit version of ubuntu or the 64 bits ?
2008-05-11T16:06:00.000Z	as84		I only got 2gb
2008-05-11T16:07:00.000Z	ak5	as84	unless you need the 64bit arch, use the 32bit
2008-05-11T16:07:00.000Z	ak5	as84	only in theory
2008-05-11T16:11:00.000Z	ak5	as84	why not?
2008-05-11T16:11:00.000Z	ak5	as84	grab kubuntu then
2008-05-11T16:11:00.000Z	ak5	as84	choice is the keyword here
2008-05-11T16:12:00.000Z	ak5	as84	archlinux? yes
2008-05-11T16:12:00.000Z	as84	ak5	and what did you think of it ?
2008-05-11T16:12:00.000Z	ak5	as84	are you proficiant with the commandline?
2008-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	ak5	as84	go for it - its harder to setup
2008-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	ak5	as84	but way faster
2008-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	ak5	as84	I use it on my desktop
2008-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	ak5	as84	it supports a lot - I have never had any issues - but if you mean out of the box - I'd say no
2008-05-11T16:14:00.000Z	ak5	as84	arch is not supposed to work out of the box - after the install you don't even have X
2008-05-11T16:14:00.000Z	ak5	as84	if you are comfortable with that - just try it
2008-05-11T16:15:00.000Z	ak5	as84	I prefer using ubuntu for desktops if you don't want to configure anything
2008-05-11T16:15:00.000Z	ak5	as84	but servers are awesome in arch
2008-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	ak5	as84	well, ok - trust doesn't really have to do with it though - just take a look at the source :)
2008-05-11T16:17:00.000Z	ak5	as84	it is i686 optiized
2008-05-11T16:17:00.000Z	ak5	as84	same kernelVERSION
