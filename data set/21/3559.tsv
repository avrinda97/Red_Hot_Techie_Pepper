2009-07-11T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	Those look good.  is the apt-cache policy still the same?
2009-07-11T06:43:00.000Z	ohnoes	Flannel	 you lost me there.  what's an apt-cache policy?
2009-07-11T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	do `apt-cache policy gnome-do xchat` again and pastebin the output please.

2009-07-11T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	right, that's the same pastebin from earlier.  Actually, please do this one now: apt-cache policy gnome-do libgnomedesktop2.20-cil libnotify0.4-cil librsvg2-2.18-cil  libwnck2.20-cil and pastebin the output
2009-07-11T06:49:00.000Z	ohnoes	Flannel	 I added it at the bottom:  http://pastebin.com/m72fd5ff5
2009-07-11T06:51:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	Alright, uh, just so I can see them easier, please pastebin your sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list) do you have anything in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/?
2009-07-11T06:52:00.000Z	ohnoes	Flannel	sure. one second
2009-07-11T06:52:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	If you do have anything in that directory, just tack on its contents to sources.list in the paste
2009-07-11T06:52:00.000Z	ohnoes	Flannel	 nothing in sources.list.d
2009-07-11T06:55:00.000Z	ohnoes	Flannel	 http://pastebin.com/m195d92f9
2009-07-11T06:56:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	you don't need to keep tacking it onto the same you know
2009-07-11T06:57:00.000Z	ohnoes	Flannel	 oh okay. sorry
2009-07-11T06:57:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	No worries.  That all looks normal... *except* that some of the sources from your update don't appear in the sources.list, do you see anything about planet76.com in there?
2009-07-11T06:58:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	right, but I don't see it in your sources.list
2009-07-11T06:58:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	you sure there's no files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/?
2009-07-11T06:59:00.000Z	Flannel	ohnoes	Not that that would cause those packages to be missing, it's just odd in general
