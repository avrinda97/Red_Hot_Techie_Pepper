2011-10-26T06:04:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	can't ubuntu run on a mac book pro now days?
2011-10-26T06:04:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	the hardware is controlled by other open source codes
2011-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	sure, but a lot of non-mac OS's can run on G4 processers as well
2011-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	the OS is what makes the difference; and in this day and age to REACH BILLIONS; requires the ROOTS of what Linus and others gave us
2011-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	I have a G4 Mac-mini that runs Linux & BSD just fine
2011-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	exactly
2011-10-26T06:09:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	IE: that's not an x86 processor :p
2011-10-26T06:14:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	back in the day; x'x'86 was always infected; but made me happy
2011-10-26T06:14:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	???
2011-10-26T06:14:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	x86; x386; x486
2011-10-26T06:14:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	infected?
2011-10-26T06:15:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	raped?
2011-10-26T06:16:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	I have no idea what you are trying to say
2011-10-26T06:17:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	most people don't; i'm saying that the x86 plateform helped promote Ubuntu and GNU and the likes there of
2011-10-26T06:18:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	um, ok
2011-10-26T06:19:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	most of GNU was not developed on x86 :p
2011-10-26T06:19:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	GNU still works on a x86 though
2011-10-26T06:20:00.000Z	wmoxam	dn4	oh, you're a zealot. I see
2011-10-26T06:23:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	I'd like to be an archon
2011-10-26T06:24:00.000Z	dn4	wmoxam	as an archon i'd let everything run amok; like it already is; so I don't need to be; it already is; ad-hominems suck btw
