2011-08-20T12:41:00.000Z	idefix		why would I want to update to a dammy upgrade package for firefox-3.0?
2011-08-20T12:41:00.000Z	idefix		dummy *
2011-08-20T12:41:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	? you mean a metapackage?
2011-08-20T12:41:00.000Z	idefix	iceroot_	Important security update
2011-08-20T12:42:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	can you post the exact package-name + ubuntu-version?
2011-08-20T12:42:00.000Z	idefix	iceroot_	firefox-3.0
2011-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	idefix		why do I need something called "dummy upgrade package for firefox 3.0"?
2011-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	that is a metapackage
2011-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	that means you dont have to install the package firefox-3.0.1.2.1-foobar and for the next security-update you have to install firefox-3.0.1.2.2-foobar
2011-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	the metapackage firefox-3.0 is always installing the current firefox 3.0
2011-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	the same for the kernel
2011-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	idefix		an 'inbetween' package?
2011-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	idefix		you're not just messing with me now?
2011-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	its just a package which is only installing a dependency, nothing else
2011-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	idefix		the whole world is against me :(
2011-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	but firefox 3.0 is no longer supported
2011-08-20T12:46:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	its better to install the package "firefox" instead of "firefox-3.0". the package firefox is always pointing to the newest firefox in ubuntu, while firefox-3.0 is only pointing to the newest firefox-3.0 in ubuntu
2011-08-20T12:46:00.000Z	idefix		so since firefox 3.0 is no longer supported I should not install the dummy package then..?
2011-08-20T12:46:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	just install the package "firefox"
2011-08-20T12:47:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	but again, what ubuntu-version?
2011-08-20T12:48:00.000Z	iceroot_	idefix	you can see with "cat /etc/issue"
