2012-11-04T06:24:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	what are you referring to (i'm lacking backlog)?
2012-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	tomreyn		thanks
2012-11-04T06:28:00.000Z	cornell	tomreyn	I've upgraded from 10 to 12.04 and was sorely unhappy with Unity and am using Gnome Classic.  Windows tend to pop around.  When I shift a window partly onto another workspace and click on something else, the window pops back.  Some applications, the window pops down to the bottom of the screen for no apparent reason.  And if I drag a window to close to the top, it's resized to full height, top to bottom (and it's a bit hard to

2012-11-04T06:30:00.000Z	cornell	tomreyn	"tomreyn: cornell: this was cut iff behind: (and it's a bit hard t" ?
2012-11-04T06:30:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	i've never tried gnome classic on 12.04, though, so chances are i won't be able to help other than suggesting you file bug reports.
2012-11-04T06:31:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	yes that's what i just said to you
2012-11-04T06:31:00.000Z	cornell		I'd like to be able to describe it more tersely, perhaps refer to it by name.
2012-11-04T06:32:00.000Z	cornell		Yes, tomreyn, and "this was cut iff behind: (and it's a bit hard t" makes no sense to me.
2012-11-04T06:32:00.000Z	cornell		Was it truncated, or ... something?
2012-11-04T06:32:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	yes, what you wrote when quoting yourself from earlier today was truncated
2012-11-04T06:33:00.000Z	cornell		Well, I didn't quote myself, just typed again.
2012-11-04T06:34:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	okay, but this is still incomplete then:  "And if I drag a window to close to the top, it's resized to full height, top to bottom (and it's a bit hard t"
2012-11-04T06:34:00.000Z	cornell		And I'm guessing that it's not a bug but someone's idea of a "feature".  Especially the bit about resizing the window.
2012-11-04T06:34:00.000Z	cornell		Ah...  If I drag a window to close to the top, it's resized to full height, top to bottom (and it's a bit hard to undo).
2012-11-04T06:35:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	i guess your best bet is to run ubuntu-bug on the package you suspect may be buggy, then add a descrition of the problem first, then re-read what you wrote for the long description and summarise it as the bug reports' title
2012-11-04T06:35:00.000Z	cornell		Very similar to a new feature in Windows 7.  The assumption that if you have the top of a window at the top of the screen, you must also want the bottom at the bottom.
2012-11-04T06:36:00.000Z	cornell		The package woud be ... gnome-shell ?
2012-11-04T06:37:00.000Z	cornell		Pardon me while I figure out about ubuntu-bug.
2012-11-04T06:37:00.000Z	tomreyn	cornell	actually now your description is complete it sounds more like you'Re running into a design choice you don't like. this may not make sense to report as a bug then,
