2012-08-01T17:53:00.000Z	eightieskhild		whats do i need to post to get network help?
2012-08-01T17:53:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	go to #network (or something like that)
2012-08-01T17:58:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	can you ping the dhcp? do you get network addresses from it correctly? can you ping 173.194.67.102? (google) we need more info
2012-08-01T18:01:00.000Z	eightieskhild	Squall5668	ya i can ping them
2012-08-01T18:02:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	 then you can ping google but can't resolve it?
2012-08-01T18:03:00.000Z	eightieskhild	Squall5668	true
2012-08-01T18:03:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	try using 8.8.8.8 as your DNS server
2012-08-01T18:03:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	google public dns server
2012-08-01T18:04:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	if that works, your ubuntu pc is "likely" not the problem
2012-08-01T18:05:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	nameserver 8.8.8.8
2012-08-01T18:06:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	yes
2012-08-01T18:08:00.000Z	eightieskhild	Squall5668	services networking restart ?
2012-08-01T18:09:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	i don't think you have to, but do so anyways
2012-08-01T18:09:00.000Z	eightieskhild	Squall5668	nope
2012-08-01T18:13:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	can you post your resolv.conf somewhere?
2012-08-01T18:15:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	go to /etc/dhcpcd.conf and add a line to it
2012-08-01T18:15:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	nohook resolv.conf
2012-08-01T18:17:00.000Z	eightieskhild	Squall5668	doesnt exist...
2012-08-01T18:18:00.000Z	Squall5668	eightieskhild	unless that's depricated too (:P) if you don't have a /etc/dhcpcd.conf then you are not using dhcp afaik
2012-08-01T18:18:00.000Z	eightieskhild	Squall5668	it says my wired network is unmanaged
