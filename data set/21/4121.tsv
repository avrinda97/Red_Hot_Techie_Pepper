2008-07-07T22:05:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	so: sudo apt-get nvidia-installer uninstall , then add, then install driver again
2008-07-07T22:01:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	seems like no problem... i'm using it, all is ok
2008-07-07T22:04:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	did you add DISABLED_MODULES="nv nvidia_new" to your /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common before installing?
2008-07-07T22:05:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	no... i didnt know about something like this
2008-07-07T22:11:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	does it matter which version i'll install? (if official from nvidia site, or propietary driver?)
2008-07-07T22:12:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	i'm not sure, i installed from official. 173 and 177 beta work well with that fix for me, but don't work without it
2008-07-07T22:32:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	 , so after adding nv nvidia_new to restricted modules, it works even worst... both driver wont load X corretly.. now I run 800x600 :-/
2008-07-07T22:43:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	what videocard do you have? and did you automatically configured xorg.conf in nvidia-driver installation?
2008-07-07T22:51:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	I am, where I was at beginning
2008-07-07T22:52:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	well.... glxinfo shows everything good, but compiz complains :-/
2008-07-07T22:54:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	somehow.. somewhere... compiz works with 173 driver :D
2008-07-07T22:55:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	so, now everything is fine?
2008-07-07T22:55:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	yes :) btw, this driver is only manually updateable right?
2008-07-07T22:59:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	don't know... i've manually installed new version (177 beta)
2008-07-07T23:03:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	it was my first thx, cause i'm using Linux only for 4-th day))) good luck
2008-07-07T23:04:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	I for 2 years :D
2008-07-07T23:06:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	heh :) now i'm trying to use envyng-gtk for auto-installing NVidia drivers, cause my manual installation gave me bug: Ctrl+Alt+F[1-6] causes to Blank Screen instead of tty
2008-07-07T23:07:00.000Z	michalxo	LonelyAss	that's not so hard :D
2008-07-07T23:08:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	i searched for solution and found that many people has the same issue, but their solutions don't work for me
2008-07-07T23:09:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	GL you too)
2008-07-07T23:10:00.000Z	LonelyAss	michalxo	ok, write me when you will be free
