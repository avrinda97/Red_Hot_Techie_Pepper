2010-04-28T03:07:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		Ive used ubuntu on this machine for a while... recently I had to wipe my drive. Reinstalled an old version of ubuntu then upgraded to most recent. For some reason it compiz will suddenly disapear and shortly after the computer will logg off completely and Ill have to type my pw again.
2010-04-28T03:08:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		this started AFTER installing custom desktop effects (spinning cube etc) but still continues after uninstalling
2010-04-28T03:08:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		Ill mail a chocolate chip cookie to anyone tht can help me!
2010-04-28T03:09:00.000Z	jrib	CreativeChemist	what does "old version" mean?
2010-04-28T03:09:00.000Z	CreativeChemist	jrib	 intrepid
2010-04-28T03:09:00.000Z	jrib	CreativeChemist	you upgraded intrepid -> jaunty -> karmic?
2010-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	CreativeChemist	jrib	 nope, followed the website for a direct upgrade to karmic... update-manager --dev version or whatever
2010-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		wait
2010-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		not karmic... whatever 10.04 is :P
2010-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	CreativeChemist	erm, whatever website you followed advised you incorrectly.  You may have a broken install.  Why don't you just install karmic fresh?
2010-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	CreativeChemist	jrib	 ubuntu.com was the website :P
2010-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	CreativeChemist	I guarantee you it did not tell you to upgrade directly from intrepid to lucid
2010-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		it did
2010-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	CreativeChemist	link?
2010-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		only site i trust
2010-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		just a sec
2010-04-28T03:12:00.000Z	CreativeChemist		might reboot again as i search
2010-04-28T03:13:00.000Z	CreativeChemist	jrib	 meh its freezing.. but thats where it said. Doesn't matter. I cant install the new one fresh because it breaks wireless
2010-04-28T03:14:00.000Z	CreativeChemist	jrib	 and I don't have a wired connection (tis in roommates room and dont want to sit in her room while I try to fix it)
2010-04-28T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	CreativeChemist	I am telling you it did not say that because that it isn't supported.  Anyway install 10.04 correctly if you want and then head over to #ubuntu+1 for support as it's still not released yet
2010-04-28T03:16:00.000Z	CreativeChemist	jrib	 easier question, how do I switch to metacity then back to compiz?
