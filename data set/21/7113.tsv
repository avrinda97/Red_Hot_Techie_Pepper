2009-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	obf213		just wondering is there a better plugin for WMV than the default totem plugin?
2009-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	obf213		on firefox
2009-09-23T08:23:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	have you tried the mediaplayer connectivity plugin for firefox?
2009-09-23T08:23:00.000Z	obf213	thiebaude	i dont need info on the media repository i'm mearly asking for an opinion
2009-09-23T08:24:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	i just relized that
2009-09-23T08:24:00.000Z	obf213		yeah i use the basic totem plugin, i've tried the vlc on it doesn't seem to work, i was just wondering if they snuck a superior one in ther and i didn't notice
2009-09-23T08:24:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	what about mplayer?
2009-09-23T08:25:00.000Z	thiebaude		it works for me
2009-09-23T08:25:00.000Z	obf213		i'll try that
2009-09-23T08:25:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	ok, good luck with it
2009-09-23T08:26:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	when i used vlc a couple times before i didn't have sound
2009-09-23T08:26:00.000Z	obf213		yeah its funky
2009-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	obf213		i just want something that actualy lets me skip content without breaking
2009-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	thiebaude		but i use mediaplayer connectivity plugin for firefox and i can choose which player i want to use, obf213
2009-09-23T08:28:00.000Z	obf213	thiebaude	what is the name of that package i dont think have it
2009-09-23T08:28:00.000Z	obf213		is it in the repos
2009-09-23T08:28:00.000Z	thiebaude		i had to google for mediaplayer connectivity
2009-09-23T08:29:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	im not sure if its in synaptic
2009-09-23T08:29:00.000Z	obf213		ok
2009-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	obf213	thiebaude	thanks so much for this plugin. vlc works much better than the vlc plugin and i can skip back and forth in the stream
2009-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	thiebaude	obf213	no problem
