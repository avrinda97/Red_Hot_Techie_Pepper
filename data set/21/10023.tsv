2005-12-11T09:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	that depends on which games you're talking about - regular Windows games won't run without using other applications to emulate Windows...
2005-12-11T09:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	that's going to depend on which games you're interested in...
2005-12-11T09:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	like I said, that depends on the game - I'd search google if I were you
2005-12-11T09:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	Linux isn't just a different version of Windows, it's a totally different system, so Windows programs can't run in Linux... and the emulators aren't perfect and can't do some things either...
2005-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	no viruses, no spyware, none of that crap. and no need to run antivirus, antispyware and the rest of *that* crap...
2005-12-11T09:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	Ubuntu is specifically aimed at non-hackers... it's designed to be usable by anyone
2005-12-11T09:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	with 512 you should be fine, Ubuntu will probably run at least as fast as XP, probably faster
2005-12-11T10:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	Enemy Territory & Americas Army both have Linux-native versions...
2005-12-11T10:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	yes - and it's Ubuntu, please...
2005-12-11T10:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	what does StyleXP do? If it's a theme manager, then Ubuntu has a very good one built right in
2005-12-11T10:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	matatata	when you get your CDs, there's even a note on them encouraging you to copy them!
