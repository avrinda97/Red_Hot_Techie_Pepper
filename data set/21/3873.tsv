2008-10-29T22:24:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	type java -version it should print out jre version if installed
2008-10-29T22:17:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	launch firefox from terminal; when it crashes telll us what the error message was
2008-10-29T22:17:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	already did: http://pastebin.com/f2a90ca03
2008-10-29T22:19:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	you seem to be using gcj; can you try to use sun-java and see if that causes ff to crash too?
2008-10-29T22:19:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	I installed sun-java via synaptic, but same crash. but I didn't intsall gcj. could that crash it?
2008-10-29T22:20:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	could be cos ff is still using gcj
2008-10-29T22:23:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	it no longer crashes, it now says there's no software installed to handle the applet and wants me to reinstall cgj. I already installed sun-java6-bin and sun-java6-jre, should I need anything else?
2008-10-29T22:25:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	1.5.0
2008-10-29T22:28:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	how can I get the latest version of java?
2008-10-29T22:29:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	synaptic
2008-10-29T22:30:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	tried that. do you know what packages I need, specifically?
2008-10-29T22:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	sun-java6-jre
2008-10-29T22:31:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	already installed :/
2008-10-29T22:31:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	now if you run ff from terminal does it say anything?
2008-10-29T22:32:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	that'd be a good thing to check, wouldn't it ;P brb
2008-10-29T22:33:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	it doesn't give me an error or crash, it says that I need to install GCJ to use java
2008-10-29T22:33:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	weird
2008-10-29T22:34:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	yeah, I know. I don't really consider myself a *total* noob anymore at linux, which is why this problem is so frustrating
2008-10-29T22:37:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	I think I might have figured out a solution. sudo apt-get remove sun-java6-* && sudo apt-get install sun-java6-*
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	outbackwifi	goose	you could try that
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	goose	outbackwifi	I'll let you know if it works or not in 300 MB
