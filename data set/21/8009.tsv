2006-06-08T14:49:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	would that be good for you ? http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/~richard/xml-check.html
2006-06-08T14:50:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	no, it has to be my own DTD and it has to be offline
2006-06-08T14:51:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	depending on your level of skill, flexml might help you.
2006-06-08T14:52:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	I'll try that
2006-06-08T14:53:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	xmlstarlet might be good, too
2006-06-08T14:58:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	xmlstarlet does the job, thank you
2006-06-08T14:58:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	great !
2006-06-08T15:05:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	xmlstarlet only checks if the xml file is well formed, it does not validate against my dtd :/ and flexml is really too geeky for me^^
2006-06-08T15:07:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	too bad.
2006-06-08T15:08:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	gnustep-base-common also contains a tool called xml-parse, which claims to validate xml documents.
2006-06-08T15:11:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	how do I get this tool, apt-getting it doesnt work and after installing the gnustep-base-common it isnt there either
2006-06-08T15:12:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	actually, I don't know, I was checking on my Debian box.
2006-06-08T15:12:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	according to packages.ubuntulinux.org, /usr/bin/xmlparse is in in gnustep-base-common
2006-06-08T15:14:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	got it, testing now
2006-06-08T15:18:00.000Z	phlexonance	Yoric	doesnt seem to work
2006-06-08T15:18:00.000Z	Yoric	phlexonance	that's a shame.
