2009-07-28T20:37:00.000Z	judithtgilde		I'm trying to add the medibuntu repo to install googleearth, but although the repo seems to be recognized by synaptic the googleearth package does not seem to appear
2009-07-28T20:37:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	Are you sure that package is in that repo?
2009-07-28T20:38:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	http://packages.medibuntu.org/jaunty/index.html suggest it is
2009-07-28T20:39:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	It does appear to be that way.  Are those other packages showing up?
2009-07-28T20:40:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	no, none of them show up
2009-07-28T20:41:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	Did you reload synaptic?  Does it show up in the origins section?
2009-07-28T20:42:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	yes, medibuntu is in the list
2009-07-28T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	Did you "reload" ??
2009-07-28T20:43:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	yes, a dozen times
2009-07-28T20:44:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	pretty weird huh?
2009-07-28T20:44:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	Yes it is very odd.  Does your synaptic reload with no problems?  How did you add the repo?
2009-07-28T20:46:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	yes, it reloads fine. I followed the instructions at "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu#Adding the Repositories" to add the key and list the repo in sources.list.d
2009-07-28T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	Go into System -> Admin -> Software sources.  What checkboxes do you have enabled?
2009-07-28T20:49:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	Medibuntu (non-source variant) is enabled under third-party
2009-07-28T20:49:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	enabling their source variant did not help
2009-07-28T20:53:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	hmm, it seems the quick search does not really search all repos when all is selected...
2009-07-28T20:54:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	quick search searches what is listed in the window at that time
2009-07-28T20:54:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	I hate qucik search ;)  It's counter-intuitive
2009-07-28T20:55:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	when I cleared the search box I saw googleearth in the list, but when quicksearching for it only the main googleearthpackage thingy...
2009-07-28T20:56:00.000Z	judithtgilde	edbian	thanks a lot of helping me :)
2009-07-28T20:57:00.000Z	edbian	judithtgilde	NP!
