2008-12-31T07:22:00.000Z	ligeia1	grinn	ok.  What machine is this again?  What wireless card do you have?
2008-12-31T07:26:00.000Z	grinn	ligeia1	this is the computer i bought http://www.amazon.com/Acer-8-9-Inch-Netbook-Processor-Battery/dp/tech-data/B001FBW1NC/ref=de_a_smtd
2008-12-31T07:28:00.000Z	ligeia1	grinn	don't know anything about it.  The first thing you need to do is make sure the wireless card is recognized.  Check if you have anything in System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers to install.  If not, just google "Acer Aspire One Ubuntu Intrepid" and see what comes up.  Ask here before doing anything that you don't understand of course.  I must go now though (I don't know anything about that specific computer anyway)
2008-12-31T07:28:00.000Z	ligeia1	grinn	add "wireless" to the google search terms :)
2008-12-31T07:29:00.000Z	grinn	ligeia1	thanks for all your help
