2009-04-19T12:33:00.000Z	Zedde		Hello , If I do apt-cache search opera I get 50+ results, and most of the dosn't have the word opera in it, why ?
2009-04-19T12:34:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	This is very conditional
2009-04-19T12:35:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	is there a way just search for the word "opera" nothing ells ? or starts with opera only
2009-04-19T12:35:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	I'm running ubuntu 8.10 x64 and did a apr-get update before
2009-04-19T12:35:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	have you searched via synaptic?
2009-04-19T12:37:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	synaptic? .. I tried to search using the GUI too but about the same results , not as many but still non off them have the word opera in it
2009-04-19T12:39:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	There seems to be no opera package in ubuntu repos
2009-04-19T12:39:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	try this
2009-04-19T12:39:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	okay , then I should get no results ;(
2009-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	did you already install it?
2009-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	that package won't appear in synaptic untill you install it
2009-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	is there another way to search with apt ? like opera* or "opera" ?
2009-04-19T12:41:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	There is no package for opera in the official repos
2009-04-19T12:42:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	you should be able to just double click it and install
2009-04-19T12:43:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	I'm going to do that :) kjust making my point that I can't trust the apt if I'm searching for a pkg :(
2009-04-19T12:44:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	The package will appear once you install it, there are legal reasons why it is not in the official repo
2009-04-19T12:44:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	okay,
2009-04-19T12:44:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	a new question that, can't I narrow down a serch with apt ?
2009-04-19T12:45:00.000Z	dotblank	Zedde	Currently this feature is being requested in ubuntu brainstorm.
2009-04-19T12:45:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	okay cool
2009-04-19T12:46:00.000Z	Zedde	dotblank	thanks for that help
