2007-07-19T09:47:00.000Z	Falstius		to answer my own question from earlier, to get front panel audio working I had to add options snd_hda_intel model=3stack to a file in /etc/modprobe.d/
2007-07-19T09:27:00.000Z	Falstius		if anyone syncs home directories between multiple machines, what do you use?
2007-07-19T09:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	 rysnc, or wget depending on whats required
2007-07-19T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	they sync - not keep snapshots
2007-07-19T09:30:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	royel: okay.  I was hoping to set up something where one machine keeps differential snapshots and both machines are synced with the current versions.  Kind of like rdiff-backup.
2007-07-19T10:01:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	kind of depends on what he is trying to build.  If he'd asked a question instead of pase-flooding it would've been better.
2007-07-19T10:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	even so - its ubuntu support not software building support, but yes, that would have been a better approach
2007-07-19T10:05:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	sorry, I just ate my first homegrown tomato of the summer and lost all track of what you were talking about ;)
2007-07-19T10:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	yummy, no problem
2007-07-22T05:45:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	captainm: there are devices which come up as /dev/sda (or whatever) and not sda1.  I have a usb key like that.
2007-07-22T05:56:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	CCmonster: he needs to know what to change it to first.  CCmonster, you may have to scroll down pretty far.
2007-07-22T06:03:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	give it a rest.  The ubuntu menu.1st is long and intimidating to a new user.
2007-07-22T06:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	give what a rest ? its perfectly sound advice
2007-07-22T06:04:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	which you've repeated 5 times in increasingly condescending tones.  Obviously your advice isn't appropriate for him.
2007-07-22T06:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	because he doesn't want to do it, he wants someone to do it for yhim
2007-07-22T06:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	apologies, I've not seen you ask a question. Go for it
2007-07-22T06:10:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	no worries, I haven't asked any tonight.
2007-07-22T06:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	ahhh I thought you where saying no-one had responded
2007-07-22T06:10:00.000Z	Falstius	ikonia	since I'm often the one giving help here, my questions are a little harder than the average #ubuntu questions ;)
2007-07-22T06:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	exactly why I was interested
2007-07-22T06:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Falstius	I suffer the same too
