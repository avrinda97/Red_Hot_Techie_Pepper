2010-02-21T10:48:00.000Z	oonh		question: firefox and pidgin stopped working. the windows are unresponsive. replacing .mozilla doesn't seem to affect it.
2010-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	did you try to reboot? what did it happen after?
2010-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	the behavior persists after reboots
2010-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	did you try to uninstall these two applications? and to install them again?
2010-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	no, because they work fine when I'm logged in as a different user
2010-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	what did you do for them to stop working? i mean if you create a new user, they will work fine, but if you do some action X, they stop working. can you remember what X was?
2010-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	no. no changes whatsoever
2010-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	create a new user. will new user have the problem?
2010-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	probably not
2010-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	I'll try installing/uninstalling firefox,
2010-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	you know where to start Firefox Safe Mode on Ubuntu?
2010-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	no, not
2010-02-21T10:53:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	not uninstall Firefox
2010-02-21T10:53:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	find Firefox Safe Mode menu somewhere
2010-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	I run openbox
2010-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	 firefox --safe-mode
2010-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	path/to/firefox.exe --safe-mode
2010-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	same problem
2010-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	firefox safe mode does not work and has the same failure mode as running firefox
2010-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	Gryllida	oonh	create a new user and delete this one. this one is defective. me know why? no. or just hang on, maybe somebody will help you. me is not Ubuntu user yet. you can also try irc://moznet/firefox
2010-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	oonh	Gryllida	this is the user that I've been using for months, and I can't easily just delete it
