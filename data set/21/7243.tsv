2007-01-13T08:52:00.000Z	prinneh		So... My mac harddisk is kinda dead. Or at least it\s failing. Anyway, I can\t boot into macosx, so I thought I\d try the ubuntu live cd, since I\ve had good experience with that in the past, to see if I could rescue a few choice files.
2007-01-13T08:52:00.000Z	prinneh		I can find my harddisk with the partition manager
2007-01-13T08:52:00.000Z	prinneh		But I\m not sure how to mount it
2007-01-13T08:54:00.000Z	prinneh		Any ideas?
2007-01-13T08:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	PPC or intel?
2007-01-13T08:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	mkdir /media/macdrive && sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/hda3 /media/macdrive
2007-01-13T08:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	Where do you want to copy them to? Just go to the folder /media/macdisk and move them
2007-01-13T08:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	Ahh, ctrl instead of apple
2007-01-13T08:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	No, you need to run the command I gave you first
2007-01-13T09:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	run: gksudo nautilus or use the cp command with sudo
2007-01-13T09:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	just run: gksudo nautilus
2007-01-13T09:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	the window that comes up will have rights to read and write to anywhere ( except writing to your mac partition )
2007-01-13T09:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	It means to run a command as root
2007-01-13T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	You can use the gimp and inkscape
2007-01-13T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	inkscape > illustrator IMHO
2007-01-13T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	FYI, if you have another computer and a firewire cable you can boot your mac as if it were just a firewire drive, it's called target disk mode
2007-01-13T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	Does it give you an error?
2007-01-13T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	Only that one window you oppened with sudo can access those files
2007-01-13T09:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	Yes, you can just create a new window from the one you have open now, any windows you create from it will also have root privaleges
2007-01-13T09:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	It can, you just have to get to it by going to file system -> media ( /media )
2007-01-13T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prinneh	Ok, lets just do this from the terminal instead.
