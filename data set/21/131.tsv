2012-11-05T10:32:00.000Z	Erin	escott	why does parted claim my disks are SCSI ?
2012-11-05T10:11:00.000Z	escott	Erin	at 2TB it very well may be (and probably is) GPT but that doesn't have anything to do with NTFS so how does it act like it is GPT
2012-11-05T10:13:00.000Z	escott	Erin	UEFI requires GPT but GPT has nothing to do with EFI
2012-11-05T10:14:00.000Z	escott	Erin	why dont you run "sudo parted -l" and send us that
2012-11-05T10:18:00.000Z	escott	Erin	except that MSFT didnt set it up like that for some weird reason... but clearly that is what it is meant for
2012-11-05T10:19:00.000Z	escott	Erin	stop using fdisk. forget it ever existed
2012-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	Erin	escott	haha but I had just learned how to use it to partition discs from the command line earlier this year :-)
2012-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	escott	Erin	fdisk cannot see gpt so it saw the GPT protective partition which is written to the msdos partition table to make sure stupid tools like fdisk don't make people think the disk is empty
2012-11-05T10:21:00.000Z	Erin	escott	ahh well thanks a ton I clearly see the partition in parted, ill have to learn how to use that now :-D
2012-11-05T10:21:00.000Z	escott	Erin	blackshirt, sudo parted -l to list partitions and for most functions. gdisk if you have issues where a tool messed things up by say installing an msdos partition on a disk that had GPT but failing to remove the GPT structures when it did so
2012-11-05T10:33:00.000Z	escott	Erin	because they are :) SATA is basically SCSI with ATA something
2012-11-05T10:33:00.000Z	Erin	escott	oh yea?
2012-11-05T10:37:00.000Z	escott	Erin	im rather fuzzy on all this but there is a difference between the scsi connector (Which is the physical connector and electrical connectivity standards) and the scsi protocol which is how to talk to the disk over that electrical connection. SATA uses a SATA connector and a SCSI type command protocol so the kernel uses the SCSI drivers
2012-11-05T10:43:00.000Z	escott	Erin	how SCSI is SATA or the reverse or something ...http://virtualvenesect.com/2011/08/12/converting-a-servers-scsi-backplane-to-use-sata-drives/
2012-11-05T10:49:00.000Z	Erin	escott	man that dude is pretty smart, id never have pulled that off and my soldering skill is novice at best.
2012-11-05T10:55:00.000Z	escott	Erin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_attached_SCSI goes over some of the differences
2012-11-05T10:56:00.000Z	escott	Erin	there are also things like an enterprise disk when it encounters and error has firmware that fails the read immediately counting on the RAID controller to fix things up
2012-11-05T10:56:00.000Z	escott	Erin	consumer SATA will sit there and reread until the cows come home if it thinks it can get a good read of the data
2012-11-05T10:57:00.000Z	Erin	escott	yea ive seen it do that on failing drives, pretty stupid
2012-11-05T10:57:00.000Z	escott	Erin	that rereading is a good thing if thats the only copy of your wedding video though... so different users different needs
