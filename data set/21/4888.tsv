2010-05-17T19:13:00.000Z	jud	histo	ok i'll look at that ...the returns are just semicolons then?
2010-05-17T19:13:00.000Z	histo	jud	are you copying and pasting from a website?
2010-05-17T19:13:00.000Z	jud	histo	yeah
2010-05-17T19:13:00.000Z	histo	jud	you can copy and paste it then.
2010-05-17T19:14:00.000Z	histo	jud	it will enter it one line at a time
2010-05-17T19:15:00.000Z	jud	histo	ok..what's the difference if it's from a website? how does it know to return after each line?
2010-05-17T19:16:00.000Z	histo	jud	it doesn't matter where its from but if you have a list of comands seperated by returns, copy and paste will work.
2010-05-17T19:17:00.000Z	jud	histo	ok, so the returns are indicated by semicolons?
2010-05-17T19:17:00.000Z	histo	jud	no.
2010-05-17T19:19:00.000Z	jud	histo	so, the return is not indicated by a chracter? am i asking one of those questions a beginner is not likely to understand?
2010-05-17T19:21:00.000Z	histo	jud	you'd have to read about bash
2010-05-17T19:22:00.000Z	jud	histo	 ok thanks
2010-05-17T19:22:00.000Z	histo	jud	the semicolon tells it execute each consecutively
2010-05-17T19:23:00.000Z	jud	histo	ok
2010-05-17T19:23:00.000Z	histo	jud	but bash is very powerfull and you really should read a howto on it.
2010-05-17T19:24:00.000Z	jud	histo	got a link?
2010-05-17T19:26:00.000Z	jud	histo	is that a command for accessing a how to in terminal?
2010-05-17T19:27:00.000Z	histo	jud	no I was having ubottu send you a link
2010-05-17T19:28:00.000Z	jud	histo	ah that's funny
2010-05-17T19:28:00.000Z	jud	histo	thanks
