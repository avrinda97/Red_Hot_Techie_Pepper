2007-03-09T16:48:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee		hello
2007-03-09T16:48:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee		i need some help
2007-03-09T16:48:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee		where can i found base-config?
2007-03-09T16:49:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee		its a lot easier to switch the repositories
2007-03-09T16:50:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee		hey, is it possible to run kde and gnome?
2007-03-09T16:50:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee		lol
2007-03-09T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	yep.  Install both kubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop (well, install the other, from what you started with)
2007-03-09T16:51:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	It asked which display manager (kdm or gdm), not desktop environment.  you can choose each time you login (that's the display manager), under "sessions"
2007-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	no, it's much more complicated, since "kubuntu-desktop" is a meta package
2007-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	whichever you'd like.  Doesn't really matter one way or the other.
2007-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	Yep
2007-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	Flannel	how would i do that
2007-03-09T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	you use autoremove, I... don't really know the exact syntax.
2007-03-09T16:57:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	base-config is in universe
2007-03-09T16:57:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	actually, base-config isn't used anymore.
2007-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	The deb package isn't used anymore: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/base/base-config
2007-03-09T17:03:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	the package is empty, I believe.
2007-03-09T17:05:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	What extra repositories have you added?  Since, that's not a normal dependency
2007-03-09T17:05:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	what is your ultimate goal?  Since base-config literally is empty.
2007-03-09T17:06:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	You're not making any sense.  You apparently need base-config simply because you need it.  Except, it's empty, so getting it wouldn't do anything.
2007-03-09T17:07:00.000Z	Flannel	meeeeeeeeeeeeeee	which ones?  You're really not giving us anything of substance to work with
