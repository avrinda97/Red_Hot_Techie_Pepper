2010-08-27T12:40:00.000Z	bint		what exactly does "apt" mean?
2010-08-27T12:40:00.000Z	bint		sudo is a root cmd? apt - i dont know and get is just to get files
2010-08-27T12:40:00.000Z	bint		well my english's to weak.. aptitude never heard
2010-08-27T12:41:00.000Z	bint		gooa translate it :D
2010-08-27T12:41:00.000Z	bint		yep
2010-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	bint		so "sudo" doesn't mean that i'm going for a root command?
2010-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	bint		i thought everything with sudo is kinda administator thing
2010-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	bint		let us know
2010-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	bint		ahh ok
2010-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	bint		yep
2010-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	type this:  man sudo
2010-08-30T02:20:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	at some point you cross the line from just being a user to learning system administration, and most sysadmin stuff really requires knowledge of the command line
2010-08-30T02:21:00.000Z	bint	dougb_freebsd	you're right.. but since i'm a noob and i kinda wanna have a gui just to easily access my server
2010-08-30T02:22:00.000Z	bint	dougb_freebsd	thats it :) i mean still there is a lot cmd line based stuff to do.. even with a guy
2010-08-30T02:28:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	you can always uninstall stuff you don't want after you install the UI
2010-08-30T02:28:00.000Z	bint	dougb_freebsd	sure.. but it kinda doesn't make any sense for me to install a shitload of apps just to remove 90% of em again
2010-08-30T02:30:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	you have a habit of asking for advice, then arguing about the advice you get ....  you want "easy," but you want it on your terms, even though you seem unwilling or unable to figure out the answers for yourself. You might want to consider whether or not this is a good long-term strategy for you. :)
2010-08-30T02:36:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	I think the statement is pretty self-explanatory
2010-08-30T02:37:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	You're free to consider what I wrote, or not.  :)
2010-08-30T02:45:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	are you logged into the physical machine directly, or are you ssh'ing into it?
2010-08-30T02:51:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	bint	no, type a colon, then q at the colon prompt
