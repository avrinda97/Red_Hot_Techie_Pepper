2010-03-26T07:14:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	i an using Onboard graphics card [Nvidia] .After setting up resoltuion at System->Preferences->Display , it's not being saved after restart.
2010-03-26T07:14:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	try to use the Vesa driver, or search for new hardware specific drivers
2010-03-26T07:15:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	i have installed nvidia hardware drivers.
2010-03-26T07:15:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	Try to use Vesa drivers once nd see if it saves the settings
2010-03-26T07:16:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	will it work well for Nvidia card ?
2010-03-26T07:16:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	absolutely
2010-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	just get rid of windows
2010-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	unfortunately I can't :)
2010-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	was a linux joke
2010-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	never mind .
2010-03-26T07:25:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	and btw, your partition table doesn't matter, the boot loader will load any bootable partition
2010-03-26T07:28:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	you need to learn how to use grub, you can boot it by yourself by initializing your partition
2010-03-26T07:29:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	Hope you can help me fixing with this at present!! :)
2010-03-26T07:29:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	You need to google how to boot windwos partition with grub from command line I am not doing searching for you
2010-03-26T08:11:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	just one more thing dude. Mine xp partition is in /dev/sda5 . So in menu.lst it should be given as (hd0,4) ?
2010-03-26T08:12:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	it depends, grub will not list partition number the same as the /dev dir
2010-03-26T08:13:00.000Z	arunbabu	vVvHACKERvVv	i think my problem is with that. Now how can give the correct (hdX,X) ? On what it depends?
2010-03-26T08:14:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	arunbabu	remember hd(0 is drive one and the second number is the partition number
