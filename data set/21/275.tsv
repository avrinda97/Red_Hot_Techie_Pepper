2012-04-13T00:28:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	freenx is not in repos.. there should be DEBs somewhere
2012-04-13T00:30:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	did you try adding that PPA mentioned on the wiki?
2012-04-13T00:31:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freenxx-team
2012-04-13T00:37:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	so did you add the freenx ppa and did apt-get update?
2012-04-13T00:37:00.000Z	KooolaNL	lo0m	yse
2012-04-13T00:40:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	there seems to be no such package.. did you mean freenx-server ?
2012-04-13T00:41:00.000Z	KooolaNL	lo0m	the tutorial says it without -server
2012-04-13T00:42:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	there is freenx package, sorry... are you sure you did apt-get update?
2012-04-13T00:43:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	i tried it right now and sudo apt-cache search freenx shows positive match
2012-04-13T00:45:00.000Z	KooolaNL	lo0m	yes i am sure
2012-04-13T00:46:00.000Z	lo0m	KooolaNL	that's really strange.. what ubuntu version are you using?
