2006-10-18T12:02:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	yeah,  thats what it means when it says couldn't initialize right?
2006-10-18T12:08:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	that didn't do anything...
2006-10-18T12:08:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	i never remember installing hal... does it come with the os?
2006-10-18T12:09:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	dapper
2006-10-18T12:10:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	hald: /usr/sbin/hald /usr/share/man/man8/hald.8.gz
2006-10-18T12:11:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	odd that find command didnt find it
2006-10-18T12:11:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	doesn't seem to come up
2006-10-18T12:12:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	i think so.. but nothing showed up in ps
2006-10-18T12:16:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	what should i be looking for here
2006-10-18T12:17:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	that comes up with nothing
2006-10-18T12:19:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	ok, I will try that now
2006-10-18T12:19:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	brb
2006-10-18T12:24:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	sill failing to initialize HAL... also it says the power manager cannot start until you start the dbus system service
2006-10-18T12:28:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	do you think the power issue is related?
2006-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	thanks for your help
2006-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	starsky	marcrosoft	maybe. but not that likely. hal controls the device drivers .. no problem as i said #hal on freenode.net
2006-10-18T12:30:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	yeah i am in the hal channel now :)
2006-10-18T12:31:00.000Z	marcrosoft	starsky	going to try this  http://easylinuxguide.com/forum/index.php?topic=68.msg233
