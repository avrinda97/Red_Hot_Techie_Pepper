2005-04-22T07:51:00.000Z	PecK		no drivers, no firmware, Reblended, but depends on your firmware in fact, and whether ubuntu has compatible drivers built-in
2005-04-22T07:51:00.000Z	PecK	Reblended	but why do you ask?
2005-04-22T07:52:00.000Z	Reblended	PecK	I'm trying to figure out how to yank out my laptop hd... gonna just get a new one, this one is loosing health...

2005-04-22T07:53:00.000Z	Reblended	PecK	the strategy of opening the bottom of my laptop and poking around =] 
2005-04-22T07:53:00.000Z	PecK	Reblended	and why do you need to know if pcmcia works fine with ubuntu?
2005-04-22T07:54:00.000Z	Reblended	PecK	I don't have wifi built in, so I'm gonna have to use pcmcia
2005-04-22T07:54:00.000Z	PecK	Reblended	what does it have to do with ubuntu?

2005-04-22T07:55:00.000Z	PecK	Reblended	lol yeah, but I don't see it : you want to poke out your hd and replace it. seems fine. what's wifi and ubuntu got to do with it?
2005-04-22T07:56:00.000Z	Reblended	PecK	I've never taken my laptop hd out b4... so that's why I asked. =]
