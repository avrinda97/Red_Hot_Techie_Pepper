2012-04-11T10:45:00.000Z	Andy2113		evening everyone
2012-04-11T10:45:00.000Z	Andy2113		my computer's been failing. Internet keeps crashing, programs close randomly, I don't know what's going on.
2012-04-11T10:46:00.000Z	Andy2113		I was trying to torrent Ubuntu 11.04 and deluge closed on me. Firefox wont even open, nor Chrome or Chromium
2012-04-11T10:48:00.000Z	Andy2113		I am currently on 11.04
2012-04-11T10:49:00.000Z	Andy2113		also, it wont let me boot into ubuntu right away. When I select Ubuntu (or even other linux versions) it just keeps restarting over and over, until eventually by some miracle in lets me in
2012-04-11T10:49:00.000Z	Andy2113		and it's suuuuuuper buggy/unstable
2012-04-11T10:50:00.000Z	Andy2113		right now, I actually came to see if anybody could maybe give me the terminal command to do an upgrade, because I can't even access google to look that up
2012-04-11T10:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	what do you want to upgrade to ?
2012-04-11T10:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	stop
2012-04-11T10:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	run the memtest option, if there are any problems red warnings will appear
2012-04-11T10:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	run memtest for 24 hours
2012-04-11T10:55:00.000Z	Andy2113	ikonia	thank you for the suggestion, however this is my only way to communicate with my family back home. If I run a mem test for 24 hours I'lll be incommunicated for at least one day + the time it takes me figure out what the warnings are/if I should just format or upgrade.
2012-04-11T10:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	ok what do you want us to do
2012-04-11T10:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	you have a machine that won't work so you can't use it, you won't run the diag tools to fix it even though your machine doesn't work
2012-04-11T10:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	what would you like us to do ?
2012-04-11T10:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	tell you what, just do a clean install now if that's what you want to do
2012-04-11T10:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	you seem keen to do it, so just do it
2012-04-11T10:58:00.000Z	Andy2113	ikonia	that was my initial plan. Stop being such a smart-alecky ass
2012-04-11T10:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	I'm not, you want to clean install, so clean install, what's the problem
2012-04-11T11:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	it won't
2012-04-11T11:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Andy2113	upgrading won't fix it
