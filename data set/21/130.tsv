2012-08-21T20:03:00.000Z	`4fun`		heya guys, anyone know on how to start a batch file on boot in ubuntu server?
2012-08-21T20:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	add it in /etc/rc.local   add an ampersand at the end of the command and above the exit 0 line, itwill run as root at boot (unless you use su -c )
2012-08-21T20:16:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	this will work http://pastebin.com/wdWTruhq ? if i add it to /etc/rc.local ?
2012-08-21T20:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	you don't need the amperand on a line on it's own
2012-08-21T20:17:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	so remove it from the batch file and will still run at boot as root?
2012-08-21T20:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	yes, the ampersand backgrounds commands, so if you have one that never ends then it will hang the boot
2012-08-21T20:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	yours won't do that, so you can leave it. All commands run as root in the file
2012-08-21T20:41:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	i did this in my /etc/rc.local http://pastebin.com/0R0Ayk9h but it doesnt run on boot
2012-08-22T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	the line you added does nothing, it's a folder
2012-08-22T15:58:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	hmm how do i add it then? the batch file is called "batch03", i thought thats the right way
2012-08-22T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	then delete the end slash, the script will then run
2012-08-22T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	if the script runs forever, rather than firing once, add an ampersand to the end of the line, like so:  /home/testuser/scripts/batch03 &
2012-08-22T16:09:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	i have part of the patch that adds a text to ipv6-status text file to confirm the script ran fine, it works if i run it manualy
2012-08-22T16:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	did you add the absolute path of the file to update?
2012-08-22T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	yes, it runs as root, so if you use ~ then that will be /root not /home/username
2012-08-22T16:11:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	yes, the batch worked fine at boot, but this part didnt: echo IPv6 has been added at $(date) >> /home/testuser/ipv6-status
2012-08-22T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	instead, try:    echo "IPv6 has been added at $(date)" | tee -a /home/testuser/ipv6-status
2012-08-22T16:16:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	thanks alot dude, that did it!
2012-08-22T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	for adding to files I suggest you use tee rather than >>. its a bit beater
2012-08-22T16:31:00.000Z	`4fun`	ActionParsnip	just one last question, where do you think is the best location to put the batch file in?
2012-08-22T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	`4fun`	wherever you want, there is no best. I like to make ~/.bin   and add it to PATH and use that for my user scripts. Its not best, just how I do it
