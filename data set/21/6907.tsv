2007-07-23T06:03:00.000Z	JayRoe		can someone please tell me how to load a driver?
2007-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	JayRoe		davy_jones, could you please tell me the command to reload my nvidia drivers?
2007-07-23T06:05:00.000Z	JayRoe		davy_jones, sorry but I don't find you funny.
2007-07-23T06:07:00.000Z	JayRoe		megaqwerty, the thing is that after I go into standby (S3 suspend to ram), the video is all messed up. Is there a way to tell it to ctrl alt backspace ubuntu after the standby?
2007-07-23T06:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	Have you enabled Desktop Effects aka compiz?
2007-07-23T06:07:00.000Z	JayRoe		intuitivenipple, yes
2007-07-23T06:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	Try disabling them before the suspend, see if it makes a difference. there are known issues with Nvidia and compiz
2007-07-23T06:08:00.000Z	JayRoe		thanks intuitivenipple. I'll give it a try
2007-07-23T06:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	Do you know which model nvidia card it is?
2007-07-23T06:09:00.000Z	JayRoe		intuitivenipple, geforce 6150 onboard
2007-07-23T06:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	ok... I was going to suggest something put it doesn't apply to that model
2007-07-23T06:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	which nvidia driver version are you using?
2007-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	JayRoe	IntuitiveNipple	the one from the restricted drivers manager
2007-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	That should be okay then
2007-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	JayRoe		intuitivenipple, the screen gets messed up after standby, but if do a ctrl alt backspace, the screen gets back to normal
2007-07-23T06:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	yeah, try it without Effects see how you go. If it's that you can focus on workarounds for Compiz
2007-07-23T06:11:00.000Z	JayRoe	IntuitiveNipple	can I disable it without the use of sudo?
2007-07-23T06:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	Yes, goto the menu System -> Preferences -> Desktop Effects
2007-07-23T06:13:00.000Z	JayRoe	IntuitiveNipple	I'm sure that's disabled. I think I lost that menu when I installed compiz fusion
2007-07-23T06:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	JayRoe	ok, well Effects is a pared-down Compiz. You need to disable Compiz in that case to test whether its the cause
