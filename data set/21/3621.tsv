2011-05-26T00:57:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	using mdadmin?
2011-05-26T01:01:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	yeah, mdadm ? typo on my part
2011-05-26T01:02:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	run and paste bin: mdadm -D /dev/md0
2011-05-26T01:02:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	yes. I thought mdadm was like a utility or something since it was mdadmin : md-admin
2011-05-26T01:07:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	-a is shorthand for --manage --add ? you may have to manually re-add the drive. mdadm is not really how swap aware in my experience
2011-05-26T01:07:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	says not an md device.
2011-05-26T01:07:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	which is why so many people like that package that sends emails on raid status and state changes ? forget what its called
2011-05-26T01:07:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	oooo, email? oh man... you don't remember it?
2011-05-26T01:07:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	my syntax may be backwards ? -a may take the md device first and then the disk
2011-05-26T01:09:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	that's it. I just had to reverse the command
2011-05-26T01:09:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	do you know of a linux web site that has ALL of these commands oni t? I found ubuntu's wiki to be super helpful, but limited on information. It's things like this I wish Ic ould just see a massive listing of.
2011-05-26T01:10:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	was racking my brain trying to remember the package?
2011-05-26T01:10:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	I sure don't I often have to use mdadm --help
2011-05-26T01:11:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	I wrote a bash script to email the results of mdadm -D and cat /proc/mdstat
2011-05-26T01:12:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	mdadm --help really isn't that informative though, in my opinion. but then again, is --assemble = -a?
2011-05-26T01:13:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	you can build on --help? for instance: mdadmin --assemble --help
2011-05-26T01:13:00.000Z	SpaceBass	Roasted	( btw -A is assemble)
2011-05-26T01:14:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	is there any worthy guis to manage this or is terminal the best bet?
2011-05-26T01:20:00.000Z	Roasted	SpaceBass	by the way, what happens if my raid box blows up? Like lets say the system gets hit by lightning yet the drives are okay. How can I crack open the array to copy the data off manually to another source?
