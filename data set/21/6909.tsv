2007-01-05T09:05:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	you have w32codecs? i think i played one using mplayer no problem a while ago
2007-01-05T10:54:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	youre in gnome by default.  when you login thats what loads its your desktop environment
2007-01-05T10:56:00.000Z	xmOD	pike_	and for example the latest release is 2.16 so how do i install it?
2007-01-05T10:58:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	im not sure if its distributed with distro specific packages  or not. if so id be pretty straight forward
2007-01-05T10:59:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	its just a DE though.. i mean as long as you have windows displaying and the tools why bother
2007-01-05T11:04:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	http://art.gnome.org/ or gnomelook website there is a good faq on onthe art.gnome.org website basically you just uppack the theme to like /usr/share/themes/
2007-01-05T11:04:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	if you ls /usr/share/themes  all your current themes should show up
2007-01-05T11:05:00.000Z	xmOD	pike_	http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/29001499/  .. download this theme and see if this works for you
2007-01-05T11:09:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	i dont have a gui right now im ssh'd into from work.  it does appear to be a valid gtk2 theme though
2007-01-05T11:11:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	if you download then tar xfvz black.tar.gz  then sudo mv whateverdirectory /usr/share/themes/  then reopen your theme manager it doesnt work?
2007-01-05T11:11:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	it should just be there then
2007-01-05T11:12:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	ah
2007-01-05T11:13:00.000Z	xmOD	pike_	any solution?
2007-01-05T11:14:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	might see if someone else here can download it and look. i can get away with a terminal open but vnc from work my boss might notice :)
2007-01-05T11:21:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	im not too familiar with gnome. dont use it. but i think youre expecting the theme to make changes that would be from another theme. like application theme window border icon login manager theyre all diff things
2007-01-24T10:58:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	might try http://sourceforge.net/projects/btmgr/ for a quick fix also
2007-01-24T10:59:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	assuming you have a floppy drive
2007-01-24T11:05:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	no need to mount but yes you can do like:   grub> root(hd1,0)   <-- this is the partition with ubuntu installed then setup(hd0)  or hd1 whichever hd is setup to boot in your systems bios
2007-01-24T11:06:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	the recover howto gives a better explanation of that
2007-01-24T11:07:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	in other words you can install grub to whatever hard driver mbr you wish regardless of which driver ubuntu is on
2007-01-24T11:12:00.000Z	pike_	xmOD	to repair windows mbr (dont do it! stick with linux) boot to windows or from windows boot disk type "fdisk /mbr" i think is right
