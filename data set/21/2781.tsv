2009-06-22T17:31:00.000Z	Melio	veelaze	what video card do you have
2009-06-22T17:31:00.000Z	veelaze	Melio	Im not sure. On Vista; it just said it was called "Standard VGA Graphics Adapter"? I think the sound card is fine; not sure.
2009-06-22T17:32:00.000Z	Melio	veelaze	you would need to find out what hardware specific name your video card is, for the driver to be installed

2009-06-22T17:33:00.000Z	Melio		shouldnt this stuff be handled like a doctors office
