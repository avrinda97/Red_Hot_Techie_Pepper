2004-11-11T07:31:00.000Z	noda		Oh, by the way, how many people would be interested in an Epiphany extension which lets you load/unload other extensions? This question is for Ubuntu devs, too, since it'd mean repackaging of epiphany-extensions... and would be obselete by the time Epiphany 1.6 comes out
2004-11-11T07:31:00.000Z	noda		(The functionality is already in 1.5, but we could backport it to 1.4 if it were considered extremely useful)
2004-11-11T07:32:00.000Z	jdub	noda	1.5 will be in hoary anyway
2004-11-11T07:32:00.000Z	noda	jdub	I'll probably ignore it, then. It's really a dead-end development-wise.
2004-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	jdub	noda	me too, in certain ways; there was a lot of discussion about it pre-warty.
2004-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	noda	jdub	I know, I read the ML
2004-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	jdub	noda	multiverse == contrib/non-free and a bunch of other stuff
2004-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	noda	jdub	Oh, okay, so it's got java-package, nice :)
2004-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	noda	jdub	Problem is, the ML discussion really didn't say what Epiphany can possibly do to become default in Hoary
2004-11-11T07:36:00.000Z	jdub	noda	the discussion was mostly before the preview
2004-11-12T06:19:00.000Z	jdub	noda	no
2004-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	jdub	noda	try it.
2004-11-12T06:54:00.000Z	noda	jdub	Hrm... how often does this RSS thingy update? Maybe it is cool ;)
2004-11-12T07:06:00.000Z	jdub	noda	no, zvt was difficult to read (codewise) and didn't do i18n/utf-8 or a11y.
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	noda	jdub	Ah. I knew it was hopeless :)
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	jdub	noda	it wasn't.
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	noda	jdub	Do you think vte could be optimized?
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	jdub	noda	sure.
2004-11-19T15:57:00.000Z	jdub	noda	if you're comfortable running a debian sid system, and you know how to fix one when it breaks, hoary will be only slightly more challenging.
2004-11-21T06:49:00.000Z	jdub	noda	using hoary?
2004-11-21T06:54:00.000Z	noda	jdub	Thanks for your help. Later :)
