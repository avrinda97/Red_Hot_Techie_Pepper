2005-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	djp		does anyone know why when i try to encode mp3's with audacity the output is a silent file of 0kbs?
2005-06-10T07:39:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	Audacity asks for libmp3lame.so - has Audacity asked you where to find the library?
2005-06-10T07:39:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	yes, have located that
2005-06-10T07:40:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	It's a pain, but try saving from Audacity to .wav, and then using lame to encode it to mp3.
2005-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	is this a known issue then with audacity? also have i installed the right packages by installing lame-dev and lame0?
2005-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	not to my knowledge. I use Audacity pretty frequently, and have no trouble after telling it where to find lib for lame.
2005-06-10T07:42:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	I could md5sum my libmp3lame.so for you, to see if it matches yours if you like...
2005-06-10T07:42:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	it appears to make a noise when i play the encoded mp3 but not the sound it should make!
2005-06-10T07:42:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	sure. please do.
2005-06-10T07:43:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	20ac32cd0185cca0c104caefb6e0fb3e  /usr/local/lib/libmp3lame.so
2005-06-10T07:43:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	is that version 3.96.1?
2005-06-10T07:44:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	yes. 3.96.1
2005-06-10T07:44:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	do u think a restart of my machine would help?
2005-06-10T07:44:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	same version as mine
2005-06-10T07:44:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	Gnome has fixed itself by a restart of the machine now and then. But I don't see why a library would act the same. Worth a shot, I guess.
2005-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	k. thanks anyway
2005-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	just to check... lame-dev and lame0 r the only packages in need right?
2005-06-10T07:46:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	I'm not 100% on that one... but having the -dev pkg always helps.
2005-06-10T07:46:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	sorry... liblame0 and liblame-dev are the packages i have installed
2005-06-10T07:48:00.000Z	djp	tchmnky	could you email me a copy of your .so file, just so i could try it?
2005-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	tchmnky	djp	sure... /msg me the address.
