2006-10-27T14:40:00.000Z	Mirro		anyone who knows Beryl??
2006-10-27T14:40:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	i used beryl for a while
2006-10-27T14:40:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	i don't reccomend using it though, its still in a very early stage
2006-10-27T14:40:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	but what's your question?
2006-10-27T14:41:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	yea i know, i experience it now )) after installing xgl I cant change my layout with normal tool
2006-10-27T14:41:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	Xgl is evil on top of that lol
2006-10-27T14:41:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	I change it, but qwerty keeps staying....
2006-10-27T14:42:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	and first everything worked, but after a reboot Beryl manager doesnt work and so does Theme manager
2006-10-27T14:43:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	oh, hrm keyboard stuff almost makes me think it might be Xgl's fault, which further proves my point that Xgl is evil lol
2006-10-27T14:44:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	any ideas to solve this prob?
2006-10-27T14:44:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	what video card do you have?
2006-10-27T14:45:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	ati mobility x600. the point is, that everything worked b4
2006-10-27T14:46:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	before beryl? or before Xgl? or both?
2006-10-27T14:47:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	before rebooting beryl worked
2006-10-27T14:48:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	so beryl isnt working? i added start-beryl-manager to my session's startup programs, is that what you did?
2006-10-27T14:48:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	might wanna try that
2006-10-27T14:49:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	whats not working about beryl though?
2006-10-27T14:52:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	the Theme changed to something without title bar (could be a engine error mb) and theme manager doesnt change anything. now if i even start Beryl manager to do some changes manually, it doesnt work.
2006-10-27T14:53:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	#beryl, i had that problem, i'm pretty sure it had to do with the composite extension not being enabled properly
2006-10-27T14:55:00.000Z	Mirro	Ademan_	thx
2006-10-27T14:55:00.000Z	Ademan_	Mirro	no problem, good luck
