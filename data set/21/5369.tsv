2007-10-30T04:01:00.000Z	fanin		after doing a memory test for an hour, and checking for overheat (wich is not a prob.) the gutsy OS now restarts every time i log in, right after typing the passwd, wich means i cant do anything.. should i reinstall ubuntu or is there an other way to solve this problem???
2007-10-30T04:02:00.000Z	kandinski	fanin	I had X restarting all the time because of bad videocard/screen configuration
2007-10-30T04:03:00.000Z	fanin	kandinski	what do you mean by X? ..i'm a noob :/
2007-10-30T04:05:00.000Z	kandinski	fanin	the system is one thing, and the windowing system is another thing
2007-10-30T04:05:00.000Z	kandinski		X is the windowing system
2007-10-30T04:05:00.000Z	kandinski		I think only your X is rebooting
2007-10-30T04:05:00.000Z	kandinski		look down and left, options or something, and try the gnome failsafe session
2007-10-30T04:06:00.000Z	fanin		will try
2007-10-30T04:06:00.000Z	kandinski	fanin	can you see it?
2007-10-30T04:06:00.000Z	fanin		wait, need to start ubuntu again
2007-10-30T04:08:00.000Z	fanin	kandinski	remote login via XDMCP, is that it?
2007-10-30T04:08:00.000Z	kandinski	fanin	no
2007-10-30T04:08:00.000Z	kandinski		it is gnome failsafe
2007-10-30T04:08:00.000Z	kandinski		should say that
2007-10-30T04:08:00.000Z	fanin		oh
2007-10-30T04:10:00.000Z	fanin	kandinski	all it says is "select language", "select session","remote login via XDMCP","restart","shut down" and "suspend"
2007-10-30T04:12:00.000Z	kandinski		select session
2007-10-30T04:12:00.000Z	kandinski		there you will find the failsafe gnome session
2007-10-30T04:14:00.000Z	fanin	kandinski	ah, select session->failsafe gnome.. found it :)
2007-10-30T04:16:00.000Z	fanin	kandinski	still restarts :(
2007-10-30T04:17:00.000Z	kandinski	fanin	sorry, cant help
