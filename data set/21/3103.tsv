2009-05-02T03:45:00.000Z	benste1		what does: "iwl3945: Radio Frequency Kill Switch is On: Kill switch must be turned off for wireless networking to work." mean?
2009-05-02T03:46:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	it usually means that you have a button on your computer that enables wifi and is currently set to "off"
2009-05-02T03:47:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	thanks yes I have a button but did change it in this moent, for the full log please see: http://paste.ubuntu.com/162509/
2009-05-02T03:52:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	have you a clue for my problem? http://paste.ubuntu.com/162509/
2009-05-02T03:52:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	you may have to turn your wireless on before Ubuntu boots
2009-05-02T03:54:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	it's turned on before boot, it just seems to fall out from time to time while using it
2009-05-02T03:55:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	you may also have to create an options.conf file in /etc/modprobe.d that contains a line with the name of your wireless driver module and 'rf_kill=0'
2009-05-02T04:18:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	this piece of f... s... disconnected againsoundray, this piece of f... s... disconnected again
2009-05-02T04:19:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	don't let your frustration ruin your good manners.
2009-05-02T04:19:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	so do you have any other clue?
2009-05-02T04:19:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	there might be other options to the iwl3945 driver that might help
2009-05-02T04:20:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	I still think that rfkill=1 or rfkill=0 might help (or it might be rf_kill)
2009-05-02T04:21:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	so the /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf should be changed again?
2009-05-02T04:21:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	actually it's neither: check modinfo iwl3945, it's 'disable=0'
2009-05-02T04:22:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	yes, that's where you feed options to the driver.
2009-05-02T04:22:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	: should I first delete your previous attemp?
2009-05-02T04:23:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	you can do that, or try a combination of options
2009-05-02T04:24:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	I'm sorry but this is far to complex for me ;-)
2009-05-02T04:24:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	that's just a self-limiting belief you are holding ;)
2009-05-02T04:26:00.000Z	benste1	soundray	ok thanks for your help to this point, but it has gone late now maybe I'll come back later days to fix the issue
2009-05-02T04:27:00.000Z	soundray	benste1	okay, good luck
