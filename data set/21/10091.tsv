2005-10-20T12:09:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i'm having a problem doing an upgrade with apt-get, and openoffice2 is the problem.  how can i remove open office forcibly?
2005-10-20T12:11:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		 openoffice.org-l10n-en depends on openoffice.org (>> 1.1.4+1.1.5) | language-support-en; however:
2005-10-20T12:11:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	apt-get -f install
2005-10-20T12:12:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	that didn't help either.
2005-10-20T12:12:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	what did it say?
2005-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	did you use Synaptic
2005-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	no
2005-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	you mean adept?
2005-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	no synptic
2005-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	it is a gui for apt-get
2005-10-20T12:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	i thought the new name was adept.
2005-10-20T12:15:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	maybe
2005-10-20T12:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	in breezy it's called adept right?
2005-10-20T12:15:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	mine says Synapic Package manager
2005-10-20T12:17:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	it might be
2005-10-20T12:17:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	dpgk-r won't remove that one package because others ned them to run
2005-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	 then it should remove everything that needs it.
2005-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	when it says other program depend on it
2005-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	you have to add them to the command line as well
2005-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	eob84	BROKEN_LADDER	like dpkg -r pkg1 pkg2 pkg3
2005-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	eob84	it's cool now.
