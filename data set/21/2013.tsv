2010-02-14T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 in the config menus.
2010-02-14T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 system -> config -> keyboard settings
2010-02-14T10:42:00.000Z	freeaks	Dr_Willis	thanks for the answer
2010-02-14T10:43:00.000Z	freeaks	Dr_Willis	thanks it seems to work .. i have no idea why xset doesn't work though
2010-02-14T10:45:00.000Z	freeaks	Dr_Willis	well gfx stuff , like menus, used to never work or didn't provide as much option or flexibility as the command line, so i got used to do stuffs directly in the command line
2010-02-14T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 gnome is overriding the X settings i imagine.
2010-03-06T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 yes its possible
2010-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	freeaks	Dr_Willis	 how can i do that?
2010-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 lubuntu  i found goofed thigns up worse then most.  lubuntu-desktop package removed network manager and installed wicd. so that may be an issue
2010-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 i just tend to install and leave them installed.
2010-03-06T11:03:00.000Z	freeaks	Dr_Willis	 my question is specificaly about removing unused things .. i know installing another desktop is easy ..
2010-03-06T11:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freeaks	 the way meta-packages work. it can be a hassle finding EVERYTHING that may get installed.
