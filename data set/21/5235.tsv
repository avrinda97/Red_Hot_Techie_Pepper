2008-01-14T06:55:00.000Z	clearzen	mengzihan	Add more RAM to your system
2008-01-14T06:57:00.000Z	mengzihan	clearzen	my computer has only one memory slot.I bought another memory,but it can't run
2008-01-14T06:59:00.000Z	clearzen	mengzihan	to run a virtual system smoothly you would need more total RAM than 512MB available on your  system. at least a GB maybe more.
2008-01-14T07:02:00.000Z	mengzihan	clearzen	oh,looked like I will go to buy an memory ticket again.
