2011-07-15T18:10:00.000Z	Wouter_		I installed the OS (ubuntu, alternate cd) made a software raid, it installed fine but now i start to the Grub, any ideas? I think the grub cannot find the kernel (wich is on the array)
2011-07-15T18:11:00.000Z	rallias	Wouter_	Boot into a live cd and do the grub scan...
2011-07-15T18:11:00.000Z	Wouter_	rallias	how do i do the grub scan ?

2011-07-15T18:13:00.000Z	Wouter_		thank you :)
2011-07-15T18:14:00.000Z	rallias	Wouter_	Yep
2011-07-15T18:14:00.000Z	rallias	Wouter_	It SHOULD detect... I'm not 100% sure tho... I don't know anything about software raids
2011-07-15T18:15:00.000Z	Wouter_	rallias	after i boot in the live cd i get a partition availible wich i called boot, but theres only one map called Lost & Found on it
2011-07-15T18:15:00.000Z	rallias	Wouter_	Look under /dev/mapper
2011-07-15T18:17:00.000Z	Wouter_	rallias	i only see control.txt
2011-07-15T18:17:00.000Z	Wouter_	rallias	i can see my Array too however
2011-07-15T18:17:00.000Z	Wouter_	rallias	but i cant mount it, i need mdma for it , doesnt come with the live cd
2011-07-15T18:18:00.000Z	Wouter_		but im sure that would mount fine and i'd find /boot on it
2011-07-15T18:18:00.000Z	rallias		wouter_ sudo apt-get install mdma?
2011-07-15T18:18:00.000Z	Wouter_		where is grub supposed to be? i think it's on the mbr but not accesable on the array or something
2011-07-15T18:19:00.000Z	rallias		ronbc its prt screen
2011-07-15T18:19:00.000Z	Wouter_	rallias	ill try that, thanks :)
