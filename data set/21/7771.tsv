2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	holycow		jus try to get anything ibm with linux on it outside of redhat / suse and some contract
2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	holycow		its a joke
2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	holycow		i deal with ibm
2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	holycow		i'm totally correct to be dismissive
2006-12-23T14:05:00.000Z	holycow		their vendor support for desktop level things is windows only, you won't find anyone that has a clue about linux
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	holycow		i've yet to see a way to order one online
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	holycow		i don't even know what # to call to order an hp laptop withubuntu
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	holycow		but thats not even the issue
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	holycow		one shouldn't buy a brand
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	holycow		you haveto buy for the chipset, because eventually you will be supporting your self and you need a supported chipset
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	xipietotec	holycow	unfortunately, laptops are brand ridden
2006-12-23T14:07:00.000Z	holycow	xipietotec	right thats why you don't buy 'hp' you google and find out what model has what chipset
2006-12-23T14:07:00.000Z	xipietotec	holycow	oh, absolutely, although you can also go to emperorlinux.com and buy laptops preconfigured and whatnot
2006-12-23T14:08:00.000Z	holycow	xipietotec	right that probably is the best way
2006-12-23T14:40:00.000Z	holycow	xipietotec	thats a piece of junk
2006-12-23T14:40:00.000Z	xipietotec	holycow	I hadn't tried running it yet
2006-12-23T14:41:00.000Z	holycow	xipietotec	its java based garbage ... give it a whirl but it will never be adopetd by anyone in the general set of linux distributions
2006-12-23T14:41:00.000Z	holycow	xipietotec	we have at least 2 other implemenations, xgl and aiglx that are superior and have hardware vendor support
2006-12-23T14:42:00.000Z	xipietotec	holycow	I'm aware of that, thought I might check the java one out though....I actually think Java is going to be important for developing interoperable apps...much as I like python, there are more java developers, and java is on more non PC platforms
2006-12-23T14:43:00.000Z	holycow	xipietotec	oh yeah of course.  :) fun right?  java is very important in that area already, its the defining reason its used *nod*
2006-12-23T14:45:00.000Z	xipietotec	holycow	which is why it's OMGWTFBBQAWESOME that Java is now GPL'd.
