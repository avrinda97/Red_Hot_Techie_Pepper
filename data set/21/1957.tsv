2010-03-11T06:28:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	  ehehe  lamp?     well, you already have the 'L', install Apache2 and that gives you the 'A' and 'P', install mysql and that gives the 'M'
2010-03-11T06:29:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	well i don't know how to install AMP...yes i have L
2010-03-11T06:32:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	  ehehe  lamp?     well, you already have the 'L', install Apache2 and that gives you the 'A' and 'P', install mysql and that gives the 'M'    <----   sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server-5.0
2010-03-11T06:32:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	 and php???
2010-03-11T06:33:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	    Apache webserver already comes with PHP as module, don't need to add anything extra, and also has mysql modules for accessing the server
2010-03-11T06:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	    thus it gives you the 'a' and 'p'
2010-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	thank you...long live the king! :)
2010-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	  <voice type="elvis">  thank you, thank you very much </voice>
2010-03-11T06:36:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	 :))) ahahhahahahha you made my day!
2010-03-12T05:30:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	  sorry, no familiar with such yet... .maybe you want to elaborate more on how and when it exactly happens, for others to be able to help, 'does not work' isn't really explainful, and there's a lack of clarivoyancy in the channel ^_^
2010-03-12T05:31:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	I have configured my pppoe with sudo pppoeconf...sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't...if i type plog in the terminal something strange is there...maybe this can help you guys...
2010-03-12T05:32:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	serial link appears to be disconnected/connection terminated.modem hangup/ (so it gives me the connection time...anything works great and then when my internet goes down and i plog i see this.)
2010-03-12T05:35:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	  sorry, no familiar with such yet :(
2010-03-12T05:38:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	ehh it's ok. thanks anyway! :)
2010-03-16T03:20:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	 Hey typos the bash script you gave me doesn't start conky everytime i login
2010-03-16T03:22:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	  hehe, can't say... I don't use conky :|
2010-03-16T03:24:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	 well that's ok i will still look for a way to auto start conky every time. Did you had a todo list program on your ubuntu machine? I cross on a problem with it...as you can see above.
2010-03-16T03:27:00.000Z	Typos_King	serverduck	   there are several spots where to start something upon boot.. if that helps
2010-03-16T03:28:00.000Z	serverduck	Typos_King	 thanks
