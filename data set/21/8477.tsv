2007-02-23T15:39:00.000Z	iGadget		hi
2007-02-23T15:40:00.000Z	iGadget		I'm trying to install edgy next to my dapper install, and I'd like to re-use my existing /boot partition
2007-02-23T15:40:00.000Z	iGadget		but now the installer comes with this:
2007-02-23T15:40:00.000Z	iGadget		Filesystems used by the system (/, /boot, /usr, /var) must be reformatted for use by this installer. Other filesystems (/home, /media/*, /usr/local, etc.) may be used without reformatting.
2007-02-23T15:40:00.000Z	iGadget		_why_ does the edgy installer need to format /boot?
2007-02-23T15:41:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	it does? I didn't even create a /boot partition
2007-02-23T15:41:00.000Z	iGadget	mwe	I did, because I want to use XFS as the root filesystem
2007-02-23T15:42:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	I had the option of choosing to format each partition or leave the file sytem
2007-02-23T15:43:00.000Z	iGadget	mwe	me as well, but when I de-selected the /boot partition, it came up with the error msg I just pasted above
2007-02-23T15:43:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	I think i missed that

2007-02-23T15:43:00.000Z	iGadget		this msg :)
2007-02-23T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	odd
2007-02-23T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	report a bug. that's annoying
2007-02-23T15:44:00.000Z	iGadget	mwe	yes, especially since feisty didn't complain about htis
2007-02-23T15:44:00.000Z	iGadget	mwe	I guess I will :)
2007-02-23T15:45:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	a work around would be to back up the data and restore it when it's done. but it sure sounds annoying
2007-02-23T15:46:00.000Z	iGadget	mwe	that was exactly the question I'd want to ask you... do you think that will work?
2007-02-23T15:46:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	yeah. because the installer will install a kernel and grub and make you able to boot that. so I defenately think it would work
2007-02-23T15:47:00.000Z	iGadget	mwe	allright, I'll try that then. Thanks!
2007-02-23T15:47:00.000Z	mwe	iGadget	you're welcome
