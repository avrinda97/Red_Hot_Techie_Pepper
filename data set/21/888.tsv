2012-06-02T02:55:00.000Z	escott	twig11	the images are in /usr/share/wallpapers, the selected option is in gconf/dcond
2012-06-02T02:56:00.000Z	twig11	escott	Can you explain how to access that option? I think I've edited dconf once before sometime but I don't remember how.
2012-06-02T02:56:00.000Z	escott	twig11	why not set the background throught the appearance tool
2012-06-02T02:57:00.000Z	twig11	escott	I'm trying to find a way to make user-selected wallpapers show up as the unity-greeter background by default.
2012-06-02T02:58:00.000Z	escott	twig11	i think it does that with 12.04
2012-06-02T02:59:00.000Z	escott	twig11	if you know how to disable that i would appreciate knowing how
2012-06-02T02:59:00.000Z	twig11	escott	The only way I know to do this now is to manually drop the desired wallpaper into /usr/share/wallpapers, set permissions correctly, and then apply it as a desktop background. As far as I know, only the default selection of wallpapers will show in unity-greeter.
2012-06-02T03:00:00.000Z	twig11	escott	now you've got me second-guessing. Let me check
2012-06-02T03:06:00.000Z	twig11	escott	I just selected a photo from ~/Pictures, gave others read/write permissions, set it as the wallpaper through the Appearance preference pane, and it doesn't show up on unity-greeter. Any of the bundled wallpapers do, but no others, UNLESS first dropped into /usr/share/wallpapers and their owner changed to root.
2012-06-02T03:07:00.000Z	escott	twig11	thats certainly desirable. you dont want random peoples contents of $HOME being shown prior to their logging in
2012-06-02T03:11:00.000Z	twig11	escott	I understand the drawbacks of that but if users WANT to show off their wallpapers, as several on this machine do, I would like to know how to set the behavior. It's not like it's random information either, since it's something that will show any time the user is actually logged in. Anyway, maybe I'll phrase this as a new question and see if I get any bites.
2012-06-02T03:12:00.000Z	escott	twig11	obviously this wont work if they have an encrypted home
2012-06-02T03:27:00.000Z	escott	twig11	you should never overestimate your users. some idiot is going to figure out a way to make a background image of all their passwords
2012-06-02T03:29:00.000Z	escott	twig11	thats one of the things that drives me CRAZY with lightdm. they are constantly doing things to make it splashier without (a) notification and (b) a way to disable it. I dont care if my [boot manager|boot framebuffer|login screen] is pretty or not.
2012-06-02T03:30:00.000Z	twig11	escott	:-) If they did that AFTER knowing the greeter's behavior, they might deserve the consequences. But I understand the point.
2012-06-02T03:31:00.000Z	escott	twig11	except its not their consequences. its your consequences. you are evidently the admin of that system, and are ultimately responsible for the security of it. so now you have to establish a policy that says "you may not use or create backgrounds that contain sensitive information"
2012-06-02T03:32:00.000Z	twig11	escott	actually, for someone like me who is interested in getting friends and family to take ubuntu seriously in order to wean them off windows, pretty is important. First impressions matter.
2012-06-02T03:32:00.000Z	escott	twig11	a more realistic scenario might be somebody deciding to make their background a render or blueprint of some unreleased company product
2012-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	escott	twig11	yeah but lightdm has been out for over 6 months now, and we STILL cannot prevent it from showing usernames
2012-06-02T03:36:00.000Z	twig11	escott	Yeah, I'm pretty much convinced on the point about arbitrary user-selected backgrounds after thinking about it. The admin can always introduce another directory for more options if people want it.
2012-06-02T03:37:00.000Z	twig11	escott	And I agree that they really should make the greeter more configurable.
