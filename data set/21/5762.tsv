2008-05-04T03:02:00.000Z	dampit07		has anyone had issues installing 8.04 on vista
2008-05-04T03:04:00.000Z	dampit07		is there a place where i can download ubuntu 7.04 cause 8.04 will not install on my hp pravilion at all
2008-05-04T03:05:00.000Z	Simonft	dampit07	I mean the other way around
2008-05-04T03:07:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	i dont know, it could be that i got a bad copy of 8.04...but it will load the menu to install and just freeze at the menu, and when i try to install it using wubi as just a file in my computer it doesnt show up when i restart my computer
2008-05-04T03:10:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	its an HP Pravilion 9410us
2008-05-04T03:12:00.000Z	Simonft	dampit07	try burning another dvd
2008-05-04T03:13:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	and i have a copy of 7.04 that i put in my computer and restarted.  It started to install, but  because my cd is scratched to hell...it errored out
2008-05-04T03:17:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	i burn all my iso's to cd at the highest, slowest quality that i can for maximum efficiency
2008-05-04T03:17:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	see i have no issue downloading and reburning 7.04 and then just upgrading...since i know that 7.04 works on this computer
2008-05-04T03:18:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	well i guess i will just download the 8.04 again...
2008-05-04T20:54:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	hey you do you remember me?
2008-05-04T20:55:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	I was the one that couldnt get 8.04 to install and was asking for 7.04 cause i knew it would install with 7.04
2008-05-04T20:57:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	nope, i downloaded 8.04 two times from different places, and burned it twice, neither time worked
2008-05-04T20:58:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	it is a hp privilion dv9410us.  im trying it one last time right now with installing it in windows to see if it will work one last time before i do anything else, but i just wanted to get a head start and see if you where on in case it didnt work so we could find out another route of doing it
2008-05-04T21:02:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	brb i gotta restart to see if it worked
2008-05-04T21:02:00.000Z	Simonft	dampit07	http://ge.ubuntuforums.com/showthread.php?s=9d90575407518bd53924339c293e5b6c&t=512059 you could be in for a long install, but install 7.04 with the how to and then upgrade
2008-05-04T21:25:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	back, didnt work
2008-05-04T21:28:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	im using the 8.04 iso that i got off of the ubuntu website, it wont even boot into the live cd
2008-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	yep, im going to download 7.04 right now and then install and update, updating shouldnt take me long, im runnin off of a 10MB connection, soon to be a 16MB connection
2008-05-04T21:33:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	 my friend brought over the alternate cd and it didnt work either, im over at my friends house and his dad is a computer technition and a computer programmer and he still is confused as to why it wont work
2008-05-04T21:36:00.000Z	dampit07	Simonft	yeah im thinking about it, where do i file a bug, and how would i sign up for being a beta tester for their upcoming additions/cds
