2012-11-22T20:36:00.000Z	Eagleman		I am trying to transfer our CVS program to another machine, but i am having problems with importing the passwd file. it just refuses to read it and so it only allows the user root
2012-11-22T20:37:00.000Z	ccsteale	Eagleman	you'll need to change the ownership of the file
2012-11-22T20:37:00.000Z	ccsteale	Eagleman	or if the program only needs to read the file run the command chmod 755 <filename>
2012-11-22T20:38:00.000Z	Eagleman		-rwxr-xr-x   1 root Software       403 Sep 27 07:42 passwd
2012-11-22T20:38:00.000Z	ccsteale		is the software running as the software user?
2012-11-22T20:39:00.000Z	Eagleman		cvsd      1134  0.0  0.1   1736   480 ?        SNs  Nov16   0:00 /usr/sbin/cvsd -f /etc/cvsd/cvsd.conf
2012-11-22T20:39:00.000Z	ccsteale	Eagleman	in shell, run the command whoami
2012-11-22T20:40:00.000Z	Eagleman		well i am logged in as root
2012-11-22T20:40:00.000Z	Eagleman		so i am root
2012-11-22T20:40:00.000Z	ccsteale		ahh okay, is the config file pointing at the correct file? sounds like a location issue rather than permissions
2012-11-22T20:41:00.000Z	Eagleman		CVSROOT is in /cvs/CVSROOT
2012-11-22T20:43:00.000Z	Eagleman	ccsteale	on our other server i see this when ps aux | grep cvs
2012-11-22T20:43:00.000Z	Eagleman		10089     9090 18.5  0.0   2732   900 ?        Ss   16:43   0:00 cvs server
2012-11-22T20:43:00.000Z	Eagleman		10089     9091 34.5  0.0   2736   872 ?        R    16:43   0:00 cvs server
2012-11-22T20:44:00.000Z	ccsteale	Eagleman	can you paste the exact command and error in http://www.dpaste.org/ so i cant take a look
2012-11-22T20:44:00.000Z	Eagleman		WHich command?
2012-11-22T20:44:00.000Z	ccsteale		the command your running to start the cvs application where you reported it wont read the password file
2012-11-22T20:45:00.000Z	Eagleman		Thats the problem cvs is so vague, i dont even know how i started it. its not working like a normal deamon
2012-11-22T20:46:00.000Z	ccsteale		on the orignal server can you login as root and run history? hopefully that might tell you how you initially got it started
2012-11-22T20:47:00.000Z	Eagleman	ccsteale	its like 5 years old or even more, history wont help me :(
2012-11-22T20:51:00.000Z	ccsteale	Eagleman	on the old/current server where cvs is running do ps -f
