2011-10-16T23:45:00.000Z	BlueWolf		Could someone help? I have recently been given a printer ( Lexmark 2200 series ) and I can get it to work on my Ubuntu 10.10. I have tryed the printer manager and it failed to find anything.
2011-10-16T23:45:00.000Z	BlueWolf		Anyone?
2011-10-16T23:45:00.000Z	Ibis	BlueWolf	Ubuntu version you're using now?
2011-10-16T23:46:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Ibis	Ubuntu 10.10.
2011-10-16T23:47:00.000Z	Ibis	BlueWolf	"and I can get it to work on my Ubuntu 10.10" <------------ Get the printer to work, what more do you want to do now? Is it an ALL-IN-ONE type?
2011-10-16T23:50:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Ibis	It is a printer as well as a scanner. And I have tried every way I know to get the drivers and I have failed, so do you have any other suggestions?

2011-10-16T23:57:00.000Z	Ibis	BlueWolf	I couldn't find your model there. It might had been an x2500, the closet I found :S
2011-10-16T23:58:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Ibis	Ok sorry about pestering you. The model is X2250
