2009-01-23T21:24:00.000Z	phixxor		can you use gparted to fix ntfs partitions?
2009-01-23T21:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	no, not that i know of. i don't think there is any native linux app to 'fix' the ntfs filesystem
2009-01-23T21:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	oops, my bad.. partitions? hmmm, i'm not sure, maybe
2009-01-23T21:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	let's look at the man page, and in /usr/share docs shall we?
2009-01-23T21:26:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	well, heh windows is unbootable now; I just thought I'd prefer using a linux tool to fix it than the windows recovery disk
2009-01-23T21:26:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	heh, yeah
2009-01-23T21:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	what happened? i looked at the man page for 'parted' just now.. it doesn't mention 'ntfs' partitions.. however, i'm not sure a windows partition would really be referred to as an ntfs partition, so, i haven't given up hope yet
2009-01-23T21:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	upon further inspection, it does mention ntfs partitions!
2009-01-23T21:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	so what has happened? why did it quit booting for you?
2009-01-23T21:31:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	sorry for the delay -- I was playing a game, got a blue screen, and now my computer won't boot -- unreadable_boot_volume
2009-01-23T21:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	dang... sounds nasty. sorry to hear that!
2009-01-23T21:32:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	yeah. I hope it's not a hardware issue
2009-01-24T01:12:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	hey, turns out the bios got corrupted somehow
2009-01-24T01:13:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	what even causes that?
2009-01-24T01:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	whoa! set it all back to defaults or something?
2009-01-24T01:13:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	no, it means the bios doesn't appear when I boot. I'd either have to hotflash it or get a new motherboard
2009-01-24T01:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	i don't know... power flucuation(surge/droop)
2009-01-24T01:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	?
2009-01-24T01:14:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	I turn the computer on and I get nothing, unless I hold the home key which takes me to a ghost bios utility that tries to flash the bios, but fails at the end
2009-01-24T01:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	phixxor	your mb might be fried if the bios nvram is shot
2009-01-24T01:16:00.000Z	phixxor	onetinsoldier	yeah
