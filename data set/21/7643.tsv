2006-10-07T06:29:00.000Z	dmglouis		can anyone help me? I've been trying to get my ubuntu box to connect to my router hours without any success
2006-10-07T06:30:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	does 'sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning' see your router? or eth1 or whatever
2006-10-07T06:31:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	ifconfig will list your network devices
2006-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	well im connecting through wire
2006-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	yes, it will list unconnected ones too
2006-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	yes I have 2: eth0 and lo
2006-10-07T06:33:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	then you don't have the driver for your wireless installed
2006-10-07T06:33:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	what wireless? I dont have wireless
2006-10-07T06:33:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	sorry, I assumed wireless when you said router
2006-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	np
2006-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	do you have an inet addr listed next to eth0?
2006-10-07T06:35:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	yes, its 192.168.2.132
2006-10-07T06:35:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	type route
2006-10-07T06:35:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	well that should show your default gateway
2006-10-07T06:36:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	and the mask is 0.0.0.0
2006-10-07T06:36:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	i thought its supposed to be 255.255.255.0
2006-10-07T06:36:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	Genmask, on gateway is correct
2006-10-07T06:36:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	it is?
2006-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	yes, that's what mine is showing, I can log into my router fine at the address that shows on that line
2006-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	dmglouis	anto9us	oh ok
2006-10-07T06:43:00.000Z	anto9us	dmglouis	did you manage to get into it?
