2005-04-04T15:17:00.000Z	CoRzA		Hey guys I'm having a problem with my screen resolution it's set to 60hz and i cant change it
2005-04-04T15:18:00.000Z	KarlosII	CoRzA	u need to make sure you know FOR absolutely certain that your monitor can support it and add modelines to xorg
2005-04-04T15:18:00.000Z	CoRzA		i am absolutely sure
2005-04-04T15:19:00.000Z	CoRzA	KarlosII	it is supported up to about 85hz but i usually run it at 75hz fine
2005-04-04T15:19:00.000Z	CoRzA	KarlosII	(in windows anyway)
2005-04-04T15:19:00.000Z	KarlosII	CoRzA	u could use a livecd like Kanotix and copy the XFree86Config-4
2005-04-04T15:19:00.000Z	KarlosII		to your harddrive and then copy the modelines from there
2005-04-04T15:20:00.000Z	KarlosII		I plan on doing that when I have some time
2005-04-04T15:20:00.000Z	CoRzA		oh ok - wouldnt it be easier to somehow edit it?
2005-04-04T15:20:00.000Z	KarlosII		I need to to gte mine upto 100, 21 inch is too big for 85
2005-04-04T15:20:00.000Z	KarlosII	CoRzA	well my way might be faster :)
