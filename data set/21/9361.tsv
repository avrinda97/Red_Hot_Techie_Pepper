2005-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	You have knoppix?
2005-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	and you want to install Ubuntu on three machines?
2005-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	okay, that's very easy.
2005-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	How good are you with linux?
2005-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	you'll need to understand grub to do this. It's not hard, but I'm at work and I can't talk you through it.
2005-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	Okay. On knoppix, you have fdisk
2005-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	Use fdisk to partition the disks.
2005-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	then, use debootstrap to build an ubuntu distro on the disks.
2005-11-01T15:56:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	after that, chroot into the new distro, install a kernel and configure Grub
2005-11-01T15:56:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	there's information on doing all of that online
2005-11-01T15:57:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	I just did.
2005-11-01T15:57:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	be calm, and read what I said again.
2005-11-01T15:58:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	Debootstrap is the tool which ubuntu and debian use to build installs. It'll give you a very minimal environment, but everything needed to install more stuff
2005-11-01T15:58:00.000Z	ccooke	Quarupted	you can pull the ubuntu deb from the ubuntu archive
