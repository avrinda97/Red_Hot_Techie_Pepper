2008-03-21T02:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	sure i t is, not a very good one, but its an alternative.
2008-03-21T02:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	if you like the ease of use of ubuntu, you could look at either LinuxMint, or a Debian Etch install.
2008-03-21T02:40:00.000Z	c3f59d4	IndyGunFreak	whats the thing about knoppix? is it as reduced as DSL?
2008-03-21T02:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	i just don't like it... KDE, slow, didn't care for it.
2008-03-21T02:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	not reduced though, has a ton of apps ready to go.
2008-03-21T02:44:00.000Z	c3f59d4	IndyGunFreak	butif it is slow it is no good. already ubuntu is not lightweight for the book
2008-03-21T02:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	what is the speed of this pc?
2008-03-21T02:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	what are the specifications of the pC you're running
2008-03-21T02:47:00.000Z	c3f59d4	IndyGunFreak	wait ill look up the specs
2008-03-21T02:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	ij'
2008-03-21T02:56:00.000Z	c3f59d4	IndyGunFreak	DRebellion: is there a way to make the videocard share some of the system RAM?
2008-03-21T02:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	i would run fluxbuntu on that if i were you.
2008-03-21T02:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	is that  apC or laptop?
2008-03-21T02:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	use fluxbuntu.
2008-03-21T02:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	well i imagine Fluxbuntu will runfine on that machine
2008-03-21T02:53:00.000Z	c3f59d4	IndyGunFreak	definitly the VRAM, windows tend to build up in 5 seconds when its busy
2008-03-21T02:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	but you have plenty of Ram, hard drive space, etc.
2008-03-21T02:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	hmm, maybe, but i think that would be a bios option
2008-03-21T02:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	c3f59d4	if you bump up the memory, you might be able to run a traditional gnome/kde enviro
