2010-06-05T18:05:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	set your bios to boot from CD first
2010-06-05T18:07:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	do you have windoze or ubuntu on that DVD ;)
2010-06-05T18:08:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	has that windoze xp boot disk ever worked on any other pc/laptop before this?
2010-06-05T18:08:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	ofcourse, on my previous notebook.
2010-06-05T18:09:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	is the DVD drive ok on this notebook?
2010-06-05T18:19:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	its an old Windoze installation bug; you need to enable writing on boot record in the BIOS otherwise it wont work
2010-06-05T18:20:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	I will try :)
2010-06-05T18:28:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	You said that I have to enable "boot record" or what, right? I opened BIOS and there is not any option like that, so I enabled Quick Boot, but the problem repeats.
2010-06-05T18:29:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	in older BIOSes, there used to be an option to prevent writing to boot sector and Windoze used to complain. I dont know if it is available on yours
2010-06-05T18:30:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	Can I formate disc or what from terminal? I dont need my data, just delete ALL ON DISC and then install MS Windows.
2010-06-05T18:31:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	sure, just run sudo fdisk /dev/sda and then delete all partition; create a new one, write and exit
2010-06-05T18:32:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	is there any possible problem? maybe that computer wont work at all?
2010-06-05T18:33:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	did you typed anything? I closed pidgin... (mistake) :D
2010-06-05T18:34:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	nope i didnt; but i dont think theres any problem if you did this
2010-06-05T18:34:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	then thank you very much. I will try it from terminal..
2010-06-05T18:35:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	i finally dug out the article that talks about boot sector protection in BIOS --> http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/J.Steunebrink/virwarn.htm
2010-06-05T18:36:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	if you are a newbie; dont play with fdisk; use parted or gparted
2010-06-05T18:36:00.000Z	Imro456982	phlak_user	thanks
2010-06-05T18:37:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	are you trying to delete the partitions of a running system
2010-06-05T18:40:00.000Z	phlak_user	Imro456982	you need to boot off a livecd or usb and then run gparted
