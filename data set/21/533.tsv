2011-10-21T02:40:00.000Z	graphics4me		Does anyone thing it'll be a good idea if these closed sourced graphic ccard driver makers would make an open source plugin that will natively work with any closed source binary
2011-10-21T02:41:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	That makes absolutely no sense
2011-10-21T02:41:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	What program are you trying to run?
2011-10-21T02:42:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	I'm just investing for the future of ubuntu, I want to get a nice graphic card.
2011-10-21T02:42:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	If you want supported open source drivers, select radeon
2011-10-21T02:43:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	Then you want nvidia with proprietary drivers
2011-10-21T02:46:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	Oh and what  I mentioned before as soon as I came here, I meant a program (basically, a wrapper that'll translate all graphic card capabilities & secrets into a list of features that linux  ccan see and use).
2011-10-21T02:47:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	You are sadly misunderstanding how graphics drivers work
2011-10-21T02:49:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	I just know these big companies will never want to make their drivers open source due to competition and such.  This has to be better than reverse engineering things... If they would translate all their secret stuff into a list of features that everyone would obviously know about which linux can see & just use.
2011-10-21T02:49:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	There are API's such as opengl and directX which are standards and most 3D programs use to do graphics. There is an extension set you must meet to support a particular version of said API. Some hardware simply cannot perform some of these functions. The graphics driver's responsibility is to implement and report what extensions are available for user programs to use
2011-10-21T02:50:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	On the contrary, AMD bought ATI a few years back and hired several developers to work full time on the open source radeon driver
2011-10-21T02:51:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	AMD makes it a point to release hardware specifications in a reasonable fashion so that the developers can produce better drivers, more quickly
2011-10-21T02:52:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	Intel also releases spec for their hw but their hw really isn't that great
2011-10-21T02:52:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	& msilveira: That's nice, and thanks for the info.
2011-10-21T02:52:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	nvidia is the only one not releasing hw specs for their cards and refuses to support FOSS drivers
2011-10-21T02:55:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	No, vesa is a 'catch-all/fallback' driver with no 3D acceleration for any specific device
2011-10-21T02:55:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	Ah, gothca.
2011-10-21T03:00:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	There are open drivers for all vendors. nvidia has the nvidia proprietary driver and nouveau RE'd FOSS driver. Radeon has fglrx proprietary and radeon FOSS driver. Intel only has the intel drivers, kernel modules i9xx
2011-10-21T03:04:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	& msilveira: Wow, this is such a drag, so after ubuntu is installed, theres no XCHAT on it. Noticed the decline in numbers of Ubuntu heads in here?
2011-10-21T03:06:00.000Z	soreau	graphics4me	Solution: Install xchat
2011-10-21T03:07:00.000Z	graphics4me	soreau	Thanks, but that's not my issue, I'm a regular helper here. A lot of folks running into huge upgrade related issues.
