2011-06-16T22:15:00.000Z	Anon904	RA_drc	yes it can :)
2011-06-16T22:15:00.000Z	Anon904		does it require admin privlages tensor?
2011-06-16T22:16:00.000Z	Anon904		I have downloaded and installed google chrome to their computers, so yes i can dl and install most things.
2011-06-16T22:16:00.000Z	Anon904		but when i restart the comp, its all gone cause the comp at school doesnt even have a hdd or a cd drive.. its etho booted
2011-06-16T22:17:00.000Z	RA_drc	Anon904	dr_willis: Lasers: i tried partitioning my computer and using wubi, and now all i get when i boot my computer is "j".  can ubuntu recover from that?
2011-06-16T22:17:00.000Z	Anon904	RA_drc	ACK wubi </3
2011-06-16T22:18:00.000Z	Anon904		yeah, cause if i try to even open the IE settings says blocked by admin
2011-06-16T22:19:00.000Z	Anon904		I cant even access the C: drive(even though its a fake one) inless i do some backdoor stuff. cant even go into CMD without having to do backdoor stuff.
2011-06-16T22:20:00.000Z	Anon904		haha, my into to networking teacher, has a script added to his router, so that if anyone tries to log in more than 3 times in a 24 hour period, it will send a script that will fry their processor and ram chips D:

2011-06-16T22:21:00.000Z	Anon904		what the heck? I cant access my router from this computer...192.168.1.254 doesnt do anything....
2011-06-16T22:22:00.000Z	Anon904		trying to access my router page, wont let me, saying too long for the connection...
2011-06-16T22:22:00.000Z	Anon904		just did an ifconfig, and im getting this.
2011-06-16T22:22:00.000Z	Anon904		 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:22:fb:7c:4c:38
2011-06-16T22:22:00.000Z	Anon904		          inet addr:172.16.1.34  Bcast:172.16.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
2011-06-16T22:23:00.000Z	Anon904		so i tried 172.16.1.34 and nothing..
2011-06-16T22:23:00.000Z	RA_drc	Anon904	dr_willis: Lasers: i am certain is is J, not L.  all it shows is a lowercase j.  do i want 11.04 and 32-bit?
2011-06-16T22:23:00.000Z	Anon904		ahhhh, its 172.16.0.1
2011-06-16T22:24:00.000Z	Anon904	RA_drc	how much ram you got on ur system? 2gb minimum for 64bit
2011-06-16T22:27:00.000Z	RA_drc	Anon904	dr_willis: Lasers: i have a p4, so i think i should do 32-bit.  i'm still not sure what the difference between 10.04 and 11.04 is, though
