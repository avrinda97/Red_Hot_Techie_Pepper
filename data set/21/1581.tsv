2010-07-18T06:44:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	you need to check out the ARM repositories of the ubuntu version you gonna use
2010-07-18T06:45:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	The application I am intending install needs to be available for ARM, is that right sir?
2010-07-18T06:45:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	yes. sheevaplug is an ARM based devices
2010-07-18T06:47:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	I tried the full ubuntu desktop install on my htc hd2 cell phone. must stuff was available. I was only missing a good flash plugin. but that's not ubuntu's fault. none of the free flash plugins (gnash swfdec) play back recent ubuntu stuff
2010-07-18T06:48:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	uuhh youtube stuff I mean
2010-07-18T06:50:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	Youtube stuff? I don't get you? :|
2010-07-18T06:50:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	youtube nice website to play lots of uselss videos
2010-07-18T06:51:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	you need a browser with a plugin to use flash content in order to use youtube
2010-07-18T06:51:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	such plugins for arm are bad
2010-07-18T06:53:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	what are you worried about ?
2010-07-18T06:56:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	Oh! I got it! I thought YouTube has to do something with the hardware. Yeah! absense of flash won't be a big deal.
2010-07-18T06:56:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	I just want to setup something to download some torrents and use less electricity
2010-07-18T06:57:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	well you can use flash. there's a gnash plugin for mozilla. but I had to notice most recent gnash version is incompatible with latest youtube
2010-07-18T06:57:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	well then you all set. I would recommend to use ubuntu-server rootfs then
2010-07-18T06:58:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	rtorrent nice for this
2010-07-18T06:58:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	It is specifically for ARM, I think.
2010-07-18T06:59:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	I also heard about it. But since it is fully commandline I am a bit worried.
2010-07-18T06:59:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	fairly easy to handle
2010-07-18T06:59:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	Will it support RSS feeds? If yes, I can just add it to an RSS feed and it'll automatically download
2010-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	dcordes	Agnes_Leroy	check this http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ticket/987
2010-07-18T07:12:00.000Z	Agnes_Leroy	dcordes	I think I can make it work, even if it is not supporting it out-of-the-box.
