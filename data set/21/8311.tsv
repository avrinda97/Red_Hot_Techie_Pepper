2006-05-01T09:12:00.000Z	N2DIY	SimplyFlower	here, we need to know what the hardware is!

2006-05-01T09:13:00.000Z	N2DIY	SimplyFlower	that's why a model number helps!
2006-05-01T09:21:00.000Z	N2DIY	SimplyFlower	you may want to ask your question again, with the make, model and chip info?
2006-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	N2DIY	SimplyFlower	google search for your cards make and model, and "linux module."
2006-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	N2DIY	SimplyFlower	once we find what module(driver) the card needs, we can get it to work.

2006-05-01T12:31:00.000Z	SimplyFlower	N2DIY	 no... its a generic built desktop with an AMD Athlon 550 MHz, 256 Mb ram, 2 hard drives
2006-05-01T12:44:00.000Z	SimplyFlower	N2DIY	 it has never had a linux installed, but has run PuppyLinux, and SystemRescue from the cd that uses linux and has gotten an internet connection with both.  It also has installed on it windowsXP
2006-05-01T12:47:00.000Z	N2DIY	SimplyFlower	winders is the problem, I think? It doesn't like playing with other operatig system, on the same hard drives, or even partitions.
