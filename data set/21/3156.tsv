2009-03-23T21:33:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	Just to clearify, you said yes to that if I order the CD they give both 32 and 64 bit edition?
2009-03-23T21:34:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	I get the choice when I choose server edition, but when I choose Desktop edition I can only pick how many CDs
2009-03-23T21:37:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	AMD64 bit Athalon, and AMD64-Quad Phenom (or however it's spelt)
2009-03-23T21:38:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	You're missing my question, I'm at the page https://shipit.ubuntu.com/  I choose 'request a CD of Ubuntu Desktop Edition' it does not offer me the option to pick 64-bit. If I choose server I can pick, but not Desktop for some reason
2009-03-23T21:41:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	yes, I actually alrady have done that too. I'm a computer technician and it'd be a lot better if I had actual pressed discs rather than burned ones. Also it'd look a lot more professional if I did. I only need one copy of each 64 and 32 bit versions
2009-03-23T21:43:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	I use Ubuntu (both versions) as part of my toolkit to fix computers everywhere I go. I just want to have some proper discs in my set rather than burned ones that are no garentee are burned right. Also CD-R discs are prone to corrupt in simple sunlight within minutes
2009-03-23T21:44:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	burned discs corrpt far too easily. That's why I'm after pressed discs
2009-03-23T21:45:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	it's a huge waste of time having to make Ubuntu do a disc consistancy check every time I work on a computer. I never know if the disc got corrupt, or if there's something wrong with the computer I'm working on
2009-03-23T21:46:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	it never helps if you don't know if a burned disc went corrupt or if the computer you're repairing has bad RAM/CPU/Optical Drive/etc.
2009-03-23T21:47:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	I have both desktop and laptop multi-drivers (CD/DVD combo)
2009-03-23T21:48:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	as I said, even if I burn it successfully, mere sunlight can corrupt the disc. Pressed discs don't have that flaw
2009-03-23T21:48:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	CD-R uses photosensitive ink. Pressed discs are shaped metal/plastic wafers
2009-03-23T21:49:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	'keep it out of the sun' is what I already try to do. But when you're testing computers every single day, I need to know my disc works. If the disc is corrupt I could spend days checking RAM/CPU/Drives/etc. trying to figure out why there's a boot failer
2009-03-23T21:50:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	that option only works on computers with USB 2.0!
2009-03-23T21:51:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	I work on ALL TYPES of computers. I'm a techncian. I keep trying to explain that. I work on ones with no USB, DVD-only, CD-only, only USB, etc. I have Ubuntu burned/copied in every form possible. CD is the most used by far with all computers to date
2009-03-23T21:52:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	Unlike DVD that uses crystal that resists corruption from light sources, CD-R is VERY easy to corrupt. Pressed disc is the only safe way to have CDs when doing sensitive work
2009-03-23T21:54:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	I'll have at least one disc ordered so I at least have the 32-bit edition then. I don't know why only server offers 64-bit discs. I'm also confused why you can only order the less stable 8.10 rather than 8.04LTS
2009-03-23T21:55:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	really?.. odd.. anyways thanks for the help then
2009-03-23T21:56:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	I have some work to do now
2009-03-23T21:56:00.000Z	Zair	HammerHead66	thanks for the help
