2008-05-19T23:41:00.000Z	W8TAH		hi folks -- can someone point me to the instructions for creating .deb binary packages for ubuntu?
2008-05-19T23:42:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	there's a wiki page on that issue on wiki.ubuntu.com, and the official Debian Maintainer's Guide.
2008-05-19T23:42:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	is it hard?
2008-05-19T23:43:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	well it's surely not easy for Linux novices, but not necessarily hard. I wouldn't package a library for starters though.
2008-05-19T23:43:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	why don't you take a look yourself: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide
2008-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	depending on your needs, you may also download an existing source package, modify it as you like and do some repackaging.
2008-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	especially backports are rather easy.
2008-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	im using the pidgin fork funpidgin / carrrier and id like to help them in the packaging effort for ubuntu
2008-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	have you checked http://www.getdeb.net/ too?
2008-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	no-- wasnt aware of it
2008-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	worth a try.
2008-05-19T23:47:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	there's already a funpidgin Debian .deb, right? This might be the right thing to build upon.
2008-05-19T23:48:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	its there for their initial fork - im using the latest beta called carrier
2008-05-19T23:48:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	i built it from source yesterday
2008-05-19T23:50:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	you could surely build a new package from the ground, but since there's also one, it seems better to use that.
2008-05-19T23:50:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/funpidgin/funpidgin_2.4.1-0ubuntu1_i386.deb
2008-05-19T23:51:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	is that possible because of a new branch (being the beta)
2008-05-19T23:51:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	if its possible -- i'll tackle it
2008-05-19T23:52:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	the effort depends on how different the new beta is, but especially since you're a newbie on packaging, asking the .deb maintainer for the source package could make it a lot easier for you.
2008-05-19T23:52:00.000Z	W8TAH	cosmodad	sounds good to me
2008-05-19T23:52:00.000Z	cosmodad	W8TAH	you'd only need to pick the existing source package and modify it such that the beta is build.
