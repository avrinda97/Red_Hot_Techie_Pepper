2006-09-25T10:43:00.000Z	`paul		hi, my ubuntu installation seems to always stall on "configuring apt" should i wait or is there really a prob?
2006-09-25T10:44:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	is that one of the 6 steps in the livecd?
2006-09-25T10:45:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	how much ram do you have in your sys?  and is it a lappy?

2006-09-25T10:45:00.000Z	`paul	jUggERNAUt1980	im thinking maybe its tryng to connect to the rep but im behind a firewall
2006-09-25T10:46:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	my solution for that with my lappy with 256 was to install with the alternative install cd.
2006-09-25T10:46:00.000Z	`paul	jUggERNAUt1980	what alternative cd??? i think ive tried 3 diff cds and it always stalls on "configuring apt" :(
2006-09-25T10:47:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	it seemed like a mem problem, but i can't see how yours would do that.
2006-09-25T10:47:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	i'll find the link for the download page.
2006-09-25T10:47:00.000Z	`paul	jUggERNAUt1980	when installing does it connect to the net or sumthin? should i unplug my lan cable?
2006-09-25T10:49:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	you can try unplugging your lan cable until after you have it installed, it may or may not work.  i wasn't connected when i installed mine.
2006-09-25T10:49:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	`paul	http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu//6.06/        ..............scroll down until you see alternate install cd.
