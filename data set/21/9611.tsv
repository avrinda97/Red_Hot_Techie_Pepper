2005-10-02T12:47:00.000Z	garyc	crimsun	 I am in the /usr/share/doc/vsftpd/EXAMPLE/  folder   is it the readme??????
2005-10-02T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	there are tons of examples in that folder
2005-10-02T12:49:00.000Z	garyc	crimsun	 I see folders for virtual users and such  -  I just want to allow but restrict users to there home folder
2005-10-02T12:50:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	have you tried searching Google?
2005-10-02T12:52:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	sudo invoke-rc.d vsftpd restart
2005-10-02T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	no
2005-10-02T12:55:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	the man page answers that :)
2005-10-02T12:58:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	it's a manual page describing usage and semantics of the program/library
2005-10-02T13:01:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	yes
2005-10-02T13:02:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	sure, you can enscript it or whatnot
2005-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	I think the man page for vsftpd seems fairly concise
2005-10-02T13:04:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	for instance, the chroot_local_user directive
2005-10-02T13:09:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	'q'
2005-10-02T13:26:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	somewhat, I'm debugging something atm. What's up?
2005-10-02T13:27:00.000Z	crimsun	garyc	work blocks it, sorry
