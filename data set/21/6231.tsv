2008-12-14T12:11:00.000Z	mb_		I am having issues with port 80 traffic
2008-12-14T12:11:00.000Z	mb_		for a ocuple of days, ubuntu puked on my wireless
2008-12-14T12:11:00.000Z	mb_		i just tried wifi-radar and it got me connected again
2008-12-14T12:11:00.000Z	mb_		however, i can not do any thing on port 80
2008-12-14T12:11:00.000Z	mb_		i use firestarter as a firewall. do i need to clear some rules?
2008-12-14T12:12:00.000Z	mb_		and if so, what is the cmd?
2008-12-14T12:12:00.000Z	ziroday	mb_	why are you using a firewall?
2008-12-14T12:12:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	why use a condom?
2008-12-14T12:14:00.000Z	ziroday	mb_	unless you are server or in a seriously dangerous environment you don't need a firewall. Having one and not knowing how it works or how to configure it will do more harm then good
2008-12-14T12:14:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	i've been using firestarter with ubuntu for over 3 years, don't start with me.
2008-12-14T12:16:00.000Z	ziroday	mb_	do you still have the issue if firestarter and the firestarter daemon are disabled?
2008-12-14T12:17:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	let me kiil them and try and find out
2008-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	what would be a command to clear ip_tables?
2008-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	seems not to have any affect with firestarter being shut down
2008-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	ziroday	mb_	If firestarter is stopped then it is not a firewall issue, unless you have more then one firewall going...
2008-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	not that I know of
2008-12-14T12:20:00.000Z	mb_	ziroday	what could it be then?
