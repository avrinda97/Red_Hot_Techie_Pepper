2008-09-26T02:13:00.000Z	Goofee691		hello
2008-09-26T02:15:00.000Z	Goofee691		does anyone here know about LVM's?
2008-09-26T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	yes
2008-09-26T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	can you explain your raid setup
2008-09-26T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	was it radi 5 ?
2008-09-26T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	raid 5 sorry
2008-09-26T02:17:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	no this was just a lvm speard across the volumes, right before i was going to try and set up a RAID5
2008-09-26T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	then your dead
2008-09-26T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	LVM in linux doesn't have reslliance
2008-09-26T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	not like things like hpux/aix lvm
2008-09-26T02:18:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	so theirs no way to get the data back without getting the missing drive fixed?
2008-09-26T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	if the disks are almost empty - yes, if they had say %20 data on them, no
2008-09-26T02:19:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	they had over 1TB of data
2008-09-26T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	gone then
2008-09-26T02:20:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	so i guess i should send the bad drive out to get repaired by some company since it should just be the PCB that failed, the PCB on the hdd likes like a shot happened on it
2008-09-26T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	that would be the best option by far, then move them to a raid solution
2008-09-26T02:21:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	ok so id assume its safe to say that no data can be recovered from that one failed drive without the others right? because im not even sure what is on it
2008-09-26T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	correct, as data is randomly spread across the disks, but with no stripe for intergrity
2008-09-26T02:23:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	thank you for your help now im just wondering how much this repair is going to cost me, whats is worse is the drive still has 2 years left on its warranty but that does not cover data recovery
2008-09-26T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Goofee691	if its pcb, shouldn't need data recovery
2008-09-26T02:26:00.000Z	Goofee691	ikonia	that is why i hope thats all it is since the pcb turned out to be slighlly discoloured like excessive heat/a short right after a thunder storm knocked out power even though the computer in question was behind a surge stip and a UPS
