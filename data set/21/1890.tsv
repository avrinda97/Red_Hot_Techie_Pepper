2011-03-11T13:24:00.000Z	tripelb		Meanwhile check out the tsunami in Hawaii.
2011-03-11T13:25:00.000Z	tripelb		Tsunami sirens just went on in Honolulu, a 3-5m wave from the Honshu quake is due to make landfall within ten minutes
2011-03-11T13:25:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	Well that is the fault of omgubuntu for not giving any information except for the "magic command"
2011-03-11T13:18:00.000Z	tripelb	arand	I added an important point to my question. I apologize for not making it clearer to you that I added that.
2011-03-11T13:18:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	It may be that the ubuntu keyserver is having problems and you may have to add the key manually, if you want it
2011-03-11T13:20:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	instructions for adding the key manually should be available at the ppa page
2011-03-11T13:20:00.000Z	tripelb	arand	I have no idea what you are talking about. PPA page?? key???
2011-03-11T13:21:00.000Z	tripelb	arand	I've been running ubuntu ofr about 3.5 years, installing things with apt-get and never dealt with either of those two concepts.
2011-03-11T13:22:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	with that command you are adding an additional repository.
2011-03-11T13:23:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	You will likely be able to install the new software from the new repository without the key, which is used to confirm the authenticity of the packages.
2011-03-11T13:31:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	You can manually add the key using (presuming the ubuntu keyserver is working): sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1378B444
2011-03-11T13:31:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	This is the repository in question: https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa
2011-03-13T01:15:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	apt-get is the recommended tool in ubuntu.
2011-03-13T01:16:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	since aptitude was removed from the standard desktop seed.
2011-03-13T01:17:00.000Z	tripelb	arand	what does "seed" mean in this context? And what was the disadvantage or advantage that caused it to be removed?
2011-03-13T01:17:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	It was removed to save space on the liveCD
2011-03-13T01:17:00.000Z	tripelb	arand	apologies if I am not having a "problem" but I need somehow to get some background understanding so .. I am teaching myself to fish.
2011-04-28T05:42:00.000Z	arand	tripelb	Yes
2011-04-28T05:43:00.000Z	tripelb	arand	thanks
