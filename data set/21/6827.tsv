2012-08-19T02:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 you dont chown/chmod NTFS or VFAT filesystems
2012-08-19T02:39:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	Any idea why nautilus won't move it to .Trash-1000 but it will move it wherever I want if I drag/drop it?
2012-08-19T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 permissions on the root of the mounted drive perhaps.   How was it mounted? by you and fstab? or auto-mounted? The ntfs-config tool may set it to mount with more open permissions that let you do it.
2012-08-19T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 I normally hate finding .Trash-XXXXX directories on my ntfs/vfat  partions and usb drives. :)
2012-08-19T02:41:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	So all files will be deleted permanently then using NTFS filesystem??
2012-08-19T02:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 it COULD be since ntfs cant set the owner of the files/dirs as the current user deleteing the file. its failing.. ive never noticed the issie on ntfs.. let me look
2012-08-19T02:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 it just let me move a file to the Trash on my NTFS partition i mounted via nautilus. :) But i will have to say this is on my 12.10 test machine
2012-08-19T02:44:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	I just noticed when I run nautilus as root, it DOES move the files to .Trash-0 ... but as user, it doesn't move it to .Trash-1000
2012-08-19T02:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 all the files on the ntfs here are owed by my user that mounted the ntfs
2012-08-19T02:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 not always.
2012-08-19T02:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 i doubt if you will notice much gain from messing with the kernel.
2012-08-19T03:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 flash sucking down cpu is not unitys fault.
2012-08-19T03:01:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	I know this is the other issue I'm having =)
2012-08-19T03:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 flash is an issue...  I tend to not use flash whenever possible.
2012-08-19T03:02:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	Damn .. I'm forced to run Flash at all times for work. There goes 50% of my cpu ><
2012-08-19T03:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 forced at work?
2012-08-19T03:03:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	no, a web app we use uses Flash... it's not graphics intensive but still taking up 50% >,<
2012-08-21T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 that will NOT be an 'iso9660' image.. it will be a clone of the first Partition.
2012-08-21T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 when it breaks - i normally find it not hard to fix.
2012-08-21T05:31:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dr_Willis	so I'll save it as a .backupImage or something ... and to restore, just boot from Live CD and do 'dd if=BackupImage of=/dev/sda1' ??
2012-08-21T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TaJMoX	 thats the basics.. clonezilla gives a better solution however.
