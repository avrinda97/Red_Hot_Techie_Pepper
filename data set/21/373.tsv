2012-02-01T10:40:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	I have not got it yet, but just doing some research. I would like to set a background image for the console, I do not use X
2012-02-01T10:41:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	I believe I must recompile the kernel for it to work.
2012-02-01T10:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	not in the ubuntu repos not really supported here per say, does not mean nobody will help but I would not hold my breath.
2012-02-01T10:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	I think this is it not sure really. http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/07/connect-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx-remote-desktop-windows-machines/
2012-02-01T10:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	maybe not either.
2012-02-01T10:43:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	remote-desktop-windows?
2012-02-01T10:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	there are a number of ways people remote to other computers if you have an I dea what you want to do I would just ask how to do that here.
2012-02-01T10:44:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	I do not want to remote.. I would like to set the background image for a TTY
2012-02-01T10:44:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	I think it uses framebuffer
2012-02-01T10:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	way outside my pay range. :D
2012-02-01T10:45:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	well, thanks for trying ;)
2012-02-01T10:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	np.
2012-02-01T10:45:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	gentoo, & backtrack both have a nice fbsplash..ubuntu has a splash image for the boot menu but the console is still just black
2012-02-01T10:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	I use burg it is adequate, there is appa for it.
2012-02-01T10:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	burg is awhole bootloader though just to get a image to choose from you would want to know how to load the mbr.
2012-02-01T10:47:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	burg looks cool
2012-02-01T10:50:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	what do you need 5 OS for..ubuntu is the only thing needed ;)
2012-02-01T10:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	one is W7 the others are for helping other users on other channels, and I like a variety to learn from.
2012-02-01T10:51:00.000Z	sqeeKEY	urlin2u	yeah, I use virtualbox :D
2012-02-01T10:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	sqeeKEY	I only have a netbook with 2 gigs ram, so they run to slow in a virtual.
