2005-03-30T08:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	well, surely you want to install it before a dist-upgrade?
2005-03-30T08:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	or are you referring to before the updating of the sources?
2005-03-30T08:36:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	as i said, it doesnt matter, if you install it, it will care for the necessary replacements
2005-04-05T09:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	No, new kcontrol has extensions for composite stuff.
2005-04-05T09:50:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	aha (my last kde desktop was 1.2) ;)
2005-04-05T09:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	there's also "fake transparency" though that comes with settings of themes. That's not composite stuff.
2005-04-05T09:56:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	do you know where kynaptic is in the menu ?
2005-04-05T09:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	Oh, it's not. There's a bug report on that. Being put in soon.
2005-04-05T09:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	he can just use Alt + F2
2005-04-05T09:57:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	its already a dependency of kubuntu-desktop, so it miust be there
2005-04-05T09:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	It's in Kubuntu, but it's not in the menu.
2005-04-05T09:57:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	ah, maybe the .desktop file is missing or broken
2005-04-05T09:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	Yup, precisely.
2005-04-20T06:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	I don't even seem to have that command :P
2005-04-20T06:31:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	its in the default hoary install and very essential now
2005-04-20T06:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	when was that put in? It won't help if he's running Warty (which he thought he was). =)
2005-04-20T06:32:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	it was also present in warty
2005-04-20T06:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	kind of wondering why I don't have it...
2005-04-20T06:33:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	argh, sorry.....i always muddle - and _ its lsb_release -a
2005-04-20T06:33:00.000Z	ogra	apokryphos	the future way ;)
2005-04-20T06:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	ogra	yeah, I might have to make it the official method when asking newbies =)
