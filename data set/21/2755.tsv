2010-11-20T08:41:00.000Z	maco	Exploiter	if its not in the nautilus preferences and running gconf-editor and navigating to /apps/nautilus (i think...) doesnt list it somewhere as a key, then its not an option
2010-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	maco	Exploiter	i use dolphin instead of nautilus
2010-11-20T08:43:00.000Z	maco	Exploiter	it's kde's file manager
2010-11-20T08:44:00.000Z	Exploiter	maco	do it have wrap file name function?? i m using nautilus extented(something) is dolphin is good?
2010-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	maco	Exploiter	yes, dolphin wraps filenames by default
2010-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	Exploiter	maco	ok gonna try it now..
2010-11-20T08:46:00.000Z	maco	Exploiter	you can set in its preferences how many lines it should use. mine is set to use 2. i think thats default
