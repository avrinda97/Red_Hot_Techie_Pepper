2012-05-24T05:16:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		hey folks... recently swapped out a bad laptop hard drive for a new one.  new one has been spinning for 10 hours (copying a bunch of files from my old box) and SMART data says it already has 4 bad sectors... is this normal?

2012-05-24T05:16:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	4 bad sectors is so little you shouldn't worry
2012-05-24T05:16:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	whats bad
2012-05-24T05:16:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	drives develop bad sectors over time regardless of use
2012-05-24T05:17:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	100's
2012-05-24T05:18:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	take a look at the smart data using the disk utility.  It gives some other numbers for perspective
2012-05-24T05:19:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	all other smart data from disk utility sohws normal
2012-05-24T05:19:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	what is the value / category that is not 'normal' ?
2012-05-24T05:20:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	current pending sector count; 4
2012-05-24T05:21:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	ohh, is it new?  Maybe this is bad.
2012-05-24T05:21:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	I assumed we were talking about reallocated sector count
2012-05-24T05:22:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	its a brand new drive
2012-05-24T05:22:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	It's fine to have some reallocated sectors.  I sector is remapped.  Then it becomes reallocated.  Since your have some stuck pending that is not good.  The pending count should go back to 0 and reallocated should increase
2012-05-24T05:23:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	when does this remapping happen?  reboot?
2012-05-24T05:24:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	I believe it happens on the fly (instantly when a write fails).  I could be wrong though.
2012-05-24T05:24:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	It might be delayed if you're doing a really big write / read like you said you are.
2012-05-24T05:25:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	god damn it; its been a day and a half just to get this drive swapped data baked up etc
2012-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	It shouldn't take a day.5 just to copy a hdd
2012-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	deadmund	well it takes longer if your old drive had a bunch of errors and kept crapping out; along with slow read speed
2012-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	deadmund	arooni-mobile	ahh, yes.  Just copy user data :)
