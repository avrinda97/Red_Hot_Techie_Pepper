2009-03-18T21:47:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	Helpful for cli beginners
2009-03-18T21:47:00.000Z	Ax3	inx-live	point beginners to ubuntuforums or help.ubuntu.com
2009-03-18T21:48:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	*sigh* did you bother to look at the site?
2009-03-18T21:48:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	for heaven's sake..
2009-03-18T21:49:00.000Z	Ax3	inx-live	I did, but standardized support docs provided by the community are typically of higher quality and will lead them to other topics too.
2009-03-18T21:49:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	do a whois on me than look me up on launchpad
2009-03-18T21:50:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	Thanks for the compliment - I wrote it :|
2009-03-18T21:50:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	Keep an open mind, OK?
2009-03-18T21:50:00.000Z	Ax3	inx-live	I didn't say your site wasn't useful, but it's important to get people used to checking the common support places.;-)
2009-03-18T21:51:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	Listen, I practicallylived on this channel from 2004 to 2007 and I always pointed people to Ubuntu docs. If you used inx you owuld see that it also point people to those docs
2009-03-18T21:52:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	as i said, open mind
2009-03-18T21:53:00.000Z	Ax3	inx-live	:p
2009-03-18T21:54:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	BTW peopel are working on making inx into an ubuntu package you can run on an installed Ubuntu (hopeful that will happen)
2009-03-18T21:55:00.000Z	inx-live	Ax3	I specifically wrote INX to help people, which is what I was doing for Ubuntu from 2004 :)
2009-03-18T21:56:00.000Z	Ax3	inx-live	cool, I personally tell people to do a gentoo installation if they want to learn what's going on. ;-)
