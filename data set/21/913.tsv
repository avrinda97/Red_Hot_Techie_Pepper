2011-04-21T22:53:00.000Z	trihope	KM0201	test
2011-04-21T22:57:00.000Z	KM0201	trihope	test received.. :)
2011-04-21T22:58:00.000Z	KM0201	trihope	no, i was AFK.. lemm elook
2011-04-21T22:59:00.000Z	trihope	KM0201	it was directed toward you specifically.  AFK?
2011-04-21T22:59:00.000Z	KM0201	trihope	away from keyboard.. i don't use banshee.. so not real sure on that one.. is the windows partition mounted?.. cuz if its not mounted, then banshee can't see the music
2011-04-21T22:59:00.000Z	trihope	KM0201	well, I don't think it's mounted, but rythmbox was able to see the music
2011-04-21T23:00:00.000Z	KM0201	trihope	hang on
2011-04-21T23:01:00.000Z	trihope	KM0201	maybe banshee will require it.  rythmbox scanned and recognized all the files, but after doing that and researching banshee, I think I will like banshee better for several reasons
2011-04-21T23:02:00.000Z	KM0201	trihope	it worked for me... (but i don't have ntfs partitions)
2011-04-21T23:05:00.000Z	trihope	KM0201	do you think it would have anything to do with rythmbox already doing it (such as being set as default player and banshee not being able to access the info)?
2011-04-21T23:05:00.000Z	KM0201	trihope	it shouldn't..... but i don't use banshee that much.. i just installed it to test your prob.
2011-04-21T23:05:00.000Z	trihope	KM0201	thanks.
