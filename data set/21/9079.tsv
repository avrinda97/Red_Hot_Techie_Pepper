2005-11-20T16:46:00.000Z	Mabus06		Can I change the folder apache2 starts in (/var/www) to something else?
2005-11-20T16:46:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Certainly. Edit the /etc/apache2/sites-availble/default
2005-11-20T16:47:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Or, create a new file in /etc/apache2/sites-availble, link it into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and remove /etc/apache2/sites-enabled.
2005-11-20T16:47:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Does that make sense?
2005-11-20T16:47:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	when I have no index.html, it has like an ftp thing. How do I keep that and also have a webpage by default I can link to the ftp with?
2005-11-20T16:48:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	It's a directory listing, um, you can keep the directory listing and put text in a default file. I'm not so sure, actually. :-)
2005-11-20T16:50:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	could I maybe have like, a folder with all of my html as the default, and then somehow link to that directory listing from the other folder?
2005-11-20T16:51:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Sure.
2005-11-20T16:51:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	how?
2005-11-20T16:54:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Um. Honestly, I'm not actually sure. Give me a few minutes, while I read docs.
2005-11-20T16:56:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Okay, there are few ways to do this.
2005-11-20T16:57:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	the easiest would be if I could create several directories I could have listings to.
2005-11-20T16:57:00.000Z	Mabus06		links to, I mean.
2005-11-20T16:58:00.000Z	StevenK		I'd suggest you create a /var/www/index.html, and then make a /var/www/download (or whatever) directory, containing a .htaccess file. The .htaccess file should say "FancyIndexing yes" and then that *should* have a listing and then include the index.html file.
2005-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	But, I'm not sure. The easiest way to deal with Apache2 is to play around and see what works. The documentation is available on http://httpd.apache.org, and you want the docs for 2.0
2005-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	include the index.html file? What do you mean?
2005-11-20T17:00:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Okay, so the web page should have a directory listing, and then have the index.html file below the listing.
2005-11-20T17:01:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	below the listing? Do you mean just create a blank index.html file in the /var/www/download folder?
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Well, you don't need an index.html ...
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	Mabus06	StevenK	I didn't think so, but what were you talking about?
2005-11-20T17:03:00.000Z	StevenK	Mabus06	Okay - the only reason I mention it is because you mentioned having a webpage and a listing on the same page ...
