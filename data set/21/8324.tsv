2006-04-29T15:27:00.000Z	liquidindian		Odd question for here, but you're friendly.   Is it possible for XP to read ext3 partitions?  (Or does anyone use an iriver with ubuntu?)
2006-04-29T15:27:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	There are a couple of ext3 drivers. Most of them are read-only afaik.

2006-04-29T15:29:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	 thanks.  Looks like I'm going to have to install XP to get my girlfriend's mp3 player working :/
2006-04-29T15:29:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	Really? Isn't that just an USB storage device?
2006-04-29T15:30:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	 That's what I thought.  I can tranfer files across, but the mp3 player doesn't 'see' them.
2006-04-29T15:31:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	Then you've probably just put them in the wrong directory.
2006-04-29T15:32:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	Some (most?) mp3 players has got to have the files in a spesific dir to access them. I know that my g/fs mp3 player has got something like a database too to keep track of the tunes. That needs a spesific util to update.
2006-04-29T15:32:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	however you can manually browse the filesystem of that player.
2006-04-29T15:32:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	that makes sense, as it thinks the files I deleted are still there.
2006-04-29T15:35:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	Well then you just need to find out how that database thing works. Have you got any option of browsing the filesystem on the player itself?
2006-04-29T15:35:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	what is the make and model of it?
2006-04-29T15:36:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	An Iriver H10, 1Gig
2006-04-29T15:37:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	I think it's called a Jr, it's a bit confusing at I bought it here in Japan.
2006-04-29T15:38:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	bad news on http://www.playerblog.com/archives/000493.shtml
2006-04-29T15:38:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	Actually, looking in the system files on it is a H10Jr
2006-04-29T15:39:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	Yep, that's a picture of it :)
2006-04-29T15:39:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	"Specifically iRiver said that the H10 will only support Microsoft's new Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) instead of the more common Mass Storage Class (MSC)." <= bad news
2006-04-29T15:41:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	There a link at the bottom, though.  Thanks!
2006-04-29T15:41:00.000Z	BlueEalge	liquidindian	well, what do you know. :)
2006-04-29T15:49:00.000Z	liquidindian	BlueEalge	Hmm, doesn't work on this player.  BAH
