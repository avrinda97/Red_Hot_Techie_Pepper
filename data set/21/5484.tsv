2007-10-05T15:58:00.000Z	NewOnThis		hi everyone
2007-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	NewOnThis		I came here because I have a little big problem xD
2007-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	NewOnThis		when I'm installing Ubuntu, it loads a sort of things, and then my screen goes standy by
2007-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	NewOnThis		so  I can't install :(
2007-10-05T16:00:00.000Z	NewOnThis		Athlon 64 3000+
2007-10-05T16:01:00.000Z	NewOnThis		I have a 7600 GS
2007-10-05T16:02:00.000Z	NewOnThis		I'm afraid I can't... so I can't install Ubuntu? :'(
2007-10-05T16:02:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	try the alternate install CD, there's a checkbox to get it on the download site
2007-10-06T16:03:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	gonna give it a shot, thanks
2007-10-06T16:04:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	do you have a 64-bit proc?
2007-10-06T16:05:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	yes, but I mean 6.06 or 7.04?
2007-10-06T16:05:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	7.04, definitely, imo
2007-10-06T16:05:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	ok thanks, will dload that one
2007-10-06T16:05:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	good luck
2007-10-06T16:06:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	thanks, hope that one works for me, otherwise I'll go hang myself xD
2007-10-06T16:07:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	one last question, would I be able to install the text based without problems?
2007-10-06T16:07:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	it will likely *install* correctly, whether it boots after that is the trick
2007-10-06T16:08:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	oh :S I see...
2007-10-06T16:08:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	depending on your hardware, you might have to give grub a couple of tags (noapic, noacpi, etc) to get it to boot and then you can work on getting the display and everything else just right
2007-10-06T16:08:00.000Z	mjancaitis	NewOnThis	with any luck though, if you're on well-supported hardware, everything will work
2007-10-06T16:09:00.000Z	NewOnThis	mjancaitis	thanks a lot, I'll be back xD
