2009-07-12T19:06:00.000Z	arand	soreau	watson516 if installing from the *.run file you won't need it anyways, something else is awry... And I'm not sure I got any idea what...
2009-07-15T06:57:00.000Z	soreau	arand	I wonder which driver is providing wlan0 then
2009-07-15T06:58:00.000Z	soreau	arand	He probably needs to unload whatever that would be and probe the bcm module (the broadcom driver module is 'bcmxxxx' or it at least has bcm in the name, right?)
2009-07-15T07:02:00.000Z	arand	soreau	bcm203x would be my guess, as to what provides wlan0, no clue... kernel usually means I'm way to deep in, above my head...
2009-07-15T07:02:00.000Z	soreau	arand	Since he says it's a bcm4306 I'm gonna go with bcm3510 for now ;)
2010-02-11T09:24:00.000Z	arand	soreau	I think that's gone in karmic..
2010-02-11T09:24:00.000Z	soreau	arand	I believe it works again, now
2011-04-03T15:04:00.000Z	arand	soreau	Dr_Willis: I think the issue is simply that there is not enough space available for X to create it's termopary files, etc.
2011-04-03T15:04:00.000Z	soreau	arand	indeed
2011-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	arand	soreau	That's a gnome feature you know :Ã¾
2011-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	arand	soreau	You Can find that in gconf somewhere.
2011-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	soreau	arand	Yea, I know that. I was asking where
2011-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	arand	soreau	/desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons
2011-04-29T08:00:00.000Z	soreau	arand	thanks
2011-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	arand	soreau	The whole thing is one big applet
2011-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	soreau	arand	Yes how do you edit it?
2011-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	soreau	arand	And what is the applet called?
2011-04-29T08:11:00.000Z	arand	soreau	I think you can disable things by uninstalling packages, hmm.
2011-04-29T08:12:00.000Z	soreau	arand	But what is the applet called?
2011-04-29T08:13:00.000Z	arand	soreau	indicator-applet I think, and the element have names similar..
2011-04-29T08:15:00.000Z	arand	soreau	I think you can install certain parts of it, e.g. "indicator-messages"
