2009-10-20T19:00:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	it wont update to 9.04
2009-10-20T19:00:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	just do a sudo apt-get update and it should disappear
2009-10-20T19:01:00.000Z	albasheers	indus	: I tried it , but not working
2009-10-20T19:01:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	not working means whattt
2009-10-20T19:02:00.000Z	albasheers	indus	I am getting  " not all updates are installed
2009-10-20T19:02:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	in terminal?
2009-10-20T19:02:00.000Z	albasheers	indus	:http://imagebin.org/68535
2009-10-20T19:03:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	i cant open that link
2009-10-20T19:03:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	ok saw it
2009-10-20T19:03:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	ok just cancel it, and try later
2009-10-20T19:04:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	this is an intrepid partial upgrade not 9.04
2009-10-20T19:04:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	why do you worry?
2009-10-20T19:04:00.000Z	albasheers	indus	: I tried that and I even restarted the system
2009-10-20T19:04:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	also go to system>administration>software sources and remove cd rom
2009-10-20T19:10:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	so does it work?
2009-10-20T19:12:00.000Z	albasheers	indus	I did that again it is showing me to do partial update
2009-10-20T19:12:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	ya thats fine, but avoid partial upgrades, wait a day
2009-10-20T19:13:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	its because not all packages have been built ,some probably held back
2009-10-20T19:13:00.000Z	indus	albasheers	it wont upgrade you to 9.04 dont worry
2009-10-20T19:13:00.000Z	albasheers	indus	thanks
