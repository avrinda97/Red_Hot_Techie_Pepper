2006-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	smithveg		they tell me, the 'application/x-mplayer2' missing
2006-12-17T08:59:00.000Z	Gibbonz	smithveg	you need the mozilla plugin for your choice of playback software, eg here i use vlc so I have the mozilla vlc plugin
2006-12-17T09:00:00.000Z	smithveg	Gibbonz	i do not sure...
2006-12-17T09:00:00.000Z	Gibbonz		well if you use mplayer then you need mplayer-plugin-mozilla
2006-12-17T09:00:00.000Z	Gibbonz		or whetever its called
2006-12-17T09:04:00.000Z	Gibbonz		anyway, any ideas why right click -> eject tries to write to an audio cd, or is this perhaps some quirk due to the drive being a cdrw?
