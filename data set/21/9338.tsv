2005-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	Hendric	n00bster	when you ghost a linux drive (using any ghost version that supports linux partitions), the cloned drives boot loader is messed up. so you need to rescue it, inorder to fix the boot error on the new cloned drive.
2005-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	n00bster		and i do that from ubuntu CD ?
2005-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	n00bster		ok, i undertand :}
2005-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	Hendric	n00bster	yes you rescue from the ubuntu CD.
