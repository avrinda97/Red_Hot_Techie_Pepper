2007-05-18T07:58:00.000Z	shooters	defcon	do a backup of your /etc/fstab and copy/paste the one located at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21375/
2007-05-18T07:59:00.000Z	defcon	shooters	ok
2007-05-18T08:00:00.000Z	shooters	defcon	after try "sudo mount /dev/sda1" and pastebin the output
2007-05-18T08:01:00.000Z	defcon	shooters	no output
2007-05-18T08:02:00.000Z	shooters	defcon	that means the mount was successful?
2007-05-18T08:04:00.000Z	defcon	shooters	thankyou so much :)
2007-05-18T08:04:00.000Z	shooters	defcon	then do "sudo mount /dev/sdb2" and hopefully it should mount without any problems
2007-05-18T08:04:00.000Z	shooters	defcon	np
2007-05-18T08:05:00.000Z	defcon	shooters	will these automount? and why do you think this happened
2007-05-18T08:06:00.000Z	shooters	defcon	they should automount, mount wasn't able to recognize the UUID specified in /etc/fstab, I removed the UUID for those 2 drives and replaced them with their /dev equivalents... I should work without any problems now
