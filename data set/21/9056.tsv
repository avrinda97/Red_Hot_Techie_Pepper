2005-11-20T16:58:00.000Z	Drgb		i can't login with my new user......please.....can someone help me?
2005-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	Drgb		when i use "sudo su - drgb"
2005-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	Drgb		it asks me for a password, i type the password but it says "try again"
2005-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	coax	Drgb	try setting the password again...
2005-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	Drgb		i changed the password almost hundred times
2005-11-20T17:00:00.000Z	Drgb		but i had the same result
2005-11-20T17:00:00.000Z	Drgb		i am desperate.....
2005-11-20T17:00:00.000Z	coax	Drgb	hmm... try to see if the user have a valid login shell in /etc/passwd
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	Drgb	coax	it has /home/drgb/bin/bash
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	Drgb		but
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	Drgb		it doesn't exist
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	Drgb		O_O?
2005-11-20T17:02:00.000Z	coax	Drgb	set it to a valid one, fx. /bin/bash
2005-11-20T17:04:00.000Z	Drgb	coax	i'm trying to write it but i can't, how to run a text editor with root permissions?
2005-11-20T17:05:00.000Z	coax	Drgb	open a terminal and write sudo in front of the command you need to run.
2005-11-20T17:05:00.000Z	Drgb		anything happened....
2005-11-20T17:06:00.000Z	Drgb		adduser drgb
2005-11-20T17:06:00.000Z	Drgb	coax	i tried sudo abiword but nothing happened
2005-11-20T17:07:00.000Z	coax		it might be a good idea to use a non-grapical app to edit it with... fx. nano
2005-11-20T17:07:00.000Z	coax		sudo nano /etc/passwd
2005-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	coax	Drgb	by the way, the commands in the bottom of nano are used with [ctrl] +* fx. quit = [ctrl] +[X]
