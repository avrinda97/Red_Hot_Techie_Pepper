2008-07-12T19:42:00.000Z	spiongraz		hi, somehow i fucked my ubuntu up :<
2008-07-12T19:42:00.000Z	spiongraz		whenever i boot into it now
2008-07-12T19:43:00.000Z	spiongraz		the screen turns all white and i cant do anything, what should i do, to be able to do anything again
2008-07-12T19:43:00.000Z	spiongraz		funny thing is, the screen is only white, but compiz still works ;d
2008-07-12T19:43:00.000Z	spiongraz		so i got a a funny white cube
2008-07-12T19:43:00.000Z	spiongraz		i have the latest hardy heron with all the recent patches
2008-07-12T19:45:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	white screen happens after you login?
2008-07-12T19:46:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	you upgraded your kernel recently?
2008-07-12T19:47:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	through envyng?
2008-07-12T19:48:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	mm idno
2008-07-12T19:48:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	the same thing happened to me after updating kernel and booting
2008-07-12T19:49:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	no reason, check if your fglrx drivers are 8-4 or 8-6, i cant remember how atm <>
2008-07-12T19:49:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	should be visible in catalyst control center
2008-07-12T19:50:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	if you change session to failsafe gnome then login, it will boot
2008-07-12T19:50:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	normally as if nothing happened
2008-07-12T19:50:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	ELSE
2008-07-12T19:50:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	try going through recovery
2008-07-12T19:51:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	and use the xfix option
2008-07-12T19:51:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	kay then, just launch failsafe gnome
2008-07-12T19:51:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	and try installing fglrx again
2008-07-12T19:51:00.000Z	db92	spiongraz	sounds like a driver screwup, although i wouldnt be the one to actually know
