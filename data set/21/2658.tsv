2009-12-19T21:24:00.000Z	Crazy|One		hi all, i was here earlier with a problem but decided to try and see if i can sort it out myself.  Tried to upgrade ubuntu 8.04 to 9.10 with update manager but the system shutdown (I think overheated) before it completed all packages and when i boot up i get the terminal screen.  When i do apt-get upgrade it complains about the dpkg  is readonly.  I did sudo dpkg --configure -a and i get dpkg: unable to access dpkg status area: 
2009-12-19T21:26:00.000Z	Crazy|One		could somebody tell me how i can make the system not readonly to sort out my above msg about boot error?

2009-12-19T21:41:00.000Z	nikolaj_basher		If you can install that and do not format the partition so you don't loose any data, and after the installation then update your system
