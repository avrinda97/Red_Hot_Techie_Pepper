2005-06-23T15:41:00.000Z	levander		Anybody has got any of these "multimedia" keyboards to work with Linux?
2005-06-23T15:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	i've got my volume and mute keys working
2005-06-23T15:43:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	anything special you had to do?  Just remember that from years ago, you had to have a specific driver for your specific keyboard if it did anything other than just the normal keys.
2005-06-23T15:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	there was a step i don't remember, but i'm not sure how important it was; anyway, the main thing was system -> preferences -> shortcuts
2005-07-29T13:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	yip
2005-07-29T13:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/<whatever>
2005-07-29T13:08:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	but I don't have to "enable" dma - like in the wiki it does in step 4 for when you reboot?
2005-07-29T13:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	which wiki page is that?
2005-07-29T13:08:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DMA?highlight=%28dma%29
2005-07-29T13:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	if you are referring to /etc/hdparm.conf, that is just telling bootup to run hdparm, and with what parameters
2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	yeah, a bit annoying
2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	ah! yeah, that makes sense, thanks
2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	and why does publicly information have to be secured? Makes no sense.
2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	maybe it's just an easy solution to protect the password login
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	but it does seem to be overkill. and, for me anyway, the site seems slow
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	the public can't edit that wiki? what they need a password for?
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	no, you need to register. registration is open and free
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	yeah, apparently you need to create an account and get a password on that wiki to edit, see what you're saying
2005-08-11T11:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	i would guess you need to enable rockridge or joliet extensions
2005-08-12T15:24:00.000Z	HappyFool	levander	i think /dev/sg* are scsi devices; i can't remember the details
2005-08-12T15:25:00.000Z	levander	HappyFool	yeah, I remember something about that too.  I think you're right, but I'm not sure.
