2005-02-10T13:00:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	 how about gkrellm
2005-02-10T13:02:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	should be in your software catalogue (Synaptic or Aptitude or whatever)... if it's not, you'll probably need to enable the universe and multiverse repositories... are you familiar with that?
2005-02-10T13:02:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	nope
2005-02-10T13:03:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	what category would that be in under synaptic
2005-02-10T13:04:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	let's see... don't know; I just searched for gkrellm
2005-02-10T13:05:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	but first you'll have to click on the Settings menu, click on 'Repositories', and enable anything you see there ^_^
2005-02-10T13:07:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	 i dont see a settings menu
2005-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	in Synaptic, menus should be File, Edit, Package, Settings, Help
2005-02-10T13:15:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	the guide doesnt tell me how to run the compiler
2005-02-10T13:15:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	yikes, what do you want to compile?
2005-02-10T13:15:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	a Java source file?
2005-02-10T13:17:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	 yea
2005-02-10T13:22:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	 how would i make gkrellm start up automatically when i login
2005-02-10T13:23:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	Computer menu > Desktop Preferences > Sessions
2005-02-10T13:24:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	 and adding the program name there would automatically start it up?
2005-02-10T13:24:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	oh yeah, that's what I was doing. ummmm... let's see...
2005-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	pdaoust	dread65	yep, just click 'Add' under Startup Programs, and away you go
2005-02-10T13:29:00.000Z	dread65	pdaoust	 ok cool i guess i have to relogin to test it out is there anyway to do that withot exiting here
