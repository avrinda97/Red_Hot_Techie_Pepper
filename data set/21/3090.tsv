2009-05-18T22:16:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		Hi, I just tried activating the ATI drivers using the hardware drivers app and can't boot to login. I've tried running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg in recovery console but it's not helping at all. Could someone help me please? :(
2009-05-18T22:17:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	download it from ATI site, uninstall old, install new, aticonfig --initiate, reboot
2009-05-18T22:18:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	how do i uninstall old from the recovery console?
2009-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	cd /usr/share/ati
2009-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	sh ./fglrx-uninstall.sh
2009-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	Thank you :)
2009-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	it's from ATI manual
2009-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	Oh! I guess that would help. I will try looking at it. Sorry.
2009-05-18T22:21:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	at any rate, catalyst 8.12 worked on 8.10, now 9.4 vs 9.04 seems to, but i caught other bug
2009-05-18T22:33:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	you could try using emerald? o.O
2009-05-18T22:37:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	Well uninstalling fglrx alone let me actually load X :) Thanks... I will try installing the newer version and see if that works now
2009-05-18T22:37:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	 in my case it loaded graphic login, but screwed up utterly after it
2009-05-18T22:38:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	oh :( that's no good
2009-05-18T22:39:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	 that was fixed after ATI driver is installed (ati-driver-installer-#-##-x86.x86_64.run from their site)
2009-05-18T22:39:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	seems like it won't let me install them,.. li'm going to keep playing with it though
2009-05-18T22:40:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	 what it says?
2009-05-18T22:40:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	"X Server: unable to detect"
2009-05-18T22:40:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	I'm researching online to see what the cause / resolution for the issue is
2009-05-18T22:41:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	 what X server? it supposed to be installed from recoveryt console
2009-05-18T22:41:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	TBeholder	I tried from the recovery console and it gave me this error, I figured it may need X running to work so I logged in to gnome and tried, same error
2009-05-18T22:42:00.000Z	TBeholder	jamalfanaian	 weird. for me, ATI driver installer works from console
