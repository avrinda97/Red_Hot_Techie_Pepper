2005-07-03T05:03:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	what's your problem?
2005-07-03T05:04:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	the apache2 server is trying to find libphp4.so in /etc/apache2/modules/, but
2005-07-03T05:06:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	copying shouldn't be necessary
2005-07-03T05:07:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	ok what do I do to solve this problem?
2005-07-03T05:08:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	the server can find php4 files.
2005-07-03T05:09:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	how did you install apache and php?
2005-07-03T05:09:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	I used synaptic on a hoary system.
2005-07-03T05:11:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	then php should just work.
2005-07-03T05:12:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	you can try 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall libapache2-mod-php4' in the console.
2005-07-03T05:12:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	well, when I enter apache2 -t I get a failure tell met that libphp4.so can not be found.
2005-07-03T05:13:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	oh. ok. that's telling you that you've changed sometihng in the config.
2005-07-03T05:13:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	that is why I move libphp4.so to where apchae2 was looking for it.
2005-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	yes I did. I add a LoadModule directive for php4 as per instructions.
2005-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	remove it.
2005-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	remove the bit you added.
2005-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	and try apache2 -t again.
2005-07-03T05:15:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	One second, I'll give it a shot.
2005-07-03T05:17:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	Ok that worked. Can you explain why I didn't need it?
2005-07-03T05:18:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	because it's added automatically by the php4 installation. the reason you don't see it is that it's loaded from /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php4.load
2005-07-03T05:19:00.000Z	tiredbones	uniq	-  thanks for the reply.
2005-07-03T05:20:00.000Z	uniq	tiredbones	happy to help. :)
