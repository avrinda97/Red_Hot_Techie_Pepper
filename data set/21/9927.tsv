2007-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		hello
2007-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		i just installed ubuntu
2007-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		it never asked me for root password
2007-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		now i know what it is
2007-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		and it doesn't accept empty password
2007-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fetrovsky	there is no root user in ubuntu
2007-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		i don't want sudo
2007-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		i want rood
2007-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		root
2007-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		why not root user??
2007-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fetrovsky	then use another distro that is not designed to root without root
2007-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		they all are designed to root without root, but they also have the root user
2007-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fetrovsky	you can read the reasons in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
2007-10-09T10:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fetrovsky	 designed to run without root i meant
2007-10-09T10:57:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		LinuxJugga i did that, it asked for password
2007-10-09T10:59:00.000Z	Fetrovsky	nickrud	what's my sudo passwd?
2007-10-09T11:00:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		so if i only set up one user account, thats my user password?
2007-10-09T11:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fetrovsky	have you read the docs ubotu told you? You are dismissing a model (using sudo instead a root accaunt) without even knowing how to use the model!!
2007-10-09T11:01:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		ersul: i don't dismiss the model.. it's just that ubuntu is forcing me to use the new model without giving me the choice first
2007-10-09T11:02:00.000Z	Fetrovsky		i want to use my model, then learn the new one and decide if i want it or not
2007-10-09T11:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fetrovsky	well ubuntu is designed to be user friendly so it *has* ( or *must*) make choices for you. any distro will make choices for you except if you do a linux from scratch
