2010-04-07T18:52:00.000Z	ubuntu		need some help with getting pictures off cell phone -- anyone?
2010-04-07T18:54:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	if cell phone is Palm device, I might be able to help.
2010-04-07T18:54:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	pvt msg since this is off-topic?
2010-04-07T18:54:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	motorola
2010-04-07T18:54:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	sorry, not familiar.  Better luck elsewhere!
2010-04-07T18:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	tried sudo mount /dev/sda /media/nameofdevice and it said didn't recognize it
2010-04-07T18:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	but dmesg |tail -20 showd motororal phone
2010-04-07T18:56:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	if it appears on /media/nameofdevice, then it would already be mounted (Ubuntu would do that automatically).  Someone else might be able to tell you how to mount it.  Only if the phone acts as a mass storage device; it might not.  (YOu can't mount a webcam, for example.)
2010-04-07T18:59:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	what is the model of your motorola phone?  I'm trying to Google for you, but you haven't supplied a lot of info.
2010-04-07T19:00:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	in Konversation: type "geekp" then tab.  Not sure in whatever the default is for GNOME Ubuntu.
2010-04-07T19:02:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	do we know yet the model of your motorola phone?  I will give up if no info in 60 seconds.
2010-04-07T19:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	someone took out the simm and put another one in T-Mobile I beleive, but with original simm it didn't work either
2010-04-07T19:05:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	You're not giving info I need, so will try again one last time.  What is the model of your Motorola phone?  Example: I use a Palm Treo 650.  What do you use?  What is the machine that connects to your Ubuntu machine?
2010-04-07T19:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	have almost no idea
2010-04-07T19:05:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	Ah. Thanks for telling me.  I will give up now.
2010-04-07T19:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	don't have it with me "charging" but not sure if that'll help
2010-04-07T19:06:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	thanks anyway for your input
2010-11-03T18:01:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	Congrats on new disk. I think boot partition can be any fs.
2010-11-03T18:01:00.000Z	ubuntu	kwtm	k thanks
2011-01-28T01:50:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	You need to be more specific about "I can't boot up ubuntu".  It does not show a graphics screen?  Computer does not say it's booting?  You see your computer screen except the screensaver looks really ugly? etc. etc.
2011-04-17T11:52:00.000Z	kwtm	ubuntu	Hablo un poquito espanol, pero estaria mejor si usa la canale #ubuntu-es
