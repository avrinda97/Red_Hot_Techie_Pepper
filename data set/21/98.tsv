2012-10-19T04:53:00.000Z	absentbird		Hello, I am having a sound problem. I have followed a lot of Ubuntu documentation and it is still giving me grief. I can see the card with ALSA Mixer but Pulse is just not having it.
2012-10-19T04:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-10-19T04:56:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	https://gist.github.com/3915654
2012-10-19T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	run the command through and upload to the server, a URL will be generated
2012-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	Oh, whoops. Here: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=29f3171339ae2779be52b34753ddf1ed4f75691a
2012-10-19T05:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	if you run the sound app, is the correct device set for sound output?
2012-10-19T05:01:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	There is no output device listed. This started when I got a new motherboard.
2012-10-19T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*   wait 10 seconds and reboot
2012-10-19T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	is there an option in BIOS to disable HDMI audio?
2012-10-19T05:03:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	Alright, I will see you after reboot. Thanks for the help.
2012-10-19T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	yuou also have an old model=clevo  in your alsa-base.conf which may not work with the new hardware
2012-10-19T05:07:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	I should probably mention that I purged PulseAudio because it was causing lockups so it is currently not installed.
2012-10-19T05:11:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	Any thoughts on what to try next?
2012-10-19T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	yuou also have an old model=clevo  in your alsa-base.conf which may not work with the new hardware
2012-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	Should I remove that?
2012-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	yes as you changed hardware, didn't you?
2012-10-19T05:13:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	Yeah. Should I just delete the whole file and regenerate it?
2012-10-19T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	no, just that line, then reboot
2012-10-19T05:18:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	So still no sound.
2012-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	absentbird	are you using HDMI audio?
2012-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	absentbird	ActionParsnip	No, I am using standard analog audio
