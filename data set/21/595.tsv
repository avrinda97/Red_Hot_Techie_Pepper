2011-09-08T10:26:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	it's in the default applications settings : gnome-default-applications-properties
2011-09-08T10:27:00.000Z	irc2samus	glebihan	I have gnome-default-applications-properties which opens the "preferred applications" and that does not show the actual command, just a dropdown to select the browser
2011-09-08T10:28:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	then check the value of /desktop/gnome/applications/browser/exec in gconf-editor
2011-09-08T10:29:00.000Z	irc2samus	glebihan	nice tool :) unfortunately it shows just 'firefox' as the command
2011-09-08T10:29:00.000Z	irc2samus		(the plot thikens...)
2011-09-08T10:29:00.000Z	irc2samus		+c
2011-09-08T10:31:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	weird... Have you tried to change your default browser in order to see whether the behavior is specific to firefox ?
2011-09-08T10:32:00.000Z	irc2samus	glebihan	it's the only browser I have installed atm but it's worth a try, let me install another and I'll reply back
2011-09-08T10:40:00.000Z	irc2samus	glebihan	I've installed Chromium it does not have the problem when set as the preferred web browser
2011-09-08T10:40:00.000Z	irc2samus		only Firefox :/
2011-09-08T10:41:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	and the problem is still there when you switch back to firefox ?
2011-09-08T10:41:00.000Z	irc2samus	glebihan	yes
2011-09-08T10:42:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	then it must be something with firefox settings... but I dont' see what it could be. Maybe you could try creating a new profile in firefox, define it as default and see if it's still the same
2011-09-08T10:43:00.000Z	irc2samus		:D sec I'll try
2011-09-08T10:44:00.000Z	irc2samus	glebihan	new profile, same issue :(
2011-09-08T10:44:00.000Z	irc2samus		now I'm really puzzled, that number doesn't even look like a PID or anything
2011-09-08T10:45:00.000Z	irc2samus		and it's always the same, don't know if after a reboot it might change
2011-09-08T10:45:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	unlikely. Then again, all of this is very strange
2011-09-08T10:45:00.000Z	irc2samus		indeed
2011-09-08T10:46:00.000Z	glebihan	irc2samus	you may be better off just setting a shortcut to firefox instead of web browser
