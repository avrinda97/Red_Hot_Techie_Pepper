2007-06-12T15:08:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	does your subnet mask include the address of archive.ubuntu.com?
2007-06-12T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	pardon ?
2007-06-12T15:08:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	I've had that problem before; I couldn't access certain sites since my subnet mask was too large
2007-06-12T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	my networking is fine
2007-06-12T15:09:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	it is a rare problem
2007-06-12T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	my networking is fine thanks
2007-06-12T15:10:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	can you traceroute to that site? possibly the communication is administratively prohibited, or blocked somewhere along the way
2007-06-12T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	are you listening - "my networking works %100 - I am having NO problems"
2007-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	but you said, "its the only site i can't conenct to, my net works fine
2007-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	no I didn't
2007-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	is that no longer true?
2007-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	my networking has always been fine
2007-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	"pirate _hunter" said that
2007-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	I'm not listening to him
2007-06-12T15:12:00.000Z	jeff2	ikonia	oh, he was confusing me. sorry for the trouble
2007-06-12T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	not at all
2007-06-12T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff2	I mean no problem
