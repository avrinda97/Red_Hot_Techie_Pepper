2009-10-07T08:25:00.000Z	mgv1		just a silly thing to call ubuntu 'for humans'
2009-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	are you aware of the meaning of the word "ubuntu" ?
2009-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	what is it?
2009-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	it means "humanity towards others"
2009-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	sounds like robot
2009-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	?
2009-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	the name ubuntu reminds me the word robot
2009-10-07T08:29:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	so this is the actual name of ubuntu? by what languege?
2009-10-07T08:30:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	the word comes from Africa
2009-10-07T08:32:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	"humanity towards others" is also boring name
2009-10-07T08:33:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	what would you call it?
2009-10-07T08:35:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	"understanding robotic behaviur in humans" but what is the matter what is my suggestion the name doesnt pretty
2009-10-07T08:35:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	i don't understand what you mean by 'robotic'
2009-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	doing like others without tiny amount of realism and without good reason
2009-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	i'm still not following.
2009-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	aggresive copying of others
2009-10-07T08:39:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	robots are purpose built machines, so they have no concept of thought per se
2009-10-07T08:41:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	but that can be said in similar way about people
2009-10-07T08:42:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	i do concede that people can act like robots, but i don't understand how ubuntu is related (other than that the word ubuntu reminds you of robots)
2009-10-07T08:47:00.000Z	mgv1	jjrev	this is probably important enoght
2009-10-07T08:50:00.000Z	jjrev	mgv1	look into conky and rss feeds
