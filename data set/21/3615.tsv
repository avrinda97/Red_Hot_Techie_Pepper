2008-11-12T02:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	what video card do you have ?
2008-11-12T02:29:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	some nvidea dedicated with 64 megs of ram
2008-11-12T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	I ask as a common cause for visual lag is the wrong drivers for nvidia cards
2008-11-12T02:30:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	how can I check my graphics card again?
2008-11-12T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	your on 8.10 ?
2008-11-12T02:31:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	I even think it doesn't utilize the GPU AT ALL
2008-11-12T02:31:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	yes I am
2008-11-12T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	if you open hardware drivers from system -> administration does it show any nvidia drivers in use
2008-11-12T02:31:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	no
2008-11-12T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	ahhh that could be the issue
2008-11-12T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	does it show any as available but not in use ?
2008-11-12T02:32:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	no
2008-11-12T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	which card is it exactly (if you know)
2008-11-12T02:32:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	I don't :( i could boot into windowz and find out
2008-11-12T02:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	that would be with it in my opinion
2008-11-12T02:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	it's a common cause of slow visual
2008-11-12T02:34:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	I agree 100% as I suspected from the begining my GPU isn't working as it should, but how do I get the right driveR?
2008-11-12T02:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Dominik314	lets find out the card, then we can work onthat
2008-11-12T02:34:00.000Z	Dominik314	ikonia	k ill switch to other machine
