2007-01-31T17:50:00.000Z	zbadone		any opionions on a Geforce 6200A agp for ubuntu?
2007-01-31T17:51:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	Any nVidia GeForce card should work just fine, if you don't mind using binary drivers
2007-01-31T17:52:00.000Z	zbadone		no problems with that, just looking to update  my older system just to get a little more life out of it, presently running a ti4200-64M
2007-01-31T17:52:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	this new card, for me, has 256M ram
2007-01-31T17:53:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	Then just use the nVidia drivers (from Multiverse I think), or do what I do and just download directly from nvidia.com and you should be all set :)
2007-01-31T17:53:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	having problem setting up Ubuntu with the older card
2007-01-31T17:53:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	What's going wrong?
2007-01-31T17:54:00.000Z	zbadone		its the drivers
2007-01-31T17:54:00.000Z	zbadone		got to use legacy
2007-01-31T17:54:00.000Z	zbadone		and its having prob with glx not loading
2007-01-31T17:55:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy
2007-01-31T17:55:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	its a new install of Ubuntu, I did that,but still haver prob with glx, and yes i did use glx-legacy
2007-01-31T17:56:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	hmm; so what is the error, or what happens?
2007-01-31T17:56:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	when i run glxinfo it segs with glx
2007-01-31T17:57:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	,not X but glxinfo fro mterm segs
2007-01-31T17:57:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	hmm; I hate to say it, but I'm kinda stumped now.  You could try to download the legacy drivers from nvidia.com and use nVidia's installer; that's what usually works for me
2007-01-31T17:58:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	I tried that but still segs from term when running glxinfo
2007-01-31T17:58:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	so Im looking to update card to a newer version
2007-01-31T17:58:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	Sorry then, I don't know what could be going wrong.  It *should* just work
2007-01-31T17:59:00.000Z	borgus	zbadone	(Disclaimer: IANAD [I am Not a Developer]  ;) )
2007-01-31T17:59:00.000Z	zbadone	borgus	I was hoping it would JUST work, BUT
