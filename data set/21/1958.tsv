2010-03-17T07:09:00.000Z	Jon-	thiefy	I just know on my moms old computer it rocks compared to GNOME, with xfce somewhere in between the two. It's nothing but the desktop manager, yes. I suppose less data caching of models? Older video cards appreciate less textures? More optimized for older systems? I don't know what exactly, but it runs less RAM/CPU than GNOME and things move around nicer.
