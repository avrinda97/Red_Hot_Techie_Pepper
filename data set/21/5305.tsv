2007-11-15T11:19:00.000Z	xivanari		ah i see.
2007-11-15T11:19:00.000Z	xivanari		very cool.
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		but unfortunately pretty useless to me.
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		yea...
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		well i have 1gb of ram on this machine
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		well but wine crashes my computer
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		forces me to log out very suddenly
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		then screws up all the text on the login screen
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		makes it huuuuuge
2007-11-15T11:20:00.000Z	xivanari		like size 72
2007-11-15T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	Are you running a 3D program in wine?
2007-11-15T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	How did you try to uninstall it?
2007-11-15T11:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	That doesn't uninstall wine, it uninstalls windows applications you have installed in wine
2007-11-15T11:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	.nzb, that's a usenet binary, correct?
2007-11-15T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	I think it is, in which case there are Linux apps that can extract it
2007-11-15T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	sudo apt-get install nzb
2007-11-15T11:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	You might as well use a native solution
2007-11-15T11:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	I would still trust nzb ( a native linux application ) more than an app running in wine
2007-11-15T11:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	Yes, "sudo apt-get install nzb"
2007-11-15T11:28:00.000Z	xivanari	Jordan_U_	 is that a cli command?
2007-11-15T11:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	xivanari	Yes
