2009-04-24T06:52:00.000Z	H3XC		Where can i get macbookpro help?
2009-04-24T06:53:00.000Z	H3XC		jamieleshaw... i am in the same boat as you

2009-04-24T06:54:00.000Z	H3XC		lol
2009-04-24T06:56:00.000Z	H3XC		anyone have any problems installing 64bit other than me?
2009-04-24T06:57:00.000Z	H3XC		yes
2009-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	What are you seeing again?  I had some issues with the alternate install.
2009-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	I get to the install menu and the only selection i can make is to boot from main disk
2009-04-24T06:59:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	Do you have an IDE CD Rom?
2009-04-24T06:59:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	this is in a laptop. macbookpro3,1.. prettysure it is sata
2009-04-24T07:02:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	are you there?
2009-04-24T07:02:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	yeah
2009-04-24T07:03:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	why does it matter if my cd rom drive is connected ide or sata?
2009-04-24T07:03:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	Might be fixed now, but for 8.04 I had to buy a SATA cd rom.  The ide controller on my motherboard wasn't supported by the installer.
2009-04-24T07:04:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	well.. it is internal on mac hardware.. i am pretty sure it is sata.. but would an external usb work?
2009-04-24T07:05:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	external might work.  Worth a shot if you have one available.
2009-04-24T07:05:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	i am on the machine right now with the 32bit version.. are the installers that different?
2009-04-24T07:06:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	I'm not sure.  I have to use the alternate installer since I have a software RAID 5.
2009-04-24T07:07:00.000Z	H3XC	jonmartini	i will download the alternate installer and try that... cuz i know my laptop support 64bit... thanks for your help
2009-04-24T07:08:00.000Z	jonmartini	H3XC	 good luck
