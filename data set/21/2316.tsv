2010-01-04T04:26:00.000Z	Wavesonics		Can I upgrade my filesystem while it is mounted?
2010-01-04T04:27:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	what do you mean by upgrading a filesystem?
2010-01-04T04:27:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	I'm upgrading my ext3 to ext4
2010-01-04T04:28:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	I already ran:
2010-01-04T04:28:00.000Z	Wavesonics		tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/md0, and now when running fsck -pf /dev/md0, i get the following: WARNING!!!  Running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem may cause
2010-01-04T04:28:00.000Z	Wavesonics		SEVERE filesystem damage.
2010-01-04T04:28:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	oh?
2010-01-04T04:29:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	to fsck a mounted partition is dangerous]
2010-01-04T04:29:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	damn, i don't have a live CD
2010-01-04T04:29:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	 to a "sudo touch /forcefsck" and then reboot,
2010-01-04T04:30:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	ok thanks!
2010-01-04T04:30:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	that will force your system to check your partitions, but alas, I am not sure about your specialist options to e2fsck
2010-01-04T04:31:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	the options are -f to force which is good, and -p to auto repair, so at the very least i'll be asked to do the repairs it hink right?
2010-01-04T04:31:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	FYI, "sudo touch /fastboot" will make your system to bypass routine fsck checks of filesystems
2010-01-04T04:32:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	ah ok cool, thanks
2010-01-04T04:32:00.000Z	Wavesonics		well hhmm
2010-01-04T04:32:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	wish i had a damn live CD, hey, would a much older live CD work? like 7.04?
2010-01-04T04:33:00.000Z	Wavesonics	mka	probably not... i bet this has special ext4 stuff... :/
2010-01-04T04:33:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	yes it can
2010-01-04T04:33:00.000Z	Wavesonics		u think?
2010-01-04T04:33:00.000Z	mka	Wavesonics	no I dont think so, sorry
