2006-03-01T16:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	pianoboy3333	what are you looking for?  w32 indicates its a windows app or something like w32codecs
2006-03-01T16:28:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	gnomefreak	I was told that the package mingw32 was a cross compiler for C/C++ as it says in synaptic, but I don't know how to call/use it
2006-03-01T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	pianoboy3333	that im not sure about but you will more than likey have to make the ide use it like you would with the export command
2006-03-01T16:30:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	gnomefreak	but in the terminal, mingw32 doesn't do anything
