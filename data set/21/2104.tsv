2010-01-19T08:45:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	do you have that binary driver installed?
2010-01-19T08:45:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	not sure
2010-01-19T08:45:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	you would know.. you'd have to download it from nvidia and manually install it.
2010-01-19T08:46:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	if you installed the driver supplied by ubuntu that I believe is version 185.xx
2010-01-19T08:47:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	i but i am trying to get my 1024x768 at least 100hz it support up to 120hz
2010-01-19T08:47:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	thats what resolution is supported at by my crt monitor
2010-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	so the resolution is ok.. it's just the refresh rate you're trying to improve?
2010-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	exactly
2010-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	i have been trying to force 120hz but looks like Ubuntu won't let me
2010-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	is there a specific reason other than "I want it too"?
2010-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	I live on 120hz for gaming
2010-01-19T08:51:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	then you might need to install the binary driver from nvidia to bring it up to current beta level.. you'll have to do some reading though on nvidia's site to see if that will happen with that driver and your specific card.. perhaps your card won't support it?
2010-01-19T08:51:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	oh my card support that
2010-01-19T08:52:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	then look into the latest driver..
2010-01-19T08:54:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	it may also be an xrandr setting you need to change
2010-01-19T08:55:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	xrandr setting, oh yes please.. can you help me with this one?
2010-01-19T08:55:00.000Z	scunizi	ice_stone	not much.. every time I need to change something I have to google for the answer.. it's still a foreign service to me.
2010-01-19T08:56:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	i have been googling all day
2010-01-19T08:56:00.000Z	ice_stone	scunizi	i wish there is simple command to add 120hz to my 1024x768 resolution...
