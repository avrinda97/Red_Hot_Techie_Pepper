2011-06-13T10:35:00.000Z	davef		Hi, I'm hoping someone can help me with getting my ethernet card connection to work. I have Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Just transferred my HD into an old P2 box after my motherboard crapped out. Eveything is working except I can't connect to the network or internet.
2011-06-13T10:36:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	what is the output of:  sudo lshw -C network    thanks
2011-06-13T10:36:00.000Z	davef	ActionPa1snip	thanks, just a sec...
2011-06-13T10:39:00.000Z	davef	ActionPa1snip	It is long, and I can't paste it as I'm on another box....
2011-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	what is the product line of the wired interface
2011-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	ok, and you are using the server OS (no X server)?
2011-06-13T10:41:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	Is it hardy desktop?
2011-06-13T10:41:00.000Z	davef	ActionPa1snip	not sure what you mean, I'm not terribly savy
2011-06-13T10:42:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	yes but do you have a mouse pointer and such, a desktop gui?
2011-06-13T10:43:00.000Z	davef	ActionPa1snip	When I try to run Firestarter I get eth1 is not ready
2011-06-13T10:43:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	do you use a desktop OS? With a mouse pointer to click things with?
2011-06-13T10:44:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	then your OS isn't supported now. Desktop support for Hardy died when Natty came out
2011-06-13T10:44:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	the only way Hardy i now supported is on the server
2011-06-13T10:44:00.000Z	davef	ActionPa1snip	sorry. its ubuntu 8.04 LTS
2011-06-13T10:45:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	yes, there is no desktop support for hardy
2011-06-13T10:45:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
2011-06-13T10:46:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	note how desktop support ie end of life
2011-06-13T10:47:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	it's not, the server is supported until 2013, the desktop isn't
2011-06-13T11:11:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	I suggest you upgrade or reinstall to at least Lucid
2011-06-13T11:11:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	davef	all earlier releases are no longer supported on the desktop
2011-06-13T11:13:00.000Z	davef	ActionPa1snip	well first I need to get connected, or else I'll have to order a CD by mail...
