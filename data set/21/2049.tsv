2010-02-07T07:56:00.000Z	hexmare		anyone having issues with karmic and nvidia graphics cards having low res?
2010-02-07T07:56:00.000Z	hexmare		airtronix :> what cards are you using?
2010-02-07T07:57:00.000Z	hexmare		Rick > I am finding that out. Laptop fires off no issue. Desktop , with 2 8800 gts, no go
2010-02-07T07:59:00.000Z	hexmare		Airtronix, running 2 8800gt on my desktop , and will only do 640x480
2010-02-07T08:01:00.000Z	hexmare		airtronix > 3 monitors
2010-02-07T08:02:00.000Z	hexmare		Airtronix > Only time I can get 1680x1050 is without nvidia drivers, and even then only 1 monitor
2010-02-07T08:02:00.000Z	hexmare		trying now
2010-02-07T08:02:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	is that with the drivers supplied by ubuntu or the latest/greatest from nvidia?
2010-02-07T08:06:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	make sure if you install that, that you uninstall the nvidia bits supplied by ubuntu
2010-02-07T08:08:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	no reboot necessary .. when you install the nvidia drivers you have to be at cli with gdm shutdown.. install then "sudo service gdm start" to bring graphics back up
2010-02-07T08:09:00.000Z	hexmare	scunizi	I had done that before I just tried with a reboot still no go
2010-02-07T08:09:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	I missed most of the previous conversation.. what are you trying to accomplish?
2010-02-07T08:10:00.000Z	hexmare	scunizi	, getting more then 640x480 out of my 8800gt graphics cards under karmic
2010-02-07T08:10:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	lcd monitor or crt?
2010-02-07T08:12:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	by 3?  three monitors? ok.. start with one leaving the others unplugged.. get that going first.. then add the next.. remember that there are really 2 different resolutions you're working with .. the size of X and the rez of each monitor.. X needs to be the size of the 3 put together.. xrandr handles a lot of that.. also nvidia-settings
2010-02-07T08:13:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	don't do it while the computer is booted..
2010-02-07T08:15:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	do you also have 2 video cards?
2010-02-07T08:17:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	that can also be an issue.. in the past, and still.. if you install with more than one monitor plugged in and more than one card things get goofy.. I think you're experiencing the "goofy" part of it.. you'll need to hand write a xorg most likely.. but if you don't have anything important on the machine.. get rid of one card and all but one monitor and reinstall.. then add one thing at a time..
2010-02-07T08:18:00.000Z	scunizi	hexmare	my feeling exactly... however if you want some reading.. check out.http://superuser.com/questions/65989/ubuntu-9-10-3-monitors-setup
2010-02-07T09:05:00.000Z	hexmare	scunizi	, in the middle of reinstall gotta love it
