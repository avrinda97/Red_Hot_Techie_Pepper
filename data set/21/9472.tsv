2007-11-26T01:22:00.000Z	musashi		I have set up RAID 1 (using nvidia onboard controller) and have installed the gutsy. However, i can't set the raid array to boot (there is an option but it's grayed out) and the system won't boot. any suggestions?
2007-11-26T01:23:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	nvidia's controllers are wha'ts called fake-raid controllers.
2007-11-26T01:23:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	does that change how i should set it up
2007-11-26T01:24:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	or explain why it's not working?
2007-11-26T01:24:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	is ubuntu's setup seeing the array?
2007-11-26T01:25:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	during install it sees sda and sdb but no mention of raid - should there be?
2007-11-26T01:25:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	a true raid controller would only be showing sda ...
2007-11-26T01:26:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	short of buying a true raid controller, is there a simple way to make this work? i just want a mirror for backup
2007-11-26T01:26:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	software raid
2007-11-26T01:27:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	meaning i should scrap the nvidia raid, set up normally and then install software raid? or would i still keep the nvidia setup set up?
2007-11-26T01:28:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	scrap the nvraid stuff.  during setup you can set up software raid fairly quick and painless
2007-11-26T01:29:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	shoot. i was hoping the nvidia stuff would be simple and cool - just doing it in the background. okay, are you saying that while installing gutsy i can also set up software raid? i've never seen an option for that.
2007-11-26T01:29:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	it's on the alternate cd
2007-11-26T01:30:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	is that the only way or can i install normally and then add the raid stuff afterwards? seeing as how it's already installed and i don't have the alternate cd :)
2007-11-26T01:31:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	you won't be able to add it later because it requires certain type of partitions...
2007-11-26T01:32:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	okay. guess i'll be downloading the alternate cd. one last question, is the software raid an okay way to go? i mean is it relatively stable and problem free running in the background or will i need to "mess" with it a lot?
2007-11-26T01:33:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	i've got a headless server with 3 disks in software raid5... been stable for a year now
2007-11-26T01:33:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	software raid is done in the background by the linux kernel... so if the kernel's relatively stable... then so will your raid :)
2007-11-26T01:35:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	cool. thanks for the help. i guess the raid controller on my edubuntu server at work is a fancy hardware controller. should have known that a $200 mobo wouldn't have the same
2007-11-26T01:35:00.000Z	Tidus	musashi	most sata raid chipsets aren't true raid.
2007-11-26T01:36:00.000Z	musashi	Tidus	i suppose you would need to buy a fancy controller. i'll go software and see what happens
