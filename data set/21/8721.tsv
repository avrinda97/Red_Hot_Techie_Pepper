2006-07-16T05:30:00.000Z	J-_		How can I get permissions to a .deb file after changing it from a .rpm to .deb?
2006-07-16T05:30:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	"changing" it like what?
2006-07-16T05:31:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	*how* did you change it from rpm into deb?
2006-07-16T05:31:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	and you're installing it with dpkg?
2006-07-16T05:31:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	what's the specific error?
2006-07-16T05:32:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	zcat[1]  is correct. avoid alien as much as you can
2006-07-16T06:40:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	excuse me, but my network went down while you were discussing the inkscape thing... what's the reason you're compiling it from source?
2006-07-16T06:42:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	oh, i see
2006-07-16T06:42:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	what kind of problems are you having?
2006-10-16T12:07:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	uh, yes, namely they're two totally different programs. the point they do have in common is that they're both word processors.
2006-12-29T08:43:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	lm-sensors
2006-12-29T08:44:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	then run "sensors-detect" as root to detect the sensors and tell you which kernel modules to load, and then "sensors" to actually see the values. then if you want there are several front-ends for both GNOME and KDE i believe
2006-12-29T08:45:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	thanks dude
2006-12-29T08:45:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	Yeah I'm getting conky running =D pretty sweet program!
2006-12-29T08:47:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	No i2c device files found. Use prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh to create them
2006-12-29T08:48:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	hm, yeah, that happens to some people... try "sudo modprobe i2c-dev"
2006-12-29T08:50:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	I did the command, no error, nothing came up. So I guess it's detected?
2009-03-31T22:48:00.000Z	LjL	J-_	not very, if the files aren't in the db, perhaps it just doesn't know them yet - and i get the shm stuff too i think, isn't it just hidden files?
2009-03-31T22:49:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	Not sure, just did the scan. I've updated rkhunter, too.
2009-03-31T22:49:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	No, they're not hidden
2009-03-31T22:52:00.000Z	J-_	LjL	Ah, /dev/shm is used as temp file storage.
