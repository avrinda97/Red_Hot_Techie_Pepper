2009-02-18T10:54:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	what laptop
2009-02-18T10:55:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	then ur hosed lol. BIOS and a reinstall sounds about right
2009-02-18T10:55:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	at least, that's how i would fix it.
2009-02-18T11:02:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	gnome-panel or panels is the process i believe
2009-02-18T11:02:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	it's gnome-panel
2009-02-18T11:04:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	if you end gnome-panel it should restart automagically
2009-02-18T11:05:00.000Z	quentusrex	pHreaksYcle	gnome-panels isn't running
2009-02-18T11:06:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	well, the obvious choice would be to start it with the command gnome-panel
2009-02-18T11:06:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	unless you have an objection to this for some reason?
2009-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	there's a way you can drop into a fullscreen one with Fsomething and another modifier key
2009-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	Ctrl-Alt-F2 will get you a command line, but it moves the whole screen to it
2009-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	so be sure you're set before you go
2009-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	quentusrex	pHreaksYcle	I did that... but that is no more help than the ssh session...
2009-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	what are you trying to do in the command line again? i missed that part
2009-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	quentusrex	pHreaksYcle	I'm trying to get a list of active displays
2009-02-18T11:37:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	lol
2009-02-18T11:59:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle	quentusrex	i see people recommend VLC for converting ETC but i never learned how to do anything like that. VLC just seems like a simple player to me
2009-02-18T11:59:00.000Z	quentusrex	pHreaksYcle	dig deeper
