2012-02-05T04:16:00.000Z	Cyquin		That's the one veryhappy
2012-02-05T04:17:00.000Z	Cyquin		I'm trying to install emacs at the moment and I keep getting errors through the software centre. e.g.  synchronize mmap - msync (28: No space left on device), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.
2012-02-05T04:17:00.000Z	Cyquin		I'm sure there is space on the drive though.
2012-02-05T04:19:00.000Z	Cyquin		all others have space
2012-02-05T04:20:00.000Z	Cyquin		aahhh.. makes sense now schuffle. mounted as root
2012-02-05T04:21:00.000Z	Cyquin		I am running ubuntui using WUBI
2012-02-05T04:21:00.000Z	Cyquin		I am guessing that it is hitting a limit on the virtual drive.
2012-02-05T04:23:00.000Z	Cyquin		I think i need to resize the file for ubuntu
2012-02-05T04:25:00.000Z	Cyquin		well said schnuffle.... Still haven't quite been convinced to throw windows away just yet. But I am preferring ubuntu.
2012-02-05T04:25:00.000Z	Cyquin		ok so would you suggest partitioning the drive the reinstall?
2012-02-05T04:25:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	you should not throw away windows.
2012-02-05T04:04:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	did you already try dpkg-reconfigure?
2012-02-05T04:08:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	give me a moment
2012-02-05T04:10:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	seems to have too less dependencies to remove the package as far i can see it
2012-02-05T04:15:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	Ubuntu Software Center?
2012-02-05T04:22:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	do you run it from windows?
2012-02-05T04:23:00.000Z	Cyquin	veryhappy	yes I have windows on the box as well, but since installing ubuntu  I haven't been using windows
2012-02-05T04:23:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	do you have gparted on your system?
2012-02-05T04:24:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	yes, schnuffle is right. better install it as a dual boot system.
2012-02-05T04:26:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	you should use a live cd from ubuntu resize the partition using gparted and then install ubuntu beside windows.
2012-02-05T04:27:00.000Z	veryhappy	Cyquin	you're welcome
