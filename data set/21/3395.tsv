2009-03-04T05:04:00.000Z	jwaldo		For some reason, I can't get the installer to use my free space: ï»¿http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3547/3326358951_de20690052_b.jpg
2009-03-04T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	use manual then :)
2009-03-04T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	no, use full manual
2009-03-04T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	use manual partitioning and you can use the unallocated space to make (at least) / and /swap
2009-03-04T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	thats fine if the unpartitioned space is what you wish to use
2009-03-04T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	if you want full control use manual again and you can create partitions as you like
2009-03-04T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	read the screen, the white bit is unallocated
2009-03-04T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	yes you need to click manual then click next
2009-03-04T05:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	not if manual is selected
2009-03-04T05:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	you need to create 2 partitions in that free space, / and /swp. make swp about 1Gb and use the rest for /
2009-03-04T05:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	looks fine
2009-03-04T05:53:00.000Z	jwaldo	ActionParsnip	So, next then?
2009-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	write the partitions to the disk and continue with the install
2009-03-04T05:59:00.000Z	jwaldo	ActionParsnip	Thanks for saving my newb hide again
2009-03-04T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	let the install do its thing, it will say when its done
2009-03-04T06:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	check the bootup settings
2009-03-04T06:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	whatever makes your pc boot
2009-03-04T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	check the bootup options in bios as well as the options in the bootloader, make sure its not using the ubuntu iso as boot
2009-03-04T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	or whatever
2009-03-04T06:24:00.000Z	jwaldo	ActionParsnip	It'd be odd if it was, since I pulled out the SD card when prompted to, before restart
2009-03-04T06:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jwaldo	strange, could try putting the card in and tell the card to boot from the hard drive
