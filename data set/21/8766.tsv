2008-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	joseph_		please help
2008-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	joseph_		Is this line correct , i'm following http://samanathon.com/how-to-install-microsoft-office-2007-in-ubuntu-804/
2008-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	joseph_		first line the terminal gets stuck
2008-10-02T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	That looks reasonable, yes.  The whole first blue thing is one line.
2008-10-02T13:10:00.000Z	joseph_	Flannel	the first line I input sudo wget -q http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -    it asks twice the pwd and gets stuck
2008-10-02T13:12:00.000Z	joseph_		ok
2008-10-02T13:16:00.000Z	joseph_		I still have problems installing wine   E: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2008-10-02T13:16:00.000Z	joseph_		E: Unable to lock the download directory
2008-10-02T13:16:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	close any other package managers you have open (update-manager, synaptic, other apt-gets, etc)
2008-10-02T13:17:00.000Z	joseph_	Flannel	thanks, had ultamatix on
2008-10-02T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	Ooooh
2008-10-02T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	NOOOOOO, you don't want that.  Get rid of it (even though its already broken your system)
2008-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	joseph_	Flannel	It has already :(
2008-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	I suggest reinstall.  Give yourself a system that works, and stay far, far away from *matix.
2008-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	joseph_		sigh
2008-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	joseph_		I started from Ubuntu ultimate ... and system died after a few days , now I use ultamatix thought it was a step forward
2008-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	don't do that either.  Use official Ubuntu.  Ultimate edition, ultamatix, are both horrible, horrible hackjobs.
2008-10-02T13:21:00.000Z	joseph_		my repositories is real mess.. If I could just sort them...
2008-10-02T13:21:00.000Z	joseph_		the apps that appear in synaptic do not appear in add/remove
2008-10-02T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	Just reinstall.  There's no way to get rid of the damage from ultamatix.
2008-10-02T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	joseph_	Also, add/remove isn't as comprehensive as synaptic, and never was designed to be.
