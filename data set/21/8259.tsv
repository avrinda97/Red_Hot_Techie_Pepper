2010-05-25T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	tweepcat	a.) have you used the driver manager in ubuntu ? b.) ubuntu/linux doesn't use "inf" files

2010-05-25T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	tweepcat	and what did that say ?

2010-05-25T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	tweepcat	the b43 driver is already in the kernel
2010-05-25T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	tweepcat	yo udon't need to install it
2010-05-25T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	tweepcat	that's a package manager, and as you don't need to install a package that would not find anything
