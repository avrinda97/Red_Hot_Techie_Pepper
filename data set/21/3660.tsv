2008-11-22T23:53:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	its an error accessing the filesystem
2008-11-22T23:54:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	you'll need to provide more details, please
2008-11-22T23:54:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	i gave everything
2008-11-22T23:54:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	never saw it.
2008-11-22T23:54:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	url?
2008-11-22T23:55:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	is there anyway that you can write it all down, exactly, into a pastebin somewhere?
2008-11-22T23:55:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	can i pm you?
2008-11-22T23:55:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	it's rather impossible to help with vague info
2008-11-22T23:55:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	no.
2008-11-22T23:57:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	again, details, please, otherwise we could be diagnosing the wrong problem.
2008-11-22T23:57:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	like what details?
2008-11-22T23:58:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	where do you see the I/O error show up?
2008-11-22T23:58:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	after i highlighted "Install Xubuntu" and pressed enter
2008-11-22T23:59:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	from what? the installation cd?
2008-11-22T23:59:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	yeah
2008-11-22T23:59:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	not a live disk though, just installer
2008-11-22T23:59:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	okay, are you typing on the same computer that you're trying to install it to?
2008-11-22T23:59:00.000Z	nintendork32	Gnea	no
2008-11-23T00:00:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	then I suggest that you try booting into the livecd and installing from there
2008-11-23T00:02:00.000Z	Gnea	nintendork32	g2g, good luck with that... if all else fails, try double-checking your drive cables, they might be bad
