2006-03-14T09:18:00.000Z	crouchingMonkey		i added all the repositories by following the wiki instructions but it doesnt seem to be working, can someone give me a hand ?
2006-03-14T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	/etc/apt/sources.list
2006-03-14T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	it depends on the package, and why it's broken
2006-03-14T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	paste the error from an apt-get -f install
2006-03-14T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	that is, sudo apt-get -f install
2006-03-14T09:53:00.000Z	crouchingMonkey	nickrud	i was trying to intall mplayer and im having some dependency problems
2006-03-14T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	that does not sound good; paste both the above, and the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-03-14T09:57:00.000Z	crouchingMonkey	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9883
2006-03-14T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	get rid of the warty repository, that's your problem
2006-03-14T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	otherwise, those sources are very nice
2006-03-14T09:59:00.000Z	crouchingMonkey	nickrud	i did that and i refreshed
2006-03-14T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	next, go to http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MplayerInstallHowto
2006-03-17T13:45:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	could you paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to a paste bin?
2006-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	you're missing a line: deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted
2006-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	also, you might want to comment out the cdrom line (put a # at the beginning)
2006-03-17T13:53:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	whups, change the dapper in that line to breezy
2006-03-17T14:03:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	good 
2006-03-21T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	in general, sudo apt-get -f install
2006-03-21T07:36:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	that's cool, what whas it again :)
2006-03-21T07:37:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	oh, -f install :)
2006-04-03T07:57:00.000Z	nickrud	crouchingMonkey	I usually do dd if=/dev/cdromX of=file.iso bs=1024
