2008-10-09T21:40:00.000Z	Pici	kri	ctrl-o
2008-10-09T21:40:00.000Z	Pici	kri	it says what the keys are on the bottom of the screen.
2008-10-09T21:40:00.000Z	kri	Pici	whats ctrl+j?
2008-10-09T21:41:00.000Z	Pici	kri	Justify.
2008-10-09T21:41:00.000Z	Pici	kri	And no, its not for checking code, its for justifying paragraphs.  nano/pico has no knowledge of what code is, its all just text.
2008-11-10T22:47:00.000Z	Pici	kri	Double click on them in Gnome.
2008-11-10T22:48:00.000Z	Pici	kri	That works too
2008-11-10T22:49:00.000Z	kri	Pici	what should i do after this dpkg -i command?
2008-11-10T22:49:00.000Z	Pici	kri	Run audacious?
2008-11-10T22:49:00.000Z	kri	Pici	dont i have to make? and make install before that?
2008-11-10T22:50:00.000Z	Pici	kri	No.  .debs are binaries in most cases, theres no need to compile.
2008-11-10T22:51:00.000Z	kri	Pici	ok good is there now the icecast2-plugin. BUT then when i try to install mplayer 'sudo apt-get install mplayer' will remove these lovelly _very_ necessary packages libmp3lame-dev~.deb and libmp3lame0-dev~... what to do to install mplayer now?
2008-11-10T22:52:00.000Z	Pici	kri	Is there a reason that you didn't install them from the repositories?
2008-11-10T22:52:00.000Z	kri	Pici	yes i needed the latest build (2.~0) audacious to get the plugins needed for icecast2 server.
2008-11-10T22:52:00.000Z	Pici	kri	mplayer depends on a different version of those packages that are in the repos.
