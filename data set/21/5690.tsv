2007-10-10T13:22:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	what ever do you mean
2007-10-10T13:23:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	how do you know that?
2007-10-10T13:25:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	and how do you know that its only using 32mb in ubuntu?
2007-10-10T13:26:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	sharp? that has to do with your video codecs not your video ram
2007-10-10T13:27:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	u can try running lspci and see what it detects
2007-10-10T13:27:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	there ya go, heguru has your answer
2007-10-10T13:28:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	from terminal type lspci
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	i have ubuntu feisty (modified) on my 2gb usb pendrive
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	yea its pretty nifty, the modified version of it allows it to be persistent, so it runs like a normal ubuntu, rather than like a liveCD
2007-10-12T11:46:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	what are u talking about?
2007-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	Evanlec	lee__	shrek is right, u cant just "upgrade" to 64-bit , it wont work
