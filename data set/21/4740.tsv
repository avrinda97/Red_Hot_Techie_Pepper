2008-02-23T21:30:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bazhang	even tho gentoo is harder, once you get it going perfectly, its 100x sexier
2008-03-05T13:24:00.000Z	bazhang	TrustNoOne	did you configwine or wineconfig (forgot the command) first?
2008-03-05T13:25:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bazhang	no i did "wine iexplore "url"" to open iexplore, then i go "wine start steaminstall.msi"
2008-03-05T13:25:00.000Z	bazhang	TrustNoOne	you need to config wine the first time you run it iirc
2008-03-05T13:26:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bazhang	i have installed apps with wine before, its not the first time i run it
2008-03-13T10:19:00.000Z	bazhang	TrustNoOne	why even bother with azureus? it is really a memory hog, and unstable as well--there are several other options such as deluge ktorrent, transmission; even utorrent under wine is better imo
2008-03-13T10:21:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bazhang	i do not have memory issues or unstable issues with azureus, i use it because its easy to configure port forwarding for it, and to disable DHT and decentralized tracking for my private sites, and it is one of the clients approved by my private tracker, i can not use anything not in the "approved list" and frankly transmission is not up-to-par with azureus, so i choose azureus over transmission which is one of their other
2008-03-13T10:23:00.000Z	bazhang	TrustNoOne	okay well one mans pleasure is another mans poison; transmission second to azureus--I just had some very bad experiences with that app and transmission has been superb--sorry not to help you out there
2008-03-13T10:24:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bazhang	well of course, if you have a bad experience with something you deem it "crap", i mean i did that with xbox 360... so its understandable... but if it works for some, i guess thats good for them right? :)
2008-03-13T10:24:00.000Z	bazhang	TrustNoOne	no doubt; and sorry to badmouth your favorite--no offense meant--I'm just sorry I cant help you out here
2008-03-13T10:25:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	bazhang	yeah thats ok
2008-03-13T10:26:00.000Z	bazhang	TrustNoOne	okay cool
