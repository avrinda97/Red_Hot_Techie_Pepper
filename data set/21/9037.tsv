2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		hey
2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		i just cant seem to win
2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		i got a new video card, reinstalled ubuntu, and now it hangs up trying to load gdm
2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		i see the mouse cursor
2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		i can move it
2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		but the keyboard is locked
2007-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	ComPro		i cant even switch to a tty
2007-11-26T07:20:00.000Z	ComPro		my keyboard isnt being detected and it's locking my boot process once gdm tries to load
2007-11-26T07:21:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	who needs a keyboard, anyway?
2007-11-26T07:21:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	try letting the boot get past that point and then plugging in the keyboard.  Not a solution, but might get us into the machine to look at logs
2007-11-26T07:21:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	otherwise boot a live cd and mount the file system so we can look for info in logs.
2007-11-26T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	then we need to check your keyboard specifications in /etc/xorg.conf
2007-11-26T07:22:00.000Z	ComPro	sethk	im in xorg.conf righ tnow
2007-11-26T07:23:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	look for   Section "InputDevice"
2007-11-26T07:23:00.000Z	ComPro	sethk	everything looks ok...identifier generic keyboard, driver kbd,, options of xorg, pc105, and us
2007-11-26T07:23:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	what type of keyboard?  usb?  ps/2?
2007-11-26T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	see if there is anything in the bios like "support legacy usb keyboard".  If so, tell me whether it is on or off
2007-11-26T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	ok
2007-11-26T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	try booting in recovery mode, and let's see if there is anything useful in the X log file.
2007-11-26T07:27:00.000Z	ComPro	sethk	there is nothing of any relevance in the log file
2007-11-26T07:27:00.000Z	sethk	ComPro	I'm running out of even bad ideas.
