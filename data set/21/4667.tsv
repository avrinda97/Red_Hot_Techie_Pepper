2008-03-07T01:46:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles		eatatjoes2, im back :)
2008-03-07T01:47:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	so should i proceed with the install?
2008-03-08T05:14:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	hey i finally just went ahead and formatted my internal HD into 2 paritions and used one for XP and one for Ubuntu since i found out my laptop doesnt allow 'boot from usb' which could explain our problem. But do you have a list of good apps for Linux and/or how to actually install stuff in linux?
2008-03-08T05:14:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	LOL! nice to see you back dude! so THATS why you had error 21?
2008-03-08T05:14:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 haha yeah
2008-03-08T05:15:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	so simple, yet so hard to detect
2008-03-08T05:15:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	you can install stuff in Linux by either downloading a Ubuntu .deb file, or use apt-get in a terminal emulator :)
2008-03-08T05:16:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	you can even install .rpm's :)
2008-03-08T05:16:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 thanks, do u have any websites on "linux for idiots" and any for good apps for linux
2008-03-08T05:17:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 for example a good IRC program (since i'm using chatzilla right now)
2008-03-08T05:17:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	i personally use X-chat for IRC stuff
2008-03-08T05:18:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	'good apps' is very subjective to my personal taste :) open source is all about choice! so embrace being able to choose
2008-03-08T05:18:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 okay thats why i was wondering on the whole install thing cause i was having issues installing x chat earlier
2008-03-08T05:19:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	what kind of issues? :)
2008-03-08T05:20:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	then clicked the "fedora/linux" and all the rpms are dead links i think?
2008-03-08T05:23:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 i keep getting a "XML Parsing Error: syntax error"
2008-03-08T05:24:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	dont mind the trolls, they appear every now and again and jump on people for illegitimate reasons :)
2008-03-08T05:24:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	try using sudo apt-get install xchat from a terminal
2008-03-08T05:24:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 haha thanks, but i cant even download stuff keep getting "XML Parsing Error: syntax error" when i click any downloads
2008-03-08T05:25:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	eatatjoes2	thats more than likely the site you're downloading from
2008-03-08T05:25:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	NinjaPlimsoles	 okay
