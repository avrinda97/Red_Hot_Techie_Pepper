2005-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	balfour		I'm trying to make a disk image of /dev/hdb, which may have been partially formatted, and I'm trying to move said image onto /home/theblue on /dev/hda1. I'm using the Hoary Live CD, as I don't want to screw up my normal Breezy configuration, and I want the image to be copied to the home folder on the Breezy installation.  Does anyone know how I would go about doing this?
2005-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	balfour		And would "sudo cat /dev/hdb > ??????" work?
2005-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	balfour		Because you have to stay in #freenode for a while to get to be able to talk.
2005-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	balfour		So no one can tell me how to image a drive using Hoary Live?
2005-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	dd
2005-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	dd if=/dev/hdb of=??
2005-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	where ever you have room for it file.img
2005-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	How do I get it to dump the .img file to my HD-installed Breezy ~ folder?
2005-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	I'm using the live CD, it'll go to the one on the CD, won't it?
2005-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	Or the ramdisk?
2005-11-18T09:09:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	like 'dd if=/dev/hdb of=/media/hda/file.img '   or where ever your hd is mounted.
2005-11-18T09:10:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	But I'm not sure where its mounted, and there's nothing in /media.
2005-11-18T09:10:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	' df '    or     'mount '   either should tell you.
2005-11-18T09:12:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	also if you know that your hd is hda but it's not mounted you can 'fdisk /dev/hda -l ' to list the partitions on hda...  then mount it some place with 'sudo mount /dev/hda# /mount/point '
2005-11-18T09:14:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	And is there a utility to undelete files?
2005-11-18T09:16:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	there may be other ways...  best to not remove things you want to keep.
2005-11-18T09:16:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	No, many things were accidentally deleted by Asterisk@Home setup, is there a way to get anything at all back?
2005-11-18T09:17:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	if they were rm'd and things added after that probably not.
2005-11-18T09:17:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	Nothing was added afterwards, it was just rm'd.
2005-11-18T09:18:00.000Z	intelikey	balfour	then yes,  but as to how to i'll have to back out on that and say good luck.
2005-11-18T09:18:00.000Z	balfour	intelikey	Um, thanks.
