2009-12-25T04:32:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		i have clam installed already
2009-12-25T04:32:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	if you want Anti-Virus reviews I suggest you Google the phrase "Linux Anti-Virus app review" and sift through that info.  There is no "best" app, it's all subjective that way.  Hope that helps.
2009-12-25T04:34:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	I use Firestarter for a firewall.
2009-12-25T04:36:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Hydrosis	that site did it
2009-12-25T04:37:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	are you saying a site opened a bunch of windows on you?  Avoid that site and never return.  There's not much you can do to avoid that, unless you hack the hell out of your box.
2009-12-25T04:39:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	sounds like a 1-time fluke.  Like I suggested, avoid that site and dont worry about it again unless you want to turn off Java.
2009-12-25T05:15:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	no, but usually it will work.
2009-12-25T05:17:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	Urban Terror works on all Ubuntu installs that I have ever used.  Get the game and have fun, it's the best FPS for Linux, in my opinion.
2009-12-25T05:18:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Hydrosis	ok , here i go ...
2009-12-25T05:21:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Hydrosis	got an error - Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: urbanterror-data (>= 4.1)
2009-12-25T05:22:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	I just said that the offical UrbanTerror site is down, so maybe you're trying to grab files from a dead server.
2009-12-25T05:23:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Hydrosis	you mean my version is too old?
2009-12-25T05:27:00.000Z	Hydrosis	JoeSomebody	- http://www.urbanterror.net/page.php?6
2009-12-25T05:27:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Hydrosis	i am on 9.10
2009-12-25T05:30:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Hydrosis	my first download was too quick (said complete but lied i think) this one should work 3% so far
