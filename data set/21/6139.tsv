2007-05-27T12:04:00.000Z	jcboi		i am back with another question... how do i install grub manually without using livecd or alternate cd? thanks!
2007-05-27T12:04:00.000Z	jcboi		anyone!
2007-05-27T12:05:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	can you boot the box?
2007-05-27T12:05:00.000Z	jcboi		n2diy:erm, currently, nope
2007-05-27T12:06:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	???? no idea, maybe add a second disk drive that is bootable?
2007-05-27T12:07:00.000Z	jcboi		n2diy:erm, i am currently using a windows bootloader, so i plan to install a grub on my usb hardisk(with ubuntu) so that i will boot the usb hardisk when i want ubuntu.... is it possible???
2007-05-27T12:08:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	I don't know, none of my boxes will boot from USB, but I am all ears now.
2007-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	jcboi	n2diy	i can't even install ubuntu with the cd on my own comp, but i now have a  default installation on my usb disk
2007-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	n2diy		I'm running Dapper here on my desktop, and sometimes it takes over a minute for the screen saver to give me control of my box. Mouse clicks, and hitting the space bar doesn't wake it up. Ideas?
2007-05-27T12:13:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	Boot the CD, and click on the install icon, on the desktop.
2007-05-27T12:14:00.000Z	jcboi	n2diy	i can't run the cd, my comp hangs upon loading th ubuntu screen
2007-05-27T12:14:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	While booting from the CD?
2007-05-27T12:15:00.000Z	jcboi		brokencrystal_:f6? , n2diy: i can't boot up ubuntu... it just loves to hang on my comp when using cd, that is why i am looking for alernative ways to install grub
2007-05-27T12:16:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	Have you tried the boot options, like nodma, noacpi etc...?
2007-05-27T12:18:00.000Z	jcboi		n2diy:i guess i am using an alternate cd...i see a screen with various options.....
2007-05-27T12:18:00.000Z	jcboi		do i press f6 and just type them in?
2007-05-27T12:19:00.000Z	n2diy	jcboi	Try the options! BrokenCrystal_, thanks for the flowers. :)
