2012-05-03T01:40:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	: if i set my grub to quiet splash, my laptop becomes blank/black screen
2012-05-03T01:41:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	: i have always to edit my grub into nomodeset, if i want my screen not black/blank
2012-05-03T01:42:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	do you understand my problem?
2012-05-03T01:43:00.000Z	mohd	acer-ubuntu	then , you need to change that in GRUB so that it'll automatically be appllied on each reboot .
2012-05-03T01:44:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	yes
2012-05-03T01:52:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	do you have solution?
2012-05-03T01:56:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	are you still there?
2012-05-03T02:00:00.000Z	mohd	acer-ubuntu	sudo gedit /etc/default/grub .. find the line : GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"  , and replace it whith GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset" . save the change then do sudo update-grub .
2012-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	i know its the way to set my default grub into nomodeset right?
2012-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	mohd	acer-ubuntu	Right.
2012-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	but what i need is not that
2012-05-03T02:02:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	i need my ubuntu can viewed in quiet splash
2012-05-03T02:03:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	nomodeset is low graphic, and my screen looks like stretched, i don't like that
2012-05-03T02:04:00.000Z	mohd	acer-ubuntu	i don't understand ! you said quiet splash gives a blank/black screen ..
2012-05-03T02:04:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	correct
2012-05-03T02:04:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu	mohd	so?
2012-05-03T02:05:00.000Z	mohd	acer-ubuntu	so , do the same from my last post , but add quiet splash !
