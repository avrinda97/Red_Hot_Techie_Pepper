2008-05-29T18:48:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n		UGH this is making me crazy.. i'm in hardy heron.. i have a file that is listed in the trash can.. but it won't let me delete it.. gives me an error "No such file or directory" and if i navigate to the trash in terminal.. that file isn't there for me to remove it there..
2008-05-29T18:49:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n		myrtti.. yah i got there just fine in terminal
2008-05-29T18:50:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	You did "ls -al" to show everything?
2008-05-29T18:50:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	yes
2008-05-29T18:51:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	And out of curiousity, what is the file name? Or do you know anything else about the file?
2008-05-29T18:52:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	 its a funky named torrent file
2008-05-29T18:53:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	it was a torrent i downloaded.. used and got what i wanted.. then deleted
2008-05-29T18:54:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	Well, try searching your entire HD for it:   find / -iname "theexactname.torrent" -print
2008-05-29T18:56:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	When you say "funky named", does it have special characters or something? What is the name exactly? Can you share it here?
2008-05-29T18:57:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	find / -iname _=Demonoid.com=_-The_Tipping_Point_By_Maclom_Gladwell_UNABRIDGED_1789044.435.torrent
2008-05-29T18:57:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	and that produced nothing
2008-05-29T18:59:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	Please copy and paste exactly, try this:
2008-05-29T19:01:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	i think i found the problem.. but it still won't resolve.. its located on an exterior hard drive in the folder called trash-1000   but if i delete it there.. it just reappears... i can move it OUT of that folder.. and my trash clears up.. but if i move it to the trash from somewhere else.. it just goes back to trash-1000 and repeats
2008-05-29T19:02:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	I got it.. finally.. i had to cut it from trash-1000.. move it to the main space of the HD.. then move it to my main home directory.. delete it there... aaaannnd then it finally deletes
2008-05-29T19:03:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	Sounds like you may need to exorcise your HD. What a crazy problem, but glad you finally were able to delete that file. :)
2008-05-29T19:03:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	LOL thanks.. apparantly just talking to you made me figure it out.. tech support magic :-D
2008-05-29T19:04:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	I guess so, and in the future you should mention that you have more than one HD... that is quite relevant. :)
2008-05-29T19:05:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	i do have a dumb question for you tho... i came from windows and was quite proficient.. i can navigate in terminal pretty well.... BUT i don't know the command to go BACK a directory... just typing cd or cd.. takes me all the way back to the home directory and i have to start over
2008-05-29T19:05:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	No problem, I know how you feel. :) The command to go up one directory is "cd .." note the space.
2008-05-29T19:07:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Steve-cal	thank you!!!
2008-05-29T19:07:00.000Z	Steve-cal	jayde_drag0n	No problem, I came from Windows too, so I know how you feel.
