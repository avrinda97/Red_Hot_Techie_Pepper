2008-03-14T21:24:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	any ideas on where I should look at
2008-03-14T21:19:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	a video card or monitor that can't handle it
2008-03-14T21:20:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	debian slackware suse LFS etc all work fine. its not the hardware...
2008-03-14T21:20:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	i don't know your setup so it's difficult to say why
2008-03-14T21:21:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	I tried removing usplash (had to make an equivs package so ubuntu-desktop didn't throw-up) and also passed 'nosplash' - no change.
2008-03-14T21:21:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	laptop with an ati radeon IGP
2008-03-14T21:21:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	ali chipset, if that helps at all
2008-03-14T21:21:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	oh, ati.... yeeeeah.... hrm..
2008-03-14T21:21:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	yea... i agree with you on that one :)
2008-03-14T21:22:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	is it listed anywhere on www.linux-laptop.net ?
2008-03-14T21:23:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	don't know. I think its something with the kernel config, no kernels I've built (and no other distros Ive tried) have had this issue. Also, ubuntu is the only one I've seen with mangled color pallettes on the consoles also
2008-03-14T21:24:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	weird - just follow the white rabbit on that site.  have you tried all fiesty/gutsy/hardy?
2008-03-14T21:25:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	this is new to 7.10 (not sure what name) - all previous were fine
2008-03-14T21:26:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	linux-generic if that helps (amd64 at home)
2008-03-14T21:26:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	7.10 is gutsy gibbon, and 8.04 is hardy herring (the new beta)
2008-03-14T21:26:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	i'd give 8.04 a shot and see what happens
2008-03-14T21:28:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	Don't know... I can try it. Oh! Debian Sid works too... that's what makes me think it might be an ubuntu-specific patch or something? (i remember them breaking AT keyboards completely to 'optimize' USB keyboards at boot)
2008-03-14T21:28:00.000Z	draeath	_Scooter_	thanks for the assist though
2008-03-14T21:29:00.000Z	_Scooter_	draeath	yeah, ubuntu is geared more toward newer equipment, so that doesn't surprise me too much.  yw and good luck
