2006-02-24T07:59:00.000Z	MasterC		hi
2006-02-24T08:00:00.000Z	MasterC		I am trying to install vncserver on dapper drake manually, beacause the package is broken. is vncserver tightvnc?
2006-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	tightvnc is one of the vncserver releases
2006-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	MasterC	sethk	so I have to install tightvnc?
2006-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	there are several to choose from.  that one is a good as any
2006-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	MasterC		okay :)
2006-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	I don't like vnc much, but from what I've heard tightvnc is a good distro of vnc
2006-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	MasterC	sethk	I neet it for screen recording

2006-02-24T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	it's probably ok for that, although there are surely better ways
2006-02-24T08:04:00.000Z	MasterC	sethk	what are the better ways? tell me plz :)
2006-02-24T08:04:00.000Z	MasterC	sethk	flash output would be nice
2006-02-24T08:04:00.000Z	MasterC		I know istanbull, but this ogg I think
2006-02-24T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	I would just capture the network traffic.  Everything that happens on an X display goes through a connection to port 6000
2006-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	MasterC	sethk	yes, but I want to have a video
2006-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	MasterC	sethk	and I dont want t have such a big video
2006-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	that just means you have to render it again.  But it is probably more complicated than you want to deal with.
2006-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	MasterC		only 800*600
2006-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	if vnc does what you need, try it.
2006-02-24T08:06:00.000Z	MasterC		yes
2006-02-24T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	MasterC	but it has such poor performance, I have my doubts about it capturing video
