2009-07-04T06:15:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		so that I can put IceWM on it
2009-07-04T06:15:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		but still use sudo, since I like that format
2009-07-04T06:15:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		is there a way to get absolute minimum as a free CD?
2009-07-04T06:15:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		oh
2009-07-04T06:16:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		I only have 1 6GB hard drive available for Linux ><
2009-07-04T06:16:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		hm....I could do that
2009-07-04T06:16:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		but then I would have to murder my puppy Linux
2009-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		cool
2009-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		but then I would be torn between Puppy and Ubuntu XD
2009-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	Batmanifestdesti		wait....is there a way to get Ubuntu onto the thumbdrive and ahve persstence?
2009-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 if my hardware can handle it.. i use Ubuntu.. if it is the old box's i use puppy.
2009-07-04T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 yes.. you can do a persistatn live-cd type setup on a flashdrive
2009-07-04T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 theres can be some quirks.. but its doable.. even doable from windows. following the pendrivelinux.org docs. (that works better for me then the usb-disk tool In ubuntu)
2009-07-04T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 depends on the apps. :)
2009-07-04T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 im in #puppylinux right now.
2009-07-04T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 oh the huge-manatee of having to look for somthing! :)
2009-07-04T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 my del.icio.us homepage has a large list of puppy-links to pets.
2009-07-04T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 as i said.. i use what the hardware can run. :)
2009-07-04T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 go to #puppylinux - state the exact specs.. and see what we suggest.
2009-07-04T06:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 use 'lspci' and   other tools from Ubuntu to discover them :)
2009-07-04T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Batmanifestdesti	 'tiny core linux' is also handy for small low end systems
