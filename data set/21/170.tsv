2012-07-14T09:15:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	lsb_release -sc
2012-07-14T09:15:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	in a terminal... I wanted you to type that.
2012-07-14T09:18:00.000Z	Dailycomputing	L3top	it says error no such option
2012-07-14T10:07:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	sudo fdisk -l   in pastebin please.
2012-07-14T10:12:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	-l not -1
2012-07-14T10:18:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	remove and reinsert the drive, and give run the command again.
2012-07-14T10:20:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	I find your hardware suspect, or your OS itself is flakish. Remove the drive, reboot the machine plug the drive in, do not open it if prompted.
2012-07-14T10:21:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	once the machine is up pastebin sudo fdisk -l    and pastebin sudo mount
2012-07-14T10:21:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	did you try this drive in another machine
2012-07-14T10:25:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	not to be incredibly elementary... but... is the lock tab switched?
2012-07-14T10:25:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	on the sd itself
2012-07-14T10:26:00.000Z	Dailycomputing	L3top	in windows
2012-07-14T10:29:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	please give me the output of the commands I gave you, and we will do just that.
2012-07-14T10:29:00.000Z	Dailycomputing	L3top	ubuntus still booting
2012-07-14T10:36:00.000Z	L3top	Dailycomputing	I am tired. It has been over ten minutes since you set to reboot. When it comes up, check sudo fdisk -l   and I expect that it will be /dev/sdb1 where it lives. Then check in mount and make sure it is not there (mounted). Then mkdosfs -I -F32 /dev/sdb1       assuming it is where I expect it.
