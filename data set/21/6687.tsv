2007-02-18T14:00:00.000Z	SoulinEther		how does ubuntu / gnome handle CD's being inserted? i'm looking at my fstab...
2007-02-18T14:02:00.000Z	SoulinEther		I bet Canonical would sue you in 5 minutes :P
2007-02-18T14:02:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	sue over call center?
2007-02-18T14:02:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	hey, I would :P
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	why sue?  It's GPL software... you can sell support
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	I'd feel shafted that's why :)
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	canonical got it for free... they get to redistribute and sell support... you can do the same
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	yep i know :)
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	just making up stories. it's better than wondering how the heck i get this dvd drive to work
2007-02-18T14:04:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	what is wrong with it?
2007-02-18T14:04:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	i installed it into my pc after i put on ubuntu, i need to add some info into fstab, not sure if it will work either.
2007-02-18T14:05:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	I wish I knew the answer to that one, but the only DVD I've ever played on this thing is Knoppix 4.0
2007-02-18T14:05:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	do you reckon I can just copy the line I have here for my DVD burner at /dev/hdc and use it, instead replacing /dev/hdd, well, hum.
2007-02-18T14:06:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	I'm not sure...
2007-02-18T14:06:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	it's just, i need to have it mounted.. well, I'll try this, there shouldnt be too big harm made
2007-02-18T14:06:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	if it works I'll.... start a 1$/minute support system and make millions :P
2007-02-18T14:18:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	that is a lifesaver too lol
2007-02-18T14:20:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	I think Ubuntu tops XP... no problem
2007-02-18T14:28:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	i have noticed some installs using wine to take extended amounts of time, i can't tell you exactly, but running it will probably be full speed
2007-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	rb007	SoulinEther	It's "writing registry values" -- kind of funny... hanging up at this point for a while
2007-02-18T14:29:00.000Z	SoulinEther	rb007	oh, hum, I had issues with extracting files
