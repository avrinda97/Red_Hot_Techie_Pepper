2005-06-27T14:35:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	you here?
2005-06-27T14:36:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	you need to set the WEP key in the interfaces file.
2005-06-27T14:37:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	less /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/wireless-tools
2005-06-27T14:37:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	that script is what parses added options set in /etc/network/interfaces that control WIFI settings.
2005-06-27T14:38:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- does it end up calling iwconfig?
2005-06-27T14:38:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	you can get the correct names from there and by reading the "man interfaces" to learn how it translates from what's typed in "interfaces" to a shell environment variable name...
2005-06-27T14:39:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- isn't that the long way of doing: # iwconfig eth1 essid "Library Wireless" key s:petoskeypublb
2005-06-27T14:41:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- yes...
2005-06-27T14:41:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	I don;t think you understand me, but I will follow your instructjions ;)
2005-06-27T14:42:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	Look in /usr/share/doc/wireless-tools at the README.Debian.
2005-06-27T14:47:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- read over readme.debian... what next?
2005-06-27T14:49:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
2005-06-27T14:49:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	sudo ifup wlan0
2005-06-27T14:49:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	You can do it!  Next release will have a much nicer way of doing that...
2005-06-27T14:50:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	Hey, come to think of it, there IS a gui for that now.  I've been editting conffiles for so long I forget about the new tools.
2005-06-27T14:50:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	You can use the network configuration tool on the System --> Administration menu, I think.
2005-06-27T14:50:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- yeah, but the current gui doesnt expose the errors, it jsut closed the dialog like everyint is OK
2005-06-27T14:51:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	Ah.  so use the "sudo ifup" from the command line, and see the error printouts.  You might find the errors from the tool in ~/.xsession-errors too.
2005-06-27T14:52:00.000Z	karlheg	CarlK	Ok, I gotta go back to work.  Good luck.
2005-06-27T14:52:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- thanks anyway
2005-06-27T14:52:00.000Z	CarlK	karlheg	- Ill be testing the new gui's ;)
