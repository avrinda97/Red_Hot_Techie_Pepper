2012-08-03T00:14:00.000Z	maplesoft		sudo apt-get remove packeg  sometimes keeps some traces of that package.     how to completely remove a package removing all traces?
2012-08-03T00:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	"sudo apt-get purge foo" is shorter ;)
2012-08-07T02:22:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	an all other apps like firefox will know about it?
2012-08-07T02:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	no, but if it's a source compile, then you can at least remove it cleanly (if you use checkinstall)
2012-08-07T02:23:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	arnt there some normal proceedures like, untaring the app in the /bin directory?
2012-08-07T02:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	adding stuff manually to /bin will work - but isn't really a good idea
2012-08-07T02:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	this DOESN'T answer your question - but things outside of repo are often placed in /opt (but that's not in PATH by default)
2012-08-07T02:33:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	i thought it was /bin somewhere?
2012-08-07T02:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	that will work - but it's bad practise IMO
2012-08-07T02:34:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	ok. what is the complete bin path?
2012-08-07T02:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	you might consider ~/bin - much cleaner then /bin
2012-08-07T02:36:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	ActionParsnip Dr_Willis thanks!
2012-08-07T02:36:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	what is ~/bin
2012-08-07T02:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	~ = your home directory.  so /home/foo/bin
2012-08-07T02:38:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	every app usually looks other apps in /usr/bin
2012-08-07T02:38:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	every app usually looks other apps in /usr/bin . not in /home
2012-08-07T02:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	actually if ~/bin exists, then it will look there by default as well (must exist at login, so after created logout/backin)
2012-08-07T02:39:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	Dr_Willis oh
2012-08-07T02:39:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	Dr_Willis so /usr/bin and /home/username/bin is the same. functionally?
2012-08-07T02:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	maplesoft	"functionally" yes - but one is a system directory you shouldn't use (/usr/bin) and one you can do whatever to (~/bin)
2012-08-07T02:40:00.000Z	maplesoft	zykotick9	thanks
