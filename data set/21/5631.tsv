2007-09-30T14:03:00.000Z	un_dave		another question. i installed feisty fawn about a week ago, but as someone just mentioned, gutsy will be released soon. how hard is it to update to whole new versions of ubuntu? will it just come up in the updates manager... ??
2007-09-30T14:05:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	it should be offered automatically.
2007-09-30T14:05:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	wow cool, so i just agree, and then i have the latest version?
2007-09-30T14:06:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	that's the idea. :)
2007-09-30T14:10:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	dude, that'd go way fast. packets go faster downhill right?
2007-09-30T14:11:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	doh, didn't think of that. ;)
2007-09-30T14:31:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	thats a standard port. you should pick a random one
2007-09-30T14:32:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	that's the max port. 6881 is the min port. it will use all inbetween :)
2007-09-30T14:32:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	some isps will block standard bittorrent ports
2007-09-30T14:32:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	why would you need more than one port :S
2007-09-30T14:32:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	he said he had good connection/speed in windows so that is probably not the problem :)
2007-09-30T14:32:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	ya.
2007-09-30T14:35:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	no it wont ?
2007-09-30T14:36:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	I get crap speed until i set a port range
2007-09-30T14:36:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	i happily get better that 1mByte/s using just one port
2007-09-30T14:36:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	using Azureus on ubuntu
2007-09-30T14:37:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	that's lucky :)
2007-09-30T14:37:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	hey... i wonder what i'll get if i do a range?!?
2007-09-30T14:38:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	try and find out :)
2007-09-30T14:40:00.000Z	un_dave	Jowi	how do i set a port range in azureus?
2007-09-30T14:40:00.000Z	Jowi	un_dave	no idea.
