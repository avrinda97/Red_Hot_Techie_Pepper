2008-04-01T09:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale		what man pages should I read to learn how to connect to a wireless network from the command line?
2008-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	interfaces
2008-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	and iwconfig
2008-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	ok thanks! any more?
2008-04-01T09:49:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	make sure you have the right packages installed
2008-04-01T09:49:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	basically you get your wireless to show up under iwconfig and ifconfig then edit /etc/network/interfaces to get it to work
2008-04-01T09:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	then /etc/init.d/networking start ?
2008-04-01T09:50:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	I have done wireless for a while but if you look for slightly older debian how-tos they work for ubuntu
2008-04-01T09:50:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	haven't I mean
2008-04-01T09:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	how do I make ther changes to the /etc/networks/interfaces file take effect?
2008-04-01T09:52:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	ifdown [networkinterface like eth0 or wlan0], then ifup [thesame]
2008-04-01T09:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	oh ok. Thanks!
2008-04-01T09:52:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	you can man those to I think to learn them,  in your interfaces file if you set the network interface as auto it will connect when you reboot
2008-04-01T09:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	ok thanks!
2008-04-01T09:55:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	so currently becuase my wireless device is managed by networkmanager, my interfaces file only contains lo. Correct?
2008-04-01T09:56:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	I have no idea
2008-04-01T09:56:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	I don't use the gui stuff for network as I like the conf files better
2008-04-01T10:11:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	I was reading through man interfaces. But how do I select a network essid and where do I put the wpa password?
2008-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	was that meant for me or Steven1?
2008-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	travisat	Odd-rationale	lol you
2008-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	travisat	lol ok
