2008-05-19T07:43:00.000Z	sportman1280		can anyone tell me why my transfer speeds are only 4 MB/sec on a gigabit router with a wired connection?
2008-05-19T07:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sportman1280	I can only assume it is an unsupported network card using ndiswrapper or a low quality driver
2008-05-19T07:45:00.000Z	sportman1280	Jack_Sparrow	it is a restricted driver.  i did not have to use ndiswrapper
2008-05-19T07:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sportman1280	which gigabit card
2008-05-19T07:47:00.000Z	sportman1280	Jack_Sparrow	well the card itself isnt gigabit.  so i dont expect those speeds. however 4MB is very slow.  it seems.  Its a built in one to my laptop, how can i look up the info that you want?
2008-05-19T07:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sportman1280	all you can do is search for your laptop specs
2008-05-20T18:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sportman1280	there may be a way in gconf-editor
2008-05-20T18:50:00.000Z	sportman1280	Jack_Sparrow	 good point didnt think about that.  Any idea where i should start looking in there?
