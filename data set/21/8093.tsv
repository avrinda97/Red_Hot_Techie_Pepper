2008-02-16T06:17:00.000Z	elm1		help, hey peeps i need to kno how to view all mount points that have ever been created
2008-02-16T06:17:00.000Z	elm1		hm, no go wat happened was i had changed the mount point for one of my externals but there was an error in the mount point so now ubuntu is saying it can mount because of that error
2008-02-16T06:19:00.000Z	elm1		that gives me all the mount points for drives currently mounted
2008-02-16T06:19:00.000Z	elm1		but not the ones i cant mount
2008-02-16T06:20:00.000Z	elm1		guys any word, i need to FIX a MOUNT POINT for an external
2008-02-16T06:21:00.000Z	elm1		its not recognizing so i dont kno the path for it
2008-02-16T06:22:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	try lsusb and blkid in the terminal
2008-02-16T06:23:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	make sure the external is powered on
2008-02-16T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	check in gconf-editor , under system > storage,  if you whave someting that looks like your usb device listed there,  delete it and restart the comp
2008-02-16T06:41:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	start gconf-editor from the command line,  look under system > storage > defaults
2008-02-16T06:43:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	 aer we talking about a usb external hdd ?
2008-02-16T06:43:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	standard english please
2008-02-16T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	and when you plug it in (currently) , do you see any icon poping up on your desktop ?
2008-02-16T06:45:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	 so the device is not getting mounted,  so you don't need to delete any mount point, we just need to figure out why it is not mounting
2008-02-16T06:45:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	what filesystem
2008-02-16T06:45:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	got ntfs-3g setup on this comp ?
2008-02-16T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	open up fstab and find the line for your usb device , and comment it out,  then , reboot the comp and try plugging the usb exernal hdd again
2008-02-16T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	it probably doesn't say usb in it ,  it should have your previous mount point listed in it however
2008-02-16T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	elm1	browse the /etc folder have a look at previous versions of your fstab files,  there are usualy a few backups in there
