2006-09-22T07:15:00.000Z	rredd4	synjet	 after the x update, i guess i am a bit gun shy
2006-09-22T07:15:00.000Z	synjet	rredd4	some glitches do slip in, but see the response time.. that was lightning :)
2006-09-22T07:16:00.000Z	rredd4	synjet	 i did not notice the x update until it was already fixed.  I feel lucky!
