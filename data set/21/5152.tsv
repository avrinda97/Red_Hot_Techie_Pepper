2008-11-23T11:45:00.000Z	jtaby		hey, is there a way to remap caps lock to control? it's soooo easy to do on a mac, and i can't even find a CLI command to do it
2008-11-23T11:45:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	checked keyboard settings ??
2008-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	yup
2008-11-23T11:46:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	maybe google   xmodmap
2008-11-23T11:48:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	no way! thanks man
2008-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	me too.  try using emerald instead of metacity
2008-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	any info on where i could change it?
2008-11-23T11:50:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	ya.    install   compizconfig-settings-manager first
2008-11-23T11:50:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	then you're going to install "emerald" package, and then run ccsm and go into the "Window Decoration" settings and set the Command to "/usr/bin/emerald --replace"
2008-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	then enable desktop effects? (after changing the window decorations command)
2008-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	yea or logout or something
2008-11-23T11:56:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	unfortunately, that didn't fix it
2008-11-23T11:56:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	sorry maybe your ati card doesnt support compiz
2008-11-23T11:56:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	or you may have to go thru some other pains and shoddy workaroudns to get it to work
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	online, it says that it should be supported just fine
2008-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	bugs can get in the way of theory<---> practice :(
2008-11-23T12:01:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	what was the compiz channel again?
2008-11-23T12:27:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	for compiz ya u have to
2008-11-23T12:41:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	odd.  maybe some key is stuck.  try typing "setxkbmap" and try again
2008-11-23T12:41:00.000Z	xtknight	jtaby	 prolly ctrl,alt,shift is stuck and it doesnt affect vim or something
2008-11-23T12:42:00.000Z	jtaby	xtknight	but it works everywhere else
