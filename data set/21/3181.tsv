2010-05-01T01:05:00.000Z	skiwithpete		anyone know how to change the resolution of the Ubuntu loading screen?
2010-05-01T01:05:00.000Z	skiwithpete		since installing ATI drivers its really low res
2010-05-01T01:05:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	xrander can change the res of x
2010-05-01T01:06:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	do I just run that in terminal?
2010-05-01T01:06:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	yes
2010-05-01T01:06:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	sudo?
2010-05-01T01:08:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	I typed it, and I think you meant xrandr - and I know I want to set it to 1600x900 - but how do I set the splash screen to that?
2010-05-01T01:09:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	the rez your running should be the same as the login
2010-05-01T01:10:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	sorry, I don't know what the screen is called... not the login screen, the first one with the five dots
2010-05-01T01:10:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	I think its purple, but I'm colourblind
2010-05-01T01:10:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	oh to change that you need to pass a option in grub to change the rez of the framebuffer
2010-05-01T01:11:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	how do I do that?
2010-05-01T01:11:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	it used to be vga= but it got changed i dont knoe the new command
2010-05-01T01:11:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	is there a room here I should ask in?
2010-05-01T01:11:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	someone hear should know
2010-05-01T01:12:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	is there a better way to ask?
2010-05-01T01:13:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	its still vga= according to the ubuntu docs but i do not knoe the number you need for your rez
2010-05-01T01:16:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	its vga=788 or 791 for the rez you whant
2010-05-01T01:17:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	how do I change it?
2010-05-01T01:19:00.000Z	gogeta	skiwithpete	editing grub in newer ubuntu is kinda tricky
2010-05-01T01:25:00.000Z	skiwithpete	gogeta	why is it more tricky with the new version?
