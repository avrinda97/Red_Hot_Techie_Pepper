2005-11-04T07:38:00.000Z	WebLOCH		I have come to admit what a complete noob i am and ask for help setting up java so that I can actually compile using the Blackdown j2sdk package that I installed, the problem i have is that the compiler complains that it "cannot resolve symbol" on "java.io" which implies it does not know where the classes are.  Please provide help in some detail if you wish to help me at all :(
