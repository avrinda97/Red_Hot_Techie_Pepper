2006-06-21T14:14:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	What's the problem?
2006-06-21T14:16:00.000Z	b166er	pteppic	just finished installing dapper...tried to install my nvidia (gf2) , changed the driver name to nvidia (but it wasnt nv to start..) then, all is black when i log in X
2006-06-21T14:16:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	you need to install the kernel module to go with it.  Google for nvidia kernel module and go from there.
2006-06-21T14:17:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	You need to install the restricted modules and then enable it.
2006-06-21T14:17:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	Apologies.
2006-06-21T14:17:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	Do you have lynx or links availible?
2006-06-21T14:18:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	Right ones for the right kernel?  There's borked dependancies for 23 up to 25.
2006-06-21T14:19:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	cat /etc/modules, see if nvidia is in there.
2006-06-21T14:19:00.000Z	b166er	pteppic	well, i followed a online guide
2006-06-21T14:20:00.000Z	b166er	pteppic	nop, there's just 'lp' and 'psmouse'
2006-06-21T14:20:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	nano /etc/modules
2006-06-21T14:21:00.000Z	b166er	pteppic	, same thing
2006-06-21T14:21:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	In your case, you need to add nvidia to your modules file.
2006-06-21T14:22:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	Nope, the kernel module allows direct access to the card.  Add the line nvidia, reboot and try again.
2006-06-21T14:23:00.000Z	pteppic	b166er	This is presuming that the restricted modules are installed (we'll assume for the min)
