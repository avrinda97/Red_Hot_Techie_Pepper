2007-08-23T11:51:00.000Z	jbird		Hello
2007-08-23T11:52:00.000Z	jbird		I am new to Linux any help
2007-08-23T11:52:00.000Z	jbird		how do you install games?
2007-08-23T11:52:00.000Z	jbird		like quake 3
2007-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	jbird		what is wine
2007-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	jbird		what medal of honor?
2007-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	jbird		so I need wine to install games
2007-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	only if you the game isn't ported for linux...
2007-08-23T11:55:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	maybe that's because it wasn't made for linux. and that's where wine comes in.
2007-08-23T11:56:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	sometimes yes, sometimes no. i don't think it works well for everything. i only tried it on keepass and... i forgot the other.
2007-08-23T11:57:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	it will appear as a menu entry where everything should be intuitive.... i think.. :)
2007-08-23T11:58:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	not sure if it's there, but i know i installed it from synaptics
2007-08-23T12:06:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	???
2007-08-23T12:07:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	then you have to mount it first.
2007-08-23T12:09:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	that's the game you were referring to a while ago?
2007-08-23T12:09:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	that's where you use wine... don't know if it works with cd's
2007-08-23T12:10:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	you have to use wine to install it.. it's not automatic or something
2007-08-23T12:13:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	open wine and use it to install the game
2007-08-23T12:24:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	like what was said, not everything works well with wine
2007-08-23T12:30:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	maybe because you are trying to bring into linux what is supposed to stay in windows? :)
2007-08-23T12:33:00.000Z	gvsa123	jbird	lol
