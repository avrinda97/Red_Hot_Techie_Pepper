2007-06-25T07:55:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	you have the wrong version. 2.x is NOT 1.2.x
2007-06-25T07:56:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	thing is, it's telling me pidgin is not installed at all, not that it's the wrong version
2007-06-25T07:56:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	no -dev package for pidgin? it most probably needs some pidgin headers
2007-06-25T07:57:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	there's actually no feisty packages at all for pidgin.  I installed from source
2007-06-25T07:57:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	and no you can't deal with that by forcing them. it's onething if the ubuntu packager wants that version but another one if the program to compiled needs it.
2007-06-25T07:57:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	if it did work with >1.3.0 it would say so
2007-06-25T07:58:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	but as I said: it mos probably misses a header file
2007-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	probably.  Anything I can do about it, since I installed from source?
2007-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	there is a pidgin-dev at least in debian sid. check ubuntu repos for such a thing
2007-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	why did you install from source?
2007-06-25T07:59:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	there is a reason this is discouraged
2007-06-25T08:00:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	because there are no feisty packages for pidgin.  Gutsy packages require libnss3 (when pidgin actually only needs libnss)
2007-06-25T08:00:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	you already are bedning gutsy package
2007-06-25T08:01:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	say again?
2007-06-25T08:02:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	you already are bedning gutsy packages. so what'S another package. and what you need is pidgin-dev, for your used version
2007-06-25T08:07:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	 also there is no dev package in the gutsy repos for pidgin :(
2007-06-25T08:07:00.000Z	wols	iTG`Neatchee	backport from debian sid then?
2007-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	there's no pidgin package in ubuntu repos prior to gutsy
2007-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	it's a rename of Gaim, but the rename breaks a bunch of plugins.
2007-06-25T08:09:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	and the newest version of the software (with a ton more features, and security fixes) has no gaim named version.
2007-06-25T08:10:00.000Z	iTG`Neatchee	wols	there is a fixed version of pidgin-otr plugin for the rename, but they, for some reason that i can't fathom, didn't release it for feisty, only gutsy
