2010-07-06T18:18:00.000Z	tomatto_	leven	how did you install ubuntu to usb?
2010-07-06T18:18:00.000Z	tomatto_		why ubuntu runs with failsafe X server?

2010-07-06T18:18:00.000Z	leven	tomatto_	with the system/administration/startaupdiskcreator option from a already installed computer
2010-07-06T18:19:00.000Z	tomatto_	leven	that should work
2010-07-06T18:20:00.000Z	leven	tomatto_	i know.. thats why i'm wondering if the removed it fr√•n the new release, in order to make it more simple and "maccy"
2010-07-06T18:22:00.000Z	tomatto_	leven	better is install grub on flash. to run memtest
2010-07-06T18:23:00.000Z	leven	tomatto_	would be good to have both, as it was before..
2010-07-06T18:24:00.000Z	tomatto_	leven	i have no experiences, how it was before.
2010-07-06T18:24:00.000Z	leven	tomatto_	but you have tried a 10.04 stick, and run memtest from it?
2010-07-06T18:24:00.000Z	leven		oh thats nice
2010-07-06T18:25:00.000Z	leven		in this channel it is a must to ignore everything but pure text..
2010-07-06T18:25:00.000Z	tomatto_	leven	when install cd to usb via usbstickcreator, it is same as on cd
