2006-12-24T06:17:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	cool use of povray btw :)
2006-12-24T06:17:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	thanks!
2006-12-24T06:33:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	absolutely random chipsets and motherboard configurations
2006-12-24T06:34:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	the problem is that changing chipsets all the time is a tendency at almost all hardware manufacturers
2006-12-24T06:34:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	i know, i no longer purchase brand name desktops
2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	like, buy a d-link wifi cardbus card today which works perfectly thanks to a atheros chipset, buying the "same" card (same product name) six months later, it won't work because now they have a marvell chipset in there
2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	absolutely i know!
2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	i blame that on windows actually
2006-12-24T06:39:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	the real problem are those chipset manufacturers completely ignoring free operating systems, like broadcom and marvell. intel, ralink and atheros support free os's to some extent.
2006-12-24T06:39:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	yep i know bro.  disgusting
2006-12-27T06:22:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	muhahaha
2006-12-27T06:25:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	thats pretty good advice
2007-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	everyone can have back luck with hardware, even when trying to buy a piece of hardware which is supported according to some info on the net. see the different h/w revisions of some wlan cards as an example.
2007-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	true enough
2007-04-17T12:07:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	the fact that one specific hardware rev. is only avaible for 3-6 months makes it ever harder
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	POVaddct	holycow	s/ever/even
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	sure i've run into that
2007-04-17T13:31:00.000Z	holycow	POVaddct	are you having cpu spikes too?
