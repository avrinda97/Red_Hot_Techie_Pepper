2012-09-09T23:47:00.000Z	Noobuntu		and where would be my best bet of finding the stack trace? the end of the old log file or the begnning of the new log file?
2012-09-09T23:49:00.000Z	Noobuntu		Xorg crashes anyone?
2012-09-09T23:50:00.000Z	Noobuntu		I ve been trying to read the Xorg logs to find the stacktrace...
2012-09-09T23:50:00.000Z	Noobuntu		I ve got 2 - Xorg.log.old and Xorg.log
2012-09-09T23:51:00.000Z	Noobuntu		where would I find the crash logs? end of .log.old or beginning of .log?

2012-09-09T23:53:00.000Z	Noobuntu		subz3ro: hmm.....
2012-09-09T23:53:00.000Z	krababbel	Noobuntu	you could delete the log and restart syslogd I believe to have an empty log to start with
2012-09-09T23:53:00.000Z	Noobuntu		okay krababbel..
2012-09-09T23:53:00.000Z	Noobuntu		will do

2012-09-09T23:57:00.000Z	Noobuntu	krababbel	I was actually using Wubi before - till I tried to update to Precise back in May
2012-09-09T23:57:00.000Z	Noobuntu		upgrade broke my system :(
2012-09-09T23:58:00.000Z	Noobuntu		tried to fix it for 3 months - just couldn't get my Wlan working :(
2012-09-09T23:58:00.000Z	krababbel	Noobuntu	well good luck, I got weird behaviour too once, reinstalled a package I never touched, and now it works again :)
2012-09-09T23:59:00.000Z	krababbel	Noobuntu	but wlan I never had to use (luckily)
2012-09-10T00:00:00.000Z	Noobuntu	krababbel	I couldn't even install anything - it broke all my networking entirely tools
