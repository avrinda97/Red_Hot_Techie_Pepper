2009-07-23T15:26:00.000Z	or4n9e		I found out that changing the root passwd, i.e. setting it in persistent liveusb mode isn't possible
2009-07-23T15:27:00.000Z	or4n9e		wtf? this is a serious bug, isn't it?
2009-07-23T15:27:00.000Z	or4n9e		anyidea how to fix that? is it locked or something
2009-07-23T15:27:00.000Z	or4n9e		/etc/shadow gets updated but the system ignores it
2009-07-23T15:28:00.000Z	or4n9e		ups sorry
2009-07-23T15:30:00.000Z	or4n9e		no issues with a hdd install
2009-07-23T15:30:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	that's silly
2009-07-23T15:30:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	why do you need to log in as root, ever?
2009-07-23T15:30:00.000Z	or4n9e	richardcavell	what's silly?
2009-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	are you trolling?
2009-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	or4n9e	richardcavell	nope, I'm serious
2009-07-23T15:44:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	what do you mean it does not work?
2009-07-23T15:44:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	have you re logged in?
2009-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	or4n9e	richardcavell	the system ignores the change
2009-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	have you rebooted or not?
2009-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	or4n9e	richardcavell	as I said I also rebooted
2009-07-23T15:49:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	let Boobah try to reproduce your symptoms
2009-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	or4n9e	richardcavell	you need this to believe I'm not a troll?
2009-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	no
2009-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	richardcavell	or4n9e	I'm just saying we should reproduce what you're talking about to understand what's going on
2009-07-23T15:52:00.000Z	or4n9e	richardcavell	ok sorry
