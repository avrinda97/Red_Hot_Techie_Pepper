2007-09-25T05:55:00.000Z	odzk		but i dont know how to install it

2007-09-25T05:55:00.000Z	odzk		and there is a folder called "firefox"
2007-09-25T05:55:00.000Z	odzk		how can i run it
2007-09-25T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	in ubuntu you do should not install things like that.  Just let the update-manager and Package manager take care of downloading and installing things
2007-09-25T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	make sure you have updates and security updates enabled in system -> administration -> software sources and let update-manager do its thing
2007-09-25T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	update-manager lets you select what you want to update, but pike_'s command will work as well
2007-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	delete it, it's not needed.  If you use it, it will circumvent the package manager and thus you lose the benefits of the package manager
2007-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	what are you asking?
2007-09-25T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	do you understand what I and others just told you?
2007-09-25T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	yes, and after you said that, pike_ told you that 'sudo apt-get install firefox' will update ONLY firefox.  As will update-manager if you only mark the checkbox for firefox
2007-09-25T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	no one is saying synaptic
2007-09-25T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	I just told you how, do you understand what I said?
2007-09-25T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	yes, but in a terminal
2007-09-25T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	odzk	like I said, if you use it, you will circumbent the package manager and lose its benefits
