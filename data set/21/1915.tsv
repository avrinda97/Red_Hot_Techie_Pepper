2010-03-20T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 depeding on how you installed the 3.6  it may have a icon with a different name in th emenus.
2010-03-20T08:38:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	I found a page online that told me what to type into the terminal to add a repo and install it, let me find you the link.
2010-03-20T08:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 i tend to use the firefox-stable ppa i belive.

2010-03-20T08:40:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	?
2010-03-20T08:42:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	?
2010-03-20T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 follow the ubuntu wiki pages. is the best bet.
2010-03-20T08:45:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	I've already installed it. The only firefox that appears in my menu is the one that launches 3.5.8. Where would it have installed in the filesystem?
2010-04-18T12:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 i doubt if thats goign to be easially done.. if its doable at all. and i can imagine that would cause lots of problems.
2011-05-02T23:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	  thers alternative indicator-applets for a lot of the old applets.
2011-05-03T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 thats a compiz setting/plugin thats proberly disabled by default
2011-05-03T00:01:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	properly disabled?
2011-05-03T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 many compiz plugins dont play well with Unity.
2011-05-03T00:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 install ccsm and play with them  if you want.
2011-05-03T00:02:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	so the super + tab animation won't work with Unity?
2011-05-03T00:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	W43372	 no idea. its not enabled by default..  notice if you hit the windows/super  keys. the launcher gives #'s to the icons.. the  super key has a lot of other things it does under unity.
2011-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	Then I'll check out ccsm and use a different key combination. Thanks.
2011-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	W43372	Dr_Willis	I just tried an apt-get for ccsm and terminal told me it was unable to locate
