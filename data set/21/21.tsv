2004-10-26T13:56:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	He never intended on creating that expectation, I don't think.
2004-10-26T13:57:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	For sure. His first press releases were too unfocused.
2004-10-26T13:57:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	?
2004-10-26T13:58:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	The whole anti-RH anti-suse stuff?
2004-10-26T14:00:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Seriously?
2004-10-26T14:01:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	You're in Aus, right?
2004-10-26T14:02:00.000Z	jdub	stevedeo	yes
2004-10-26T14:03:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Mind if I ask your opinion of a recent CS Honours grad from middle-of-fucking-nowhere Canada getting sponsored for an Aus work visa? :)
2004-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	jdub	stevedeo	hrm, dunno
2004-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	jdub	stevedeo	the work is picking up a bit here, depending on what you want to do
2004-10-26T14:06:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	.NET/C# development, most likely. Java, if I had to.
2004-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Mono, if I manage to land some kind of dream job ;)
2004-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	jdub	stevedeo	haven't heard of too many mono gigs around here yet
2004-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Yeah, I imagine they are still pretty sparse.
2004-10-26T14:08:00.000Z	jdub	stevedeo	nice place to be, but we're going down some of the same stupid roads canada has
2004-10-26T14:08:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Oh? What roads might those be? (There are many)
2004-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Ah. Yeah, I can probably deal with that. :)
2004-11-04T16:46:00.000Z	jdub	stevedeo	yeah, we're going to have to work on that
2004-11-04T16:39:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	I'm not entirely familiar with the internals of the Canonical business plan. Do you guys have anything in mind for supporting Universities?
2004-11-04T16:46:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	If there were marketing/promotional materials of any kind, I think the community could do some pretty good marketing for ubuntu with it. I know I would.
2004-11-04T16:46:00.000Z	stevedeo	jdub	Can't wait to see what you come up with. :) My U is looking for a new Linux solution for our CS dept right now, and ubuntu would be perfect.
