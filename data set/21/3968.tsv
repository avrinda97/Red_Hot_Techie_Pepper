2008-08-10T05:10:00.000Z	goat_		its 2:10am and i am sitting twiddling my thumbs with a corrupt OS and no way to backup the data
2008-08-10T05:11:00.000Z	goat_		meh
2008-08-10T05:11:00.000Z	goat_		i thought ubuntu was a little more stable then this
2008-08-10T05:11:00.000Z	goat_		:/
2008-08-10T05:12:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	What happened?
2008-08-10T05:12:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	the huge thing decided to become corrupt and die after editing a config file...
2008-08-10T05:13:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	The whole FS?  As in it doesn't boot past a fsck?
2008-08-10T05:13:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	Or it won't boot at all?
2008-08-10T05:13:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	yes, i've had crazy stuff happen, like being at the login prompt screen and in console shell at the same time, with both replying to my entries
2008-08-10T05:14:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	What do you mean?
2008-08-10T05:14:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	Do you mean that two terminals were accepting the input from your keyboard?
2008-08-10T05:16:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	it replied to commands and login screen at once, said enter username, i entered, it said enter password - bad command, i entred password, it said invaid password and then it said invalid command or something
2008-08-10T05:16:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	So it loads the GUI login manager?
2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	no it dies after fsck on booting
2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	that was on console login
2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	Ah, okay, sorry.
2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	Out of my support range, then.  :(
2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	but it did different things the first 3 times i rebooted, now only its doing the same
2008-08-10T05:18:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	exactly my point
2008-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	goat_	You might just want to try scanning, repartitioning your disk and reinstalling.  It sounds like the FS has gotten corrupted?
2008-08-10T05:20:00.000Z	goat_	goodbyegravity_	it has... from a xorg setting :/
