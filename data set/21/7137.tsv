2009-10-03T06:00:00.000Z	shane2peru		anyone know how to shutoff system messages in IRC with pidgin?
2009-10-03T06:01:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	I don't think you mean system message, you mean ChanServ and Nickserv?
2009-10-03T06:01:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	ahh, that could be the proper words. is there a way to shut them off?
2009-10-03T06:02:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	I will google with those words too. :)
2009-10-03T06:02:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	don't really think so, I've tried setting "ignore" for those two, and they still show up.
2009-10-03T06:02:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	ok, thanks
2009-10-03T06:03:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	reason I say is Pidgin doesn't show true IRC system messages
2009-10-03T06:03:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	ohh, I just started using pidgin for IRC because I wanted the smiley faces, xchat didn't have them. :)
2009-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	you got openshot installed?
2009-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	yep, ppa
2009-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	ahh, ok, because I tried their installer, and it really left me a mess
2009-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	http://www.openshotvideo.com/2009/09/openshot-ppa-come-and-get-it.html
2009-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	thanks, you got it before I asked.
2009-10-11T07:55:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	when you installed openshot via the ppa you didn't have any problems?
2009-10-11T07:56:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	does it depend on mplayer or ffmpeg?  I have modified, newer versions installed
2009-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	on jaunty, not that I remember, haven't gotten around to trying on karmic yet
2009-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	I'm working on jaunty, so that is fine
2009-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	carpediem	shane2peru	let's check the dependencies.
2009-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	I will have to check it out, I'm glad to see they have a ppa
2009-10-11T07:57:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	thanks for the info on that too.
2009-10-11T08:06:00.000Z	shane2peru	carpediem	thanks for the link on openshot, got it installed and it opened up great, I will play with it later.
