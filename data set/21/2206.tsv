2009-12-14T21:39:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	eth0 is your LAN, right?
2009-12-14T21:41:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	I got a wireless connection normally.
2009-12-14T21:41:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	So, I think I'm somehow missing wlan0..
2009-12-14T21:42:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	yeah, ifconfig looks like that. since there is not wlan0 or eth1 (both possible for wlan), i'd say something is wrong with the driver. unfortunately i'm not familiar with ndiswrapper
2009-12-14T21:43:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	I downloaded it form their official site. I tried also this: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ndiswrapper/index.php?title=Siemens_Gigaset_USB_108 but it doesn't say 'Device installed' @ those ndiswrapper -l then.
2009-12-14T21:44:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	Though, before it said 'wlan0 cannot be found or something', and now it says 'wlan0 is not configured'
2009-12-14T21:44:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	did you check ifconfig with the other driver? when the device is listed there, it should work
2009-12-14T21:45:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	Ah, didn't try, but with those other drivers ndiswrapper -l didn't say anything related to 'hardware present' or 'device installed'.
2009-12-14T21:45:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	as i said, i'm not familiar with ndiswrapper, i've never used it
2009-12-14T21:46:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	it's worth a try, going to reboot and try it. thanks :-)
2009-12-14T22:01:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	after i read
2009-12-14T22:02:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	What?
2009-12-14T22:03:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	i cant paste the link, but ive read the sourceforge stuff and it sais you have to install athfmwdl too. the output of ndiswrapper -l only shows net5523. did you install hte other one?
2009-12-14T22:03:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	That are still old pastebins, I installed them both, and it gave me some errors @ dmesg and iwconfig still only showed eth/lo
2009-12-14T22:04:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	Those pastebins where with the working device
2009-12-14T22:04:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	i have no more ideas then
2009-12-14T22:05:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	Sadly you're not the only one :-(
2009-12-16T01:26:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	it wont ask, but you can run the installer again and tell it to use the whole hd to install (if nothing else is on it) ot you can delete the ubuntu partition with it
2009-12-16T01:26:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	*or
2009-12-16T01:27:00.000Z	wvd	Jamed	First time I let the installer make the partitions (highest option), if I also do this, will it overwrite the ubuntu partition? Or create a third (also got windows)
2009-12-16T01:28:00.000Z	Jamed	wvd	if you dont want windows to be deleted, then you have to remove the ubuntu partitions manually and tell the installer to install on "the largest free space"
