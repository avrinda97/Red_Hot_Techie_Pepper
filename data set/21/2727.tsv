2009-07-11T09:57:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	Did you have a question or problem concerning ubuntu?
2009-07-11T09:58:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	Sounds like you have permissions problem. Have you ever ran firefox as root or with sudo? You shouldn't, btw
2009-07-11T09:59:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	What does 'ls -l ~/.mozilla' show?
2009-07-11T10:00:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	Reinstalling wont help anything
2009-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	Yech, dist-upgrades
2009-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	What does 'ls -l ~/.mozilla' show?
2009-07-11T10:02:00.000Z	Roark	soreau	ed@oldtimer:~$ ls -l ~/.mozilla
2009-07-11T10:03:00.000Z	soreau	Roark	Well it's not a permissions problem it seems. Do have enough disk space available? (df -h)
