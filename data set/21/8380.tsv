2006-05-04T13:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight		hi, I have a gz archive on cd and i don't know how to extract or unzip it
2006-05-04T13:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight		it is in /media/cdrom1
2006-05-04T13:50:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	tar -xzvf /media/cdrom1/file
2006-05-04T13:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	i'll try that
2006-05-04T13:50:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	unless it's not a tarfile, in which case you can gunzip it
2006-05-04T13:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	MIME type: application/x-gzip
2006-05-04T13:52:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	type it says is gzip archive?
2006-05-04T13:52:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	did you use tar?
2006-05-04T13:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	yea, used tar but its not worked, command line is going crazy
2006-05-04T13:54:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	did it give an error?
2006-05-04T13:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	/bin/tar: /bin/tar: cannot execute binary file
2006-05-04T13:56:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	eh... sounds like something is wrong.. or you didn't type the command right
2006-05-04T13:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	i did sudo tar -xzvf /media/cdrom1/conradaa
2006-05-04T13:57:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	shouldn't it be tar -xzvf /media/cdrom1/conradaa.tar.gz ?
2006-05-04T13:57:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	and you don't need sudo to untar a file
2006-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	that aint worked either
2006-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	pastebin the output of ls -l /media/cdrom1/
2006-05-04T14:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	i tried to extract it from gui but it says that it is not supported
2006-06-28T06:10:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	no, mepis is dead because significantly fewer people use it, and it's a live cd
2006-06-28T06:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight	polpak	ubuntuis also live cd, Mepis live cd also installs as a full os
2006-06-28T06:12:00.000Z	polpak	livingdaylight	take it to ubuntu-offtopic, and also no one cares
