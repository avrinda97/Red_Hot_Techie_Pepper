2005-03-24T08:46:00.000Z	dash	andrewski	try "xset fp rehash" maybe?
2005-03-24T08:47:00.000Z	dash	andrewski	does fc-list show it?
2005-03-24T08:47:00.000Z	andrewski	dash	yes, but i checked after i did xset etc.  h/o
2005-03-24T08:47:00.000Z	andrewski	dash	yeah, still not there.
2005-03-24T08:49:00.000Z	andrewski	dash	so, should i restart?
2005-03-24T08:50:00.000Z	dash	andrewski	hmm, maybe. but if fc-list doesn't show it, i suspect that will not help
