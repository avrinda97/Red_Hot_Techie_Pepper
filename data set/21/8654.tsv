2007-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	curtis_	MrPrimate	 E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
2007-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	MrPrimate	curtis_	you have probably some bad sources in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	curtis_	MrPrimate	 and how can i fix tht! (sorry if am bothering)
2007-09-29T14:02:00.000Z	curtis_	MrPrimate	 so how could i fix my sources list..!
2007-09-29T14:03:00.000Z	MrPrimate	curtis_	you can edit it with a text editor, the file is at /etc/apt/sources.list,     remove lines that don't say ubuntu probably -- at the bottom usually
2007-09-29T14:04:00.000Z	curtis_	MrPrimate	 ok thanks
