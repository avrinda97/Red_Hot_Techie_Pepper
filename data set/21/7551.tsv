2007-10-03T06:08:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Why does my computer hang (ie. clock which display seconds stops moving, mouse stops moving, keyboard doesn't respond) so often?
2007-10-03T06:10:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Why does my computer hang (ie. clock which display seconds stops moving, mouse stops moving, keyboard doesn't respond) so often?
2007-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Especially noting I'm using "stable" 7.04
2007-10-03T06:12:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		It hangs at random times and I cannot use the computer anymore without restarting.
2007-10-03T06:12:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Is there a gnome-applet?
2007-10-03T06:14:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		nvidia.
2007-10-03T06:16:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		...nice magic trick, what was it supposed to do?
2007-10-03T06:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Why is there a Maxim?  Is this Linuxxx now?
2007-10-03T06:19:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Now what?
2007-10-03T06:19:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	what did you just run?
2007-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	sounds like a hardware problem or kernel panic
2007-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	bmk789	yes, during the GUI.
2007-10-03T06:11:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	could it be overheating?
2007-10-03T06:12:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	bmk789	installed two cheap fans, no help.
2007-10-03T06:12:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	have you monitored temps?
2007-10-03T06:12:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	bmk789	how do we do that?
2007-10-03T06:13:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	sudo apt-get install lm-sensors sensors-detect
2007-10-03T06:16:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	then its just lm-sensors, my mistake
2007-10-03T06:17:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	after thats installed, run "sudo sensors-detect" and basically answer yes to everything, when thats done just run "sensors" and it should give system temps
2007-10-03T06:20:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	then "sensors" should give you the temps
2007-10-03T06:22:00.000Z	bmk789	superkirbyartist	that should let you make sure your proc stay within its stable temps, what CPU?
