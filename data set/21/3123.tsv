2009-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	ok. sorry but I'm out of ideas
2009-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	squashfs is above me
2009-08-07T08:56:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	is it the bootup screen after it's installed or while getting ready to install?
2009-08-07T08:57:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	it's at the bootup screen booting into the live environment or straight to install, right after the menu. this is almost exactly where it hangs: http://aruljohn.com/info/images/psp/pspubuntu_loading.gif
2009-08-07T08:58:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	except with the bar filled to 20% (after bouncing back and forth) and stuck
2009-08-07T08:58:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	when that screen's coming up, did you check the other tty's for more info?
2009-08-07T08:58:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	also, have you tried the "alternate text based installer" ?
2009-08-07T08:59:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	have not tried the alternate text-based installer but will do so. thanks
2009-08-07T09:00:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	just after that bootscreen (called usplash) goes up, try CTRL+ALT+F1-8 and look for one that has text
2009-08-07T09:00:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	you may get a better error message that you can troubleshoot
2009-08-07T09:00:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	wont let me check a TTY there
2009-08-07T09:01:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	you may have to do it right when it first displays
2009-08-07T09:01:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	ok, ill try that. thanks
2009-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	i'm getting a "squashfs error"
2009-08-07T09:06:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	you said you did the "check disk" and it worked?
2009-08-07T09:07:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	yes, i checked the md5 sums and its all fine, its occurring to me on both my ubuntu/mythubuntu .isos. the squashfs error comes up on the tty prompt when booting
2009-08-07T09:08:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	when you start it up though, one of the options is to "check disk"
2009-08-07T09:08:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	something may have gone wrong durring the burn
2009-08-07T09:08:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	as in verify disc integrity?
2009-08-07T09:08:00.000Z	cprevoe	aaron_	yup
2009-08-07T09:08:00.000Z	aaron_	cprevoe	yep i checked it and i ran the memtest, all came out fine
