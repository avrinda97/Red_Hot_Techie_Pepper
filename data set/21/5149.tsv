2007-12-13T02:17:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	safe mode will work.
2007-12-13T02:19:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	just edit your grub config file so that the safe mode is the first option
2007-12-13T02:21:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	it's all there in the second url
2007-12-13T02:22:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	yw :)
2007-12-13T02:34:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	you're not supposed to find it - you're supposed to find the one that discusses where the config file is out and editting it.
2007-12-13T02:35:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	er, at, not out
2007-12-13T02:35:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	usually in /boot/grub/
2007-12-13T02:36:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	then don't ask. :)(
2007-12-13T02:37:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	yeah - the config file is always in /boot/grub/
2007-12-13T02:38:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	what system are you installing it on?
2007-12-13T02:40:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	something's probably not good with your bios setup for the video - does it do write-combining?
2007-12-13T02:41:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	well why don't you look at it and see? :)
2007-12-13T02:42:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	ok
2007-12-13T03:55:00.000Z	[Scooter]	Avt	i'm about to leave
