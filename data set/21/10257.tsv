2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	radikal1		does anyone have any ideas what to try after I've installed realplayer 10, and it doens't work?  It just sits there after I type realplay and does nothing
2005-04-16T15:17:00.000Z	radikal1		the whole point of using ubuntu on this PC is so it is more user-friendly, so realplayer needs to work :)
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	radikal1		does anyone have any ideas on what to try with realplayer?  I've installed it, when i try to run it, it does absolutely nothing
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	try mplayer instead
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	what if I need to play realvideo content?
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	then get realplayer libs?
2005-04-16T15:20:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	ok i will try that
2005-04-16T15:20:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	you should get all the libs you want though
2005-04-16T15:20:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	and recompile it yourself
2005-04-16T15:20:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	I want them all!
2005-04-16T15:20:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	you don't need them all ;-)
2005-04-16T15:21:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	well I want it to play all realaudio stuff
2005-04-16T15:29:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	ok, I have mplayer installed, but I can't find real codecs for it?  I do haev the multiverse thing turned on but I don't see them
2005-04-16T15:31:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	where should I be lookign for these codecs?
2005-04-16T15:31:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	./configure mplayer and see what codecs are listed as disabled
2005-04-16T15:31:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	then google and build one
2005-04-16T15:31:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	(or install from ubuntu archive)
2005-04-16T15:32:00.000Z	radikal1	zyga	I have searched the ubuntu archive, but i don't see them
2005-04-16T15:32:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	then search google
2005-04-16T15:32:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	I always build mplayer and libs myself - waay faster
2005-04-16T15:32:00.000Z	zyga	radikal1	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
