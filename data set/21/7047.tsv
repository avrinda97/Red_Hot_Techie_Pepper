2007-07-31T13:16:00.000Z	hendrixski		alrighty, this sed this is rediculous ... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32072/  please help!
2007-07-31T13:18:00.000Z	hendrixski		May somebody please take a look at my sed script and tell me why it's not working ... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32072/
2007-07-31T13:20:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	do you want to add it to end of what is already on the second to last line or just a new line there?
2007-07-31T13:22:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	I want to add a few lines of text just before the last line  ... not append :-)
2007-07-31T13:23:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	well you *could* do something like   $i'foobar'    for what you are asking but if you asked me the third to last line I wouldn't know :)
2007-07-31T13:24:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	insert instead of append
2007-07-31T13:26:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	hmmm
2007-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	there's probably more than one but maybe seahorse?
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	:-) not that one... seahorse is the frontend for gpg... there's one which just pops up a text box to enter a password.
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	when it pops up see if 'xprop' or 'xwininfo' can help
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	I'll try those  :-)
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	doesn't look like either of those are "it" .... I think the person who helped me last time was on Ubuntu-motu... maybe I'll check there :-)
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	you click on your program after running 'xprop' or 'xwininfo' to get info about your popup
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	oh... I don't have this on installed but I need it... :-( but I don't remember the name... there's the rub
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	seahorse caches and prompts for passwords.  Searching the repos, looks like gnupg-agent does too
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	I found it... I needed pinentry, that's what it was called.  Thanks though :-)
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	ah ok
2007-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	it's one of those things that they kind of forgot to put into a lot of documentation :-/  I keep meaning to send a few patches to the documentation teams but never have the time
2008-12-05T00:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	jrib	that channel is as dead as a doorknob
2008-12-05T00:42:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	wait, but a door knob isn't... oh.  Might want to try a mailing list or forums, you'll have better luck to be honest
2009-02-10T07:20:00.000Z	jrib	hendrixski	why would it?
