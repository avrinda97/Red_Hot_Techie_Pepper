2008-04-15T15:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	yep, all good :)
2008-04-15T15:17:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: I have only 3*256 ram, I am running virtual machine. Before I start it I have to shutdown firefox, gedit,etc,etc. If swap is not used it is very bad for me
2008-04-15T15:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	swap will get used when you run out of RAM
2008-04-15T15:18:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	as long as swap is enabled ofcourse
2008-04-15T15:18:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: I never run out of memory, instead my ubuntu hang up
2008-04-15T15:18:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: ... or virtual machine hang up
2008-04-15T15:19:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: swap is acceptable because at least I need firefox + virtualbox + pidgin at the same time
2008-04-15T15:20:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: 320 ram for virtual machine, so VirtualBox take 360 ram.
2008-04-15T15:21:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: right now it is 570 MB used (of 755 MB total). If I start, firefox it will takes 150 MB more.
2008-04-15T15:21:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: sure, I will reduce virtual machine memory... but do you think my settings are wrong? Can I force linux to use more swap (not for virtual machine but for everything else)
2008-04-15T15:22:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: or do you think it can't find swap partition (I do not know which log file to check)
2008-04-15T15:23:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	if you can pastebin the contents of   /etc/fstab   we can see if swap exists
2008-04-15T15:24:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: ok, so you think everything is normal. I did worry what if my swap partition is not visible/available for linux. Will paste fstab, as I see it is ok.
2008-04-15T15:26:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: please: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63265/
2008-04-15T15:27:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	anythings possible, but not always a good idea ;)
2008-04-15T15:27:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	that is why, if I did wrong installation (few months back) I want to fix it
2008-04-15T15:28:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	looks fine, I assume your swap partition is atleast as big as your amount of RAM, plus a little more? Not that that matters as you don't seem to be hitting the swap
2008-04-15T15:30:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	DistroJockey	mjbrooks: as I remember, swap must be 1GB. Please: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63268/
2008-04-15T15:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mmm4m5m	looks fine to me
