2010-02-17T08:01:00.000Z	socratesthekid		I'm having problems with my wireless. Running ubuntu 9.10 on a fujitsu lifebook p1510d and it isn't recognizing my wireless card at all; doesn't even think its there
2010-02-17T08:02:00.000Z	socratesthekid		tried madwifi, didnt fix it
2010-02-17T08:02:00.000Z	teage	socratesthekid	do you know what card you have?
2010-02-17T08:03:00.000Z	socratesthekid	teage	i've tried to find the exact thing, best i've been able to find is the atheros super ag
2010-02-17T08:03:00.000Z	socratesthekid		i want to say i heard 5006 somewhere, but that might be a lie
2010-02-17T08:05:00.000Z	teage	socratesthekid	try running " sudo lshw " and see if it sees yer wifi card

2010-02-17T08:10:00.000Z	socratesthekid		appreciate the help teage
2010-02-17T08:16:00.000Z	teage		socratesthekid>It is not there, You should have a section that list network* which you do, but you also should see another section that list network:1* which would be another interface such as your wifi.
2010-02-17T08:17:00.000Z	teage		socratesthekid>you may have a non compatible card.
2010-02-17T08:17:00.000Z	teage		socratesthekid>Im not certain though, I am presuming you have searched this.
2010-02-17T08:18:00.000Z	socratesthekid	teage	i haven't heard other people having this problem actually
2010-02-17T08:19:00.000Z	teage		socratesthekid>have you tried looking up the driver from say, your computers support site?
2010-02-17T08:19:00.000Z	teage		socratesthekid>fujitsu, right?
2010-02-17T08:20:00.000Z	socratesthekid	teage	fujitsu lifebook p1510d
2010-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	teage		socratesthekid>Is there a switch on right side of the notebook?
2010-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	socratesthekid		there is, it is set to "on"
2010-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	socratesthekid		first thing i checked
2010-02-17T08:32:00.000Z	socratesthekid	teage	from what i've seen, i'm thinking the wireless might actually be fried because i dont see any other really practical explaination for why it isnt working
