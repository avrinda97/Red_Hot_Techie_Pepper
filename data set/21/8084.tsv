2008-12-29T02:39:00.000Z	Hfuy		We can go the other way.
2008-12-29T02:39:00.000Z	Hfuy		Ah let's try
2008-12-29T02:40:00.000Z	Hfuy		the problem is that the share is called "Stuff (F)" so nautilus can't handle the space.
2008-12-29T02:42:00.000Z	Hfuy		Still no joy with named shares
2008-12-29T02:42:00.000Z	Hfuy		smb://indigobox/hobbit pops up "couldn't display..."
2008-12-29T02:43:00.000Z	Hfuy		OK so let's get this straight.
2008-12-29T02:43:00.000Z	Hfuy		I can't use windows printers from linux, and I can't send files from linux to windows?
2008-12-29T02:43:00.000Z	Hfuy		I can only send files from windows to linux?
2008-12-29T02:45:00.000Z	Hfuy		No, doesn't work by IP either.
2008-12-29T02:47:00.000Z	Hfuy		I can smb:\\xpbox\ from the ubuntu side, but I just get an empty window.
2008-12-29T02:47:00.000Z	stefg	Hfuy	lemme guess: that winxp box has no password, right?
2008-12-29T02:49:00.000Z	stefg	Hfuy	neither the admin nor any user on the xp box has a password, right?
2008-12-29T02:49:00.000Z	Hfuy	stefg	I believe it does, but it shouldn't need one in either case.
2008-12-29T02:50:00.000Z	stefg	Hfuy	you need to set up one usaer with a password on the xp box to make samba authentication work. use this user account and password to connect from teh ubuntu side
2008-12-29T02:51:00.000Z	Hfuy	stefg	The ubuntu side isn't even giving me the option to enter a username and password.
2008-12-29T02:51:00.000Z	stefg	Hfuy	Places menu, connect to server item
2008-12-29T02:52:00.000Z	Hfuy	stefg	It's asking for a domain, but we're not on one.
2008-12-29T02:52:00.000Z	stefg	Hfuy	just leave it blank
2008-12-29T02:53:00.000Z	Hfuy	stefg	We're back to "can't display location..."
2008-12-29T02:56:00.000Z	stefg	Hfuy	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/185756
2008-12-29T02:57:00.000Z	Hfuy	stefg	But I'm using smb: not network:
