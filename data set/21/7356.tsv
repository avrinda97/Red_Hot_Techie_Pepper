2006-12-25T11:33:00.000Z	needhelp		I have tried to install three different Windows PC-games on ubuntu. None of them will work. Here is the erros for one of them: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38780/
2006-12-25T11:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	most games doesnt work at all. check the list of compatible applications on winehq, and perhaps considder cedega
2006-12-25T11:35:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya_	all three games are listed on wine hqs homepage
2006-12-25T11:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	yes, but with what levelof functionality, and installed using what method?
2006-12-25T11:37:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya_	what do you mean? here is one of the games I try run with wine (installing worked fine): http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=3892
2006-12-25T11:38:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=5977
2006-12-25T11:38:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	see, that game isnt supported :)
2006-12-25T11:39:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	'installs'='yes', 'runs'='no', 'rating'='garbage' :)
2006-12-25T11:42:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	why dont you try .9.28?
2006-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya_	 'sudo apt-get install wine' for upgrading?
2006-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	add the winehq repo first
2006-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb
2006-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	when youve added the repo, do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine
2006-12-25T11:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	please pay attention
2006-12-25T11:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	thats because of copyprotection
2006-12-25T11:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	as i said, very few games actualy work. check out cedega, but your best bet is a dual boot
2006-12-25T11:54:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	my last awnser is still valid. stop trying :) you just get your head hurt from banging it to the wall
2006-12-25T11:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	but you are using an ages old version of wine. update!
2006-12-25T11:56:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya_	I just did, wine-0.9.28
2006-12-25T11:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	have you done the winecfg thing?
2006-12-25T11:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	needhelp	then a regerssion bug might be in order. as i said, gaming under wine isnt very functional, at all
