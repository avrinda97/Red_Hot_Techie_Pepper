2008-05-09T10:21:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	it was working some 15 mins back
2008-05-09T10:19:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 - be cool.. and it will work again, hang on
2008-05-09T10:20:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 -- with the restricted drivers .. was there ever the extended Custome desktop that compiz gives you?
2008-05-09T10:21:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	I did not get you
2008-05-09T10:21:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 did you ever notice if the compiz worked with the restricted drivers?
2008-05-09T10:22:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	on retricted driver
2008-05-09T10:22:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 have you restarted X?
2008-05-09T10:22:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	I tried restarting the system itself,
2008-05-09T10:24:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 okay... well, I do not know if you want to do this, ask around.. but.. to get the effects... they had to remove my restricted driver... and the one I got from ati-website, and remove all fglrx.. then rebooted to be sure my video monitor and drivers were listed correctly in xorg.conf.. then.. it all worked
2008-05-09T10:25:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	it was working fine with the restricted drivers that Hardy provided immediately after install
2008-05-09T10:25:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 what you may need to do is pastebin... your /etc/X11/Xorg.conf and let folks look over them
2008-05-09T10:27:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	this is my xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com/11062/
2008-05-09T10:29:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 -- this is my pastebin.. clean, after fix..
2008-05-09T10:29:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 http://pastebin.ca/1005812
2008-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	the whole problem here is we both use different cards, my card is always troublesome. So I never used to use Compiz on Gutsy, but it all worked well with Hardy
2008-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	drivetrax	madrazr	 -- I see some differences..
2008-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	I dont think these two drivers match
2008-05-09T10:32:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	how?
2008-05-09T10:32:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	exactly
2008-05-09T10:33:00.000Z	madrazr	drivetrax	thank you
