2010-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	ajsie		how do i install the latest ubuntu package with aptitude?
2010-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	ajsie		a version considered --prerelease
2010-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	ajsie		as in ruby 1.8 -> ruby 1.9.2
2010-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	arafatm_	ajsie	aptitude search ruby
2010-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	arafatm_		there should be a ruby 1.9 package
2010-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	arafatm_		sudo aptitude install <ruby 1.9 package>
2010-10-23T07:36:00.000Z	arafatm_		got a wierd issue. i'm trying to install ubuntu 10.10 off the cd. I can't get X to run. What's the command I can run from the prompt to start the install?
2010-10-23T07:41:00.000Z	ajsie	arafatm_	doesnt work .. i irun "aptitude nstall ruby1.9.1" but i still get version 1.8.7 in the IRB console
2010-10-23T07:43:00.000Z	arafatm_	ajsie	ok, couple of issues. 1) ruby is a link to ruby1.8 # ls -alh /usr/bin/ruby to verify
2010-10-23T07:43:00.000Z	arafatm_		2) if you really need both 1.8 and 1.9 then use rvm. not sure if there is a debian package for that
2010-10-23T07:43:00.000Z	arafatm_		rvm = ruby version manager
2010-10-23T07:44:00.000Z	arafatm_		allows you to run multiple versions of ruby/gems
2010-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	ajsie	arafatm_	yeah
2010-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	ajsie	arafatm_	i just hate to install things not using aptitude =)
2010-10-23T07:46:00.000Z	arafatm_	ajsie	i recommend you don't use aptitude if you need gems. the packages in apt are pretty old
2010-10-23T07:46:00.000Z	ajsie	arafatm_	okay
2010-10-23T07:46:00.000Z	ajsie	arafatm_	aptitude packages are only for native libraries right?
2010-10-23T07:46:00.000Z	ajsie		c++/c
2010-10-23T07:47:00.000Z	arafatm_	ajsie	install ruby, irb, rdoc. then get the gems installer from rubygems.org. install that, install rvm, and go from there as to which ruby/gems versions you need
2010-10-23T07:47:00.000Z	arafatm_	ajsie	no. aptitude is for any application that has been packaged for use in an ubuntu system
2010-10-23T07:49:00.000Z	ajsie	arafatm_	okay thanks
