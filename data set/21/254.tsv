2012-09-26T04:48:00.000Z	zack6849		Look usr
2012-09-26T04:48:00.000Z	zack6849		http://db.tt/hIJzv0ou
2012-09-26T04:48:00.000Z	zack6849		It doesn't label them.
2012-09-26T04:49:00.000Z	zack6849		Usr13, see what I mean?
2012-09-26T04:51:00.000Z	zack6849		Yep.
2012-09-26T04:52:00.000Z	zack6849		Now what
2012-09-26T04:52:00.000Z	zack6849		I see my main partition (800gb NTFS)
2012-09-26T04:52:00.000Z	zack6849		And the one I wanna install ubuntu on
2012-09-26T04:52:00.000Z	zack6849		The 200gb one
2012-09-26T04:53:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	and swap?
2012-09-26T04:53:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	swap partition (type 83)
2012-09-26T04:54:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	can use the end of it.. you should be fine with a gig swap
2012-09-26T05:01:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	you can use minimal , "/" and "swap".. it's optional to you if you want a separate partition for /home ..
2012-09-26T05:02:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	best to stcik with gpt if you're using it, otherwise try to stick to 4 primary partitions
2012-09-26T05:02:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	(imho <=4 prim)
2012-09-26T05:06:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	/dev/sda
2012-09-26T05:10:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	you can stick with 2 partitions (as i originally said--if you'd like), make it as big as you like and the other has to be at least 1 gig (i think 1 gig for swap is large enough)
2012-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	"/home" would exist on the "/" mount partition, if you decide to only use 2 partitions
2012-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	well they're now telling you to do 2..
2012-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	jagginess	zack6849	it's simply 2 partitions, one for ext4(which would host "/"), and the other is "swap"
