2006-07-06T15:40:00.000Z	Anony		Is there any sort of autoscrolling for command line?
2006-07-06T15:41:00.000Z	Anony		Like man, only you can set scroll speed?
2006-07-06T15:41:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	"autoscrolling"? what the heck is that?
2006-07-06T15:41:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	Where you set the speed, usually in line/time measure , and the text moves automatically
2006-07-06T15:42:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	what would you do with one?
2006-07-06T15:42:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	Read a book while in bed on my laptop.
2006-07-06T15:42:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	lazier and lazier.
2006-07-06T15:42:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	and 'less' would be to laborious?
2006-07-06T15:43:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	indeed.
2006-07-06T15:43:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	no, it does not
2006-07-06T15:44:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	why don't you just awk your own?
2006-07-06T15:44:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	I dont know how to use awk
2006-07-06T15:45:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	to be honest I have only heard the name.
2006-07-06T15:49:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	would this do the job for you?  $ cat yourbook.txt | awk '{ system("sleep 1s"); print }'
2006-07-06T15:50:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	cool thanks!
2006-07-06T15:50:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	you have to put it in background (ctrl-z) and kill if you want to stop
2006-07-06T15:51:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	adjust sleep time to meet your needs
2006-07-06T15:51:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	It seems to be working fine, how do I put it in the background?
2006-07-06T15:52:00.000Z	TTilus	Anony	press ctrl-z
2006-07-06T15:53:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	What is the advantage of that?
2006-07-06T15:54:00.000Z	Anony	TTilus	this is awesome, thanks
