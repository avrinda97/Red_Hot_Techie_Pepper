2007-06-07T14:33:00.000Z	misfit		yert, my drivers are working fine now ;) it was just something I always wondered how it worked.
2007-06-07T14:34:00.000Z	misfit		has anyone experienced problems with Wine @ installing programs that require a serial or registration number?
2007-06-07T14:36:00.000Z	misfit		If you see an nvidia splashcreen during boot-up, you're good!
2007-06-07T14:38:00.000Z	misfit		yert, I've tried installing photoshop and a screenwriting program, both require a key, but they spit it back saying it's incorrect.  Is it trying to do something with c++ in the background, maybe?
2007-06-07T14:40:00.000Z	misfit		after a while, the flash videos play real choppy and at times I have to close the browser.  any suggestions?
2007-06-07T14:40:00.000Z	misfit		yert, it's an older version, 7.0
2007-06-07T14:42:00.000Z	misfit		no problem yert, I appreciate the help.
2007-06-07T14:43:00.000Z	misfit		Hey, you guys are a great help!  Thanks, and take it easy!
2007-06-07T14:43:00.000Z	misfit		Bye
2007-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	misfit		I have XP and Ubuntu on my computer.  My burner works ok in XP but I can't burn anything in Ubuntu.  Any suggestions?
2007-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	what program are you usign to burn with?
2007-06-07T14:10:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	is ubuntu atleast recognizing the drive?
2007-06-07T14:12:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	right
2007-06-07T14:13:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	i personally dont burn many things onto discs
2007-06-07T14:13:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	but a friend of mine does, im trying to remember what program he uses
2007-06-07T14:14:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	it wasn't one of the ones you mentioned using
2007-06-07T14:15:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	what kind of files are you trying to burn?
2007-06-07T14:16:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	since some programs are better then others with specific file types
2007-06-07T14:17:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	i get the feeling its got something to do with the buffer, but im not entirely sure
2007-06-07T14:20:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	not that i know of, but the buffer is what usually freezes computers (atleast for me) when a burning process is being attempted
2007-06-07T14:21:00.000Z	fletch_	misfit	ok
