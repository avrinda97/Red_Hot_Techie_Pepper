2006-05-11T07:57:00.000Z	nix4me		anyone have a working printer hooked to ubuntu that windows machines can print to?  i really could use some help
2006-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	nix4me		usp
2006-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	nix4me		usb
2006-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	nix4me		printer works fine from local linux machine
2006-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	nix4me		just cant print to it from windows machines
2006-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	nix4me		across the network
2006-05-11T07:59:00.000Z	nix4me		<_nathan> i agree, but ive spent 16 hours so far
2006-05-11T08:00:00.000Z	nix4me		ive been using linux for 8 years, never had this much of a problem
2006-05-11T08:00:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	you are having a printing problem?
2006-05-11T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	what happens?
2006-05-11T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	no errors?   what does lpstat show?
2006-05-11T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	you are trying to print from windows?
2006-05-11T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	I would sniff the packets, see whether the print request gets to the linux box.  then you'll know which side to troubleshoot.
2006-05-11T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	sounds like a samba issue, off hand
2006-05-11T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	well, if you read for 1 hour, and you don't find it, the other 15 hours are wasted
2006-05-11T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	capture the packets when you try to print.  then you'll have some data to work with.  when you have a problem and you don't know what to do about it, collect more data.
2006-05-11T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	you have to be root, and you have to run the browser as root
2006-05-11T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	so do  sudo firefox, then do   http://127.0.0.1:631
2006-05-11T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	or localhost, same thing
2006-05-11T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	it should have built in classes
2006-05-11T08:16:00.000Z	sethk	nix4me	quite possible.  get hold of the intall one.
