2009-10-18T05:40:00.000Z	whocares		does anybody know if Windows 7 and GRUB conflict if Win 7 is installed before ?
2009-10-18T05:41:00.000Z	zaoul1	whocares	that is generally the way you want to, you should install windows first. If not then windows would blast away grub
2009-10-18T05:41:00.000Z	whocares	zaoul1	I know
2009-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	zaoul1	whocares	call microsoft ;-D
2009-10-18T05:59:00.000Z	zaoul1	whocares	speeds of installs generally are bottlenecked by the hard disk :-/
