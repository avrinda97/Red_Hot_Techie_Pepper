2006-01-21T16:14:00.000Z	peculiar		ok, just installed ubuntu...never used linux before. installation from the cd is done, booting from disk for the first time. I provide login and pword, and then have to write a command it seems...how do I get in to the "real thing" with a desktop and stuff?
2006-01-21T16:15:00.000Z	peculiar		its like dos
2006-01-21T16:15:00.000Z	peculiar		you have to type something
2006-01-21T16:15:00.000Z	peculiar		doesnt work
2006-01-21T16:16:00.000Z	peculiar		no, I dont have a graphical interface
2006-01-21T16:16:00.000Z	redguy	peculiar	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-01-21T16:16:00.000Z	redguy		!tell zytrax about root
2006-01-21T16:17:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	it says xserver-xorg is broken or not fully installed
2006-01-21T16:17:00.000Z	redguy	peculiar	hrm, no error messages during the install?
2006-01-21T16:18:00.000Z	peculiar		yes, thats true...after installing from cd....the rebooting started installing extra packages and that didnt work out for some reason....how do I retry that installation?
2006-01-21T16:19:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	yes a problem with installing extra packages stuff after the normal cd installation was finished
2006-01-21T16:19:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	so how do I retry the last part of the installation? the cd just starts from the beginning again
2006-01-21T16:20:00.000Z	redguy	peculiar	that's a valid question
2006-01-21T16:21:00.000Z	peculiar		hehe
2006-01-21T16:21:00.000Z	redguy	peculiar	do you have network connectivity? does ping google.com
2006-01-21T16:22:00.000Z	peculiar		only have one network plug, using it for this machine =)
2006-01-21T16:22:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	only have one network plug, using it for this machine =)
2006-01-21T16:23:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	ill try the cd again, but skipping the first steps this time
2006-01-21T16:23:00.000Z	redguy	peculiar	I'm not sure if the install process wouldn't start if you simply reboot the other box
2006-01-21T16:24:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	tried rebooting
2006-01-21T16:28:00.000Z	peculiar	redguy	thanks anyway....Ill try to install over again
