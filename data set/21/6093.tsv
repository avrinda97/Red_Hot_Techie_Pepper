2009-10-20T08:35:00.000Z	m0r0n		My cd isn't reading, anyone know any how to fix this?
2009-10-20T08:35:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	windex?
2009-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	The CD is clean.
2009-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	does the cd work in other machines?
2009-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	Yes sir.
2009-10-20T08:37:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	what happens when trying to read on non working machine?
2009-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	Non-working machine? the disk drive just blinks green and then stops, in Ubuntu but not windows, windows it appears to be fine
2009-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	do any discs work in your ubuntu?
2009-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	None
2009-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	However, it was working before, the lastest tweak I did was delete Eclipse and Netbeans
2009-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	Odd, or maybe not, after I closed GParted it started to work, thanks anyways
2009-10-20T08:41:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	ok
2009-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	m0r0n		Windows reads FAT32 right?
2009-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	yes
2009-10-20T08:45:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	most flash drives are formatted fat32
2009-10-20T08:45:00.000Z	m0r0n		I formatted my flash drive to FAT32, now with the USB creater thing, it's not letting me install on it
2009-10-20T08:45:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	install what?
2009-10-20T08:46:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	Ubuntu
2009-10-20T08:46:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	dont install ubuntu on fat32
2009-10-20T08:46:00.000Z	m0r0n	Billiard	I made a ext3 partition, but the installer saw only the fat32
2009-10-20T08:47:00.000Z	Billiard	m0r0n	fat32 has no permissions, im not sure if ubuntu will even let you install to it
