2008-05-24T22:37:00.000Z	DaVinci2008		the strangest thing happened to me... Package manager does not open, OpenOffice either, the only applications I can open is the games and Mozilla!
2008-05-24T22:37:00.000Z	DaVinci2008		not even the Languages selector
2008-05-24T22:37:00.000Z	DaVinci2008		nothing
2008-05-24T22:38:00.000Z	DaVinci2008		help!
2008-05-24T22:38:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	looks like some critical library got corrupted
2008-05-24T22:39:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	run oowriter from the terminal...it will tell you the problem
2008-05-24T22:40:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	no!
2008-05-24T22:40:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	care to share it?
2008-05-24T22:40:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	oh no
2008-05-24T22:41:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	what do you mean you removed it
2008-05-24T22:41:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	you removed all stdc++*?
2008-05-24T22:41:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	ok
2008-05-24T22:42:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	the fact that you are still online means everything is fine :)
2008-05-24T22:42:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	libstdc++ is so fundamental..you  cant work if it gets corrupted
2008-05-24T22:43:00.000Z	DaVinci2008	anirudh1	I need libstdc++.so.5 for a game I did. That is why I copied them. But my game does not found them in Ubuntu. So, where are they?
2008-05-24T22:43:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	sudo "find / -iname "*libstdc++*"
2008-05-24T22:43:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	put the special libs in a folder
2008-05-24T22:44:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	then do export LD_PRELOAD_PATH=<folder-name>:LD_PRELOAD_PATH
2008-05-24T22:44:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	put version 5 in a seperate folder...mixing libstdc++ versions is harakiri
2008-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	DaVinci2008	anirudh1	cool, I have both version 5 and 6 of libstdc++ running, thanks for all
2008-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	anirudh1	DaVinci2008	useful-yes...sane-no
