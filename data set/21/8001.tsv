2006-08-05T16:54:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	you can
2006-08-05T16:54:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	me been an idiot then :-) I not sure how to
2006-08-05T16:54:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	np.....
2006-08-05T16:55:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	what FuriousRage said.
2006-08-05T16:55:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	or you can use another method if it's easier for you to remember
2006-08-05T16:55:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	owner-group-world
2006-08-05T16:56:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	i confused. What is 'owner-group-world'? It says command not found?
2006-08-05T16:56:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	so if you chmod 755, then you're setting the owner to have read-write-execute (the 7), the group to read-execute (the 5) and the world to read-execute (the 5)
2006-08-05T16:57:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	I was using that as an example to explain it to you. sorry for the confusion.
2006-08-05T16:57:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	i gotchya
2006-08-05T16:57:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	so if you have a folder that you want to allow access to, just ask yourself who you want to have permissions and what level
2006-08-05T16:57:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	then assign it using the number.....
2006-08-05T16:58:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	so if I want to have full privs myself and full for my group, the I might do something like sudo chmod 775 /home/my_folder
2006-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	and if you want that permission set to apply to all subdirs, just add a -R flag for recursion
2006-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	easier still, i think, is I've changed permissions to read\write for the owner and group of my home folder (my username is in the group) and deselcted read and write for 'others' using nautilus
2006-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	hey, whatever works for you. :)
2006-08-05T05:00:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	i will su and see if it has worked - back in a bit
2006-08-05T05:03:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	yep - that has worked :-). I liked your way because it looks fancy. But my way was easier, lol
2006-08-05T05:03:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	she now gets permission denied
2006-08-05T05:05:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	cdubya	what's better still is that all my mount mounts to my other drives were set in a folder in my home directory. And so denying other users access to it they can't access any of my drives either! Rock on!
2006-08-05T05:05:00.000Z	cdubya	gizmo_the_great1	kewl. :)
