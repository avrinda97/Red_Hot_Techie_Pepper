2005-10-28T16:14:00.000Z	agt		Is there a way to add hard drives in Linux so they just add to the existing filesystem, i.e. 2 x 120GB drives making a 240GB big drive?
2005-10-28T16:15:00.000Z	njan	agt	software raid

2005-10-28T16:16:00.000Z	njan	agt	the easiest thing, I suppose, would be to setup a raid 0 array, but the downside of that would be that if you lost one drive, you'd lose all your data.
2005-10-28T16:17:00.000Z	agt	njan	thx for the link.
2005-10-28T16:17:00.000Z	njan	agt	welcome
2005-10-28T16:20:00.000Z	njan	agt	/mnt
2005-10-28T16:21:00.000Z	njan	agt	but it doesn't really matter - you can mount it wherever you want.
2005-10-28T16:21:00.000Z	njan	agt	I frequently create a /store and mount a sceond drive to there rather than to /mnt/something
2005-10-28T16:21:00.000Z	njan	agt	I'm surprised you've filled 120gb, though - what've you filled it with?
2005-10-28T16:22:00.000Z	agt	njan	Thats what I'm wondering too... I have a few movies. Is there a program that can tell me this easily ?
2005-10-28T16:22:00.000Z	njan	agt	"cd / && du -h --max-depth=1"
2005-10-28T16:23:00.000Z	njan	agt	run that in a terminal without the quotes
2005-10-28T16:23:00.000Z	njan	agt	alternatively, there are a couple of tree-based filesystem visualisers which would show you where your space is gone
2005-10-28T16:24:00.000Z	njan	agt	df -h will tell you what partitions are mounted and what the space usage is like
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	agt	njan	Thanks, having a look
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	njan	agt	welcome.
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	njan	agt	if you want to drill down you can cd into whatever's taking up the space and run 'du -h --max-depth=1' again.
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	njan	agt	chances are most of the files are in /home or someplace like that.
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	njan	agt	or you could alter the -max-depth bit and increase the number of levels that du drills down to, but you'll probably have lots of output :)
2005-10-28T16:27:00.000Z	agt	njan	LasseL thanks, that sorted it.
