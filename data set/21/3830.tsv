2008-10-27T02:07:00.000Z	Flukey	Flannel	 yups :)
2008-10-27T02:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	Since, those dependency errors don't agree with you, nor does this sources.list, do you have any files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/?

2008-10-27T02:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	thats extremely interesting.  Sorry for being a nag, but I want to be sure, can you pastebin the output of this: ls -l /etc/apt/suources.list.d/ ?
2008-10-27T02:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	er, lets spell that correctly.  ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2008-10-27T02:12:00.000Z	Flukey	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu.com/63013/ :S
2008-10-27T02:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	Alright then.  This is extremely odd, and I have no idea how you're on hardy with this sources.list, but that's fine, we can fix it.  go ahead and open your sources.list with sudo (alt-f2, then gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list) and I'll get you a new sources.list to put in there.
2008-10-27T02:14:00.000Z	Flukey	Flannel	 okies. thank you sir :)
2008-10-27T02:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	http://paste.ubuntu.com/63014/
2008-10-27T02:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	go ahead and paste that overtop of the stuff you currently have (so the file will be those three lines only)
2008-10-27T02:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	save it, then we'll take a moment before installing apache to get you up to date on your updates: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-10-27T02:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Flukey	then once that's done, sudo apt-get install apache2 will work just fine for you.
2008-10-27T02:16:00.000Z	Flukey	Flannel	thank you, i'll do that now
2008-10-27T02:18:00.000Z	Flukey	Flannel	:D you wonderful man! :D
