2006-11-03T11:28:00.000Z	Legendre		other printing works fine
2006-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	zyclop	Legendre	are the alternative drivers for your printer?
2006-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	Legendre	zyclop	- well, there were a lot of choices.. I just picked lj4
2006-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	Legendre		as it's an lj4
2006-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	Legendre		but the old setup had cups+foomatic
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	Legendre	zyclop	- should I try deleting the printer and using a diff driver?
2006-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	zyclop	Legendre	well, it's worth a try
2006-11-03T11:32:00.000Z	Legendre	zyclop	- I am trying the gutenprint driver..
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	zyclop	Legendre	what were the other choices?
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	Legendre	zyclop	- too many to list, all about the same, no info as to the diffs.
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	Legendre	zyclop	- about 8 options or so.
2006-11-03T11:34:00.000Z	zyclop	Legendre	well, pick one. you have free choice
