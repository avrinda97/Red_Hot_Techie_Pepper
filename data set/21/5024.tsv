2008-01-28T02:25:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	is it worth if for a core2duo?
2008-01-28T02:26:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	 I have no idea.  I'm quite new to Ubuntu and I have a dual-core AMD.  I know that I have managed in only about a week to get it running pretty much perfectly.
2008-01-28T04:06:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	killall `pidof <appname>`
2008-01-28T04:07:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	 Thanks.  :-)
2008-01-28T04:09:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	 OK, see, what i want to do is close a particular nautilus window based on its title.  From what I can tell, killall can only kill all nautilus windows, no?
2008-01-28T04:09:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	that is true
2008-01-28T04:10:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	I use kubuntu here so no nautilus for me, but does psaux | grep <title> return a line, other than the grep?
2008-01-28T04:11:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	ps aux rather sorry
2008-01-28T04:12:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	 sure does
2008-01-28T04:12:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	well 'cut' it and pass that as the argument: kill `ps aux | grep <title> | cut -d -f 1` or such
2008-01-28T04:13:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	kill `ps aux | grep <title> | cut -d -f 5` i reckon
2008-01-28T04:14:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	cut -d ' ' -f 5
2008-01-28T04:15:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	 you know, I don't think this will work anyway, because the PID of the program as returned by ps aux is 1007, and killing that doesn't work.
2008-01-28T04:15:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	i wonder why
2008-01-28T04:24:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	is there no command in linux to just close, not kill?
2008-01-28T04:24:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	not that I know of
2008-01-28T04:25:00.000Z	ThipThip	bascule	 but there must be, somewhere behind the scenes, no?  Like what happens in nautilus when I click the "x"?
2008-01-28T04:26:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	well pressing x does stuff via widgets, not accessible from bash
2008-01-28T04:31:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	well maybe,ask #gnome people
2008-01-28T05:53:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	use py-orbit
2008-01-28T06:05:00.000Z	bascule	ThipThip	yeee-haa! :D
