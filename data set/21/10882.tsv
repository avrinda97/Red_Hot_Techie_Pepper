2004-10-16T06:50:00.000Z	WW_		Could someone help me getting Evolution Mail set up to send mail?
2004-10-16T06:50:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	sure 
2004-10-16T06:52:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	what error are you getting?
2004-10-16T06:53:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	can you send or recieve right now , or neither?
2004-10-16T06:55:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	your mail address is someone@somewhere.com , whats the somewhere.com bit?
2004-10-16T06:55:00.000Z	WW_	sean_	That would be colgate.edu
2004-10-16T06:57:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	i just lookup up the domain and it returned mailmx.colgate.edu, smtp is probably the same machine, try smtp first though
2004-10-16T06:58:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	try sending a mail now , you can send to me if you want , sean@odonnell.nu
2004-10-16T06:59:00.000Z	WW_	sean_	I've tried that before, but I'm trying it again now...
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	if that does not work , try checking the 'Server requires authentication' box and filling in your username at the bottom
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	you can also try the username with and without the domain , and try the various different types of authentication
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	also if it gives an error message let me know what it is
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	I've run a few mail severs so we should be able to figure it out
2004-10-16T07:18:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	just telneted to mail.colgate.edu on port 25, its definately a working smtp server
2004-10-16T07:20:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	if you go into tools accounts on that machine , you can check the send mail settings there
2004-10-16T07:21:00.000Z	WW_	sean_	Right, that computer uses sendmail.
2004-10-16T07:21:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	dont know enough about sendmail to know how to extract the servername
2004-10-16T07:22:00.000Z	WW_	sean_	Would there be a configuration file somewhere?
2004-10-16T07:22:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	this is probably going to be one for the colgate admins unfortunately
2004-10-16T07:26:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	the sendmail config file is going to be called something.mc
2004-10-16T07:28:00.000Z	sean_	WW_	at the end of the file there will be a MAILER entry, that should contain the smtp server details and settings
