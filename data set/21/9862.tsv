2006-08-14T12:51:00.000Z	chalcedony		does anyone know how to pick up a window from any point on the window? I've got Xchat stuck up at the top of the screen.. and the bar to pick it up is behind the task bar or somewhere? (using gnome on dapper)
2006-08-14T12:52:00.000Z	chalcedony		how do i get my window down from there?
2006-08-14T12:54:00.000Z	chalcedony		please can someone tell me how to move this window with the top bar stuck up at the top?
2006-08-14T12:55:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	You should be able to click on the top bar and hide it
2006-08-14T12:55:00.000Z	chalcedony	kleedrac	click how? nothing happens?
2006-08-14T12:57:00.000Z	chalcedony		nobody knows how to pick up this window and move it with the top bar stuck up there.. and i can't get the taskbar to do anything but sit there.
2006-08-14T12:57:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	You should be able to right-click the top bar ... maybe I'm not understanding ... are you saying that the top of the application window is underneath the top gnome bar?
2006-08-14T12:58:00.000Z	chalcedony	kleedrac	up
2006-08-14T12:58:00.000Z	chalcedony		yes
2006-08-14T12:58:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	You should be able to right click on that top bar and get a context menu, yes?
2006-08-14T12:58:00.000Z	chalcedony	kleedrac	is 'delete this panel' what i want?
2006-08-14T12:59:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	NO
2006-08-14T12:59:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	you'd have to re-create that top panel
2006-08-14T12:59:00.000Z	chalcedony	kleedrac	i'm glad i didn't click that, then
2006-08-14T12:59:00.000Z	chalcedony		oh:(
2006-08-14T13:00:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	but in panel preferences you can add the hide arrows on the sides ... then click one and the bar disappears till you click the arrow again
2006-08-14T13:00:00.000Z	chalcedony	kleedrac	ok where is panel preferences?
2006-08-14T13:01:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	It probably just says preferences
2006-08-14T13:01:00.000Z	chalcedony		didn't say that, either
2006-08-14T13:02:00.000Z	chalcedony	kleedrac	IT WORKS :)) and ty i wondered where those went :)))
2006-08-14T13:02:00.000Z	kleedrac	chalcedony	no problem :)
