2009-04-25T21:37:00.000Z	Polterge|st		the alternate install dvd has a default option to use the internet to download packages whether you click yes or no when the upgrade option box pops up after installing the dvd
2009-04-25T21:38:00.000Z	Polterge|st		if you have an internet connection it will use it whether you tell it to or not
2009-04-25T21:38:00.000Z	Polterge|st		even if you think you are selecting the option to tell it not to
2009-04-25T21:40:00.000Z	Polterge|st		this is kind of like false advertising if I cannot upgrade using the CD files instead of the net
2009-04-25T21:40:00.000Z	Polterge|st		I have 2 ubuntu 9.04 dvds and ironically with both of them I cannot upgrade my OS to 9.04
2009-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	Polterge|st		not from my computer anyway
2009-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	Polterge|st		it is forcing me to use a net connection
2009-04-25T21:42:00.000Z	Polterge|st		I don't know why I have to wait 2 more days to upgrade my OS on dialup when I have the ___________ dvd's right here in front of me
2009-04-25T21:42:00.000Z	Polterge|st		frustrating
2009-04-25T21:42:00.000Z	Polterge|st		that is not logical to design an upgrade this way
2009-04-25T21:43:00.000Z	h8red	Polterge|st	 Sorry man I don't think you can really get by with dialup and this OS
2009-04-25T21:43:00.000Z	Polterge|st	h8red	you can but it will take a looooooooooooooong time
2009-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	Polterge|st		and if not well I guess it is good enough reason to switch to primarily using a mac
2009-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	h8red	Polterge|st	 or another distro of Linux
2009-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	Polterge|st		nope a mac
2009-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	h8red		yuck
2009-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	Polterge|st		I'm going to be burnt out after Ubuntu
2009-04-25T21:45:00.000Z	Polterge|st		if the best distro on the net can't give me what I need ...
2009-04-25T21:45:00.000Z	Polterge|st		I doubt another will
2009-04-25T21:45:00.000Z	Polterge|st		ok
2009-04-25T21:45:00.000Z	h8red	Polterge|st	 best is subjective
