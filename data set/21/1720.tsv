2010-05-19T03:34:00.000Z	jd_		some font sizes are good, some others not
2010-05-19T03:34:00.000Z	jd_		for instance, the system settings' font size is good... but firefox's bookmarks are huge
2010-05-19T03:35:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	jd_	  maybe its your browsers fonts that need changing
2010-05-19T03:36:00.000Z	jd_	BlAck6j73	no, XChat fonts are not good either
2010-05-19T03:36:00.000Z	jd_		I remember installing a package on karmic that added a menu in the system settings
2010-05-19T03:36:00.000Z	jd_		but I don't remember its name...
2010-05-19T03:38:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	jd_	  so are all your apps  looking weird?
