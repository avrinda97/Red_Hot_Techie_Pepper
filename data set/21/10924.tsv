2004-10-02T16:34:00.000Z	Cardador		i guess all the devs are sleeping :)
2004-10-02T09:17:00.000Z	Cardador		i corrected my partition table with suse 9.1 cd, some time ago
2004-10-02T09:17:00.000Z	Cardador		there is an howto somewhere
2004-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	this is a legitimate bug in Ubuntu which we should just fix
2004-10-02T12:53:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	not unless you want to go through the spiel above later
2004-10-02T12:53:00.000Z	Cardador	Kamion	you have a point
2004-10-04T16:26:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	install openssh-server
2004-10-04T16:27:00.000Z	Cardador	Kamion	i wanted to acess the pc that is on my workplace
2004-10-04T05:19:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	right-click then eject should unmount the CD first
2004-10-04T05:19:00.000Z	Cardador	Kamion	i know that
2004-10-04T05:19:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	if that doesn't happen, please file a bug
2004-10-04T05:19:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	the fact that the eject button doesn't work is enforced by the kernel, to avoid data corruption
2004-10-04T05:20:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	ah, in the daily CD builds an icon pops up on your desktop for the CD
2004-10-04T05:20:00.000Z	Cardador	Kamion	ok
2004-10-04T05:21:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	that should help out the new users, we think; it's kind of a stopgap measure, and we'd like to do something better for the next release
2004-10-04T05:21:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	there was a fair amount of talk at the technical board meeting about it :)
2004-10-04T05:21:00.000Z	Cardador	Kamion	what about a panel applet?
2004-10-04T05:21:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	that's probably what we'll do for the next release
2004-10-04T05:21:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	but it wasn't written/tested/debugged in time
2004-10-04T05:22:00.000Z	Kamion	Cardador	time-based releases, feel the love :-)
