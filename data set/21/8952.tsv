2006-06-15T09:41:00.000Z	harry_		when using dapper i dont need to change the sources.list right????
2006-06-15T09:42:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	you don't *need* to change it, but you might *want* to
2006-06-15T09:42:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	why is that???
2006-06-15T09:42:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	uh, to add new repositories.
2006-06-15T09:44:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	ubotu is a bot
2006-06-15T09:44:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	the instruction might be for Breezy, but they work perfectly for Dapper if you just change "breezy" into "dapper" in the files you edit
2006-06-15T09:45:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	i dont get it if you just change "breezy" into "dapper" in the files you edit
2006-06-15T09:47:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	those links that Ubotu give tell you how to add the Universe and Multiverse repositories to your sources.list. Some of those links might be for Breezy, so they probably mention "breezy" somewhere in the sources.list. If you change instances of "breezy" into "dapper" in the sources.list, it will work for Dapper too
2006-06-15T09:47:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	i got it
2006-06-15T09:48:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	i didnt know ubotu was a bot. thats why i always get the same answer if i ask to complicated question
2006-06-15T09:51:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	it's called alacarte
2007-03-23T11:47:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	i don't think... it depends more on the program itself
2007-03-23T11:48:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	watch the language
2007-05-31T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	right
2007-05-31T14:13:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	So is there a way to put my computer into a mode where it's queiter eg, no fan, but still on (not doing anything)
2007-05-31T14:14:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	you can turn off the HD's. turning *off* the fans is not recommended at all, you may (if the hardware allows that) make them run slower.
2007-05-31T14:14:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	what's your CPU?
2007-05-31T14:15:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	It's a sockect 478 Intel P4
2007-05-31T14:18:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	ok. try "man hdparm", and search for "standby". there are a few options to let you make the drive turn off on inactivity. you can make the options stay by editing /etc/hdparm.conf (though it's possible that your HD will just remember them).  as for fans, install "lm-sensors": it contains a "fancontrol" script which can control fan speeds based on sensor-detected temperatures. you need to run "pwmconfig" to configure it, and you should also make sure
2007-05-31T14:19:00.000Z	LjL	harry_	also, no init.d script is provided with fancontrol, so you will have to run it manually or make your own init.d script. BE CAREFUL anyway, since if fancontrol crashes or gets killed for any reason, and doesn't manage to restore full-speed for your fans, hardware damage may occur.
2007-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	harry_	LjL	Thanks. I'll look at that stuff.
