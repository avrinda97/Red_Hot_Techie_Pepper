2010-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	chalcedony		my husband has kubuntu 8.04 .. i didnt realize he had downgraded so far. i tried to upgrae his flash and broke it. is there something that will tell me how 1. to back up his stuff to another box/ drive  2. do whatever to prepare his drive. 3. get 10.04 and 4. get his stuff back on it?
2010-09-05T12:45:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	You should back up ~/ and /etc -- That's it.
2010-09-05T12:45:00.000Z	chalcedony	red2kic	ty
2010-12-14T10:50:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	That does not look clean/new? "#AllowUsers chull llhull warp craig"
2010-12-14T10:51:00.000Z	chalcedony	red2kic	one of those is what i'm trying to use
2010-12-14T10:52:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Are you and that hubby on local network? Not behind a router?
2010-12-14T10:53:00.000Z	chalcedony	red2kic	there's a router but i can ping him and i can ssh to his other drives
2010-12-14T11:21:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	I'm so sorry. Tools like ssh are meant to make life easier for everybody. You got the short stick. :(
2010-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Meh. Not really. Seems like you're able to ssh but receive wrong password. Could try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server" -- Otherwise, I don't know what else to say.
2010-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	chalcedony	red2kic	ill try that, thanks :)
2010-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Try creating a new password "passwd chull" on the machine you're trying to ssh in -- and use the new password. See if that works.
2010-12-14T11:50:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Or was it craig.
2010-12-14T11:50:00.000Z	chalcedony	red2kic	craig's box .. i'll go there and try those
2010-12-14T11:51:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Do "passwd craig" -- Generate a new password for sudo. See if you can ssh in with new password.

2010-12-14T12:06:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Try "mv ~/.ssh ~/.ssh-bak" -- This is ridiculous. :(
2010-12-14T12:07:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	(On the client).
2010-12-14T12:07:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	(Craigs)
2010-12-14T12:08:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Is Craig / chull able to ssh itself in with the new password?
2011-01-24T09:56:00.000Z	chalcedony	red2kic	isn't it lovely?
2011-01-24T09:57:00.000Z	red2kic	chalcedony	Ha. killall seems to be excessive act.
