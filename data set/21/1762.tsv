2010-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	I am looking for you and trying to figure it out for ya
2010-05-04T10:56:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	thanks!!
2010-05-04T10:58:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	well I can tell you right off the bat, the NualaBlack and BLue and Graphite and those themes, you need to have emerald installed, then open the emerald theme manager and you can install those .emerald files
2010-05-04T10:58:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	i figured - i'm installing emerald now
2010-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	did you get it to work?
2010-05-04T11:07:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	no i didn't - every time i click the file in emerald theme manager it doesn't change a thing
2010-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	are you running compiz atm?
2010-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	yeah like the cube and all that
2010-05-04T11:09:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	believe so
2010-05-04T11:09:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	hit ctrl alt R I think, it should bring up RUN APPLICATION, type in that emerald --replace, see if that shows it then.
2010-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	woo woo :) thanks
2010-05-04T11:11:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	welcome, now if you want it to stay that way permanently, you will need to change the command that controls the window decorations in Compiz config settings manager, just to let you know.
2010-05-04T11:12:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	what do you mean?
2010-05-04T11:12:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	meaning if you restart or log out and log back in right now, that will be changed at the top, the window buttons and all that, it will be what it was before. If you want it to use the emerald theme from now on I can tell you how to set it to do so if you want.
2010-05-04T11:13:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	that'd be great
2010-05-04T11:14:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	System => Preferences => Compiz Config Settings Manager, scroll down till you see  Window Decoration, open that and you will see something that says Command: /usr/bin/compiz-decorator <== change that to emerald --replace
2010-05-07T05:10:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	do you have a link the icons?
2010-05-07T05:11:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	https://launchpad.net/elementaryicons
2010-05-07T05:13:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	amabo	open appearance, click install and find the elementary....gz file click it. will say apply them click that. done
2010-05-07T05:14:00.000Z	amabo	UbuntuJeff	thanks :)
