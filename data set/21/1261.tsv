2010-11-27T08:57:00.000Z	Guest47299		I was wandering I am currently on kde 3.5, is it worth it at all to go to 4.0 and up or will it slow down a lot of stuff like vista?
2010-11-27T08:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	what version of kubuntu
2010-11-27T08:57:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	10.10 Maverick
2010-11-27T08:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	from a PPA?
2010-11-27T08:58:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	yeah
2010-11-27T08:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	doubtful
2010-11-27T08:58:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	i was just asking if I should upgrade or not
2010-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	I forget where I installed kubuntu from
2010-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	you purged it? in lieu of the ppa?
2010-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	no I installed normal ubuntu, then I installed kde 3.5, and I am wandering if 4.0 would slow down my system
2010-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	if you can run gnome, then kde4 wont be an issue
2010-11-27T09:00:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	weird part is gnome slows down my games kde 3.5 doesnt, so I am worried 3d games on kde 4.0 will slow down like gnome
2010-11-27T09:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	not sure there, as I dont run 3D games
2010-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	for 3D likely the proprietary one
2010-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	thats the one from the website right? sorry its late for me
2010-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	from hardware drivers though, not the website
2010-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	keep in mind you'll need to reconfigure it once there is a kernel update; the open source works great here, but I dont play 3D games so you mileage may vary
2010-11-27T09:04:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	so your saying for 3d I should install the one from the website I know about the kernel parts
2010-11-27T09:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	from hardware drivers (additional drivers) not the website
2010-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	Guest47299	bazhang	okay then that wont change much drivers wise I mean, cause thats what I am running right now
2010-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest47299	that wont change it, no
