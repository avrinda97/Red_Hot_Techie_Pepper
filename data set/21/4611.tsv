2008-03-24T13:35:00.000Z	stiffler		is totem using gstreamer ?
2008-03-24T13:35:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	totem uses gstreamer unless you install totem-xine
2008-03-24T13:35:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	which, by the way, is a good idea because gstreamer seems to play DVDs better
2008-03-24T13:36:00.000Z	stiffler	saminthemiddle	I have standard totem for ubuntu-desktop package, this totem using gstreamer yep?
2008-03-24T13:36:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	unless you went out of your way to change it, yes :-)
2008-03-24T13:36:00.000Z	stiffler	saminthemiddle	I wanna add amrnb plugins to play amr files by totem
2008-03-24T13:36:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	I don't know what they are but let me look in apt for a package that might do that, one moment plz
2008-03-24T13:38:00.000Z	stiffler	saminthemiddle	I'm looking for amr plugins in repository ;/
2008-03-24T13:38:00.000Z	stiffler		but I can't find it
2008-03-24T13:40:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	well, google brings rumors of a plug-in called gstamrnbenc that can do AMR files, but I can't find it in the repos
2008-03-24T13:42:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	where can I download an AMR file, maybe it will work on my computer?
2008-03-24T13:43:00.000Z	stiffler	saminthemiddle	what distro do you have ?
2008-03-24T13:43:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	ubuntu, of course
2008-03-24T13:43:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	this IS #ubuntu
2008-03-24T13:43:00.000Z	stiffler	saminthemiddle	well, I have ubuntu too
2008-03-24T13:44:00.000Z	stiffler		maybe on hardy will be plugins for gst to play amr files ;)
2008-03-24T13:44:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	if you direct me to a place where I can download a file to test I can tell you if it works on my computer
2008-03-24T13:44:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	and I know what I did to my computer
2008-03-24T13:46:00.000Z	stiffler	saminthemiddle	do you have a mobile which can record videos ?
2008-03-24T13:46:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	nope, I have a mobile that can dial phone numbers!
2008-03-24T13:54:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	stiffler	hey, are you still breathing?
