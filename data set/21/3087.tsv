2009-07-23T15:56:00.000Z	Yanick_		hi, I have found the problem with the tomcat6 installation. The file /usr/share/tomcat6/bin/bootstrap.jar is not created by the package
2009-07-23T15:57:00.000Z	Yanick_		actually, bootstrap.jar is never created whatsoever, and does not exist anywhere on the file system
2009-07-23T15:59:00.000Z	Yanick_		line 97 of /etc/init.d/tomcat6 is "if [ ! -f "$CATALINA_HOME/bin/bootstrap.jar" ]; then" where $CATALINA refers to /usr/share/tomcat6 but the file does not exist. How can I create this file?
2009-07-23T16:01:00.000Z	Yanick_		can someone help?
2009-07-23T16:02:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	did you remove the 'tomcat' package?
2009-07-23T16:03:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	it sounds like you removed, but didn't purge, tomcat6
2009-07-23T16:03:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	removed, reinstalled, purged, cleaned.... installed again... several times
2009-08-14T22:48:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	I don't know. Sounds like you need to learn how to use SVN ;)
2009-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	very funny.... "Override and commit" is NOT suppose to revert!!!
2009-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	SVN is horrible - you can only commit on the very head (SVN doesn't support non-linear history) so you need to merge before committing.
2009-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	#subversion
2009-08-14T22:50:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	the question was not about svn, it's about recovering the deleted files removed by eclipse
2009-08-14T22:50:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	#eclipse
2009-08-14T22:51:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	if I was on Windows, I would download undelete and restore the files. This has nothing to do with svn or eclipse, but Linux
2009-08-14T22:51:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	oh, you want a file recovery program?
2009-08-14T22:52:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	amonst other thing. I have downloaded foremost, but I doN,t know how to restore PHP files, is it the same as restoring txt files?

2009-08-14T22:53:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	I'm on ext4
2009-08-14T22:53:00.000Z	xlq	Yanick_	PHP files *are* text files
2009-08-14T22:53:00.000Z	Yanick_	xlq	then I can just restore with foremost using txt as extension?
