2008-04-29T04:52:00.000Z	fevel		my sound is really low, even when its on loudest
2008-04-29T04:52:00.000Z	fevel		I am using alsa
2008-04-29T04:52:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	check the whole chain (master, pcm, wave)
2008-04-29T04:53:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	if one of those 3 is low you won't be able to put it higher than this
2008-04-29T04:53:00.000Z	fevel	deathmask	 how?
2008-04-29T04:53:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	uh, any mixer app... :)
2008-04-29T04:53:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	i'm not sure if alsamixer will still work with the new sound thing...
2008-04-29T04:53:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	but if it does, try aptitude install alsamixer and run it
2008-04-29T04:54:00.000Z	fevel	deathmask	 maybe I can tweak to get even higher volume?
2008-04-29T04:54:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	think so...
2008-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	well i won't recommend that, on most sound drivers under linux you are able to put it higher than "maximal" values under windows, which will result in distorting signals, nevermind what comes behind your soundcard
2008-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	so if you wanna make it louder use your amplifier :)
2008-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	so you won't get distortions
2008-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	also use sane settings
2008-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	fevel	deathmask	 what do you man amplifiers? Bigger sound device?
2008-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	uhm no.... i mean your pc loudspeakers or your stereo amplifier
2008-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	i mean you should not just put all those faders to max level
2008-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	it COULD distort
2008-04-29T04:58:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	and you should doublecheck that
2008-04-29T04:58:00.000Z	fevel	deathmask	 ok, thankfor the help man
2008-04-29T04:58:00.000Z	deathmask	fevel	no worries :)
