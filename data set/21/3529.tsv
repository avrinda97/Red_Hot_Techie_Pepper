2008-12-17T03:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier		hi. i am running the ati fglrx driver and would like to check out the compiz window manager. i have seen conflicting descriptions/info on how to enable the Composite Extension. some say to use >Option "Composite" "1"<, other say to use >Option "Composite" "Enable"<. i am wondering which is the correct way, what else i might need to do before trying compiz? and lastly, the best method for starting up the compiz wm.
2008-12-17T03:13:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	I use fglrx, and I only needed to do System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects > Normal to get compiz turned on. For more advanced settings, see !ccsm
2008-12-17T03:13:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	(i.e., I didn't need to put anything in xorg.conf to make it work)
2008-12-17T03:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	ok, thank  you!
2008-12-17T03:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	hello. just to let you know, i made the Extensions section in my xorg.conf file like so...Option "Composite" "Enable". then i searched my log(/var/log/Xorg.0.log) file for the 'Composite' and got --> (**) Extension "Composite" is enabled
2008-12-17T03:34:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	Huh. I don't have that extension enabled, but Compiz works fine for me. Whatever works for you, I guess :)
2008-12-17T03:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	my appearance visual effects preference was already at 'Normal'. however, i went ahead up upped to 'extra'. but that does not take me into the compiz wm...
2008-12-17T03:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	i'm stillinthe default metacity wm
2008-12-17T03:36:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	you're sure? Like, metacity is showing up in ps -AH and compiz isn't?
2008-12-17T03:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	i hear that the compiz wm has a 3d spinning cube... do you have that?
2008-12-17T03:38:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	I could get most of Compiz to work, but not the cube thingie. Maybe if I turned on that extension it would work...
2008-12-17T03:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	roger... i do see a compiz process in ps -AH, so yes.. i guess that why i have some nice eye-candy effects :-)
2008-12-17T03:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	i just thought i would see 3d spinning cube like i've seen in screenshots, so, yep... it is working! thank you replies and time
2008-12-24T14:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	wow, that looks like a pretty hefty command there
2008-12-24T14:28:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	Yeah, I didn't make it. Not even sure what bits of it do =/
2008-12-24T14:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	ahh, i see. i have some like that saved in a file myself ;-)
2008-12-24T14:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	you should consider having him use 'checkinstall'
2008-12-27T09:34:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	upgrading from iso or CD is only supported by the alternate iso, not the desktop iso, according to the wiki
2008-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	ahh-ha. roger. i am thinking about installing jaunty fresh on my available free hard drive space. i'm thinking i'll try the desktop image
2010-05-10T11:32:00.000Z	rww	onetinsoldier	ActionParsnip: ubuntu-minimal is an only-barely-usable command-line system. ubuntu-standard is probably better to recommend.
2010-05-10T11:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rww	ahh, roger. thanks
