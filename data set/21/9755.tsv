2005-07-18T07:45:00.000Z	aio	scsponger	does it pop up nautilus in burn:/// and not let you burn?

2005-07-18T07:47:00.000Z	aio	scsponger	that's a little comforting that it may not be my hardware :-)

2005-07-18T07:48:00.000Z	aio	scsponger	yeah - i rebooted couple times and it started behaving a little better, but i'm still concerned it may happen smoe more...

2005-07-18T07:54:00.000Z	aio	scsponger	hmmm...ok - you got me stumped.  i dunno.  have you googled around?
2005-07-18T07:56:00.000Z	scsponger	aio	... any ideas?
2005-07-18T07:57:00.000Z	aio	scsponger	none...you could try rebooting.  that probably won't help you.  you could try removing the hardware configuration from wherever you can and reboot and see if ubuntu reconfgirues it...
2005-07-18T08:04:00.000Z	scsponger	aio	... you still there?
2005-07-18T08:07:00.000Z	aio	scsponger	i'm peeking in from time to time.
