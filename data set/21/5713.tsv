2008-04-14T23:40:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	That's not a great pic.  Solid Slate Modified is basically all the stuff on the borders of the window.  Like the close, minimize, maximize buttons.
2008-04-14T23:40:00.000Z	arunkale	levander	i'm guessing it's an emerald theme?
2008-04-14T23:41:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	Yeah, I never bothered using the compiz stuff till I found that theme.
2008-04-14T23:41:00.000Z	arunkale	levander	compiz doesn't really work on my computer
2008-04-14T23:41:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	That's some african skins, one of which is elephant, that I use as a GDM greeter.  arunkale I'll PM you the themes I use.
2008-04-14T23:41:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	That sux.
2008-04-14T23:42:00.000Z	arunkale	levander	yup.. i have a new nvidia graphics card, but it doesn't work properly, so yeah
2008-04-14T23:42:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	Basically, for window themes, I like all the "slate" variants.  Slate is basically a rip off of the Windows border themes, but I tell you, I hate Microsoft, but border themes is the one thing they did that I really like.
2008-04-14T23:42:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	Did you get the nvidia driver installed okay?
2008-04-14T23:43:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	There are many slate variants that aren't emerald, but I didn't like any of those as much.  But, I did like them.
2008-04-14T23:44:00.000Z	arunkale	levander	yup, the driver has installed properly, but i can't get compiz to work well.. it's not a huge deal, but yeah, it's a little irritating
2008-04-14T23:44:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	Just search on art.gnome.org for slate, and you'll find a bunch of them.
2008-04-14T23:44:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	What's wrong with compiz on your box?  The nvidia driver should be the only hardware specific thing.
2008-04-14T23:45:00.000Z	arunkale	levander	black screens, etc. the usual problems
2008-04-14T23:45:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	I've never heard of those...  Maybe just cause I never had them, I never had to google for it.  Maybe it'll work better for you in Hardy??
2008-04-14T23:46:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	AMD shouldn't make a difference.
2008-04-14T23:46:00.000Z	arunkale	levander	 yeah, maybe it will :)
2008-04-14T23:49:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	You getting these PM's?
2008-04-14T23:49:00.000Z	levander	arunkale	Here are the GDM themese I use: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Africa+GDM+Themes?content=67562
