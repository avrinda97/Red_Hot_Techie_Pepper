2008-05-18T18:28:00.000Z	nogeek		hi, I experience a critical bug in 8.04 but I have no idea how to file it since GDM is crashing. Please help.
2008-05-18T18:29:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	can you elaborate
2008-05-18T18:34:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	starting some videos in totem can make GDM crash, i.e. new log-in required. I see no pattern. Same issue with Kaffeine (which I use for DVB-T). Here the STOP-function leaves the last image in the window -- alike PAUSE. When covering this left window for a while with others, putting it back in front causes the same GDM-crash. Understandable?
2008-05-18T18:35:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	don't report this against gdm, though. It's an xorg problem -- probably of the video driver. What's your card?
2008-05-18T18:36:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	intel 945, Acer laptop
2008-05-18T18:36:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	and you're using the intel or i810 driver?
2008-05-18T18:37:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	how do I know?
2008-05-18T18:37:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	from /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-05-18T18:38:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	this file should hold some information about the crash as well, before it restarts
2008-05-18T18:40:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	you might log in on a text console (Ctrl-Alt-F2), do a 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop', then run X with startx, reproduce the crash, then make a copy of the log file in your home directory with 'cp /var/log/Xorg.0.log ~'
2008-05-18T18:40:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	(II) intel: Driver for Intel Integrated Graphics Chipsets: i810, etc | (--) Chipset 945GM found
2008-05-18T18:41:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	i810 then. Is it a fresh installation? Which version of Ubuntu?
2008-05-18T18:42:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	Hardy no build-essential-tweaks
2008-05-18T18:43:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	did you see my line about how to gather information about the crash?
2008-05-18T18:45:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	I just try to grasp it. I'll print it and then do it. Where could the crash be recorded already? what do I have to look for?
2008-05-18T18:45:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	when X has just crashed, the information goes into Xorg.0.log. When gdm restarts, it will get overwritten.
2008-05-18T18:46:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	the information you need should be at the end of the file. If you report a bug against xorg, it's no mistake to attach the entire log.
2008-05-18T18:48:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	can I then also after a crash just shut down and boot into XP and copy the log from here?
2008-05-18T18:48:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	only if you have an ext3 filesystem driver for Windows
2008-05-18T18:49:00.000Z	soundray	nogeek	sorry, have to leave
2008-05-18T18:49:00.000Z	nogeek	soundray	thanks yes I do
