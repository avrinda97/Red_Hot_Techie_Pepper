2008-12-26T08:07:00.000Z	R1_		Does anyone know why the xorg.conf file in ubuntu 8.10 is almost empty?
2008-12-26T08:08:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	the new xorg is automagic - meaning it configures itself automatically without relying on a configuration file (xorg.conf)
2008-12-26T08:10:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	so say I installed the application Touchpad which requires shmconfig to be "true" in xorg.conf but xorg.conf does not contain the synaptic input section anymore. Would the only way to enable shmconfig be making a shmconfig file in /etc/hal/fdi/policy/ dir?
2008-12-26T08:10:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	no, as Zzeiss says - you can put directives in xorg.conf to override automagic settings with your own
2008-12-26T08:11:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	so it's a matter of creating the appropriate input device section
2008-12-26T08:12:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	I supposed a quick google search would  provide instructions how to appropriately add input device sections?
2008-12-26T08:12:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	sure, but the authoritative source might be the xorg.conf manpage  i.e.   man xorg.conf
2008-12-26T08:13:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	thanks I'll check out the manual
2008-12-27T18:09:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	is there a timeout period when using su-to-root?
2008-12-27T18:10:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	errm i don't think so - as far as i can tell, su-to-root is only a wrapper script around su
2008-12-27T18:12:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	i made a shortcut to a gnome application and in the command i started it with su-to-root to run the application as root. But it only asks me for the root password the first time run the shortcut, any time after when i want to run it again, it doesn't ask me for password anymore, just starts the app
2008-12-27T18:12:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	so you want the thing to ask for a password everytime ??
2008-12-27T18:12:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	so i was wondering if there was a way to time out this command? it's not safe to let a program run as root anytime without asking for pw
2008-12-27T18:13:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	yes i want it to ask for a password because i'm running the app as root
2008-12-27T18:14:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	why not use su instead then??  it asks for a password everytime
2008-12-27T18:14:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	or sudo (with the -k option)
2008-12-27T18:15:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	i used su-to-root because i was just mimicking the command of another shortcut that was installed and ran as root. Is there another way to run gnome program from root?
2008-12-27T18:15:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	actually i take back the sudo thing - don't try it
2008-12-27T18:15:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	yea, there's  gksu or gksudo
2008-12-27T18:17:00.000Z	R1_	unop_	sorry my connection is messy right now, if you've said something to me i've completely missed everything
2008-12-27T18:18:00.000Z	unop_	R1_	yea, there's  gksu or gksudo
