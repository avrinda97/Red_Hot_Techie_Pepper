2009-05-25T10:44:00.000Z	neil_d		I have a pendrive in a computer, but I can't seem to mount it :(  lsusb shows "Bus 005 Device 003: ID 03f0:3217 Hewlett-Packard"  what can I do to fix this.
2009-05-25T10:44:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	does it appear in sudo fdisk -l ?
2009-05-25T10:45:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	it doesn't seem to only /dev/sda etc. (HDD)
2009-05-25T10:45:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	unplug it and replug it in and then pastebin the output of dmesg
2009-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	I can't... I am not physically at the computer.  Connected via ssh and vncviewer.
2009-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	err right. then how did you plug said thumbdrive in?
2009-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	someone else did.
2009-05-25T10:48:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	okay, can I have your dmesg output anyway please (and also you're sure they plugged it in?)
2009-05-25T10:54:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	its plugged in it show in the 'Places' menu.
2009-05-25T10:59:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	here is the /var/log/dmesg file
2009-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	do you still want to look at the /var/log/dmesg
2009-08-10T06:08:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	please pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l
2009-08-10T06:11:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	http://paste.ubuntu.com/250599/
2009-08-10T06:11:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	and this was with the flash drive plugged in?
2009-08-10T06:12:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	yes... according to lsusb
2009-08-10T06:12:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	hmm, does the flash drive work on other computers/OS's?
2009-08-10T06:13:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	yes.. Widows, it has a file that is wanted.
2009-08-10T06:14:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	well its most odd as fdisk does not detect and flash drives. Could unplug and replug the flash drive and pastebin the output of dmesg upon doing so
2009-08-10T06:18:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	this appears to be section you want. http://paste.ubuntu.com/250602/
2009-08-10T06:18:00.000Z	ziroday	neil_d	hmm it really doesn't like that flash drive. I would check to make sure its still working, and reformat it
2009-08-10T06:19:00.000Z	neil_d	ziroday	running version 2.6.24-24-generic of the kernel.... downloading update now.
