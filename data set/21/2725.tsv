2009-07-12T16:28:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	actually it is an make error ,i did it before with a patch,but i cant now,cant find the patch

2009-07-12T16:31:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	morteza@Moris:~/wdriver$ make -C /lib/modules/2.6.28-13-generic/build M='pwd' clean
2009-07-12T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	i said pastebin
2009-07-12T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	imagine if say 10 people did that, the channel would be useless. Think next time
2009-07-12T16:33:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	sorry,http://paste.ubuntu.com/216176/
2009-07-12T16:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	the kernel source is already referenced, try just running   make clean
2009-07-12T16:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	if you run:   file /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.28-13-generic
2009-07-12T16:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	does it say it is a folder?
2009-07-12T16:37:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	do u mean enter"make clean"?
2009-07-12T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	makes sense, yes
2009-07-12T16:38:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	make: *** No rule to make target `clean'.  Stop.
2009-07-12T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	have you read the install and readme files in the archive you extracted?
2009-07-12T16:39:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	yes
2009-07-12T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	where did you get the archive, i'll have a look at it
2009-07-12T16:41:00.000Z	Morteza_K	ActionParsnip	i ask it someone in #kernel,M=$pwd instead of M='pwd',and it worked,thanks
2009-07-12T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	you may want to tell the person who made the guide
2009-07-12T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Morteza_K	so it can be updated to be correct
