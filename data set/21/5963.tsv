2009-02-05T18:49:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	done that. it spews out the colour codes

2009-02-05T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	do you still receive an error after « unset LS_COLORS »?
2009-02-05T18:55:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	i dont get an error after i do that. but when i restart the terminal the error comes up again
2009-02-05T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	what version of ubuntu?
2009-02-05T18:55:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	8.10
2009-02-05T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	amd64 or i386?
2009-02-05T18:56:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	i386
2009-02-05T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	md5sum /bin/ls
2009-02-05T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	well hits on google have people claiming their computer was compromised, but your md5sum for ls matches mine.  Is it a possibility though?  Do you have a weak password for someone to ssh or similar?
2009-02-05T19:01:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	lol you want me to type my password and let you judge
2009-02-05T19:01:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	i got a feeling this is linked to me installing KDE4. now my VLC controls look different
2009-02-05T19:02:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	im just gonna restart and hope the kinks work out themselves
2009-02-05T19:02:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	erm, is that "yes, it's possible" or "no, I don't use ssh"?
2009-02-05T19:03:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	yes i have been experiementing with SSH
2009-02-05T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	and: « which ls »?
2009-02-05T19:04:00.000Z	Praveen	jrib	/bin/ls
2009-02-05T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	Praveen	I'd run chkrootkit and read the google hits for "ls: unrecognized prefix: do" as some of them are quite detailed (for example: http://www.jiny.kr/jiny/tag/365 )  If you do have some sort of rootkit, then I'd just reinstall (and be more careful with ssh and whatever other services you run).
