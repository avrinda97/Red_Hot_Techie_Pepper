2008-02-16T04:36:00.000Z	pocketdrummer		Is there a way to make Rhythymbox the default app for ogg? It's not even on the list, but it's installed.
2008-02-16T04:38:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	right-click on an ogg file, choose Open With; Open with other application, if you don't see rb in the list there, Use a custom command and browse to it
2008-02-16T04:38:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	I'm not sure where to browse to though :-/
2008-02-16T04:39:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	/usr/bin/rhythmbox
2008-02-16T04:40:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	So, I was told that linux doesn't install things to a designated folder (like program files in windows), so how do you know where things are installed?
2008-02-16T04:40:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	it's a linux convention to put programs in /usr/bin/
2008-02-16T04:40:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	linux does put things in specific places -- by convention -- but just like windows, the files could be installed anywhere
2008-02-16T04:41:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	oh ok, thanks man
2008-02-16T04:41:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	my pleasure
2008-02-16T04:42:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	So, should I point it to Rhythymbox or Rhythymbox-client?
2008-02-16T04:44:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	I'd try rhythmbox -- but it's weird that it doesn't appear in the list for you, since it does for me
2008-02-16T04:45:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	Yeah, I can right click and choose rhythymbox, but If I go to properties - open with, it doesn't show up there... just movie player.
2008-02-16T04:47:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	you put in /usr/bin/rhythmbox in the "use a custom command" box and it didn't work?
2008-02-16T04:47:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	Yep.
2008-02-16T04:47:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	are you sure it's installed?
2008-02-16T04:48:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	I just did exactly that on my machine and it worked
2008-02-16T04:48:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	Maybe I should reinstall? I mean, I can open rhythymbox and play it, but I can launch rhythymbox by clicking on the song... it's weird.
2008-02-16T04:49:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	it just does nothing?
2008-02-16T04:52:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	Well, it opens, then says not playing (where the track information goes when you play a song)... then closes rhythmbox altogether.
2008-02-16T04:54:00.000Z	vladanian	pocketdrummer	and you can play an ogg in rb, just not by clicking on it? I have no idea why it's not working.
2008-02-16T04:55:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	vladanian	Yeah, I'm stumped too.
