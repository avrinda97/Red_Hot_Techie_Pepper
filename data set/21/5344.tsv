2008-10-30T05:34:00.000Z	seivan		I have been up all night trying to get ubuntu on my mac mini, using both amd 64 and regular 32 bit, both hardy en interprid, both ubuntu and xubuntu, and still get the flashing ?
2008-10-30T05:35:00.000Z	musictoto	seivan	are you setting it up into a virtual machine, or using bootcamp ?
2008-10-30T05:37:00.000Z	seivan	musictoto	bootcamp sorta
2008-10-30T05:37:00.000Z	seivan	musictoto	I just boot the cd, install, 6) Reboot and remember: every time you want to run Ubuntu Linux, you’ll have to keep the alt key pressed during boot and choose “Windows” (Yes, really) from the boot menu that opens.
2008-10-30T05:39:00.000Z	musictoto	seivan	i'm not following you, tell me everything you did, slow
