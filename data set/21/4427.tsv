2008-04-27T13:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	[DS]DragonSlayer	 You may want to check the forums for info on your exact sound card, and that issue. what are you using as a 5.1 source anyway?
2008-04-27T13:30:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		let me give u the link to my post Dr_willis
2008-04-27T13:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	[DS]DragonSlayer	  I doubt if i will be much help. :) im just suggesting checking the forums.
2008-04-27T13:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	[DS]DragonSlayer	 ive always cloned the front to the rear output on my systems for my sound needs.
2008-04-27T13:31:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer	Dr_willis	- i search the whole forum today, i did some of the codes, but my sound is still 2 channel
2008-04-27T13:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	[DS]DragonSlayer	 which is why i asked what 'source' you were using to test this 5.1 stuff..  It may be an issue with how you are making the sounds
2008-04-27T13:32:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		source? i'm sorry i'm like clueless (noob)
2008-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		let me login my ubuntu
2008-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		i'll be back
2008-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	[DS]DragonSlayer	 you aint expecting a  avi thats just in stero to have surround sound are you?
2008-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		it's not that Dr_Willis
2008-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		normally i listen to music in windows, my sound are surround, but on here all i get is 2 channels
2008-04-27T13:34:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		which kinda bugs me to not have the full effect
2008-04-27T13:34:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		brb i shall restart
2008-04-27T13:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	[DS]DragonSlayer	 err.. what music? just mp3's?  as i said earlier - i clone the front to the rear speakers
