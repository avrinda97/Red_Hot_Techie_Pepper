2008-11-30T16:55:00.000Z	blobX	perlmonkey	gonna check that url , thanks
2008-11-30T16:58:00.000Z	perlmonkey	blobX	you should verify the chipset and make sure you have the right driver first of all. you can get info with lspci -v in shell, and also check dmesg to see if driver is loading and/or reporting any errors
2008-11-30T16:59:00.000Z	perlmonkey	blobX	although there is open source driver available from D-Link you may not need to compile it, since theres some native support in Ubuntu but it depends on chipset version... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=43311&highlight=D-Link has more info also
2008-11-30T17:01:00.000Z	blobX	perlmonkey	thanks for links ..gonna do some reaserch and try again, kinda hard to download stuff when you have no access to internet
2008-11-30T17:02:00.000Z	perlmonkey	blobX	aye, you probably won't need to download anything I suspect
