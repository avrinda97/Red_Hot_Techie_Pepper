2009-06-15T16:01:00.000Z	ggg	dsabecky	clicking the add button got a window ,but what would i add?
2009-06-15T16:02:00.000Z	ggg	dsabecky	how would i get that theme to add new ?
2009-06-15T16:02:00.000Z	dsabecky	ggg	Well, you have to download a new theme if you want to add one. Just add the file you downloaded.
2009-06-15T16:02:00.000Z	dsabecky	ggg	It will most likely be a .tar.gz file.
2009-06-15T16:03:00.000Z	ggg	dsabecky	Yes, that's what i looking for. is there any command or any utility to avoid manually download?
2009-06-15T16:04:00.000Z	dsabecky	ggg	No. If you want a theme that isn't already included, you'll have to get it yourself. Check gnome-look.org for gdm themes.
2009-06-15T16:05:00.000Z	ggg	dsabecky	i know about this. but there is a command like "apt-get install gnome-splashscreen" for splashscreen,i am looking for this type of option
2009-06-15T16:06:00.000Z	dsabecky	ggg	A splashscreen is very different than a GDM theme.
2009-06-15T16:07:00.000Z	ggg	dsabecky	is it possible to make my own gdm,?
2009-06-15T16:07:00.000Z	dsabecky	ggg	Yes.
2009-06-15T16:07:00.000Z	ggg	dsabecky	how ,can you give any easy reference?
