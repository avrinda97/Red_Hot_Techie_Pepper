2009-05-18T12:34:00.000Z	tjz	ozzmosis	roger that
2009-05-18T12:33:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	from my own notes: "use realvnc, because tightvnc's server has a broken keymap as at 2009-05-09"
2009-05-18T12:34:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	I've had other problems with vnc in ubuntu 9.04 but don't remember what they were
2009-05-18T12:35:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	something along the lines of the screen not refreshing when I ran realvnc client on an XP box, connecting to Ubuntu
2009-05-18T12:35:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	don't remember which versions of things I was using though
2009-05-18T12:46:00.000Z	tjz	ozzmosis	i tried realvnc.. keyboard also mismatch
2009-05-18T12:49:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	google ubuntu vnc keymap .. may help
2009-05-18T12:49:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	I assume you've disabled Ubuntu's default vnc server then run "vncserver" from the Terminal to use realvnc's
2009-05-18T12:51:00.000Z	tjz	ozzmosis	i am running tightvncserver on the ubuntu
2009-05-18T12:52:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	yep.  disable that and use realvnc's vncserver.
2009-05-18T12:52:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	at least that was my workaround.
2009-05-18T12:53:00.000Z	tjz	ozzmosis	what is command to type to disable tightvncserver? do i uninstall it?
2009-05-18T12:54:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	System -> Prefs -> Remote Desktop
2009-05-18T12:55:00.000Z	tjz	ozzmosis	okay. i have enable that.
2009-05-18T12:58:00.000Z	tjz	ozzmosis	that enable default vnc server?
2009-05-18T12:58:00.000Z	ozzmosis	tjz	yes, disable that
