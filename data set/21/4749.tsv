2008-02-17T20:30:00.000Z	operator2		shall any brave knights harken to the cry, and join in the quest for a lost cd-rom drive damsel in distress?
2008-02-17T20:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	has this always been this way?
2008-02-17T20:35:00.000Z	operator2	prince_jammys	son of king jammys, nay.  had probably with previous gutsy install.  reinstalled for multiple reasons, including, aye, that festering wound.  that reinstall was thus performed from said drive, whence i could perform boot ups.  alas, after the install and the repository download upgrade, the fair cd-rom drive, she disappeared and i have wept ever since.
2008-02-17T20:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	do -->    grep cdrom /etc/fstab  and paste output here
2008-02-17T20:36:00.000Z	operator2	prince_jammys	son of king jamys, i shall instead post to a pastebin server as i write from the alternate machine next door
2008-02-17T20:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	ok, should only be one line
2008-02-17T20:38:00.000Z	operator2	prince_jammys	paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56371
2008-02-17T20:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	mmm that line differs in no way from mine except for the exec option
2008-02-17T20:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	you have two drives?
2008-02-17T20:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	and what happens when you type    mount /media/cdrom0   (with a cd in the drive)
2008-02-17T20:43:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	no error message, nothing?
2008-02-17T20:45:00.000Z	operator2	prince_jammys	at last a response.  "mount: no medium found."
2008-02-17T20:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	mount /media/cdrom1
2008-02-17T20:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	have cds in both drives so we can eliminate that
2008-02-17T20:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	interesting
2008-02-17T20:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	and you had inserted a blank cd?
2008-02-17T20:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	hardware problem is possible - i don't see anything wrong with your setup otherwise - but i'm not an expert
2008-02-17T20:49:00.000Z	operator2	prince_jammys	thanks.  any other opinions?  and what of the "exec" line in my fstab?
2008-02-17T20:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	if you want to mess with that, you could (don't delete the original lines, just put a # at the beginning)
2008-02-17T20:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	things to try would be: a) remove exec b)remove one of the lines and keep scd0 only
2008-02-17T20:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	operator2	yw, let us know if it got fixed and how
