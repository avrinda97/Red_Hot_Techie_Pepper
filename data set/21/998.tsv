2011-04-07T20:13:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	i don't follow ...
2011-04-07T20:13:00.000Z	DasEi	AnubArack	you can set it in the messengers itself, which browser they use for links
2011-04-07T20:14:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	oh, i see
2011-04-07T20:19:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	can you point me in the direction of the config file/menu to set Chrome as defaul browser in xchat? On google i only find windows refferences
2011-04-07T20:21:00.000Z	DasEi	AnubArack	settings > advanced > url handlers...
2011-04-07T20:21:00.000Z	DasEi	AnubArack	settings > advanced > url handlers... ( in xchat GUI)
2011-04-07T20:21:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	that much i found :(
2011-04-07T20:22:00.000Z	DasEi	AnubArack	so add / delete to your need
2011-04-07T20:24:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	I'm still a miss to what I should imput in the command line ... :(
2011-04-07T20:24:00.000Z	DasEi	AnubArack	usr/bin/chromium-browser %U
2011-04-07T20:25:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	ty! I'll try it now, though I'll have to change it a bit since i use dev build
2011-04-07T20:34:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	it didn't work :(
2011-04-07T20:37:00.000Z	DasEi	AnubArack	try simply with chromium-browser
2011-04-07T20:40:00.000Z	AnubArack	DasEi	nope. But it got me thinking ... if it's called a command who runs it ? if it's xchat then maybe it's /exec .....
