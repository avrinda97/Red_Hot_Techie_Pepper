2006-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		I pretty much have screwed over my ubuntu by attempting to upgrade cairo
2006-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		I attempted an install from a debian deb after removing the old version
2006-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		then proceeded to install a new version of libc which it depends on
2006-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		and now pretty much synaptic wants to delete everything on teh system to remove the new version of libc...
2006-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		yeah, pretty retarded
2006-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		I mean, I thought linux package stuff was good.  This is plain orrible
2006-08-30T12:04:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		yeah i know warbo - I did that to remove the old cairo
2006-08-30T12:05:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		godamnit, now both my windows and linux is bricked
2006-08-30T12:05:00.000Z	Bot_Builder		how would i do that?
2006-08-30T12:05:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	answer yes when it says do you want to install the new lib6
2006-08-30T12:07:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	you tried to remove libc6? for that yes it will try to remove everything
2006-08-30T12:08:00.000Z	Bot_Builder	holycow	- no, i installed a new one
2006-08-30T12:08:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	yeah it will try to remove everything or upgrade it as necessary
2006-08-30T12:09:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	well the upgrade the libc6 upgraded everything as well right?
2006-08-30T12:10:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	yeah you can't JUST install libc6 ... everything else needs to be pulled along with it
2006-08-30T12:11:00.000Z	Bot_Builder	holycow	- well, I'm mostly a linux noob
2006-08-30T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	thats okay, the cool thing is you don't haveto phone anyone to 'reactivate' it during reinstall :)
2006-08-30T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	all in learning
2006-08-30T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	if your anoob and don't want to futs, backup your /home and reinstall
2006-08-30T12:13:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	it seems simple on the surface but the process is complicated enough that its simpler to just reinstall
2006-08-30T12:14:00.000Z	holycow	Bot_Builder	not wihtout a lot of work, its far faster to reinstall
