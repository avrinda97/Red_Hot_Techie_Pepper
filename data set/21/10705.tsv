2004-12-16T08:41:00.000Z	rattboi		anyone know why it takes like 20 seconds before xchat starts connecting to anything?
2004-12-16T08:41:00.000Z	rattboi		I'm assuming it's trying IPv6 first, but I'm not sure
2004-12-16T08:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	probably an ident delay
2004-12-16T08:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	frankly I don't bother - I just wait :)
2004-12-17T08:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	you mean it froze, or crashed and disappeared?
2004-12-17T08:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	if it froze, try opening a terminal and typing "xkill" without the quotes
2004-12-17T08:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	aha :)
2004-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	try running ps auxf     to see a tree of processes, and kill the parents if they exist
2005-03-17T08:42:00.000Z	rattboi	thoreauputic	don't be so sure
2005-03-17T08:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	yeah, that wasn't accurate on my part - sorry :)
2005-03-17T08:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	in fact I even have blackbox in OS-X (not that I use it much)
2005-03-17T08:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	right - did you use the fink version?
2005-03-17T08:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	I don't use it, but it has some sophisticated eyecandy
2005-03-17T08:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	tried gdesklets about a year ago, but they wanted to eat all my resources for some reason...
2005-03-17T08:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	I would set umask=002 and id=1000 gid=1000
2005-03-17T08:58:00.000Z	rattboi	thoreauputic	could you give me a little better idea of gid, uid, etc? for fstab
2005-03-17T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	gid=group identification, uid= user identification
2005-03-17T09:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	hmm .... I'm just saying what works for me: try your way and see if it works, I suppose
2005-03-17T09:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	right, i see
2005-03-17T09:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	great :) I'll remember that, thanks
2005-03-17T09:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rattboi	sudo adduser rattboi users
