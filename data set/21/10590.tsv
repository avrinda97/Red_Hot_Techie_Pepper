2005-03-06T14:00:00.000Z	neighborlee		hope someone is alive that plays a few games <G>..i'm trying to install ut2k4 which indeed has a loki based installer.however..running ./linux-installer.sh says permission denied even if  I use sudo..if I use: sh linux-installer.sh it works but I get a nasty ncursed based installer instead of the default loki one...anyh idea why this is happening ? ;-))
