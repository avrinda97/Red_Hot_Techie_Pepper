2006-10-06T13:59:00.000Z	mneptok	viper	if X is having problems starting, it logs those errors to ~/.xsession-erros

2006-10-06T14:00:00.000Z	mneptok	viper	look through those errors, paste them into Google, and see what others have done when faced with your problem

2006-10-06T14:01:00.000Z	mneptok	viper	vi, vim, nano, pico ...
2006-10-06T14:02:00.000Z	mneptok	viper	easiest way is right from CD
2006-10-06T14:02:00.000Z	viper	mneptok	er, won't that result in data loss?
2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	mneptok	viper	not if you don't reformat
2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	mneptok	viper	just tell it to use existing partitions without formatitng them
