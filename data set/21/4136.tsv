2009-08-17T21:33:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	thinking of using samba maybe?
2009-08-17T21:34:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	ok... did you add users which can access the shares or are these open shares?
2009-08-17T21:35:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	usually what I do is create the shared directory, set it to the samba user's group, and add any users that I need
2009-08-17T21:36:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	I think you'll need to make sure that the user you plan to login with over samba also has a system account
2009-08-17T21:37:00.000Z	dcosta	OEP	 it  have
2009-08-17T21:38:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	and this user should have FS permissions which I'm assuming it does... does the share just not show up at all or do you get a "permission denied" error
2009-08-17T21:39:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	if you can't connect it sounds like either the service is being blocked or is not running
2009-08-17T21:40:00.000Z	dcosta	OEP	how you do to connect do folder
2009-08-17T21:40:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	an smb:// URL... seemed like you were doing it right. I usually do Places -> Connecto to server...
2009-08-17T21:42:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	do these machines have some device sitting in between them?
2009-08-17T21:42:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	also you may want to make sure you can connect to the samba server locally.. and it shouldn't matter where the folder is so long as the permissions are right
2009-08-17T21:43:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	on the same side of the router?
2009-08-17T21:44:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	did you check if you can connect locally
2009-08-17T21:44:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	you mean samba works locally right? :P
2009-08-17T21:45:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	is your smb.conf set to accept connections from only certain subnets?
2009-08-17T21:53:00.000Z	dcosta	OEP	can point me a site for i config de smb.conf ok ?
2009-08-17T21:53:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	hold on...
2009-08-17T21:55:00.000Z	OEP	dcosta	have you seen this? it's pretty much what I was going to tell you: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba#Samba%20Server%20Manual%20Configuration
