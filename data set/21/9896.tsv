2005-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	TheCan		hi - anyone running ubuntu on a thinkpad t20/t21/t22 with ACPI who has s3 sleep working? mine already crashes on resume
2005-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	can you get s1 working?
2005-10-20T09:21:00.000Z	TheCan	orangey	yes it seems to work i think - also in APM everything works fine but i want to use acpi for several reasons
2005-10-20T09:21:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	well, s1 in acpi is not as good as s3, but it works waaay more often..
2005-10-20T09:22:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	and it may not be worth the headache to insist on s3
2005-10-20T09:22:00.000Z	TheCan	orangey	in S1 - how much power does it take more compared to S3?
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	I think it's detectable.. i.e., twice as much power or something.
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	but s3 is really good - days.. so you go from several days to maybe a day
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	TheCan	orangey	but display etc. all is still off?
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	yeah. it's good.. do this:
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	pico (or nano) /etc/defaults/acpi-support
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	TheCan	orangey	yeah i know this file thx
2005-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	and in there, change it from "mem" to "standby"
2005-10-20T09:24:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	that's changing s3 -> s1
2005-10-20T09:24:00.000Z	orangey		other than that, you're really going to spend lots and lots of time, and it may not fully work anyway.. For example, I spent weeks on my s3, and in the end, there was no way to get the sound driver to reinitialize no matter what, so I had to drop back to s1 anyhow
2005-10-20T09:24:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	good for my knowledge. bad for my time : )
2005-10-20T09:25:00.000Z	TheCan	orangey	i could try measuring it with putting the battery out and trying to use my power measure tool i got here
2005-10-20T09:27:00.000Z	orangey		hmmmm. any advice on that dbus/hal issue? my fstab isn't updating when a device is detected..
2005-10-20T09:27:00.000Z	orangey		(in breezy)
2005-10-20T09:29:00.000Z	TheCan	orangey	doesnt seem to come back from S1 either :&/
2005-10-20T09:30:00.000Z	orangey	TheCan	doh!
