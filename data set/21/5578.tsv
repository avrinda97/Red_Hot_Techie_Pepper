2007-09-25T13:33:00.000Z	HealthyElijah		how do i get the icon back?
2007-09-25T13:34:00.000Z	up365	HealthyElijah	I suggest deluge, much better than bittorrent or bittornado
2007-09-25T13:35:00.000Z	HealthyElijah	up365	I have never used any of them before, let me just see what it is all about
2007-09-25T13:35:00.000Z	HealthyElijah		i found that in edit menus bittorrent got unslected somehow
2007-09-25T13:37:00.000Z	up365	HealthyElijah	ok I'm new to torrents myself been thru the "bits", transmission, and have landed on Deluge
