2008-07-11T08:56:00.000Z	enmasse		hey can anyone help me with themes for gnome/emerald
2008-07-11T08:57:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	yeah, what's up?
2008-07-11T08:57:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	hey i downloaded this theme http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/gommapiuma+looks+(gummina+mod)?content=69913
2008-07-11T08:57:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	you have to make sure you set up gnome to do it too
2008-07-11T08:58:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	 how do i do that?
2008-07-11T08:58:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	oh wait... I see.  With Emerald, it just sets the windows... you have to run the emerald manager program and then ensure that the package is installed
2008-07-11T08:58:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	again how do i do that >.<
2008-07-11T09:00:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	any chance you could upgrade the ram? ^_^
2008-07-11T09:00:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	lol
2008-07-11T09:01:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	oh that blows.
2008-07-11T09:07:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	hey
2008-07-11T09:07:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	yeah?
2008-07-11T09:07:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	okay i found emerland theme manager thing and added the theme there and logged and logged back in and still the same thing...
2008-07-11T09:07:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	um... hmph... lemme think... it took a few tries for me to get it right.
2008-07-11T09:10:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	okay, you've dragged the folder into the emerald themer and it's there. You've selected it and quit out of the themer, then reloaded X and it's still bad?
2008-07-11T09:12:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	what i did was download the theme, right click, change desktop, install the theme THEN drag the theme into emerland themer and quit out the themer
2008-07-11T09:14:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	so let me get this right, drag theme into themer select it and close themer and everything should change?
2008-07-11T09:14:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	or do i have to also do it by right clicking?
2008-07-11T09:15:00.000Z	merula	enmasse	you should only have to right-click once, which you did... so just drag it over, select it, and then quit, then restart X by using Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2008-07-11T09:16:00.000Z	enmasse	merula	okay still no luck....
