2005-05-21T16:55:00.000Z	goofrider		LMAO
2005-05-21T16:55:00.000Z	goofrider		oh...
2005-05-21T16:56:00.000Z	goofrider		i don't think that's a good idea. the better thing to do is have kdm/gdm autologin for u
2005-05-21T16:57:00.000Z	goofrider		but it's still a bad idea
2005-05-21T16:57:00.000Z	goofrider		well, of course u didn't have a "session" option.. u use xdm not kdm/gdm
2005-05-21T16:57:00.000Z	goofrider		try installing kdm/gdm
2005-05-21T16:57:00.000Z	goofrider		which wil give u autologin
2005-05-21T16:58:00.000Z	goofrider		your desktop environment is independent of kdm/gdm
2005-05-21T16:59:00.000Z	goofrider		yes
2005-05-21T16:59:00.000Z	goofrider		and gives u a graphical login screen
