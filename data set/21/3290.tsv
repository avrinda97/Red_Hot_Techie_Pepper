2009-02-08T12:55:00.000Z	ZiRiS		So we have no Video gurus present this evening? I was hoping for some suggestions to get back into 8.10
2009-02-08T12:56:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	what's your vid card? if it's ATI there are FGLRX setups which can regenerate your xorg conf.. if it's something else I can google for you other potential install scripts
2009-02-08T12:57:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	the other option is to use a LiveCD, and then copy over the Xorg.conf stuff that it generates in the virtual filesystem over to your real implementation
2009-02-08T12:58:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	nVidia 8600GT  8.10 boots to a command line, X fails directly after rebooting from installing the recommended drivers on a fresh install, all I did was the updates, rebooted, added the vid driver and rebooted, and got a command line.
2009-02-08T12:59:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	I'm starting to think I never want to update again >.< getting very sick of updates breaking my great setup
2009-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	looking into it
2009-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	tyvm!
2009-02-08T13:05:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	first off, try Recovery Mode from GRUB boot loader if you have that option - you can uninstall your restricted drivers and reboot hopefully into normal Ubuntu with X working
2009-02-08T13:06:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	with a LiveCD, are you using LVM or mdadm for raid? if so you will need extra instructions to mount your existing partitions
2009-02-08T13:06:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	I did. That was one of the first things I tried. It didn't do any good, actually matters got worse and I reinstalled. Same thing happened again. I'm not looking forward to another reinstall.
2009-02-08T13:08:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	I have ubuntu installed on an IDE drive, but have 2 other SATA drives that are NOT in a raid configuration. One is windows, the other is misc storage. movies and such.
2009-02-08T13:09:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	I would expect the LiveCD to autodetect and mount those partitions then - I'm still looking for a good guide that details exactly what files to copy over to repair your X configuration
2009-02-08T13:13:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	have you read http://www.robdian.co.uk/content/view/56/27/ ? it mentions your cart specifically - it's all command line which might be a useful last ditch effort
2009-02-08T13:14:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	I haven't but will right now. Thx. :D
2009-02-08T13:14:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	I think the only file you need to copy is the xorg.conf file, it should be located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf   -- copy this from your liveCD path (which is as written) to wherever your ubuntu partition is mounted
2009-02-08T13:15:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	I would assume any driver built into the LiveCD would be included in your installation
2009-02-08T13:16:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	thx! wilco!
2009-02-08T13:17:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	I hope it helps :-( dealing with broken X is _the #1 most frustrating thing_ for new Linux users IMO
2009-02-08T13:18:00.000Z	ZiRiS	freazer	Indeed, I'm sure it is. If this doesn't work, I might just DL, burn and install Kubuntu.
2009-02-08T13:20:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	from command line (if broken X won't let you access terminal, try Ctrl-Alt-F1 or F2 to get to another terminal command line - and simply login and type sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop as another user said above - it will change your default login stuff to KDE (which may be worth trying)
2009-02-08T13:20:00.000Z	freazer	ZiRiS	but, from what I've seen Kubuntu is a very different experience, and you're right in that it could be worth trying
