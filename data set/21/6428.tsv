2007-04-09T05:46:00.000Z	velko	tuor	you don't find run.exe or install.exe? and is your .exe file really located in /home/tuor? i gave this path as example. i cannot know where your file is located
2007-04-09T05:48:00.000Z	tuor	velko	I don't find run.exe and my file install.exe really located in /home/tuor. I install it with graphical interface
2007-04-09T05:50:00.000Z	velko	tuor	you should know how your file is named. i replied to this one (where run.exe and install.exe are mixed) "velko, I was run wine /home/tuor/install.exe, but i dont find run.exe"
2007-04-09T05:50:00.000Z	velko	tuor	wine /home/tuor/install.exe
