2007-10-24T18:23:00.000Z	ben--		I've just used the Ubuntu 7 ISO to burn an installation CD...
2007-10-24T18:23:00.000Z	ben--		I boot using that CD, the Ubuntu menu with a lot of options pops up
2007-10-24T18:23:00.000Z	ben--		I've tried running the "Install Ubuntu" option
2007-10-24T18:24:00.000Z	ben--		it says I/O Error
2007-10-24T18:24:00.000Z	ben--		and reboots.
2007-10-24T18:24:00.000Z	ben--		tokukitty: cause wubi does not partition
2007-10-24T18:24:00.000Z	ben--		which sucks.
2007-10-24T18:26:00.000Z	ben--		may I ask what's the diffrance between Ubuntu CD and Ubuntu LiveCD?
2007-10-24T18:27:00.000Z	ben--		is LiveCD like Knoppix? no installation, just runs off the CD?
2007-10-24T18:27:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	yes
2007-10-24T18:28:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	bad burn?
2007-10-24T18:29:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	the MD5 of your ISO?
2007-10-24T18:29:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	other ways of installing besides a CD
2007-10-24T18:29:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	theres more to it than Wubi
2007-10-24T18:30:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	what speed were you burning at?
2007-10-24T18:31:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	yeah, probably try either another burn or other installation options
2007-10-24T18:32:00.000Z	ben--	scguy318	is there some sort of installation method which would let me keep my Vista and install Ubuntu without me having to manually touch the boot loader?
2007-10-24T18:32:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	the LiveCD
2007-10-24T18:32:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	the installer does your boot loader for you
2007-10-24T18:33:00.000Z	scguy318	ben--	consider other options of booting, like USB, etc.
