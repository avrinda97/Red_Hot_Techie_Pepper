2010-03-10T16:24:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	it's totally possible they're using a transparent proxy (one that doesn't tell servers where it's forwarding the content on to). In that case whatsmyip wouldn't be able to tell your real IP. I've got to say though, it's pretty rare because it does have the tendency to confuse and annoy users
2010-03-10T16:25:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	Ah. Yes. Blimey... They could be proxying your traffic several times over to make sure you're not looking at something "illegal"
2010-03-10T16:28:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	I can connect on port 2222 but nothing happens when I'm connected
2010-03-10T16:29:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	right, *exactly*!!
2010-03-10T16:29:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	you're sure you're forwarding correctly?
2010-03-10T16:30:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	positive. and I tried two different routers, and on many ports.. even with telnet + netcat -l
2010-03-10T16:30:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	I don't think no-ip/dyndns is going to help at all. Your address is fine and that's all they deal with.
2010-03-10T16:31:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	have you tried a higher port like 39713 (just a random example)
2010-03-10T16:31:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	not that high, but i did try 8080
2010-03-10T16:32:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	try a bit higher then and let me know the port... Some ISPs do block incoming connections on lower known service ports to stop people hosting things
2010-03-10T16:33:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	if you have a minute, try this:      telnet 118.198.214.191 8080                    I just ran " netcat -l -p 8080 "
2010-03-10T16:33:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	i got your "HELO", but then you got disconnected, right?
2010-03-10T16:34:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	I disconnected but yes, I wrote HELO
2010-03-10T16:34:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	right, any incoming connection gets disconnected after the first line, so SSH never has a chance; it gets owned right away
2010-03-10T16:34:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	i really think it's my ISP
2010-03-10T16:36:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	if you have (or get) another server you *could* ssh to it from your box there, tunnelling a port back to your computer (over the SSH connection) and then connect through the external machine... It's a bit of a faff but it wouldn't be too expensive to hire a shell on another machine
2010-03-10T16:37:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	it's actually how I connect to my home server. Rather than having incoming connections here, I use my webserver to proxy any connections
2010-03-10T16:38:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	Reverse tunnel? That's how I do it right now........ :(
2010-03-10T16:38:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	you mean ssh -N -R2222:localhost:22 localhost, right?
2010-03-10T16:38:00.000Z	Oli``	ruien	something like that, yeah
2010-03-10T16:40:00.000Z	ruien	Oli``	yep, that's what I'm doing to my webserver. I thought the problem was my crappy router, so I used that as a workaround. Then, i bought a new router. Same problem. Thx though :)!
