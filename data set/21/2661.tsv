2012-08-08T00:57:00.000Z	j`ey		hey guys. I added a new session to my "Login Screen" options
2012-08-08T00:57:00.000Z	j`ey		(via a new file in /usr/share/xsessions)
2012-08-08T00:57:00.000Z	j`ey		but it doesn't show up in gdm :/
2012-08-08T00:57:00.000Z	j`ey		(event after a gdm restart)
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	trism	j`ey	can you pastebin the .desktop file?
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	im not at that computer currently, but I just took the gnome one, and changed the exec path to dwm
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	trism	j`ey	did you change the name too?
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	yep
2012-08-08T01:00:00.000Z	trism	j`ey	you didn't copy the "Hidden=true" one did you?
2012-08-08T01:00:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	hm, i dont think so
2012-08-08T01:00:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	not currently on the machine in question
2012-08-08T01:00:00.000Z	trism	j`ey	because here, gnome.desktop has that line
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	oh..
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	I hope I didnt :P
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	oh, you may be talking about 12.04?
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	j`ey		im on 10.04
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	trism	j`ey	those are my only ideas that this point, without actually looking at the file
2012-08-08T01:02:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	ok, thanks, I'll double check tomorrow
2012-08-08T01:02:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	i might just resort to bypassing gdm, and starting a new xserver
2012-08-08T01:02:00.000Z	trism	j`ey	I don't see why it wouldn't work, I always create a ratpoison.desktop file
2012-08-08T01:03:00.000Z	j`ey	trism	like I said, shows up in the login screen settings, so I dont know why not in gdm :)
