2008-10-19T00:32:00.000Z	pyro		If I wanted to stream HDTV to my computer how would I do it?
2008-10-19T00:33:00.000Z	pyro		is there some sort of hdtv capture card?
2008-10-19T00:33:00.000Z	joran	pyro	there's a couple, but they are seriously expensive unless you are talking DVB
2008-10-19T00:34:00.000Z	pyro	joran	i have no idea what that means, I just want to learn how to turn my computer into a tivo like device so I figured the place to start is figure out how to stream a hdtv signal to it
2008-10-19T00:35:00.000Z	pyro	joran	DVB i'm assuming is the 5-6 pin coax connection right?
2008-10-19T00:35:00.000Z	joran	pyro	you need a hd tuner card, DVB-S2 for satellite
2008-10-19T00:36:00.000Z	pyro	joran	it's verizon fios so just a regular HD tuner card?
2008-10-19T00:36:00.000Z	joran	pyro	you'll never get one that's dvi or hdmi in, without spending thousands of Â£/$
2008-10-19T00:36:00.000Z	pyro	joran	really?  why not?
2008-10-19T00:36:00.000Z	joran	pyro	too much data for pci to handle
2008-10-19T00:36:00.000Z	pyro	joran	hmm
2008-10-19T00:36:00.000Z	pyro	joran	surely not pci-x though
2008-10-19T00:37:00.000Z	joran	pyro	seriously expensive... you want to get the MPEG stream not the raw hd stream
2008-10-19T00:38:00.000Z	pyro	joran	wait you're talking about on the fly compression now arn't you?  why can't I stream it raw then compress?
2008-10-19T00:38:00.000Z	pyro	joran	like http://www.amazon.com/Blackmagic-Design-Intensity-Editing-Express/dp/B001CN9GEA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1224358651&sr=8-1
2008-10-19T00:38:00.000Z	pyro	joran	would I be able to capture a raw stream with that then compress l8r?
2008-10-19T00:38:00.000Z	joran	pyro	raw hd stream cards need so much horsepower to just compress it into a data stream that's usable, it's not consumer-priced
2008-10-19T00:38:00.000Z	pyro	joran	or am I going about this the wrong way
2008-10-19T00:39:00.000Z	pyro		hmm
2008-10-19T00:39:00.000Z	joran	pyro	this channel's too fast for this discussion - jump on over to #LinuxTV, that's a better place to discuss this, more experts too :-)
2008-10-19T00:39:00.000Z	pyro	joran	sure thanks
