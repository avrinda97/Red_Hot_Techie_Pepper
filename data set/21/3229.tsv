2009-04-08T04:50:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	that sucks, okay, thanks anyways

2009-04-08T04:51:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	no
2009-04-08T04:52:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	its all good, it was just a screensaver file. If I like the look of the other colors, ill go find the one i deleted again, thanks
2009-06-19T00:28:00.000Z	jrib	stealth-	do they even make processors that aren't 64bit anymore?
2009-06-19T00:28:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	I think so, i've seen alot of amd64's in the wal-mart close to my home
2010-04-06T04:23:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	thanks
2010-10-21T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	stealth-	tell him to run it and see what happens
2010-10-21T05:32:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	Can't. It's over the phone and I really want to just get it right the first time before I call him up, lol >.>
2010-10-21T05:33:00.000Z	jrib	stealth-	I think there's some option at install, in any case just tell him to enable it in the gui, if it's already checked, no big deal
2010-10-21T05:33:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	Ah, k.
2010-10-21T05:33:00.000Z	stealth-	jrib	Thanks.
