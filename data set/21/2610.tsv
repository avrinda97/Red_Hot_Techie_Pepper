2010-05-11T14:02:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	is more support left on hardy , than there is on 9.10 ?
2010-05-11T14:02:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	I mean, I thought hardy had one year left?
2010-05-11T14:04:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	So it's not really 'unsupported' ?
2010-05-11T14:04:00.000Z	swapy	Name141	use ubuntu 10.04 it has long term support ie of 3 yrs
2010-05-11T14:04:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	my lucid disk hasn't got here yet
2010-05-11T14:05:00.000Z	swapy	Name141	you can download image and burn it to a cd
2010-05-11T14:05:00.000Z	swapy	Name141	else download and boot via usb and install
2010-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	I don't have any CD's and the computer that will be use only has a CD-RW drive
2010-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	It's an older computer, so I doubt it'd boot off of a USB
2010-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	swapy	Name141	so u have cd writer right? then you can burn iso file easily on a blank disc
2010-05-11T14:08:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	I don't have any CDs

2010-05-11T14:09:00.000Z	swapy	Name141	so its a combo drive it will write cd read cd/dvd and it only cannot write dvd
2010-05-11T14:10:00.000Z	swapy	Name141	so wait for a cd
2010-05-11T14:10:00.000Z	Name141	swapy	Correct
