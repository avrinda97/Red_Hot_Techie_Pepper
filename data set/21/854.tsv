2012-01-01T00:09:00.000Z	DrPenguin		its just slow, id put it slightly better than Firefox. go with chromium
2012-01-01T00:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	chromium is fine on small monitors , just don't try it on a large monitor from 10ft/3M away...the fonts on the tabs are too small to read for starters
2012-01-01T00:11:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	you can adjust that
2012-01-01T00:11:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	not that that even matters, that isnt related to this conversation
2012-01-01T00:12:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	how? ..it may be related , depending on his monitor ...an observation to keep in mind
2012-01-01T00:12:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	because hes asking if theres a safari counterpart for ubuntu. Hes not asking whats a good browser to use on a huge monitor from a distance
2012-01-01T00:50:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	its probably the post-install script
2012-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	he's at the tty
2012-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	hey can still pastebin it
2012-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	I believe su defaults to root if you dont give it a user name
2012-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	he restarted gdm
2012-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	if hes able to restart gdm hes not using lightdm
2012-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	ohadios , nope I've seen that before , the dm is running without X  ...yes it's true
2012-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	Thats not what doesnt make sense. if X didnt come up with restarting gdm, then it shouldnt come up with startx
2012-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	rightâ€¦ but its not correct. Whats effectively happened here is that X came up using 2 different configurations, but it should of used the same for both
2012-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	he could black list nouveau in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
2012-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	right.. but im telling him to delete nouveau
2012-01-02T01:17:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	you may consider running linux as a geek exercise , but you're left behind in the dust now , if you think that
2012-01-02T01:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	 you too now? Seriously, I am not gonna be chastised because I dont "baby" people
2012-01-02T01:19:00.000Z	DrPenguin	BluesKaj	doesnt mean people should be "babied" and hand held
2012-01-02T01:19:00.000Z	BluesKaj	DrPenguin	I never said that
