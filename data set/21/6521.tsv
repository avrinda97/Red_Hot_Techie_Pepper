2007-03-18T13:53:00.000Z	Oswy		Hey, my boot disk isn't working.
2007-03-18T13:53:00.000Z	Oswy		I downloaded the .iso this morning.
2007-03-18T13:53:00.000Z	Oswy		I mean, it works to a point.
2007-03-18T13:53:00.000Z	Oswy		I get the bootup screen.
2007-03-18T13:53:00.000Z	Oswy		Then that finishes and it just goes blank, and my kb stops working.
2007-03-18T13:54:00.000Z	Oswy		I'm not at all good with Linux; I may need step-by-step instructions/definitions.
2007-03-18T13:54:00.000Z	Oswy		I mean, no input or output.
2007-03-18T13:54:00.000Z	Oswy		I can't toggle NumLock.
2007-03-18T13:55:00.000Z	Oswy		I've tried both regular and safe graphics; same problem.
2007-03-18T13:56:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	ok, I want you to use an extra flag on the boot menu (the very first one)
2007-03-18T13:57:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	noapci
2007-03-18T14:01:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	try adding on noacpi
2007-03-18T14:09:00.000Z	Oswy	ravi	or anyone else, any other ideas?
2007-03-18T14:11:00.000Z	Oswy	ravi	noacpi didn't work.
2007-03-18T14:14:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	did you try going to the terminals?
2007-03-18T15:05:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	network install for Ubuntu is archaic, they really need to grow up the network install part of ubuntu
2007-03-18T15:09:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	I wish I could just mail you your computer with Ubuntu beautifully installed :(
2007-03-19T16:33:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	if you mean install.exe?
2007-03-19T16:33:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	that's really not recommended
2007-03-19T16:33:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	at least from me.
2007-03-19T16:34:00.000Z	ravi	Oswy	you can just do that windows install for now I guess
