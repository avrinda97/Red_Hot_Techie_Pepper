2011-04-24T14:02:00.000Z	kaatta		need something that will do basic internet + compatible with IDLE
2011-04-24T14:03:00.000Z	kaatta		python programming environment, i know ubuntu has it in software center. basically makes writting code easier for beginners like me
2011-04-24T14:04:00.000Z	kaatta		thanks, i have heard about LXDE but never tried it
2011-04-24T14:06:00.000Z	kaatta		i read something about the new ubuntu using something different then gnome, i downloaded beta but it wouldnt boot @ all for me :'9
2011-04-24T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 'unity'
2011-04-24T14:06:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	yea that, but it wouldnt boot so i didnt get to check it out on my primary machine
2011-04-24T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 luibuntu will have all the stuff in ubuntu -  just not isntalled by default
2011-04-24T14:12:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	thank you, sounds pretty much what i have been searching for (i have at least 12 .isos ive been trying out lol)
2011-04-24T14:18:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	do you know of anyway i can scan my HDD for the bad sectors, partition around them and then use the SSD at a smaller capacity?
2011-04-24T14:24:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	, html_inprogress , i can attest that using ubuntu on 800x480 is a headache
2011-04-24T14:28:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	the alternate cd has more seeders... but im a little intimidated about trying to use an alt install. is it difficult?
2011-04-24T14:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 just use tab and enter to move about..  not much harder at all.
2011-04-24T14:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 this is the lubuntu cd you are talking about?
2011-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	was talking about lubuntu alternate.iso... i prefer to torrent when DLing a distro, the reg iso had 1 seeder, the alt had 7...
2011-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 i imagine the direct download wouldbe faster. :)
2011-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 i think lubuntu is smaller then a full cd also.
2011-04-24T14:33:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	lubuntu = 550mb-ish, 3 hour direct DL estimate
2011-04-24T14:33:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	my net @ work SUCKS, so i prolly wanna start it now, and finish it @ home on my 18mbps net
2011-04-24T14:40:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	lubuntu does?
2011-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaatta	 you can always isntall lubuntu-desktop package on a normal install :)
2011-04-24T14:42:00.000Z	kaatta	Dr_Willis	i remember trying to do that with KDE once, it was a nightmare
