2006-02-24T17:58:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha		would that be the apt-get upgrade command someone told me not to do one day?
2006-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha		lol
2006-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha		why at boot screen do i have three different choices for Ubuntu.. really 6 but thats including safemode
2006-02-24T06:06:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- they are specific versions of the distro, dependant on processor architecture, etc...
2006-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- There would have been at least 2 to begin with.  I bet you have an AMD processor, because that is what the -K7 is for...
2006-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- LEAVE THEM!!!
2006-02-24T06:08:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	ok i was just wondering if i added them somehow from installing different drivers...
2006-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	i just get confused on what one i should boot.. i randomly pick them now
2006-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- The -386 is the base architecture for most modern processors.  The safe mode is obvious, and the -K7 would be there if you had an AMD processor.  Do you have an AMD processor?
2006-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	yes
2006-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- What model?
2006-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	Athlon XP i think it was called
2006-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	 1500+
2006-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- That is the earliest version of the AXP, but the -K7 version in your booter would have software optimized for that specific subset of architecture...
2006-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	AXP?  Did i somehow put that -K7 version there?
2006-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- AXP is short for Athlon XP, and you might have done a kernel upgrade...
2006-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	i think i did... so is there a better preference for me.. k7 or 386?
2006-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	-  I just said, K7 is optimized for your processor, so that would make it the better choice...
2006-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	yeah but having the earliest version threw me off thinking it wouldwork but have bugs since its older
2006-02-24T06:17:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	djs_2_6	thanks for the info :)
2006-02-24T06:17:00.000Z	djs_2_6	OmegaAlpha	- You are welcome
