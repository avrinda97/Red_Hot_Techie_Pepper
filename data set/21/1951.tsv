2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	plum		hey guys
2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	plum		does the upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 automatically restart the computer?
2010-10-13T12:19:00.000Z	plum		ah sweet, thanks ActionParsnip
2010-10-13T12:20:00.000Z	plum		i've got some partitions i'm moving around and growing/shrinking with gparted. don't want them to die in the middle of it
2010-10-13T12:21:00.000Z	plum		they aren't very recent, :(  but i don't really have much to lose on these partitions. just don't want them to become un-recoverable
2010-10-13T12:22:00.000Z	plum		btw... i have two linux-swap partitions on my /dev/sdb, should i delete one or both of them?
2010-10-13T12:24:00.000Z	plum		ahh gotcha
2010-10-13T12:26:00.000Z	lyte	plum	"swapon -s"
2010-10-13T12:26:00.000Z	plum	lyte	that'll show which /dev/sdb is in use?
2010-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	plum		(i unmounted them both to move them around, i can't access now to check)
2010-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	lyte	plum	yep, pretty sure you can have two at once though so i think it'll just show both
2010-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	plum		ah
2010-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	plum		so i should just leave them?
2010-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	lyte	plum	you can always "swapoff /dev/whatever"
2010-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	lyte	plum	dunno, i actually only have a couple of machines that even have a swap partition...
2010-10-13T12:28:00.000Z	plum	lyte	one of them i'm pretty sure was left over, i had some trouble getting ubuntu installed once & reinstalled
2010-10-13T12:28:00.000Z	plum		so i think the one from that installation is still there
2010-10-13T12:29:00.000Z	lyte	plum	yeh well "swapon -s" shows active swap parititions, "free" shows memory/swap usage. You have to decide based on your usage patterns what's good
2010-10-13T12:29:00.000Z	lyte	plum	i doubt it will hurt having two, i doubt you can _badly_ break it by removing one (as long as you "swapoff" first)
2010-10-13T12:30:00.000Z	plum	lyte	i'll check next reboot to see which one is active then. thanks for the swapon -s command :)
2010-10-13T12:31:00.000Z	lyte	plum	no worries.
