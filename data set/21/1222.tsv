2011-01-28T04:32:00.000Z	Jorky		Hello guys. I've got problems with my microSd card. Ubuntu recognize it normaly but drive doesn't have write support. How can I format it to fat and add write support? Please help!
2011-01-28T04:32:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	does the microSD adaptor have the write tab to the lock position? Also, check out the disk utility for formatting
2011-01-28T04:33:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	No. Write tab isn't on lock position. How can I do it vith gparted?
2011-01-28T04:34:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2011-01-28T04:34:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	10.10
2011-01-28T04:34:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	goto system, adminstration, disk utility - that will be how you format
2011-01-28T04:36:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	I see now that drive is alredy in fat 16, so how can I add write support now?
2011-01-28T04:37:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	what size is the card?
2011-01-28T04:37:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	2GB
2011-01-28T04:37:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	Ubuntu only
2011-01-28T04:41:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	Are you still here?
2011-01-28T04:41:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	still here
2011-01-28T04:42:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	So what should I do?
2011-01-28T04:42:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	I would reformat as Ext 3 or 4, since you are only using it in ubuntu
2011-01-28T04:43:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	yes but than I don't know if my phone will recognize it
2011-01-28T04:44:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	Ah, what phone do you have? thought you were only using in ubuntu
2011-01-28T04:45:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	LG t329
2011-01-28T04:45:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	the best way to do that, if you need it to work in your phone, is to format it *from* your phone - then try it in ubuntu.
2011-01-28T04:45:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	LG T310
2011-01-28T04:46:00.000Z	Jorky	badger32d	I was doing even that but still won't works
2011-01-28T04:47:00.000Z	badger32d	Jorky	well try to just format it as FAT then in ubuntu, and see if it works in both
