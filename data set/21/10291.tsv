2005-06-24T16:48:00.000Z	catfox		hi all. any ideas why a kernel wont boot with no error output at all?
2005-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	Too little information to suggest anything.
2005-06-24T16:51:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	thats all i have :) i tried to build a custom kernel, but when i boot it, i get past grub then nothing
2005-06-24T16:58:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	trying to install your own kernel?
2005-06-24T16:59:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	i am, aye
2005-06-24T05:00:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	any ideas on that error?
2005-06-24T05:02:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	yes, I've seen it quite often, long long time ago when I first tried devfs.
2005-06-24T05:03:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	i was thinking it might be something to do with ide support in the kernel
2005-06-24T05:03:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	i don't have devfs in there
2005-06-24T05:15:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	its in the submenu in filesystems, the same place where you can enable devfs.
2005-06-24T05:15:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	yeah in pseudo filesystems. but it's not in the list
2005-06-24T05:16:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	 it's not showing up, which i think means it depends on something else which isn't enabled?
2005-06-24T05:21:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	look for Virtual Memory File System (former shmfs)
2005-06-24T05:24:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	not there either. i'm gonna restart the whole config process.
2005-06-24T05:24:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	which kernel version are you trying to install?
2005-06-24T05:26:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	Virtual memory file system in Pseudo File Systems in File systems.
2005-06-24T05:26:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	yeah, i've looked up in the .config file where they are, but they're not showing up in a make xconfig
2005-06-24T05:27:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	:) just starting out really. went for a job as linux tech support, but got a job as a developer
2005-06-24T05:27:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	ditch xconfig, use menuconfig.
2005-06-24T05:35:00.000Z	catfox	Fikrann	thanks for the help before, i think i'm almost there now :)
2005-06-24T05:35:00.000Z	Fikrann	catfox	You're welcome. }:>
