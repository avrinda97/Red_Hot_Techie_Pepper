2008-07-04T10:12:00.000Z	shoeunited		Hi there.  Which way to the 64bit version of Hardy for help?
2008-07-04T10:13:00.000Z	shoeunited		Oh, great.
2008-07-04T10:14:00.000Z	shoeunited		Simply stated:  I'm having trouble turning on my bluetooth.  How do I see if it's being detected?
2008-07-04T10:15:00.000Z	shoeunited		My laptop to my phone (data transfer)
2008-07-04T10:15:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	shoeunited	try dmesg | grep bluetooth
2008-07-04T10:15:00.000Z	shoeunited		Ok Utalcn2me
2008-07-04T10:15:00.000Z	shoeunited		Nada :/
2008-07-04T10:16:00.000Z	shoeunited		dmesg isn't spitting back any bluetooth IDs to me.
2008-07-04T10:16:00.000Z	shoeunited		Is it a driver issue between 32bit and 64 bit?
2008-07-04T10:17:00.000Z	shoeunited		Alright.  I was seeing some flashplayer issues, so I didn't know if it was affecting hardware as well.
2008-07-04T10:18:00.000Z	shoeunited		K
2008-07-04T10:19:00.000Z	shoeunited		Bluetooth management is enabled.
2008-07-04T10:19:00.000Z	shoeunited		It's built in.  I can grab the specs and put them on pastebin.  It's an acer aspire 4520 notebook though.
2008-07-04T10:20:00.000Z	shoeunited		alright
2008-07-04T10:20:00.000Z	shoeunited		Alright, just a moment. :)

2008-07-04T10:23:00.000Z	shoeunited		Well, I appreciate the try. :)  But I know it has bluetooth cause the documentation says it's onboard and I got a button.  lol
2008-07-04T10:23:00.000Z	shoeunited		I did.  They all turn up red.
2008-07-04T10:24:00.000Z	shoeunited		Er.
2008-07-04T10:24:00.000Z	shoeunited		To say, none of them worked :/
2008-07-04T10:24:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	shoeunited	it might be something silly like having it turned on at bootup, although i doubt it.
