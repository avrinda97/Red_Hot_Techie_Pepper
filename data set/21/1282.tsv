2011-11-26T07:45:00.000Z	jdtm		Hello, I am having some Wifi stability issues. On Ubuntu 11.10. I am using an HWUG1 wireless Usb adapter, connecting to a TL-WR541G wireless router. I am experiencing a packet loss of about 5%, Which is annoying in some online games. I also dual boot win 7, and it works perfectly fine there. Here is my iwconfig, if it helps: http://paste.ubuntu.com/749900/. Any help is appreciated.
2011-11-26T07:46:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	even in windows it is suggested to game and stream meadia using a wired connection
2011-11-26T07:48:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	did you have to do any specail installation of drivers for your wifi?
2011-11-26T07:49:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	as far as intalling it in ubuntu that is?
2011-11-26T07:50:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	linux and windows use very different drivers... sometimes the drivers in linux are sub-par to the drivers in windows
2011-11-26T07:52:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	What you might be experiencing is Ubuntu being more sensitive to flucuations in the wireless signal than windows
2011-11-26T07:54:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	not unless your very skilled at writting your own device drivers
2011-11-26T07:55:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	As i mentioned earlier... anytime I try to stream video or play an online game i always use a hard connection to avoid problems with signal
2011-11-26T07:56:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	someone walking through the room is enough to distrupt your wireless signal
2011-11-26T07:56:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	I really strongly suggest when gaming to use ethernet, not wireless... nothing sucks more than a roommate (or parent) using the microwave causing you to get fragged in your favorite game
2011-11-26T07:57:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	the signal meter is all code based... It's easy enough to fake that
2011-11-26T08:03:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	np... sometimes a good ol' fashioned search on google with your wireless driver and ubuntu might turn up some results too
2011-11-26T08:05:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	the keywords your looking for "high latency"
2011-11-26T08:06:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	first hit I got was this http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1794949.html <= have you seen that and tried any of the suggestions there?
2011-11-26T08:09:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	do you use wireless encryption on your network?
2011-11-26T08:10:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	Hrm... that might be the problem (not that an encrypted network is a bad thing, it's very good!) but I have always had bad luck with wifi, linux and encrypted networks
2011-11-26T08:12:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	If you can... I'd try going a bit with the encryption off (lock down the AP to only allow your MAC address) and see if the problem goes away... something to mind is the encryption is often done on the wireless cards chip and it's not nearly as powerful as your CPU
2011-11-26T08:15:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	sorry, missed that
2011-11-26T08:17:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	I'm sure you will find a solution... I'm just out of ideas here... I use broadcom b43legacy... my biggest issue was WPA encryption... so I turned off all encryption and use a local VPN connection from my laptop to one of my desktops and tunnel everything through that
2011-11-26T08:17:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	* encrypted VPN *
2011-11-26T08:23:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	jdtm	I know the frustration... you have a good chipset with that wifi adapter, broadcom is a lot worse
