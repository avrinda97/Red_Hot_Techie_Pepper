2010-10-01T02:25:00.000Z	Rohanc		is ubuntu 10.04 x64 unstable?
2010-10-01T02:26:00.000Z	Rohanc		I'm getting black screens pretty often with 10.04 x64
2010-10-01T02:27:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	i don't get that black anymore even i am benchmarking
2010-10-01T02:28:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	what I meant black screen is I can't get my display to show but the process is still running
2010-10-01T02:29:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	i know what you are saying
2010-10-01T02:29:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	it's a 3d effect
2010-10-01T02:29:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	actually I've installed ubuntu after windows 7 using wubi installer
2010-10-01T02:30:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	so do u have any suggestions for me?
2010-10-01T02:30:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	no
2010-10-01T02:30:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	i don't use wubi
2010-10-01T02:31:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	but I can't even google search, what's problem exactly called? if I search for black screen, it shows me results of total black screen while installing ubuntu
2010-10-01T02:31:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	you can try to install it onto a cheap usbkey like me
2010-10-01T02:32:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	ok, how do I accomplish that? can I do it with windows 7?
2010-10-01T02:33:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	burn a iso with windows then boot it off then install onto the usbkey
2010-10-01T02:34:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	by this way, you can remove ubuntu completely in any time
2010-10-01T02:34:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	u mean burn an iso into a cd and then boot it off and install on usb?
2010-10-01T02:35:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	sorry, I couldn't get what did u say
2010-10-01T02:35:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	just a suggestion
2010-10-01T02:35:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	ok, how did u avoid black screens?
2010-10-01T02:37:00.000Z	nogo	Rohanc	i don't really know. nothing can stop me every time. i am lucky
2010-10-01T02:38:00.000Z	Rohanc	nogo	wow u are really lucky with that.. I'm so frustrated with it now.. u know i'm just 1 day user of ubuntu, i'm loving it already.. it's fast and beautiful.. except for the fact that it gives me black screens now and then
