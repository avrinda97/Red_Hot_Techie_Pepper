2011-11-24T14:43:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	good stuff. are you doing a PhD in biology?
2011-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	wisuzu	dissipate	No , computer engineering  :D
2011-11-24T14:45:00.000Z	wisuzu	dissipate	the biology stuff i work came from a big hospital in my city
2011-11-24T14:45:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	awesome. you might be interested in a project i'm working on: electrosim.com. it's a browser based schematic capture and circuit simulator.
2011-11-24T14:46:00.000Z	wisuzu	dissipate	i'm cheking it
2011-11-24T14:46:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	it's currently alpha. it's best to load a test circuit then click 'simulate'
2011-11-24T14:47:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	after the 'results' tab goes from red to green you can plot your nodes.
2011-11-24T14:52:00.000Z	wisuzu	dissipate	great stuff! i can see a lot of work behind, it's your personal proyect?
2011-11-24T14:52:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	yes, and a friend of mine. we are partners in crime. :)
2011-11-24T14:53:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	are you familiar with any of the test circuits like the amplifier? :)
2011-11-24T14:54:00.000Z	wisuzu	dissipate	Aummm, they are not chinese for me but ... i study fisics/electronics at this level ages ago
2011-11-24T14:55:00.000Z	dissipate	wisuzu	yeah, i bet  you do more digital.
