2005-12-05T09:59:00.000Z	stevenj		Why does'nt anyone know the answer to this??? How do I resolve in breezy these xsession errors "** (gnome-session:8178): WARNING **: Host name lookup failure on localhost." or "_IceTransTransNoListen: unable to find transport: tcp"  ???????/
2005-12-05T09:59:00.000Z	stevenj		Is this a bug in BReezy??
2005-12-05T10:00:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	what program is that in?
2005-12-05T10:00:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	it appears in my .xsession on a "new breezy" install right after I log in
2005-12-05T10:01:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	so...you can not log in?
2005-12-05T10:01:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	if I can msg you, I will give you the entire xsession
2005-12-05T10:02:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	yes I can log in, but I just want to know why....and is everyone else getting this
2005-12-05T10:03:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	just to make clear, this causes you no problem?
2005-12-05T10:04:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	I am guess is not...but how can I be sure..I am new to linux...and I just want to know what errors mean
2005-12-05T10:05:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	I do not use BP and I only use default repos for apps...
2005-12-05T10:05:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	it means what it says. dunno what it would mean to the system. If it causes nno problems, likely there is a logical explanation for it.
2005-12-05T10:06:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	I guess my question then is...do the majority of breezy users (that will check) can multiple instances of _IceTrans.....bla bla in the their ~/.xsession-errors????
2005-12-05T10:07:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	I dont answer polls, maybe someone else will.
2005-12-05T10:08:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	yes. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-12-05T10:08:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	not you.
2005-12-05T10:15:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	how do I find out for you?
2005-12-05T10:16:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	a good question would have been, run "blah" tell me whether you see line "blah", if you are so willing to learn about this new gnu/linux...
2005-12-05T10:17:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	well the problem is...that this exist on a "fresh newly installed, log in one time" breezy installation, without running anything. I have indeed tested that.
2005-12-05T10:17:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	well, tell me the command to find out, already:)
2005-12-05T10:18:00.000Z	dabaR	stevenj	I have a running ubuntu.
2005-12-05T10:19:00.000Z	stevenj	dabaR	oh just open your .xsession-errors (located in your home dir) * its hidden too :)
