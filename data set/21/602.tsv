2012-06-24T13:48:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 you are using gnunet-fuse ?
2012-06-24T13:48:00.000Z	wayne7		No
2012-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 you have tried to play with gnunet-dbg ?
2012-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	bobweaver		I think that there is also a gui for the debuger ^^
2012-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	yes I am using gnunetfuse It its installed okay but I don't know what it does.
2012-06-24T13:52:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	I'm not a developer and I don't know how to run the debug
2012-06-24T13:52:00.000Z	bobweaver		ahh
2012-06-24T13:53:00.000Z	bobweaver		let me try to start it up and run it
2012-06-24T13:53:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 ^^
2012-06-24T13:53:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	thanks . I have it running on aanother computer next to me if that helps.
2012-06-24T13:55:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 I just installed gnunet-gtk-dev and it is working great what are you tring to do on the network ?
2012-06-24T13:57:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 that set up everything for me nice and clean server and also clients and all that jazz not sure if that helps but good luck
2012-06-24T13:57:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	I'll b happy if I can get it to do anything. the tabs work but the search for exampel doesn't find any keyword at all.
2012-06-24T13:59:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 you have added stuff to your network ? meaning that you are using gnunet to host torrents not search for them correct ?
2012-06-24T14:01:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	Does gnunet download torrent files or other files. Whenever I download torrents, BitTorrent does it okay.
2012-06-24T14:05:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	No I haven't tried to publish anythign to gnunet. I can't find the network. I joined them by siigning up on the web.
2012-06-24T14:06:00.000Z	bobweaver	wayne7	 see PM
2012-06-24T14:07:00.000Z	wayne7	bobweaver	I don't know what you mean by PM
