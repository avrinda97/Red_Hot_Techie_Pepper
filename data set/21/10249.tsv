2005-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	daniels	ips	please don't ever recommend that
2005-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	ips	daniels	why?
2005-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	daniels	ips	because sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, is far more likely to give you a working configuration
2005-04-17T09:21:00.000Z	ips	daniels	oh ok I didn',t know
2005-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	ips	daniels	you seem to know alot, do you know why it could be that I can only access my XP partition as root and it doesnt seem to be possible to change the permissions
2005-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	daniels	ips	needs to be mounted with umask=002
2005-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	ips	daniels	how do I do that?
2005-04-17T09:24:00.000Z	daniels	ips	not sure if it's being automounted -- that should just work
2005-04-17T09:24:00.000Z	daniels	ips	if it's in /etc/fstab, edit that and add it to the options column
2005-04-17T09:24:00.000Z	daniels	ips	(or add uid=1000)
2005-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	ips	daniels	I add uid=1000 to fstab?
2005-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	ips	daniels	to options?
2005-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	ips	daniels	thanx
2005-04-17T09:30:00.000Z	ips	daniels	hmm, I tries both uid=1000 and umask=002, unmounted, remounted and I still can't access it outside of root.
2005-04-17T09:30:00.000Z	daniels	ips	ok, i have no idea, sorry
2005-04-17T09:30:00.000Z	ips	daniels	alright well thanks
2005-04-17T09:38:00.000Z	daniels	ips	could be getting mounted via pmount or such -- i'm not sure
2005-04-17T09:38:00.000Z	ips	daniels	pmount???
2005-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	ips	daniels	i also have rw,users,noauto in options
2005-04-17T09:40:00.000Z	daniels	ips	not sure, sorry
2005-04-17T09:40:00.000Z	ips	daniels	ok thanks
