2006-05-12T09:44:00.000Z	hastesaver	holycow	you might be interested to know that the !firefox1.5 page suggests using the auto-update mechanism of firefox. (Oh, and please don't change that page, it's fine ;)
2006-05-12T09:45:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	i'm not interested actually
2006-05-12T09:45:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	this is unix, this is an environment where we have the freedom to make the right sorts of decisions
2006-05-12T09:45:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	anyone worth their salt will tell you that letting apps be their own package managers is the stupidest idea ever
2006-05-12T09:46:00.000Z	hastesaver	holycow	yes of course, but when you want apps newer than the ones available in packages, you need to make compromises :)
2006-05-12T09:46:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	the neat thing is packaging apps for debina is fairly trivial too if you need to do it your self, thus upgrades are trivial even if not in repos
2006-05-12T09:47:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	when you want apps newer than repos, then you learn how to become a system administrator and do it properly
2006-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	i believe its called english
2006-05-12T10:03:00.000Z	hastesaver	holycow	stop; I'm sure his/her sufferring trying to learn Linux is nowhere close to the sufferring involved in using Windows :-)
2006-05-12T10:03:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	i wont, its wrong to insist that people should use linux when clearly a better solution exists
2006-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	holycow	hastesaver	no
