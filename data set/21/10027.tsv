2005-06-01T16:07:00.000Z	othernoob	nickrud	there's a download link, but poor quality..the dvd costs like $20...20 something
2005-06-01T16:08:00.000Z	nickrud	othernoob	I was kinda joking, but if its downloadable, i guess is is free :)
2005-06-01T16:09:00.000Z	othernoob	nickrud	well the link is on wikipedia :) but the quality isn't very good, however, before purchasing the dvd id go for it as well

2005-06-02T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	othernoob	I agree, but he can try mounting it, and check
