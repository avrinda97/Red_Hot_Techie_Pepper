2011-07-06T04:27:00.000Z	RPG-Master		What's the best file system for sharing between Ubuntu and OS X?
2011-07-06T04:28:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	what's your criteria for "best" ?
2011-07-06T04:28:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Besides FAT and its limited self.
2011-07-06T04:28:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	and define "sharing" too
2011-07-06T04:29:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	Well, something other than NTFS, but is still easily read able between the two, on an external HDD.
2011-07-06T04:30:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Unless NTFS is the only easy-to-set-up-and-read FS...
2011-07-06T04:30:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	so, really you mean "What FS should I use for my external hard disk to allow my mac and my ubuntu box to read it" ?
2011-07-06T04:30:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	Sorry, yeah that about sums it up.
2011-07-06T04:31:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Listening to metal while writing...
2011-07-06T04:31:00.000Z	RPG-Master		It messes with ya'
2011-07-06T04:31:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	it's cool, just making sure I captured your question correctly :) ... you might try the mac-native fs (HFS+ or whatever it's called?) I think the Linux kernel can read that
2011-07-06T04:32:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	Googling it now...
2011-07-06T04:32:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	or there might be a fuse package for it
2011-07-06T04:32:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	sudo apt-cache search hfs   suggests a few things too
2011-07-06T04:33:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	I have read about this MacFuse thing, and how it'll let you use most file systems on a Mac. But I couldn't figure out how to set it up.
2011-07-06T04:33:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	it's probably easier to let the mac use something native, and let the ubuntu box deal with it :)
2011-07-06T04:34:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	Probably. :P
2011-07-06T04:39:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	Scratch that. Linux can only read HFS+. Linux /can/ write, but you first must turn off journaling. Not good...
2011-07-06T04:49:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	in that case, it's probably the mac-fuse thing you need to look at then, or a format both can read.
2011-07-06T04:49:00.000Z	StevenR	RPG-Master	I'm gone now. (it's nearly 2am here!)
2011-07-06T04:50:00.000Z	RPG-Master	StevenR	Thanks and goodnight. :)
