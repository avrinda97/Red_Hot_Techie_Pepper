2010-06-16T08:08:00.000Z	wavedigit		hi everyone, when I first got my USB HDD I made an image of the local disk using the 'dd' command, the speeds were then around 20mb/s. Now, I can't get it over 10mb/s, what can I do to increase the speeds?
2010-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	wavedigit		I also benchmarked the speeds by copying USB HDD contents to /dev/zero
2010-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	wavedigit		...and copying the local content to /dev/zero
2010-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	wavedigit		both had appropriate speeds (the first, around 30mb/s and the latter was around 75mb/s)
2010-06-16T08:10:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	Nothing as the disk become more full it follows a growing circle that gets bigger which takes more time .. more time needed to write = slower speeds ... USBHDD's are < esata, firewire HDD's
2010-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	thanks, and if the USB HDD is formatted before it is written to?
2010-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	Doesn;t matter .. think of it as a glass .. the more more you pour into it the more full it gets and the firther from the bottom.
2010-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	the top becomes
2010-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	I see, but isn't the format setting the hard drive to 'empty' ?
2010-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	well yeah .. if you are using dd to format it though you are essentially writing to it the whole time ... as i said writing to it goes out in bigger circles each revolution which make  it take longer and thus slows write speeds
2010-06-16T08:17:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	writing 150GB took me 5 hours :x
2010-06-16T08:18:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	yeah USB HDD's are slow as hell
2010-06-16T08:20:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	They just are .. there isn't much anyone can do about it ... USB2.0 480Mb/sec == 60MB/sec .. that is the theoretical maximum speed of usb .. and if anyone knows anything thoeretical maximums are are just theory ... YMWV == Your Mileage Will Vary
2010-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	you're luck to see anything over 15MB/sec sustained from what I understand
2010-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	you are golden! :D
2010-06-16T08:25:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	just one more little question, let's say I wanted to make an image from my local HDD, and the target disk has already data on it, how would I still make an image and keep the existent data? dd into a subdir of the target disk?
2010-06-16T08:28:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	but the .img at the end is vital if you don't want to lose other data on the target device?
2010-06-16T08:28:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	nah .. just for bookkeeping purposes
2010-06-16T08:29:00.000Z	wavedigit	XFgolden	you just made my life a lot easier!
2010-06-16T08:29:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	you can try dd if=whatYouWantToCopy of=WhereYouWantItToGo bs=10M
2010-06-16T08:30:00.000Z	XFgolden	wavedigit	That will try to copy the data in 10MB blocks vs 512k nibbles
