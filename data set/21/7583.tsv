2007-01-28T11:12:00.000Z	gansinho		hello, please, I need some help, I'm trying to play a DVD that's ripped into my HD, but I would like to play it as an actual DVD, with menus and everything... maybe I should do a virtual DVD drive... or something else, could someone help me?
2007-01-28T11:12:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	is it still an iso ?
2007-01-28T11:13:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	no, its ripped, into all those vob and ifo's
2007-01-28T11:14:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	you have no clue?
2007-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	i forgot what i was trying to have a clu about sorry refresh me?

2007-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	oh yeah... i dont know offhand... perhaps mplayer can play the main thing... but its gonna get ugly i think... unless you can mount that to your /dev/dvd or /media/cdrom[somenumberhere] 
2007-01-28T11:18:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	yep, in mplayer i can watch, but no menus and nothing else, how can I create a virtual driver (ie, mount a folder as a driver in /media/cdrom2)
2007-01-28T11:21:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	lets try adapticing that for you: try um.. sudo mount -t ext3 -o -ro,loop=/dev/loop0 /path/to/dir /media/cdrom0
2007-01-28T11:22:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	there is no problem that the path to dir is direted to an external HD (maybe formated in vFat) there is?
2007-01-28T11:23:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	ok
2007-01-28T11:25:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	eh? you wanna mount this on your normal dvd directory so that it can be read....
2007-01-28T11:26:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	unh, ok, I thought that we're soposed to create a virtual DVD driver... but ok, now I get it
2007-01-28T11:26:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2007-01-28 02:52 /dev/dvd -> hdd
2007-01-28T11:27:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	ok so second dir is that [where its linked to instead of /media/cdrom0] 
2007-01-28T11:28:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	yep you're right
2007-01-28T11:29:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	with mount one uses sudo umount // tho if your program supports redefining the dvd dir then none of that is needed i think
2007-01-28T11:30:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	I'll look in  the configs of the programs... VLC should have it
2007-01-28T11:30:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	yeah it does.. and i think it will let you play that one file that leads to the whole dvd which i dont remember right now.. .bup or something
2007-01-28T11:31:00.000Z	gansinho	starz	yeah, mplayer has it... I will work on that and not bother you anymore, thanks for the help, a lot
2007-01-28T11:31:00.000Z	starz	gansinho	no problem google is our friend :>
