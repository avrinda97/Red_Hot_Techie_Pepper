2007-12-23T09:02:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	Wait, what do I do with that?
2007-12-23T09:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	That is how you add the codecs that you wanted
2007-12-23T09:03:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	Oh, ok.
2007-12-23T09:05:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	Umm, I think that's just for non-free formats. I somehow messed up the Ogg codecs :)
2007-12-23T09:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	You asked for video codecs...
2007-12-23T09:06:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	I asked how to reinstall the messed up ones I have now, but fair enough..
2007-12-23T09:08:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	Any clue the name of Ogg codecs?
2007-12-23T09:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	I need to eat dinner...   But not knowing what all you did or didnt do, I would start with the restricted formats, which is why I linked them.
2007-12-23T09:11:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	Hope it's a good dinner :D
2008-01-09T02:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	double click them.. but where did you get it...
2008-01-09T02:29:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	It's x64 opera
2008-01-09T02:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	There should be a readme file inside or info where you downloaded it.
2008-03-05T04:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	People will need to know what video card you are running
2008-03-05T04:11:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	one is a nvidia geforce 7300 gs
2008-03-05T04:12:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	hehe
2008-03-05T04:13:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	I could do multiple monitors with one video card? err, how?
2008-03-05T04:17:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	can't I just use the built in dual monitor thing?
2008-03-05T04:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reportingsjr	I dont do the dual monitor thing, just pointed you to what others wrote up on using them
2008-03-05T04:18:00.000Z	reportingsjr	Jack_Sparrow	well they didn't help at all =\
