2011-12-29T04:59:00.000Z	Melissa		i want to run W7 for an online game I have and run Ubuntu for evertythiung else.  Whatrs best way to install?  W7 first or install Ubuntu first?  and can I run W732bit and Ubuntu 64bit on the same laptop?
2011-12-29T04:59:00.000Z	yumbo	Melissa	which game?
2011-12-29T04:59:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	battlefield 2142
2011-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	yumbo	Melissa	good chance it will work with wine (running the game in Ubuntu)
2011-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	it wont. i read about it and punkbuster dont work properly either
2011-12-29T05:02:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	battlefield 2142 needs punkbuster etc.
2011-12-29T05:02:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	the single player works, not online multiplayer apparently
2011-12-29T05:03:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	notice that link you gave it says, "PunkBuster used to work ok in Wine 0.9.47, but in Wine 0.9.59 I keep getting kicked within seconds on connecting. This may have just been a fluke, but I will do some more testing to see if I can find a cause.
2011-12-29T05:04:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	MultiPlayer Mode is a Problem, cause Punkbuster kicks your from server, because the fingerprint of the wine appi's/dll's are not from Microsoft... Have contacted EvenBalance, the Maintainer of Punkbuster.. but seams that there is no chance to get Punkbuster work in wine... ;(..
2011-12-29T05:05:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	i thought I will use Ubuntu for everything.  and then boot up W7 if I want to play battlefield 2142.  So what you recommend how I go about doing this?
2011-12-29T05:06:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	how many partitions do I need to create? and what sizes?  I have a 500GB hdd
2011-12-29T05:06:00.000Z	yumbo	Melissa	Do you have anything installed already?
2011-12-29T05:06:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	the W7 has already created D: for rescue
2011-12-29T05:07:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	W7 is on C: and D: is for restore, and E: contains HP tools and drivers.  So where and how can I install ubuntu?
2011-12-29T05:09:00.000Z	yumbo	Melissa	what are the sizes of C, D and E at the moment?
2011-12-29T05:09:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	about 11GB for D: and 10GB for E: and rest for C:.  total is 500GB
2011-12-29T05:10:00.000Z	yumbo	Melissa	then you boot a live-cd and reinstall grub
2011-12-29T05:10:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	will the live CD give ability to install Grub and Grub will know to boot Ubuntu from F: drive?
2011-12-29T05:11:00.000Z	yumbo	Melissa	firstly you'll need to shrink the windows C: partition (something like 40~70gb)
2011-12-29T05:11:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	maybe I should keep W7 on C:, delete D: and F: cause they only contain W7 restore image and tools, and then install Ubuntu on D:?
2011-12-29T05:12:00.000Z	Melissa	yumbo	maybe I could use EaseUS todo to backup W7, then I wont need D: and E:, right?
