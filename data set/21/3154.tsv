2011-03-22T16:12:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1		can u pls recommend me a gui client for ssh transfers? (i.e. scp?)
2011-03-22T16:13:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	Use scp in a GUI terminal window.  (See man ssh)
2011-03-22T16:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	which was what i was trying to avoid as i have so many files in so many different folders to copy...
2011-03-22T16:15:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	You can do them all at once. Which folders?
2011-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	i am copying the contents of ldap related files for documentation purposes, meaning pma.d etc involved...
2011-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	You can create a ziped archived file and then transfer it.
2011-03-22T16:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	well i actually did not want to include all of etc, and hand picking it brings me back to square one concerning effort...
2011-03-22T16:19:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	Pici: jrib: dnivra: anyways thanks alot, i got what i need now:)
2011-03-22T16:19:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	I don't think a GUI interface would make the process any faster or easier.
2011-03-22T16:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	well it does trust me;)
2011-03-22T16:21:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	Well, then you could set up an ftp server on one end and use a browser to do it.  But that seems a rather clumsy alternative.
2011-03-22T16:24:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	nope, easiest method so far was the one sugfgested by dnivra; just go to places/connect to server, that does it for me!:)
2011-03-22T16:25:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	tar czvf data.tgz dir-1/ dir-1/ dir-3 ; scp data.tgz user@192.168.1.5   #What is easier than that?
2011-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	Well, yes, if you have a server on the other machine, but then you have to select all the data you want to transfer.
2011-03-22T16:27:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	tar czvf data.tgz dir-1/ dir-1/ dir-3 ; scp data.tgz user@192.168.1.5:     #Forgot the colon at end, thanks elFidel
2011-03-22T16:27:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	Or tar czvf data.tgz dir-1/ dir-1/ dir-3 ; scp data.tgz user@192.168.1.5:Documents/
2011-03-22T16:28:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	do it for 38 files located in 25 different folders, wish you much fun with forgetting nothing;)
2011-03-22T16:29:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	I don't see how some browser looking GUI window is going to help you remember all 38 files any better than using ssh in a GUI terminal
2011-03-22T16:31:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	But if you have found a good method that you like, go for it.  I'm just trying to suggest what I believe to be the most effecient method.
2011-03-22T16:41:00.000Z	terry	remoteCTRL1	Once you learn how to use the tab key to auto-complete, it will be a breeze, (but maybe you already know but just fyi..)
2011-03-22T16:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	terry	jrib: i like you guys! :D basically i am a sysadmin as profession and linux is our only operating system (debian and ubuntu)! so yes, i do know how to use the cli and yes i know what tab completion is, yet still you need to remember the NAME in order to use tab completion and yes for /etc/pam.d you can use wildcards like /etc/pam.d/common* but this already also affects one file that is vain for my purpose, so believe me guys, openi
