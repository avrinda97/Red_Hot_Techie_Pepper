2008-01-06T16:51:00.000Z	ere4si		google is getting me nowhere - 4 cli only installs and each starts services after the login - so I can't access the system - how do I get around this?
2008-01-06T16:51:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	what program are you using? SSH??
2008-01-06T16:52:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	haven't got an accessable install yet so haven't got as far as ssh
2008-01-06T16:53:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	what's causing so many problems with installation? (sorry, I might not have gotten the whole story)
2008-01-06T16:53:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	that and ubuntu minimal - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD - do the same - and can't find a solution...
2008-01-06T16:54:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	services start after the login prompt - so I can't login
2008-01-06T16:54:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	the mini packages can be problematic, you said you have tried an installation of, say... Ubuntu server 7.1 from the full image version??
2008-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	tried minimal and alternate
2008-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	sounds like a bad install (I JUST finished an install of Gutsy Gibbon and out-of-the-box w/ SSH installed I can SSH in with putty)
2008-01-06T16:56:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	but I can't say that with certainty, sorry mate.
2008-01-06T16:56:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	two diff cd's - md5 checks ok...
2008-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	right
2008-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	so what all do you have installed thus far on the server? (SSH, Apache, etc.)
2008-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	killed the services in rc2 and rebooted then new ones start after login
2008-01-06T16:58:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	can't login normal user so haven't installed more than cli ubuntu
2008-01-06T16:59:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	when you installed from the 7.1 server image (the full 600 MB one) and you had the option of installing some of the server packages (like SSH) from the cd, did you use that?
2008-01-06T17:00:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	no - want only nfs for headless home server on old comp
2008-01-06T17:01:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	you want this as a local file server? are you intending to access it via FTP or what protocol?
2008-01-06T17:02:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	nfs - ssh to control it
2008-01-06T17:03:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	ere4si	log in locally on the system to setup the SSH and then setup NFS from there. If you can't get the NFS services running without logging in, its a configuration issue or its not possible w/ NFS>
2008-01-06T17:05:00.000Z	ere4si	WNxCryptic	 can't log in normal user as services start after the login prompt - have to hard reboot into single user to kill services but then other ones start after normal user prompt - very frustrating...
