2011-11-26T12:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 whats your video chipset
2011-11-26T12:57:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	nvidia 9600m gt
2011-11-26T16:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 stop the X server.. i alwyas use the nvidia drivers from the repos... they automcaitcally black list the nouveau drivers
2011-11-26T16:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 using that .sh installer may cause issues.
2011-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	doesnt recognise the service
2011-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	i have x server down
2011-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 what release are you using?
2011-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	10.10
2011-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 it would be sudo serivce gdm stop     then
2011-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 then you can try that script. but i reccomend using the versions in the repos/addational-drivers tool
2011-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	i am running kubuntu now, maybe i should run kdm stop?
2011-11-26T17:36:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	ok i just typed in blacklist nouveau
2011-11-26T17:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 or as a kernel boot option ------>  Otherwise, try nouveau.modeset=0 to disable modesetting
2011-11-26T17:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 when i installed my nvidia drivers - they automcaically blacklisted  it.
2011-11-26T17:37:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	it doesnt blacklist it in mine. what is best to use? kernel boot option or blacklist?
2011-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 or both.. ive not had to blacklist it by hand on my 4 nvidia machines.
2011-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	Timewarper	dr_willis	can you remind me the other option? where is my blacklist
2011-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Timewarper	 rember !blacklist  for the bot factoid
