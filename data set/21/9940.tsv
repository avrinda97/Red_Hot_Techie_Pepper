2005-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jaysinn	that's important, you need to re-start your comp and boot into Ubuntu :)
2005-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jaysinn	is this the live cd your running or did you actually install /
2005-06-19T07:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jaysinn	re-boot your computer and you will be presented with a choice of which operating system you want to launch ....select Ubuntu
