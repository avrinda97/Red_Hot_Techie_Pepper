2005-12-23T11:00:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	Add Applications didn't open a window for me.  I should say I'm using Dapper Drake if that matters.
2005-12-23T11:00:00.000Z	thegladiator	aTypical	do you see ? please do temme
2005-12-23T11:02:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	it's the latest and greatest.
2005-12-23T11:02:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	is there a command line I can run to get the add applications menu?
2005-12-23T11:03:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	maybe I'll have to sign up to a mailing list.
2005-12-23T11:03:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	it asked for my password, but just never opened anything.
2005-12-23T11:04:00.000Z	thegladiator	aTypical	what did you type there ? your user pass ?
2005-12-23T11:05:00.000Z	thegladiator	aTypical	did you check synaptic ?
2005-12-23T11:05:00.000Z	thegladiator	aTypical	^
2005-12-23T11:05:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	no, but I will.
2005-12-23T11:07:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	_jason , thank you.  Running it in a terminal I do see that it segfaults.
2005-12-23T11:08:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	I also see that I can add eclipse under synaptic.
2005-12-23T11:08:00.000Z	thegladiator	aTypical	cool :)
2005-12-23T11:11:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	doesn't seem to want to install there either.  Lots of unresolved dependencies.  At this point I'll wait.  Maybe Dapper is a little too new.
2005-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	thegladiator	aTypical	the general consensus is that there is no such general consensus ;d
2005-12-23T16:03:00.000Z	aTypical	thegladiator	that's the problem.  How do you know which is good and which is a POS?
