2008-05-21T23:58:00.000Z	soundray		Please give me a troubleshooting suggestion. I've managed to create a CD image with brasero, now I'm trying to burn it -- but the Burn button is inactive. What can I do?
2008-05-21T23:58:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	make sure the cd doesn't have something written to it already
2008-05-21T23:59:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	brasero reports it as blank
2008-05-21T23:59:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	how big is the image?
2008-05-22T00:00:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	I've got two, neither works (623280000 bytes and 660646224 bytes)
2008-05-22T00:00:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	CD-R claims 700MB
2008-05-22T00:01:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	sorry, not really familiar with brasero, so I'm stabbing in the dark
2008-05-22T00:03:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	I'm running Ubuntu in a VM -- but should it make a difference, since it reports the blank CD as writable?
2008-05-22T00:03:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	no idea. I wouldn't think so
2008-05-22T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	okay, thanks... I'll try with k3b. Annoying thing is, k3b won't read the brasero image, so I'm going to have to re-create that.
2008-05-22T00:04:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	it didn't just make an iso?
2008-05-22T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	no, a bin/toc (audio CD)
2008-05-22T00:09:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	'man update-grub' tells you how to make permanent changes
2008-05-22T00:09:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	thanks!
2008-05-22T00:09:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	thanks. Perfect!
2008-05-22T00:09:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	oh, for the non-ubuntu ones
2008-05-22T00:10:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	you just have to put them outside the DEBIAN-AUTOMAGIC-something section
2008-05-22T00:11:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	I mean, place the entries after the line ### END DEBIAN AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST
2008-05-22T00:23:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	making progress... cdrdao seems to be burning my image just fine
2008-05-22T00:26:00.000Z	SuperguyA1	soundray	awesome!
2008-05-22T00:27:00.000Z	soundray	SuperguyA1	hooray, it worked :)
