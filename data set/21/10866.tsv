2004-10-21T08:06:00.000Z	spiv	Jet2k5	http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/BinaryDriverHowto
2004-10-21T08:12:00.000Z	Jet2k5	spiv	what does that link have to do with anything?
2004-10-21T08:13:00.000Z	spiv	Jet2k5	The steps listed under "ATI".
2004-10-21T08:14:00.000Z	spiv	Jet2k5	it's in the linux-source package... but what's the name of the module you said you wanted to comile?
2004-10-21T08:19:00.000Z	spiv	Jet2k5	Most of those modules should already be compiled into the ubuntu kernel...
2004-10-21T08:22:00.000Z	spiv	Jet2k5	Seriously, I doubt you need to compile, let alone recompile, anything :)
