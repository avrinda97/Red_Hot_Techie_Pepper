2007-08-25T07:09:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	exit your keyboard settings in xorg.conf same as they were before then
2007-08-25T07:09:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	meant edit not exit sorry
2007-08-25T07:09:00.000Z	goundy	gerro	I tried it
2007-08-25T07:10:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	still having trouble?
2007-08-25T07:10:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	what sort of keyboard is it bluetooth?
2007-08-25T07:10:00.000Z	goundy	gerro	no, I've an acer laptop
2007-08-25T07:10:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	are you typing on it now? is it just certain key combinations its missing?
2007-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	then add them in
2007-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	goundy	gerro	print screen and alt gr won't work
2007-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	goundy	gerro	I tried to modify for example from BE (belgium) to FR (french) but I got an error from xkbcomp
2007-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	you probably uninstalled the program that handles print screen. On xubuntu it doesn't even have that app so I configured imagemagick to take a snapshot and timestamp it in my pictures folder
2007-08-25T07:12:00.000Z	goundy	gerro	i didn't uninstalled anything I've just upgraded from dapper -> edgy -> feisty
2007-08-25T07:12:00.000Z	gerro	goundy	you speak french, belgium, and english?
