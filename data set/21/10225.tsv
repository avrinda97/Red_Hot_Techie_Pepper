2005-04-20T09:39:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	plug it in :)
2005-04-20T09:39:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	stick in a cd
2005-04-20T09:39:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	should just work
2005-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	ml267	jdubFest	it doesn't just work :(
2005-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	ah
2005-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	see, that complicates things :)
2005-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	do you know if a driver is loaded for it?
2005-04-20T09:46:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	dude, run the following:
2005-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	righto, so looks like it found your usb controller
2005-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	if it's in that list, the driver is loaded
2005-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	so, now plug in your CD drive, and see if it appears in that list
2005-04-20T09:48:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	alternatively, you can load up the device manager gui (hal-device-manager)
2005-04-20T09:48:00.000Z	ml267	jdubFest	oh.. devices should show up too?
2005-04-20T09:48:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	yes
2005-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	ml267	jdubFest	hey, I see the drive in the drive manager
2005-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	great - this is how plug and play is meant to be ;-)
2005-04-20T09:50:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	stick in a cd, then check the output of 'mount'
2005-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	ml267	jdubFest	device manager shows the cdrom drive as /dev/sr0
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	ml267	jdubFest	i can even mount the drive and see its contents...  now i need to change my apt sources.list to know to get packages from the cd.  can someone help?
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	jdubFest	ml267	run apt-cdrom
