2005-02-06T08:19:00.000Z	rob__		I've been thinking about getting a dual screen videocard for my desktop.
2005-02-06T08:20:00.000Z	rob__		nevyn:whats your take on this?
2005-02-06T08:21:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	just pick up another cheap pci card and stick it in
2005-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	: I had 1 agp and 2 pci cards with 3 screens at one point http://www.pybe.co.uk/files/temp-upload/my-office/my-office-1.jpg
2005-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	rob__	pybe	how well does that work, I have integrated soundcard on my motherbord and a soundcard I put in and only one works (the motherbord one) even thought the soundcard worked fine before I moved it to this PC on ubuntu
2005-02-06T08:24:00.000Z	rob__	pybe	well that answers my question
2005-02-06T08:24:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	im using 2 cards at the mo on ubuntu
2005-02-06T08:25:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	try to disable the ondoard on in the bios and see if ubuntu picks up the other
2005-02-06T08:25:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	is it in lspci?
2005-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	what for?
2005-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	do lspci | grep audio in a termina
2005-02-06T08:27:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	in vol prefs are the 2 choices oss and alsa?
2005-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	if so thats the 2 different sound systems not 2 differnt cards
2005-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	open the prefs and does it say at the end of the 2 choises OSS on one ans ALSA on the other
2005-02-06T08:30:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	ok they are both picked up and with the drivers
2005-02-06T08:31:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	try setting them all to alsa and the same device, see which ones the cirrus
2005-02-06T08:32:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	select them in the drop down
2005-02-06T08:34:00.000Z	rob__	pybe	i cant find the drop down menu is it because I am running hoary?
2005-02-06T08:35:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	im on hoary
2005-02-06T08:36:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	easyest thing to try 1st is to reboot and enter your bios setup
2005-02-06T08:37:00.000Z	pybe	rob__	and look to see if you have an option to disable onboard sound
