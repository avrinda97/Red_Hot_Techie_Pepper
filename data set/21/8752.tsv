2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	hey.... when are your repos gonna be back up?
2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	Seveas	KoruptidPryde	they're not down
2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	Seveas	KoruptidPryde	they're not down either :)

2006-01-27T10:20:00.000Z	Seveas	KoruptidPryde	RSN
2006-01-27T10:21:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	I'm assuming the last two letters of that stood for "sometime never"

2006-02-20T13:12:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	for the love of all that is right with the world help meeeeeeee
2006-02-20T13:14:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	shouldn't any PCMCIA card at least be recognized by the cardbus adapter enough to get its hardware info and set up ndiswrapper to interface with it?
2006-02-20T13:15:00.000Z	Seveas	KoruptidPryde	lspci should list it even without ndiswrapper installed
2006-02-20T13:16:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	it doesn't.... which makes me think that my PCMCIA slot is broken.... but dmesg shows that the kernel is recognizing cards being inserted andremoved from it
2006-02-20T13:16:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	and the bus IS providing power to the card
2006-02-20T13:18:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	setuid: they are linksys broadcom cards..... there is no native module, hence the ndiswrappers
2006-02-20T13:21:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	is there a wayto list pcmcia hardware even if the card has nokernel module support?
2006-02-20T14:41:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	I found the problem
2006-02-20T14:42:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	Seveas	or more accurately... found the solution
