2008-05-02T18:34:00.000Z	LordMorgoth		ï»¿ made a small bash script that will be triggered when i want to decrease or increase my screen brightness. however is is not able to execute nvidia-settings from the script. any ideas ?
2008-05-02T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	nvidia-settings is an x app, what happens when you try to luanch it
2008-05-02T18:35:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	it is an x app but u can use it from the command line also
2008-05-02T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	the command line and executed from a script can be different, hence why I'm asking for the results
2008-05-02T18:36:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	 oh, well if i run nvidia-settings it will open the GUI app, and when i type it with additional arguments (the one im executing from the script) it executes them perfectly
2008-05-02T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	what happens when you start it from the script
2008-05-02T18:38:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	if i ./myscript.sh everything works well. but when i trigger the brightness button, while tail -f /var/log/acpid i notice this error : ERROR: The control display is undefined; please run `nvidia-settings--help` for usage information.
2008-05-02T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	thats interesting.
2008-05-02T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	it looks like the environment it's being run in is not taking settings from your user environnment
2008-05-02T18:39:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	thats frustrating :(
2008-05-02T18:40:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	well i though of this, ... the enviroment thingy
2008-05-02T18:40:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	 how do i change the path for it ?
2008-05-02T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	I don't think it's a path sort of thing
2008-05-02T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	assuming it is an envionment thing, let me ponder it
2008-05-02T18:41:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	 k mate :)
2008-05-02T18:56:00.000Z	LordMorgoth	ikonia	any hope ?
2008-05-02T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	LordMorgoth	not yet,
