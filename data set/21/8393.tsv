2006-07-02T09:27:00.000Z	_joe	tanlaan	ah. have you read about setting up session startup things in the wiki yet?
2006-07-02T09:27:00.000Z	_joe	tanlaan	if not, i'd suggest that
2006-07-02T09:28:00.000Z	tanlaan	_joe	no i havent
2006-07-02T09:28:00.000Z	_joe	tanlaan	i think if you search it for "startup" you'll find the page
2006-07-02T09:28:00.000Z	_joe	tanlaan	but...if you shell script doesn't work to begin with, you're going to have trouble
