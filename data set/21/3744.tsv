2008-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	blueeagle		I am in need of running a script every three hours and one minute (not 1 minute passed every 3rd hour). Does anyone know how that may best be accomplished?
2008-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	blueeagle		ie if it runs at noon then it needs to run at one past three and two passed six.
2008-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	put it in cron, 3,6,9,`12,16,20,00
2008-10-08T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	youd have to script that then
2008-10-08T15:15:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	I was afraid of that. :/ And I so love bash scripting. :p
2008-10-08T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	call the php cli interface in a script
2008-10-08T15:32:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	Well which script would that be. I've never done any scripts for /etc/init.d before.
2008-10-08T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	you need to make a new one, or put it in rc.local
2008-10-08T15:34:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	ahh.. googling for rc.local then. :)
2008-10-08T15:36:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	Is it cocher to put: "php /path/to/script.php &" into rc.local for a script that will perpetually run?
2008-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	dno't see why not
2008-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	It didn't work to run "php scriptname.php &" as it gets stopped when put in background. :/
2008-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	nohup it
2008-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	Well that helped, but even sleep() in php causes it to use 90+% cpu. :/
2008-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	Thanks for the guidance tho. Really appreciated.
2008-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	php cli stuff normally spikes at startup then settles down - I don't know why
2008-10-08T15:54:00.000Z	blueeagle	ikonia	Again you are right. Thanks a million. ;)
2008-10-08T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	no problem
2008-10-08T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	I wish I could explain why that happens
2008-10-08T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	tahts dns it will default to the domain record for the domain
2008-10-08T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	blueeagle	there will be a hostname but it's not shown
