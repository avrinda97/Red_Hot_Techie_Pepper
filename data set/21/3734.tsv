2010-01-07T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	HtheB	what do you want to install ?
2010-01-07T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	HtheB	I wouldn't try to repackage that rpm - it's got dependencies on specific c++ libraries
2010-01-07T19:43:00.000Z	HtheB	ikonia	depencies? what do u mean?
2010-01-07T19:43:00.000Z	ikonia	HtheB	the software will depend on specific library versions, in specific locations
