2005-08-27T14:46:00.000Z	darksoul		im just running normal ubuntu
2005-08-27T14:47:00.000Z	darksoul		how do i upgrade to the new gnome, isnt there a apt-get command
2005-08-27T14:47:00.000Z	darksoul		its beta right
2005-08-27T14:47:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	there is no new gnome except the 2.11 development version
2005-08-27T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	"gnome-about". and there's a menu entry too
2005-08-27T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	gnome in the stable ubuntu is whatever it was when ubuntu was released
2005-08-27T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	be assured, ubuntu always has the latest gnome :)
2005-08-27T14:52:00.000Z	darksoul	topyli	thks, i got my ubuntu months ago just havent installed it for awhile
2005-08-27T14:53:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	i'm basically just hungry for the new gnome once it's ready
2005-08-27T14:53:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	the system in general has been working just fine for me for years. it's the desktop that evolves the most
2005-08-27T14:55:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	you can just change everything hoary in your sources.list to breezy and upgrade. i wouldn't recommend it yet though
2005-08-27T14:56:00.000Z	darksoul	topyli	can u give me the exact sources?
2005-08-27T14:56:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	it's different if it's not a production system
2005-08-27T14:56:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	no :)
2005-08-27T14:57:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	no, i'm on a stable hoary box myself. i only have one spare box at work that i upgraded (and broke)
2005-11-20T16:47:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	the dooms, quakes, and other binaries for linux are free, but of course you need the official data files
2005-11-20T16:47:00.000Z	darksoul	topyli	*sigh*
2005-11-20T16:48:00.000Z	topyli	darksoul	why would it suddenly be free? just because you're installing it on a free system?
2005-11-20T16:48:00.000Z	darksoul	topyli	yes lol
