2009-07-24T01:24:00.000Z	Jcn		hey guys. I have an ati radeon x1250 that I am trying to install drivers for, anybody on here that could give me a walkthrough?
2009-07-24T01:25:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	on Ubuntu 9.04?
2009-07-24T01:26:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	 yes
2009-07-24T01:27:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	Ok, i dunno how far the legacy drivers has come(long story short: lateast drivers for older than radeon 2xxx does not support new improved xorg).
2009-07-24T01:28:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	so what are my options
2009-07-24T01:28:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	If you want 3D performance than your not in good luck, unless legacy has come along. If you just want video and 2D to work, then the free drivers wokr(and i dunno how to install)
2009-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	ati radeon x1250 is listed in the legacy drivers
2009-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	ok
2009-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	give me a few seconds
2009-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	to write down all you need to know :P
2009-07-24T01:32:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	ok, then it is to downgrade the x server i guess
2009-07-24T01:32:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	what is the xserver
2009-07-24T01:32:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	something on display and grapics and 3D
2009-07-24T01:32:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	the system needs it
2009-07-24T01:33:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	ok so i need to have an older xserver in order to run the ati legacy driver correctly?
2009-07-24T01:34:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	yupp, or you could use the opensource driver. I dunno if it is installed upon install Ubuntu how it is
2009-07-24T01:34:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	and also what about envyng?
2009-07-24T01:35:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	I am sad to say so, but i got no clue <.<
2009-07-24T01:36:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	If there was a working legacy driver this would have been over already after some nifty copy-paste <.<
2009-07-24T01:36:00.000Z	Jcn	delly	well I am not convinced that there is nothing I can do, thanks for your help though
2009-07-24T01:47:00.000Z	delly	Jcn	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver My nift random searching might help <.<
