2011-06-27T22:11:00.000Z	XDM_		hello again, can anyone help me with my disc space issue?
2011-06-27T22:11:00.000Z	XDM_		( i got disconnected)
2011-06-27T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 if you did a 'live' cd type insatll to a hard drive. it should have made a 'persistant save file' - that file could be getting filled up.
2011-06-27T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 you used the Universial USB installer tool from the 'pendrivelinux' web site?
2011-06-27T22:12:00.000Z	XDM_	dr_willis	Im not sure if I did a "live" cd, but I think I am running ubuntu "live"
2011-06-27T22:12:00.000Z	XDM_	dr_willis	: yes i think so
2011-06-27T22:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 that method is normally used for smaller flash drives like 4-16gb. with a small (a few gb) persistant save file. I think the max save file it can use is 4gb normally
2011-06-27T22:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 the BEST solution would be for you to do a 'normal' install to that external usb hd. as if it was an internal hd.
2011-06-27T22:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 when doing that instasll you need to make some partitions and define one to be the '/' partition, and one to be a swap partition.   the easy route would be for you to burn a cd. and boot the cd. and insatll from taht to the hard drive
2011-06-27T22:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 because it will want to resize the partitons that are IN USE...
2011-06-27T22:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 if you partiton the hd with a live cd. that may be doable.. but  thats getting very weird way of doing an inzstall
2011-06-27T22:17:00.000Z	XDM_	dr_willis	 could i boot ubuntu from another USB drive, and then install it to the external HDD?
2011-06-27T22:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 its because of the way you installed it.. the normal way is boot a cd, or flash drive. and isntall to the other location
2011-06-27T22:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 you can do that.. thats exactly how i normally do it.
2011-06-27T22:20:00.000Z	XDM_	dr_willis	so if i boot from a different USB flash drive, my big 250GB drive will be free and ubuntu will let me use it as the HDD ?
2011-06-27T22:20:00.000Z	XDM_	dr_willis	is ubuntu going to recognize the external USB HDD as a HDD if im not using it as a LIve drive
2011-06-27T22:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 it can repartiton and use the usb as a real hd.. thats EXACTLY how i am running this sytem right now
2011-06-27T22:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 you can tell the installer to use all of the disk..  and it should auto partito9n it as needed.
2011-06-27T22:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 the normal ubuntu installer...
2011-06-27T22:24:00.000Z	XDM_	dr_willis	i now have no idea what you are talkinbg aout
2011-06-27T22:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDM_	 yes. thats how i always install.
