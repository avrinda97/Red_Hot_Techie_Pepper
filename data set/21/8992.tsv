2006-03-21T11:18:00.000Z	zezu		what options do i need ?
2006-03-21T11:19:00.000Z	zezu		all i do is mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /win
2006-03-21T11:19:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	add the uid thing to your fstab and nls=utf8
2006-03-21T11:20:00.000Z	zezu	ufo	whats the uid thing ?
2006-03-21T11:21:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	umask 0222
2006-03-21T11:21:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	see the wiki
2006-03-21T11:35:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	ati works fine with fglrx drivers
2006-03-21T11:35:00.000Z	zezu	ufo	no they dont on my box
2006-03-21T11:36:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	what card?
2006-03-21T11:36:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	have you got the 3d accelaration to work
2006-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	are you sure the reason is fglrx
2006-03-21T11:38:00.000Z	zezu	ufo	yes, it could be because of agpgart but either way its fglrx failing in the end
2006-03-21T11:38:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	do you use dapper?
2006-03-21T11:39:00.000Z	zezu	ufo	i've read that before
2006-03-21T11:40:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	have tried the last thread
2006-03-21T11:43:00.000Z	zezu	ufo	i s`pose i'll give it a shot later, if it comes down to it maybe the fglrx driver will let me use xv even if dri doesn't init
2006-03-21T12:03:00.000Z	zezu	ufo	same shit
2006-03-21T12:05:00.000Z	ufo	zezu	you could try to create new xorg.conf... did you use the old one?
