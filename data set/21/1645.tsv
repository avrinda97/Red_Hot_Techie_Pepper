2011-02-27T23:18:00.000Z	abhay_	bazhang	no i downloaded it from ubuntu software center and installed. I also don't want to loose my data, could i also do it in the disk utility
2011-02-27T23:19:00.000Z	bazhang	abhay_	you cant do it on a working partition you realize
2011-02-27T23:41:00.000Z	bazhang	abhay_	those are way too huge
2011-02-27T23:42:00.000Z	abhay_	bazhang	how is it huge sir.

2011-02-27T23:45:00.000Z	abhay_	bazhang	the reason i was making the / a large partions so that in the future i have space when download programs and stuff. or will i be able to extend it later on?
2011-02-27T23:46:00.000Z	bazhang	abhay_	you would have to install every single package to fill that. and you would still have a huge amount of space left
2011-02-27T23:46:00.000Z	abhay_	bazhang	ok i guess i can make it smaller size.
2011-02-27T23:47:00.000Z	bazhang	abhay_	a LOT smaller
