2006-10-14T13:27:00.000Z	freakabcd	LittleFireCracke	then once you close this small dialog window, you should have an 'Options' tab in the volume control. in there check if it shoes 2 options for you. try with both options
2006-10-14T13:30:00.000Z	LittleFireCracke	freakabcd	I don't see the options dialog.

2006-10-14T13:31:00.000Z	freakabcd	LittleFireCracke	then, did you cick on Edit->Preferences?
2006-10-14T13:32:00.000Z	freakabcd	LittleFireCracke	now, in there, did you scroll down and put a tick in the checkbox next to 'Mic Select' ?
2006-10-14T13:32:00.000Z	LittleFireCracke	freakabcd	the usb-device had only one option, microphone.

2006-10-14T13:37:00.000Z	LittleFireCracke	freakabcd	I didn't try the cam, but the mic does show up.
