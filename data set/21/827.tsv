2011-05-22T23:47:00.000Z	Matt_799		How can I fix a computer hardware problem.
2011-05-22T23:48:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	replace defect hardware i would guess
2011-05-22T23:48:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	describe the problem maybe we can help
2011-05-22T23:50:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	put battery out .cut the powerline off and hold the power button for about 10 seconds
2011-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	then butt the battery and/or power line back and try to start again..does it show a picture?
2011-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	Matt_799	onetwo	i think this will take longer than 10 seconds and it will be normal again
2011-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	just try..i have a lot of laptops and sometimes they work after that procedure i have told you
2011-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	Matt_799	onetwo	will this fix the crash or the problems starting it after the crash or both?
2011-05-22T23:53:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	so the laptop starts up booting..then while booting the operating system it crashes and wont start??what does the crash look like
2011-05-22T23:54:00.000Z	Matt_799	onetwo	no after the crash, i press the power button to turn it back on, but it doesnt turn on, it doens't really do anything except blink some lights
2011-05-22T23:55:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	then 1. take battery out and plug the power off
2011-05-22T23:55:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	2. hold power button for some seconds ..aabout 10
2011-05-22T23:55:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	3. put power back in and start the device
2011-05-22T23:57:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	when you have done this and start the device what exactly happens then
2011-05-22T23:57:00.000Z	Matt_799	onetwo	but after i have tried turning it back on a couple times it will turn back on
2011-05-22T23:58:00.000Z	Matt_799	onetwo	but i will do what you suggest
2011-05-22T23:58:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	when it turns back on please describe what exactly happens then
2011-05-22T23:59:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	its your laptop you should know
2011-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	normally there are buttons to release the battery
2011-05-23T00:04:00.000Z	Matt_799	onetwo	should the computer be on but every program closed before I do: 1. take battery out and plug the power off
2011-05-23T00:04:00.000Z	onetwo	Matt_799	its a little confusing what you tell..so first of all: what operating system
