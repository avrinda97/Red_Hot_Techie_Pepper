2010-11-04T01:39:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi		I can't install abiword because my repository server doesn't seem to have a "libgdome2-0" package. I thought it was a typo
2010-11-04T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	pastebin exactly what you are executing and the full output
2010-11-04T01:40:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	wait... now I'm having a weird problem with gksu
2010-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi		gksudo seems to work but gksu doesn't
2010-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	one problem at a time
2010-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	#2 was found while trying to change the server to solve #1
2010-11-04T01:43:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	problem 1 solved, the main server works, it's just the spain server the one having trouble with abiword
2010-11-04T01:43:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	ok, what are you executing with gksu that doesn't work?
2010-11-04T01:44:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	software-properties-gtk
2010-11-04T01:44:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi		first from the menu, then from command line
2010-11-04T01:44:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	what happens exactly?
2010-11-04T01:44:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	it asks me for my password and then does nothing, it just returns to the prompt
2010-11-04T01:45:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	does it work with a different command?
2010-11-04T01:46:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	gksudo does work, but gksu doesn't. I'll try other GUI programs apart from apt-related
2010-11-04T01:47:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	same for `gksu nautilus` and `gksudo nautilus`. Latter works, former doesn't.
2010-11-04T01:49:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	which is pretty weird since gksudo is a link to gksu
2010-11-04T01:50:00.000Z	jrib		!ot | Nayr
2010-11-04T01:50:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi		will try to solve this later
2010-11-04T01:50:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	internally, the code checks how it's called and acts differently
2010-11-04T01:51:00.000Z	cousteau`irssi	jrib	just read something about a gconf entry, will see that after dinner
2010-11-04T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	cousteau`irssi	k, good luck
