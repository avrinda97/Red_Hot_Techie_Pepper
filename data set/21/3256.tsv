2009-10-29T19:34:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	now, how do I get it to SHOW the terminal?
2009-10-29T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	i think if you write a script then select, show in terminal it should display
2009-10-29T19:35:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	There is no "show in terminal" in the Startup Options
2009-10-29T19:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	there is on a script though, if you right click the script you can select run in terminal, you will then add the script to the startup items
2009-10-29T19:41:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	the "make a script" thing doesn't work either
2009-10-29T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	hmm, then not sure, you could edit the script to run a terminal, then run a command inside it
2009-10-29T19:44:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	that's not working either
2009-10-29T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	thats all i can recommend
2009-10-29T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	you'll want syntax like this: gnome-terminal --command="do some command"
2009-10-29T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	is that what you have?
2009-10-29T19:45:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	no, I tried to see if it had options like that, but --help didn't list them
2009-10-29T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	see if that flys
2009-10-29T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	if you can launch it on desktop like that then it will work as a startup item
2009-10-29T19:46:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	that doesn't work either
2009-10-29T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	just worked here
2009-10-29T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	gnome-terminal --command="firefox http://www.rathergood.com"
2009-10-29T19:49:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	It opened the terminal, but it gave me an error on login that says "There was an error creating the child process for this terminal"
2009-10-29T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	strange, did the command still run?
2009-10-29T19:50:00.000Z	phreestyle-work	ActionParsnip1	no
2009-10-29T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	phreestyle-work	then i'd trouleshoot the child process creation. doesnt sound good
