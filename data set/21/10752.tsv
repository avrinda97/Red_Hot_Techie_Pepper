2005-04-12T15:21:00.000Z	gabaug		why is it so difficult to make a link from my desktop to a directory (one that happens to be on a mounted vfat partition)?
2005-04-12T15:22:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	uhh it shouldn't be hard what are you trying?
2005-04-12T15:23:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	the only way I know how in GNOME is to use the context menu option and then move the link that's created to wherever I want...
2005-04-12T15:23:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	but that's greyed out
2005-04-12T15:23:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	open a terminal cd Desktop then do ln -s /whereever NAMEOFLINK
2005-04-12T15:24:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	yeah...I know...but it's dissapointing that people uncomfortable with the cli can't do it easily
2005-04-12T15:25:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	well I can do that fine..care to ellaborate more on your issue? I.e. give me specifics and I will try it but making a link from say documents and settings is no problem through gnome on this end..
2005-04-12T15:25:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	what I really want are icons on the desktop that look like disks that will browse the mounted partitions when clicked ... like removable media except for not removable
2005-04-12T15:26:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	yah there is something f'd up in ubuntu what I do is restart dbus and they appear :)
2005-04-12T15:27:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	well I can see that some people might not like their partitions visible on their desktop...but it'd be nice if it was easily doable
2005-04-12T15:27:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	yah there is a gconf key to "show volumes" and the bastard still doesn't work correctly..
2005-04-12T15:28:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	and the lack of right-click drag support to copy, move or link kills me, even though I've been off windows 4+ yrs
2005-04-12T15:28:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	try middle
2005-04-12T15:29:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	is that what you are looking for?
2005-04-12T15:29:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	hah!!! been using GNOME for years and never knew that!
2005-04-12T15:29:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	why did they choose middle click drag and not follow MS..?
2005-04-12T15:30:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	got me
2005-04-12T15:30:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	but I recently stumpled on the middle click of doom as well and what do you know now I am sharing it :)
2005-04-12T15:30:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	of course, doing that and choosing "Make link" on the disk icons in the "Computer" nautilus window causes an "Error: Unsupported operation while linking...blahblah"
2005-04-12T15:31:00.000Z	gabaug	cowbud	anyway, thanks for the help
2005-04-12T15:33:00.000Z	cowbud	gabaug	yah sorry it wasn't a complete enlightenment :)
