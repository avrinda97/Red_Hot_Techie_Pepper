2008-02-14T20:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	acrimo	i don't know
2008-02-14T20:21:00.000Z	prince_jammys	acrimo	if you're confident in recovering, you can try.  you're gonna have to do step 3 after any changes, including if you change back
2008-02-14T20:26:00.000Z	acrimo	prince_jammys	i now see a splash screen, the bar loaded all the way to the end, now the screen is blank again
2008-02-14T20:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	acrimo	when does it go blank?
2008-02-14T20:28:00.000Z	acrimo	prince_jammys	i think the loading bar gets right to the end
2008-02-14T20:29:00.000Z	acrimo	prince_jammys	yes, it gets all the way to the end
2008-02-14T21:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	acrimo	this is after editing menu.lst and usplash.conf? was any other file changed?
2008-02-14T21:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	acrimo	i missed why you edited it
