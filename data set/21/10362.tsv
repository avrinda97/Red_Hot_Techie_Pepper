2005-04-02T12:38:00.000Z	Roey		hi
2005-04-02T12:38:00.000Z	Roey		according to this, grub won't install to raid1 partition:  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-15605.html
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	Roey		I have /, /boot and /home just like in this post http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-15605.html
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	bob2	Roey	*software* raid, important difference
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 I use sw raid.
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 and to be honest, grub is giving me the biggest freaking headache
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 I tried an initrd
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 I tried compiling kernel with builin raid and xfs
2005-04-02T12:39:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 nothing works, it keeps giving me errors.
2005-04-02T12:40:00.000Z	bob2	Roey	yes, I don't know if that's supported or not
2005-04-02T12:41:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 unfortunately for me the Zen of Debian/Grub Voodoo is not high on my priorities ;)
2005-04-02T12:41:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 thanks though
2005-04-02T12:41:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 I will switch to lilo and be done with this.
2005-04-02T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	Roey	you could just install lilo
2005-04-02T12:41:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 I had wanted to try my hand at grub :(
2005-04-02T12:42:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 do I have to do anything special to get rid of grub, or can I just install lilo over it?
2005-04-02T12:42:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 (to the mbr I mean)
2005-04-02T12:43:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 can make-kpkg work with lilo instead of grub?
2005-04-02T12:43:00.000Z	bob2	Roey	sure
2005-04-02T12:43:00.000Z	Roey	bob2	 so if I have lilo installed, dpkg -i will automatically detect it and install the kernel accordingly? nice, nice
2005-04-02T12:46:00.000Z	bob2	Roey	it's not dpkg, but the kernel-image scripts
