2006-05-25T13:06:00.000Z	Polypterus		Hi. Where can I find the plugin for xchat which will make it possible to put it in system tray?
2006-05-25T13:07:00.000Z	Polypterus		Thanks fellas! :)
2006-05-25T13:07:00.000Z	Polypterus		That was quick.
2006-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	Polypterus		Hi. I'm using amsn as IM and Thunderbird as an e-mail client. I want to be able to open up Thunderbird from amsn, what command do I add to amsn for it to work?
2006-05-25T12:40:00.000Z	Polypterus		I've tried $mozilla-thunderbird but that just opens up the hotmail web login, and I'm using gmail..
2006-05-25T12:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	mozilla-thunderbird
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	Do I have to restart amsn or something, because it didn't work?
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	I'm not sure.
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	I'm using the automatix version of thunderbird
2006-05-25T12:42:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	1.5 Mail/News
2006-05-25T12:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	Icky.
2006-05-25T12:42:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	lol, why is that?
2006-05-25T12:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	Will that command open TB from a terminal?  If so it's just an amsn thing, and then I'm lost.
2006-05-25T12:43:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	Yes it opens TB from the terminal..
2006-05-25T12:43:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	Thanks anyway though :)
2006-05-25T12:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	Maybe amsn needs the full path.
2006-05-25T12:44:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	I'll give it a go
2006-05-25T12:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	Try 'which mozilla-thunderbird' and using the output from that instead.
2006-05-25T12:46:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	Didn't work either.
2006-05-25T12:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Polypterus	Nuts.
2006-05-25T12:48:00.000Z	Polypterus	tonyyarusso	Do you use amsn? It says: $recipient = Recipient ..
