2006-03-21T10:41:00.000Z	DogWater		I just got an inspiron 6400 and I tried installing ubuntu on it and i was sad to find out that gdm doesnt work on it.
2006-03-21T10:42:00.000Z	DogWater		and I just installed ubuntu and didnt change any of the default settings
2006-03-21T10:43:00.000Z	DogWater		I was also trying to find out if anyone knows if the dell truemobile card was supported?
2006-03-21T10:43:00.000Z	DogWater		well when it starts up it tells me that GDM is disabled.. I'm a linux system administrator who has never used Linux as a desktop before.. so its kind of a funny paradigm...
2006-03-21T10:44:00.000Z	DogWater		I guess I could get by just using it in the shell.
2006-03-21T10:44:00.000Z	DogWater		but then I may as well just use windows.
2006-03-21T10:45:00.000Z	DogWater		doesnt even mention this one lol
2006-03-21T10:45:00.000Z	DogWater		guess windows it is :-)
2006-03-21T10:45:00.000Z	DogWater		945G
2006-03-21T10:45:00.000Z	DogWater		Intel
2006-03-21T10:45:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	what exact error was that with gdm again?
2006-03-21T10:46:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	don't paste it here :)
2006-03-21T10:46:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	np, just being sure :)
2006-03-21T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	Does your xorg.conf mention PCI: (0:2:1) ? the log mentions 0:2:0 as well
2006-03-21T10:54:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	lspci
2006-03-21T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	pop that new xorg.conf up on a pastebin
2006-03-21T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	the log was
2006-03-21T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	I get the wrong page with xorg.conf
2006-03-21T11:04:00.000Z	DogWater	nickrud	oh sorry, try now.
2006-03-21T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	ok, I'm paddling over my head here, I would expect 0:2:1 to be ignored, since it's not mentioned in the xorg.conf
2006-03-21T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	DogWater	if it said that, think I'd try that as my pci device in xorg.conf
