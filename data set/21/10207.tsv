2005-04-22T14:53:00.000Z	enyc		for which no information is published ro no help given to kernel developers, etc.
2005-04-22T14:53:00.000Z	enyc		ndiswrapper is a funny thing, makes sesne though
2005-04-22T14:53:00.000Z	enyc		not played with it myself ;-)
2005-04-22T14:53:00.000Z	enyc		I still need help with getting the plugdev // whatever, for pcmcia-attached-compactflash
2005-04-22T14:54:00.000Z	enyc		or whatever the gnome-plugger or whatever is called
2005-04-22T14:54:00.000Z	enyc		how odd, shouldn't do, unless something wrong with the SCSI emulation driver [?] 
2005-04-22T14:55:00.000Z	enyc		hrrrm... SCSI is better command-queueable interface etc... multitasking and dma friendly sortof commandset
2005-04-22T14:55:00.000Z	enyc		sounds like you dont' have the necessary SDL drivers etc...
2005-04-22T14:56:00.000Z	enyc		I want to know who knows what is going on with the ''automounting'' sytem provided, what is going on ?? -- which program/daemon supports attached removeable devices ??
2005-04-22T14:57:00.000Z	enyc		e.g. those flash-memory-with-usb-cntrlr-frontend-things
2005-04-22T14:57:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	hal notifies gnome-volume-manager via dbus of the attached device, and g-v-m mounts it using pmount
2005-04-22T14:58:00.000Z	enyc	mjr	dd, so where/how do I debug tis system to see which parts are seeing what ?
2005-04-22T15:00:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	hmm, might be that hal isn't exactly aware of pluggables like that
2005-04-22T15:01:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	which, of course, would be a problem. But I don't know the internals. File a hal bug for starters with that info?
2005-04-22T15:02:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	or; the kernel doesn't report that to the userspace as being a pluggable device
2005-04-22T15:03:00.000Z	enyc	mjr	hrrrrrm , well , how to do I found out that ?
2005-04-22T15:05:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	cat /sys/block/[device] /removable
2005-04-22T15:06:00.000Z	enyc	mjr	/sys/block/hde/removable: "1"
2005-04-22T15:06:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	well, at least that's ok then
2005-04-22T15:07:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	yep
2005-04-22T15:07:00.000Z	mjr	enyc	so, to my limited knowledge, the kernel side would seem to be ok; sorry, hal internals not for me, as said
