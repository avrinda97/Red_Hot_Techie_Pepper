2012-02-11T21:14:00.000Z	kaiowas		 Im wondering if someone knows if there is a "Plex Server" for Ubuntu? Or a similair program.
2012-02-11T21:16:00.000Z	kaiowas		jrib> Plex is a program that shows your video/picture collection. And if i have a Plex Server installed i can access it from all other computers in the network.. hence only one server reqiured in the network.
2012-02-11T21:16:00.000Z	kaiowas		I can also access from my jailbreaked apple tv
2012-02-11T21:18:00.000Z	kaiowas		I just installed Ubuntu and I want to learn more about it, so i thought i would try to learn by doing stuff.. Like setting up a Plex server :).
2012-02-11T21:18:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	i find this searching http://plexapp.com/linux/linux-pms-download.php
2012-02-11T21:19:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	thank you very much! I didnt find it in the ubuntu software center.. but i guess Google could have helped me with that. :).
2012-02-11T21:20:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	ubuntu will not be allowed to provide that software... the plex server
2012-02-11T21:21:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	one quick question then, maybe you can help me with this.. Im very new to Ubuntu so i have no knowledge how to edit things. It says this one the website "It's so easy! Add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list file : deb http://www.plexapp.com/repo lucid main" .. But how do i edit the file? :)
2012-02-11T21:23:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	i use sudo apt-add-repository
2012-02-11T21:24:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	from what i understand, the sudo commands make you "root" ?
2012-02-11T21:25:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	sudo allows you to act as root... you can add that line to your sources... that PPA is not supported here though... personally, i suggested "getting your feet wet" then adding that PPA at some point
2012-02-11T21:26:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	hehe okey i understand. Thanks for your help anyway.
2012-02-11T21:26:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	i can give you some commands to copy and paste, but i think a little time, and you'll know whats going on like a pro :)
2012-02-11T21:28:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	I'll give it a try myself. I just want to do this to learn, like giving myself a mission. But probably, ill be back later ;). The fastest way to learn a system is to break it ;).
2012-02-11T21:29:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	as long as you are comfortable with that :) ... gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list will allow you to edit that file
2012-02-11T21:30:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	im running parallels.. i just need to reinstall it :). But my goal is to have a computer running linux in my network.
2012-02-11T21:34:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	i tried gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and i write my password. But i get no response, am I doing it wrong?
2012-02-11T21:35:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	maybe the password was entered incorrectly... try sudo -s ...you should end up with root@whatever
2012-02-11T22:15:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	i would try and connect via IP address
2012-02-11T22:17:00.000Z	kaiowas	holstein	true, easiest way to find out :)
2012-02-11T22:19:00.000Z	holstein	kaiowas	i would just try it live...
