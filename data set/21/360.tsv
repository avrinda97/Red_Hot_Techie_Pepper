2012-02-07T05:59:00.000Z	berdario	AMS-ITGuy	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam
2012-02-07T06:01:00.000Z	berdario	AMS-ITGuy	I was about to mail my local LUG to propose to cooperate on doing such an event
2012-02-07T06:01:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	so do so
2012-02-07T06:02:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	so if they aren't, spread the word yourself.... you don't need a date to introduce others, do you?
2012-02-07T06:03:00.000Z	berdario	AMS-ITGuy	actually... I do :P I don't have much self-confidence
2012-02-07T06:03:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	what is worrying?  what does self confidence have to do with introducing others to OSS and Ubuntu?
2012-02-07T06:05:00.000Z	berdario	AMS-ITGuy	I mean that it's worryng the lack of awareness for it
2012-02-07T06:06:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	I've been using Linux since the early 90s.... Linux will find it's place.... users will find Linux - what is your concern that there is no awareness?  I don't understand?
2012-02-07T06:07:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	feedback on what?  so there is no global jam.... no one takes interest..... do you take interest?
2012-02-07T06:08:00.000Z	berdario	AMS-ITGuy	I do... and I'm prodding others to gauge the interest... now I'll drop by ubuntu+1... and next I'll try some mails
2012-02-07T06:09:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	don't convert.... educate, use the tool for the job... this isn't a religion, it's an OS
2012-02-07T06:09:00.000Z	berdario	AMS-ITGuy	I never used the word "convert"... did I gave the impression of being somewhat zealotic? :)
2012-02-07T06:09:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	i think I like linux and Ubuntu and it serves a place in my life.... i choose to help people with it.... if they choose to use Windows or Mac, that's their choice
2012-02-07T06:10:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	these aren't the droids you're looking for...
2012-02-07T06:13:00.000Z	AMS-ITGuy	berdario	that is
