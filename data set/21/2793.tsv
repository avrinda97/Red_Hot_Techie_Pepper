2009-11-25T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	copy from windows to the usb, plug the device into the ubuntu system and copy it to the place you store your files
2009-11-25T18:12:00.000Z	flaps	ActionParsnip	i KNOW, but what use is that if ubuntu cant detect exFAT

2009-11-25T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	with the current kernel, no
2009-11-25T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	if you have a lan, copy the data over that it'll be faster
2009-11-25T18:14:00.000Z	flaps	ActionParsnip	i dont. i have one computer and wantedto not use windows any more. looks like thats impossible
2009-11-25T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	just convert the usb to something both like
2009-11-25T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	like ext2 or ntfs, even fat32 will do
2009-11-25T18:16:00.000Z	flaps	ActionParsnip	so ubuntu *will* detect an ntfs usb drive?
2009-11-25T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	sure it can read and write to it too
2009-11-25T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	try access XFS under windows, aint gonna happen
2009-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	same thing
2009-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	flaps	ActionParsnip	i dont know what you mean
2009-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	windows cannot access XFS just like ubuntu cannot access exfat
2009-11-25T18:20:00.000Z	flaps	ActionParsnip	ok now im just confused. windows cant see FAT32?
2009-11-25T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flaps	yes it can. i'm just saying that not every OS can acces every file system type
