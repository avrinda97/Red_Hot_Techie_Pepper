2008-12-10T01:13:00.000Z	j0nr		evening all
2008-12-10T01:13:00.000Z	j0nr		when i create a new user and then log into their account, nothing works
2008-12-10T01:13:00.000Z	j0nr		the desktop and panels load up but nothing responds to click, except the firefox launcher, but then you cant do anything in firefox... ie. cant type any addresses in etc.
2008-12-10T01:14:00.000Z	j0nr		but my log in works fine... its just for new users
2008-12-10T01:14:00.000Z	j0nr		cant drop any of the menus down, like apps, places, system... noting responds
2008-12-10T01:14:00.000Z	j0nr		have tried creating serveral users, all do the same thing ;/
2008-12-10T01:16:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	are you creating their own folders? are you running out of space?
2008-12-10T01:16:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	i am not running out of space... they all automatically get their own directory created... have a seperate partition for /home
2008-12-10T01:18:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	what if you do ctrl+alt+f1, log in then -> startx -- :1
2008-12-10T01:19:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	ill give it a go
2008-12-10T01:22:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	hmmm errors
2008-12-10T01:22:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	if i go startx -- :1 then it says fatal error
2008-12-10T01:24:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	maybe it's because it's already logged in, see ctrl+alt+f8 f9 f10 ...
2008-12-10T01:26:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	when i go to ctrl alt f9 it flicks me into that users logged in session... what is that function?
2008-12-10T01:27:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	also, it seems to be working in there at the mo
2008-12-10T01:29:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	for me when gnome miss behaves like that, it's when there are more than on login for the same user to gnome, like vnc and freenx, but in u're case i don't know what's going on
2008-12-10T01:30:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	... than on* login ...
2008-12-10T01:30:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	... than one* login ...
2008-12-10T01:30:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	ok... but what does cntl alt f9 do? i mean it takes me to that logged in session? but why
2008-12-10T01:33:00.000Z	badawi	j0nr	it's when you switch users it gives f9
2008-12-10T01:54:00.000Z	j0nr	badawi	thanks for your help... i am unsure whats going on... but new user accounts don't work.
