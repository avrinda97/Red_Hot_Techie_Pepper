2006-01-14T07:06:00.000Z	selinium		Hi guys, I have got a folder full of files, I would like to concatanate another file onto the end of all these. Is there an easy way of doing this?
2006-01-14T07:07:00.000Z	_jason	selinium	I think: 'for $i in *; do cat foo >> $i; done' may work
2006-01-14T07:08:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	I thought something like that might. Thanks for the pointer
2006-01-14T07:08:00.000Z	_jason	selinium	well it might if you get rid of the first $, so  'for i in *; do cat foo >> $i; done'
2006-01-16T08:38:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	 ls /bin > ~/Desktop/doubletabs.txt && ls /sbin >> ~/Desktop/doubletabs.txt      :)
2006-01-16T08:40:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	I came into the middle of this one, I am not entirely sure what you are trying to do! :)
2006-01-16T08:41:00.000Z	_jason	selinium	I get the idea, thanks :)

2006-04-18T07:39:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	riomerc : Can you please stop spamming the channel with all your bot requests. Use /msg ubotu blah blah blah....
2006-04-18T07:41:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	riomerc : if you want to tell someone about something use:  /msg ubotu tell selinium about shutup   :)
2006-04-18T07:41:00.000Z	_jason	selinium	that doesn't work well because people won't know if people have been told about things already or not
2006-04-18T07:42:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	it does, try sending me the same 'tell' twice..
2006-04-18T07:42:00.000Z	_jason	selinium	yes and that means that people will waste their time typing things
2006-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	against people not getting there question 'heard' because of too much noise... :)
2006-04-18T07:45:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	Don't get me wrong, you do a great job in here! :)
2006-04-18T07:46:00.000Z	_jason	selinium	thanks, I understand where you are coming from, but I really do think it's counter-productive to has 20 people type the same /msg to ubotu when they could be working on the next question once they see someone already sent the info
2006-04-18T07:49:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	I do see your point. I see it as a typing challenge to get there first :)   It can get very noisy when three people are doing it at the same time. :)    I really do see yout point though  :)
2006-04-19T15:29:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	Oh yeah... Forgot shhd isn't running as standard!

2006-05-14T10:07:00.000Z	selinium	_jason	cheers and Hi! :)
