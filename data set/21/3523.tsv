2008-12-03T19:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		any decent placed to dl the intrepid iso that dont fail during the last minutes repeatedly
2008-12-03T19:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		I dont use torrents
2008-12-03T19:23:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	then make sure you md5 it after downloading to make sure it was done
2008-12-03T19:23:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	and maybe use a downloading client which can resume downloads in case it stops
2008-12-03T19:24:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	there are thousands of mirrors, just because one (or maybe your own connection) isn't good is a stupid reason to blame Ubuntu for having a download link on their site
2008-12-03T19:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	I have tried two different cable connections and one dsl and half a dozen sites .
2008-12-03T19:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	and it has nothing to do with ubuntu, and everything to do with the different mirror hosting sites
2008-12-03T19:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	we are offtopoic.. I choose NOT to use the torrents
2008-12-04T20:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	be very careful when giving out the force command that you include a path after it.. If yo pass the wrong thing to a beginner they wont know and can erase everything
2008-12-04T20:25:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	kk, that's why i didn't include a path behind it ;)
2008-12-04T20:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	include something like /path/filename  just so they know
2008-12-04T20:26:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	i'll keep it in mind hehe
2008-12-04T20:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	Very low tollerance for anyone writing that command unclearly or wrong..
2008-12-04T20:27:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	yeah i've noticed the op's here are quite touchy on things like that.. been trying to better myself but it's hard to keep in mind some people are really, really new to this.. i still consider myself a noob ;)
2008-12-04T20:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	and we appreciate your help in here
2008-12-04T20:28:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	just enjoying the channel, only been here 1.5 days now and feeling right at home :)
2008-12-08T18:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	what are the specs?
2008-12-08T18:51:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	it's for a laptop i got for free from a friend.. 500mhz with 256MB lol.. just use it for surfing on the couch ;)
2008-12-08T18:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	That will run ubuntu fine as long as you minimize how much ram is shared with video
2008-12-08T18:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	snek	Xubuntu would be my choice
2008-12-08T18:52:00.000Z	snek	Jack_Sparrow	i currently run debian lenny with lxde/openbox on it
