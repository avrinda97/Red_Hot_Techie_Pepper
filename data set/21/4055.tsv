2008-07-23T05:29:00.000Z	unop	MISI	can you log on ok? does this message stop you from logging on? if so, where are you seeing it?
2008-07-23T05:31:00.000Z	MISI	unop	i boot up pc, there is a loading screen and after 3 sec i get this
2008-07-23T05:31:00.000Z	unop	MISI	so this is before you enter your username and password?
2008-07-23T05:32:00.000Z	MISI	unop	yes
2008-07-23T05:32:00.000Z	unop	MISI	and that is the exact error message you get?
2008-07-23T05:33:00.000Z	MISI	unop	yes i see only this
2008-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	unop	MISI	i would reinstall grub if i were you.
2008-07-23T05:35:00.000Z	MISI	unop	ok, i will try this, thx
2008-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	MISI	unop	i get a "find: /boot/grub: No such file or directory" when i use ""find /boot/grub/stage1" at grub, any idea?
2008-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	unop	MISI	where are you now? within the live CD?
2008-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	unop	MISI	did you mount your linux partitions?
2008-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	MISI	unop	i installed in on same partiyion as windows
2008-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	unop	MISI	eh? you mean you installed linux on an ntfs partition?
2008-07-23T06:00:00.000Z	MISI	unop	yes, its bad?
2008-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	unop	MISI	yes indeed, grub does not know how to read off of ntfs partitions to get the boot images
2008-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	MISI	unop	i jusy used the option that was in the installation, so what can i do now>
2008-07-23T06:02:00.000Z	unop	MISI	the best thing to do is create a new partition with gparted, and install linux on that one
2008-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	MISI	unop	ok, i will try, i have also a qurstion, how yo uninstall that one from the ntfs partition, the wondows installer cant do it
2008-07-23T06:05:00.000Z	unop	MISI	you'll probably need to boot up into windows and delete all the linux directories from C: (or the drive letter your windows install uses)
2008-07-23T06:06:00.000Z	MISI	unop	ok, thanks for your help
