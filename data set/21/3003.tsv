2010-04-24T19:26:00.000Z	Niteshade		well i figured out how to make a root password
2010-04-24T19:26:00.000Z	Niteshade		all i did was sudo bash
2010-04-24T19:26:00.000Z	Niteshade		then passwd
2010-04-24T19:26:00.000Z	Niteshade		it's a fairly simple hack
2010-04-24T19:27:00.000Z	Niteshade		already did, but now i can't get rid of sudo.
2010-04-24T19:27:00.000Z	Niteshade		I mean, if i can sudo to root, then anybody that can get inside can too
2010-04-24T19:27:00.000Z	Niteshade		so, they only have to get my password to root my laptop
2010-04-24T19:28:00.000Z	Niteshade		anyways, i still need to be able to reconfigure my user account from another account so i can run my account
2010-04-24T19:29:00.000Z	Niteshade		but i don't know how to do that without being in my account
2010-04-24T19:29:00.000Z	Niteshade		listen...
2010-04-24T19:29:00.000Z	VCoolio	Niteshade	sudo -u <user-to-fix> gconf-editor ??
2010-04-24T19:30:00.000Z	Niteshade		i configured gnome to have tabs where it apparently doesen't like them so it locks up when i log in (a tab over top of a tab, one set to autohide)
2010-04-24T19:30:00.000Z	Niteshade		i have to ctrl-alt-f1, then log in, and then go "shutdown now" and try again
2010-04-24T19:31:00.000Z	Niteshade		it did
2010-04-24T19:31:00.000Z	Niteshade		got fglrx working fine
2010-04-24T19:31:00.000Z	Niteshade	look	if it was something deeper then this account i'm chatting from wouldn't work either
2010-04-24T19:32:00.000Z	Niteshade		so, how do i move and delete panels and icons in another account when not in that account?
2010-04-24T19:33:00.000Z	Niteshade		thanks!
2010-04-24T19:37:00.000Z	Niteshade		so, do you have to be logged in to that account to reset panels?
2010-04-24T19:37:00.000Z	Niteshade		or will it do that everywhere?
2010-04-24T19:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	Niteshade	you'll need to be that user, or try sudo -u thatuser command
