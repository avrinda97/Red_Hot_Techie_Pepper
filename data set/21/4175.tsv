2008-06-21T07:26:00.000Z	mynetdude		errr /home/bigiron
2008-06-21T07:27:00.000Z	mynetdude		I'm trying to move the java 6u6 JRE runtime from my home folder to the /usr/lib/jvm
2008-06-21T07:27:00.000Z	mynetdude		I even tried to do it via the GUI, and I get a permission denied so... this is really starting to not work out very well
2008-06-21T07:28:00.000Z	mynetdude		I really wish I could just copy/move as I please in GUI
2008-06-21T07:28:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	are you trying to move a folder?
2008-06-21T07:28:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	are you using a GUI based file manager>?
2008-06-21T07:29:00.000Z	mynetdude	webcamwonder	I guess? I'm using places>computer>filesystem>folder
2008-06-21T07:29:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	press alt+f2
2008-06-21T07:29:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	type in gksu nautilus
2008-06-21T07:29:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	and key in your password, and move to the location of /bin
2008-06-21T07:29:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	nautlius can explore your files and folders on the hdd
2008-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	You do have the privilages
2008-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	It was just that you had not passed the privileges to the application you were running
2008-06-21T07:34:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	make sure you put sudo before that
2008-06-21T07:34:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	that would give the rights necessaryu
2008-06-21T07:34:00.000Z	mynetdude	webcamwonder	yeah I had to do sudo to make the folder to begin with
2008-06-21T07:37:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	you only need to gksu nautlius if you are essentially moving "system files"
2008-06-21T08:59:00.000Z	mynetdude	webcamwonder	cool... I could have thought of that
2008-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	webcamwonder	mynetdude	did you try to winetrick .net packages?
