2012-07-19T06:40:00.000Z	Chamunks		would there be a clean and tidy way to make sure that if i install gnome-shell that I can go back to unity cleanly without having issues?
2012-07-19T06:41:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	Shouldn't be a problem
2012-07-19T06:42:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	apt-get install gnome-shell gnome-themes-standard nome-backgrounds gnome-icon-theme gnome-tweak-tool  #For a classic gnome experience
2012-07-19T07:07:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	I'm looking to see if fglrx still doesn
2012-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	doesn't play well with fglrx or if that disaster has been fully fixed.
2012-07-19T07:15:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	What?
2012-07-19T07:17:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2012-07-19T07:20:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	I'm just looking for a pure gnome3 gnome shell experience hopefully mostly bug free that wont faceplant with fglrx
2012-07-19T07:20:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	 so should i install all those extras you mentioned?
2012-07-19T07:21:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	apt-get install gnome-shell gnome-themes-standard nome-backgrounds gnome-icon-theme gnome-tweak-tool
2012-07-19T07:23:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	So did you do it?  If so, configure it to your liking
2012-07-19T07:24:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	Actually, to me, it's easier to just do:  sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2012-07-19T07:26:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	http://www.ntlug.org/Articles/CustomizeUbuntu
2012-07-19T07:29:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	I can run that you just made it seem something about those packages was gonna give me more of a mate desktop feel.
2012-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	but if not I'm on it :)
2012-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	Have you ever tried xfce on ubuntu?
2012-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	Or xubuntu ???
2012-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	i've got quite a bit of power under my hood so i've been using more gdm stuff than the light desktop managers
2012-07-19T07:32:00.000Z	usr13	Chamunks	I'm just not talking light, I'm talking efficient and user friendly and effective.  thunar is an awsome file manager.  Ask in #xfce
2012-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	fair I'll give it a shot if you drop me some reading.
2012-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	Chamunks	usr13	i got used to gnome3 ish environment when i was on mint for a while because ubuntu wasnt fixing the fglrx issue with gnome3
