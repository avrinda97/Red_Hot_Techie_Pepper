2006-06-03T06:23:00.000Z	Shaezsche		i currently have my entire HD paritioned to ntfs with windows XP installed on it. I intend to boot the liveCD ubuntu and resize my current HD parition so i have at least 30 gigs available for an ext3 ubuntu parition. Then install Ubuntu on that ext3 partition. When i reboot my computer what will happen? will it boot BOTH operating systems, or give me a choice?
2006-06-03T06:23:00.000Z	Shaezsche		there you go
2006-06-03T06:24:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	you have have a menu from grub (to choose your OS to boot)
2006-06-03T06:50:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	usually asus supports linux well , but modem is always hard
2006-06-03T06:51:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	they offer NO linux drivers
2006-06-03T06:51:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	what's the modem ?
2006-06-03T06:51:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	I heard it may work with the alsa-pci modem driver and slmodem
2006-06-03T06:53:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	alsa driver is in kernel
2006-06-03T06:56:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	just test whether it works with the alsa driver + slmodem
2006-06-03T06:56:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	it does not
2006-06-03T06:57:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	because ubuntu does not even recognize it
2006-06-03T06:57:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	how difficult is that?  modprobe, and apt-get install
2006-06-03T06:57:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	what is the exact command? im very new to linux "apt-get install _____"
2006-06-03T06:58:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	" sudo modprobe snd_intel8x0m ; sudo apt-get install slmodem "
2006-06-03T06:59:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	do i need to be connected to do that? i dont have high speed available
2006-06-03T07:05:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	which one of these device ID's belongs to my modem? http://www.pcidatabase.com/search.php?device_search_str=82801FB
2006-06-03T07:07:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	try " scanpci -v " or " lspci -v "
2006-07-28T05:09:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	no, no need to run protection, just don't run any service
2006-07-28T05:10:00.000Z	Shaezsche	dli	its not me, my mother might run a service that she shouldnt
2006-07-28T05:12:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	however, it's still a good idea to install bastille + psad , very easy to setup by answering questions. sudo apt-get install bastille psad
2006-07-28T05:13:00.000Z	dli	Shaezsche	just install on hdd, don't install any service, install bastille + psad, turn off auto-updating
