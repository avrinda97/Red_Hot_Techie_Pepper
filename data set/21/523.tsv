2011-12-03T22:19:00.000Z	hrolf		How do I access a Windows share in Linux/Ubuntu?
2011-12-03T22:20:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	try and open nautilus the file browser and type in //ipaddressofwindows/sharename
2011-12-03T22:23:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	It says couldn't find please check spelling
2011-12-03T22:25:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	sorry forgot the smb:// at the beginning. smb://ipaddress/share
2011-12-03T23:41:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	so the usermod command is usermod -a -G group user
2011-12-03T23:42:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	Yes that's what I typed in.
2011-12-03T23:42:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	Sorry I forgot it, here is what I did "sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers <myUser>
2011-12-03T23:43:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	im not sure what the usermod command has to do with not getting a gui. what runlevel are you at?
2011-12-03T23:43:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	What is runlevel?
2011-12-03T23:43:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	`runlevel`
2011-12-03T23:44:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	Should I run it?
2011-12-03T23:44:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	yes. it will tell you the current init runlevel
2011-12-03T23:44:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	I'll need to exit my irssi to use it.
2011-12-03T23:44:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	I'll get back to you
2011-12-03T23:44:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	ctrl-alt-f2
2011-12-03T23:49:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	I'm at runlevel N 2
2011-12-03T23:49:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	I did groups and I'm a member of about 8 groups
2011-12-03T23:51:00.000Z	escott	hrolf	all that sounds normal. try service lightdm start
2011-12-03T23:52:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	I think I know the cause now
2011-12-03T23:52:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	I ran the autorun.sh which comes with the VirtualBox Guest Addition.iso
2011-12-04T00:42:00.000Z	hrolf	escott	Thanks for helping I went to #vbox and they said simply uninstall what I had installed (VBoxLinuxAdditions) and now I'm back to normal. The GUI is up
