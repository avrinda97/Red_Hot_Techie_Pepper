2008-04-18T01:46:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	what does this give you?  which firefox; type -a firefox
2008-04-18T01:48:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	does firefox launch when you do this?   /opt/firefox/firefox
2008-04-18T01:48:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	ls -ld /opt/  - if it's more than 2 lines use a pastebin
2008-04-18T01:49:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	actually, just do.   find /opt   - and use a !pastebin
2008-04-18T01:50:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	that has no bearing on what i am asking you now, does it?
2008-04-18T01:51:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	it looks to me that you didn't manage to successfully extract the firefox package to /opt - repeat step #3 from http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63577/
2008-04-18T01:51:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	and then run.  /opt/firefox/firefox   again, see what happens
2008-04-18T01:53:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	please put on a pastebin the output of   find /opt.
2008-04-18T01:53:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	err sorry,  find /opt./
2008-04-18T01:53:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	bahh, sorry again.  find /opt/
2008-04-18T02:04:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	here, follow this.  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63584/   # if you run into trouble, include all the output in another paste
2008-04-18T01:54:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	it'd also be helpful if you included the command and output of step #3
2008-04-18T01:54:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	link?
2008-04-18T01:56:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	nope, firefox wasn't extracted to that directory - step #3 from http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63577/ is   sudo tar -C /opt -jxvf firefox-3.0b2.tar.bz2
2008-04-18T01:57:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	pay attention to what the commands return to you, they contain vital information on what is being done -- run this command again, see what is returned to you
2008-04-18T01:58:00.000Z	buckie	unop_	yes - it tell me bad stuff for sure :(
2008-04-18T01:58:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	put that in a !pastebin
2008-04-18T01:58:00.000Z	buckie	unop_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63583/
2008-04-18T02:02:00.000Z	buckie	unop_	does the pastebin make any sense ?
2008-04-18T02:02:00.000Z	unop_	buckie	hold on
2008-04-18T02:05:00.000Z	buckie	unop_	ok thanks a milion :) I hope i wont run into anymore trouble
