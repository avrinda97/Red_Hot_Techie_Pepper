2007-07-08T08:43:00.000Z	thechris		see, thats exactly why i like gentoo over ubunutu.
2007-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	what is?
2007-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	it saves time
2007-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	lol surely that's not the biggest difference you find in between gentoo and ubuntu? ;)
2007-07-08T08:46:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	no, i do have other differences.  in gentoo things take forever to compile, but end up working.  in ubuntu, things quickly install and don't work, leaving you to try to find help on IRC with a bunch of people scanning messages for keywords to !help with.
2007-07-08T08:47:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	see, and here you were saying the !keywords was the only difference :P
2007-07-08T08:47:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	would you find it better if we were to type the exact same lines over and over again instead of having the bot do it?
2007-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	yes.  because maybe then people would ask what the problem is instead of seeing a keyword and appending ! to it.
2007-07-08T08:50:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	if the !keyword doesn't fix it, the person gets helped further without keywords
2007-07-08T08:50:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	so I do feel you're being difficult for no apparent reason here :] 
2007-07-08T08:53:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	there isn't one, hence you don't get helped with one... isn't that excellent? (was that a serious question by the way?)
2007-07-08T08:53:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	yes, one of my 3 questions
2007-07-08T08:55:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	hmm.  well, i've installed the codecs per !codecs or such.
2007-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	are you on KDE?
2007-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	in gentoo, yes.  and in ubunut as well.
2007-07-08T08:57:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	I know very little about k3b, you could also try #kubuntu for that
2007-07-08T08:58:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	did you try different software?
2007-07-08T08:58:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	k3b works in gentoo.  so yes.
2007-07-08T08:58:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	did you try different software in the same environment (kubuntu)?
2007-07-08T08:59:00.000Z	thechris	banlieue	no.  k3b is my prefered application.
2007-07-08T08:59:00.000Z	banlieue	thechris	you should try different software to see if that would work
