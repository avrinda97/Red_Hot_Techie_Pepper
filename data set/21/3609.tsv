2009-12-09T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	should be fine
2010-01-23T21:24:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	you mean you want to change the way ubuntu is distributed?
2010-01-23T21:25:00.000Z	needhelp1	jrib	yeah
2010-05-03T08:48:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	depends /how/ you installed it.  Usually, you have to read the documentation.
2010-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	needhelp1	jrib	i installed thunderbird with ..
2010-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	".."?

2010-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	follow the directions in reverse
2010-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	needhelp1	jrib	wont
2010-05-03T08:55:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	I don't mean literally.  I mean read what you did and undo it
2010-05-03T08:57:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	hint: you copied files to some directory, then you created a menu item for it.  So undo those two things....
2010-10-31T14:32:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	adding a key to your apt keyring.  Basically, you're telling apt to trust software that's signed with that key
2010-10-31T14:34:00.000Z	needhelp1	jrib	im attempting to install mongodb .. im not sure if i should trust the software though .. lol
2010-10-31T14:35:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	isn't mongodb in the default repositories?
2011-02-11T04:24:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	same way you installed them.  Use System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers
2011-02-11T04:33:00.000Z	needhelp1	jrib	 schnuffle that worked thanks :)
2011-03-02T21:54:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp1	only thing to note is that if you have files with the same name, they will be overwritten
2011-03-02T21:54:00.000Z	needhelp1	jrib	yeah i do, i probably have hundreds, it is what it is though
