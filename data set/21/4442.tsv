2008-04-26T03:34:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	i don't want to burn a cd :P
2008-04-26T03:35:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	What Version Of Ubuntu do you have?
2008-04-26T03:35:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	7.10
2008-04-26T03:35:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	go to System--Administration--Update Manager
2008-04-26T03:36:00.000Z	KooperKool		I dont think HDA is good on Hardy
2008-04-26T03:36:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	yeah, and then?
2008-04-26T03:36:00.000Z	KooperKool		Click the Check Button
2008-04-26T03:37:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	Click the check button
2008-04-26T03:37:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	ok
2008-04-26T03:37:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	when its done, at the top it should say "A New OS is avaible" Or somthing like that
2008-04-26T03:38:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	it says it already actually xD
2008-04-26T03:38:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	but it doesn't attempt to get it from the CD i don't think
2008-04-26T03:38:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	The 8.04 installation files aren't on a CD unless you downloaded the cd ISO
2008-04-26T03:39:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	i have the ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso mounted so
2008-04-26T03:39:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	oh! Why didn't you say so. Just burn it to A CD, then boot to it.
2008-04-26T03:40:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	lol, but i don't want to burn =/ i don't have any CDs
2008-04-26T03:41:00.000Z	KooperKool	DaveG|	Then you have to update from the update manager or go out and buy some CD-Rs.
2008-04-26T03:41:00.000Z	KooperKool		The built in one
2008-04-26T03:41:00.000Z	DaveG|	KooperKool	=/
