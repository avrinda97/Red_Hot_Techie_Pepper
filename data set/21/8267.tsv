2010-06-18T01:03:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 Heebie he says he can ping localhost, the iface is up
2010-06-18T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	localhost will ping lo
2010-06-25T16:19:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	his dns does not have to be in /etc/hosts
2010-06-25T16:20:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 no, but dns hits that before reslov.conf. so just a failsafe of sorts
2010-06-25T16:20:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	not at all
2010-06-25T16:20:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	DNS servers are referenced by IP - so adding them to /etc/hosts will do nothing
2010-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 yes, dns queries hit /etc/hosts before /etc/resolv.conf. it is true
2010-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	/etc/hosts should not be used to populate DNS domains
2010-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 agreed. that is not my point
2010-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	he wants to use his dns server - that's where he should be querying, not putting dns entries in /etc/hosts
2010-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	then don't tell someone to put dns entries in /etc/hosts
2010-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 I didn't. I said put ip/hostname mapping sthere
2010-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	that makes no difference
2010-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 yes it does
2010-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	the DNS servers are referenced by IP's not names, so putting the names/ip's in /etc/hosts makes no difference
2010-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	no it doesn't
2010-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	resolve.conf should contain IP's not names
2010-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 research the life of a dns query
2010-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	I'm aware of how dns works
2010-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	AAA	ikonia	 I don't belive you
2010-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	AAA	don't care if you do
