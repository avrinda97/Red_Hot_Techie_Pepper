2007-03-12T14:49:00.000Z	blurpie		hey, ubuntu 6.10 auto clears thumbnail files, right? because i'm trying to make it not clear the thumbnails in a specific folder.. anyone have any thoughts on that?
2007-03-12T14:50:00.000Z	jrib	blurpie	I didn't know it did, how are you testing?
2007-03-12T14:51:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	well.. my google searches suggest otherwise, but every so often it has to reload the thumbnails here.. my guess was that it had a file size limit, after which it would clear the thumbnails?
2007-03-12T14:51:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	so i'm observing this by it reloading the thumbnails every so often in specific folders i'm 100% sure already loaded thumbnails before
2007-03-12T14:52:00.000Z	blurpie		gnome by the way
2007-03-12T14:53:00.000Z	jrib	blurpie	hmm, maybe the freedesktop.org thumbnail spec mentions something?  All I know about thumbnails is that they go to ~/.thumbnails/
2007-03-12T14:54:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	yea i did check ~/.thumbnails/, seems to be filling fine :/
2007-03-12T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	blurpie	you check timestamps?
2007-03-12T14:55:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	by the way.. it's a bad idea to open your ~/.thumbnails/normal/ ;P
2007-03-12T14:55:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	just had to force close my folder :P
2007-03-12T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	blurpie	what's the size of yours?
2007-03-12T14:55:00.000Z	blurpie		lemme check
2007-03-12T14:56:00.000Z	blurpie		hm... 83.3MB.. there goes my theory
2007-03-12T14:56:00.000Z	blurpie		I'm quite confused as to why it sometimes has to reload thumbnails, now
2007-03-12T14:57:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	i might have renamed the folder without my remembering.. that'd mean i would've wasted not only my own time but also yours
2007-03-12T14:58:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	although I do doubt I renamed the folder, I can't seem to recreate this at the moment
2007-03-12T14:58:00.000Z	blurpie		I guess i'll just keep an eye out for it and come back later if it happens again
2007-03-12T14:58:00.000Z	jrib	blurpie	from a quick glance at the spec, I see a mention that it will detect modifications (uses mtime) and regerate
2007-03-12T14:59:00.000Z	blurpie		ah
2007-03-12T14:59:00.000Z	blurpie		that's interesting
2007-03-12T15:01:00.000Z	blurpie	jrib	kind of odd there's no auto-clear of thumbnails actually.. i'd imagine that folder to be very big soon
