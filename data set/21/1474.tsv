2010-09-17T05:14:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	yes
2010-09-17T05:14:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	the reason i am reinstallin is my previous installation is not booting now
2010-09-17T05:14:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	understood
2010-09-17T05:15:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 so you check the cd for errors on both       live and alternate cd... and they are error free ...yes?
2010-09-17T05:15:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	yes I did that, also checked the memory and it is also fine
2010-09-17T05:16:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 and you say current install is not booting... did you check if the hard drive is actually working ?
2010-09-17T05:16:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	did a test of it on my bios and it passed the test
2010-09-17T05:17:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 what concerns  me is that your current install is not booting and the live and alternate cd's are not seeing the hard drive
2010-09-17T05:17:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 this is suspicious  and i would be concerned about the hard drive integrity at this point
2010-09-17T05:18:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	so what do  u suggest should be done, and how did my bios detect and pass the hard disc as functionin propely
2010-09-17T05:18:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 do you have an   unused or extra drive to test this
2010-09-17T05:18:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	no
2010-09-17T05:18:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 mm  and ubuntu is the only operating system on the drive?
2010-09-17T05:18:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	yes ubuntu is the only one. also why should live cd installation have anything to do with my hard disc
2010-09-17T05:19:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 when you boot into the live cd... did you hit enter  when the small keyboard image at the bottom of the screen comes on... which I guess you did since you tested cd... and it still wont boot onto the live cd?/
2010-09-17T05:20:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	yes i did that and it still didnt boot
2010-09-17T05:20:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	out of curiosity...have you been "inside" the case recently?
2010-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	  I would open the case..make sure all cables are securely attached... including hard drive and cdrom... then reboot the system with live cd... while in there check to see if any  of the capacitors have blown... because at this point ,,,, I personally would be checking hardware components to be sure they are attached and workding
2010-09-17T05:23:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 unless this is a lapttop that is
2010-09-17T05:23:00.000Z	wasnik	coz_	I havent been inside the case, but what i am curious about is how come the bios is detecin the hardisk also why should hard disk erro come up on live boot. yes its a laptop
2010-09-17T05:24:00.000Z	coz_	wasnik	 i agree about the bios ... however.. it is clear that not only  is the current install not booting but neither will live cd which is not dependent on hard drive... so something is off kilter here
