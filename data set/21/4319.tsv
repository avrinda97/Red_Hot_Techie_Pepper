2009-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	wad		I don't want to run Vista, I have work to do. Win XP is just so I can play games with my kids.
2009-02-27T03:31:00.000Z	wad		Dell? This is a lenovo T500. There is no dell here.
2009-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	wad		Well, dmesg doesn't help me much. I rebotted it again, still nothing.
2009-02-27T03:33:00.000Z	wad		It finished, and the first thing it wanted to do was download and install some updates. Now gnome is hosed.
2009-02-27T03:33:00.000Z	wad		No, I can log in via the console... but there is no X running that I can seem to get to.
2009-02-27T03:33:00.000Z	wad		During boot up, it shows a useless progress bar.
2009-02-27T03:33:00.000Z	wad		I can turn that off in grub, can't I?
2009-02-27T03:35:00.000Z	wad		lst, rather
2009-02-27T03:35:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	let's consider reinstalling the OS
2009-02-27T03:26:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	is a new install appropriate?
2009-02-27T03:29:00.000Z	wad	linux_guy	is a new install appropriate? The laptop came with Vista. First thing I did was install XP on a little piece of the drive, then Ubuntu on the rest.
2009-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	youre not going to be able to run xp very easily
2009-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	your hardware is newer than your OS and drivers will be a PITA
2009-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	wad	linux_guy	why do you say that? It runs just fine, when I choose it from grub...
2009-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	wad	linux_guy	heh, well, I don't care much.
2009-02-27T03:30:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	in my personal experience with dell
2009-02-27T03:31:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	i had vista problems on MY Dell
2009-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	so i went to xp
2009-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	at which point drivers became hell
2009-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	so now i'm all ubuntu =)
2009-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	linux_guy	wad	consider ubuntu as primare and maybe vmware?
