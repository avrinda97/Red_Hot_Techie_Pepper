2010-04-08T18:44:00.000Z	theadmin		mneptok: What was that? What did he do wrong?
2010-04-08T18:45:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	He ban evaded?
2010-05-04T15:47:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	Took one hour here. ;)
2010-05-17T13:01:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	wtf? You don't do that; you do sudo service apache2 start ;)
2010-06-07T14:36:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	Well, yeah; you don't want random users to sniff traffic. :)

2011-08-07T13:18:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	Who's lazy now?
2011-08-07T13:18:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	There's a ton of unfixed bugs I bet :P
2011-08-07T13:19:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	That's true for every software package.
2011-08-24T19:42:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	I wouldn't be too sure about that.
2011-08-24T19:42:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	About... what, exactly?
2012-05-09T20:50:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	Confirmed: http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso - Chromium says "701MB".
2012-08-07T14:48:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	Uh, yes it is. Kubuntu isn't. Or did they change something again?
2012-08-07T14:48:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	Lubuntu never was supported by Canonical.
2012-08-07T14:54:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	"Lubuntu 11.10 is the first version of Lubuntu with official sanction as a member of the Ubuntu family." -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubuntu
2012-08-07T14:55:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	That means that it's community supported, not commerically supported by Canonical.
2012-08-07T14:55:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	Just as there are other members of the Ubuntu family.
2012-08-07T14:56:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	I see... Well, I don't really understand it, and I don't seriously think support from Canonical matters all that much long as the community support exists.
2012-08-07T14:56:00.000Z	jpds	theadmin	Tell that to an entreprise. ;)
2012-08-07T14:57:00.000Z	theadmin	jpds	Heh
