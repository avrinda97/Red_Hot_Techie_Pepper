2006-01-02T06:37:00.000Z	tjb13		so does anyone know how to get sleep working
2006-01-02T06:38:00.000Z	tjb13		and closing the lid or hitting the sleep sequence does nothing
2006-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	what version are you using?
2006-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	tjb13	cdubya	is that what you meant
2006-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	yes. http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_5.04_on_a_ThinkPad_T43_(1875)
2006-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	it's for hoary, so I'm not sure about all the accuracies.
2006-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	tjb13	cdubya	there is the laptop testing team thing
2006-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	I don't use sleep, so I won't be much help, sorry
2006-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	just found that on a quick look
2006-01-02T06:43:00.000Z	tjb13	cdubya	it says yes it is supported after sleep is enabled
2006-01-02T06:43:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	that was my understanding.
2006-01-02T06:43:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	I've looked at that site before.....but the ACPI setting had to be set to sleep
2006-01-02T06:45:00.000Z	tjb13	cdubya	what does tha tmean
2006-01-02T06:47:00.000Z	cdubya	tjb13	look at the enable sleep and hibernation section on that site....
