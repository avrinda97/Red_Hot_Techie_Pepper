2009-08-01T15:28:00.000Z	antonio_		would someone help me with ati driver o ubuntu 8.10^
2009-08-01T15:29:00.000Z	antonio_		I have an ati radeon 9200SE
2009-08-01T15:29:00.000Z	antonio_		at present it is working but I have OpenGL vendor string: Tungsten Graphics, Inc.
2009-08-01T15:30:00.000Z	antonio_		while it should be ati...,
2009-08-01T15:31:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	Some drivers are notorious for having different server and client vendor strings, is the client vendor string also Tungsten?
2009-08-01T15:35:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	You probably didn't follow the instructions quite right then -- they look correct, but I had to use Google Translator to read them :)
2009-08-01T15:35:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	Are you trying to use fglrx (the proprietary Catalyst driver) or the open source ati driver?
2009-08-01T15:37:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	have you tried any 3d applications to see if they work?
2009-08-01T15:38:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	The open source ati drivers are based on the DRM/DRI/Xorg/Mesa stack which does have Tungsten as the vendor, at least for some drivers
2009-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	If you need more featureful OpenGL then try the proprietary drivers if you're ok with using non-free software
2009-08-01T15:44:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	That sounds about right
2009-08-01T15:44:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	(haha, I really have no clue)
2009-08-01T15:44:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	Try a 3d app like TuxRacer
2009-08-01T15:48:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	upgrading might overwrite your settings, depending on the choices you make during the upgrade process
2009-08-01T15:49:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	I would suggest that you back up any configuration files you hand-modified for your usb modem before you upgrade.
2009-08-01T15:49:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	that way if the upgrade process overwrites anything you can put it back where it was
2009-08-01T15:51:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	Hard to say, it depends on what you modified - but I personally use a USB EvDO tethering to my cellphone and it's been pretty consistent across versions. It just uses wvdial and pppd
2009-08-01T15:53:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	Upgrading to 9.04 won't raise the system requirements significantly, if 8.10 works then 9.04 should
2009-08-01T15:53:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	With the system specs you've stated I think you are fine, unless you have 256 MB of RAM
2009-08-01T15:55:00.000Z	allquixotic	antonio_	it's morning for me, and you have a nice day too
