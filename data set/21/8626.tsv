2008-09-29T01:01:00.000Z	airtonix		hi evolution wont connect to gmail, any ideas?
2008-09-29T01:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	Mine works fine. Make sure that the pop server is set to use SSL and that the smtp server is set for TLS.
2008-09-29T01:03:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	nope doesnt work....wont accept my username and password despite having enabled pop access in gmail
2008-09-29T01:04:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	What are your server addresses?
2008-09-29T01:05:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	pop: pop.gmail.com smtp : smtp.gmail.com
2008-09-29T01:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	and it still doesn't work with Pop on SSl (port 995) and SMTP on TLS (587, I thin).
2008-09-29T01:07:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	mmhmm....keeps telling me my password is wrong when i know its not
2008-09-29T01:07:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	but balsa just recieved an email from gmail....go figure?
2008-09-29T01:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	That is odd, because I use Gmail with Evolution on my laptop and it's just fine.
2008-09-29T01:09:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	i've always hated evolution's bloat....
2008-09-29T01:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	Have you ever tried Thunderbird?
2008-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	yes and i consider it to also be bloat ware
2008-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	balse wont send to gmail either
2008-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	infact it pops up a notifcation saying authnetication required and gives launchpad address
2008-09-29T01:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	Well, bloatware or not, Thunderbird does autoconfigure Gmail now.
2008-09-29T01:12:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	but its just simple settings...why doesnt evolution or balsa work when previousl in feisty *all* mails clients had no problems
2008-09-29T01:13:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	I don't know if Google or Ubuntu is to blame for that. I'm willing to agree that (especially for the second LTS release) Hardy has not been the community's best work.
2008-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	this is the first thing about hardy thats not worked for me
2008-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	nvm iwas using incorrect username
2008-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	airtonix	bobertdos	sigh...lol
2008-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	airtonix	:p
