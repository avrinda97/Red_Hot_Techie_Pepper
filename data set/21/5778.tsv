2008-04-21T09:20:00.000Z	guest___		hello
2008-04-21T09:21:00.000Z	guest___		i need some help ... http://images.torrentmove.com/show.php?id=66e7457680f9a765dbaf05a552b36a2d
2008-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	guest___		i can't mount ntfs partition which installed windows
2008-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	Reboot into Windows.  Run a full diskcheck on those volumes and then get back into Ubuntu.
2008-04-21T09:22:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	It appears you were using Windows when a power failure occurred.  Windows locks NTFS volumes in such a scenario.
2008-04-21T09:23:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	Rebooting into Windows, running a disk check and booting back into Ubuntu should fix it.
2008-04-21T09:23:00.000Z	guest___	jburd	: i can't get into windows mode ... or even save mode
2008-04-21T09:23:00.000Z	guest___		i mean...windows must be corrupts
2008-04-21T09:24:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	That's not news to me.  Windows does not read its own file system way too many times.  I've had to recover client data using Linux and ntfs-3g.
2008-04-21T09:24:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	You can force mount NTFS partitions though.  No guarantees there.
2008-04-21T09:24:00.000Z	guest___		<drivetrax --- no sir
2008-04-21T09:25:00.000Z	guest___		<jburd> --- i already force to mount that partition
2008-04-21T09:25:00.000Z	guest___		but it doesn't work
2008-04-21T09:25:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	When you try to load Windows, what error message do you see?
2008-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	guest___		<jburd> some file system couldn't read
2008-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	Can you get the exact error message?
2008-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	guest___		<jburd> when windows is starting ... it just reboot
2008-04-21T09:27:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	I'd suggest a better strategy for storing your personal data.  Don't store it in the same partition as the Windows installation.  Use a separate partition so even when you lose the OS, you can still recover data.
2008-04-21T09:27:00.000Z	guest___		<jburd> i'll reinstall windows then let you know again later
2008-04-21T09:28:00.000Z	jburd	guest___	read about restoring Grub back to the MBR before you do that.
