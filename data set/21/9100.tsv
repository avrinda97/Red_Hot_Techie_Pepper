2008-03-30T01:46:00.000Z	fyrmedic		Is there a room for 64bit or is this it?
2008-03-30T01:47:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	you can ask here
2008-03-30T01:49:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	is it a Turion X2?
2008-03-30T01:53:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	run 'uname -a'. If it contains x86_64, you're on 64bit
2008-03-30T02:13:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	what makes you think there should be two cores on your CPU?
2008-03-30T02:16:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	do you read me at all?
2008-03-30T02:16:00.000Z	fyrmedic	soundray	I believe that the turion64 processors are dual core aren't they?
2008-03-30T02:17:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	not all of them
2008-03-30T02:17:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	only those designated as Turion X2
2008-03-30T02:17:00.000Z	fyrmedic	soundray	lspci right?
2008-03-30T02:17:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	no
2008-03-30T02:18:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor' -- how many lines?
2008-03-30T02:20:00.000Z	fyrmedic	soundray	looks like 1
2008-03-30T02:20:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	you have a single-core Turion
2008-03-30T02:20:00.000Z	fyrmedic	soundray	you too
2008-03-30T02:21:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	my wife does
2008-03-30T02:22:00.000Z	fyrmedic	soundray	Oh ok. I guess that fixes that problem. So it really won't make a lot of difference if I am running 64bit or 32bit.
2008-03-30T02:22:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	it does if you have more than 3GB of memory
2008-03-30T02:23:00.000Z	fyrmedic	soundray	Well I believe that I installed 64 but don't remember for sure. And I dont have that much ram. Besides it's my wifes computer. I am off to fix the next bugger.
2008-03-30T02:24:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	I told you how to check whether you have amd64 installed
2008-03-30T02:24:00.000Z	soundray	fyrmedic	'uname -a' and look out for x86_64 in the string
