2006-07-07T14:03:00.000Z	yango	swadhin	provide more info... such as when did it happen, can you log on to the machine to see logs, etc.
2006-07-07T14:12:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	, any thoughts
2006-07-07T14:13:00.000Z	yango	swadhin	messages, Xorg (you're using X, no?), udev, dmesg
2006-07-07T14:15:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	yes i am using X
2006-07-07T14:22:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	how to use these
2006-07-07T14:23:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	Xorg gives an error msg saying that server already running at 0
2006-07-07T14:28:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	i got some message from dmesg "input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
2006-07-07T14:29:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	and "mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice"
2006-07-07T14:30:00.000Z	yango	swadhin	have you tried dpkg-reconfigure Xorg ?
2006-07-07T14:30:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	no
2006-07-07T14:30:00.000Z	yango	swadhin	do mice and keyboard work in non-X environment (pressing ctrl-alt-F1)
2006-07-07T14:32:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	i am not able to press ctrl-alt-F1
2006-07-07T14:32:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	since the keyboard is not working
2006-07-07T14:32:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	i tried with the recovery mode
2006-07-07T14:32:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	even that is not working
2006-07-07T15:29:00.000Z	swadhin	yango	no success
