2009-11-23T11:56:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	just a min ill get a link
2009-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- thanks
2009-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2009-11-23T11:58:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	this is the package info. w64codecs
2009-11-23T12:03:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- I added the medibuntu repository...so I should install w64codecs ?? Is that the same as restricted extras?
2009-11-23T12:03:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	yes
2009-11-23T12:08:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- ubuntuguide.org says that Restricted Extras installs Flash, Java, Firefox Plugins, Microsoft Fonts, mp3 encoding, FFMpeg, Gstreamer extras, etc, and w32 or w64codecs. What I want to do is make SURE that i get the 64 bit codecs/extras/plugins. Do you know a way I can do this?
2009-11-23T12:09:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- I mean, do you know how I can be sure I'm getting 64 bit codecs and plugins?
2009-11-23T12:10:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- maybe I should just install these extras individually, eh? What do you think?
2009-11-23T12:12:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	well the x64 package from medibuntu covers just about everything and there is also the non-free-codecs package. you will have to forgive me as im getting a little bit lost now s to what you are exactly looking to do as those 2 package cover everyyhing
2009-11-23T12:15:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- I just don't want to install two packages that conflict if they both contain the same codecs/plugins
2009-11-23T12:16:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	i understand what ur saying. if that is the case just install the codecs as you need them. thats probally your best bet because now that you mention it im having a bit of a clashing problem with a few codecs
2009-11-23T12:16:00.000Z	agorist	McLovin	- Ok
2009-11-23T12:18:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	at first i was under the impression that you just needed them all and you would of sorted it out laster. my bad. but there is a good thing about adding medibuntu to the list. there is a hot babe stripper cpu temp gauage on there lol
2009-11-23T12:31:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	dept will read the kernel and only update based on the arc of the system
2009-11-23T12:32:00.000Z	McLovin	agorist	* adept i cant spell tonight
