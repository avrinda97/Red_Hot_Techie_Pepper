2010-03-04T03:54:00.000Z	xenocampanoli		Man, it really has admin on my two machines at a halt.  Is this a known problem?
2010-03-04T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	installing java does not issue a halt command
2010-03-04T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	no it doesn't
2010-03-04T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	if you have a problem, please be specific, don't exagerate
2010-03-04T03:55:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	please define "broken"
2010-03-04T03:56:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	ok - that's not broken, you need to remove that lock file
2010-03-04T03:56:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	ikonia	 I would have thought the java installs would have been well tested.
2010-03-04T03:56:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	it's nothing to do with java
2010-03-04T03:56:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	you have a lock file in place
2010-03-04T03:58:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	stop saying java installs are "hosed" explain the problem
2010-03-04T03:58:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	if you exagerate the problem, or don't give details, we can't help
2010-03-04T03:58:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	ikonia	 Dialog box is the right thing to say I believe.  It was where it asked permissions.
2010-03-04T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	you need to use tab to navigate around the dialog and accept the license
2010-03-04T03:59:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	ikonia	 <tab>.  I believe I tried that.  I can try again.  What about synaptic.  It just froze on my laptop.
2010-03-04T04:00:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	reboot your laptop and try again, you probably missed the dialog gui
2010-03-04T04:00:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	ikonia	 Sounds like they could do a better job of that.  I better install it from shell next time.
2010-03-04T04:00:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	no - hundreeds / thousands of other people don't have an issue with this
2010-03-04T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	it works fine
2010-03-04T04:02:00.000Z	ikonia	xenocampanoli	look at the bug reports - thousands of people have no proble, yet you are the first to report this....I wonder if it's java.....or you ?
