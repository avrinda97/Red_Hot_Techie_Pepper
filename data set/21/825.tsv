2012-06-27T12:47:00.000Z	Lartza		I can dd from a drive /dev/sdd to a .img?
2012-06-27T12:47:00.000Z	Lartza		Though will that make an image the size of the drive or the contents there?
2012-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Lartza		Damn
2012-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Lartza		Well then
2012-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Lartza		Not going to do that :)
2012-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Lartza		2GB of files 30B drive
2012-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Lartza		*GB
2012-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Lartza		I'll just sudo cp -a the contents
2012-06-27T12:49:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	rsync.
2012-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	Lartza	Hyperbyte	rsync -p ? This is a / so I need to preserve permissions but does that do it all?
2012-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	man rsync. :-)  You'll probably want rsync -a --delete, maybe --progress in there for your viewing pleasure.
2012-06-27T12:51:00.000Z	Lartza	Hyperbyte	Oh nice yeah I looked at the man just searchwed for permissions :)
2012-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	either way rsync is probably way to go if you want to copy large amounts of data and make sure symlinks stay symlinks, permissions stay correct, etc....
2012-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	Lartza	Hyperbyte	Yes probably :) Although cp -a worked twice for me already since I always don't think of rsync :)
2012-06-27T12:53:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	plus rsync can resume if somehow you need to pause/cancel the copy instruction.
2012-06-27T12:53:00.000Z	Lartza	Hyperbyte	And by it's name it can sync to the backup I now make if I want to bring the same files but like after a system update it won't copy everything?
2012-06-27T12:54:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	it only copies what it needs to.
2012-06-27T13:01:00.000Z	Lartza	Hyperbyte	--progress doesn't tell you almost anything ;D
2012-06-27T13:01:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	it shows the progress.
2012-06-27T13:03:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Lartza	I'm not sure rsync determines total process before it starts.  I think it determines which files it needs to transfer while it's transferring.
2012-06-27T13:04:00.000Z	Lartza	Hyperbyte	It probably checks a subfolder structure at a time since the count always goes up by around 1 or 2 thousand
