2008-04-24T22:57:00.000Z	reactor		but I am unable to install the 64 bit version of any software, what could be the possible reason? Any suggestion?
2008-04-24T22:58:00.000Z	reactor		even my sys info is specifying the processor to AMD Athlon (tm) 64 Processor 3200+
2008-04-24T22:58:00.000Z	reactor		The problem is this only, that I am unable to install any software which is 64 bit version. Not even the OS of 64 bit version
2008-04-24T22:59:00.000Z	reactor		Distopianray: I am using a 32 bit right now, because am unable to install a 64 bit version
2008-04-24T23:01:00.000Z	reactor		It says something like "Use the correct compatible configuration"
2008-04-24T23:01:00.000Z	reactor		I will try installing through a liveCD once again
2008-04-24T23:03:00.000Z	reactor		Another thing, pls guide how to clear up the space in Root directory.
2008-04-24T23:04:00.000Z	reactor		pls guide how to clear up the space in Root directory.
2008-04-24T23:05:00.000Z	reactor		pls guide how to clear up the space in Root directory. it is getting full very fast

2008-04-24T23:07:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	enter "baobab" in the terminal
2008-04-24T23:12:00.000Z	reactor	jharkn	baobab leads me to disk analyser, I believe. What do i do next? how to clean up the unwanted files.
2008-04-24T23:16:00.000Z	reactor	jharkn	it is running. It saeems it is going to take some time b4 I know whats wrong where.
2008-04-24T23:17:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	pretty snazzy lol
2008-04-24T23:21:00.000Z	reactor	jharkn	I came across "apt-get clean". Does it help?
2008-04-24T23:25:00.000Z	reactor	jharkn	it seems "apt-get clean"  cleans everything from /var/cache/apt/archives
2008-04-24T23:28:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	apt-get clean deletes archived installation files
2008-04-24T23:30:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	I would say no as I would guess they are only for backup purposes in the case of no internet connection, but as I say, I'm no expert
2008-04-24T23:32:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	if so, no amount of deleting will solve the underlying problem
2008-04-24T23:37:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	you could then sort that app out somehow
2008-04-24T23:37:00.000Z	jharkn	reactor	or terminate it as a temporary fix
