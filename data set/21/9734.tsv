2009-05-29T06:28:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	sudo aptitude install update-manager | grep State
2009-05-29T06:28:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	sorty: sudo aptitude show update-manager | grep State
2009-05-29T06:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	update-manager was not installed, installing it now.  very stupid that all the guides say to install update-manager-core, which provides nothing, but not update-manager
2009-05-29T06:30:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	odd, saying to install update-manager-core is pretty stupid, as installing update-manager will install everything it needs
2009-05-29T06:31:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	I would prefer to do the command line do-release-update, but it isn't available.  I'd like to run the upgrade in GNU Screen.
2009-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	install do-release-update is part of update-manager-core
2009-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	I have removed and reinstalled update-manager-core, and I do not have a command "do-release-update".
2009-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	try the full path /usr/bin/do-release-update
2009-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	already did, doesn't exist
2009-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	sounds iffy :/
2009-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	and confirmed the $PATH contains /usr/bin and other expected directories
2009-05-29T06:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	you could just update your sources.list manually and then do an upgrade using aptitude
2009-05-29T06:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	I just used Synaptic to check if /usr/bin/do-release-update is installed, and it says it is ... bah
2009-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	err, it's do-release-upgrade sorry
2009-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	problem solved.  yeah, that.  sorry... should have used tab-completion on do-TAB TAB to fill it in
2009-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	:)
2009-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	I was speaking across the room to the system owner who was typing in the commands ... not sure if they got it wrong, or if I did
2009-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	I said do-release-update at one point
2009-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	ah.  but I was obviously doing it even before joining here as well, heh
2009-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	funkyHat	thanks for your assistance
2009-05-29T06:39:00.000Z	funkyHat	Samus_Aran	true :). and no problem
