2007-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	soc		hi
2007-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	soc		have a probblem
2007-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	soc		archlinux damaged my grub
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	soc		i can boot arch, but not windows or ubuntu
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	soc		now i want to do a grub-install /dev/sda
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	soc		ich did a "chroot /mnt/ubuntu" beforehand
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	soc		but it does not work
2007-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	soc		it says not found or not a block device
2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	variant	soc	in what way "does not work"?
2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	variant	soc	it says that when you try to chroot it?
2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	variant	soc	did you mount proc inside the chroot as well?
2007-04-18T08:08:00.000Z	variant	soc	ah.. personally i think it's sometimes best to just type "grub" and set it up inside the grub shell
2007-04-18T08:08:00.000Z	variant	soc	but i'm not really in the mood for explaining :/
2007-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	variant	soc	thats not what you asked..
2007-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	variant	soc	mount -t proc proc /mnt/ubuntu/proc
2007-04-18T08:15:00.000Z	variant	soc	the uuid is just a unique identifier for partitions and disks
2007-04-18T08:15:00.000Z	variant	soc	you can use the non unique /dev/hda1 or /dev/sdb4 for example
2007-04-18T08:17:00.000Z	soc	variant	i just try that ...
2007-04-18T08:18:00.000Z	variant	soc	in linux (the kernel) devices are named as such: the first partition of the first ata disk would be /dev/hda1. in grub this would be called hd0,0
2007-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	soc	variant	yes i know
2007-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	variant	soc	without further details i can't/won't help
