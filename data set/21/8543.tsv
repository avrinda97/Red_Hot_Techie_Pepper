2007-12-05T05:45:00.000Z	ghost		hello all
2007-12-05T05:45:00.000Z	ghost		I have got to say, I LOVE ubuntu. I return from a stint in Gentoo and I must say, blessed be the Ubuntu magic
2007-12-05T05:45:00.000Z	ghost		It just works meets full customability
2007-12-05T05:47:00.000Z	ghost		How is the state of 'desktop effects'
2007-12-05T05:47:00.000Z	ghost		is it really just compis-fusion?
2007-12-05T05:48:00.000Z	ghost		what is the package for the configure app?
2007-12-05T05:49:00.000Z	ghost		is it as robust as Bryle and Emrald was?
2007-12-05T05:50:00.000Z	ghost		compiz
2007-12-05T05:51:00.000Z	ghost		The Human Theme is all well and good, but I want to try out some newer stuff
2007-12-05T05:51:00.000Z	ghost		Oh, and does anyone know if it will work with KDE4 when it comes out?
2007-12-05T05:51:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	have you tried some of the dark themes?
2007-12-05T05:51:00.000Z	ghost	Sepheebear	no, but I intend too
2007-12-05T05:52:00.000Z	ghost	Sepheebear	where do you go for your themes?
2007-12-05T05:52:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	im currently running the ubuntustudio theme and I love it
2007-12-05T05:52:00.000Z	ghost	Sepheebear	link? I am curious about studio how do you like it?
2007-12-05T05:53:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	sudo aptitude install ubuntustudio-theme ubuntustudio-icon-theme
2007-12-05T05:53:00.000Z	ghost	Sepheebear	I was also kinda talking about the distro
2007-12-05T05:54:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	well im running pretty stock gutsy with just the ubuntustudio theme on top
2007-12-05T05:55:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	but afaik ubuntustudio just adds a few apps, sounds, and graphics
2007-12-05T05:55:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	no real core difference
2007-12-05T05:55:00.000Z	Sepheebear	ghost	no
