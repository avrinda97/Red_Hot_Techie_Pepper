2011-01-23T19:29:00.000Z	[bean]		12 hour clock but thats not the problem. the time doesnt want to set right
2011-01-23T19:30:00.000Z	[bean]		 i set the system time, and it shows it correctly but when i close the time settings it reverts back
2011-01-23T19:31:00.000Z	[bean]		ok dhruvasagar im doing that now it asked to install ntp. so im doing that.
2011-01-23T19:31:00.000Z	[bean]		why would the clock applet setting window not work though?
2011-01-23T19:33:00.000Z	[bean]		but whats the point to the clock applet settings if it doesnt work. is it just useless bloat?
2011-01-23T19:35:00.000Z	[bean]		i found other places where changing settings didnt work either
2011-01-23T19:35:00.000Z	[bean]		in the gconf-editor it doesnt change gnome terminal settings
2011-01-23T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	do you have a support question ?
2011-01-23T19:36:00.000Z	[bean]		yes, how can i get these working properly? rather than using alternatives
2011-01-23T19:36:00.000Z	[bean]		gconf-editor should be used right? it dont work right
2011-01-23T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	you can either a.) fix the bug that's stopping them working b.) log a bug for others to fix it
2011-01-23T19:37:00.000Z	[bean]	ikonia	a) if i could fix it i wouldnt be here. b) not sure what im suppose to be logging
2011-01-23T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	a.) ok - so do b. b.) log a bug on launchpad.net that the tools you are expecting to work are not working, and provide details
2011-01-23T19:38:00.000Z	[bean]		so basically you are telling me, that i cant get support here and that i have to report the issue and wait for it to get fixed in the next release
2011-01-23T19:40:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	no, I'm saying you can get support, but if you are saying there is a bug in the software, no-one here will be able to just "fix it", it needs to go through the bug process
2011-01-23T19:41:00.000Z	[bean]		im willing to wait for actual help, but putting it on launchpad doesnt help me. it only helps future versions.
2011-01-23T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	let me make it clear, no-one in this channel will "fix the code", if you want it fixed it has to go through launchpad.net
2011-01-23T19:42:00.000Z	[bean]	ikonia	i dont think its any code. i think its a bad config
2011-01-23T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	you said the config tools are not working and the application is not responding to the config and that it's just bad code or "bloat code"
2011-01-23T19:44:00.000Z	[bean]		i said if it dont work then whats the point of it, is it bloat? i didnt say its bad code or bloat coat. and the config tools arent working but i think thats because the config for how they are setup, not becasue the program itself
2011-01-23T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	[bean]	but it DOES work, many people are using it
