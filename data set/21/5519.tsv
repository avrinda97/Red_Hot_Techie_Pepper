2007-12-25T07:13:00.000Z	xtknight		any linux software that supports ipod nano (gen 3) yet?  { rhythmbox/standard ipod libs on ubuntu dont support it }
2007-12-25T07:14:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	the latest you mean?
2007-12-25T07:14:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	latest nano?  i think.  latest ubuntu?  gutsy here
2007-12-25T07:14:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	latest nano? not right now
2007-12-25T07:15:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	locked out for now
2007-12-25T07:15:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	ahh
2007-12-25T07:16:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	have they had good luck hacking previous ones?  reasonable to expect linux hack in a few months or is there some completely new scheme?
2007-12-25T07:18:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	the vm fix is best for now--surely there will be a workaround eventually--btw I use my mini with no problems at all--the new nano has special features to lock non-itunes (read linux) out of it
2007-12-25T07:18:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	ahh cool
2007-12-25T07:21:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	i actually did have luck downloading my songs and playing them on the pc though
2007-12-25T07:21:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	from the nano?
2007-12-25T07:21:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	correct , thru rhythmbox
2007-12-25T07:22:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	then that would be earlier than the newest nano--just dont update the firmware and you should be okay--I use mine with amarok no problem
2007-12-25T07:22:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	ahh so it's the FW that matters
2007-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	if it is blank, then it's not really, but that is the new hash sum reporting it is to prevent us non itunes-ers from doing I dont know what
2007-12-25T07:24:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	well actually it was blank when i turned on the ipod (ipod itself saw nothing).  either that or the hash was broken/invlaidated.  something happened though that preventing me from syncing
2007-12-25T07:24:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	yeah, google new nano linux and you will see what is up with that
2007-12-25T07:26:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	thx
2008-01-26T22:14:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	not a good idea that
2008-04-09T13:03:00.000Z	bazhang	xtknight	you can /msg ubotu wubi for some very good links
2008-06-26T21:44:00.000Z	xtknight	bazhang	o good idea, it works tho :)
