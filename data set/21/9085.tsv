2005-11-17T11:20:00.000Z	pavelich		is it possible to develop c++ programs and test and run them as if you were running windows, i am new to linux and i am in my first computer science class and need a way to test and run these programs as if it was on windows, sorry i am new to linux and just need some help, does WINE have a psuedo-dos terminal, or am i screwed alltogether, someone please help!!!
2005-11-17T11:20:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	if you write source code that compiles in linux, it will compile in windows as well.
2005-11-17T11:21:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	what is the best way to do that?
2005-11-17T11:22:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	haev you ever written source code?
2005-11-17T11:25:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	well i am in my first semester using c++, and yes, i just am strictly used to using microsoft visual c++, i feel like a unintelligent newb idiot but are there any simple programs that are good?
2005-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	dont feel like that. I understand your question better now. YOu want an IDE for .net development, well, sorry to say, no. You can check out mono(mono.org probably) but there is no .net for linux. Writing source code can be done in text editors.
2005-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	yeah thanks a bunch your a big help, so are there different forms of c++, as in different processes and ways to write the source code depending on the compiler, wouldnt that ruin the universiallity of a language
2005-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	no, Im just always inspired around this time.
2005-11-17T11:32:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	basically, you can compile bear c++ code. Proprietary M$ libraries are not in question. Send me one of your programs through paste.ubuntulinux.nl, and I will tell you what you can do. Also, eclipse is a cool IDE, imo, and can do c++. "/j #c++" to join the C++ channel, and /j eclipse to join the eclipse channel.
2005-11-17T11:33:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	thanks man
2005-11-17T11:33:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	good luck, and happy coding:) I read that somewhere.
2005-11-17T11:38:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	 is there a standard command to open or run a tar.gz packaged file in the terminal, or are the commands exclusive the type of file it is or the operation being performed, are tar.gz files comparable to a .rar or .zip file or more like an executable .exe or am i way off
2005-11-17T11:38:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	an archive, that is the command to unpack it into its own folder.
2005-11-17T11:38:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	man tar to understand the options.
2005-11-17T11:42:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	can u recomend a linux books or something become well versed or maybe a website or just something to expedite the learning process
2005-11-17T11:43:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	yes, philosophy: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ Ubuntu ins-outs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
2005-11-17T11:46:00.000Z	dabaR	pavelich	yes, in my unix class that I attend one of the students was handing them out too.
2005-11-17T11:49:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	yeah its so great but it scares people to break out of what they are used to, and back when i tried openoffice a while back it was nothing to what it is now, its unreal the quallity improvment and how much things have changed in the past year or so
2005-11-17T11:52:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	know of any good music players that feature an organization system similar to iTunes' browse feature, like how by genre, artist, then album
2005-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	ahah i should try a little harder at looking before i ask a dumb question like that, i didnt even notice rythm box and dl banshee, ahah yeah rythmbox has exactly what i was looking for
2005-11-17T12:17:00.000Z	pavelich	dabaR	ok, ahha sorry again, i downloaded the tar.gz file, its located in my home dirrectory and the filename is {eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-linux-gtk.tar.gz} , what is the best way to install it, in terminal would the path be {zxf ./home/eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-linux-gtk.tar.gz} because i tried a few variations of that command and get the error command not found, now does that mean the command itself is wrong or the dirrectory could be wrong too
