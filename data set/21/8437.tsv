2006-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	orbin		is the pastebin down for anyone else?
2006-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	yes.  pastebin.com is up
2006-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	i need something on the ubuntu one...
2006-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	i'd ask for your sources.list, but you're having problems right?
2006-06-02T05:31:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	actually, I was asking for "a friend".  I'm not really having problems at all, no.
2006-06-02T05:34:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	http://pastebin.com/752444
2006-06-02T05:34:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	heh, thanks very much
2006-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	I don't know what dapper-proposed is, or whether I want it in there.
2006-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	is that yours, or official?
2006-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	maybe that's why you're having problems?
2006-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	I'm not really having problems.  someone else was and I was asking on their behalf
2006-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	oh ok
2006-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	that sources.list that you pasted is missing universe updates, and have universe security, which I don't think exists.
2006-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	oh...well that's great :-/
2006-06-02T05:41:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	it seems there is a dists/dapper-security/universe on the repos, so that's ok, but you are missing universe updates
2006-06-02T05:41:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	could you make a pastebin.com entry for mike__ please?
2006-06-02T05:43:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	ok.  how about this - pretty uniform and straightforward: http://pastebin.com/752465
2006-06-02T05:43:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	only 4 lines
2006-06-02T05:44:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	thanks.  i'm blaming you if it stuffs up :)
2006-06-02T05:44:00.000Z	dooglus	orbin	fine.
2006-06-02T05:45:00.000Z	orbin	dooglus	is it wise to give him backports?
