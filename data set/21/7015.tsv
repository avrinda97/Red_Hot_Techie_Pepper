2009-08-31T19:38:00.000Z	albacker		is the problem of ubuntu and ATI graphic card solved?
2009-08-31T19:39:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	depends on what you mean by solved and for what card(s)
2009-08-31T19:40:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	well the new version had not support of ati radeon x300.. it's been a whie since i'm not using ubuntu (and that's the only reason why). so i needed linux now, and was asking myself if instalinng ubuntu would be a good idea.
2009-08-31T19:40:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	i remember that the new version was a real pain, since i couldn't get my card working,everything as running slow as hell.
2009-08-31T19:41:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	latest ati driver is 9.3 which doesn't work in 9.04 but works fine in any previous supported version
2009-08-31T19:42:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	well what's a solution for this? should i install a previous ubuntu version, or is there a hack for this. and do you think i can find another version that has working-drivers for ati ?
2009-08-31T19:42:00.000Z	albacker		s/version/distro : Halitech
2009-08-31T19:42:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	and its not an Ubuntu "issue" its between xorg and ati as both made changes (ati dropped support for alot of cards)
2009-08-31T19:43:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	i know, im not blaming ubuntu. just that i only ave this laptop with ati card. I cant do much.
2009-08-31T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	I use Debian Lenny with an x1200 and it works fine and 8.04 or 8.10 should work fine
2009-08-31T19:43:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	they droped support just because x300 is considered as an old card i think.
2009-08-31T19:44:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	I'm in the same boat as my x1200 is not supported either in Testing or 9.04 either
2009-08-31T19:44:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.21&lang=English
2009-08-31T19:45:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	i see. well, it looks like installing an older ubuntu version is the only way to 'escape' this.
2009-08-31T19:45:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	I would go with 8.04 just due to the fact that its supported longer then 8.10 is
2009-08-31T19:45:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	what's the name of 8.04 ?
2009-08-31T19:45:00.000Z	Halitech		!8.04
2009-08-31T19:46:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	and also, does the use of 8.04  prevent me from using newer version of applications
2009-08-31T19:46:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	you can use backports to get newer software if you need it, or compile yourself
2009-08-31T19:46:00.000Z	albacker	Halitech	i see. well thanks a lot for your time. Bye
2009-08-31T19:47:00.000Z	Halitech	albacker	welcome and good luck
