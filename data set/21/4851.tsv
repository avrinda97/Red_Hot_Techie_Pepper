2009-04-28T20:49:00.000Z	adelie42		If I want to do a clean 9.04 install with a 8.10 CD, all I need to do is run update in live session before install, correct?
2009-04-28T20:50:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	You will not be able to do a 9.04 install with an 8.10 CD.
2009-04-28T20:50:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	even after updating ubiquity?
2009-04-28T20:51:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	:( ok thanks
2009-04-28T20:51:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	 I did not understand your original question.
2009-04-28T20:51:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	Please restate your original question.
2009-04-28T20:52:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	ubiquity is the installer for ubuntu. if I an running a liveCD and update the repository, and update ubiquity, then running the installer would install 9.04. the live CD is just a regular install + ubiquity and squashfs. right?
2009-04-28T20:54:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	I don't know, but sounds interesting.  Did  you stay at a Holiday Inn last night?
2009-04-28T20:55:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	pretty close...
2009-04-28T20:56:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	:)   (was a feeble attempt at humor on my part).
2009-04-28T20:57:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	I am feeling about that special right now. I havn't been home in 3 days, doing ubuntu tech support  :)
2009-04-28T20:57:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	is that too much love?
2009-04-28T20:57:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	Yes, it is!  ;o)
2009-04-28T20:58:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	A friends father runs a web hosting company, and has been a IIS tech for years, and finally decided he hates the problems enough to completly switch over to Ubuntu
2009-04-28T20:59:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	so was helping with that
2009-04-28T20:59:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	though personally, I have never seen a IIS setup so well maintained / setup
2009-04-28T21:00:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	I'll bet it's hard to utangle that many years of MS mindset and stuff what's left into *nix mindset
2009-04-28T21:01:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	If he's that good, he'll be good with Linux.
2009-04-28T21:04:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	That's what I figure
2009-04-28T21:06:00.000Z	usr13	adelie42	But one thing is for sure, it will be easier to maintain his Linux server, once he get's the hang of it.
2009-04-28T21:10:00.000Z	adelie42	usr13	he stated that as his #1 reason for switching.
