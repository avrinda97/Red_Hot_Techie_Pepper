2011-03-07T05:35:00.000Z	luxgeek		I just installed wicd how do I disable the "default" network manager?
2011-03-07T05:35:00.000Z	luxgeek		disable/uninstall
2011-03-07T05:36:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	you can remove nm-applet from startup applications.  i wouldn't uninstall it.
2011-03-07T05:36:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	Isn't there an applet for wicd also?
2011-03-07T05:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	i thought you said you installed it already...
2011-03-07T05:38:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	I have wicd installed, I just haven't put the applet in the panel yet.
2011-03-07T05:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	i'm not sure.  it showed up in the notification area automatically IIRC
2011-03-07T05:38:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	Hmm...ok.
2011-03-07T05:44:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	It's not showing in the notification area "by default" for me...unless I need to reboot...
2011-03-07T05:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	...is it running?
2011-03-07T05:45:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	wicd? afaik...
2011-03-07T05:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	should have an entry in your menu as well ;)
2011-03-07T05:46:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	I do have an entry for the wicd network manager
2011-03-07T05:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	i don't lie ;)
2011-03-07T05:47:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	Just ddon't have anything in the notification area
2011-03-07T05:47:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	hrm.  notification area is enabled..?  i dunno.
2011-03-07T05:48:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	Ummm...need to think outside the box now :P
2011-03-07T05:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	reboot?
2011-03-07T05:48:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	Of COURSE notification area is installed...or I wouldn't know it wasn't showing in it :P
2011-03-07T05:49:00.000Z	arrrghhh	luxgeek	reboot then, i'm not sure.  it worked for me, that's all i remember.
2011-03-07T05:49:00.000Z	luxgeek	arrrghhh	Ok.
