2008-04-10T06:14:00.000Z	sagredo		Hello. I installed the package phpmyadmin, however when I try to access phpmyadmin from my browser I cannot connect
2008-04-10T06:15:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	you have to link it to your apache
2008-04-10T06:15:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	how?
2008-04-10T06:16:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	 assuming you're using apache2 and all defaults, sudo cp /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpmyadmin
2008-04-10T06:17:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	then "sudo a2ensite phpmyadmin"
2008-04-10T06:17:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	I'll give it a go
2008-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	much appreciation, thank you :)
2008-04-10T06:19:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	np
2008-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	when I try to login, I get the following error: #2002 - The server is not responding (or the local MySQL server's socket is not correctly configured)
2008-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	do you have mysql installed?
2008-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	Yes.
2008-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	and you can access it using the client?

2008-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	ps -e | grep mysqld
2008-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	returned nothing
2008-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	: if it returns nothing, its not actually running
2008-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	Nith	sagredo	try "sudo invoke-rc.d mysql start"
2008-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	sagredo	Nith	you're spot on, thanks again
