2008-02-25T03:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]		I have a bunch of server blades here, no cdrom drive available.. my options are USB or PXE.. what's the easiest option to get ubuntu on them?
2008-02-25T03:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]		!install
2008-02-25T03:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]		also I left my laptop power supply at home so I have an hour and 20 minutes to figure this out :)
2008-02-25T03:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]		also when I say USB drive I really mean 1G mp3 player :)
2008-02-25T03:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]		this might get a little weird
2008-02-25T03:42:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	which release of ubuntu are you installing?
2008-02-25T03:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	hardly hereyet
2008-02-25T03:42:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	using the desktop or the alternative?
2008-02-25T03:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	probably alt, I would think
2008-02-25T03:44:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	ive just tried using alt. and its not going to work with an install from a vfat fs usb thing
2008-02-25T03:44:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	seems they left out the kernel module for reading vfat filesystems. u get to the point in the install where it tries to mount the cdrom drive and fails.
2008-02-25T03:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	I'll reformat it ext2 or iso if need be..
2008-02-25T03:46:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	was just a headsup. im sat here in the middle of an install hoping someone around here will chuck me the files i need. really dont wanna d/l the desktop iso for two files
2008-02-25T03:47:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	what two files?
2008-02-25T03:48:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	vmlinuz and initrd.img
2008-02-25T03:51:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	http://kiwiarena.net.nz/files/hardy/  -- hardy a5 i386 desktop cd mounted by loopback, grab whatever you need.
2008-02-25T03:56:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	grabbed the files i needed, thank you very much
2008-02-25T04:08:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	sods law battery will die as you unmounting the usb drive and waiting for the cache to be flushed..
2008-02-25T04:08:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	yeah, fully expecting that
2008-02-25T04:30:00.000Z	amx109	zcat[1]	kinda stuffed ure plans then?
2008-03-10T04:53:00.000Z	zcat[1]	amx109	#ubuntu+1 btw
