2007-09-22T09:38:00.000Z	ectospasm		any of y'all have experience with a PalmOS-based phone and Linux?  I've gotten it to sync, but I can't seem to figure out how to get files onto it yet
2007-09-22T09:39:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	pilot-xfer -p <port> -i file
2007-09-22T09:39:00.000Z	wastrel		but that's not going to work with the GUI method
2007-09-22T09:40:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 I figured out that much (actually I used gpilot-install-file)... but I don't know where to look for the file
2007-09-22T09:40:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 on the phone
2007-09-22T09:40:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	you'll need a file manager if it's not an application
2007-09-22T09:41:00.000Z	wastrel		if it's an application it should show up in the app launcher
2007-09-22T09:41:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	what type of file was it?
2007-09-22T09:41:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 mp3... I was seeing if I could see it in the media player on the phone
2007-09-22T09:42:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	ah.  you may need to install a mp3 player app if the default one doesn't see it
2007-09-22T09:43:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 well, the transfer seemed rather quick, so I don't know if it actually transferred
2007-09-22T09:43:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 is there a way for me to mount the thing so I can inspect the filesystem?
2007-09-22T09:43:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	it may not have, palm os only understands .pdb and .prc files.
2007-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	i don't know how smart gpilot-install is, so it may have landed on a storage card
2007-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 yeah, and AT&T wants to charge me $30/month for internet access.  Fuck you very much
2007-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	any removable storage?
2007-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	ectospasm	wastrel	 not yet
2007-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	that's where you'll put mp3's and other non-palm-database files
2007-09-22T09:45:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	check out freewarepalm.com and find a file manager
2007-09-22T09:45:00.000Z	wastrel		that will let you inspect the contents of memory anyway
2007-09-22T09:46:00.000Z	wastrel	ectospasm	i used to use i think a prog called filez (dont have a palm anymore)
