2009-08-12T21:36:00.000Z	Mrokii		specifically I am looking for something I can do Python with. I also tried to install Eric Python IDE and SPE but both do not work/start here :/

2009-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	if you can fix it let me know too xP
2009-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	Mrokii		:)
2009-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	I doubt it, as I am pretty new to Linux
2009-08-12T21:38:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	i am new to Linux too m8, it seems that we are classmates for Linux :P
2009-08-12T21:39:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	heh, seems so
2009-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	CodeBox seems to work without problems here, installed via Synaptic
2009-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	how did you install it and what do you mean it works without problems? did you run a program?
2009-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	CodeBox Or Code::Blocks?
2009-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	I installed it via the Synaptic package manager and just tried to start it afterwards. That's all I have tested :)
2009-08-12T21:47:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	err, "code:blocks", right :)
2009-08-12T21:48:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	which one did you choose to install?
2009-08-12T21:49:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	the Package is named "codeblocks" in the synaptic package manager
2009-08-12T21:50:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	Thats what i have installed bu i have this problem. Look here http://paste.ubuntu.com/252007/
2009-08-12T21:52:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	Looks more like a syntax-error to me than a problem with the IDE
2009-08-12T21:52:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	I don't know C++, but isn't a comment initiated with "//*" ?
2009-08-12T21:53:00.000Z	LrdOfNightmares	Mrokii	no in C++ thats how the comments are used, with 2 slashes, what programing language do you know?
2009-08-12T21:54:00.000Z	Mrokii	LrdOfNightmares	Javascript, a bit of Objective-C and some other scripting-languages. I have only used C some years ago (I'm only a hobbyist regarding programming)
