2010-08-12T06:39:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		hi, I've been having this big problem for two months now.  I have been unable to share my network connection to my Roku set-top box.  The forums have been basically useless.  Can anyone please help me?
2010-08-12T06:41:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		or in the forums, for that matter
2010-08-12T06:43:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	if there both wireless, do an ad-hoc netowrk.
2010-08-12T06:44:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	neither are wireless routers
2010-08-12T06:44:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	you dont need a wireless router for ad-hoc, that's what ad-hoc does
2010-08-12T06:45:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	wireless not allowed, university has its own wireless network
2010-08-12T06:46:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	and that wireless network is 802.1X, which Roku does not support
2010-08-12T06:46:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	yes
2010-08-12T06:46:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	and I have a long enough Ethernet cable
2010-08-12T06:47:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	NICs work independently when connected to wall, but outgoing won't connect with Roku box
2010-08-12T06:48:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	that's the Netflix streaming box
2010-08-12T06:50:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	I want to share the connection from my Ubuntu to the Roku box
2010-08-12T06:50:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	on, straight ISC, no forward X or any of that?
2010-08-12T06:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	and your not allowed to have a router or switch in the room either right ?
2010-08-12T06:52:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	right
2010-08-12T06:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	and you've went down the cross-over cable route ?
2010-08-12T06:53:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	KE1HA	no, not yet
2010-08-12T06:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	with the limitations you put on this, that's the only way I can think, No Wireless, not Hub / Switch, only thing left is direct connection.
2010-08-12T06:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	and a standard cat5e/6 is not gonna work,
2010-08-12T07:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	not to mention, your gonna need 2x Lan ports on the Inet box, and a DHCP "server, which Im sure your Network admins are not going to like much.
2010-08-12T07:17:00.000Z	KE1HA	jdsbluedevl	Both boxes need an IP address, yes, how is the second box, the one hanging off your primary INET gettign its second IP address ?
