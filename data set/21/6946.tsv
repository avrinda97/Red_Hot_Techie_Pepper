2007-05-29T14:54:00.000Z	ward_		how can i see how much is used of what drive in a nice way in feisty please?
2007-05-29T14:54:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	df -h
2007-05-29T14:54:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	ty
2007-05-29T14:55:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	i mean something to see how much of my linux partition is used and how much of my windows partition
2007-05-29T14:56:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	df -h doesn't show your windows partition!?
2007-05-29T14:57:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	it shows one 18 GB drive (i have 2 of 17 or 18 GB, one for windows, one for ubuntu)
2007-05-29T14:57:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	and the info is faulty too :s 1,9GB used, and i used more on both partitions
2007-05-29T14:57:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	can you dual boot?
2007-05-29T14:57:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	yeah everything works like it should lol
2007-05-29T14:58:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	weird.
2007-05-29T14:58:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	is there anything with a GUI ?
2007-05-29T14:59:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	not that I'm familiar with, I always use df.
2007-05-29T14:59:00.000Z	ward_		ok no prob n2diy
2007-05-29T15:01:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	system-prefrences-disk, works here on Dapper
2007-05-29T15:02:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	doesnt exist here
2007-05-29T15:03:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	That's what I figured, it disappeared after Dapper!?
2007-05-29T15:03:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	i believe so, i think i just read that when i googled for a way to see how much is used of what partition
2007-05-29T15:04:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	That's why I'm not "upgrading."
2007-05-29T15:04:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	i'm running ubuntu studio
2007-05-29T15:05:00.000Z	n2diy	ward_	Interesting, your the first person I've run into running that version.
2007-05-29T15:05:00.000Z	ward_	n2diy	its basically feisty with some extra packets
