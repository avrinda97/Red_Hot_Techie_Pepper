2009-06-27T11:20:00.000Z	Aacron		and if xorg.conf is blank, I dunno where the heck it is getting the options :|  which means I can't specify my monitor refresh rate or anything.
2009-06-27T11:21:00.000Z	Aacron		anyone else know anythign about this?
2009-06-27T11:21:00.000Z	aXeus	Aacron	Wouldn't X11 NOT load if it couldn't find the .conf?
2009-06-27T11:21:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	apparently it does cause mine is empty as heck right now.
2009-06-27T11:22:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	so it has to be getting config from *somewhere*!!
2009-06-27T11:22:00.000Z	aXeus	Aacron	Perhaps you're looking in the wrong spot?
2009-06-27T11:22:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	nope...
2009-06-27T11:22:00.000Z	aXeus	Aacron	Perhaps it's the ghost in the machine.
2009-06-27T11:22:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	doh nevermind... I'm an idiot :))
2009-06-27T11:23:00.000Z	aXeus	Aacron	Looking in the wrong spot?
2009-06-27T11:23:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	yep! *shame*
2009-06-27T11:23:00.000Z	aXeus		lol
2009-06-27T11:23:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	i'm just curious about one thing though... I have the 1650 pro, which i read is R530
2009-06-27T11:24:00.000Z	Aacron		but glxinfo says I'm running the r300 driver or osmething
2009-06-27T11:24:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	doesnt' that mean that some of my card's acceleration and stuff isnt' goign to work as fast as it should?
2009-06-27T11:24:00.000Z	aXeus	Aacron	The X1600* is an R530 isn't it?
2009-06-27T11:24:00.000Z	aXeus		It's R530 based.
2009-06-27T11:24:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	yeah
2009-06-27T11:25:00.000Z	aXeus		I'm really not familiar with the proper drivers for them to be honest, I run nVidia.
2009-06-27T11:25:00.000Z	Aacron	aXeus	going to paste what glxinfo said
2009-06-27T11:26:00.000Z	aXeus	Aacron	PM it
