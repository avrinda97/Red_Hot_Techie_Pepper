2007-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	i just got bcm4218 up and running yesterday
2007-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	oh well....
2007-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	i think it runs on b mode, so that's why it's slow
2007-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	gatekeep	yell0w	yea it does, hence slowness .. but it was BAD slow ...
2007-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	it was ok with me, not to bad
2007-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	gatekeep	yell0w	we're talking about slower then 56k slow ... switched to ndiswrapper ... fast again ...
2007-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	gatekeep	yell0w	well it could be that my card is a newer release, requires 4.xx drivers
2007-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	what i'd really want is a new network-manager
2007-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	it's pretty decent speed on my 4318
2007-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	gatekeep	yell0w	well getting my wireless working wasn't my happy moment, getting my ATI X1300 w/ Xgl and partial 3D acceleration was
2007-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	yell0w	gatekeep	i hear ya
