2012-09-11T05:44:00.000Z	SnapSnap		I was thinking about routing all connections through Tor but A.) the connection wouldn't be encrypted, and B.) it would probably triple the download time. And I have no idea how to set up a VPN...
2012-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	are you talking about bittorrent? Just run the tracker connection through tor
2012-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	Nisstyre		that doesn't take much bw
2012-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	Nisstyre		then force encryption
2012-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	Nisstyre		that will take care of essentially all traffic shaping
2012-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	SnapSnap	Nisstyre	I have Tor installed, but have no idea how to route connections through it, or how to force encryption.
2012-09-11T05:46:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	what client? RTorrent is good.
2012-09-11T05:46:00.000Z	SnapSnap	Nisstyre	Transmission
2012-09-11T05:46:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	I recommend rtorrent because it's more configurable than transmission. Transmission is "Easier" to use because it's a GUI client, but rtorrent will server you better in the long run.
2012-09-11T05:46:00.000Z	Nisstyre		s/server/serve/
2012-09-11T05:47:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	all you want to do, essentially is route all tracker connections (if using a tracker, this doesn't apply to magnet links) through a proxy system such as tor, a vpn, or any other proxy type deal
2012-09-11T05:48:00.000Z	Nisstyre		I believe Transmission will let you do this
2012-09-11T05:48:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	you can run the entire thing through a vpn if you have one
2012-09-11T05:49:00.000Z	Nisstyre		that includes the actual downloading
2012-09-11T05:49:00.000Z	Nisstyre		since a vpn is just a new network interface
2012-09-11T05:49:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	keep in mind this doesn't stop people from seeing the VPN doing things, so pick a VPN provider you trust
2012-09-11T05:50:00.000Z	SnapSnap	Nisstyre	honestly I'm not as educated as I could be concerning Tor and VPNs so setting all of this up is kind of beyond me
2012-09-11T05:51:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	setting up OpenVPN is quite easy, see this https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN
2012-09-11T05:51:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	ignore all the stuff about servers
2012-09-11T05:51:00.000Z	Nisstyre		you just want the client
2012-09-11T05:52:00.000Z	Nisstyre	SnapSnap	there's probably a guide to just doing the client configuration somewhere...
