2007-05-24T13:11:00.000Z	Ax3		anytime I try to enable 'beryl' or 'beryl-manager' from tty, my screen goes entirely white and i have to restart X, suggestions?
2007-05-24T13:11:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	what video card?
2007-05-24T13:12:00.000Z	Ax3	crdlb	nvidia 6100
2007-05-24T13:12:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	you don't have your nvidia drivers installed
2007-05-24T13:13:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	glxinfo|grep direct
2007-05-24T13:13:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	that has to say yes
2007-05-24T13:13:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	are you on ubuntu feisty?
2007-05-24T13:14:00.000Z	Ax3	crdlb	indeed
2007-05-24T13:14:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	system>administration>restricted manager
2007-05-24T13:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	yep :)
2007-05-24T13:18:00.000Z	Ax3	crdlb	ok restarted now what? :)
2007-05-24T13:18:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	that's it
2007-05-24T13:18:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	probably should test it first with: glxinfo|grep direct
2007-05-24T13:22:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	that's a bug in the nvidia drivers
2007-05-24T13:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	either set Rendering path>Copy OR set Rendering Platform>Force AIGLX
2007-05-24T13:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	in the jewel menu (adv. beryl options)
2007-05-24T13:24:00.000Z	Ax3	crdlb	MUCH BETTER! :)

2007-05-24T13:26:00.000Z	crdlb	Ax3	visual effects>wobbly windows
2007-05-24T13:26:00.000Z	Ax3	crdlb	gotcha
