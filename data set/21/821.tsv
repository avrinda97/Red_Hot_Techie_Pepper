2011-05-26T00:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	how big is the ssd card how many gihs?
2011-05-26T00:19:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	use the Wy partitioner to clean a space by shrink a partition. Make sure you are not past the max amount of partitions and install Ubuntu in the unallocated space, .
2011-05-26T00:20:00.000Z	Meow27	nit-wit	i need to fully reformat my disk anyway my problem is about making room
2011-05-26T00:20:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	so you want size allocation for MS and Ubuntu ?
2011-05-26T00:21:00.000Z	Meow27	nit-wit	no i need a location advice
2011-05-26T00:21:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	you have lost me but that is not hard to do.;)
2011-05-26T00:22:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	maybe easybcd will do it better.
2011-05-26T00:22:00.000Z	Meow27	nit-wit	whats that?
2011-05-26T00:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	I'm not sure why you would use hibernate anyway it takes just as long to fire up then a boot or reboot.
2011-05-26T00:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	sleep yes I see a use there.
2011-05-26T00:25:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	here is a easybcd link join there forum, if you need help as well. http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1
2011-05-26T00:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	you don't need a partition for grub, install and use the easybcd and the hibernate will work I suspect
2011-05-26T00:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	that makes no sense in using a partition for grub.
2011-05-26T00:30:00.000Z	Meow27	nit-wit	woodt. ok i think i know how im gonna go by my reformat now. thanks for support :3
2011-05-26T00:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	Meow27	you only fail until you suceed keep trying.;)
