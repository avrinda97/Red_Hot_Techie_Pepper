2012-08-03T14:14:00.000Z	geirha	_jeet	apt-cache policy libldap-2.4-2   could also help, while you're at it.
2012-08-03T14:17:00.000Z	_jeet	geirha	: i pasted output at pastebin
2012-08-03T14:17:00.000Z	geirha	_jeet	Good. Paste the url to it here
2012-08-03T14:17:00.000Z	_jeet		http://paste.ubuntu.com/1126790/
2012-08-03T14:18:00.000Z	geirha	_jeet	Ok, and   apt-cache policy libldap-2.4-2
2012-08-03T14:19:00.000Z	_jeet		http://paste.ubuntu.com/1126797/
2012-08-03T14:19:00.000Z	geirha	_jeet	Seems you have manually installed a newer version of libldap, at least it's not coming from the repository
2012-08-03T14:20:00.000Z	_jeet	geirha	: what can be solution then ?
2012-08-03T14:21:00.000Z	geirha	_jeet	You either need to install the slapd package with the same version, or uninstall libldap-2.4-2, then install slapd
2012-08-03T14:21:00.000Z	geirha	_jeet	which should grab both packages from the same repository
2012-08-03T14:22:00.000Z	_jeet	geirha	: ok i am trying again after uninstalling
