2005-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	export TERM=xterm
2005-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	like in set TERM=xterm?
2005-05-25T16:05:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	if i do set | grep TERM i get TERM=dumb
2005-05-25T16:05:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	export TERM=xterm is for bourne shell compatible shells (sh, bash, ksh) setenv TERM vt100 (without the =) is for csh and tcsh
2005-05-25T16:05:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	which terminal emulator are you using?
2005-05-25T16:05:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	k thanks
2005-05-25T16:07:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	thanks , #clear works now , and where are all those variables stored, in what file(s) ?
2005-05-25T16:08:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	depends on your terminal emulator and shell
2005-05-25T16:08:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	im using BASH
2005-05-25T16:08:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	and which terminal emulator? gnome-terminal, xterm, konsole?
2005-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	xterm
2005-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	try gnome-terminal and see if you need to do that export trick too
2005-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	well im using BASH and the emulator is xterm
2005-05-25T16:13:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	the man pages don't say much
2005-05-25T16:14:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	does it happen with other terminal emulators too?
2005-05-25T16:15:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	nope, now after doing the export TERM=xterm , /bin/bash clear works, but what i wanted to now i where does this export command exports things
2005-05-25T16:16:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	only into memory :)
2005-05-25T16:16:00.000Z	Seveas	briza	you can put that command in your ~/.bashrc if you want
2005-05-25T16:17:00.000Z	briza	Seveas	cool :)
