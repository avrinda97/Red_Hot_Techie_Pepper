2008-02-23T00:02:00.000Z	luislo		Hi all. I apologize for the many times some of you have heard my problem. The thing is, I was a happy suse user until it unfortunately occurred to me to upgrade my BIOS. After that, my music (sound card hda) sounded like "scratched cds" and my wireless card is detected but it doesn't recognize my wireless network. This coincided with a suse update, so some of you suggested me to make a clean install. I have made 3 clean installs
2008-02-23T00:02:00.000Z	luislo		(in this last one the system recognized two wireless cards, but I only have one) and I've also tried three other distros. All of them had the aforementioned problem (the installation process was even hung in ubuntu). The thing is, after every clean installed I've made in the past, suse was perfect. So the only thing that have changed is the BIOS... and I don't think the issue is a defective harware because everything still works
2008-02-23T00:02:00.000Z	luislo		perfect in windows... so I don't know what to do guys. Please I'd really appreciate any help. Now I want to install ubuntu, but the installlation cd (7.04) doesn't seem to work and the media check says it is just fine. Just right after getting to the desktop, I can't pass an orange-pink screen... it just stays in there... and I can't move the cursor, but in a totally orange pink screen....
2008-02-23T00:04:00.000Z	luislo		neverblue? I didn't realize it was too long... sorry, but could u please respond if u have any idea? same erUSUL
2008-02-23T00:06:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	this has happened to me, turns out the BIOS update updated firmware on my wifi card as well, making it no longer work with current drivers... I had to downgrade the firmware manually.. not much help, but you are not alone in seeing this.
2008-02-23T00:07:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	so there's a precedent... this is actually of great help... may i know which computer?
2008-02-23T00:07:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	that was a toshiba satellite laptop
2008-02-23T00:07:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	same here!
2008-02-23T00:08:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	:(
2008-02-23T00:08:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	which model? :(
2008-02-23T00:09:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	P30-R1
2008-02-23T00:09:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	and u didn't downgrade the kernel?
2008-02-23T00:09:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	i don't even remember how I did it... it is not a kernel problem
2008-02-23T00:09:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	no no, i'm not asking how, i guess i'
2008-02-23T00:10:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	no no, i'm not asking how, i guess i'm asking if u did downgraded the firmware? and also the bios?
2008-02-23T00:10:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	i think I went into windows, uninstalled the updated driver pack, reinstalled from original cd
2008-02-23T00:11:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	so if I actually made a complete clean install (both windows and linux partitions... that might work?)
2008-02-23T00:12:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	... not necessarily, I think you need to reinstall the driver in windows for the wifi for instance... this is how I think I did it
2008-02-23T00:13:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	I't ok ejer, just need some info, whichever believe me u've been very helpful. Sorry to bother you with one more thing, but... doesn't that mean that, although unnecessary, if I reset to the factory settings then I'm back to the original drivers?
2008-02-23T00:19:00.000Z	luislo	ejer	so I should go to windows and there uninstall the problematic drivers, and then reinstall those from my cd?
2008-02-23T00:20:00.000Z	ejer	luislo	it is worth a shot
