2009-08-11T04:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 whats your video card?
2009-08-11T04:32:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	nvidia fx 5500
2009-08-11T04:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 use the nvidia-settings tools to set the proper res for monitor perhaps.
2009-08-11T04:33:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	somesaid i need to find my edid for my tv?
2009-08-11T04:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 whats the connection to the tv? vga/dvi/hdmi/svideo?
2009-08-11T04:33:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	i already tried that
2009-08-11T04:33:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	vga
2009-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 ive never had issues with nvidia-settings and my external monitors. or svideo tv.  never had to mess with edid's.
2009-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	in sobayon i dont have issues could i copy xorg file from sabayon live cd and use it with ubuntu?
2009-08-11T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 if you are getting a picture that the wrong res. perhaps try the xrandr tool's to change the res. or see what it says it supports.
2009-08-11T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 thats used to be the main X setting file yes. but with latest ubuntu releases - X auto-configures for the most part.
2009-08-11T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 but its possible your old xorg.conf might work. Backup your current one.
2009-08-11T04:36:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	but xorg.conf is just display? right
2009-08-11T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kaiser10123	 No. it has mouse/keyboard/input/other stuff in there (or it did at one time) its rather minimal now.
2009-08-11T05:11:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	it worked i copies xorg.conf from sabayon live cd:)
2009-08-12T06:35:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	hey
2009-08-12T06:36:00.000Z	kaiser10123	Dr_Willis	the copied xorg worked for me
