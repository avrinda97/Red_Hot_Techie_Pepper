2006-09-29T05:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	Time to get a new HD.
2006-09-29T05:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	You have to run fsck from a LiveCD
2006-09-29T05:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	I'm willing to bet if you run fsck on it it'll kill the disk.
2006-09-29T05:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	Take it back.
2006-09-29T05:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	You try spinning a 1/2 pound piece of metal at 7500 rpm and floating a rod 1cm above it without having something go wrong :P
2006-09-29T05:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	Oh man
2006-09-29T05:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	Moving a HD at all while it's reading/writing can be fatal
2006-09-29T05:45:00.000Z	Homer	Amaranth	that is suprising on a laptop hdd
2006-09-29T05:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	It shouldn't be moving a lot while it's on :P
2006-09-29T05:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	Time to get a new one. :)
2006-09-29T05:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	Homer	You'll have to pay them money for something you broke while doing user servicing.
