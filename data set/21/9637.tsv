2005-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	trevor3307		ok
2005-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	darkheart	trevor3307	If you got samba working, VNC shouldn't be a problem.
2005-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	trevor3307		well..i think i have samba working...
2005-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	trevor3307		i can see my windows pc from ubuntu...but not vice-versa...
2005-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	darkheart	trevor3307	Well, I'll sum up the steps, apt-get the package, run vncserver, enter a password. now you have VNC running and can connect.
2005-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	darkheart	trevor3307	Just so you know, if you want to connect to the active desktop, you don't need to install VNC.
2005-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	trevor3307		do i need to install VNC on windows?
2005-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	trevor3307		ok...
2005-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	darkheart	trevor3307	You need a vnc viewer to connect to the host running the vnc server.
2005-09-13T16:19:00.000Z	trevor3307		i configured it and i restarted ubunutu...
2005-09-13T16:19:00.000Z	trevor3307		lemme try it
2005-09-13T16:19:00.000Z	darkheart	trevor3307	Restarted Ubuntu? Most config changes don't need a reboot.
2005-09-13T16:20:00.000Z	trevor3307		well..samba restart wouldnt work..
2005-09-13T16:20:00.000Z	trevor3307	slept	smbtree shows me my two xp machines on my network..
2005-09-13T16:20:00.000Z	darkheart	trevor3307	Sorry, didn't know you were talking about that. Anyway, I'll let you work on your smb stuff.
