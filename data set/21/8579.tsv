2006-03-14T12:43:00.000Z	DJ_t		what is SLI technology in a mobo?
2006-03-14T12:43:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	It allows you to link up multiple PCI-x gfx cards
2006-03-14T12:45:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	does it make an incredibly large amount of difference gaming ?
2006-03-14T12:47:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	what, glx and no glx? yes.
2006-03-14T12:49:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	so if i get a dual-core SLI mobo, get 2 pci-x vid cards, if i plug one monitor into one of the vid cards will both vid cards combine 2 make the graphics better/faster?
2006-03-14T12:49:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	Oh sorry, SLI. Nvidia have aid they're not interested in supporting SLI for Linux.
2006-03-14T12:50:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	I think the aim is to make the game run accelerated on up to 8 monitors,.
2006-03-14T12:51:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	i met a guy tonight at compusa who has been using linux for 10+ years and he suggested the dualcore SLI mobo
2006-03-14T12:51:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	good for him <heh>
2006-03-14T12:51:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	why would he suggest SLI knowing i use linux if it wasnt supported?
2006-03-14T12:51:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	The mobo might be nice, the issue is whether the druivers support SLI or not.
2006-03-14T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	Because the rest of the mobo might still be nice.
2006-03-14T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	it'll still work fine when you have a single gfx card.
2006-03-14T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	Or perhaps he just didn't know what he was talking about.
2006-03-14T12:54:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	i guess so
2006-03-14T12:55:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	It would appear so. Well, and an SLI mobo and multiple (expensive) gfx cards.
2006-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	think its worth it?
2006-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	Nah
2006-03-14T12:58:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	If you're after a gaming rig, get a high-clocked single core cpu and a high end gfx card
2006-03-14T12:59:00.000Z	cafuego	DJ_t	If not, get a lower clocked multicore cpu
2006-03-14T13:01:00.000Z	DJ_t	cafuego	what is the difference with dual-core, is it like having 2 computers in one? ( Dual boot, have ubuntu and a different OS running at the same time, different monitors ) ?
