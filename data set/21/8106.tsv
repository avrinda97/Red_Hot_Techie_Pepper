2007-08-17T10:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	sorry, it,s getting late, and I lose track easily
2007-08-17T10:57:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	It was a while ago.
2007-08-17T10:58:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	Still, why doesn't the default installer allow those cards?  (Not even with the free nv driver)
2007-08-17T10:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	the free nv driver is not FOSS , ie open source as I recall , it is still restricted, and ubuntu is suppose to be FOSS all the way
2007-08-17T11:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	Still, why doesn't the default installer allow those cards?  (Not even with the free nv driver)
2007-08-17T11:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	call Mark and ask him
2007-08-17T11:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	He's too cool to listen to me. :)
2007-09-04T16:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	 get the alternate install cd, it has a text based installer
2007-09-04T16:54:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	No way to force vesa mode or something?
2007-09-04T16:55:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	not unless you hve the dvd which has the text based installer as an option
2007-09-04T16:56:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	if it booted using vesa, it'd still be able to use the graphical installer.
2007-09-04T16:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	I don'T know how to do that,  or even if it can be done
2007-09-04T05:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	As for my ealrier question about forcing VESA mode, I believe it /is/ possible, was just hoping it was also possible in Ubuntu.
2007-09-04T05:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	HOwever, it turned out that my friend had tried the 6.06 release, which I've politely told him is practically obsolete. :)
2007-09-04T05:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	It' might be, I just don'T know how
2007-09-04T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	6.06 is the lts it won,T be obsolete until the next lts  in a couple of years I think , strickly speaking it is the most stable version currently available
2007-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	That's the way an upgrade _should_ be.
2007-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Arafangion	I wasn't complaining
2007-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	Pelo	Didn't mean to imply that you were. :)
