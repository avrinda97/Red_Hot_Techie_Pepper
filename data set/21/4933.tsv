2011-07-23T15:26:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	I saw someone said Wine could make a old version of it work ...
2011-07-23T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	run: lsusb    the output will show the ID of the USB connecter it talks to, you can use that to find guides
2011-07-23T15:27:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	It is not by USB ... it is wifi controlled.
2011-07-23T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	so what is this "desktop controller"?
2011-07-23T15:27:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	Though you maybe could tell me how to make HDMI output work instead? :P
2011-07-23T15:28:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	The Sonos Desktop Controller is able to index all music collection, play, change media channel, volume and so on for all Sonos devices in the wifi network ;)
2011-07-23T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	I'm not too good on sound
2011-07-23T15:28:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	HDMI is about video and sound ;)
2011-07-23T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	i know what it is, i'm just no good at gettng sound through it
2011-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	apparently the 1.3 version of wine makes it work but really badly
2011-07-23T15:34:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	Really, the beta version?
2011-07-23T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	yeah the wine ppa has it
2011-07-23T15:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	remove the version you have now, install wine1.3 then run the app, may help. There is a toll free number to call for support too (check website)
2011-07-23T15:37:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	I think it is in repisotiroies as well ;)
2011-07-23T15:37:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	Isnt there any live support? :D I hate phone support xD
2011-07-23T15:39:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	But I dont understand, when I install wine it installs a lot of packages. But when I remove wine it does not remove the other packages? :D
2011-07-23T15:44:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	Thanks for tiping regarding Wine 1.3. You know why 1.3 works but n.2? :Pot 1
2011-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Oxymoron	wine is a weird creature, your app obviously needs the extra features. I suggest you contact the Sonos guys to get them to make a Linux client. They make an android one, so why not :)
2011-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	Hehe I think people already did. But they know most people using Mac OS or Windows and they are focus on paying customers I guess .... But sure I can ask. Took a heck long time for SPotify to make a QT client :P
2011-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	Oxymoron	ActionParsnip	The Sonos controller works pretty well I must say :)
