2008-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	What ISP?
2008-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	They may block torrenting. You may want to enable encryption.
2008-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	Try encryption.
2008-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	And try changing ports.
2008-08-23T12:13:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Encryption is enabled and using port 56000, tried changing it but same result
2008-08-23T12:13:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	What kind of router?
2008-08-23T12:13:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	its a Thompson router (not particularly good i think)
2008-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	Try looking for a new router that can run DD-WRT.
2008-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	I've been very happy with my Linksys.
2008-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Ah, okay will try that. Its a free router I got so probably is crap. Although I have uploaded on dc++ at full speed but guess its a single conneciton
2008-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Oh ok, will try check it with a new router
2008-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	My suggestion is anything Linksys that you can flash DD-WRT on for cheap. An example is the WRT54G like what I got.
2008-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Cool thanks for the suggestion
2008-08-23T12:18:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Hmm, would you be able to help with traffic control?
2008-08-23T12:19:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	Depends. Shoot.
2008-08-23T12:20:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Well I wanted to set up a traffic shaping script that would differentiate between LAN and external ip's and limit the speeds accordingly.
2008-08-23T12:20:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	So I'm thinking of using iptables to mark packets accordingly and then stick them down the corresponding qdiscs
2008-08-23T12:21:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	Now see my expertise stops right at programming. The most I ever did was Visual Basic 6. Heh. If you get a decent router with DD-WRT you can use QOS which is very nice.
2008-08-23T12:21:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	Ah okay, thank you very much though :)
2008-08-23T12:22:00.000Z	MrObvious	rampageoberon	Your life will improve much with a DD-WRT capable router. :)
2008-08-23T12:22:00.000Z	rampageoberon	MrObvious	yep going to replace my current router
