2011-09-13T00:42:00.000Z	popey		usb stick? mattpat
2011-09-13T00:42:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	Yeah, I have one, but I'm not sure where to *find* the module; can it be found on the Desktop ISO?
2011-09-13T00:42:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	i assume its jme.ko?
2011-09-13T00:43:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	on my 11.10 system there is a /lib/modules/3.0.0-11-generic/kernel/drivers/net/jme.ko
2011-09-13T00:44:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	i see the same file on my 11.04 system too.. /2.6.38-10-generic/kernel/drivers/net/jme.ko
2011-09-13T00:44:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	Well. It's here. Is there a way to tell if it's being loaded, and if not, load it? (I'm not very familiar with drivers)
2011-09-13T00:45:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	lsmod | grep jme
2011-09-13T00:45:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	that will show if it's loaded
2011-09-13T00:45:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	Well then. It is being loaded. So clearly there's another issue going on, which is considerably more of a problem
2011-09-13T00:46:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	is that a wifi or wired device? (sorry, I only know that computer by name, never used one)
2011-09-13T00:46:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	It's wired (and the wireless doesn't work either, but I can live with that)
2011-09-13T00:46:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	anything in dmesg?
2011-09-13T00:46:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	dmesg | grep eth
2011-09-13T00:46:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	or, dmesg | grep jme
2011-09-13T00:47:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	Well it looks as though it's just as simple as the network cable isn't working.
2011-09-13T00:47:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	that would be best-case scenario :D
2011-09-13T00:48:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	I assumed it was more since the installer said it didn't recognize the network interface, but after changing things it seems that the interface is now being recognized, it's just that the cable doesn't work :P
2011-09-13T00:48:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	Huzzah! Time for beer!
2011-09-13T00:49:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	Thanks for the help :) I'll try it on another port and hope it works. And if it doesn't, well I'll probably be back.
2011-09-13T01:20:00.000Z	mattpat	popey	Turns out the network jack on my Eee does not appear to be properly seated. If I hold it in tightly, I get a link, but if I just let it sit there I don't. That, I can solve later. The other issue, though, is that I only get an IPv6 address. Thoughts?
2011-09-13T01:21:00.000Z	popey	mattpat	thats odd, no idea, sorr
