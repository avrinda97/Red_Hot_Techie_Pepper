2009-03-17T20:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	lol Windohs Live Messenger
2009-03-17T20:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	heh ok uhmmmm
2009-03-17T20:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	that's one of the worst programs ever :)   ,but it really does help to lock stupid people into Windows.  Linux has  some good alternatives though
2009-03-17T20:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	yes there is Pidgin and Kopete multi protocall network,  but you will find they lack your stupid MSN features
2009-03-17T20:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	however  there is also AMSN and Kmess
2009-03-17T20:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	  AMSN has web cam suppourt etc etc.   Kmess is nice as well
2009-03-17T20:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	how old are you?
2009-03-17T20:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	how old are you?
2009-03-17T20:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	oh  thought you would be a bit younger
2009-03-17T20:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	I mean it's stupid people that are locked into  WIndows LIve Messenger mainly.  however if you really must have it in Ubuntu, there is a way
2009-03-17T20:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	however the only way your going to get WIndows LIve Messenger is by running Windows inside Ubuntu
2009-03-17T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	I belive Wine and all that will fail with it
2009-03-17T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	no there is not
2009-03-17T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	live messenger to then itunes?  there are itunes alternatives
2009-03-17T20:54:00.000Z	stabbyjoe12	sebsebseb	i no and the itunes alternatives are fine
2009-03-17T20:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	 if you want certain Windows shit such as WIndows Live Messenger and Itunes,  your going to  need to run them in Windows.  or if it's an Itunes you could run it on a Mac of course
2009-03-17T20:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	if you must have WIndows Live Messenger,  then you will need Windows for it, it's as simple as that
2009-03-17T20:55:00.000Z	stabbyjoe12	sebsebseb	no its not that kind of attitude will never progress an os
2009-03-17T20:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	do you think Microsoft care about making  Desktop Linux popular or any other OS?  of course not, hence why they make sure that later versions of WIndows LIve Messenger only work  properly  on  Windows
2009-03-17T20:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stabbyjoe12	it's amazing the amount of  ignorant computer users,  that rely so much on Windows Live Messenger, even though the alternatives are pretty good as well
