2008-06-26T02:46:00.000Z	Mouzz		If I need some help building a program from source (in ubuntu), where do I go for help?
2008-06-26T02:46:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	right here might work.. just ask your question
2008-06-26T02:47:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	Building the prog gives an error and I want to check if I have the right dependencies. How would I do that?
2008-06-26T02:47:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	well.. you look at the error message from ./configure and make some kind of guess
2008-06-26T02:48:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	if the program is available you can run sudo apt-get build-dep <packagename> to make apt install all dependencies for you
2008-06-26T02:48:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	ok, thnx!
2008-06-26T03:01:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	I dl'ed the src from svn. INSTALL said to run ./configure but that isn't present so I ran 'autoconf'. This gives errors about "possibly undefined marcos"
2008-06-26T03:01:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	(also ran apt-get build-dep)
2008-06-26T03:01:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	there's supposed to be a file called configure somewhere in there
2008-06-26T03:02:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	check if it isn't in a subfolder or something
2008-06-26T03:06:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	It's not in any subdir... I'll re-checout the entire tree
2008-06-26T03:09:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	I just downloaded the source to gthumb and there is a configure script in the root folder of the source archive
2008-06-26T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	are you sure you got all the files when you downloaded your source?
2008-06-26T03:10:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	is it "configure.in" ?
2008-06-26T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	nope.. just "configure"
2008-06-26T03:11:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	I cheked it out from the svn repository. Maybe I should just download the source..
2008-06-26T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	do that.. perhaps the svn is temporarily broken or something
2008-06-26T03:12:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	did you apt-get the source or did yout firefox-get the source?
2008-06-26T03:12:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	I downloaded it from the gthumb site
2008-06-26T03:12:00.000Z	Mouzz	Slart	Thanks for the hlep
2008-06-26T03:13:00.000Z	Slart	Mouzz	you're welcome
