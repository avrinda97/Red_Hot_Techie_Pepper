2009-01-17T03:10:00.000Z	silentContender		Sorry to interrupt, but can someone help me get internet. Using a Trendnet USB Adapter (have connection, but no internet)
2009-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	ksnake	silentContender	I had issues with this
2009-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	ksnake		it wireless connection?
2009-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	silentContender		Yes, It uses RTL8187B chipset.
2009-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	ksnake	silentContender	try it with NO security at all and see if it connects
2009-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	ksnake	silentContender	just to check it
2009-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	silentContender		No security does not work.  My lsmod list rtl8187 and I think my wireless driver is rtl8187b (model # tew-424ub)
2009-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	ksnake		hmmm
2009-01-17T03:13:00.000Z	ksnake	silentContender	let me go check my settings on my main rig, on my old PII 300 now
2009-01-17T03:13:00.000Z	silentContender		Okay
2009-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	silentContender		Does anyone else know why a wireless USB has a connection but no internet?
2009-01-17T03:18:00.000Z	silentContender		It give destination host unreachable
2009-01-17T03:18:00.000Z	silentContender		Trendnet USB wireless USB ieee802.11b/g (model no. TEW-424UB)
2009-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	silentContender	stormblue	test currently with a open network
2009-01-17T03:21:00.000Z	silentContender	stormblue	 I am on the same network on my laptop (I using it now).  It's my desktop that's using the usb
2009-01-17T03:21:00.000Z	silentContender	stormblue	the driver module load is rtl8187, but I think my chipset is rtl8187b
2009-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	silentContender	stormblue	both are ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	silentContender	stormblue	how would I load the rtl8187b driver instead of rtl8187
2009-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	silentContender		slart: the usb wireless is recognized
2009-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	silentContender		Have to go. I'll look into loading the right module
2009-01-17T03:29:00.000Z	ksnake	silentContender	mine isnt based off intel, have u checked all the forums for hardware compatability, and what exacly happens when u turn it on?
