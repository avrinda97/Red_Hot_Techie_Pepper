2009-02-08T17:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	if you're going to show them to someone, try http://paste.ubuntu.com
2009-02-08T17:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	like what kind of errors?
2009-02-08T17:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	there might be some things in /var/log
2009-02-08T17:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	most log files are kept in /var/log
2009-02-08T17:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	each of the files there contains logs
2009-02-08T17:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	it depends on which errors you want to look for
2009-02-08T17:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	then look in every file
2009-02-08T17:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	dpkg.log and the other files named like it contain the logs of installed/removed packages
2009-02-08T17:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	you may also want to check auth.log
2009-02-08T17:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	that contains commands run with sudo
2009-03-02T17:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	tavi	a .bin runs itself in most cases
