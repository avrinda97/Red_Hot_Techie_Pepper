2008-05-26T01:25:00.000Z	wthex		Need help with remote disk access.
2008-05-26T01:25:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	?
2008-05-26T01:25:00.000Z	wthex		I have a freeagent drive connected to another computer on my home network and would like to access it from my laptop.
2008-05-26T01:26:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	is the drive/folder shared out?
2008-05-26T01:26:00.000Z	wthex		That is one of the problems I not sure how to set permission.
2008-05-26T01:27:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	what os is the remote computer running?
2008-05-26T01:27:00.000Z	wthex		Linux... Ubuntu (hardy)
2008-05-26T01:29:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	go to the remote computer, open a file browser, select the top level folder you want to share, right click and share
2008-05-26T01:29:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	or you could use ssh to access the the remote computer
2008-05-26T01:30:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	sudo aptitude install ssh
2008-05-26T01:30:00.000Z	wthex	thehurley	when I do that I get an error
2008-05-26T01:30:00.000Z	thehurley		and the error is?
2008-05-26T01:30:00.000Z	wthex		                 'net' usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: cannot open usershare directory /var/lib/samba/usershares. Error Permission denied. You do not have permission to create a suershare. Ask your administrator to grant you permissions to create a share.
2008-05-26T01:34:00.000Z	wthex	thehurley	I will also need to be able to access that disk from  a Vista OS.
2008-05-26T01:36:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	sorry, i'm unsure what the problem is
2008-05-26T01:37:00.000Z	wthex	thehurley	thanks for your interest. I believe I need to set permissions for accessing that directory, but don't remember how (been a long time since I have run Linux)
2008-05-26T01:38:00.000Z	thehurley	wthex	you definitely installed samba?
2008-05-26T01:38:00.000Z	wthex		Yes...
2008-05-26T01:40:00.000Z	wthex	thehurley	the command 'net usershare' is samba command.
2008-05-26T01:41:00.000Z	wthex		Maybe what we should focus on is how to set permission for that folder.
2008-05-26T01:43:00.000Z	wthex	thehurley	Thanks for your interest but I have to go...
