2006-05-27T15:54:00.000Z	kettenschutz		and put the ip in a manually way
2006-05-27T15:55:00.000Z	IFlo		@ kettenschutz: I dont know what to do there...
2006-05-27T15:55:00.000Z	kettenschutz		ok u are using KDE or GNome?
2006-05-27T15:55:00.000Z	IFlo		@ kettenschutz: I tried both
2006-05-27T15:55:00.000Z	kettenschutz	IFlo	do u know which IP your router got?! normally 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1
2006-05-27T15:56:00.000Z	IFlo		192.168.0.1
2006-05-27T15:56:00.000Z	kettenschutz		then give your networkcard the IP 192.168.0.2 or 0.3 ...0.4 ...
2006-05-27T15:56:00.000Z	kettenschutz		but in KDE u have to click the administrationbutton @ the network settings first
2006-05-27T15:58:00.000Z	kettenschutz	IFlo	got i ?!
2006-05-27T15:58:00.000Z	kettenschutz		**it
2006-05-27T15:58:00.000Z	IFlo		 kettenschutz: ok, i try that later. (And it doesnt matter that i have no connection to my router)
2006-05-27T15:58:00.000Z	IFlo		?
2006-05-27T15:59:00.000Z	kettenschutz	IFlo	the Problem is, u cant have an connection to your router if it cant find your card
2006-05-27T15:59:00.000Z	kettenschutz		sometimes the DHCP mode wont work "fine", so you have to manually configure your card
2006-05-27T16:01:00.000Z	kettenschutz	IFlo	configure your networkcard for yourself at the IP: 192.168.0.2, then open a new terminal and type: ping 192.168.0.1, if your router "answers", all is good
