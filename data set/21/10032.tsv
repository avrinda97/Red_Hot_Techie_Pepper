2005-06-14T12:15:00.000Z	sorush20		and how do I access it... the only reason is that I am trying to install firefox 1.0.4, instead of 1.0.2 that is already installed with Ubuntu... and when I link the the directory /user/lib/mozilla-firefox/ I get the message that I am not allowed to install in this directory since I don't have administrative privileges.
2005-06-14T12:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorush20	you don't need 1.0.4 - the ubuntu one is up to date
2005-06-14T12:17:00.000Z	sorush20	thoreauputic	will for instance if you have firefox 1.0.2 you can not install extensions...
2005-06-14T12:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorush20	if you have issues with themes and extensions, go to about:config and edit the vendorSub string to be 1.0.4
2005-06-14T12:18:00.000Z	sorush20	thoreauputic	the problem is that I don't want to have firefox released form Ubuntu I wanted to have it installed from source from Mozilla.
2005-06-14T12:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorush20	why?
