2006-03-23T17:47:00.000Z	LeonWP		I'm looking for a windows-like gnome theme for my dad.. can somebody help me?
2006-03-23T17:48:00.000Z	albacker	LeonWP	you want to make your dad think he's using windows ?!
2006-03-23T17:49:00.000Z	LeonWP	albacker	it just should be very user-friendly to an windows-user, 'cause i want him to migrate to ubuntu..
2006-03-23T17:49:00.000Z	albacker	LeonWP	all themes do the same job, they just change colors, and forms [rectangular,..]  of some objects.. they dont change the way linux works !
2006-03-23T17:52:00.000Z	LeonWP	albacker	i mean things like these: http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/download/553/       http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/download/583/
