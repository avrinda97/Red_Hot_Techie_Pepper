2007-02-08T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	java__	(agree with cradek) and it's for an ancient kernel version
2007-02-08T13:31:00.000Z	soundray	java__	what kind of modem is it, and how is it connected to your computer?
2007-02-08T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	java__	no, it isn't
2007-02-08T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	java__	if it's PCI it's internal. If it's external, then it's serial or USB.
2007-02-08T13:33:00.000Z	soundray	java__	do you know which chipset it uses?
2007-02-08T13:35:00.000Z	soundray	java__	those are horrible devices. I suggest you get a proper external modem.
2007-02-08T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	java__	you could buy a driver for it from http://www.linuxant.com
2007-02-08T13:37:00.000Z	java__	soundray	i cant get external modem in these days i need to make the one ihave to work
2007-02-08T13:37:00.000Z	soundray	java__	well, I guess it's linuxant, then.
2007-02-08T13:38:00.000Z	java__	soundray	dont they have any shareware or demo thing cause i am living in middle east and i am student so dont have master card which means i cant paythem
2007-02-08T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	java__	they have a crippled version for free. Please read the site.
2007-02-08T13:40:00.000Z	java__	soundray	thanks
