2009-09-14T03:37:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	have you posted your crontab?
2009-09-14T03:37:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	No, I can if you want to see it.
2009-09-14T04:05:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	the forw. slash is redundant
2009-09-14T04:06:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	The trailing CR?
2009-09-14T04:10:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	Can I just enter a blank line in in vim after my entry, or do I need to put in some kind of special character?
2009-09-14T04:10:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	just hit enter like you would for a new line.
2009-09-14T04:11:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	Not likely, since I dont know what you mean?
2009-09-14T04:11:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	*/2 * * * * python /home/username/mypy/test/test.py
2009-09-14T04:12:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	can you pastebin the entire crontab file? Or is that it? One line?
2009-09-14T04:13:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	Its just the one line, the one before it is commented out #m h d .. etc.
2009-09-14T04:13:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	no wonder it doesn't work
2009-09-14T04:14:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	Do you know what I need to add?
2009-09-14T04:15:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	at the min you need SHELL=/bin/bash at the top of the file
2009-09-14T04:16:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	and you need to set your display: DISPLAY=0.0
2009-09-14T04:18:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	and a PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/sbin line
2009-09-14T04:18:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	Weird that none of the tuorials mention adding SHELL and PATH
2009-09-14T04:21:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	put > /home/cron.log at the end of the entry to get some idea of what cron is saying.
2009-09-14T04:25:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	you didn't specify the path to python.
2009-09-14T04:26:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	do you have the variables now?
2009-09-14T08:59:00.000Z	RHorse	felixsulla	you have your headers ok in your crontab like I explained?
2009-09-14T08:59:00.000Z	felixsulla	RHorse	I didnt do anything with headers, none of the tutorials or cron pages I read say anything about them?
