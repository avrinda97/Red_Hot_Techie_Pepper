2011-12-27T11:30:00.000Z	jen		i have it downloaded
2011-12-27T11:31:00.000Z	jen		I know this sounds dumb but how do I do that? with winetricks?
2011-12-27T11:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	don't you have to pay for the software?
2011-12-27T11:37:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	software center should have 'wine', you would need wine to install your app(the win one), the installing would be as easy as clicking on the d/l, assuming wine is configured
2011-12-27T11:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	configuring wine is as simple as clicking on 'configure wine' , accept the defaults for now
2011-12-27T11:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	assuming you have the traditional web browser on ubuntu the d/l is in 'Downloads'
2011-12-27T11:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	use the file browser to get to Download, find the app, click/double-click on the app, wine should take over
2011-12-27T11:42:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	close it, right-click on the app, open-with 'wine.......???' forget the whole line
2011-12-27T11:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	right click on the file
2011-12-27T11:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	when you do, do you see options? one of those 'properties'?
2011-12-27T11:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	this may be just a lesson on wine, cause once wine takes over the output if not what you expect I can't help you with
2011-12-27T11:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	when I say 'file browser' I mean the file look at thingy that comes with ubuntu, not within a webbrowser
2011-12-27T11:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	yeah? meaning you found 'nautilus' <that's what its called, the file-browser
2011-12-27T11:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	I am assuming you are on a gnome/unity box, yes?
2011-12-27T11:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	install what?
2011-12-27T11:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	so you got wine to go into the install process?
2011-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	thanks for sharing, and you are now on your own, wine is not perfect, and your windows software I have no clue about
2011-12-27T11:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	really, use gimp! I hear it's the best
2011-12-27T11:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	the win thing you got is crap ware in comparison
2011-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	I am thinking gimp has 'fur' brushes too, all the animal skin ones
2011-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	jen	that's why you need to spend time in #gimp, rather than here
