2006-04-05T10:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	can you boot with the live CD ?
2006-04-05T10:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	it may not be the disk but the mother board or ram
2006-04-05T10:43:00.000Z	Chris_	ompaul	i had it working before installed sucessfully
2006-04-05T10:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	have you gotten to the point where there is a terminal?
2006-04-05T11:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	let me read what is on the screen
2006-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	first off redo the >sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg< you can do this with a single up arrow in the terminal you are in *if* it is the last command you used if not you can repeat until you get the same command line once executed start
2006-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	okay restart
2006-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	Chris_	ompaul	all set
2006-04-05T11:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	 when you get to choose a card type choose VESA
2006-04-05T11:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	don't choose any
2006-04-05T11:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	other than the one I pointed at
2006-04-05T11:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	just default the rest
2006-04-05T11:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	just default the rest
2006-04-05T11:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	no

2006-04-05T11:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	no I have been around for one or two grey hairs
2006-04-05T11:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Chris_	if you want to use that card read this three times first -- :-) there are multiple options make sure you understand them - if you get lost at least you can get back with vesa  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
