2008-01-19T01:12:00.000Z	TheFool		what command would I use to mount a samba share overtop my existing file system?
2008-01-19T01:13:00.000Z	TheFool		I just want to mix my mounted /bin with my actual /bin etc
2008-01-19T01:15:00.000Z	TheFool		wow this room is full I don't see how anyone can carry on a conversation in this lol

2008-01-19T01:16:00.000Z	TheFool		so any not so busy channel I could go to for my question, the ##linux channel only has a few people none of which are answering
2008-01-19T01:16:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	trying to add permanently or temproarily an SMB FS?
2008-01-19T01:17:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	whichever is easiest :)
2008-01-19T01:17:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	I would prefer permanent
2008-01-19T01:17:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	have you setup an entry for the fs in fstab?
2008-01-19T01:18:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	if you do, you can automount it every time
2008-01-19T01:19:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	yea, but I want it to overlay my existing filesystem and I am not sure how to do that one
2008-01-19T01:19:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	when you say "overlay the existing stuff" - I am not following - sorry
2008-01-19T01:19:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	ok I will try to explain, as I am not sure what the correct terminology is
2008-01-19T01:20:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	basically my mount has an etc and a bin folder with a bunch of stuff in it. When I mount it I want the stuff in the mounted etc and bin folder to be merged with the stuff in my filesystems /etc and /bin folder
2008-01-19T01:22:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	do you understand?
2008-01-19T01:23:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	was trying to chat privately - but don't think that will happen - that's asking sambe to make two filesystems one on two different mount points
2008-01-19T01:24:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	mount points tell the kernel what files are, where they are located etc. and Samba won't merge files like that AFAIK
2008-01-19T01:25:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	from what I was told it is possible, if samba won't mount it like that afayk then how would I go about achieving the same affect with symlinks?
2008-01-19T01:28:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	I am not sure - I am not aware of mounting two drives into one filesystem dynamically for the /etc/ and /bin directories though Samba, nor am I sure what would be the point of doing that. What is it that this would give you?
2008-01-19T01:32:00.000Z	ctalk	TheFool	OK - I'd suggest someone else as the best expert then, I haven't played around with JEOS version of Ubuntu a'tall
2008-01-19T01:35:00.000Z	TheFool	ctalk	alright, thanks though. btw I am definitely not using jeos...it is FAR too large. I just came here because it is a general linux question with a specific application and the ubuntu folks are really good at helping people out
