2005-07-23T05:04:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	why dont you save the file as .doc
2005-07-23T05:05:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	because i lose some of the important formatting.
2005-07-23T05:05:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	maybe save as PDF
2005-07-23T05:05:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	if i save as pdf, can they edit the pdf if they so choose?
2005-07-23T05:06:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	what type of formatting do you you lose when saving as .doc?
2005-07-23T05:07:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	some table formatting. What I would like to have in the top of the column 2 goes to the bottom of column 1. In might be easier if you see the documents yourself. Would you like to see them?
2005-07-23T05:08:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	I understand what you are talking about.  Do they have to edit the document?
2005-07-23T05:09:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	well, i'd like them to make changes if they think it can be made any prettier.
2005-07-23T05:10:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	have you actually open the document in word after saving with OOo?
2005-07-23T05:10:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	no what i did was save the file as a doc. then i opened it in open office.
2005-07-23T05:11:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	i don't have any msoffice apps on my computer.
2005-07-23T05:11:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	if you have word, send it to your co-workers and see if they loose anything.  I would do it for you but I hate booting into windows :)
2005-07-23T05:12:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	okay. i'll just send them the file in word .doc format and the reliable pdf format.
2005-07-23T05:12:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	thanks for your ears.
2005-07-23T05:13:00.000Z	concept10	orangerange	you should also suggest for them to install OOo
2005-07-23T05:13:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	i guess i could do that. whether they'll bother to, i doubt it. 8-)
2005-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	OOo stands for Open Office what?
2005-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	orangerange	concept10	gotcha
