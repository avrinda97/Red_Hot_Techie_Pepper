2010-04-03T18:06:00.000Z	comfy		Hmm... not quite sure what I'm looking for in the listed process, but nothing seems to contain "firefox"
2010-04-03T18:07:00.000Z	comfy		Hmm... I think I'll have to reinstall again
2010-04-03T18:07:00.000Z	comfy		Thanks everyone
2010-04-03T18:08:00.000Z	ubutom3	comfy	try ps aux | grep firefox
2010-04-03T18:09:00.000Z	ubutom3		reboot and reinstall *g*
2010-04-03T18:09:00.000Z	comfy		restored my bookmarks, but then bookmark-organizing library is empty, even though the drop down menu shows bookmarks
2010-04-03T18:10:00.000Z	comfy		so I tried to delete ******.defaults files in firefox profile folder
2010-04-03T18:10:00.000Z	comfy		the folder is something like ~/.mozilla/firefox (found info online)
2010-04-03T18:10:00.000Z	ubutom3		xxxx.default is your profile
2010-04-03T18:11:00.000Z	comfy		yeah, it was suggested on some pages that several bookmark issues are related to the profile
2010-04-03T18:11:00.000Z	comfy		so I tried to delete that
2010-04-03T18:12:00.000Z	comfy		then for some reason, i thought it would be good to complete remove and reinstall firefox at that point :(
2010-04-03T18:12:00.000Z	ubutom3		removing firefox wont remove your profile
2010-04-03T18:13:00.000Z	comfy	ubutom3	yeah, that i figured out from trial and error :P
2010-04-03T18:13:00.000Z	comfy		hmm I only backup bookmarks with Xmarks
2010-04-03T18:13:00.000Z	ubutom3	comfy	yeah, the profile resides in .mozilla/firefox or so
2010-04-03T18:14:00.000Z	comfy		yikes @@~
2010-04-03T18:14:00.000Z	comfy		I might consider giving up on firefox for good, and finally try chrome. This is actually the second time
2010-04-03T18:14:00.000Z	ubutom3	comfy	I copied my firefox profile from windows to linux and the other way around, I just put it in the profile folder and changed the file profile.ini or whats it called
2010-04-03T18:15:00.000Z	comfy		that it's happenedn, I don't remember what I did last time though
2010-04-03T18:15:00.000Z	ubutom3	comfy	sometimes the problems start with wrong permissions on the profile
