2011-11-04T10:49:00.000Z	tp43		I would like to do some flash development on Linux, is it possible?
2011-11-04T10:49:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	certainly.
2011-11-04T10:49:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	great, can you forward me somewhere to get started?
2011-11-04T10:49:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	well, i just wanted to simple stuff for webdesign
2011-11-04T10:50:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	But, you can certainly use eclipse if you want a full-blown IDE.
2011-11-04T10:50:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	yeah true that so had a good experience, did it cost money?
2011-11-04T10:51:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	well, no I dont want to go full blown for now, just a little bit
2011-11-04T10:51:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	Google up some flash development archives for ubuntu in google, you'll get hundreds of results.
2011-11-04T10:52:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	ok
2011-11-04T10:52:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	http://www.williambrownstreet.net/wordpress/?p=78 -> will guide you through most of it using a simple text editor, gedit.
2011-11-04T10:52:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	yeah, I don't know the difference, the flash site is overwhelming, and installing their prodcuts on linux is  pain
2011-11-04T10:53:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	thanks for the link. I would prefer to stick to text editors
2011-11-04T10:53:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	check out sublime text 2 - bad ass text editor
2011-11-04T10:54:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	really, good for html, css, php, and flash?  Cause I've been using emacs, and its freezing on me when switch away and back for some reason
2011-11-04T10:54:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	emacs..ugh...talk about old and out-dated.
2011-11-04T10:55:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	I do a lot of ruby/rails and metasploit development.  It'll conquer just about anything.
2011-11-04T10:55:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	check out sublime.  It's retarded awesome.
2011-11-04T10:57:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	let me put it this way, about 2 months in its alpa state the editor was far superior then most products which have been on the shelf for years.
2011-11-04T11:05:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	see the download link at http://www.williambrownstreet.net/wordpress/?p=78 for the flex sdk, it's dead now it seems, there's no Linux version there anymore
2011-11-04T11:06:00.000Z	fleixius	tp43	It's probably outdated.  You'll have to do some old fashion research.
2011-11-04T11:07:00.000Z	tp43	fleixius	lets see what stuff you do with ruby/rails
