2007-08-30T13:33:00.000Z	_tux		especially if you don't know what your doing or if a user gains access to the root account
2007-08-30T13:33:00.000Z	_tux		when in XP you gain complete control over the Admin account which in turn Ubuntu doesn't give you that much power by default
2007-08-30T13:34:00.000Z	_tux		you can easily kill off the 15 minute limit sudo sets using "sudo -k"
2007-08-30T13:35:00.000Z	_tux		not going to completely type out an entire documentation on how sudo works and how the root account works
2007-08-30T13:37:00.000Z	_tux		On Unix-like operating systems, the sudo command is used to run commands with the root user's privileges. This is done by entering sudo at the beginning of each line of commands. Alternatively, one may become root (system administrator) by logging in as "root" or by using the su command.
2007-08-30T13:37:00.000Z	_tux		there
2007-08-30T13:38:00.000Z	_tux		goddwinonline: By default the Linux kernel as a built-in firewall called netfilter though uses the iptables program for a configuration of netfilter though there are GUIs like Firestarter to configure the firewall for ease of use
2007-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	_tux		iptables just acts as the framework
2007-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	_tux		you can define rules from within iptables
2007-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	_tux		though it is pretty complicated
2007-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	sort of
2007-08-30T13:40:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	there are books i'd need to master iptables.
2007-08-30T13:40:00.000Z	_tux	firecraft	for the novice/beginner I would agree but someone with experience differs completely
2007-08-30T13:41:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	of course.
2007-08-30T13:42:00.000Z	_tux	firecraft	Neither have I just leave it at default
2007-08-30T13:42:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	on top of which i have zorp installed ;p
2007-08-30T13:45:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	i didn't realize sql injection mattered to linux box
2007-08-30T13:46:00.000Z	_tux	firecraft	it doesn't but if you are going to be using a server and use either MySQL or PostgreSQL than its pretty much a big deal
2007-08-30T13:47:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	i do have mysql installed to all fairness, how does that leave me vulnerable ?
2007-08-30T13:48:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	thanks and i thought, iptables and zorp then running mysql on localhost only wouldn't give out much security holes.
2007-08-30T13:51:00.000Z	firecraft	_tux	i have a feeling we'll see wine in the coming months mature a great deal and not depend on Windows OS for gaming.
