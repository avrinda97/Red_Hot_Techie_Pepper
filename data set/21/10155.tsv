2005-04-30T12:40:00.000Z	osh		My media player sais it can't decode an mpeg stream. That can't be right. Do I need some extra libs or something?
2005-04-30T12:41:00.000Z	osh		totem-xine it is. thanks for the hint.
2005-04-30T12:43:00.000Z	osh		zugot: noted. totem-xine doesn't seem to exist for 64 yet...
2005-04-30T12:43:00.000Z	b2s	osh	yes it does
2005-04-30T12:43:00.000Z	osh	b2s	it does? do I have to add something to apt to find it?
2005-04-30T12:44:00.000Z	b2s	osh	it might be in universe...
2005-04-30T12:45:00.000Z	osh	b2s	Sorry. I don't know what "universe" is. Can you give a link so I can read up on it?
2005-04-30T12:45:00.000Z	b2s	osh	it is a configuration option in synaptic, or you can edit sources.list
2005-04-30T12:46:00.000Z	osh	b2s	Thanks. Amazing what a little info can do.
2005-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	b2s	osh	yep :) so far I've only found one avi that doesn't play under amd64... I assume I just need some other codec, but I can play divx, wmv, mov, dvd, etc
2005-04-30T12:49:00.000Z	osh	b2s	Since you're so good at this. Do you happen to know what package to install to get the sound to work too?
2005-04-30T12:50:00.000Z	b2s	osh	sound for what?
2005-04-30T12:51:00.000Z	osh	b2s	I have no sound at all.
2005-04-30T12:51:00.000Z	b2s	osh	:/ sound worked out of the box for me.  what sort of sound card do you have?
2005-04-30T12:53:00.000Z	osh	b2s	audigy2. thought perhaps the alsamixer might help but it hasn't so far. I can hear the speakers "tap" when alsa is started but once logged in I have no sound.
2005-04-30T12:54:00.000Z	b2s	osh	and it seems during boot that the audigy2 is detected?  I'd expect that to work in amd64...
2005-04-30T12:56:00.000Z	b2s	osh	have you checked all the tabs in alsamixer?  It seems that it should work OK
2005-04-30T12:57:00.000Z	b2s	osh	in particular, it seems "Audigy Analog/Digital Output Jack" might need to be disabled.
2005-04-30T12:58:00.000Z	osh	b2s	analog output jack is disabled. what am I looking for in dmesg? is audigy tagged as something else perhaps?
2005-04-30T12:59:00.000Z	osh	b2s	"all tabs in alsamixer". That's quite a lot... ;-)
2005-04-30T12:59:00.000Z	b2s	osh	heh, that's just what I've heard.  I don't have an audigy2, as this is an amd64 laptop
