2005-04-15T08:41:00.000Z	estebandido		happy monday!
2005-04-15T08:42:00.000Z	estebandido		so... i'm trying to install hoary on a g5... has anyone pulled this off?
2005-04-15T08:42:00.000Z	estebandido		my problem is that it won't boot from the CD
2005-04-15T08:43:00.000Z	estebandido		i checked the md5
2005-04-15T08:43:00.000Z	estebandido		yes
2005-04-15T08:44:00.000Z	estebandido		i also tried the option trick
2005-04-15T08:44:00.000Z	estebandido		the computer simply doesn't recognize the CD as bootable
2005-04-15T08:45:00.000Z	Florob	estebandido	good we don't have to ask you if you unpacked it with winrar :)
2005-04-15T08:45:00.000Z	estebandido		lol
2005-04-15T08:45:00.000Z	estebandido		nope, gunzip
2005-04-15T08:47:00.000Z	estebandido		is there some file that sits at the top level of the CD? i thought i remembered one from the i386 version, but i don't see it on the mac version
2005-04-15T08:51:00.000Z	Florob	estebandido	err... you weren't serious about gunzip were you? anyway i386 does have 3 file at the top level: md5sum.txt ubuntu README.diskdefines
2005-04-15T08:51:00.000Z	Florob		But those shouldn't be relevant for booting.
2005-04-15T08:52:00.000Z	estebandido	Florob	i don't even remember at this point. the important thing is the md5 checks out
2005-04-15T08:52:00.000Z	estebandido	Florob	and yes, i see those files
2005-04-15T08:53:00.000Z	estebandido	Florob	maybe i burned it wrong... are you supposed to burn the .iso file itsef, or open it up and burn the contents?
2005-04-15T08:54:00.000Z	estebandido		ah... that must be the problem
2005-04-15T08:54:00.000Z	estebandido		thanks
2005-04-15T08:55:00.000Z	Florob	estebandido	you are supposed to burn the file itself (this is the reason you shouldn't extract it with winrar), but you shouldn't burn it as in copy the .iso file to the cd. you should burn it as image file.
2005-04-15T08:56:00.000Z	estebandido	Florob	how do i burn an image in mac os 10.3?
2005-04-15T08:57:00.000Z	Florob	estebandido	don't ask me i have not yet saved up for a mac :) Try to google for it.
