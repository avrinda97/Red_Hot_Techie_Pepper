2009-04-19T00:14:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		I had a quick question that I probably read over twice;  Is it normal for things to not execute (firefox, apps, etc) while I'm downloading/installing the distribution upgrade to 8.10 from 8.04?
2009-04-19T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	if you try running firefox while it's getting updated I would expect strange things to happen
2009-04-19T00:16:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	nah.. I don't think so.. just leave the poor computer alone while it updates =)
2009-04-19T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	because most games are written for windows
2009-04-19T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	don't expect to run the latest titles at full speed on your shiny linux computer
2009-04-19T00:27:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	some stuff works using wine but usually considerably slower
2009-04-19T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	that doesn't mean that there aren't games available for linux.. there are plenty.. just not quite as many as for windows
2009-04-19T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	I don't think it would improve things
2009-04-19T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	I think more like your wine install would stop working... but I'm just guessing
2009-04-19T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	not really, no
2009-04-19T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	it's a little different.. but barely noticable
2009-04-19T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	try them both... see which one you like
2009-04-19T03:23:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	you could also take a look at quassel.. it's brand new so it might lack some features.. but it's still nice
2009-04-19T14:26:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	try "chmod a+x thefile.run", then "./thefile.run"
2009-04-19T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	case sensitive? AtiDdriver isn't the same as atidriver.run
2009-04-19T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	case sensitive? AtiDriver.run isn't the same as atidriver.run
2009-04-19T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	lspci | grep vga ?
2009-04-19T15:23:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	lspci, lsusb and lshw are the ones I know of
2009-04-19T15:23:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	but the grep part is just for filtering the results
2009-04-19T16:31:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	I would suggesting something like python.. or take a look at mono, the linux implementation of .net
2009-04-19T18:02:00.000Z	Slart	PROject-Emerald	tried Applications, accessories, Character Map ?
