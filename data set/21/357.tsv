2012-07-26T15:36:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	I didn't get that one either?  Must be a Windows problem?  ;-)

2012-07-26T15:37:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: i need to update my lenovoB570e BIOS is this save form my PC ?
2012-07-26T15:39:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	BIOS updates usually have a backup and checksum before being commited into the active ROM.
2012-07-26T15:46:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	SATA to CF or SD adapter?
2012-07-26T15:47:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: i will google that
2012-07-26T15:50:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: it's memory SD card
2012-07-26T15:51:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: i put an ISO on that SD card, and now i want to boot from it
2012-07-26T15:51:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	 I have not tried an SD card but I have an ATA to CF adapter and that works fine - I would assume SD can be addressed in the same way with a ATA or SATA to SD adapter?
2012-07-26T15:52:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: i will try that
2012-07-26T15:55:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	Just google SATA to SD adapter. There are loads of them for quite cheap costs. The SD card wil appear as a standard SATA drive in your BIOS. However, be aware SD has limited writes so for data use a traditional drive or a solid state designed for this purpose. The SD should be fine for an OS boot partition.
2012-07-26T15:56:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	I have sent you a link to an adapter for sale on a large commercial website!
2012-07-26T15:57:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: thank its word in virtual box - SD to USB -
2012-07-26T15:59:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: word = work > sorry <
2012-07-26T16:00:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	You want to boot a virtual machine in Virtual Box using an OS based on an SD card plugged into your USB???  I have no idea if that would work, I assume its something that must be supported in the Virtual Box hypervisor?
2012-07-26T16:02:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: i was testing the SD to USB kit on the VMware and it work for me, i assume it will work for real :)
2012-07-26T16:03:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	Yes for real it will be quite slick.  I built a workstation with no moving parts once using a similar method.
2012-07-26T16:05:00.000Z	admin_	njaxx	: that is what i am trying to do "a workstation with no moving parts"
2012-07-26T16:07:00.000Z	njaxx	admin_	Let us know how you get on with your design - write a blog post.
