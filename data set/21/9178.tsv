2006-10-06T13:49:00.000Z	jenda	mneptok	thx - a friend is installing a USB modem and needs that... seems he found it.
2006-10-06T13:50:00.000Z	mneptok	jenda	the values they input should be given to them by their ISP/telco
2006-10-06T13:50:00.000Z	jenda	mneptok	check. thanks.
2006-10-06T13:50:00.000Z	mneptok	jenda	those values must be exactly right to negotiate a connection at the DSLAM and out to the cloud.
2006-10-06T13:51:00.000Z	mneptok	jenda	precisely.
2006-10-06T13:52:00.000Z	mneptok	jenda	call ISP. ask for second level support (because the first level mouth breathers won't know jack) and get them to give you those values for what their DSLAM expects.

2007-01-19T17:00:00.000Z	jenda	mneptok	great... and the location?

2007-01-19T17:04:00.000Z	mneptok	jenda	~/ = your home
