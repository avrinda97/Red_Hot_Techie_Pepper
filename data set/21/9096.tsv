2005-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	bonbon		when i run the dpkg command or the tar -xf command it says "no c compiler found"
2005-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	bonbon		not writeable is fine
2005-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	bonbon		i download in my big windows partition, just want to read mp3s and other files so I can listen to mymusic
2005-11-15T12:22:00.000Z	bonbon		and i get a message that says "E: INvalid Operation"
2005-11-15T12:22:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-11-15T12:43:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	replace it
2005-11-15T12:44:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	yup, better to put it at the end of the file
2005-11-15T12:45:00.000Z	bonbon	Belutz	ok, now it says already mounted Is that right?
2005-11-15T12:46:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	unmount it first, sudo umount /mnt/win
2005-11-15T12:46:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	then mount it again, sudo mount -a
2005-11-15T12:48:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	sudo umount /mnt/win <-- it unmount the ntfs partition
2005-11-15T12:48:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	sudo mount -a <--- remount all partition in /etc/fstab
2005-11-15T12:48:00.000Z	bonbon	Belutz	the line we put in fstab
2005-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	Belutz	bonbon	it's not too complicated, but my english is not that good, so i recommend you to read it yourself by typing man mount
2005-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	bonbon	Belutz	so far your english has been quite good, what is your native tongue?
