2009-12-17T12:51:00.000Z	cyberjorge		how do I find my CDROM path and mount it for use?
2009-12-17T12:51:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	personal message me!  I can help you :)
2009-12-17T12:54:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	please show me my cdrom :)
2009-12-17T12:54:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	Fire up a terminal and cd to /dev
2009-12-17T12:55:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	Are you running a graphical version of ubuntu or is the server?
2009-12-17T12:55:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	minimal install and only fluxbux installed
2009-12-17T12:56:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	So it doesn't automatically mount the cd for you right?
2009-12-17T12:56:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	yes :(
2009-12-17T12:56:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	tried dmesg but i get confused with the proper path
2009-12-17T12:56:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	no worries,  first you need to cd to /dev and type ls to get a list of the files in there.  If you have only 1 cd-drive it should show up as a file named "cdrom" or something similar
2009-12-17T12:57:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	ok
2009-12-17T12:57:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	Think you found it?
2009-12-17T12:57:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	yes! cdrom
2009-12-17T12:58:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	Ok cool.  Now you need to make a file somewhere that is appropriate to mount he cd drive into.  The customary place is inside /media.  I suggest you "sudo mkdir /media/cd" or something similar.
2009-12-17T13:00:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	in the context of this, http://tinyurl.com/yanfvv3 can i just change "xvdd" to cdrom?
2009-12-17T13:01:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	This is getting thick! :)  Do you have a /mnt/xs-tools folder?  That looks correct other than that detail.
2009-12-17T13:02:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	seems to work man! yes I have that already. Problem now is that Ubuntu is not supported. :( that's another topic
2009-12-17T13:02:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	C
2009-12-17T13:02:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	Good luck man!  I'm glad I could help :)
2009-12-17T13:03:00.000Z	cyberjorge	edbian	yes thank you very much! ;) ls did he trick
2009-12-17T13:03:00.000Z	edbian	cyberjorge	Anytime
