2009-04-04T11:36:00.000Z	HawkLion		Can anyone help a newbie set up Ubuntu to connect to the Internet?
2009-04-04T11:38:00.000Z	HawkLion		I just installed Ubuntu but for some reason it's not detecting my Internet.  Any thoughts?
2009-04-04T11:39:00.000Z	HawkLion		Cables are plugged -seems like Ubuntu detects my ethernet card, but it seems like I'm missing something here...
2009-04-04T11:40:00.000Z	ghindo	HawkLion	Are you using a router?  Do other machines work on this network?
2009-04-04T11:42:00.000Z	HawkLion	ghindo	 do you think my disconnect has to do with my Linksys router?
2009-04-04T11:42:00.000Z	ghindo	HawkLion	If your other machine is working fine, then probably not.  I was just asking to get more details.
2009-04-04T11:43:00.000Z	ghindo	HawkLion	Try opening up a terminal on the machine that doesn't work and write ping "google.com" and let me know what you get back
2009-04-04T11:44:00.000Z	HawkLion	ghindo	 OK, just a sec...
2009-04-04T11:45:00.000Z	HawkLion	ghindo	 ping: unknown host google.com
2009-04-04T11:47:00.000Z	ghindo	HawkLion	Hrm.  What makes you think that Ubuntu detects your ethernet card?
2009-04-04T11:48:00.000Z	HawkLion	ghindo	 went to System>Administration>Hardware Drivers
2009-04-04T11:49:00.000Z	ghindo	HawkLion	What happens when you click on NetworkManager?

2009-04-04T11:51:00.000Z	ghindo	HawkLion	What happens when you type "ifconfig" into the terminal?
