2011-08-13T17:47:00.000Z	ubunta		IF My problem With BusyBox13.3 Is unsolved Please Tell Me so i stop Searching ;) ;) ;)
2011-08-13T17:48:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	you should be getting an error message when you're thrown into BusyBox - are you getting one?
2011-08-13T17:49:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	Nops ;) No Error Just the initframs console
2011-08-13T17:50:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	without more details about what's going on, there's not a lot of help anyone can provide - looks like you're aware of common reasons for getting put into BusyBox
2011-08-13T17:53:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	this happened after a fsck ( with another linux distro in another partition
2011-08-13T17:54:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	or maybe  disk check
2011-08-13T17:54:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	can you provide more details about what you did? step-by-step?
2011-08-13T17:54:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	I only work in the channel - sorry ;-)
2011-08-13T17:56:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	i made an fsck or something that checks for disk sectors and all ... it was  going to take a very long time ... like it didn't want to stop checking sectors and all .. so i stopped it ! it was mainly for a problem with a colored screen when booting to the sgn in  (sometimes)
2011-08-13T17:57:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	if you're multibooting (which is what it sounds like), can you boot into any of the other options?
2011-08-13T17:58:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	(and for future reference - don't stop a fsck or similar process ;-) )
2011-08-13T17:58:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	: i'm in a whole other partition but i can boot documents ( mount ) from the ubuntu disk
2011-08-13T17:59:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	: say sorry from me to ubuntu :(:(
2011-08-13T18:01:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	if I were you, I would boot into a live CD (or another Linux distro on your machine if you have one) and run fsck again (and let it finish)
2011-08-13T18:11:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	: like fsck -l /dec/sda1
2011-08-13T18:14:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	I would try 'e2fsck -f /dev/sda1' - assuming that /dev/sda1 is where Ubuntu lives
2011-08-13T18:15:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	: i think i made this not working .. is their a solution for like making it with inframs ?
2011-08-13T18:16:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	if your system is that borked, I would recommend backing up your data and reinstalling - it's probably faster and easier if you're fairly new to this
2011-08-13T18:21:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	: Ok i'll make it ;) i don't need backups i just want a new OS ! Like for movies and all ;) How To reinstall (do i have to format from windows ? )
2011-08-13T18:24:00.000Z	ubunta	yeats	: what version of ubuntu do u suggesst ... 11.04 is a having a lot of problems !
2011-08-13T18:24:00.000Z	yeats	ubunta	I would suggest either 11.04 or 10.04
