2007-12-18T05:23:00.000Z	nickrud	rdavila	downgrades aren't really supported, the results are "undefined"
2007-12-18T05:25:00.000Z	rdavila	nickrud	i've cancelled the upgrade with ctrl+C, then my screen freeze into: root@vocho:~# dpkg --configure -a
2007-12-18T05:26:00.000Z	nickrud	rdavila	can you run apt-get -f install  ?
2007-12-18T05:27:00.000Z	rdavila	nickrud	i give this error: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
