2006-01-07T15:29:00.000Z	TranceRiver		What wireless adapter do y ou have?
2006-01-07T15:29:00.000Z	TranceRiver		I hear it can be a bit of a hassle to get wireless working with ubuntu.
2006-01-07T15:31:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Does anyone know if the EDIMAX EW-7128G wireless adapter will work well with ubuntu?

2006-01-07T15:33:00.000Z	liable	TranceRiver	you are better off looking at the output of lspci and googling
2006-01-07T15:35:00.000Z	TranceRiver	liable	it's RT2500 and I've read that it works.
2006-01-07T15:35:00.000Z	TranceRiver		So yay!
2006-01-07T15:38:00.000Z	liable	TranceRiver	i believe theres drivers on sourceforge for those chipsets
2006-01-07T15:40:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Also. I just bought a computer today for linux. It was 100 dollars for a 933 P3, 20GB hard drive, 256mb ram, 15 inch monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Will this run ubuntu fairly well, and was this an okay purchase?
2006-01-07T15:40:00.000Z	TranceRiver		It's a gateway, not that it makes a difference.
2006-01-07T15:40:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Okay, sweet. Install breezy, right?
2006-01-07T15:42:00.000Z	TranceRiver		What's dapper?
2006-01-07T15:43:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Okay, so then how would I try it if it's not going to be released til' April?
2006-01-07T15:43:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Or would it be dapper beta?
2006-01-07T15:43:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Okay, I'd rather stick to a solid release.
2006-01-07T15:44:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Okay.
2006-01-07T15:46:00.000Z	TranceRiver		Would you guys rather have a WRT54GS 1.0 or a WRT54G 2.2?
2006-01-07T15:48:00.000Z	liable	TranceRiver	check out whirlpool forums (good info on routers and such)
