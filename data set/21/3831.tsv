2009-01-01T18:06:00.000Z	chilli0		does anyone know why ekiga does show my webcam , but easy cam doesnt?
2009-01-01T18:06:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	what kind of camera?
2009-01-01T18:06:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	have you tried Cheese?
2009-01-01T18:07:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 i have cheese and it doesnt work
2009-01-01T18:07:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	hrrm, I ask because i've had the exact same problem with the camera on my Aspire One
2009-01-01T18:08:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	is yours a "crystalcam" unit?
2009-01-01T18:08:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 i just found something odd , i looked at cheese and it says that its using the lenovo easy cam how ever it doesnt show any video
2009-01-01T18:08:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 not sure
2009-01-01T18:09:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	dmesg should list the details
2009-01-01T18:11:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 i found some stuff on it
2009-01-01T18:12:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	hrrm, beyond me i'm afraid, sorry
2009-01-01T18:14:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	plug it into another usb port?
2009-01-01T18:15:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 its on a laptop
2009-01-01T18:20:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	oh, shutdown, remove the battery and reboot, sometimes my old notebook would not redetect things until it was totally powered down
2009-01-01T18:20:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	my camera does the same thing, I think we're stuck unless you want to try cheese 2.24 which is not a package
2009-01-01T18:21:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 ?
2009-01-01T18:22:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 what is the cheese website
2009-01-01T18:23:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	http://www.gnome.org/projects/cheese
2009-01-01T18:26:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	does your camera turn around so it faces forward not just towards you?
2009-01-01T18:27:00.000Z	chilli0	lasivian	 it cant turn around
2009-01-01T18:27:00.000Z	lasivian	chilli0	then don't waste time on cheese :P
