2009-05-15T00:24:00.000Z	cameron1		I am sitting here in Live session about to install 9.04. I am going to install /home on separate partition this time. What size should I make that? I put all media on a different HDD. So, should ten gigs be enough for the time being? I have 20gigs alloted to Linux right now, total.
2009-05-15T00:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	ok partitioning
2009-05-15T00:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	what partitions do you already have on there?
2009-05-15T00:26:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	I have 320GB. 80 is Windows, 20 is 8.04, 220 is media (ntfs)
2009-05-15T00:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	do like  12GB  /    your swap space,  and   most of the  space being your home
2009-05-15T00:29:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	So 12GB as "/"  and swap, then the other 8 as my /home sound reasonable?
2009-05-15T00:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	not quite
2009-05-15T00:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	8GB for home  rather small indeed
2009-05-15T00:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	,but your going to put most data some where else anyway?
2009-05-15T00:30:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	Yeah, all of it is elsewhere on another HDD/partition.
2009-05-15T00:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	well not much point having a seperate home in your case I think
2009-05-15T00:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	also  if you don't format  a /  partition that has  home in it, w hen you re install,   home stays in tact, I been told
2009-05-15T00:32:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	Ah. I was looking to keep in on its own partition in the event I try a different distro, or for backing up purposes.
2009-05-15T00:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	right, but   it's not exaclty hard to install programs again, if you try another distro?
2009-05-15T00:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	and you can copy/backup relivant .folders anyway
2009-05-15T00:32:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	True enough
2009-05-15T00:33:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	Gotcha. I shall just go with one partition for the time being.
2009-05-15T00:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	I been meaning to clean install for a few weeks now,  plus  I am going from Ext3 to Ext4,   most of my .folders there won't be a good reason to keep.   ,but i'll back up stuff like .mozilla
2009-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	just  copy  the relivant .folders yeah
2009-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	cameron1	sebsebseb	Gotcha. Thanks for the help
2009-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cameron1	ok no problem
