2006-12-04T10:39:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Hm, I run Diablo II through wine but when I close it it just hangs and I have to kill it all the time with kill and killall using PIDs. Is there a way to get the PID of a process using a bash command and then joining that with kill so it does it automatically?
2006-12-04T10:39:00.000Z	haxality	DARKGuy	if you do 'killall wine' it should kill it
2006-12-04T10:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	it doesn't, sadly
2006-12-04T10:40:00.000Z	haxality	DARKGuy	that's very odd.
2006-12-04T10:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	It is :(. So kill -9 and kill are my only ways to kill the wine process. So I need to know how do I get the PID :P
2006-12-04T10:41:00.000Z	haxality	DARKGuy	ps aux | grep wine
2006-12-04T10:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	Yes, that's what I need to know :P
2006-12-04T10:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	ps -ax | grep 'wine' does it too
2006-12-04T10:42:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	neither do I, but it's alright :)
2006-12-04T10:42:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	Heh
2006-12-04T10:43:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	cool! what did you use?
2006-12-04T10:45:00.000Z	haxality	DARKGuy	here's what I have so far
2006-12-04T10:45:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	Oh, lemme see
2006-12-04T10:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	Hey, that was just what I was searching for ^_^
2006-12-04T10:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	you rock xD
2006-12-04T10:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	thanks :)
2006-12-04T10:47:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	heh, you're right xD... I need to get used to read them all all the time :P
2006-12-04T10:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	Hey, thanks a lot, now it's closing nicely
2006-12-04T10:53:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	If you want to know, I did "kill -9 | ps -C wineserver -o pid=" ^_^
2006-12-04T10:58:00.000Z	haxality	DARKGuy	glad I could help.
2006-12-04T10:58:00.000Z	DARKGuy	haxality	you did :)
