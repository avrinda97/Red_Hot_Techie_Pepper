2007-05-16T13:35:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		hi can someone help me figure out if my wine is working. I ran winecfg in a terminal and it says creating configuration director /directory names/.wine but it looks like its just sitting on that spot. I'm not sure if it froze or if it is still working or if it finished.
