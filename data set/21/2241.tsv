2009-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	plitter		is there a way for me to change encoding on a textfile from windows to something that pdflatex might agree to?
2009-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	decora	plitter	you can use iconv to change encodings
2009-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	plitter	decora	do i have to know what encoding it was?
2009-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	decora	plitter	yes you have to know what encoding it was. what kind of file is it?
2009-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	plitter	decora	its a tex file, i made it and my partner edited it in windows notepad and now it gives me an error when i try to latexpdf
2009-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	plitter	decora	actually its all the tex files in the project:P
2009-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	decora	plitter	what error? it might just be the 'newlines' which you can strip with dos2unix  (apt-get install tofrodos)
2009-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	decora	plitter	did your buddy use any non-ascii characters like french letters?
2009-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	decora	plitter	windows notepad probably saves in utf8 in modern windows. if you give me file i can try to detect encoding
2009-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	plitter	decora	no, but we write in norwegian, and we got a tips to change to \usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}, but then it didnt take æøå
