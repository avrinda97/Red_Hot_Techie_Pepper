2006-07-15T16:57:00.000Z	cc_		could somebody please assist me with the ppp connection problems that im having. i am trying to connect via a usb adsl modem, here is a paste of my ppp.log - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18047
2006-07-15T16:57:00.000Z	Warbo	cc_	What kind of modem?
2006-07-15T16:58:00.000Z	cc_		warbo: connexant usb adsl modem
2006-07-15T16:58:00.000Z	Warbo		OK, I have never used one of them
2006-07-15T16:58:00.000Z	cc_		war: i can get the link light stable and everything going, i just cannot seem to authenticate.
2006-07-15T16:59:00.000Z	cc_		warbo: so it isnt a modem issue, the modem is up, its a ppp communication problem
2006-07-15T05:00:00.000Z	Warbo	cc_	The modems I use handle that anyway. If the modem works then the connection will work
2006-07-15T05:00:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	 how do i specify that it must use PPPoE LLC ?
2006-07-15T05:00:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	because i beleive that is the problem
2006-07-15T05:00:00.000Z	Warbo	cc_	Is there a guide to your modem on the Wiki (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UsbAdslModem)?
2006-07-15T05:01:00.000Z	Warbo	cc_	No idea, as I said my eagle-usb one sorts that out itself (it's getting the damn thing installed in the first place which is tricky)
2006-07-15T05:01:00.000Z	cc_		warbo: and that i got perfect, ubuntu picks it all up no problem
2006-07-15T05:01:00.000Z	cc_		warbo: okay after installing the driver in the firmware folder of course
2006-07-15T05:02:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	but fact is, its there, its waiting to be connected using a working isp configuration. i just need to get a proper setup using PPPoE LLC
2006-07-15T05:03:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	i used this guide to get my modem working so that it picks up the adsl link etc. http://rajeshjayaprakash.in/conexant.html <- thats all good.
2006-07-15T05:03:00.000Z	Warbo	cc_	If you get it all working then could you write a brief guide on the Ubuntu Wiki please?
2006-07-15T05:04:00.000Z	cc_		warbo: i would certainly do so but its just the connection part that i cannot get up. that guide i pasted shows how to make ubuntu pick the modem up without any problems when plugging it in etc.
2006-07-15T05:04:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	i just need assistance making the dial script to work 100%
2006-07-15T05:05:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	ive been struggling for the past 5 hours or so.
2006-07-15T05:05:00.000Z	Warbo	cc_	As I say I don't know that stuff. I use a router on my own box and I type "sudo startadsl" on my Dad's
2006-07-15T05:05:00.000Z	cc_	Warbo	lucky :(
