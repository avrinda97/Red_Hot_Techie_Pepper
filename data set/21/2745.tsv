2009-11-10T03:49:00.000Z	Bookman	ActionParsnip	that is the source of the problem.  The solution is?
2009-11-10T03:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bookman	sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-installer flashplugin-nonfree libswfdec-0.8-0 swfdec-gnome; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree

2010-06-17T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bookman	dpkg -l | grep ati ,should find xserver-xorg-video-ati or something very similar
2010-06-18T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bookman	add an entry in startup items to run: compiz --replace

2011-08-09T02:04:00.000Z	Bookman	ActionParsnip	then maybe it is running.
2011-08-09T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bookman	what is the output of the command I gave please
2011-08-09T02:09:00.000Z	Bookman	ActionParsnip	Output is: Description: Ubuntu 11.04
2011-08-09T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bookman	I recommed you remove that driver and install nvidia-current  you should get the 270 driver
2011-08-09T02:23:00.000Z	Bookman	ActionParsnip	I'm pretty sure the driver is indeed working.  Unity is working fine.  Compiz is working great.  Sysinfo program shows that the driver is running as well.  Must be a problem with the Additional Drivers program.
2011-08-09T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bookman	if it's working then I'd go with it :)
