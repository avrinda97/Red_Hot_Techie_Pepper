2006-12-24T08:24:00.000Z	AlexC_		Hey,
2006-12-24T08:24:00.000Z	AlexC_		How can I get my ethernet address via terminal?
2006-12-24T08:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	thats usualy called a mac adress, btw :)
2006-12-24T08:27:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	yeah I thought 00:50:8D:97:19:DC that was called mac, just it was different from on Windows :P
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	the mac adress is a physacal adress imprinted to your nic. i shouldnt change with the os
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	you are most likely looking at diffrent nics
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	yeah I know, so how come they are comming up differently?
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	hum, well I'm using the on-board network on the Abit AW9D
2006-12-24T08:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	and do you have other nic installed? what is connection 1 on windows isnt automaticaly eth0in linux
2006-12-24T08:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	ah, you might be running a personal firewall on windows? :)
2006-12-24T08:34:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	no, no firewall
2006-12-24T08:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	some pf:s for windows sets up a fake device
2006-12-24T08:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	you should ;)
2006-12-24T08:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	anyhow, when in doubt, trust unix ;)
2006-12-24T08:36:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	well doing "ifconfig -a" I see eth1 and eth0 - both of which have the same mac address
2006-12-24T08:36:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	thats strange...
2006-12-24T08:36:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	i see great breakage in my crystall ball :P
2006-12-24T08:36:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	hehe
2006-12-24T08:37:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	no
2006-12-24T08:38:00.000Z	AlexC_	nolimitsoya	eth0 has no inet addr - let me pastebin the output
2006-12-24T08:40:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	AlexC_	i second POVaddct :P
