2007-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	hatter		i have installed two 7.10 servers and they both have a network slowness problem which appears related to samba, both are completely diffrenet hardware, when i went to etch on one of them the problem disappeared, anyone with any clues on this ?
2007-11-22T04:10:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	are you using a wins server?
2007-11-22T04:15:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	 no wins server,  which has been another issue, stupid windows updates turning on lmhosts lookup
2007-11-22T04:16:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	either use a wins server or update the lmhosts on the linux boxes.
2007-11-22T04:17:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	If it takes a long time to do anything, but it finally comes up, that's the problem.
2007-11-22T04:17:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	 or turn of wins lookup on the clients...
2007-11-22T04:17:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	why are you saying to use a wins server ?
2007-11-22T04:17:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	why would anyone want to use a wins server if you dont have to ?
2007-11-22T04:18:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	wins server will have a list of all the machines, so they will not have to broadcast for them
2007-11-22T04:18:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	a netbios list ?
2007-11-22T04:18:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	yes
2007-11-22T04:18:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	lmhosts file does the same
2007-11-22T04:19:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	oh yes it will...  which would be a good idea for a samba server
2007-11-22T04:19:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	winblows will try wins for a few minutes, then dns
2007-11-22T04:19:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	not if lmhosts lookup is turned off
2007-11-22T04:20:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	are you aware of any change in 7.10 regarding wins or samba or lookups ?
2007-11-22T04:21:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	not aware of any changes.
2007-11-22T04:21:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	 cool thx. this slowness appears related to 7.10
2007-11-22T04:41:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	whenever your trying to locate something not in its cache.
2007-11-22T04:42:00.000Z	joeb3_	hatter	the first time you browse to server1, it queries the wins server and puts that name in its cache.
2007-11-22T04:43:00.000Z	hatter	joeb3_	thx, thats my memory thought...
