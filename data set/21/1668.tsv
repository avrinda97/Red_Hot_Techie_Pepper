2010-10-23T20:32:00.000Z	momerath		Hey everybody!
2010-10-23T20:33:00.000Z	momerath		I've just installed the Nvidia drivers after a fresh install. On other OSes when I drag windows around they do so smoothly. When I do this in Gnome the windows look choppy. Sort of like when vsync is turned off in a game. Is there a way to make them transition smoothly?
2010-10-23T20:34:00.000Z	momerath		I think tearing would be a better way to describe what the windows are doing
2010-10-23T20:36:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	try disabling compiz and see what happens
2010-10-23T20:36:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	it's a bit better
2010-10-23T20:37:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	ok, so then its not compiz, if it would be then it would be a LOT better
2010-10-23T20:39:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	i had to install win7 yesterday...., i think ubuntu is curently the sexiest os in the marker (even with the compiz weirdness.....)
2010-10-23T20:40:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	I dunno about that. OSX is pretty slick.
2010-10-23T20:40:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	ubuntu still wins (i'am actually an osx user as well)
2010-10-23T20:40:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	lol I'll agree that its really good
2010-10-23T20:41:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	I just gave up on installing OSX on this machine and went with Ubuntu. It was that or deal with Windows again.
2010-10-23T20:41:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	oh, actually i have a real mac, but we are off topic now
2010-10-23T20:41:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	Same here. Sorry for the topic derail
2010-10-23T20:47:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	Fixed!
2010-10-23T20:48:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	what was it?
2010-10-23T20:49:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	Had to use the CompizConfigSettingsManager. Go to General Options -> Display Settings. Check Sync to VBlank, Uncheck Detect Refresh Rate, set the Refresh Rate to whatever your monitor is set to.
2010-10-23T20:50:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	The only problem now is that my theme is all messed up.
2010-10-23T20:52:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	ic
2010-10-23T21:31:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	32gb is plenty for software as well
2010-10-23T21:32:00.000Z	momerath	brontoeee	You think so? I guess I'm used to Windows where everything that is installed takes up a massive amount of space.
2010-10-23T21:34:00.000Z	brontoeee	momerath	yes, massive games usually come with some sort of custom installer, so that can be installed on your big drive
