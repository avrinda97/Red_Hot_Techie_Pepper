2011-01-29T16:40:00.000Z	drthoth		hello, awhile back I configured my ssh server in a way that stopped the server from creating a new ssh/bash instance for the same user, allowing them to run multiple sessions but under 1 login. i believe it used pam. can anyone help me out?
2011-01-29T16:41:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	I usually do that with screen
2011-01-29T16:42:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	you have one screen session with multiple shells open within it
2011-01-29T16:42:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	you'd just have to have one terminal per
2011-01-29T16:43:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	I don't see how that would be of any benefit
2011-01-29T16:43:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	...which is why I run screen
2011-01-29T16:45:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	do you have an ubuntu-related question or not?
2011-01-29T16:48:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	if you're so sure about your method, then stop asking and test it out yourself using top on the remote computer - make 10 connections and see what uses more memory: 10 different instances or using screen
2011-01-29T16:50:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	feel free to drop your own attitude at anytime.
2011-01-29T16:50:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	and you are now offtopic, please feel free to discuss your results or don't bother, thanks.
2011-01-29T16:51:00.000Z	drthoth	Gnea	you brought it off topic by continuing to address the unrelated issue where I'm trying to correct your assumption
2011-01-29T16:53:00.000Z	Gnea	drthoth	I'll help you as I see fit, if my help isn't appreciated, I'm sure someone else will be happy to try to help.
