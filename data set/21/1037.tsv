2011-04-30T07:43:00.000Z	FoolsRun		RE above: I don't think Ubuntu will be a stepping stone to other distros any more than Windows is a stepping stone to other Linux distros. Some people just like a desktop operating system
2011-04-30T07:44:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	Wait till ubuntu comes preloaded on Dell pcs. Then its windows all over again. Nobody knows there was a windows in 100 years. Cus everyone will use Linux.
2011-04-30T07:45:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	how is that a bad thing?
2011-04-30T07:45:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	Cus then nobody will know the differance. Nobody will remember us.
2011-04-30T07:45:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	I don't get it
2011-04-30T07:46:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	Personaly... I love peoples faces when i tell them " I Run Linux, Windows and OSX on one computer." I dont wanna lose that. I like being differnt. :)
2011-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	so you're more interested in being part of an elite group than in there being a usable third option for normal users?
2011-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	Pretty much. Its why i became a white hat. Its why i use archlinux.
2011-04-30T07:48:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	I just don't get it, I guess. I like computers to be easy for everyone to use, not complicated so that only a special few can take part.
2011-04-30T07:49:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	I'm selfish tbh. I've always been "the player" "the nerd" "that guy", Ive always wanted to stand out and i have the physical and mental means to do so. I also have an obsession with making things work and look perfect.
2011-04-30T07:49:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	Yea i see, and agree with, your point :)
2011-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	but surely you see the advantage of a useful, functional, uncomplicated distro for people like, case in point, my wife who has Natty on a netbook and loves it.
2011-04-30T07:50:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	Theres only one reason i dont use natty. The application button. Way to unorganised for me. My OCD goes wild.
2011-04-30T07:51:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	actually I like that. I use Win7 at work and am always tapping the Windows key and searching, and the Application button has that same functionality.
2011-04-30T07:52:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	And i fix alot of computers each day. Me and 7 guys share a live/work space as a group of whitehat hackers for hire. We also fix computers in our spare time. When someone comes to me for a reformat job, or a system upgrade, They get the LTS.
2011-04-30T07:53:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	you're installing Linux for customers? Brave. I don't like being on the hook like that when they hate it or it breaks.
2011-04-30T07:53:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	I havent have one person complain. Ive had a few that thought it was an upgrade to Windows.
2011-04-30T07:54:00.000Z	FoolsRun	NictraSavios	"Where's my Outlook" is all I'd ever hear
2011-04-30T07:54:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	I said "Sorry i upgraded it for you, its called "Evolution" now."
2011-04-30T07:54:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	And people around here use hotmail for some reason.....
2011-04-30T07:57:00.000Z	NictraSavios	FoolsRun	People are ignorant. Use that against them "Hey i upgraded your system to "Windows Ubuntu"
