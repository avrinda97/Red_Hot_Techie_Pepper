2006-12-11T09:14:00.000Z	Boelcke		Sorry, gotta run.  Good luck Trevinho!
2006-12-11T09:15:00.000Z	Boelcke		Before I go, does anyone know why "more" shows these funny question mark characters (in an html file), while gedit shows them as spaces? 
2006-12-11T09:15:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	They must not be literal spaces.  &nbsp;'s, perhaps?
2006-12-11T09:17:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	hm, hadn't thought of that.  Sounds like a reasonable answer.  How would I hack them off out of a file I've got?  As in, can I just put &nbsp into a sed command?
2006-12-11T09:24:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	I tried hacking that character off with a sed 's_\&nbsp__' command, but I'm not sure that's the right way to say it.
2006-12-11T09:25:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	Hmm, let me check something.
2006-12-11T09:26:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	ok, thanks.
2006-12-11T09:32:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	Hmm, looks like more knows the nbsp character, but it might still be one of the other whitespace chars.  Can you get the hexcode for it?
2006-12-11T09:32:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	how would I get the hexcode for it...?  (Sorry)
2006-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	thanks for the input so far.  My issue is that I have a number that I'd like to use in some math inside my bash script, but it's choking on that extra character.
2006-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	You'll need a hex editor.  I'm afraid I'm still a relative newbie around here, but I know I've seen a good one.
2006-12-11T09:34:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	I'll go do that right now.
2006-12-11T09:38:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	hex is A0...
2006-12-11T09:39:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	What's file report for encoding?
2006-12-11T09:40:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	well the text file I've put this in says ISO-8859 text, but the original document says "exported SGML document text"
2006-12-11T09:41:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	Okay, that'll be an NBSP then...  Hmm...
2006-12-11T09:43:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	Okay, give this a try.  Open the file in vi(m).  Type :%s/^kns/ /g  (^k = control+k, it and the ns should form a nonbreaking space, which will probably look wierd).  Then :wq to save and quit.
2006-12-11T09:45:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	sed is able to find and replace characters per the hexcode.  So who cares what the silly character is, I've killed it with a sed 's_\xA0__'
2006-12-11T09:45:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	Excellent!  Smart man.
2006-12-11T09:46:00.000Z	Boelcke	FunnyMan3595	sometimes you need someone else to suggest another track to go down.  One of your steps to figure it out turned out to be the solution.  Love it.  Thanks for the help!
2006-12-11T09:46:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	Boelcke	Glad I could help.
