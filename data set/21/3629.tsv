2008-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		correct
2008-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		which ubuntu can I get installed under virtual pc 2007?
2008-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		ram is dirt cheap right now
2008-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		ah
2008-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		or is it the generic video drivers that is the show stopper
2008-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		ok nevertheless, which ubuntu do I want
2008-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		for a quadcore intel based
2008-11-08T08:13:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover		Im looking at intrepid ibex is that the wrong distro?
2008-11-08T08:13:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	you can use either the 32bit or the 64bit cd
2008-11-08T08:14:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	both are fine, however you may have some issues with the 64bit and some applications
2008-11-08T08:15:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	hardy is more stable whilst intrepid has newer stuff. You should be aware that 32bit can only handle up tp 3GB of RAM
2008-11-08T08:16:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	you can use samba to do that, it is reasonably easy
2008-11-08T08:17:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	it uses the linux filesystem, you will probably want ext3
2008-11-08T08:18:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	correct, that is what samba allows you to do
2008-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover	ziroday	using ext3 then?
2008-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	yep
2008-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	Mountain_Mover	ziroday	documentation still the same for samba in that you have to read 50 pages?
2008-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	not so much, you should look at those links I gave you before
2008-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	either will work fine. but if the computer is just going to be a server then perhaps the server install is best
2008-11-08T08:23:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	you can remove the afterwards, or you can use the minimal install iso
2008-11-08T08:56:00.000Z	ziroday	Mountain_Mover	thats correct
