2005-10-01T13:37:00.000Z	obontu		not just the display
2005-10-01T13:37:00.000Z	obontu		will it turn it off completely or can i wake it up by pressing a key or moving my mouse?
2005-10-01T13:37:00.000Z	obontu		no i'm not
2005-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	obontu		i don't wanna a preview
2005-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	obontu		i'm running hog
2005-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	obontu		yes

2005-10-01T13:39:00.000Z	obontu		thanx
2005-10-01T13:40:00.000Z	obontu		i tried to compile the new x-chat version, but it said i was missing perl, and i could find that package
2005-10-01T13:40:00.000Z	obontu		what's the name of it?
2005-10-01T13:41:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	why do you *need* the latest x-chat?
2005-10-01T13:42:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	we do mind that
2005-10-01T13:44:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	your missing the point, if there is a bug then the ubuntu version should be fixed, that is how distros stay stable, not by everyone running in a million different directions, and no two people running the same version
2005-10-01T13:45:00.000Z	obontu	ompaul	it's not in ubuntu, it's in xchat
2005-10-01T13:45:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	all that compiling is bad for you there is a version of mplayer for Ubuntu
2005-10-01T14:15:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	 that was the short version
2005-10-01T14:17:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	that is how you do it but change warty for hoary and hoary for breezy and it works
2005-10-01T14:17:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	but warned it is still development
2005-11-05T06:20:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	reboot
2005-11-05T06:21:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	did you use just the kernel or the meta package? i.e. what was the name of that which you installed
2005-11-05T06:22:00.000Z	ompaul	obontu	then its reboot time
