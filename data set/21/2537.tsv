2010-01-27T21:06:00.000Z	kubanc		hey, what should i do, if I update my ubuntu 8.04 I always get his:   the following packages have been kept back: firefox firefox-3.0 firefox-3.0-gnome-support
2010-01-27T21:07:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	What command are you using to upgrade?
2010-01-27T21:07:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	sudo apt-get update , and then sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-01-27T21:08:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	You probably need to use apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-01-27T21:08:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	doesn't sudo apt-get dist-upgrade upgrades ubuntu to higher version?
2010-01-27T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	No. See the message from ubottu above.
2010-01-27T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	I assure you dist-upgrade will not upgrade your Ubuntu to the next release.
2010-01-27T21:12:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	where can i look for the !upgrade command, or should i ask where do i look for what specific command stands for?
2010-01-27T21:12:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	man update or something like that?
2010-01-27T21:12:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	Its a command for ubottu, our channel bot  /msg ubottu upgrade
2010-01-27T21:13:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	thanks, look like dist-upgrade solved this
2010-01-27T21:15:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	i used this dist-upgrade, and now it deleted firefox
2010-01-27T21:15:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	Can you pastebin exactly what it did?
2010-01-27T21:16:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	sory, i thought that command "firefox-3.6" would launch firefox in terminal, , but the command "firefox" is correct
2010-01-27T21:16:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	Okay, good to hear things are working :)
2010-02-25T23:35:00.000Z	Pici	kubanc	gimp 2.8 doesn't even exist.
2010-02-25T23:36:00.000Z	kubanc	Pici	yes, sorry but i still cannot install gimp 2.7 under ubuntu 8.04 :'(
