2005-11-24T12:54:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	but holy jebus, the fonts are ginormous in ooffice2
2005-11-24T12:39:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	it works fine for me in breezy.  I don't get the error you got.
2005-11-24T12:39:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	i think it's an amd64 thing
2005-11-24T12:40:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	it works fine in my 32bit chroot
2005-11-24T12:40:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	bad packaging job.  wonder if it was even tested
2005-11-24T12:40:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	I don't have an amd64, but I would like one.  Other than ooffice2, are you happy with ubuntu on it?
2005-11-24T12:45:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	unfortunately i'm not. it boots slower than windows 2000 did
2005-11-24T12:46:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	was reasonably painless setting up my radeon vid card tho.  but that's something i only need to do once
2005-11-24T12:49:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	I set up a friend's AMD64 system.  We found Ubuntu slower on the seti program than Windows XP.  So, Ubuntu is not always faster.  But, I would still choose Ubuntu over Windows XP anyday for other reasons.
2005-11-24T12:52:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	i'd choose linux.  ubuntu i'm getting to where i can take it or leave it
2005-11-24T12:52:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	the ubuntu community is generally more helpful though
2005-11-24T12:53:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	I don't always use Ubuntu, either.  Ubuntu works fine for about half my machines and I use other distros on the rest.   What distro do you like best, or do you roll your own?
2005-11-24T12:54:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	the forums had a mention of it, looks like a packaging problem, it fails to install a one-liner shell script.  i pasted it in, works all right now
2005-11-24T12:55:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	i'm partial to debian.  suse is also nice for some things (save points in yast are nice)
2005-11-24T12:55:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	good.  Sounds like my experience with zope3.  There was one file missing and the sandbox instance would not start.
2005-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	how's zope3 anyway?  zope always struck me as a pile-o-hacks under the hood, supposedly this is a rewrite?
2005-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	is ginormous really big?  They look fine to me, but we probably have different video hardware.
2005-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	everything else is normal, but the fonts in the menus are huge, like three times the size of normal menu fonts.
2005-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	this is on kubuntu, possible it's looking for some gnome or gtk conf files i don't have
2005-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	Severian	sproingie	zope 2 did seem like a bunch of hacks.  Zope 3 looks like a big improvement, but I am no expert yet.  Zope 3 loses compatibility, but appears to have decided to sacrifice it for consistency and a better design for the long run.  I'll have a better idea in a month or two, but that is my impression now.  If you decide to learn it, don't start with the zope 3 developers handbook.
2005-11-24T13:01:00.000Z	sproingie	Severian	i'm all for killing backward compatibility if it kills all the weird security code with a million holes that breaks everywhere
