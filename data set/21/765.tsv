2011-06-24T10:17:00.000Z	deekr		I'm running natty on a VM in vista. I just installed ubu and set up unity, but the windowing system is still classic gnome. where would I go to fix this?
2011-06-24T10:17:00.000Z	tntc	deekr	which virtualization software are you using?
2011-06-24T10:18:00.000Z	deekr	tntc	virtual box
2011-06-24T10:18:00.000Z	deekr		latest version
2011-06-24T10:18:00.000Z	tntc	deekr	did you enable 3d support in the display settings of virtual box?
2011-06-24T10:18:00.000Z	deekr		yes
2011-06-24T10:19:00.000Z	tntc		guest tools as well?
2011-06-24T10:19:00.000Z	deekr		but when it first ran ubu during setup, it said that I didn't have the correct hardware and went into classic mode
2011-06-24T10:19:00.000Z	deekr		after the installation, I mounted and ran the guest tools
2011-06-24T10:20:00.000Z	deekr		then did an update, and restarted, but alas, still classic
2011-06-24T10:20:00.000Z	tntc		ok. at the login screen, down near the bottom, there should be an option for the session
2011-06-24T10:20:00.000Z	deekr		I believe it was Ubuntu, ill restart
2011-06-24T10:21:00.000Z	deekr		note that the unity panel on the left appears
2011-06-24T10:21:00.000Z	deekr		just the windowing system is classic
2011-06-24T10:21:00.000Z	tntc		huh... that's odd
2011-06-24T10:21:00.000Z	deekr		ill post a screenshot once it restarts
2011-06-24T10:24:00.000Z	deekr		I think I'm using the wrong words here
2011-06-24T10:24:00.000Z	deekr		the windowing system is okay
2011-06-24T10:25:00.000Z	deekr		but some of the menus and the main unity menu look classic
2011-06-24T10:26:00.000Z	deekr	tntc	http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=14100
2011-06-24T10:29:00.000Z	tntc	deekr	huh. that is weird... I dunno how to explain that. A theme?
