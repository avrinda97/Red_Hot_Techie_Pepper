2005-08-11T12:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	what's wrong ?
2005-08-11T12:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	did you compile your own kernel ?
2005-08-11T12:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	your like booting into single user mode or something
2005-08-11T12:10:00.000Z	Derkommissar	LinuxJones	this is a major ubuntu bug
2005-08-11T12:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	I have never heard of anything like this...cat /etc/inittab | grep id and see what your default runlevel is set to ...it should be set to 2 like this >> id:2:initdefault:
2005-08-11T12:12:00.000Z	Derkommissar	LinuxJones	Im not able to access the system
2005-08-11T12:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	you can't even boot into single user mode ?
2005-08-11T12:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	is there anything of value on that hard drive ?
2005-08-11T12:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	argh
2005-08-11T12:15:00.000Z	Derkommissar	LinuxJones	Is there a way to tell ubuntu to bypass fsck ?
2005-08-11T12:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	you can in the /etc/fstab file but you can't get get to it without first being able to mount the partition :(
2005-08-11T12:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	you still have the ubuntu installer disk ?
2005-08-11T12:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	ok you can add a 0 to like the 6th field for your partition's entry in /etc/fstab. that will disable fsck from running.
2005-08-11T12:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Derkommissar	this is an ext2 partition right ?
2005-08-11T12:48:00.000Z	Derkommissar	LinuxJones	i know you just told me howto bypass fsck at the startup
