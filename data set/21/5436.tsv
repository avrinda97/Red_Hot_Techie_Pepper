2007-10-21T06:55:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	what computer and what chipset?
2007-10-21T06:56:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	I use MacBook Pro with Linux and no probs with madwifi. I disagree with the advise to use ndiswrapper.
2007-10-21T06:56:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	is this Intel core duo
2007-10-21T06:58:00.000Z	Berzerker	whyameye	I already had it installed, then upgraded to gutsy, then it doesn't work, how would I re-configure it to work?
2007-10-21T06:59:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	I have a macbook here runnning madwifi on gutsy. I'll take a look. What are your symptoms? Or if you want to go with ndiswrapper, I'm not interested in arguing with people here, so that's fine.
2007-10-21T06:59:00.000Z	Berzerker	whyameye	nothing goes wrong, no errors, just doesn't show up in ifconfig, or the wireless menu
2007-10-21T07:02:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	try something like "wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor"
2007-10-21T07:03:00.000Z	Berzerker	whyameye	wlanconfig: ioctl: no such device
2007-10-21T07:04:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	modprobe ath_pci
2007-10-21T07:05:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	try an ifconfig again then...
2007-10-21T07:07:00.000Z	Berzerker	whyameye	nothing shows up
2007-10-21T07:08:00.000Z	Berzerker	whyameye	dealing with wifi
2007-10-21T07:08:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	it didn't return something with the wlanconf like "ath1" or something?
2007-10-21T07:09:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	see if "dmesg | grep ath" tells you anything...
2007-10-21T07:10:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	you should confirm that the card is being found by the hardware with lspci.

2007-10-21T07:13:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	I'm at a loss. You could try building from the svn repo. Mine is actually running the svn because I wanted packet injection. It's an easy build.
2007-10-21T07:15:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	not sure. There is madwifi-unload...
2007-10-21T07:15:00.000Z	Berzerker	whyameye	is that in conjunction with apt-get install?
2007-10-21T07:16:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	no it is a normal command. I take it you have madwifi-tools installed?
2007-10-21T07:17:00.000Z	whyameye	Berzerker	don't know then. Sorry.
