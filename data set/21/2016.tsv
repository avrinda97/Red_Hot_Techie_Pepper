2010-06-18T20:29:00.000Z	HaPK		all of them are up
2010-06-18T20:30:00.000Z	HaPK		sound does come out, it just comes out from one source
2010-06-18T20:31:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	is pulseaudio prioritized in the preferences of Amarok2 http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Phonon
2010-06-18T20:32:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	I'm gonna try that
2010-06-18T20:38:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	you put pulse on the top of the list? and that didn't work?
2010-06-18T20:39:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	the soundcard driver is at the top, but it didn't worked. PulseAudio was next
2010-06-18T20:39:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	exactly, put pulse on the top, it is set to hog the hardware directly
2010-06-18T20:40:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	nope, won't work
2010-06-18T20:41:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	won't?
2010-06-18T20:41:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	no
2010-06-18T20:41:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	it seems the problem is not directly related with amarok
2010-06-18T20:41:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	it happens if I use any other player
2010-06-18T20:46:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	so no sounds can be heard simultaneously *ever* with any apps? or just when you launch amarok?
2010-06-18T20:47:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	with any aplication, and it seems it reamins captured until I reboot
2010-06-18T20:47:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	but is it fine until you launch amarok?
2010-06-18T20:49:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	and if you kill amarok (remove it from the system tray), things go back to normal?
2010-06-18T20:49:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	let me try
2010-06-18T20:50:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	no, things didn't went back to normal
2010-06-18T20:51:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	it's a if it still has it captured
2010-06-18T20:51:00.000Z	thune3	HaPK	can i PM you?
2010-06-18T20:51:00.000Z	HaPK	thune3	sure
