2008-05-03T08:00:00.000Z	friedtofu	pen	the regular firefox should work for you pretty quickly - but if you still want swiftweasel then it depends on your arch
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	pen	friedtofu	I just want to try it
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	friedtofu	pen	if its core2duo it'll be amd64 or x86_64 -
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	pen	friedtofu	64?

2008-05-03T08:05:00.000Z	pen	friedtofu	but why core 2 duo is athlon?
2008-05-03T08:06:00.000Z	friedtofu	pen	yeah. i was just checking - i guess it isnt... i thought that athlon64 is the same as amd64 - but it isnt.. .so dont dl it

2008-05-03T08:07:00.000Z	pen	friedtofu	strange, the athlon64 boots
2008-05-03T08:07:00.000Z	friedtofu	pen	i believe they'll all boot - but its just optimized for that arch
