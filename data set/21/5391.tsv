The "instructions" that come with the patch aren't instructions, its a list of commands. When i put the commands in to install the driver, it comes up "no such directory exists" i have a file named "alsa" and subfiles on my desktop. I am following the instructions on the forum, but they are

2007-10-23T11:01:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	Where are these instructions you followed?
2007-10-23T11:01:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	if it says it can't find the directory, it's possible that you need to switch to that directory first.
2007-10-23T11:03:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	According to the instructions, you downloaded a file called "alsa-driver-1.0.15rc1.tar.gz", no?
2007-10-23T11:03:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	Where did you put it?
2007-10-23T11:03:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	If you just used Firefox to download it, then it probably saved to your desktop.
2007-10-23T11:04:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	cd ~/Desktop/alsa
2007-10-23T11:12:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	Sorry, you're still having problems? What does it say now?
2007-10-23T11:15:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	One command at a time. It tells you that "tar" isn't a valid command, first of all?
2007-10-23T11:18:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	Well, in some cases, the mixer starts out muted. Also, in my case, I needed to enable an option called "External Amplifier" to get sound on my laptop.
2007-10-23T11:19:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	Since I don't know which sound card model you have, I can't guarantee that you would have the same settings.  But for me, it's in the sound mixer.
2007-10-23T11:21:00.000Z	Fyda	robbster1	Okay, you did say you've seen all the forum stuff on this problem, but this thread mentions the External Amplifier option: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=276343
2007-10-23T11:26:00.000Z	robbster1	Fyda	The external amplifier option isn't there for me
