2006-07-01T16:19:00.000Z	revilot		whats the best program for viewing/managing photos including raw format
2006-07-01T16:20:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	I like F-Spot, but you can use Picasa if you are familiar with it.  It has a Linux version now
2006-07-01T16:20:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	how do you view pics at 1:1
2006-07-01T16:20:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	1:1 ?  Don't understand
2006-07-01T16:21:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	most viewer programs allow you to view the picture in actual pixels
2006-07-01T16:21:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	full size
2006-07-01T16:21:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	i can get f-spot to do that
2006-07-01T16:22:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	i can zoom in but it doesnt tell me at what percentage its showing me the pic in
2006-07-01T16:22:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	good question, I never noticed that.  That's something that should definitely be included
2006-07-01T16:23:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	have you tried gphoto2?
2006-07-01T16:24:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	hadn't heard of it until now.
2006-07-01T16:25:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	do you shoot in raw or jpg
2006-07-01T16:25:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	tiff, space permitting
2006-07-01T16:25:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	maybe this is old, but gphoto2 doesn't look that feature-full : http://www.gphoto.org/doc/manual/screenshots/gtkam/file.png
2006-07-01T16:26:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	ya i didnt think so either but hadnt tried it yet
2006-07-01T16:26:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	f-spot is ok minus a few things
2006-07-01T16:26:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	I agree, it could use some more features
2006-07-01T16:27:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	there's one other I tried, I forget ....
2006-07-01T16:28:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	ah yes, I tried digikam but it had fewer features than f-spot and was kde-based
2006-07-01T16:29:00.000Z	revilot	userundefine	i really wish there was an open source raw editor, aside from uf-raw
2006-07-01T16:33:00.000Z	userundefine	revilot	you may want to check out gimp-dcraw and gimp-ufraw packages.  apparently they allow for raw functioanlity in gimp
