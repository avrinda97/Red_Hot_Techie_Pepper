2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	crashd	stefg	that's not exactly what i asked
2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	stefg	crashd	have you read the howto?
2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	crashd		that only applies if you can actually get ubuntu to recognise the device
2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	crashd		yeah, it used to work, not it doesnt
2006-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	crashd		now, rather
2006-09-23T10:45:00.000Z	crashd	stefg	the problem is that ubuntu isnt firing the scsi driver for it
2006-09-23T10:45:00.000Z	crashd		and i dont know why ;\
2006-09-23T10:45:00.000Z	stefg	crashd	are you able to mount it manually (sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt) ?
2006-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	crashd	stefg	no, as i say it doesnt come up as a scsi device
2006-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	crashd		at all
2006-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	crashd		i checked dmesg and it says it's plugged in, but it just isnt loading the scsi driver for it
2006-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	stefg	crashd	anything special in dmesg after you've plugged it in?
2006-09-23T10:47:00.000Z	crashd	stefg	not at all
2006-09-23T10:47:00.000Z	crashd		[ 2608.478061]  usb 1-8: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 11
2006-09-23T10:47:00.000Z	crashd		and then a USB Disconnect when i unplug it
2006-09-23T10:47:00.000Z	stefg		hmmm... a case of 'doesn't work' so far...
2006-09-23T10:48:00.000Z	crashd		it was working earlier when i was on ubuntu64, but i needed to install 32bit instead, and since ive done that it hasn't worked
2006-09-23T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	crashd	i have no clue what the problem could be. Involved are hal, dbus, pmount and gnome-volume-manager.... happy hunting
2006-09-23T10:50:00.000Z	crashd	stefg	O_o
