2010-10-12T11:53:00.000Z	leling		Gregory:What's the matter with you...
2010-10-12T11:53:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	my desktop screen becomes unusable
2010-10-12T11:56:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	well I have ubuntu 10.10, boot to desktop, open any app like firefox .. within 10-20 mins the screen starts becoming corrupt to a point where the desktop is unusable, necessitating a reboot. My laptop is 1 year old and runs fine on other MS OS
2010-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	i even tried disableing desktop effects.. no difference
2010-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	do you need more details than this?
2010-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	no become corrupt. patches of white start to spread on the entire desktop... covering whatever is on screen
2010-10-12T12:01:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	yes
2010-10-12T12:03:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	i do not use nautilus
2010-10-12T12:03:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	I have tested with firefox window. not tried opening nautalis
2010-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	even closing all apps does not make desktop clear
2010-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	a reboot is my only option
2010-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	or using lynx in console .. which is not very nice
2010-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	I have everything on stock. and since my graphics chipset is old .. it is serviced by the open source radeon driver
2010-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	ubuntu does not list anything in the proprietary driver applet
2010-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	i know and it makes ubuntu unusable
2010-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	or rather X unusable
2010-10-12T12:12:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	what do u mean change X?
2010-10-12T12:14:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	but that would mean loosing my current X with all the apps?
2010-10-12T12:14:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	every 20 mins or so?
2010-10-12T12:14:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	i even tried KDE. same problem
2010-10-12T12:15:00.000Z	Gregory	leling	ty. you were better than the other guy atleast
