2007-04-12T08:32:00.000Z	bruenig	MrMakeveli	what are you trying to do, don't install that for flash
2007-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	bruenig	i have flash support for one of my media players
2007-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	bruenig	so thats ok. but what i need is one that doesnt just play flash videos, but also interactive ones
2007-04-12T08:34:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	bruenig	no ideas?
2007-04-12T08:35:00.000Z	bruenig	MrMakeveli	don't think such a thing exists
2007-04-12T08:36:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	bruenig	you know how if you have a normal flash player in windows, you can watch videos or if its a game or interactive flash, you can operate it?
2007-04-12T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	MrMakeveli	revision:  don't think such a thing exists for linux (although I think I have a game that uses standalone flashplayer 6 or something really old
2007-04-12T08:37:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	bruenig	because i have a swf of an ebook or something, and if i open it w/ a media player it kinda does weird things
