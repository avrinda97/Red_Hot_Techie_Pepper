2007-02-26T14:07:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Hi, I'm using a webcam on my Ubuntu (running the server version) and I have a USB logitech webcam hooked up to it
2007-02-26T14:07:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		How can I tell which /dev/ it's coming in on?
2007-02-26T14:08:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	xawtv will tell can help with which v4l device it is
2007-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Yeah but since this server's running headless + I manage it through SSH, will I be able to check it without a monitor?
2007-02-26T14:10:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	humm I always had X for that stuff. can you use X forwarding via ssh?
2007-02-26T14:10:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		I uh I don't know.
2007-02-26T14:10:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	ssh offers it. see -X in ssh man page. or, find some other way to enumerate it w/o X
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Ahhh fux.
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		I forgot that it wants my CD
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		How can I change apt sources? =\
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	man 5 sources.list
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Thanks a bunch, both of you. =] 
2007-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	Supaplex	pseudoplacebo@pericles:/etc/apt$ xawtv
2007-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		This is xawtv-3.94, running on Linux/i686 (2.6.15-27-server)
2007-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Error: Can't open display:
2007-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		=\ is there any other way I can figure out which video source my webcam is coming in on? =\
2007-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	try ssh -2X host while I look.
2007-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	Supaplex	The 'problem' is that I'm connected to my Ubuntu server through iTerm in OS X. So I'm not sure if x-forwarding or similar would work...
2007-02-26T14:25:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	xawtv also probes /dev/video0-3 on this system. let me try with this webcam, that ... doesn't yet work in linux.
2007-02-26T14:28:00.000Z	Supaplex	PseudoPlacebo	no other ideas. maybe /etc/ssh/sshd_config X11 is off to?
2007-02-26T14:28:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	Supaplex	Well I think it's not the problem I thought it was.
