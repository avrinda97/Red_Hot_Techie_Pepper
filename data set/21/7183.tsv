2006-11-20T14:13:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	there isnt one, the root account is locked by default
2006-11-20T14:31:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	enable universe, update and then try the install again
2006-11-20T14:32:00.000Z	shodanjr_gr	rioghal	thx :)
2006-11-20T14:34:00.000Z	shodanjr_gr	rioghal	that didnt work...
2006-11-20T14:35:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	you edited the /etc/apt/sources.list file and ran 'sudo apt-get update' ?
2006-11-20T14:37:00.000Z	shodanjr_gr	rioghal	yes i did
2006-11-20T14:37:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	well, torrentflux is in the universe repo. care to pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2006-11-20T14:40:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	heres my sources.list for comparison: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32986/

2006-11-20T14:43:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	you on dapper or edgy?
2006-11-20T14:49:00.000Z	shodanjr_gr	rioghal	i used the sources.list you gave me. did apt-get update. still no dice...
2006-11-20T14:49:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	if youre on dapper, then torrentflux isnt in the repos, if youre on edgy, then its there.
2006-11-20T14:49:00.000Z	shodanjr_gr	rioghal	any way i can get it on dapper?
2006-11-20T14:49:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	i was relying on the info from the bot which is why i gave you the wrong into, sorry about that
2006-11-20T14:50:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	i suppose you can compile it yourself
2006-11-20T14:50:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	also, im not sure its a good idea to have both dapper and edgy sources in your sources.list
2006-11-20T14:50:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	that may lead you into dependency hell, lol
2006-11-20T14:51:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	that may bring in deps for edgy that arent compatible with dapper
2006-11-20T14:52:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	which is why you shouldnt mix repos ;)
2006-11-20T14:52:00.000Z	rioghal	shodanjr_gr	as i said, you can try to compile it yourself
