2011-08-13T17:23:00.000Z	Gentoo64		CameronM- do you have windows?
2011-08-13T17:23:00.000Z	Gentoo64		and an nvidia card?
2011-08-13T17:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64		theres one called crark that uses nvidia cuda
2011-08-13T17:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64		does like millions a second brute force
2011-08-13T17:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64		Doodad- its very unlikely
2011-08-13T17:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64		because hes new to linux
2011-08-13T17:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64		Doodad- from my exerience, windows can feel snappier than linux on slower pcs
2011-08-13T17:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64		usr13- windows xp yes, much snappier than xubuntu on my downstairs comp
2011-08-13T17:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64		not tried 7 on it
2011-08-13T17:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64		SeventhDimension- cat /proc/cpuinfo
2011-08-13T17:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	usr13 could we please get back on topic
2011-08-13T17:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	and venturing too far afield.
2011-08-18T03:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	?
2011-08-18T03:17:00.000Z	Gentoo64	bazhang	dont be like that
2011-08-18T03:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	then dont tell people to google it. no response is better than that
2011-08-18T03:19:00.000Z	Gentoo64	bazhang	no response is better? does that mean its a good response?
2011-10-16T03:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	thats not helpful
2012-01-23T00:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	its the ncurses based install only also known as the debian-installed, different from the live cd which lets you test drive without installing, and the choice to install
2012-01-23T00:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	bazhang	yes, but as his cpu is 400mhz i take it he has next to no ram...
2012-01-23T00:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	bazhang	in other words itll be much faster
2012-01-23T00:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Gentoo64	indeed. for low ram
