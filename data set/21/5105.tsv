2008-05-04T05:44:00.000Z	shaiguitar		(basically, how do i find the source)
2008-05-04T05:44:00.000Z	andi5	shaiguitar	apt-get source $pkg
2008-05-04T05:45:00.000Z	andi5	shaiguitar	just make sure, you activated the source repositories
2008-05-04T05:45:00.000Z	shaiguitar	andi5	i already installed the package, i want to find those files
2008-05-04T05:46:00.000Z	andi5	shaiguitar	so do you need the source or rather the .h files, i.e. the  corresponding -dev package?
2008-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	shaiguitar	andi5	no i'm looking for the source files themselves because i need to put them in the path so i can use them for some other build that uses it as a dep
2008-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	andi5	shaiguitar	please just tell us what packages you are talking about...

2008-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	shaiguitar	andi5	.. i already installed it btw
2008-05-04T05:48:00.000Z	andi5	shaiguitar	so, if you want to link against sqlite3, just install libsqlite3-dev
2008-05-04T05:49:00.000Z	andi5	shaiguitar	i cannot imagine what really needs the sources of sqlite3... well, and otherwise: apt-get source libsqlite3, just as i wrote at the beginning
