2006-05-29T07:12:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I have used the kaffeine plugin before to play realplayer videos.
2006-05-29T07:13:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I'm not sure if you already need realplayer installed in order for kaffeine to play the videos, though.
2006-05-29T07:14:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	is kaffeine a firefox plugin?
2006-05-29T07:15:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	kaffeine is a media player.  You need to install kaffeine-mozilla separately to play embedded videos.
2006-05-29T07:16:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	Coll Ill try that
2006-05-29T07:16:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I personally have no problem with realplayer.  The only flaw I see in realplayer is that it does not maximinze embedded videos on linux.
2006-05-29T07:18:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	the problem I have with it is on the windows side it installs so much crap and trys to associate itself with all your media files and dont even talk about the mesage centre. As I am now switching to open source I want to try and stick will all open source stuff.
2006-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	realplayer on linux is different.  It doesn't have all the B.S. it has on windows.
2006-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I use realplayer when it is opened externally on linux.  It works great in that scenario.
2006-05-29T07:22:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	you may need to uninstall the totem plugin for mozilla in order to play streaming windows media videos.
2006-05-29T07:23:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	here is a good site to test realplayer and windows media videos:  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/view/
2006-05-29T07:24:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	here is an example of where realplayer opens externally.  This is where realplayer works well on linux:  http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/141024
2006-05-29T07:24:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	thanks for the help I have only been using ubuntu for a couple of weeks but I am loving it.
2006-05-29T07:24:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	you need the win32 codecs to play windows videos
2006-05-29T07:25:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I'm still fairly new to linux but I have gotten it to do just about everything windows does so far.
2006-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	I think it is getting very close to being full replacement. I enjoy hacking around with the terminal but I think less technically minded may still find it a little tricky but its not far from prime time.
2006-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I don't consider myself too technically minded.  I'm not a programmer.  I just started playing with linux once and since then i've been hooked.
2006-05-29T07:34:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	I recommend installing several video players.  Some videos don't play in some players.  I think it has to do with codec stuff.  I have kaffeine, xine, mplayer, and totem installed.  I use amarok and xmms for audio.
2006-05-29T07:35:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	I also use VLC which I have found to be excellent
2006-05-29T07:36:00.000Z	nomin	irelandshope	if you want ideas to make your desktop look a lot cooler, check out these sites:  http://www.gnome-look.org/   http://www.kde-look.org/
2006-05-29T07:37:00.000Z	irelandshope	nomin	cool thanks
