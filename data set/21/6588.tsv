2007-05-16T05:43:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	sudo apt-get install aptitude
2007-05-16T05:44:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	can't do it..because it tell me that aptitude is installed...or must I do "apt-get remove aptitude & apt-get install aptitude" ?
2007-05-16T05:44:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	that will work too.
2007-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	doesn't work... /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (2 No file or directory)
2007-05-16T05:46:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	do you have synaptic open? Close it. Did you use the --reinstall?
2007-05-16T05:47:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	i used --reinstall yes...and i don't have synaptic open...
2007-05-16T05:47:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	sudo apt-get install aptitude? Gives you an error msg?
2007-05-16T05:48:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	it tells me that aptitude is already installed...
2007-05-16T05:49:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	les remove aptidute & reinstall it... 'sudo apt-get remove aptitude' then 'sudo apt-get install aptitude'
2007-05-16T05:50:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	K, hold.
2007-05-16T05:50:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	probably i can't remove it because is not working... :p
2007-05-16T05:51:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	looking up the 'fix' option.
2007-05-16T05:52:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	you mean aptitude fix ?
2007-05-16T05:53:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	to fix aptitude with apt-get -f
2007-05-16T05:53:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	not sure of the syntax though :/
2007-05-16T05:53:00.000Z	marrakech	EADG	doesn't work :(
2007-05-16T05:57:00.000Z	EADG	marrakech	Soory, I'm out of ideas.
