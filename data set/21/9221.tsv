2006-06-14T12:59:00.000Z	mada		i can't seem to get my nvidia drvers to work, i apt-get installed nvidia-glx ... is there anything futher i am supposed to do?
2006-06-14T13:01:00.000Z	triplep	mada	: do a cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf|grep nvidia
2006-06-14T13:02:00.000Z	mada	triplep	one moment ...
2006-06-14T13:02:00.000Z	mada	triplep	nothing
2006-06-14T13:03:00.000Z	triplep		good, that means it's a simple fix
2006-06-14T13:03:00.000Z	mada	triplep	do tell, please ... i am freaking out over here
2006-06-14T13:04:00.000Z	triplep		in the device section in the xorg.conf change the driver to nvidia... make a backup of the file first too
2006-06-14T13:04:00.000Z	triplep		X can be a fickle mistress
2006-06-14T13:05:00.000Z	mada	triplep	ok, one moment
2006-06-14T13:05:00.000Z	triplep		I'd paste it to yo, bu synergy is being  a POS in my mac
2006-06-14T13:06:00.000Z	triplep	mada	the value right now is probably vesa
2006-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	mada	triplep	the value was "nv"
2006-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	triplep		i can't remember if that is the legacy package or not
2006-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	triplep		one sec while I check
2006-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	mada	triplep	brb, gonna restart X
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	triplep	mada	did you get a nvidil flash before x started?
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	mada		my Nvidia works!!!
2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	mada	triplep	omfg, i owe you a million, it flashed the splash screen!!!
2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	triplep		word, i'm pretty sure nv is legacy
2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	mada		thankies Surfnkid, it is an incredible feeling
2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	mada	triplep	i guess
