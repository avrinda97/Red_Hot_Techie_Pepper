2010-12-18T10:56:00.000Z	tsrk		Is there some way I can go from a running installation to a recovery environment in a ramdisk with all of my actual volumes unmounted?
2010-12-18T10:57:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	run a live cd?
2010-12-18T10:57:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	unfortunately I don't have physical access - it's a colocated server
2010-12-18T10:59:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	what about mounting as read only?
2010-12-18T11:00:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	well, the volumes that I want to unmount are my LVM volumes, which I want to unmount so that I can rename them.
2010-12-18T11:00:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	but my root partition (including /boot) is on one of the LVM volumes
2010-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	I don't know what is a LVM volume :/
2010-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	it's hell... that's what it is
2010-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	just kidding, it's useful but makes stuff like this impossible it seems
2010-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	they moved sun java to the partner repos :(
2010-12-18T11:13:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	what is the problem with just changing the name of the volume? fstab?
2010-12-18T11:13:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	LVM doesn't want to change the name of a volume group which contains active volumes. it just says "Volume group "n2" still has active LVs"
2010-12-18T11:14:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	ah. http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Volume+group+*+still+has+active+LVs%22&num=50&safe=off&hl=en
2010-12-18T11:14:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	sorry, but that may be helpful
2010-12-18T11:17:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	actually, that did give better results than my google search (which i admit was less specific). but it still looks like i'd need to use a live cd, since / is on the LVM
2010-12-18T11:17:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	yep, I'm trying to find something useful
2010-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	thanks, but don't worry about it too much. i just wanted to change it to be consistent with the hostname change on my server, but it's only asthetic... nothing critical
2010-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	pepee	tsrk	well, if it works, don't touch it...
2010-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	yeah... i really need to learn :P
2010-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	(not to touch it that is... not learn by messing things up)
2010-12-18T11:20:00.000Z	tsrk	pepee	yep, and this really isn't the machine i should be doing that on :P  i don't want to be pissing off my datacenter with midnight KVM over IP requests
