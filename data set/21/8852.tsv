2006-01-24T09:53:00.000Z	shantanu		ok.. i have a 64 bit processor but i'm running a normal KUbuntu on it... i got an
2006-01-24T09:53:00.000Z	shantanu		ATI CaRD and want to install drivers .. which ones should I install
2006-01-24T09:53:00.000Z	shantanu		the ones for x86 or x86_64?
2006-01-24T09:55:00.000Z	timfrost	shantanu	the x86 drivers, unless you installed the 64-bit OS.
2006-01-24T09:55:00.000Z	shantanu	timfrost	i did that... but theres a slight problem... my UT wont rtun normally .. i dont think the drivers are helping
2006-01-24T09:56:00.000Z	shantanu	timfrost	also... my XOrg shows I have some Radeon x300 series Display adapter but thats not listed on the ATI site
2006-01-24T09:57:00.000Z	timfrost	shantanu	in that case, the ATI driver won't work.  Can you go back to the driver the install defaulted to?
2006-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	shantanu	timfrost	i guess....
2006-01-24T09:59:00.000Z	shantanu	timfrost	you think the default driver is better suited for the game?
2006-01-24T10:00:00.000Z	timfrost	shantanu	I don't know.  I don't have an ATI card.  Have a look at the ATI howto on the wiki ( https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI)
