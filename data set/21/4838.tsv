2010-04-07T08:04:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	so, what is your problem?
2010-04-07T08:05:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	okay, after install did it asked to took of the cd from the drive and rebooted the machine?
2010-04-07T08:06:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	okay, now your computer started, and... ?
2010-04-07T08:07:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	Windows vista have nothing to do with Ubuntu, you choose ubuntu in the Boot of the computer, before it loads Windows or any other operation system
2010-04-07T08:08:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	, you can't click on ubuntu
2010-04-07T08:08:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	and what happened after clicking enter on ubuntu ?
2010-04-07T08:08:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	I think you did not install ubuntu correctly
2010-04-07T08:09:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	so why do you have this problem?
2010-04-07T08:09:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	again, you did not install ubuntu correctly, I will recommend you to repeat the install process
2010-04-07T08:09:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	boot from the live CD and click in the Install icon on the desktop
2010-04-07T08:11:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	I don't care if you tried to install or if you think you installed correctly, the best thing you should do now, is just try again and see if after repeating the process the same error will happen. The installation don't took more them 1 hour, is less then what you gone loose trying to fix any boot problem
2010-04-07T08:36:00.000Z	maginot	Da-M-E-M-0	the time you are trying to solve this you could have already reinstalled ubuntu
