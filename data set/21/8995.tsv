2006-01-14T16:19:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	http://rafb.net/paste/results/goC2bN88.html any ideas?
2006-01-14T16:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	have you looked at /var/lib/dpkg/info/phpmyadmin.prerm  ? That seems to be where the problem lies
2006-01-14T16:23:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	yes, its just a script
2006-01-14T16:31:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	I had to add a line to /var/lib/dpkg/info/phpmyadmin.prerm before the if statement to make it work.
2006-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	aha! Well hacked sir !
2006-01-14T17:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	/usr/local/bin should be in your PATH
2006-01-14T17:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	just put a symlink in /usr/local/bin then
2006-01-14T17:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	I prefer it - YMMV
2006-01-14T17:46:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	so, if mysql is in /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql do you recommend that i do ln -s /usr/local/bin/mysql /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql (or is there a way to symlink the whole directory?)
2006-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	why don't you just symlink the executable?
2006-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	maybe because there are many other programs useful
2006-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	in the bin/mysql directory
2006-01-14T17:48:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	preferably id like to add the /usr/local/mysql/bin to my $PATH. how can i do that/
2006-01-14T17:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	globally in /etc/bash.bashrc, but /etc/profile also sources that IIRC
2006-01-14T17:57:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	if I want my test copy of mysql to start on reboots, i need to create a symbolic link for it called S20 etcc... in rc2.d?
2006-01-14T17:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	umm - I'm not familiar with mysql sorry -
2006-01-15T17:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	you need group writable as Seveas says
2006-01-15T06:23:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	I'm sshd into my ubuntu box and occasionally I get "randomly" disconnected. Sometimes while Idle for 10 minutes, other times while MID-TYPING something. Any idea whats going on?
2006-01-15T06:23:00.000Z	UncleD	thoreauputic_	Then, when I log back in, my ttypid is still alive, like, "im still connected".. I don't get it.
2006-01-15T06:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	UncleD	weird :|
