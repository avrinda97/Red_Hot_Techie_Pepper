2006-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	ken		Did someone kick me?
2006-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	ken		HELP, what are the "nv" drivers that appear in the list of drivers when one runs sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	ken		Does "nv"=nvidia?
2006-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	ken		So if i am having a nvidia card, should i select, VESA or NV from that list?
2006-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	yes
2006-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	and am i using free or proprietry drivers when i say "nv"?
2006-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	nv is the open source driver. nvidia is closed source, but it has 3D support
2006-12-15T06:23:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	So i am having nvidia geForce fx5200, and i should select "nv" from that list, which is open source nvidia driver (NOT proprietry one), and 3D support will be DISABLED, right?
2006-12-15T06:24:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	right
2006-12-15T06:24:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	it's not "disabled", it just doesn't work
2006-12-15T06:24:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	And if i want 3d support there is no way except to install nvidia-glx, right?
2006-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	right
2006-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	one more thing, what would happen if i select some other driver from that list in sudo dpkg-reconfigure...? for eg.VESA?
2006-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	some won't work at all. vesa will work, but it'll be lagging and not as clear as nv
2006-12-15T06:28:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	Thank you, may i hug you:)?
2006-12-15T06:28:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	that doesn't really work out over TCP/IP
2006-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	Endnote, are you 100% sure nv=nvidia and its open source? I am thinking why didn't they put that in the list as "nvidia"?
2006-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	ken	cyphase	Hilarious comment :)
2006-12-15T06:30:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	yes, nv is the nvidia driver. it's not called nvidia because that's the name of the closed source driver
2006-12-15T06:31:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	right
2006-12-15T06:32:00.000Z	cyphase	ken	your welcome
