2007-03-06T07:38:00.000Z	dhiraj		madsen
2007-03-06T07:38:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	Yeah?
2007-03-06T07:41:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	Well, the problem is what I tell the installer to do with grub? I guess it shouldn't install it on (hd0)...
2007-03-06T07:42:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	Won't that mess up my OS X?
2007-03-06T07:43:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	And it won't be safer to tell it to install on (hd0,3)? (hd0,3 being /dev/sda4, right?)
2007-03-06T07:45:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	Hmm... And you've done this before ... with rEFIt?
2007-03-06T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	A month old MacBook.
2007-03-06T07:48:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	So Intel Core 2 Duo
2007-03-06T07:48:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	I know, but I'm just afraid I'll mess something up, if I install grub to (hd0) (aka. MBR).
2007-03-06T07:50:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	Exactly my concern to. I think I've installed Linux (in various flavours, including Ubuntu) about a hundred times on PCs... But never before on a macbook.
2007-03-06T07:59:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	So (hd0,3) (for /dev/sda4), right?
2007-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	madsen	dhiraj	Thanks for your help!
