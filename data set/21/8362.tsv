2008-04-26T12:55:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	by the way, if you type joe_: it will highlight the text for me when you are talking to me
2008-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	Did you go to synaptic and enable the source?
2008-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	merlin_	joe_	ty, i did not know that
2008-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	merlin_	joe_	do what now? lol

2008-04-26T12:57:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	Go to System > Administration > Synaptic Package manager
2008-04-26T12:57:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	and then look for the source code they want
2008-04-26T12:57:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	then right click and mark it for installation, then click apply
2008-04-26T12:58:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	then read the last error code when you do the sudo sh nvidia*
2008-04-26T12:58:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	it will tell you how to tell it where the file is, there is some syntax I forget
2008-04-26T12:58:00.000Z	joe_	merlin_	and after all of that, it still won't work
2008-04-26T13:00:00.000Z	merlin_	joe_	ok...so rerun it and see if it tells me what files i need?
2008-04-26T13:01:00.000Z	merlin_	joe_	then download them from the synaptic thingy?
