2008-12-31T21:16:00.000Z	zanberdo		sorry,  I should have qualified my question.  I mean to ask: how can I determine the specific model of my processor?
2008-12-31T21:17:00.000Z	zanberdo		I know I've got a core2duo installed
2008-12-31T21:17:00.000Z	zanberdo		I'd like to know the specific model
2008-12-31T21:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	look in bios at boot
2008-12-31T21:22:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	ok, that is certainly one way.  Given that this is a 64-bit cpu, if I wanted to install the 64-bit kernel, would I install the amd64 version?  that doesn't sound right to me as it's intel...
2008-12-31T21:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	We try to encourage new users to stick with 32 bit until they get a better understanding of ubuntu/linux
2008-12-31T21:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	there is little advantage with 64 unless you really need to access more than 4 gigs of ram
2008-12-31T21:25:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	right, I understand this. but my question remains the same: where I to want to install the 64-bit version of ubuntu on my intel core2duo (assuming I had a reason to), would I download and install from the -amd64.iso or is there another avenue for intel 64?
2008-12-31T21:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	yes amd
2008-12-31T21:25:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	thank you
2008-12-31T21:26:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	sorry, one more thing: can you direct me to a reference site that explains the differences between 32 and 64 bit linux (beyond the memory management)?
2008-12-31T21:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	I cnnant think of one
2008-12-31T21:27:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	ok, np, thanks anyway
2009-01-09T04:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	I didnt think you could do pop on free accounts
2009-01-09T04:41:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	yes, I have confirmed that.  I was just curious if there was an add-on to evolution such as webmail for thunderbird that would work around the pop limitation.
2009-01-09T04:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	none that I am aware of whichis why I use gmail
2009-01-09T04:42:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	thanks.  I use em both.  Maybe I should just forward my yahoo mail to gmail...
2009-01-09T04:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	I didnt think they forwarded mail on free accounts either
2009-01-09T04:43:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	looking now...
2009-01-09T04:44:00.000Z	zanberdo	Jack_Sparrow	confirmed: you must have the mail plus account in order to forward.
2009-01-09T04:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	zanberdo	Sorry. been there done that..
