Does anyone know the option I'm talking about?
2008-05-01T08:40:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	Anyway, I had the same problem after upgrading, and that did the trick for me. I'm going to keep browsing the forums and see if I can find the post that fixed it for me
2008-05-01T08:40:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	i didn't think anyone read that... any suggestions will help.   I think the problem is with GDM, no?
2008-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	Honestly, I don't know what causes it. I upgraded to Hardy, fresh, and my resolution was out of wack in my log in screen. But I found a forum post, and it told me to use that login option, to redetect the graphic settings, or something to the effect. I'm going to see if I can link the post.
2008-05-01T08:42:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	thanks
2008-05-01T08:43:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	thanks for pointing me in the right direction

2008-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	If that worked already for you, awesome! but I didn't have to configure the xorg file, all I had to do was reboot and select this one graphics option
2008-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	heh, i just found that and assumed
2008-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	ok, I'm just going to reboot, and see what the option was called brb
2008-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	musikgoat		thanks end
2008-05-01T08:56:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	I believe you login, hit esc then go to "recovery mode" then it will boot some, and offer you options. Select xfix try to fix x server. I wish I could find the forum post to verify. But it didn't make me do anything else other than that if I remember correctly, it fixed my login screen and another res problem I was having too
2008-05-01T08:57:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	i appreciate your help...  editing xorg.conf fixed it though
2008-05-01T08:58:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	Great! well sorry if it took long, but I tried doing another forum search first just to try to verify
2008-05-01T08:58:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	"Thanks for the hint papabean, I merely had to change the 'Virtual' entry in xorg.conf to '1024 768' to match my usual resolution "
2008-05-01T08:58:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	no, thanks for the help
2008-05-01T08:59:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	cool, well glad it all worked out, heh that was driving me nuts too. Goes to show I should've added a post to the thread so I could've found it right away for reference
2008-05-01T08:59:00.000Z	musikgoat		hehe, a history of reads for logged in users would be nice there
2008-05-01T08:59:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	i've been in your dilemma before
2008-05-01T09:00:00.000Z	end-user	musikgoat	well, at least we'll have 6 months of no resolution problems (until the next release) ;)
2008-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	musikgoat	end-user	heh, this is true
